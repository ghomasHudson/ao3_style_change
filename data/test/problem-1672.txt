She smiled awkwardly, not knowing what to say for a brief moment. “Do you want to head down to breakfast? I’m sure you’re starving right now.”
His jaw dropped. “You amaze me.” He hadn’t meant to say it out loud, and she was obviously uncomfortable. He cleared his throat. “Sorry. I-”
Harry bit back a small smile. “I guess when you put it that way,” he said, but his smile fell. “Snape told me that you were able to do it. He said if you could do it, then it would be easy for me.”
He closed his book and sat it beside him. Placing his hands on either side of his legs that were swinging off the side of the table of which he was sitting upon. “And what exactly did he say?”
He stood up straight, as did his father, realizing who the boy was.
“No.” He choked out.
“Draco, it’s Halloween. You’re not locking yourself in the library redoing work you finished on Tuesday because you don’t want to socialize.”
Snape was the only person Draco talked to. He would occasionally have some genuine conversations with some of the other professors, but they were almost always related to academia.  He was now just two days away from beginning his fifth year at Hogwarts, and this was all still true.
“He- he-” he choked out between fits of laughter “-with a
He looked around. It was still the middle of the night, and he was the only one in the room. He sat up, carefully, as to not agitate anything that he had injured. But as he sat up, he found that he was able to do so with ease, and nothing was giving him pain. His head didn't even hurt. Why was he here?
Draco was in his bed, laying on his back, hands folded across his stomach.
•─────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────•
“Besides, you are just kind of famous, I don’t know if anyone has told you about that-”
“You can change what people think about you-”
Happy Christmas in July!
It was like this every year. Every year he’d seem so disappointed to go home, and whenever he returned, he was covered in cuts and bruises, and his eyes shone a little less. Draco didn’t know why he cared so much, he despised Harry Potter. But for whatever reason, Draco felt sorry for him, and even a little hurt whenever he saw the bruises.
He laughed. “I’m sorry! It was
“Expel-
It would be one thing if she was a Death Eater. If she looked like his Aunt Bellatrix. But no, she came off as a sickly sweet woman who liked cats and pink and ate too many cookies. And she used dark magic on her students.
“She was the one who said-”
Once she turned to talk to his father, Draco turned to Harry, sticking out his hand. “Look, I know you remember me from the robe shop. I was a brat, and I apologize for that. I hope we can make things right between us, sit with me on the train?”
“Fantastic. Well, do have an excellent night.”
“Do not speak to me!” Draco yelled. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, his heart pounding. “This is your fault! You are the one who sat with me on the train, and
She was finally here.
Draco looked up and saw a smile on his face. “Oh.”
“I could ask you the same thing,” Harry spat as he tightened his grip on Draco’s arms, pushing him even further against the wall. Draco felt his stomach drop “What the hell is
I dunno if you’ve noticed, but I used to be the master of being emotionless.”
all the time and I can’t control it!”
“Now we let it simmer for, twelve minutes, correct?”
Draco thought that he would pick up the rules as he went along, but he couldn’t wrap his head around them. He wasn’t the only one, as there were several people who were
“Why is it that you must
“I mean, you could start by just reading the instructions-”
Maybe she just didn’t want to be with him.
Everyone froze, including the upperclassmen. Most people had never even heard him speak before, let alone raise his voice.
That sick, evil, twisted, maniacal,
His hair, however, had to be magically styled. He found that no muggle product was advanced enough nor stylish enough to be of decent quality to him. He would dry it and slick it back, and every few days he would charm his roots to be a more platinum blonde rather than his usual dirty blonde. He would then change into his school robes, and at this point, the other boys would begin to stir and get ready for the day, heading down to the Great Hall for breakfast.
“Well, clearly the gene skipped over me.” Harry rolled his eyes, clearly annoyed at Draco.
His chest hurt. He could feel his body starting to sway, his head beginning to swim. Hermione was saying something to him, but she sounded underwater and he couldn’t hear a single word that she was saying. Draco closed his eyes, not that it made a difference, and tried to concentrate on her voice, how she was being gentle with him. He focused on the touch of their hands.
He wanted to run upstairs and hide and cry and cry and cry until he could cry no more.
sorry-”
He always
always whacking me with the damn pillows?” He took the pillow and hit Harry’s shoulder back.
Harry and Draco made their way through the aisle, finally settling on one of the last empty compartments. Draco waved goodbye to his parents as the train started moving, going faster and faster, leaving King's Cross far behind them.
“Ten Death Eaters just broke out of Azkaban.” He interrupted her. “
His first Christmas was especially hard. He turned to his books and found an escape. The more he threw himself into his schoolwork, the less he had to think about those around him. The only thing that mattered to Draco was himself and his grades. It paid off in the end, too. He had received the highest marks in his year. He nearly lost to Hermione Granger, but he scored one point higher on his potions final examination than her.
I hope you still enjoy!
IT HAPPENED IT HAPPENED WE'RE FINALLY THERE!! Hopefully it didn't take too long, did it? This work is already just about the same length as my longest completed work, whoops. I'm very proud of it though, I like the slow burn :)
But he didn’t. Maybe it was because Ron was right, he needed to calm down. He was too tense, too stressed from studying and from being in a hot crowded room. Maybe it was because he wanted to try it, just to know what it felt like. He had never really been reckless before in his life. Maybe he should give it a shot? Maybe it was because he didn’t want people to keep thinking he was some pathetic loser. Or maybe it was because Harry still hadn’t taken his eyes off Draco since he had come down the stairs, and he didn’t want
“Only because if we didn’t, you’d go lock yourself in the library for the rest of the term thinking we all hated you.” He said, slurring his words ever so slightly. Great, he was still a little drunk, too. Harry had a point, but Draco wasn’t going to admit it. “Merlin, Draco, we’re your
Before he knew it, he was standing at the door to the quidditch pitch, broom in hand, about to try out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
“It’s okay, mate. It’s just a dream-” Ron started to say, but Harry cut him off.
You could cut the tension in the air with a knife. It was like their heart to heart in the dorm had completely gone out the window. The three boys avoided eye contact, pretending to be interested in their waffles or a peculiar spot on the wall.
“Not really,” Harry swallowed as he shook his head. “I mean, I’m just kind of ashamed more than anything, really.”
“No, that’s alright,” he said, yawning. “Thank you.”
“Then how come you were not apologizing for punching my face? Or cornering me and nearly attacking me in the locker room? You did not seem too sorry for hurting me then.”
He sneered and grabbed it out of his hand. They set up again, Harry standing with his arms crossed behind Draco, watching them. He wasn’t going to mess up this time, not with Harry watching him. No, he was determined to finally get it right.
.” His voice cracked slightly at the end.
seen someone pull off a Wronski Feint as well as Peter Eldin! You should have
He felt hopeless. No one was going to do anything about it.
Draco really enjoyed his routine. He did not like it when things changed, he did not like it when someone disrupted his routine.
He didn’t feel safe. He felt safe hiding in the dark corners of the library and the room of requirement. Not here in the common room, where people had started to come out of their rooms to see what all of the yelling was about.
“Will you
Malfoy smirked as he moved through the common room. Yes, people were talking about him, but for once, it wasn’t negative. The praise. The admiration. He
“I am fine, thanks for asking,” he said, trying to break the silence and the tension, but the glare that he received from Hermione made him feel like that had been the wrong thing to say.
He also didn’t want to admit it, but especially ever since Potter had punched him in the nose, he was scared of him. He was especially afraid to be alone in the same room as him. It usually wasn’t a problem, since he and Weasley were usually attached at the hip, but it still occasionally happened. In the dorm, in the common room, in the locker room. There was a very strong tension between the two of them, and when they were alone it was amplified to no end. The air was thick and it was hard for him to breathe, and whenever they made eye contact he would usually run out of the room before anything happened.
He wanted to do
He found himself pacing back and forth on the seventh floor, where despite not being too crowded, the whispers were still following him. Suddenly, a door appeared to his right, and he decided it was in his best interest to duck into this mysterious room before anyone else did.
She smiled. “Oh, it was my pleasure. Arithmancy
He felt his spirits lift up, and he tried to hide his excitement as they crawled through the portrait hole to the common room. “Oh, right.”
He continued, knowing that it would just frustrate him. “Oh, there had to be

He dove at top speed, being the first to do so. He got to the ball before anyone else was even close. The second he felt the leather touch his fingertips he pulled back up, causing two chasers from the other team to collide into each other below him.
“Thanks for the reminder.”
They had finally pulled away, gasping for air. Draco’s hands were wrapped around Harry’s head, holding his forehead in place against his own, and Harry’s hands were doing the same. Draco opened his eyes to see Harry opening his, and the two of them sat there like this, staring into each other while breathing the same air until Harry broke the silence.
Draco thought back to what Hermione said.
Harry took his hand, seeming almost afraid to do so. As he did, he could hear his parents muttering about them behind his back.
He had even
He couldn’t tell from the looks on his peer’s faces, but if everyone could hear the hat, Draco would be absolutely mortified.
“Has anything like this ever happened to you before?” He shook his head. He had been nervous, or scared, before, but not to the point where he lost control. “Have you been more stressed, recently?’
It was weird for Draco. He would always walk through the halls alone, hugging the walls, paying great attention to everyone around him. He had to make sure someone wasn’t about to run into him on purpose or jump out at him with a jinx. But he found that when he walked with Hermione, it was just the two of them, and the other students seemed to disappear. They would talk about what they had just learned, or what they were expecting in their next class. Today, as they walked to the Great Hall, they complained about how much writing Snape had assigned over the weekend.
“Believe me, you could benefit from some of my help,” Draco scoffed, earning a glare from across the table. “Sorry.”
He leaned forward. “Of course I do. I know that man has done terrible, terrible things. I have heard the stories that my parents speak of behind closed doors. I do not doubt, for one second, that he has finally returned.”
“Ronald Weasley!” Hermione yelled as she finally caught up with them.
He groaned and put his head in his hands, gripping his hair as he tried to think. His head hurt from all the work he had been doing, his eyes were sore from reading his textbooks, and his stomach was growling because he had skipped dinner so that he could get it all done and still manage a good night’s sleep.
“There was
“How often does this happen? The dreams?”
He sank into the seat and immediately felt at ease. He didn’t know what this place was, or how he had come across it, but he was certain that no one else would be here. It was exactly what he had needed.
Potter sat next to him. “Draco, I’m so-”
the one who needs to learn social cues.”
“C’mon have another! On me!”
Updates are every Thursday and Sunday!
You’re so oblivious sometimes. It’s hilarious,” he chuckled as he dealt out the cards. “That was also a joke, if you didn’t catch that one.”
Granger rushed up to him. “Oh, Draco, I’m sure your nose is broken!” She cried, touching his nose, causing him to wince. “Here, let me walk you to the hospital wing.”
Opening his eyes, he saw that her face was bright red and her eyes were watery. “Can we put this behind us? You hurt me, but you had every right to be mad at me. I am sorry.”
“You should try out tomorrow!” She exclaimed. “It would be really good for you! I mean, you’ve started talking to me, and maybe it would be nice to meet other people too and-”
“It’s really not fair that you’re his favorite,” Harry said once Snape was out of their range.
He couldn’t help but notice how close they were. His heart was pounding, and he was sure that Potter could feel it. He could definitely feel how warm his torso was, how he was breathing down his neck, one arm pinned on the locker beside his head. His lips were
The voice was underwater, far away, but he managed to grasp onto it, letting it drag him out from underwater and back into reality. “Look at me, please, just look at me.”
to him, okay? Just be honest with him.”
house.” He scoffed.
He shrugged. “Maybe, like, three nights out of the week?”
“What?”
Draco was curious as to why Snape would mention his father’s letter to him. He rarely ever spoke of him, so it must have been of importance.
Hermione was waiting for him outside the Hospital Wing in the morning.
He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. He shouldn’t let his anger get the best of him. He needed to calm down. She really was becoming a good friend of his, and yes, he had every right to be angry at her, just as she had every right to be angry at him. He couldn’t let this one event destroy their relationship, and he needed to know when to back off. There were bigger things to worry about.
Draco spent the remainder of the train ride telling him all about the wizarding world and Hogwarts. From quidditch to classes to Aurors and Ministers, he explained it all. The silent wall that surrounded the boy had begun to fall and was replaced with a bond between the two boys. A bond of friendship.
But he was wrong, he wasn’t the only one left in the locker room. This wouldn’t be so much of a problem if the only other person hadn’t been Harry.
The halls were loud. The common room was even louder. And for whatever reason, Draco thought Pince might have been kidnapped, because the library was the loudest. Everywhere he went, the whispers, the names, followed him. This was
Thanks so much for reading! I will see all you lovely people again on Thursday :)
Even Draco was scared of her.
“It’s not that simple!” He raised his voice, frustrated. “If it were that simple, I could ignore my fears and just go running at him. But I can’t do that. If I were with him, I would leave him vulnerable, I would give Voldemort this perfect opportunity to-” his voice broke off. He couldn’t even say it.
“Whatever happened to
“I would not dislike him so much if he did not make it a point to sneer at me every chance he gets. What is his problem with me, anyway?”
about it. I don’t know why, and it’s not your fault, and I hated you for absolutely no reason at all and I am
Harry didn’t say anything in response. Normally, Draco would push on, but he felt like he was walking on eggshells around Harry. Draco had expected Harry to blow up at him the second that Draco came down the stairs, but he didn’t, and Draco was going to try to hold onto this gentleness for as long as he could.
Draco hadn’t necessarily gone overboard, but it was enough for him to let down his guard. He wasn’t jumping away and revolting at every touch of human skin, he didn’t feel claustrophobic in the crowd anymore, and his signature scowl had been replaced on his face by a slight smirk.
There's finally some interaction between Draco and Harry, and there will be much, much more coming up.
,” he whispered to Draco and Harry.
•─────⋅☾ ☽⋅─────•
He was on his way over to the dormitory, about to go up the stairs, when a group of boys came barreling down.
She huffed as if she had been told this a million times before. “Divination is just arbitrary guesses and made-up tales. Arithmancy takes a
“Ron, I think it’s time you ought to go to bed,” Hermione said gently, trying to get him off the couch and away from Draco. Ron argued with her, but eventually gave in, miraculously standing up.
“You should really go to the party tonight.”
“Why would I care about that?” Draco’s heart skipped a beat.
“I always have wanted to, but I don’t know. It has been a while, I don’t know if it would still look good.”
Draco swore as his wand flew out of his hand, yet again, flying further this time.
Draco pulled back sooner than he would have liked, his heart beating so fast that he could hear it in his ears. He was almost afraid to open his eyes, but he did, to see Harry gazing intently back at him, his eyes dark, his lips still slightly parted and his cheeks flushed.
there. I had to.”
“Listen to me, you’re okay, alright?” The voice was soft, so much different than the angry one that was yelling at him before. The voice was calm and smooth, gentle like the rolling of soft waves across the sea. Draco felt a hand rest on his jawline, the fingers warm against his cold skin. “I need you to take a deep breath, okay? I’m going to count to ten while you take a deep breath, can you do that for me?”
“Why are you being so difficult?” Harry demanded, but the rest of his words began to fade and Draco couldn’t hear what he was saying.
been talking to me all night, Potter.”
“He seemed fine when he got off the train,” she remarked. “I’ll have to ask him at dinner.” Draco nodded and tried to not pay attention to Potter, but he couldn’t help it. Potter seemed to calm down as he began talking to another student in the carriage. Everything clicked when Draco realized he was talking to Lovegood, and he had probably just seen the thestrals for the first time. Draco had never seen them himself, though they’re mentioned briefly in
“‘Mione!”
He scanned the crowd, his eyes landing on Granger. His heart jumped a little.
“I never said you didn’t!” She said, raising her hands defensively as Pince shushed them again. “I’m just saying that he has a soft spot for you.”
“Ron,” Neville started.
an idiot!” Harry laughed, and Draco had laughed alongside him.
“That feels nice.” He hummed. His eyes were closed and he seemed relaxed. Draco smiled.
Harry didn’t lift his head as he stabbed at his food with his fork. “No, I don’t. Not really.” He said.
even when you’ve fallen fifty feet off a broomstick?”
“You need to calm down, mate. C’mon. Jus’ a swig won’t hurt, right?”
Draco did feel bad for him, as Hermione was definitely singling him out. Sure, the rest of them really weren’t as bad, but they sort of were in the same boat.
“So, Hermione, we’ve been noticing you’ve been hanging out with… with
“That does not change the fact that you said it! What, were you ashamed of me? Did you not want Saint Potter to know that you were befriending the Quidditch-stealing enemy, huh? Did you not want the castle to know you were befriending a Malfoy? A blood-traitor? A pathetic excuse for a-”
His parents were going to kill him.
“Why do you care? I thought you said you didn’t give a shit about my love life?” Harry snapped.
“Wait,” he breathed, “I, I’ve actually been meaning to talk to you. Without anyone else around.”
Draco tried to shove him off. “I do not know what your problem is, can you just let me-”
“Are you really fucking
His gaze fell as he stared at his feet, mumbling something under his breath, but something Draco assumed to be along the lines of “I want it to be.”
It wasn’t the first time this had happened, but it was the first night in a while. They used to happen almost every single night during the first week of classes, Ron always talking Harry back down until he was able to sleep again. Then, abruptly, they had stopped. But had they really?
“Save it, Malfoy. I’m not the one who needs to hear it.”
of all of this stupid fighting. And for what? I’m sick of it. I’ve spent my time hating you, and you’ve spent your time hating me, and I think we’ve both had enough of it.”

“What-”
“And you wonder why Snape dislikes you Gryffindors so much.” He handed her back the parchment. “You need to cut it down, it should be fourteen inches
She cautiously stepped out from the stairway leading to the girls’ dormitory, as if every step she took would break the floorboards in half. “I, uh-” she trailed off, obviously nervous.
If the rest of Gryffindor wasn’t listening in on their conversation, they were now.
your type?”
“Are you sure? Do you need me to remind you who was not present at tryouts today?”
“You shouldn’t say that stuff about yourself.” Her voice was turning soft, trying to calm him down.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just give him some time, Draco,” she whispered. “He just needs a minute or two to get comfortable.”
“It is two in the morning. I did not think anyone else was awake.” He stated, trying very hard not to stumble over his words.
they had created a side game where everyone drinks once when Draco figures out something about the game, and twice if Draco thinks he figured something out but he’s wrong.
Draco lifted his head from out of his potions textbook and stared into his godfather’s black eyes, trying and failing to read his blank expression.
Harry didn’t respond.
The houses flashed past the windows, the countryside soon coming into view. Draco couldn't help but let a grin spread across his face. Honestly, it was a relief to be on his own. Outside the walls of The Manor. Without his father breathing down his neck every two seconds, watching his every move, he could finally be himself.
He straightened his posture, mostly moving backward from shock. “You-
After their afternoon classes, which on Fridays consisted of Divination, Transfiguration, and Charms, Draco would start his homework in Snape’s office while he graded some papers.
“Look at me, I’m a mess. It should be you and Hermione leading it, not me.”
I shouldn’t be such a dick, either. And, um, I’m sorry for what happened last night.”
McLaggen was at the far left of the hoops, closest to him. He stared him directly in the eyes, positioning his body right at him, and threw the ball to the right-most hoop.
Harry shrugged. He moved so that he was laying down on the couch, his head in Draco’s lap. His hands found themselves playing with Harry’s hair, trying to smooth it out, but eventually giving up and just let himself run his fingers through his hair.
“Go on, Harry, tell him.” She said. What a pleasant conversation this was.
Draco liked being invisible. He didn’t care what others thought about him, but he just preferred if they didn’t think of him at all.
Draco felt like he couldn’t breathe. When did the common room get so small?
But she even said that she only wanted to be friends with him because Potter and Weasley were too much. But now the three of them were getting along just fine again, so why did she need him?
“Malfoy, Draco.”
Draco laughed as he nudged Harry back. “Shut up.”
close to his, and he could
Yay, finally an update on an actual Sunday! Well, it’s almost 2 AM here, so I guess it’s technically Monday, but I’m getting better, I promise!
“Draco,” he said, “Please, I want to make things right.”
I am angry all the time and something has changed in the last year and I don’t know why but I’m just so goddamn
It hurt him to see Harry like this, and it hurt him, even more, to see him bottling it up, pushing him and Ron away. It reminded Draco too much of himself.
The night started to go along a lot quicker at that point.
“I really do enjoy my time with you. I’ve had a great time with you tonight, and I had a great time in Diagon Alley when it was the two of us just talking about Quidditch. I want to be good friends with you, I really do, but I’ve gone and made it so hard for myself to realize that and I’ve made it so hard for you to like me and I’m sorry. I’m sorry for all the emotional distress I’ve caused you along the way, and I just want it to be over. I know it just can’t simply
She continued to list every single career you need an O.W.L. in arithmancy in as they packed up and walked out of the library. He continued to nod but wasn’t really listening.
“Well, why don’t you grow it back out?”
“What do you want, Potter.” He stood up taller and crossed his arms. “Or can I just finish packing my bag in peace?”
“It’s actually a muggle phrase, you know,” he said as if everyone knew the truth. He sounded like Hermione. “People use it wrong all the time. It actually refers to how bloodshed on the battlefield creates stronger ties than your family ties.” He paused, letting the words sink in.
beyond anything Snape had done, and he was scared for his next Defense Against the Dark Arts class. He didn’t want to go anywhere near that woman. And his classmates didn’t even
“I-I, no.” Draco wished he could see Harry’s face, he was sure that he was pissed at Draco.
He continued to glare at them, locking eyes with Potter when he turned back around. His eyes pierced into his, making him feel uneasy in the stomach. Scoffing, he dramatically whipped his bed curtains shut. He cast a silencing charm on his bed, so even if they continued talking about them, he wouldn’t have to hear it.
Draco gave an awkward cough and moved away from Harry so that they were no longer pushed up against each other, now that they had more space.
“I’m sorry, that was harsh, but it’s true. I’m sorry that I ran away from you, I shouldn’t have. I know you wanted to apologize to me, and I knew that you wanted to before Harry ever spoke to you. But I, something inside of me didn’t really want to accept it. I needed some time to clear my head.”
As he made his way, he let his mind wander. Would this year be any different? Would he spend his days locked in his dormitory with the curtains drawn as the rest of his classmates had the time of their lives? Would he spend more time reading a textbook than actually holding a conversation with anyone? At least he was a prefect, so if anyone bothered him he could just give them a detention. Not that he would use that power, of course, because it would mean he’d have to deal with conflict. He didn’t care about the power, he was just thankful that he was recognized as one of the more intelligent students at Hogwarts. And at least he would pass his O.W.L.s, he was sure of that. The only class he was slightly worried about was Care of Magical Creatures, as that was the only class Hermione Granger ever beat him in, third year.
Hermione. What was Potter admitting to?
He took a deep breath and stepped onto the grass.
Draco politely clapped through the sorting ceremony, listening to bits and pieces of the conversations around him. The Weasley twins were planning some massive prank against the Slytherins, a few second years were complaining about not being able to eat yet, and Potter, Granger, and Weasley were talking about a woman named Umbridge, who he presumed to be the new professor sitting at the staff table.
“So you are
He used to think that feeling was just because of the mutual hatred that they shared, and that feeling of electricity was going to settle down once they did. But it never faded. It was still there, alive as ever, only intensifying.
They sat there in silence for a while. “I’m so sorry,” Harry finally said.
He scoffed. “That would be an understatement.”
“I had long hair when I was a kid!” He defended. “My father made me cut it all off before Hogwarts, saying that I would look more
Draco was dreading his next reaction with him. Their encounter was completely out of character for Draco, but that wasn’t it. It was the first time that he had ever attempted to be
Were people actually going to see him as something more than the disappointment who wallows through the halls? Were people going to actually see him as a Malfoy, as a man of respect, of a man to be admired and praised and feared?
“I just said you weren’t my type!” He argued.
But all along the walls and all over the couches were couples pressed
time. It’s been
Harry’s lips were soft against his own. It was gentle and slow, and even though it only lasted a mere few seconds, Draco had felt that time had stopped.
So sorry for the mini hiatus there! The end of the semester was really rough for me, and I just didn't have the time or the mental capacity to work on this. But I'm back! This chapter is a bit longer than my usual, and I'm really proud of it, so I hope you enjoy it!
gay? No, he shook that thought out of his mind very quickly. “Well, you guys are kinda making it into one.”
Harry sighed contently and moved so that he was sitting next to Draco, putting his arm around Draco’s shoulders as they sat there and stared at the opposite wall of lockers. Draco instinctively placed his head on Harry’s shoulder as his hand loosened its grip on his shirt.
Two years ago, Sirius Black was the first person to ever break out, and now there are
about you for the first thirty minutes!
Draco had never been in a crowd like this before. There was someone pushed up against him on all sides. How were there even this many Gryffindor students, let alone upperclassmen? Soon he realized that it wasn’t just the Gryffindors that were in the common room, but there were Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, and even a few Slytherins.
The redhead coughed as he shared a nervous glance with Potter. “Well, people have been noticing it. They’re starting to, you know,
Boom, title drop! Shoutout to renee for telling me what the full quote was, otherwise this scene (and the whole damn title) would’ve made no sense at all. I’ve updated the description now too, so that it all makes sense haha.
Quidditch team?” He laughed again, trying to ignore the growing pit in his stomach. “Last time I checked Angelina Johnson was the captain, you are just the seeker who steps to the side and watches for 90% of the game.”
it. He sat in the armchair by the fireplace, opening his book. He soaked it all in. The words circulating through the common room warmed his body more than the fire did.
Hermione led them right to him, taking a seat next to Harry, leaving him to sit across from them, next to Weasley.
Draco finally mustered out a few heartless words.“I do not know why you care so much.”
He was worried about the other members of Gryffindor, which proved to be stupid. Back in the common room, they might whisper behind his back or send him looks, but out here on the pitch, they were only concerned about Quidditch, about making their team the best they can be so that they can beat Slytherin in November. It seemed too far away to be bothered, as it was almost a month and a half until the match, but they needed all the time they could get. They were rusty from not practicing together over the summer. They still had to adapt the new members to fit their team dynamic. Plus, with schoolwork only piling up more and more, they would get fewer and fewer practices in as the school year went on.
“Really?” He snapped, tensing up. “Are you sure about that?”
Harry let out a snort. “You? You know how to braid hair?”
And they kissed again.
“Hermione, I really want to-”
” he lowered his voice, gesturing over to Umbridge’s seat at the staff table. “I feel like it is second year all over again, and I feel like I am not safe at Hogwarts.”
” She finished.
“I just want to make sure you’re okay.” His voice was a soft whisper.
The portrait door slammed shut behind him. He stormed immediately to his room, thankful to find it empty. Without even taking his shoes off, he threw himself onto his bed, drawing the curtains shut and casting a silencing charm around himself.
He heard Granger screaming from the stands, as well as the applause from a few others. His teammates flew to him, congratulating him. His body filled with pride, a Malfoy smirk creeping onto his face.
“Don’t lie to yourself,
“I said just drop it!” He realized he had raised his voice and the entire class was staring at him. The dropping feeling in his stomach from last night had returned. The voices started back up again, and they knew they were all murmuring about him again. This was worse than before, as it wasn’t just Gryffindors. No, this was the class they shared with Slytherin, so now the story of last night’s outburst was spreading through the houses and around the castle. As if the Slytherins didn’t already think he was a blood traitor.
And so he did.
“What?” Draco pulled his head back, placing his fingers under Harry’s jaw, tilting it upwards. “Harry, look at me. You have
“It is okay,” he said, smiling. “You did not know how I was going to react like that, and you wanted to talk about our friendship. I get that.”
“I have heard you say it yourself! Just because you had a spot last year does not mean you get to keep it.”
Realization crossed Potter’s face. “Oh, I guess when you put it like that,”
Today was Friday, which meant he began the day with Double Potions followed by Care for Magical Creatures, then lunch.
Draco sneered at the frightened look on his face.
Draco put down his quill and smirked. “I mean, sort of. We mostly just work together for school, but she is nice to be around too.”
Don’t you just follow a recipe?”
He didn’t know what to say. He was at a loss for words.
Draco sneered. “What a bloody stupid name, that is.
“Oh shit, here we go,” Harry muttered under his breath.
Draco laughed. He found the entire concept absolutely
She placed a hand on his shoulder. “Take a deep breath. Can you do that for me?”
No, of course not.
Draco chuckled. “First of all, I’m hurt. Second of all, I don’t know if I’d still be able to do it, it’s been a while since I’ve practiced. In order to master Occlumency you have to completely shut down your emotions and not bite back at
“Potter also looks awfully ill, doesn’t he?” Draco asked Granger when they started moving. It was true, he had turned a sickly white and seemed even paler than his friend. He kept taking double-takes at the empty space in front of the carriage, as if he didn’t ride the same one every single year.
A round of applause ensued, and Professor McGonagall gave him a smile as she removed the hat from his head. He looked over to the Slytherin table, a scowl on almost every face. Blaise Zabini, whom he learned to play quidditch with, refused to look at him. Pansy Parkinson, whose mother had many dinner parties with his mother, was giving him a look that he was sure would kill him.
“Ron, leave him alone, he doesn’t want to.”
That probably explained why his face was wet. He wasn’t crying, he was underwater. That had to be it.
“I know, I know.” Draco cut her off. “I must have had something horrible before getting on the train, I spent the whole ride in the lavatory. I am feeling better now, though. Perhaps it was just motion sickness.”
He walked over to the signup table. It was mad chaos, people were screaming frantically, pushing and shoving in a large crowd around the table. Angelina Johnson was waving her arms, a clipboard in one hand, trying to get the seemingly deaf first and second years in order.
“At least tell us
he thought,
He nodded, not realizing how tired he was.
Draco was sitting in the common room, trying to calm down from what had just happened.
think that’s how it works?”
Draco was happy to be there.
His mother rested a hand on Potter’s shoulder. In a hushed whisper, she said, “now, dear. Do you see that brick wall between platforms nine and ten? Yes, well, you simply will just walk through that very wall. Do not be afraid now, it will not hurt one bit. Draco will go first, and you will follow behind. Ready?”
She opened her mouth and immediately closed it, like she couldn’t find the right words to say. Draco imagined that she was going through every possible excuse she could make up in her mind, realizing that he wasn’t going to fall for any of them. “It just feels like you’re avoiding something. Or
Draco cleared his throat. “Uh, nothing. Nothing.”
“You didn’t even try to know! She’s been trying to talk to you for a
way I was going to be able to get all of this done if I had gone to the Great Hall,” he argued as Pince shot a glare their way and told them to be quiet.
Harry sighed before continuing. “I thought about what you had said. And you are right, maybe all we need is time. But we’ve
said that our relationship was ‘
He felt his cheeks grow hot as he glared at his fellow housemates. He clenched his fists and his jaw, feeling his eyes ready to pop out of his head.
“It’s never just a dream,” he mumbled, kicking the blankets off his feet. Before any of them could even think of something to say, Harry was slamming the dormitory door shut behind him as he stormed out.
“You know I am not an idiot, Hermione. You are the only one who actually understands me being in the library at every waking hour, so what do you want? Why do you suddenly think I should take a break? You know how important my schoolwork and grades are to me.”
“Hey,” Draco said, his voice soft as he placed one of his hands on top of Harry’s. “
“Busy doing what?” She asked. “I know you’ve already done everything that is due tomorrow.”

“Yeah, uh, Hermione kinda made me. I lost her though, I don’t know where she has gone off to.” He was glad he had found Neville, and from the looks of it, it seemed like he was staying sober, so at least he could

Of course, everyone skips over that chapter, so there is always some poor student who comes to Hogwarts after a particularly traumatizing summer and freaks out upon seeing them. And that student was Potter.

approach to predictions. Besides, it’s not just about telling the future. It has applications in cryptology, curse-breaking…”
“Stop,” he cut him off harshly. “Don’t do that. You don’t even like me that much-”
“Oh, you should play your Jack now, right?” Draco said as he watched over Harry’s shoulder, his chin just barely an inch from Harry’s neck.
He must’ve swum too deep, because everything softly faded to black.
“Your Godfather?
Draco continued. "Besides, I think without you around, one day I’ll have a panic attack and believe I am going to die so hard that I actually die. I need you.”
At some point, everyone had thrown in their cards and given up on the game. Draco was leaning back on the couch, relaxed, while Ron and Harry were in an intense debate over something about Quidditch, probably about how Ron’s favorite team was absolute horse shit.
He hesitated. He
And it is one of the few ways that can be used for good or evil. You could be the most brilliant potion master and have the option to help start a war or save one. It holds so much power, and just, I don’t know I’m just rambling now. Sorry.”
He scolded the hat.
“You admit that I have
Harry looked up from his plate and stared him dead in the eyes, making something not sit right inside of him.
See you all on Sunday!
“So now you’re running away because you’re scared.”
Draco simply shrugged and went back to being ignored.
The next chapter is my absolute FAVORITE, It’s been in my head since I first thought through the idea for this story, so I’m really excited to finish it and to have you guys read it. This chapter is a very close second favorite, though!
“I mean, that’s just one person-”
Harry must have said something to her once he stormed out of the door. She was Harry’s friend too, and Draco didn’t want to lose her, and he didn’t want her to have to pick a side. She didn’t deserve to get dragged into his mess, everything was Draco’s fault. But he was sure that Harry had spoken to her because she would not stop staring at Draco intently as they ate breakfast the next morning.
“How do I stop it from happening again?” He cut her off. He couldn’t imagine what would happen if something like that had happened during something important, like an exam, or something that could put him in danger, like in the middle of a Quidditch game.
Yes. That had to be it.
A flutter of butterflies erupted in Draco’s stomach, and he felt like he was going to be sick. He tried to push past Harry, to move his arm out of his way, but he wouldn’t budge.
with Hermione for wanting to be friends with Draco. Why would a sane person even
deflect serious conversations?” Harry narrowed his eyes despite the smile crawling onto his face. “And besides, you’re the one who keeps circling the conversation back to your good looks-”
“Perhaps I am mistaken, but I couldn’t help but notice that you have made a friend this week.”
The party had died down, the other houses slowly retreating to their respectable common rooms as the Gryffindors made their way into their dormitories. All the people playing cards had left, and although there were still a few people milling around the common room with faint music still playing in the background, Harry and Draco were the only ones left in front of the fireplace.
“Eight o’clock. Library. Don’t be late.”
He didn’t realize how much he really loved flying. The way the wind rustled through and messed up his hair was exhilarating. The ground was a hundred feet below him, and the thought of plummeting promptly to his death made him feel oddly better. It pumped adrenaline into his veins and made him realize that some things were just too insignificant to be bothered with. He could leave all his troubles and worries on the ground, he could leave his problems in the castle, on the ground, and distance himself from them by being up in the air.
“- but I can’t believe I’m in a house with
And he could’ve sworn that the seventh year Ravenclaw boy had been looking at Draco the same way that Draco had been looking at him.
“What’s your point here, Potter?”
A small smile crept onto Draco’s face. The fact that she was obviously stressed that she was so late and the multitude of arithmancy books she had brought clearly showed that she really wanted to help him.

“Merlin, Harry’s the one with the savior complex, okay? We don’t need you piling onto that too.” When Draco didn’t say anything in response, she continued in a defeated voice. “Look, Harry’s my friend too. I don’t want to see either of you getting hurt, and I think you’re being absolutely ridiculous right now. Why would you do this? You remember what a mess everything was when you tried to withdraw yourself from me. You’re leaving him completely in the dark and honestly, you’re just being a dick. Just

“Let me stir the potion,” he demanded, and she nodded, stepping aside from the cauldron. He stirred the potion three times counterclockwise, as the blackboard said, and then once clockwise and one more time counterclockwise. Granger nearly had a stroke.
Draco zoned out during the feast, not even listening to any of the speeches that were given. He picked at his food, his mind empty, until it was time to lead the first years to the common room with the other prefects.
“I told you, you’re not going to leave until I get an explanation as to why you’re doing this! I don’t even need an apology, even though I fucking deserve one. I just want you to tell me what’s going on,
He pushed himself away from the center of the room. Maybe that would help.
“Rude.”
What do you guys think of the length of this chapter? I’ve been aiming for longer chapters lately, but this one is almost twice as long as my usual ones. I didn’t want to split it into two, but at the same time I’m not sure if it was too long. Is it okay? Should I go a little shorter, or even longer? Please let me know!
“You’re right. C’mon, I’m sure she’s waiting for us.”
He chuckled. “That I am, I will freshen up after I eat.”
Right. Hermione.
wanted to be your friend, and then you just stomped all over her!”
Percy Weasley, one of the Gryffindor prefects, came up behind Draco. “Malfoy, I think you need to calm-”
“You said you also loved your broomstick?” He poked his head up and nodded. “Why haven’t you ever tried out for quidditch?”
He didn’t know why it upset him, it just did. “Well, I am sorry. And I am sorry for bullying you. It was a dick move on my part, I was a righteous little brat.”
“I think I’m going to sit out and jus’ watch on this one, actually,” Draco slurred when Ron had asked Draco if he wanted another cup. He didn’t like how he was beginning to lose control over the words that came out of his mouth, and he didn’t like the way his head was beginning to spin.
“Merlin, take a joke,” he smiled playfully, continuing to tease him. “And somehow
true!” He stuttered as he shouted, pressing him further against the wall. Draco’s breathing hitched when Potter’s body was pressed up against his, a knot forming in his chest when they collided. He was so close that he could feel his heavy breaths, his heart pounding against his own. It took everything in him to not let his composure fall.
“Did you know you are the first person born into the Potter line who is not a pureblood?”
” Draco winced when Harry used his last name, feeling a sharp sting in his stomach. “You saw what happened to Hermione when you did this to her. And your relationship with her wasn’t even
Thursday nights, along with Sunday nights, were always the busiest of the week. Why was it that every single professor just
He began to calm down, letting his shoulders drop and his body relax. His robe slipped down his shoulders, and even in the dark, Draco could still see the bruises peaking out on his back. Once they got to the feast and sat down at the Gryffindor table, Draco could clearly see more bruises on his wrist, a busted lip, and dark circles under his eyes.
He wasn’t worried in the slightest. He would be sorted into Slytherin, the same as his entire family preceding him. With a smirk on his face, he felt the weight of the hat placed on his head. His smirk fell, however, when the hat remained silent.
He didn’t know why he had done a lot of things, lately. He didn’t know why he had blown up at the first-year who called Granger a mudblood. He didn’t know why he was so concerned with Potter’s bruises and scars. He didn’t know why he helped Granger, why he asked her for help, or why he was beginning to open up to her. He didn’t know why she continued to associate with him, but he didn’t mind. Maybe having a friend would be a nice change.
“You know nothing about me, nothing about my
He had honestly forgotten that tonight was Halloween. He really did, but he wasn’t going to tell Hermione that, as he didn’t think that she would believe him.
Draco had wanted Harry in his arms, but not like this.
She sighed, giving him a light hug before helping Ron across the common room.
He wasn’t exactly sure what he didn’t know, which just frustrated him. “Well, I was just really behind during class yesterday. I was able to catch up a bit and it made more sense today, but I just did not really grasp the main concepts in either class.”
“You didn’t let me explain myself! Every time I tried to approach you, you ran away with a tail between your legs! You can’t just retreat into some shell and distance yourself from everyone every time you encounter a slight inconvenience, Draco!”
“I will leave you a bottle of dreamless sleep on your nightstand, if you feel that you should need it,” she said, grabbing the box and standing up.
Happy Sunday everyone! This is my longest chapter per date (it's really not even that long, but still), and I'm really proud of it. I hope you all enjoy!
problems. Hermione already gets mad at me for pushing my problems away, I do not think she can handle the both of us doing that.”
“I think this is yours,” he turned around to see Harry smirking at him, Draco’s wand in his outstretched hand.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” She defended.
She had instantly flung herself at him, wrapping her arms tightly around him. “Oh, Draco, I’m so glad you’re okay. I’m so,
He would usually spend extra time in the shower so that he had some time to be alone and relax under the running water. He let his mind water as he stood there, letting the water just simply fall over him, not caring that his hair was in his eyes. Draco also liked spending the extra time because it usually meant he was one of the last ones in the locker room. He was able to change and take care of his hair without feeling like there were a million eyes watching him every second.
She huffed and crossed her arms.
Of course he didn’t know how to get to the platform, the boy was probably a mudblood.
was what he wanted to say. But for whatever reason, the words didn’t leave his mouth. He shut his book gently, motioning for her to give him the essay. She gave him the parchment as if she was afraid her hand would burn if she dared touch him.
Too much had happened. Too fast. Why couldn’t he go back to the way things were? Why couldn’t he go back to being a nobody, away from all the drama, away from all these problems?
She gave him a quizzical look, then scoffed. “Oh, alright then,” and the two of them headed to the prefect’s carriage in silence. Draco didn’t mind Granger, she was always friendly enough towards him, even after she thought he was the one who sent the basilisk out to kill the muggle-born students their second year. He also had some respect for her, she was the only one who could keep up with him in school.

Draco moaned at the brush of Harry’s tongue against his lips, and he let Harry in with ease, his mind practically exploding with overwhelm. Harry’s lips tasted sweet, like chocolate with a hint of mint, and Draco wanted to chase it and kiss Harry like his life depended on it until he couldn’t breathe anymore.
He raised an eyebrow in return. “So it’s true? The great Draco Malfoy has finally made a friend?”
“Oh, you have no idea! You weren’t even there. Do you know how many people tried out for your spot? How many people would

Draco smiled back. “Hi.”
Draco whipped his head around at the group of first years who had just crawled through the portrait hole. “Who said that?” He yelled.
Draco just shook his head and chuckled. He didn’t find the particular situation very humorous, but it was funny, almost in a maniacal way. “You’re ridiculous. I am not scared of you, I am scared of,

They spent the next two hours pouring over every book that she had brought. He ended up with two feet of parchment worth of notes, diagrams, and frustrated scribbles. By the time they had to leave for curfew, he felt as if he could take his O.W.L. right now and not fail miserably.
lately.” Weasley said, his voice dripping with disgust as Draco’s name left his mouth.
He forced his eyes up, which had been previously glued to his feet. He was fully prepared to berate whomever he had bumped into, even though it was his fault. But when he locked eyes with the person, his voice turned soft. “Oh, sorry, Harry.”
Draco couldn’t remember what she had said, as he was already drifting off by the time she began to walk away.
He let the wind flow through his ungelled hair, through his fingertips, around his body.
up. That would make Potter just loathe him. The previous night, he had simply told her to meet him in the library, yet he hadn’t specified where exactly to meet. He ended up reserving a private study room in the back of the library for them to study together. If they had sat together, in the middle of the library, he couldn’t imagine the stares and whispers they’d get. He thought back to how Potter had reacted when they were seen together in the Gryffindor common room. About how the whole school blew up in rumors following Draco’s outburst on the first-year student. If people saw them together, again, for the
“I wish your hair were longer,” he admitted, “I kinda really want to braid it.”
“No, sir.”
He paused, refusing to look at Draco. He knew he hit it spot on. “I mean, it’s just that you were so
“Of course it doesn’t, you know that,” he softened his voice. It really didn’t matter to him,
“How are you not yelling at me right now?” Draco said. “Two minutes ago you were screaming in my face.”
want to end up like that. He was perfectly content with sitting back and watching the world happen around him. He tried to pick up the rules of the game, but every time he thought he understood, something would happen that would ruin all understanding that he had.
“Well-” Harry started.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek as a billion thoughts raced through his head all at once. Why were they being so supportive? They were making it into a bigger deal than it needed to be, really. Was one of
“I am relaxed!” He growled.
“I am just doing it again, they still weren’t great-”
His nostrils flared. “Are you kidding me?
I know you scored higher than me on our exam last term. But this is just everything that I had read over the summer-”
Draco instinctively wrapped his other arm around him as Harry’s fists grabbed Draco’s t-shirt. He buried his face in Draco’s chest with a sob. His cries were audible now, and Draco felt his shirt grow wet where Harry’s face was. He rubbed Harry’s arm with one hand and made small circles with the thumb of the other in an attempt to soothe him.
Suddenly, Draco’s mentality snapped. That’s
He paused, taking a deep breath after working himself up. Draco wanted to say something in return, but every time he went to say something, the words would slip out of his mind.
Harry sat up straight, causing Draco to let go but still keeping an arm around his shoulders. He shook his head. “No, I want people to talk about it. People refuse to even say his name, and, it’s like he never even existed. He was our classmate, and now he’s
She took a cautious step back. “I was just wondering if you would help me go over my potions essay?” He turned his head so he was actually facing her, raising an eyebrow. In all of the four years they had been at school together, they had always been the top of their class. She had never approached him for help, he didn’t think that she would need to approach
But for now, enjoy! <3
It wasn’t as bad as he thought. He didn’t gag or spit it out. He felt the warmth in his throat, the magic of the firewhiskey spreading through him.
“Why? What’s the matter with you?” Potter nearly interrupted her, and Draco couldn’t help but roll his eyes. It was mostly for dramatic effect in case they looked over, so that they knew he was listening. But he didn’t want them to see how Potter’s comment actually panged his chest. Of course there had to be something

been meaning to talk to him, about if he was feeling the same things Draco was starting to, but he didn’t think he was ready for that conversation quite yet. Maybe it was just a fluke. Maybe the butterflies and caught breaths would go away, and bringing it up would be a mistake. “Unless you really want to talk to him,” he added.
Without another word he grabbed his book and his back and stormed out of the room. He had already moved his belongings in his trunk to his common room and changed into his school robes earlier this morning. He made sure he gave his prefect badge a little polish before checking his watch, when he realized he only had twenty minutes to make it to the Hogsmeade station before the rest of the students would be here. If he didn’t make it in time, he wouldn’t catch the carriages with the rest of the students and someone might put two and two together and realize Draco Malfoy had really been at Hogwarts all summer. He broke into a light jog, trying not to stumble over any rocks on the path as he left the castle.
But as he stepped into the Great Hall, he was sitting right there. He made eye contact with Draco the second that he had walked through the doors, his eyes expressing a brief moment of concern before looking away, almost like he was embarrassed.
The essay normally wouldn’t be so bad, but he rushed to finish his first draft before Quidditch practice at the end of last week, so he really had to scrap it and start all over. He had worked on it since then, but it still just wasn’t tight.

Draco almost burst out laughing. It was the scrawny boy from the robe shop last week, the same one who was hanging around that big

way? Really?”
Harry only laughed.
Draco felt heat rise to his cheeks as he whispered “oh.” Harry giggled beside him, Draco feeling his body move with his laughs against him.
She scratched the bag of her neck. “I, uh, got a little sidetracked.”
Weasley scoffed. “Like a true Malfoy.”
“Yeah, whatever happened to
“He- he’s just been on edge since we’ve gotten back. It kinda does seem like everyone is against him, since no one believes him.”
But part of him really didn’t want to be up all night doing homework.
“But It’s really not, I’m sor-”
Ron threw an arm around Draco and shook his shoulder. “But look! He’s

He awkwardly stared at his feet. “I guess.”

Draco couldn’t help but laugh. “I’m sorry, you
“What are you-”
“But he really does, Draco. He told me about everything that happened last night, in the dorm room.”
It was weird that they had agreed to be on a first name basis while there was still so much tension between them. And Weasley basically didn’t exist in his world.
He had spent the majority of his first year hiding in the library. He had no one to talk to, no one to turn to. After being shunned from his family and the entirety of the Slytherin house, he grew cold and sinister. Potter had tried to talk to him, and every time he had done so, Draco just snapped in return. He had been part of why he ended up where he did, and Draco refuses to believe that might not be true.
He yelled, sending himself into another uncontrollable fit of laughter. He could’ve sworn that he heard Harry briefly chuckle beside him.
Hermione reached out and slammed the book closed again, almost catching his fingers in between the pages.
“What? No, no one actually plays that. Other than first years,” one of the Hufflepuff girls scoffed.
“I see,” she nodded. “Fifth year is often one of the more stressful years for students-”
His legs carried him without thinking, briskly moving towards the Gryffindor common room. He kept his head down, the same way he was used to all these years, unapologetically pushing past anyone who got in his way.
He scoffed and moved closer to Draco. “Yeah, that’s what you want, peace.”
Harry had opened his eyes and was staring at Draco’s face. His eyes looked different without his glasses. Draco felt that the glasses hid them away from the world, that they were so much brighter than he had thought. So much greener than he had though. Green had always been his favorite color.
“Sorry,” Draco had to catch his breath when Harry looked back up at him. He would never get tired of looking into his eyes.
He was currently on one of the couches in front of the fireplace, one of the few spots that wasn’t too crowded but wasn’t occupied by a bunch of overly horny teenagers. He was on the couch between Ron and Harry, surrounded by the rest of the fifth year Gryffindor boys, the Weasley twins, and a few Hufflepuff girls. He tried to ignore what felt like electricity on his right arm, the side Harry was on.
After a few weeks of trying to talk to him, he eventually gave up. Everyone had thought Potter was a fool for trying to befriend Draco Malfoy, and they were definitely right. No one would ever be friends with him, he wouldn’t dare let anyone get close enough to him. Why put yourself in a position of emotional vulnerability to someone? Nothing good would ever come from it. At best, he would have a feeling of brief happiness. At worst, the same thing would happen all over again, everyone would betray him and hurt him.
He should say something. Anything. But before he could string any words together, Harry had placed his hands on both sides of Draco’s face, pulling him down to continue where they had left off, Draco meeting him halfway.
He suddenly cherished the fact that he was sitting there with Harry in his arms. Draco tightened his grip around Harry’s shoulders, never wanting to let go.
He bumped into someone at the bottom of the stairs. “Oi, watch where you’re going!” He heard the voice call at him.
“Fine. One hour.”
progress at all. And this is the situation I’m supposed to be using it for, and it’s like I haven’t had a single lesson!”
“I can’t,” Draco choked out. He couldn’t look at Harry or else his chest would explode and his heart was going to collapse and he was going to die. “I can’t.”
me with, with whatever muggle curse that you picked up that landed me in this house!”
“You would not have to explain yourself if you never said that to begin with! Just because you said it behind my back, does not change the fact that you were badmouthing me to your friends.” She remained silent, and he raised his voice, feeling the betrayal bubbling and rising inside of him, bubbling and rising after he had pushed it down inside of him for a week and a half. “Why did you say it, to begin with?” He felt the anger bubbling, rising inside of him.
He felt stick to his stomach, his hands were sweaty, and he could not stop his knee from bouncing up and down. He had seen her in class earlier today, but hadn’t seen her at dinner. Maybe she got sick between class and now, and was laying in a bed in the Hospital Wing, hurt and-
in Harry’s mind. I do not know what that means, and
“So where did you want to start?” He was thankful that she had cut him off, as he didn’t particularly want to have a conversation about his feelings with
“Can you look around and tell me three things that you see?”
She rolled her eyes. “You bloody Gryffindors. Always insisting that you are just
He scoffed. “Of you? Yeah, right.”
She gasped. “You- you do?”
He felt like his head was going to explode. He was noticing every little thing around him. The fire was too hot, too bright. Hermione’s voice was too loud. His hands were shaking, sweating, his heart pounding too fast. Everything was too much.
He thought of their Defense Against the Dark Arts class, of how Potter had snapped at their Professor. It’s not like Draco didn’t agree with what he said to her, but he couldn’t help but cringe at his outburst. Potter, our savior, just
get in on all the good drama. Now I get the chance to hear it from the source? Spill!”
“But, how did you know to do that?” She asked.
“Harry, wake up. It’s just a dream, Harry,” he repeated over and over again, in a low voice. He wanted to jolt him awake, to get him out of whatever horror he was currently stuck in. He wanted nothing more to get the pained expression off his face, but he knew that startling him was not a good idea.
She was here. Staring him in the eyes. Not running away, not turning around some corner, not hiding from him.

Draco’s heart sank.
my grades in that class-”
“You don’t,” Weasley trailed off, “you don’t
“What rumors?” Harry interrupted Ron as he abruptly lifted his head up. “What have people been saying?”
He shrugged. “I do not see why not. Everyone else says it, so I should just accept that, right?”
But Po-
Draco didn’t think she had done it on purpose. One minute he was standing right next to her, and the next she was gone. It wasn’t her fault, she probably turned around to say hi to someone while some else had slipped in between them, separating them and pushing them into opposite directions of the crowd.
He never had any reason to. He didn’t play Quidditch before, so it wasn’t like he was falling out of the sky. He kept to himself, never getting into any fights, and he never had to have a visit after an accident in potions or charms because he simply never messed up enough for something severe to happen.
He decided it was probably best to keep it on him at all times, in case there was an emergency. But what counted as an emergency? He had only ever had something like this happened to him just this one time, but he was pretty sure that losing consciousness counted as an emergency. But how would he know if he was going to pass out? How did he know if he was having a panic attack or just general anxiety? Pomfrey had explained it to him, but he didn’t quite fully understand it. What if this was just something his brain was making up, and he was faking it and being a big drama queen over nothing?
“`Mhm, and you think about what looks good on me all the time, it seems?” Draco smirked. He could do this.
“Where the hell is he.”
Hermione took the seat next to him and gently placed her hand on his elbow, snapping him out of his mind and into reality. “Just talk to me, okay? What’s going on?”
