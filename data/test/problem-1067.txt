"I've joined a matchmaking service." He didn't beat around the bush.
“I’d have to think about it.” He settled on, images of new research programmes already swirling in his head. As department head he’d have influence on the BOH, and with Moreschi at his side as CMO and Aadhya in trauma he could really affect some change in the profession.
"Breakfast?" he asked, raising it a little.
"You're not what I expected," Griffith said after a stretch of silence.
The question surprised Harry, and he stopped to think about it for a long moment without finding a satisfactory answer, "Do I?"
He opened the envelope and quickly scanned the paper inside, as expected it was about his operation on Potter.
“I’m just glad I didn’t have to deal with the unspeakables. They had to go out and obliviate half of London. Muggle law enforcement got involved. It was a whole mess.” Seamus mentioned, chuckling as he shook his head.
"We all testified under Veritaserum, and the scrutiny on our testimony was rightly scrupulous. It was a fair and unbiased proceeding, as much as you would have liked it to be otherwise. It was what we needed to close that chapter of wizarding history," she insisted, as if that
and she isn’t even mentioned by name. That’s tragic.” She snapped the prophet shut. “And now we’re under siege from reporters trying to get a piece of you, mr Potter. Do you have any idea how disruptive that is to our job?”
"A lady doesn't kiss and tell."
“Oh, no… I didn’t mean to imply… it’s just an honour to meet you in person, that’s all.” The man replied, stumbling through an apology.
Harry stared at the blank spot under Draco's finger, unable to process what he was saying. He
Sure he paid a lot of attention to him all through school, but he’d been right, he was up to something most of the time so it was completely justified.
“You’ll tell me when you do.” It wasn’t meant as a question and Harry didn’t take it as such. He didn’t question how easily he took Malfoy’s orders, it just was more comfortable than fighting him every step of the way. Maybe he liked when Malfoy looked at him with approval instead of disdain. “Do you want to try for yourself or do you need to see it one more time?” he asked.
He twisted quickly to tip Harry over on his back, more towards the middle of the bed. Harry let out a surprised
Harry's birthday comes and goes
“I can’t treat him while he’s this open to external influence, messing with volatile potions,” Malfoy argued. He set the notepad aside and crossed his arms, his back straight and his chin raised. There was an entirely different energy to their confrontation now. Malfoy wasn't going to be moved by any insistence coming from Ron, not when it came to putting any patient in danger, not when it came to putting
“Reporters. You featured on the front page of the
This is a soft one.
"How long and where exactly would you be going?"
“Very well. As it stands, Healer Malfoy, you have knowingly employed a procedure expressly forbidden by the Order of Healers, performing a tap into the magical core of Auror Potter. That without obtaining informed consent from the patient or the next of kin. You also failed to ensure you had the proper supporting equipe during the procedure.” He listed off his sins.
“You should stay and have tea since you’re not working.” Teddy tried again.
“You didn’t tell me you had another tattoo,” Harry mentioned, reaching out tentatively to trace the outline of the iris. Draco was immensely grateful that was the thing he focused on instead of the scars.
Draco knocked back the whisky and refilled his glass.
"Good job, Rosie," Ron commented before going back to the kitchen to finish making dinner while Harry examined her handywork.
“Am I, though? Because the way he looks at me, Blaise, the fucking trust in his eyes while I lie...” Draco’s voice cracked. “I want to be the man he thinks I am, but I can’t.”
"You're worried I'm not taking this seriously enough, that I'm, Merlin forbid, enjoying some part of it instead of just suffering for the cause. Let me reassure your sanctimonious soul, Potter. Unlike someone else’s,
Harry had his doubts, but it was undeniable that now they could get all the expert support they would need, and they did sow the seed of education reform.
“Then trust that things will work themselves out when the moment comes. Harry could do a lot worse than you. Isn’t it every mother’s dream? Your child to get hitched to a doctor?”
He got to the hospital with a clear plan and he got there early for his shift, early enough to get his plan derailed by Brown coming to him begging for help with an issue with the Potions lab. Apparently, there wasn’t enough stock of what her supervisor needed for the day’s procedures and she didn’t know how to fix it.
Malfoy, you need to learn how to fix your own mess. This is why we're here."
Harry had spent the morning being poked and prodded by strangers, making him feel like he needed a shower to get the feeling of weird stuff out of his skin, they’d poured at least three different potions all over him and vanishing spells didn’t take away the unpleasant slimy sensation. Usually he would jump at the chance to stop the process and maybe charm his way out of it entirely, but now that it was just him and Malfoy he found he didn’t mind the idea too much, he could deal with Malfoy’s cool hands on him. He’d always been gentle and he never lingered too much, leaving just the ghost of his fingers on his skin.
Harry could feel tears well in his eyes. "Taranjit," he whispered, his tongue caressing the syllables like a comfort food he'd forgotten the taste of. He wasn't alone. "You have three children."
He needed to get in contact with Finnigan to go over Potter’s missions to see what kind of spells, rituals and wild energies he’d been exposed to that might have staid dormant until now, and he needed to consult with an expert on magical residue handling. That would be Healer Bonhomme ideally, if he was lucky enough to get him to spare a minute for him.
"Screw you, Malfoy," he muttered before backing out the room and pulling the door behind himself. It didn't even give him the satisfaction to slam shut; damn Cushioning Charms in the frame.
He leaned against the railing once they all loaded onto the boat and closed his eyes to enjoy the sweet wind on his face and the spray of salty water on his lips. For a moment, before they docked in Mumbai proper, Harry had no responsibilities, and he could fully enjoy the exhilaration of being back in his home country. It still wasn't Punjab, but maybe, between then and June, he could find a day or two to get off duty and fly out to Amritsar, see the Golden Temple, visit his family's graves…
They left their clothes in a sad wet pile in the corner of the changing rooms and thanked Merlin for the warm robes. The oversized tub was steaming hot, and the room smelled of citrus, sandalwood and cardamom. The sweet scent of plumeria and flowers curled up from the water, dotted with blooms. Draco didn't waste any time before shedding his robe and lowering himself in the water, shivering as it warmed him through. He leaned back against the side and closed his eyes, breathing in the heady scents surrounding him.
Ana-iliad was back at my side for this one.
Hanson walked in not too long after, bringing him breakfast and the latest news. Lately, Fashion Week was the main interest of all the news outlets, and today was no different. Apparently, someone collapsed last night on the runway, causing a commotion.
As Blaise got ready to leave he stopped in front of the fireplace and turned to Harry.
Harry blinked awake, the bland colour of his hospital room coming into focus as the laboratory disappeared around him like morning mist evaporating under the sun.
She was good. Offering the position to him would greatly benefit the Hospital’s public image. Giving the department to the man who cleared out the illegal trafficking was probably the one way they could restore even a little bit of dignity for the institute in the public eye.
“Ginevra,” Malfoy retorted, amused by his floundering.
“Don’t worry about it, I love the little rascals.” Harry grinned, tickling Rose with his good hand. “‘Mione’s been complaining about your extra hours, were you down at the office this morning too?” he asked, unable to resist the temptation to ask.
“I have to go back to work, not all of us get extended vacations just for dying a little,” Draco replied, standing up and straightening his uniform.
“No, sorry, I’m on my way out, I have to drop these at the ministry.” Ron waved a notebook Harry knew to be full of interview notes, “but I’ll try to come back around lunch so we can chat.” He gave him a quick careful hug before heading out.
"Yeah, about as well as expected." Granger smiled sheepishly.
“It’s Muggle,” he realized. Malfoy nodded.
It didn’t take long to reduce Harry into incoherence, once Draco truly put his mind and tongue to the task. He listened to the litany of curses and moans falling freely and generously from Harry’s mouth, and when he felt Harry was a breath away from shooting his load, he pulled back, eliciting the most satisfying desperate little sob from Harry.
“It’s not just a tattoo, this one is magical. It has a temperature control spell embedded into it, combined with the ones Pansy puts in my clothes, it prevents me from having to constantly cast it myself or straight up hibernate in winter,” Draco explained, watching the fascination in Harry’s eyes as he studied it.
Harry hummed and got comfortable sitting against a smooth section of the wall.
“Can I read what’s inside?” Teddy asked.
He was somewhat surprised to find Malfoy actually waiting for him in the foyer, looking clean and put together. For all intents and purposes, he was the poster image for a distinguished western tourist… Which he was, at least for tonight.
"You're an asshole," Pansy huffed, shoving his shoulder. "But no, I know better than to try and convince you to do something you don’t want to.”
"Good enough isn't enough, we need to give them the best chance, and that's you."
"Sorry, just… thinking. You'll stay up on the summit for Holi, then?"
"Harry asked me for leave to go to Amritsar to celebrate Vaisakhi. You're going with him. You leave next week and you'll make a stop for me to check on the Jawhar community. We've lost contact with the local activists working there and I want to know what's going on. You have three weeks; it should give you more than enough time to do everything."
They were sat in a comfortable booth and Draco let Taranjit order for them. He pulled out an envelope from his pocket and discreetly resized it before setting it on the table. As soon as the steaming tea was brought to them Draco decided it was time to start explaining.
“He’s got a direct line to the man making the supply, he’s got to be in touch with whoever’s running the operation. Harry can be our man in the inside,” Ron explained.
I know some of you are suckers for the very important step of calling each other by first name, don't lie to me, I see you.
"It's… a personal matter," he tried to avoid the question.
"Why didn't you use it to cure the people out there?" Harry tried not to stare at the way Malfoy’s neck bobbed as he drank.
"Officially 1962, but Hermione thinks it must be later, judging by the size of the community and the pattern of 'unexplained phenomena' reported in the area by Muggles. The local Ministry of Magic is still trying to track down all the isolated enclaves and the old British records aren't necessarily reliable."
“Looks like it” Malfoy agreed.
“Why? Where are you going?”
The two newcomers wore the chartreuse he’d learned was the colour of trainees, his curiosity was immediately piqued but before he could ask Malfoy about it or the floating tray filled with a strange assortment of instruments one of them rushed forward.
Draco nodded and reached out to shake Harry’s hand, a cool dry palm against Harry’s own, feeling like a new beginning.
you were the one to make this a real thing. You coming into my DMs was what made me realize this would truly affect people, maybe just one or two, in a meaningful way. You changed the game and for that I couldn’t be more grateful.
“A kiss, you say...” Draco pushed Harry back against the bedroom door, hovering just a breath away from his lips, delighting in the tension that simmered in that moment, ready to spark a fire between them. Then he leaned in and kissed Harry’s cheek, drinking in the frustrated whine he got from the man. He slotted a thigh between Harry’s legs, effectively pinning him against the door before leaning down to brush his lips against Harry’s ear.
“Do you really think he was delighted when I informed I’d be his healer?” Draco shot back. It wasn’t that hard to say no to Potter, people just didn’t want to, which in turn gave the man leeway to do whatever he well damn pleased.
“Potter lies!” Draco snapped. “You know it, I know it. Do you think you can find another Healer with the specific competence and willingness to call out the Saviour of the Fucking World on his bullshit? Someone who’s going to put his recovery ahead of his momentary happiness or that wouldn’t be tempted to just try to make him like them? Because I’m not convinced there’s an abundance of those in London.” He stopped and sighed, looking Weasley in the eyes, feeling his heart beating fast in his chest, the silence stretching between them for a long second. “I won’t let any harm come to him, I’ll brew his potions myself if need be,” Draco insisted. He needed Weasley to understand that moving Harry was a step in the wrong direction, that he would keep him safe no matter the cost. The fight seemed to leave Weasley’s shoulders, but he still argued, trying to poke holes in his plan.
“Maybe, but I need you to walk me through your dreams first, starting with the latest ones,” he replied, pulling out his notebook.
“Yeah, it’s Malfoy.” Harry started.
More freckles were dotting Draco’s nose than he remembered, and Harry could have counted and catalogued each one in the centuries it took for Draco to lean down and close the distance between them to finally kiss him again.
There was always someone in his room and Hermione made sure to stay until dinner. Healer Dana and she made quite the pair discussing his treatment and each new development while Malfoy quietly fumed in a corner, jotting down notes as if they’d personally offended his mother. If one ignored the constant monitoring and experimentation, Harry wasn't doing so bad; a little bored maybe, sometimes the potions they tested him with had unpredictable reactions, but they were more on the fun, whimsical end of the scale rather than the gruesome, painful one.
The flicker of hope for something besides work that sparked in Draco's chest in that moment was quickly squashed the following morning.
“Welcome back to the land of the living, Auror Potter.” A cool somewhat familiar voice greeted him. Something inside him was pushing him to recognize the drawl of the man speaking to him. He squinted a little to put the mint green robe into focus, looking up at the face framed by platinum blonde hair escaped from a neat ponytail.
“It’s not going to hurt me either,” he assured, reaching out for Harry’s hand and placing his palm over his hip bone, covering the red feathers. “It’s just a tattoo right now. Barely even magical.”
“A house elf only speaks the truth!” Blaise grinned at the remark.
Harry dragged his hand up, through the nest of blond curls, to rest low on Draco’s belly as he placed a gentle kiss on his shoulder, listening to his breath gradually even out. The breeze from the window cooled down the sweat on their bodies and, as they lay together, sprawled naked on a massive bed with the afternoon sun making the warm tones that much more vivid, it sunk in how big Draco’s actions were.
“A house elf only speaks the truth.” Soup replied, the impassibility of his wrinkly face betrayed by the twitch of his big ears, letting on the concealed amusement.
“Come… in?” He asked
Share the love in the comments.
It was absolutely impossible.
Granger stood out in her cream anarkali suit, the golden details drawing out the amber hues of her skin. As he scanned the room, he spotted Miss Rana, once again in green, with silver brooches pinned to her hijab and her jacket, and Healer Gupta, standing tall among a group of strangers, with her hair gathered in a relaxed updo instead of her usual stern plait. And then his eyes fell on Potter, looking delectable in a black ensemble with gold detail, doing his best not to engage in any inane conversation no doubt going on in the room.
"Make it big enough—"
"Mozart, the magic flute, my pick of arias." She replied, straightening up with a smile as the first lilting notes of papageno's aria filled the air.
“That was unpleasant.” He commented, shifting a little to try and get a better sense of his body.
By the time the end of his shift rolled around Draco was well past drained. He’d reached drained five hours prior, when he operated on Potter. He dragged himself home in a daze, thanking hell and heaven that Mother insisted when Soup offered to come live with him. There was food ready for him on the table when he got in, courtesy of the house elf, but it didn’t prevent him from faceplanting in his bed right after eating and falling asleep still in his robes.
“I know it feels weird.” Draco mentioned. He placed his hand on Potter’s arm, rubbing a little to dispel the sensation of blood being extracted. “Better?” He asked, giving him a little squeeze before pulling away.
“I want to try, I always learned better by doing anyway,” Harry replied. He probably couldn’t take another trip inside Malfoy’s mind after what he just saw.
“It was before, right as I was working. In his defence, it was done under torture, you know intense physical pain, one does and says stupid things...”
Of course, Murphy would be out, and Draco seriously doubted he was actually dealing with the emergency. Draco flipped the book open and slowly slid his finger down the column of ingredients, checking the regular shipments and the amounts, nothing out of the ordinary… except they couldn’t possibly be accurate, there was too much coming in and no stock to show for it. Even imagining that the department was in the hands of a moron who couldn’t tell his hands from his arse and was a wasteful brewer (which Draco was convinced to be the case ever since Andrews handed over the reins to Murphy) it still wouldn’t explain the inconsistencies. His finger stopped at
"They'd still be too far for Floo connection and they don't use owls," Malfoy pointed out.
“I’m well aware, Potter. There are a lot of things that
“I’m fine, go ahead, let’s get to the end of your list.” He replied, twisting his head to glance up at it and see just how many tests were still to be done.
“That’s incredible, Auror Potter, you must have such a great arrest record, being in the field so much.” He commented with a wide smile, looking at Harry adoringly.
"The people's magic is wild and untrained," Healer Gupta said. "Their doshas are not in balance, and their magic hurts them and those around them."
"We can always go back next year," Malfoy pointed out, as if there was no question they would be back in India next April, like him following Harry to religious celebrations he had only a vague understanding of was the most natural thing in the world.
Come over to
The silence stretched between them, the only things disturbing the stillness of the room was the dripping of water, drop by drop, from the tip of the stalactite, and the buzzing of the cursed artefact from inside the Containment Spell.
“You look like you have some news,” Malfoy commented. “Finally feeling good enough to venture outside your room?” He gave Harry a small smile, he looked pleased with the development.
"Ah, training with the professionals, I see. Soon you'll be leaving me in the dust." Malfoy was joking around with his godson and Harry started to think he might be hallucinating this one.
“Hey, Draco!”
"It's nothing, and you can't do anything about it while holding the ceiling up."
Granger hummed. "I think he will try to be civil at least for a while and I would like you to do the same. I'll keep him out of your hair as much as possible but you know how he is…"
“I don’t have to,” Blaise replied with a soft hum. “Draco, you’re my brother, I want to,” he told him softly, getting a vague sound of assent from Draco. He wasn’t sure he was going to remember this talk at all in the morning, but what was important was that he knew it now.
“To you?” Harry asked sceptically.
"I've been thinking about it ever since we went to Gharapuri Island. It's not the land connecting everything, it's the water; the rivers run across India carrying life from the mountains to the ocean. My father had these mirrors, a pair, made and polished together, that he used to speak with Sirius when they were away from each other."
Meeting Healer Gupta did wonders to smooth animosity, she emanated an aura of quiet power that Draco could appreciate. She spoke calmly, picking her words carefully, aided by the young woman sitting to her right. Her intervention was needed less and less as the conversation turned more technical. The deeper Draco's questions probed into her style of healing practises the easier Healer Gupta’s words flowed in a warm accented English that made the conversation that much more pleasant.
“Everything is fine, Potter.” Draco told him, trying to sound as comforting as he possibly could. He rearranged the tools on the tray and pushed it aside. “There were developments of my intervention on you that we didn’t account for,” he explained “but now we know and we’ll take care of it. We can fix your chest and then let you sleep.” He promised, hoping it would be enough to reassure him.
“Do you? Want it, I mean. I thought you liked being a Healer.”
Draco walked out of the room without a second of hesitation, a strange feeling of detachment from his body as he took one precise step after the other, the robes billowing behind him, the only thing that felt real was the clinking of the chains on his vest.
Draco’s smile widened minutely. “You gave me a pretty good idea of it, actually,” he replied, trailing his fingers up Harry’s arm.
“I’m perfectly capable of running the last tests by myself, mr Bingley, your presence is required elsewhere.” Malfoy reminded him coldly. “I doubt Healer Andrews will accept your need to fawn over Auror Potter as sufficient cause to miss his seminars.” He added, gesturing to the door and stepping aside, a clear invitation to leave, in case his gritted teeth and the waves of displeasure he was emitting weren’t evident enough.
"Look out!"
"That's a wonderful idea, but maybe we should ask your mum and dad."
“Relax, Potter,” he murmured, his thumb slowly tracing Harry’s bottom lip. “Get comfortable, we’ll be here for a while.”
"You will love living in Kolkata, Hari, I still miss it," Aunty Priya said, nostalgia tinging her eyes.
Hermione thanked the man when he placed two tall glasses in front of them dripping with condensation.
"What have you done to me, Potter?"
“I used to have another scar there,” Harry mentioned when Draco’s lips lingered in the middle of his chest.
"I feel so objectified right now," Draco sighed. "But I reckon you can live without my input. I did nothing more than mend some minor injuries, anyone can do that."
favourite between Draco and Harry. Harry insisted he was the one since he was the Godfather, had a room just for him at his house, and bought him his first broom. Draco argued in turn that they were actual blood relatives and he introduced him to his celebrity crush. Soup won the debate pointing out he provided sandwiches and safety from that kind of nonsense. Teddy was too polite to admit Soup was right, but Harry and Draco both knew the truth as it was spoken.
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise’s smile dropped. “Oh, Draco,” He murmured, “Why?”
“I’ve always cared about appropriate,” Malfoy argued, a slight twitch of his lip gave Harry a spark of hope, he was playing, wasn’t he? Harry just needed to figure out the rules.
“Get naked.” The way Harry froze for a second with his lips parted made Draco’s grin turn predatory. “You
“That won’t be necessary, he’s already under the care of Healer Dana.” He informed them “She’s already involved, no need to change his primary Healer again.” He could tell Andrews wasn’t happy about it, but there wasn’t much he could do, they’d already established Dana as above reprimand, so they had no reason to push her out.
Draco hummed. “I will adjust them anyway, you might be developing a sensitivity to them,” he decided, better safe than sorry. Before exploring anything else he wanted to go with the simplest solution.
"You're not making it very easy on me," Harry commented. Finally, Malfoy took his eyes off the view and looked at him with an amused glint in his eyes and the tiniest hint of a smile. He’d cut his hair since the last time Harry’d seen him. It was again short at the back, a utilitarian cut that didn’t sacrifice the length on top that made Harry wonder whether it was as soft as it looked.
“Come on, you’ve always had this weird thing for him that no one really understood.” Seamus shrugged.
"I have."
“Good. Do you need a bit more of a break?” Malfoy asked, his voice softening a bit “The next bit isn’t going to be too pleasant.” He warned him.
Draco held back when they were joined by the rest of the delegation in the elevator. There was another Healer that came along from St Mungo's, an old Charms teacher, specialised in "exotic" magical practices, and one other Auror forming the bare necessary security detail for any journey abroad with an ambassador of England. All of them were quite happy to let Draco pretend they didn't exist and return the favour. Not Granger, though. She was dead set on making him bond with everyone as soon as possible, which was probably a good idea for the successful completion of the mission, but Draco was still lagging after the Portkey jump and entrenched in a defensive position, which wasn't the best for making friends.
It wasn’t like there was nothing to do in the Manor, but there was only so much he could play by himself and sometimes he just wanted to be with other kids. Meeting Albus had been like a dream come true. Maybe, he hoped, Harry could move into the Manor so then he could see Albus, James, and Lily -and even Teddy- all the time.
While Harry was trying to find his footing in this surreal new world he found himself in he came to a realization that steadied him. Despite the differences between his and Draco’s marriages and the abandonment of their wives, there was one way in which their circumstances were completely the same. They loved their kinds unendingly and they children were now theirs entirely.
"I really don't know all that much." Scorpius shrugged as they all sat around on the floor of his playroom. "I don't know how I can help you."
Draco quirked an eyebrow at that. "You wouldn't mind if one of your kids got Sorted into Slytherin?"
"Mm." Draco smiled and leaned forward to place a tired satisfied kiss on Harry's lips. "I love you," he whispered against his mouth, gray eyes regarding him nervously.
"Snakes!" Lily burst out unable to contain herself any longer. "Can we look at the snakes?"
"Grandfather!" Scorpius squeaked in equal parts surprise and trepidation.
Pulling himself together, Lucius inclined his head politely. "That's quite alright, Minister. Nothing was done that couldn't be remedied."
Harry frowned and was about to ask what he meant, but Lucius's study door opened to reveal the man himself waiting for them.
"Whatever, you prat." Harry rolled his eyes and turned on his side to face him. "Thanks for letting us stay, Draco."
Draco clapped his hands and smirked. "Wonderful. Now that everyone is introduced, Albus, why don't you show Scorpius your room?" He reached for Lily snagging her under the arms and before Harry could even think of protesting lifted her away.
Harry had the very surreal experience of watching his shy and often times withdrawn son blush with pleasure and grab the other little boy up in a tight hug.
Harry struggled to hide his own amusement and failed. "Sorry, love. I forgot to warn you. When it’s done toasting it pops the item up so you can pull them out."
"You're -well versed- in the Dark Arts?" Harry hedged phrasing the fact like a question.
The inside of the shop looked much like the outside; tidy, cheerful, and a bit mysterious. The place smelled earthy and spicy and welcoming, like cookies and vanilla and cinnamon. Harry looked around to see a whole wall devoted to potions for all sorts of things from skinned knees to aphrodisiacs. The opposite wall was taken up by packaged baked goods that must have been the source of the heavenly smell.
"Perhaps, you had better stick to Mr. Malfoy," he suggested aprehensivly.
When he got close enough to the floo room to hear the children's excited chattering he sped up his pace. Opening the door he smiled brightly as the children screamed their greetings at him.
"That's a very nice name," Draco said. "My name's Draco."
After trading tense, awkward introductions, they seated themselves in the wing backed chairs in front of Lucius’s desk. He pulled out all the pertinent papers and documents and various other things, before looking up at his two guests his expression impenetrably business like.
"He did inherit his fascination with everything murderous and morbid from her, didn't he?" Draco commented wryly as he poured himself another cup of tea and stirred in a spoonful of sugar.
Harry grinned at that amusing imagery. He couldn't see Lord Lucius Malfoy wrapped around anyone's finger, but he supposed if it was possible it was going to be the old bastard's grandson that did it.
A concerned frown creased at Narcissa’s delicate brow. Andromeda stiffened as tension between the couple rose. “Why would the Minister ask for a meeting, Lucius? We’ve done everything they’ve asked of us.”
Fighting the urge to bristle, Draco just nodded to her and turned to catch his son's eye. "Scorpius, you remember Grand-mère. Come and greet her," he instructed stiffly.
Harry chuckled over Draco's annoyed exclamation of, "Mother!"
"Alright," Harry sighed as he lifted Lily into his arms prepared to floo home to Grimmauld Place. He couldn't help, but feel reluctant to leave as well. "Say goodnight."
James smiled back and stepped into the room, closing the door behind him. "Hey. What happened today?" James asked, brow furrowed in concern.
"No, I like Grandpa-Lucius," dear sweet manipulative Lily chimed in with a bright grin. "’Cause when Daddy and Draco get married and have babies, you'll really be our grandpa."
"He didn't really have much of a choice," Scorpius told them. "Voldemort threatened to kill them if they didn't follow along. He tortured and taunted them even then." He paused again to gather his thoughts.
Teddy had been trying to learn Parseltongue with Scorpius and could understand maybe every third word. He wasn't anywhere near fluent, but he could get the general gist of what his snakes were saying.
His mind was turning that over until an echo of his grandmother saying those things about Miss Cissy and Mr. Malfoy made him scowl. He'd known that Narcissa and his grandmother knew each other, had guessed that much at least, but he hadn't even considered that they'd be sisters. Why didn't they like each other anymore? Why did his grandmother hate her family so much?
Chuckling, Draco shook his head. "Whatever, Potter. I know you read it for its scintillating magical creature column."
"You can call me, Draco, now," the man said with an amused smirk. "Wouldn’t want to get confused with my Father."
, about this. He'd actually taken it upon himself to rectify this invasion of privacy.
He just scrunched his nose again and shook his head at him. "That's okay. You can keep it. I've got lots. My dad had them made for me last Christmas," he said with a small smile.
"Yes, Miss Lily?" she returned pleasantly setting her tea down to give all her attention on the little girl standing next to her.
Draco grinned at him. "Your dad just stopped moving and stared at the snake. The whole room was stunned silent. Then Lockhart, the bloody great idiot, steps up and claims he can get rid of it." Draco snorted. "Instead of banishing the thing he kicked it up ten feet in the air, so when it landed hard with a thump it came up hissing and spitting and madder than ever."
"Belle!" she exclaimed shrilly, slapping her hands to her cheeks in dramatic fashion when she was sure her daddy was looking. "I told you, you couldn't come with us! Where are you going?! Come back!"
Hermione leaned back in her chair, crossed her arms and gave him
"I do." Harry nodded, pushing away from the wall and stepping toward him ’til their chests were almost touching. "I want you to stay very much, Draco," he whispered.
A stealth crossover with
A whisper of sadness rose inside her, but it was alleviated by the thought of Harry once again being happy. "That's wonderful, dear. I'm happy for you. Have you known her long?"
"Thank you, Frilly." Narcissa took a steadying breath as they both began heading toward the West wing.
"You know," Draco drawled in that tone of voice the always meant a little bit of trouble, "Father is really good with money. You should let him invest for you. He'd make you twice as rich three times as fast."
Harry wondered if Albus knew he had a string of spaghetti in his hair. He sure wasn't going to tell him if he didn't.
It was pleasant, Harry thought with a small smile as he twirled a forkful of spaghetti. Hermione had cooked her mother’s recipe and the kids were busy making tomato sauced messes of themselves giggling insanely the whole time.
Truthfully, he’d known the moment he’d spotted her on the beach. Standing up he brushed sand off his butt, and looked down at her. She hadn’t moved an inch since he’d sat down. She didn’t move now, either.
Quite the opposite. Lucius squeezed his cane so hard the wood creaked making several of the other men in the lift edge away from him cautiously.
"Since its founding," Harry answered. "I gave Fred and George Weasley the money to start the business and in return they made me a third owner." Lucius's clinched jaw looked painful.
Lucius didn't seem to mind his rudeness, simply chuckling darkly as he followed the younger man through the seemingly endless rows and piles of old magical things.
It always amazed him how his children could be completely oblivious to the adoring, awed stares that followed him everywhere he went. Rose and Hugo were oblivious too, so he guessed it just came with the territory of having famous, war hero parents.
Harry felt a smidge guilty for unintentionally keeping this all from her. "Draco and I are... seeing each other," he said in a mumble.
Lucius just rolled his eyes, ignoring the confused and wary looks from Molly and Arthur. "Narcissa, either the children risk getting sliced to bits and poisoned or they risk scraping their knees on the gravel if they fall. You can't have neither, so pick one."
It was true. When Harry had knocked on his door for dinner he'd ignored him and gone without. Reminded of that now, though, he was kinda hungry and wished he hadn't skipped it.
He took a deep breath of that scent he was growing to crave and Draco knew had to tell Harry now, while they were on the subject or he might never tell him.
” Lily explained.
Harry brings his kids into previously enemy territory. Only to reconnect with his eldest son and get reacquainted with his oldest foe.
on the lesser known Diagon side street of Ampersand Alley.
Draco murmured, "Oh."
There was some disbelief and exclamations of frustration, but sure enough, after nearly all of the remaining guestrooms were checked, they found all the furniture covered in white drop-cloths levitating above shiny, wet, freshly waxed floors.
"Yes, Draco." Harry looked into his bright gray eyes. "I would love to think about having children with you." He leaned in once more and captured Draco’s lips open mouthed and hot.
"Say goodnight, love. It's time to leave," Draco instructed.
"Are you sure?" Scorpius asked with pleading eyes. "Because I really want Albus's cousins to like me."
"Ah, Harry." Mowgli smiled at him as he neared and held the cage up to show him. "I have brought her. Right on time, I think," he said gesturing toward the half eaten chameleon cake.
"Well," the little girl began nervously. "Me and Belle were talking the other night and she said that if Daddy and Draco fell in love then they would -um- mate and Draco would be our mum and Scorpius would be our brother."
They made it to the bed eventually and curled up together mostly sated and mostly naked. They weren't quite ready to take that last full step in their intimacy, but they didn’t hesitate to enjoy one another in other ways.
Taking a deep fortifying breath, Lucius decided to take one for the team and wade into the utter madness that was his wife's idea of party preparation.
"He is a magical animal, Mr. Potter," Lucius explained moving to stand next to him as they watched Narcissa guide James’s hand to stroke the horse’s nose. "Uncanny intelligence, greater lifespan, and often times annoying personality quirks are all to be expected with magical animals."
"Oh, yes." Cassiopeia nodded and smiled falsely. "That's right. How generous of his wife to take in another woman's child. I do assume that young Teddy's parents are dead, yes? Mrs. Potter must be a kind woman."
Narcissa came to a complete stop and did something every ounce of her aristocratic breeding would have normally screamed in hysterics at; she stared.
A funny kind of twist curled at her lips. "No, no. I'll meet you at Malfoy Manor and we can all floo over together."
Harry and James entered the stables to see Draco and another wizard apparently in charge of the stables telling the other children about the creatures in their care. The manager had pulled out a mild mannered mare letting Albus and Lily tentatively pet her while Scorpius was off on another story about something or other pertaining to that particular horse.
A strange look had crossed Narcissa's face when Draco mentioned the wife. She looked at her son then at the tea service before shaking her head again.
When Harry lifted his head again he caught sight of Scorpius crawling toward his father asking in a quiet voice, "Dad, can I have a snake, too?"
"It was my fault really," Draco continued when it seemed that Harry wasn't going to be able to finish his sentence. "I didn't make it absolutely clear what was expected of her as my wife and mother of my child before she signed the marriage contract. Father had negotiated a deal with her family and we assumed it went without saying that I expected a mother for my son not just a brood mare." He snorted self deprecatingly. "My fault."
Chuckling, Lucius just stroked his fingers over the cloth and diamonds. "Well, the Black ancestors apparently valued a complete history of their future offspring. This will even have you and your children on it, from both sides if I'm not mistaken."
"The owls have come, Master Lucius," he said in a squeaky voice, holding the tray aloft for Lucius to take the missives from it.
"Yeah!" the little boy cheered thrusting an arm into the air and bouncing on the balls of his feet.
"Oh, James." Harry reached forward and pulled his son into his arms wrapping him up tightly. The boy clutched at his shirt and buried his face into his chest. "I'm sorry, James. You shouldn't have had to go through that. I'm sorry I wasn't there. I'm sorry your mother left. I'm- I'm just sorry for everything." He felt completely lost while his stubborn, independent son cried brokenly into his chest.
"Well, for one thing, I can owl the Headmistress at Hogwarts. They have a book there that records every magical child born in the United Kingdom. If Chrysanthemum is in the book then she's definitely a witch and will be offered the chance to attend Hogwarts."
"It came to my attention sometime ago that you had been required to file a copy of every business transaction and contract you make with the Ministry," the Minister said.
"Tell me how long you’re keeping him so I can pack his bag?" Andromeda looked at Harry’s pleased grin and hoped he knew what he was doing. Trying to take on four kids at once was no small thing.
Then it was a blur, a red, and green, and blond, and black, and sunset, and garden blur. Before Draco knew it he'd been pushed and prodded and smiled at and joked with and finally seated at the garden picnic table large enough to seat thirty with room to spare, Harry on one side and George on the other. There seemed to be a pause where everyone stared at the food positively layered on the table before, suddenly, they all reached.
Harry stepped up next to Draco and wrapped a comforting arm around his waist. "Yes. Freeing a house-elf is more complicated than simply saying it. Some of these elves have served a wizarding family for generations and take pride in their duties. The elves and the wizards are bound by magic that is old and nearly unbreakable. It’s actually cruel to release a house-elf unless they wish to be free."
"So, Draco," Charles grinned at him flirtatiously. "Do you have any interest in dragons?" he practically purred.
"They need to see each other again," Lily declared as she laid her head on Teddy's shoulder. "Then they'll like each other again and fall in love and Scorpius can be our brother and Draco and Dad can have more babies to be our siblings." Her voice grew progressively higher with desperation and exhaustion and her eyes began to tear.
"It was good seeing you today, Potter," Draco said with a small smile while he walked the exhausted, but happy Potter family toward the floo. It was evening, they’d shared a light dinner, and the kids were shuffling like inferi they were so tired.
It was almost painfully apparent that Scorpius wasn't a really social child. Draco had told Harry that the little boy had problems relating to many children his age. That even sometimes the parents of the other kids in his primary classes would tell their children to avoid him because he was a Malfoy and Draco's son. It made anger burn in Harry's gut, but he tamped it down because there was nothing he could do except indulge Scorpius in as much time with his children as he wanted and make him feel welcomed and wanted.
"I know, Harry. Are you alright?" Draco asked, dropping his lips down to the top of Harry's messy head, his fingers still moving gently through his hair.
“No doubt,” Lucius nodded with slightly vindictive amusement. “That girl is going to put grays in Potter’s hair as sure as the sun rises.”
"Mother, are you alright?" Draco asked. His mother had been staring at Teddy for near twenty minutes now. He didn't think she would have a problem with him being the son of a werewolf since she’d taken to being open and accepting as a matter of course since prejudice and bigotry had gone out of fashion after the war. But he could be wrong.
Another laugh barreled out of him and Harry was feeling so much better than when they had started this. Dragging a hand through his bangs, he smiled again. "Come on, then. Let's keep looking through these books. I think I might just want to take the journals with me so I can read through them."
"How can you know?" Hermione asked not sounding accusing, but genuinely hopeless. "How can this possibly ease?"
Narcissa chuckled too, seemingly not noticing anything odd with his reply. She tilted her head toward her son. "Draco is the exact same way. I'll find him nodding off at nine thirty on the settee if I don't remind him to head up to bed."
They sat in heavy silence for a time before the sight of his boyhood rival drinking tea in his kitchen and listening to his problems finally registered and distracted him from his spiraling dark thoughts.
Instantly, Draco felt himself tense. Sensing the sudden change, Scorpius looked up at his dad in confusion.
Lucius listened to, what he was sure, was a much less insulting version of the a supposed fight that Potter had with his wife's disowned sister. Then, with much interest, he listened to the boy explain how they went searching for information on his own involvement, and that of his son's, in the war attempting to find a link between their past and Andromeda’s animosity.
"Perhaps young Mr. Potter would like to be introduced to Lightning." The drawling voice demanded their attention. Lucius stood next to them with his snake head cane in one hand his other tucked neatly behind his back.
"I won't leave, Lily," he promised with such conviction it surprised him. "I promise. You and your brothers are the most important things in my life. I wouldn't leave you for the world." It was the God’s honest truth.
Lucius didn't rise to the bait. He waved George on to continue.
Lucius hummed as he leaned forward to get a better look and tried to decipher the runes circling the staff in equidistant spaced bands. "Unfortunately, my knowledge of the Ogham alphabet is very limited so I’m not quite sure, but I think it's a magical staff. Much like the staffs wizards carried before the time when secrecy became vital for survival and wizards began crafting wands instead."
Suddenly his cousin looked so very troubled, his massive shoulders sagging under an invisible weight. "I think Chrissy is a-a- has magic," he finished worriedly.
"Harry?" Luna's whimsical voice called from the kitchen. "Harry? Did the Nargles make you deaf again?"
"So, what you're saying is that Lucius is using his retirement from being evil dark wizard minion to seek new and improved ways of earning more money," Harry summed up his words a little bit slurred. Damn, two of those minty drink things was really one too many.
"Oh, I imagine he already knows and is turning a blind eye." Draco grinned. "Besides, Harry said that his cousin wants to expose his family to the Wizarding World a bit before they go to Hogwarts. It should help with the transition."
"Yes, Master Scorpius. Shotzy knows what he is to be doing, sir," the house-elf squeaked proudly.
Harry may not know everything about the Wizarding World, but Lucius knew absolutely nothing about the Muggle World. He felt like they were on a little more even ground now.
Lucius Malfoy, for instance, wasn't just going to leave Draco and Scorpius with more gold than Midas. He was leaving them with real-estate, shares in profitable businesses, the means to support themselves with rental property and royalties and God knows what else.
Lucius made a pained sound at that and looked like he was about to throw up. This man took his money way too seriously, Harry thought.
"Thank you," Draco whispered and kissed her on the cheek before turning again and looking at Harry. "We'll go talk to her, Harry. Would you..." He gestured to the stunned guests murmuring and whispering worriedly around them.
"Potter!" Lucius choked from next to him, the magic in the air thick and nearly suffocating. "Drop it, Potter, before you kill us both!"
"What are you still doing here, Malfoy?" Harry asked bewildered. "Why do you care?"
"No. No. Just making sure." Harry stared at Draco with a look of utter amazement.
He unlocked the deadbolt and pulled the door open only to blink dumbly at the sight on his front porch.
Draco moved away from them and went to the two children standing close by just staring out at the gardens in hesitation. "Don't you want to play in the gardens with the other children?" he asked when he reached them.
Tilting to one side thrown off balance with laughter, the words were out of Harry’s mouth before could think about it. "You know, I'm one third owner of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes."
He scoffed to himself and rolled his eyes before glancing back at his
"I love you, Grandma," he murmured into her soft, comforting warmth.
He was pulled out of his thoughts by Ginny’s soft fragile voice.
"So, you can talk to snakes, but you're not a Dark wizard though," Dudley clarified a small frown of concentration on his blond brows.
Charlie asked, "You were at Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament, weren't you?"
Narcissa nodded understandingly and starting moving gracefully to her feet.
"I know." Ron sighed again. "She's gone round the bend and I can't figure out why." They sat silently for a bit. Then Ron shook head and took a deep breath visibly shoving his own problems to the back of his man. He fixed his blue eyes back on Harry desperate for a change of subject. "So, you and Malfoy then?"
“Hello, Andromeda. Won’t you sit down?” She gestured to one of the loungers facing the floor to ceiling windows. “Would you like some tea? Something cool to drink perhaps?”
Draco Malfoy looked Potter up and down and thought he’d matured well. Harried, stressed, and slightly tearstained with red headed starfish attached to his side didn’t detract from Potter’s new found attractiveness at all.
"Do you believe me, James?" he asked feeling desperate for his son to say yes. "I love you. You and your brother and sister. You're all three of you my life."
"Splendid," Lucius drawled. "Right this way, young Mr. Potter." An absent gesture with his cane pointed them in direction of the aforementioned horse.
Draco waved him off with a smirk. "Don't worry about it, kid. Just one more happy customer. Scorpius, why don't you take Albus to the backroom and stuff him with those cookies your Grandmama forced on us this morning?"
"Harry? Who is that?" Draco asked him as he bit into a wonderfully frosted bite of cake.
Molly came rushing forward practically shoving her sons out of her way to grab a surprised Draco by the cheeks and pull him into a tight hug leaving two red lipsticked kisses over his pale cheeks.
Calmly, he lowered the paper to the table causing the snake to turn and look at him with annoyed black eyes.
"What happened a month ago?" Molly ignored the implications of the timing and urged him to continue the story.
Draco and Narcissa continued on into the house and asked a few of the quieter, more discreet elves to begin a search. It wasn't long until they found her.
"Scared?" Draco scoffed. "I was bloody scared too, Harry," he shot back. "In less time than it takes a house-elf to shit, I found myself frustratingly attracted to and embarrassingly smitten with my boyhood enemy. Of course I'm going to be fucking scared out of my goddamn wits, but I'm not the one that decided avoidance was the best way to deal with that!"
"Almost," Albus muttered distractedly, his tongue peaking from between his lips as he hurriedly finished scrawling the rest of their tentative plan on the parchment. "Done!" he exclaimed in satisfaction.
It was so different from what he’d had his whole life, what Scorpius had, and they both loved it immensely.
A quick glance at the clock confirmed that it was indeed the kids' bedtime. "Of course, Lily." He smiled at her and bent to lift her into his arms.
Lucius sighed, apparently they didn't want the children to know that their game was up. "It’s quite remarkable," he finished anticlimactically as he picked up his tea and sipped at it sullenly. They always had to ruin his fun.
Slowly and more or less silently, they moved until Scorpius held up a hand signaling them to stop. He looked up the hall and down the hall before pointing at the door they'd stop by. "This is it."
Huffing in mild frustration, she called for a house-elf and ordered her tea and cakes. She would enjoy herself no matter what. She was resolved. Of course it never hurt to have a little help.
Harry cupped the sides of his face and brought him back down for another gentler kiss. "Yes," he murmured against Draco's soft lips. "It's absolutely wonderful."
James stepped forward and scuffed his shoe at the rug for a few seconds before he looked at Draco from under his auburn bangs and stuck his hand out shyly. "Thank you, Mr.- Draco," he murmured, face hopeful and apprehensive.
"I don’t know much about the creatures," he responded coolly trying to make it perfectly clear that he was not encouraging Charles’s attentions in the least.
Teddy didn't argue with that. They'd always been better at researching for stuff than him and James. Aunt Hermione was always gushing about them.
When the boy seemed to run out of words, Lucius simply sat watching the children fidget while he collected his own thoughts.
Harry was happy to see that James had come out of his uncharacteristic shell and was giggling and laughing along with the others while the ducks waddled quaking indignantly and splashed the kids with sweeps of their wings.
Harry cringed and fidgeting in his seat. "Well, when you put it like that it sounds bad." He shrugged and gave them a helpless smile. "They begged me. They wanted to practice their Parseltongue, so I figured it'd be alright to let them get pets."
"Yeah! Can he stay?" James asked, his eagerness followed up by some begging from Albus.
Lucius looked back at her and hesitated for a moment before answering. “Potter has requested that I become his financial advisor and help him make some investments to increase his estate.”
Harry's eyes almost bugged out of his head, but Draco just kept going seeming not to notice his stunned silence.
"Oi!" Ron scolded, slapping his hand away from the food. "No picking, you! She's finishing up at the office. Babbled something about Lethefolds encroaching on Centaurian territory before cutting the connection, so that's all I got on her. Should be home in a bit, though."
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see James, Albus, and Lily all tense. "Not quite yet," he replied. "It's not like I need the job, and I'm not really all that pressed for something to do. My four little hellions keep me pretty well occupied."
Harry tilted his head in negation. "You'd be surprised," he replied. "Hermione didn't take it well, but Ron seemed okay."
Draco watched her for a moment before murmuring, "I'm sorry, Hermione. I'm sorry you had to go through that."
"I prefer it, yes," Harry answered wryly.
"Oh," Albus said then hissed, “
“Yes, well,” Draco sniffed, sounding insulted. “Now, I don’t think I could stomach that many people kissing my ass at once. Brownnosers are so déclassé.” He flicked a hand through the air dismissively.
Harry groaned in answer and shifted, pressing closer, one hand splayed against Draco's lower back, the other still gripping Draco’s thigh to keep him from sliding to the floor. "Haven't had any type of sex in..." he counted silently in his head and frowned, "since after Lily was born."
"You know what I mean," Harry grumbled, pressing his face more firmly into Draco's chest inhaling his perpetually cookie flavored scent. He felt the snakes uncurl and slither down his body to the table then the floor. They were probably going to Teddy's room, Harry thought, feeling glad for their presence.
Lifting his head he caught everyone's attention just by sheer force of will and the table fell silent. Narcissa frowned in worry and placed a hand on his arm once more. "Lucius?"
Harry chuckled quietly and asked, "Do you wake up wrapped around everyone you share a bed with?"
“She’s not talked to her sister, her family in decades, Harry,” Draco reminded calmly. “Getting past disownment and years of hurt and hate will take a while.”
dozens of miles beneath the earth. All in all, it was a really good day.
"I likes yor hair," the little boy mumbled past his chubby fist.
” she answered, to which Lily just frowned and shrugged, not understanding. “
"A muggle tea, my dear? From a bag?" She lifted the lid on the tea pot to see that, sure enough, there was a soggy, tea stained teabag floating in the dark red liquid. "How very... plebeian of you."
"Ah, Harry," Mowgli greeted, his accent lending his words and intriguing lilt. "She is ready for you. Are you taking her today after all?"
James hissed something to Nova who had been stationed at the top of the stairs. After receiving an answer he looked back over his shoulder. "They're coming up the stairs to take us back home."
Scorpius wasn't naive enough to believe that his parents had loved each other when they were married, and he could tell that his dad wasn't as happy as he should be. His dad loved him, Scorpius was in no doubt about that, but his dad could be happier. Harry made him happy.
Harry decided to stay out of the way and listen. George grinned at him and followed his lead.
When Harry just grinned at her she knew she hadn't gotten the whole story yet.
"Lucius retired?" Harry asked incredulously, waving off Draco’s wordless offer of a refill. The drinks were strong and he was already on his second.
"Fuck. Thank you," Potter gasped painfully sincere. He let his hands fall away so he could look Draco in the eyes. "I'm sorry. I should have said that before. Thank you, for bringing him back. How did you find him?"
She sucked in a shuddering breath. "I was at work. I'd just found out that we were having another baby and I was so happy..." she trailed off and shuddered. "Then I felt this pain. It was- awful. I didn't even have time to make it to the bathroom before I felt it." She clasped a hand to her mouth for a moment looking almost like she was going to be sick. "I felt my baby die... in all that blood."
Watching the exchange, Harry had to suppress a shiver. He could have been watching Lucius Malfoy, Draco exuded so much cold aloofness and superiority. He couldn't even be mad at Malfoy for disciplining James himself. Harry had been trying for days to get James to drop the attitude. Draco had accomplished it in a matter of minutes.
Draco decided that he'd hold out judgment on that, but followed Harry's urging out of the kitchen and into the backyard anyway.
Besides, Lucius Malfoy was rich enough for ten people he must be doing something right. It was worth having to put up with him to listen to the man’s suggestions.
Cassiopeia looked like she'd swallowed a fly. "I beg your pardon? Grimmauld Place?" She looked shocked. "The Black ancestral home?"
Despite the years of separation and hate, she would have known her sister anywhere.
"And they call Draco, Dragon, and Scorpius, Scorpion," Lily chirped informatively.
Everyone broke into excited smiles and darted off toward the garden tables to get ready for the story.
"Yes." Draco nodded absently. "The East and South wings are the residential wings where my family and I live along with all of the guest suites. The West wing is where my father and I have our studies as well as the Malfoy Library and the greenhouses,"
His mirth effectively died. "Luna, I don't think-"
"I don't know," James answered, thoughtfully. "I don't think so, I mean they're not in Azkaban, are they?"
"Yeah. Have since the war." He shrugged again lounging in his seat stretching out his legs and crossing them at the ankle. Lucius didn’t comment on it.
"HIM?!"
Be kind and throw me a bone, just a couple of words in the comment section are going to make my day and keep me writing during these trying times.
Share your thoughts in the comment section, feed me love and that will keep me writing.
Potter gently pushed the gate open and took the three steps to get inside the cold rectangular room. The ceiling was domed, completely decorated in a stunning mosaic of a starry sky, each star in golden tiles, at first seemingly random, but soon enough Draco started recognising constellations and wondered about the dedication to detail of whoever made it.
“Are you trying to get me to go off, mr Potter?” Hanson replied, with a fire already igniting in her eyes, a grin already tugging at Harry’s lips. He didn’t even have to prompt her before she sat down to enlighten him on the fresh nonsense the press was pushing.
(See the end of the chapter for
It didn't take long at all for things to go south. Draco got one good dinner because he pointedly ignored the existence of the majority of the new members of the British delegation. He got one good night, sharing half a glass of champagne with Potter, where he told him about Hawaii, and listened in turn to him detail the celebration of Parkash Utsav Dasveh Patshah he got to attend back in London with the Patils right before they left, and then all Draco's good mood and goodwill evaporated suddenly under the harsh light of day.
"At the beginning of April. We'd stay there for three months, halfway into the monsoon season, but Hermione said she couldn't fit it any other way so we take what we can get."
As promised, the slippery rock behind the waterfall melted away at the touch of Harry's hand, revealing a narrow corridor cut into the mountain and lit by a magical glow. As they ventured deeper, the climb got steeper and the sound of the waterfall, almost deafening when they stepped in, got further and further, muffled enough that their laboured breathing filled the space, drowning it out.
“I just want to see you happy,” Blaise told him, letting Draco tuck his head under his chin. “I will set the world on fire to protect you, but I can’t protect you from yourself,” he murmured, slowly rubbing his arm.
The man nodded and stepped aside, pointing them in the right direction.
Draco walked through the busy halls of the hospital with purpose, flanked by Blaise and Pansy. The way people parted to let them through could only mean that Pansy’s work was having its intended effect. Blaise made for a fetching sight next to him, a sharp suit under formal robes that exuded power in the best way possible, power, competence, and all the self-assurance a man could have.
Warnings: Guilt, self loathing, heavy drinking and vomiting all happen in this chapter.
"Two Dutch braids please." She crawled on the carpet and settled down in front of him, her back straight. She quickly pulled her bun down and handed him a comb so he could part her hair.
impossible to forget.
Malfoy's hands were white and unmarred again, as if they hadn't been burned red just a few hours prior, but when he met Harry's gaze, they both knew he'd looked like an idiot and there was no way to hide the blush on his cheeks. No amount of tan could save him from the way he turned red and avoided Harry's eyes in favour of discussing the day's work with Hermione and Healer Gupta.
He did not expect his suite to have a little door next to the closet, or Malfoy's head to come poking out of that door not even an hour after he settled in.
“I have some inkling,” Harry replied with an amused smile. “Thanks for keeping them away,” he mentioned earnestly.
"You've got to try this."
Granger nodded.
Draco raised his hands in surrender. The line of her shoulders relaxed when he acquiesced and a smile touched her lips for a moment.
"From how Bill tells it you're quite the accomplished curse-breaker."
“Fu-uck! You really are
"The boat is already coming to get us!" someone pointed at the sizable speed boat heading towards the lighthouse.
At around three he remembered his therapist's advice to meditate and do his breathing exercises to balance himself out and maybe get some sleep before he had to deal with his smug face again.
He didn’t even get to marry her, call her his wife.
“I didn’t say I didn’t like it,” Harry mentioned. Draco raised an eyebrow, wishing he could say exactly what he was thinking, but his mouth was occupied in way more pressing matters and Harry was still too coherent for a man with his cock in Draco’s mouth.
"Miss Rana, how nice to see you again," he greeted her as he took his seat. "Ambassador." He nodded at Granger.
But now Seamus had put it in his head and he was thinking about Malfoy.
“It wasn’t your fault,” Harry offered, unable to find words of comfort to soothe the ache he only got a glimpse of. There were no words that could possibly bring relief.
They didn't. Only because the hotel staff insisted and Granger used words such as 'denser than a garden gnome' when Potter mentioned wanting to go out in the middle of a monsoon.
“No one has ever complained before, especially those in my bed in the morning.” He told him, the smooth mean edge of his voice finally familiar again. The world was right on its axis now.
“I...” Harry reached up and covered Draco’s hand, threading their fingers together. “I want you to have all the power, at least for a while,” Harry replied, pulling Draco’s arm tighter around himself. “I want… I want you to take me in hand, and set the rules of the game.” Harry breathed slowly, he knew Draco could feel his heartbeat with his lips lightly pressed against Harry’s neck and his palm against his chest, he had to know how fast Harry’s heart was beating as he prepared to speak again. “I want you to call me ‘Potter’ like you used to, like you owned that name, like you owned
"You need to cover your head," he elaborated.
"What does it look like to the uninitiated?" Draco asked, wondering if he was about to pull an emperor's new clothes kind of stunt. Not like it would make the situation much worse than it already was.
“Greedy,” Malfoy chided but his right hand was already working on the tiny buttons of his left cuff, slowly sliding them through the holes and letting it fall open.
Malfoy had to listen, he couldn’t just dismiss him out of hand. It just wasn’t how things were.
"I will make it three if need be," she assured.
“The one thing you can do is get better soon and give morale a boost, you’re sorely missed around the department.” He replied “Checkmate. You’re distracted” He commented as his pieces cheered on the board.
“She has too much power and no Master, she saved you and then you left, Harry Potter,” Soup tsked, dripping with disapproval. “No respect for this house, no wonder she’s bent out of shape.” He shook his head, glaring daggers at Harry, Draco suspected Harry was only the most recent of a list of people on Soup’s shit list for disrespecting his house.
Before any of that had a chance to happen the door opened again.
“Still…”
Come over to
“Clearly.” Draco gestured at himself.
“I just got a peek at our books and potion stock, they don’t add up, haven’t for four months, and not even Murphy is that much of an idiot. Apparently, he’s not an idiot at all since he’s been running an illegal potions ring right under our noses.”
Draco nodded. "Yes. Thank you, Granger."
“What are you researching?” Harry asked, pushing himself up to sit.
Was there a thing between him and Malfoy?
"Sure."
"Everything alright, Griffith?" Draco asked casually as he went back to work on the girl. "Tell me if you can't hold the spell up anymore, we'll get someone to step in for you."
“What about when you’re not my healer anymore?”
"I don't know, Potter, travelling through mirrors is incredibly dangerous, there is a reason we use fire instead." Malfoy sounded terribly reasonable, but Harry had thought about that too.
Aunty Priya nodded. "You're still here to celebrate Holi with us, then."
"Merlin, Potter, it's recently acquired, can you stop it? I'm not going to tour my slave camp, it's just a house for Salazar's sake, I thought we were past this!"
Draco huffed out a laugh, realising he'd just stared down the man with fully black, slightly demonic looking eyes.
"You can't cast," Harry pointed out, unnerved by Malfoy's calm indifference.
“I meant adverse reactions to stasis or painkillers,” he clarified. He was impressed with himself for keeping his voice steady.
“Yes,” Harry breathed out.
a Death Eater," Hermione corrected him, "And he paid for that. What he
Draco nodded. He still meant it, now more than ever. Whatever Harry asked, Draco would give him.
Here, have some more heartbreak, my early Christmas gift for you.
"What? Diana Damrau is exceedingly talented, and this is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written" Pansy argued, just a touch too quickly and too vehemently.
Draco sighed and ripped the envelope open with a precise flick of his wand, pulling the parchment out. His eyes scanned it quickly but his face gave nothing away as Harry waited for any kind of reaction.
“Very funny, Potter, there are other less involved ways to form a bond.” Draco replied, picking up the chart to go over previous accident reports to see if he’d been exposed to any possibly triggering rituals “Like marriage.” He mentioned.
“Fuck” It was barely a whisper, his eyes wide as he stared at Potter.
"I wanted to go there for Vaisakhi, but I'm starting to doubt we'll make it," Harry sighed, thumping his head against the rock.
Then Malfoy came in one day with a tray of potions announcing he was good for another round; they’d get the wrist done and see how he settled before making a plan to go forward.
By the time he emerged from the bathroom the smell of strong coffee was wafting out of the kitchen and Pansy was setting up his record player when he walked in the room.
"I'm aware. Have you been talking to my mother? Are you going to offer me some young virgin in marriage as well?" Draco replied.
Teddy and Andromeda ended up staying well into the afternoon, opening cards and packages until they got bored, then Harry pulled out the chessboard and Teddy was dead set on beating Harry at least once before leaving. He’d improved a lot, probably thanks to his time spent at the Ron and Hermione’s, Ron had always been a much better player than him even back in school, there wasn’t much left he could teach Teddy about chess.
"Why did you take me to a colonial monument?" he asked eventually.
By the time the sun set and Granger came to collect them Draco felt like they barely made a dent in the number of people who needed help, but Granger insisted they leave together.
Ron came in with a giggling Hugo thrown over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes and quickly cast a drying charm on Harry's nails.
Remember to leave a comment before going forward.

"I know we're going to have to hike a bit to get there," Potter mentioned. "There is a small enclave on Gharapuri but the locals are taking care of it. Healer Gupta came by in December to set up operations and we're sending some of ours along for technical support. The rest of us with you and Griffith are going north to Sanjay Gandhi National Park. A considerable part of the untraced magical practitioners retreated into the caves and settled on one of the summits. It was warded off when detectable accidents started happening more frequently back in the mid-1850s."
“You go first.” Harry grinned, throwing the challenge.
"Can you regrow lungs?" he asked.
“The residue is not decaying.” Malfoy told him.
I'm trying to add tags as I go, if I forgot to tag something sensitive please let me know and I'll fix it.
“Please?” Harry glanced at Draco over his shoulder.
Potter sat down on the floor and Summoned a bottle of water to drink. "We're starting with the library."
Harry grinned at the wide-eyed expression on Malfoy's face. "God's honest truth."
Alice, Poti, Ciulia I honestly doubt you will ever reach this point but if you do know that I love you and knowing you made me confident enough to share my story and put so much of myself in it.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean…” Harry shook his head giving him a small smile as he tried to apologize for his faux pas.
“It only collapsed the building” Malfoy repeated. “That means… There was someone there.” His eyes widened as the pieces fell together, finally fitting in a way that made sense.
“Hm?” Malfoy hummed vaguely in acknowledgement but didn’t tear his eyes away from his work. He never did.
"What do you propose we do about it?" Malfoy asked, nudging the curry closer.
Draco hummed “What about conscious direction of power to the residue?” He asked. Bonhomme grinned, nodding slowly as he thought about the question.
We all knew Astoria and baby Scorpius were dead but now we "see" it happened because of contaminated potions at the hospital and Draco was forbidden from being with them.
“I...” Draco looked at the envelope for a long moment. Too many emotions swirling in his head. Laennec was wonderful, but England was his home. And he could do so much as department head. Did he want to give St Mungo’s one more chance? What could it become under the leadership of Healer Moreschi?
“You sure know how to make a man feel special.” Potter grinned.
“Your mother’s favourite flowers. They’re daffodils, aren’t they?” Harry elaborated. Malfoy smiled and shook his head.
Are you team Drarry in deep denial or team no bullshit with Scorpius & Rose?
ok?” she asked, giving him a slightly concerned look.
"Well, this is quite dire."
“I do want to be a Healer, I can’t imagine being anything else,” he started, his thumb twisting the ring on his finger. “And being a trauma healer isn’t all that bad, but where I am now, professionally, is as far as I’m ever going to get here in London. I have a spot in France, I could be a potionist, do research… Blaise and my mother have been telling me to go ever since I trained there.”
He watched as Healer Gupta activated the tattoos on a woman's hand, guiding her through the manipulation of a small Summoned storm. At the same time, her trainees were working through the rebalancing of people's cores, alternating the use of their wands and the intricate tattoos that covered their hands and arms. There, Draco could make himself at least marginally useful. Miss Rana remained at his side, seamlessly mediating his conversation with the locals and gently teasing him when he struggled to recreate with just his wand the hybrid process the Bengali Healers employed.
"Come help, Healer Malfoy, there is much to do."
As he changed and got into bed the one thought he hung onto was

Harry left Hermione's suite and knew immediately that if he went back to his own room, he would just stew and then bite someone's head off at dinner, which would satisfy him for a moment but compromise the rest of the mission. He sighed and softly thumped his head against the door to his room before pushing back and heading down the corridor towards the elevators.
Draco sighed, setting the mug down. Soup was a clever little creature, ambushing him with cutting questions in the morning before he’d even finished his coffee “We’re not having this discussion again, Soup. I picked my battle and I’m seeing it through to the end. Sometimes my job is hard but it’s what I want.” He told him with no harshness behind his voice.
Griffith couldn't be much more than four or five years younger than Draco, but in that moment, he looked like a schoolboy caught unprepared as he tugged on his ear trying not to say something offensive.
When the door clicked open again it was a welcome distraction from the annoying itch he had on his right arm.
"Don't apologise, learn."
Harry was pretty sure it was night outside. They’d been there for several hours now and Malfoy had walked the length of the small room enough that Harry teased him about wearing down the floor.
“You wish, Potter.” Malfoy shook his head, putting the chart down “So, how was the night? Did you adjust to the new painkillers alright?” he asked
“Was he ok?” Harry asked
“How do we work around that though, we still need to get rid of the residue to operate on the patient?” Dana asked.
"Apparently it invokes a profound feeling of unease and vague unexplainable sense of existential dread." Pansy reported "That's what my apprentices tell me anyway. Now get naked and let me do my job."
Blaise sighed, wrapping an arm around Draco’s hunched shoulders.
At least he had a chessboard now. He picked up the white queen and placed it on the board, the rest of the pieces sorting themselves out on their own. He made a mental note to ask Ron for updates on the operation when he and Hermione next came to visit. Maybe they could play a little, it had been ages since they had a good game.
The spot of carpet between the couch and the coffee table in Ron’s living room had probably taken the shape of Harry’s behind with the time he spent sitting there while Rose played with his hair, his face and now, his nails. Harry held his hands out, fingers separated as he rested them on the coffee table so Rose could paint them purple. She’d decreed he needed to look extra fancy for his birthday, hence the beauty treatment.
So this is the end… Time for me to get sappy and you all to endure it.
He decided to stop by his office to send a quick note to Soup asking him to bring over his chessboard. He wasn’t about to go steal from paediatrics to entertain Potter.
Hermione rested her hands on the table and leaned closer, "I've been tracking you through your tour of the commonwealth with Wizards Outside Nations, volunteering at any magical or magic-adjacent catastrophe where they would take you. I'm fairly confident you want to start cleaning up the bullshit colonial England left behind almost as much as I do. We've left those people to fend for themselves for too long, they deserve better than that from us. I think we need to be accountable for the damage and I know you agree." She raised an eyebrow daring him to disagree. "I can't say that much about the emergency Healers at St Mungo's."
He pressed the tip of his wand to it and in a few moments an address in the south of France was burned into it in Malfoy's loopy handwriting.
“Uhm… happy to be of help...” Ron offered, still not quite sure how this was exciting, but Malfoy seemed to think it was good news, and as long as they could go forward with Harry’s treatment, he wasn't going to question it. Hearing Malfoy call him an angel of a man was wild. Wilder than finding him on his couch in the middle of the night. But apparently this was his life now. He had Harry crazy AND Malfoy crazy now.
With this chapter we should be past the worst of the pain (as far as I've planned which isn't far at all). On that note I feel like it's fair to put a TW for panic attacks. It's not really graphic or intense but I feel like it's better to be safe than sorry. Also there's children being harmed and women dying. If you need details check the end notes.

Draco looked torn, his shoulders tense as he glanced at the door and then back at Harry before nodding. “Yes,” he replied. “Ok.” He sat down, pulling the chair close to the bed.
"And who's paying you to be here?" Draco asked as they set up camp, doubling the wards around key structures.
Griffith nodded but he didn't seem at all convinced. Draco was glad they didn't lose the girl; it would have been a much different conversation to have.
“I’m sure you have extensive notes on it you could pass along to whoever would take over his care.”
The shifting light, catching on the iridescent tiles, was almost hypnotising and Harry might have ended up spending more time than he realised under the spray because when he stepped out, newly dressed and feeling refreshed, there was no trace of Hermione. He wasn't too worried about her safety but he hadn't paid enough attention to the path they took to get there and the corridors all looked the same. He opened the door he guessed led back to the front desk but he found himself in a massage room, clearly occupied. He was about to apologise and leave when he recognised the man slumped shirtless in the chair with a woman working at his back and one at his hand.
"Went better than we expected," Taranjit joked, a teasing twinkle in his black eyes as he looked at Draco.
"It's good to be back working with you, Potter, I missed this scintillating energy you bring to the table."
"I don't like that Griffith is leading the Healers."
"Do you really think I don't know that? I've seen it, I've been living alongside poverty and hunger for years." Draco frowned, Potter knew this already, "I reconstructed a child's lungs just last month, Potter."
“From you? Nothing besides collaboration in your treatment. What were you about to ask for?” Malfoy asked, leaning back against the chair and crossing his legs at the knee.
The few people he talked to during the tour confirmed it was a great working environment, the synergy among the departments was great, and there seemed to be a million trials running at the same time. The publications alone were incredible.
“I know that now,” Harry chuckled, tilting his head back a little.
Finnigan snorted “Oh, it does.” he replied with a chuckle.
As soon as he stepped through the almost physical border of the Weather-Control Charms and took a couple steps in the foyer, he was spotted by Yuvarani who waved him over.
Harry reached back, grabbing his sleeve. “Come inside me, I want to feel it.”
Hermione has a breakthrough in her research but somehow it's still bad news for Harry.
He didn’t have a thing for Malfoy.
Potter didn't answer. He just sat down on the bench in front of Draco and stared out towards the rapidly approaching coast of the island.
“Eh, we’re all kinky fuckers. We were happy to hear our perfect vanilla Saviour is bent just like the rest of us,” he grinned. “Draco more than anyone, but still, it was nice to hear.”
“First of all who said I’m the one who’s going to propose?” Draco replied, trying his best to sound haughty. “And second of all Pansy hasn’t gotten married yet so the option’s open.”
"Before you accuse me of stealing your family house away from its last descendants, I tracked the owners down with the help of your cousin and bought it back." Draco preempted an accusation that hadn't even come to Harry's mind. "He helped me find local craftsmen and artisans to restore it. I hired Dean Thomas to find the original art but… well, it was recreated as close to the originals as possible."
you here, for my ease of mind and I think yours too, I
“That is mutinous, Soup!” Draco gasped.
They didn't waste much time getting to know the local officials that welcomed them to Jawhar, they had quite the trip ahead of them and Harry was anxious to get going.
Harry nodded determinedly.
He carefully opened Potter’s door, trying to be silent in case he was sleeping. He quickly slipped in and put the board on the bedside table, a note on top of it with the instructions in case Potter had never used a self-playing board.
“See?” He told Malfoy gesturing towards her “She thinks it could be a bond.” He said, that proved his point.
“Draco, stop teasing and fuck me,” Harry whined, tilting his hips back to try and get Draco where he wanted him.
He almost ran into Dana as he marched back to his office to start researching “Just the woman I needed.” He told her after apologizing for bumping into her “There’s been development in Potter’s conditions. Or rather, there haven’t been any which is something we need to look into. I’ll explain while we walk.” He told her, effectively kidnapping her.
“Only the prompt intervention of Daphne Greengrass, fellow model, prevented the tragic accident from turning fatal.” She read out loud before turning The Prophet towards him so he could see the shot.
Harry had taken his godfatherly duties very seriously and his hair braiding skills, while still not on par with Ron's, were more than adequate.
“So… When are you coming back?” Harry asked after catching Draco up with his peace talks with Soup. “Because Blaise told me a few things about you and ropes I would like to have a long in-depth discussion about...” he added suggestively.
He threw the paper away after checking how his investments were doing. He poured himself another cup of coffee and savoured it slowly before getting into the eggs and toast.
"No, I'm just going to unpack and try to get used to the timezone," she replied.
“Did Healer Dana decide when you’re going to get released?” Draco asked halfway through a chess game.
A third competent woman appears
The first one to catch the imagery behind the inscription on Astoria's grave wins the nerd award.
She left after making tea and feeding him some more around six, telling him she had to start making dinner, Fleur was coming over with the children.
” he said, for what was probably the thirtieth time that hour. He raised an eyebrow and smiled indulgently. “Tell me all about these devious, wicked plans of yours.”
Harry smiled wryly. “You don’t seem all bad.”
He nods in approval. “Brilliant. I’m going to take a quick nap.” He chuckles. “A bit drowsy to be quite honest.”
So I start jogging down the pavement. Stop at the next shop window. I look into it; try to check my reflection. Nothing.
You nod, like you already knew what I was going to say. “Right. Yeah,” you mutter. You pause. Your hand clenches and unclenches the blankets some more.
I squeeze my eyes shut tight. I see my father, dried up and dead. I open them. I see you, barely alive.
“We should also send something to Monday,” Harry added. He walked a bit farther down the aisle, searching the shelves for something that could work.
“We donate to both, darling.”
“She did?” Harry asked, confused. “Where was I? Was that when I was walking Sheila?”
. She motioned for Harry and Draco to accompany her back to the Bedding and Sleep Section of the store.
I wish we could have seen the sea together, Potter. But this is my life now, and I was never meant for great things.
I walk across the street a little bit away from him. Some car comes right at me out of nowhere, like they can’t even see me. Almost bloody hits me. I’m surprised it didn’t. All I felt was a little wind. Got my heart pumping a bit. Feeling good. Feeling alive.
Switzly nodded slowly, her eyebrows knitting. “Um… sir said
Switzly’s tiny mouth gaped open. “Umm… alright. Switzly will get her dragon-hide gloves then.” She looked very, very nervous. “Switzly will meet sirs by the plants.” She gave the carnivorous flowers one final scared look, then hurried off, trembling.
Draco continued. “And besides that, Death himself is a pretty nice bloke. We should really have Him over for dinner again sometime soon.”
” Draco looked as if he was contemplating devouring Harry whole. “Yes, the special one Mother brought us,” he continued, cheerful. “ ‘Newly released live tortured screams from behind the veil’— a classic!” Draco’s eyes were longing. “I do wish we were there to hear them firsthand though. I’ve always wanted to visit.”
“You’re alright, Potter.” I roll up my robe sleeves and turn on the faucet. I bend over the sink, bringing some piss-warm water to my mouth and swishing it around a bit. I spit it out and look at you again. “Come to bed, then.”
,” Draco agreed, admiring the raw red handprints he had left on Harry’s neck. He reached up to trace them, then looked at Switzly once more. “This past Tuesday we spent the night in the Malfoy cemetery, in fact.” He smiled. “The weather simply
Then Draco continued. “But yes, I have more to tell you. The Productive Use of Dark Magic Department is formally inviting us as their esteemed guests to the Ministry’s Annual Holiday Ball.” Draco turned to watch Harry’s face closely.
when we get home. I would hate to forget and hit them into Smith’s house without making sure they blow him up once they’re inside. That’s half the fun,” he chuckled.
“I suppose.” I open the bottle and drench my throat. “What do you really want then?”
“Hell.” I start laughing. “And you’re very happy, are you?”
“But the ache is the best part, darling.” Draco’s mouth twisted into something smug. “And I haven’t the slightest why Ronald would think such a wonderful thing.” He wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist and pulled him close. “You know I would never kill him unless he asked me to.”
As usual, Draco’s heart pounds as he approaches the entrance. So maybe—
“Father’s funeral was fucking fantastic, you know,” I gasp after I’m finished. “He insisted on an open casket in his will. Magically binding and all.”
He nodded, pleased. He wrapped his free arm around my waist and pulled me in close. I leaned into him. He was warm, strong, a welcome presence at my side. I needed that when we were surrounded by large groups of unfamiliar people. I was lucky he knew me so well.
Draco nodded, barely looking at it. “Anything you want, darling.” He appeared to be more interested in studying Harry’s lips in great detail. “We’ll arrange to have
Your mouth twists into a strange shape, and you turn towards the door. “Bed,” you mutter.
“Oh,” Harry said, mouth twisting. “I’m supposed to kill you, you know.”
“What a dreadful idea,
“Fucking hell.” Your voice is rough in that way it always is. “I think I’m supposed to tell you to drink water or some shit.” And then you’re laughing because you don’t know how to talk right about these things. “Sorry, I don't know why I’m laughing. It’s really not funny—your dad being dead and shrivelled.”
“Yes,
“It certainly is a fun one,” Draco smirked. “We use the noose when we’re feeling especially…
.” Draco wrapped his hand around the side of a very enthusiastic Harry’s neck, his fingers dancing along Harry’s throat like he wanted nothing more than to choke him lovingly. The skin around Harry’s neck paled as Draco began to squeeze.
these?” Draco asked, horrified.
“It’s alright, I suppose,” Draco said, hesitant. He really didn’t mind at all, but he knew Father would. And it seemed as if Father was always in Draco’s head, though Draco often wished he wasn’t.
“Not much of a talker, are you?” Tosser's voice is loud, all cheerful-like.
Robards smiles indulgently. “Magnificent. It’s so important to teach children valuable life skills.” He chuckles, looks at me in amusement. “Your aunt and uncle did well with you, Harry.”
I look over at Draco—he smirks, hand resting high on my inner thigh. Clever fingers stroke, and heat rushes through me. I stifle a muffled gasp.
Harry laughed, leaning into Draco’s side. “You’re already out of Bludgers? Fuck, Malfoy. You work fast.”
at it, barely scolding.
You laugh some more, then your grin slowly fades into a frown as it often does. “All the people I love tend to die,” you say, quiet. “So I’m not going to tell you I love you.”
“We don’t have one,” Harry added helpfully.
“You’re right. It’s still not enough,” Draco said. “Ten thousand!” His breath quickened as he eyed Harry with darkened, wanting eyes, like he was craving him.
Nothing at all, sir!” Switzly exclaimed, eyes darting back and forth. “Switzly will leave sirs alone to look at the mattresses now.” She rushed away, not daring to look back at them once.
Harry looked excited. “What did they say?”
Father was not a kind man, or a good man. I loved my Father. For the longest time, I wanted to be my father. I am not kind, and I am not good.
“What can I say?” Draco said, amused. “Zacharias Smith’s dining room window is the perfect target to practise my aim. I think I’d make an extraordinary Beater, to tell you the truth. My talents were wasted as a Seeker.”
“How delightful,” Draco said, captivated. “That reminds me of the time we spent with those Dementors in the States after we slaughtered the last rogue Death Eater.” Draco’s voice was heavy and low, his eyes dark with debauchery. “Who would have known that Dementors could be so…
Switzly started to take off her dragon-hide gloves, but she stopped and shook her head, grumbling something about
"I love you, Draco," I whisper.
Once you finish with your boots, you amble over to the door and turn to face me. You’re skin and bones; half naked in those trousers and your fucking dirty boots. Your eyes droop low, red-rimmed as usual.
it when you come here.”
“Well, it’s pretty bloody uncomfortable knowing that you fucking hate it when I come here.” Draco laughs harshly. “
Harry laughed. “I just want to make sure that no one else wants some of them.” He turned to Switzly and looked at her knowingly. “I can imagine your Cannibalistic Carnations are in especially high demand this season.”
Our wedding was big. I wanted it to be small.
I look at you. Your arms and hands tremor, but you don’t even notice it anymore.
“I agree completely,
It’s nearing 3 AM when I reach the slums and slam on the break at my last stop.
Then he glanced at Monday’s letter that Draco still held in his hand. “What did Monday say in her letter? All awful things, I hope.”
Draco stood there and watched him for a long moment.
love someone.”
“Mmm. Alright then.” You turn onto your side, facing me. There’s dark smeared under your eyes, and I can’t tell if it’s your leftover eyeliner or because you only sleep a few every other night. Both, probably.
Harry laughed as a sprig of Snapping Sage nibbled ferociously on his hand, only to have it convulse and withdraw in disgust once it bit all the way through his palm. He
Harry pressed himself back against the shelf, his limbs loose and eyes half-open and heavy as he smiled, teasing. “I…
“Merlin, I want you,” Harry said, gruff. He looked like he was about to strip down and fuck him right there in the middle of the store. (It wouldn’t be the first time this had happened.)
Fuck. I hate cooking Salmon Wellington. It’s tedious, time consuming, and creates a sink full of dishes. I’m dirty, sweaty, and greasy from oiling brooms and flying all over the Quidditch pitch. I wonder if I'll even have time to take a hot shower and sit down.
“Yeah, me too.” Harry pulled Draco close to him as they began following a horrified Switzly over to the Bedding and Sleep Section again. “At least for now, we know that Sirius is having fun down there.”
“The ceremony was certainly beautiful,” Robards says, eyes twinkling. “I still see it mentioned in Wizard Weekly on occasion.”
“It might,” you reply, bloody stubborn as always. “I’d get better for him. I’d treat him right.” You glance down at the faded ciggy burns littering both your hands, some partially obscured by
“Oh.” You stiffen. I see your eyes open just a little wider, like maybe I’ve finally beaten some life into you. But you slump against the headboard once more, cheeks gaunt. “Teddy doesn’t need to see me like this,
“Yeah, some nutter jumped onto the tracks last night and splattered all over. They’re ruining our property values, I’ll say.”
“Oh Harry, I’ve been meaning to ask you” —Draco wrinkled his nose as he lifted the edge of an
“Oh,” you laugh. “One of your many flaws, mate.” The dirty sole of your foot travels up my calf and back down again, like your own sort of fucked-up show of affection.
“We don’t really need one,” Draco scoffed.
You laugh. “I don’t want to think. It’s nice. Robards, Kingsley—they’ll tell me what I should do, and I don’t have to think.” You pause and breathe in, then let it out, hot and slow. “I’m just.. really tired of thinking. Of remembering all the things I’ve fucked over.” You smile, resigned. “It’s better this way. It’s good. I’ll help people. Make things right.”
up there; the blood dripping from your skin, gushing—I wanted to lap up every drop.” He smiled wickedly, widely. “So I did.”
“Good choice,” Harry said.
I bring it up to my face and wipe the drool and wet vomit off my mouth and neck. Then drop it on the cold linoleum. “I’m clean,” I say, but I will never be clean. “I’m clean, and my father is dead.”
Draco mouthed at the skin under Harry’s ear. “First,” he breathed, “I’ll get the red hot pokers ready for you and burn them until they’re scalding, just the way you like,
Draco had snickered. “Not everyone can stomach a life of violent crime, darling.”
“Yeah. Anyway”—You open your eyes and look at me, gentle— “can’t say I’m surprised, honestly.” You nudge my thigh with your knobby knee that I hate but not really. “About your parents not loving each other and all.”
Harry lifted his head briefly to take a breath and look at Draco, eyes dark and wanting. “You’re like curdled treacle tart,” Harry said, gruff. “A bloody delicacy.”
“You can’t make things right again, Potter.” I say. My heart continues to pound against my ribcage. I want to be angry; my brain is itching for it. You always want to make things right—you’re so bloody good, but you’re not, not really.
“I understand.” He smiled kindly.
Draco swallows painfully and puts on a mask of utter disinterest. He scoffs, “Yes, Potter. Although I wish you’d have told me.”
I felt my stomach lurch. I hastily declined.
“Brilliant,” the bloke smiled, easy. He paused to adjust the small, furry creatures in his arms. “I’m Harry, the new groundskeeper.”
Switzly approached them with tentative steps. Huge dragon-hide mitts enveloped her hands. “Should Switzly get your hungry plants now, sirs?”
“I know, Draco, I know,” Harry cut in and looked at Draco, endeared.
death, we
“Yes, I thought so too,
Listen, Potter, I’m about thirty years his senior, and I’ve got no plans to bend him over and fuck him without a rubber. Fuck, that reminds me of us at Crabbe’s wake.
I chuckle, and explain that I decided to take the rest of the day off. I had a hard day at work, and I was hoping we could just stay in tonight, maybe watch a movie on the couch together and—
I stand there, still. Feel like my insides are jumbled up cold. In a few moments, that same crumpled article that Fancy was reading comes floating back my way. It settles on the ground. I bend over to take a look and read the title.
Draco sighed and reluctantly moved off of him so they could both stand. “Yes, you’re right. I still don’t understand why we have to buy one in the first place—we don’t use them at all.”
“I know, but ‘Mione and Ron refuse to sleep in the guest casket,” Harry frowned. “Ron thinks it’s your way of telling him that you want him dead, and ‘Mione says it hurts her back.”
with the children for the weekend. I told her we planned to play Wake the Dead with Monday and Rotsley when they visited on Saturday, and that Barbara was more than welcome to come, but she declined! A bit odd if you ask me, is all I’m saying,” Draco grimaced. “But no judgments here! To each their own…” He shook his head in disbelief.
. Don’t stop,” he breathed. He turned to Switzly. “My flowers are always ravenous at home, too. Just last weekend, one tried to eat our son Rotsley! Bit off a couple of his fingers, the little bugger. Such fun!” He shook his head, endeared. “These’ll fit right in,” he assured her with a grin.
Draco looked down at the letter again. He grew increasingly gleeful as he scanned its contents. “Oh,
,” he said, sheepish.
“Who, Hermione?”
Draco looked at him, intrigued.
“Fuck off,” I mutter, and I smile because it’s sort of funny in an awful way. “I did.”
Harry sighs exasperatedly. “No- that’s not what I meant.”
“Perhaps,” I cough. “Hand me your shirt.” My throat feels like someone’s stripped it of its skin and poked little bloody holes all over it.
“I know,” Harry said, wistful. “At least Cousin That enjoyed it. He told me that the Inferi’s rotten arms and legs and skin actually broke out of their bindings this time and started chasing the nude spectators all over the fairgrounds. I think those wizards in the audience got a real
show that night,” Harry gave Draco a wry smile. “If you know what I mean.”
Switzly turned pale. “Alright… anything else that sirs like?”
Why does he look so...
Then he gently placed all his flowers into their shopping cart, wandlessly casting a reinforced chain around the rambunctious plants to secure them into place. “They never like the way I taste,” Harry continued, watching the flowers in adoration.
Fancy doesn’t look up from his paper. Face wet, still got his shirt off, chest and ribs quivering.
Switzly’s eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets. “Um… what else do sirs like?” She looked like she was afraid to hear the answer.
“Wonderful!” Harry looked delighted, and also a tad pink in the face. (Draco’s hand had not-so-subtly crept beneath Harry’s elastic waistband). Draco’s lips twitched as he continued to squeeze and knead Harry’s arse.
They pushed their cart over to the Quidditch area of the store and stopped in front of a variety of Bludgers, Quaffles, and Snitches.
“Yes, I tried to tell him that, but he didn’t understand. He said we had to buy a real bed if we expected them to stay the night again.” Harry grinned and shrugged. “Oh, and while we’re here, I need some more Cannibalistic Carnations and Fanged Geraniums. The ones at home are getting very lonely.” He gestured to the carnivorous plant aisle, brows furrowing. “And hungry… come to think of it.”
Still standing by the mattresses, Draco and Harry walked over to the store’s Magical Creatures section. They stopped in front of a cage full of small, fluffy Pygmy Puffs and parked their cart to the side of it.
“Yeah, that was fun,” Harry grinned. “But I didn’t think our tour guide would be so upset about it—she said it was where the saviour died, after all,” he chuckled.
Harry bounded up to them, inspecting them. “Oh! Your Cannibalistic Carnations are especially fresh,” he exclaimed, eyes wide and eager. He watched lovingly as their voracious jaws unhinged and teeth bared. Various mutilated petals and shredded leaves fell to the floor of the store. “Yeah, I’ll take all of them.” Harry looked very, very excited.
Draco chuckled. “Yes, I told Barbara that Ernie was clearly enjoying himself—his screams were quite loud, really. I admit I was even a little jealous; I’ve never been able to scream like that without rupturing my lungs, sadly—but Barbara was rather insistent nonetheless,” Draco said, shaking his head. “Sheila will be terribly disappointed, I’m afraid.”
I get to the shop window and look into it. Get my face way close to the glass like it’s a mirror. I’ve got to make sure I’m still polyjuiced. I know that I am, but I like to check. Can’t let anyone see that it’s really me.
You pause. “I don’t want you to die, and if I tell you, then you might.” You take a raspy breath in and slowly release it.
the way she’s supposed to?”
try this, darling.”
“It’s okay, Draco,” Harry chuckled. “We can finally try out that new recording tonight instead.”
Any man who was not Harry Malfoy would have been terrified at the wild, ravenous look taking over Draco’s face, his eyes gleaming dangerously. “Oh
The thing is—nifflers can’t produce milk naturally. You have to forcibly, painfully draw it out of them. Hagrid has a tendency to spout creature facts when he’s had too much to drink.
“Yeah, I know,” I say. We’re so close I can feel your heart thumping slow and weak in your chest. I think all the Dreamless thickens the blood in your veins; it numbs you out and adds stress and strain. “I can feel your heart,” I whisper.
Draco looked embarrassed. “You really do torture me,
“Not really,” I say, gruff. I drive us through a real tight spot in the city, and I split the bus in two. I punch the orange knob and spin it three times to put us back together again. We rattle and shake and nearly tip over twice as we skid along the pavement. It smells like smoke and burnt motor fluid and charred rubber.
this morning in all your tragic glory,” Draco replied, standing up to check on the patch on Potter’s chest.
One of Draco’s hands wrapped around Harry’s, guiding him to stroke him at exactly the right speed. Harry turned to look at the way their fingers entwined around Draco’s cock. It didn’t escape him how Draco moaned at the scrape of Harry’s beard against his sensitive neck and he did it again to listen to that desperate little whine and feel the twitch of his cock in his hand.
Draco felt his cheek heat up and he tried pointlessly to hide it behind the flute of champagne, draining the last of it. "He said that, hasn't he? Well, it might be stretching the truth a bit, but I suppose I could in a pinch. It's not my expertise."
“It’s personal, I think you should ask him if you really want to know.” Ron defended himself, bouncing Hugo a bit as he woke up from his post lunch nap.
“Do you play chess?” he asked, taking pity on him. Potter nodded enthusiastically at the idea. “I’ll see if I can get you a self-playing board to keep you entertained,” he promised, watching Potter’s face flood with relief before turning around again and actually leaving to check in on his other patients.
“Weren’t you off duty?” Harry teased him, an amused smile tugging at his lips. Apparently that was the wrong thing to say because the comfort and relaxation immediately left Malfoy’s stance, his expression closing off in the blink of an eye. It was like being hit with a bucket of ice water, he hit a switch and the warmth was entirely gone, like it had never been there in the first place.
Hanson looked at him for a long moment like he’d grown a second head.
“I’m close, Harry,” he groaned, reaching around to wrap his hand around Harry’s cock.
“Relax,” Draco purred.
fix it?” Harry asked.
“It’s a common expression of bonds.” She explained to Harry “Even temporary ones often manifest in some form of conscience transference, especially during sleep when we’re less in control of our mental defences.” Harry nodded along. Made a lot of sense.
“Not many know both killing curses left a scar,” Harry replied, brushing his fingers gently along Draco’s cheekbone. “Besides, I much prefer having your mark near my heart over his,” he added. Draco turned to kiss the palm of Harry’s hand.
“How does the sling feel?” Malfoy asked, putting his hands in his pockets as they took a casual stroll through the busy halls up to the common room where a few more patients were playing cards or finishing breakfast.
Harry raised his eyes to look at Malfoy and he didn't need an apology, another one. He didn't need words anymore.
mentioned was the involvement of a St Mungo’s Healer in international organized crimes,” Draco explained. “I’ll give you three guesses on who among the people in this room the press assumed that Healer is.” Draco shot Ron a murderous glare.
How was one meant to focus on work when there was a beautiful man, who apparently loved him, begging to be tied up, already in his house, waiting for him? Draco had the best and worst friends in the world.
"I'm sure they will." Harry decided not to distract her further and sat still, content to watch her scrunch her nose in concentration. She looked so much like Hermione in that moment, that same curl escaping her messy bun in the middle of her forehead, that same scrunched nose, and the tip of her tongue between her teeth as she got to his pinky finger. The smattering of freckles, though, showing up now in the middle of summer when the sun kissed her tawny complexion, were all Ron.
And then Potter stormed in, taking the stand as if it had personally offended him. It was clear he wasn't any happier than Draco about being in that room. His gaze leveraged accusations against him that the Wizengamot could only begin to imagine as he was subjected to the indignity of taking Veritaserum and being interrogated about the incident in the Forbidden Forest the night of the Battle of Hogwarts. Draco could see him fight every word that spilled from his lips. He could see the distaste burning his tongue with every concession he made about his mother's involvement in the vanquishing of the Dark Lord. He didn't stay to hear the sentence being passed; all their English properties being repossessed, save for Malfoy Manor, on account of it being an ancestral home, and three-fourths of the non-cursed content of the Malfoy family Gringotts vault being devolved to the war reparations effort. Draco imagined he heard it from Granger before the papers. They were free but stripped of everything he'd known most of his life. Their name was less than worthless and the considerable amount of gold they still had was no good in the United Kingdom, not then, not after the re-education programme, not after the community service hours.
“I know that,” Weasley replied slowly, making Draco stop in his tracks. “How do
“I’m not your Healer this time around,” Draco reminded him.
"I'm vegetarian. I'm not going to make you eat fish at all," Harry reminded him. "And as much as I'd like to kill you sometimes, street food during monsoons would be an unusually convoluted way to go about it." He smiled at the familiarity of throwing barbs at each other. It was light and with little heat behind them, a comfortable game Harry had forgotten how much he enjoyed.
They pulled apart slowly, with more lingering kisses bringing them closer every time they tried to step back. There were no words exchanged between them, no explanation, no justification, but as Harry looked at Malfoy's eyes, the pupils, blown wide, told him everything he needed to know, it wasn't all him in that kiss, it was the drink, and the charge of magic in the air, and a million other coincidences.

"Ready to get back to it, Griffith?" Draco asked, rolling up his sleeves and casting a quick Diagnostic Spell to check on the girl's conditions.
Draco nodded, knowing Potter’s penchant for disarming people it would make a lot of sense. If he’d had a run in with the person that cursed him there could be a divided loyalty in the wand and his body may have a hard time recognizing the residue as extraneous.
“Because of how her sister died.” Malfoy cut it short, and Harry caught up. Greengrass. She was Astoria’s older sister. She nearly became Malfoy’s sister-in-law. “But that wasn’t the point of the exercise,” he added, the annoyance simmering down when Harry didn’t push for more. “Did you pay attention?” he asked.
“Auror Potter’s safety has not been compromised by Healer Malfoy’s actions at all, quite the opposite in fact.” Blaise stepped in again, pulling Andrews’ attention “As the reports clearly show Healer Malfoy followed procedure to stabilize him and stepped outside the sanctioned limits only when Auror Potter proved unresponsive to conventional treatment, effectively saving his life. Auror Potter is suffering no negative consequences from Healer Malfoy’s actions.”
It might have been the potion, the pain, the intoxicating touch of Malfoy’s hands or the hypnotizing lilt of his voice repeating sharp syllables over and over obfuscating Harry’s better judgment, and in all honesty it was a bit Malfoy’s fault as well for demanding he keep talking because Harry found himself saying whatever came to mind.
But it was never enough. He also had the highest number of summons in front of the disciplinary board. Probably in the history of the hospital.
“You’re complaining about boring dreams?” Malfoy asked him, an eyebrow raised making Harry burn under his implicit judgment.
“I never asked you: why an iris?” he asked softly, glancing up at Draco’s face.
"I would have done the same." Malfoy dismissed his apology too easily, it wasn't right.
"I gathered as much," he replied quietly.
“Fair. But you’re going to fix me, who’s going to fix you?” Harry replied easily, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
As he ran a hand down his chest, feeling the light silk under his palm, he didn't regret letting Potter take the wheel and bring him to buy a sherwani. It fit him perfectly, and the pale blue-grey complimented him, bringing out his eyes. At some point in the last decade, Potter had acquired some taste, apparently. He did up the buttons in the front, appreciating the way it closed up to his neck. He fixed a pocket square and brushed his finger along the delicate stitching of the embroidered trees in deep blue over his left shoulder.
He sent a note back to her, there was no point in trying to dissuade her, and deep down he didn’t want to. He needed to have her infusing new fight into him if he was going to go through the hearing and the subsequent investigation.
Malfoy and a blonde woman, that could have almost been his sister, were assisting a woman, laid out on the runway.

As promised, somewhat on schedule here's the new chapter. Once again I have to thank
Draco looked up and frowned at McReary’s smiling face at the window. For some reason, he was convinced Murphy would be in. He shrugged, McReary was better. He was fresh out of training, eager to please, still not used to being a full-fledged healer, easy to manipulate.
