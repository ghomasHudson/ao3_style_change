“She’s—” the brown-skinned woman winced, and the tips of her ears went a bit ruddy. “It’s just—she’s unprofessional.”
“I've always found you very hard to predict,” McGonagall said flatly. “You zigged when I thought you’d zag. It took a long time for me to realize I should assume the foolhardiest option was the one you’d choose. Inevitably.” She softened that observation with a small smile. “Dumbledore seemed to have you figured out.”
“Are you?” Pansy wonders with a curious head tilt. “That’s not the word I’d use. Protective, I think. Or even
“I wanted to—to tell you. To let you know—” Harry swallowed hard. “The thestrals, James. I wanted to warn you about the thestrals.”
“Dad?” Lily said, tugging at his hand. “Artie just got here.” Harry glanced toward the platform entrance. It was easy to pick out Millicent Bulstrode carrying a large cat in a blue plastic crate.
“Mr. Potter!” Professor Tugwood cried. “I’m so pleased to meet you.” She clicked and rolled her way down the room toward them. Behind her, Lakshmi shot daggers out of her eyeballs at Nev.
It made no sense, but he couldn’t help feeling like he was doing something wrong even speaking to Astoria. That was truly daft. He and Draco weren’t friends, and Harry didn’t need to choose a side. Astoria must have her reasons for carrying on such a long affair. It wasn’t Harry’s business. Unfortunately, Harry’d never been good at minding his own business.
“Well, the letters on my wrist say otherwise,” she sighed. She pushed back the sleeve of her black dress. The tattoo was stark against the buttery skin of her left arm.
“Well… I have to leave. To go back to my lab.” Malfoy deliberately smoothed his expression into something professional, and went on, “I thought you might like an update on the… situation.”
“I wonder what it was like for Albus,” Sol pressed, unflinching, “to be demonized by his mother, however briefly.”
To her left was Filius Flitwick, looking exactly the same as when Harry took his Charms courses in 1997. Next to Flitwick sat Sybill Trelawney, the Divination professor, trailing scarves and the scent of patchouli. On Sybill’s other side, a very quiet woman named Zoe Anderson-Barre who taught the new Literature & Writing courses implemented after the war.
Hermione forgot about the washing in the middle again, so I've got to air everything out and run it over. You'd think I'd be used to pregnancy brain by now, but it still surprises me when she gets scattered like this.
Albus and Scorpius were extremely talkative, but also extremely secretive, which meant Harry had to pretend not to listen in as they dissected every possible outcome of the next year’s Hogwarts schedule. Scorpius had special permission to visit Hogsmeade on occasion, since his family lived on the outskirts, and Albus was finally old enough to visit, too.
Luckily, Astoria was absorbed in reading the back of a package as Harry approached. He cleared his throat too loudly. She blinked. “Hello? May I help you?”
“Why not?” Harry knew such things were possible; he’d learned more than he ever needed to know about magical childbirth, as the father of three Weasleys. “I thought it was just… you know,
Harry sighed. “Probably not. Go on,” he told the children, “out the back. I’ll speak to Scorpius’s mum, and meet you in a minute.” Albus scowled, dark brows meeting over a copy of Harry’s straight nose, but he let himself follow obediently behind his little sister as she dragged along his bemused best mate.
Harry tucked the Marauders’ Map into his pocket before he focused on the snake-shaped sink tap. Parseltongue wasn’t the only Magical language—Mermish, Gnomish, Elvish, Hermione was collecting the set—but it was the only language you didn’t need to
“What in Merlin’s name am I doing here, Ted?” James demanded, with muffled venom. “All my year is so far ahead, I’m never going to catch up. I can’t fly. I can’t duel. I can’t even walk to bloody Hogsmeade.”
“Right.” Al scrubbed a hand through his wavy hair. It looked like he hadn’t brushed it since he left home two weeks ago. Al’s robes were on skew-whiff and his glasses were smudged. Rose had a quill tucked into her ponytail, but was otherwise dressed normally. Scorpius looked like an advert for The Finest in British Wizarding Education.
Harry makes a sound not unlike a growl and spins on his heel. “I don’t want to know this, you bitch!” He stomps (or maybe staggers) his way to the kitchen, with Pansy clicking at his heels.
“Yes, Mr. Teddy Lupin,” she agreed, eyeing the bottles. There was a deep sadness in the slope of her tiny shoulders.
“A Pureblood Hufflepuff,” Angie said, “from a long line of Slytherins. And she raised another one without any problem, didn’t she?”
“Well...” Angie accepted a cup of tea from Hermione, and the look they exchanged was loaded with meaning. “Like I said, nothing but rumors.”
Harry was so tired. His head ached. “James,” he said, pinching the bridge of his nose. “What if you were hurt? Someone might’ve needed to get those potions for you. Or what if one of your cousins, or your sister, needed something from your trunk?”
Harry said nothing, but leaned more heavily into the wall. Neville crossed his arms as he watched Pomfrey and Lakshmi nodding to each other, a small frown on his face. He looked tired.
“She did!” Harry pushed his glasses up, rubbed at his eyes. “There’s a lot of bad history there. We all have demons. Ginny’s demons were mostly reptiles.”
It was Ron who broke the tension with an awkward laugh. “Sure, Parkinson, sure. You and Malfoy were thick as thieves back then, yeah?”
Parkinson drew a breath, and started to count off on her polished fingers. “Popularity. Money. Respect. Power. In exchange, the Wizarding World gets to
For a wild moment, he thought it was Salazar Slytherin speaking. Well, the statue, anyway. He watched it, suspicious, until the voice sighed once more.
"But..." Draco stared at him as Harry picked his words with care. "With the DARC, and everything..."
Malfoy tilted his head to one side whenever he thought someone made a good point. He scrunched up his nose. He chewed both his lips simultaneously. He ran his fingers through his beard when he sighed. But Malfoy never, ever smiled.
Ooh, obviously. Muggle?” She raises a perfect black eyebrow at him, and Harry glares back. “Yes, she’d have to be, wouldn’t she? Draco’s was, as well.”
It was a slim, shiny, dark green phone with too many camera lenses on the back. Malfoy didn’t use a cell phone case, of course. Most wizards just cast Impervius and Fianto Duri on their electronics, and got on with it. Most wizards who
Teddy sat up on his elbows to stare at Harry. His raised eyebrows were two different colors. “She sure as shit does!”
Lily and Molly were talking, but quietly. Molly did everything quietly. Her younger sister, Lucy, wasn’t with them—probably because she was a constant flight risk. They’d have found her on the roof of the Hogwarts express, or trying to abscond with a stranger’s toad.
“Hestia and I are—are Carrows.” When Hermione smiled, Flora swallowed and went on: “We haven’t used that name since the war. Hestia goes by Pérez, which was our mother’s maiden name. Our father is the elder brother of Amycus and Alecto, although we didn’t know them well before they came to teach at Hogwarts.”
“Graham’s all right. We’re all doing all right.” When Parkinson opened her mouth again, the larger woman grasped her fluttering fingers. “Breathe, Pans.”
Malfoy stared at him for a long, tense moment. Then he said, wonderingly, “You honestly don’t. You have no idea.” He snorted his frowning approximation of a laugh. “That’s rather punctured my ego, if I’m honest.”
“Could we replace the unicorn horn in the potion?” Harry found himself asking. He cleared his throat and tried to look competent.
“Who’s Graham?” Ron said, taken aback. Harry nearly asked the question in stereo, but bit his tongue just in time.
“I don’t think James intended any harm, directly, but he wasn’t put off by the possibility.” She sighed, and adjusted her glasses on her nose. “That worries me.”
The Great Hall broke out in giggles. Al turned so red that he looked combustible. Rose led the way toward them, as Scorpius waved back enthusiastically. “Hello Mr. Lupin!” Scorpius cried. “Hello Mr. Potter. How lovely to see you! Are you visiting with Professor Longbottom? Has he told you yet about the incident with the snargaluff? Because Albus and I never intended to tickle it quite so aggressively—”
, but they were our family, and I betrayed them. Not soon enough.” Millie pressed her forehead to Flora’s temple. Hestia swiped at tears spilling over onto red cheeks.
“Um, thanks?” Scorpius flushed. “Still, it’d be fun to change it up, now and again, don’t you think?”
For three years, Robards drilled him in things like facial symmetry, markers of age and illness, anthropometrics. Harry struggled to separate his personal feelings from his impressions. He had to learn to identify what made a person beautiful or bland, open or obfuscating, with no foreknowledge of their personality or history. It was difficult. Even though he finally had the words for
Pansy sits down again, setting her wand on the table with deliberate care. “It’s my business to know, Potter. And you’re not particularly discreet when drunk.”
“Wicked!” Lily slipped around the counter and through the curtained door to the bakery kitchens. The other customers eyed their group with interest, but kept a respectful distance. It was one of many reasons Harry ate here several times a week.
“Professor Vector came to me that night,” Flora said. “The staff assumed that Hestia and I were Death Eater sympathizers. Amycus, in particular, favored us. Professor Vector wanted to locate our aunt and uncle—Professor Snape had disappeared, Amycus and Alecto were missing. Vector was convinced they were mounting an internal force.”
Ron left to order their food and drink at the counter, while Hermione sorted her notes into incomprehensible piles. Harry took his jacket off and chewed on the inside of his cheek. He tapped his chest with his fingers. He blinked too much.
“I am. And I need to get back to work. The poachers I was telling you about—those awful people harvesting occamy eggs? They’re coming in at three with their solicitor. Trying to settle out of court, if you can believe it! I’ve already told Laura we need to have an Auror on hand, just in case. I was reading up on the history of occamy breeding practices—”
He tries not to watch his own team as they practice maneuvers. He tries to keep his eye roaming, looking for the shine of the snitch, but he can’t seem to focus. Ron in the Keeper’s position. Angie, Spinnet, and Cho Chang: Chasing. Apparently, everyone is a Gryffindor today. Ella Flint circles the perimeter like a referee. There are too many players on the field, so there’s room for teal-haired Teddy, for Roxie, for bored Dominique. Millicent Bulstrode, whom Harry’s never seen on a broom before. Albus, improbably, stands at ground level with a clipboard and a whistle. Harry watches as he makes untidy notes with his brow furrowed. After a few minutes, Scorpius Malfoy joins him. Even in Harry’s own fantasy, Al won’t go anywhere without Scorpius.
“He’s my closest friend,” she agreed, snapping her connection to Harry with a shrug. “We’ve known one another since we were infants.”
“Call us cowards, if you want,” Flora said in a wavering voice. “Perhaps we are. Perhaps we should have been brave enough to sacrifice ourselves, and our friends, and our families. He Who Must Not Be Named would’ve punished Slytherins with a good deal more cruelty than the rest of you, but perhaps... perhaps we deserved it.”
Harry shrugs, wiping the tears and snot from his face with his sleeve. “He knows how I feel about this place.”
of October. Want to stop by? Or I can come by the Ministry for lunch? Let me know. I know they’d all love to see you.
“It really wasn’t much,” Neville confirmed, although he was smirking. “Unusually sensitive specimen, I’m afraid.”
, we took Scorpius Malfoy with us the last time. You can’t get a kid more Magical than that one. You should’ve seen him! Hoovering up meat pies like he’d never eaten before in his life! And babbling, of course, about everyone and everything. I had to Muffliato our whole group.” He sighed happily. “It was mad. Scorpius is a bit mad, though, eh?”
“Hi Draco,” Teddy said, a bit nervously. He stood, but then seemed unsure whether to approach his older cousin. His smile was a touch too bright. “You’re here to help with Sam Wolpert?”
“You want me to order some of those little sandwiches for the tea trolley? The ones with the sesame seeds?”
Harry dropped to his knees, and closed his eyes. His wand smacked into the stone, but did not break. It’d never break. That was the Elder Wand’s last great victory over death.
“Not in person.” Hermione shook her head. “Owls. A few Floo calls, but none recently. I haven’t noticed a thing. Have you seen him at work, Harry?”
“Who the hell knows?” Angie shrugged. “Those Malfoys have always had weird marriages. Lucius and Narcissa were the picture of Death Eater propriety, but his grandfather had a mistress he kept better than his wife.”
“No one actually uses that term,” she griped, mouth full of bobby pins. “That’s just an internet thing.”
This year, the Potters braved the Floo. It let out just around the corner, in a hidden alcove next to bicycle parking. The fireplace attendants looked ragged every September the First, hair frizzing and voices hoarse. Harry didn’t bother to Glamour for the trip to Platform 9 ¾; his kids were nearly as recognizable as he was. They all had to learn to endure the scrutiny.
I lost house points, but don’t freak out! It was stupid. Just an argument that got too loud. Neville didn’t even give me detention.
There’s no joy in her now, as she shrugs elegantly. “It’s neither here nor there. Draco cut him off, mid-rant, and out of his life. Entirely. Although, I very much doubt Greg would have chosen to stay.”
“Well, according to Pansy, she does,” Angie said, tossing her Charmed-blonde bangs to one side. “She said the affair wasn’t really an affair at all. That Malfoy knew about the other man all along, and they’re only splitting because of the baby.”
“I’m here, never fear!” George announced, vaulting the counter to half-hearted applause. “You’re a useless employee, Hazza. You’ve barely been here the hour.”
won’t print a thing; I’ll be sure of that. But I don’t know… The other papers will hear whispers. It’s already common knowledge you’ve been living here again, though nobody’s brave enough question
“Send your children a few presents,” Sol suggested, though it sounded more like a command. “Send Lily a stuffed lion. Ask the boys if they’re happy, and tell them how much you miss them this year. Honesty, Harry. Honesty and affection.”
life. But... " She sighed. "You aren’t a child. You’re a grown man, and Head Auror. A father. The foolhardiest option…” Her smile slipped. “It’s easier to risk one’s life when one feels quite entirely alone.”
With the other eye, Harry watched the group surrounding Albus. Malfoy had a hand on Scorpius’s shoulder, and a frown on his pale, pointed face. Harry tried to remember the last time he’d seen Draco Malfoy actually smile. It had to be before sixth year at Hogwarts, so… 23 years? Bloody hell.
Parkinson’s face, usually sneering or smirking, went utterly blank. “You aren’t straight,” she said. It wasn’t a question.
“I wish you two would take this a bit more seriously,” Hermione said. Her parchment stack looked rumpled from so much handling.
“What did he say?” Harry asks. He carries the mugs to the table, setting Pansy’s down first. She isn’t smiling anymore. Her hesitation speaks volumes, because Pansy Parkinson gossips like Harry sits a broom. Effortless. Instinctual. Joyfully.
“But they always seemed... solid,” Harry remarked as he fell into a chair at the kitchen table. “Happy, even.”
First of the Slytherins to arrive were Millicent Bulstrode—broad, busty, black hair in a messy, pageboy haircut—and Flora. Harry often thought they should’ve looked mismatched, with Flora’s willowy limbs and nervous expression, but the effect was more complementary than contradictory. Millie had a large arm wrapped around Flora’s slim waist.
. That it’d been nothing but family, when Harry was young, and that he feared it’d be nothing but family now. Not just Ginny (though God,
Millie sent an exasperated look Pansy’s way, but Harry had been sniffing out liars for a long time. He could read the hidden fondness in her face.
, Harry Potter,” she said tightly. She stared over his shoulder at the disgruntled eavesdropper for a long moment before nodding once to herself, as if her mind was made up. Her mouth barely moved as she said, “Read the transcripts.”
“Millie’s father didn’t mix much with the old crowd, after the wedding,” Pansy remarked. “I’m sure you can imagine why.”
“…Okay. You don’t look fine.” James moved closer, resting his weight on the handle of his aluminum cane. “What d’you need?”
and nobody lets me forget it—not for a moment! Lily looks—” he wiped his face furiously with both hands. “Lily looks
At the top, McGonagall led the way through her office door, into the tower-top sanctum that had once belonged to Snape, and to Dumbledore, and to generations of powerful witches and wizards. Most of the portrait frames were occupied, but all were silent.
Ginny got a letter, too. Harry asked her, more than once, what Malfoy had written. She never said. There were a lot of things Ginny never said, and now she never would.
She shook it heartily. Her fingers were unexpectedly callused. “Call me Felicity, please. I’m such a fan of your work, you know.”
They’re a disaster, honestly. Draco is brilliant, and, yes, prickly and a little dangerous, but also… Sexy. Warm.
It was like that all over the Great Hall, Harry noticed. Hufflepuff yellow at the Slytherin table, Gryffindors sitting with Ravenclaws. No sign of Al yet, but Roxie and Dominique were eating with Massimo Zabini. Quiet Molly sat surrounded by studying Ravenclaws. Lorcan and Lysander were seated at the Hufflepuff table, and the younger students around them seemed nonplussed at their presence. It reminded Harry of Luna. He smiled.
“Harry avoids Draco,” Hermione snorted. “Hasn’t taken a meeting with him in ages, even though they ask for his help on all kinds of cases.”
The motions were rote, and soothing, but Harry found he couldn’t stomach the thought of any breakfast. He doctored his coffee, made sure the cast iron stove was set low, and made his way up the stairs to get ready for the arduous journey to Scotland.
Hecate’s handbag, she was young. Had Moaning Myrtle always been that young? It’d only been a few years since Harry’d seen her. She was the same, though, and Harry was—
“Yeah. Thanks.” Spinnet shot him two quick fingers, rolled her eyes, and popped the top button on her Auror robes with a sigh. “See if I root out the next crazy for you, sir.”
Millie shook her head, black bob swinging. “Has a little brother, don’t he?” Harry didn’t know, and it looked from Hermione’s expression that she wasn’t aware either. “First year. Wouldn’t be parted from him. Smith’s the one who realized the Hog’s Head weren’t going to work,” she frowned. "He tried to stop them evacuating.”
“Not in the standard potion, no. That’s largely why you don’t keep Grand Wiggenweld on hand. I’ve been trying to figure out if Levodopa has the same contraindications, but I worry it’s just too strong for an application like this.”
Millie dropped her cig, Vanishing the butt with a twitch of her wand. “Pansy won’t snitch, and she don’t out people. Never.”
Harry knew that Malfoy’s voice didn’t concern him, but he still didn’t want to hear it. He didn’t want to wonder.
“Good thing, I guess,” Harry said. At the women’s raised eyebrows, he snorted. “Well, she married Zabini. That’d be awkward, don’t you think?”
Someone else is circling the pitch, too, probably hunting the snitch. Did they even bother to release a snitch? It doesn’t seem likely. It doesn’t seem like the kind of thing they’d bother with today. Harry squints into the butter-yellow sun, trying to make out his red-robed shadow.
“Hey Scorpius,” Harry interjected, a little hesitant. “If you don’t mind my asking, where is your mother moving to? I mean, where will she and your… er…”
“He knew when he agreed to go public with your relationship,” she muses, tucking her hair behind her ear. “He knew it was you, or nothing. I told him it was a mistake.”
“It’d have been a blood bath,” Millie nodded. “Death Eaters could’ve walked through the front doors, stepped right over the carnage. If the Dark Lord weren’t determined to kill Potter hisself, it would’ve been over before it ever began.”
Harry’s bedroom door clicked open, and Teddy barreled into the room like a pajama-clad tornado. “Harry! It’s the Floo!”
I screen my comments, and I won't post a single one that attacks or denigrates vulnerable people whom I respect. So if you try that with me? Fuck you, too.
Pansy’s voice, returned to business-like smoothness, pulls Harry back to the present. “He thinks you’re at an inn somewhere, you know.”
This is a chapter about several characters discussing their experiences at war, and in its immediate aftermath. Read when you are ready. Stay safe and healthy, friends.
. He simply announced his engagement to Astoria, and that was that.” Hermione leaned back in her chair, wincing a little. “The Sacred Twenty-Eight are strange about courtship, anyway, but Draco was famously unavailable. It was considered quite a coup when Astoria landed him, no matter the Mark on his arm.”
“She may’ve been the one brave enough, or crazy enough, to say it aloud,” Millicent put in, abashed. “But she weren’t the only one thinking it.” Her wife, Flora, nodded along with a grim expression.
"Are you sure you don't want to stay over with us tonight?" Hermione asked Harry. "I'd worry less about you if you had some support."
Artie’s cat is called Conan the Barbarian, did you know? It’s a Muggle thing. Drew Grimes, who’s in sixth year, thought the name was stupid and started calling him “Barb,” and the name sort of stuck. So now Artie has a male cat named Barb, who never stops trying to put his paw in Scorpius’s milk tea.
Teddy’s blue eyebrow went up, and Harry had to look away. It was true, of course—James had grown distant, snappish, with most of the family, but Teddy had always been different. Even in the months right after the accident, James opened up to his elder godbrother. Moving Ted into Grimmauld Place had been one of Harry’s better decisions that year. Recently, though, things seemed to be getting worse, not better.
“You know, there’s a very effective antidote potion on the market now. You can take it preemptively, which is quite clever. We’ve been stocking them in the women’s shelters. Tastes like almond cake.”
“Basements,” Millicent answered somberly. “Rosmerta's place had store rooms, a mess of them, below-ground. Figured the Death Eaters wouldn’t think to look there for survivors.”
He thinks Pansy knows. Ron would, if he were here, and Luna. Hell, maybe all of Harry’s oldest friends would know the word that’s caught in Harry’s chest. The regret, too.
After the first shock of losing her settled, for a year or so after, I kept having these jolts of pain every time she was mentioned. I read somewhere an analogy to a bouncing ball inside a closed box. The box has a button on one wall, and it hurts every time the ball presses it.
“I see.” Pansy blinks at him, weighing something before she goes on. “You should know then: Draco couldn’t tell me the color of his eyes.”
“Godric, no!” Ron scratched behind his ear with one hand. “The ferret has enough on his plate without dredging up war memories. Assuming he’d even be willing? That’d be ace, if she manages it, which means, of course, that she probably will, but it’s actually—” Ron flushed, and went a bit twitchy. “Well, Bulstrode, for one. Her wife, Flora, and Flora’s twin sister. Hestia Pérez? From accounting?” At Harry’s nod, he swallowed hard. “And there’s also…”
The once-mighty basilisk lay in dusty pieces, her skeleton the size of several train cars. She was sprawled out at Salazar Slytherin’s feet, like an offering. After the war, Harry tried to talk to Ginny about their time in the Chamber. He tried to ask about the basilisk, about how much control she’d had over the monster. It was something no one else understood, really—the Parseltongue, and the power it gave you.
“Right.” Harry tried not to grit his teeth, but he could tell by Ron’s expression that he wasn’t quite managing it. “Makes sense. Important, to get the
There was a line forming outside the entrance to Wheezes. Harry and Ron made their way around back, to the perfectly-hidden staff entrance. Ron tapped the wall with his wand and muttered, “Nobody never needed nothing nonsensical.” The door appeared, handle popping forward like the head of a turtle, and they slipped inside.
“Okay,” Harry said. “Okay. I promise not to give her a hard time about Parkinson.” Ron put on his innocent eyebrows, which made Harry roll his eyes. “That’s why you’re talking to me, isn’t it? Instead of your wife?”
“I think you should ask him,” Sol declared. “All your children, actually. You should ask whether they miss home, and if they’re happy at school.”
Scorpius went pale, which was a trick-and-a-half for a Malfoy. “Um. Yes. Mother and Vikram will be living in London, as his business is here. She’s moving into his townhouse. Father and I will stay in Hogsmeade.”
“They’re potions, and they’re prescribed by a Healer, and I followed the instructions on the label, so bugger off.” He grimaced. “Please, and maybe thank you.”
Sol uncrossed his legs and put his elbows on his knees. “Your kids don’t need an escape, Harry. They love you. They’re safe with you.”
“You’re not spe—er, species-ist,” Ted said, slowly, and his eyes were skeptical but his voice was certain. “‘Cause, like, Hagrid. And my dad. Firenze the Centaur, and that House-elf, Kreacher. Is it just Veela, then, that you don’t much like?”
“And I’m under a very nasty contract,” Parkinson argued. “Bravo for that, Hermione, very sly. Since I can’t ever discuss anything Potter tells me with anyone—even my
“You knew I’d come here,” Harry wagered, and Dumbledore didn’t deny it. “You knew, and you moved the Mirror here on purpose.”
The Honest Herbologist was a Wizarding café located outside Diagon Alley, in Clerkenwell. It was run by a pair of elderly sisters who always seemed to be arguing. Hermione and Ron loved to go for an early lunch, but Harry’d never been in for dinner before. The dining room was busier than he’d expected.
. “Ah, damn, I’ve got to go. Meeting with the Irish Quidditch Commission, and then George needs an extra hand with shipment tonight.”
“I don’t know how it is,” Harry admitted, frown deepening. “Do you often get turned away from stores?”
Morris was the sixth receptionist Harry’d hired since his wife’s death and his previous assistant’s abrupt departure, and he was happy with her work. This made Alicia Spinnet’s aggressive arrival at Harry’s door all the more exhausting.
“One more thing…” Harry pauses halfway out of his chair. Pansy manages a weak smile. “Why haven’t you told anyone, Potter? There’s no way Granger or the Weasleys would’ve kept this quiet.”
Four of the heads flashing by below him are ginger. He counts them to himself: Ron. George. Ginny. Fred. He realizes, then, that this can’t be real. He’s not here, and neither are they. It hurts worse than a bludger to the gut.
Percy drew the girls into a long-winded discussion about Hogwarts professors, so Harry’s attention began to drift. He had one eye on James, seated on somebody’s trunk near the rear of the train. He chatted with a few other Gryffindors. It was so nice to see him smiling.
I’m not sure what you mean by asking if I’m happy at school, but I’m feeling okay. I miss home, but not too much. Thanks for the frogs.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. Again. “Anyway, Fleur and I will work on the problem this evening, and get an answer for you tomorrow.”
“I will send the Owls, and you will Floo Luna’s office as soon as I disconnect.” Her tone brooked no argument. Harry wanted to come up with one, sort of, because he had
. “As you know, this is my first round of interviews for the book, and I’m not sure the prosecutorial approach is a good idea, here.”
I think maybe Louis is telling her the wrong passwords, too. He’s so annoying. He and Scorpius keep getting into arguments about those Mad Muggle comics.
The toilet flushed. “You need to explain,” Hermione called as the sink turned on. “From the beginning. You heard it from Pansy?”
“Yeah, I get it, I’m just another bloody Weasley!” Ron led the way into the Leaky, shaking his head. “Who needs Ron? Might as well send him to Sweden again—”
He bit down on his tongue. Lily was oblivious, which helped, but this just wasn’t what Harry had expected.
James pounded his cane into the concrete floor defiantly, daring anyone to mention it. The sound of it echoed off brick walls. Muggles, for the most part, ignored James’s limp in public. Wizards weren’t comfortable with problems that magic can’t fix.
Harry could feel all the eyes resting on him, like the brush of a hundred Homenum Revelio Charms. His stomach growled, but he wasn’t hungry. He gulped the perfectly-prepared coffee. Teddy dropped a lump of mashed potato onto his empty plate.
It wouldn’t be right to call McGonagall’s expression ‘disappointment,’ but it wouldn’t be entirely wrong, either. “You don’t wish to think about Mr. Malfoy.”
—Head Auror, Chosen One, figurehead of British Wizarding virtue—stay in the bloody closet?” Parkinson’s cool expression was long gone, replaced with flushed cheeks and fierce eyes.
“You know, I rather thought you’d hex me on the doorstep, Potter,” she says, and uses her wand to Vanish the tea bag from her cup. “Aren’t you angry with him?”
“I don’t know, do I?” He scoffed. “I’m not the dominating kind!” Harry choked on a laugh as Hermione shook her head, distracted again with her interview questions. Ron went pink and sputtery. “Shut it, Harry”
Ron cracked a laugh, slouching into the visitor’s chair with a grin. “‘Course she has. Why not? They’re all so interesting, so original—”
“Yeah, ‘course.” Harry dug out a Galleon each for the three kids. Lily was ecstatic, but James just shoved it into his pocket with a sniff. His eldest son had the hood of his jacket pulled up and his sunglasses on inside. A year ago, Harry would’ve poked fun at James’s attempt at subterfuge. Instead, he cast a silent Notice-Me-Not over the whole group.
“I’m gray asexual, and biromantic,” Harry confirmed. His coffee mug trembled on the table, untouched, and Harry forced a firmer grip on his magic. Millie’s lips pursed. “I appreciate Millie and Flora keeping that private for me, for my family. But I’m not ashamed.”
to the new receptionist. I’ll get Morris packing up, and on her way before the eleven o’clock meeting is finished. But you owe me.”
“Malfoy’s known for over a month, but the divorce proceedings are underway and Pansy figures it’ll hit the press within the week.”
“My family was living in Morocco, at the time,” she went on. “I was only a child, you understand, but my parents were always great supporters of Dumbledore.”
In typical Wizarding style, the room was a riot of pattern and warm color. The walls were decorated with several animated paintings, but none with human occupants. Small mercies.
The first letter Harry knew about went to Luna Lovegood. Perhaps, Malfoy had felt safer starting out with someone like Luna. She was unfailingly just, uncommonly kind. Yes, she’d been kept prisoner in his creepy medieval dungeon, and yes, she’d been tortured during her stay there. But Malfoy hadn’t captured her, held her, tortured her himself… Harry didn’t think so, anyway. He’d never actually asked. The point was: Luna forgave Malfoy quickly, completely, and they’d been actual friends, after that. Harry didn’t think people made friends with their torturers.
Harry didn’t bother waiting for Pellimore to return, but sent off his Patronus to Spinnet. Her curly-horned ram returned quickly, speaking in Alicia’s worried voice.
“She really is. But she isn’t a history professor, and she’s planning to retire soon—apparently, she’s just welcomed her first grandchild, and she wants more time at home.” Hermione drummed her fingers against her belly with a sigh. “The special edition of the Daily Prophet, with all the essays and articles about the war, seemed so
“‘S all right, Dad.” James looked away, and Harry caught Rose sneaking glances at them both over her new glasses. “I gotta go, yeah? Find a compartment.”
They’re in the kitchen now. It’s mid-afternoon, but close enough to Christmas to be dark already. The window is a navy pit against the curtains Draco’s mother ordered from France. Apparently, all the best kitchens are French; Narcissa told Harry that, with a straight face. Draco nearly pissed himself laughing when he saw Harry’s expression.
“So, it seems to me,” Sol remarked, as if it were inconsequential, “that Lily is feeling very sad and upset. You, however, don’t agree with her reasons.”
Malfoy seemed, if possible, even less impressed with Harry. “How did I meet her? Are you truly that oblivious?”
No one spoke for a long, charged moment. Then Pansy went on, “I know you think he should've warned them. McGonagall, Kingsley... warned
Ron shoved Harry’s shoulder. “Shut it. It’s horrible. Rosie seems all right with everything, but I know it won’t be easy.” Harry cleared his throat, shrugging. Ron grabbed him by the bicep, pulling him to a stop just outside the Leaky Cauldron. “Harry. Are you going to be okay? Because I really can send Diamant. It’s the first year you’re doing this…”
At first, Harry’d been hurt—insulted, even—when Luna told him that she wasn’t willing or able to treat him herself. Harry trusted Luna. He knew she wouldn’t take all of his thoughts and fears and
“Hello Potter. And hello Teddy.” Malfoy leaned in the open doorway, arms crossed. He was dressed for the outdoors—for the rainy walk to Hogwarts, no doubt—in heavy black boots and a waxed canvas cloak. His beard had a few droplets caught in it, sparkling like diamonds.
Dumbledore settled back in his painted seat. “Last Summer, the third-floor corridor collapsed into the Philosopher’s Chambers. Structural damage, from the devil’s snare. Minerva and Filius needed somewhere to store the Mirror of Erised, and Severus suggested this place. Of course, it required someone with a little knowledge of Parseltongue to open it.”
“Astoria isn’t,” Hermione said thoughtfully. “She Sorted Hufflepuff. First in the family, I believe.”
“All set for the schoolyear, Lily Luna?” Harry’s brother-in-law wanted to know, adjusting silver spectacles on his long nose. Percy wore a three-piece suit under his Ministry robes, and sweat had gathered at his hairline.
The blonde woman noticed the state of him immediately, and distracted the children with several pairs of strange sunglasses.
“He was desperate!” Pansy snarled, leaning toward her across the table. Her painted nails slashed through the air as she spoke. “You’ve no idea what kind of Hell could have come through that Cabinet. The
“No, actually.” The bearded blighter finally put down his phone. Teddy shot Harry a long-suffering look. He couldn’t be sure which of them it was meant to shame.
, don’t you think? Almost fantastical. They made you sound like some sort of mythical knight, with a helm and a magic sword.”
“I won’t wait up for him, then,” Harry said. Angie hopped to her feet, planting a kiss on Hermione’s cheek and a pat on her round belly.
Red train, white steam, gray concrete platform. Platform 9 ¾ never changed. That was a good thing, Harry thought.
Lily’s hand was getting sweaty, but Harry had no desire to let go. He wished James and Al hadn’t run off so quickly. How long would Lily let him do this? Hold hands at Platform 9 ¾? James grew out of it in only a year. Albus never allowed it at all.
If Harry had access to a Time Turner, could he go back and make sure Ginny was here, on the platform? Could he stop her from flying that day? Keep James home watching
. It’s pathetic, and more than a little self-destructive, to be using the word ‘love’ for the first time only
Harry snorts, but it doesn’t dull the fury. He doesn’t have his wand at hand, but he doesn’t really need it. Pansy knows that. There’s nothing she can throw at him that he can’t throw back, tenfold. Still, she quivers with angry defiance and fragile hurt and… God, Harry has been silent long enough for the words to sink past his knee-jerk defenses.
James shook his head. “Rose helped me—” He stopped himself, eyes widening. “She won’t get in trouble, will she?”
People probably described Harry that way, too, which was a deeply unpleasant realization. “I must not tell lies,” he mumbled. His right hand flexed. Millie grunted in agreement.
Harry nudged her a little as the passed into the Great Hall. “I think you’re brilliant,” he told her, quietly and honestly.
Hermione mentioned you might want to meet up and get a drink or something? Seamus is knee-deep in that fraud investigation, but I’ve got time (if you don’t mind day drinking with an infant). Want to meet Emily and me at that pub near your place, the new one? Around three? Emmy has finally popped her first tooth through, so she’s fit to go out in public again. I thought the crying would never stop.
“They’re Aurors. They’ve wanted to be Aurors since they were kids, mostly. These fresh young things all grew up on stories of the Great Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived Twice, the youngest Head Auror in Wizarding history. You’re a hero to every one of them. It’s natural to be a bit star-struck, sir.”
The only letter Harry actually read was to Ron. It was long-winded, eloquent, but so aggressively civil that it made for difficult reading. It contained the words
“Professor Finch-Fletchley would like to offer a few additional field trips into Muggle areas,” she went on. “Portkeys would be required, as well as Muggle currency.”
Harry should offer to take her cloak, spell the mud from her shoes—all the tiny acts of wizarding hospitality that Draco has been trying, in vain, to teach him for over a year.
“You sent the Owls for Albus, Harry. You bought the green and silver doodads. You have as much reason as anyone to hate Slytherin House—more, maybe.”
“You want to ask me about the interview,” Flora said in a low voice, coming up on Harry’s childless side.
I’ve also Owled my interview questions to Grimmauld Place, for you to read through before we meet with them. Ron suggested it might help for you both to go in well-prepared. I’m still not clear on what Flora Bulstrode meant by ‘a conversation,’ but I doubt you and Ron will need to speak any more than you’d like. I understand Pansy Zabini is feeling quite nervous, so do try to be polite, will you? Your face can look rather scary when you frown.
As it turned out, Morris the Competent Receptionist became Morris the Cautionary Tale within a fortnight. Harry’s arrival every Monday morning signaled a deluge of Owl notes and interdepartmental memos, all jockeying for position in the assigned corner of his office foyer. Behind each door leading out of the hexagonal room, Harry and the four members of his administrative staff enjoyed a small amount of privacy and a whole lot of paperwork.
Angie shifted a little in her seat, as if she were suddenly uneasy. “Rumors. Nothing but whispers, and everyone’s always talked
“But we’re talking about it now,” she said, with the air of someone who’d talked about it more than enough.
“Including me,” he smiled. It didn’t feel wholly honest, smiling like that, but he gave it his best. “Now the nutters are coming out of the woodwork.”
“We have a minor infestation of flesh-eating slugs in the garden. The combination of peaches and muscovado sugar should prove appealing enough.”
“Hermione thought to call for the Ginger Calvary,” Millie remarked, and used her wand to light the tip of the cigarette. “I interfered.”
“Do I?” Teddy smiled at a weary witch dragging a crate full of school supplies and a very surly teenager. “Enjoy the school year!”
I’ve scheduled the interview with the Slytherins for five o’clock on Friday. Do you want to walk over together? Or would you rather Apparate? Molly and Arthur have Hugo overnight because I’m not sure how Ron will be feeling, or whether I’ll need to transcribe my notes. Would you like to stay over at our place after?
“You’re always on the toilet these days,” Angie scoffed. “And if I don’t tell someone about this right bloody now, I am going to explode!”
“He mentioned that you haven’t consulted him, Harry,” she said carefully. “He is the prevailing expert in combining Muggle medical treatments with Magical healing.”
Harry shook his head too hard. “No, Mione! It’s the finish line! Who will kiss the hands and shake the babies?” He rubbed his forehead. “Wait. What?”
“I know you’re doing the Sad Dad thing about your little girl starting Hogwarts. I get it. But think: No more Albus stomping about the place. It’ll be like banishing a boggart!”
The four Snakes packed up their things, and shook hands again with Hermione. The main dining room was empty, a lone witch wiping up tables and Vanishing crumbs. Harry pulled her aside to thank her for staying open late. “‘S nothing, Mr. Potter,” she said. “Thank you kindly.” She tucked the extra Galleons away in her spotted apron.
Harry’s magic pulsed and jangled inside him, spilling over with a smell like hot iron. He was a grown man, and an Auror. It was mortifying to lose control like this. He hadn’t lost his grip on his magic since—
Her husband hadn’t slept more than a few hours in days, so he patted her back listlessly and made a sympathetic sort of hum.
“My, yes. My great-grandmother—Sacharissa Tugwood, surely you’ve heard of her? The world-famous potioneer? She was a close, personal friend of Albus Dumbledore in their youth. A genius in her own right.”
“Potter! Pay attention.” Malfoy pointed a long finger at his own face. A gust of wind whipped his hair across his forehead. “White-gold hair. Pale eyes. Colorless skin. A natural gift for Legilimency. Bone structure which, on a woman, would probably be much more attractive.”
“That’s exactly my point! History is being rewritten, twisted into some kind of fairy story. That shouldn’t happen. People should know precisely what Voldemort did, and to whom, and why.” She was animated now, vibrant in her fervor. “They should know what we sacrificed to stop him, so they can prepare themselves. So no one like him ever comes to power again.”
“Ha. Neither.” Harry slumped into a seat at his kitchen table, laying his head down on top of his arm. The table was sticky. As was the inside of Harry’s mouth.
Malfoy ran a hand though his hair, and sighed. “I always thought you were rather thick, in school, but I’d convinced myself that was youthful jealousy.”
One year, he’d gotten an answer. A small, sibilant voice from the corner of the room. An adder, barely blinking out of its winter hibernation. Harry had caught it a few cave rats, in exchange for a grumpy chat.
Hermione. I didn’t want my friends to die. I didn’t want the Dark Lord to murder us all to get to Harry bloody Potter, who had never been anything but
Pansy never gave a single interview, not even to her own magazine. Theo was kind about Pansy in the press, Harry remembers. Very repentant. But Pansy isn’t the sort to forgive.
“Potter, sir,” she began, closing the door behind her and activating the Silencing charm. “You have to replace the receptionist.”
A few minutes later, Luna arrived on the platform with her towering twins. Their father, Rolf, was overseas on a research trip. The boys greeted Harry and Lily politely before drifting off toward their fellow Ravenclaws. The Lovegood-Scamander twins drifted pretty much everywhere. The entire family seemed to arrive places mostly by accident.
magazine,” Hermione said, flipping through her papers. “She’s a reporter, that’s all. And we’ll be signing a non-disclosure, of course.” She frowned. “Well. The rest of you will. Disclosure is rather the point, for me.”
“Let’s go over the plan again on the walk over, shall we?” Her hair was finished, and she had a thick stack of parchment in both hands.
“I know, Harry,” Sol soothed. “He knew that, too, which is all that really matters. But I think you’re forgetting the most important thing.”
Artie and Lily keep trying to sneak each other into their common rooms. Artie says it’s easy as anything to get into the Gryffindor commons (I could’ve told her that!) but Lily is always standing in the wrong place when she says our password. She keeps knocking on the wall and shouting. It’s so embarrassing. I think I’ll stick a dot of paint on the floor or something, just to make her stop.
Hermione sprung fully-formed from his memory, appearing at his side with a weary huff. She leaned into kiss him on the cheek, her lips a bit sticky with gloss. She was wearing a blue dress and no jacket. Mione had been overheated, non-stop, for the last few months.
.” Parkinson’s voice dripped sarcastic fury. “Don’t try to tell me those twins didn’t deserve it! They left him there to
The first of September fell on a Sunday this year. Families, which might normally drive or Floo into King’s Cross Station on the first, would make a weekend of it. A little sightseeing in Muggle London, a little shopping in Diagon Alley, a chance to visit Gringotts or the Ministry or the secret Wizarding section of the London Zoo.
“Come on, boys,” Rose commanded. “I’m hungry.” The mismatched Slytherins trailed along behind her dutifully.
Hermione coaxed Al and Rose back over to Harry, and his middle child permitted Harry to hug him (a little too tightly).
“It just—it doesn’t make sense.” Ron shook his head. “You knew then that Voldemort was depraved. You knew he was a murderer, and a despot. Why try to appease him at all?”
“Dunno,” Al shrugged, as if the question were ridiculous. What was properly ridiculous was coming to London every year to put your child on a train, which would then drop him off at the station in your home town. The Malfoys lived walking distance to Hogwarts. Ginny mocked them so much for it that even Harry begged her to
“Why’re you here?” Al wanted to know; his voice was so quiet that Harry had to sit forward to hear him.
Millie’s dimple appeared in one cheek, and she squeezed her wife’s fingers. “Yous are welcome to ask again. If you need.”
“We were wondering, Felicity,” McGonagall called, drawing everyone’s attention. “Can we substitute a Muggle treatment for the prescribed Wideye Potion? Poppy’s not comfortable with the potential for a billywig-jobberknoll interaction.”
“I know!” Angie cried, her hands clasped. “Can you believe it? I heard it from Pansy Zabini just today. Apparently, she’s leaving Malfoy to
Harry asked Mione, once, how she’d ever gotten permission to use one to take extra classes. It was so ridiculous, so dangerous! But, of course, she hadn’t... at least, not yet. Future Dumbledore needed Hermione to have the device, because he needed Sirius Black to be saved. He went back in time—a series of small, clever leaps—and made sure she’d have it.
“You shut your mouth about Molly!” Harry shouts, and the teacups on the rack behind him shudder dangerously.
. At the expense of any other children. Powerful magic requires powerful sacrifice—you know that better than most.” His eyes flicked to Harry’s forehead, but didn’t linger. “The Blacks managed two sons, Sirius and Regulus, though I’ve heard it made Walburga quite unhinged.” Malfoy’s frown lines deepened. “My parents put all their eggs in one spoiled basket.”
King’s Cross Station was always busy, and Harry’s family always attracted attention. The powers-that-be put in the bank of Floos ten years ago, but Harry and Ginny rarely used them. Harry still got queasy when he traveled by fireplace. Wandering through a Muggle train depot dragging trunks and caged animals was odd, but doing it with several reporters and a small battalion of fans would’ve been insane.
“The Mirror of Erised shows us our truest desires, yes. And when we have them? It shows us nothing but ourselves.”
James got into trouble in the Great Hall yesterday, but I didn’t see what happened. I’d ask him, but he’s being a right git and I don’t want to start a row. (Don’t tell me not to call him a git. You haven’t been here. You don’t know.)
“It would... Well,” Hermione spoke up carefully. “It would be good to know your reasons. To have an explanation. For the book.”
While the children debated Hogwarts houses with their mouths too full, Harry couldn’t help scanning the café. It was a busy night in Diagon Alley, but Practically Perfect Pasties was only half-full. It was, in Harry’s opinion, the best quick-stop restaurant in Wizarding London. The food was delicious, the coffee and tea were properly brewed, and the décor never veered into truly eccentric. They did all right, especially at lunch when the Ministry flooded the Alley with orders, but Harry knew they could be doing better. They
Harry tried. He opened and shut his mouth, several times, until he managed to suck in a loud breath. There were tiny sparks of magic crawling along his forearms, up his fingertips, and he closed his hands into fists.
of it, you know. We’re meant to laugh. Blaise told him he should curse her knitting needles to only knit giant wooly cocks.”
“Right. Yeah, for tea. And Draco and Harry don’t really—” Teddy scowled. “They aren’t friendly. So. Makes sense Harry’d be upset, after that.”
“Hestia and Millie were a bit busy,” Parkinson sneered, “hiding all those underage students that McGonagall didn’t want on the battlefield.”
“Yes, yes, Felicity, a Spindle Curse. You’re familiar with the common remedies, one assumes?” Madam Pomfrey said in her crisp, professional voice.
Angie tugged on the cuff of her robe. “No, they were never together. Pansy carried a torch for him for years, I reckon, but they were never more than friends.”
They jostled and joked their way through Diagon Alley’s back-to-school crowd. Harry always liked watching the little witches and wizards with stars in their eyes, picking out soft new quills and shiny cauldrons. He liked to be a part of that wonder. Not enough to forgo a Glamour, of course; he’d gone for strawberry blond and bushy-browed this time, in hopes of blending in with an army of Weasleys.
, and people would love him. It made no sense. If Malfoy had that ability, surely he would’ve used it on everyone? On Hermione, or Ron? On Harry?
“You already knew,” she says, damnably calm. “As if Draco Malfoy could have sex with a wizard who wasn’t you? The press would know before he managed to cum.”
While Teddy scratched out a quick note to George, Harry got coffee brewing and put the kettle on again for Ted. It had boiled nearly dry in the younger man’s haste to warn Harry about the Floo. Then he sliced and toasted several pieces of bread, reheated some sausages from yesterday’s breakfast, and moved everything to the table with a Wingardium Leviosa. (
“You should get some lunch,” Harry said, pulling a little on one of Lily’s braids. “We’ll be here until tomorrow.”
“And what do you imagine the Slytherin plot is this time, Ron? World domination by way of caramel macchiato?”
The Elder Wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy, even if he never recognized it. Lucius Malfoy gave Ginny the Horcrux diary, and then (unwillingly) freed Dobby. Narcissa Malfoy, wary and wandless, lied to keep Harry alive. The Malfoy family never made the right choices for the right reasons, back then... but those choices were vital, all the same.
Lakshmi and I are planning to be in London for Diwali this year. Everyone’s going to celebrate at Padma and Nikesh’s place, since Parvati can’t get much time off work. It starts on Sunday, the 27
James didn’t respond to that, but he leaned all the way back in his seat. Teddy patted him twice on the knee, rising to his feet with a wince. He sat down in the chair to Harry’s right, sipping his tea. Then he said, “How do you break that Curse? True Love's Kiss?”
“Yes. Yes, of course. I’ll go and get him. Stay here? Take a seat on Lily’s trunk, that’s right. Even breaths, Harry. I’ll be right back.”
Madam Pomfrey ducked her head out of the office. “Spindle Curse, you say?” The woman had the ears of a House-elf.
“I met Millie and Flora through Dean Thomas,” Harry said, cutting off Hermione’s building argument. “Our kids go to school together. I’m sure you know that.”
It was the voice, more than his looks, that made Harry uncomfortable. Malfoy hadn’t spoken for six months after his release from Azkaban; that was common knowledge, widely reported. When he finally managed it, his voice was… damaged. Lower, hoarser, with a rattling quality when he tried to raise the volume too high. It wasn’t an unpleasant voice, not at all, unless you knew how much it’d changed. Harry had no idea what happened to Malfoy’s vocal chords while he served his term in Azkaban, but the damage was irreparable. Two decades later, the sound still sent a shiver down Harry’s spine.
Hestia sniffled a little, but set her jaw firmly. “Gemma Stevens. Half-blood. She deserves to be remembered.”
“It might be, if your family line didn’t depend upon a male heir for direct inheritance.” Malfoy made a frustrated hand gesture. “The old Wizarding families weren’t any more progressive than their Muggle counterparts, and they had magic to ensure Their Will Be Done. Blood magic, very ancient. Very stupid. It was particularly idiotic for the Malfoys, as we have so much Veela inheritance swimming around in our gene pool.”
Harry turned his back to the avidly watching dining hall, closing off their conversation behind a quick Muffliato. “Had a meeting with the Headmistress about James. But nothing to worry about.”
Pansy hangs her own cloak, humming thoughtfully. “Draco Malfoy is the most beautiful man in Wizarding Britain—”
He did not do those things, because that wasn’t how time travel worked. He couldn’t make his own history untrue. He couldn’t rewrite his failures, correct his own wrongs. It would be easy to hate the weakness in that. So tempting to prune out all that pain.
“Hello,” Scorpius said, climbing easily onto a tall stool at the long front counter. “Is Artemis ready for school to begin again? Do you think she and Lily will be in the same house? We’d welcome them in Slytherin, to be sure! Lily seems very excited. I didn’t attend the London primary school myself, of course, but Albus said it was entirely different from Hogwarts.”
“It is, after all, my job.” McGonagall nodded toward the door, picking up her feather quill. “Be sure to keep an open mind, out there, Harry. Change may very well be in the wind.”
“I’m going to go check in with McGonagall,” he announced, as everyone looked up at him. He scrubbed a hand through his hair. “Erm, just want to go over a few more things. About James.”
“We’re going now,” Harry said, dropping his nametag in the bin under the counter. “Back in an hour or so.”
Ron and Parkinson were deep in the middle of an argument. Harry could feel the tingle of Hermione’s strong Silencing spell, a bubble of magic wrapped around the room. Hestia and Flora held hands, almost like children, and Millie refilled both their cups with a quiet Aguamenti. Mione’s parchment spilled over with neat little notes.
Brown-haired Hugo barreled into Hermione’s hip, making her stumble. “Mum! I have to tell Tad about the fanged geraniums!” Harry’s eye followed a pointed finger down the platform.
“They won’t serve Father, anyway, or me.” Scorpius patiently pried Rose’s fingers loose. Al had his glasses off as he rubbed at his temples. “You know how it is. Perhaps they’d sell to Mother now?”
The Author has been tweeting like a maniac again, and while I can't claim I'm surprised by her comments, I find I can still be disappointed. As a writer, I sometimes wrestle with letting go of the worlds I create once the project goes to print. I think most of us do. I understand that for fans, also, it can be difficult to see our Hero Authors expose their flaws. It can feel like it tarnishes the book, and the characters, and the part of that story that lives in us, too.
He was leaning back against the scratchy brick wall of the café, counting his breaths as the shaking in his hands slowed, when the rear door opened again. Millicent walked out, glanced at Harry with a wrinkled nose, and found her own patch of wall to prop up.
Flora arrived with dinner at the perfect moment, because Harry didn’t really want to listen to Scorpius Malfoy complimenting Albus on his looks, when those looks were a time-delay replica of Harry’s own. It made him feel squirmy.
Flora’s eyes were wider than Harry’d ever seen them. She kept shooting glances at her sister, and her wife.
“Waking up Sleeping Beauty, are we?” The speaker was a voluptuous witch in deep purple robes. Her hair was dark, her skin quite pale, and she had full red lips stretched in a bright smile. She moved in a practiced, rolling sort of gait that could be only partially attributed to the very high heels on her boots. Harry could see black lashes fluttering all the way across the room.
Hermione sniffed primly. “As I’m sure no one here intends to spill one another’s secrets, we needn’t worry about that.”
“What could he say that would make it all right? More all right than it is, I mean? We were only twenty. I’ve had a long time to get over it.”
She sighed, and her shoulders slumped. She slowly melted into her seat, head in both hands; it was so out of character that Harry nearly reached out a hand to steady her.
frowning), but there was a glint of humor in his eye. “Perhaps you’d like to walk me over to Poppy’s office? I haven’t seen you since Scorpius left for school.”
with these little blighters, I wonder? I’ve had a word with the boys involved, and I’ll keep my eyes peeled for more problems.
“True, which is why these are only rumors. Just because a bloke turns down offers doesn’t make him bent.” Angie sipped her tea and shot Harry a sharp, knowing look. “For that matter, accepting offers wouldn’t make him straight, either.”
Harry considered walking away from Malfoy. He wanted to. His ragged, sardonic voice made something inside Harry feel molten.
Ted sent Harry a vaguely apologetic look as he followed Malfoy out the door. Harry looked around at the mess of his letters, at the bright purple stationary Teddy’d been reading from when Malfoy arrived. It smelled like lavender perfume. Harry crumpled the flowery parchment in his fist, and dropped his head to the tabletop with a groan.
Harry hadn’t heard it in a long time (years probably) but he thought about it now. Not that getting a letter from Malfoy when Harry was still wearing Chudley Cannons underpants would have
“Yes. Millie’s right, please ask,” Flora offered. She sounded steadier now, and her eyes were strong. “A second-year Ravenclaw died in that basement. Falling debris. She was only twelve.”
“Oh, be fair, Harry,” she scoffed. “When it comes to Draco’s aptitude, you seem to require reminders.”
Flora and Millicent had realized something was wrong. They stepped in front of Harry, forming a line with Luna and the chattering kids. Closed ranks. Hermione returned so quickly with James that Harry wondered if she Apparated them both.
“You’re giving us too much credit,” Flora flushed. “We didn’t want to be torturers, or murderers, or spies, for Circe’s sake! We wanted to stay alive. We wanted to get out with our skins and our souls intact.”
didn’t you just talk to me in McGonagall’s office? Why d’you always have to make a bloody dramatic entrance?”
But Pansy doesn’t react much, beyond folding her hands on top of the battered table. Harry wasn’t dating Draco yet when Theodore Nott cheated on Pansy with a Ravenclaw girl just out of Hogwarts. It had been the scandal of the year—
Pansy and Blaise Zabini stood with their two sons, Massimo and Taddeo. They were all wearing black. Massimo was seventeen, in his last year at Hogwarts. He looked very much like his father—elegant, expensive, terminally bored. Shrewd little Tad wouldn’t start Hogwarts until next year; he went to the primary school with Hugo.
Millie was a bit teary, watching her wife. She laced their fingers together, and Flora came back to herself enough to squeeze. “Millie and Hestia were in a totally different part of the castle,” Flora went on. “Professor Vector sent a message to someone outside with her Patronus; that’s when I realized how large the Death Eater forces were. I pretended to search for Hestia, and Vector got agitated. She—she hexed me, just for spite.” She curled her empty hand into a tight fist on the table, and her lips went white and thin. “That was when Professor McGonagall arrived. Vector immediately went after her. She forgot about me. I—I thought about running. I
The gravelly voice from the doorway wasn’t precisely familiar, but it was unmistakable. It sent a short, sharp thrill down Harry’s back. Harry was scowling before he’d even turned around.
“Was Malfoy seeing a therapist after the war?” Harry asked, suddenly. “Is that why he wrote those letters?”
Harry glanced over his shoulder, toward the corner where Artie had a wad of paper napkins, attempting to de-cream Lily’s ginger ponytail. Al and Scorpius had their black and blond heads bent together nearby, whispering furiously.
Harry was watching when Al, Scorpius, and Rose came through the main doors. He was watching when Al noticed Harry at the professors’ table, and still watching when his middle child rolled his eyes to the ceiling with a sigh. He risked a small wave.
“I’m really glad,” he said. “We just—Scorpius is such a great kid. I’m sure the next will be wonderful, too.”
I don’t know if that helps, but the pain and the memories become separate things, eventually. When I think about Hannah, even about the final stage of her cancer, I usually smile.
“I told her I knew where Hestia was hiding. I led her toward the Transfiguration corridor. I couldn’t be sure we’d find anyone who could help, but I knew Hestia was nowhere nearby. That no one I knew would be there, and so they’d be safe when things went pear-shaped.”
He pressed a dry kiss to her temple and sighed. “I support you in all of your endeavors, and I wish I wasn’t doing this today. Or any day. I can feel both things at the same time.”
Ted and Harry, however, were properly starving. They made their way to the Great Hall with Lakshmi and Neville. Teddy quizzed Neville enthusiastically on the Hogwarts gossip, while Harry hung back in restful silence. Lakshmi took his elbow to descend yet another staircase.
“Things are fine. I can be civil with the man, and have his kid at my house, without trying to reconcile every shitty piece of our shitty history.” Hermione made that sound again, and Harry groaned, “What?”
Spinnet had been at school with Harry—a Gryffindor Chaser, and classmate of Fred and George—and she’d joined the Auror service straight out of Hogwarts. She was a life-long friend of Angelina. She was a member of Dumbledore’s Army. Harry knew Spinnet about as well as he knew anyone he wasn’t currently related to, but the look on her face now (“embarrassed rage,” Harry couldn’t help but call it) was entirely new.
The entrance hall had been rebuilt, with muscle and magic, into a near-perfect replica of its pre-Battle grandeur. Two decades of hard use gave it the illusion of history. Stone floors echoed against plaster walls, lined floor-to-ceiling with whispering portraits (some restored, and some repainted). Hundreds of candles filled the space with warm light and the scent of beeswax. It should’ve been comforting, Harry always thought, but it still made him melancholy. It was so close, nearly perfect, but it wasn’t the same. As they bypassed the Great Hall, continuing down the corridor toward the headmistress’s office, Harry kept his eyes forward. He had no desire to get caught up at the Memorial Wall.
“Gryffindor was hurting for options our year, mate. It was you, or artistically-inclined Dean, or pubescent Neville, or Seamus blowing shit up left and right. Or the Boy Who Barely Passed Potions.”
Harry’s mind skittered and skipped over thoughts of Malfoys, and divorce, and illegitimate children. He didn’t let himself linger.
“Grimmauld Place is closed to visitors!” he shouted back, in an attempt at authority. “Please come back during operating hours!”
“He wanted to kill you,” she admitted, without sympathy. She wrapped both arms around her stomach. “A lot of people did, it seems.”
“We had no idea what was going on,” Hestia said. “We were cut off from news. We couldn’t even hear the battle from that far below, and the castle's defensive magic interfered with our own.”
Harry grinned. “Thank god for lesbians and Slytherins. If you or Flint were susceptible to this Savior nonsense, I’d really be on the broom without a wand.”
“Okay,” Ron said agreeably. “I don’t want to break bread with Harry and Parkinson—at the same time, together—on that day either.”
“It is a school. A site for international meetings, and a research facility. And a home, for professors and staff as well as students. Hogwarts serves many functions, as you know well.”
thing finally cracks Harry’s ribs open at the kitchen table. He sobs. It’s messy, and noisy, and so completely unlike him that he thinks he might’ve actually lost his fucking mind.
“Mate,” Ron said again, with a flat look. “Don’t be a prick. You know she’s got the whole thing plotted out on rolls and rolls of parchment. Who to interview, and when—what order makes sense, you know?”
“Can’t wait!” Angelina Weasley yelled back, dropping her bag at the front door and taking the stairs two at a time. “You’re sitting down anyway, yeah?” Harry followed his sister-in-law up the stairs at a more sedate pace. She still hadn’t acknowledged his presence in what was—no, really, it
“He’s rebuilt the Malfoy fortune single-handedly,” Angie agreed, smiling a bit wickedly. “An odd looking bloke, isn't he? But he's good on a broom.”
Ron paused to give Harry a long look. It wrinkled his brow and pursed his lips, and Harry’d become very familiar with that expression over the past eleven months.
The silence sat heavily around the table for a long minute or two. Hermione seemed lost inside her own mind, perhaps reviewing and discarding questions she’d meant to ask. Finally, she came back to herself and broke the stalemate.
. Even Roxie’s acting like I’ve got a disease,” James ranted, trembling with it. “Like watching your mum die is contagious!”
As with most things medical, Harry found himself in a cycle of hurry-up-and-wait. Hurry out of bed. Wait on jump after jump of Apparition. Hurry to Hogwarts. Wait on McGonagall’s explanation. Hurry to the hospital wing. Wait on Draco bloody Malfoy. Of course.
Teddy helped James check his potion bottles for tampering, under the watchful eye of Madam Pomfrey, and then sort them into a locked cabinet. James pleaded exhaustion, too tired for luncheon in the Great Hall. Harry thought he was telling the truth. James
,” she sneers, shaking her head. “These aren’t strangers on the street in Diagon Alley. They aren’t Rita Skeeter, or her pathetic sycophants. This is your
Malfoy shrugged elegantly. “I believe it’s a rather common hobby for Veela descendants. She talked my mother into joining her birdwatching club.”
“I still don’t understand why we have to do this in a public place,” Ron said as they crossed another side street. “Feels fishy.”
. I’ve been trying to talk them ‘round since day one. I don’t let them talk shit about Draco in front of me—”
Harry reached out, but James smacked his hand away with a snarl. “I can’t walk, and I can’t fly, and Mum is dead. She is
Harry turned. Shards of broken bottle had embedded themselves into the wall, sunk deep through the violet paper.
Dumbledore looked over his spectacles, eyebrows up. “The last time you looked in the Mirror of Erised, Harry, you saw a way to keep on living. Forgive me, but… I rather thought you might need the opportunity again.”
“D’you think Artie knows how to get into Gryffindor tower?” Lily wanted to know, pulling Harry along beside her. “James and Al told me all about it. I haven’t told Artie yet. What if she gets lost?”
“Why?” Harry said, and it was blunt enough to startle Malfoy for a moment. His gaze skipped across the curious little faces surrounding them, and he scowled.
Hestia shook her head. Ron tapped his fingers on the table. Parkinson sipped her espresso silently. Millie crossed both arms over her chest, and Flora chewed on her lower lip.
“You know I love Victoire,” Harry argued. “She’s a good person, and very intelligent. But she doesn’t take your feelings seriously, Ted. You know that.”
Harry shrugged. “We couldn’t keep it trimmed for years after that. Mine used to do the same thing, when I was young.”
“Draco would have done something to drive you away,” Pansy says. “He needs to see—” She bites down on her lip, and Harry leans toward her on his elbows.
, with his reading glasses and his slithery silk pajamas. Maybe he’s on the living room sofa, curled up, exactly where Harry left him. Is he drinking? Is he crying?
“‘Course it is, it’s Mione,” Ron rolled his eyes. “Why she can’t just take her maternity leave to sit around rocking an infant, eating crisps, I’ll never know. But she’s hit the ground running with the whole idea—”
Dumbledore didn’t respond, but he did not interrupt, either. Harry knew a portrait wasn’t a ghost, and that a ghost wasn’t a person. Not really. But he also knew that whatever remained of Albus Dumbledore knew Harry Potter better than he knew himself. That was what McGonagall meant, wasn’t it?
Harry sighed. “Some of the other boys, Sam included, were trying to steal James’s pain potions from his trunk. James and Rose put an anti-theft Curse on the bottles.”
Thanks for writing back. I hope your week has improved, now that Ron’s back at work. Although, considering we lost the Broom-Race Finals to India
At George’s side was Harry’s godson, Teddy Lupin. George hired Teddy right out of Hogwarts, and they’d been working together for three years. He was easy to find in a crowd since his hair color was frequently electric blue. He’d pierced his nose once and his lip twice, and the hoops were stark black against his pinky-pale skin.
Harry watched his daughter fly up the center aisle of the Great Hall. She wore Gryffindor robes and a big grin, her hair in two braids tied off with that looked like neon-colored telephone cable.
Harry didn’t have the space inside his head for that concept. For the idea that eleven-year-old Malfoy had been able to
Harry wonders if this is what relief feels like to him now: This syrup-slow release of breath, the careful unclenching of his jaw. A nerve twinges in Harry’s neck, and it skitters and sizzles all the way through his fingertips.
Pansy nods. “Gregory had reservations about the two of you. To put it mildly. He only got the chance to voice them once.”
“I’m considering another fundraising effort,” the headmistress was telling him, “as a benefit for the Muggle Studies department.”
Parkinson cracked a helpless laugh. “There wasn’t a power on this Earth strong enough to convince Draco to kill
Hestia stepped outside into the dark to Disapparate, while Millie and Flora took the Floo back to Diagon Alley. Hermione and Ron followed them to the fireplace; Ron held Mione’s arm as she climbed into the hearth. Pansy Zabini sat down to wait for Blaise near the front door.
“Would that were true…” Harry grumbled, dropping his face into his hands. He looked up again, leaning his chin on a palm, elbow resting perilously close to a cold cup of tea. He pulled out his scuffed pocket watch, and cringed. “It’s half after ten.”
Sol met Harry at the bright green door of the clinic, smiling. He looked his patient up and down over stylish spectacles. “You look dreadful. Best get in here.”
Harry left the Ministry early with Ron at his side. His brother-in-law was leaving for Sweden the next day, but he insisted on a few hours wrapping purchases. The International Portkey left brutally early, and he hadn’t stopped complaining about it all day.
