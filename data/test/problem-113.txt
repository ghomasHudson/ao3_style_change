“I don’t really know. Not to find someone,” Harry lied, “and certainly not to dance. I’m awful at dancing.” That part was true. Harry drank deeply from his whiskey. He turned his head minutely to get a glance at Malfoy. He was staring at Harry’s throat as it worked on swallowing his drink down. Malfoy caught him looking and straightened up.
“Oh, mate” Ron sighed, gripping his shoulder “To be fair, none of us knew about it, except Pansy, I guess he just thought he couldn’t get the position there. But, er, are you alright?”
Draco squealed loudly, pulling Harry up to pull him in a hug, he was crying already, tears soaking into Harry’s shirt, but he didn’t care, he kissed Draco’s cheek as they pulled apart “
“I heard it” Hermione chuckled softly “Honestly, I’m not surprised since Draco got the same after-sex hair like Pansy”
He was startled to see Astoria, Astoria Greengrass right in front of him, she still looked the same as before, but she seemed more mature “I can’t believe you’re here”
. Draco moaned into the kiss and one of Harry’s hand intertwined with Draco, squeezing it tightly while his other hand sneaked down and stroke Draco’s cock, the blond cried out in pleasure into the kiss and came, shooting everywhere on his trousers and the ground. He heard Harry letting out a low growl and shot up the hot fluids inside him, his body spasming, his hand was still holding Draco’s tightly.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, the mirror looked exactly the same “It’s the same, there’s even a sentence engraved in it, something…
Draco whined, his hands reached for Harry’s hair and gripped on them while Harry swirled his tongue around inside Draco, he squeezed on the blond’s arse, pushing them apart so he could go in deeper. He broke away and replaced his tongue with his finger again, this time he pushed in two digits, scissoring and stretching Draco out as he got back to attacking the blond’s chest, making as many marks as possible, partly he wanted to show people that Draco was his now, and partly also because he couldn’t resist Draco at all
“Hi, Molly has already agreed to take care of Scorpius for us all night” Harry pulled Draco’s up from his seat and sat in his chair, tapping on his thighs as the blond laughed at his husband. He settled down on Harry’s lap, his favourite seat and Harry immediately took Draco’s hand. Winter was just starting and Harry would always worry about him like this “Are you cold?”
“I know” Potter said after a moment, he let out a quiet breath and continued “It’s okay, you can tell me about it whenever you’re ready”
talking with the snake, half naked and only has his shoulder holster on, his body shiny because of the lotion.
“I sent him the stuff” Pansy quickly replied, pulling the guy’s hand so he’d stand next to her “It’s an emergency and he doesn’t have any clothes for…this kind of thing so I had to sent him my old robes, which I had to go home and find”
“There’s no seat left” Ron commented while sucking on an Acid Pop, which Blaise also bought for him “
Draco pleaded, his hands grabbing at the sands as water kept hitting his body. Harry draped Draco’s legs over his shoulders, his hand found the blond’s twitching cock and started stroking it “
“Is this necessary?” Draco rolled his eyes at Potter and crossed his arms over his chest. He decided to spend time here because of his own reasons “I want to study so I can graduate, it’s just a waste of time going home. And you, why are you here? Aren’t you supposed to be with the Weasleys right now?” And another fact was that he didn’t like how his Manor felt, it still reeked of deaths there. Draco couldn’t shake off the feelings and he would sometimes have nightmares there, so he didn’t want to go back, and fortunately his mother understood him.
” Harry’s eyes widened and he spun around to see Draco on the other side of the open door, his hand clutched tightly to the doorknob, he was shaking, his eyes were teary and his nose was red from all the crying, even his cheeks were pink. He was in his robes, it looked like he was just at a fancy event earlier
“You can, but, but don’t squeeze me too much” Draco answered, watching Potter slowly came up to him, draping his arm over the blond’s stomach, with his head rubbing against Draco’s shoulder, his leg on top of Draco’s “Potter—I mean Harry, I’m not the Draco you know, I mean, I still am Draco, but not the person you know” He said, his thoughts were all in a blur. He wasn’t sure how to explain it to him
“What’s wrong?” Potter asked and he turned around, the Auror only has a towel wrapped around his waist, with water dripping from his wet hair down, his hands were drying his hair with another towel, Draco looked away and didn’t answer. It seemed like every hot guy just has to walk around half naked now.
Harry could hear Ron shouted over the music to Pansy, but he ignored it once the guy before him pushed Harry’s legs open and placed his hands on Harry’s shoulder again. He pressed his body close to Harry’s face, raising one of his legs and gently sliding them down Harry’s crotch, making the Auror grunted low. Harry looked up at the guy as he continued to brush his leg over Harry’s crotch, he tried to hold himself back, he couldn’t touch the guy, as much as he wanted to. His knees were shaking, and he was pretty sure he was sweating already, maybe because it was summer, maybe because it was from the heat of getting a lap dance from this guy, he couldn’t think clearly.
He said, covering the mirror but as Harry approached him, the Gryffindor pulled him away from it. When Draco looked at it again, it was still the two of them but they’ve stopped holding hands. At first, it looked like it was just their reflection, maybe Harry wouldn’t notice it, but the two of them in the mirror looked slightly different. Harry’s hair was less messy in the mirror maybe due to Draco’s impact there, and they both have small silver bands around their ring fingers, exactly like the promise ring the other Harry gave him back then.
!” Ron yelled, embracing him in a tight hug and let him go quickly, the redhead was clearly pissed “Oh no, where’s my beer?”
“Yes, Draco” Harry stood up, pulling him by his waist until their bodies were flushed against each other. Draco wrapped his arms around his boyfriend’s neck, ghosting his breath over Harry’s lips.
“Almost” Draco whispered quietly when Potter walked to their table with a bright smile, this time the git was wearing one of those Hawaiian shirts and shorts, it was both hilarious and infuriating at the same time
He was nursing his fourth martini and watching Potter from across the room. The dark-skinned seeker was wearing a set of exquisitely tailored black robes but his hair ruined the entire look, black curls sticking out every which way. It should have looked ridiculous but it didn’t. Draco was still glaring, when one of the Turtshill chasers came up behind him.
He needed to get back on a broom again so that he could prove to himself that he could. If he could turn his greatest failure into a success once more then he could move on. So he took the meeting with Phillip Moore, and the next day he was informed that he got the job.
“Good luck today, Malfoy,” Potter spoke as he gripped Draco’s hand in his own. Draco met Potter’s eyes but didn’t respond. His victory would speak for itself and
The next few days were a bit of a blur for Draco. After the Puddlemere match, he grabbed the half-empty bottle of vodka he had stashed under his bed and began to drink. Unfortunately, his alcohol stores were running a bit low, and Draco needed to get good and properly drunk. He tore apart his wardrobe, looking for the perfect outfit before settling on an expensive black turtleneck, a set of sleeveless black robes, and his favourite pair of trousers. He completed the look with a few sharp strokes of eyeliner.
“Mr Malfoy, what do you have to say to those in the Union of European Quidditch Associations who claim you are only here because Harry Potter took a step back this season?”
did that. His magic had finally manifested. Draco took advantage of the resulting chaos to slip away unnoticed.
“And me, they called me cursed when the Wasps lost every single game the season they signed me. So you see, all of us were unwanted in some way before Mr Moore took us in.”
“Its primary use is in a nasty little sleeping draught, not at all unlike the Draught of Living Death. Perhaps you would like to grab a few of your classmates and show them?” Dubois asked with a smile.
As a second-year Draco had Latin, Herbology, and Astronomy added to his schedule. Among his new classes, Draco was most excited about Herbology. He had enjoyed the time he spent in the gardens both alone and with Thomas, but he was eager to do some gardening of his own once more. He had helped his mother cultivate a few magical plant varieties back at Château de Sancerre, though he had been too young to do much more than dig some holes and drag around a miniature watering can. He hoped that herbology would help him feel connected to her in some way.
As bad as things had gotten after his father’s funeral, this was worse. As the days turned into weeks which turned into months, Draco lost any hold he had on the outside world. All that mattered was where the next drink was coming from. And the moments in between, the small slivers of sobriety, those were agony.
Draco yanked his hand away and picked up the letter. The bird pecked at him once more, looking for some treats but Draco just shooed it away.
He opened the package at once, inside was a miniature cake decorated with flowers from his mother’s garden. There was a note as well,
A few months into Draco’s rookie season he finally met the famed Harry Potter. He had actually seen Potter at the opening gala at the beginning of the season, but they had not interacted. Potter was constantly surrounded by his own personal fanclub. The Tornados weren’t scheduled to play Puddlemere until December but most of the league was in attendance for the equinox dinner, a charitable event hosted by the British and Irish Quidditch League every year.
As that thought crossed his mind Draco felt a deep pain of self-hatred. Was he really so shallow that his inheritance and legacy meant more to him than his freedom? Yes.
With everyone back at school, Draco noticed more than a few second glances at his improved appearance. But the real test would come with the first rankings of the semester, if Draco was able to make it into the top ten that would probably be enough to gain him some notoriety.
Draco, who had been doing his best to ignore Potter and focus on the game, couldn't help but turn his head at that. “What?! Of course not.”
He sat at the back of the hotel restaurant snacking on a sandwich and reading about the adventures of a magical chocolatier in a small French village when he heard his name. Looking around the restaurant he caught sight of Krum seated with his coach and manager. They were all facing away from Draco and speaking in rapid Russian.
As they took to the air, Draco couldn’t help but admire Potter’s skill on a broom. All the grace and poise that he lacked on the ground he had spades of in the air. Draco shook himself out of his trance and began his hunt. His eyes scanned the pitch as he avoided the chaos of the other players. He had begun to develop a mental map of the field keeping track of everyone else’s movements and predicting their plays.
The next day Draco felt like shit. He had barely slept, which was hardly a new development, and he couldn’t even keep his hands steady as he got ready in the bathroom mirror. He poured out four little orange pills into his hand and swallowed them without any water. He didn’t take the pills every day anymore, usually just game days or days when he really needed to focus, but without them he just felt adrift. He had noticed that it took more of them to get him through the day than it used to, just like it took a few more drinks before he could get properly drunk.
Once he was sure that the other boys were otherwise occupied, he took out the heavy envelope. He revently ran his fingers across the address,
The other guys laughed. “See, so don’t worry so much about fitting in Draco,” Harison paused so that Draco could correct him on the name if he wanted, he didn’t, “you’re one of us already.”
but you have been here all of two hours and you have no idea what you’re talking about. It has been over four years since the last time you saw me and suddenly ‘you are concerned’ and ‘I need help’. The truth is,
The 2000 European Cup was being hosted by France with the event taking place in Paris. Despite growing up in France, Draco had never been to Paris. He was excited to see the sites and do some shopping over the course of the three-week competition.
, that’s a fancy looking cake. I can see why you might turn your nose down at this stuff if this is the kind of food you’re used to.” He reached a finger in and swiped it across the pastry. A small pop left his lips as he sucked off the frosting. Draco was frozen in place, afraid that if he moved even an inch the emotions would come pouring out of him. The feelings that had come with the gift were still there but they were slowly being overtaken by a rising anger.
This was ridiculous. Draco’s life was ridiculous. But come Monday, Draco stood in the corridor outside of the conference room pacing. Why the fuck was he so nervous? It was simple. Apologize for being such a dick, offer to make amends, Draco squeezed his hands into fists, but what if Harry didn’t forgive him? And that was the crux of it, wasn’t it? Harry was so kind and generous and full of forgiveness. Draco didn’t deserve Harry’s forgiveness, but at the same time if Harry rejected him now he wasn’t sure what he would do.
“Yes, but not when they steal my boyfriend away from me. Why can’t you just study with me? That way we both improve our grades and your handsome partner doesn’t feel so neglected.
“Oh yes! Well, Ibrahim had a private chef but around day four we were all getting tired of the same cooking. I had a real craving for seafood specifically this one restaurant in Noirmoutier,
“Let me make one thing clear,” Draco projected his words so the whole room could hear. His accent was perfect. “My current circumstances, while unfortunate, are not permanent. It would be best for everyone involved if we just agree to stay out of each other’s way.”
It took some time, but as the season progressed the Falcons continued to win more and more. And it wasn’t just Draco - the whole team was playing better than they had at the start of the season. They didn’t win the League Cup but they did manage to claw their way to the playoffs for the International Quidditch Tournament and from there they somehow made it into the knockout phase.
Coach Pharo spoke a bit more on his expectations for the season and the first couple of games in the schedule before everyone mounted their brooms. It was an easy practice, everyone readjusting to each other after the break.
He opened the letter immediately and read it through twice. It was an invitation to tour the Chudley Cannons training facility and an offer to play with them next year.
Once the sun got low on the horizon Draco would go inside and clean himself off before reporting to his father. Somedays his father would dismiss him without a glance, but Draco found that if he kept his father up to date on his studies he drew less attention overall.
The one aspect of the Lycée that Draco was dreading was the integrated classes. Draco’s classmates had become increasingly girl obsessed, and even in the Collège it seemed half their conversations revolved around the subject. Draco shuttered to think how much worse it would get now that there were actual girls to talk about.
“Well, the rumour was that the two of you absolutely hated each other, but from the way he’s been staring at you all day I would be inclined to guess the opposite.”
“The château your father left you in the Loire Valley. They won’t follow us there. I have enough pull in the Ministry to protect us from that.”
The rest of the semester went by fast. Draco made number one in the class, as he knew he would. And in the quidditch final, he made the game-winning catch beating out Beauxbâtons’ star seeker, Victor Leclère.
Supper was a bland meal of roast potatoes and stew. Draco felt a sharp and sudden craving for Melrose’s lamb chops as he sullenly picked at the plate. Draco had been in a daze during the campus tour, but now anger and frustration festered under his skin.
He must have spoken that last question out loud because Harry answered it. “You made it to the final against Krum. There’s no way I would’ve missed that.”
That night Pansy did in fact show up and in addition to the new cosmetic charms she taught him, she also brought along some creams and potions for his skin and hair. They spent some time discussing their different beauty routines and Draco taught Pansy the charm he used to keep his fingernails perfectly manicured.
Potter was breathing just as hard pieces of dark hair sticking to his forehead. “Fair enough Malfoy. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow then.”
“I’m aware,” she spoke with a haughty tone. “Unfortunately, the women’s bathroom always has a line after lunch and I refuse to wait fifteen minutes for the loo when there is a perfectly good empty bathroom right down the hall.”
Pansy waved a hand as if it was just a matter of semantics and continued to inspect the apartment. “I was able to keep tabs on you through the papers before, but if you aren’t going to write me I need to check in on you myself.”
“Sorry, Malfoy, you left so quickly I didn’t get the chance to tell you ‘good game’...” Potter trailed off as he took in Draco’s appearance fully. “Have you already showered?”
He knew the Malfoy name might raise a few eyebrows but the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters were old news. The war had ended almost two decades ago and You-Know-Who was dead. Draco remembered hearing something about the last Death Eater being caught years ago (well last confirmed Death Eater at least). The man had been hiding as a literal rat for over a decade, but he was eventually caught, tried, and sent to Azkaban. There was a rumour that somehow Harry Potter had been involved but he would have been twelve, maybe thirteen, at the time and Draco didn’t put much stock into what the tabloids had to say.
“We deserve free desserts” Draco shrugged softly, digging his spoon into the soufflé. Harry looked at the way Draco ate and remembered the first time it happened. It was one of their weekly dinner as friends, they have been friends, for years now, it was no longer strange for the world to see them together anymore, but no, they were
“No, you didn’t” Potter laughed and stood up, before Draco knew it, he was running along the shore to get away from Potter, who was trying to catch him
can I speak to you for a minute, please?” He could see Potter flinched, his back facing Draco while Weasley snorted and smacked Potter’s back before walking out, and now there were only two of them in the room
“Yeah, he’s the most caring person in the world, that was what I thought when I was there” Draco said, smiling without knowing. All his memories there came running back to him “I tried to keep myself away from him, but he still got to me”
” Harry widened his eyes, his hands clutching on the table when Draco started rubbing the bulge between Harry’s legs, the blond smirked and licked a spot under Harry’s ear. He was lucky enough to have the table covering his hand, so it just seemed like he was putting his hand on Harry’s thigh
it. The blond shrugged and turned around, sitting on Harry’s lap, kneeling on the chair of the booth so that his knees touched the chair and his thighs wide open. It was a weird position, but if he put his feet on the ground, it would be hard for him to ride Harry later, not that he was thinking about it
“Alright, moisturiser” Draco said quickly, reaching for the bottle in his makeup box, his eyes never locked with Harry’s. He squeezed some out into his hand and started rubbing it on Harry’s face, he managed to only look at the git’s lips, or forehead, but not his eyes
” Ron winked at Harry before disappearing. Harry exhaled loudly and walked up the stairs, since Draco has a date, he didn’t have to cook dinner for two as always, he figured maybe he could take a shower and finished some paperwork left from today. As he strolled in the hallway, he could hear the low humming of Draco, the blond has a habit of humming songs while he was in the shower, he loved that about Draco. Harry quickly grabbed a somewhat dry towel up from his bed and got back to the hallway once he heard the door being opened.
” Pansy gasped, her hand rested on her chest, she took off her jacket and fanned her face “This is so surprising, why am I suddenly hot?”
“You keep saying it, but do I ever listen to you?” Potter cocked his head to the side, grinning at the blond “Plus, you aren’t that heavy, it’s like I’m exercising anyway”
“I said I was sorry, Granger” Pansy huffed out loud while sitting down on the floor, pushing books into the shelves
“Enough to say yes again” Draco smiled, leaning on the wall in his Healer uniform, there was a tinge of pink on his cheeks and he folded his arms across his chest, tilting his head to the side “And what you said was beautiful”
“Seems like you two are still very much in love with each other” Lilian said with her hand holding her cocktail glass, he somehow had told her everything that happened, but it was a way shorter version since they only got a few minutes to talk “I think Harry still wants you back, no matter what he shows, and you too, want him back as well, no matter what you tell others”
” He moaned, the breach was a lot to him, he bit on his lips while Neville sucked on his neck, leaving marks for the next day “
“I mean, you apologised to almost everyone in Hogwarts, even Ron and Hermione” Harry pointed out, his arms folded on the table “Even Katie Bell. Why did you leave me out?”
“Look, I know it’s hard” She cupped his face and looked up at him “Draco, look at me” She mumbled, and he finally locked eyes with her. He didn’t go out of his house for a reason, it was simply too hard “I
“Yeah, she wanted to surprise Hermione” Draco looked at the path filled with candles that led to their dinner table, there was even a violinist standing near there, prepared to fill the place with music
” The blond broke the kiss off and they both looked at the door, it was his mother’s voice “Can I come in?”
“Thank you, come on, Eddie” Luna received the boy from Ginny’s arm and brought him into the room nearby while the others set up the place
“Oh, I think you’ll get to talk to her” He said when he realised Astoria was pointing at Lilian. Draco got shivers running up his spine when he felt like someone was looking at him, but when he looked around, he didn’t see anyone. He shrugged the feeling off and concentrated on Astoria, maybe he could matchmake the two of them, who knows?
“Hey” Draco turned around when Harry called him, they were about to go on a date when Harry got a call
?” Draco asked and then they both turned right at the corner the guy just came from. Draco was shocked to see a normal-looking redhead guy and a blond girl running to them.
“I never like him” Rose frowned deeply, folding her arms together “I don’t get to play with uncle Draco anymore because of him” She pouted, Hermione had told him about it, Draco didn’t get to babysit Rose as much as before and always got an excuse, and all of it were about Brandon “I want you with uncle Draco”
?” Draco let go of his fingers and asked innocently, his eyes starry and full of desire. Harry huffed out a breathy laugh and picked Draco up again, feeling Draco hugging him tighter as they went up the stairs, maybe they could take a shower, or a nap, or ready for the next round. Harry could think of a million ways and places to do Draco, but now, Harry only cared about being with him, nothing else matters anymore, because there was only one thought engraved in his mind right there and then…he
“Sorry, force of habit” Potter said, stopping himself from putting more food in his tray “I can’t help it”
“Okay, well I gotta find a few more books, wanna come?” She asked but he politely shook his head, he already got enough books on his side now. She left quickly and he moved to the spot next to Weasley
“If you’re worried about my hands, you should give me your gloves instead” He let out a dry laugh, a joke was always a good way to diffuse an awkward situation, but when he noticed the gleam in Potter’s eyes, maybe a joke wasn’t the best idea “That’s a joke” Draco really hoped he wouldn’t show up next time with a new pair of gloves in a box.
Harry blurted out when the guy swayed around and began swirling his hips around. He even bent over so low, Harry could see his round arse and his lace knickers, tempting the Auror even more. Even the pair of arse, it seemed
“No, uh, I was alone, I…I wanted to be alone for a bit. I kept flying, trying to search for something, I don’t know what I want to find, but, er, I just feel like I’m missing something” The blond was taken aback again by what Potter said, because it sounded like him. Potter didn’t look at him anymore, his eyes glued on their feet on the floor. Draco held his wand tightly and raised his arm up, pointing it at the Gryffindor’s shoulder.
“Oh, sure” Draco said, and that was the last words he said that night. Harry paid for the both of them, they walked to Draco’s place in silence, the cool wind slapping Harry’s face like it was telling him to do something, he couldn’t anyway.
“Stop saying sorry, would you?” Luna chuckled and broke away from the hug “It’s alright, don’t think much about it”
“Only that?” Draco smiled at him, clutching on his bag and waiting for some other answer “We can still hang out if you want to, we’re friends, right?”
boyfriend, was cheating on him with the guitarist in the jerk’s band, no wonder he always told Draco he was
. I’m so sorry” He grabbed the man’s arm and led him to a bench near the escalator “Okay, sit down, here, here”
“Fine. If you are just going to lie…” Draco began to walk off but stopped as an idea came to him. “Maybe I’ll just ask your mom what’s going on with you. I’m sure she’ll tell me.” It was a bluff, of course, Draco hadn’t spoken two words to Thomas’ mother, but maybe this would convince Thomas to tell Draco himself.
Blaise switched topics, “You know those witches across the bar have been staring at you this whole time?”
Draco blushed. Were he and Harry really that obvious? First Blaise and now April? “We were friends until I went and fucked it up,” Draco admitted. “I tried to make sure that he would never want to speak to me again.”
Draco stopped reading. His father was dead. He froze for a moment staring into space before calling down to the front desk and ordering a bottle of Calvados.
Draco lunged for the wand and Harry dodged. Draco tried again with no success. Soon enough he was chasing Harry around the house. They were in a standoff now, Harry tried to make a feint to the right but Draco saw right through it. He grabbed on and brought them both down.
Tibby cried as Draco hugged her for the last time. Melrose was a bit more stoic but emotional all the same. Draco would miss them, all of them. They had been his friends, his family, for so long.
“And the doctors told Cole,” making this Harison, Draco thought, “that he would never walk again after he took that bludger to his knee and tore three ligaments, but here he is.”
Sometimes Draco was too clever for his own good. He turned around slowly and walked back over to where Thomas stood.
“It was pretty amateur of you. I might’ve even though you threw the match if I wasn’t so sure that your Gryffindor pride would let you do no such thing.”
“I’ve always thought I would fit into hell quite nicely. Plus, I haven’t used any of my vacation days at work. I’m sure they could survive a couple of weeks without me.”
The classrooms were located on the second floor and contained no decoration. Just rows of wood and metal desks lined up in front of a chalkboard. Mr Barker informed Draco that they had thirty-six boys ranging from ages six to sixteen, and classes were a mix of instruction and independent study.
He did his best to feign interest when the topic inevitably came up. The other boys were content to go on and on about their own crushes and it was easy enough to just play along. Eventually though, they began to ask if there was anyone that Draco liked. Whenever it would come up, Draco would just shrug it off and deflect the conversation but he knew that was a tactic that wouldn’t last forever.
There was also the issue of spending money. Draco wouldn’t be able to buy weekend robes, extra sweets, books, or toys which would make it harder to make friends. He didn’t care what a bunch of muggles thought of him, but it would be different with other wizards. He would have to find some other way to make a good impression.
Harry shoved him over anyways and wrapped himself around Draco. Draco was feeling much too pliant to put up much of a fight.
That night they were both a bit buzzed, though not quite drunk. Asim was insisting that bowtruckles were actually evil incarnate. And offered the one encounter he had with a bowtruckle as proof.
girls. He just didn’t seem to understand them. The only girls he had ever really interacted with, besides his mother, were teachers and house-elves.
The celebration when they got back to Beauxbâtons was just as big as the party at Durmstrang. Though unfortunately, Draco didn’t hook up with anyone. Instead, he drank copious amounts of alcohol and basked in the praise of his peers. Pansy even indulged in the merriment though she explicitly told Draco not to let this “jock nonsense” go to his head.
Fall turned to winter, and winter to spring. Draco watched from the sidelines as the other boys spent time with their friends, played games, and developed inside jokes. But that was fine, Draco didn’t have time for friends anyway. He was too busy with school, and once he was number one they would all be begging to be his friend.
Draco awoke before the sun. In truth he had hardly slept at all, excitement buzzed through his body. The day was finally here, he was going to Beauxbâtons. The night before Draco had packed all his things and set out his clothes for the day, so he was downstairs and dressed within minutes.
By the end of the day, Draco was feeling quite frustrated and more than a bit angry. Beauxbâtons was meant to be the place where he found his equals, his peers, but he had spent the day receiving rejection after rejection. The magical community was small and he had no social clout. Most of these boys had grown up with each other but Draco was an outsider, an unknown entity. If they didn’t want to be friends with him, fine. He didn’t need them anyway, he had never had friends before and he didn’t need them now. He felt the tears welling up in his eyes and scrambled to find his wand. Draco tried to cast a silencing charm around his bed, but he couldn’t get the spell to work so he resigned himself to crying silent tears into his pillow as he drifted off to sleep.
He also got more pills and started taking two or three a day - sometimes more. It was the only thing that kept him from drowning in the sadness and self-pitty.
Draco stood up. “A break? Really? If you don’t have the guts to break up with me properly, I will do it for you. Goodbye Asim, we’re done.”
Draco winced at the volume. “I just needed some personal time. I won the match so what does it matter?”
This year had been one of the best so far and Draco thought it could only get better from here. He had Pansy now and Professor Dubois, and his specified classes were all extremely interesting.
“Now might not be a good time to tell you this, but that’s where my neighbour’s dog likes to do her business.”
Draco was beginning to accept that was something he was never going to have. The friendships that he had seen depicted in his books must be something extremely rare, that is if it existed at all. Instead of developing true friendships, it seemed that most people just pantomimed the idea of “friendship” with each other to give the appearance that they were not alone.
“Yeah, I remember it” Potter smiled at him and looked back at the sky “That’s why I made the chocolate shaped like the Ravenclaw Tower for you, it’s kind of…our spot, right?”
“Oh yeah, I opened it by mistakes, of course, I was going to find Harry’s computer because I borrowed his, I found yours instead. And
“Er, I wasn’t mocking you” Potter said and Draco looked up at him “I just, it’s a funny story, I was going to give you this” He showed the box to Draco when the blond reached out to grab it, Potter pulled the box back, perhaps he wanted to say something first. Needless to say, Draco was still in complete shock “I…I was laughing because I just told Ron and Hermione that I was going to give you
tell you about him. I told you I know a guy who’s really nice, and that you’d like him, but that’s also the night you introduced your boyfriend, well, now he’s your
?” Draco purred into his ear, stroking Harry’s length softly, his eyes twinkling. This made his heart raced, he was excited
“You were the one who bought it” Draco whispered with a smirk on his lips, not only did he taste like strawberry, he also smelled like coconut and it definitely drove Harry crazy, the blond finally pulled his towel off, his hand traveling down Harry’s twitching length that has been poking him “Maybe next time, you can eat it off of me” Draco teased him playfully, his hand stroking Harry’s cock gradually, smearing the precum everywhere
“Yeah, Draco, wouldn’t want people to think you’ve changed” Pansy eyed him with a raise of her eyebrow, it was subtle. He shouldn’t let people know he wasn’t the Draco they knew, it’d just cause consequences later.
“Sorry, Harry” Neville said before shoving a brown paper bag down on Harry’s head, blocking his sight, Dean and Seamus tying his hands together behind his back while Blaise was doing the same with his legs
“Nope” Draco put his hand up, cutting off Hermione’s words “I don’t want to hear about him, the cruel bastard”
Draco cried out and just stopped making sense at all when Harry thrust in faster, hitting the spot Draco had mentioned about, driving the blond mad and yearning for more, based on the way Draco was creating his own marks on Harry’s back right now. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s hips while the Auror embraced the blond in his arms, it seemed like their bodies fitted perfectly and was working in sync. Draco arched his back and let out a loud sob before his body shuddered and the next thing Harry felt was fluid hitting his stomach, the blond’s entrance tensing and tightening up, unleashing all of the will power Harry was holding as the Auror kissed his
“Hey, isn’t this an article of me in our graduation?” Harry showed him a picture of himself giving the speech at graduation and Draco yanked it from his hand again, putting it back in the box and closed it.
Ron was nervous, he was sweating again, he sweats when he was nervous. And how so? Because he was going to pose with a dragon and Blaise will take pictures of him, Ron could barely function when he looked at him for too long, now he has to stay like that to do this photoshoot for Pansy. Pansy was a good friend, but she was crazy.
“Well, it’s not much, but, does Blaise, er, has he ever bought things for you?” He asked, fidgeting with his fingers, he was nervous, Draco could tell “Like food, stuff”
, we can explain to them that they have to kiss one another!” Hermione grinned at her, showing her small dimples “You and me, Blaise and Ron, Ginny and Luna, Dean and Seamus, we’re all married couples, Neville and Theo just got together so they have to kiss, so that obviously leaves Harry and Draco together”
“Hey, not that” Draco turned around when he heard Hermione scolding Pansy, taking the Firewhisky bottle from her hands. Somehow both of them have become chaperones of the party, although Draco suspected Pansy wouldn’t be doing the chaperone much. Everyone was gathering at the Great Hall, where any Professor can come in any second, so they might as well behave nicely. It’s been an hour and so far, no one has thrown up, that was a good sign. It was supposed to be a party for them after the N.E.W.T.s, the graduation ceremony would happen at the end of this month, meaning it would happen exactly on Harry’s birthday, one week from now.
“Yeah, I think it’s something I’m destined to do” He said, he could sense the tone from Potter’s voice, he was determined “I feel like I should save people, I think I enjoy the feeling. When I’m out there, I feel all…excited in my stomach, and when I fight the bad ones, it feels good”
He began licking away the chocolates, his hands pulling Draco’s trousers down and throwing it on the ground. With the wave of his hand, Draco felt a cold flow of magic in him. Harry slid his fingers over Draco’s rim as his mouth was still latched on the blond’s skin, sucking off all the remained chocolate. He put one of the strawberry on Draco’s nipple in his mouth and sucked on his bud, twirling his tongue while his finger pushed inside Draco’s lubed hole.
Draco turned around and walked backwards when he couldn’t run anymore, he breathed out heavily and couldn’t stop laughing “Potter, please, I can’t ruin this outfit with water! It was an
” He said firmly “You did this for me, and I want to do something to make up for it. Absolutely anything!”
“Yes, Harry, I love you too” He said without a doubt, they have said those words to each other a week after they moved in together, spilling out at the same after a kiss, and it had led to their
“Interesting” Draco said, smiling to himself but the smile soon disappeared when he saw two figures rushing towards their way. It was Ron and Harry, they were still in their Quidditch uniforms, but Harry was bleeding from his head. Draco freaked out, his feet moved before he could control it
“Are you thinking about how hot Harry is?” Hermione startled him with the question and Draco scoffed softly at her. Next to them were Luna and Fleur, indulged in some topic related to magical creatures.
“So, darling” She smiled at him reassuringly “Every relationship has its ups and downs, and I may sound like Hermione right now, but even I know it’s true, and I
” Draco yelled when a burst of flames shot up from the fire, he backed away and fell on his couch, setting the smoke detector in his apartment off, it started ringing loudly, making Draco panicked even more
“He could run away” Harry said, grabbing his quill and looking at Ron, leaning his cheek on his hand “He’d be freaked out and then he’d move out, and it would ruin our friendship, and I would lose him”
I could use some sleep” Pansy yawned, stretching out her arms and leaned her chin on Granger’s shoulder, it’s been hours since he got here “Come on, darling, you should sleep, it’s late”
“So I might as well say this before I become a coward again, Draco, I, I like you, a lot. I have been, for years, maybe even before the night we fucked. And if you’re going to stay, I want to ask you out, but, er, if you’re not, then…I want to be with you every second until you leave again. I really want to, or else I’ll just regret it so much”
“I thought I could help, your father unfortunately is still having an attitude” She said, placing the boxes down on the floor and casting a spell to make them big again “I’m glad you and Harry are done kissing”
“Me? Er, yeah, Seamus wants everyone to go” Harry said, scratching the nape of his neck, his ears were red, possibly because of the heat “I’m just hoping there won’t be anything too wild”
Draco couldn’t say anything as Harry took a step forward “Why are you staring at the Mirror of Erised?”
“That’s my cue” Ron smiled, standing up and looked at himself in the mirror again “Oh, and, you should…trust your feelings too” He said, winking at Draco and walked away. Draco furrowed his eyebrows and stared at the guy.
“That’s a good idea” Neville agreed with his husband and walked behind the bar with Theo “She’s a very good chef and Ginny eats for three people, so she always cook more than enough to eat”
“I am, I mean every word I said to you, to everyone” He said, it felt nice to admit to this. He clutched tightly on his books and looked at her
“You’re just daft” Ginny chuckled while leaning on Luna from behind. For those two girls, it began way smoother than Ron and Blaise. After listening to Harry’s advice, Ginny confessed her feelings at graduation, and they’ve been together ever since, Ginny became a professional Quidditch player, and she’d stay home to watch her and Luna’s kids while Luna was out being the famous Magizoologist “So, do you guys like it?”
“Oh, yeah, it hurts when I touch it, and it’s hard for me to move” Potter said, and Draco didn’t dare look up again. He has a fractured shoulder, Draco was sure, but he didn’t know why.
“Why would it be nice?” Draco cornered him with questions, he has to bring out some answers from him. They only have a few hours left at Hogwarts, he might as well make it memorable with Harry “Do you want me as a roommate? Or is it something else? You said we don’t need to see each other all the time after Hogwarts, and we’ll meet at St. Mungo’s only when you’re injured for real”
“Was the sex good though?” She took his hand off her face and asked, her big eyes staring into his soul
“I don’t know how to face him, if I ever go back” He confessed, the Potter here was so different, he wasn’t sure what to do once he has to deal with the Potter in his universe “We hate each other there”
“He will” Theo winked at him and stood up “Gotta find Nev, it’s almost midnight, I’ll try to find Pansy for you” Draco smiled as Theo walked away, fifteen minutes until New Year, and people were finding others to kiss at midnight, but Draco? Nothing, as expected.
“Don’t…don’t let the reality in my world affects your feelings, Pansy, I’ve got enough of it with Potter here” He sighed, rubbing circles on her back as the trio got back to the table
“So let tonight be the night that you finally tell him how you feel” Pansy was still next to him, she murmured a spell and a box flew in her hand
” Ron kicked Harry’s legs and they finally pulled apart “Wasn’t the performance in the bedroom enough for you two?”
“He thinks that just because he goes to work and I took a few months off to take care of Ariel that he’s the
“Not until Potter brings me my sunscreen” Draco huffed and looked around, there were quite a lot of people here, all of them were wizards, Blaise built these hotels and resorts so wizards and witches could still use magic without being caught by Muggles. He glanced at the girls, they seemed to be relaxed, even though they should be cautious, but Draco wouldn’t want them to celebrate their anniversary in fear either, he sighed and closed his eyes
“Well, I never told you” Draco winked at him and they both looked at the kitchen door when Rose opened and walked to their table with two dishes on her hands, followed by Blaise who was placing other plates on their friends’ table wandlessly with his hands
fight that made Blaise fall for Ron, because he wasn’t like anyone he had met before, He put up a fight and Blaise apparently dig that
“Fun fact” Hermione pointed her finger in the air as they walked through the coffee farm. The one she had planned, there were other tourists, even Muggles, but that wasn’t what Draco worried about “Money
Harry quickly stepped back and covered the bulge, the towel could barely trap it in. It amazed Harry how he could get hard without knowing and just by Draco standing so close to him “It’s just, you know, you were close”
“I’m not sure, I think some just want to hear Harry talk, they love him” Hermione shrugged, Draco squinted his eyes and left quietly as Ron asked Hermione about her summer plan. Draco finally found Pansy next to the table full of drinks and pulled her by her arm
“Oh…” Draco said. Was his intuition right the whole time? Should he say something? Should he let them be? “Thanks, don’t tell Theo that, okay?”
“You don’t look like yourself right now” She poked him repeatedly and tapped on his cheek “You left early yesterday, and this morning you didn’t even laugh at all the fun things we said”
“Fuck me, Potter” He said and quickly got attacked by those lips again, he felt another wave of charm flowing through him, he should have known Harry would be careful in sex too, his hand started slithering between the cleft of Draco’s arse. The blond whimpered when Harry started pushing a digit in his lubed entrance. Their kiss deepened as Draco parted his lips, inviting Harry in again, he seemed to forgot all that was happening right now, all he felt was the way Harry invaded his mouth and his finger reaching just the right spot inside Draco. The blond whimpered quietly when Harry pushed in another finger, scissoring them, opening Draco wider. And since all his senses were heightened when he closed his eyes, all he could do was feel, their voices mixing into each other with the sound of water. His knees threatened to give up when Harry pushed in the third digit, curling his fingers, making Draco hummed into their kiss.
Pansy, why are you getting all crazy about this? It’s just a date!” Draco tried to reason with her, but the date wasn’t the main point, Pansy was just furious with Harry because he won’t admit his feelings for Draco, that was what her rage was about “Calm down, Pansy”
Ron asked, Romilda Vane was lying on the floor, hands grabbing and legs kicking at something invisible, she kept shaking her head since Ron couldn’t guess what it was “Excercising?”
, and Pansy wants you to join your bloody party. If we don’t bring you back, she’ll kill us” Ron said as the guys carried Harry up in the air using magic “It’s your birthday, for Merlin’s sake, you should celebrate it”
“Hey, Granger invited us to Longbottom’s birthday party tonight” Pansy suddenly said, putting down her Witch Weekly and kicked Blaise’s leg, who wouldn’t put his book down. They were still waiting for the graduation ceremony, which happened only two days from now, and that also meant it was two days left until Harry’s birthday. He didn’t get him any present, since he was in no position to give Harry one anyway, they weren’t arch rivals anymore but they weren’t exactly friends either, it would definitely put them both in an awkward spot if Draco gave him a gift.
“Are you teasing me?” Harry mumbled at him, his eyes could burn Draco’s soul. The blond bit his lips and licked a stripe up Harry’s jawline
. The blond leaned back on the chair, he grabbed a small pillow before crying louder when he realised the jerk
“Maybe a little” He grinned at him and Draco leaned over to press his lips on Harry’s, sucking on his bottom lip gently and touched the nape of his boyfriend’s nape, a sensitive spot of Harry that he found out after a few kisses on their graduation day. Harry pushed him back until the back of his knees hit the bed and they both fell on the mattress without breaking off the kiss. He has his hands on Harry’s chest, sliding down his hard stomach, arching up to deepen the kiss.
“Boo hoo, anyway” Pansy leaned on Draco’s shoulder and sighed “Tonight, it will be a private candlelit dinner at the beach, then I will give her a silver heart locket necklace, I’ll have one too, it can be opened, and there will be the first initials of our names engraved in each other’s locket, you know, because she’s forever in my heart”
He latched on Draco’s collarbone, smiling to himself when he saw marks showing up after a few attempts of making hickeys. It was obvious that Harry was proud of what he did to the blond, red marks on his neck standing out nicely comparing to his pale skin, which made it looked even more stunning. He stripped off Draco’s blouse,
for us, but when you showed up in front of my door, with your eyes teary and your nose red, I knew I wanted to work it out with you, I didn’t want to quit and end it like that. We were arch enemies, then we were friends, and through a long period of time, we became lovers, that didn’t just happen right away, no, some people even think we took too long to realise we’re in love”
” He gathered more bubbles over to his place and heard another hitched breath from Harry, he must have accidentally clenched again “Pansy, just get out”
“You should play, you’ve been standing alone for a while now” She said, already pulling him to the group as he let her. She was right, he should be joining this.
“Er, your juice” Harry said, pointing at him and Draco looked down, he jolted and stopped when he realised the juice was overflowing out of the cup to the kitchen counter
“I’m thinking” Harry tilted his head down and whispered in Draco’s ear “I might just put you on that table and fuck you right there” He said, licking Draco’s earlobe, making the blond shiver “I will pour wine on you and I will lick you all over”
“You’re a good kid, Draco” She said, draping her arm over his shoulder and leaned on him “You’ll do great in the future”
He whimpered, he had to stop sucking to take a deep breath, the pleasure Neville was bringing to him was too much, it was unbearable, his untouched cock was leaking precum on the Auror’s chest
”I think it’s implied when I said the feeling is mutual, Potter” Draco chuckled and watched a light brush crept up Potter’s cheeks “I like you too”
“Who’s Brandon?” Ron looked puzzled when Rose replied to him, her hands swiping the tears off her eyes
Draco diverted his eyes and wasn’t sure what to say. Turned out it was just some kind of misunderstanding and he didn’t even know.
Harry started smiling at everyone, nodding and thanking people when they began chanting loudly his name, he never really liked parties
They talked for what felt like years, about everything, and Draco wasn’t sure why he was so comfortable telling Potter what he felt, his loneliness, his desire to be on his own, his secrets. Potter also spilled out his feelings, and he didn’t have a clue why it felt so refreshing to hear Potter’s stories, to know that he struggled just as much as Draco, and how alike they were. Draco didn’t want to know what time it was, there was something in him that didn’t want their conversation to end.
“Draco, are you ready for breakfast?” His mother asked while his father was still looking down at his plate. Draco unclenched his jaw and swallowed hard.
“Haley, hi, I’m Hermione” She shook Haley’s hand and sat back down again, Harry glanced at Draco and noticed the blond was gazing at Haley without blinking. Hermione nudged her wife and Pansy began “Where, er, where did you two meet?”
“Aren’t you a sweet talker?” Draco’s lips formed into a smirk but quickly fell open when Harry slipped his fingers back in Draco’s loosen hole, which was overflowed with Harry’s fluid, he pushed all of it back inside and pulled his hand out. What he didn’t expect was Draco catching his wrist and lifted his hand up in front of his face, his eyes gazing at Harry’s as he poke his tongue out and started licking the cum off of Harry’s finger, the Auror’s eyes widened and his still half hard cock seemed to know what Draco was thinking even faster than his brain, it soon rose up again. Draco licked a stripe of his fingers and swallowed them all in his mouth, his tongue working on cleaning his fingers off, but his eyes were hinting something else.
“I will never” Blaise said, murmuring in his ear “I never break a promise” He squeezed Ron tighter and kisses the spot under Ron’s ear, sending goose bumps everywhere
“Thanks” Draco said, heaving a sigh when Ron sat down on the chair “He has been hitting on me for weeks now, seems like he couldn’t get over me”
“My mother says you only do this kind of stuff to someone you love” Draco said softly “Mother used to do it for me when I was a kid”
“Go, hurry” Hermione waved her hand and Harry started walking after Draco suggested them going up. Even though it was awkward to have their friends seeing them half naked, it wasn’t really any surprise because Harry has already got used to their friends seeing them snogging before. After Harry’s 40
“Do you want to tell me what happened?” Lilian asked, her hand reaching out to touch his to comfort him “We still have four minutes left, if you want to”
“I really have to go, it’s late” He said, putting all this things in his bag, but when he tried to grab his book, Harry slammed his hand on it “Potter”
“Yeah, just checking in” Pansy hanged up the phone and put it back in the pocket of her pantsuit “She misses me”
“Harry, ready for work?” Ron elbowed him again, distracting Harry from staring at Draco eating. Recently Ron has been in charge of looking after Harry to stop him from doing things like this. After two years of living with Draco, Harry has come to an appalling realisation that he was madly in love with the blond. But he feared that if he told Draco about it, he’d reject Harry and probably moved out of the Grimmauld Place and the Auror definitely did
“I think it’s romantic” Hermione added “My wife can’t handle sappiness even though she is sappy herself”
“Stop smoking” Pansy scowled at him but Blaise didn’t care, until now, no one could tell Blaise to quit smoking
“Oh how I wish you could see yourself there” Draco mumbled so quietly that Blaise couldn’t hear. This won’t work, he needed another way to make them study together.
Lucius exclaimed loudly as soon as Harry finished his sentences, but Narcissa quickly silenced him with her hand raised. She looked at Harry, her eyes deep, Draco’s got his mother’s eyes, he felt as if he was being read from inside out
“Thank you, so, seven then?” Harry asked “I will pick you up then” He stood up and Draco followed him.
“With the help of Draco” Pansy added, Harry showed a soft smile, of course Draco knew what he liked, they used to have dinner every week before. Harry stepped back and headed to the loo, he needed to refresh himself, he hasn’t really sober up yet from yesterday’s party. Harry turned on the tap and splashed water on his face, nothing made a day better than seeing someone you love with someone else. Harry breathed out and looked at the mirror when the door to the loo opened.
it’s still the same” Draco walked in with his hand locked with Harry’s, as they entered the Room of Requirement once again. The Mirror of Erised was there, it looked exactly the same, but without the crack, just like a new mirror.
just save you from the fire” Harry grinned again, and Draco liked it, he really liked it when Harry smiled at him and showed his dimple “Do you want to?” Harry asked again, opening the door to his apartment
“He talks a lot during our lessons, but always about what we have to study. Once we’re done, it’s like someone put a Silencing Charm on him” Ron said, making his move as Draco smiled, he finally got Ron to share things to him, it was good
“It’s okay, Poppy, I like it here” He said, calling her by her first name like she had insisted after they have been working together for months now “You can visit the Headmistress, I can stay here to see if anyone needs me”
Thomas and Finnigan have already become a couple just before Eighth Year, so that was one couple he didn’t have to help to be together. Draco looked around the Great Hall, everyone was having breakfast. He has been making up with some kind of plans to matchmake a few couples here that had some potential, it took him a whole week just to plan all of it. His eyes stopped at Ginny, the person he had gotten so used to calling her by her first name, she was eating at the Ravenclaw table, next to Luna. They have been friends, and since she dumped Potter’s arse, she’s been sitting with the Ravenclaw, especially Luna, and that was something he need to pay attention to.
“I’m sorry” Pansy pouted, grabbing his chin with her hand and planted a kiss on his cheek “But honey, you
because you’re mad at Draco” Pansy said, receiving the bag from his hand “This has gone way too extreme, you two need to fix it”
He murmured when Harry stood up, Draco pulled him in and kissed him, surprising everyone in the pub. Harry quickly grabbed his waist, holding him close and deepened the kiss. He could taste the beer off of Harry’s tongue, he missed this, he missed being this close to Harry. When Harry’s hand slipped down to grab his arse, he realised they were in a public place and he just made out with the Chosen One. Draco pushed him away and examined the room, everyone was gawking at them with shock, the blond panicked and ran out of there as soon as possible.
“I didn’t mean it in a bad way” Potter leaned forward, but Draco stepped back, looking out at the window. He knew his hands were always cold, there was no way he could warm it up “Why don’t you just use a warming charm?”
to be a surprise party to welcome you guys back from your honeymoon” Hermione said with a serious tone, Harry was surprised to see that she didn’t give them a lecture first “I tried to say something but Pansy stopped me. I mean I can’t say anything because we were the ones that were here secretly in the first place” Hermione explained carefully and stood up to pull out a cake from out of the box on the table “Anyway, you can either go up and finish what you two intended to do or celebrate this first. Look, Luna even baked a cake, so, please put something on and decide”
“Where’s Pansy? She said she’d grab us another drink, it’s been more than half an hour since she left and no drink”
be a great help. This secret cannot be kept for long, Draco, you better find a way” She said, quickly finding her spot to sit down next to Granger.
“Alright, let’s get—…” Pansy stopped when the door was slammed open, Penelope Clearwater stuck her head in and looked at them with wide eyes
“You said you love uncle Draco” Rose stepped up and spoke, her hair was put up in a cute bun “I made everyone help”
“Well, for what it’s worth, I’m sorry” Harry said and extended his hand “Wanna be friends, again?” Draco looked at Potter for a minute before putting his cocktail glass in the Auror’s hand “Grab me another drink, Potter”
“Oh, yeah, I was just…boys’ night” Potter stammered, which made Draco wondered, but he shook it off quickly
we say these words” Ginny winked at them “Or else we could have just said what it really is, if you know what I mean”
“Really?” It was a bizarre thing to find out. Mirror of Nightmare, Mirror of Desire? What the hell was this? “I didn’t know something like that could happen”
, I’m alright, I was just followed by some creep, apparently he follows people around and jerk off behind them”
“No, no” Potter said, looking at the blond and stuttered the next few words out “Er, it’s your hand, it’s cold”
Draco made his last move, flicking the final chess piece from Ron’s side down on the ground, claiming his victory “
“Nah, I’m full” Potter shook his head and gave Draco another peeled shrimp “Plus, I can do this very fast”
“Yeah” Potter nodded “Well, back then I still thought Ron and Hermione would be together forever, but I also thought Ginny and I would be together forever too, things just didn’t work out, I guess”
He could hear people around him whispering and mumbling, but he didn’t care, especially when the guy stopped in front of him again and rested his hands on Harry’s shoulders, long, delicate fingers gripping on Harry, something tingling appeared in his chest as the guy started gliding his hands down Harry’s clothed body from his neck down to his thighs. Every movement caused Harry’s skin to react, and as the blond guy slowly squat down, widening his legs, Harry could see the dark lace lingerie underneath the skirt. He kept his hands to himself, gripping on the chair and trying his best not to get hard in front of all his friends for a stripper. The guy slowly stood up, his hands still on Harry’s knees as he twirled his hips from side to side to the music. Harry felt something again in his chest when he finally locked eyes with the guy, it was something,
“You’re smooth” Draco smiled, cupping Harry’s face and leaned down to touched their noses together softly “For your information, I want it too, with you”
“Why are there four glasses of wine on the counter?” Narcissa asked them and Ron realised he forgot to hide it. He rushed to the counter and grabbed a glass
“It’s just, er, I’m overwhelmed, yeah pretty much” Harry smiled at him, moving his arms around Draco’s waist and ribcage “You’re
“No, I’m good” Draco gestured and the girls nodded before going out, Draco glanced at the stupid git still sleeping soundly and his hand unconsciously touched Potter’s messy hair “You better not drool on my robes” Draco murmured quietly and trailed his hand down the sharp jawline of the Auror. He should
, I realised I liked him” Draco replied to Hermione with a blush “I stopped going up to the Tower, I avoided him until graduation, I avoided him in Aurors’ trainings” Draco sighed “It didn’t work, he still makes me…
“Anyone up for a drink?” Padma said, standing up and everyone following her. They should all take a break from playing this intense game.
” He babbled when the Auror started thrusting, he hummed softly, feeling Neville’s lips on his chest, Neville’s hand intertwined with his, pinning it above his head, and Neville’s hot cock inside him. His skin was on fire, sweats beading on his forehead, if he bit his lips any harder, he could taste the blood.
“I think so, he was sweet” Draco said, remembering all the sweet things the other Harry did for him “He was kind, he didn’t push me to do anything I wasn’t comfortable with, he always insists we sit together, we sleep together, he says he loves me every day. In the end, I just fell for him”
“Well, he’s nicer than before” She said, it was amazing how he could hear everything they said from where he was sitting “Plus, he’s one of the people with highest scores. Zabini is also good but he’s already tutoring Ron”
