As always, let me know what you think! I know it doesn't seem like much, but I promise I'm working towards an ending (and there may or may not be a little action involved). I'm just a sucker for domestic fluff, so that's probably why the last chapters have been much of that haha.
“It would be a lot easier if you just took it, you know,”  Adelaide commented. “The longer you wait, the more you’ll torture yourself.”
Draco rolled over in the bed, rolling away from Harry and sitting up, thinking about the events of the last few months.
Tonight, though, they’d have at least a change of scenery: after a few weeks of reduced contact, this was the first Friday where they were welcome for the usual weekly family dinner at the Burrow. Draco could guess why they hadn’t been welcome for a few weeks, and why the Weasleys had kept their floo guarded, and while he changed into loose-fitting trousers - he knew better than to wear anything tight to dinner at the Burrow - he wondered if Adelaide was pregnant yet.
“There. All done. When are we leaving?” Draco eyed Remus in a determined fashion.
‘Harry usually cooks for all of is,’ Hermione spoke, clearly trying to make conversation, beat the silence. ‘He’s a really good cook.’
Harry opened his mouth, and closed it again, looking flabbergasted. ‘That’s true bit still I – ’
Harry looked at Draco. Draco sighed. “Tiring, but, I guess… Yes.”
“Hey. It’s okay,” Harry murmured, stepping even closer and holding his mate close. “You’re safe now.”
Draco made that sound again, making Harry wrap his arms around the Omega and holding him tight. ‘We’re all dirty,’ Draco whispered.
His Alpha moved his wand away and Draco retched again, only spitting out bile now.
Draco turned to see the principle of Myrion, Pansy Parkinson, standing just a few feet away from them. It was the polite distance to keep when approaching Omegas who were accompanied by an Alpha.
Thrice.
‘I had no idea you wanted to bathe with Adelaide,’ Harry chortled.
“Potter,” Harry said. “We booked a room yesterday afternoon?”
‘Really…’ she whispered.
“Okay.” Lupin clutched the binder with paperwork even tighter, and started walking. A few steps in, Draco offered Lupin his arm, and Lupin took it with nimble, hesitant fingers.
Writing smut is so hard! When I write fluffy things it's not that hard and I can easily decide that yes, this is cute and fluffy, but when I try to asses smut (is this even hot? I don't know...) it's so much harder!
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Can you do without me for another two weeks, maybe more?’
Luckily, he didn’t have to wait for long. A soft knock – definitely his mother’s – on the door announced their arrival. For a moment, he panicked. No-one was here with him and he wasn’t allowed to speak if he hadn’t been given explicit permission to do so.
‘Such as…?’
“And how has that been? Was there anything that stood out to you, something you thought as different or strange about any of your recent heats? Right before, during or after?”
a turn-on, he barely dared to move, afraid Harry would notice his arousal.
(Poodle sneezes are so cute, don't you think? My poodle was sneezing all day and I nearly died of cuteness)
!” being called out before it clicked open. He turned his head towards the door.
Draco took the bag and attempted to smile back, unsure of what to say now.
Hermione shook her head in disapproval.
to get married?”
Harry chuckled. ‘Yes, I have to. Molly was angry enough that I’d bitten you like that – she gave me a whole sermon about pushing you into things you’re not ready for. It was pretty terrifying. I don’t want her to shout at me again.’
“Oh – OH. Gross.”
Draco shook his head. ‘No. But I… that night…’
Draco shook his head. “It’s not like that but... I get my hopes up every time I go into heat and... it’s just....”
“How’d you sleep?” Draco was prepared for the standard morning chat he and Lupin had every morning.
do,” Draco said, a little sharper than he had intended.
(Did you like the way I wrote Neville and Luna? They were hard to write!)
Leave me a comment if you'd like, they make me so happy! (Tell me what you think, your thoughts on "Roots of a new life" in general, how you feel about Riddle and whatever else you'd like to share!)
(although, writing smut it so hard! When I re-read what I've written I always wonder: is this hot? I don't know... But anyway, I've yet to receive complaints, so it's probably okay. At least, that's what I tell myself.)
“Taking care of Draco is currently my top priority, yes,” Harry confirmed.
Later that night, he and Adelaide cuddled close together on the coach while Mr and Mrs Weasley drank tea in the kitchen. Adelaide placed her hand on the bump on her stomach and he placed his hand over it. They were quiet like that a long time, until he broke the silence.
Harry sighed. ‘I know.’ He ran his fingers through his hair again, ‘I guess I’ll go talk to Robards and request a team to confiscate Parkinson’s personal files. Maybe I can convince him to bring her in for questioning as well.’
“Hungry,” Draco said with a chuckle. “Now that I’m not vomiting all the time, I’m hungry constantly. Mostly salty cravings.”
“Hmmm… sounds pretty awful,” Draco acceded and he rolled his hips a little, feeling Harry harden because of the movement. “How can I make it better?”
It took Adelaide effort to not squeal, but she kept her tone low as she whispered her felicitations: “that’s amazing! How long now?”
‘Yes!’ Draco almost shouted. ‘When I viewed your memories I could see it very clearly that you try to protect me from anything that could upset me, and you try to keep me as if I could break any minute! It was nice to be treasured like that for a while, but I’m a real person and I’d like to be treated like one too.’ He breathed out heavily, surprised by his own outburst.
“My chances were definitely worse than that.”
He read it thoroughly and highlighted whatever he thought was important to know, as well as making notes on things he wanted to ask more about.
. At least she had finished the job they’d brought her. The overall tone of it was friendly, but somehow Draco doubted that she had even tried to help Remus. He placed the letter back in the center of the paper it had come in, and took out the other piece of paper, thinking that its contents could not possibly improve the situation. It was a contract. The letters all danced in front of his eyes, and he closed them for a minute to help regain his focus. Upon opening them again, he searched for the gender clause in the contract. It was a well-known clause that was added to many contracts - it limited Omegas from being able to sign contracts without their Alpha’s permission. This contract did not have a gender clause. Had they forgotten to add it? Or had Hermione helped them out after all?
“He’s not sick,” Harry protested immediately. He did not see Remus curl in even more, trying to physically and mentally distance himself from the situation. He did not hear his breath quickening, the shallowness of it.
That was, until Harry’s knot started to swell and it caught on Draco’s rim every time Harry pulled out to thrust deeper, angling a little bit to make sure he hit that magical spot inside Draco every time.
The Alpha rubbed Draco’s back. ‘It’s okay, it’s okay…’
“What about that special announcement you promised, ma?” one of the Weasley twins asked - Draco could never tell them apart from each other.
“It’s a little like that, yes,” Remus confirmed.
Sometimes he’d write in his Omega-journal, which had been a gift from Harry during their courtship. The journal became linked to the Omega owner, who would be the only one capable of opening and reading the journal. It was for his most private thoughts and he found himself using it more and more these days, now that he had more things to think about and ideas to process.
Mrs Weasley smiled briefly, ‘yes, of course, Hermione had owled me she would visit for that.’ She was brought her wand back up, as if to continue her work, and then back down again. ‘Did you want me to come downstairs with you?’ She eyed him cautiously.
Draco blinked and looked at Harry, ‘yes?’
Instinct hit him and he whined, ‘will you?’
The dark hideout was lit up by spellfire in all colours, red, purple, yellow and orange from Harry’s coworkers, green, black and blue from the other side. It was chaotic, and Draco could not tell who was duelling who - or if that was even what he was supposed to be seeing.
Draco stopped, waiting, needing…
“Will do,” Draco answered, suddenly tired. He followed Harry with his eyes as he left the kitchen. When he was sure Harry wouldn’t hear him, he sighed deeply.
(See the end of the chapter for
A rustle, footsteps and a door closing.
Harry looked at Draco, locking their gazes together. ‘When we fight – ’
Harry cupped Draco’s face with his hand, letting his thumb stroke across the Omega’s face. “I do. From the day we met. And I met a lot of pretty Omegas back then. But you are the only one I want to come home to every day, the only one I could ever love.”
Unsure if she was friend or enemy, he said nothing as he followed her with his eyes.
‘I receive education from three tutors that visit me five days out of the week and…’
Harry moaned, pushing back eagerly, “this is a perfect start.”
Harry whipped his duvet cover aside immediately, his eyes fierce. ‘Hop on in then.’
She smiled encouragingly.
‘No! I would like it a lot if you slept here,’ Harry quickly interjected, ‘I just thought maybe…’ He didn’t finish his sentence, looking away from Draco.
‘So what do we do know?’ Draco asked.
‘It’s not over yet.’ Harry wrapped his arms firmer around Draco. ‘If you keep doing that you’ll be stuck with me forever.’
He looked up, only to find Harry looking at him worriedly. With some effort, he focussed on their bond and was surprised to find a mixture of shock, worry and some other emotions he couldn’t name.
I'd like to stress the fact that I am
“Well, you found me anyway,” Draco pointed out and he set his teacup back down. He let his gaze slide over Harry and took in the dishevelled sight of his Alpha; it looked like Harry had come here straight from his bed. Messy hair – though that wasn’t much of a change from the usual – hastily thrown on shirt and jeans and bleary eyes. Though he wanted to be annoyed with Harry’s appearance, he couldn’t help but think it was a little cute, too.
I also tried to put in some things about Harry's day-to-day life and place Draco within that, because, let's be honest, those two are going to end up together and why not have Draco explore the domestic life in Grimmauld Place a bit?
‘Oh.’ She looked around, as if trying not to look at Draco. ‘Is he nice?’
Four hours later, the couple was laden with gifts and they were struggling to push through the shopping masses on Diagon Alley.
‘I’ve got him in a few files.’ Draco looked at Harry, sniffing up the air, trying to see if he could pick up on his emotions like that. His ability to scent emotions was slowly improving now that he was not taking suppressants anymore, but it was still hard to discern the scents and recognise emotions. ‘Do you know him? Who is he?’
So now they stood on the edge of the Burrow’s wards, Harry holding both Draco and Adelaide tight, preparing for apparition. ‘Three… two… one…’
‘Okay. Sure. Apology accepted.’
‘Just – ahm… give me a minute,’ he managed to say awkwardly.
“Sure.”
Mrs Weasley raised her eyebrows. ‘I do not tolerate this kind of behaviour in my kitchen, Draco. Sit up straight and try not to look so cranky.’
“Really?”
“He didn’t fool me.”
‘I told you my parents died when I was young,’ Harry started, squeezing Draco’s hand, ‘Tom Riddle killed them – my parents worked for the Order of the Phoenix and – fuck this is hard – they… He thought the Order was the main obstacle to overcome. In one night, he tortured Neville’s parents into insanity and killed mine. He was arrested and put on trial for all that. He wasn’t supposed to come out of Azkaban at least for a few years.’
“I can take them for a little stroll around the water,” Remus suggested, pointing at the small pond that was across from them. “You’ll be able to see us the entire time.”
“I need to tell you something.”
‘WHAT?!’
He was back in Harry’s room. The light was dim, but he could see the outline of the two of them beneath the sheets. They lay face-to-face and his memory-self had snuggled up close to Harry.
“They told us probably nothing will happen the first few weeks. By the time my heat hits, we should be good to go,” he answered slowly. “But if it doesn’t work in one go, they’ll be giving me heat-inducing potions on top of these so I’ll go into heat about every two to four weeks until we succeed.”
There we have it! Next week's chapter is "pregnant" (I mean... could it have been anything else? haha)
Hermione looked up from her work and she seemed to be surprised to see Draco was alone. These days, it was strange to find him more than a few feet away from his Alpha.
Harry waited for a little while and then softly asked, “I saw the leaflets were about pregnancy... and two of the books, too.” He turned his head and pressed his lips against Draco’s hair, gently. “We haven’t really talked about having children. Is that something you want?”
Both and and Draco were quiet for the first minute or so.
‘It was no problem at all,’ Hermione said as the bowed with a flourish to Draco.
“… so, in short, I need some time off of work,” Harry finished.
He took a sip of water and then continued, “Nowadays, it can be stated that in general, most bonded Omegas are/can be satisfied with even the basic bond, and no other needs will occur. However, in the O-S bond, in about five percent of all cases the Omega feels a disproportionate need to submit to his Alpha. Other symptoms of such a situation are: an excessive need for attention, jealousy, hoarding, nesting urges and acting hostile towards others.”
‘I don’t know, he never claimed me.’ Draco stepped into the shower cabin and relaxed his muscles. ‘Oh sweet Merlin,’ he whimpered as he felt himself leaking, the mixture of cum and slick trickling down his thighs. It was an oddly arousing sensation.
“You’re good, you’re good,” Harry promised again, and he set his hips in motion, slowly at first but soon responding to his mate’s needy whines and pleas. Draco scratched against the wall, scrambling to get a grip on the slippery tiles when his Alpha became rougher. He let Harry cover him as much as the Alpha wanted, submitting fully.
Remus’ reaction time had slowed, half dizzy from his mate’s touch, but he managed to snag the lighter from Sirius before he could light a cigarette. “You can’t smoke here.”
comfortable like this, with Harry close. Come to think of it, it was really calming to have his Alpha this close. It made him feel drowsy… sleepy…
Draco breathed in through his nose, letting Harry’s scent calm him a little and then nodded. “You’re right. I’m being irrational.”
P.S. I'm not really sure about the title, I mainly picked this because well, I wanted to upload something and this was an easy title. I was thinking perhaps I could make the title a play on the HP book titles, like "Draco Malfoy and the curious case of Omega abuse" or something. If you have suggestions, please let me know, I'd love to hear them!
expect, Mr Potter?’
‘That’s it, just tell me,’ she cooed.
Harry’s breath hitched in his throat. ‘W-what?’
‘At three,’ Mrs Weasley specified. ‘But I see no reason why you couldn’t spend the day together,’ she added, when Harry moved to get up and leave. ‘We’ll be at home all day anyway.’
“Do you want that?”
Harry placed his hand against Draco’s forehead. ‘You’re already cooling down.’
‘You never told me…’ Draco looked at Harry via the mirror, still pressing his fingers against the bite mark.
‘I should only read things that apply to my personal situation.’
‘Thank you! My Alpha gave it to me,’ she smiled.
“I think it’s time for Alexander’s nap,” Adelaide announced and the awkward air that hung between Draco and Harry dispersed.
When he padded back to Harry in the kitchen, he didn’t dare look at the stupid stick. He tossed it in front of Harry on the table. “It says to wait three minutes,” he announced, and Harry cast a wordless tempus to count down.
“What did he do to you, that you don’t feel like I do?” he asked, face still downturned.
Draco looked at Adelaide, whose eyes were huge in surprise. She bent towards Draco, ‘an intimate courtship means that while you formally court, you are also together... intimately.’ It was a mere whisper, but judging by the way Mrs Weasley and Harry both tensed up, they’d heard it.
Harry never knotted him. In fact, he kept his trousers on during the entire thing.
‘I’m sure,’ Draco interrupted, not wanting to be rude, but he was so certain about it that he didn’t want to hear her objections. ‘I’ve given it a lot of thought and I… I love Harry.’
‘My name, Draco,’ was the sharp response.
Mr Potter stepped forwards and extended his hand. Draco stared at it bewilderedly. Omegas weren’t supposed to shake hands, they weren’t supposed to touch or be touched by anyone. Most everyone would bow for an Omega. What was he supposed to do now?
‘Oh, dear, what happened?’ she asked as she gently put her arms around him.
“You’re doing perfect,” was the rough response, “so perfect.”
She smiled at him and handed him the Prophet. He took it from her, trying not to let his hands tremble. It had been at least four months ago, the last time he had been allowed to read the newspaper.
‘Ah, yes, I see. Walk on straight ahead and feel free to pick whatever you like from the racks. Anything you like we can tailor to your every need.’ The Beta gestured inwards, to the store. It was definitely wizarding space, because from outside is had seemed really small, but it was actually quite spacious. Harry let go of Draco and gave him a little, encouraging push. ‘Go on then, find some things that you like.’
“No back pain? Sore chest? Headaches? Heartburn?”
‘You’re perfect,’ Harry managed and he pushed his heels into the matrass to gain some leverage, and then flipped them over.
I did make this chapter a bit longer though, and I hope you like it.
‘Of course not!’ his mother fumed, ‘he tried touching our boy and then he had to jump away because Potter had hurt him!’
The stranger wiped his face clean with a cloth, and although his expression remained neutral, Draco could feel his anger emanating and permeating the air. It made the hair on his arms stand up in terror, even as he was determined to not show his fear.
“I couldn’t even imagine what life without Harry would be like,” Draco said in a low, careful tone.
“Yeah, we’re fine. Why?” Draco rolled around to face Harry, crawling close to his warm mate.
‘Yes,’ Draco confirmed and he leaned into Harry as much as he could. Harry sighed. He let his hands wander across Draco’s body, ending with both hands on his arse – again.
Bella smiled. “I’m sure. How are you on the supply of painkillers?”
Harry laughed and he sounded relieved, too. “I can’t believe it’s mostly a matter of a set of potions.”
He stepped inside and was greeted by a friendly-looking Beta near the door. ‘Hello!’
Molly chuckled and left the kitchen.
“The ORO’s this way.” Draco pointed.
Draco mused over their morning rituals for a bit longer whilst making breakfast and was so lost in thought he never heard Harry enter, only sensing his mate when arms sneaked around his waist and Harry pressed his nose against Draco’s neck, breathing in deeply, scenting him. The intimate process of being scented by his mate still made Draco go weak, and he leaned more against Harry, knowing he could handle his weight.
‘No, miss Fawley.’
“That’s better, isn’t it?” Harry murmured from his side, bending forward to kiss him softly.
‘I’m sorry I don’t – ’
‘Harry Potter,’ he managed.
Adelaide clearly hesitated. “Well, I just thought...”
Draco twisted his body, pressing down against Harry’s fingers. “All for you,” he panted, “all for you.”
‘He was,’ Draco carefully confirmed. ‘And erm – it makes me feel off and uncomfortable. I don’t really remember what went down and then Harry dropped me off here and left and I…’ Tears welled up in his eyes and he tried to push them away,
“Tom Riddle,” Harry confirmed in a grim tone. “Finally dead.”
“Yeah, I know…” Harry casted his eyes downwards before looking at his mate again. “My parents were both bonded and married. I… don’t know, it seems… romantic?”
‘Okay…’ Draco said meekly, ‘but will you carry me?’
Draco sat down, looking at her determinedly. ‘I want to know if there are ways to induce a heat.’
Draco had no idea what to say, so he leaned into Harry and wrapped his free arm around the Alpha’s waist. ‘That’s terrible,’ he whispered.
Memory-Hermione stepped away from the fighting Alphas and left the floor. ‘This is where I left to talk to you,’ Hermione explained.
‘Have you been?’
‘What did you say?’ was the bewildered answer to that
‘Do people often do that?’ Draco asked, ‘and why did she say that about not being able to… you know.’
“We’ll head towards Crossroads first, for gifts for Molly and Hermione” he decided, looking at Harry for approval.
“It’s that or go out into the field,” Harry sighed.
Draco sniffed up her comforting, motherly scent. It made him feel calmer and more adept at taking decisions. ‘I… I think I want to talk about it with… Hermione.’
like Christmas, it smelled and sounded like it, too.
‘Pregnant, I know,’ she answered, but didn’t allow him to break his grip on her.
Harry slowed his fingers a little and kept on sucking, making soft, eager noises as he milked Draco dry. He very slowly pulled his fingers back and moved back up. When Harry made to kiss Draco, he moved his head away, so that Harry’s lips ended up on his cheek.
“Okay.” Draco appreciated the fact that Lupin used language that could not give away their situation. “I want yellow, I think.” He and Harry had decided against finding out the gender of their babies, so the nursery would have to be neutrally coloured. “It’s such a happy colour.”
Harry stirred something in a large pan, not looking at Hermione. ‘I was hoping you could suggest to Ron and her that they visit Molly. Ginny could stay the night there.’
“Hermione,” Lupin said in a low, sharp tone. “Don’t do that.”
Draco got up and offered Lupin his hand to help him up. When they were both standing, he made eye contact with the Alpha. “Would you mind letting my mate know where I am?”
Everywhere across the floor there were lovely nooks and crannies where one could retreat with a book once they’d found something good. The whole atmosphere made Draco feel like he was welcome, and made him forget about feeling awkward when asking employees what books they’d recommend or looking at sections that weren’t really meant for Omegas.
Draco stayed near the threshold, feeling nervous but bold at the same time, ‘can I sleep here?’
Ginny smiled and bowed quickly. It seemed unpractised to Draco, but it wasn’t really his place to say anything about that so he bowed back.
“I know.” Harry’s tone was low, forgiving and understanding.
“I guess it’s good we have nine months to get used to the idea of a child,” he then half-laughed. “We should… I don’t know, make a list… lists… of things we need to buy, to do, and-”
Behind them, someone coughed. “Adelaide, I’ll be taking Draco home now. Thank you for keeping him company.”
Draco moved along with Harry, remaining close. “Maybe just ask if we can come over for dinner – of invite them over or...”
Mr Potter looked away from Draco and offered Draco’s mother his hand. ‘Certainly, Mrs Malfoy. Thank you for having me. I understand that it is hard to let anyone near someone as sensitive as your son during these difficult times.’
‘Welcome!’ Mr Lovegood opened the door and invited them in. ‘The soup is in the kitchen, Luna’s serving it just now.’ He led them into the kitchen, where he pulled out a chair for Draco. Draco sat down on the rickety thing, not really trusting it to hold him.
‘Good.’ An arm sneaked around his stomach and pulled him closer to the other man. He could hear Harry sniffing up his scent. ‘Me too…’
Whatever happened next was lost to Draco. The only thing that could draw his attention now, was the little baby he was holding.
“Of course,” Harry said, placing a heavy hand on Remus’ shoulder to indicate that he wanted the Omega to come with him. He was worried about Draco, and was eager to get both Omegas home, to safety. “Shall we?”
‘You do want this?’ Harry asked, his voice hoarse and rough.
‘Great. So what film do you want to watch?’ Harry pointed at a pile of rectangular, flat boxes. ‘Just read the backs to see what they’re about, just like you’d do with books.’
I actually had the rough draft of this chapter done last night and I felt so guilty for not uploading it immediately, but I wanted to take another look at it with fresh eyes.
‘Have you seen today’s headline?’ His mother’s voice cut through his train of thought and he quickly looked at the headline.
Mr Potter gasped for breath, making Draco look up at him again. Mr Potter was furious and Draco cringed, afraid the Alpha would hurt him.
‘Good boy. Now undress.’
Draco hadn’t picked up on such a desire from Adelaide and apparently, Harry hadn’t either as he looked a bit puzzled. ‘If that’s what you want, Adelaide…?’
Locating Riddles file took time, because it wasn’t where it was supposed to be, Hermione explained when she returned a few hours later. She immediately left the house again though, muttering something Draco couldn’t quite hear, but it was clear to him she had left to allow him and Harry to have some private time.
‘You can’t possibly be comfortable like that,’ Harry gently argued. ‘Come on, Draco, it’s time to shower and wash yourself. You can’t stay like this forever.’
He turned his head to look at her, and blinked to help clear his mind.
Instead of deigning the stranger with a response, he gathered whatever spit he had left in his mouth, and spat the man in his face. “Fuck you,” he added, matching the coldness of the stranger’s tone.
He hesitated. ‘Yes…’
Harry followed him, taking large steps so he could shield Draco from what was on the other side of the door.
Harry sighed. “It’s… It was a long time ago.”
‘Come on, we’re going onto that staircase.’
See you next week!
‘I… I think…’ he didn’t want to say anything offensive, since she had taken care of him and was so nice, ‘I think I’m ready to… get out of bed and… just a little while...’
Just as he was about to give up, Harry asked, slowly, ‘does the name Tom Riddle keep showing up in your files as well?’
Hermione sighed. ‘I understand that, especially due to your past, you are sensitive to situations like these, but you haven’t given Harry the chance to explain anything.’
‘Who was the official that visited you?’ It sounded urgent and Draco once more tried to open his eyes. ‘Who...?’
“Can we teach this one to not call me mommy?” Draco asked, although he knew it was most likely a lost cause.
‘How many were in your class?’ Harry suddenly asked.
‘I’m coming,’ he said in a raised voice, because shouting was a thing Omegas did not do. Ever.
‘Uhm. Yes… Is that a problem?’
“It was,” Lupin sighed, eyes cloudy with the memories. “I miss him.”
Harry sighed. ‘Fine.’
Mr Potter had left.
‘It was not so bad,’ Draco whispered. ‘It was just… I wasn’t… It was all I had.’
But then Mr Potter drew in a deep breath and regained his posture. ‘That must have been terrible.’
Well, never mind my senseless babbling, enjoy!
Harry stood up. Draco followed.
But of course, his mother knew and she opened the door, smiling at him. ‘Hello darling, I’ve got someone for you to meet.’ She stepped aside and a short, burly man stepped in. He was about as tall as Draco was, maybe a bit shorter, and dressed in regular office attire. For the most part, he looked quite acceptable. His hair, however… It was nothing short of an abomination. It was black and stood up on all sides, like some sort of explosion had taken place in there only minutes prior to him stepping in the room, despite obvious attempts to tame the thing. His skin was a soft, golden brown and he smiled at Draco, showing a lovely smile with straight white teeth.
Draco remained quiet for a few more seconds, nursing his tea, before bouncing the ball back to Adelaide. “So how’s everything at the Burrow?”
Draco appreciated the change in Tonks’ attitude, and smiled at her. She didn’t smile back.
The television box – or TV, as Hermione had called it – was a weird little thing that apparently ran on something called electricity – something that came out of the wall and was connected to the box itself through a black lifeless snake. There also was something with a power box or however they’d called it, but this was complicated enough.
“Alright. D’you want me to wake you in a few hours?”
‘Back alre- what’s wrong?’ Adelaide asked as soon as she saw him.
“We’re looking for some furniture for the nursery, and anything that might be helpful along the way, too,” Harry said. “We haven’t had much time to look around yet. It’s all a little overwhelming.”
“I do!” Draco looked up, finding that his Alpha looked quite forlorn. Guilt washed over him and he didn’t know what to say.
Harry laughed. “Yeah, yeah.”
Draco let go of the chair and bowed back to Mr Potter stiffly, but had no idea what to say next.
“I’ll drop you off at Crossroads and pick you up again in two hours, okay?” Harry asked and he turned his head a little to look at Draco, eyeing him worriedly.
Mrs Weasley patted his knee, ‘now, that’s unfortunate, but it happens. Do you think Arthur and I never quarrel about things?’
‘That’s okay, I’m sure I’ll understand anyway,’ Harry said tentatively.
“I assure you, you can.” Healer Roberts remained calm and steady. “He’ll be here soon, I’m sure.”
Do you think Harry and Draco are unfix-able or do you still see a future for them, knowing that Harry did nothing objectionable after he ordered Draco to obey? What kind of role do you think Draco will have (next to the one of being a victim) in the abuse cases?
The next morning, Draco’s heat was over again and while he felt sore from being pounded into the matrass more times than he’d been able to count, he felt amazing.
“But Harry-” Draco’s sentence got cut short. Harry had disapparated.
Draco shook his head. “No... I want to go home.”
‘You work at the Omega Regulation Office, right?’ Draco wondered out loud, feeling safer now that Hermione had responded positively on his question.
Both laughed, the tense atmosphere broken like ice, now just chunks of doubt and insecurity floating between them.
‘I can’t remember.’ She pulled back a bit and he wanted to let her go, but she kept leaning into him so he awkwardly allowed her to do that and put his arms back around her.
So now Draco sat in the kitchen, nervously. He fidgeted with the excess of fabric that the trousers had and then rubbed his sweaty hands on them. Mrs Weasley smiled reassuringly at him and he tried to smile back, but was just too nervous for that.
“I have information to trade,” Sirius confirmed, face neutral again.
“And you can?” Her tone had lost its hostility, now sounding desperate.
Searching the files was boring and tedious work, Draco soon found out. He had to dig through a good few of them before he could find anything that resembled a pattern, and the idea was soon destroyed when he couldn’t find it anywhere else.
Harry blinked bewilderedly, ‘their names?’
‘Ah. I’m sorry, I should have told you side-along apparition is rather uncomfortable,’ Harry apologised and he eyed Adelaide, who looked a bit greenish, Draco observed.
‘Aren’t you a pretty one?’ she cooed at him again and she bend forward a bit to pet his cheek. He started purring without really wanting to.
‘Where do I put my clothes?’
‘Very well.’ He could hear his mother clearly now as well and quickly retreated to his safe window seat, trying to look as casual and elegant as he could, despite the fact he was positive there was a blush on his cheeks.
‘He won’t come close to you. It’s just necessary that he is present.’
Softly running his fingers through Harry’s hair, he whispered it again, even softer this time, and Harry kissed him slow, tenderly, as if proving he felt the same way.
“When’s your next checkup?”

‘Me neither,’ Draco tried to comfort her, though he had never asked his parents if he could come along when they visited the Greengrasses. It seemed she could start crying any minute. She had always been extremely fragile, he remembered, even among the other Omegas at their school.
The sunlight on Draco’s skin felt good, and he lifted his head to allow the light to stroke his face. He sighed.  “It’s good to be outside again.”
“We can if you want to, but we’ll have to get dressed first,” Harry reminded him.
He took his apron from the hook and tied it up around him. With only two hours’ worth’ of time to kill he decided on some indoor chores that could be easily done within that time frame. The others he could do this afternoon – if he was lucky, Hermione would be home early and would help him.
Mr Potter smiled at his mother. ‘Thank you, Mrs Malfoy. I believe we will be just fine.’
Harry ran his fingers through his hair, making Draco stop looking at the paper and look at his Alpha.
different types of the same product. What was the difference between these five self-rocking cradles? They were all self-rocking. He couldn’t tell.
Harry groaned. “I want you
“Draco,” Hermione said, surprised to see him. “How are you?”
He could hear Harry draw in a sharp breath, ‘you’re… Are you sure?’
Draco sat down next to Harry and took the list from him. ‘I know a few… Neville Longbottom was in my year, Astoria Greengrass, Luna Lovegood and Zacharias Smith were one year below and the I know that those three,’ Draco pointed out some other names, ‘were in the lowest year, but I wasn’t acquainted with them very well.’ He waited for a sew second and then asked, ‘so why did you want to know that?’
‘I’ll talk to her later. I just want Draco to feel safe.’
‘If I was romantically interested in you, I would always back you,’ Draco offered.
‘I’m not related to her by blood,’ Harry slowly considered, looking at Mrs Weasley, ‘but yes, family nonetheless. She actually lived at my house, currently.’
“Hey,” Harry said and Draco could hear the smile in his voice. “Were you already done in there?”
‘Agreed,’ Miss Greengrass said without batting an eye. ‘We have nothing to hide. Astoria is being treated perfectly well. It’s just terrible that some treat their Omegas so horribly.’
He quickly, but graciously descended the stairs and walked into the kitchen.
“I’m not mated to Tonks.” With slow, measured movements, Lupin poured himself another mug of tea, curling his fingers around the too-hot porcelain. “My mate’s in Azkaban. We were permitted one visit every month, and had an arrangement for heats.”
Hope you like it nonetheless!
The next morning, Harry and Draco got up together. Breakfast was a quiet affair, and despite the fact that Draco wasn’t afraid anymore, it was a bit awkward, too. When it was time for Harry to leave for work, Draco reached across the table and took Harry’s hand. “Don’t go.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco nodded and rubbed his eyes, finding his fingers wet after that.
“Please kill me now,” Draco groaned as he sank down in one of the ramshackle kitchen chairs.
“Just a minute...”
Draco could see how Harry tensed up.
‘Due to all this ruckus the Ministry feels as though it’s a necessity to pay all the registered Omegas a visit. We expect a Ministry official right after lunch, therefore your afternoon will be taken up by all that. We have owled miss Fawley and asked her to come this morning for your lessons instead. She will arrive at ten.’
‘Don’t you need – ’ he started a sentence, realising he hadn’t done anything for Harry.
Harry sat down on the couch next to him. “It’s okay.” He visibly hesitated. “Are you… are you still upset?”
“Please,” Lupin repeated. It wasn’t an answer to the question. He kept his head low, avoiding eye-contact with both Harry and Tonks.
“Thank you.” Her tone remained low, but she sounded happy. “When all the paperwork comes through and everything is official, Molly promised we’re going to try…” She shifted her gaze across the room, to Alexander, and Draco understood. “It would be lovely for Alexander to have a little sister,” he said, lowering his tone even more. It was clear to him that Adelaide did not want anyone else to hear - Arthur was obviously aware of the situation, but Draco assumed Adelaide felt awkward with Ron around.
Harry tipped his head to the side, questioning, “but I thought you wanted to visit Adelaide?”
Harry used the kitchen floo to bring them home.
“Draco, Harry, are you in there?” Ron knocked loudly on the kitchen door and Draco could feel Harry tense up behind him. Draco sighed. This hadn’t been the first time that Ron had intruded during their love-making – although doing it in the kitchen maybe hadn’t been the smartest thing to do.
Her anger vanished instantly as she came closer and placed her hand on his arm, preventing him from cowering away any further. ‘I would never, Draco,’ she said softly, in a soothing voice. ‘Did Harry hurt you?’
‘Yes.’
It was time to go in. Draco felt awkward in his hospital gown, and was numbed from the waist down, so while he could feel his muscles respond to the contractions, the situation was absent of pain. Remus stayed behind in the other room. Draco did not want to put him through something that would be a traumatising experience for his friend.
“The labour-alarm tripped at Sunny Springs. Healer Roberts believes you’re going into labour.” Hermione’s tone was low and supposed to be soothing, but it was a weak imitation of Harry’s low, soothing tones, and did nothing for Draco.
‘Come in!’ It was a familiar voice and Draco squeezed Harry’s hand, unable to hide his enthusiasm.
“She likes mothering over others. But since they’re a safe house, most of the people she meets eventually move away again. I think that’s why she doesn’t share much personal information.” With soft, soothing motions, Harry let his fingers slide through Draco’s hair, following its path down Draco’s spine. Draco relaxed into his touch. “I can’t wait until we have our own little one to panic over.”
It seemed endless, a never-ending siege, until suddenly everything died out. The spellfire stopped. The noises stopped. Aurors were rounding up whoever of Riddle’s comrade’s were left while others tended to the wounded, and others collected the bodies of the dead, carefully making a selection between friend and foe.
Harry hummed, wrapped an arm around his mate and walked them to their bedroom. With their last few steps, Draco stepped to the side, making sure they ended up in front of his nest room. If Harry noticed, he didn’t show it. Instead, he followed Draco in, taking off his shoes and taking in the new layout of the room. Draco had painted the walls a sky blue, the ground bed was pushed into a corner, decked out with blankets and pillows. He turned on the radio, and as the soft tunes of piano music filled the room, he pushed Harry towards his nest.
‘No, it’s not because of you wanting to bond with me – it’s not that I’m just complying.’ Draco drew in a steadying breath. ‘I find myself looking forward to the fading of the mark just so you’ll bite me again and I just – I want it.’
Draco tried to still his hips and made a soft noise, ‘I don’t think I can.’
‘Good afternoon, Draco,’ Hermione greeted him from a bit of a distance. ‘I’ve brought Harry with me because I believe the air needs to be cleared about the recent events. Is it okay that Harry is here too?’
Let me know what you think!
‘So how is your education going?’
“I’d like to see you try,” Draco answered, trying not to speak through his teeth.
Hermione sat down too and looked at the Omegas sternly. ‘Why did you run away, Draco?’
As soon as he realised this, the memory started to fade and he hurried to cooperate when he was being pulled out.
‘You need to stand.’ The Alpha placed him on his feet.
“Oh, okay…”
“What are you doing?”
Lupin stepped forward, releasing Draco’s arm, presenting the binder to Hermione. “Inside you’ll find all the paperwork for my request to restart my conjugational visits with Sirius. I have attached a personal testimony, and it already contains the auror stamp you need to consider the request.”
She patted his ankle softly, playing with the frilly lace, not looking at him, as if she was nervous as well. ‘We couldn’t use any revitalising, nourishing or healing spells or potions, since most require the receiving subject to move around while they take effect. You were so weak, we don’t know how you survived for so long… there was no way we could have you walking around… you were in a near comatose-state. So we used a Muggle technique. We pushed that tube through your nose so that it went directly to your stomach and gently pumped liquefied foods and other things you needed through it. When you’re eating well enough again, we’ll take it out.’
Softly, Hermione placed her arm back on his shoulders. “Do you have any questions about it? I’m not an expert but there is someone at the ORO I could ask to provide some leaflets. And if you’re really serious I could reach out to St Mungo’s to see if they have information, too.”
‘Circe, what has gotten your tits in a twist? It’s just an Omega.’
“I don’t… I’m not sure if I can.”
‘That’s okay.’
‘Potter.’
WOOWWW Already a thousand hits! Makes me so happy :)
“I remember you like it rough,” Adelaide teased and Draco felt the blood speed to his cheeks, colouring them in an instant.
‘No… I trust Hermione.’
Harry’s hand slid down, gripping Draco’s hip and forcing it down so he could undo the front tie of his trousers. Draco happily let it happen. He let his lips slide over Harry’s neck, sucking deep bruises into his skin and not caring how puberal that made them look. Harry was
Draco looked at his mother, hoping he could find a trace of emotion, of a sign that she was glad to see him... anything.
Draco looked at Emma who happily swinging away, and sighed. ‘Okay…’
Harry sped forwards, grabbing onto Draco’s hips tight enough to bruise. He muttered a spell that made Draco’s trousers sink down to the floor and used his hands to spread his cheeks. Without much resistance, he pushed a finger in, making Draco gasp, “I already prepared, just fuck me, before Ron or Hermione gets home.”
Conspire with me in the comment section! :)
Hermione returned three days later, armed with a suitcase, Harry in her wake. Draco was out in the garden, enjoying the beautiful fall afternoon when they arrived. He saw Hermione first and got up to greet her, bit froze in his place when he saw Harry.
Draco looked at his feet, ‘I don’t know how a courtship works,’ he eventually muttered, barely audible.
‘Do you need more?’
“I’m glad to see you’re happy.” Her voice was softer, had become a bit warmer, more like how she spoke to him when he still lived at home. “I... I should go. Merry Christmas, Mr Potter, Draco.”  She side-stepped around them and was gone before he realised, leaving him whispering “Merry Christmas, mother,” to an empty space.
“Okay.”
‘Oh Harry, Kreacher isn’t
“I turned off the alarm and locked the house away. Are you okay?” She remained on the other side of the door without opening it, and Draco appreciated the gesture.
Hermione accepted the call. Her voice sounded far away and distorted to Draco. He opened his eyes, only to be confronted by both Ron and Remus looking at him worriedly.
‘Oh, yes, so I was digging the hole for the flutterby bush and then I dove my shovel straight into a snake, chopping its head off… Pretty cool.’
“Wanna go take a nap in the nest?” Harry suggested.
‘Of course,’ Hermione agreed, ‘I should have thought of that.’
‘Here, drink.’ Adelaide pushed a glass of water against his lips and he downed it quickly. It tasted fresh and minty. ‘What is that taste?’
Fingers slowly trailed down and Harry hummed in surprise and satisfaction when he felt Draco required very little prep. “You must be in pre-heat already,” he mumbled before Draco caught his lips again, this time in a more demanding kiss. He moaned under Harry’s touch and spread his legs further to accommodate his partner. Harry had different plans, however, as he flipped them over, allowing Draco lay on top. He laughed hoarsely, leaning down to kiss Harry again and moving his hips down a little, taking in Harry slowly. They both moaned.
“Yes, Harry, we’ll be
‘Good morning, mother.’ His voice sounded perfectly soft, soothing and especially obedient.
Back home, Harry made tea and they sat down in the kitchen.
“But – ”
Harry chuckled, kissing Draco’s neck, pulling him close, cuddling a little, ‘whatever you want, hmm…’
“Anything for you,
“Let’s take home a pint, when we’re done,”  Draco suggested carefully, though he knew Harry would not refuse him something he delighted in so much - especially not now.
“But what if it tastes bad?”  Draco worried.
He closed his eyes again and carefully stretched his limbs, groaning when he felt a sharp pain sting in his abdomen.
“Hello, I’m Prudence Roberts,” the healer eventually broke the silence. She stepped around Bella and moved towards them. Harry stood up and shook her hand, but Draco remained seated. He was getting nervous and hiding behind Harry made him feel a lot safer. Healer Roberts just smiled at him and bowed anyway, to which he responded with small nod.
Luna sat down next to him, while Harry and Mr Lovegood sat at the other end of the table. By the looks of it, they were already deep in conversation, Harry pulling parchment out of his satchel as Mr Lovegood spoke and then making haphazard notes.
‘I would love to,’ Harry said with a warm smile. ‘What time do you have to be there?’
Draco ignored it. “What happened?”
“Okay,” Harry said, and that was all.
‘Wait, wait, I don’t get it,’ Adelaide shook her head and Harry paused the film. ‘So what, they just change into
His heat had finally started.
‘I apparated.’ Harry started to pull back.
Draco looked at Harry, silently weighing his options. Did he really need Hermione present in order to voice his feelings?
“Wish he’d just knock me up,” Draco murmured.
‘I want it to be permanent.’ Draco placed his fingers over the fading mark, caressing the now familiar ridges and sighing due to the sensation. ‘I’ve thought about it a lot – ’
‘They – my parents have a grave. Neville still visits his is St Mungo’s. It’s not – you don’t have to do that.’ Harry struggled to get the words out, Draco noted, and he bend forwards to kiss the other man, trying to comfort him with a soft touch of lips. ‘Whatever you want, Harry,’ he whispered.
‘Harry please…’
Harry sighed deeply as he sank down in his seat at the table.
fat.”
“I’d like that.” Draco waited a beat before adding, “thank you. For offering.” It broke the stalemate between them, and Lupin lifted his head again, meeting Draco’s eyes. In them, Draco could read anxiety and confusion, but also a spark of happiness. “Of course,” he murmured, before turning back to his books.
Adelaide rubbed her eyes, grumbling as if her hangover hadn’t been cured quite yet.
‘Draco?’
‘Harry,’ he whispered, trying to catch the Alpha’s gaze, but Harry pushed Draco’s head back gently and let his teeth graze over the Omega’s throat.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t really care, you know that. Just pick something you think they’ll like. Unless you manage to spend four hundred galleons per person, we’ll be fine.”
‘Draco!’ Adelaide exclaimed indignantly.
“Sounds good. Why don’t you get the quantities we need mixed, I’ll grab some other supplies.” His tone was low, but friendly, and Draco felt his nerves settle down again. The nearness of the other Omega made him feel safe and steady.
“I know.” Leaning into the strong Alpha, he tried to let his worries and fears go. Ever since the twins had been born, his frayed and frazzled instincts were always in overdrive, always hyper-sensitive. He hoped that it would get better soon, but had an inkling that he might always be overprotective of his two little treasures.
it blared. Beneath it was a picture Adelaide Parker, a girl he used to go to school with. He tried to keep his features completely smooth. ‘Such a pity. She was a nice girl,’ he commented.
“They think he’s influencing me. Hurting me. Or using me to hurt others,” Lupin replied, his tone low, a rumble of frustration and tension.
‘He saw him naked?’
Draco huffed indignantly.
“I don’t know,” he repeated. “Harry likes his job. He’s not a paperwork kind of person.”
But if Harry had such plans, it wasn’t visible. He got up and plugged in the TV. “What do you want to see?”
‘Hmw?’
“First training day for new recruits,” Harry sighed. “It’s always the same.”
‘Well – yes.’
The painkillers helped, sure, but they did not alleviate the weariness in Draco’s bones, and so he stayed in bed for over a day after his heat had ended, only coming out when Harry insisted it was time to clean the sheets.
‘Of course, I will. And how have your heats been ever since?’
‘Lucius, we can never ever let that Harry Potter near our son again, you hear me?’
He stumbled back, face contorting in anger, wand raised to speak another torturous spell when -
Draco nodded. “It does... But according to Healer Roberts, this is for the best... two weeks is the minimum time needed to recover properly from a heat and because I’m a bit older than is usual... If we want more than one kid we’re going to have to hurry.”
hit home.
‘Okay…’ Draco said slowly.
‘Oh.’ She gently pulled back. ‘I’m tired, I’m going to bed, okay?’
“Okay.” Harry set everything up and then sat back down next to him. He seemed unsure of what to do, so Draco moved a bit closer and quietly cuddled up to his Alpha. Harry sighed and wrapped his arm around him. “I love you,” he murmured, barely audible and it took Draco a few minutes to respond, equally quiet, “I love you too, Harry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
‘What did you two fight about?’
‘All right, turn your head,’ Harry ordered and Draco complied, turning his head a little. Before he knew it, Harry’s lips pressed against his own. It was clumsy and messy due to the weird angle, but Draco liked it. Harry’s lips were chapped, but careful and it was a soft, almost chaste kiss. ‘Hmmm,’ Harry hummed and he gently pushed Draco into opening his mouth. At first he wasn’t sure where this was going, but he still did as Harry wanted. He tasted fresh, like toothpaste and when Draco carefully participated in the open-mouthed kiss, he found Harry had clean teeth, which was nice. It still was weird, though, but luckily Harry was very soft and gentle, giving Draco all the time he needed to get used it.
He just nodded. Desperation sneaked back into his heart. He looked away, pushing the unpleasant feeling away as much as he could.
So there we have it, another chapter at last! I do hope you like it, because I do have second thoughts about it, I think it's a bit weird, I don't know...
‘I… Who are you?’ He tried to start with the most basic question, even though he had much more burning questions.
‘No!’ he managed to say and he rolled over again, resolute to stay away from Harry as much as he could. The need slowly turned into pain, cramps in his stomach and he curled himself up in a ball, whimpering and whining from the pain and need. He had no idea how long it took, it could have been hours, or maybe just seconds.
As always, I'm eager to hear your thoughts and read your comments.
“That’s nice.”
Breakfast was awkward. Harry mostly chatted with Molly and send sideway glances Draco’s way every now and then, making Draco blush – but try really hard not to blush – and Adelaide chuckle. They weren’t even allowed to sit together – well, they
He took a deep breath, mustering up all his courage and… ‘Can I meet him?’
Draco shook his head. “I’m not...” Talking about his feelings was
‘Maybe,’ Harry joked, pressing his lips against Draco’s shoulder.
Harry sat back down and Draco followed suit, not bothering with the complicated sitting technique Miss Fawley had taught him, but still gracefully so.
“Why didn’t you want me to take you in our bed?” Harry then asked, laughter still in his warm voice.
“Yes, that sounds great,” he answered automatically and he smiled in the same manner. Worry sparked through the bond and Draco tried to make his smile seem more real. “I’ll be fine, really.”
‘The Order?’ Draco echoed, he’d never hear Harry say anything about that at all. Harry rarely ever spoke about his childhood, although it had been strange how familiarly he had greeted Mrs Longbottom.
Next to that, I don't really have anything to say for this chapter, so... enjoy!
“That’s the floor.” Harry sounded perplexed
Okay, enough chit-chat, read that new chapter! (and tell me what you think!)
Harry chuckled warmly. “If you could finish any one of those sentences that would be helpful.”
In all honesty, Draco did not feel ready to take his babies outside. But he also knew he could not keep them confined to their home forever, and going for a walk would be good for them, and for himself. Even if it did feel like walking into a warzone.
He felt Harry stretch out next to him. Draco hissed, because the motion juggled him and revealed new sore spots. Muscles he wasn’t even sure he had
“Sirius has an aunt… she may be willing to advocate for him,” Remus murmured, tapping his fingers on the wooden table in an irregular pattern. It seemed to ground him.
Draco wasn’t sure what to say. He couldn’t offer Remus much solace. He had no certainties to offer. “You don’t have to make the choice today,” he instead said, tone soft and low, “just take today for whatever it is, and don’t think about tomorrow, or next week. We can’t see the future, and I don’t think we should try.”
Draco quickly turned around, scarf still in hand, and tried not to look guilty. “I’m just... I feel like it’s time now. I need a... a...”  He looked away, at his feet, feeling confused and embarrassed. A nest was not supposed to consist of things of anyone other than the Alpha and Omega
The food was really good. Harry had cooked and had told Draco and Adelaide that it was an Indian dish. It was something Draco had never eaten before, so he was careful when he took his first bites. At first, there was this explosion of different tastes Draco did nog recognise. It was spicy, sweet and savoury at the same time.
Harry drew in a sharp breath. “Is it something you
,’ urged Miss Fawley again and his breath hitched because he wanted to obey so badly. ‘I…’
‘Please…’
“I thought we were fine,” Harry murmured. “I mean I could feel you felt uneasy at times but apart from that, I thought...”
P.S. Small shout-out to the loyal reader that was the only one to comment on last chapter. (DiverTazSC)  Thank you!
Draco moaned, closing his eyes and letting the pleasurable zing of arousal stir through his body.
‘What?’ Harry laughed sleepily, ‘you know I can’t.’ He slowly let go of Draco, pushing himself up and yawning. ‘We’ve got this new case and I feel we’re close to cracking it.’
‘And if that wasn’t bad enough it somehow triggered his nature! He
‘You seem to like that part of my body quite a lot.’
Quick note for everyone that commented when I said "I'm torn between two endings", I ended up merging them. This chapter encompasses one of the ideas that I had, and the epilogue is centered around the other idea that I had floating around in my head
‘But you’ll stay the night?’
For a few minutes, the kitchen was veiled in a heavy silence. Then, Lupin opened his eyes. Just like Draco had pushed a teacup in his direction just a moment ago, he now pushed the package and its contents towards Draco.
“Better make that meeting quick.” He was just teasing, but felt through their bond that the words made Harry tense.
When he undressed to go to bed, he found the back of his pants damp.
‘Yes, it sounds… cool,’ Draco repeated the word hesitantly.
‘I – okay.’ Harry sounded just as dumbfounded as Draco felt. ‘But as your Alpha I sometimes need to do those things. It’s my job to protect you.’
What will happen next? How hurt is Draco? Will he and Adelaide stay at Grimmauld Place anyway, or will they leave? What about the abuse cases?
“Hmm. And what else did you find?”
‘Yes, Harry.’ Draco nodded eagerly, happy to obey.
“He told me he lived with Sirius’ aunt for a while after he and Sirius bonded, but lost contact when Sirius got arrested.”
“No, I’m fine.”
Harry paid, and they left the store.
Adelaide moved over, sat down next to him and tenderly draped her arm over his shoulders, pulling him closer. He let his body fell against hers, hiding his face against her shoulder.
Lupin put his cup back on the saucer with a clang. It made Draco flinch. Noises now reached his ears unfiltered, and as his pregnancy grew on, even the lightest of impulses could set him off. Lupin didn’t seem to notice, or didn’t care. He placed the package on the kitchen table. His hands were trembling. It was hard to get a grip on the silky ribbon that tied the package close.
“We should move you to Sunny Springs just to be sure,” Hermione persisted and she offered Draco her hand. “Can you stand?”
‘Yes.’
Harry pulled the covers over them in one smooth motion. “Get some sleep, we’ll talk about it later.” But Draco was already too far gone to register the words fully.
ANOTHER CLIFFHANGER
“Help me up?” Draco offered Harry his hand, letting the other man help him up. The last few days, his balance had been so off. Maybe it was because he wasn’t used to the weight of their children, bringing his center further forward every day.
“Are you kidding, of course I’m happy!” Harry bent towards Draco to kiss him, before pulling him out of his chair and on top of himself. Draco let it happen without protest, still smiling when he settled into Harry’s lap. “I wonder what it’ll be this time.”
This chapter is a bit late (I've been sick for the last few days) and I almost didn't upload it today. Luckily I felt a bit better so I could finish the chapter, so here it is!
It sounded hurt and Draco could
“Whatever it is, I’ll be happy with them,” Harry swore.
“If you want to know, sure,” Harry easily agreed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s a girl, yeah,” Bella confirmed as she reached over and carefully placed the first child on Draco’s chest, making sure that it would not put pressure on his ribcage. He instinctively curled his arms around the little baby, who was still weeping but much quieter now. “She’s so pretty,” Draco said, now actually crying.
‘Yes… I wasn’t nice… I was just grumpy and annoyed and you were an easy victim and I regret being like that to you.’ Draco really meant it. He liked Adelaide a lot and he
He looked up, “oh, erm, do they have any new flavours?”
“I think she’s out in the garden. We’ve got gnomes,” Adelaide told him as she sat down. He could hear the shifting of clothing and then the soft, familiar sounds of her trying to make the baby burp. “Come on Alexander,” she murmured, and when he burped, cooing, “there’s my good boy, such a cutie…”
Hermione swiped her hair out of her face and tapped her lower lip with her index finger, looking pensive. “It’s not unheard of for Omegas to need a lot of personal attention from their Alpha,” she eventually said, though it didn’t sound confident.
Next up: fixing the relation between Draco and Harry, as well as a greater involvement for Draco in the abuse cases!
Hi everyone!
Draco clinked his glass against hers in silent agreement.
Hermione paled and shook her head, ‘I haven’t.’
They were quiet for a long time, until Harry tentatively said, “we still need to talk about your books.” He said it carefully, calmly, so as not to trigger Draco.
Here's another chapter, hope you like it!
He got up, turned to face Neville, ‘I guess I’ll see you again sometime,’ Neville said and he sounded bleak.
‘Good boy,’ the woman cooed.
“Yeah, they’re putting in the paperwork soon.” Draco pressed his cold hands against Harry’s chest and stretched so that he could put his feet on the hot water bottle at the bottom of their bed. “And I… know we weren’t going to tell anyone yet but… I also told Adelaide that, uh, I’m pregnant. But I made her swear not to tell anyone!”
“How long before they take effect?” she then asked, and Draco decided that she was serious after all.
“No, we’re fine,” she replied, eyes still on Draco.
Draco stumbled out of the floo and felt Harry’s hands steadying him quickly. ‘You okay?’ the Alpha asked and Draco nodded. ‘It’s much better than apparition.’
Draco nodded and she tapped her wand at each book. “Now to anyone, including you, they’ll seem like ordinary household books. When you open them, they’re the books you bought.” She wrapped the books in brown paper and put them in a paper bag. “Thank you for your purchase.”
‘I don’t… with females,’ he mumbled embarrassed.
“Mmm..mhm, Draco,” Harry murmured, creating a little distance between them despite enjoying the attention so that he could look into Draco’s eyes.
Waking up from his second heat, Draco felt even more broken than the first time. He didn’t dare look at his hips, arms and legs, sure that they would be littered with bruises. They
‘I think these will fit you, they are my husband’s, so they will be a little bit big but it should do for today.’ She gave him a set of clothes. He sniffed them hesitantly. They smelled of beta, but she had said it would be okay, so…
When Harry pulled back Draco moaned at the loss. Harry smiled. ‘I gather it was good, then.’
Draco dropped the towel on the floor and walked to the bedroom with jerky motions. He let himself fall on the bed. The soft sheets had a cooling effect on his body and he sighed, because the need dwindled a bit.
“Well, that’s true, of course, but in a twin pregnancy, everything can be so much more exhausting. It’s okay to rest multiple times a day. Energy peaks and dips are part of the deal now.” She relocated her gaze to Harry for a second, then back to Draco. “Don’t push yourself because you think you should be able to do something. Your mate can take care of things you can’t do anymore.”
‘Yes!’ Draco exclaimed.
‘I’m right here,’ Harry answered as he bent forward, pushing in deeper slowly.
Harry quickly looked at Draco and then left the room with Miss Greengrass.
Harry stopped walking, jerking Draco, who hadn’t noticed that Harry had stopped walking, back. ‘Here it is.’
He was silenced by Harry’s lips pressing firmly against his own and he opened his mouth, embracing Harry’s rough kiss and sighing a little because of how good it felt to have his Alpha claim him like that.
‘Harry has brought Draco to meet us.’ Hermione stepped aside and gestured and Draco and Harry.
Head Auror Robards swiped his hand over his face and sighed. “I don’t really have much of a choice, do I?”
Harry nodded. “I could feel your  uneasiness but I... I thought you would tell me when you were ready.”
Draco bit his lower lip, nervously. Those bruises… ‘I tripped, sir’
“It’s not there. I’ll sign it. I’ll come with you,” Draco repeated. “There’s no frequency limitation either. You could visit him daily.”
Also, I've hinted at our (male) villain a few times, but not really given much information about him. Who do you think it is?
Draco squirmed, ‘I need it, I need it, please Harry…’
Draco stood in front of the bathroom mirror in Harry’s bathroom, pressing his fingers over the fading bite mark on his throat, trying to hide his disappointment. It had been horrifying to tell Mrs Weasley about Harry’s biting kink, but when he’d gotten home with a bite mark that would not fade, there hadn’t been much of a choice other than telling her.
“Don’t say that about yourself.” Draco reached across the table to touch Lupin’s hand. “You’re not broken. You’re healing.”
“Yeah. But it wasn’t really me alone. It was a team effort. I was distracted anyway.” It sounded like Harry didn’t want to talk about it, and Draco tried to let it go, but couldn’t help asking one more question: “where are they holding him?”
‘He?’
Draco looked at his mother for help. How was he supposed to explain those? It was one of the forbidden subjects. His Alpha had ordered him to never talk of it.
As they sat down, Draco scooted as close to Harry as he could and turned a little to
“There you go.” Remus handed Draco a cup of tea and sat down next to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I read all the cases that come in, assign people to them and keep track of all the reports that they hand in. When the case is closed, I’m the one that officially closes it. If different departments work together, I’m the contact point.”
Harry pulled them both into the nest.
‘Yes… When I was younger I did hope to be claimed, bonded… just like you… But that… It was just a dream. I don’t think my parents were planning on ever allowing anyone to have me. Father always kept saying they were saving me for someone but I don’t know who. Whoever it is, thought, he never claimed me.’
It was enough to distract the Alpha and she turned her head back to the table, murmuring a quiet apology.
‘It’s okay,’ Harry managed, and then, ‘I’ll take care of you…’ He moved his hand a little and pushed his pinkie in as well, using his hand to stretch his Omega as well as he could, and then drew his hand back, moaning at the wet, squelching sound that came with the movement.
I was supposed to write it in one sitting on Sunday, but like Draco, I too needed a bath to help me cool down.
“That’s good,” Healer Roberts nodded. “If you haven’t been already, you might want to start doing some light exercise from now on - taking walks, yoga, that sort of thing.”
“Oh, when your next heat comes around, I’m sure we’ll be able to nudge your instincts in the right direction.” The stranger’s tone was airy, as if he did not care either way.
Harry’s arms slid underneath Draco’s body and he lifted him up easily enough. He clenched his muscles in trying to prevent himself from leaking as Harry carried him to the bathroom, but could still feel some trickling down his thighs. He moaned disappointedly.
‘Therefore I will not bring you two back to the Burrow unless you allow Harry to explain. If you still want to go home after that, I will personally bring you. Agreed?’
“I’ll tell you all when you have your food,” Molly said with a laugh.
‘Shhh, sshhh, Draco, it’s okay, you’re so good…’
‘Most of this happened because everyone keeps treating me like I’m the victim of some heinous crime and because I keep acting like I am one. But I’m sick of that. I want to move on from what happened. I like you a lot but I hate it when you treat me like I’m made of porcelain.’
‘You can come when you take my fist.’ It sounded hot and Draco moaned once more, now pushing back against Harry’s hand eagerly, wanting to be good, wanting to come.
‘Yes.’
The next time he woke up, Adelaide was with him and she was armed with a bucket of ice-water and fruit. ‘Hi Draco.’
‘Yes,’ Harry confirmed. ‘I had no idea he’d been released though. The date was supposed to be… a few years ahead.’
“I just need to finish this.” Harry tapped the parchment he was working on before closing his eyes for a few seconds. “Merlin. I’m tired.”
Mrs Longbottom grimaced at him, ‘well, go join him then.’ She let go of his sleeve and Draco quickly walked into the garden, where Harry and Neville were already chatting amicably.
Harry shifted in his seat and Draco almost immediately scooted closer to Harry, grabbing his hand and intertwining their fingers.
‘That’s a really pretty name,’ he complimented her, ‘I like it a lot.’
‘Kitchen!’
‘That’s pretty normal for us,’ Draco defended the action, ‘we can’t be friends with Alphas because it’s not appropriate.’
‘Harryyy…’ Draco whined, not being able to stop his body from moving along with Harry’s hand.
Strong hands hoisted him up a bit more and with nowhere else to put his head, Draco buried it in the crook of Harry’s neck. He shifted a little bit, unable to sit still with the need still burning in his veins.
Lupin hummed encouragingly.
Parkinson was sentenced to life in prison.
It only took Harry a few minutes to come, and when he let go of Draco and rolled onto his back, Draco commented, “you have shit stamina.”
Harry nuzzled his neck a little, ‘you too…’
‘It’s not, really…’ Draco moved a little bit, again, ‘I still need you to…’ He ended the sentence in a moan when he felt Harry come for the umpteenth time.
he thought, but answered perfectly polite: ‘my life is wonderful, thank you for asking. My parents treat me very well. I love them dearly.’
Harry brought him to the bathroom and made Draco wrap his legs around him, so that he could free one hand and turn on the cold water tap.
“It’s always like this,” Remus said, “even the heat rooms are… well, not heated. Nothing here is made for comfort.” He flashed his wrist to the last guard they had to pass to the meeting room, and Draco did the same. The intense, matte black still looked and felt unfamiliar and strange to him, especially because it only appeared when needed. He had never signed a magical contract before.
‘All the papers came through,’ Harry said needlessly. ‘So I wanted to take you out.’
‘It’s okay,’ the Alpha muttered and he wrapped strong arms around Draco, lifting him up and bringing him back into the bedroom.
“That’s good.” Draco rubbed his wrist over the hand of the other Omega, placating him as best as he could. He didn’t know where he got the inspiration for his actions - he felt strangely protective of the other Omega.
‘So ready, ready for you, Harry
Harry wordlessly followed along, pushing down his own trousers and positioning himself behind the Omega. He once again gripped Draco’s hips, holding them in place.
Draco stood up, using his length against Harry. He was only an inch or so taller, and he had never used it against his mate, but he did so now. “He. Is. Sick.” He bit off the words, channelling a deeper anger he hadn’t been aware he possessed. “Use your
When Draco woke up, Harry was sitting next to his bed with two pieces of paper in his hands. The children, in separate cribs on the other side of the bed, were asleep.
‘I – Lily Evans and James Potter.’
. Maybe he’d ask Adelaide about her nest.
Inside, Draco stripped of his – now wet and icky – pyjamas, dropped them where he stood and dove into the nest, landing on the soft mattress and letting out a happy, bubbly laugh. He made himself comfortable as he watched Harry, who stood at the edge of the nest, still dressed. “Aren’t you gonna take that off?” Draco asked in his sweetest voice, enjoying the visible excitement his little act gave his Alpha.
“Hello.” As soon as the word left Draco’s mouth, he felt stupid for it.
“After my last three heats,” he whispered.
The epilogue! I tried to deal with any loose ends there were, questions you as a reader might have after reading "Roots of a new life".
Draco bit his lower lip, a little nervous despite Harry’s tone, and tried to sense Harry’s actual mood through the bond. When nothing but soft, fuzzy, loving feelings came through, he dropped the covers a little bit. “Is that breakfast?”
Before they left the dingy pub, Draco scanned the room, finding Remus in a darkened corner, speaking animatedly with someone hidden away in the shadows. With another pull on Harry’s arm, he indicated it to him. It made the Alpha breathe out and relax next to him before he guided Draco along into Diagon Alley.
‘Do you think that won’t be it?’ Draco carefully asked.
Harry sighed and it sounded relieved. ‘I’m ready to be yours, too.’
‘You feel asleep with your legs still draped over my shoulders. That can’t be comfortable.’
‘I know, I know, I just… want to apologise.’
“Let her go, please,” Lupin requested.
“Can we take these too? They roar!” He held one of them out to Harry, who took it from his hands and laughed when the plushie roared at him. “Sure. Just pick two.”
“Thanks.”
“Of course,” Hermione said without missing a beat. “Andromeda and I will be over tomorrow afternoon to discuss matters. Please do not feel obligated to join the discussion. We all understand that your health and comfort is of utmost importance now.”
Astoria turned her head, suddenly looking straight at him. ‘Who is he?’
“Mmm…” he only managed.
“Good luck with your project,” Draco whispered back, and if Lupin answered, he didn’t hear before he left the kitchen, closing the door with a quiet click.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was incredible, and kind of beautiful in a sick, twisted way. Draco had never seen a wizarding duel, let alone the siege that was taking place in front of his eyes.
He lifted his head of out his hands, showing Hermione the bite mark on his throat. ‘He bites me practically every night. He wants it just as much as I do. What is there to say?’
Draco sat back down again, looking at Astoria, not knowing what to say or how to start a conversation.
Harry laughed and the warm sound washed over Draco, making him feel safe and treasured. ‘Don’t worry, Draco, those are not real people. I didn’t trap anyone in there, okay?’
Outside, he heard voices speak again, more rushed than before.
The Shepherd’s Inn was nicer than Draco had anticipated. Like the Leaky Cauldron, it had a downstairs pub, and rooms upstairs. The pub was, considering the fact that it was early in the morning, expectedly empty, save for a young redheaded witch wearing a long, sweeping dress manning the counter. It was dramatic, but the kind of dramatic Draco appreciated. She took them in, looking at them maybe a second longer than Draco felt was polite, then said; “name?”
‘I know.’ The Alpha wrapped a strong arm around Draco’s waist, half lifting, half dragging him back into the bedroom. Draco whimpered as he felt slick trickle down his thighs. When Harry let go of him, he stumbled into the bed and whined, again, ‘please, Harry…’
“Draco…” Remus started to protest.
‘Although, I think it’s maybe a bit odd that a lot of the Omegas that enrol here are promised to someone, but the prospected owners all wish to remain anonymous… Normally, they have some wishes, some things they want to see their Omegas trained in. We can only teach those Omegas basis things, not things that are specifically catered towards their prospected owner.’ Blaise looked at Draco and smiled, ‘Draco was one of them, if I remember correctly. Why didn’t you want your identity known?’
Miss Fawley smiled at him. ‘Of course it is possible for you to do, even in your attire today. Just scoot your right foot backwards, your left foot to the right and then turn to sit facing forward. After that, place your feet next to each other and sit up straight.’
Some inaudible murmur.
A quiet knock on the bedroom door interrupted his exercise.
“Being a house-husband suits you,” Draco lightly joked, using one of the words he’d learned from reading cheap, second-hand wizarding romance novels.
The rainbow woman was kneeled beside him, instructing him through a breathing exercise. It didn’t help much. The man’s breathing became even more uneven and laboured.
‘There you go.’ Luna placed a bowl of soup in front of him, smiling at him as if he’d never said anything mean to her.
Draco leaned into his mate, pressing his nose against his hair, allowing his light, fresh smell to clear his senses. “Come on. Take a break.”
‘Well now he just has to,’ Adelaide decided as she and Draco stepped into the kitchen to show their new things to Mr and Mrs Weasley.
Anyway, here's the new chapter! Enjoy.
Draco whipped his head back, finding Adelaide standing in front of him. His stomach flipped upside down, and he forcefully swallowed the nausea back down. “Sure. Thanks.”
I am kind of happy with this chapter, so that's great.
“Fuck,” Draco moaned fisting his own cock and coming as pushed himself down on Harry’s knot. “Ah, fuck, Harry…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Piecing together some family history.” Lupin placed his pen down and reached for one of the books, “this one’s just a genealogy book, listing who was born and when, marriages, deaths and any other event that is of relevance to the bloodline.” Moving over to a much smaller, newer book, he explained, “this one outlines how to read and use magical genealogy books.” He slid his fingers carefully over to the last two books. “This one’s magical law, the other is kind of an appendix. It explains the origin and practical applications of the more vague laws.”
Draco hesitated - he’d rather keep the kids with him - but eventually reluctantly agreed. “Okay. After that, we should go home again.”
Harry pressed him back down. ‘I’m sorry,’ he whispered breathily, lips still against Draco’s pulse point, ‘I couldn’t help it.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘You went into heat,’ Mrs Weasley nodded.
Nothing was said whilst they waited, although Harry glanced at Draco a few times. Draco felt his mates gaze, but kept his eyes firmly on the tempus. When it hit zero, he cast his eyes down to the table, looking at the test.
Mr Potter signed something. ‘That all seems in order, wonderful,’ he muttered. ‘Ahem. Yes. Do you know why I am here?’
After she had left he placed his hands on his own stomach and couldn’t help but finding it stupid it was so flat. He imagined what it would be like having his own soft curve there.
He sniffed a little. ‘I don’t want to move.’
To balance out the fact that last week's chapter was kinda short, this one is quite a bit longer than my usual chapters. Enjoy!
“I know I am,” Draco said with a chuckle.
‘Me too,’ Draco tried to lure her into talking more.
Harry caught Draco in his arm once more and pulled him back, kissing him fiercely. “Okay,” he mumbled, “okay…” He let his free hand slide down Draco’s back, placing a light, toying pressure on the sensitive pressure point in the small of his back. It made Draco moan, and he stepped closer to Harry again. He initiated a lazy, open-mouthed kiss, allowing Harry to take the lead. When Harry slipped his warm hands underneath his shirt, Draco moaned again. The touch of his mate, however careful, was enough to set a fire ablaze in his body, sending hot tingles of want all through him. It had been so long - during the end stretch of his pregnancy, he had been too tired to do anything anymore, even if he had wanted Harry - that he forgot to reciprocate, hanging against Harry in a half-drunken daze.
‘I understand,’ Harry nodded. ‘I was just wondering, doesn’t it hurt the school that there has been so much attention for Omega abuse lately?’
Draco looked at Harry, unsure of how to start, when Harry said: “I feel awful.”         Hermione nodded lightly. “And why is that?”
‘Harry, your report is abhorrent,’ Hermione complained, making Draco look up from his book and study the two. Harry glanced at Draco and he suppressed a smile.
Harry stepped in, placing an arm around Draco’s waist and holding him close. The sheer nearness of his mate made the nerves and feelings of unsafety dissipate within seconds.
“I can try.” Draco shuffled his feet forward so that the man could - hopefully - smell him, recognise him as Omega, as safe.
Adelaide smiled a gentle, forgiving smile, as to send the message that she understood, that it was okay.
At first, Victoria and Elizabeth were fine. But after a few minutes of sitting still, they became fussy. First Victoria, but quickly followed by Elizabeth. Draco didn’t feel ready yet to keep walking or go home, and bit his lip nervously.
With a laugh, the stranger turned and left the room, leaving the lights on again.
‘Oh, yes, I’m sorry.’ She smiled at them once more and then walked back to her family.
‘Good,’ Harry said and he placed his hand in the small of Draco’s back. ‘Do you want to look around first?’
Adelaide came closer again. “Oh Draco don’t cry…’
‘Maybe Harry could escort you, instead of me,’ Mrs Weasley suggested. Draco almost jumped, having forgotten that she was also in the kitchen.
‘Do you think they painted the school?’ Adelaide asked, standing just a few steps behind Harry and Draco.
Harry shrugged. “I mean… yeah. It doesn’t have to be big, just a small party… maybe.”
“Welcome to sunshine highlight,” Remus joked, but his tone was bitter. “The nicest room they have here. We must’ve gotten lucky.”
It felt amazing. Draco was stretched incredibly wide, almost painfully so and felt Harry’s hot come stream inside and he never, ever, ever wanted it to end. He moaned a little, ‘Harry…’
Have a great weekend everyone!
Draco started crying, but kept on kneeling and baring his neck as much as he could. He needed the approval, the acceptance from his Alpha.
“Safehouses, updated work methods, plans, codes, names and more.” Sirius nodded.
‘I thought I was fine at home,’ he eventually mumbled. ‘It wasn’t that bad… I just felt alone… most of the time but…’
‘It’s less scary than the lift.’ Harry dragged him along and stepped onto the staircase. Draco stayed close, like Harry had told him to, but felt a bit awkward when he noticed that some people were staring at them.
Also, I was in such a chatty mood after uploading the last chapter, I don't know what came over me!
“I don’t want a new mate.”
It was the wrong question to ask, as no one answered it for a good forty seconds. The silence was awkward.
Draco wanted to ask why she hadn’t asked that of him, but she added, ‘it is illegal to ask an Omega to view their memories and next to that, you told me that your memory is somewhat cloudy so it would not have been fruitful to ask you about yours.’
“What a fucking idiot.”
“Come change it,” Draco challenged, though his tone held no force.
“Not that kind of expansion,” Molly answered. She shifted, and carefully took off Adelaide’s scarf, revealing a fresh bond mark at the side of her throat. It went paired by a smaller, twin mark on the other side - one for Arthur, one for Molly.
Harry got up and gently pushed Draco into doing everything he needed to; getting dressed, eating and eventually into the floo. It illustrated perfectly how careful Harry was with Draco at all times, but also showed how easily Draco was influenced by Harry.
Harry pushed Draco out of the kitchen, ‘well, so far for the first living room and the kitchen. There’s a second living room right here…’ he opened a door and closed it again swiftly. ‘It’s used by Ron and Hermione mostly though,’ he said as he guided Draco up the stairs. ‘When I was younger I used to sleep in the bedroom right there,’ he pointed and the door opened. ‘It’s a guest bedroom now, where you and Adelaide will be sleeping tonight. There’s a bathroom attached, too.’ Harry showed Draco the bathroom and Draco gasped. ‘It’s huge!’
Adelaide sat on the other side of the sunroom, feeding Alexander and talking to him in a low, quiet tone. Draco couldn’t make out what she was saying, and assumed it wasn’t meant for him anyway. He sat on the chaise lounge near the French doors, and if he lifted his head, Harry was in his direct line of sight. The nearness of his mate comforted him, and once again, he worried about what he’d do when Harry would go back to work.
‘Please Harry please please please please,’ Draco begged.
Harry stretched and yawned, rubbing his eyes and leaving an ink mark on his brow bone. Draco chuckled. “I think it’s time for a break. How about a walk?”
‘No, that’s true,’ Neville chuckled, ‘I did behead a snake once though. I was digging a hole for a new flutterby bush – they only bloom once a century you know, so if you want to keep a colourful garden and attract the Eden butterfly you need to keep planting new ones and – what was I talking about?’
Trying to push his anxiety down, he thought of his children. At least they had only taken him, and not the twins. At least they were safe with Remus.
When Harry returned, both Omegas sat up straighter.
I'm looking forward to working on, and finishing the rest of this story.
Another leaflet was from St Mungo’s and provided general information about male Omega pregnancies. Interested, Draco flipped through it, thus finding out that it was indeed true that the bodies of male Omegas were not built for the (female) task of pregnancy. Depending on the type of bond the Alpha and Omega had, and the strength of the Omega’s magical core, the Omega’s body would not adept at all, in part, or completely to the pregnancy.
First, he took of all the bedding, and shook the duvet, eventually hanging it out the window so it could freshen up. He decided to wash all the blankets too, and picked out the things he’d borrowed from others. The apron Molly had donated didn’t smell like her anymore, anyway, and neither did the scarf and hair ties he’d nicked from Hermione. He put them aside with the plan to return all of the items to their rightful owners soon.
Draco huffed again, but he
He walked back over to Emma and took her by the hand, leading her to the swings. ‘Come on, I talked to them and now you can go on the swing too.’
“Yeah…” Harry agreed.
Adelaide shrugged. “You’ll just have to drink something else afterwards.”
Something in Draco snapped, making him forget about his boundaries and embarrassment. ‘Please, Harry, please, all of it, please, fist me, I need it, please…’
“Nothing so far,” Remus said. “Did Harry say anything before he left?”
‘I’ll give you a few minutes to get dressed. I’ll be right outside waiting for you.’ She stepped out of the room quickly.
Harry looked away.
“I’ll have dinner ready.” Draco pressed his lips against Harry’s whilst silently wrapping his arms around the Alpha, trapping him and keeping him close until Harry broke free from the embrace. “I really have to go now… I don’t want to be late. Last time I turned up late at the office Robards shouted at me for a whole fifteen minutes.” He pecked Draco on the cheek and rushed out the door, leaving Draco standing alone in the hallway.
‘Draco, wake up.’ Harry shook the memory-Draco gently awake. ‘Come on, you need to get dressed. I’ll bring you back to Molly.’
‘Thank you…’
“Are you still considering having another one?” he eventually asked. She’d mentioned something like that at Ginny’s birthday party, but they’d both been drunk and he wasn’t sure her statement had been all that reliable.
“Y-yeah.” Lupin’s eyes flitted nervously around the kitchen, trying to find the Alpha that had come in with him.
‘Get up. On all fours,’ Harry ordered and Draco hastily did as said.
When they broke apart, Harry murmured, “you know what, I think I’d rather lay down with you for a bit. We can take that walk tonight.”
Soft lips scattered kisses across his lower back, ‘I know, I’m right here, it’s okay…’
The appointment went much like before; Draco settling on the settee with Harry, both peppermint teas, a short chat about what Healer Roberts was going to do and then Healer Roberts was muttering spells under her breath and looking at them and a set of stones on her desk. Once she dropped her wand, she gave them a minute to gather their thoughts, before asking, “so how are you feeling?” It was an open question, and one clearly directed at the both of them.
“He is,” Remus confirmed. He scooted a little closer to Sirius, creating a maximum amount of physical contact, glueing himself to the other from ankle to shoulder. His arm was limply wrapped around Sirius’ waist, and Sirius had copied his posture. His fingernails dug into Remus’ side hard enough that Draco could see the outline of his ribcage even underneath the layers of clothing he had on.
“I…” What was he supposed to say?
he thought dazedly as he brought his hand up to stroke Harry’s back. Slowly intertwining his fingers in Harry’s messy hair, he tried to focus on breathing through his nose because with Harry’s weight crushing him and teeth preventing him from moving too much, breathing became difficult quickly. ‘Harry…’ he managed to say, ‘I can’t breathe.’
There weren’t enough seats to seat everyone at the large kitchen table, so everyone filed back into the living room. Molly took her place in front of the fireplace, and Arthur stood a step behind her, on her right side. She waited for everyone to quiet down, before stretching her arm towards Adelaide, who rose from her seat to join Molly and Arthur, fitting herself between them and playing with the edges of her scarf nervously.
“Sorry, does it hurt?” Harry sounded hoarse when he asked. Draco shook his head ever so lightly in a negative answer, even though he knew that Harry would immediately know it was a lie.
The clothes were coarse, not as soft as he was used to. They also were a few sizes too big, as she had said they would be. The fresh change of pants however, fit him perfectly and he blushed, thinking that she must’ve helped him in and out of fresh clothes at least a few times by now. The fact that he had burrowed clothing meant that he had nothing of his own so someone had to have gone out to but him new pants… Right?
‘No!’ Adelaide and Draco said un unison, making Draco add, ‘I think we need to make teams. I’m team werewolf.’
“The room” - or what Draco assumed was the room the stranger had referred to - was no bigger than a hallway closet, and contained a bed with chains. Crabbe pushed him onto the bed, first chaining his ankles, then undoing the binding spell on his wrists, and chaining those to the top of the bed. “Enjoy your stay,” he said with a wide, wicked smile, showing his yellowing and rotted teeth. Draco once more gathered the spit in his mouth, but was too late to spit Crabbe in the face.
“I’m pregnant.” Throwing the words out felt like such a relief, and his shoulders slumped down, the tension in his neck and back suddenly gone.
‘Alright, I’ll ask your sister about that,’ Harry said, making some notes on his parchment.
‘Christ you’re so wet…’
‘How long… how long… have I… been here?’
He could hear Harry’s breath catch in his throat and then, a raspy, hoarse, ‘fuck, Draco.’
‘Or Harry and I could visit as a couple,’ Draco said quietly, unsure about his own idea. He and Harry hadn’t bonded yet  but it wasn’t uncommon for Alphas to want to speak with the teachers, tutors or mentors the Omega had had. It could also imply that Draco was pregnant, because there was a day-care centre at Myrion as well, but Draco tried not to think about that.
“Kiss me again.” Maybe the trick to relaxation was physical distraction. Or at least, that was what Draco was hoping. He closed his eyes as Harry’s lips slid over his again, leaning into his mate and curling his fingers into Harry’s unruly hair. It made Harry gasp, and Draco used the opportunity to deepen their kiss whilst carefully rocking his hips against Harry’s.
‘Ha… Harry…’
Harry obliged almost immediately, crawling back into their nest with careful motions. Draco rolled over, all but forcing himself into Harry’s arms and made a tired noise. The Alpha answered the noise with a soft rumble of his own as he cradled his Omega closest he could, fingers smoothing over bruised skin with the softest of strokes.
‘Can I just say you two are the most adorable couple I’ve ever seen?’ An elderly lady had stepped closer and smiled at them. Draco blushed and looked at the floor. ‘Thank you.’
I couldn't control myself.
Adelaide squeezed Draco’s leg and he looked up. She pointed at Harry and Mrs Weasley and Draco turned his head, trying to listen to the conversation that somewhere along his musings had gotten a lot more heated.
“Oh, Draco…” Adelaide sighed and she moved closer, placing her arms around him and holding him gently. “I’m sure next time it’ll happen…”
Draco attached the bells to one of the posters and got down, stepping back a little to admire the result. “Well... Maybe... Fairy lights?”
“No.” He bent towards the shackles that held Draco’s ankles, murmuring a body stiffening spell to prevent him from kicking before ondoing the first shackle.
‘Blaise. I already thought you were acting weird.’ Draco hooked his leg behind Harry’s and pushed himself over to the other man’s lap, feeling bold. ‘There’s nothing between me and Blaise. Next to that, he’s a Beta, and why would I want a Beta when I have a perfectly functioning Alpha at my beckon and call?’ He couldn’t withhold a smirk.
Harry gently combed through Draco’s hair with one hand and watched him sleep. ‘You’re such a stubborn idiot,’ Harry muttered. ‘Who would refuse help during heat? You would, you little idiot…’
Draco did so and found warm hands on his arse, opening him up. He moaned when a finger slid in and moved back on it a little.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco blinked. “I...”
Harry yawned and blinked slowly. “Okay.”
“Are you going to hang glass baubles in them?”
“But I could feel through the bond that you... you knew something was wrong, right?”
‘I did hear something about Draco not living with his parents anymore,’ Miss Greengrass mentioned as she sat down again.
Draco grumbled his dissatisfaction. As he let himself sink down into the hot bath, his grumble turned into a purr of relief. Being in the water was an overall alleviating experience; it helped his sore, cramped joints relax and helped ease the insane muscle tension that came with his pregnancy anxiety. With a sigh, he leaned his head against the soft cushioned headrest. He closed his eyes and breathed out slowly.
‘Draco?’
‘My parents were saving me for someone.’
Again, Draco could hardly register the words. “I need Harry.” He could still feel his mate through their bond, but it was a numb, far-away feeling. He couldn’t tell if it was because of the literal distance between them, or because Harry closed himself off when he was out in the field.
Harry moved a little and then sat up, rubbing his eyes. ‘Adelaide?’
“Molly liked Alexander better,” Adelaide shrugged, “and now he has the same initials as I do.”
Hermione, Ron and Remus were still in the living room. He could hear them talking as he entered the kitchen and grabbed himself a cup of tea. Then, he gracelessly waddled into the living room, standing still as he crossed the threshold and breathing for a few seconds to counter another trill of pain passing between his hips, cramping up every muscle it encountered between.
‘You can come,’ Harry, almost calmly, said behind him.
!’ Draco echoed.
Harry hummed again. “I’m sure any nest you build will be a good one.”
‘We will, because real people fight sometimes,’ Harry said firmly. ‘If we fight and you go into heat you can’t refuse my help again. It scared the living hell out of me last time, which is why I ordered you… anyway, heats are non-discussable. If you go into one, I’ll help you through it without you refusing what you need.’
‘You’ve thought about us being bonded? Sharing a life?’ Harry interrupted.
He bit his lip. It seemed like something that was only possible for ladies to achieve. He didn’t wear a skirt like hers. Some Omegas did, he knew, but he usually wore fitted trousers and a long tunic.
‘Good. Can I help you
Harry laughed again and it was such a nice, warm sound that Draco couldn’t help but purr a little. ‘You need an Alpha that will take good care of you, if you have that I don’t think heats are that bad.’
‘What is he denies?’ Draco asked thinly.
So lucky you, an extra long chapter!
‘I know, Draco,’ Mr Potter replied wearily, ‘I know…’
Draco had never met this man in his life before.
He pulled up the blankets and hid himself in them, waiting until the lady would come to wake him up.
‘What’s happening?’ Draco interrupted crudely, trying to hide how hot he was for the other man.
‘Sure Draco, whatever you need.’
‘Don’t bare your neck like that damn it, you don’t know what you’re offering.’
‘I assure you it was no problem at all.’
‘Very well.’ Queen Violet leafed through the paper and found something that mentioned the aforementioned name somewhere in the back. She cleared her throat and started reading. ‘Unusual appointment. Head Auror Robards has to temporarily do without one of the DMLE’s best aurors, has Mr Harry Potter has been appointed to help the Omega Regulation Office due to the influx of abuse cases. Mr Potter was not available for comment.’
“But I don’t think he should go back to Azkaban. Not for
The Ministry cut the ties between Riddle’s illegal Omegas, amongst who was Luna Lovegood.
When they stepped inside, Draco had to admit Harry was right; the shop was nearly empty save for one woman with white blonde hair sitting in the corner. Her face was obscured by the Daily Prophet, but Draco could see she sat with a straight back, perching on the edge of her chair like she was ready to leave any minute now. He sank down at a vacant table, leaving the ice cream-ordering to Harry. The women moved, her newspaper rustling and Draco was just about to ask her if he could have the review section, when Harry called out, “Draco, what do you want?”
