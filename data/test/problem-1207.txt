“You must be joking.” Malfoy blinked back, unamused.
Pansy fell into another peel of laughter and was gingerly wiping at her eyes. “You’re serious! Merlin help us,” she said between laughs. “Alright look, I know for a fact that can not be true. He’s doing it to spend time with you, you idiot.”
It wasn’t surprising then that Potter reached idiotic levels of martyrdom later in the memory, as he flung curses at two men who could have struck him dead with a single blast, though neither of them tried.
“Only a Lovegood could come up with a plan like that,” he said fondly.
“Here,” she shoved a branch with pointed green leaves into his hand, which he cracked and held under Diggory’s nose. His breathing immediately slowed.
“Do you still think about your old life?” asked Draco.
Harry folded his arms on his knees and rested his head on them. Now he was truly alone.
Hermione narrowed her eyes in his direction but didn’t respond, then turned up her nose to stalk off, nearly running into a waifish form that was crouched by a low hanging portrait.
“Admirable,” said Draco, attempting a smile at the loathsome creature.
“Yeah, funny thing,” said Harry, shrugging off his backpack as the dull buzzing began in his ears. “Dumbledore tipped us off, but it was me and my friends that tracked them down. The locket, the diadem, the cup, the diary. We found them all.”
which came zooming into her hands. “Every student is sorted into one of four houses. Slytherin are known for their cunning and penchant for the Dark Arts. Ravenclaw are wise and eccentric. Hufflepuff – that’s what Cedric was – are loyal and hardworking.”
There was something about the earnestness of his eyes, his fixed brow, that told more than what Harry was saying. Whatever story Draco was going to spin up about how he knew to ask about the diary he let fall. Harry already knew the truth.
“Yeah, it was,” said Harry in a huff, still trying to catch his breath. “I used to love that bike, but somehow when I was back on that street… I don’t know, it just reminded me of my shit cousin.”
For the first time he could remember, Draco had nowhere in the castle to go.
As Draco let Harry slip into his consciousness, he was reminded of their first session. It had been like a freefall, dropping through a patchwork of the most important points in Harry’s life. A skilled Legilimens would be able to lay out a curated collection of memories to peruse, but he wanted to see where Potter would take him, so he let them drift.
Far from being discouraged, Ollivander continued to grow more frenzied with each failed attempt. There were a few wands which reacted rather violently, shooting off showers of sparks. One had a greenish goo that dripped from the end, even when replaced in its box. “Kelpie hair. Always an inferior core in my opinion,” piped Ollivander, brimming with glee.
Harry paused. “You’re sure a Mrs Doubtfire gag is out of the question?”
“I think you better come back to mine,” he said in a low voice. “Will you?”
“How could you admire a man who sanctioned that?” asked Harry, his dark brows furrowing. “That’s not justice, it’s barbarism.”
Harry glanced around, eyes catching on the empty portrait frame. The certainty with which the man asked the question had him briefly questioning whether these really were his rooms—the shadows and the eerie glow from Snape’s incorporeal form made it look so different from the day.
“Sorry, I thought you were here to help me demonstrate,” said Cedric with a shrug, looking altogether too pleased with himself.
he said with a hint of laughter in his voice.
Perhaps he would be ginger, like one of the stupid Weasley lot. And if he were raised by Muggles, he would likely be walking around in some kind of foolish fashions, with many-pocketed trousers or slouchy terry cloth track suits Draco sometimes saw when he was forced to walk through the Muggle parts of London.
said Ivy.
Harry was thrilled to be out of the room, and couldn’t help but gape at the many moving portraits and twisting stairways they came across. It all seemed so much more vibrant and fraught with magic than it was the night he’d arrived.
Pansy turned back to him, her eyebrows knitted together.
“You’re right, Pansy,” he said, turning to wrap his arms around her waist. “It’s nothing to worry about.”
Angelica raised her eyebrows at him and then spun away to lean temptingly on the bed.
“Harry don’t!” squeaked Hermione, but it was too late — the wand let off a flash which crackled through the room like a blown fuse, leaving them with their staticy hair sticking straight up.
But Harry knew exactly what he was looking at. He quickly inverted the flaming sword, held the hilt in two hands, and plunged it into the centre of the diary, sending black ink flying like dripping blood from a wound. He looked up to meet silver eyes as Lucius Malfoy nodded curtly to him in understanding.
“Certainly. Anything for a member of the brethren,” said Borgin, his eyes darting to Draco’s left arm. “You
“Well that will be easy, after you’ve spent the last five years telling them what a good idea it is,” snapped Blaise, but then his shoulders slumped with a sigh. “Look, we need to get you out of here. Tell me what to do.”
Harry extinguished the light with a quiet “
“Sleeping in again, I see,” she said.
One afternoon a huge storm blew in while Cedric was still out of the house running errands. Hermione waited nervously by the window, pretending to read but compulsively glancing out through the curtains every few minutes.
“So he likes snakes, does he?” asked Harry. “Is that like a house thing?”
“That is exactly right,” said McGonagall. “Which is why I’ve enlisted the help of a few select others to help us prepare Mr Potter. It won’t be easy, but Miss Granger is drawing up a lesson plan for us tomorrow—”
Draco could almost see the pieces falling as Mr DuPont laid them out. He knew what was coming next, and it felt like a rock in his stomach.
“Yes, I recognise a few of these names,” said Draco evenly. He could almost feel his mark burning under his sleeve.
“Patient M was a Muggle,” he said under his breath.
“So what, she just turned up out of the blue?” Draco asked, his eyes darting to the fireplace instead of at Harry who was sprawled out on the couches, attempting to levitate the cover of a book open.
“Yes, thank you, Malfoy. If you’re done interrupting the lesson, I think we’re ready to move on,” said Cedric, as Draco turned and headed back to his perch. “Besides, signalling for help is one of the most important skills in an emergency. So I expect you to keep practising, Potter.”
“I’ll take your word for it,” said Harry, his voice wavering as the blond staggered to his feet, but quickly sunk back to one knee again, eyes screwed shut.
“No problem,” said Draco, his air shifting, he’d seemingly decided to brush off whatever was bothering him. “I’ve just never heard the voice of a snake before, but I must have been able to understand it through your memory. You’re a Parselmouth.”
“There’s nothing she can do to harm us now,” he said.
“I’m sorry we didn’t tell you sooner, but I knew it was something we had to do alone,” said Harry.
But waiting around wasn’t going to accomplish anything – it was time to fight.
“Malfoys,” said Draco, coldly.
Harry was trying to get his bearings as Draco’s panicked thoughts came flooding in, when suddenly there was another commotion at the door. All three heads snapped in that direction as Cedric, in his full Auror uniform, appeared slumped on the doorframe. His brow was wet with sweat and his face was flushed as if from a fever. He was blinking to focus his eyes, but could hardly stand up straight.
Borgin paused meaningfully at the name, though Draco couldn’t understand the significance. Gaunt was a terminated pure wizarding bloodline. That there could be any relic of theirs that was recognisable, moreover what the Dark Lord would care about it was a mystery.
“Come with me,” said Snape.
Shifting to the edge of the bed, Harry became aware of an oppressive weight around his neck, hissing in a breath as a chain shifted. He reached into his sleep shirt to pull out a heavy golden locket – Slytherin’s locket from the Riddle memory – and noticed deep scorch marks in his chest beneath it.
The first was Charlotte, walking on her own but her eyes were glazed over, unseeing. Draco knew in an instant this was the effect of a heavy Imperius Curse. The second, the man who controlled her, was Blaise.
“My pleasure, my boy!” called Ollivander as Harry and Hermione turned to head out of the classroom. “My profound pleasure.”
Harry dropped the backpack at his feet, where it fell with a metallic clatter.
“Professor? Do you know where you are?” asked Draco.
“Hello, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I expected I might be seeing you here.”
Of all the people that he had met at the castle so far, none had been as interesting as Malfoy. He seemed to have control over any room he was in, the way he easily captured the attention of others or took the upper hand in the duel with Cedric. Even his presence as an onlooker in Harry’s memories had become familiar, comforting even. And yet he hardly knew anything about him.
“Alright,” said Draco with a shrug, and Pansy smiled prettily. “See you professor” he called, collecting Pansy under one arm as he draped it around her shoulder and guided her back out into the hallway.
“Be that as it may, I do have concerns,” said McGonagall, looking down her nose with a crease of worry between her brow. Or was it pity? “With a bit more time and guidance, we may be able to help you gain more control over your magic.”
“No one is surprised that you’d get too drunk to apparate yourself home if that’s what you mean,” Draco said, closing the gap between them and pushing Harry back against the wall of the alley, leaning down to kiss him again. “And yours?”
“Making an attack harder to block, for instance,” said Cedric, grinning as he took a few steps out of the mist.
was premature. Carrow and Yaxley are being punished accordingly.”
Draco stood rooted to the spot for a moment, trying to make sense of what had just happened. Had they been arguing? He couldn’t even remember. All he could think of was the kiss and getting out of this damn club and back into Harry’s arms.
“I saw what happened to Al’s hand,” said Harry, shaking his head at the memory. “I wasn’t about to give that a try. “
If the Dark Lord could defeat a wizard as strong as Dumbledore with a single ring imbued with soul magic, he really would be impossible to stop.
“Learned a few tricks, have you?” said Voldemort’s voice. A force whipped through his mind like wind blowing open a door, and his feeble attempts to Occlude were knocked back. His eyes were jerked open. “Now don’t be rude in front of company.”
“So Peeves stole Dumbledore’s Deluminator and removed every light from the castle on the night of the Christmas feast?” asked Harry, his cheeks red from laughing so hard.
“The priority here is defensive magic; Disillusionment, diversion, shielding if we can get to it. If you want offensive magic, join the duelling club,” said Cedric.
“Not a chance,” snapped Draco. “Thought you could come waltzing in here and beat me at a muggle sport, did you? Oh, it’s on. I’m going to crush you at this game.”
“Wizards do.”
“The disagreement?” he ventured.
“You don’t know me anymore,” said Draco, taking a few sauntering steps away. “Now run along to the common room, and don’t let me catch a word of this to anyone else.”
“I’m sorry,” he said, under his breath. “We took a risk in coming here to end things, but now I’ve put everyone in danger. The one thing I wanted was to save you, you idiot. You should have waited. We could have planned for this. Without you, it all falls apart.”
A strange silence settled over the two of them as a cold breeze blew through the park.
Before he could get close, Harry jerked them out of the memory. His eyes flicked open with a gasp. He looked around, regaining his bearings and breathing in heavily.
“Thanks for the invite. I was going a bit stir crazy at home,” he said, casting a smile in Draco’s direction before turning to Mr DuPont’s and extending a hand. “Nice to meet you, sir.”
Damn, just his luck. Looked like he’d have to make early use of the cover story after all. He sucked it up and put on a placating expression.
“You and me both,” said Harry. Draco could feel the warm breath of his laugh across his lips as he pulled Harry down on top of him.
“You know what? Better just make it four black coffees,” said DuPont, as he settled back on the settee.
Once Hermione started in on a diatribe about wizarding politics, the boys were quick to make themselves scarce, changing the topic to the most recent Quidditch scores as they made their way through the castle.
“Well, I’m not going to say Slytherin,” he said. “He’s too easy to read.”
He dashed through a corridor, glancing over his shoulder at the far end of the hallway which loomed into darkness. A flutter of fear in his chest kept him moving in the opposite direction towards his mother’s voice, but was large enough to be detected by Potter, who seemed interested in what lay in the dark corridor towards the north wing of the house. Draco was not about to show a sliver of that.
said Harry, getting reluctantly to his feet and approaching the desk. He popped open Ivy’s terrarium and reached in gingerly as she twined around his fingers.
“Thought that’d cheer you up,” said Hermione with a satisfied smile as she flopped into an armchair by the fire. “Now we only need to figure out how to play them.”
“When you’re out, you may need help,” said McGonagall, her expression softened with concern, pressing a hand to his arm and squeezing.“Contact the Order of the Phoenix. They will come to your aid.”
“It’s best for Harry if we can keep to a schedule for optimal learning,” said Hermione. “Studies show you learn 30% faster if your magic has time to replenish properly.”
“I’m sorry Professor, but if we want to keep Harry’s lessons on course, I really must insist that we stick to the condensed curriculum,” said Hermione, rummaging in her bag for the timetable. “He’s making so much headway these days, I’d hate to deviate from the plan and risk a setback.”
“Damn, I’m sorry Luna.” Harry felt a sudden pang of guilt for all the times he’d shown Luna what his illicit spell combos had yielded. “We’ve been experimenting loads with charms, I never would have asked if I’d have known.”
“I know as much as you do, dearest,” said Pansy in a soothing tone. “Now come sit while we wait, you’re frightening the other guests.”
“Sorry, Luna. I hope I didn’t frighten you,” he said, her expressions instantly softened in relief.
“I do. I’ve seen it play out far too many times to think otherwise,” said Draco.
As the other men left the room, Harry found himself face to face with Voldemort. His damaged skin looked healed, but there was little else Harry could see that humanised him. His face had a pallid, waxy complexion, and he gazed at his own reflection with an unsettling expression of mirth.
“Umbridge… Coming,” said Cedic, weakly. Hermione bit her lip.
“Luna, have you seen much of the others lately?” Harry asked, attempting to sound nonchalant.
“A Disarming spell can be used on anything someone might be holding, but of course it’s most useful to strip an opponent of their wand if you can,” said Cedric, resuming his position. “Of course in real conflict, you won’t have as much time to think –
“You could say that,” said Hermione, running a hand through Harry’s hair. “What are we going to do about this hair? Maybe lighten it a tad.” She flicked her wand, and Harry felt a tingling sensation on his scalp. Hermione nodded approvingly and turned Harry’s face to the side.
The one thing he did know was that if he was going to get any closer to the memory of the green flash, it was with Malfoy’s help. And beyond that he was desperate to get back to Charlotte. There was nothing for him here. Was there?
“It changes the properties of the object, but I think it will work on most non porous substances,” said Harry, balling up a piece of scrap parchment and aiming his wand at it. Casting the charm, the paper puffed up like a loofa and lifted gently off the table a few centimetres.
“I know right! It always cracked me up how much weight you English put on lineage. But in America, we know someone’s only worth how much money they’ve got in their pockets, not what kind of blood they’ve got in their veins. Don’t let all this Dark Lord mumbo jumbo fool you.”
The last piece of the puzzle clicked. Angelica’s spread from so many days ago had predicted that a force of change would come into his life. Someone who was adventurous and foolhardy and brave and lucky. For once, he wasn’t even annoyed to be thinking of the cards. Harry was his Knight of Wands.
“It’s alright Kreacher, just clean it up,” said Draco.
To his surprise, Voldemort instructed Carrow to crack a bottle of port and pour a glass for everyone. His eyes glinting in the enchanted flames, he raised a glass in toast.
“I’ll never look at a lawn ornament the same way again,” said Harry, shaking his head. “Gnomes, elves, next you’ll be telling me that mermaids exist.”
“You knew.” Harry took a step back reflexively. “You knew all along they were magic. That I was magic? How could you not tell me?”
Dumbledore chuckled lightly, the half-moon glasses on the end of his nose bobbing. “I need a great deal more than that. A dose of common sense would have gone a long way.”
“I can understand your frustration, Harry, and we want to help,” said Hermione. “But after the events of last night, I think we can be certain that this is even bigger than we thought it was. He Who Must Not Be Named has announced his return, and it’s no coincidence he did it on the night you were nearly taken.”
“Right,” said Harry, turning to pace down the room. “So where do people go when they have cursed objects? There’s got to be somewhere that can perform an analysis on this.”
Umbridge looked searchingly around the room until her eyes landed on the life-size portrait of Dumbledore that hung behind the desk, gazing down on McGonagall’s crumpled form below.
“Harry never seems to want to talk to me.”
“Burkhart with an attempt on goal,” said the announcer, as a green-clad Chaser sped towards the centre hoop.
Fuck. The wheels of Dracos brain were spinning at full tilt but he wasn’t sure if there was any way to get out of this one. He was so close to having everything in place, he would just have to man up and seal the deal tonight. That was, if he even could. Difficult as it would have been with Angelica on a good day, he was in a particular state today.
Luna summoned Harry’s backpack, which he had not yet unpacked, and began unshrinking all the books.
Hermione considered this for a moment, searching Harry’s face for the underlying sentiment that he was sure she’d already guessed by now.
Draco’s eyes flicked around the room before settling on Harry. “I’ve heard the word before, from my mother,” he began, quiet yet composed. “It’s a type of magic that fractures the very core of a person, and only done at significant cost.”
“I know what you are thinking,” said Snape, gliding around from behind the desk, closing in on Draco. “I know the feeling of being the one with the knowledge that will undo your enemies. And I know the feeling of power that comes with giving it to the Dark Lord, but heed my words: The Dark Lord is unpredictable.”
“Don’t change the subject, you git!” said Pansy, stifling a laugh. She always got uncharacteristically giggly when an object of affection was brought up in conversation. “I just mean, what if you never get another chance like that with Harry again?”
Harry turned to look at the blond, who was flipping pages in
“Toying with a mental link is not something you want to do,” said Draco decisively. “Something like what you’re describing is incredibly rare, I wouldn’t even know how to recommend controlling it, there’s no way to guarantee he’s not looking back the other way.”
“It’s over,” said Harry.
Then came a memory marked
When she lunged at him, he almost thought to reach for his wand but was surprised to find she had wrapped him in a hug.
“I can see right through you, you know,” said Hermione, lowering her voice. Draco felt a flicker of fear as she held his gaze and hoped it didn’t show in his face.
Draco helped Tonks move the crowd indoors and get mounted on the creatures. For some, he had to guide their hands to find the Thestral’s body, but for far too many, they could already see with their own eyes. They had just enough when they matched up families and small children, and Draco felt a sense of accomplishment that he – or some version of himself – had come up with a plan as hairbrained as this.
He turned on his heel down the 7th floor corridor towards the library, with Granger’s nicked Restricted Section pass in his hand.
“If you say so,” said Harry, looking unconvinced. “Look, for what it’s worth, I don’t really care about learning Occlumency.”
“Not to mention it’s long been rumoured in his circle of followers that You-Know-Who never believed that Harry was killed. It’s too much of a coincidence not to be true,” said Luna. Hermione turned to her, a dumbfounded expression on her face, to which Luna replied. “What? It was in the
“No, I – that’s not what we wanted,” stuttered Pansy.
“It’s not that serious, Draco,” she said, fixing him with her pretty blue eyes and nudging him with her shoulder. “I’ll understand if you can’t hold your own against me.”
“The only other way we can ensure his safety is if Harry can defend himself,” said McGonagall resolutely. “I couldn’t have picked a better set of teachers – Auror Diggory on Defence Against the Dark Arts, Miss Granger on Magical Theory and general knowledge, and Mr Malfoy on Occlumency.”
“No. Thank you, Neville. We were only talking about poetry,” said Luna, wandering away gracefully down the hall, calling, “Beedle?”
If he were on good terms with Draco, which he was not, there would probably be a Bond joke in there somewhere that they would both find funny, but as it was, they were on strictly working terms.
“Fine, you can tell her I’m ready to go,” called Harry after. “And we can all be done with this little arrangement for good.”
“You’re suggesting I actually befriend him?” asked Draco, sauntering back toward the deck. He had considered a cursory friendship, of course, something to smooth over the rough edges of their first interaction. But to play into the ruse, to draw out the trust as a double agent, that would be devious.
“It’ll look strange to Ollivander to have a student under a Disillusionment Charm and we might not have a chance to remove it without another student seeing. McGonagall doesn’t want to let him into the Fidelius, so we have to be sure he won’t be able to identify you by your looks. Now hold still.” Hermione leaned forward with her wand outstretched.
said a small voice by the desk.
as they stepped over thick roots and a carpet of fallen leaves. Entering a clearing, Luna gasped quietly and beckoned Harry over.
“What? I’m talking about you! They’ll kill you if they—”
Draco stalked down the east stairwell, fuming. Who did Potter think he was, anyway? Trying to resist him without a wand or any idea what he was doing. With the amount of pressure Draco had been applying on his memories he could have obliviated himself, the idiot.
” she said.
“It’s like Mission Impossible,” said Harry with a laugh, accepting the cold glass. “McGonagall picked right, I think. Cheers.”
“I’m with Hermione on this one,” said Cedric, tossing his quill on the coffee table and sitting back against the settee. “The Death Eaters will already be looking everywhere for you. Dangling you where we think they’ll be looking is playing with fire, and the tradeoff is what, maybe ten minutes to search the unguarded sections of the Hall before they realise the ploy and come back to home base? The chances of one of the four of us being captured are extremely high.”
“Excellent idea,” said McGonagall. “Oh, and Miss Granger, do try your best to get him to trust you, yes? Harry needs someone he can believe in.”
Harry pulled out the creased photo of his parents with the Order that they had looked at hundreds of times over the past few weeks, trying to identify everyone in the photo. Many were unidentifiable, some were deceased.
Wormtail wrung his hands and glanced at the snake nervously. “I’ve tried to find him once or twice, but I’ve never managed to get to him in time. He always… disappears.”
“I sometimes wonder what kind of life she was trying to get back to, you know,” said Luna, holding a hand close for Ivy to wind around. “That’s why my father always says it doesn’t do to dwell in the past.”
Satisfied, the Dark Lord withdrew and Draco found himself winded and shaking in the light of the blue flames of the Library.
“That’s just the thing. Our source has run dry.” Lucius’s facade finally fell into a look of grim seriousness. “I had hoped that one of you might know more before I apply pressure.”
She turned the book to the other two, showing a picture of a golden chalice engraved with the image of a badger. Draco’s hand tensed reflexively on his teacup – he recognised it immediately.
But Snape had started doing something Draco had never seen, nor even thought possible. He was laughing. His shoulders bounced with quiet laughter as he shook his head, his dark hair falling in front of his eyes.
“Oh, so he’s doing alright then,” said Harry, sagging in his chair a little.
Harry shut his eyes and started sifting through happy memories. Charlotte immediately came to mind, as did his chess games in the park with Al, both of which felt too personal to be sharing with this pointy-faced stranger. No, better to go with something benign.
“Golf, of course!” DuPont replied with a chuckle.
Draco stood on the other side, a distinctly unimpressed look on his face. His eyes trailed downwards, and Harry was painfully aware of his shirtlessness, the tattered state of his pajama trousers, and the dressing gown that made him look far too like Minerva. He pulled it around him for protection.
With Voldemort’s hold on the Ministry increasing, Cedric recommended they avoid corresponding at all with each other over the holidays, using the Galleon only in case of emergencies.
“He’s not to take the Mark until he finishes school. Promise me,” she demanded into his shoulder. “Draco gets to make his own choices.”
“Alone at last,” he said in his best attempt at a calm voice.
“She’s well connected at any rate,” said Harry with a shrug. “She got me into Aparecium originally. It’s pretty great here, don’t you think?”
“So? What did you think?” asked Harry, still breathing heavily.
“Harry doesn’t know Legilimency,” scoffed Hermione.
“Alice Longbottom. Neville’s mother,” said Draco. “The Dark Lord was attempting a regeneration spell to strengthen his corporeal form. He’s tried it for years with members of the Order he could get his hands on or other wizards who defied him, but it never seems to last. At some point he falls apart and needs to complete the spell again.”
“Meaning… he has had to hide his powers? Has this stunted his development?”
“I have a plan,” he said.
Draco sighed as he finished reading through the letter again. It just wasn’t making any sense.
“You look like you’ve been up all night,” said Hermione as Harry struggled to concentrate on moving his quill in the
The thought occurred to him that there was a Tonks in this world too. Was she an Auror? Draco didn’t even know. If the Order existed in this world, maybe she would be part of it.
Draco took a seat obediently and tried to recall anything about his life in this version of the world. The woman at the stove hummed as she cooked, cracking a couple eggs and tossing the shells into the sink. The tune sounded a bit like a lullaby his mother used to sing to him, but it was punctuated by a yelp as she burned her hand on the pan and her hair immediately turned a deep scarlet. A Metamorphmagus.
First thing the next morning, Draco was down in the Potions corridor, ready to give Snape a piece of his mind. He’d let his Head of House be mysterious about his connection to the Potters for too long, and he needed answers. Whatever it was, Draco was sure it was no coincidence Potter shared the gift of Parseltongue with the Dark Lord.
“Hermione, it’s fine. If we get into a scrap, I’m sure we can get out of it. I might not be able to Apparate but I’m not completely helpless, you know,” said Harry. “It’s a calculated risk, we already decided. Right, guys?”
“Oh, excellent,” she said, taking a few strides past him into the room. “I found her wandering around in the Divination tower, but she seemed quite lost. Where shall I put her?”
“Oh, it wasn’t just me,” said Harry with a smirk. “How does it feel to know a Muggle-born witch was the one who figured out how to destroy you?”
His hands trailed lightly down the spines of the books in the secrecy charms section of the library, but he’d been reading up for weeks and there was nothing on how to break a Fidelius anywhere. He paused at the end of the row. The library was practically empty at this hour, and there was one last place he could check.
Draco huffed a laugh and backed off. “Be careful not to piss me off, darling. Best not to forget I have friends in high places.”
Draco was about to urge him out of the memory when there was a commotion in the water and Harry looked around, catching sight of his fat cousin flailing not too far off. He was moving swiftly out to sea, his head falling below the surface once or twice, unable to get out a sustained call for help. In a split second, Harry was off, paddling toward the pudgy Muggle.
“What would you give to go back to your normal life? As if none of this ever happened.”
“Not even the Dark Lord has the answer to that question.”
“I remember him,” said Hermione, holding a picture of a man in a purple turban. “He had a stutter.”
But Harry could hardly hear her.
“Hardly, but at least we learn from the past.”
“No!” screamed Harry, running at the hooded figure shooting off every spell in his arsenal. Why hadn’t she left when she had the chance? The creature seemed to be sucking the colour from her face until Charlotte’s body went limp, the light draining from her eyes. “Charlotte!”
“You’re on,” said Harry, moving the black pieces back towards his side of the board as Draco placed the white. “I’ve been waiting for a chance to beat you at something.”
“Still,” said Draco, settling back against a pile of cushions with his arms crossed. “Seems incredibly ineffective. Hypnotising all of these women to turn them into biological weapons. Surely there are more efficient means of—”
“Take these,” said the Potions Master evenly. “A few phials of Invigoration Draught and a girding potion I prepared under the assumption that it is unlikely either of us will get much sleep with the added stress of our new… guest.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, and he meant it.
Snape was looking away again, rummaging in his desk for a new quill.
“Patience,” said Draco, keeping his eyes on the board. “A good strategy takes time.”
Maybe with a bit more context he could figure out how to access the memories on his own. He’d rather not have to spend the time with Malfoy if he could help it, though he had to admit, the look on Malfoy’s face when Harry showed him his first experience at a Muggle cinema was pretty priceless.
Cedric glared angrily out the window at the snowy street outside. Hermione looked on the brink of angry tears.
“And I suspect the production cost is substantially cheaper. You can probably machine produce chemicals, whereas you need an alchemist to individually manage any potions production. Then there’s the question of quality control.”
“Shrub has taken the liberty, as the draught has been seeming to help sir of late after long nights at the Pensieve,” said the elf uncertainly.
“We were—” started Draco.
“I wonder what it says about you that your favourite memory is of a Muggle sports team winning and you getting the shit kicked out of you.”
“Now listen here, you over-inflated—” McGonagall started, rising to her feet to look Umbridge in the eye. But within moments, the four Aurors were around the desk, one of them pointing his wand directly at her chest.
Her words had the ring of sagely advice, and for the first time he considered whether he and Angelica really could be evenly matched. Of course, the marriage would be a front, as many marriages in their circle were, but maybe behind it all, there was a chance for actual friendship.
“What is it, Granger?” he snapped, not breaking his stride. “I thought we agreed you wouldn’t approach me in public.”
“Get over here, you big idiot,” said Blaise, enveloping Draco in a massive hug.
“And Parseltongue, while a rare gift, is not a mark of evil. It is a common misconception that it is dark-aligned.”
“Is this a bad time?” asked a sly voice from the door.
“But my Lord, he’s still only 17, practically a child. Surely he’s been punished—” Lucius spoke in clipped tones.
“Here, to keep the ennui at bay,” said Draco, handing the paper to Harry, open to the sports section. “It’s not much but they recap the Quidditch highlights at least.”
Over the course of the few weeks he’d spent in England, Mr DuPont had occupied his time with various business meetings and fancy meals with old acquaintances. This would be one of the first opportunities for Draco to have prolonged one-on-one time with him since he and Angelica had arrived. Although the one or two accounts he’d heard from his father years ago about Mr DuPont were that he was an oaf, and a bleeding-heart muggle sympathiser to boot, Draco was determined to get on his good side.
McGonagall came to an abrupt halt, looking at Harry like she hardly recognised him. “Well, Mr Malfoy, it appears as though Potter has explained enough for the both of you,” she said, blinking between the two.
“Likely story,” challenged Hermione, though there was a sympathetic lilt to her voice she tried to cover. “And I suppose Malfoy is your best friend, is he? Forgotten all about Ron.”
Pansy’s hand stopped creeping across his shoulder, and her voice took a serious tone. “It has to do with You-Know-Who, then?” she asked.
“Yes, I have heard of the mental link from my father,” said Draco. “And you feel confident the boy is in Hogwarts, my Lord?”
“Oh my goodness, you are hilarious,” she said, grabbing a hair tie off her wrist and gathering her hair into a ponytail. “I mean, talk about dedication.”
The most important accomplishment of the break was that he was able to successfully extract Helga Hufflepuff’s cup from the Gringotts vault with no incident. The goblins had barely blinked when he turned up on an errand for his mother to withdraw some of her precious jewellery for the annual New Year’s Eve ball (which, of course, did not happen). As his hand closed around the golden cup engraved with a badger, he could feel its latent power and was sure that it was indeed another Horcrux.
“Is he bothering you, Luna?” asked Neville, puffing up his chest in Draco’s direction. Draco shook his head in disbelief.
As they began to take off, Draco heard a shout from the far end of the street. A group of three dark figures came clamouring into view, spouting off stunning spells in their direction. Tonks responded immediately, putting up a shield on their side of the street. More than half of the pack was still on the ground.
Harry tried not to smile as the face of a petulant blond came swimming into view. It was all making sense now – Malfoy, Hermione, and he had gone off on their own looking for Horcruxes. That would explain why he had this thing around his neck. Now all he had to do was see how far progressed they were at destroying them.
Draco looked from Luna to Harry, who still had his mouth open. “What, that really happened?” Harry nodded.
“Oh shush,” said Hermione, flapping her hand, her cheeks flushed. “You never even took half the classes I spent time in that year. Though I have to say, Divination and Ancient Runes were a total waste.”
The two of them stalked the last few paces to their balls and stood in tense silence till Harry could take his next turn.
“That’s a funny one innit!” said Hagrid, slapping his thigh. “The entire world already knows Harry survived. They’re calling him the boy who lived!”
“Phoenix feather, just as I suspected,” Ollivander muttered to himself with glee as he replaced the trial wands in the case and reached for the final box. “Unless I am quite mistaken, Mr Dursley, here is the wand you’ve been looking for.”
“Happy to do my bit,” said Draco with a smug grin.
“The Dark Lord has assimilated me into the brethren,” said Draco. “Just like we always dreamed of.”
“This is what Hermione must have meant in the diadem,” said Harry, speaking in a quiet voice to the others so as not to upset Kreacher. “I can't believe I didn’t put it together before; she said the real locket was in the possession of a house-elf that belonged to my godfather.”
Hermione sighed and turned back to her book. “If you’re trying to ask whether I’ve heard from your so-called ‘best friend’ since he walked out on us, you can stop it. He hasn’t contacted me. And your being weird about it doesn’t help me take my mind off how much I loathe him right now.”
“Oh. That,” said Harry, rolling over to his side. “I never was one for prophecies.”
“Take this,” said McGonagall, opening a desk drawer and handing Hermione something that clinked musically. “Only withdraw what’s relevant for the research.”
“Please bring him back,” she whispered, her thin arms tight around his shoulders.
shouted Harry, as the burst of magic hit him, drawing his wand down the blade. Like a funnel of his magical energy, flames of Fiendfyre licked out like a blowtorch, turning the goblin wrought steel white-hot and glowing.
“Who else would I be talking about? It’s clear he terrifies you,” said Harry, leaning forward finally to reach out to his friend, laying a hand on his arm and fixing him with a solemn stare.
Draco looked at the beleaguered group and felt a pang of sadness and something else – anger? – as it dawned on him what type of transport he’d be running out of London. Refugees.
“That’s six then!” said Hermione. “All that’s left to do is find the diary.”
With the crowd in the room thinning, Harry could see the faces of their friends emerge, looking worse for wear but invigorated with the fight. Even Charlotte, who had been protected by Blaise at the start of the attack, was now standing back to back with him, wielding the discarded sword, and holding off any remaining adversaries alongside him.
“Thanks,” he said, aiming his wand at his own temple. “You just need to reach out your consciousness to meet with mine.”
roared Voldemort, and the room was silent as the grave.
“Of course,” said Draco, as DuPont waited expectantly. “… Eddie.”
“Harry was just asking about V—He Who Must Not Be Named,” said Hermione. “To get some answers about the men who attacked him.”
Harry’s attention whipped back to Voldemort, who was tottering on his feet, and fell to his knees in front of the great, black chair.
“Three times down the corridor,” McGonagall was saying as the two walked down the tapestry-laden hall. Snape had left them to remain in the dungeons, hopefully to get a grip on himself. “And then the room will appear. You are not to bring any other students with you, and I dare say you should come up with a good recurring excuse to have no one following you whenever you plan to visit Mr Potter.”
“And all this time, ever since her death, you’ve worked for Dumbledore,” said Draco, still trying to put the pieces together himself. “Right under the Dark Lord’s nose.”
Hermione looked put out by this, but held her tongue.
“That is what I would have thought as well,” said Voldemort tapping a finger to his chin and walking in a slow circle around Draco. “Though you would have told me by now if you could. Wouldn’t you, Draco?”
“Excellent, excellent,” said the old man, turning to his case and propping it open. “Well, not to fret, I have a feeling we’ll find your match today.”
Draco sat anyway, on the side of black. The men at the other tables chatted sporadically, and the tree branches creaked overhead with the light winter breeze.
They wound their way through the first section of trees, Luna lighting their way with a small
“Ah. Well, your father is one of several prestigious investors in my firm. I manage what’s known as private equity. Are you familiar with the term?”
“As for you.” Snape slumped back in his chair, fixing Draco with a scowl. “I had hoped I might keep this little habit a secret beyond an overly diligent house-elf. But I would ask for your discretion in the matter.”
“I’ll do my part if you do yours,” said Harry, gripping the arm of his chair, feeling like he was at the apex of a roller coaster hill before he was sucked down another memory freefall.
why you recommended to McGonagall to put the guardian wards on the door, isn’t it Granger?”
“Looking stiff there, Potter,” Draco called as Harry was getting back into place. “Should we owl Lockhart and see if he can come take all the bones out of your arm?”
will announce he perished alongside his parents. It is the only way to protect him.”
In a moment of weakness, his subconscious tried to block his memories of Harry, but when the Dark Lord cast his piercing gaze there, the Fidelius held up. Draco was astonished to see his own memories of Potter, simply… not there. He saw duelling practice, nighttime flying, even dinner around the table in the Room of Requirement, with everyone but Harry.
“If she did, do you think you would have come?” asked Harry, attempting to sound lighthearted but feeling strangely apprehensive about the answer.
“I don’t want to know,” laughed Harry. “But where are all your friends? Surely you would have a million memories with Pansy and the rest.”
“Of course.” Draco sat back in his chair, grabbing his glass of wine and putting on an air of easy conversation. His father wasn’t going to make it simple for him. “I remember it like it was yesterday; the first time the brethren gathered in this very room for the announcement of his return. I snuck out of bed and waited outside in the hall, desperate to be invited in.”
“I truly can’t see how I should care,” said Draco, turning to leave.
Hermione was enraged, but Cedric reminded her that the longer the Aurors were focused on discrediting Dumbledore, the less attention they’d have to spend on five wayward students.
“Me either,” said Draco. He wanted to return the look of hopeful earnestness, but the only thing he could remember from the encounter in the Headmaster’s office was McGonagall’s screams.
He took a few steps towards the water, wondering what it felt like, his too-big swim trunks flapping around his knees. He waded into the ocean; the waves lapping at his ankles. Excellent; the clarity of this memory was perfect, thought Draco. And Harry seemed to be very young here, maybe he could steer him earlier in his memories with relative ease.
What of the rumours of little Harry? He had survived, and in doing so had brought about the Dark Lord’s disappearance, Dumbledore had said.
Harry rose, his fists clenched in rage and cracking with magic.
“It’s not his graces I’m worried about,” spat Narcissa, shoving his arm off roughly. “It took us years to rebuild our reputation in society. Half my family’s fortune to buy back your seat in the Ministry. If we go down this road again there’s no going back.”
Gasping for breath, Harry burst awake in his room. He was covered in cold sweat and his scar throbbed, but he was definitely still in the castle. He jammed his glasses on his face and looked around the room, but nothing seemed amiss.
“McGonagall thinks he’s still alive,” said Harry. “If I survived once, maybe I’m immune to the curse. Maybe I can fight him.”
“Can you hear me now, professor?” Draco asked, perching on the edge of the desk and tapping his fingers nervously. It would be extremely inconvenient for Snape to go batty on him now when he was the only one in the castle Draco could trust. Moreover, because he actually liked the man. “You’ve got to kick that habit, it’s no good. Or next time I’ll be pulling your head out of the basin and your brain will stay in the past.”
Now was their chance. If they could leave after the Aurors, they may make it out without being seen. Harry shook Draco, and he nodded, understanding the plan. They began creeping around the perimeter of the room, careful to step over any of the spindly silver instruments and papers that littered the ground.
Harry froze. How Luna knew the things she knew, Harry would never understand, but he recognised his cue when he saw it. Taking a few more mouthfuls of potatoes, he pulled on his heaviest jumper and grabbed his bag from the foot of the bed. By the time he turned around, Luna was already back in her school robes, folding a few pieces of meat in a napkin.
“I should think we both know who cast it.” Borgin’s eyes narrowed. “Just as I know many who would pay a pretty price for this ring.”
“Not you, idiot, Tonks!” said Fred.
“Potter can give his own identity away, but we can’t,” said Cedric, realisation dawning on them all.
And then there was this strange attachment he was feeling towards Harry. Draco could have kicked himself for indulging in the whim to wear Harry’s clothes again. He’d convinced himself it was a trick; something to buy himself some camaraderie with the others. If they believed him to be sympathetic to Muggles, it would make his facade as a contributing member of Potter’s little vigilante team more believable. And yet. He knew that wasn’t really why he was wearing them.
“Damn,” said Draco, stepping back.
“It’s a shame your dear mother can’t be here to see you off, what with her health,” said Voldemort, who was sitting up and looking a little stronger than the first night Draco had arrived home.
“Not on our property at any rate. Filthy creatures, mermaids.”
“Merlin, fuck – Harry, is this another episode?” Draco tried to get a good look at him.
“You look like you’ve all seen a ghost,” said Malfoy cavalierly, faltering at the stony silence. Harry wondered how much the others knew about his attempted escape and decided not to give Malfoy away just yet.
“I already told you! The Ministry rounded them up and destroyed them. You know it’s really dangerous messing with time.”
“Struggling with something important to tell mummy dearest?” asked a silky voice over his shoulder, as Pansy craned her neck to read his scratched out parchment.
“The original locket was with a house-elf at your godfather’s house, Grimmauld Place,” said Hermione, talking very quickly. “In our timeline it was stolen and we had to go to the Ministry to get it, but if the Order of the Phoenix doesn’t know you exist it’s probably still there.”
But the novelty didn’t last long. Harry quickly countered the opening and was soon the first to claim a piece on the board.
“You’ve forgotten the lavender essence,” said Draco, as Theo frantically stirred the brown mass that was congealing. “And it’s not that I’ve been distracted, there’s just a lot on my mind, Pansy. What with Quidditch season approaching and NEWT-level coursework. Not to mention everything going on with the brethren.”
There was Yousef Salib, who had a habit of bringing his pet turtle to class under a very poor disillusionment charm. The turtle seemed to be multiplying; yesterday at least five of them had marched invisibly around class as Harry was trying to explain how to duel.
“Ask him yourself,” said Draco, turning to leave.
“Thank you for your… attentiveness,” said Snape. Shrubs ears perked up slightly. “You are dismissed, Shrub.”
“Harry’s relatives raised him as a Muggle,” said McGonagall.
“You can talk to me about it, you know,” said Harry. “You’ve seen everything about me, and whatever he did to you, I’m pretty sure I’ve had worse. So if it’s about maintaining some semblance of composure, you don’t have to worry about that in front of me.”
“Is he always this cagey?” joked Theo from Pansy’s other side.
“Is there an echo in here?” said DuPont, jabbing Draco in the ribs with his elbow. “Of course I would have thought you knew all about this. Angie said you wanted to talk to me about the old issues between our family. Though if I know Lucius, I’m sure he didn’t give you the full story — but I won’t speak badly of a man in Azkaban. And I’m happy to set the record straight.”
“Merlin,” murmured McGonagall. “I’ll see what I can do.”
Harry paused, his fork halfway to his mouth. “Sure, I’ll miss you guys. I’ll have to get back to my old life at some point, you know,” he said, tentatively. For all Luna’s airiness, she saw more quickly to the heart of the matter than one would think.
He covered his face with his hands as Harry sighed, willing himself to disappear. The Mark on his arm throbbed painfully. A warm hand closed around his right wrist and pried it away, pulling him closer.
“Close!” said Angelica, lighting up and pulling her feet up onto the edge of her chair. “Much closer than I’d thought you’d get. Ugh. In another world, we really would be perfect for each other, wouldn’t we?”
But beyond that, the book was incredibly vague. Instead, focusing on the political wins of Minchum’s successor, Millicent Bagnold, and the subsequent flourishing of the British wizarding economy.
“Well, that’s just it, it could have been a tiny thing that made the difference. You might have just gotten up an hour later one day and it put you on a completely different path for life.”
“We’ve covered
“Hardly,” said Draco. “You don’t know the type of scrutiny that’s on you as the only child of a pure-blood family. Lessons on everything since the time I could walk. Rules around how to spend my time, who to spend it with. It’s completely overbearing.”
“I take it this is a good sign,” said Draco. Picturing an altogether different partnership of opposing forces.
“Cedric will Apparate you within walking distance, and then the rest of us will be right behind you,” said Hermione.
“There’s only one thing you could be trying to do with this book,” said Hermione, as the pages rifled back to land on a chapter titled The Fidelius Charm. “You were trying to break Dumbledore’s spell.”
He could hear Angelica’s laugh ringing around the course as he stomped through the grass looking for his ball, scattering a few garden gnomes who were hiding there, including one that was holding his ball high above his tiny head with both stumpy arms. He knocked it gently out of the gnome’s hands with his club, which caused the gnome to double back and attempt to bite him on the ankle. By the time he looked up, Angelica was correcting Harry’s posture and pointing as though she were giving tips on the shot. When Harry chipped the ball onto the green on his next shot, she jumped up and down exuberantly and gave him a hug around the neck.
“Don’t look,” he whispered. Draco shut his eyes and laid his forehead on Harry’s shoulder. Something was terribly wrong.
“Yeah you know, the ‘Beautiful Game.’”
“Definitely,” said Harry. But the word sounded hollow. He pointed the wand and said, “
“I’m sorry, Potter, but this is for your own good.”
“She’s always one to put on a brave face,” said Lucius calmly.
“She’s always suspected it,” said Cedric, gathering the file together and not making eye contact with Harry. “It was one of Dumbledore’s last messages that Harry and You-Know-Who shared a mental connection. Hence the Occlumency.”
“I’m fine, Pansy. I wish to be alone,” said Draco.
“Harry, he’s weak!” Charlotte screamed, lunging forward to grab onto Voldemort’s robes and staring intently into his eyes. “He’s dying, Harry, he dies a little more every time.”
No, he had to win this duel. To prove it to himself if nothing else. He concentrated on building his magic up around him, feeling it coursing through his hands. Draco was still tossing taunts out from the far side of the hall, as Harry scowled, feeling the hairs on the back of his neck prickle with frustration.
Harry felt the tingling growing stronger in his fingertips as his anger built up inside of him, but for once he didn’t try to force it away. He was angry, and he wanted to be. The Death Eaters around him were growing restless as well, reaching for their wands and waiting for the command from their master that would unleash them.
“A few months ago, McGonagall gave me a Restricted Section pass to help with my research on Harry’s burst magic. Malfoy must have nicked it off of me to get this out of the library. I’m sure he thought there was no way I’d find out about it,” said Hermione, flicking her wand to the back cover of the book where there was a list of names and dates inscribed in beautiful print. “But I guess he didn’t realise the pass records the name of any student who uses it.”
“Professor I was wondering – Oh! Draco,” said Pansy, flushing slightly.
“There’s a diary,” said Hermione, hesitating. “Lucius Malfoy has it.”
He tipped the water into his mouth and placed the empty goblet back on the table.
“It looked like he was trying to help us avoid her,” said Harry.
“Do you not wish to know me?” asked the voice gently.
“The dark wing in the Manor. The way you go cold when you remember him,” said Harry. “I even felt your sense of dread when you locked eyes with him in the first Quidditch memory you ever showed me.”
“You don’t get it…” said Draco, regarding Harry with an expression that looked like pity.
“Well, it wasn’t a blown fuse, whatever that is,” said Draco, shaking his head at the memory. “It was madness. Roast turkey and boiled potatoes everywhere. Dumbledore made sure to hide his Deluminator after that. Matter of fact, we should see if he left it to you, it's one-of-a-kind.”
“Dementor. One of the prison guards of Azkaban,” said Cedric. “They’re not supposed to be anywhere near civilians, but the Ministry seems to be losing control of them.”
“But why would they do this to one of their own?” asked Hermione, giving Cedric’s hand a tight squeeze. “Cedric’s a good Auror, they could have killed him.”
“You don’t have to face him alone,” said Harry.
After a moment he could hear the light crinkling of gravel in Ivy’s terrarium, and looked up to see her small angular face. She’d slithered up to the glass, and was holding the first few inches of her body upright, like the boa constrictor in the zoo had done so many years before.
He stepped to the centre of the room, where Alice was forced to a kneeling position. Raising his wand he prepared to strike, hesitating only momentarily as she blinked up at him with curiosity. But it did not stop him. By the time all of the junior Death Eaters had had their turn, the former Auror was prone on the ground. Her eyes staring off to some far away place, as Voldemort cast the final spell.
Draco did his best to suppress a groan of annoyance. The longer it took Potter to get the thing floating, the longer he’d have to spend trawling through memories with him and putting off the rest of his priorities. And it had damn well better be worth it. He now had 13 inches to write on applications of Arithmancy in curse breaking, on top of a detailed star chart of the southern hemisphere for Astronomy, and hours worth of brewing for a Potions practical that he hadn’t started from the week before.
Draco’s smugness at how easy it was to get Harry onside was overridden with incredulity in an instant. “What’s Quidditch?” he repeated. “Only the greatest sport ever invented.”
“If it was that easy I would have done it,” said Harry, feeling the hair on the back of his neck prickle with frustration.
“Alright, Saint Potter, I’ll bite,” said Draco, stepping closer to him. “What would you have me do?”
Draco seethed. He couldn’t wait until he was on the seat of power next to the Dark Lord and Mudblood scum like Granger were knocked off their pedestal for a change.
“He has exactly what he needs,” said Harry.
“As long as it suits me,” said Draco, with a droll smile. “It would suit me better if you had any advice on how to break Potter.”
First, back to number four to get a few critical items for his life on the run. Then, over to Lilac Avenue, to pick up Charlotte, who had been informed by owl post to be waiting for him. The two of them would head to the train station and catch the last train of the night up to London, and from there they could go anywhere they pleased.
“I know, but I don’t think using you as live bait is really such a good idea,” said Hermione. “What if they separate us somehow, and I can’t Apparate you out? Or what if they don’t fall for it and the Hall is still too heavily guarded? It’s just too risky.”
“Why? Where are you going that’s so much better?” asked Draco.
Since their first kiss, everything had changed. Gone was the looming sense of dread that hung over Draco like a waking nightmare, even the burning pain on his Mark had seemed to subside. The worry over the Dark Lord and his split loyalties had all but evaporated after coming clean to Harry. And best of all, Harry actually liked him back.
“Are you kidding?” said Hermione, her fork halfway to her mouth. “You’ve learned all the year one charms and most of the defensive magic. You even picked up second-year mending charms in less than a week.”
“In that case, how can I say no?” said Draco with the best smile he could muster. This ended up being more a statement than a rhetorical question.
“I’d rather be nowhere with someone I love than anywhere alone.”
He was about to take a step away when a firm, steady hand gripped his elbow. He turned to look at Charlotte, who was staring at the scene with a look of abject disgust and determination on her face.
“You can’t honestly expect us to believe that,” said Hermione, turning to McGonagall for backup.
reports to the contrary.
“Your army weakens, boy. You do not have the strength,” he laughed, looking past Harry. The snake coiled at his feet like a pit viper ready to strike.
Draco looked down piteously at his Head of House, who had grasped his wand and was trying to withdraw a new silver strand of memory from his temple, but it was thin as spider’s silk.
“Yeah, but is it safe? Now that the entire wizarding world knows you exist, everyone will recognise that stupid scar wherever you go. McGonagall would protest, I’m sure.”
“I’m just saying, if you had a Time-Turner, it would certainly come in handy right about now,” said Draco, clearly egging Hermione on as she Transfigured her Muggle clothes back into school robes.
Instantly the room was swallowed in darkness, like Harry had just walked into a tunnel. As his eyes adjusted to the light, his vision was fuzzy.
“Oh, I guess so,” said Harry, unsure whether he was about to be interrogated.
“From what I can tell, Quirrell was just an average guy before he fell in with the Death Eaters at the end of the war. But being a bit of a loner and an outcast, he was the perfect target for You-Know-Who’s penchant for building a cult following, and ultimately took the Mark as a sign of his dedication. You-Know-Who may have even hand selected him in order to have a pawn to control within Hogwarts.”
“It’s a pity,” said Draco, taking a sip of his port. “But she always gets like this in the winters.”
“That’s what I love about the English, so polite!” he said with a deep laugh. “Actually, today will be my first time on this course. Which is funny, really, because we’re members at its sister club, Carnegie Abbey, back in Rhode Island.”
can kill a star as quickly as they can make one. But we’ve got to look out for our own and we’ve done that.”
“Why must you always be a martyr?” Draco snapped in his direction.
“Only just!” she called back. “Lucky shot. I reckon we catch back up on the next hole.”
With that, the Dark Lord motioned for Draco to be removed and strong arms clamped around his shoulders, dragging out into the vestibule where he collapsed.
“You’re not him,” said Harry firmly. “You are the choices you make, and you haven’t chosen to run to Voldemort’s side, you’ve chosen to defy him.”
“They’re the regular lot, mostly. Football at the local club, schoolmates, the usual,” said Harry, holding the wand gingerly as though it were a stick of dynamite that might go off at any moment. “My friend Charlotte and I are getting ready to go to university in the fall. Finally going to get out of our shit town, you know?”
“Careful,” said Draco, rising next to him and tucking a supportive arm around his back as he manoeuvred across the room. “If you end up injured on my watch, I’ll never hear the end of it from Granger.”
“The Potters were killed by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. The same night he gave you that scar,” said Luna, her enormous eyes glistening in the glow of her Lumos. “Everyone knows that.”
He started with Cedric the night he tried to run away from Privet Drive. He could feel Hermione’s presence like a light wisp, compared to the familiar sturdy feeling of having Malfoy in his thoughts. She flitted around the memory, trying to draw Harry’s focus or looking at small details, but not fighting it. He showed her his disbelief at the conversation in the Headmaster’s office, McGonagall taking him to his room, the picture of his parents.
“Oh, so you can go prying into my private business, but I can’t know about yours? What are you scared of? You think I’m going to run off and tell my death eater friends your secrets, is that it?” said Draco, shoving Harry back.
“But at some point you’ll have to pick a side. You can’t do both forever.” Draco moved a pawn forward to defend his king.
“I’m not convinced it is.” Harry inspected a final pawn as he placed it on the board. “Hermione disenchanted it but nothing’s happened.”
He turned to see the others sharing a look of indulgent patience.
“Defeat Voldemort,” said Harry, plainly. McGonagall looked like she couldn't decide whether to laugh or cry.
“We need to find her,” demanded Harry in a panic, throwing the covers back and catching sight of his leg for the first time. It had been recently bandaged, but fresh blood was already seeping through and the surrounding skin was a greenish grey. Harry tried to stand, but the pain from the leg shot up his side as Hermione guided him back down onto the pillows.
“Granger’s right. If You-Know-Who is back, this is more than just some dark magic we can brush off. We’re talking about one of the most powerful wizards in the world here,” said Cedric.
But even if he could bring them back to the mission, could he ever really repair the fissures in the group?
on McGonagall’s outspoken objections to the most recent decision not to look into the changing migratory patterns of giants.
would run the headlines of the Potters’ tragic end. It would be sensational news for a while, though soon the wizarding world would come to forget. But she would not. After all, he was not merely the boy who disappeared, but the boy who lived.
Pansy glanced out over the foyer, absently checking the pins in her updo and attempting to stifle a smile as her cheeks flushed. “Whatever do you mean?” she asked playfully.
Hermione pulled her robe off to reveal blue jeans and a cream coloured cable-knit jumper.
“No more than usual,” said Hermione, shoving her timetables into her bag. “I’m allowed to see my Head of House after all.”
“You’ve just got all the right problems for my solutions, I expect,” said Draco. This was just a facade, he told himself, something to keep Potter believing. But whatever it was, it was making his heart race.
“Yeah, for the most part charms don’t seem to mix, but sometimes when the properties line up you get a decent combination. I think this one has to do with the current of hot air,” said Harry, watching the ball hover for a few more seconds and then crumble to a fine papery dust. “I’ve melted a few spoons but I haven’t had anything backfire yet.”
“I want to see it all, but not tonight. We have time. I can’t pretend to understand why you did it, but I want to see what you’ve seen,” said Harry, his expression softening. “You’re more than the worst thing you’ve ever done.”
“I’m serious, Draco, I’m not sure how much longer we can stretch things. I know we all love it being together, but being cut off from the wizarding world is taking its toll. If we don’t figure out what to do next about you-know-what, I’m worried we might not be able to last out the winter.”
“I can shrink the trunk so we can take it,” said Hermione, rising quickly. “If you can get a Pensieve, we can probably take that too. Didn’t you say Snape had one?”
He was too awestruck to say anything, but Draco of this memory warmed at the sound of his mothers voice as he stared curiously at the small creature.
“A mansion can be just as much of a prison,” said Draco, before he could catch himself. What the hell was he thinking? He wasn’t really trying to bare his soul to Harry, he reminded himself forcefully.
His mind darted through the curriculum of spectres, beasts, and beings he taught his students about, trying to decide how to position his defence, when his wand extinguished completely.
As Luna stood, a billowing patchwork skirt unfurled around her legs, matched with a pink top and a green crocheted cardigan. “Muggle clothes,” she said, as though it were completely obvious. “To help Harry feel at home.”
At that moment there was a knock on the door, and a dark-haired witch poked her head in.
Draco planted his feet outside her door and knocked with a shaky hand. There was no response. He tried the handle, but the classroom was locked. He found himself laughing at his own lunacy. Perhaps even at a brush with death.
“Nothing. Just something I heard once,” said Draco, remembering the bard’s words. “Let me tell you about the plan.”
“It is not for you to question who wants the wand or what he will do with it. Only know that I have been given carte blanche permission to retrieve it,” said Umbridge in a much softer, staccato voice as she narrowed her eyes.
“Come off it,” said Hermione, brushing his hands away. “Harry nearly died, McGonagall is missing, and the rest of the world is acting like they’ve never heard the name Voldemort before. We need to know.”
The little snake flicked her tongue out at him a few more times before dangling herself down from the windowsill onto the seat and then onto the floor.
“It’s true,” said Cedric. “The Ministry is growing divided. They’ve been suppressing information about these investigations for so long, they may already be turned. It could be any day that we start seeing unrest in the general wizarding public.”
The weather was unseasonably cold for the first game of the season. Frozen rain pelted Draco in the back as he sat rigid on his broom high above the Quidditch pitch, watching streaks of green and yellow below. Right now, looking for the Snitch seemed to be the least of his worries.
“At what?” Draco asked, surprised.
“How convenient for you,” said Draco coldly.
“Er, hi,” said Harry. This was certainly not someone he had met before.
He walked over to Draco and came to rest his elbows on the railing next to him. This close, Draco could see the lights of the city reflected in his round lenses. His face was flushed, and he swayed slightly, undoubtedly drunker than Draco himself at this point.
“To reunions with old friends,” he said. The snake on his lap flicked her tongue. “I can’t tell you what a pleasure it’s been to see you, Draco.”
“You’re mental,” said Cedric, heading to the basin as usual and summoning it to a nearby table. “The Cannons have had their best season in years. And they pulled off that win against the Magpies in the middle of a hailstorm, remember?”
“I don’t mind either,” said Harry. “Besides, I’ve only got about a week left. The more time practising the better, I say.”
Hot tears rolled down his face against his will. “He’s gone, Hermione.”
Harry was unusually closed off in the last week leading up to Christmas break. Draco chalked it up to the mounting pressures on all of them to find Horcruxes following the diadem visions – the world may literally depend on them – but Harry seemed more affected than the rest.
“And you didn’t think that was a valuable piece of information to bring up?” asked Cedric, squaring up in Draco’s direction.
When they weren’t trying to solve the Horcrux dilemma, the other three rotated on running errands into the city to pick up supplies or intel. Harry, unable to leave for security reasons, stayed home, but the others had an unspoken agreement to spend time only on frivolous things when one of them was out of the house. Harry cooked meals with Kreacher, practiced spells with Hermione, or played chess with Cedric. But more often than not, he could be found in one of the rooms at the top of the stairs, listening to records and sharing memories with Draco.
She was right of course. In any other circumstances Draco would be happy to let his time spent with Harry supersede his every other commitment, but he knew Harry wouldn’t see it that way.
“Keep your voice down,” hisses Lucius in clipped tones as he stepped close to her and wrapped a comforting arm around her narrow shoulders. “Think what you’re saying, darling. If it is him, he has chosen us among all his followers. We can quickly return to his good graces.”
“I trust you’ll support my story then, once I am able to reveal it to the Dark Lord, that we’d agreed to wait this out. And it will be me who reveals it in the end – after all, I’m the one teaching him. How does that sound?”
Draco looked between the two of them, bewildered. What was going on today? Had someone spiked the Gryffindors’ pumpkin juice with Essence of Delusions of Grandeur?
“Harry,” she said into his neck. “I was so worried. There were people coming around the house and messages being delivered by birds and they said you were in hospital and might never come back. What happened to you?”
“Professor, why are you here?” he said, as a thought occurred to him. “I told you—I’m listening.” Draco glanced at him, a small crease between his eyebrows joining the one on his cheek.
Draco smirked. If he knew Potter’s level of defensive ability, he’d be able to take him down with ease when the time came. The weakness was always the same with people like Potter; too trusting.
“Then we can do anything we choose,” said Voldemort, flicking his robes around him as he sat.
“I’m insufferable?” hissed Draco as he marched behind him, trying not to speak too loudly as to be overheard by the other two. “You’ve come barging in on my quality time with my fiancée, attempting to upstage me at golf, of all things, and I’m the insufferable one? Should I expect the
“It’s ridiculous right? I mean, how hard can it be to point and shoot with this thing?” Harry threw his hands up in exasperation.
“Just be careful.” Hermione turned to rummage in her seemingly bottomless bag and withdrew a blue book with an embossed eye on the cover, titled
Harry asked, thinking of her curtain of platinum blonde hair.
“All I want is for you to be happy,” said Narcissa, a few teardrops still lingering in her eyes. “Tell me – have you found anyone? Anyone special?”
“Is it true that the location is protected with a derivative of the Fidelius charm, so no one can show up uninvited?” Blaise asked in Draco’s direction.
Luna chattered merrily about winged horses and bad omens as they made their way through the castle and out onto the darkening lawns, passing no one but a few paintings and an empty cottage on the edge of the grounds. Harry was thrilled to feel the rush of cool air hit his face for the first time in weeks, and when he turned to look back at the castle, his breath caught in his chest.
Harry balled his hands into fists. Cedric hadn’t seen out of control.
“Oh, Harry!” she said, her voice muffled into his shoulder. “It’s been awful for you. Being with the Dursleys that long – what was Dumbledore thinking?”
At that moment, the git turned around with a broad smile on his face. Draco froze as he felt a flutter of something that must have been hatred deep in his chest. Harry caught his eye and winked before turning and sloping off towards his ball. Draco was furious to end two strokes behind Harry as their scores on the first hole were tallied.
“I could say the same about you,” said Hermione with a wan smile. “If there’s anything 7 years of magical education has taught me it’s that magic always serves a purpose. Whether our paths never would have crossed in our own times, we were meant to meet for a reason.”
“The only thing we can’t figure out is how to destroy them.”
“I found the Quirrell file,” continued Cedric, scraping back a wooden chair next to Draco as the others gathered around. “It wasn’t easy, the department had it buried deep. But if we weren’t sure before, we can be now. You-Know-Who is definitely back.”
Harry stopped his pacing. “We’ve already been through this. The only way the others will get into the Hall is if we can draw as many Death Eaters away as possible. It’s just our best bet.”
“I thought we were about to move on? I think I’ve got the sparks,” said Harry, bolstered.
“But they didn’t have to die,” said Harry, feeling the words hitching in his throat. Far from the villains Petunia had painted them to be for years, his parents weren’t just good people – If Luna were to be believed, they were heroes.
He trailed off, and Harry could have sworn he was catching a glance at the corner of Harry’s forehead.
Perhaps it was the fact that the castle would be clearing out over the holidays, with Draco and Hermione both going home to spend time with their parents as if everything was normal. Harry might be missing family, as Draco certainly was, but he insisted he was perfectly happy to stay in the castle. On top of which, Luna had agreed to stay behind and Cedric made plans for weekly duelling matches with Harry, so it wasn’t like he’d be completely alone.
“I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,” said Angelica with a smile.
After what seemed like an hour of swishing and flicking, Ollivander replaced a final wand that had nearly seared a hole in his hat gingerly back in the trunk, and swung the lid closed.
“Hermione brought me a book that says differently,” said Harry.
He shook his head and pedalled off after her.
“I say we bide our time. No one else will find out about Potter so your golden goose is safe. And when the time comes, I will support you in whatever way I can to reveal all that is necessary to our Lord. I can only hope that when you are in a position of even greater power, you remember all that I did to support you on your rise.”
“Vision, yes,” said Harry, trying to sit up. The pain in his scar was still blinding. “The mental link is still strong. I was in Wisteria Hall, Voldemort was there with his followers. And he had Charlotte.”
Draco tried his best not to look shocked with the news. Callum Harper the backup Seeker, and Theo Nott, one of his closest comrades, together? “Since when..?”
“I don’t think so. I should probably get back on my own feet and out of your hair,” said Harry, pulling his hand away.
If anything, Harry was relieved that their prior conversation didn’t change the way Hermione acted towards him, but he’d had about enough lectures on Fudge’s incompetence as Minister to last a lifetime.
“It has already been almost a week, sir!” squeaked Shrub. “Shrub is very observant. Noticing after only the second day – the same memories, the same draught. Only longer each time in the Pensieve, which is not recommended, sir.”
“It doesn’t do either of us any good to live in regret.” Draco glanced down at the precious phial in his hand, rolling it gently between his fingers. “So I’m going to set you free.”
McGonagall’s mouth twitched, but she managed a curt nod. “It is a significant loss for all our kind.”
“Slow down, Luna,” said Draco, putting a hand on her shoulder. “You’ve had a fright. The diadem is probably cursed to give you some nightmare that plays on your fears.”
Snape was sputtering, blinking but unseeing. There were empty phials of invigoration draught scattered around the desk and the floor, clearly the house-elf had already tried this. He grabbed two fistfuls of Snape’s robes and shook him into a seating position.
“Lives saved by the mitigation of potential for large-scale battle,” argued Draco. His temper was rising, but Harry could tell his heart wasn’t in it. He was just repeating the words he’d been told all his life.
“It depends. You can only see so much of the future. Sometimes you have to set your own path.”
Draco smiled down at the small creature who flicked her tongue out, and lifted her up to the collar of his robes where she settled in. “Can’t blame her for having good taste,” he said.
“I don’t have you scheduled till this afternoon,” said Hermione, shuffling through a stack of papers on her lap.
Yaxley and Carrow broke into peals of laughter. “It’s that type of nobility that got your father killed, boy.”
“I think he sees it as justice,” said Harry.
Tonks offered for Draco to stay with her while everything was sorted out, but after the calamity they had been through all Draco wanted was a bit of peace and quiet, and distance. From everyone but Harry.
Umbridge’s eyes flashed with rage, and she pointed her wand at McGonagall again. Malfoy tensed at Harry’s side, when a calm, clear voice said.
“Great. What about something useful like a basic counter-curse?” Harry rose to the desk for his copy of
Pansy’s eyes darted to Draco’s.
“That’s looking much improved!” said Hermione’s voice from the door right on cue, as she bustled in looking windswept. Harry smiled thankfully at Luna. “And in other good news, I’ve figured out a piece of the note.”
Harry ran around the pitch, shouting to his teammates now and then. Once or twice he glanced up to the stands and saw Charlotte cheering, her hair showing out underneath a woolly knit hat. Then, suddenly, the ball was Harry’s. An opening emerged between players in the other colour, and he made a break for it. He was fast; he outstripped a defender close by, manoeuvring the ball in a feint but keeping it under control. Draco could feel Harry’s pulse rising, the thrill of excitement and panic as he neared the netted goal.
“He doesn’t really want to do it, he’s just holding the world ransom,” said Hermione. “It’s a power play.”
The two men took a few strides towards them, pulling wands out of their pockets. “Clear as they day they died,” said Carrow, tilting his head and smiling as if at a rabbit in a trap.
“You’re right,” said Draco, refusing to back down. “And I’m not here to pry for my own amusement. But you have to know what it’s like to have someone looking for something you don’t want found, because that’s what will happen if the enemy gets their hands on you, hell even if the Ministry gets their hands on you.”
” Draco recited.
Even in Defence against the Dark Arts (which he and his friends had taken for a laugh), Lockhart had assigned a detailed review of all curses, hexes, and jinxes referenced in the first 12 chapters of
said Harry.
“Just ended,” said Pansy, her expression souring as she caught sight of the other two. “What are you doing with Granger and… who’s that?”
“Luna said we could fight Death Eaters if we came along,” said a boy with a strong Irish accent.
“Who did? Dumbledore?”
“So you took a bet that I’d believe what you’d lay out for me: Remind me about my structured past, make sure I bring up the old deal with your father, and accept the job when the time came.”
“What, Snape is too good to answer his own door these days?” sneered Draco at the elf, whose ears drooped.
“I was aware of the goings on last night, but it remains unclear to me whether this has accelerated our plans,” said Draco trying to catch the dull gaze of Snape at the house table, who was refusing to look in his direction.
“Merely a rumour,” said Dumbledore, waving this away. “But we are the only ones who know the truth, and so we are the only ones who pose a risk to Harry if the secret were to get out.”
said a small voice near the windowsill.
“I see,” said Draco, nodding. “What better position of influence than one where you don’t have to fight to keep your seat at the table. But why not just have the cards say that you’re destined to take over the business?”
And then… Dumbledore. A prophecy, a death, a promise.
“Yeah, but Cedric reckons it has something to do with my bursts of magic, or maybe learning to control it later in life.” Harry tried to put on his best disarming smile as Hermione got to the page of notes on experimental spells and her eyebrows raised straight off her forehead. “Don’t get mad, but we started trying loads of different spells and component pieces to see what I could do best, and then we figured out how to stack them so even really simple spells can be used effectively in battle.”
“Why have you brought me into the Fidelius?” Snape asked in a clipped tone.
Voldemort considered this, before impatiently waving a hand. “Yes, yes, what do you desire?”
“What are you saying?”
“Because we have always been loyal,” said Lucius, taking another bite of quail.
“Just some Prefect nonsense,” said Malfoy easily. “But I reckon Granger can take care of it.”
“Hang on, why does Draco’s father have a piece of Voldemort’s soul?”
“What are you—”
The small man fidgeted nervously at Voldemort’s side, blinking his watery eyes and rubbing his hands together. He leaned down to whisper something in Voldemort’s ear, but the Dark Lord waved the man away with a slow gesture.
“Well, the least we can do is help him, and the good news is it sounds like this can be treated, whatever Patient M had,” said Hermione, turning back to the book with a renewed vigour.
“I was thinking broom shed,” said Draco devilishly.
know the Weasley twins work in a joke shop down in Diagon Alley?”
On the other hand, Harry hadn’t been able to forget diadem Hermione’s words; somewhere in the world he had a godfather. For all Sirius’s sins, Harry still felt a strange desire to know the man, if only for a link to the memory of his parents. His mind darted to the creased photograph of the Order in his pocket.
He sat up in an unfamiliar bed which was low to the ground and felt around for his glasses on an end table. Putting them on, he looked around at the inside of a makeshift tent, larger than any camping tent he’d seen before, with three beds, a living area, and a small dining table. But no one was in sight. The only thing that looked familiar was the holly wand next to the pillow.
“You should see yourself,” said Draco, laying a hand on the side of Harry’s face that wasn’t burned by the power of the sword. “You’re a fright.”
“Where are you? Move the cloak so I can get you out. We need to move fast,” said Draco, straightening his robes.
“It’s the vision charm,” said Hermione. “You don’t need them anymore.”
Unlike the last time, which felt like a high-speed chase through his past, Draco’s presence this time was uninvasive. He seemed to hover, waiting to see what Harry would show him, as if they were both watching a projection on the back of Harry’s eyes.
“Draco, stop!” said Pansy, grabbing him by the arm.
Draco stopped in his tracks.
“I don’t expect you to believe me,” he said at last. “But it’s not who I am anymore.”
Draco felt a strange lurch in the pit of his stomach at the news, and Pansy and Theo looked apprehensive, unsure if this was a sign that heralded in a time they had been preparing for, or if it was a premature display of power.
“Oh Luna,” said Hermione, her forehead creasing in concern.
He hadn’t told her that he nearly thought he saw the Hierophant when Sterling had approached them at the gala, nor had he mentioned his surprise at the accuracy of her reading following Potter’s revelation about leaving the force. He had, in fact, been dwelling more than he’d like to admit on the meaning behind his present and future cards — the inverted five of swords (putting old grudges to rest), and the knight of wands (some new opportunity supposedly awaiting him).
“Ok, I think that’s everything,” said Hermione, shoving the invisibility cloak into her bag and walking towards the fireplace. “It’s nearly noon, so they should be starting lunch at the castle any minute. Are we ready, Ced?”
Luna sidled up to him, hooking an arm through his and looking lovingly at the crowd. “Isn’t it amazing? When Umbridge started taking over the school, everyone banded together. They thought they could control us by taking away our links to the outside world, but it only made us resolved to find out the truth. That’s when they started finding the room. A few at first but the word spread: anyone who wanted to fight the rise of You-Know-Who answered the call.”
“That is assuming that they haven’t deactivated my badge,” said Cedric, accepting a biscuit from Kreacher and indicating a path on the map. “If they’re following protocol, they’ll have Ministry officers at the entrances of the school here and here, but the only Aurors are the four that stay close to Umbridge. We can expect them to be wherever she is, which at lunch time is probably in the Great Hall here.”
Draco paused at this. Trying to remember why Andromeda would mean so much to him in this timeline.
“I had no idea,” said Draco, his mouth like sandpaper. In a matter of moments he’d gone from feeling like he had all the cards in his hands, to questioning whether anything his father had told him of his life before the war was true.
Seemingly in response, a small hand reached out to grasp the closest item on the shelf; a rectangular piece of plastic with faded number buttons, like they’d been pressed a million times. Harry ran his hand across it, feeling the familiar clack of the number keys and Draco realised the hand was quite young. Potter must be showing him a place from his childhood.
“Helga Hufflepuff’s Cup,” said Luna, reading from her notes. “It was said that water drunk from the cup would have the power to restore the drinker to full health.”
Draco smirked. “Careful, Potter. One might think you actually enjoy our company.”
Angelica was awake, propped up on the bed in a fluffy white hotel robe, reading a muggle magazine by the low light of the lamp on the nightstand and eating a piece of cake off of a nearby room service trolly. Her hair fell in loose waves around her shoulders and her eyes snapped up as he entered, quickly softening into a tipsy smile.
“Because I have the wand,” said the portrait of Dumbledore.
It helped that every time he showed up in the room in Harry’s t-shirt, that Harry raked him over with his eyes. What Draco wouldn’t give to dive into his mind in one of those moments and see what he was thinking.
The portrait tilted its head.
Harry opened his eyes in the familiar sitting room, and Voldemort smiled. There were two others in the room, standing over an elegant mahogany table and leafing through a stack of parchment. One was certainly Yaxley, the same man from Harry’s previous vision, but the other was facing away, and Harry could only make out long platinum blond hair falling over black robes.
“Gone, it is,” said Kreacher, fixating on the fake locket in his hand. “Gone. When Mistress cleared the house. She told Kreacher we would not need it, and let Kreacher keep her brooch to protect instead.” At this, he turned over the chest flap of a toga-like wrap he was wearing to reveal an exquisite cameo brooch.
From that point, the team began dressing exclusively in jeans and jumpers and other Muggle attire. Even Draco, though he made his disgust at the colour palette known. Though he no longer wore Harry’s old t-shirt, Harry was happy to see him in Muggle clothes nonetheless.
“Wish I could say the same,” said Harry, suppressing any tremor of fear in his voice despite the fact that he was the most terrified he’d ever been in his life. “But you don’t look anything like the Tom Riddle from Dumbledore’s memories.”
“Muggle-born, yes,” said Hermione, nodding. “At first they thought his bursts of magic were dangerous like an Obscurus. When they didn’t consume him, the healers were quick to write things off as a fluke, but Dr Weaver realised the cause wasn’t magical, it was psychological. M was carrying around a heavy burden that still affected him all those years later.”
“You’re right, I should go find Angelica.” He went to stand up, but Pansy kept her hand firmly on his shoulder and pushed him back down.
“Ooh boy, you’re playing with fire,” laughed Mr DuPont.
“Like building a search engine.”
“So it’s as I suspected. Dumbledore chose you as his protege, did he? Unfortunate he can’t be here to join us tonight for our long fated reunion.”
“A heart!” said Luna, as looking between the cup in her hands and a textbook opened across her knees. “That means romance, or a loving home. Unless…” She turned the cup sideways. “It might be mountains, which means significant challenges lie ahead.”
said the snake plainly. Though what a snake could find beautiful, Harry hardly knew.
on the hovering ring, causing it to drop to the dark cloth with a thunk. “If I were in your shoes, I would be more concerned about why you haven’t been able to give me any of the information I’m looking for than why the ring is in my possession. Unless you doubt the Dark Lord’s direct orders.”
Draco stopped in his tracks and wheeled around to face Harry. “Alright out with it. What do you want?” He could feel the colour rising in his face.
“But Luna is underage,” said Cedric. “Don’t you think this is getting out of hand, Professor?”
The game continued in relative silence, though they were all aware of the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall, until a few hours later Cedric blew in with a strong gust of wind and snow. Not only did he have
by Beedle the Bard.”
“At school, sure. But in the Manor, we were often alone as a family. That’s just the way things are done,” said Draco, pretending the question wasn’t a sting. “Our position in society dictates a certain level of decorum.”
Draco looked distressed.
A look of deep concern pooled in his eyes as he beheld the sleeping child, and the creases of his face seemed to deepen. He turned away from the other two, holding his gaze on the baby and on a peculiar lightning bolt-shaped cut on his forehead. His weathered fingers grazed the cut, brushing a lock of jet black hair to the side.
“Speaking of which, there was one other thing I wanted to show you before the others arrive,” said Hermione, summoning her school bag and pulling out a paperback book. “I was looking everywhere for Dr Weaver’s book on Obscurials when it occurred to me that perhaps her work wasn’t just notable in the magical world – maybe she was an accomplished Muggle doctor as well. I went to Waterstones with my mum, and I found it in the psychological reference section!”
“As soon as possible,” said McGonagall.
“Fuck,” muttered Draco. “Not anymore. Alright, Potter and I will go to the Headmaster’s office and get his. Granger, you go to the dungeons to make a wideye elixir, but on the way I need you to make as big of a diversion as possible somewhere on the first floor. Try and tie up as many Ministry officials as you can, but leave the Divination stairwell free. We’ll meet back here and leave straight away, so Diggory better be back on his feet.”
!” The spoon liquified into a puddle of silvery goo.
” said Voldemort, jamming the tip of his wand under Draco’s chin and directing his gaze back to that of his master. “Bring the girl.”
He put on a brave face, but now that it was coming down to it he realised the window of time he had where only he and Harry knew the truth about everything was closing. Before long he’d have to tell the others and he was certain they’d be less than understanding. And there was one more thing he had left to tell Harry.
The group passed through a tasselled curtain into a private dining area with a large round table. The walls were jam-packed with framed photos of an Italian coastline, postcards of Rome, and a painting of the pope.
“I hate to say it, but we’re not making enough progress.” Cedric folded his arms resignedly. “Maybe it’s time we call for help. We should try contacting the Order of the Phoenix.”
“You do it then, if you’re so clever!”
“I wouldn’t expect anything less,” said Harry.
“It’s a classic Slytherin trait,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I’d be happy to teach you. Once you master Occlumency.”
“Well, I—”
It was a feeling he had tried to push away years ago any time he was chasing Harry on a broom, or calling him out in class, or watching him dive headfirst into some ill advised adventure. There had always been something there between him and Harry, even that first day at Madame Malkin’s, before it was anything he could put a name to.
“I’m sure you’ll figure out something to tell them,” said Harry. “That’s what you’re good at after all.”
“Daddy loves history,” supplied Angelica indulgently.
“Oh. Yeah,” said Harry, pushing the hair off his forehead to reveal the lightning bolt shaped scar.
“What exactly do you propose,” she said at last.
He was wondering whether McGonagall would let him take home a few books on basic curses or if the accident had cost him his chance, when a piece of paper fluttered out of
“I did have a couple of suggestions that might make things move along more quickly.” Hermione rummaged through what sounded like a very large book. “For starters, I was thinking we need a bigger space for Harry to practise to keep him from hurting himself and allow for the right layouts for various spellwork. The room seems to know what we need, but I’m guessing it’s locked in place while we’re in there.”
“How can you tell which of these are any good?” he asked, pulling out George Harrison, All Things Must Pass.
Then again… It hadn’t been altogether unpleasant. More and more he was finding he enjoyed his long sessions with Potter. He’d been refusing to admit the simple fact to himself for so long that he briefly wondered if he had gotten so good at playing the role he’d simply tricked himself. But no, he couldn’t deny there was something he inherently liked about Harry. Which made it all the harder knowing what he had to do next.
charm might work when there was a loud banging on the office door.
“Yes, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, his head rising in the direction of the half giant. “I’ll have to take care of Sirius separately, of course, but the three of us must rewrite history tonight. We must tell the world that Harry Potter did not survive.”
In the meantime, he was running out of time to access the memory of the green flash – he’d need to apply pressure.
“We’ll find another way,” said Draco’s reassuring voice from behind. He laid a strong hand on Harry’s shoulder and guided him back against a bookcase, where Harry pulled the invisibility cloak around them.
Draco sat back on his knees with a sigh, looking up at Harry, who was still hovering over the arm of the couch.
“Yes, I’d be happy to,” said Greenacre, sitting up and shuffling through a few papers on his desk before picking up a stack held together by a clip and tossing it lightly over to Draco’s side of the desk.
“I think this is it,” said Harry.
Harry wasn’t altogether sure he wanted to know. Whatever the reason, he was glad that fate had crossed their paths. He wasn’t sure how he’d be able to do this without Draco.
“I couldn’t care less,” Draco lied convincingly. “Three face-to-face interactions in as many weeks was more than enough to cure me of any lingering questions I had about old scarhead.”
Hagrid blubbered and patted the blanket as lightly as he could. When they had taken a moment, Dumbledore turned and glided down the stone path to the door of the Dursley residence, placing Harry gently on the stoop.
He looked down at the snake in his hands, and suddenly it was in the glass jar. He was back in the cupboard under the stairs. Holding up the jar, he watched Ivy twine around her bits of twig and moss, and then placed her jar gingerly in the corner.
Sure, he was a half decent bloke who probably deserved more than his lot. And sure, Draco was handling his double agent role less adeptly than he would have thought. But was he really going to let a pair of green eyes lure him off track on his ascent to power?
“No, it would be, ‘On the run in luxury, staying at the home of a wizard who was about to risk his neck to get a book for you.’”
“I didn’t know you fancied golf,” said Harry.
“Still working on the summoning. Hermione says it will be dead useful,” said Harry, looking back to the book with puzzlement. “Want to put a record on and help me practice?”
“I mean if you had told me you planned on bringing a date to London it would have saved me having to owl Potter last minute to get him on the guest list,”
Cedric and Hermione would still be out on their run for another hour. There was plenty of time.
“It makes sense that he would have wanted to keep tabs on Harry,” said Cedric, shovelling forkfuls of sausage into his mouth.
He turned back to Draco, head resting heavy on his chest.
Harry became officially registered as a wizard and was only just coming to terms with the celebrity that came with it, now that pictures of “The Boy Who Lived” were plastered on every corner of magical London.
“Luna, can you hear me?” he called, shaking her shoulder and trying a weak reviving charm. But Luna was out cold. “Fuck,” he muttered under his breath, his eyes darting around the room for something that might help.
They decided it was best to test out everyone’s vision and see if they could fill in the blanks; identifying the other Horcruxes, whether a group of rebel fighters existed, and if they were somehow using time magic to fight.
“I wouldn’t, but I just thought you ought to know – It’s Harry,” she said in a frantic whisper.
Harry recapped his strange week to the space where the small reptile lay curled up in hiding, maybe even sleeping for all he knew. He told her about discovering what he was, and that this world existed. All that he had to learn in a matter of a few weeks, and all he had learned and failed to learn so far.
The black shape of the Potions Master sat very still, leaning his forehead into one hand propped up on the desk.
“Or teach seven years of magic in four weeks?” said Draco, flipping the book shut with force. “A task you yourself said was impossible.”
“Actually, I think all three of you should leave,” said Harry. A look of betrayal flashed in Draco’s eye, feeling like a gut punch, but Harry held firm. He simply didn’t know who to believe, but right now, the only thing on his mind was Charlotte.
Harry felt a smile tug at the corners of his mouth at this very Hermione-like form of apology. So Cedric was still hard at work on the case, and Hermione was still looking into Horcruxes. That only left one other.
“You’re right, professor. I won’t make your same mistakes,” said Draco, drawing close. “Even if he hates me, even if Potter never speaks to me again. I will protect him.”
“Oh,” said Luna, tilting her head. “Beedle knows something about the strange things going on in the castle. The Nargles are all out of sorts. He’s going to help me find the cause if I can help him.”
A harassed-looking McGonagall sat behind a mountain of parchment on her desk, looking wearily between Hermione, Draco, Cedric, and Luna.
“Nothing,” said Harry with a harmless shrug. “I’m just keen to see what your childhood was like. I’m picturing young Bruce Wayne, for the record.”
“Finished it,” said Harry, watching Luna pull a funny pair of glasses out of her bag and put them on her face, without breaking her stare at Ivy.
said Harry.
. “Maybe if you were working on something you were passionate about, you’d have better luck.”
“What makes you think I would even consider—”
Harry looked around and quickly cast a
“I know.”
“No,” breathed Harry, feeling the presence of Voldemort like ice water in his mind.
“I guess you’ll just have to trust me,” she said with a wink.
“Tonks,” said Draco. “Does that mean…?”
He turned down the Transfigurations corridor, scowling. If his father were to hear about this, McGonagall would be out of the Headmaster seat faster than she could say
“Or he was hiding a guilty conscience,” said Draco, glaring at the letter over a cup of coffee. “He says it right there, he put Potter in this position deliberately, and by the time he realised his mistake it was too late.”
“Of course,” said Snape in a dull tone. “I live to serve.”
“Yeah, well what did you expect? If I’m getting attacked, I’m going to throw everything I’ve got at them. It won’t be about duelling etiquette or whatever, it’ll be alive or dead, right? That’s what you lot keep telling me.”
“But he talks to snakes!” said Luna, holding up Ivy.
A thick cloud of smoke began to fill the room. Harry set off a few more knock-back jinxes while he could but had to settle for a sustained Shield Charm once he could no longer make out the square shoulders and pointy face. “Maybe you should stick to melting spoons.”
“Atoning for my sins more like,” said Draco, glancing down at his wrist, where the black snake head of the Dark Mark poked out of the sleeve of his jacket.
Was Harry really going to shut him out on the last night they could spend together?
Draco nodded along. Get to the point, you old bat, he thought.
“Yes, hence why we need Potter to escort us,” said Draco, casting his eyes back to the foyer entrance and remembering how annoyed he was that Potter was over an hour late to pick them up. “He’s the secret keeper of sorts for our party.”
Harry felt a rage building in him as Voldemort’s face taunted him from inches away. “I know what you did,” he spat. “You’ll pay for it.”
“Didn’t seem like nothing to me,” said Harry.
Each time they re-emerged, Harry’s eyes darted to the portrait, which was still slumbering quietly.
But if he didn’t take it he could never return to Harry, however briefly. And it was crucial that he return.
The best addition to the house by far was an old beat up VCR that Hermione found at an op shop one day and hooked up to Sirius’s makeshift battery. On a snowy night in late January, Harry and the others sat crowded together on the settee as Hermione projected On her Majesty’s Secret Service on the wall.
“What we’ve seen is all-out war,” said Harry. “And that once it gets to that point it might not be winnable. Our world is a cold war; less visible destruction, but even more damage can be done corroding the Ministry before anyone notices what’s happened.”
“Relax, I’m not here to throw off your timetable, Granger,” said Draco with an easy laugh. “I just had a free morning and thought I’d come by to help. That’s what we’re all here for, right? Making sure Potter learns everything he needs to?”
“You’re very much like her, you know,” called Ollivander as Hermione bustled Harry out of the shop. “Your mother, that is. She had the same determined spirit. I hope it serves you well!”
“Er, sure, I guess. They always take pretty good care of me here,” said Harry.
“She said you smell like grass.”
“Never better,” said Draco with a humourless smile. “Now I’m guaranteed a position in the new world order. A coveted spot on the Dark Lord’s council. Hell, before too long, maybe a position in the Ministry. Then we can go about dismantling this broken society and killing off Mudblood scum – Is that what you want me to say?”
“No… that’s impossible.” Draco squirmed under his teacher’s cold stare. “He would never turn on my parents. They were loyal.”
“In English, Harry!” said Draco, impatiently.
She rolled her eyes, and Draco took the opportunity to sweep Pansy onto his lap where she let out a shriek of laughter as he kissed her neck, causing the heads of the other Slytherin girls to pop up on the far side of the room.
By Friday morning, Harry couldn’t believe it had been a week since his last normal day at Stonewall. Hermione came round early with Malfoy to tell him that McGonagall had arranged for a wandmaker to come to the castle and fit him with a proper wand to help progress his studies, but they would need to bring him down to the Transfiguration classroom in disguise. Harry was desperate to get a break from the small room, but as soon as Hemione was pointing her wand at his face, he had second thoughts.
“What? Wait, I want to know,” said Harry, following him to the middle of the room.
How long, Draco wondered, had Regulus been forced to sleep under that motto after he had stopped believing it?
Draco cleared his throat. Harry watched his throat move with the motion, gaze jumping to his mouth as he began to speak. “I usually wouldn’t intrude, certainly not at this hour…” His eyes darted past Harry, as if intent on peering into his rooms.
“Right,” said Draco, nodding and wrapping his hands in the glossy, dark mane.
“I like this game,” said Angelica with a devilish grin.
True to his word, Draco showed him anything he wanted to see exactly as he remembered it. He saw Draco’s anxiety about the control he had over his group of friends, and the unrelenting pressure to succeed. His feelings of genuine love and admiration for Pansy who was his closest ally, and his guilt at letting her believe they were more than that.
“I’m sorry Luna,” said Harry. “I wish I could say I knew how you feel. I never knew my parents.”
“Then we’re in agreement?” asked Dumbledore. “The best way we can protect Harry’s future is to cast the charm. He will grow up here, protected by Lily’s sacrifice and by our secret. And he will be remembered in our world as a young boy who gave his life on behalf of free witches and wizards everywhere. His existence will be as unknown outside our pact as our world will be to him.”
“Hermione, you don’t have to,” said Harry, taking a few steps forward. He was sure Hermione would be punished for his stupidity, but she pushed past him to the door as Luna held it open and the three of them disappeared.
His heart leapt into his throat, and he returned the kiss – thrilled to see her again, but suddenly shocked to find himself mid-snog. This was Charlotte! They were friends, not… whatever was happening here.
“Insolent girl!” shrieked Voldemort, but Charlotte was still yelling.
No matter. He’d respected her wishes up till now, but if she was going to change the terms of the deal, he’d simply walk.
He fixed her with a knowing look over his half-moon frames and then rested his hands on his legs with a pat, understanding her silence to mean the matter was settled. And maybe, in another world, it might have been. She could even feel the words forming on her lips, ready to agree with his mysterious scheme and trust that he knew what was best for the child. But something in her gut rebelled.
“We don’t have time to argue. Teach me the Fiendfyre spell. I’ll destroy the Horcruxes and head there now.”
“Not really,” said Harry, taking the opportunity to engage with him, even though he was certain he wouldn’t be able to stomach anything until the others were back.
Harry hesitated. It had the ring of being a trick question. Draco was priming him for when this was all over, and their lives would eventually resume as normal.
“Forgive me for asking, but why keep the chemical company running altogether? Surely the products coming out of your alchemy lab are far superior,” said Draco, with genuine interest. Having grown up in a world almost completely divorced from non-magical beings, he’d often wondered what it was about the industrious little muggle populations that kept people like Edgar DuPont and Arthur Weasley interested in them.
“Merlin, no,” said Draco with a stunted laugh. “She hasn’t gardened in years. She used to, though. It’s too messy of a hobby now, I suppose.”
“He’s smart,” said Hermione reluctantly. “But he’s the poster child for Slytherin house, so don’t trust him with your back turned. He’s not usually one to spend his time on something he’s not personally benefiting from.”
Harry felt a sudden jerk at his side and turned to see Malfoy ghastly pale and shaking. Their faces were inches apart as they huddled together under the cloak and Harry could see sweat forming on his brow as McGonagall’s screams continued. He put an arm around Malfoy’s waist, drawing him close and keeping him standing.
“I don’t doubt it, my boy, I don’t doubt it,” said Ollivander. His eyes refocused on the two in front of him, his brow now creased.
“Hello Minerva, you seem to have a problem with your door,” said the woman, her eyes bulging slightly at the attempt at cheerfulness in her voice. “Didn’t you hear me knocking?”
He stopped by the Transfigurations corridor to drop another Extendable Ear at McGonagall’s door. She hadn’t been seen around the school since Halloween, but when she came back, who knew what information she’d have. It wouldn’t hurt to run interception the first chance he got.
“Oh. Well, maybe I could come round to yours?” said Theo, hopefully. “You know Manchester isn’t so far from Wiltshire when you think about it.”
The Christmas in the parlour when his father had bought him his first broom and he flew it into the tree. His mother, reading to him by the enormous fireplace in her sitting room, play acting and being silly – and yet the same woman, calm and austere at a formal dinner in the dining room when the German Minister for Magic visited. And one particularly wild moment of adolescence, where he’d convinced the oldest house-elf on staff to let him into the family wine cellar and his parents found the two of them drunk hours later, but couldn’t stop laughing long enough to be mad.
Draco felt an uncomfortable tightness in his chest. The few memories he’d seen during their last Legilimency session had been… enlightening, to say the least. Potter’s upbringing was certainly not what the wizarding world would have wanted for their child martyr, but he had a certain deep-seated resilience to him.
To Harry’s relief, Charlotte had rebounded ahead of the healer’s schedule and had been granted special permission as Harry’s “family” to be allowed to keep the knowledge of the wizarding world. She would take her deferred A-levels over the summer, and she was encouraging Harry to do the same. They could still wind up in Edinburgh.
Cedric nodded. “Surely a few incendiary devices would be useful in any situation.”
“Relax,” said Angelica, running her hand down his arm and threading their fingers together. “He likes you. I can tell.”
“Harry, I’m really not sure this is such a good idea,” interrupted Hermione, who was biting her thumbnail anxiously.
“I’m listening”
“What are you saying, Harry?” said Hermione. “Taking down a single wizard was one thing, but if he has all the power our visions have led us to believe, this is something altogether different.”
His father? Golf? He couldn’t even picture the two things together.
“Oh!” Luna jumped to her feet so quickly that Harry did too. “I’ve got it!”
Snape let out a long breath and took the draught, before removing the gossamer memory from the still surface of the Pensieve and into a glass phial with an etching of a deer.
Draco could feel himself smiling at the sheer gall as Harry fought off two Death Eaters and a Dementor with first-year level charms. But somehow he wasn’t surprised that Potter’s resourcefulness and blind bravery led him through the duel alive.
He liked Harry’s laugh. It was a warm, genuine thing. He was surprised to discover a smile had spread across his own face – not a manufactured one but a real one. Here he was, sitting in a secret room with a snake on his shoulder, smiling like an idiot at a boy in Muggle clothes who, only a few weeks ago, he had been ready to turn over to the Dark Lord.
“I was only trying to help,” said Hermione, tears spilling down her face as she looked back and forth from Draco to Harry.
“Here let me try, '' said Harry, holding out his hand to accept the offending battery. “Do you still think she’s a nutter then?”
“I could have loved you,” he said at last. “I was just a child.”
Harry stood still for a moment, coat hanging slightly crooked from where he’d been pushed. “Please, just trust me for once,” he said, a note of genuine concern in his voice.
“It’s like a mind Healer, it’s a Muggle science discipline,” said Hermione. “So I thought I’d write to St Mungo’s and see if they can track down a copy for me. That is, if you’re happy for me to look into it further, Harry.”
It matched the description of the ring that Phineas Nigellus had reported perfectly.
“At least tell me whether it’s tipped your decision one way or another on this alliance with the DuPonts?”
was the secret power the Dark Lord knew not?
“I was stupid and obsessed with power,” said Draco, trying to keep emotion at bay but hearing it rise in his voice all the same, his face growing hot with shame and remorse. “I thought it was a rite of passage, and I was too self-obsessed to see how depraved I had become. I wish like anything I could take it back – I…”
As they tee’d off on the first hole, Angelica’s prowess for the sport was immediately apparent. She carefully lined up her shot, and then with a graceful move that looked about as fluid as a well-cast wingardium leviosa, she swung the club through the air and made contact with a satisfying crack. She followed the arc of the ball with a look of murderous determination on her face and it sailed through the air, bang on target towards the distant flag. As it bounced on the fairway, she twirled around to face the boys with a girlish shrug and practically skipped towards them to allow her father to the tee box.
“Why?” said Draco under his breath.
Harry smiled, but released a puff of air impatiently. “Yeah, but they don’t know anything about it. They might think I’ve been run over by a car or something.”
Snape said nothing.
“Prisoners?” The thought of Harry’s Muggle girlfriend flashed to mind. As unlikely as it seemed, If Draco could come back to Hogwarts with news of her, Harry would be elated.
That had been several hours ago now, and the street had long since gone quiet; lights winking out one by one in the cookie-cutter homes that lined Privet Drive at even intervals. She was fighting exhaustion and beginning to question the school gamekeeper Hagrid’s tip, when a pale, bearded figure in purple robes appeared at the end of the drive.
“It’s valuable then,” said Draco.
“Same,” said Hermione.
“He always was a strange one,” said Draco, pretending to look back at the board for his next move, but struggling with an uncalled for wave of guilt. “Sometimes people keep secrets for good reasons.”
screamed Umbridge.
“The prophecy is real?” asked Draco in disbelief. “You said he went after the Potters to make an example. Because they were Muggle sympathisers and rebels.”
“Impossible,” said Voldemort, the tendons in his jaw tightening. “You know nothing. The extent of my powers is more vast than anything a mere child could comprehend.”
He screwed his eyes shut and concentrated. The face of Andromeda came into view. Giving him his first broom over Christmas, taking him shopping for school books, putting him on the Hogwarts Express for the first time. There wasn’t a single memory of his parents or the Manor or the life he knew.
“Really? Sounds like the words of someone who’s never had a chance to see what it’s like down at the broom shed,” said Malfoy in a taunting voice. “Don’t tell me you’re still chasing old what’s-his-name the sorry backup Keeper?”
The pot jumped back into its original form.
Hermione tapped her quill against her mouth, as if deciding whether she wanted to tell him or not, and then pushed the book in his direction.
“Granger was right. About my family, that is,” he started, glancing at Harry. “I should have told you all sooner, but the Malfoys and the Blacks have had dark ties in the past. My Aunt Bellatrix and her husband were convicted Death Eaters. When Granger tried to out me I wasn’t ready to face it but the way the world is going, I don’t think I can sanction what they’ve done any longer.”
And Harry, though he had attempted to pay no interest in him, he knew Harry was sitting a few tables over with a group of professional quidditch players chatting and laughing and looking completely at ease, if a little flushed in the face from so many drinks. And if he wasn’t mistaken, there was something other than alcohol getting passed around at a few tables in a small green glass vial.
Draco scoffed. “That could have been a fluke. We have no way of knowing what this thing is capable of.”
The group clinked their champagne glasses together, as the music from the band changed over and a few tables around them cheered as the new song started.
A wisp of smoke began billowing from his wand until the entire half of the room was concealed in a white mist.
“I guess we’re about to find out what he plans for me after all,” said Draco, trying not to betray the fear that was coursing through him at the thought.
“So it’s official,” said Theo, huddled over a copy of the
said Harry, withdrawing his hand and propping open the top of her terrarium so she could go wandering.
“How unlike the
“We can still save her,” said Draco, reaching out to venture a comforting hand, but Harry stepped abruptly out of reach.
“Remember the long ‘O’,” she said.
And yet, the one thing he wanted to do with his remaining time was spend it with Harry.
“Why am I still here?” Snape asked, picking at a silver thread on his robes.
“I thought it’d be an easy one.” Luna shrugged.
“I couldn’t imagine a better match,” he said, accepting her hand.
“There won’t be any repotting if I can’t fix this blasted pot,” muttered Harry, as his attempted repair crumbled. “Not to mention Hermione is going to have my head if I can’t figure this out.”
“McGonagall made me invisible last time I walked through the castle,” said Harry, leaning away.
And for some reason it gave him great satisfaction to imagine him quite small and withered. Perhaps too caught up in “video games” and hiding out from the Dark Lord to take in the fresh air and sunshine. Draco smirked to himself at the thought.
Unable to stay alone in the empty home under the watchful eyes of the black family portraits, he left through the front door as well. He made the first right down a residential tree-lined street and let his feet carry him from there.
Harry’s wand made another strange noise, and a wind rushed through the room, rustling papers and unsettling swirling dust clouds off the old boxes. Hermione let out a little gasp, a hand flying to her mouth, and Ollivander’s eyes widened as Harry continued, “So as it stands, sir, we are already involved in his affairs. And if we don’t bloody well stop him, who will?”
The portrait Dumbledore looked confused for a moment and gazed out his painted window. “I am not certain.”
Harry didn’t even have a moment to reply before there was a crack and Draco Disapparated from the house.
“Oh but you are,” said Pansy, rising to cross the room.
“I can’t wait for you to see Hogsmeade,” said Luna, who wore a woolly hat so large the ear flaps wobbled as she walked. “It’s a shame you won’t get to see Honeydukes. They have the best Dirigible Plum milkshakes I’ve ever had in my life.”
“Right, you only know how to act when it benefits you.” Hermione pushed past him. “Fine by me. I hardly want to speak to you, anyway. And I better not break character or Pansy will wonder why you’re spending so much time with me and not getting any better at Arithmancy.”
At the third, a boy with messy black hair sat alone, his arms crossed on the table.
“It must be costing you a fortune. Is there some sort of discount for national heroes?” asked Pansy drily.
journalists in the know, then subsequently left the force, shed his lifelong friends, and turned into a party animal in the course of the last few weeks?
“Keep talking like that and it’ll go straight to his head,” said Draco, shrugging Hermione off and moving to stand. “It’s fine, really. I’m sure Granger will have me patched up in no time and we can go round two. And believe me Potter, I don’t make the same mistake twice.”
“No?” said Draco, frankly stumped why she wouldn’t be keen on any of his three top players. “There’s always Greengrass, if that’s your thing? Pansy could put in a good word, they’ve been close for years.”
“Alright, now we better see what kind of trouble Harry’s got himself into this time,” she said, crossing to the couches and Transfiguring her school robes into a Muggle outfit of a jumper and jeans. A habit that had now become the norm for most of the group, Draco realised.
“Regrets,” he said plainly, closing the basin away in a wardrobe. “Wondering how things could have gone another way. I wouldn’t expect you to understand.”
“It sure hasn’t felt fast,” said Harry.
“So you’ll be staying on?” asked Harry, looking between the serene smile of Luna and the sceptical frown of Hermione and wondering how he was supposed to feel about this news.
“Maybe if you had listened to us and stayed put, the girl wouldn’t have been dragged into this mess in the first place.” Cedric loomed over Harry’s bedside, standing his ground.
Hermione cast a quick counter spell on them, but nothing seemed to happen.
“It’s settled then,” said Harry. “Tomorrow we take the final Horcruxes, and then redroup on a plan to defeat the Dark Lord himself.”
“But you should still prepare your defensive spells just in case,” said Harry. “Ced, you should teach Hermione the one you used at the train station.”
“Came as soon as I could,” he said, breathlessly. “Alright, Potter?”
Harry yanked open the door and took a few steps through the stone archway, when a clear film like cling wrap materialised around him and kept him from passing through.
Hermione’s eyes narrowed, but she turned to Harry with a smile. “Anyway, Harry, McGonagall was really pleased to hear about your progress, so think of Luna as an extra pair of hands. Anything that you practise with me, you can practise again with her.”
The days were flicking by faster, the chess pieces looking larger in Harry’s hands, until they came to an abrupt stop. They were in the same park, though the table was nowhere to be seen. A few decorative trees in the present day memories were merely saplings wrapped in a protective plastic coating. Harry was running, his heart pounding. His eyes darted around the park, spotting a wooden bench that backed up to a row of scrubby bushes, which he dived into headlong.
Kreacher did not reply, but he fidgeted from foot to foot, fingering the brooch and the locket.
“Snape, no!” yelled Draco, dragging him back to the chair. “Shrub, get Madam Pomfrey, tell her it’s an emergency.”
“What the bloody hell—oh.” Well shit.
“I’m not sure why anything surprises me about this place anymore,” said Harry as an amused smile crept across his lips. “I would love to meet an actual ghost.”
And they weren’t the only ones looking at it. The Great Hall had an unusually cold hush to it, as students of all houses whispered furtively about the news. Letters from worried parents streamed in with the morning post, and even the staff table was full of tight-lipped faces and nervous glances.
“Malfoy brought it to me,” said Harry with a shrug. “He said it’d be worth reading up ahead of my defence lesson.”
Then again, he’d ignored some of the strange signs Draco had given off when the group was discussing Death Eaters; maybe there was more about his past than he’d been willing to share.
Draco was not so sure. Potter was not known for his sense of caution. He could feel a knot forming in his stomach, which tightened when the glass doors of the hotel opened and a flustered-looking Harry walked through them, followed closely behind by an attractive woman with long brown hair and a lime green dress.
“What?” said Harry, jumping up after him and pulling him around by the shoulder. “Tell me.”
Harry balled up his fists as a buzzing started in his ears. He was sick to death of being treated like a child. “How can I trust you when you won’t even tell me why you’re keeping me here? Just say his name – tell me about Voldemort!”
“He’s elated with the news. Our Lord claims to have seen the
Harry’s chest was heaving with rage. He could barely even feel his real body back in Sirius’s room, where Draco was trying to help him from the attack.
“Unbelievable,” said Draco, throwing his hands up. “You’re literally a hero in our world, and you’d rather leave all that behind and become what, some computer wizard?”
“Let’s hear it then, what’s Malfoy’s type?” asked Harry as Hermione drew her wand down his nose, lengthening it with a slight pulling sensation.
Theo put his fork down with a clatter. “Is this it? Are we being called up?”
She fixed him with an incredulous look and laughed. “Merlin, you’re being so serious today! It’ll be fine. He knows what happens when two people love each other. Besides, you have asked to marry me, haven’t you?”
. Harry had to admit, she’d changed in the few short months that he’d known her.
“I’m game,” said Harry. “When do we start?”
The group sat for a moment in the wake of Harry’s words, but Draco flinched at the name. There was something he wasn’t telling the group, that much was sure, but Harry knew Draco wouldn’t do well with being called out. He had the same uneasy look about him as he did after they looked through Harry’s memories of his scar pain. Maybe he knew to be true what Harry had suspected for weeks, and was bearing the secret for Harry’s protection.
“Hell of a match,” said Draco, knowing full well it would set his father off.
“I see. Is that what you two are listening to all the time up there?”
“Go on then,” he said, cutting the deck and returning it to her.
“Why does that sound strangely like a prediction Luna would give?” asked Harry.
“Nothing, forget about it,” said Draco, his eyes dead ahead.
Hermione smiled back sympathetically.
Shouting erupted from the hall and Lily’s head whipped around to the door, placing Harry quickly back in his cot and stroking his cheek with a trembling hand before turning her back on him in a defensive stance.
If anything, the scene Draco was watching play out in his mind was a bloodbath. Potter would be obliterated if he took on the Dark Lord directly. He was still weak of course, still recovering from years of attempted regeneration, but that didn’t stop him from being powerful. Draco had seen evidence of his fury firsthand.
It wasn’t surprising then that he found himself standing outside of the Position Master’s office. He was reluctant to enter, but knew he would be just as miserable anywhere else. At least he could talk to Snape about Harry.
Harry’s heart stopped beating in his chest as his eyes fell on the serene, pale face of Draco. His body lay in a fallen heap, still in the Muggle clothes he left Grimmauld Place in not merely a few hours ago. His head was tilted back at a strange angle, his slender neck covered in fang marks that bled down the front of his jumper. Harry took a reflexive step towards the body but stopped himself just in time.
Draco turned to look at him. In the glow from the window, the thin frames of his glasses cast pale shadows across his nose. His dark hair fell across his brows, revealing a lightning bolt shaped scar. If Harry knew what he had done, would he ever get to look at him this way again?
Hermione, Luna, and Cedric hung back away from the practice area as Harry and Draco squared off.
“There now, that’s better,” he said. “It’s a courtesy for gentlemen to look each other in the eye.”
“I can assure you that my mother and I have distanced ourselves from such a legacy. Angelica would have no ties to—”
“Dumbledore’s instructions—”
“Fine,” said Harry, making his way to his feet and drawing her up alongside him by the hand. He winced at the pain in his head, but didn’t want Luna to think there was anything wrong. “In fact, I think I finally know what I need to do here.”
“It doesn’t hurt to try,” said Luna, waiting till Harry was out of the room before closing the door with a crisp click and turning on her heel to walk down the corridor.
“I’m sorry Harry, but it is,” said Voldemort, taking a step closer. So close Harry could smell the acrid scent coming from his robes, like spoiled milk. “But allow me to enlighten you further. There is a way out from under his grasp, and I have achieved it. Only I have gone farther than any other wizard has dared to go.”
Harry discovered that an unnamed dark wizard and pure-blood zealot had attempted to assume control of the wizarding world by amassing a collection of followers and honing illegal dark magic. However, he died when he attempted to perform a Killing Curse on a young magical family that defied him.
“Stand still!” Luna had uncoiled Ivy from her curls and was standing on tiptoe to place her around Draco’s collar. “There! She really brings out the green in your badge.”
“I too conveyed a secret that I thought would please the Dark Lord. To bolster his ascent to power, and raise me up in his esteem. It was only later I realised that it spelled the end for the one person I was desperate to protect.” Snape was practically shaking with the effort of conveying this message. Draco gulped at a lump in his throat, wondering what Snape could have done, and trying to suppress the image of Harry that was quickly rising to the surface of his mind. “Learn from my sins, Draco. Or suffer the same fate.”
Instead, he passed through a blue velvet sitting room and the music room with the grand piano, his feet pattering on the floor as he turned into a light-filled greenhouse. The conservatory was one of his favourite rooms in the Manor, with its warm flagstone floor and greenery from about eye-level to the top of the domed glass ceiling.
“It’s for a Thestral who’s in love with a unicorn – could have sworn I mentioned it the other day. The Thestral fell in love at first sight, but the unicorn doesn’t know he exists because he’s never witnessed death.”
“Drop the formalities, Severus. We don’t have the time.”
Draco hit the trick step once more with a powerful Un-Sticking Charm and Harry yanked his foot free. They dashed the last few flights to the second floor corridor and ran towards the familiar gargoyle.
“It’s too late for me, Pans,” he said, straining to retain his composure, the Mark burning like acid on his arm. “Go. Please.”
Draco followed his gaze where it landed on Hermione in the armchair facing the fire, eating a snowflake biscuit. He pushed back suddenly, pacing back across the room and shoving his hair back with both hands.
“That’s just it,” said Harry, settling back into the sofa and looking at Draco with relief. “I know exactly what I need to be learning, I can see it in all the books Hermione’s brought me, but they’ve got me focused on levitating feathers and shooting off red sparks.”
“Do you think the diadem shows the way things are supposed to be?” asked Harry, feeling a strange mourning that he couldn’t have lived this life, one where he had gone to Hogwarts and had Ron and Hermione, a godfather, Dumbledore.
“What’s that, Granger?” asked Malfoy, tossing the book onto the table.
Seeing no one else in the tent, he put on some unfamiliar Muggle clothes from a trunk at the foot of his bed and pulled on a jacket before heading out of the front flaps into a small wooded clearing. As far as the eye could see were dark tree trunks glittering with frost in the biting cold. And then, on a small bench nearby, a familiar head of brown curls was bent over a book titled
“Yeah, I think so, Luna,” said Harry. “But who knows, maybe we can stay in touch. I might be in Scotland next year, anyway.”
The news that Luna Lovegood had walked straight into the Room of Requirement and introduced herself had thrown the entire group into a tizzy. Draco would have chalked Luna’s appearance up to another one of her weird quirks, except for the fact that she had somehow unknowingly broken through a Fidelius he’d spent weeks trying to crack.
“There’s no need.”
“Not even if I had to,” said Harry with a laugh. Draco cracked a grin and Harry was pleased to have done something to earn it.
Draco narrowed his eyes at her, attempting to discern whether she was blackmailing him on his eavesdropping or just oblivious, but she merely blinked in response.
Voldemort looked momentarily stunned, stumbling back a step as a flurry of Hogwarts robes came diving through the window. Pansy could be seen with two rows of students flanking her, shouting commands as they shot off nonverbal stunners in quick succession. A handful of students on brooms including Cedric, Theo, Ron, and his sister were diving and swooping, dropping what looked like fire crackers on clusters of silver-masked Death Eaters.
“Stop.”
“Felt like you were about to level that dark hallway, for one thing,” said Harry.
“Alright. Tell me what you think you know,” he said in his most honest voice. “And I’ll tell you everything I can.”
Slipping into the vision of the diadem, Draco braced himself for a reality in which he was back at the Manor with the brethren, or perhaps in Wisteria Hall where the Dark Lord’s forces were gathering. He was surprised then to find himself in a brightly lit cottage with the midafternoon sun streaking through a nearby window and falling on a cosy, trinket-filled sitting room.
But the worst by far was having to see the crime scene photos. Draco shivered in spite of himself as he took the stone steps two at a time.
He pedalled hard down the straight stretch towards the park until his lungs burned. Then he just sat back and let the wheels spin, feeling the air whipping past his face. The bent spoke twanging rhythmically. Somewhere, the presence of Malfoy seemed to recognise the feeling.
“You can tell me anything, Draco,” said Pansy, reaching out to run a comforting hand across his shoulder.
thought Harry. “Alright Malfoy, I’ll hit you with a knock-back and then you disarm me.”
For all they had been through over the last few months, Luna was the least changed of the group. Harry still received blue ink letters regularly, updating on progress of the mimbletonia research, or sharing doodles of Ivy, or horoscope clippings from the
As he said it, a renewed cry of energy emerged from the room behind him as a group of wizards came zooming through the open windows. At the head of the pack was a young witch with bright fuschia hair, shouting orders as a new stream of spells were launched into the crowd of black robes.
Harry blinked back, dumbstruck. Dead? He couldn’t be. He’d just seen Cedric the other day.
“Gemma seems a bit of an odd match for Harry, don’t you think?” asked Angelica.
Great, Muggle sports, thought Draco, as he relaxed into the memory. He watched it lazily for a few minutes, seeing the clarity on the edge of the field and the faces of the crowd improving. The holly wand was definitely honing Harry’s natural abilities, which would help when they could finally access the green flash memory. He could also sense a familiar feeling of joy, mixed with anticipation, excitement. A feeling that he knew well.
“Yeah, well, I’d appreciate it if you stayed sane long enough to help me with the Potter situation,” said Draco, leaning over the desk, his eyes fiery. “What are you not telling me?”
Draco shook his head dismissively. “Not much. My question is—”
He scooted in closer and lowered his voice. “Look, I hate to point the blame, and I’ll take my fair share of it, but Diggory’s part of the Ministry. I guarantee you his ward was registered somewhere, and if the Ministry is crawling with wizards loyal to the Dark Lord, then it’s no wonder that they would have been tracking his every move. All it would take is tripping the ward and they’d make the jump to the train station to apprehend you.”
“I haven’t heard any different,” said Draco, keeping his eyes on the paper, where they fell on the weekend’s Quidditch scores. Potter would love this; the underdog Kestrels trampled the Cannons at home in Devon. Diggory would be having kittens.
“I wouldn’t be caught dead in that,” said Draco, as he and Harry watched Luna spin around the room before Transfiguring her clothes back into her black Ravenclaw robes. “You actually wear things like this?”
“Give it a rest, Ganger,” said Draco, coming to join her by the window. “Watching won’t make him come back any faster.”
He pulled open the door to the living room and felt an unnerving chill in the air, as though he had just walked out onto the autumnal grounds. Wand raised in a silent Lumos, he scanned the room for any sign of the cause.
As he opened the door of the Room of Requirement, he was greeted with a wall of dense white fog.
Draco suppressed a relieved laugh – she had no clue. He stepped closer, towering over her. “And how is that different from treating him as your little career stepping stone, hm? Doing a little project on the side for McGonagall in hopes that she scratches your back when it’s all done with?” asked Draco. Hermione’s smile faltered. “Don’t pretend he isn’t a means to an end for you just the same.”
“You can’t seriously be considering this,” said Draco.
Hermione considered this for a moment, tapping her lip thoughtfully. “Alright, I’ll let McGonagall know you’re keeping the wand. But you’re only to practise the spells we’ve already learned together, alright?”
“It’s about a Thestral who falls in love with a unicorn,” continued Luna. “The sonnet. I think that’s quite tragic, really. And beautiful in a way.”
“What magic is this?” he asked, his voice dripping with malice.
Draco was baffled. He scanned his Professor’s face for any sign of deception but Snape was being completely honest, if not entertained, by this revelation.
“The brethren will not act out of turn,” advised Blaise. “They will not harm you unless the Dark Lord commands it.”
“Did, er… did I do something wrong, Professor Dumbledore, sir?” Hagrid asked, his voice choking up.
“Thanks so much for the kind gesture of digging up dirt on the family of the woman I’m about to marry. That’s incredibly helpful to me. Well, I’ve learned my lesson of ever thinking I could confide in an Auror,” said Draco, gripping the raining to steady himself.
Harry could feel the blood running down his leg. He screwed his eyes shut, realising how close he was to being out of options. This is where he would die, he thought.
“I begged him to spare her,” Snape choked out. “I would have given anything, my life even for hers.”
“Please,” said Harry. He pulled Hufflepuff’s cup from his pocket – the last gambit he’d been willing to make – and filled it with an
Hermione scowled. “This is the problem,” she said, turning him to look at his own reflection in the dark front window of the bookstore.
Draco turned to the painting of the bard who was now sitting on his tree stump, tuning his lute. “Thanks for the advice,” he said, and headed towards the Potions Dungeon.
“Fuck,” muttered Draco under his breath as he dashed to the apothecary cabinet on the far wall.
“Not everyone fights fair,” said Draco with a shrug.
“Sure, I guess. Is everything alright?” he locked eyes with Draco and felt an immediate push on his consciousness. Draco was trying to show him something. He could see flickers of a recent memory somewhere in the Manor.
“Al,” said Harry. It was the first time the portrait had addressed him, much less spoken at all and he hardly knew how to respond.
Unfortunately for Draco, the wind picked up his drive on the following hole and Harry made it in a bogey, putting them back in the lead. He could hear Angelica laughing with him as they headed down the course, and something that sounded distinctly like the word ‘ferret’.
“They’re almost impossible to destroy,” said Hermione, picking up pace again. “We’ve pretty much been going on trial and error, but we’re sure they have to be damaged beyond magical repair. Basilisk venom definitely works, and we have a suspicion the sword of Gryffindor would work as well, but only because it’s been imbued with Basilisk venom. Shoot, you haven’t found the Chamber of Secrets have you? It’s under Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom but you have to speak Parseltongue to enter.”
“Yes, I’ve been entranced,” said Draco through his teeth. He could have sworn she was just talking about Potter. “It’s just the music is so loud—here, come closer and tell me again?” He smiled, and she dropped her arms and sidled over.
“He’ll have to use a spare for the time being, and only under supervision. It’s not ideal, but until we can figure out how to get him matched to a new wand, we don’t have another choice. And I’m loath to bring anyone else into the protection of the charm, lest we weaken it.”
There was a moment of pause in the group when Harry briefly wondered if the tentative pact that had brought this group together would hold. After all, they only signed up to teach him a few weeks of magic, and now here they were on the eve of a mission that may very well be impossible.
“What do you mean?”
Malfoy whispered something in Pansy’s ear which had her in peals of laughter as Harry and Hermione turned the corner in relief. They walked on in silence for a little while before Harry ventured. “That was a close one. Lucky Malfoy knew her.”
Hermione looked surprised at this display of affection but returned the hug warmly and, taking a look at Harry, summoned a scarf from inside to wrap around his neck.
“Have you ever seen a Thestral?” interrupted Draco.
Harry suppressed a groan and buried his face in his arms.
Draco’s face dropped. It couldn’t be.
“That scar,” said Draco, his fingers trailing over it. “Do you think it’s the mark?”
Draco grabbed Harry’s arm, running the last few steps to the office door and catching it before it fully closed. Harry was sure their feet must have been visible, but Umbridge and the last Auror didn’t seem to notice.
“I can’t imagine they’d be able to keep that from him even if they wanted to. Remember, Lily was an exceptionally powerful witch at a young age. But when the time comes, Harry will get his invitation to a magical education just like everyone else. It is their choice as his guardians what they want to disclose to him and when.”
“That’s right. There are a number of spells on this relic. I am looking to assess the nature of the innate magical properties as well as the curse protecting it,” said Draco, trying to sound nonchalant. Borgin had meanwhile turned the dials on his strange glasses again and was peering at the black fabric with one telescoping lens. He paused to glance back at Draco. “And its value, of course.”
to go careening off mark. “Those robes are looking pretty silly right about now. Maybe you’d be faster in a pair of trainers.”
“Ravenclaw, like the house?” asked Harry, scanning back down the long curl of parchment.
“But I am of age,” said Draco sharply before he could stop himself. He was sick and tired of people making decisions on his behalf, though at McGonagall’s raised eyebrows he quickly remembered his aims and collected his features in a calm smile. “I mean to say, I am capable of entering the Fidelius of my own accord. But I thank you, Professor Snape, for looking out for me in these matters.” He shot a look at Snape, but Snape’s face was drawn tight and he did not respond.
“Well, it’s exactly like Diggory said, isn’t it? He put a protective ward up around your house. If we’d known that there’s no way I would have let you go back there.”
She turned around, blowing on her burned finger and frowning. Her age, her features, the disregard for cleanliness – Draco had a feeling this woman was a family member he hadn’t laid eyes on in over a decade.
“Because he will be most displeased,” interrupted Draco, using his height to leer over the workbench. “If I were to tell him of your deficiency in this matter.”
“Yes, but you forget I know Potter better than any of you. I’ve been inside his head,” said Draco, taking a sip of Butterbeer. “And I’m sorry to say there’s nothing in there.”
True to form, Malfoy did not press the matter of the memory of Al any further over the following days. And with Luna and Hermione doubling down on lessons, Harry found himself easily distracted from thoughts of his past. He was determined to get whatever he could out of his time at Hogwarts, and get back to his real life as soon as possible, and if that meant never finding out the truth about his parents, so be it. His priority was protecting the pieces of his family that were still alive.
“Let me tell you what Dumbledore sees in promising young wizards, Harry,” said Voldemort, his voice turning harsh, his bony hands wrapping around the edges of the armchair. “He sees talent for the purpose of moulding in his own image. A pliable magic, capable of becoming everything he wished himself to be. Only you can never live up to that image – not even Dumbledore himself could. And when you fail, you are nothing to him. You are cast aside like so many who were unable to reach the bar before you.”
Draco backed out of the memory abruptly, unsure how long he’d be able to stomach the image of a man he knew to be dead, likely at the hands of the Dark Lord himself.
“Incredible,” said Draco finally, repressing his sheer glee at being the first in his circle to bear witness to this news. Surely there was some way he could leverage this to be brought into the inner circle of Death Eaters and perhaps finally earn his Mark.
As he turned into the vaulted library room, Draco felt like he was reliving one of his childhood nightmares. They often began like this; he’d be called to the library, the heavy velvet curtains drawn closed, and the fireplace enchanted with a blue flame that made it look like they were under water. The Dark Lord would ask him to perform spells or instruct him in a Dark Art. If he was lucky, it was curses. Unlucky, and it would be Legilimency.
The Hufflepuff boy straightened his robes and said. “Well, it’s for the experience, isn’t it? If the Dark Lord really is returning to power, I want my hand in fighting him.”
Narcissa nodded as though she understood and rested one delicate gloved hand on Lucius’s. They shared a knowing glance and turned back to Draco with an expression of warmth. For his part, Draco found the whole thing disturbing.
“No, no, I’ll just hold us up — although, please, there’s no rush,” said Harry, trying to placate both sides of the group.
“I wasn’t,” said Luna, pressing her hands to her mouth to hide a smile.
Draco’s blood turned to ice. The Dark Lord – here?
Blaise swivelled his head from its reclining position to fix Draco with a baffled expression. “Are you mental? I wouldn’t touch Granger with a ten-foot pole.”
As he looked up, he felt a dark presence pressing in, looking over his shoulder. He recognised the feeling at once – this was Legilimency. Someone was in his mind. But from so far away, surely it couldn’t be…
He was thinking of step one and how he could navigate the conversation back towards resolving the family drama when Mr DuPont spoke up. “You’re much better at this than your father, you know.”
“You’ll catch your death if you don’t take the cold seriously,” she said, her knowing chestnut eyes giving him a once over before returning to her book. “I suppose the locket isn’t giving you as much trouble today? Just let me know when you want to trade off.”
“Already tried that one,” muttered Fred, as Tonks withdrew her wand from its holster with authority.
“I have suffered your insolence long enough!” cried Voldemort, rising slowly to his full height and raising a wand — Dumbledore’s wand, Harry realised in an instant. “To think the child of a Muggle-born would dare defy me? Your parents’ power was nothing in the face of my own. I destroyed her, boy!”
She held up the cover so Harry could see an old 70s style motif and the words
Before casting the spell, Draco took one last moment to try and remember Harry like this. Hair tousled in a way that only could have looked artful to Draco, eyes shining with warmth and something like affection.
Voldemort knelt down to be eye level with her. “Look me in the eye when you speak, girl,” he demanded. “Now. What would you like to say to the boy who has the power to save you?”
Ivy slithered out of Harry’s pocket and he caught her and placed her on top of the covers, where she quickly made her way to the corner nearest Draco.
Draco screamed in pain as the flesh of his arm audibly sizzled from the burn. He had once wondered what the Marking Ceremony entailed, but the fact that it was as painful as a Cruciatus Curse should not have been surprising. He clenched his jaw, his fists, to bare down on the pain, but in a few moments it was over. Breathing heavily, he looked down at his arm, but there was nothing there.
“Perhaps, but I don’t want to take any chances. There was once another orphan brought to this school who wielded unprecedented power under the guise of innocence.”
But of course, if they asked what had changed his mind so completely, he wouldn’t be able to say anything about Potter. Even if he could, his friends may be too far gone to do anything but turn him, and Draco for harbouring the fugitive, into the outstretched hands of Lord Voldemort.
Fuck. The last thing Draco needed tonight was a nosy Slytherin poking his head in where it didn’t belong.
“But Hermione I really think—”
“Well, another few days wouldn’t put us much farther behind,” said McGonagall with a curt nod to Harry, which he and Hermione understood to indicate their swift departure.
The pale woman who had greeted them guided them through the club towards a booth near the stage, passing crowded tables with beautifully dressed, boisterous groups of witches and wizards, who reclined over the plush furniture and sipped elaborate looking drinks. The drone of conversation could hardly be heard over the steady beat of the music. Other pale, slightly shimmering women could be seen pouring bottles and dancing gracefully throughout the crowd.
As the days passed by, growing shorter and darker, the group spent more time together than ever before. Things had a natural rhythm about them.
“About time we got you in the mix, mate,” said George, with a smile in Draco’s direction.
“Luna! You’re alright,” said Harry, jumping up.
Lucius nodded, but said no more. Draco glanced at him, willing him to stay back for his own sake.
“I’ve never seen a Stinging Jinx do this kind of damage,” muttered Cedric, frowning.
“What you want…?” he said.
“And how does it feel to know that a guy with four weeks’ worth of magic knowledge beat you in a duel?” challenged Harry back across the table. Draco snorted into his Butterbeer.
“I know,” said Draco, glancing around for anyone who might overhear them. A few portraits looked on with interest. “I figured as much when I read the papers. Gone, is he?”
“What names did he give you?”
Draco unfolded the letter as Pansy peered surreptitiously over his shoulder. It was indeed an invitation to Wisteria Hall, signed by none other than Lucius Malfoy. Draco tried to suppress a look of confusion but Blaise was already smirking, knowing that he’d one-upped Draco at last.
Whatever he decided, Draco knew that he must remain close to Harry, and he must maintain his split allegiance. At least until he could figure things out for himself.
Harry stopped. “He had to go. He was called.”
“Damn it, you idiot, bring Lucius,” said Harry, rising to his feet to leer over the man. “The connection is weak. I need the potion before we separate.”
“No,” said Harry. “I think you’re trying to, but even if you’ve done terrible things, I know that’s not who you are. If you want me to yell and scream at you for all the stupid shit you’ve done, I will, but if you want me to hate you, I can’t. Or do you think you haven’t changed me as well?”
Draco sifted through his position; his original motivations for the match, as foolish as they felt now, were met unequivocally. He would move into a position of power with a powerful ally, and he had a reason to maintain his connection with Potter. What did he have to lose?
“Oh,” said Harry, simultaneously feeling rather stupid and wondering what it would be like to witness a time spell gone wrong at the age of nine.
“Right,” said Harry, clearing his throat. “
The words hit Harry like a gut punch. This was not how he wanted his reunion with Draco to go. “I know. Can you help her?”
“My thoughts exactly.”
It was kill or be killed. If there was any way he could motivate himself to commit this act, it was with the reasoning that only if he survived this thing would Harry be able to destroy the cup, and destroy the Dark Lord himself. Whatever pitiful life he had left to lead might not be worth it, but that certainly was.
, said Potter’s voice in his head.
“Well, you must have an excellent reason for it. After all, you can’t imagine I am in the practice of giving away information about my clientele. That would be a complete breach of their privacy,” said Ollivander.
“Forget something, Luna?”
Draco paced, frowning. “I have a family place I inherited that almost no one knows about. We can take the Floo from Hogsmeade, but we’d have to go straight away before they lock this place down.”
“I’m not sure I want to,” said Draco lightly, his pale eyes flitting across the board before landing on a pawn. “It wouldn’t be the same without your sorry arse on the 7th floor to sneak off to all the time. I think I’d be quite bored, actually.”
“Still?” asked Draco. Cedric turned to cast a withering look in Draco’s direction. Harry could feel a smile pulling at his lips.
Draco riffled through several drawers of mixed ingredients, snatching a few leaves of Alihotsy and a sprig of peppermint. Where was that house-elf when he needed her?
,” said Harry, tracing the familiar pattern in the air. The wand flickered to life, then sputtered, letting out a raspberry sound as it dimmed.
“If you must know, I’m on an errand for Undersecretary Umbridge,” said Draco cooly. The man visibly flinched. “I’m happy to come with you, but you’ll have to explain to her why you’ve detained the Head Boy when she’s expressly asked me to retrieve materials from the Headmaster’s office that may pertain to the case.”
“They summoned some creature with a mark in the sky, and it was hovering over—” Harry suddenly sat bold upright in bed, opening a searing pain down his leg where he’d been hit by a curse. “Where’s Charlotte?”
“They’re here. Hide,” said McGonagall curtly, as she took a seat in the old Headmaster’s chair. “You must leave this office first chance you get.”
Harry let go of the door handle and walked quietly back to his room. He pulled the covers up, forced his eyes closed, and attempted not to dream of the boy in Regulus’s room.
“No,” she said again, more confidently now. “I couldn’t think of it, Albus. It’s more than just fame getting to his head. There are a million reasons we shouldn’t leave him here. These people are vicious, to say the least. I’ve seen the way they treat others and I’ve only been here a matter of hours.”
As Draco left the room, he headed straight for the dungeons to tell Snape his plans to break the Fidelius. Harry’s presence went rigid, seemingly in disbelief. Draco pressed on, through the early months of Harry’s time in the castle. His attempts to get Pansy to cross their path, the letter to his mother. As he paced in the Slytherin common room on Halloween night, knowing his plan to expose Harry at the train station was in motion, Harry’s presence went stone cold.
“I’m in,” stuttered Draco. The memory of his own parents came unbidden to his mind. This is what he was here to do. To make sure no one else lost the ones they loved for someone else’s pointless war.
A profound satisfaction welled up in him, and he could feel himself smiling despite the pain in his scar. McGonagall was kneeling next to him in a flurry of green robes saying something but he hardly noticed it, because at that moment Harry could feel the cold sensation of his shadow form and he knew Voldemort could feel him too.
“So the knowledge of the diadem,” said Hermione, frowning slightly at the fact that Luna had figured it out before she did. “Is that we learn something about ourselves?”
“Yes, yes… what was your name, my boy?” asked Ollivander, beckoning Harry close with a knobby finger.
“Keep holding them back a little longer,” cried Harry, dashing past the body of the fallen Dark Lord, to the hearth of the fireplace. Blue flames cast a chilling glow on Draco’s body, as Harry fell to his side, tossing the burning sword to the floor with a clatter and dipping one hand under his shoulder to prop him up.
The face was distorted, twisted with malice and a vicious grin, like a hyena stalking its prey. But for all his vile presence, he barely resembled the face that Harry had seen in his visions.
“Not just any boarding school,” said Luna, making the first turn. “Riddle had a special attachment to Hogwarts, remember? And besides, we don’t know how the room gets what it needs.”
“Just because you can’t see them, doesn’t mean they aren’t there,” said Luna, doodling idly in the margins of the
The wand tip sputtered and a few sparks crackled to the ground. Hermione yelped, but Harry quickly stamped them out with his trainer. “Whoops,” he said with a weak smile. “Don’t make me go back to the quill.”
“I promise,” he said, as the memory faded away.
“A quest or a mad goose chase? He Who Must Not Be Named has a stranglehold on the Ministry and a following much larger than we thought. He has deployed followers all over Europe and possibly beyond. The International Council has fallen, and you expect two boys to take him on?”
“Shrub should probably not be saying, but sir is not alright,” said the elf, in a voice squeaky with concern. “Sir has fallen asleep at the Pensieve again, sir.”
“I know—” He attempted to say, “
He was just drawing a matrix of wand movement and incantation, to see if rearranging the two would have any effect on the spell, when there was a knock at the door. It was too late for any lessons, Hermione had already come by after dinner to drop off a new Charms textbook,
Sometimes when Draco looked at him, he thought he could discern what Harry was thinking, and though it would have been a simple push on his consciousness to use Legilimency to find out the truth, he never attempted it.
She squealed with glee, her girlish demeanour returning. “Yay! I’m so excited. I love getting what I want.” she held the deck out to him again. “Shall I give you another reading? A real one this time — I won’t interfere with the cards, I promise.”
“No, not that I didn't deserve it.”
“When did you figure it out?” asked Draco with a huff of laughter. Here he was thinking he was a master of keeping secrets, yet Harry seemed to know everything about him.
over her head as she studied it through a pair of strange glasses. “There’s a firsthand account of a travelling crone who encountered him in a forest there in 1988.”
By the time Draco got back down to the sitting room, Harry was already there with the others in an armchair by the fire. Hermione, freshly showered with her hair in a messy bun and wearing fleece pyjamas, sat cross-legged by the coffee table writing a list on a piece of parchment. Cedric sat on the couch in a brocade dressing gown that must have come from the old bedroom.
Draco was pacing across the gleaming marble floor of the Langham Hotel foyer, his eyes fixed on the wide glass doors.
“You can’t fool me, boy,” snapped Voldemort. “You think you know me? I know you just as well. Raised by Muggles in a loveless home. Forced to suppress any magical ability. Deceived by your mentor until it was far too late and even then only bringing you into the fold long enough to learn a few disarming spells. I can read it plain as day on your face, though it’s helped to have a bit of unplanned insight.”
“In fact, I always had a sneaking suspicion she liked you better than me,” said Tonks, linking elbows with Draco. “Hang on.”
How annoying. Draco had hoped the stupid painting would keep its mouth shut. He couldn’t have people like Loony Lovegood wandering around telling people he was softhearted, it would damage the reputation he’d worked for six years to build.
“I’m not sure,” said Luna, finally laying down the book and resting her chin in her hand to peer at Harry. “Every time I see him, all he does is ask about you.”
Harry’s heart dropped. The one thing they came for and they would have to leave it behind when it was right in their grasp.
“Incredible,” said Harry, feeling that Rowena Ravenclaw would have been proud that after all this time it was uncovered by a clever, unconventional witch from her own house. Even from an arm's distance away, he could feel the powerful pull of its magic; a cool, intriguing feeling so different from the dark, sinking feeling of the ring.
So the Fidelius could be weakened, Draco thought. But how to get McGonagall to do so unwittingly? Draco would need some time in Harry’s mind before breaking the charm fully. No need to risk this leverage escaping his clutches too soon.
“Bloody hell,” he whispered.
By the time he looked up, his plate was full of toast with one runny egg on top, and Nymphadora was smiling at him with a piece in her mouth and elbows on the table.
“It was definitely Horcrux,” said Harry, tossing the invisibility cloak on the bed. “You heard it, right Malfoy?”
“Anyone can take pain. But the Mark you must
“Oh,” said Harry, a bit surprised at this display of humility. “Well… right.”
“That’s silly Luna.” Hermione hunched over her parchment and Draco shifted to look over her shoulder as she used her wand to highlight squares in the timetable with varying colours.
“I knew that Harry would have to break the Fidelius, eventually. I only wish I had realised it sooner,” said the portrait, lacing his fingers together. “You were right, my good friend.”
They turned to rummage through the trunk again, but Harry’s hand paused on a bundle of fabric. “This must be the cloak,” he said, holding it up, but no sooner did he put his hand through it than it completely disappeared. “Woah!”
Harry burst into laughter, startling Malfoy.
Harry started laughing.
“While I think it’s highly unlikely that anyone else will follow the same path as Miss Lovegood,” continued McGonagall. “I think a recalibration of the room’s rules will do the trick. And we’ll of course bring Miss Lovegood into the Fidelius for good measure.”
The door opened to a small tidy room. The sun was low in the sky, casting shades of purples and oranges through a diamond paned glass window. A boy was reclining on a stone window seat, gazing out onto the lawn. Draco felt his heart lurch.
“Or here’s another one, Queen Titania’s Tiara. ‘Said to remove illusions from the eyes of the wearer,’” suggested Harry, but Luna merely blinked in response.
“Voldemort killed my parents,” said Harry tightly, feeling a tingling in his fingertips as the wand reacted with a crackling noise. “He’s taken my best friend and he tried to kill me, too. Not to mention, the Ministry’s in denial and the last person who could have defeated him is dead, so if we don’t start acting soon we may well all be in danger.”
At that moment the darkness of the room seemed to grow oppressively darker. The candle on the wall sconce flickered and sputtered and Harry had to concentrate to keep his Lumos from extinguishing.
“That’s strange, we haven’t spoken of Andromeda in years,” said Narcissa, slowly. “We were very close as children. But Andromeda chose her path. Your father and I chose another.”
“I think she was feeling threatened that I was asking to speak with you personally,” explained Hermione matter-of-factly.
“Alright have you got something?”
Her small hands slid under the lapels of his jacket and slipped it off over his shoulders. He’d have to act quickly if he was going to get out of this.
“What’s worse is I thought it was the right thing to do. I actually believed that a blood traitor who defied the Dark Lord deserved to die.”
“You’re not sleeping on the job are you?” she asked, before turning to spit toothpaste into the sink.
“Harry Potter,” said Harry, feeling incredibly silly to be shaking hands while dressed in his pyjamas.
“Give him here,” interrupted Dumbledore, the line of his mouth drawn tight.
Breakfast in the Great Hall was always a loud affair, but Draco was particularly annoyed by the chatter as he had spent longer than planned with Potter the night before, and was forced to stay up late to make a dent in his assignments for the week.
“Fine, if you must know, I’m meeting with Granger for tutoring. Pansy’s already aware. Any other opinions you care to make known, Blaise?” said Draco.
And yet the burning on his arm reminded him of the truth he was not yet ready to reveal.
McGonagall’s face dropped into a grim expression, and she took in a long breath of air through her nose. Perhaps he’d gone too far evoking memories of his dead parents, but he didn’t regret it. He had to get out.
“Father, yes. That is if he hasn’t tried to use it to open the Chamber of Secrets already.”
“How have your Occlumency lessons been going?” asked Hermione, as she and Harry finished setting up the Room of Requirement for his first defence lesson with Cedric.
“Got it,” he said.
Harry turned to shield himself from the blade as it erupted in flame with a screech like a dragon. He bit down against the blinding pain in his scar and the scorching heat from the blade on the side of him that wielded it, forcing himself to focus on his purpose. On the magic coursing through him, and the villain who stood before him, and of the boy who he may yet save.
Harry felt a flicker of fear as he looked into the crimson eyes, but he refused to let it deter him. With a last burst of magic he raised the flaming sword, and in a single stroke, brought it down on Voldemort, severing his head and sending the frail body to the ground in a crumpled heap.
“And that, I do regret,” said Voldemort, his face falling into a fabricated expression of remorse. “My hand was forced, by none other than Dumbledore’s prophecy. But I hope to spare you the same fate. In fact, I wish to make you an offer… to join me.”
“Don’t be dramatic,” said Pansy playfully. “He’s an Auror. I’m sure he’s getting patched up for either all the time.”
“Let me save you the trouble – he’s not interested,” said Pansy, casting a half-lidded glare at Hermione that could boil water.
“Ok good!” said Angelica, flopping back in an overly stuffed leather armchair. “This will be fun. Daddy has played all the best courses.
