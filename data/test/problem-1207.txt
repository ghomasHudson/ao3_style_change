“You had left a sour taste in my mouth.” Draco did not like that answer, and Harry shrugged, “Hagrid had told me that Vold- You-know-who had been a Slytherin, Ron expanded it by saying nearly all bad wizards had been Slytherins and then you nailed it in with the wonderful introduction of yours. Everything had led me to believe that was the path to destruction, and I wanted to prove I was good and worthy of people’s time, after being told otherwise my whole life.”
“Death-eaters! They attacked the campsite and took the muggle caretakers hostages. The ministry is trying to deal with them.” Neville tried pulling Harry with him, but Harry remained frozen.
Hermione on the other hand, decided he needed time alone to ponder what happened. Sitting in the common room, Ron and Hermione off to the side doing their homework and glaring at anyone who got near him, he pondered how it really was. Not his broken memories, not the faint memories of an infant, not the stories, theories, retelling of every noisy person in Hogwarts and the wizarding world... what really happened. How did his parents feel. Did they blame him for being destined for this life? Did they blame themselves for fitting the bill of the prophecy? Did they blame whoever made the prophecy, Voldermort, life? Did they live their final days in peace, no blame, no worries, just enjoying each other as a family?
Hermione sneered, feeling slightly insulted, “You couldn’t have expected answers from us. There’s only one person who can answer your questions, and you two have made him somewhat aggressive towards all of us, so now none of us can approach him.”
Harry sighed and contemplated letting him keep sleeping, enjoy this moment, unsure if he’ll ever get it again, still not entirely sure those dreams are visions or what. He squeezed his hand. It didn’t wake him, only alerted him to the uncomfortable position he was in, and Harry internally groaned as Draco just slid sideways, his head landing on Harry’s shoulder. Draco shuffled a bit, unconsciously getting more comfortable in the position, before letting out a tiny sigh and settling back to his deep sleep.
When Draco replied his tone was quiet, like he realized he was overreacting and wanted to prove he was in control, “What does that have to do with anything?”
Ron choked on a chuckle, hiding his face in his arms as Binns glared at them, Hermione whispering to Harry, also amused, “Good things come to those who wait.”
I'm writing this for free! I'm not asking for your money, I'm taking time out of my schedule to entertain you. All I ask is that you comment and let me know that my work is not being eaten by the void. I don't even mind if all the 10 comments are by the same person, I will be fucking excited to write a chapter for that one excited reader.
Harry could feel the bile rising up. This man was practicing torture in front of children, without any reservation.
Draco glared at Helena before walking away to a bench, and Harry nodded, leaving him to decide whether he wanted Harry gone or if Harry could continue to broach this subject.
“Nothing.” Ron shook his head, dropping a few treats on Harry’s lap and making for the door, “I’ll get you some tea.”
“Why are you protec-” It felt like Hermione slapped his memory and every question had one answer. “Your father.”
He was extremely disoriented when he woke up though, presumably hours laters. Mostly because Ron was sitting a few tables away. Ron gave a half smile and waved the map at him. “I lied to Hermione after she came back from the library and told her you were sleeping and not to bother you.”
I wrote the first half of this before the trip and the second half in the last 24 hours. To be 100% honest with you, there was a small shift in the story because I genuinely can't remember what ... what Harry's plan was. (I should've written it down.) I'm still not sure about the path I took, or even where this might lead. But I'm strangely excited for the shift.
Ron had an array of reactions to what he saw. First he laughed even more. Then he started to tell Harry how that had to mean that Malfoy was his enemy, cutting it quick and short when Harry lifted up his right wrist to remind him who his real enemy was. Then it finally settled in and the harsh wave of shock hit Ron, mouth agape, eyes wide open, looking at Harry like a fish out of water. And finally, pity.
Please share this story with your friends and on tumblr, and share with me your opinions on Harry's behavior in this chapter.
Harry took three quick bites and left, not saying anything to Ron or Hermione, just looking in his bag for the Marauders map.
Ron nodded, face looking tired and scared and worried, altogether, “Use your broom… That’s what Moody said?”
Harry’s hand, gripping Draco’s left wrist, squeezed tighter. And it’s all in the seconds. The quick looks. The deep breaths. The fear. The excitement. The truth. His eyes in Draco’s. His fingers squeezing his veins. The rising of his chest. The fatigue. The second long thought.
The day passed with little to no problems. It was sometime after supper when Harry managed to drag Ginny away from a group a giggling tweens into an empty classroom. The words on the board look like glyphs, so Harry guessed it was an active classroom. One of those classes he refuses to even bother taking. He can’t bullshit himself out of homework in those classes. After calming down a slightly panicked and embarrassed Ginny who swore him into secrecy regarding her worrying that her older brother might have been in trouble, Harry allowed Ginny to become the fourth person he’s ever shown his wrist to. And just like her older brother, she laughed.
It took him a while to open his eyes, his body wanting to go back to sleep, and he had to have Ron help him get dressed and help him get to the Gryffindor tower. According to Ron, Harry had been glaring at Hermione one second and the next his head dropped on the table, and no matter what anyone did, Harry wouldn’t wake up. Pomfrey had told Ron and Hermione that it was most likely symptoms of stress and that’s what Hermione spread when she went back to class to continue getting the class notes for Ron and Harry. Harry had slept for two days.
And now, I'm back to school. But if you've been following me for a while you know by now I write more when I have homework to avoid, so, rejoice.
Draco looked conflicted between smiling in satisfaction, laughing at the play, and glaring at Harry so as to not give Harry the satisfaction of making Draco smile. Harry stared at Draco too much, he realized.
Ron rolled his eyes, pulling Harry who was about to walk unto some unsuspecting freshmen. “I get crushes, ‘Mione. It’s been four years of school. I’ve seen an array of those. But Harry needs to control himself. Basic self-control. Focus on the damn class and not on blondie.”
I apologize for the delay... I graduated! I finished my huge year long senior project. I have not had even a semblance of closure due to my graduating being cancelled and us graduates not even having been acknowledge in any way, 5 years of college for this, but hey. It's over. I can now dedicate some time to mindless work and fun hobbies like writing and drawing.
It was faint, it was blurry, it was long over, but he could hear it. The last moments of his parent's life, the green glow, the ruined nursery. Harry should’ve listened to his gut.
He knew of the Ravenclaw Seeker, Cho Chang, becoming close and friendly with the Hufflepuff Seeker, Cedric Diggory, and how his classmates made fun of him for a while because she was younger than him, but backed off as they saw they had each other on their wrists. No one question if they were made for each other when on their opposing wrist they both had Voldemort.
Dumbledore grabbed it from the air, turning it quickly and smiling in relief, as he looked towards the Hufflepuff table, “And the champion for Hogwarts will be.. Cedric Diggory.”
Draco was silent. Assessing the situation, eyeing Harry like a prey to a meal. He shook his head, “Everything about you screams danger. I’m a snake. I have a strong instinct for self-preservation. . . A lot.”
The duo had a stare off, trying to see who would break first, that being Harry when he sighed in defeat and shaking his head, “The question has been bothering me since I saw him that night. He looked at me like I was the last thing he wanted to see…”
And then he saw the Dursleys, and he saw Dudley. And he knew immediately that Dudley was only hateful and judgemental towards him because his uncles raised him to be that way. That Dudley didn’t know or care or understand homosexuality until his parents explained it to him. That he didn’t care still until his parents told him it was bad. That Dudley has always mimicked his parents. That Dudley was a reflection of the Dursleys adults.
Sleep was a complicated issue for him when he was in Gryffindor tower. It sometimes came when he didn’t want it, but mostly it never did. But next to this boy… it was like calmly submerging himself into still waters.
Harry did everything to not smirk, finally finding the question to break him. He was impressed with his poker face skills.
Harry now wanted to actually go ask Diggory for help, rather than being stuck in between Ron and Hermione while they argued. Literally in between.
“Yes, but her insults could cut you. So I’d worry about that.” Draco was indignant in his response, realizing he did throw Parkinson under the proverbial bus.
Hermione, Ron and Harry sat by, watching seniors upon seniors push their friends around to put their names in the goblet, or put their names in themselves. It was a spectacle as they teased each other and dared one another, and there was silence in their trio, but even a stranger could tell how badly Ron and Harry wanted to join the group of reckless teens.
From inside a large lump of fabric fell heavy on his bed. This was either a very hard and heavy pillow or something wrapped in a soft material for its protection. Pulling at the material Harry found that it was neither. A soft, black afghan was wrapped around an array of products and a crumpled note. Along with a book talking about sleep disorders and muggle and wizard remedies, there was also some Valerian root and some lavender. In Harry’s uneducated mind, none of these things had any correlation except the blanket and the book.
The section of the Slytherin table with Durmstrang in it burst out in celebration, and many students from Beauxbaton and Hogwarts joined in the cheers as their favorite quidditch player joined the frayed.
“I was confused, in a new place, and scared. I had no idea where I stood or what was going on. I trusted people blindly. I’m not saying I’m against Ron now, but I can see where he was wrong, just like how I can see where you went wrong as well, to help me create that image of you being dangerous. But then I learned.”
Please share, more than anything on tumblr, and help others know that this story is being continued.
Harry shrugged, “It was the most liberating thing I did. When I stopped caring about the Dursleys… there was nothing to hurt for if there was nothing to care for. When they stopped meaning anything to me, nothing they said could hurt me, they could never disappoint me, and I could never disappoint them.”
After a sigh Hermione shrugged, “It’s her life Ron, if she says it's okay, then don’t impose your discomfort on her.”
The parcel was fat and heavy on Harry’s lap, and simply said Harry P. in bold capital letters. Harry looked at Neville, “Did you think for a second that maybe someone might be trying to hurt me and thus they sent a parcel with something that could kill me?”
Harry woke up to the collective groaning of all his dorm mates. Who had snuck in the whiskey, no one would tell.
He did sleep. An empty, dreamless nap after supper and anxiety about missing his… date? Woke him up at five past eleven. Unsure of what to do, Harry just grabbed his cloak and map and decided to wait for Draco in the tower.
Ron nodded, catching up and realizing the picture did not look good, regardless of how happy Hermione was to have at least gotten the picture, “But if he’s your soulmate, and Lu- Lefty Senior is with You-Know-Who, you being Lefty’s soulmate is… basically the most inconvenient thing for him.”
Harry stared at the diary in front of him. He saw the memory, and he more confused now than he has ever been before. This was Tom Riddle’s diary, that was Tom Riddle’s memory. That happened fifty years ago. His soul mate was … 70? I mean, granted from the memory, Tom was very attractive,  but by now he should be 70… a problem for later.
“No, Ronald has hated you for years, Hermione has felt apprehensive about you for years. But that’s not how it’s been for me.”
Harry smiled as she dabbed more on his cheek that slowly healed. It hurt, but her caring did make it better.
Harry playfully elbowed Hermione as he looked for the coins, replying mockingly, “And what a great job you’ve done, the results are astonishing.”
Hermione huffed, taking the tray from Ron’s hand and getting up to go, “And you were angry when we didn’t. Regarding both options, I decided that making you aware was going to be more helpful, than letting you wonder why we were babying you.”
Harry slightly flinched when the crease in his neck where his jaw and his neck connect was covered by the palm of Draco’s hand and he had all but a second before his mind was silenced. And Harry felt small. Harry felt so small as his hands reached and pulled on the neck of Draco’s shirt, needing him so close, needing him to never pull away, feeling a tickle in his stomach as Draco’s hands slowly left his neck and snaked their way around his back, his waist, looking for the same proximity. Harry’s hands reaching up and wrapping around his neck.
“The Unforgivable Curses are three spells that if casted would result in immediate imprisonment in Azkaban.  They are named so because they are, in fact, unforgivable.” Hermione dictated quick and precise, like a talking book.
“I believed him a cheater, blackmailer, and criminal… didn’t think he would abuse his own child. The concept still feels foreign to me. Malfoy is the only kid Lucius has, why would he risk it?” Ron muttered, shuffling around.
Later was now, Ginny slowly dying right next to him. Tom Riddle spelling his name with his, Harry’s, wand, looking just as beautiful as he did 50 years ago. Watching as the letters rearranged themselves to spell the name of the enemy every told him he had, but he didn’t think much of due to the name on his wrist.  I am Lord Voldemort.
In truth, he never slept, and got up to try and get some information of where the kitchen was and if maybe there was something that could wake him up. The other two options were go to Snape and ask him for a potion; no, or go to Pomfrey, ask her for a potion and sit there for two hours as she scolded him for his bad sleeping habit; hard no.
“Hmm?” She didn’t even look up from her porridge, and Harry didn’t look away from the snow that began to fall out the window.
Harry sat between Ron and Hermione, a new constant in his life, watching attentively the Gryffindor table making bets on who would be chosen for the tournament.
Hermione shrugged, “Ron noticed you left but didn’t come back, and when I woke up at five he told me about it so I made a few guesses at what might have happened. I then asked Ron to get the marauders map, confirmed my suspicion, and came down here to make sure things were going good. Then we saw you were just sitting there taking a nap and figured it would be bad for the both of you if people saw, we don’t want that drama yet, so we sat here, stopping people from coming by. There’s not much we could’ve done about slytherins coming out, so thank heavens none appear to be morning people.”
“Until I was nine the lie almost held up. But I just kept finding more and more articles in the Prophet with your name on it and I became obsessed, and I knew your name was basically forbidden in the manor, so I hid it. And then while in the middle of an argument, as he was grounding me for speaking out of turn and making him look bad in front of his friends, he searched my closet for something to hurt me with.” Draco shrugged with the same nonchalant airiness Harry has regarding the abuse he dealt with at the Dursleys, “ Could be a belt, could be something I held precious that he would then destroy… He found the box full of the ripped articles. Mom had no idea what lie to formulate to save me from that. He saw it as me deciding what roles they were supposed to play. That was the first time he hit me with his own hand.”
“Was it one of the slytherins?” The bruise appeared to cover half his face, clearly it had been a black eye and a bruised lip at one point, and Harry finally understood why Draco had missed three days of class. Harry tried to look back and remember if Draco had been unpleasant with anyone recently.
“Your father, does he hate me?” Draco opened his mouth, but Harry interrupted, “Aside from the fact that me existing means that his precious ex-boss is dead. Does he have other reasons to hate me?”
It was an hour later before he was let go, emotionally and psychologically tired as he walked towards his house. He heard the murmured insults and digs at him from the few students who were still hanging around, waiting for curfew, and ignored them. He was waiting outside of his dorm, waiting for The Fat Lady to finish her rant about safety and what it really meant to be brave and that the tournament was not the place to prove it when he noticed a shine of silver a few staircases down. He blatantly turned to try and find the source but it was gone. Harry sighed, thinking back on Malfoy’s emotional shift when Harry’s name was called out. Was he worried? Did he care?
MY. GOD! I'll be surprised if anyone is still reading this (I know one person is, their comment inspired me to come back and finish this chapter that was a few words away from being finished... 4 MONTHS AGO!)
Harry sighed and nodded, following Ron off to get ready. According to Ron the older gryffindors had agreed to take the day to teach the younger and uneducated gryffindors how to dance. And Harry was interested in that.
But here he was, in front of the Grand hall waiting for Professor McGonagall to call them in for sorting, and this Draco Malfoy prat was quickly making himself an enemy. As soon as he heard the name, “My name is Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”, Harry felt chills down his back as he knew he’d found one of his wrist prophecies. At only eleven.
“Why did you ask him to, Potter?” Harry became aware that Draco was stalking him now, leading him backwards, maybe to intimidate him, or maybe to make it easier for him to run away if Harry was far away from the stairs, “Why do you want me to be your... “ Draco looking around dramatically, before mockingly ending it with, “Friend?”
After watching two schools make a spectacle of their arrival, the school joined them in the grand hall to find they were to share a table with the Slytherins and Ravenclaws. Ron wouldn’t shut up about how Victor Krum was here at the school with them. Harry couldn’t ignore that Victor Krum was seated next to Malfoy and they appeared to be having a nice conversation.
Harry’s left hand grabbed Draco’s wrist, panic immediately flinching in his eyes. Harry’s finger enveloped the wrist, covering throughout with his fingers, lifting it up between their faces. Draco’s eyes were panicked and glued to his own. Harry sighed. He didn’t know what he was doing anymore. But he could see it, in the corner of his eyes, Draco’s name sparkling with every lighting flash in the sky.
Harry nodded, “Ice. It should help with the pain. And believe me or not, pineapples. A great snack that will help ease the bruising.”
Harry had learned long ago to wear long sleeves to hide his wrist in fear of being bullied for having both male names on his wrist. Once both Dudley and Harry had been old enough to understand the concept of morals, homosexuality, and shame, Dudley had joined on his parents’ bandwagon of shaming Harry for having both male names. So, Harry hid his wrists.
And now he’s asking Draco to be vulnerable for him, to him. Harry’s not sure if he would be able to do that if the tables were reversed.
They all turned to Harry, remembering once again that Harry grew repressed from everything he should have known.
Molly paused, probably having a vague idea of how horrible the Dursleys had been to him due to the story of the bars on his windows and little slips here and there from him to Ron, and sometimes in front of the Weasleys.
Despite wanting to glare at the blonde, all he really did was pitiful pout and then grumpily stare off into the distance, melancholy on his face.
I think was justified to ask for even one comment before posting another chapter, when normally you are required to pay $5-$25 before reading a book. And you most likely looked for the reviews to see if it's worth reading.
Harry ignored him, wrapping his wrist once again, not ready to go through this with the entire Weasley clan, all in one night, “He’s not done for. He can’t be.”
Soon the Weasleys were going to pick him up to take him to the Quidditch World Cup, and he would be able to rid himself of one of the bandages. The only one they knew about.
It’s not that Harry is mad at Arthur and is trying to find a reason to hate him. Arthur has done great things for him that he doesn’t know how he would repay them.
Harry shrugged at Hermione, walking past her towards the stairs, he needed a shower and proper clothes for class.
Harry followed Hermione’s whispered order only to realize he’d been aggressively glaring at the board. McGonnagall seemed very confused, but also seemed to understand it was not directed at her since he was clearly not paying attention. She deals with hundreds of angsty teens a year, she must be used to misdirected emotions.
Draco pulled out his wand, sighing as he did the Ventus spell. A beautiful swirl of wind encompassed him, drying him from toe to head. Never one to do a simple drying spell, huh.
Draco closed his eyes in what appeared to be annoyance but the faint smile that appeared later showed that Draco enjoyed explaining this as much as Hermione did, “Helga Hufflepuff, who was also a Hufflepuff by marriage, had a son named Henry, Godric Gryffindor had a daughter named Sarena who was hard to track down for historians seeing as there was nearly no document stating she was a Gryffindor by birth, only her married name Sarena Peverall, and Salazar Slytherin has no known heirs, but the family name and… spirit went on with his nieces and nephews. Caught up?”
I know it took a LONG time for this to come, enough time for someone to write what they thought would happen.
Harry shrugged, “He seemed terrified that I would suggest that. I think at first he was more offended due the fact that the Yule Ball is so public, and-... Yeah.”
“And I’m going to take a wild guess and say Lefty didn’t take that too well,” Ron finished, smirking.
He shook his head, “What is your greed? We all have suffered those emotions, those feelings at one point or another. No one is free of them. What is your greed?”
Voldemort, back or not, has and will always be a constant threat on his life. Deatheaters are back. Lucius might be one of them. Which could spill over to Draco. Who was assigned to be his soulmate. But he didn’t know if he was Draco’s soulmate, so this could all be for naught. And Draco currently has a strong distaste for them, so it’s hard to talk to him. And! Now there’s so dumb tournament going on in the school that’s only permitted for the seniors so Harry couldn’t use that as a distraction, and he reaLLY WANTED A DISTRACTION!
“No.” The smile shifted to that of someone keeping a secret, “It seems like someone, oh I don’t know, forgot the entire reason why he came here in the first place?” Ron extended his hand for another attempt to teach Harry.
“I kept wondering, what would it mean. To die right then, to a dragon, in a competition I never consented to participate in. In front of all my friends and classmates. In front of strangers. My death as much of a spectacle as my parents’.”
Harry turned to look at Draco who was bare as bare could be, hope covering every inch of his face, “Promise me it will end well.”
2. I'm currently writing two fics, this one and an unnamed Reylo fic (Can you tell what kind of couples I ship?), while also doing some graphic design work for my mom, while also learning how to web design, while also doing acrylic paintings (practicing), while also painting the new rooms in the house, while also sparking up my imagination by building an entire village in minecraft, while also indulging in extra sleep because I don't have a real job... so you can see why it takes a while. I might have a mild case of ADHD...
Hermione sighed, “Ron, I appreciate your father’s efforts to try and understand the muggles, but your father, along with many if not all of the wizards treat muggles like they’re animals in the zoo! Gaze at them from afar, careful when you study them ‘because they’re unpredictable’, always amazed with them when they do something new. ‘Oh look, the muggles made light without magic, how amazing of them.’. It’s degrading. But I’m not faulting your father because he, along with Draco and many others wizards come from generations upon generations of thinking muggles are below them and we should have segregation between us.
Harry shrugged, their anger not being able to so much as graze the fullness in his heart that warmed him all over. “In the tower.”
Harry nodded and followed Ron towards the closest male’s bathroom, where Ron handed him his bag. “Store your clothes there.”
Harry nodded, glaring at nothing in particular as Diggory patted his shoulder. “Don’t worry, the school won’t let you be in too much danger. Maybe this will be good. Maybe they’ll lower the difficulty.” Diggory jokes, laughing shyly and stopping when Harry didn’t join him.
Malfoy looked apprehensive, staring off to the side, but continued nodding like he wanted this conversation to end now.
Draco didn’t appear to believe Harry, but he allowed Harry’s fingers to reach his cheek. Just from the graze of a touch Harry could feel the hot blood that had accumulated on his cheek and was slowly leaving the impact zone. He could feel the sharp bones underneath the tense and slightly swollen muscles. Muscle memory told Harry to be softer, that even it being yellow and almost gone, it still hurt. Much more considering it’s close impact to his eyes.
“Let me tell you, Amos, my boy tells me that when that ‘attack’ with the poor hippogriff happened, that the Malfoy son, walked up to it and attacked it to anger it. Hungry for attention that boy is. Just like his father, if they’re not the stars of the show, no one else-”
He nodded, passing the fat lady and entering the dorm where he was met with more hostility and two panicked looking friends.
“Hmm?” Harry had a feeling of what he was agreeing to, but he needed to hear it. He also had a feeling that Draco knew his ‘hmm’ was said with all intentions of goading that out of him if his glare and response were anything to go by.
And like Hermione insinuated for him to do, just as they were leaving Hermione just happened to trip, pushing Harry perfectly in Draco’s direction. Neither were expecting it. Harry picked himself up quickly, making sure his hand graced Draco’s, a note stealthily -hopefully- passed, and then forced himself not to apologize or help him as Ron dragged him away.
“Quidditch Cup. Father told me to go ahead while he talked to some friend of his, and…” He sighed, “I guess from the context you were telling Weasley for the first time. All I saw was my name.”
“That’s a misconception. It’s the whole teaching students that don’t come from wizarding families. Blood purity and all that.”
Draco turned towards them confused, then glancing at Harry for a hint of an answer only to find an uncomfortable itch on the corner of Harry’s lips before turning back to Ron who for the first time ever seemed uncomfortable and scared to pick a fight with Draco. There was simply no reason for it in Ron’s mind, so he had to poke the hornet's nest, “Word on the streets’ that your father was involved in the attack at the world cup. Should we be expecting you to join them as well?”
“When aren’t you?” Draco was staring at the hands, watching how his name on Harry’s wrist rubbed against his father’s name on his own. He twisted his hand to avoid that, not pulling away though.
Draco shrugged, “I don’t know either. Pansy makes a lot of plans that always fall through. So I wouldn’t worry.”
Harry sighed, staying quiet for a few minutes as he figured out something that both he and Ron could understand, “So err… Left?” He said pointing at the left arm no one else would be able to see, “Left, err… on the day that I passed out I uh, I left early to try and find something to keep me awake-”
Very few people hid their wrists. He knew of one case where this girl hid her wrists, not because she was ashamed of who was her soul mate, who she had already met and was friends with, but because who was her enemy. Because clearly, her own mother couldn’t be her soul mate.  Prof. Sprout did not take kindly to the news, and it was now a full-blown investigation into child abuse.
Draco turned to - what they could only guess- steal a glance at Harry, before blatantly panicking at seeing both Harry and Ron staring at him, and turning away to aggressively watch the game.
Harry glared at it before remembering why he’d come here, then sighed and nodded, grabbing Ron’s hand and now paying a ridiculous amount of attention to every move and step Ron made, trying to copy it. Despite the motivator, it still took another two hours to get Harry to a nearly decent stage, still needing a few reminders along the way.
He saw Hermione quietly but joyfully join her parents who proudly and quietly stood by her side as she began to goad about all of her achievements this year.
He didn’t count on Ron being told to check that he was in fact asleep, so he sighed when Ron pulled on his curtain, “Yes.”
“Hermione, you’ve read every history book that Hogwarts uses. You could give the class yourself. You don’t need to pay attention.”
Hermione looked to the ceiling, frustrated, before pulling her boys and walking away from the stagnant crowd, “Malfoy senior put a lot of effort to not let Dr- Lefty talk to Harry. Even last night according to Harry.”
It took three firm squeezes from Hermione before he realized that class was over. Many students had left, a few hindered around either gawking at Harry or Neville. Moody was shooing them away, trying to get a moment alone with Neville, telling Harry that he had to see it, he had to know what happened.
Forgive me if you disagree. Can't wait to read your comment saying so. Regardless, chapter nine will be coming in a few minutes.
Draco slowly lifted his controlled nonchalant expression to Harry as if to say, ‘You brought him here. This is your fault.’, before turning to glare at Ron.
Harry smiled, not looking away from the frosty eyes that ravaged the skin on his wrist and he felt warm. In the cold autumn, rainy night he felt warm. “Do you trust me?”
No one listened to Arthur when he told them Lucius was not to be trusted. That he was a Deatheater. And later it became more obvious why; many of them were also Deatheaters, or were benefiting from the Deatheaters’ cause. The Ministry had been rotting for over a decade, and just when Arthur was beginning to chip away at the rot, Lucius nurtured it. And it grew so much that people couldn’t even remember how it’d look like before the rotting. Many still don’t. People now see it as a given. The rotting had become the new normal, and that… angered Arthur.”
Draco nodded, “You do. You, who are already a part of history, need to know what happened before you, how history was shaped and what the biased history books remove in belief that that information was not important. What is misinformation, what is gossip believed to be truth. How did those wars end, how to prevent another one… How to end one.”
Harry nodded, and then another bout of silence, “What do the Slytherins plan with recruiting the Huffies and the Claws?”
Hermione then pulled them both behind her and ran ahead, catching up with Ginny and pretending she didn’t just threaten them both.
“No. With me there will always be choices. It would rip me apart, but if you decided to walk away now and forbid me from ever even looking at you again, I would do it. You have enough on your plate and I don’t plan on being another menace in your life.” Draco looked up once Harry finished, flinching under the seriousness of Harry’s voice, of his eyes. Harry wondered if Draco has felt love or utmost dedication in the past few… ever. If Lucius had ever loved him, if Narcissa had ever praised him, hugged him, if either of them ever let Draco know that he was worthy of love, of protection, of being adored.
Zabini looked like he was tired of this argument, Parkinson looked like this argument was far from over, and Draco didn’t even look like he was paying attention. So of course he nearly jumped out of his skin when Harry snuck behind them and pulled on Draco’s belt loops.
Draco huffed, sort of laughing but not seeming to want to put an effort to do so, “Church, the worst book club.”
Wait… how long had he been staring at Malfoy? Had he had that smile the entire time? Had Malfoy also been staring back the entire time? Why didn’t Ron stop him? Why didn’t he stop now that he was aware? He tried… But Malfoy was staring back. Not angry, not confused, not aggravated. Just curious... Innocent curiosity. Like he was trying to have a silent conversation with Harry, with just their eyes. Harry didn’t need words to know Malfoy just wanted to know why he was staring, and behind that question was the more important one; why was he smiling while doing so…
Harry looked at Arthur who was blatantly glaring back at elder Malfoy, and wondered what age-old feud laid between them.
He heard as a few of them, Ron included, cursed out Hermione, demanding that she leave and close their curtains. Harry simply couldn’t believe that Hermione dared to open the drapes of any teenage boy who she knew had been drinking the night prior. Who knows what you’d find.
Harry shrugged, slowly joining Draco and staring up to the stars, “We agreed to meet up with Molly this weekend and try to coerce her into talking with your mom and … yeah, you get it.”
Draco didn’t look at him, only at the plain, gray, brick wall which hid a bunch of Slytherins behind, he sighed, “Cunning. Ambition. Which of those do you think makes us evil?”
Ron seemed like he wanted to retort but had nothing to deliver, until Fred and George ran in, bragging about a potion that would challenge the barriers, and in their gloating, Harry both heard Hermione groan, and saw as Malfoy rolled his eyes, already predicting their failure. And Harry smiled, as he imagined a world where Voldemort didn’t exist, where social status didn’t matter and Malfoy and Hermione were friends, smarting their way out of any situation, dragging Ron and Harry out of danger and taking over the world with their wits. They would be dangerous together, and Harry craved it. Malfoy friends with his friends. Malfoy a part of his life.
They held. And as the dragon flew up to try and eat him, Harry did what he does best, and dove with his broom underneath the dragon, stole the egg and flew the fuck away from there before the dragon could realize what had happened. He heard the cheers, but didn’t want to risk it not being over, so it was one hell of a scare he gave the other champions when he crash landed inside the tent. Pomfrey was not happy. Well… she was, that he came back alive. Not happy that he landed on his face and skidded a bit. Dittany would save Harry’s face from scarring any more, ‘but that’s not the point Potter, the point is you need to be more careful!’.
Draco sighed, and as if to spite them both, very slowly opened the letter and then made sure neither of the Gryffindors could see the contents as he slowly read. And then re-read it a few times over.
“Why were you out for so long? What if something had happened? You’re not back to full health Harry!” He heard them following after him diligently, up till that second where Ron pulled Hermione back and whispered something to her.
Harry caved to his own selfish desires and quickly kissed him. Harry pulled back and in fascination watched the array of emotions that went through Draco’s face. At first nothing but a faint sleepy smile as he almost leaned back in, but then he sleepily looked around and in Draco’s eyes he saw the realization of what Harry had said and done befall him. Draco blinked himself awake, his faint smile dropping as he quickly got up to his feet. “It’s morning.”
2. Firefox kept trying to spellcheck all the words into American english... "Rumour" to "Rumor", and here I am like.... bruh, google docs got the message after three ignores that this was a british story, when are you gonna get the message?
Harry remembered the scar that could still adorn Draco’s neck if he fails to keep him away from Lucius or Bellatrix. He remembers the bindings in the suffocating room in a world where he’s driven to insanity by Draco’s death. He remembers the feel of the man on his lap as he holds on to a sleeping infant in his arms.
Harry nodded, “I’m looking for coffee, or tea… I don’t know and I don’t care, as long as its highly caffeinated.”
Once he calmed down his breathing he finally noticed Hermione’s soft hand on top of his clenched fist. He turned to look at her and her expression pleaded for him to calm down. It also warned him that they were going to talk about it later.
He sighed, “It’s morning. Students are bound to start coming out soon. . . And we are literally outside of the Slytherin entrance.”
“I’m sorry ‘Mione, I don’t get what I’m supposed to get from that, other than Lucius is an arse. Even to his own kid.” Ron murmured, forgetting their code altogether.
Hermione sighed, “I don’t think anything will phase her after what happened during her first year here. Nothing can top being possessed and nearly dying.”
Harry froze and his will left him. What a monster was he to wake him. But mostly, it was the bareness in Draco’s face. No lies, no masks, just a teenage boy wondering why he was being woken up when all he wanted was to go back to sleep. And Harry loved that.
“The original idea was to train Helena to take the place as the first Headmistress of Hogwarts. Out of the four heirs of the founders-”
Draco sighed, seeming to contemplate whether to reply or not, deciding Harry would arrive at his own conclusions anyway so he might as well make them as truthful as possible. He’d yet to see the Granger girl screaming to ‘rescue’ him. He’d figured that if Harry had told Granger of the bruising Granger’s self-righteous instincts would be too much for her and she would have forced Harry to do something. He didn’t think Harry asking him to leave his family was Granger’s suggestion. It sounded too selfish. He shrugged, “If anyone asks he will say he’s visiting to talk about school matters, to discuss with Dumbledore uneasiness with the School Board.”
Well, not really jewelry. To be honest, they were just scrappy wrists wraps made from some of Dudley’s very large clothes. There was material to spare and he could still wear those shirts, as long as he ripped them from the bottom.
Seamus shrugged, dropping on his bed, “Not for our sake, but for hers. I’m sure seeing a few cocks is going to traumatize a girl like her.”
That was a healing bruise. On Draco’s face. Harry didn’t know how Draco had hidden it, but whatever Draco had used was fading, and the purple edges around his left eye had become clearer with another rub of Draco in panic. Makeup? Probably.
Harry nodded, his fingers grazing Draco’s, slowly intertwining, “But you are lonely. I know that. I know how that feels. To have thousands of people around you, to have a family, and still feel so lonely. Like you might as well be alone with how suffocating it feels to be around them. You are being fed wrong. You have what you want, but not what you need.”
“He shouldn’t have to do anything, Harry. I understand well enough why Draco behaves like he does. And so should Arthur. We’ve seen how Lucius is and how he treats his son. Draco doesn’t have to explain anything.”
“Alright, when my sanity finally cracks I promise to pose your corpse and decorate it with flowers. I promise you’ll be the most attractive corpse anyone will ever find in this school.”
Harry stared at Draco’s face, looking for a whole minute at his nervous ticks like biting the inside of his lips and pressing his nails into the palms of his hands. Draco did not like Harry’s silence, the hypocrite. The lip biting was a nervous tick, the nail carving was an angry nervous tick. There was a faint redness in the palms of his hands. His nails were breaking skin. He sighed, “Why?”
“Harry thinks he’s too close with M-… him.” Hermione looked around, noticing a few people who shouldn’t be paying attention to their conversation, were.
And for a second Harry forgot why. And then Harry understood why Draco just ‘attacked’ him out of nowhere, after a week of avoiding him. He’s setting a precedent. Witnesses. If his father asks, they are fighting. Like they normally do. But Harry could feel it, hear it in the words, he doesn’t want to.
The reactions were mixed, as half the french school cheered for the girl, and the other half cried over not being chosen. The boys from all schools seemed to be excited no matter what. Not all boys. Ron was. Hermione smirked and shook her head as Harry held Ron down, keeping him from some involuntary reaction that seemed to have taken over many of the boys. Harry looked around and almost picked up the pattern regarding the boys that weren’t affected, but in the end he looked at Hermione as she whispered, “Gay. The Veela charm won’t affect you.” Harry ‘oh’ed as he finally understood what was going on with Ron and immediately tried to find Malfoy to see if it was affecting him too.
He got the whole arm thing down. He could twirl the both of them. He could dip, twirl and shuffle, but moving from the spot he’d begun in? Nope. Not a chance. He either took too big of a step, or too small, or not the right direction, or speed, or he lacked synchronization.
“My name is Moody. Alastor Moody. I’m not here to make friends or to make you feel better, I’m here because Dumbledore asked me to.”
The three remained in silence until Hermione realized they were not remembering the details that were screaming at her inside her mind, “Guys!”
Ron paused, a smile still on his face as he absorbed and tried to make sense of what Harry had just told him. Then he remembered what Draco had said and all the pieces fell together as Ron’s smile fell apart, “He doesn’t care.”
Harry didn’t react physically, but his gut told him to leave. Be smarter than Neville and save yourself the trauma, leave.
Ron shrugged, looking at Hermione with the peace of a promise made at birth, that no matter what got in between, at the end of the story it would be them together, a trust of each other placed in the souls at birth, “If she wants to experiment and play the field a bit I wouldn’t really care. It’s me at the end of her nights, just like no matter what it will be her at the end of mine.”
Ron and Harry shared a confused look before turning to Hermione, Harry sighed, “Can we share your epiphany?”
“Harry, if you glare any harder the poor boy might alight in flames.” He heard what Hermione said, but saw nothing wrong with it.
When Harry woke up he looked around to see it was still dark, if not darker, and Ron had let exhaustion take him down. His heart twisted at Ron sleeping, curtain open, body half out of bed, head facing him as though he had been guarding Harry until he fell asleep. Harry got up and pushed him back onto his bed, covering him up and closing the curtains, “Thanks, mate.”
Draco just groaned and headed to the Slytherin entrance, muttered the password, and disappeared behind the stone wall.
Draco saw the realization arrive in Harry’s eyes, glared at him and walked away. A part of Harry wanted to laugh, he was so fucking slow sometimes. He went back to his table with Ron and Hermione, dropped everything nonchalantly, to Hermione’s annoyance, and unfolded the note;
Harry looked up to see it was now Draco who’d yet to open his eyes, confusion and fear adorning his face. He shook his head, “That doesn’t make sense either.”
After asserting his dominance and intimidating all the students he asked if any knew about some unforgivable curses, to which immediately, Hermione raised her arm.
“What? Nobody-” Draco tried to continue lying, but a look at his reflection on the dark window showed that his disguise had fallen, and a new set of panic settled in Draco. Draco reached up and touched his bruised cheek and then decided pride was going to be his tool of defense, “Why do you care? This is none of your business!”
“I’m still getting used to the idea of Lefty being… Lefty. And even if I had become used to it… Harry, you know well I’m the last person who’s ever going to understand what’s going on inside… Lefty’s head. But I’ll be here for you for anything else.”
Malfoy was having a quiet conversation with Parkison and Zabini. They were laughing, quietly, and in that moment Harry wanted nothing more than for everyone to shut so he could hear his laughter. His quiet laughter. How he expressed joy in the intimate private moments. How would his quiet laughter sound like at two in the morning after a long night of drinks, snacks and a little bit of fun-
“There’s always a tone of unfinished sentences whenever you talk about him, about getting me out of there…” Harry blinked, unaware at how good at perceiving secrets Draco was, “Like you know more than you’re letting on.”
Harry stared at Ron for a few seconds before shaking his head, “Later. For now let’s do as Hermione said and enjoy the game.”
Draco was quiet and his eyes analytical, but his breathing labored. He looked down at their joined hands in Harry’s lap then back up to Harry’s eyes and slowly, he nodded. “I’ll talk to my mother. I will try to coerce her as vaguely as possible so as to not freak her out…” He whispered, barely audible.
Pity adorned Draco’s face, and through the corner of his eye he glanced at Harry who was grimacing at the floor.
Harry shook Draco awake, hating himself while doing it, but acutely aware that the sun was past sunrise and they had to be close to the end of breakfast.
Harry had nothing to say, but his eyes spoke of a new fear he never believed possible, of loving too much to the point of possessive insanity.
“I opened it, it screamed. I attacked it, it screamed. I did every spell I know, it screamed. I leave it alone, it screams in my head. What else should I do?”
Hermione waved her hand, dismissing his dismissal, “You need to figure out the egg. So instead of seething with rage at the realization that other people find… Lefty attractive, how about you figure out the egg?”
The first burst happen and an explosion of gasps followed it, no one knowing exactly what was supposed to happen, but satisfied something had happened. Dumbledore reached up, grabbing the burnt scrap of paper, examining it for a few seconds before calling out, “The champion for Durmstrang will be… Viktor Krum.”
Draco was quiet for much longer than Harry would’ve preferred, but at the end, “I don’t know. It’s a cruel day when you realized you’ve never had opinions of your own.” Draco turned to Harry and smiled, “I guess you're in a position to help me create an opinion on the matter.” Harry smiled in return.
When alone in his room at the Dursley, he would wonder how this whole soulmate/enemy-bond came to be and who even decided who was whose what. He liked to believe there was some powerful being beyond their reach who would assign these things, and sometimes… they would get bored.
Harry opened his eyes. . . Entirely unprompted. No one woke him up. It wasn’t morning. Why was he awake?
Ron didn’t look up from his cauldron, really interested in how it’s content seemed to be getting darker by the second. Hermione paused for a second, and then shrugged, accepting Harry’s word. When Hermione turned to read further instructions Harry turned to look at Ron, the question in his eyes. Ron barely smiled and shrugged.
“Ninety percent of the time he wasn’t even talking to you! He was trying to get Harry’s attention the only way he knows how.” Hermione yelled back at Ron, turning to look at the campsite, “I don’t think his parents are a great influence, and when the book you’re reading to learn how to live has all the wrong instructions, what else can you do but fail…”
Draco wasn’t there for breakfast, lunch or any of the morning classes. By the time Potions came Harry had convinced himself Draco was going to avoid him all together. And he knew it was him he was avoiding. Hermione said Draco had gone to Arithmancy.
When Draco was done with his silent speech, he pulled back, forehead leaning on Harry’s, eyes closed as a deep sigh escaped him, “I liked it better when I was blind.”
Sitting in the classroom, waiting for a late professor, Harry snuck one look at Malfoy, faking to be paying attention to what Ron was saying, probably something about how unfair the Quidditch World Cup was with Bulgaria.
The three seniors remained quiet as Dumbledore and the other professors and headmasters questioned his being in the tournament, Harry insisting over and over that he didn’t put his name in the goblet of fire, that that was not his penmanship, that he does not have a death wish.
Draco was about to fight him on it when they both froze at the sound of Filch opening a classroom nearby. In a haste Harry grabbed Draco and dragged him out of the underneath the cloak, covering his mouth as he tried to comment on it.
Dumbledore nodded, watching the young quidditch player disappear in the back, in some room where they were going to be informed about what exactly being a champion was going to entail. After he disappeared they all waited, watching for another bursts of sparks and another name to be announced. They all hoped otherwise but when it came, they all still flinched, not expecting it still. Dumbledore didn’t seem to notice, reaching up and once again adding unnecessary tension as he slowly read the name on the delicate burnt paper. He looked at the Ravenclaw table with all the students from Beauxbaton, “The champion for Beauxbaton will be… Fleur Delacour.”
And yes, I will keep delving into the subject of domestic and child abuse in rich, misogynistic families and how it is an endless cycle of abuse to make an abuser. I will address the gas-lighting that Narcissa must have suffered, (much more intense than the one Draco had), the Stockholm syndrome and the traumas from it. And also the toxic behaviour of an abuser who doesn't know when to quit. I will have added these trigger warnings in the tags by the time you read this (most likely), but here's a reminder that it might get more... trigger inducing.
Harry opened his eyes as Draco leaned back, eyes glaring at the ground as he quoted something his mother probably repeated to him, to herself many times after bad evenings with Lucius, “He’s seeing the bigger picture. It’s for our own benefit. He’s doing this because he cares. It’s his way of showing it.”
Harry nodded, “But… people don’t hide both. Is not normal, but it is known of people hiding one wrist, but both? That’s not a thing.”
Harry opened his mouth to say tired, before realizing Ron was staring at him from his bed, “Better. Could be much better, but good for now.”
Draco shook his head, and tried to continue back into their dorm with his crew when Harry pulled again. Draco turned around, looking ready to punch someone but not finding anything. Parkinson sighed, “Honey, you’re stressed, you’re probably imagining things.”
Harry turned to look at Draco, deciding to take the initiative and grab his hand. Draco didn’t pull back, “Can I be bold?”
Well… that could have gone… Nope, went as well as it could with both their personalities to consider.
Fear that addressing Lucius would warrant a worse punishment for Draco. Fear that his actions would have drastics consequences. Disgust at knowing the right move right now was to not do anything until they had the advantage and Lucius had no way of making the situation worse. And that’s how he found himself, two classrooms away, ears searching desperately for the sound of a door opening and a tall man walking away so that he could rush in and pick up the pieces of Lucius misdeeds.
The trio stood frozen, watching everyone run past them far away from danger. They couldn’t see what caused it, they couldn’t see where it started.
Both Harry and Draco stood there in shocked silence as both contemplated the next few seconds. Draco in silent horror as Harry’s hand covered a gruesome truth. Harry in wonder and frustration, knowing that to gain his trust he would have to ignore the wonderful opportunity in the palm of his hand.
“I’m not sure. Sometimes it felt like I fell asleep for hours when it was just minutes, sometimes it felt like simply slept for two minutes and you’d wake me up and it was morning. Probably the worst was when I’d wake up every thirty minutes or so. It would take me so long to go back to sleep, and I would still lie to myself that I’d had a proper sleep when I didn’t. But I can’t control it.”
Draco looked down, seeing both of his own wrists in Harry’s hand, no name visible. Two names visible. Draco shook his head, “Tom Riddle?” Draco looked up to see Harry staring at him, “And you made the bold assumption that I’m your soulmate? What if it’s this Tom guy?”
Mid thought Harry stopped, mouth half open to express his distaste for history, but a question came to mind. “Do-... Do you think we’re going to have another war?”
He sighed, “Greed is a very vague word. But it could be said it is the root of evil. You-know-who did what he did due to his greed for power and authority. My father did… maybe even does, but did what he did for the same reasons. My mother married my father in her greed for protection and a life of very little worries… Oh how disappointed she must be. I-...”
An hour later, both laying on the edge of the balcony at the Astronomy tower, legs dangling off the edge as they stared at the mess of stars in the sky, was when Harry remembered what they had been discussing prior to getting off topic.
“During second year everyone believed me to be a better, if not the only contender to be the Heir of Slytherin. They had no idea and they still managed to nail some facts in the head.” Harry looked away ashamed, “I had to beg the hat to not sort me into Slytherin.”
“It is. You tell me you’re ready to leave that bastard you call father behind and I could have every professor in this school looking for a safe house for you and your mom in a matter of minutes. You’d have a new home before your father even realized you were leaving.”
The trio had to rush breakfast and barely made it to class. Barely. Hermione would have murdered them both if they hadn’t.
Harry felt himself nodding, looking at the very confused expression on Draco’s face. A smile broke through his own face as his hand reached for the boy’s neck to pull him back in.
“Your father beating you is a big deal, Draco.” Draco glared at him, “Malfoy?” Draco nodded, and Harry sighed, “I can make sure she keeps it under wraps. Only those that need to know get to know.” He smiled at Draco, “Need-to-know basis until the Yule Ball?”
Molly nodded, “I still don’t know how I’m going to tell Arthur. He sees them as a whole. One brain, three bodies, all rotting the world.”
Cruel, but Harry’s lived his whole life in the center of Cruel Town. They were thinking of making him the mayor…
“Yup, I don’t know how, but … I guess I’ll wing it like everything else,” Harry piped in, staring grim and ending more cheerful than he felt. He guessed he was counting on his dumb luck getting him out of this one in one piece.
Harry now paused, contemplating whether to tell Draco he’d told Ron, then deciding too many people mistreat Draco and he didn’t want to be another one on the list, “Ron-”
“Ah, and he finally says what he pulled me aside for, Inside Information. You want me to rat out all my friends?” There was a teasing tone, and Harry knew that Draco knew that wasn’t Harry’s goal. But Draco wanted it to be. Because the real one caused him panic.
After staring at a few students, Moody finally picked a kid when Neville raised his hand, “Yes, boy?”
Harry nodded and began to run back to the Gryffindor tower before bumping into an angry looking Hermione and a tired looking Ron. They had his robes. Hermione handed them to him and walked away, Ron shrugging and pulling Harry along, “She was worried looking for you. You know she doesn’t like to be late.”
Sitting back on his bed, his feet bumped into the discarded package and curiosity rose. Harry picked it up, settling it on his bed, closing the curtains and sitting crossed legged, glaring at it as though that would make it reveal what was inside. It didn’t. Finally Harry sighed and ripped it open.
Harry was getting too used to this dumps of baffling information from Draco. Harry had been given the impression that Neville was an orphan like him, due to him living with his grandmother. But Draco has not said the word kill once when referring to the ‘attack’ on the Longbottoms. “And your father told you all of this?”
Harry turned to where Malfoy had been staring at to find Lucius Malfoy, glaring at him, looking disgusted by Harry’s mere presence. And that’s when he realized how close to Malfoy he was standing. He moved away.
He looked at Percy, Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny loudly join their big family in a warm spectacle of love.
And Harry was going to reply, but then he noticed a yellow tinge on Draco’s left cheek. And out of nowhere, Harry’s need to tell Draco the truth became insignificant.
But only two minutes before class started, he waltzed in, no care in the world, and joined Zabini on a desk at the far back. Never looked at Harry, nothing.
Harry opened his mouth but nothing came out, though the quirk in his eyebrows let Draco know he was confused.
“Hey!” Hermione stopped Harry, looking excited for a moment, like she found an answer to any of the many problems on their plate, “You want a distraction?”
Ron kept looking at Draco while Hermione took notes and Harry sulked in his misery. What were they supposed to do today? Who knows, but the wood of their table is beginning to chip away. How often do they change these tables? With all the accidents students have… it should be a lot.
Harry turned to look at Draco whose face was blank. Harry slowly grabbed them, unsure of what was going on. Apparently Harry did not grab it right because Draco groaned, grabbed Harry’s hand and forced the Dried Nettles and the piece of paper holding- OH!
After dinner and after a nice warm and relaxing shower, Harry laid in bed, wondering if Viktor, or anyone else for that matter, became a threat to his mission… what would he do?
“Nothing. What do you want to eat? If you want I could go downstairs and ask for a proper meal for you.”
“With the Gryffindors being such pricks about Potter’s win, there’s a chance we could get the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaw to rank against him-”
Harry sat up, having slept basically nothing and still feeling refreshed and ready for a rowdy day of magical creatures and awkward glances, “Well, I have a blond to make uncomfortable today, so if you don’t mind.”
Harry was now determined to fix that. Next year. Now he had to go to the Dursleys and have a god awful summer by their side.
Harry was not ready to go back to his room and begin overthinking the fact that Lucius beats his son. He’d rather sit here and talk mindlessly with him.
“I’m not going to enter screaming ‘look, I’m dancing with Draco Malfoy. Everyone look’. We’ll just do our own thing.”
Hermione shook her head, wrapping her head around Harry’s fuck up, “What would Lu- Sorry, Lefty Senior, what would he do to Dr- LEFTY! With seeing your wrist? Is your-... What- Oh my-!”
Harry didn’t add anything to the conversation and after a few more moments of Harry’s silence they continued walking.
The first thing that happened when he left the tent was that the sun… blinded him. Not good. The second thing thing that happened was his eyes adjusting to the sun and immediately noticing its glow on a particularly blond head, that tried to hide in the crowd. Not good either, since all of these things distracted him from the FUCKING DRAGON!
Harry sneaked a look at the dragon, seeing it waiting for him. And involuntarily, Harry’s eyes found Draco again, hidden at the back of the Slytherin seats, covered in a thick scarf and a worried look as he, like everyone else wondered if this was the moment Harry died. And Harry did not like that look on Malfoy’s face. And so after dodging two more blows from a dragon that danced around the stadium looking to burn him, he finally acciod broom, hoping that him being in the air would give him an advantage, and that the chains on that dragon were strong.
Standing there listening to the magical silence Harry could understand why many people would devoid themselves of feeling love. This… sucks. Your emotional well being depending on someone else sucks. The disgust and self-hatred you feel at failing to rescue them on time sucks. The waiting sucks.
He let go in a rush and glared at his own hands in shame, wondering if there were fates that one simply could not run away from. “I’m sorry.”
It took a few seconds for it to sink in before Draco began to look horrified, “So much for secrets.”
He shrugged, “Everyone knew who the Potters were. At least they were popular names with the Deatheaters. Pain in the arse is what my father seemed to refer them as, along with many other Deatheaters.” Draco gave a small smile in return to Harry’s prideful joy at hearing that his parents had given Voldermort’s army a run for their money. “It wasn’t common knowledge though that he was hunting them, you, down. Only the inner circle knew, and even then it was a select few. My aunt Bellatrix- She was- is probably still a Deatheater. She’s now in Azkaban. She helped at… hurting the-” Draco choked, and breathed in and out a few times before he gathered the courage to say, “She helped or was mostly responsible for hurting the Longbottoms.”
“If life was that easy… Ugh.” Harry didn’t know how to finish that sentence, he didn’t know if he would ever know how to finish that sentence. He doesn’t know what easy is.
“Harry, we’re four years in. How much clearer do we have to make it that we’ll go to the end of the world with you? Just like how you would for me, for Hermione, for my family, for the school. You may not realize it, but you’ve done so much already, and had so much done to you. It’s okay to rely on others.”
Another intake of air, a longer silence, “... Fine. I’m sorry for encouraging the whole dementor fiasco.” He sounded indignant.
“Wh- What- What… Hey, buddy!” Ron stuttered over what to say before remembering Harry was still on health watch.
That didn’t stop Harry from blatantly trying to steal glances every now and then, only to be interrupted by an elbow from Ron and a quiet ‘You’re being too obvious!’.
Ron looked a bit proud as he turned to Hermione and announced, “I figured out why Harry’s so stingy about Malfoy.”
“I’ve gotten nothing out of hiding it. Nothing bad!” Harry smiled, “But nothing good. Just a limbo of nothingness where I never taken step forward or backwards- No, I’ve taken a few steps backwards. But never forward.”
Hermione sighed and Harry turned to look at them. Harry wondered if either of them realize that they’ve taken the role of his fill-in parents, their smiles tender as they watched their boy finally get a glimpse of joy. Harry shrugged.
Draco sighed and turned back to staring at the sky. If he was still figuring out his plan, he was doing it in his head.
Harry looked at Ron, who shrugged, “He’s moved and adjusted himself a few times in his sleep… His movement is stiff. Like his favoring a bruised muscle or an injured… body part… Couldn’t pinpoint where exactly Lucius hit him.”
And Harry wanted to go back and ask again, try to show him that they are meant to be and just skip the whole prologue. But Dream Draco kept him still. According to Dream Draco, if Harry makes the first move, Draco might- will say yes which… FUCK YES! But, if he says yes, someone will tell Malfoy Senior and Draco will get a beating. Because Lucius doesn’t want Draco to be with Harry. And Lucius will all but kill his son to prevent that.
When Harry returned to his room at the crack of dawn he had no answers, just bruised lips and two angry looking friends waiting for him in the common room.
“He doesn’t have any legit form of confirmation on the matter. We can vouch for Harry but we’re biased. Dumbledore, McGonnagal and every adult on campus can vouch for Harry, but most are biased due to either pity of what happened to him, fear of what he could become or apprehension that he could become someone powerful in the future and they don’t want to hurt these connections. Many students here could vouch for Harry and it’d be fake because no one outside of us and your family know him as well as we do.” Hermione turned to look at Harry.
Draco was quiet for a long time before he finally replied, “There’s bound to be someone out here or in the Slytherin dorms who know I’m talking to you…”
“Lefty’s dad was here last night.” Harry didn’t look away from Ron or Hermione, but was incredibly aware that people were stalling, wanting gossip on Harry… so … Lefty. “He looked annoyed about me being there. Lefty didn’t look happy.”
“Do you think your name’s on his wrist? Or are you eternally destined to want him but never get him?” Her smile made sense now, it was pitiful as that of a mother who was bracing to hold her wounded child in her arms and help him heal the pain away. She wasn’t wrong. It’s pretty rare, but just like with the enemy-bond, there have been people whose signatures are on multiple people’s wrist. It’s either a sign of unrequited love or that one of the suitors is… not going to make it. It’s cruel. Some people think those originated from a curse. No one’s really sure.
“All I could think is… ‘Great. Another person who’s going to hurt you, and you are going to foolishly enough let them do it. Because you’re so desperate to have anyone love you, that you’ll take it wherever you can get it.’”
Harry smiled and nodded, not pointing out the obvious betrayal sitting right there in the empty classroom, “My father, Sirius, Remus and Peter had been friends since their first year of Hogwarts.”
“I knew he was controlling me. Manipulating me…” He sighed, seeming irritated with the next words, “Conditioning me… But I kept telling myself the same lie mum tells herself.”
Harry paused, confused, before smiling tenderly at Hermione, “Of course! I mean… thanks for asking for permission, unlike some other people-”
Harry jumped out of the fire’s way and hid behind rocks, wondering if this was it, what it would all amount to, a dumb competition and his charred body in the grasp of a dragon.
Harry nodded, bitterly smiling, “Kind of like how I remember how my parents died but that shouldn’t be possible because I was too young to be creating such vivid memories.”
“You told Harry to cheat.” Ron leaned forward, forcing Harry to lean back as Ron did everything possible to not allow Hermione to look away from him.
A/N: I’ve never read Hogwarts a history, so I don’t know if it tells the story of how the castle came to be, and I recognize that I can just wiki it. But after wiki-ing the timeline of Arthur, James Sr and Lucius regarding their times at Hogwarts, I just simply decided its more fun to create my own canon regarding Hogwarts and its founding and life before it.
And Harry himself paused to think. He said it because in a way he understood… but he’s never really stopped to think about it. And Hermione warned him about it too.
Harry shook his head, one step forward, “That last thing I want is for you to get hurt. I’m trying to prevent that.” Draco’s left hand softly landed on his chest, feeling like a caress but really it was his new attempt at keeping Harry a fair distance away.
Another chuckle escaped him and he shook his head, “I don’t want to laugh tonight. I want to address some very serious matters.”
Neville looked baffled, before glancing behind Harry for a second and calming down, shrugging as he settled in bed, taking his shoes off, “The Fat Lady would not have been so nonchalant about it. She’s supposed to protect us.”
Harry’s gaze followed them as he incredulous asked, “Did she say ‘magically brewed’? Does that count as a pun-”
He pondered the possibility of Lucius Malfoy being a death-eater, and the possibility that he may have dragged his son with him. He tried to move back towards the campsite when Ron joined Neville in pulling him away.
Molly nodded, “Also be careful with the tasks. And have fun at the ball.” She finished, with a kiss on his forehead and a tight hug that spoke of a need to never let go of her children, and a sadness in having to do so. A sadness Harry knew of. She herself told him about it in one of the futures. Harry smiled and hugged her back.
Arthur nodded and joined in on the nervous laughter, “Yeah, and he almost got it. I bet you he was paying off the minister.”
“Really? They’re just talking, what’s wrong with that?” Ron was blatantly looking at their target, on the other hand.
Harry and Ron silently flinched, wondering why Hermione sometimes had to be a bit more annoying than she needed to be. As Hermione opened her mouth to further on argue, Harry covered her mouth, rolling his eyes and pulled her away towards the dorms. When they reached the stairs to the boys dorms Hermione pushed Harry’s hand away and huffed. “Why? I was putting him in his place.”
An edge of douchebaggery climbed up Harry’s throat as he itched to reply with a prickly ‘why do you care?’, so he took a breather. “Bad life.”
Hermione huffed at Ron, “Malfoy is like a deer if this past few weeks are any proof of it. You need to approach it slowly and apprehensively or you scare it away. And that’s exactly what you did Harry. You scared him away. Now how am I gonna fix this fuck up?”
Hermione shrugged at Ron, “It kind of sounds like he’s just making sure you haven’t forgotten about him, like ‘eh, I’m here. Don’t forget’. You get me?”
Harry nodded, looking at Draco, watching how the shadows moved on his face, “I don’t think we’re going there with or without greed.”
Harry paused, turning around to find Draco still frozen, staring at the spot Harry had just been in.
Draco shook his head, not in response, but as though clearing his head, and stood up, entering the shelter of the tower. “Just lost in thought.”
Ron shrugged, “If there’s anything I’ve learned from you passing out is that anyone can fake it. Try code.”
He sighed internally, finishing the knot and looking at the door between them, “How much did you see?”
He knew of the Ravenclaw girl with the weird earrings because Ginny had introduced her to her brothers as the girl on her wrist. They made fun of it for a while before taking a good look at them and realizing that Luna Lovegood was perfect for Ginny Weasley. Lovegood had some 30-year-old reporter that her father was in a feud on her opposing wrist, and Ginny had someone named Cain, or so he believed.
“Yes you can,” Harry smiled and took his hand, “There are people who would gladly take you in and help you simply because they would respect your for defecting from … death-”
Harry nodded, “And you kept making things difficult with Ron and Hermione. And generally they are attached to me by the hip.”
Though three hours into dance lessons Harry was beginning to consider if he had some sort of attention deficit. He was becoming extremely aware that Hermione had been constantly dragging Ron and his attention back to the lessons, in some cases literally dragging Harry back to the lessons. He figured after stepping on Hermione’s feet for half an hour she would relent and let him leave this infernal lesson, but regardless, it’s been three hours now and both Ron and Hermione were determined to break Harry.
“The only way he can assure himself you can be trusted and it is okay to be with you is by jumping head first into the deep end and hoping he didn’t make a mistake.”
But Harry now understood why Draco was so determined to introduce himself during first year. Imagine growing up seeing this name on your wrist and knowing who it was and that soon you were going to meet them…
Harry truly believed the conversation was over, walked away to another bench to appreciate the empty silence, when he muttered, “I’m not sure.”
“What’s going on!?” He was panicked, out of breath, and he could definitely feel the smoke had reached them by the pain in his lungs.
“I know,” Ron shrugged as he got up, dropping the invisibility cloak on Harry’s lap, “Mom replied. She’ll come visit this weekend.”
Molly shook her head, “The elitist, high-class, Pure-blooded families usually show off their newborn children with parties and newspapers clipping. It was odd from the beginning, but-...” She looked at Harry, facing a guilt she’s denied feeling for years, “But we all lied to ourselves and pretended it was normal, so none of us would have to be the one to deal with it. The rotting spread so much we became a part of it. And it shames me to even admit this, but that’s why I’m helping. Because I became part of the problem I criticize so much. Nothing I do now will ever make up for turning a blind-eye to the signs of an abused child, but I should at least make an effort.”
Draco looked behind him frantically, looking for something that wasn’t there. Parkinson looked understandably confused, “What is it Draco?”
Harry stared. Cheers going all around, but silence filling the room as Malfoy turned to look at his table and found him staring. He didn’t turn away. Malfoy looked down for a second, as though deciding how to continue forward, deciding one satisfied smile was an appropriate response for the situation. Harry wondered was Malfoy was thinking, and if it had to do with him. The school sat down confused, but Harry didn’t care as Malfoy raised his eyebrows and motioned towards the goblet, almost like he was asking him if he was happy that Diggory had been chosen. In part… yes. He was.
Harry told Hermione the truth, “I think I am… But I’m not one hundred percent sure if I mean the same thing to him as he does to me.” AKA… unrequited love. It’s horrible, but when it happens, it means that the person who was assigned as your soulmate, to them you were assigned as their enemy.
He shrugged, picking at his tie, noticing the red getting discolored, “How the more time I spent in the wizarding community the more complicated my life gets… and the less time there is between each special event.”
Her tone showed clearly how she wasn’t going to take any bullshit from either of them, “You both have until we reach the box to talk it out and get over whatever drama you both have magically brewed up. We are here to have a nice evening as friends and family and you’re awkward mood is ruining it for all of us.”
Draco nodded, and after a few minutes of silence he extended his arm, reaching for Harry’s hand. And in a bit of overly-eager excitement, Harry nearly ran to place his hand in Draco’s. Draco didn’t say anything about it, but the blush of embarrassment did not leave Harry’s cheeks regardless. Harry had expected Draco to look for a specific hand, looking for a wrist or something. Not Draco simply wanting emotional support. Regardless, he didn’t complain, simply sitting next to the boy to enjoy the sun creeping in through crevices and broken walls and pillars, shining on the few gems scalpers weren’t able to steal from the young Helena.
Side note, don't know if this demographic even watches this show, but I'm really tempted to make a fic about Sabrina, post season 3. (with Caliban and Nick)... Uhm, let me know your opinion?
He turned to look at Ron who was now staring at Draco, analyzing him, and then muttered under his breath, “... It is odd… his behavior. You would think he would be bragging, or… I don’t know, be annoying like he always is when he’s trying to get your atten- Oh! That’s what he’s doing… It’s still a dumb way to do it, I mean-”
Harry only realized he was also crying when he heard himself sniffle as he reached the boy sitting beaten on the floor. He knelt down and sighed, “You know that’s not what this is.”
The tone of the class died down, and it died hard. The remains were burned and the ashes were burned again. Not one said a word, no sound. Just the sound of a spider squirming and silently begging for it’s life. Ron may hate spiders but even he looked terribly uncomfortable.
Ron sighed, pulling the broken quill out of Harry’s hand. “At least try to pretend you’re not jealous and that you
“If he can’t solve the Lefty issue now, he should at least feel like he can win at something else. He already cheated. He helped Diggory cheat. Without cheating Harry wouldn’t be alive. Cheating is the only way he will be able to survive this fucking tournament!”
Hermione shook her head, climbed off the bed and sat next to Ron, “You are new territory that he’s scared to venture to, and his family, however shitty and evil they may be,
Hermione lightly grabbed Harry’s forearm and quietly warned, “Malfoy did insult the hippogriff, Harry.”
Harry waited outside the Slytherin dorms under his invisibility cloak, his map telling him Malfoy had yet to return, but was on his way, flanked by Parkinson and Zabini… Slowly.
The girls all seemed to calm down as Delacour finally left and the boys all sat down. And the tension grew, as now every student in Hogwarts waited.
Draco looked down at his left wrist, and Harry smiled, knowing he deserved it, “You hide one of yours.”
Malfoy took a few deep breaths before he finally replied, “He didn’t teach it to me. But I know I learned it from him… My mother would never use any of those curses. I just don’t know how I know.”
Harry shook his head, he’s been forced to ingest enough things for one day. What if… What if in the first challenge he had to fight the other champions? They would destroy him, they clearly are more skilled than he was.
Hermione’s relaxed smile didn’t give anything away, but to Harry her nod felt like she was saying ‘I knew it’. After staring at it for like a minute, rubbing her thumb over it like a mother to a wound, she looked up at Harry and asked the question he’d been avoiding ever since he found out about Tom Riddle.
Oh how exquisite it was to see the transparent expressions crossing Draco’s face. Bafflement, insult, exasperation, shock, and finally disbelief. “No.”
The awkwardness was temporarily gone, replaced by undeniable joy that was soon interrupted by a disgusted groan from a newcomer.
Malfoy sighed, the frown on his face and his nod of acceptance making it known to Harry that he believed him. And an inch of the weight fell off.
“It appears as though… someone stole it? And used it to cast the Mosmorde charm. I had to explain far too many times that it would have been impossible for Harry to perform the charm, not just because of what it means, but because how would he even-”
“It’s not your fault. You now know what’s going on and what’s making you so short-tempered. And I’m sure by now Lefty has heard about it. Try again. If he hasn’t heard about it, tell hi- FUCK, LEFTY!”
Harry got up early the next morning, hoping to get to breakfast without too much of a crowd, at least, that’s what he was gonna tell Hermione.
After scaring a few students and explaining just why that's a ‘Unforgivable’, he moved on and asked for another one, and Harry was beginning to feel sick. Harry understood in great detail just how horrible it could be to not be in control of yourself, your life, your destiny. And there was a spell for it. And that was the least bad of all the curses. Harry felt physically sick, and wished he was also mentally gone.
Ron raised a hand with an amused look on his face, “You’re going to come a little strong if you drop all of that on them. Also,” Ron turned to Harry and shrugged, “We have DADA today. We get to meet… the new teacher.”
Harry sat up, and looked for the map. Immediate disappointment riddled him to find Draco in his room, casually sleeping, unaware of how much worse can it get for him. And it can get worse… the question is, would a few small sacrifices now save him? Harry hated himself for thinking this, but would letting Draco get a few beatings now prevent him from dying, or getting nearly beheaded?
Harry didn’t want disciples waiting on his every word and faltering for his approval. What he wanted from the Weasleys was a family, and seeing them do this irritated him.
Fucking Lucius. If it wasn’t for him he’d be pushing all of them away and asking Draco out himself. Make it as public as possible. Hermione joked in History class that Harry just wanted to mark ‘his’ territory. Fuck it if she was right. Fuck it if he was territorial. Fuck what people thought.
The boy ignored Ron as he glared at Hermione, “How did you do it? If anyone would have figured out a way to get past Dumbledore it would be you.”
He shrugged, “He doesn’t want to be paraded in, he has enough going on in his life. I need a decoy. Just for the annoying first part. And from my understanding, third years can’t go to the ball.”
Harry went to grab Draco’s hand, but instead found his hands in Draco’s grip as he flipped them over on his lap and traced the lines of his palm, “When you didn’t let go last night, and tighten your grip until it bruised-”
Malfoy looked up for a second, nodding again, his eyes shining a warm silver in the candlelights. Why were the candles still on?
When the sun disappeared and the only source of light were the Lumos that the boys procured to be able to see past their noses, Draco had laid his head on Harry’s shoulder and finally breached the subject of Mrs. Weasley and his family affair. The request bothered Draco, but after a few minutes of explaining and convincing, he understood how rare and unachievable it is to catch Narcissa without Lucius. As they left the garden, Draco promised that before bed he would go to the owlery with a letter for his mother.
Harry nodded and she shrugged, “Don’t worry. I don’t care about the rumours. They are better than the ones that came from accepting being your date, which included me sleeping my way to the top and betraying Luna. This is better and funnier.”
Harry turned to Draco, confused but tamed enough to be reluctant about asking, “Why is that not in Hogwarts: A History?”
Ron sighed and shook his head, “I’m not looking for any excuse to drop him, but anyone who’s ashamed to be seen in public with you is not good for you-”
Harry nodded, “And Lockhart is a Ravenclaw. And instead he cheated and stole other people’s stories to become famous. And you are a Slytherin and yet here you are conspiring with an age-old enemy of the snakes, a Gryffindor. And-” Harry smirked, eyes closing in on Draco, wanting to savour his reaction, “I was primarily going to be sorted into Slytherin. But here I am, wearing red.”
“It was a long boring day of school today. And I had enough time to do… to see that infamous ‘bigger picture’. He thinks You-know-who is going to come back someday.” Harry internally flinched, knowing it was true. Draco sighed and continued, “He hopes he does. And if he does… he wants to be ‘on the right-side of history’ with those-... deatheaters.” Draco nodded, as though saying it outloud helped solidify it as truth, “He was the first to denounce himself of being one when-” Draco paused, and Harry knew why as he smiled and nodded.
Harry shrugged and muttered, “Don’t they think the gays are Satan's way of luring innocent men to hell?”
Draco looked frustrated and it looked like it had more to do with the tear that escaped than Harry’s insistence, but Harry was a close second, “This is none of your damn fucking business!”
Harry stared, unsure of how to react, a frown on his face as he looked from Ron to Hermione who was frozen by the door, mouth hanging open. “O-... Ok.”
“Like I’m not a big fan of school, but there is something important to learn from our history. We wizards and witches have a rich history, and for it to be completely disregarded in school due to us having just about the most BORING professor we could have been cursed with- You know who would have made that class more interesting? Lupin! DADA was amazing last year. I’ve never wanted to learn more-”
Draco pulled his hands away but never out of reach and that’s how Harry knew he was just playing with him, not really pushing him away, “What, are you such a gryffindor that you have to do everything in packs?”
He heard them call for him, but he ignored them all and left. They seemed to either think this wasn’t such a bad idea, since they didn’t chase after him.
What did Harry learn? Draco is a heavy sleeper and a slow waker, because even having said that, Draco just closed his eyes and laid his head back down on Harry’s shoulder, huddling closer to Harry’s warmth. Harry sighed again, struggling to find that damn will to do this, “Malfoy.”
Walking out of class he found himself trying to focus on the loud banter of every student in the midst of class change, and ignore the loud whispers from Ron and Hermione who were trying to save what was left of his dignity.
“I don’t mean be my date, I mean, take my place as champion and do the stupid dance for me. I. Don’t. Dance.” Harry’s eyes had a clear desperation behind it.
The look of baffling joy that spread across her face was something, and it had a bit of mockery to it, “It’s odd, but apparently being dumped by you is a great way to boost your popularity! Much more if I was dumped for a boy. They pity me.”
He took a few bites of food, picked up his invisibility cloak and the map and left the dorm, needing space for the million thoughts racing through his head. Now awake Harry wondered once again if it was real, or if he just had a very active imagination. And halfway to the Astronomy Tower he remembered the second question. When did I ask you to the Yule ball? How did it go like? When did Lucius beat you?
Dean shook his head, “Name or no bet, Parvati. You can’t just bet on a house. I’m okay with you guys betting other houses, but names or no bet.”
Eventually Dean grew annoyed and angrily stormed to the door, aggressively opening it by the sound of it and going off on the midnight visitor, “What the fuck! It’s one in the morning on exam night! We need to fucking rest! Take your knocking and shove it up your arse!”
Harry smiled at the way Draco’s cheeks seemed to push his eyes tighter and smaller when he smiled, when he laughed. He sighed, “I’m sorry for pushing too hard back then. That day.”
Hermione giggled and nodded, giving Harry a soft pat on his shoulder, “What is it? I promise I won’t tell any living or dead soul.”
“He should be waking up soon, when he does inform him that he’s been dismissed of both classes and here and that I expect him back here next year when quidditch starts up again. And not sooner.”
Harry smiled and grabbed Hermione’s hand from his shoulder, staring at it as he rubbed her hand that laid on his right, menacing hand, looking for the bold confidence he had when he ripped his bandage off for Ron. Finally he sighed as he slowly undid the messy wrap he had done earlier, letting Draco’s elegant signature shine off his wrist.
Hermione nodded, and continued up the boys dorm, most likely to dictate to them everything that had to do with the Triwizard Tournament. Harry both wanted to know… and to forget.
Draco glared at the ground before looking up and staring at Moody in the eyes with an edge of indifference. They stared at each other until finally, “The Imperious Curse.”
Draco eyed him, pulling his hands behind his back, turning to eye the exit, knowing he could easily leave and ignore Harry. It was simply a matter of honor. It didn’t mean he had to answer. He nodded, still eyeing the exit.
Harry didn’t know exactly what he meant or was referring to, so he stayed quiet, mimicking the beat at which Draco breathed.
Hermione rolled her eyes, “I still don’t know what spell or charm Dumbledore used on the goblet, and we can’t cheat our way into a tournament we’re already in. You meant ‘through this tournament’.”
Harry nodded, stood up and walked away to the Gryffindor table, repeating to himself in his mind over and over again, ‘I will not let Draco go to the Ministry, I will not let Draco go to the Ministry,” Ron and Hermione joined him soon, panicked and confused. Harry shrugged, ‘I will not let Draco go to the Mi-’... why did he need to go to the Ministry?
Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix LeStrange and her husband, Barty Crouch Jr, Peter Petigrew and Severus Snape. These were the people who knew his parents were being hunted down for murder, along with himself and did nothing to stop it. In some cases they even helped. These were the people he could never forgive or forget.
And then Harry looked at Ron, and at Hermione, and then for the first time ever he wondered just how intimate his friends had gotten with each other, if it happened, when did it happen and how did he miss it… Harry shook his head, “I had company.” And with that he entered his room, forcing the other two to remain quiet as their roommates went about dragging themselves awake and dressing themselves for class.
Draco stood up, rubbing his face and hair in panic and pacing around the room, muttering over and over, “Not today, not tonight, not so soon.”
He couldn’t help to notice the Malfoys standing tall and proud, with an unbreakable poker face as their son joined them, subtly blending into their cold demeanor.
“You two need to tell her to knock before coming in.” Dean warned, pointing a threatening finger at the both of them.
After coming back and getting dressed, whenever Harry tried to leave the room Ron would somehow come up with something Harry needed to check or confirm or anything just to keep him there until everyone left. And once everyone left Hermione pushed the curtain away and smirked at Harry, having had enough time to contemplate what may have happened. “So what did you and Malfoy talk about?”
“Have you looked at your face? If I didn’t know you any better I would have guessed you had a shag in the tower, but…” Ron gave him a once over and shrugged, “That doesn’t seem like something you would easily do.”
Molly shook her head and looked away, “We all ignored the rotting. I can’t fault Narcissa Malfoy for it. The signs were obvious from the beginning. No one saw the Malfoy kid until he was nine. Many were unsure if he even really existed. Some crazy people theorize that he’s not even the real one, that the real Malfoy heir had died for one reason or another and the Malfoys were just biding their time until they could get a replacement… Lucius kept him hidden for too long. And I remember mentioning it to Arhur, that I felt that it was far too strange the secrecy Lucius was keeping regarding his son.”
Harry looked up at her confused, because to be fair, ‘Mione and Ron should be the ones confused seeing as he never explained that whatever may or may not be happening between them had to be a secret. There was an undertone, but never explained.
Harry had just intended to distract himself up there while he waited for midnight to come… apparently Draco had intended to come up an hour early to prep himself up for whatever… he needed to say to Harry? So when Harry climbed the last of the stairs and found Draco muttering to himself, he accepted the glare that came soon after the announcing cough he gave.
Harry’s glare was now directed at the crowd, no one in particular, as Ron nodded and abashedly whispered, “I’ll be more quiet.”
Harry sighed and dropped dramatically on Neville’s bed, needing some space to think and talk about this. Harry smiled emphatically at the pages of notes adorning the ceiling of Neville’s bed, mixes of Herbology notes and scribbles of encouragement. He should give Neville a few more. “I don’t know. I asked him if he trusted me like ten times, each time he interrupted me, each one being better than the last. He saw my wrists, I respected him and didn’t see his. He rewarded me for that.” Harry sighed, a smile bruising his cheeks, “I don’t know.”
“June. If you want a timeline, then fucking June is when I realized things weren’t so black and white. June is when I decided to give you a chance.” He saw in Draco’s eyes as he contemplated what happened during that time and Harry decided to correct his vagueness, “June of second year. I personally discovered something that made me understand what was really going on. I tried last year to talk to you, but … you know…”
Both times now he’s expected Draco to pull back, push away, anything. Both times Draco has just stood there, letting Harry do with his lips whatever he pleased. Not pushing away, but not collaborating either. After a few seconds of this Harry pulled away, but not too far, his face, his lips always inches away, waiting. “You don’t have to tell anyone.” His whisper was barely audible in the storm.
Later that night, in the privacy of his four-poster bed, he lifted both his sleeves to look at his new enemy, Draco Malfoy, on his left wrist and his future husband, Tom Riddle, on his right wrist. He felt, maybe, a little better, now that there was less guessing.
Draco, on the other hand, kept getting louder and more panicked with every question, “What are you implying about yourself?”
“Ouch” Harry looked towards Hermione who had pinched his forearm and was handing him a piece of paper.
Ron looked confused and baffled, not understanding why Harry would stop them from talking ill of Malfoy, not seeing what was wrong with adding lies to an already bad situation. He even looked at bit betrayed as Harry’s comment echoed in the silent forest, discrediting Ron over and over again.
Hermione huffed and began going up to the boy’s dorm, “We’ve had a nasty luck for the past three years, and then the Quidditch Cup incident happened, and the Ministry resurrected an old death game and…” She sighed turning back to Harry, looking at him with pity and regret in her eyes, “You. Have. Rotten. Luck…” she bit her lip looking down, “I simply had a feeling. So just in case, I wanted to make sure you had an alibi.”
Harry looked down from the balcony he was standing on, waiting for the stairs, finding Malfoy glaring up at him, “I could ask the same about you.”
“Alright, so following the departure of Salazar the founders agreed to establish a singular head of the school, and after much discussion agreed that Helena was the most prepared out of all of the heirs to take the role. But in the bastardization of the Romeo and Juliet story, Agnelious Whitaker, one of Salazar’s ex-students and a follower of his beliefs in purity, fell in love with Helena Ravenclaw. Unfortunately for her, they had each other on their wrists, so he believed it had been prophesied for them to be together and attempted to force it when she rejected him due to his beliefs.”
Draco looked confused but open to talk, “The task? The dragon was a million times bigger than you, so you often were out of sight. No one could see you. And it felt like that would be it, but then you’d emerge. And the Slytherins would boo-”
Harry sighed, frustrated and threw the orange away, his foiled gloves following the orange, storming off to Divination class with an amused Ron following him, asking him if he wanted to borrow at least one of his gloves.
I'm sorry if the next one takes a while, and feel sorry for me if it doesn't(cuz i'm gonna get an F).
When they went to lunch Harry noticed Draco wasn’t there. And that added a new reason to worry. What had Malfoy said or done to Draco?
“I already did. More like they offered it to me. I didn’t make me feel any better about fighting something that requires six or more people to subdue.”
(Getting bored of having to tell people the story is being continued, and trying to direct them here. Sorry if that sounds rude.)
“I know your father will not be happy about this, he will probably try to…” He looked discreetly at the Huffies, noticing one had managed to fall asleep at the table and the other one was struggling to stay awake, “He will probably try to ‘scare you away’ from me by… you know.” He sighed, “I know you will probably not heed my warning when I tell you, beg you to stay away from your family, from your dad or your aunt… But I’m done letting fear prevent me from enjoying my life. I just realized how easily I could lose everything, how it could all go away in a blink of an eye, so I will enjoy this while I can, and I want to enjoy it with you. So I came here to ask you to come to the Yule Ball with me and stay away from your family.”
Harry missed the first three periods, Ron claiming that he had noticed Harry had snuck out and that Harry had trouble going to sleep and that he had not desired to disturb his precious sleep. Since the closer this task got the more rare it became.
Harry sat down next to the boy, looping his right arm with Draco’s left and pulling him in to lay his head on his shoulder. He looked away at seeing Draco looking like he was pulling at every ounce of strength inside of him to prevent himself from sobbing. He never outright did. All Harry ever heard was Draco choking back his sobs while silently crying besides him.
Fuck. Harry really wanted to tell Hermione and ask her about all the school rules and how many rules Lucius was breaking by coming to school to not just beat a student but his own child. But he needed Draco’s trust. And a plan was forming in his head.
Draco never complained about any of that in either of the two impromptu insomnia meetings the two had that past week, only praising his mother for her bravery, sounding proud, ashamed and embarrassed. In reality it sounded like a teen who wanted to say something about the subject but had nothing to say and knew what they were saying was very much understood between both parties so there was no need to point it out and so they were embarrassed that they couldn’t stop themselves from saying it because they felt the need to feel the empty silence.
“I ask that you monitor him from now on. Stress is bound to show more symptoms soon, this will most likely not be the last. If you notice he’s having trouble sleeping, try everything on this list first before resorting to the potion, understand, Mr. Weasley?”
“Dumbledore put a protection around the goblet, that’s what the glowing ring is. If you think for a second you are smarter than Dumbledore, go ahead and try. Don’t come asking me for help afterwards.” After glaring at Ron for an extra second to intensify the threat, Hermione sighed and went back to her book.
Their stare continue until Malfoy’s smile dropped, fear replacing it as he turned to look at Dumbledore who was now staring at him dumbfounded. Harry turned to Hermione confused only to find her staring at him in horror, along with Ron. The rest of the school had a mixture of anger and confusion.
