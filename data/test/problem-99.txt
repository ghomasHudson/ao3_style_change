. . . . . . . . . .
“She would?”
“Depends on what we want. These so far are quite small.”
“Grayson. If you need help you need to ask for it. You too, Hugo. We all work together. I couldn’t do what I do without either of you. Got it?”
GOOD JOB! FULL MARKS!
Teddy has plans.
“Light woods, white paneling. I can see why you say that.”
Is it a surprise or can I tell her?
“You know it’s going to go over budget. I want it to be beautiful and comfortable and I want you to hire the best professionals available. . . . The staff needs to be the best. And I want you to add more glass or windows however you want.”
“You keep up with your lessons. Your Grandfather will teach you well. But you must pay very close attention to his lessons and be very careful.”
. . . . . . . . . .
Harry? Are you still here?
“Maybe phones don’t work in there?”
Oh no.
“I understand. But think about who the kids really are. They might be shocked at first and a lot overwhelmed, but first of all You and Ginny brought them up well. They put value in people and yes, fine things they appreciate but don’t expect out of hand. They understand the advantages they’ve been given. None of them flaunt it.”
“Oh. I would so love to see them.”
“Yes, I believe so. . . .do you mean that the staff can't talk about work with their families?”
“Why would you want to do that?”
Of course it will be.
“What’s a game room without exploding snap?!”
Before noon though? We’ve got the hurling.
Draco L. Malfoy
I am so looking forward to seeing you!
“Are you fucking kidding me!?”
“We could do that, I was thinking I’d check out the library.”
“Cool!”
“Yes.”
Okay thanks.
“I’m going to tell you a secret. Take a deep breath.”
“Go on?”
“That’s AWESOME!”
“Should I take it off? The necklace?”
From the outset I will apologize for the length of this letter/announcement, but time is of the essence.
“Yes. It’s a Muggle warehouse door.”
“Is her stuff still there?”
This is so cool.
And with that. Please enjoy the fantastic food prepared by our friends at the Harpies Centre. Wander about the manor a bit if you’d like but please respect Decram’s creation. He’ll be watching you like an eagle owl. It’s the opposite of Grimmauld, that nicknack might be lovely, but it also could be a priceless masterpiece. It’s actually almost guaranteed to be one. . . because . . .well, Decram.
They’ve got the hibiscus blooming. It’s spectacular.
See you in 10.
“Ahhhh, but if I let her get the energy out she’ll sleep like a baby!”
Do you really think so?
I want to take my family for a few days in the sun on a vacation somewhere like Bermuda. That is a once in a lifetime luxury for most families. But now apparently NOT MINE! just nod in the park!
“I had a copy made of Lucy’s when you allowed her one.”
“You chose them! And I didn’t say it was unpleasant, but I have an appointment.”
Well that was fun for me.
“You know me Al, I couldn’t get rid of them. It’s not really
You’re welcome. Bye.
“I’m not sure what I can do then?!”
“Merlin really no railing? Yes definitely do that.”
We’re trying to decide what to do with the potions. Too risky to be used for anything, but they’re really impressive.
“What the hell is gnome essence?”
“I’m glad you decided to add the owl cage. It really does create the right tableau. And now that the wands are placed it’s really complete. Stop squirming.”
OK I’d better get going. I’m not going to say anything about this to the family yet so don’t say anything about it to Ron and George in the morning. Or Al and Scorp either.
“I don’t understand?”
Al! you should come with me to the pool! You can exercise while I’m having diving practice!
Shit. I don’t think I was supposed to share that incantation. Pretend it never happened.
“So this first button will always take you back to right here on the back porch. For our test it’s going to take you just over there by Hugo and Rose’s place. That’s the last button all the way on the bottom. You press the button once and hold it down. You’ll feel it vibrate. When it does that press the button one more time and you’re on the way.”
“Harry.”
“If it’s forever do we get to be the same name like theirs?”
So if everyone just gets to pair up with people from the other team, where’s the competition?”
“They do, Draco. If I had my way I’d ask to show your wand too so people can see the one that actually finished off Voldy. I know we can’t do that. This is a close second.”
“EXACTLY.”
Let me think about that. The school is difficult. You might consult with the Minister about other locations.
Yes. That’s what I just said. I believe it’s time to retire the Malfoy name from the estate. I will also let fall Malfoy from my name and just be Black if you think that would be appropriate.
“I think you’re much better prepared for it now than you ever were before.”
“Alicia Ogden wishes to retire. She has no heirs. Jay, you have protected me and guided me. Protected my interests. Protected my Family and assets for a lifetime. You are the man I trust like no other to accept this responsibility. All you have to do is put on the ring and it’s done. Mister Erlaff has completed everything for the Lordship as he’s the overseer of the Ogden accounts. You can accept the seats at our next Wizengamot meeting. When the time comes you can pass down the Lordship to Jaydne.”
“Dumbwaiter. You can put plates or food that’s ready to serve in the downstairs kitchen or wine cellar and it magically transports it into the cabinet. Most likely it was only used to bring up drinks from the wine cellar though. There is a large full kitchen through those swinging doors.”
There are going to be 37 empty desks? And why am I last?
From the Paris apothecary. He’s the quality control manager. I’ve got the formulas recalculated and the Goblin team is getting things organized. We need you to come to approve and give instructions on this magic bottle labeler.
I’m joking.
“What is this?”
. . . . . .Draco?!
“I really shouldn’t discharge him in this state.”
Talk with you soon dear.
“You can do that anytime . . . . . . . ”
“Get in here and cool off. I’ll wash your hair.”
“I like the red.”
“Yes.”
Scorp?”
The Horror Hotel is lame! You've gotta go on it!
That’s pretty rich.
Is that everyone?
“So cool. I didn’t know he had this much stuff. Merlin.”
Alright. I’m glad we had this chat.
“What?”
“Is my husband up here?!”
Yes. Rose is here and it’s a little crazy, but it’s okay.
“I have it on good authority that you know the premium curse breaker of the Wizarding world. Get Bill down here to fix that. Then do something with it. YOU of all people can look at that building and see the potential. You have to look past its history. Your history.”
“No, you won’t. I know that Zebb fixed it.”
“Yes.”
I’m going to get Dean and Seamus to work on the cottage.
“Just sign the agreement, Barnabas . . . . . . . NOW . . . . . . . . . . Thank you . . . . . . . . . Here’s your copy . . . . . . . . I expect the statement on the front page of tomorrow morning's edition. I’ll file the original with the Minister. And . . . .there are CONSEQUENCES for breaching the agreement.”
“Did you see what I just did to the side of this building? The ritual? The miniature tornado and earthquake? Look at my HAIR!”
“Go ahead.”
LOL. I believe that was Draco. I didn't say fuck! I was being all good and motherly!
“Potions Lab! I can’t wait!”
“Pick a stove there’s plenty. That one has a pretty good prep area and there are aprons over there.”
—————————————————————————
Did that too. For the record it was champagne.
I will.
“I see, well that’s a new goal, and one I can support. We can continue if you want. Where did your father go? Where is he now?”
Okay good! That’s a relief. Do you approve?
“Don’t talk to them. They do not stop. Especially that Hesper woman.”
Diagon Alley, London
We don’t NEED to be doing anything. We’ve graduated to GREAT grandparent status. All we need to do is love, give advise when asked for it. Kiss babies. Those damned boys are being really stubborn and tight lipped about this baby though. They won’t budge!
Know what?
“You did?”
Oh yes, it’s good. The yarn seems to melt into itself when it’s been put together. And the colours are wonderful.
What?
They’re doing the Grandmother thing. Let them. Molly especially wants to do it before she gets all busy at Hogwarts. It’s what Grandmother’s do. Don’t question them. They can be scary!
“I think I’ve chosen the wrong outfit for you.”
Come over for lunch and then we’ll head out? Our schedules are pretty light this week because I've got a cake to bake and THERE’S A FUCKING WEDDING ON SATURDAY!!!!!!!!

“I need to see if you have the cheeses. Davey likes smoked gouda. If not, I’ll ask Trandy to make a quick trip to the Elf market.”
“Holy Shit.”
“We have two designated stops. We’ll first stop by the infirmary to meet Madame Pomfrey, Professor Lovegood-Longbottom will show you one of the greenhouses and then the house common rooms. I understand you’d like to speak with him about his toads?”
The kids like to have fun, but rest assured that they will be respectful. Don’t worry, they understand. Also one of the grooms is pregnant. The whole party should be pretty tame.
Ok. But if Al's doing the potions shouldn't Dad be involved?
—————————————————————————
“Wouldn’t feel right. And if it did you wouldn’t be able to call me Scarhead anymore.”
“No.”
So with that said, I’m putting together a coalition and splitting up the seats between myself and 8 others. Four of the eight have already accepted the challenge. And I hope that later this evening I’ll have the opportunity to meet BRIEFLY with all 8 that I would like to join me* (continued below).
I love it.
Likes Lana Del Rey. No pop music shame AT ALL.
London
RE: @RSkeeter
“Ralph, NO!”
Love you Al. See you later.
“Of course.”
“Oh my GOD!”
Bring them back to France. They should be at the Peverell property. Like what you did for Mr. Kreacher’s family.
“Your Grandmother apparently had excellent taste. It is beautiful. . . . Those huge windows will open and fold into the walls if you want. It opens the house to the outdoors. . . . We’re very lucky the Goblins had this paperwork. It tells us quite a bit. We’ll take a better look at it when we go inside.”
I’ve been working this account for over 50 years. I’m sure.
“Fuck . . . .
Proxies please stand. See? I’ve got notes and everything! Printed on cards! Grayson and Hugo did a fantastic job.
No problem.
“The question was, why were you brewing the wolfsbane in such a concentration?”
“Auntie Lily and Uncle Eric Please show me your Magic!”
“Yes. Chocolate and raspberry mousse between layers.”
“Why don’t you start by getting rid of Borgin and Burkes first. Just spell away all those signs.”
“Yep.”
go ahead, we’ll watch together. . . . . . . . ”
“Dad said that he wanted to mow for the party tomorrow. His mowers are back in the outbuildings. Always smells better than cutting grass with magic.”
I’m just here to tell you not to come down to the park until 14:00. We’re putting the final touches on things and I don’t want you to see it yet. Come out then and we’ll have a final walk through.
“No. We have things to do today. We’ve got a honeymoon date in Knockturn.”
“I’m up!”
Probably. What are you thinking?
Thank Merlin. He won’t hate my music.
“I thought you said coffee.”
“Jerry’s soup is GONE.”
“I don’t care for the carpets or the floors so yes. Whatever you like. Polished stone would be pretty up here. I’m not sure about all of those bedrooms.”
Kurfürstendamm, Berlin
“ . . . . . . . . . Fuck Yes!”
Gender, Gender identity, Sexual Identity.
That is disturbing. I sincerely thought it was disposed of when we purged Lucius from the manor. It’s possible that one of the staff thought it was too valuable to dispose. There's certainly no allegiance to Lucius.
ATTACHMENT
The motorcycles have not had any alterations. Completely Muggle.
“Yes. Poor Mister Pollux. Miss Irma’s decline started at that time.”
Oh, I will definitely read them now, I’ll bet they’re hilarious.
WTF does this story even mean? I really hate having to be the one to make reservations when everyone involved is really old and very opinionated about what they like. People eat at trendy restaurants for reasons. So? The best I can do is buy some new clothes.
Okay, well to start his name is Eric.
No. But Ron and I agreed to it in advance. We talked about it for quite a while.
“What’s going on?”
I’m here!
This is all for this week. See you next weekend. Stay Positive.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Anytime.”

“She’s talented.”
Yes! It’s nice out.
And to make it even worse? They’re fucking MARRIED now. We thought it was going to calm down. We now know where that’s going.
_______________________________________
I know! I’ve got all my cake stuff at the centre ;) We just need to clean up and put it away so we don’t “ruin the aesthetic” of Draco’s fancy kitchen. He won’t mind at all though.
I swear this chat setup has been a life saver.
“Gringott’s has a private floo system.”
“That’s not what I meant! All of that noise? The whole place was shaking! There are Muggles living in those townhouses!”
The catch is that I’ve given Mother carte blanche to do whatever she wants to the retail space.
——————————————————————————
“Are you really doing it? What you said? In Knockturn?!”
“Good grief.”
Ginevra, may I ask. Are you upset with your Mother and I for taking this on? We would love to have your input.
I love you.
“The emotional pain.”
“I'll grab Clara and you can follow me to the Leaky? The others can all meet us there.”
. . . . . . . . . .
“This is the best birthday of all time. Best presents, best food, best desserts.”
“No, come back.”
“I don’t know? 500 on the endowment and another 200 on the centre? Then there’s the set up for the Grandchildren’s accounts. . . . I spent Muggle money at Tesco for the Halloween party and bought you a really cool jumper at the Gladrags in Diagon. I don’t remember how much that was.”
Buy it.
“Well to be honest I think the lawnmowers might be kinda cool?”
Teddy = Wolf
“That one!”
So going okay then?
WHY????
“Do you like raspberry or blueberry jam? I have orange marmalade?”
“I’ll be right back! Can Davey come too?”
“UGH!”
“Watch. . . . . .See now, empty?”
“Harry where did you get this?”
JEWELS? She was matching jewelry to that chartreuse whatever fabric she had on me. It was HEAVY. I think it was dragon hide. CHARTREUSE DRAGON HIDE???

“I know that I need to look for other cars, Grayson!”
“I don’t believe the transformation on this place. It looks almost cozy with all of the art up. I also don’t believe you’ve got it all up.”
“First a phone. Same one like mine. Then he needs a computer. Again get him one like mine . . .The mack.”
“UGH. You’re as bad at lying as Harry.”
“Will Kreacher know?”
London
“Perfect! My turn . . . TWO: Truth or Dare, Dracoooo?”
Okay. So the thing is, while Hugo and I are doing our thing you need to do yours. Put on your Harry hat and don’t hyperventilate. Get them out of that flat. Explain only the VERY BASICS to Dudley for now and let Hugo and I do our jobs. We’ll be up all night but it should be all tied up before Lucy heads off to school in the morning. If you need anything we’re both at my office in the ministry.
Because you’ve gotten used me to setting out your outfits for the day since forever? And because it’s one of the favorite parts of MY day?
“I don’t want to.”
“Hire Jerry's crew to renovate it.”
“ . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Well look at this, it’s a whole galleon! Put that in your pocket for safekeeping. I can’t put it back in now!”
Dads?
OUCH! LOL, NO. I’ll be happy for Jaydne to take on the accounts.
Okay.
“I love a storm. We’ll keep things portable. You’ve got the portkey?”
James Lupin-Potter
“How did you convince her to let you do that?!”
“But promise me you’ll stay away from that fucking cliff. I’m serious, it’s a long way down.”
OMG I’d love to! You know that. We just didn’t have a reason to have more than Mr. Jordan who practically lives with you. Snaab lives with Grayson 24/7. James and Al are going to freak the fuck out! They loves owls! What’s the catch?
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . .
this is a big deal for Dud.”
Mr. Liogell will once again present Harry’s Lordship acceptance paperwork and the addendum. Then he will present Harry’s intent to secure his Wizengamot seats upon immediate receipt. At this point she knows who controls the Wizengamot.
“Well, Dec do you want to move to another painting while we move this one to the roof?”
I wholeheartedly agree.
“You will, there's plenty of time to learn magic! . . . . . you can even decide to wait a year if you want to. Your birthday comes so close to the time school starts that nobody would think about it twice if you decided to wait a year.”
First of all it looks good. At least I think so. It’s designed after an adult broom and not covered in bright kid colours. Basically a miniature version of my new broom. Ebony handle and hazel bristles. But it works with descending charms. The stick cannot go higher than a meter. And no faster than 8 kph. It’s got cushioning and a new balancing charm that can be gradually reduced. The main axis can’t be altered without parental controls.

More than happy to do that. I’ll also check to make sure that he’s got full immunity from the statute because his daughter is magical.

“Don’t mind if I do. . . . did you like the symphony?”
I know.
Scale of one to 10 how much do you like him.
“I do. Thank you very much Scorpius.”
Oh yes.
Resplendent in Satin, Silk and Sapphires!
Scorp and I have fairy lights and green stripes! Matching pillows and a popcorn machine, orange soda and chocolate. As you can see I've put Al's hair in a green ribbon for the occasion.
Lightning!
“Some of this goes outside and needs un-shrunk. Do those first?”
. . only that I should do their inheritance test or some such crap. OMG Hemoine. They wanted blood. What I thought was going to take an hour or two max took 15 HOURS! It just didn’t stop! And I’m not joking about the blood loss! Ask Draco, he was there! THOSE UNBELIEVABLE SNEAKY GOBLIN FUCKS! I SWEAR THEY DID THIS TO GET BACK AT ME FOR THAT DRAGON!
You will not.

“Do you want me to get your Mum?”
“It’s an awesome bath can it just be charmed in white or something?”
“Can you do that?”
I know you prefer pancakes or an omelette, but I’m not there yet.”
“WITH A PATH TO THE FUCKING TROUT POND!!!!”
Of course!

HARRY J. POTTER
Yes! Just floo into the dining room?
Right. There’s no possible way this took place in one day. Where did they sleep? Did they just nap in a drug induced Muggle coma in the poppy field???
What?
——————————————————————————
Merlin you’re right. His can be a dragon!
“I’d love that.”
Hi Hugo.
Let me get Draco and Blaise in here.
“She’s beautiful, Severus. I’ll bring her one day when Al is working in the greenhouse and I’m babysitting?”
How fast does it go?
Mine or yours?
So weird. The family seer.
Sis and I are both here what’s up?
More spoiling than ever before!
“Give me a minute.”
“Tell her Aunt Pansy sent you.”
Can you come over and help?
“Alright everyone up on the platform. There’s plenty of room. Kids up front! . . . . . . .yes you too. Zebb, right here . . . . . . . . .everybody under the canopy of stars!”
UGH. I’ll also admit that I think Rose and Jaydne could use a night out being grilled by their parents about intentions and all that rubbish.
Walburga’s portrait is still there. We couldn’t get rid of her. Also true about the mummified heads. James, what’s your middle name again? It’s the house I inherited from Sirius. Sirius Black. We’re going to open it up maybe next week to get started. But here’s the other thing. It’s historical. The headquarters for the “order of the phoenix” so Luna’s going to document and photograph it with the historical society. Only the Goblins, Family and order members allowed. The place is heavily warded. It’s part of a muggle townhouse complex, but invisible from the street. Also, I'm going to have to tell the boys about their wedding gift and I'm completely gutted I don't get to surprise them.
“NO.”
Yes. I’ll be there coordinating so I can take care of that part.
“Is that the one that will eat anything?”
Okay. Well have a Firewhisky with Draco when he comes back and try to calm down. I can tell you’re about to loose control. It will not be good if you have a breakdown. Practice your breathing. Are things starting to rattle? You need to keep your head on straight right now.
“Is that it?”
Then there’s Harry Potter disappearing every piece of extraneous furniture, shelf or display cabinet in sight.
“We can do that. Tell Harry?”
“This one you can take home, but this one is what we’re doing the magic with today. . . . . . Teddy?”
You know what? Fuck it. I’ll be there in 10.
LOL could do.
REALLY? For Dad’s assistant?
“Oh my.”
WHAT NOW????
“I always forget about your business acumen because you’re my Mother. And then I remember who taught me everything.”
“So we’re just going to drink all day and tour the house?”
“Did you have fun?”
I’ve also replaced the crocodile heart with another combination. This is where it get’s tricky.
The formality of the disclaimer will no longer be necessary for our correspondence, but will be needed for outgoing correspondence for your event.
“What? I don’t like the sound of that.”
Hey Gareth. Thanks!
And thanks. I’m not going to be able to peel Jamie off the walls now. Did you see him? You’d think someone just gave him the keys to broom heaven.”
“Have you heard anything from Teddy about Eric?”
We have reached out to the Potter and Malfoy families for comment with no response!
“ . . . . .Okay, I think dinner is being prepared and I want to witness my Mother attempt to cook. Jerry and Harry are in the same room together and I think we need to go put a critical eye to their hijinks. Also, Decram looks like he is going to die again if you don’t start the music and dancing soon let’s do it.”
“Everyday things. Could be work related. Something you excel at that others don’t”
One more today after a bit.
“Repeat after me. . . Cissa. . . .”
“What is that?”
“I really need that mind reader check thing!”
Dud is coming back soon I think. He ran out for an emergency. I’d better go. See if I can ask Minnie a question or two before he get’s here.
UGH. Yeah, maybe I’ll ask Sean do it. He’s on loan from Draco. They don’t have to know where it came from.
It was, let’s say enlightening.
“Hi caboose people!”
“Hello Mister Hat?”
“I’m absolutely sure, you’re Teddy’s gran. I trust you.”
I’ll have you know, that auction funded and entire summer of workshops and classes. We plan to do another this season. Okay let’s move on. I’ll ask you the same question I asked Ginny. What are your plans for the future?
Maybe. I’m just really feeling it today. Everything’s puffy. I feel like a freaking balloon!
I’m a little disturbed with her refusal to pry information about the baby out of him.
“Why two grills?”
Temporarily while I work on the houses.
“You may be a little old for it. . . . .”
“Under the circumstances I’d say twelve. You have to realize this is the best business they’ve had in years. It’s bigger for Diagon than any of the holidays. They’re thrilled. Bigger than the summer nights festival.”
. . . . . . . . . .
He likes my shampoo!
We’re coming back with Mr. Cheng. You’re having dinner with us.
LOL and UGH!
Ten Minutes. Bye.
“Al?”
I’m sorry I’ve not written much, but I did’t really have a lot to say. Just been looking for work without much luck. I’m sorry, but it’s been really hard.
“It worked?”
Good. But I think that you’ve got the public behind you, especially with bringing in all of the young people and designating the majority of your seats.
“What do you think Draco? Evanesco all of it? We’ll start all fresh? I can get rid of the furniture and junk.”
How go the dragons?
Two more tomorrow. Hope you're all having a good weekend. Stay safe!
Draco I need to fill you in on something and I need to apologize.
RE: @Milk Snake Observer
Okay not the opera. We’re going to the strip club in Knockturn.
“We’ll do it.”
Well it’s Harry and Draco. I’m actually surprised they didn’t just finally elope and tell us about it later.

Happy first day of spring!
All recipients of this letter have agreed in writing, in advance of the receipt of this letter, a disclosure concerning the dispensing of information to unauthorized media. You have been advised to not speak of the event or disclose the location. You have signed the agreement. Hermione doesn’t joke, the Ministers consequences are HARSH. I wouldn’t chance it! I mean, recently it was 18 Week Boils and the uncontrolled spewing of Dad Jokes!
“AAAK. Brake, Harry! Full stop at the intersection!”
“You’re incorrigible.”
Harry, we can’t do the Prophet thing tomorrow.
Meaning?
“Nothing is in terrible shape, but there is definitely need for improvements.”
And by supervise, you mean you’ll sit on the porch with Scorp and watch the landscaping team mow the lawn. Then Mr. Trandy will arrive with lunch?
“Next is the “children’s level”, whatever that means. Above that is the “Family level” and then the roof. So I guess no attic?”
Alright if it makes you feel better I’ll accept. And then maybe we can ask Luna’s boy and his friend to play music for the kids after people have eaten cake? We could then just cancel the formal dinner. I can also have that set up buffet style and put something together for the adults downstairs. Then the kids can have fun in the ballroom.
So glad. It looks so cool with the big river stones on the fireplace.
As far as finishes, I was thinking going lighter. The cabinetry would go a light birch/honey color. Countertops and backsplash a white quartz (muggles make quartz it’s like crushed granite and glass molded together) It’s easier to maintain than granite. If we do ALL muggle appliances they should be stainless steel. I know a vendor in America that would be perfect and they can transport by international PK directly to our site. For the main sink I’m thinking something deep like what Molly has.
“I’ll do that. . . . . so no haircut?”
I’m at the Centre paying bills. Where are you?
I’ll make plenty and just let people know they’re invited to drop over later?
HARRY J. POTTER
It’s pretty crazy. I freaked out a little I’m not going to lie. Then I realized that we are probably the only ones in the complex that can see it. So that’s actually cool!
So what do you suggest? And yes I own several. And yes they are some of my favourite gifts. What the fuck do you think I sleep in all damned winter? But if I don’t do it someone else will. And then I can’t control the quality.
Your suggestions sound perfect. Please arrange for a donation of 1000 galleons made to the GMS for their talents and with my compliments.
“HA!”
Dad said it was kinda important.

“I DID?!!”
Speaking of fish, I think these people are turning into sea creatures.
. . . . . . . . . .
“I guess she could, but we’ll be in Wales tomorrow.”
“Have you eaten?”
“It’s like a sing-along.”
Do that. How hard would it be to move the shelves?
“I do.”
“It really is. . . .I can’t even describe it. Fast as fuck and stops on a knut.”
“I miss Aspen.”
“Okay.”
“I could make them decorative pendants with ladybugs. Just decorative though.”

“Okay so then he’s going to be representing me and running errands. . . . going to Gringotts and such. He needs a good wardrobe. Everything. But not stupid robes. . . . everything and anything else though. Jumpers and shoes. . .a good coat for this crap weather. Don’t scrimp. I need my assistant looking sharp!”
“They’re nice frogs, you know. Green with little brown spots on their foreheads. They like the new bugs. . . . . .I’m not sure what they are, they came from Maeda. But they like them a lot.
“It looks fine.”
“Hey! That fucking hex hurt!”
Reba’s new waiter gave me an eye roll when I asked for a lemon slice with water at breakfast.
Junk Shop Opens.
Harry will actually move to adjourn and asks if there is any other business that needs attended. This is where Hugo steps in.

You aren’t going to regret it. Oh there’s team merch. I’ll ask my Gringotts guy who to root for. Even better Draco and I will root for one and You and Mione the other?
“We can’t leave this at a draw, Harry! Do you want to see the lawnmowers or not???!!!”
“Yes, let’s do that if they’re up for it. We haven’t seen Iris in a long time, how old is she now?”
When reached for comment Mr. Blaise Zabini supplied the following: “We are very proud to announce the opening of Apothicaire Dragonne, ahead of schedule, tomorrow morning.
“Love the way you’re thinking this morning.”
I can spar with him in JUDO! Well not right now, but after the baby!
Good idea. When does Sean come back again? We need him.
RE: @Kesniton LMP
What do we do?
“Yeah, okay this isn’t bad.”
“That would work. Seems like a waste though. What do you think your Grandparents did with it Narcissa?”
“You too. Did you see the shop?”
“Fuck!!!!”
“NOW kiss the Warlock! ”
I would like to take the Iceland property out of stasis as soon as possible. Can that be done without my having to be present? I would like to arrange for Mr. Malfoy and Myself to tour the property and lodge in four days time.
“. . . . .and then Uncle Nev decided that instead of hugglmups we’d plant wiggs this coming year. That should be okay. Much easier. I don’t want to come home to a baby smelling like hugglmups.”
Thank you very much. Have a good day.
None of us are those kids anymore. Not a single one. I’m very happy for you.
“Yes she is. Lily is my youngest. Dud, how long ago was it when you guys last came to the cottage?”
“Gawd. . . . .So here’s Draco all dressed up in whatever that is with the jewels and over the top of it all he’s got an eyeball hanging around his neck on Davey’s handmade chain. You too. . . . .”
“Mr. Mason. Does he fulfill the requirements for this Muggle driving license?”
This is hilarious.
“The baby. Don’t you know that’s a baby?!”
I have arranged for Grandfather Arthur and Prof. Neville Lovegood-Longbottom to attend with their respective spouses if their schedule conflicts can be resolved. They are both keyed into the Portkeys. Also joining us will be Mr. Blaise Zabini as Narcissa Black-Malfoy’s escort.
“I do too.”
“Yes?”
“A lovely Sunday morning in Knockturn Alley.”
“Really, Gragnaff.”
- Hermione
“I didn’t know we were going to do that.”
“Shut up!”
Okay I’ll give you people another chance, but I’m sitting here with my arms folded in Malfoy Scold Mode.
Geez Al. Go overboard much?
“See?!”
This is the Mid-Week update.
“You were right though, the actual joke was on Molly. He looked amazing.”
Because they’re MUCH better at this kind of thing than either of us?
So I hear!
“What?”
“Hidden step path!”
Kensington
It actually is the perfect use for that floor. Good job.
I was expecting this.
Oh yes, that’s a given. They’ll probably break out brooms at some point as well.
Said to contain the dark secrets of Peverell. Dementors, “the stone” blood rituals, etc.
“Here we go. Cake in bed!”
“Up!”
Come over in 30 Minutes?
“Well that opens it up nicely! Shay you’re going to want to do something with those bare studs though.”
“Potter, nobody has ever heard anything like it before tonight.”
Albus S. Potter and Scorpius H. Malfoy
“Gampa Daco!”
I’d kill for a cup of strong black coffee right now. Yes please and thank you.
“Yes ma’am. Please may I take your coat?”
“I’m going to hug you. Like this. . . . . right as we jump put your arms around my neck. Wrap your legs around my waist and hold on tight.”
“Well . . . .”
Minister of Magic
“I would like it to stay small. Just bring in enough appliances to make a small dinner. I’m going to have a nice big kitchen downstairs with the snowflake dining room. We can have guests down there. Did I tell you how much I love the snowflake dining room?”
It’s your lucky day!
We are definitely doing that. Would there be room for a small park to go with it? Just around it so the parents have a place to hang out?
“I doubt it’s going to be that bad, Liogell said it should be habitable, but probably a good idea to be prepared. We should get some sleep, going to be a long one tomorrow.”
I always have time for you.
Oh. ANOTHER project for later. Have Grayson show you the roof access in the townhouse and the little spiral stairs in the library. Let me know if you can remove the closet and put in a spiral like that?
Most Sincerely,
How is that possible?
You didn’t do nothing.
“Yes. I hear you can even ask it to tell you a joke.”
“See you’ve got it! You can just leave them on if you want. It shouldn’t hurt anything.”
“We’re on it. Did you see the mobiles?”
“NO. You don’t get to see the cake until tomorrow. I’ve hidden it.”
I know right?
Because of the grounds and the art. Even with the wards. The place is like a museum.
I honestly didn’t think you would.
Okay who’s NOT up for pizza?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Treat him to a good day. And I’m serious when I said he needs everything. He showed up with a backpack full of shrunken books and not much else. Jay is giving him an advance. Galleons and Muggle cash. Don’t let him spend that money on anything unless it’s basics like food.”
“ . . . . . Yes and that one’s called the inside snap roll.”
“It’s a new park! I can’t wait!”
They were experiments!
Cool!
Yeah, it wasn’t pretty but Uncle Charlies ward is awesome!
I. LOVE. IT.
OH That's done!
I’ll open the wards.

It is. By the way, Draco is here.
“Oh please oh please oh please let me call you butterbean.”
Mr. J. Liogell
. . . . . . . . . .
“OH MY GAWD THAT’S MY HAIR!”
“Where are they going now?”
“Draco and Dud. They’re actually, I don’t know how to explain it, they’re becoming friends or something. Such total opposites, but they’re enjoying each other’s company?”
“It’s fine, Dud. Really. No harm can be done here.”
Awesome! Lily, can you ask Dud and Lucy?
Oh dear. That doesn’t sound promising.
“They’ve eaten it. It’s almost frightening.”
We’re all in. Teddy, me and the boys.
And then once they’re settled they can relax and get into the routine that Scorpius is worried over.
“I’d like a ride?”
This is the second part of the previous chapter.
——————————————————————————
“I see. . . . I was looking forward to helping clean up the libraries though.”
A lot smaller than the Proph but well written.
——————————————————————————
“Yes.”
WHAT?
“Absolutely.”
Lucy Meets Minnie.
I’ve put you back to Butterbean in my phone. So there. Question?
You should be very proud.
I took him shopping. For a new computer.
Why don’t I get that?
She wants to make a STIR FRY.
So I’ve already built the main panels. It should go together really quickly. It will enclose the entire front including the two adjacent townhouses. The wrought iron is turning out really cool. The design will look really super lit from behind at night. Do you want the big main door panel to slide left or right? What’s your question?
Okay then. I’ll have Grayson clear the schedule.
Indian food! It was really really good.
What rod?
“I’m not sure?”
“As real as it gets for a Wizard!”
“It’s all based on pensieve memories?”
Uncle Ron is up on the top floor working with the shipping and receiving guy. They’ve sorted through the shipments from Paris. He says it all looks good, so we can start the owl deliveries right away.
Yes! It’s a special treat to myself for having to tell the boys in advance about their wedding present! Hermoine, wait until you see this place. It’s really something else. You’re already helping plenty.
Let’s just do the party here at the cottage. We can do in out on the big front lawn and he can ride his broom all over. Jon’s going to want to bring his too.
“I like the glass. Wow. This is cool!”
“Nobody told me!”
Project Wedding Gift is a GO. So that’s the plan I have, at least the one that’s been jumbling around in my head. The exterior just needs a coat of paint. That standing seam roof you put on is great. The copper rain chains set off the black roof. So we just clean up the exterior. Keep it the same. It’s a pretty building.
Return to Grimmauld property from Hogsmead Garden.
Don’t thank me. Are you coming on Saturday?
To be honest, she says that even when you’re in sweats and twenty year old trainers.
LOL. Okay, I’ll try not to teach him any bad habits. Put some carrot sticks up in that cabinet, in a bag under stasis. Davey loves carrot sticks. Even better, cherry tomatoes. He really loves those.
I LOVE that.
“I didn’t know there was a gate. That’s COOL!”
Not a spider web now more like a snowflake!”
Super short Sunday post.
——————————————————————————
. . . . . . . . . .
That’s what I said! Look it up! It’s Draco’s favourite. Love You Bye!
From:
“If you’re doing this Jamie and I are coming with you!”
We’ll keep an eye out for them. Astra wouldn't let anything happen either. Why would you be worried about the boys? They're independant.
“Hi.”
“Umm. . . .sir?”
“And RON!”
____________________________
“Iris will demonstrate the aguamenti!”
LOL okay.
“We take these other two bedrooms and turn them into one large room and this will be the entertainment room. Television on that wall. We can do a match of the paneling in Harry’s study behind it as an accent. It will be interesting with two balconies then. We will do curtains in here too so they can be drawn for light control. And of course in the bedrooms as well.”
“Why?”
UGH! ROSIE!
“You’re sure?”
“Ummm. . . . . .you’re really serious.”
Good afternoon Jennifer.
“OUCH!”
“TEDDY?!”
“I’d like you to meet Mister Snape. He was a professor and school Headmaster when your Grampa Harry and Draco were young. This is Jon our oldest, and this is Davey.”
Sounds good, but I’m ordering take out. Greek?
So it’s a designated mixed community now?
It will show off the stylized “12” on the door panel and the 10 and 14 on each end. I think you’ll like it. I can do the same for your garage doors.
“Alright let’s take a look at the beast. Do you want to guide us Mother?”
“Won’t it look weird that we’re at the amusements with an old Muggle lady?”
Really? That’s so cool!
“HA! What’s important here is what’s on the inside, not just the decoration.”
How old are you??? The pedal car is more appropriate!
I’m not freaking out. But didn’t Nev ban you from a greenhouse?
Of course.
“Jamie, this is what I tried to explain before. He doesn’t follow the prescribed broom rules. He’s taught him not just how to ride it but how to control it.”
“So we’re your last resort?”
“Potter, you have to put on some clothes.”
“What’s wrong with it?”
I love you.
“Oh no.”
. . . . . . . . . .
“I know.”
“I’m Al.”
“No, I mean you didn’t ruin our day. It was a wonderful day actually.”
_____________
Certainly.
“It’s my outfit for the dinner. Look it’s the same outfit as in the Portrait! Decram Potter please let me introduce Hermione Granger-Weasley. She is the current Minister of Magic.”
“Why? They could be miles apart and it wouldn’t change anything.”
Scorp listens to the radio.
“Yes please!”
“OH! Yes these are the silent ones. . . .Oh merlin they’re awesome.”
Hadn’t thought about that. Yes that’s good.
So you all now have access to my skills! Here’s a hangover potion. Need something for that lockjaw? Have a Jawbind antidote!. Here’s one for that receding hairline Ted!
Are you joking? I took care of Louis and Hugo when they were babies. I even took care of YOU and Lily.
“It’s dragons?”
With Rose and Jaydne too, yes it’s possible.
——————————————————————————
“An expensive mistake. I don’t want to talk about that one.”
Hold on. I’ll pull it up on my computer.
Yes. Those things happened, and yes, you were a snarky arse. When it came down to it though, you did the right thing. You and Narcissa put your lives at risk. People need to learn about that too.
I have a better idea. How about you just tell all the old people to fuck off and that it’s a kids only thing. Or just not tell them at all! There’s already going to be a dinner the night before the wedding and a reception after for everyone. Plus . . . my Mother is involved. Trust me there are going to be more than enough family functions. We don’t need to start adding to that.
“Saturday.”
. . . . . . . . . .
Yeah, the new roof will match the main house. She’s requested a red front door. Seamus is going to enclose it with a new wrought iron fence and clean up the stone walkway. Even a new lantern on the front. It’s going to be cute.
“So I’ll give you a trim. We’ll leave it messy on top and cut the sides and back shorter.”
You could house it at Grimmauld once you have that done. Sounds like you’ll have the room.
I’ll come there, I want to change and grab a couple things for the day.
I’m buzzing still and yes, Gareth has stopped by to give me a break. Draco too a couple of times, Thank Merlin. He’s been able to answer potions lab questions and teach me more about that exhibit so I can do it better.

“ . . . . . .
“Potter, come with us.”
“I’m not. These past few weeks have brought a lot of my confusion over my Parents to clarity. People talk about my Parents with grandiose terms, but most never really knew them. I certainly didn’t.”
They really are going crazy on the place aren’t they?
“It wasn’t tragic. But I’ve come to the realization that MY mother may have brought us here just to check up on her insane sister and make sure that Mr. Kreacher was safe.”
What would you like for dinner?
I have the boys after school on Tuesday and Thursday. Jamie does Monday and Teddy has Wednesday and Friday. I AM TOTALLY FREE ON FRIDAY.
Is that what you’re calling it now? I can’t keep up with all of these euphemisms.
“I’ll let you have the one exception then. Only one snake in the house, Scarhead.”
“Music?”
“Mainly just piano. A little violin. Get Blaise up here, he can play that cello. Mother plays the violin. Oh. . .Pansy plays flute.”
“I don’t. Al might be able to help with that as well. He’s records that telenovela that he and Scorp like.”
“Absolutely. . . . . . . What’s the Halloween plan?”
“I cook biscotti. And now I cook bacon, a scrambled egg and I can make you toast with the toasting thing. I was going to bring it to you in bed, but you got up early and ruined my surprise.”
——————————————————————————
“What?”
I’ll do it. I need to fill them in on the stag party. Team Dragon Tamers!
“. . . . . . . . . . .READY.”
“OH . . . . . Dean and Seamus?!”
“Go down there and congratulate your Husband, Scorp.”
“Ron and Draco head to head in a chess battle. We took that in your game room.”
“. . . .so . . . . I think you have everything you need in her travel bag here. . . just follow the Poppy feeding chart?”
So maybe we can spend more time together that’s not just about my job and things? I had a great time with you and last night in the chat was fun, but that was a crowd and I’m still really nervous about things. Maybe we can just go on some dates?
Done?
“Trial period.”
I’m out.
Then I have a proposal that might solve two problems.
. . . . . . . . .
——————————————————————————
“I definitely approve, darling. Please do this.”
“YES!”
“Let’s take the stairs. We can test it later.”
“What about something for the rain? Even with Dean’s windows it looks like it could leak.”
I’m sure that’s a charm.
“I can’t wait to get you on that fucking broom Draco.”
YES! We are taking the bus. . . . .
“I believe there’s some truth to that. But maybe not mix wine with the draught. Are you sure you’re okay with the family thing?”
“Scorp and Teddy spent the day making paint powder.”
She’ll be happy for you.
Why not?
“No. Why would I make a joke about salad? I love salad.”
I NEVER SAID THAT!
“I can understand that.”
Thanks. I know it seems like we’re always just bitching at each other.
We would probably want the guys to clean up the exterior first though. It’s really not too bad, but would be nice to have it match up the rest of the complex better.
“This is where Uncle Sev came to reflect. No distractions, Just the middle of nowhere overlooking the ocean.”
HA HA HA
Well they’re definitely going to be bothered about loosing one of their cozy buddies on the panel, and to Draco of all people. Make sure he’s got a fantastic outfit. But then you can hit them with the bludger!
Lima 2.0 is owned still by wizards but it’s in it’s old location in Muggle London and yes I pulled the “savior card” to get us a reservation (and perhaps a couple perks).
In researching the original design of the park it was discovered that each townhouse basement level was originally an enclosed glass porch. This porch opened onto individual courtyards for each tenant. We will be restoring this aspect of the original design to the Grimmauld Complex.
Yes we’re sure. I started taking the potions a while back.
. . . . . . . . . .
It’s huge. He’s got a whole sitting area and a fireplace. He did say that if you’re curious he’d bring any of you down there.
“Absolutely.”
“Not a bit. It’s just the vegetables. Gives me a head start. I hadn’t planned on a vegetable garden here, it’s just a bonus. Plus I’ll get my hands dirty putting them in and it gives me more time to concentrate on the conservatory.”
We’re fine. That’s all good. I’m just a little dumbfounded that it’s such a frenzy down there.
I have everything needed. Quite a selection of papers. Smooth and textured, cotton rag etc. There are easels as well, but I prefer to work on a table most of the time. I have two drafting tables that are adjustable. The type that are normally used in designers studios. If you have particular paints or brushes you prefer you should bring them.
“Do you prefer Lucy or Lucille?”

“HA!”
Hey I was up super early this morning! but yeah, you know me well. Let’s try for 10am so I can get things started?
“What’s that?”
“She may know how to reactivate them much better than me, that’s for sure.”
“Most definitely.”

That could be cool!
Are you mad?
“Cool huh?”

School Lab.
“Pretty much?”
At their place in the forest?
“Gawd.”
“I have a request.”
Why is that?
AP: I need to keep my schedule flexible because we’ll be planning a family.
“I’d rather have been a spy. Not just a minion.”
OMG. I could totally see it.
But at least it’s owned by wizards? It’s a perfectly nice Mexican restaurant.
I hear you’re opening up chat rooms now?
If it was my prerogative, I would of course accommodate a request for private quarters for Mr. Kreacher and Ms. Ruby if they chose to bond, but the law will not allow it on Hogwarts property. I would also appoint Mr. Kreacher as Assistant Professor at this point, but again, Elfin law. He would be my prime candidate to take over for Mr. Stiger when he retires next year. Mr. Kreacher continues to refuse his salary (which we put into a Gringotts saving account anyway), which could be used to settle him into VERY comfortable accommodations off Hogwarts grounds.
“Bee!”

How the hell does he collect memories?
WOW. Serious?
“Thunder!”
“What?”
AAAK. I don’t know what we were thinking.
“A magical house of this era will most likely tune into your magic. Anticipate your needs. You may think one day "it would be nice if there was an extra closet" and a few days later it might just be there.”
Pretty soon! I’m going to make a mess in your kitchen today.
“Do you still want to meet today?”
Harry thought it was funny.
. . . . We’re on to something here and I think I know what it is. Let’s move these shelves.”
Stand by for the explanation . . .
“Walburga must have used transfigurations on the furnishings. That was obviously reversed.”
But the Potter gene is dominant. Make no mistake you are all Potter. Right down to that tiny mole on your right cheek that you share with Al. I can almost guarantee that your Aspen Astoria will be just like the two of you. Beautiful mane of black messy curls and all.
“Yes. Ummm several.”

“Okay? What the bloody hell am I going to do with 12 guest suites? Narcissa, are they even useable?”
“Okay! Come on Gramma Ginny!”

No, but we talked about it. She said she would later.

“How would I know? It’s a vintage Muggle suit from the nineteen seventies.”
Keep in mind that you have a full crew available in concessions at the centre, and it’s the off-season.
Only if you want to go to Japan.
I still don’t believe Draco let Uncle Harry dress him up and take him out like that.
Goblin/Witch?
Mr. Harry J. Potter
“I have a plan, Potter.”
“What do we actually have to do today?”
_____________
I do not lie. The dining room alone is a massive explosion of fuchsia and gold leaf CUPIDS. Imagine Pudifoots on Valentines day times 2000. Draco said that they put baroque on top of baroque and then baroqued it some more. It really is quite something to see.
“I’m buying. You need to test your driving skills! Almond syrup! My treat. Jay do you like coffee? You can sit in front with Grayson!”
Did you scheme with Tory before Al's first day of school at Luna’s?
I do.
True.
Narcissa.
We’re going to take a break and take the boys to the park. Don’t do anything while we’re gone!
“OH MY FUCKING GAWD.”
I have one. Maybe just a clarification. This legislation allows the Minister to consult with the Wizengamot concerning lawmaking. Does this allow her to write laws or just consult?
I’ve heard that. We were trying to keep it a secret! Seems like that plan has now backfired.
“Such a beautiful day.”
“Yes. Looks like it. And the seed bottles are laid out next to them.”
“Mione is pretty ecstatic. You know how she is about Hugo.”
RSVP for our reunion!
““•” There. Fixed it.”
“What do you mean?”
“DRACO! Language!”
“Hugo.”
“Exactly. So let’s ask for help.”
JOKE!!!!!
Don’t know what it is?
“Yeah, right. . . .and I’ve got a magical bridge to the moon for sale.”
“Yes. Draco’s lap. Christmas at the cottage.
“Okay?”
“I would have no idea.”
Have a great week. Stay safe!
“Why three?”
“And was he as smitten with you or did he just take you for all of your galleons building this thing? And what’s up with the cherubs?”
Lucy is welcome here at the burrow with the other kids if that’s alright with Duddley. Rumor has it, I’m good with kids.
“Of course.”
And what other plan did you have once you have me there? I’ll need some more incentive to cancel the appointment.
“Want me to make you a coffee or something?”
“Isn’t he gorgeous?!”
“Is pink chalk okay? It’s what the kids use on the sidewalk. Pink is always the best colour.”
“We can have Grayson help with things too . . . . . . . so, now you’ve got some time . . . . to . . . . . .spend . . . . . . . helping me . . . . . . . ”

That's it for the weekend. Hope you enjoy.
She’s been breeding owls for years down by the stables. Would you be willing to help take care of them in the owlery at home? They could be there at night and not have to go all the way back to Wiltshire after work?

He’s going to be very excited. Will Dad give the broom lesson?
“They really did rally to the cause.”
who are always coming on to him?
“Understandable.”

“NO. I love it. I like the glass tops too.”
“What in the hell. Uncle Harry that is. . . . .just woah.”
FUCK out of that building. She won’t be doing that again.
He’s getting good! He can do seven spells.
FOURTEEN!
THIS IS PHENOMENAL.
“This is disturbing. I thought there was a limit."
Today if you could go to my kitchen and check that there’s coffee, milk, tea and heavy cream. Earl grey and chamomile tea and dark roast whole bean coffee? I think Zebb might have used up all of the good coffee.
“Zebb and Trandy did a bit of sneaking around. Met with a chef you know.”
We can get coffee drinks while we’re there. It’s a nice little local shop. I’ll just finish up here. 1/2 hour? Your place?
“Puff! Puff puff puff puff. Cool!”
“Lead the way.”
You know what? I don’t mind if you don’t.
“Yes. Open the door or is that one locked too?”
“I’ll need to speak with my sister. I just don’t know. Mother was dead before I was 10. We never had conversations about such things. Father may have just been afraid of her. He was supposedly indifferent to them all but he was dead before Mother.”
I’m telling you they’ve already had to restock the store.
Okay?
at it sends me into a panic.”

“Prepare to be destroyed Dudley Evans!”
And YOU’RE going to sit on the freaking Wizengamot?
You’re really going to prank the family? How can I help?!
“Lucy already has her school stuff ready. Even picked out an outfit. I’ll tell her in a few. She’s going to want to change and find something cute to wear to your place. Especially if she’s seeing Lily and Rose.”
He’s a little intimidated, but it’s going to be ok.
Not going to lie. The cake itself is all hand done and baked. I broke down and used magic to decorate it. I just didn’t have the time. Plus it’s for Lucy so introducing magic is acceptable, right?.
I’m glad I put you in that blue jumper. You look very handsome behind the publishers desk.
“Open that champagne. We’re celebrating and watching my brother having the time of his life setting off fireworks with Hugo and his fiancé.”
“No. There are the reef mangroves that sound intriguing. We could hire a wizard guide. We would need that, the Muggle part I understand is a bit risky, but they could take us to Uxbenka.”
No, I get it. I don’t want to go. All those guys would be hitting on you!
“Eye necklace.”
“It was really one of my best of the season, thanks, Al.”
“I should have known that you’d feed a four year old straight sugar. Why don’t you start giving him espresso shots next?”
“Of course. . . . . . . I love you Papa.”
“You need some plants and furniture out here now. I wanted to get this part done first. The Goblin crew will be here tomorrow to start the basement conversions. We’ll do these in here first. They’ll work the whole shift but I’m taking off early for the dinner. I’m making a potato leek soup to go with the beef.”
“There’s three weights of fabric. . . . . seasonal . . . . . it’s more just about having them fitted.”
“Oh I know. . . . . It’s not like it happens every night at least. That would be a bit much.”
“My Mum and I want to know what he did.”
I’m in the middle of a dragon taming lesson, I’ve got to go.

“I think Gamma Ginny has prettier hair. It looks like cherries. Just like Papa Jamie.”
“I know, Grayson. Full stop and wait for cars.”
“UGH.”
I’m sorry!
“Yes?”
If you promise not to teach Davey any more wordless spells. Sure.

“Yes we probably should. More delivery?”
“I know! What the hell is it?”
I’ve got connections!
I’m going to wait until later when it's completed. Stay out of their hair Potter!
Let’s meet up at the Cat & Crown for dinner and drinks?
Rose you knew about this all along didn’t you?
“Andi?”
“They’re two hot! I can’t book them.”
I’ll fucking Fidelius the whole thing! The one I put on it now is just to block Judy. Ugh.
I love you too Harry.
"Looks like they’re getting tired, should we give them a break?"
Strawberry Shortcake! I would like to request Ron’s pasta salad with the artichoke hearts. I love that.
“You’re probably right.”
You all do plenty. All he cares about is that you’re all happy and healthy.
“Apparently so?”
Aaak. Sorry. . . . . I call for an adjournment for dinner and to rejoin in the chamber in . . .well, we originally said one hour but let’s make it an hour and a half? And Hugo maybe you can get the others informed about what’s on the agenda for after the break?
“Well, let’s take them to my study and have a look. I’m sure it’s nothing too serious.”
“He’s going to do it?”
Witch Weekly has the scoop?
Do you see the one where gramps is diving the train!?
Don’t blame the Potters this time around. This one has Narcissa Malfoy written all over it.
Today we still definitely have our house rivalries. In Quidditch most certainly. But here’s the difference. Today, once the Quidditch match has concluded it’s a celebration of all houses. Congratulations for the winner and a job well done for the defeated team. At years end the house cup is celebrated by the entire school because it’s based on academic achievements and not on a system of points, demerits or quidditch wins. All houses socialize between each other not only in common rooms or in the great hall, but within and between families. Long gone are the days where a rivalry of the houses breeds hatred or violence. This development can be directly attributed to the example parents and now grandparents have set for themselves and their children. It can be seen most definitely in the Wizengamot we see here at this very moment. I could not have said that mere hours ago. The final part of Hugo’s Referendum does nothing more than acknowledge the facts and commend our Wizarding society for its ability to evolve, and I commend him for including it.
“I for one think it’s great! Very creative, Dad.”
I didn’t say it was a bad thing. I thought it was hilarious.
That’s fantastic.
It’s really cool actually and Decram is a total crackup. Dad has me painting a background for him to visit at Grimmauld.
“I would need to configure appliances. That could be fun. Maybe do the counters in here too?”
Talk anymore?
“Of course I do!”
“Merlin. What the actual. . . . .”
LOL okay then.
“Really. That is quite impressive. Try it on!”
She loves you!
Bring anyone you want down to the junk shop as long as it’s family.
“Blue sparks over there!”
YES! You got it!
“You asked for it, Scarhead.”
If you’re busy that’s okay. Another time?
Oh Merlin yes, coffee. Ten minute break!
I’ll never get it.
Late night Tuesday midweek update.
Number 14 Grimmauld Place,
I apologize for the late notice and additional trip. Please bill me accordingly.
“It’s too late now.”
“Your Papa Jamie worked here in the summertime when he was young.”
And now I want to see if we can get it to transfer to Grimmauld. I need to bring the test over and then you need to invite Decram into the painting. There’s a protocol. We’ll see if it works before I get started on the real painting?
“Harry, can you imagine my Godfather ever leaving anything out of place? Even in haste?”
Mrs. Gloria Mason
Dad would give up the penthouse.
“You’re in big fucking trouble.”
“Not if it’s not microwaveable. At least not that I know of. On the fucking doormat? “Welcome to something wonderful”.
I did that interview with her.
Account Manager
“Quite alright, darling. Not a worry in the world.”
“Designate this table. You, Blaise. Mum and Jerry. Dad and Draco. Gran and Grampa. Zebb and Mr. Trandy. We can all be together for the dinner part?”
Are you sure?
Yeah I guess I agree. So the other seats would be 6-Ron, 6-Draco and I’ll keep the last 8. I can designate the extra two later, kind of like a floating seat.
. . . . . . . . . . .
Alright then, Harry is going to be very difficult for me. I will address you this way if you choose.
“Okay.”
“Dud?”
“Don’t make us guess.”
I kept Snabb with me in the house last night. He assisted me with the pecan chip cookies. There are two dozen so share!
What’s happened?
That would definitely be easier. UGH. I guess I’ll do that. Set it up early. You’ll join that chat then?
“Thank you.”
——————————————————————————
My hair is prettier than yours?
“Grayson’s loaded your things into the car. He’ll wait for us.”
What time is it?
I’m WOUNDED. I have no autonomy?
Draco.
I love you back!
“Teddy had it finished. I’ve hung your other painting in the nursery. Teddy say’s it’s part of your wedding gift from he and Jamie. I had the light above put in to spotlight it.”
“Jay and Jerry.”
“Is it? A preserved site?”
“Good! Now the toggle on the left down for your turn signal. Turn left here and then and do it again at the next intersection. We’ll continue all the way around and come back to the front courtyard, then I’ll show you how to park it. That button Dean installed on the right controls the gate.”
“Yeah, that’s a given.”
Can either of you get Lily in here?
“We can’t have that.”
Since you’re heading for a shower, I do need a guinea pig to test out the Snape shampoo!
“What do you mean? Mode of travel?”
6. Warm Regards, (
“I’m NOT! I’m just still surprised and really, really thankful. I was worried about these new people and walking in blind without knowing anything about them.”
“Ginny actually recommended me. I left Italy for London with my children. I have an ex too. I was a news writer in Venice.”
Grayson and Hugo are here. We're celebrating their engagement at the moment!
“NO TIME I’VE GOT CUSTOMERS!!!
“It’s not crazy. Every one of those ideas is a good one. Dammit, that’s not what I meant at all, Potter. Go back to the first one.”
“Trandy and Zebb aren’t Ravenclaws. Neither are Mr. and Mrs. Brick.”
He sat in on my arithmancy NEWT class. FOR FUN. He was probably 12!
“See? We’ll have this done in no time at all!”
Why are kneazles bad storytellers?
“Are you going to spend the night? I can ask Trandy to help put a room together.”
“Yes. Time.”
I’m going over the books for the apothecaries and contacting the managers today.
“They should be along in a few minutes.”
“It does?”
“Bacon.”
“My Godfather has some explaining to do.”
Meet me outside.
“I believe so. If I may, I’ll wrap it up.”
Yes. She’s calmed down a lot. Actually had a nap. Where are you now?
“Look at them. How? How can they look like that? Al had a freaking baby and now it’s like he’s never seen a day of it. He’s fucking buff as ever.”
“We need the fresh air.”
It's also not full of profanity for a change.
I think this is the best news I’ve received in all my years. I’m not sure you can know just how happy I am for you.
“And for him it’s obviously been you. In my own way it’s always been Harry. What’s wrong with that?”
“You can text a Goblin?”
“Albus and Harry do like to cook together. . . . Just let them go. It’s quite entertaining to watch. . . . And here is one of the ways Harry and Al differ, Al does not like to do the washing up. He want’s to make the mess and walk away. I want you to learn to say: “ZEBB says you have to help your dad clean up”. . . . Do not clean up after them.”
On it. Let me know when you’ve got that letter ready to go out?
Okay. I’m pretty sure I can do that pretty easily. Where?
(See the end of the chapter for
HARRY’S
It’s getting late, so I’ll send Snabb out with this and write more later. Thought you’d like to know.
“Yes really. I understand you wanted to buy some books and beads.”
“Lupin centre and . . .Okay what if we combined the wine shop, cooking school, coffee shop and we put that in next door to Groy’s bakery and open it up between the two at night for wine and coffee and piano and Groy’s desserts. Not just Groy, but have them bring in other performers too. . . maybe two nights a week to start? Then there’s the Chinese takeout, Groy’s and the wine shop all in a row. All the ground floor retail is filled in that section then and the entrance to the cooking school could be either from the side like the nightclubs or from the interior of the wine shop?. . . . . . Blaise would like it.”
(sic)
“You must come see the progress.”
Oh yes. I think Bill was the one who really made me question my sexuality.
“She has her own clock anymore.”
“Davey!”
“Yes, of course.”
“Yes you, Ronald, Draco and Agruella. . . . .are you planning a wedding over there?”
Mr. Harry J. Potter
“That it did.”
“Was I a spy?”
And then all of a sudden he’s smart because some idiot school gave him an honorary degree?
Tomorrow? At around 14:00?
“Mother you’ve outdone yourself.”
Grayson gets settled in.
I realized that I made a huge mistake and have been going back through chapters to fix it. I'd like to blame autocorrect and copy/paste but it was all mine. Let me know if you see horrible mistakes! I won't get offended.
Edit: must have been sleeping when I posted this. Minor format fix.
Thank Merlin. I feel so bad about taking you away but I don’t know what I’d do without you.
that’s my excuse anyway . . .Okay its not about the mattress or the damned sheets. We just want you to be here. You’re ready.”
Thank you! I’m pretty anxious for them to see!
“Yes. It’s Ed Sheeran.”
I’m going to head over there and see what’s available.
“Yes.”
“Before Harry and Draco move here you won’t have a lot of day to day responsibilities. You need to remember that you are not a housekeeper. . . . Don’t forget this. . . . Leave the housekeeping to Mr. Trandy, myself and the other staff.”
“Broccoli beef!”
OMFG REALLY? I’M IN CRISIS HERE AND YOU’RE FUCKING DROOLING OVER MY FUTURE FUCKING
You can ask, but he’s going to need assistance.
That will read: Heraald James Potter, Lord of Potter, Peverell, Black, Prince and Stinchcoumbe.
Good.
Louis Delacour-Weasley and
Not a prude. Teddy's a little mortified though.
“A pleasure to meet you Mr. Elliot.”
Are you cooking or should I order something?
If it works out I’ll want to have it done to the others.
“It’s not a secret. It’s a surprise! Different thing.”
“YES!”
Cool right?????
“No? I think we were caught up in other things.”
“I actually got that one! Alright lets head down there. Nice to meet you Decram.”
I might have to rethink this. That’s a lot of small details.
Readers are very excited with the developments in Knockturn. We will be on hand tomorrow to report.
Don’t do that meltdown.
That about sums it up. So we had some fun trashing the movie but it’s back to the birthday party drawing board! But not tonight. LOL.
"Who am I?"
I love you too, Hugo. I’ll let you know how it goes. I suppose I should call Mum?
“You’re really determined to put our Children and Grandchildren in this thing?”
“I love her. And she's still just as crazy for you as ever.”
“You have to bring Lucy down to see them!”
“So that’s the whole house. What do you think?”
Luna Lovegood-Longbottom
“Of course.”
“She’s been a little fussy this morning.”
_______________________________
“This is great. Thanks, dad!”
“Marry me?”
So what you’re saying is, Uncle Harry is basically running a fancy B&B. For the staff.
That’s your list.
—————————————
“And the sticks are super cheap, less than a half Knut.”
“I’m sorry if that made you uncomfortable.”
“Take a walk around. Have a look.”
_______________________________________
“quod facere”.”
Here’s a final list of the attendees. I originally tried to split this up into two lists: One for the general event and another for family to be included in the meeting/dinner.
Mr. Cheng? That’s the best one. They’ll deliver if you want.
Fleamont and Euphemia’s private one. Again, it really depends on how much of the really personal things you’re willing to share with the public, but I’m trying to focus on the initial exhibit and do something that’s not just throwing junk out on a shelf for people to gawk at.
What about flooring and paint for the kitchen?
I’ll be there.
“Well, we’d better just keep driving around for a while, otherwise they won’t believe I’ve properly instructed you.”
A little overprotective?
“Much!”
“Leave the phone on in case of an emergency, but turn the sound off?”
“What am I supposed to I do with it?”
“Yes. You’ll need a jacket. It’s warm but it’s always breezy.”
“Yes please!”
“Tapestry is through there. I don’t want to see it.”
“MUM OH!!!!”
“It’s like baby stars falling in the sunshine! It’s so pretty! There’s a rainbow!”
Norway, Real Estate Branch.
“When Poppy gives the word we’ll be there. But just Draco, your mum, Jerry and me at first. I promised the others can come later when you’re ready, but you’ll want some time after.”
It’s Hannah. It’s going to be fine.
Oh good grief You spooked me. . . Gawd
“More than luck. . . . .I need buttons replaced and an embellishment added to the shoes.”
Is this settled? Because I’ve got a shipment of the most awesome brooms to check in and the players are freaking out wanting to try them out.
I just tried texting my Dad. No answer either. Do you think they’re over there?
. . . . . . . . . .
“I’m good. All the way around then.”
I’m trying to get Hugo and Grayson in here. Hugo’s buzzing with news. I know it’s early! Good MORNING!
You’d like to know I’m sure :)
12 Grimmauld Place
“Alright. What can I do to help?”
U.S. Seattle, Real Estate Branch.
“Yes?”
What?
“I want to task Ted to research the magic of the portrait and ask him to paint the background for Decram’s new visiting spot at Grimmauld.”
“Thanks?”
—————————————————————————
Yeah it’s a student rite of passage and tradition now. If you’re a Hogwarts student it’s student discount at Ron and George’s shop.
“Oh this sounds good. Do they do shellfish? Harry likes mussels but we don’t see them often. At least not fresh ones.”
This is different. We forgot about two very important people and I feel like a total jerk.
“Um, no. There’s no unsticking spells in my magic bucket. This is Muggle paint remover.
“Okay that’s easy. So directly across the hall it looks like another study.”
“It’s a family tradition. All of our children have attended it. . . . Melody was it?”
“No guests today, just us.”
They bought it?
“They don’t?”
Miss Parks
Yes. Mr. Potter, I’ve dedicated my career to these duties. I have three assistants who are also designated exclusively to these accounts. As you can imagine they are quite complicated.
“It’s like we’re camping!”
“Where did you guys all come from?!”
“Yes. I’m going to have him consult on the specialty items.  Just some simple things to compliment the soap products . . . . . He’s such an impressive young man. He knows that Paris isn’t all there is to France or that France isn’t just Paris. He's agreed to work with me on procurement. We'll stay with the French theme but not take it too seriously. The accessories should be more entertaining and whimsical.”
Lily sure sounds like she likes him. Which is unusual because she’s well, Lily who only really likes dragons.
Harry, you’ve got this wrong. How can love be a distraction?
“Grampa? Can you fix it so he can come?”
I love you all even more than that.
Doopy
“You could do a privacy bubble over the whole thing.”
“Harry, you’ve got to have better security than a volunteer Auror.”
So that’s my analysis, and I’m sorry if it makes you angry. I stand by it.
“We can take them for coffee? That third button is Gringotts. Front steps. Walk to Fortescue's maybe?”
I’m speechless.
“That’s so cool.”
“I’m doing it. Draco, I think it’s time to get Gloria and Cel here. I’m in no shape to do it. Can you do it?”
“Are any of them signed?”
The short of it? Zebb proceeded to tell the rude fitter that the skirt was too short. Which it was, It needed to be at least ankle length and they had it just at almost above the knee and puffed out with damned tulle. The top half also really needed to be softened up with a scarf and they had fitted it with a rounded collar with a horrible neck bow. It resembled an old fashioned Muggle square dancing outfit. This is partially my fault because I thought the designer knew better and I hadn’t approved it in advance. Zebb went on an INCREDIBLE rant!
“Troupe Odeon, Les Animaux De La Fontaine.” That’s not American.”
I knew it.
Be prepared for suprises!
Speechless.
No. I’m really not. I’m over it.
“We thought you could ask Danika if he and Phil could bring the decks. Would Phil play some of his more casual music for the reception? You kids can end the day with some fun and us old people can go back downstairs for drinks and the later dinner? I know their sound system can fill this room.”
OH! That's different. What does this have to do with that horrid Mother? It’s Lucy right?
“Do you like Picasso? I’m not particularly fond of this.”
Oh Merlin. Really?!
Hold on.
very early to say . . . . . . . I’ll say Huffleravengryffinslyther for now. . . . . I’ll be much clearer when I see you very soon.”
“During the course of a battery of tests I came across a core bond. It was untethered at that time and so rare. It was impossible to tell where the bond was destined of course, but I had my assumptions. The core bond was definitely there.”
“UGH.”
Don’t forget Wizgamot planning meeting on Sat.
“Okay Dad, ask?”
“Merlin.”
Mr. Maeda.
“Ahh. pharmaceuticals. My husband is a doctor. Always seems to be badgered by pharmaceutical reps. . . .so you’re a sales representative? How long have you been in business with your brother?”
“Wow.”
“Draco you LIED to me! How did I not catch that!?! You're a TERRIBLE liar!”
“How? Our phones don't work in here.”
. . . . . . . . . .
“Can my birthday always be on parade day now?”
Thanks again for all your kind words of encouragement.
Okay, Dad then?
“Do you like pesto? We’re making something simple today.”
. . . . . . . . . .
“I know isn’t it cool?. . . .Draco took me down to his vault this morning. You should see the stuff we left behind.”
Reba’s
“Oh.”
“Yes. Most unworthy. The Lordship was rightfully passed to Sirius after Reggie and although you burned your precious fucking tapestry it didn’t mean shite. Same as my Aunt Andromeda here. You see the true heir chooses the successor and in this case that would be Sirius who rightfully chose his Godson Harry Potter to succeed him.
So what do you want done to the cottage?
“They’re not bad. They’re friendly. She tolerates them. It’s all very polite.”
Pub quiz! 22:00 on the patios.
“He takes after his Mum. So does my daughter Lily. I’m pretty sure you remember my other son Al from the big meeting at your manor. He’s got the Potter hair! Looks a lot like me?”
Pretty much anything you want? Most of it’s all just in storage. Boxes collecting dust.
Be careful what you wish for Weasel. Harry has his eye on that weird lawnmower museum!
You try imagining what you want. Concentrate on it and then cast it. But you have to imagine it really hard and you have to imagine it as magic or it won’t work.”
Oh that’s laughable. Nobody’s going to call him either Lord or Hadrian. That doesn't sound right anyway. It won't be that.
Plus, your dad now has BABIES on the brain. This is not a good combination.
“You did good Potter.”
“OH!”
As usual, I've edited it for mistakes and to clarify.
“I forgot about that. Kreacher is completely different now than he was back in this place. He actually looks like he’s de-aged a good 50 years or more. I almost didn’t recognize him when your Mum and I went to Hogwarts.”
“I’m not sure how that works.”
“An owl would be awesome.”
“Poppy?”
You’ve done a very good job with the Diagon merchants.
“How about we give it another ten?”
That would be great! How much time do you need? I’ll go talk with them and let them know what’s going on.
One week. Two at most.
She said that she wanted to be a doctor or healer at one time.
“Did you see?”
“Huh. Learn something new every day.”
“Amazing. Take it home with you!”
I’m excited about it.
What the hell? What do you expect? I want DETAILS, PARKINSON!
Edward Remus Lupin-Potter.
“That’s rumoured to be cold.”
They’ve even started a chat group. It’s pretty evenly split.
“Good plan.”
He’s sitting with me now. He’s my buddy. Name is Snabb. I’ve had him since I was 6. Got him when my Mum and I moved to the Isle of Man.
“We do if you want to try out that broom today.”
“Coffee grounds go here. I’m saving them for the worms. Now if you want hot water for tea just put the pot under here and turn this button. But I warn you it’s HOT.”
“Those huge ones?"
“Shepard’s pie, please?”
“They’re all quite old so it’s difficult to say . . . . . . They are all quite advanced. I’ll look it over closely later?”
“Oh. I’ve forgotten to put out the fortune cookies. Wait right here.”

“That was fucking awesome. . . . . She likes it. . . . . Does Aspen like Gramma’s handmade teething biscuits?? . . . . YES YOU DO . . . . .
Okay. 20 minutes?
“Come on!”
Sure. Any time before I go to pick up the boys at 15:30.
“He did?”
“Right on time. Are you ready?”
Wait. You intend to drive this automobile? Not just Grayson?
“The fucking wig? Gee thanks! I guess I really need it cut then. Or shave it off.”
. . . . .
Snape’s portrait. Alfred McCull cannot be found though. How did you find him to begin with?
“Yes. And they are very difficult to clean!”
“Astra can you watch the beef for about 10 minutes please.”
“Auntie Zebb is here but she say’s you have to cook the bacon and I’m not allowed.”
Your biscuits do look very tasty, but I’m still not sure. I have questions!”
“Tea, table, wine cellar, Trandy.”
Gringotts
“AAAAK!”
“Yes.”
That’s not cool!
“WHY?”
Today? When would be a good time?
Secured Owl Post To:
Gilpy
Harry, Draco and Narcissa begin the review of Grimmauld Place after the ritual to restore it to it's 1940 configuration is completed.
_______________________________________
Are you fucking kidding me? He would do it in a heartbeat.
So we could just look at them all at once and choose which to show? Or Louis could ask for a list in advance and you could bring together what he chooses from a list?
Okay, so we’ll do it this way. Harry you stand here with your back to the Wizengamot. You just look at me and I’ll give you the final count.
——————————————————————————
I’ve got to go now. Help Ron get his things together for the dinner.
Draco should be back in about 3 hours I’ve got a few.
I don’t really care to be honest, because it’s for Rosie and despite the political implications of the invite, Rosie and Jaydne REALLY like each other so everyone else can just fuck off. I’m not the Minister for this one, I’m a Mother.
“Green apple?”
“*” ."
“Cupids but no bows or arrows.”
Okay, I like that option better!
“Don’t think for a second that this will go unnoticed. How did you do it?”
“Just the Ravenclaws. . . . . they all volunteered and said what they wanted to do. I didn’t do that much really. Just organized things. I just had to order a few things.”
“Gregor that’s beautiful.”
Don’t freak out.
“I think so. But what I don’t get is how when Gareth dropped her off after he said that Luna had a full report on her magical abilities. Says she’s pretty advanced?”
First we make old Barnabas a very rich man. He’s agreed to one last day as publisher to make the announcement and transition. Skeeter and her spawn get escorted out of the building. Our new editor is waiting in the wings. She’s from Scotland and she’s GOOD. Jennifer Waters of the Wizards Daily Guardian. . . .Most of the photographers are OUT. They can apply for their jobs back if they sign an agreement and take a sensitivity training course from Luna. I’ve got the list. Every single one of those photographers from Jamie and Ted’s wedding. Also the ones from Ginny’s luncheon. And that guy following Hugo and Grayson around? He's got a surprise coming too.
Is that on your list? That’s not a question! He’s around here somewhere today, but I’m not going to subject him to talking to the press.
Harry are you okay?
“Oh YES.”
“Since when is tea a potion?”
“What is it?”
So now you remember that you’re Hugo’s date. When we do things like family functions you’re not my assistant. Separate the two. The only obligation you have is to enjoy yourself and hang out okay?
“I don’t hate roses. I don’t enjoy taking care of them. They’re perfectly fine in someone else’s garden. I’m sure they’re beautiful and smell exquisite right now too.”
#44 Grimmauld Place
Cauldron 20 minutes. Bring your others if available. Mine is!
“I’ve heard he’s very handsome."
“That’s not changed. It was always like that?”
“Creamsicle?”
Please remember this is an alternative universe and not in any way canon.
You’ve got to admit it’s going to be really awesome.
Below is the draft of the letter explaining the Non-Disclosure agreement. Let me know, I’ll be happy to make changes.
“Victoire, there’s someone I want you to meet. This is Mr. and Mrs. Mason. Grayson’s Mum, Gloria and her husband Cel.”
“Figures. At least they didn’t go after us.”
This one is a challenge, but it’s nearly done (again, marble). We’ve basically blown out the entire north wall and replaced it with glass. The window seat spans the whole length of the wall and is offset by about 30 cm to accommodate a ceiling to floor curtain, but then it made the exterior look weird so Seamus used a charm to make it look like the original house from the outside. Hope that’s okay. The charm should hold forever or until/if you want it changed.
“That does NOT sound very tasty.”
It’s not! And his hair. How did that happen?
“Liogell brought in the set up for the hurling pre-game parties.”
I’ll let Draco field this one!
Are you joking?!
“Jon! Are you having fun?”
“Probably. The headlines have already started being posted. Grimmauld is on total news lockdown! . . . . . . . . . so what’s next on your agenda, Harry?”
“Zebb in on it?”
“I can’t say that. It’s all pretty fantastic. But this is so awesome, Harry. This is a major piece of Wizard history that literally no-one has ever seen. It’s going to cause a major stir.”
“A prank is a joke.”
“I know. You haven’t had one like this in quite a while. Take your time . . . . . Come back to me slowly . . . . . Things were rumbling.”
You’re right.
“Yes so now your music can be sorted easier. Your favourites are here and you can add or delete songs from your main playlist. You want that new Jorja Smith release? There’s a new Grif too.”
“Yes. . . . . You’re the only one who’s ever been in here other than Draco or Liogell, and that’s only been recently. There’s these too. . . . . It’s not much. There was no time . . . . . . . the Aurors wouldn’t allow us to take anything more because they said it was still too dangerous. Turned out they were right too. In this box is a jumper of your dads, I found it on his armchair . . . . .cardigan . . . . . .  this is a necklace your Mum wore at some time. I don't recognize it but it was on a night table . . . . . might ask Andromeda about it.”
LLL: So now, everyone wants to know about your plans for the future. We know Scorpius is in potions healer research. Are you working toward any specific goal Scorpius?
“Okay Seamus just let it go!”
I’m opening up a chat room so we can discuss remodeling the cottage before we talk to the boys and then meet with Dean & Seamus. Just us three for now for planning? Because we have to get started.
“No, now the kids are looking forward to it.”
Oh. I think I remember that a little.
——————————————————————————
Mr. Harry J. Potter
Edward?
Yes. You can handle it though. If I didn’t think you could we wouldn’t be having this conversation. And this way you can have a little bit of a celebration.
The three of you do look cute in the red, but our sparkly under the ocean theme is far superior.
And Hagrid is bringing Coquette to pull it.
“Wow, they’re both out like a light. Isn’t he heavy?”
“Do you REALLY want to start a prank war with a Goblin? Think this through, Ron.”
Are you serious?
“Like an elevator?”
I agree. I’m still going to pout over it, but I agree. This is much better.
“That’s going to all be redone.”
—————————————
Park access will still be restricted while construction is under way.
I’ll try to get down there but I’m waiting for confirmation on the equipment. If it comes right away we can be up and running on Monday.
OMG GIVE ME BACK MY BABY!!!!
Maybe something short on Monday.
Oh yes he will. Al will wrestle her out of his greedy Grampa arms.
“Is it even clean?”
Yes and Yes. The student’s have fixed it so he can just talk into it and it writes what he says to the recipient. The kids say it automatically corrects what he says so the translation looks odd but they’re working on that issue. The elf is actually very accomplished. Works with the history professors.
“It’s more fun in here? You can’t say that you didn’t expect this. We’ll make them eat in the dining room.”
I can get my hands on it pretty quickly.
Draco Malfoy-Potter
. . . . . . . . . .
Is that the portrait watching TV? He looks just like you. I thought it was of you at first! He’s funny!
You know why.
No you really aren’t. We’re ordering Indian from Gynkhana, I’ll order you the Muntjac Biryani. Gin & Jerry have a room at the Mandarin. They’re not traveling tonight. If they can clear a schedule we can do the cottage tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow evening. 19:00. We’re free, I’ve already checked with Grayson and Sean.
SHOCKING!
She did throw paint at it and then used a freaking muggle hair dryer to push it around. Too fun.
I’ve put the bags back to normal. This is a lot of stuff!
Because “the vow” took me forever to concoct. And it’s funny as hell?
“The baby fireworks. . .That’s what we decided. We didn’t want you to get into trouble with the Muggle neighbors.”
“Why is that a rare ingredient?”
“I’d say you were lying again and that’s got Panic at the Disco on it that I could never figure how to erase.”
“One other thing . . . . . .
“So they closed it down because of the war?”
“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!”
“It’s not different for us I hope.”
“Grampa Hugs?”
“Okay, we can just view it from up there. Should I tell them where we’re going?”
I love you my Butterbean, Take care and write soon.
When Rita left with the brat they did look a little, well I’m not sure how to describe it. Paniked? Disturbed?
“How do we do it?”
Lucy and Dud have a lemonade stand set up in the park on Sundays. Actual lemonade. It’s fun. Trandy helps too. Dud makes it. It’s become their Sunday afternoon tradition. They hang out in their courtyard off the townhouse and pass out lemonade.
I want some hoodies and long sleeve t-shirts made up.
What does Draco have to say about this development?
D & S: Kitchen completion!
Wow. That’s beautiful! Did you make the pedestals?
RE: @Kesniton LMP
Edit: Spelling mistakes etc.
“I told you I’m not going to try to keep her in the house. I promise!”
“I believe that Harry would very much like to hold a conversation about his Grandmother with you. What is your name?”
Oh, trust me I. Will. Not. Tell. I nearly passed out when I saw that number. FISH. Over a million Muggle pounds on FISH!
Well, you can name it anything you want Hugo, but that’s the basics of it. You could use it as a dissertation or not but more importantly draft legislation that would eliminate the restrictions.
“Fun?”
“Shall we try?”
“It’s not completely tasteless. It’s just nasty.”
Groy has taken over the windows. I’m organizing your books in the study. It’s really looking good in the library. Everyone is here and Zebb is making lunch for us.
“I’m Al and this is my Husband, Scorp.”
“Jay???!!”
“It looks like Luna just made it yesterday, but yes that’s the real thing.”
“Agreed, we’ll be a distraction and it’s probably going to be quite loud. . . . . The Ravenclaws love a party.”
“Oh no. I’m all in now. Duck for Mum, Macho Man for Uncle Harry. . . . . who else?”
Number 14 Grimmauld Place,
“Alright, we’ll leave it at that!”

“Did I tell you I love you?”
“June Avery . . . . . .Class of . . . . . . 1983, HUFFLEPUFF!”
Lucy and I are freaking out. She’s trying to find something to wear. I’m up to my ears in lemon juice.
Can I at least watch the television? It’s still all hooked up from your Animal Crossing marathon.
Average overboard.
Don’t EVER say that to your siblings.
“Let’s talk about your family level. This is where you’re going to spend the majority of your time. First of all, you let Draco do whatever he wants with it. No complaints. You just nod your head and say yes to whatever he wants. I know you can do it. And you also know how beautiful the cottage is so you know it’s going to be excellent. Make that level your first priority. It’s going to be your private space. Only Trandy or myself will be allowed in there. Your privacy will be our priority. I will check in two times per week. You are no longer a slob so I don’t need to remind you to pick up after yourself. Write that down too. Do I need to remind you to pick up after yourself?”
DAMMIT!
“You’re going to loose Groy you know?”
“It’s happened. I really hadn’t anticipated it taking the path it did or being such a late night though.”
“That was lame, Ron.”
“Let’s try a different approach then. But you have to really relax and let me in. I can get into those boxes if I really want to but it will take time and a lot of concentration on my part. . . . I also know what I’m looking for now.”
Oh No.
“HA! Alright Grayson, we should get back for the meeting. Zebb and her sister set out a ton of food. I’ll bet you’re hungry? And you know, I’m sure they’ll send you back here with enough to feed an army . . . . Is Snabb fed? . . . . Okay lets go. Do you remember how to get back to the main house?”

"What did Harry do now?"
True. That would have been awkward. LOL.
Fundraiser:

I got him the WIZphone 12
“He chose it for you. He knows you much better than you think.”
Why? It’s a great place! I loved it.
And what the hell happened to the Aunt during the storm? Did she fall out of the house? Where did she go?
Good morning. You’re up very early.
Caudwell’s Castle, Oxford
Our readers may not know that changes have come to our honored publication. With the upcoming retirement of our publisher and other negotiations ongoing, more change is to come.
“Let’s get some food in you first Mister.”
“Well it’s a little cramped but we’ve got cake. Some snacks. . . .There’s ice cream . . . . .”
Open the wards Potter!
“I don’t want to cut it!”
It’s a madhouse!
“So now we have the four bedrooms. We’ll keep these two on the left. The floors are fine just clean them up. And we like the wide baseboards and door trims. The doors just need freshening up. Those are all fir and they can be lightened up a bit. We’ll change out all of the door hardware with a toggle instead of a knob. We can do a traditional seagrass wallpaper and clean up the existing fixtures. Bathrooms, same as the others. Balconies are fine. This second one is larger we can fit it out for a nursery. . . . .Those are then done.”
Seamus! I forgot about you and the floo. YES I’ll get you a key. I’ll give it to Grayson and he’ll have it for you Monday morning.
Jerry and crew will spent the day. Initial cleanup and set up.
Yes please. Nothing fancy.
So we’re the buffer for when the conversation goes downhill?
Yeah. They were totally in cahoots. Gin just confirmed it.
“Good job!”
Not sure how to reply?
Cool!
Gum powder?
“I want to hear it from Grayson.”
“Shite. Do you think Dec knows all this?”
Of course I will miss having you for our watercolour session. The idea to invite Albus to join me leaves me a little intimidated, but I’ll consider it.
“Of course I’m coming, but I’m not a neanderthal. I’d like to hang up my clothes and put these things in the kitchen first. You’re already wearing your shower attire. . . . oh, there’s a hook for your bathrobe out there now.”
“Let’s get down there.”
I could use some SON HUGS too.
Signed by Poppy Pomfrey who was the magical attendant at your birth. At home. I’m sure you’ve heard of Potter Cottage. Your Grandfather built it. You lived there for nearly 30 years. The paperwork is filed with the Magical birth registrar.
“CRAP! Draco’s going to freak out. What is it?”
“It’s set up for a recital.”
——————————————————————————
——————————————————————————
“OH MY GAWD!”
“I don’t have favourites.”
Hermione finally fill you in?
Scorp and Draco Plan
Louis and Gareth.
“Temperature seems just right to me.”
“It would be cool, Potter.”
“Is that a charm?”
“Okay first is for the Halloween party and third is for Christmas and holidays. Put it back to the first!”
What?!
That should be fairly simple.
“How are you always so cozy warm?”
Ok give it your best shot.
Karaoke.
Truly.
I. Just. Cant.
“All of that equipment is stored under the island. Grayson has a list for you with the incantations, but we really think what you’ll end up doing is thinking “I want my mixer” when you touch it and it will work.”
HARRY! It’s the whole family again!

“I forgot about Zebb and Seamus. I thought he was going to try to steal her away from me.”
“Yes, Harry. I do understand. We’ll get started on it right away. No tax in Iceland.”
This agreement, spearheaded by Luna Lovegood-Longbottom is now standard operating policy for The Prophet. Minor children will not be reported on without the explicit consent of a parent or guardian. For example. Before reporting on a Hogwarts sporting event, it must be cleared by the headmaster or headmistress before publication. Parents of students will be given the option as to whether or not they agree to have their children included in the coverage.
“Do you want to take a look up on the roof?”
I’m fantastic. I just need a minute.
“That portrait gallery is going away. Lucky for you. Those things get gabby. It needs new wallpaper. That staining and fading can’t be charmed or scrubbed out. The wainscot can be polished up. Again, teamwork and then general maintenance. That hall of toilets is ridiculous. They’re all in fine working condition though. So it can just be kept under a preservation charm that can be removed when you need it. How many charity functions are you planning?”
“. . . . . . .”
Someday. Just for fun I’d want to see.
“He has a question. But we came to see Snaab too. Go ahead Jon.”
REALLY???? That’s
Draco. You’ve got to see this. It’s unbelievable. There must have been at least 20 Elfs working on the place all night. She had the entire interior redone. Put up all of those chandeliers with that massive one in the entrance just as you walk in the door. Shows through all those windows from the street. The whole place is sparkling. It looks like a freaking jewelry box.
I’ve changed my mind again. Fuck the mail. I’ll message about the meeting and then I’m coming home. I need a rain shower before we go for dinner.
“Yes. We have successfully spent the day together doing nothing other than enjoying each other’s company.”
“Oh wow. . . . . she likes me!”
“But you cured him of it? Why would I believe this?”
Secured Owl Post To:
“Probably.”
I’m sure. We’ll just need to be a little stealthy about it. Maybe we can get an apparition point designated for the roof. I can still make portrays that will get us inside though. So that's an option too. Then we won’t have to deal with walking through the streets at all.
Eric and I can take her to see the dragons? Is that allowed?
“SCORP LOOK!”
“But. . . .”
COOL!
——————————————————————————
“You and the kids are going to give the Weasleys competition with all this black messy hair.”
Draco.
Hope you're having a great week.
. . . . . . . . . .
“Yes. But it’s not really a big deal. I mean it can be a fun party trick!”
“Rose?”
And no babies on the roof!”
“Mrs. Brick, It’s quite late now, I think I need to go sleep.”
Has anyone bothered to look at the time? It’s after midnight.
It’s confirmed. I’ve asked and explained the situation. We now have six first year students coming back for the summer session. They’re excited and happy to help!
“Needs bedding.
THE QUIBBLER
“I’ll do some sleuthing and see when and where they might want to go.”
So my coming down there might be a good distraction then. Nobody’s going to fucking ask to SMELL ME! I’d blast them with a fucking Weasley jinx.
In another time, perhaps you would have had one. As you well know.
“That you did Potter, and I love you right back more than you know.”
I really AM looking forward to it.
“They’re dry as FUCK, Draco! If it weren’t for the vanilla there would be no taste at all! Those poor owls are really slumming it!”
Of course it’s not weird. Why are you asking us? Shouldn’t you be asking Dad and Ted?
You’re welcome. Love you too kid.
Eins44?
Okay.
“Did I tell you I love you today?”
We can get you a driving license here if you want! I think there’s a test. Jerry has a Jeep and I’ve got cars in one of those vaults don’t I Draco?”
“Yes.”
“Hi.”
“You don’t know that.”
“If you want, there is the glassed area towards the street designated for vegetable gardening. You could plant the herbs there as well.”
Let’s not put a date on it yet? Let’s draw up a floor plan first. I have an initial idea but I’ll want Draco to help with that too.
“Did you see the MG? I’ve got an MG! Mine’s little though this one is called a Bull Nose Super Sports Salonette! Who named that thing? Try saying that fast three times.”
“Jamie?”
Rose and Luna are here with a photographer too. Luna say’s they’ll do something in the Quibbler now that the boutique is open. She’s lifted her embargo on covering family business. At least temporarily.
“Wow. This is cool.”
They used to have big dance parties there.
I would also really appreciate it if you would not address me with additional names.
“I have no idea. I need it though, I need to text the prime minister or someone about that cursed vase in the palace.”
We’re tying to decide which photo to vote for. Mione wants champagne toast and I’m rooting for boat snogging.
“We were so worried it was going to be a fiasco. Dreading it actually. . . .And we were prepared for it and willing to go through with it for you and gran. But this is . . . .”
“You blew up that stuff with Jerry on purpose didn’t you!”
Closed, but you can bring whoever you want as a petitioner.
Ha. Okay, throw those questions at me. We’ll see where this goes. Or how about I turn around and interview you? I have LOTS of questions that need to be answered.
I’ll ask Minnie when they get back. Might need to be approved by the Ministry too.
He wants to invite you to his daughter’s birthday celebration.
“The elusive elf of Prince Manor. . . . yes let’s do that. We should ask Sev for some more pointers. . . . . ”
Let’s do that.
Charles Weasley,
“. . . . . . .Keep an eye out for Winnifred! Okay I’ll let you go now. . . . . .”
Makes me angry too, to be honest.
“I brought your special soaps.”
“It’s time for us to make some decisions.”
“Geeeeez. Now What?!”
He’s qualified.
“Guest rooms?”
“Well if it isn’t Harry FUCKING Potter and Draco BLOODY FUCKING Malfoy each accompanied by a FUCKING owl.”
“As you should have. A four year old on a broom for merlins sake.”
You THINK????
It’s just an outfit. He looks awesome.
Will the Elf union let us do that?
“Wow. Cool!”
“Sometime, sure. I want Draco to see it now. Let me put this away. . . . . . .”
“It’s protected. And I won’t go that fast, just for you. A slow ride to the park and back.”
Naw, don’t do that. Talk to Pansy! If you’re really worried about it she has a jewelry retention charm.
“Their fucking wands.”
“Promise.”
Magic.
. . . . . . . . . . .
“A glitch would be irregularities in the background that would make your painting behave peculiarly.”
. . . . . . . . . .
“I can’t apparate. Don’t even make me try! I’ll splinch. Guaranteed!”
“What’s that?”
We do need music for the boutique though.
“Potter. You’ve got to stop doing that. It’s getting ridiculous and we need our sleep.”
“Hi Harry. Long time no see.”
Hmmm. You kids are up to something. I might need to investigate!
“You’ve been pranked by Severus Snape.”
“Coming down into this place always gives me the creeps.”
“Let’s head down to the vaults.”
Well, I’m coaching quidditch, I’m still writing the sports column for Witch Weekly.
“How do we do it?”
“The last one must be for the maintainance crew.”
“Too fast?”
“No he’s right the jacket is a little tight in the chest. . . . .needs an adjustment here. . . . . . a hair shorter I think too . . . . .
Chaos?
“No. Stop saying that. You just got caught up in all of the other things going on and it didn’t cross your mind. . . .It didn’t mine either. . . . but you know who’s it did? Jerry and Liogell. They’re like best buddies now.”
“Okay now look. You don’t have to like it.”
“Do we get to have a little bit of a Birthday party for you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Minerva McGonagall
“Yeah, I can see that. But you’ve even said before that you didn’t hate him.”
HOW???
“. . . . Just sitting on the bed. He’s reading Davey a book.”
“Anti-nausea potion. Not going to vomit again on my watch.”
“I changed them out. The old ones were a little harsh, and we added the ones under the cabinets.”
I guess nothing.
Years?
As adjunct we would like you to join Al and Nev at the main table, but we know you prefer to stay out and think it’s a distraction. Just know the option is available to you.
“Gallery!”
OMG He COOKS too?
“Actually we ALL get pampered all weekend at the poolside and have a campfire and a sauna and a lava heated soaking tub thing. Then we can all go for the fishing on Sunday morning and have breakfast on the beach.”
That’s the understatement.
“Just read it.”
What colors did you go with?
Okay.
Cake! For the main reception. We have to talk with Harry.
“Kiss me.”
“Wow. Everything is so light now. It’s almost blonde. Really shows off the grain.”
Not me, but I’ve got the new Remi Frankston novel staring at me.
Mr. J. Liogell
“What things?”
I don’t think that’s possible.
“Yes.
“It’s pretty big and I like Teddy’s paintings much more than that.”
“So then we move into the final sections. Three more.”
So I created this chat. Then I initiated the chat and it invited you onto page.
You can take any of these vehicles out at any time once we’ve guaranteed the safety of the vault. We can consider altering the ignition rune if it’s not compatible with Mr. Elliot’s magic.
They’re doing it. They’ve already set the dates. Sending out notices to the tenants next week and start construction the week after. I’m drafting the notice.
“What if I need an errand and Grayson needs some help? Hugo said he’d help!”
Oh good!
“How many people are in your group?”
LOL Harry. Hugo, we’ll meet up at my office early in the week and go over some of those missing details you’re looking for.
It’s an evil pattern.
Please ask him. So what do we do about the other staff?
“THANKS SO MUCH! You’re the best!”
She want’s to get started. Blaise thinks if people see activity in the storefront that it might develop interest in the abandoned Borgin and Burkes. She’s having the exterior worked on first.
. . . . . . . . . .
“Oh dear. That’s a pool.”
I’ve missed you. I don’t believe I’ve seen you in person since the Luncheon.

I thought you said that place was a rat’s nest and full of ghouls?!
“Most of these do in some way or another. Your Dad saw that one, but not lit. There are a couple others I’ve picked up that he hasn’t seen.”
Last one until next weekend. Hope you enjoy the randomness.
They’re going to be just perfect whatever they are I’m sure. This is not a competition. Will your boys really do fireworks?
“That would look nice and set off the stairs. Try it.”
Come on in. Just don’t touch ANYTHING.
Do we just let it slide then?
“Keep it simple. Wiltshire Manor. There isn’t another is there?”
“Gringott’s reception room.”
SIGH.
Something’s wrong.
You can?
Team Surfer Boys = Danika, Louis and Gareth.
“Yes. Definitely.”
6. Mr. Kreacher would like the “Marigold Yellow” velvet niche cushioning for each interment.
“Really.”
In an hour or two?
And you love watching him do it. I know. I’m going to go out and help.
Okay. I’ll do that when I come in next week. What “other” items?
You have no idea how much easier it is to just Accio and warm a bottle without disturbing the baby. . . .OR the other kids.
Should I be?
“Crazy Mouse. I can’t go unless you take me. You’ve got to be THIS tall, and I’m only THIS tall. I can’t go without YOU. You have to take me! PLEASE.”
“Explain to us this heritage situation.”
“How did you do this?”
NO KIDDING.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Give me ten kisses first.”
Dad has a pretty nice coffee machine, I’ll bet he’d let him use it, Just SAYING!
SM: . . .definitely not what Al and I originally imagined, because we were just going to go in, fill out the paperwork, stand before a guy with a wand and be done with it.
“Shall we ask them out to eat?”
“Another owl?”
“We’ll talk about it. Let Draco see them first.”
Three weeks away from the boys is going to be a stretch.
Union Restrictions.
“It all GLASS. It’s HUGE!”
Even then. Sounds cozy!
OH. You guys are screwed.
“Ask me anything.”
“I’m not sure Jon, you have to ask him. Come with me.”
“I’ll crash it!”
“Slow down, boys.”
“WHAT?! WHY?”
Glenborrodale,
“We’re still going to wait for the top floor to be done. Not just the conservatory.”
“Thought it would fit and go with the floors?”
“Of course, we’d be honoured.”
So you had a good time?
“It’s fine. I WILL demand your full attentions later though.”
“Like this?”
It’s on. I’ve forced the hibiscus into blooming. My greenhouse is looking fine!
“Could be a cure for something we don’t know about yet. Don’t discount it.”
“You’ll see. . . . .well, Teddy should we begin the process?”
I always have confidence in you and hoped that the right thing would turn up. You know how much I worry, so please try to write more often? This new position sounds just wonderful. I’m so excited for you and comforted to know that you have moved somewhere that sounds safe, comfortable and stable.
“Building is still here. You must have missed something. Hold on so I can go into another room. Lucy doesn’t need to hear this conversation.”
“Jeezuz Christ DAD!”
“I know! Can you believe it? I’m so happy for her.”
“Extra hugs today!”
“I actually want a copy of that cover for my office too.”
HUGO! Get up here. . . . .I want you to have five of the remaining twenty seven seats. Will you accept them and do you do it of your own free will?
“Potter, I’ve got my hands full, a lightening charm on our Grandson would be helpful.”
Do you have a copy of the purchasing contract?
friend and dragged me off to crayon land. The rest is history. You’re only a little weird with a weird memory thing.
Okay!
“What? It’s an honest question.”
“I like it well enough.”
“During an event alcoholic drinks can accidentally be spilled.”
We think Draco would like it, but if not, please bring a guest. Wizards box opens an hour early and refreshments are included.
Skeeter's Daughter Skeeta does not do her homework and is skewered in the comment section of her latest "article".

Dominique Delacour-Weasley,
Sweet. PARTY AT THE BEACH!!! BRING YOUR BROOMS.
When?

“I’d like you to just be yourself and say hello. Have a conversation if you’d like. Maybe we come up with something for when we have a fundraiser or party.”
Wow. This one sounds like it’s going to be a doozy.
“No?”
LOL. I’m sure she did!
The owl received a poppy seed kolache. Seemed to enjoy.
“I’ve perfected the wind and sunburn charm. Do you think for a second I’m letting anything ruin your skin?”
UGH! When?
“Now we string them together . . . . “quod facere in corde meo”.”
That would be great. Let me know if there are other things you’d like to take as well.
“Take a breath.”
Sunday works for Harry.
But there you go we’ve been together for I don’t know how many years now. Fifteen? More than that. You would know better. I love the man and want more than anything for him to marry me, but no. I know it will be a complete fiasco. I mean just being a couple will cause a (expletive) riot. And I love him Luna, you know this. And now just talking about it I’ve ruined your interview even MORE and if you publish this it would ruin Al and Scorps’ wedding.
“Probably. They’ll get over it pretty soon. We’re just a novelty to them for a few days.”
“Apparently they are both really nice. Grayson helped Mr. Brick with the radio. He’s trying a new station every day. Was not impressed with the shipping forecast. Liked Radio 3 so far.”
“So if we go out through the main doors over there we’re back in the main reception room. The lights are controlled from inside the moulding here. Same as the dining.”
UGH! It’s true though. I’ll just give all of my seats to Draco and wash my hands of the whole thing!
I like where this is going! That flat is disgusting.
Paisley barista.
“It’s creeping me out? She doesn’t do this at the manor . . . just apparate everywhere.”
Okay that’s an acceptable reaction.

Because Monday.
Alright, I have instructed Mindy and her staff to sweep the house for all of Lucius’ remaining personal effects, regardless of value. The remnants should perhaps be only a robe and a few random hair ribbons but we’ll see. Mindy was not happy to hear about that walking stick. I’ve invited her to stay and be witness to its demise. She may also join us for a beverage in celebration after.
“We’ll go again then! Back to the coaster queue.”
Still busy but seems to be getting less frantic then?
Minnie explains a few things.
——————————————————————————
“Woah.”
Draco and I are married now. Al and Scorp too. And they have a baby. We have a lot to catch up on. Coffee tomorrow? We can meet or you can come here if you’d like? I’ve moved also. We’re still in London but more central. If it’s the same flat you’re really almost in the same neighbourhood.
Owl Post
“Oh Merlin.”
“I’m telling you this in confidence. I have an air controlled freezing cabinet. I have enough pastry stored in advance for two hundred of those pies and it’s actually easier to handle after it’s been frozen. And it comes from the Elf market.”
We all do Louis. Gareth is special. Don’t fuck this up.
“NOPE! This is staying up all Autumn until I decorate for Halloween.”
“I know. Can you keep them safe?”

Potter Cottage(Fidelius)
Who was first?
Almost wish I’d been there to see it.
LOL SORRY!
Actually no? Because it’s not accidental, it’s focused. Much easier to predict.
“I’ll go. I’ve done this before!”
No, I’m just giving you my unvarnished opinion. Isn’t that what you asked for?
“Looks like the date went well!”
“No it’s fine. Just something that needs attention right away. I’ll tell you later, it might involve you at some point.”
Peru? How wonderful!
Are you sure? Because I’d like that.
I’m not worried about them. I’m worried about Me and Luna being separated from them. We see them nearly every day.
“You can’t change that.”
“Oh hell no. Void it, take back the house and sell it. What does Judy even do?”
We can do that. But it might be pretty late!
A day. I can schedule to have it ready on Monday. I can have the other two guys do the counters while Seamus is doing the courtyard in the morning.
I’ll be probably best at Sugarplum’s. I can sell sweets!
“Oh. It’s ON then Hugo! . . .Lizzo.”
“Of course!”
LLL: Okay boys, thanks for speaking with me today. I think we’ll stop here. I look forward to catching up with you at the wedding!
Hermione may as well be royalty in this household. Harry is around enough that the staff just play silly jokes on he and Draco. Ongoing and reciprocal joke war between staff and those two.
I’m always yours.”
“Yes.”
“No.”
You’ve been using it!
Today we speak with lovebirds Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy.
“Scarhead!”
. . . . . . . . . .
Well this is a whole new can of worms.
And neither of us ever said anything untruthful to either of you. You were both fucking dimwits. We just gave you a nudge in the right direction.
“Ummm okay first thing, I don’t care for you all standing in a line against the wall. Everyone take a seat in one of these lovely chairs on the patio. . . . Yes I’m serious. Please everyone take a seat and we’re going to have a conversation. . . . Second thing. Please don’t call me or anyone else who visits here “master” or “mistress”. I would prefer that you just call me Harry. If that’s too much for you call me Mr. Harry, but please never again use “master” to address me. . . . My partner is Draco. You can call him Draco, or Mr. Draco. Obviously it will take some time for us to adjust. . . . I want to thank you all for being here today. . . . The lodge looks wonderful.”

“Put her down for a nap a while ago. She’s been mostly good. Overall it’s been pretty quiet. We went down to the conservatory to visit Winston and Craig. Only one meltdown. She was hungry. She’ll be awake soon though and need changing.”
Well I don’t hear anything that I don’t like about him.
“How did it go?”
Which do you prefer?
“Got it.”
“Poppy, do you agree that the supplemental potion is acceptable?”
“That will bring out Scorp’s eyes. I love it. So much. Oh Merlin.”
Okay. Just let me know what you need. Love you.
“I’m kind of scared.”
Ron & Hermione at the Cat & Crown for dinner and drinks. 19:00?
Okay guys I’m closing this out! Love you all.
“I’m not going to ask you to tell any more tonight.”
“Well technically I’ll make it four then . . . . . . . . I love you, Draco.”
“It definitely is.”
LOL. Do it!
They won’t though. They’re not stupid!
“Actually Rose and Hugo’s place is great. Rose would love having us around I’m sure, but you and Draco around the corner? I’m not so sure.”
And we met for lunch a few times before Al started school.
_______________________________________
“Andi, this is Grayson Elliot, Harry’s assistant and Hugo’s . . . .?”
I’m going to need to staff it. Same contract as the rest.
——————————————————————————
What do I win?
SM: This was not as much of a surprise for us as for everyone else.
It’s Becks now?”
Build them a playground for the village. Like the one you had done at Grimmauld.
AP: I will do that, because it really is interesting, but I can’t explain it well enough. We can do that interview and include our mediwitch who specializes in this?
. . . . . . . . . .
“Oh she was NOT happy. What’s that?”
UGH. NO. With Lucy. You and Rose? I’m sorry it’s kind of an emergency and I can’t explain right now but it’s important.
And it’s spelled all to Merlin so small kids can’t get near it!
—————————————
“I blame her. She was awful! The only way to get her to leave Scorp alone was to snog him in front of everybody!”
“Shall we get started on that courtyard enclosure? Show me the glass in that kitchen.”
OMFG. You two. She’s just being honest. Harry, this is your own fault for bringing your private discussions with Draco into the main chat. DIMWIT. What did you expect?
“I do. I REALLY do. What about my regular school though?”
“DAVEY DID YOU SEE?! Grampa Harry has all the magic!”
“Teddy, it’s a proposal. I won’t go any further with it without your approval.”
I know!
“UGH. Even the Goblins can’t figure it out and it’s amazing.”
“Fair.”
“Does the Creepy have enough rooms to accommodate the potions people?”
Do I need all of you to approve of who I date?
“Far corner by the kitchens. Ruby and Zebb.”
_____________
“Well did you get that?”
I LOVE YOU MORE.
“Yeah, easy peasy. Take me on the Crazy Mouse!!!!”
“So I did want to show you the fish, but I REALLY wanted to show you this!"
Come to think of it, Draco should do his first. That’s only one seat and they won’t be too bothered by it.
Come home soon?
Yeah. So okay let’s let people know at the meeting, I’ll feel better. Oh and now Scorp says that Pansy is going to have to alter my wedding outfit!
“Nonsense. New spell, first try. . . . just takes a little longer. Try it next time with a right flick. You have better control over the temperature that way too. When I do it it’s just one big ball of flames.”
Shite is right. You’ve got wizards traveling worldwide to come see this thing!
Hey Al, what’s up? Is this a new chat?
A pair of low backed chairs from another era wait for Albus and Scorpius while James and Edward stand behind and place their hands on the shoulders of brothers. Brothers in blood, spirit and family.
“She says she’ll change not only the name of the manor, but her own name and drop Malfoy if we hyphenate ours when we get married.”
“Too sweet.”
“I don’t know that. I know that YOU, Teddy Lupin-Potter, used my wand from the time you were six. Your HUSBAND, used my wand too. This whole no wand until Hogwarts rule is Hippogriff excrement.”
“What the?”
“Yes. He’s now the owner of Sirius’ wand as well.”
Mr. Kreacher has been assisting the History professors as a liaison with the Elf community and is currently working with Professor Stiger on an extensive revision of his “History of Wizarding Travel” book. Did you know that apparition was originally taught to wizards from an Elf that had befriended a Gringotts Goblin?
That’s Horrific.
“He’s getting up super early in the morning for breakfast now.”
I believe Snape’s estate is entitled to sue for all of the profits from that piece of slander too. Can we sue ourselves now?
“You would do that?!
Dear Mr. Malfoy-Potter,
I don’t believe Dad is throwing up random wards in Diagon! That’s kind of cool.
Thanks.
——————————————————————————
SM: That’s true, it was always some dish where we had to learn to cut vegetables and herbs then cook on a stove. That was just a sneaky potions class!
OMG. Teddy you didn't tell him.
Can we all meet here and do it together?
—————————————
“How did you do that!”
“Jamie?!”
“Where?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes.”
“Old and ugly. We can go up there. Here, Coffee. I’ve got cream and sugar?”
——————————————————————————
“I told you. We have a LOT to catch up on. Let’s concentrate on Lucy first?”
I’m totally up for the “Charm Bank” and yes I’m afraid we’ve lost Al and Scorp.
Yes. It’s not very pretty.
“I like it. It’s pretty.”
Sound good to me.
You know how you said you were going to donate some of that furniture to charity?
——————————————————————————
Dud, it’s just for Lucy and her friends. It’s not a formal dinner or anything like that.
“Can anything be done with it? I don’t mind it being called a tea room but it should be somewhere a person would actually want to take tea!”
Let Draco do it for you!
“I swear I haven’t had time to explore this fucking house. It’s a new surprise every fucking day. I swear this wasn’t here before. It’s like a small field overlooking the muggle street!”
“Grampa Harry cooking?”
London
Not that we’ve seen.
I actually think it’s a good idea, no gifts. Limit it to cards?
Family just has to sign a page saying they won’t disclose the address or talk about anything that happens that day to anyone other than family in attendance. And no press of course other than Luna. And my traditional consequences clause.
Potter Industries. My original Potter inheritance. The hair potions! BRB
NO? I don’t think so?
Scone!
Are you fucking joking? Reba? CISSA? She didn’t tell me about this.
Now Miss Parks doesn’t want us to leave.
“Those are in there? They ARE ancient.”
THANK MERLIN.
SCORPY WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!
. . . . . . . . . .
“For us to get into the Quidditch uniforms so I can fit them properly. These won’t even remotely fit. If you could get these over your thighs it would be a good laugh for a minute, but . . . . . . . .”
Oh that’s right. How’s it going?
“Okay come look!”
“Grampa Harry needs hugs! He’s sad.”
“Thanks!”
Love it. I’ll bet Lils and Eric are buzzing!
this,
____________________________
I do feel like I’m holding everyone else back because I’m so cynical.
“Of course we do!”
“Draco, why aren’t you itching to get up there?”
"It’s just that this conversation is fucking BORING. And we’re all so predictable.”
I would think that you do not want to include the contents of the outbuildings? If you do, it is not an issue, just tell us which items you wish to retain.
“There will be an engagement when we move here. But NO freaking wedding for quite a while and we don’t want the extravagance.”
“Are you being obtuse on purpose?”
“I’m going to get tipsy on cognac and watch the kids have fun. Maybe chat with Ron and Hermione for a bit. Looks like most of the other adults have left or getting ready to head out.”
Are we being too pretentious?
Absolutely.
“I know what we’ll do. One of the guest level bedrooms. Once it’s finished we’ll put the TV in there. With the windows open there’s a beautiful view of the park too! Decram’s going to have his own room. I’ll even have a sign made for your door. You can stay anytime you’d like.”
”OH FUCK YOU JAMIE! FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU”
May I address the Wizengamot?
I’d be more concerned about the public reaction.
“I believe so.”
No Harry, it’s not your fault. I can’t say I’ve seen Elfs participate in a wedding party before. It would have not crossed anyones mind. The boys are going to love it!
Hey Uncle Dud.
“Don’t I know it.”
Mums agreements have Consequences!
Have a great Monday.
——————————————————————————
“Good! I really wouldn’t want you to forget.”
“Hello Mrs. Black.”
“It basically is I think.”
“NO. You’re going to like this. I’ve already read it.”
I think there’s 14 or 15 of us?
LOL. Call Lily. She’ll be happy to help Lucy out.
“How did Grandma Molly knit fucking jumper's already?! And they fit them!”
I won’t argue with you there.
“OH.”
“With the exception of the terrace, the property and grounds have always been left to their natural habitat. By design the home was meant to blend into the cliffs as much as possible. If you notice the exterior cladding matches to the colours of the rock.”
Right. Like Hermione is going to come over here with an Auror and have Harry fucking Potter arrested for letting his Grandson practice incendio in the dining room fireplace. Hey I need a favor too.
“What is it?”
“Any other honeymoon plans you’d like to make Draco?”
“You should do so again. I’ve spoken with Mr. Liogell when we went to the vault for the chandeliers. In this situation you could certainly use the assistance. They can use their magic to produce the items three times as fast. They only need to be instructed once. They won’t deviate from the original formulas and they will be very accurate. That is built in quality control. . . . that should be a temporary situation because I know it doesn't fit with long term plans, but it would get you through the backorder crisis. . . . . Once we’ve decided on the initial inventory we’ll review the products on a quarterly basis. I’ll hand over the day to day management to one of my assistants. Probably Ms. Farley. She’s good with retail. We should probably meet with Scorpius and discuss what products we want to launch in the upcoming quarter. Perhaps some new scents. . .Definitely another shampoo and conditioner set. I’m wondering if he would be interested in developing a body powder or a de-tangler spray. . . . ”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, maybe the Siddeley would be safe.”
Okay let’s say a bit sassy then.
“I’ll make them to match their fathers'.”
“Okay then.”
Jamie and Ted won’t give me grand babies.
I’ll tell you Harry, his Mum and I are in total shock here.
TOO CUTE!
“Please just call me Harry.”
——————————————————————————
Can Trandy come over here? I swear Zebb is losing her mind. Is it legal to give an Elf a calming draught?
“NO!”
“No. I want to go on it with you.”
“So this will be Trandy’s room.”
Woah. Really?
Yes. You’ve always got it Luna. But now there’s this paper trail of (expletive) news articles that are completely fabricated. Putting both Me and Harry as either a victim or the villain. When in reality we just came to a point that our family just comes first in every respect. We both needed to be happy in a different way. Both of us.
“Let’s just take a look then, we don’t have to get into the deep details tonight.”
“It’s just the polite way to address the issue. Children don’t need to be exposed to things of that nature at such a young age. That was the decision made by our church and the school.”
Not a problem. Want me to come and get her?
You know if she doesn’t like whatever she’ll just transfigure it into something she likes!
How much work does it need.
“Huh.”
“Uncle Harry, he’s going to absolutely love it.”
Rat. Mouse. Gerbil. NO.
14:00?
“I know.”
“Oh no.”
It’s okay. It’s my fault just as much for insisting we keep it a secret. I should know better.
Certainly. . . . Goodnight everyone!
“Hugo.”
“You’ve left marks again, Potter.”
“I believe we have a remix! We’re going to play after the conservatory tour!”
“Just like magic!!”
“REALLY?”
Just for fun. See you midweek.
“And Lily’s will also bring her to Gin and Jerry’s in Scotland. Eric’s will bring him to his parents home in New Zealand. I’ve been given permission.”
GO HARRY!!!
“How was your day with Hagrid anyhow? You didn’t say.”
“Okay let’s wander a bit then see if we can find some staff?”
“Jamie? Hey! I didn’t know you were coming.”
“He followed your handwritten instructions from the margins. You’re better than Snape and that potions book with a recipe.”
“Is that Celestina?”
“Inconceivable.”
“Where?”
“I didn’t know Blaise could sing.”
Just figured out that the wizard thing has been making it difficult to contact me cause I made a list a million years ago. I always thought it was the wards on the cottage.
You are interrupting a very important meeting, I’ll get back to you.
I feel like I’m not being a very good interview.
. . . . . . . . . .
“You know my type is YOU. SEE! Look. And another thing! How does the man not fucking AGE?”
SLKHE???
“Well hello. Does your Great Grandmother get a hug?”
See you on Wednesday!
“That’s an interesting way to describe it.”
——————————————————————————
Business or personal?
That’s not much of a boyfriend.
We have to give him first opportunity, I don’t think he’d be angry, but a more than a little disappointed. Did you see the one he did for James and Edward?
“Feeding you dessert. Open up.”
“No staff this time.”
And unless she’s just trolling muggles we’re all fucked.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“Jay, give me that license!”
“Well it wasn’t scary at all!”
Let’s just leave it. That’s their battle. Just as long as she gets put on notice about interfering with Dud’s custody.
“I’d like you to come with me to Gringotts.”
SIGH. Here we go again.
I said I’ve got rings! How about this?
“OH! You’re early. I wasn’t expecting you for at least another half hour. It's nice to finally meet you too!”
“Name it?”
“Things that we can put away and leave here for when we visit. There’s a lot of un-shrinking to do.”
Me too. Professor Stiger is going to have to revise again.
Yes. It makes sense. Both as an artifact of “Harry Potter” and historical. We would treat it right. Everything is going to be either behind ropes or glass. Protected so nothing can be touched.
Liar! You’ve already made one!
No. We will still be covering the park. I’ll do the fidelius removal on Monday evening. I’ll need you to be there for that. 17:00? We should revise the tenant letter and get it sent out right away though.
What do you know about Grayson Elliot?
“I am SURE!”
______________
So Grayson are you looking forward to working for our Dad?
You didn’t
I’d place a bet on it. He’s not been wrong yet.
Probably.
“This is awesome.”
Meet me in the front reception parlour. Floo’s open.
“Why didn’t you think of it first?!”
She’s going to need jeans, a jacket and wellies. It’s a hike through the woods. Tell her I’ll pick her up on your back porch in forty five minutes?
Alright, so if I wanted to consolidate all of the galleons into one account what would you say?
“But it’s all muggle.”
“Alright. . . . . . .”
“Why are you there?”
Harry
“I believe your favourite is the same as mine, but I may have been mistaken.”
Sorry I asked?
“At the top it extends out with a grated landing right out onto your roof. Just open the door. Do you like the glass or do you think it lets too much light in?”
Oh, Sorry. I’ll catch you later.
——————————————————————————
“Yeah, me either.”
“If you can get her out of the house for two nights. One full day.”
You’ll see it all later. I budgeted to have this part recorded with muggle webcams.
“Harry Potter’s Godson, Teddy Lupin. Who also happens to be married to Harry Potter’s other Son, James Potter. And I’m going to suggest you add an additional ticket in that letter so that James will come with him. Tell them it’s an apology for me being rude to him on air or make up some other bullshite.”
. . . . okay this shirt. . . . . .”
Just tell me your idea and I’ll see what can be done. Does this involve the Minister and Lucy’s Mother?
“Mix it up. Go to John Lewis for basics. . .take him to Covent Garden for some cool stuff. . . .they’ve got great trainers at Ellis Brigham.”
Yes I would. This is a good time because the kids are just now on a break.
“Alright I’ll just let it sit here for now.”
She’s hanging with me in the penthouse lab. I’ll send her home.
“Here’s a bedroom. . .not much to look at. Nice size, but the furnishings are pretty boring. What’s in the next one?”
Well that's Fucking Bullshite. I'm changing that too. Wizengamot is open to the public by default and only closed in an emergency.

“FIRE!”

“Not today Harry. We’re going out.”
“What do you think Harry?”
Maybe.
“Testing your broom. The brakes are good . . . . . He’ll probably come straight back down in a vertical dive at the highest speed and throw on the brakes when he hits the middle of the stands.”
“Luna couldn’t ride a broom at first. Couldn’t get the hang of it until Harry taught her this technique. It’s all about letting your mind tell the broom what you want. The broom just does it.”
“The building was recommended to me by those arseholes come to think of it.”

Any other ideas for the party then?
Done.
It’s going to be a long evening.
“A little like a gilded kneazle I’d say.”
“Just keep doing that and it will keep getting hotter a little bit at a time. To make it go back down it’s
“I’m glad we could make it happen.”
