Snape's face twisted into something monstrous. "DON'T CALL ME A COWARD-" He whipped his wand and Harry
He felt warmth around the wound, a touch came back wet and warm. But when he was able to clear his vision from the pain, Snape was gone.
Draco peered at the board. Blaise was paired with Granger, at least he wasn't going to accidentally call her a Mudblood and spark some kind of messy feud. The two may actually enjoy the period, both so annoyingly studious though Blaise was better at not acting like a know-it-all. Pansy was not so lucky, she was paired with the Weasel, but she could probably set him to chopping ingredients or something, she was good at getting her way. Draco was…..oh sweet Merlin.
"Severus..." Harry would have widened his eyes if he could have. Dumbledore was...pleading Snape. "Severus, please."
Ginny pressed a slip of paper into Draco's hand, watching carefully as the people passed them by. As soon as they did, her expression softened. "And how are you holding up, Draco?"
He should have known that wouldn't have worked. Draco felt Potter's calloused hand gently cup his face, guiding him to look at Potter again. He braced himself for the mocking but he was met with...care, a warm look that if he dared he could define as love. It heated Draco like the fire that burned in the Slytherin common room, and the shock of it all was most likely why he melted under it, leaning into Potter's hand.
Draco smiled back, most likely weakly. "I'm glad I came. Now, what is so important that you need to talk to us?"
Harry, frozen, watched the force of the spell strike Dumbledore and blast him out the window. For a moment, he looked suspended in the air, before he fell out of sight.
about Draco's situation, and she'd been remarkably sympathetic. She'd promised to help Draco talk to Dumbledore, see if they could stage something and get Draco's family to safety. Draco had been quite adamant that his mother should be given priority, should that come to importance. His father...Draco hated to say it, but his father was too far gone, too fanatic to be saved. Even when being explicitly threatened, he continued to believe that the Dark Lord wouldn't dispose of him, that he was fighting for a cause that was just, for someone...no, something, the Dark Lord was no longer human, of that Draco was sure, some
Which brought him back to the locket. Harry had been shattered when he realized the locket was a fake, it wasn't a Horcrux but a duplicate, left by some rogue Death Eater. Dumbledore had
Yes, Draco was early. Yes, he'd been eager to meet Harry so he'd gone a little bit earlier. Yes, he was slightly miffed that Harry wasn't there yet. Still, the worried looks on Hermione and Ron's faces gave Draco pause. Whatever this was....it might be dangerous.
Hermione scoffed. "There is a difference between a crush and...whatever you were doing with Malfoy, trust me. Besides, most likely he was the one who dosed you, we can't let you out and have him hurt you."
"Hey Draco!" Harry grinned. He noticed that Draco had his friends with him, Parkinson and Zabini, but they seemed to be not as...venomous as they usually were. Draco also had his….arm around Parkinson's waist.
with rage, throwing the Cloak off his shoulders. His vision went red, and he vaguely recognized lifting his wand.
Clearly, Draco hadn't been aware of the entirety of this plan, if the horrified look on his face before he'd disappeared was anything to go by.
come out of this, we both will, and we're coming out of this together." Draco tightened his hold around Harry, possessively. "You're not getting rid of me that easily."
Just then, Colin Creevey came running up to them. "Hey, hey Harry! Dumbledore came back and he sent a note for you."
that had his best interests in mind. His mother, at least, was cognizant of the situation. And slowly, Draco had seen, she was becoming more and more...disillusioned with the whole of pureblood society, though she wouldn't dare admit it. No, if they couldn't both be saved, Draco would want to get his mother out of there, Malfoy Manor be damned.
Luna sidled up to Harry, who wrapped his arm around her, smiling at her softly. Luna smiled back, leaning into him, while Ginny walked off to scrounge for rocks to skip on the lake.
when my mother decided she'd had enough with him. She didn't have the mercy that she had with her other husbands, killing them quickly with poison. She tells me to this day that he was the only man she came close to loving, but that's a bloody lie. If she did, she wouldn't have pushed him away while still giving him the bloody fucking potion. He died slowly, painfully, and she
"We're more than happy to just lay here and stare into the sky with you. I'm sure Luna can tell us about some kind of creature, or we can talk Quidditch, or lay in silence." Ginny chuckled. "Or, you could tell us what's going on inside that head of yours."
Professor Sprout had been really happy to receive Draco's results. She didn't question why he'd dropped it, they just picked up where they'd left off and for that Draco was grateful. They discussed for an hour or so, and for that blissful hour Draco didn't have to think about Harry or tomorrow or anything but Herbology and potions.
Draco sighed. "Yes, darling, that's your blood. Now open your mouth." Hagrid had returned, handing something to Draco which he poured into Harry's mouth. It didn't taste bad, it had the metallic tang of blood but was otherwise quite pleasant. Almost like cherries, not cherry flavouring but fresh cherries right off a tree. Harry had never seen a cherry tree, but he'd quite like to. He'd love to see how the pink blossoms looked in Draco's hair-
what I think about you, Weasley." There wasn't as much bite in Draco's words, though, not as much as there used to be. Neither in Weasley's for that matter. As far as the pureblood supremacist part....working this closely on a combined goal with Hermione Granger of all people had….shifted Draco's feelings on that front. He still had sincere grievances. They no longer celebrated
not the headspace he needed to be in right now. "When a handsome bloke flirts with you and kisses you, its natural to reciprocate. I wouldn't think
Like Atlas, they carried the weight of their worlds on their shoulders, and they could do nothing but weep and bear it.
Potter was, surprisingly, there, though he looked under the weather. His head was on the desk, and the Weasel and Granger were even closer to him than usual. Once Draco sat down the two kept shooting him looks. The Weasel glared at him, which was usual, but Granger was much more..cold, appraising. It was concerning, especially with his….position as well as Granger's ability with magic.  Draco shrugged, keeping his attention on Pansy. They wouldn't try anything, not with Snape around. Draco did a double take at the desk. Snape? Why was he here?
Harry laughed, turning to grin at Ginny, and heard the grass rustle again, this time on the other side of him. He turned and saw Luna smile at him, dreamy as always. Her platinum hair fanned across the grass and Harry's smile faltered as he remembered running his fingers through platinum hair just like it, though while Luna always smelled of grass and trees and nature, that hair had smelled like...vanilla, coffee, a hint of some expensive cologne.
"That...depends on whether the person I feel for wants them." Harry's voice was low, and Draco's heart skipped a beat. He
To their credit, Weasley and Hermione had been rather supportive. Hermione especially, with checking in with him before and after the meetings they had with Dumbledore. She wasn't aware of...the whole plan, that was between Dumbledore and himself, but she knew enough to know that Harry was just one of many things weighing on his shoulders at the moment. Overall, she seemed….resigned. Apparently, it wasn't uncommon for Harry to draw away when faced with emotional stress, and one had to just...wait for him to come back. Unless you were in Draco's position, and you had to satisfy yourself from watching Harry from afar.
There was always someone by him. Hermione, Ron, he was pretty sure Ginny and Luna had come once or twice, and always Madam Pomfrey with some potion he had to take. It felt like he'd laid here forever, sleep a tantalizing poison, being awake too painful to consider.
Draco picked up the locket that Harry had thrown across the room with an angry shout. It had snapped open, the paper inside falling out.
Harry wiped a tear out of his eye with his pinkie, still chuckling. "Draco, there is nothing, and I promise,
In the midst of laughing, Harry realized that Ginny and Luna had solved a dilemma he'd been pondering over for the last week in under an hour. Truly, they were...amazing.
" Right before he saw Dumbledore's wand flying end over end over the castle wall, glinting a sickly green by the light of the Dark Mark, Harry felt his every muscle freeze, as if he'd become a marble statue. He couldn't move or speak, he could only breathe and observe, helpless.
Draco's breath faltering was all the confirmation Harry needed. He stepped back, eyes watering as he looked up to the ceiling.
too gone. This would be a problem later, but Draco could sincerely see no way out. Perhaps it would be easier to break it off when Harry himself didn't…. Draco closed his eyes, taking in a sharp breath. Once he regained his composure, he turned to face Hermione.
Harry got up. "That's not going to happen. I'm not going to nor am I going to let anyone hurt him, and I feel
Draco just snarled. He turned his head towards the two brooms, now discarded on the floor by Dumbledore's feet, then to Dumbledore. Dumbledore simply tilted his head to the side, about where Harry was standing, and Draco seemed to...nod?
Draco was visibly shaking, and despite the pain Harry was feeling at Draco's betrayal he wanted nothing more now than to comfort him.
Harry knew things had gone horribly wrong when he saw the Dark Mark over Hogwarts. As they flew back to the castle on Madam Rosmerta's brooms, Harry felt his heart racing. Dumbledore was weaker now, maybe so weak he would not be able to fend off the attack. The Order was here, they should have been able to fight off a handful of Death Eaters
"Good luck, Harry!" Luna gave him one last smile then turned to gaze at the lake, her usual dreamy expression drifting across her face.
The jealousy he was feeling was probably the biggest indicator that Harry was under a spell. Usually he'd be fine with it but now....now
When Harry looked back at him, Draco felt like he was back in that classroom. There was the same warmth, the same care, the same….love. The world seemed to melt away around them, Draco could only focus on Harry and as Harry stepped closer, Draco felt his breath quicken.
He jumped out of bed, quickly brushing out as many wrinkles as he could from his robe. He ran to the library, but they weren't there. Shit, where would they be? The potions lab, maybe. No, that was too obvious, too open. Of course! Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, that's where they brewed. He took all the shortcuts, stumbling into the room. Yes, there were Hermione and Draco, leaning over a steaming cauldron.
like years to Draco, but he wasn't just going to tell Harry that. Knowing him, he'd take it as a personal failure and try to make Draco feel better. He didn't want Harry's pity.
hate you right now. And I...I don't think I want to, and I don't know if thats the potion saying that or me." Harry ran a hand through his hair. "I...I
Draco stepped into the common room and right into Pansy's arms. He leaned into her embrace, let her lead him to the couch, let her stroke through his hair as his body was racked with silent sobs. It felt like hours passed before Draco was handed off to Blaise, who guided him gently to his bed.
Har-Potter didn't come into the Great Hall for breakfast. Draco expected as much, he'd seen the way Potter had reacted, that would take a while to get over. Pansy was….oddly quiet though, and Blaise was outright shunning him. They didn't have any classes with the Gryffindors that day, but Potter didn't come in for
he was kissing. The realization blew Harry's eyes wide, and he recoiled slightly from the force of it.
Draco sighed. "Because….because I was scared. Of how you made me feel, of...what that would mean for the future, for us. I thought I was...sparing you, sparing myself if I...pushed you away. Both my and your friends explained to me how thick I was being and… and I realized I missed you."
Draco carefully freed his arms, allowing Harry to scooch closer. Luckily, he was right handed, so he could continue work as his left arm wrapped around Harry. He put his quill down, though, in order to turn and place a soft kiss to Harry's head. He wasn't risking any more thoughts of rejection, not after what happened last time. "Hello there, Harry."
in the Weasel's arms as he was carried away. He turned to Pansy, smirking. "I think there should be a betting pool." He raised a hand for air quotes, the other wrapped around Pansy. "'How long before Harry Potter falls unconscious again?' My money is on 5 minute intervals."
? Perhaps the Sorting Hat had known that a Slytherin Ginny would have overthrown the Ministry of Magic by third year and for the safety of the wizarding world placed her in Gryffindor.
"Sabotage the- Oh sweet Merlin, Draco, you are as thick as a Cauldron Cake sometimes." Pansy huffed and dragged a now confused Draco out.
Evan knows so because he has nothing else to stare into as his body shudders with the aftereffects of waves of intense torture. Time after time after time. His lord had not been pleased. Oh not pleased at all. His missing fingernails can attest to that.
Harry hums, "I keep learning all these funny things about you. You're french. Oh my god, this explains stuff." then he fails to elaborate what those “stuff” really consisted of.
As he struggles to put on a shirt with his aching shoulder, an itch makes itself known in his wrist, smothered by the pain of heartbreak from before. Upon being acknowledged, it quickly turns to a stinging pain.
each other. Harry is suffering and Draco is gaslighting him. He has to tell him. Could he tell him? No, no, no he can’t do that to Harry.
He has written about fifty lines by now, and his hand is burning fiercely. His robe sleeve is also bloody. He briefly ponders wiping his hand on her hot pink table cloth, how many detentions would that result in?
Draco wants to get out of the barn and as far away from that rusty fucking nail as possible. He wants to shake Harry awake but if the nail couldn’t do it, how the fuck could he. His ears are ringing and he can not think anymore. He keeps dragging Harry until they’re back on the hay and sitting atop Draco’s cloak.
He sees him and compares that sordid image with the Harry in front of him now, the one who wouldn't care whether Draco was a slug or a random shell just lying about, the one with witty humour and shaking hands. The one who almost died under Draco's watch.
“It’s you who’s lurking in a girls’ bathroom like a ghost,” Malfoy says, turning his wand over and over in his long fingers.
"We're not taking that risk," Remus drops Harry's trunk on the bed and starts throwing Tonks's folded piles haphazardly into Harry's already messy trunk.
The expression on his face seems to disgust Aunt Petunia more. "Don't look at me like that," she snaps.
Crickets and tiny night owls interrupt the sound of his steps onto the crispy grass and despite being mildly repelled by insects, an aversion he has had since early childhood, Harry doesn't mind the thought of close proximity to them in the slightest. He just needs to find the stream, and then get back to Draco, to help him.
He walks, feigning ignorance for about two floors down, and turns a corner and waits instead of going forward, and when she turns too, he speaks, grabbing her forearm to keep her from bolting, delighting in the small spark of satisfaction when Pansy jumps. This conversation has been long overdue.
Fuck fine. Draco wants to scream with how not fine it is. They can’t use magic, they don’t have food or water, and Tattershall seems worlds away.
And then, he hears the unmistakable sound of a lock clicking open. He jerks up, hand automatically reaching for his wand. Doesn't matter what the man said, getting expelled from Hogwarts won't matter much if he were dead.
Twinky returns, only an hour later to take the bowl away with a quiet apology, and Harry lets her. He's sprawled next to Draco, his eyes drooping with exhaustion and his limbs shaking in earnest in spite of his apathetic mood.
Harry grabs his hand again and it all stalls to a halt in Draco's head. The curse words vanish and the panic ebbs, he looks at Harry.
Draco's hands shake as he retrieves the clothing and slowly closes the lid again. He stumbles back to Harry and the bag.
He thinks of before. Before everything went wrong, "You were so kind to me, Sirius. Do you remember? All those nights, when I cried myself to sleep…"
"And you've been having detentions with that woman for over a month, two, and she made you use the Quill every time?" Harry nods. "Why didn't you go to Poppy? This needed to he reported."
"Why don't Ron and Hermione show you to your room?" she says and then raises her voice. "You're bunking with Ron, and Nymphadora kindly deposited your trunk there already." she squeezes his shoulders and Harry nods, feeling mildly guilty that he's upsetting her.
Harry subconsciously feels his eyebrows rise before he shrugs. "Okay. Do you want me to pack you a plate to go, sir?" Harry might have made a bit too much, and he knows that Draco doesn't like to have the same food twice in a day if possible. Harry could put it away for later, but honestly, the man looks as if he needs it, and now that Harry has vented off a bit and gotten everything off his chest, he's feeling more amiable to the idea of being kinder to Snape.
One didn't have to be a genius to assume what someone like Mad-Eye Moody would do to the son of a known Death Eater. And he's been here when Draco was
The blond groans once more and then frowns, as if bothered by a fly. Harry presses the back of his hand to his forehead and then as modestly as he can manage, sneaks a glance through Draco’s unbuttoned shirt. The slashes are red and inflamed. Of course they are, they’re infected.
“You didn’t force me into helping me. We both know how ridiculous that sounds. You helped me because I let you. And we’re here because I didn’t end it when I was meant to do so,”
It sickens him. The mere idea sickens him and Harry wants to cry. He doesn't, he keeps cleaning the wound and pointedly starts thinking about something else.
Pomona scowls, the expression out of place on the usually gentle-mannered woman, "I don't think he can be blamed for that. That woman is intolerable!"
She watches as the door closes behind the last couple, and then slowly turns to Ron, a smile spreading over her face, "We did it. Oh my God, we're actually doing this."
"I know, Draco,” he says, and his voice is soft, “but you should at least try them. It wouldn't do you any harm and it might actually lessen the scarring."
Even though he's not aware of the cause yet, he cannot let it overwhelm him, the first rule of survival is adapting, and Harry adapts, whether the restlessness likes it or not.
"Okay." He puts the muffin inside the bag, and then turns to the garbage can again, Draco feels as if he might vomit any second. "You can look away," Harry warns, carefully folds the sleeve of his sweater back, and puts his shaking hand back in again.
"I saw it." Severus blinks. Once. And Potter swallows before continuing, as if the words are clawing their way out. "I… did it. I think I killed Mr. Malfoy. And tortured… I tortured--"
“Cannot do anything right, and I know from experience. Potter’s muggle relatives for instance,” there’s a crunching against gravel as Rosier steps closer to them. “Or rather two slabs of fat and a sack of bones, wriggling little creatures didn’t even have time to open their gobs before I blew them up. Do you hear that Potter? How does that make you feel?”
“Fucking finally.” He growled as he launched himself at the other man, crushing their lips together in a messy, raw battle of lips, tongues and teeth.
Making quick work of the flies, Draco shoved down both jeans and pants, then started placing small kisses on Harry’s hips while he teased Harry’s prick with gentle touches of his fingers.
Draco didn’t have to be told twice. With a fast snap of his hips he pulled out almost all the way and pushed back in hard, making them both slide upwards on the bed.
Potter suddenly pushes me away, but just enough to look me in the eyes, I take in his appearance, his blown pupils, flushed skin, dishevelled hair, ragged breathing. He’s so fucking hot.
The first time Harry had seen the scars it had been maybe a year before they’d started dating. Back from a particularly gruesome raid, they had decided to spend the night drinking and trying to forget the horrible things they had witnessed. Back at Harry’s place Draco had taken a shower to get rid of the grime of the workday and had foolishly forgotten to bring a change of clothes with him, which was why a few minutes later he’d walked into Harry’s bedroom with a towel wrapped around his hips, asking for something he could borrow.
Draco watched as every Auror in the bullpen listened to his every word, he really enjoyed speaking to an audience, it was second nature for him to hold the undivided attention of a room, which coupled with a healthy dose of love for teaching, made him an excellent lecturer.
Draco wasn’t a fool, he knew perfectly well that most of the Department still distrusted him and only a few had been able to look past his mistakes and see the real Draco. He was also aware that his position as Deputy Head Auror, although he was more than qualified for the role, had been mostly due to Kingsley promoting Harry and subsequently having had to promote Draco as well in order to not split their successful partnership. But Draco had worked hard and he was good, very good, maybe not as brave or magically powerful as Harry, but he was smart and resourceful, he was an asset in the Department for his combined knowledge of Dark Arts and Potions, making him one of the prime consultants in every major case, not to mention that he wasn’t half bad at offensive and defensive magic, he was more than able to hold his own in a duel, which he had demonstrated several times in the past.
“Fuck.” Potter groans as I start sliding down and, when his cock hits my prostate, I let out a loud yelp and start moving faster, grinding my hips in a circular motion that has me seeing stars and Potter losing control. He suddenly snaps his hips up as I come down to meet him and we moan in unison. The pain is now long gone, there’s only incredible pleasure and I can’t get enough of it. I remove my hands from Potter’s chest and place them behind my back, gaining more leverage to raise my hips as Potter pistons in and out of me, nailing my prostate with every single thrust.
Suddenly, his cheeks were separated and something wet traced a line form the juncture of his spine down to the back of his balls. Harry keened at the sensation.
Malfoy must have known that arguing with Harry when he wanted something was a losing battle and with a reluctant sigh, answered his question.
Potter lets out a happy hum and bends down to rub Py’s little head, giving me undisclosed view of his perfect ass.
“What’s relevant right now though, is what came from those actions, the Wizengamot of that time implemented the laws according to the new requirements, but those laws only state that
Now Potter is all grown up, his shoulder have broadened, his muscles are way more defined, his thighs look like they could crush me and I would gladly let them.
“Aww, poor Draco didn’t sleep to make badges to insult his archenemy, what should we do? Call an ambulance? Child protection?” Harry mocked.
And…I’m lost in my head again. Great, Potter must think I’ve lost the plot, but when I look at him he’s still looking at
By the time Potter has three fingers inside me, I’m a blabbering sobbing mess, begging for Merlin knows what. Potter looks at me and he must see that I’m on the verge of complete and utter destruction, because he crooks his fingers and stabs my prostate spot on. The stimulation is too much, he must have teased and pleasured me for almost an hour now and I’ve reached my limit, I come with a shattered wail all over my stomach and Potter keeps abusing my prostate as my body shudders, prolonging the sweet, sweet agony.
Potter’s hand halts his movement as he turns to look at me, incredulous, still bent down though, which is nice. “You called your cat Grumpy?”
They lay embraced in bed for a bit, both thinking at the life that they were leaving and the one they were going to start, back where everything had begun, but this time on the same side, with no prejudice, no hate, no war or house colours.
I throw my head back on the pillow, all strength having left my body, Potter’s tongue inside me is to die for. The man certainly knows how to work it and I’m the lucky recipient of his skills.
When he stills and moves away, I whine pathetically and he smirks. I stay pressed to the door catching my breath and trying to gain some sort of composure as he walks to the bed.
He had been so used to his Sectumsempra scars that he hadn’t even thought about them when he’d decided to walk around shirtless, they were part of him as much as his mark was or any other scar he had acquired on the job, they told the story of who he was, mistakes and all, a boy who had started on the wrong path but had managed to turn around and make a fine man out of himself, he was proud of his scars in a way, they reminded him of just how far he had come from the scared and helpless boy who had tried to crucio an innocent student in a bathroom.
Harry moved his hand to Draco’s hair as a moan escaped him when Draco found a particularly sensitive point.
The fuming expression on Marchbanks was priceless, Draco would have to show his memory to Harry and they could both have a laugh at the idiot’s expenses.
He swallows and, even in the dim moonlight coming through the window, we’re so close that I can see his pupils dilate.
The night after the raid, Harry had looked at Draco with the same soft smile, eyes filled with love.
“Yeah, so we went mad looking for the damn thing all around Diagon Alley because it was sold-out everywhere and then we finally found it and she went on and on for weeks about the quality and the sustainability of the brand and the texture of the thing or something else. In short, she loved it.”
Harry licked his lips, which wasn’t missed by Draco, who did the same. The stayed locked in each other’s gaze for a moment before the need of feeling their bodies connect became too much to ignore.
The fight had been strenuous, they had been heavily outnumbered, but most of the brewers had been easily dealt with, leaving only the bosses and their security. Harry and Draco had taken on two or more duels at the same time to allow the rookies the chance to deal with the less experienced fighters and they had finally managed to incapacitate everyone just as the backup started to arrive.
Harry would do something exceptionally risky, like running without backup in the middle of a fight, and successfully carry out his mission, only to come back to Headquarters and having to hear the hour-long dressing-down the Head Auror always bestowed upon him about regulations, code of conduct and proper behaviour.
Harry was also the best at understanding the motives behind people’s actions, Draco never bothered with them, to him the mystery was solved when the evidence pointed to the culprit, he didn’t need to know the reasons, his job was solving the puzzle, but Harry always insisted on knowing the drive behind the action and was the best at getting confessions from difficult suspects because he took the time to understand them. Draco, on the other hand, made always sure to have a foolproof case, leaving a signed confession a bonus, but not essential.
It wasn’t that Harry was a hermit or didn’t like to go out and have fun, he was an Auror, he met people every day, people that wouldn’t think twice about engaging in a particular kind of fun with him. That was the problem though, wasn’t it? He could have a line of adoring fans ready to sleep with him, if he just said the word, but did he want that? No.
Draco’s cock was flushed a pretty pink, with the head an angry red, it was about as long as Harry’s, but slimmer and slightly curved to the right. It was beautiful and Harry’s to worship.
Draco moved languidly up and down the length in his mouth, paying special attention to the throbbing vein on the underside and teasing the slit every time he came up for air.
It took only a few minutes before Harry was hopelessly panting and moaning, both hands shoved in Draco’s white locks and pulling with almost too much force.
Harry and Draco had welcomed the chance, one with more enthusiasm than the other. Draco was at least comforted by the fact that when he wouldn’t have to deal with children, he would have a whole lab where he could conduct his researches and experiments in peace, which he hadn’t been allowed to do while in the corps.
Draco came back with a vial of clear substance in his hand, Harry supposed it to be his own home-brewed lube, which made sense, since Draco was a Potions Master.
Free from impediments, Harry’s mouth found one of his nipples and the wet tip of his tongue started tracing it. Draco shivered at the light touch, his back arching on its own to get more. Harry chuckled and brought his hand to pinch the other nipple, while he nipped at the first, sucking it into his mouth and releasing it at regular intervals, alternating between licking, kissing and biting, driving Draco positively mad with want. When Draco thought he couldn’t take it anymore, Harry switched to the other nipple, giving it the same attention as Draco mewled and squirmed on the bed.
“They had their fun, a few years ago, when I came out. They went on for weeks about how I was disappointing the female population. They even tried to accuse me of breaking Ginny’s heart, leading her to quit playing with the Harpies, although at the time she was already married to Neville and she quit because she was pregnant with their first daughter. It was fucking unbelievable.”
“How stupid can you be to force Harry Potter to leave? That man has never back down from anything in the eighteen years I’ve known him, not even Voldemort and the threat of his own death could deter him from doing what he wanted to do, but you, you did it.”
I don’t know how much time passes, but when Potter finally reaches the waistband of my boxers, I’m reduced to an incoherent puddle of moaning goo. I don’t know where I am, I don’t know who I am, I just know that I don’t want this to stop and, if in the next minute someone doesn’t pay attention to my cock, it’s gonna fall off.
Harry hadn’t uttered a word, but was slowly turning his head, eyes scanning the room. When they found Draco’s they stopped and waited, a question in his eyes that only Draco could read.
She stopped in her tracks when she saw all the Aurors standing still and looking at her. She assessed the situation, eyes moving from Harry in the middle of the room, to the pile of ashes on the floor, the badge on the table, Robards, whose face had slowly but surely become a deep shade of red, Draco causally leaning against the wall and twirling Harry’s wand between his fingers and back to Harry. She arched a delicate eyebrow.
They stayed in a heap on the floor as they both caught their breaths and when Draco looked up at his fiancé, he smiled at the goofy and sated smile he was sporting.
Exactly. You take out your tightest pair of jeans, (the ones that make your arse look like it’s a fucking sculpture), wear the short-sleeved black t-shirt that hugs your lean frame, outlining all you lightly-defined muscles and style your hair in that ‘just shagged, but ready for more’ look that you know that, combined with a thin line of black eyeliner around your grey eyes, will make heads turn left and right.
They would rise and shine as bright as the Sun, because the world was theirs to own and conquer and they were more than ready to start.
closer. When did Potter move? How long has he been standing in front of me? I’m not sure, but judging from the smirk pulling at his lips, (and oh, why have I never noticed those lips?) I must have been staring at him for more than socially acceptable.
“Hmm, I thought so.” He mumbled, almost as if he was pondering what shirt colour he should pick or what wine he should buy. He regarded the uniform for a few moments, eyes unreadable, then with a wave of his hand he set the whole thing on fire, leaving behind a small pile of ash on the ground.
I kneel on the floor and see his eyes widen in excitement. I gently part his legs and run my hands up and down his thighs, coming dangerously close to the bulge under the denim, but never touching it. Potter’s breathing quickens and he hisses when I tease him, but his eyes never leave me, nor does he ask me to get on with it. Despite his sounds being deliriously good to hear, I’m too impatient to keep up the teasing any longer, I grab him through his trousers and he grunts.
“I-I just wanted to know what you were doing tonight.” Harry replied. Which wasn’t far from the truth.
His expression darkens “Don’t you dare. That ass is mine.” He states with such conviction that my hole clenches on its own at being so possessively claimed.
The Aurors in the room stared, surprised by the casual display of wandless magic and the blatant disrespect Harry was showing.
“Ah yes. Well you see, the wards were first implemented in the Middle Ages, when the new building of the Ministry was built, they had originally meant to place them only around the holding cells and the courtrooms, basically where criminals were supposed to be wandering the Ministry, but after one too many escapes in which a felon had gotten hold of a wand and made a run for freedom, they decided to completely engulf the Ministry in a bubble of anti-apparition wards.

“Now, as I was saying, Potter hasn’t acted outside the law, simply because there isn’t any law that forbids civilians from apparating from the Ministry.”
When they had gotten together, Draco had vowed to show every day how much Harry was worth to him, but seventeen years of belittlement couldn’t easily be erased and there were times like this, when Harry still got worked up about something, panicking because he didn’t think he deserved something or he thought he’d done something wrong and was dreading the consequences. In those occasions, Draco had learned that the best solution was to stop Harry’s rambling before it got too far and developed in a full panic attack and try to change the subject, after reassuring him that he had done nothing wrong and everything would be ok.
He turned to find Robards several shades paler than moments before and the other Aurors watching warily.
Harry placed his hand on Draco’s chest, feeling the man’s heartbeat under his fingers, it was strong and steady and he let the pace lull him into a half-asleep state.
“I’ve broken as many rules as Potter has, why shouldn’t I be fired?” he asked while starting to unbutton his uniform.
Both Draco and Harry had been restless, they knew that if they could get inside, the information they would gather could be essential to closing the case, and they had hardly managed to keep their covers and not barge in wands blazing.
He relaxed his throat and jaw, making sure to keep breathing through his nose, when the head of Draco’s cock hit the back of his throat, he fought against his gag-reflex and pushed down harder, making it slip down his throat until his nose was nestled in Draco’s pubic hair, then he stopped and kept still.
As Malfoy closed the door behind himself, Harry took a look around, the apartment was a replica of Harry’s own, but it also wasn’t. This place looked like it had come straight out of an interior designer magazine. The walls in the living room were a dark grey, while the flooring, if Harry was not mistaken, was marble, white with grey veining the same shade of the walls, which was echoed in the grey couch that dominated the room and in front of which stood a low table with a glass countertop and steel legs. On the countertop a lone beer bottle stood on a black coaster. Underneath both couch and table, a thick white carpet covered the floor. Scattered around the room, on the white furniture, were placed grey, black, white and gold ornaments, along with a few photographs and the odd potted plant. The main attraction of the room though, was the TV cabinet. It was against the wall, in front of the couch, its base was made of white wood and glass with a modern design and on top of it was the biggest TV Harry had ever seen outside of shopping centres and cinemas. It was huge and was currently showing the football match Harry had previously skipped on his own TV.
I know I’m gaping like a fish out of water, do I care? Yes. Can I move my face muscles to change that? No, I’m too shocked.
There is not a single Auror here, who can claim to be half-decent, that has never bent the rules a bit, we all know that sometimes the results outweigh the risks.”
Both Draco and Harry had been removed from the serial murders they had been investigating and had been ordered to focus entirely on the potions case. They had been a bit miffed about it, in their opinion, people getting killed should have the priority over illegal drugs, and removing both Deputy Head Aurors from an active case of that relevance didn’t seem like a good move, but they couldn’t contradict a direct order from their boss, so they had left their files to another pair of Aurors and had gotten to work.
“Finally understood what you did, have you?” he drawled gaining Robards attention and everyone else’s once more.
Harry hadn’t seemed to be of the same opinion, as he had been about to hand Draco some of his clothes he had frozen on the spot and had gone white as a sheet, before breaking in an apologizing blabbering mess with tears streaming down his eyes. Draco had hugged and held him until he’d calmed down and had told him that whatever had happened between them in the past was just that, the past and that he had forgiven Harry for his mistake and didn’t and would never hold it against him. He had explained to Harry how the scars where a reminder of who he had been and what he should strive to be.
He applied more suction as he slowly slid down the shaft, alternating between sucking hard and using his tongue to massage every inch of Draco’s cock he could reach, welcoming it in the warm, moist heat of his mouth.
On the other hand, Draco was fundamental in the Department and having to replace him would mean, for Robards, having to look for someone with the same knowledge as Draco in the fields of Potions, Dark Arts and Law, which there weren’t many around, and that at the same time had done the extensive training the Auror program required, which brought the already small number of individuals down to none.
I nod. “The concealer was a big hit last year, if she liked that, she’ll probably go ecstatic with the one that’s going to come out at the end of this year.
“Well, he was a Christmas present from Pansy five years ago and, even as a kitten, he looked like this, all fluffy with the grumpiest face I had ever seen on an animal, he reminded me of my grandfather Abraxas, who used to scowl and frown a lot in my youth. I didn’t want to call him Abraxas, so I called him Grumpy.”
The stimulation was too much and Harry came with a shout of Draco’s name, thick ropes of white cum gathered on the already soaked sheets, in stark contrast with the black material and Harry might have enjoyed the sight, had he been half-coherent, instead, he was so lost in his orgasm euphoria that he almost missed when Draco shuddered behind him and with a drawn-out moan came inside Harry, flooding his channel with his hot seed and making Harry shiver at the additional stimulation.
I keep stimulating him for a while, attacking alternatively one nipple and the other, while with my mouth I switch between teasing licks, hard sucking and fast moving up and down Potter’s magnificent cock. All throughout, Potter keeps grunting, groaning and moaning and the sounds go straight to my own member, which has been left unattended and is now painfully hard and pushing against my zipper.
Draco had almost huffed at loud. Like there was any chance that he would say no to spending the rest of his life with the man he had loved since he’d known what love was.
Either way, Draco knew it was a matter of minutes before someone would come knocking on their door to inform them that Robards wanted to see one or both of them.
Harry held his hands palm up, showing that he indeed didn’t have a wand anymore, though everyone had seen him throwing it, so it was just for show.
Seeing as there was nothing bad happening, Hermione started heading down the corridor but she stopped before leaving the room.
If his jaw gets any lower, it’ll fall to the floor. “But…but Hermione has researched the company, she’s never mentioned you.”
I’m too far gone to even understand what I’ve just said, but it seems to kick-start Potter into action and, in a flash, my knees are pushed against my chest and a warm, wet tongue is probing at my hole.
The next time they’d stopped, it had been Harry who broke the kiss, just enough to summon a box from his room. The small black box had sailed through the air and landed in Harry’s open palm. Making quick work of the lid, Harry had presented Draco with the ring with a hopeful look in his eyes. Draco had stared mesmerized at the ring, taking it out of the box and placing it on his finger, where it had sat like it had been there his whole life. From that day on, Draco had always carried it on himself, in a hidden pocket at work, flaunting it in front of their friends when they got together.
They stood together for a while, it could have been hours, but probably was only minutes, breathing together and just feeling each other. When Draco deemed the impending crisis averted, he turned Harry in his arms and placed the softest kiss on his lips, moving then back to look him in the eyes, arms coming up to cradle the back of his head.
I turn around and Potter is standing straight and looking at me with smouldering eyes, my breath gets caught in my throat.
He wiped tears from his eyes and taking a deep breath levelled Robards with a calm and collected gaze, the one he adopted during lectures.
You see, when you work for Pansy and she not-so-subtly, instead rather directly, makes you notice that you are too tired lately and that your frustration is harming
The sound that left Draco was in the middle between an animalist growl and a shout, it made Harry moan in response and his cock twitch in his pants, which had become uncomfortably tight.
A man who literally gave his life to save the world and in return got scorn and reproachful remarks from people who shouldn’t even have been here.” He gave a pointed glance at Marchbanks.
There he was, usual snarky Malfoy. Harry couldn’t help but grin, though he must have looked stupid in that moment. He didn’t care.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Good to know that you’re still as inarticulate as ever, but if you don’t get to the point in the next five seconds, I’ll magically slam the door shut, with or without your foot there.”
Draco dropped into his seat with an exhausted sigh, on the other side of the office, Harry mirrored him.
Placing my hands on his chest, I slowly lift my hips, feeling Potter’s dick slide inside my walls, my rim gripping the length, not wanting to let it go. There’s pain, yes, but the pleasure is so much more.
He steadfastly ignored the voice in his head that told him that he knew exactly why he wasn’t looking forward to another empty encounter in the dark hallways of a club and that the reason had nothing to do with the unbelievably fit man next door. Of course, he could try to argue with his brain, but it was always a futile attempt.
Harry looked around the room, almost like he was trying to impress every detail in his memory, having apparently gotten his fill, he turned one last time to Draco, gave a small nod and a smile and, turning on his feet he disapparated with a loud crack.
“Thanks Malfoy.” He smirked back at the lust-filled look he received from the blond. “I guess I won’t need it anymore, will I?” there was a mischievous spark behind those bottle green eyes and Draco knew he was going to do something dramatic.
You’d think that having the Saviour of the world testify in your favour at your trial would be a sign that maybe you aren’t a monster. Yeah, no such luck.
Forcing his throat to relax, he slowly descended on the considerable length, while one of his hands came up to fondle Harry’s balls and perineum.
Every restraint they had, snapped when they saw all three presumed heads of the operations exit a muggle limousine and stroll inside the building.
Draco went back to his report, but before he’d had the chance of even touch the quill to the parchment, the sound of a door being loudly slammed close echoed across the floor, attracting him and apparently every other Auror in the bullpen, that was incidentally, right outside the Heads’ offices, including Draco and Harry’s.
He slid down Draco’s legs and kneeled on the carpet between them when bending down was getting too uncomfortable, he continued his work, biting and kissing, leaving the occasion love-bite until he reached the waistband of Draco’s dress pants, which he traced with the point of his tongue, making Draco shudder.
As he went down, he paid special attention to Draco’s nipples, making the man shudder with soft kisses and moan with bites and licks. He went on only when each nipple was hard and glistening with saliva.
He looks around as if expecting her to step out of the crowd, which of course she doesn’t, she’s at home probably getting woken up by her screaming baby daughter Lisa at the moment. That girl, my goddaughter, is such a delight, but she has some powerful lungs for such a tiny body.
“Yeah just great.” Draco drawled “I can’t wait to be around a bunch of snot-nosed children and being forced to interact with them.”
As we kiss, I push my hips down, rubbing Potter’s hardness against my crack and he moans into my mouth, I swallow the sound and start grinding on him. My cock jerks, newly interested and I move with more vigour against Potter’s body, binging our erections together and feeling them glide on each other. The first touch of our arousals has us both gasping, but it’s not enough. After Potter’s skilful rimming and fingering, I’m deliciously stretched, but disturbingly empty. Luckily for me, there’s a simple solution to my affliction.
When Draco was fully sheathed inside him, they let out matching groans. Harry could sense Draco’s struggle with keeping still in the slight tremors of his muscles and the ragged hot breath fanning his neck.
Holding Harry tight to make him feel that he wasn’t alone was a major contributor in helping him calm down, so Draco tightened his arms in an almost vice-like grip and felt Harry’s heartbeat against his chest slow down to match his.
failed a single mission in ten years of service, you tried to stop him from doing his job at the best of his abilities?
We’re both close, I can feel my balls tighten and draw up against my body the need to touch my cock is overwhelming, but if I don’t use both of my arms to keep myself up, I’ll fall down, which complicates the situation.
They moved to the bedroom at top speed and Harry might have taken the time to admire the beautiful décor, if he hadn’t been in such a hurry to get fucked.
Harry’s whole body was shaking, from Draco’s hard thrusts, from the effort of pushing back, from the sheer pleasure coursing through his veins, alighting every nerve ending and flooding his mind with bliss.
Since they worked together, their success rate was the same, but they knew that they each contributed to different sides of the job, which was fine by them, since they both got to do what they liked best.
It’s not usually this visible, in the months immediately after snake-face’s death, the mark faded to a thin white scar that almost totally blends with my unusually pale complexion, but under the strobe lights of the club, the glossy scar tissue is put in stark contrast to the smooth skin of my forearm. The muggles like it, they think it’s ‘dope’ whatever that might mean. I’m not exactly ashamed of it, not anymore. Don’t get me wrong, I still hate everything it represents, but if aging has thought me anything, is that you need to learn to live with your mistakes, if you don’t want them to be your demise. Still, the first time a bloke started licking it, I freaked out and ran for the hills, I’m still not completely comfortable with having attention brought to it, I usually try to keep it covered, I never go out with my arms bare, except for the club, here it’s too hot for long sleeves or jackets, unfortunately, it’s also the place where it stands out the most. Nothing I can do about it though, glamours are useless against a scar made with dark magic, only dark magic can counter dark magic, and I’ve sworn I’ll never ever use it again in my life. The mark is a punishment, a constant reminder of who I’ve been and who I want, no, need to be, it’ll stay with me until the end.
Still, the situation was beginning to be a little too uncomfortable for Draco’s liking and Harry, finally down from the orgasm high, noticed it too.
He berated himself for letting Harry get worked up in the first place, he, more than anyone, knew how much Harry was terrified of disappointing others and making mistakes. Draco had been outraged the first time Harry had told him about his family and the way they’d treated him and only two very green and pleading eyes had stopped him from tracking down those assholes and show them what freaks were actually like. Draco had worked hard to change his misconceptions about muggles and had come to the realization that there were good and bad people in both the wizarding and the muggle world, but he shouldn’t generalize and hate all muggles just because they didn’t have magic. But those muggles, oh Draco had never wanted to hurt someone so badly in his life, they had completely and utterly destroyed Harry, they had made him believe that he was worth nothing, that he was useless and a freak and a monster and no one would ever love him. They had never showed him kindness and affection, leaving him touch-starved and alone. It was no surprise to Draco, after discovering all that, that Harry always threw himself head first in every dangerous situation If you’re told since the beginning that your life isn’t worth living, sometime during those years you start to believe it yourself, and when faced with the choice of risking your life to save someone else’s, it’s rather easy to discard your safety, since you think so little of yourself in the first place.
“I’m so sorry.” Harry murmured against Draco’s shoulder, once he’d calmed down and the tears had stopped flowing.
He smiled genuinely, not at Robards, but at the thought of how he would get to occupy his newly freed time. Oh, he and Harry were going to have fun.
are not allowed to keep a wand on themselves, said wand has either to be left at the admission desk in the Atrium or guarded by an
You could almost see the gears turning behind Robards’ eyes as he came to the same conclusion as Draco.
At that, both of Draco’s eyebrows rose in surprise, before his face hardened. “And why, pray tell, would you be interested in what I do inside the confines of my own home?” Draco asked defensively.
There is no mistaking his expression, I’ve seen it before, on the face of my past lovers, it’s heat, hunger, desire. It’s undisguised want, pure lust.
Potter, the angel that he is, doesn’t push me to start moving, instead, he rubs his hands up and down my thighs, easing the tension that has gathered there during my descent. I wish all lovers were this considerate with their partners.
The poorly brewed draughts had been replaced by innovative concoctions that ranged from hallucinogenic substances to barely safe sleeping draughts, some of which had sent several people into a coma, though there hadn’t been any casualties, yet.
Not wasting any time he had thrown himself in Harry’s arms, snogging the living daylights out of him and then some. When they had finally separated to get some much needed air, Draco had smiled fondly at Harry.
Harry bent down to trace each white line with his mouth, kissing, licking, biting, slowly washing away years of guilt and pain and replacing them with love.
Potter is a sight to behold, panting on my bed like he’s just run a marathon. It doesn’t seem like he’ll be able to move anytime soon and I look smugly at him.
Over the years though, they had come to the silent agreement that the reckless and frankly stupidly heroic gestures were left to Harry, while Draco followed him, covering his back and cursing all the way. It worked and they were both happy with it, their bosses, not so much, which was why Draco found himself in this position in the first place, facing a wordless Robards, waiting for an answer he knew he would not get.
They both seemed to be on the same line of thought, because Draco put his hands under the hem of Harry’s t-shirt and pulled up, revealing toned caramel skin. He caressed Harry’s abs and pectorals with light fingers, making Harry shudder and groan.
“So the next time I have the chance to catch another gangster, killer or dark Lord, what should I do, wait for the bloody paperwork to be signed and risk the criminal getting free?” he asked incredulously.
Back at the Ministry they had gone straight to their shared office and now here they were, sighing and sinking comfortably in their chairs.
So here I am, because Pansy Parkinson is not a witch you want to disappoint. Ever. I learnt that the hard way, I’m not keen on repeating the experience.
“Oh, I believe I can think of a thing or two, in fact, why don’t I show you?” he said and started making his way down Harry’s neck, kissing, biting and soothing all the way to his Adam’s apple and back.
“Do you think I haven’t tried?” he laughs “Merlin I’ve tried and tried and tried, no one wants me, they want Harry Potter, the hero, the Auror, the one on the magazines. I’m not that person, I don’t want to be with someone who looks at me and sees
and getting so into it that he’d started shouting at the TV that was mind-boggling to Harry. Not that he didn’t believe that Malfoy had changed and distanced himself from his old prejudiced views, but it was a long way from believing that the man didn’t hate muggles to hear him happily cheer them on, even if they couldn’t hear him.
It was amazing what effect a single word could have on Draco, as the man writhed before him, Harry vowed to find out every single one of Draco’s weaknesses and used them to make him squirm with pleasure.
He couldn’t help his reaction at his boss’ words, he laughed. A full belly laugh that left him gasping for air and fall right back into a fit of giggles.
When they had gotten engaged they had set the date of the wedding for the August of two years after, leaving them both time to organize everything and sort out their jobs, they had eventually decided to hand in their resignations in June and enjoy the summer together, free of responsibilities, besides making the final touches to the wedding.
As Draco left his office, he took notice of the situation. Harry was angrily pacing the middle of the circular space, the others giving him a wide berth while watching from the sidelines, they knew they were in for some kind of confrontation and were waiting for the ball to drop.
How long had Malfoy been watching him? If Harry had been embarrassed by being caught staring, he would have blushed as red as the blood/ketchup stain on his shirt, but he wasn’t. He wasn’t in the least embarrassed, because in those alluring grey eyes there wasn’t a hint of anger or revulsion, there was only hunger, hunger that, Harry knew, was mirrored in his own eyes.
He licks his lips and I follow the movement with my eyes, then go back to staring into the green pools that are being progressively swallowed by black.
If someone could attest to how much Harry really was worth, it was Draco. Every time Harry had intercepted a spell meant for him, pushed him out of the way of a killing curse, taken a curse for him spending days in the hospital instead of him. Every time he had stayed way past office hours to try and solve a case, every long stakeout they had spent together, every night they had fallen asleep on each other’s couches because they had brought their work home, even though each time they swore not to do it again. Every time Harry had been there for Draco and Draco had been there for him.
As soon as we’re inside the door, Potter slams it shut and pushes me against it, my back hits the door hard, but I don’t feel any pain as I’m too focused on Potter, his mouth on mine, his hands holding me still, one of his thighs between my legs, rubbing against my hardness in the most delicious way.
Draco moved away to retrieve something from his bedside table and Harry was left admiring the man’s body. He hadn’t expected those sharp clothes to be hiding so many muscles, but Draco’s form was impeccable, he wasn’t bulky, but he had managed to maintain his lithe seeker build from Quidditch training, with a compact layer of muscles all over his body. He was slender, but he radiated power, like he could still kill you with just a touch.
He looks good when he laughs. I find myself smiling at the sight and I immediately blush. Merlin I’m so easily embarrassed by my own actions.
Robards for his part, didn’t seem to know what to say, or if he should say anything in the first place. The fact that Harry was openly defying him might have been cause for a disciplinary action, but since Harry had quite publicly announced his resignation, and there wasn’t a law that stated that you couldn’t be snarky with the Head Auror, he couldn’t actually do anything besides stand there and watch.
Neither Harry nor Draco were in the condition to go on with the teasing any longer and Harry didn’t waste time in engulfing the head of Draco’s cock in his mouth. Draco’s hands flew to Harry’s hair, gripping the raven strands and holding tightly as he let out a loud moan.
At the same time, though the need to reconnect our lips is strong, I now have the chance to see Potter’s bare torso for the first time, and Merlin, what a sight.
He took the two scrolls he had kept out and levitated them to Robards, whose jaw had been hanging open for a while along with that of some of his colleagues.
“Maybe, maybe not. There’s a fine line between love and hate after all, it is entirely possible that I had a huge crush on you and my closeted brain just couldn’t accept it.”
But still, here I am, sitting in a club, staring at people dancing and having fun while wallowing in my misery. It’s not like I don’t have options, I’ve noticed at least six guys looking at me with hungry eyes, but they all had something wrong. Too short, too pale, too blond, to skinny, … you get the idea.
That afternoon shenanigans had begun when they had gotten a lead about a possible brewing factory connected to the
Satisfied with his work, Harry made his way down Draco’s abdomen, placing kisses along the silvery scars littering his skin in crisscross patterns.
The whole Department knew that Marchbanks was a mediocre Auror at best, he was teased even by the rookies, some of which, Draco had to admit, were better than him and had every right to do so.
“Hermione is going to go ballistic when I tell her you’re the one who created her favourite makeup, she’ll bury you in letters with question after question about ingredients, brewing techniques and composition.”
That obviously hadn’t deterred Harry in the slightest and he had tried to purposefully plan random encounters in the elevator and outside their doors, he had even found a plausible excuse at work to go down to level nine and look for him in the Department of Mysteries, but that had been a failure, seen as he had had no idea how to even travel through the countless unnamed corridors of the Department to find the Potions division.
The pout disappeared in an instant and Draco’s pupils dilated so much the black swallowed any trace of grey left.
When all of Potter’s hard length is deep inside me, I take a second to breathe and get accustomed to the size. I’m not a virgin by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s been a while since I’ve been rammed by a cock this big and I’d like to still be able to walk tomorrow, even with a limp.
“You’re absolutely right Hermione, as always, we’ll be there and we’ll bring dessert.” Draco stated without even having to look at Harry to know that he was nodding along with his words, both men dutifully chastised.
“Oh now you’ve done it.” murmured Draco, though no one heard him. If there was one thing that you shouldn’t tell Harry, was that he didn’t deserve to be where he was.
It wasn’t that the concept was alien to Harry, he himself had watched his fair share of football matches when there hadn’t been anything interesting on TV, though he had never gotten particularly into the sport, it was too much like a cheap version of Quidditch. It was the concept of Draco Malfoy, pureblood extraordinaire, watching a muggle sport
Seeing how much they’d hated each other in school, the ease with which they worked together was astounding. They complemented each other’s skills brilliantly, where Draco was more knowledge and precision, Harry brought sheer power and determination, together they formed an unstoppable duo.
Harry was left in his usual work attire, black jeans and a fitted white shirt that outlined his muscled body and ok, maybe Draco had had other reasons besides having a bit of fun, for disrobing his partner, Harry was really a sight to behold.
“Shit Malfoy, you’re so tight.” Potter gasps between thrusts and I’d like to answer him, but what comes out of my mouth is a jumble of curses and mewls that makes no sense.
coming from the other side of the wall, Harry swiftly exited his apartment and walked the three meters that separated his door from the next.
“Anyways, now you know why I’m here. Why are you?” I ask, because he hasn’t answered and I’m curious and eager to divert the conversation towards more light-hearted themes.
It had been at least a couple of months since the last time they had all eaten together, which was a rare occurrence as they usually tried to find time to see each other every other week, but the case had kept Harry and Draco pretty busy and they hadn’t found the occasion to visit the Granger-Weasley abode.
“Plus, if someone is interested in you,” I say, though I’m not completely sure why I’m trying to help him, I must have changed way more that I’d thought if I’m here advising Harry Potter. “they might consent to the Veritaserum and it wouldn’t be illegal.”
I start bobbing my head up and down Potter’s considerable length, delighting in every sound I receive in return for my efforts. As I take more of him in my mouth, Potter’s hips snap forward and I push him on the bed with my hand. I slide my other hand under his tank top and start massaging the skin, feeling the muscles tense and ripple under my touch, I go further upwards until I reach one of his nipples and I circle it with the tip of my finger before pinching it lightly.
I stand up and remove first my shoes and socks, then my t-shirt, letting it fall to the floor, not caring where it lands. I feel Potter’s eyes on me and I turn around to give him full view of my ass as I open my flies and very slowly push my jeans down my legs, making sure to bend down and put my boxer-clad ass on display.
Let me know in the comments what you think of this story. Did you like it? Do you think that writing in first person added something to the story? Would you like to read more about it or should I end it here?
Was that to say that he had never tried? Also no, but the experience hadn’t been worth the public backlash, because of course sleeping with him hadn’t been enough, his so-called admirers had had to share their time together with the press, earning a substantial amount of gold from it too, Harry supposed.
Draco felt the moment Harry’s control started to slip and with renewed vigour bobbed his head and sucked harder until Harry came with a shout, filling Draco’s throat and then he crumpled, boneless, to the floor.
Nimble fingers made short work of belt and flies, leaving only the thin silk of Draco’s boxers between Harry and his destination.
He would miss the uniform, he had worked so hard to earn it, but reality wasn’t as good as his expectations had been before starting the training, and he wouldn’t keep working without Harry anyway.
I go back to the matter at hand, so Potter is gay (and isn’t that something my past self would have loved to know) and apparently the whole Wizarding World knows, but then, “Why are you in a
The question takes me completely off-guard, would I do what? Did he say something else while I was studying his body? Gosh, this habit of getting lost in my thoughts is gonna be a problem someday.
“Fuck.” I curse as my cock pulses and adds a bit more precum to the puddle that has already gathered on my stomach.
Malfoy looked like he was already regretting his decision. “Yes, Potter, do you need a written invitation?”
Robards looked like a deer caught in headlights, obviously he had not expected Harry to react that drastically.
The rest of the Aurors had still to go back to their jobs and Draco took the opportunity to get a bit of revenge on Robards for all those hours of useless reprimands, it was his turn now.
Potter’s eyes snap to mine and the intensity of his desire is disarming, he looks like a starved man in front of a buffet and I desperately want him to taste it.
Draco rolled his eyes, honestly, how could you be that dumb? He pondered again how this man even got into Auror training without having the basic ability of reading between the lines of a very simple statement.
They removed all their clothes before getting on the bed. Harry laid on his back as Draco straddled his thighs.
I raise an eyebrow. “Do you intend to stare at my cat for much longer? Or can we move on to something more…interesting?” I ask, gradually lowering my tone until the last words are little more than whispers.
“I almost forgot, dinner at ours tomorrow, the kids want to see their uncles, that means you too Draco, it’s been too long since our last get-together.” She gave them a stern look.
We keep fucking like bunnies for a while, it could be hours, but it most likely is not, we’re too aroused to last that long, my thighs are cramping from the continuous movement, but I don’t falter in my rocking and Potter grunts from the exertion, but keeps filling me up with his engorged member over and over. Sweat falls from our bodies and soaks the sheets, making our skin glisten under the moonlight coming through the window, a sliver of light illuminating Potter’s face and elated expression.
Harry wasn’t usually this illiterate, but Malfoy always managed to bring out his bumbling self with just a narrowing of his eyes.
“Never ma’am.” Draco answered cheekily, blowing a kiss to Hermione, who rolled her eyes and strolled out of the room, robes billowing behind her.
Harry slammed his book shut at the enthusiastic shout coming from the other side of the wall. How could he concentrate on reading while his neighbour was so loudly enjoying himself?
After months of pining after his neighbour and listening to him vehemently expressing his impassivity towards him once a week, Harry had had enough.
I notice that I’m not the only one staring at him and he cannot have missed all the stares, he either doesn’t care, or he’s attracting the crowd on purpose, seeing as it’s two in the morning, I’d go for the latter, which is perfect because my groin has become quite interested in the various scenarios my mind has conjured while watching him.
They had done a good job too, Draco, being the resident potions expert, had provided quite a lot of insights on possible base locations and new treatments for the coma patients and Harry, always the most practical one, had led multiple successful raids, collecting substantial evidence and arresting a few minor dealers.
Draco, on the other hand, was a good duellist and could hold his own, but would never be as good as Harry, he wasn’t as fast and his reflexes not as quick, not to mention that his own sense of self-preservation would never allow him to pull some of the stunts he had seen Harry dive in without a second thought during the years. He wasn’t a coward, but not reckless either, if things had been done according to him in the past, their solved cases would probably be a lot less, granted, the number of injuries and hospital-stays would decrease exponentially too, but was it worth it? Harry didn’t think so, and Draco was inclined to agree, he knew he would take a broken arm if it meant another criminal behind bars, he just didn’t purposefully look for the most dangerous route if he could find another way with time. Harry wasn’t as patient or mindful about his well-being to wait, which had been the subject of a lot of their first arguments, when they were still getting used to each other.
“But that’s illegal.” Intervened Marchbanks “Head Auror Robards, we have to do something, Potter can’t just break the law like that, especially here!”
I guess, I can see where he’s coming from, I too would look elsewhere if there was a way to avoid all that trouble.
When Harry was completely spent, Draco pulled off with a resounding pop and a satisfied grin on his face.
“Ahah … I mean, er, since, you know, we’re both here alone tonight, maybe we could … maybe we could hang out?”
I step out of my trousers and turn around, walking back to the bed with swaying hips. Potter’s eyes don’t leave the tent in my boxers and he licks his lips, making my cock twitch in excitement.
Draco would sometimes join in taking the blame and suffer through the scolding with Harry, but Robards seemed to have it out for Harry in particular, probably because it was rumoured that Kingsley was considering to promote Harry to Head of the Department and Robards feared the truth behind those voices.
Meanwhile, in the other room, a football match had ended, but no one had noticed, another kind of night match had taken place, one far more pleasurable and possibly the start of something special.
I’m about to get up and join the people on the dancefloor to try and get closer to the Adonis, when he suddenly turns around and my whole body freezes.
“By the way Potter” Draco’s voice suddenly interrupted the silence “The next time you want to find me in the Department of Mysteries, try asking the walls, they’re very good at giving directions.”
Potter doesn’t seem to mind though, which is nice, when I zone out with Pansy, she usually slaps me to make me come back to reality, not nice.
“Potter, what do you want?” he asked with a tired sigh, as if talking to Harry was an exhausting feat, which, Harry supposed, to Malfoy it might be.
“You were amazing today Harry, at the warehouse and at the Ministry, you told Robards exactly what needed to be said and your exit was fantastic. Do you have any idea how hot you looked tearing through those wards wandlessly?”
placing a hand on Draco’s cheek, his thumb gently caressing a cheekbone. “But we’re not anymore, we won’t waste any more time.”
He’s tall, but not towering over the crowd, the jeans hugging his legs leave nothing to the imagination, lean calves, strong thighs and that arse, oh God that arse, that mouth-watering goodness should be illegal to carry around, I stare at it for a while and then go back to my inspection and Merlin, that’s even better. He’s wearing a tank-top that shows all the muscles in his back ripple as he dances, thick bare arms thrown in the air casually as he sways to the beat. The only thing I can see of his head is a mop of sweaty black curls that reach his shoulders and glisten under the strobe lights.
“If you are a man of integrity, as you keep on preaching, you’ll be true to your words Robards.” Draco couldn’t keep the coldness out of his voice as he regarded his soon-to-be ex-boss and colleagues.
Having won his battle with the shirt, Harry tugged it down Draco’s arms, not even batting an eyelid as the black lines of the dark mark were revealed. He traced the lines with the tip of is finger, not afraid of it any more than he was of his own scar. He heard the man below him exhale a sigh of relief.
“If you must know, I was watching football, nothing dangerous for you to run in and save the day.” He said tersely, moving to close the door, but Harry’s foot stopped it from moving.
“Honestly? No.” I say and he nods, like he’s been expecting it. “You are looking for a relationship,” I elaborate “if I was too, then I would expect to be trusted, not questioned, so no, I wouldn’t consent to the use of Veritaserum, not even for you.”
With that he took out his wand to, Draco supposed, summon his things from the office before actually leaving.
“You mean, did it go alright after you threw a tantrum in front of the whole Auror Department and then decided to pop out of existence, living me to deal with everything?” he asked while placing small kisses along the length of Harry’s neck. He felt Harry still a bit and he knew he was probably second-guessing his actions like he so often did when he acted without thinking.
“Say what? The truth?” he challenged. “Because we all know it’s the truth. Your actions have brought not only your best Auror, but the best Auror the DMLE has seen in probably centuries, to resign because he couldn’t stand your overbearing and frankly too strict application of the rules.
As he felt his orgasm fast approaching he tried to warn Draco tugging at his hair, but Draco only increased his efforts, hollowing his cheeks and taking in his mouth as much of Harry’s cock as he could fit.
The scene had not been pretty, cauldrons had exploded, covering the room in potentially harmful slime and bodies lay around on the floor, some body-bound, some stunned, some dead, in the middle of it all stood Harry and Draco, robes stained with blood and singed in a few points. The rookies had been huddled close together in a corner, unarmed but shocked.
When my rim is loose enough, I feel a finger join the wet muscle and I let out a broken cry, I grip my sheets so hard that my knuckles turn even whiter than usual, I’m not sure how much more I can take of this sweet torture.
So when she suggests you get laid to get rid of the tension and sexual frustration that have been clinging to you for the past weeks, guess what you do?
, as per protocol, they had informed Robards and had gone on a reconnaissance mission with a couple of rookies.
Pleasing his lovers to the point of near-incoherency was something Draco always took great pride in, before Harry, it had been because he viewed it as a confirmation of his own skills, but when he’d started dating Harry, he’d found himself more and more eager to please him, he
We moan and Potter moves his arms around my back, down to my ass and he grabs the round globes, pressing me even closer to him. I grind against him and Potter detaches his lips from mine to let out a loud groan, I use the distraction to latch my lips on his neck and suck hard, making sure I leave a bruise. This will be a one-night thing, I know that, but I can’t help wanting to make Potter remember it for as long as possible.
Potter gives me a real full smile, I squirm a bit against the counter, he shouldn’t be allowed to smile like that, it’s doing strange things to my stomach.
Listen here Potter, you might be a good Auror but you DON’T make the rules! You are NOT above the law and you are NOT in any kind of position to do whatever you want without consequences!” he was panting by now, an incensed look in his eyes.
That left muggles and Harry supposed they were enough, for one-night stands. The idea of entering a relationship with a muggle though, wasn’t something Harry particularly thought about, for multiple reasons, but mostly because he didn’t want to have to hide himself and magic was a big part of his life, from his job to his friends and adoptive family.
Finally, Draco’s cock was revealed and both men groaned. Harry took a few moments to admire the magnificent member.
Draco started eagerly sucking on Harry’s member as if it was a delicious popsicle in a hot summer day and Harry was soon reduced to a whining puddle of goo. His hands were gripping the sheets, trying to stay away from Draco’s head, but then he thought,
At least now, the weekly outbursts coming from the other side of Harry’s living room wall were explained. Harry found that he didn’t mind in the slightest that Malfoy wasn’t doing anything more than watching TV, as selfish as that was.
It had been a stressful and eventful afternoon. It was supposed to be just a surveillance operation, they had even brought along a couple of rookies to show them the practical side of the job, but an unexpected turn of events had led to a furious fight and the final apprehension of the leaders of one of the biggest potions trafficking ring in England.
Still, things aren’t so bad. I’ve got a job, which is something I never imagined I’d have to find, but needs must and I’m not the same snooty brat I was as a child. I’ve got a flat in London, I know, shocking, just one bedroom a living room and a small kitchen that I share with the grumpiest cat I’ve ever met, and I’ve met Mrs. Norris. It’s small but it’s enough for us, not like I could afford anything bigger, after the Ministry took our vaults for war reparations we were left with just the Manor and enough money to last a few months. My parents still leave at the Manor, they renovated, they said, I’m not sure, I’m never stepping foot there ever again, I’m not sure where they’ve found the money to renovate a whole estate either, but I’m sure I don’t want to know that.
I quirk an eyebrow. “You need to be a little more specific than that.” I say, because I have quite a lot of problems.
They both put down their bottles without breaking eye contact, then Malfoy raised an eyebrow as if to ask ‘Well, what are you waiting for?’ and Harry lost any semblance of control.
Ever since the apartment next to his had gotten a new tenant a year ago, Harry had been able to think of little else. He was sure that whatever supernatural force controlled his life was playing a prank on him. Here he was, the most beautiful man Harry had ever laid eyes on, waltzing through the doors of his building one sunny day, ready to turn Harry’s life on his axis. He was as perfect as human beings could be, he was a wizard and a very skilled one at that, Harry had discovered, after asking around the Ministry and finding out that the man was one of the lead Potions researchers in the Unspeakable division. He obviously wasn’t supposed to know that, but his name held much more weight than the general public knew, especially inside the walls of the Ministry and confidential information was not something that applied to him, much to Hermione’s annoyance and Ron’s amusement every time Harry managed to retrieve a crucial piece of information she had spent days, if not weeks, trying to obtain.
His neighbour seemed to have decided that Harry wasn’t anything more than an annoying human being he had to politely nod to when they passed each other on the way in and out of the building, which had been totally fine with Harry, until he’d found his gaze lingering a bit too much on the man’s sharp features, and delectable backside. At that point, polite disinterest hadn’t been enough anymore, but the other man had seemed to either be oblivious to Harry’s ogling or he had noticed and hadn’t been interested, because every time Harry had tried to start a conversation he had been gently turned down with a few stilted words.
Malfoy, as always, looked impeccable, or at least he did to Harry. He was still in what Harry supposed to be his work attire, white shirt and charcoal dress pants. The first couple of buttons of his shirt were undone, as well as his cuffs and the sleeves were rolled up to just below his elbows, leaving in sight uncharacteristically muscled forearms for someone who worked in a lab. He was barefoot and Harry definitely didn’t think that his pale feet with perfectly manicured toenails were alluring. Absolutely not, in fact, he didn’t even notice them, he was too focused on admiring the beautiful face that topped that perfect body.
That didn’t mean that everything was always perfect, they argued constantly, about which decision to make or what plan to enact, they bickered like an old married couple about the most trivial things, like whether you should put milk before or after water when making tea, but the insults didn’t have that bite anymore, the snide remarks didn’t sting, they both new that, at the end of the day, even if said day had been a bad one, they would go home and be back the next morning, their friendship stronger than before.
When I look back into his eyes, I see the same desperation I’m feeling and I can’t wait anymore, I grab his chin and smash my lips against his. Potter growls against my mouth and I moan at the sound, parting my lips for just a second, but it’s enough for him to slip his tongue inside my mouth, not that I mind.
There’s a thunderstorm of butterflies in my stomach, teenage Draco would have fainted if Harry Potter had called him hot, twenty-eight-year-old Draco is not very far from it.
He motioned for Draco to raise his hips a bit and pulled down trousers and underwear in one swift motion, letting them pool around Draco’s ankles.
In the ten years they had been partners, they had worked tirelessly on their cases, becoming the best team in the Department, their solve rate had been the highest in the last century and they had rapidly climbed the hierarchy from Junior Aurors to Seniors and eventually, since the quality of their work and the efficacy of their partnership had been indisputable, they had become Deputy Heads.
The warm water trickles down his body, but he can barely feel it. The numb horror of what just happened at dinner is still crawling all over his skin.
He kisses her. It's still new to them both. "You cannot do anything wrong, Hermione Granger. You are the brightest witch of our age."
Harry's face perks up in a way that clearly suggests that he is anything but chipper. "Great," he says, and Draco feels as if Harry regards that word with a different meaning than others do. Great means fucking awful.
Harry forces him another half a vial of pain reliever, but Draco doesn't drink more. They should be careful with their supply.
The first thing he notices upon arriving is the chilled air, immediately raising goosebumps on his skin.
Fingers curling around his wand, he turns, imagining the cottage around himself as clearly as he can. The familiar place, Harry sitting on the couch, smiling at him. The fireplace flickering. The seagulls waddling.
Harry itches to ask, but in the end, he doesn’t. He trusts Remus, and he doesn't want to sound like a petulant child annoying the parent by constantly asking 'are we there yet? Are we? Are we?'
Draco’s eyes sweep across the cell, looking for a weapon, something, anything, but the only thing he notices with dismay is that the pitcher and glasses have disappeared.
There’s a loud crack which makes him flinch. They can’t be here, they need to leave. Get as far away from this place as possible.
Draco follows, for a lack of a better thing to do. When he moves to take the glasses, Harry tells him not to bother. He quickly settles down beside Harry, the warmth from his body is sinfully comforting.
She flicks one eyebrow, her back remains rigid and straight, her shoulders--as fucking always-- are broad and confident. If such a thing could even be said about a pair of shoulders.
There's a certain skip in Rosier's step, not easily noticeable but there nonetheless. He feels content, on a high. The rush of blood and the ear-blasting sound of the explosion is still ringing in his ears, the sheer
Namely, steal Harry’s breath and make his heart race and his feet stumble when he steps out of the boat. He ends up pitching into Malfoy, who catches him with annoying grace, his arms wrapping reflexively around Harry and steadying him.
care! Sorry. But you were a kid and you want to be better. I know people disagree, and they give you shit. And I’m sorry. But for what it’s worth, I think who you decide to do now matters more than what you’ve done before.”
“I think he will listen to you,” she says while his back is turned, over the clomping of her feet and the sound of clothes coming off and on. “Oh Saviour of the Wizarding World, Chosen One, Golden Boy, oh Saint Potter of the bisexuals—”
Pansy sighs. She seems to have worked off her frantic energy and is entering a more settled state. “I know what you meant, Potter.” She goes quiet.
he squawks, drawing his blanket up sharply over his bare chest. It’s the beginning of the year, and the summer heat seems determined on staying the night, especially up in Gryffindor Tower. Heat rises, and all that. “What are you—why are you—” He doesn’t even know what question to ask. How did she get up here? Why is she hovering over his bed like the grim reaper, shaking him awake five minutes after he’d
Definitely not imagining the low voice. “You’re just throwing sex words around,” Draco accuses, trying to keep his voice as neutral as he can. Trying not to flush. It doesn’t really work. “You’re not actually saying anything significant. Stop shirking your responsibilities, Potter. Eyes on your own paper.”
But Draco hasn’t done anything. He hasn’t done anything but hurt Harry, over and over, every minute of the day. And he knows he’s temporarily thrown Harry’s mind off of the misery, not healed it.
“I have this one,” he says, tracing Harry’s scar on his hip. Harry reaches out and runs his fingers along it, so lightly that it sends shivers up Draco’s back. “The night when you first got part of Voldemort’s soul lodged in you.” He pulls up his shirt, traces over his heart. “I have this one. The night you not hit by the Curse again, and lost the part of Voldemort’s soul you had. It makes me love you more, the things you’ve been through. I’m made to love all the versions of you that there are.”
Pansy opens her mouth like she’s about to answer, before there’s a very loud “Bloody hell,” and Ron’s curtains flutter madly. “You’re shagging
Well he just wants to help Malfoy and he’s scared they won’t be able to, and something bad will happen to Malfoy.
favorite remains after classes are over, and he can sit with Harry in his chambers or in Harry’s and do… whatever. Sometimes they talk. Sometimes they play card games, or chess, or anything else, all of which Draco consistently wins. Sometimes they simply exist in the same space, and it’s so
“Didn’t you say you meet your soulmate before you’re twenty?” a Ravenclaw points out, eyes narrowed.
But Harry doesn’t get the chance to ask what she means by that, because just then, Hermione bursts in, all business. “You should’ve come to me first,” she says matter-of-factly, by way of hello. “How far back has he gone and how long has he been there?”
“Oh…” Harry says, as if suddenly realizing something. His gaze on Draco’s sharpens, dips from Draco’s eyes to his lips and then quickly back up again, before raking helplessly down Draco’s body—fuck, god, Draco’s never felt closer to overheating in his life—and then back up to Draco’s face again. He looks at a loss. “Oh.”
The grin returns. Again. “Merlin’s fucking tits, Malfoy, I’m shagging him and dating him a bit, not getting married.”
“Thought I was a right prick, at first,” Jacobs says casually. As if Harry Potter thinking you’re a right prick is not grounds for concern. “But you know, once you’re up close and personal, things look a bit different, don’t they?”
“How far, how long,” Hermione demands again. She looks ready to shove the tip of her wand against the underside of Pansy’s chin and demand answers; Harry suspects she isn’t any more happy about being woken up in the middle of the night than he is.
Hermione hands the Time-Turner back. “Well.” She seems a bit at a loss. “Thank you. And, I guess, you’re welcome. Really there’s no need to thank us. But you’re welcome. And thank you.”
He steps into the shower and closes the shower door, which happens to be clear glass. Draco doesn’t look as Harry turns on the water, but he knows Harry’s mouth is opening in a sigh—he’s looked before.
His chest shakes a little when he laughs. “Not very effective if you’re trying to avoid my sweat,” he says.
“I don’t like your boyfriend,” Draco announces abruptly, because he thinks any more of this will have him absolutely losing control of himself. “I think he’s a bad one.”
Harry looks miserable. He has always looked miserable, every time Draco looks his way, and Draco has been boring holes into the back of Harry’s head for months.
It’s soft and silky, and Malfoy makes this gentle, eager noise against him when he runs his fingers through it, turning Malfoy just a little this way, guiding the kiss, closing his eyes even though the Lumos has gone out again.
Harry’s glad they’re going down from the Gryffindor dorms to the Slytherin dorms and not the other way around, because there are many stairs involved, and the air gets progressively cooler as they descend.
“There you go again, calling him Draco,” Pansy interrupted. “And I’m sorry to break it to you, Potter, but those doors stay closed whether or not someone’s in there.”
“Some things are awkward,” he says through the door, “it’s a hard fact of life, Potter. But it’s a good thing. An important thing.”
The truth probably hasn’t occurred to Harry, not once. Because why would Draco be this… heartless? The Draco Malfoy that Draco has tried so hard to be after the war would never do this—but this is the one thing. The
“You’re not studying!” he says, as if delighted, and walks over to Draco. Draco hastily folds the paper in half. “I wish I was here for that—I could’ve dragged you out into soccer.”
Pansy gestures for him to stop and points to a door—grand as all the rest of them, with this shiny, metal-worked handle and a pretty lock, and then puts her hands palm-to-palm and pretends to rest her head on them.
Malfoy reaches for her before she goes out the door, his mouth very tight. “You told him,” he mutters, as if Harry can’t hear him from all the way over here, two feet away.
time he wants to antagonize Malfoy—they’re in the middle of rapidly spinning time—so he forces himself to swallow it.
He cannot believe what just came out of his mouth. Malfoy doesn’t look like he believes it either; his cheeks are pink but his expression is blank.
Harry’s stuck on the Dark Mark part. The Dark Mark? Why would Malfoy want to go back in time to the day he got the Dark Mark? Immediately, his brain supplies him with
” Draco accuses, fighting his own smile. “You’re making fun of me. Here I am, Potter, putting myself out there, spending my precious studying time to ask your sexual partners a few questions of interest for your own benefit, and you don’t even appreciate me.”
“We’re never going to get anywhere if you keep doing this,” Harry says, puffing as they near the entrance to the Slytherin Common Room.
For some reason, this makes Harry feel hot and flushed, even though it’s still unsnowing all over them, and he looks away, watching the stars shift across the sky gradually, between flashes of daylight, and the moon wane and wax and wane and wax backward. “Well
Draco shrugs, smiling without thinking about it. The class twitters. “I was right,” he says. “I’m just… Happy. Really, really happy.”
“You might feel drawn to them,” Draco answers, picking his words. “The textbook answer is no, you can meet each other as strangers for the first time and part as strangers without knowing it at all. You can feel anything from love to indifference to hate for them and end up falling in love with them in the end.”
“Oh, yes. If you want to find them,” Harry echoes, rolling his eyes. “Unless you just would rather not find the person
“Watch out, your head is getting even bigger.” Draco looks away from Harry. His whole life is looking at Harry or looking away from Harry.
Malfoy shakes his head, his hands tightening even more around Harry’s, hard enough now that it almost hurts a little. “I’m a little bit in love with you.”
You can never be saintly enough, is that right?” Malfoy looks off across the Great Lake, his voice quieting again. “I don’t need to be the best person in the whole fucking world like you. I just want to be good.”
“Better than being at home!” Harry’s voice is light, but Draco can see the muscles of his back tense. “I got bullied, but at least it was by other kids and not by my legal guardians, you know?”
Harry didn’t have the most loving childhood, that Harry longs and longs for what other soulmates have: open, giving love. He wants to give Harry all the love just building in him
Harry can see the handle of Malfoy’s trunk on the floor under his bed, which looks rather dustless. He shouldn’t be surprised Malfoy dusts his room; his robes are always spotless.
Harry pulls back just as gently as he leaned in, breathing deep and shaky. His forehead presses, warm, against Draco’s. “Why—” His voice is faint, barely a whisper. “Why do you think?”
Draco would sell his soul to see him do it again, but he doesn’t have to. Harry grabs Draco’s hand and smiles, he takes Draco to dinner and he smiles, he catches Draco’s eye while they’re grading and he smiles.
happening here?” Harry rubs his eyes, trying to get the lights out of his vision. He hasn’t slept well for several nights in a row, and he really would like to go back to sleep, thanks. “It’s three AM,” he says, in case perhaps she hasn’t noticed.
Malfoy’s breath rushes across his skin in short gasps when they pull apart, and before Harry can say a word, Malfoy’s on him again, hands now flat on Harry’s chest, mouth chasing Harry’s when Harry needs to draw a breath.
Harry blinks some more. He’s feeling very hot under the covers in the summer heat, but he doesn’t want to lower them because Parkinson’s still staring. “What—ah—what
“Oh,” he breathes, looking up at Malfoy and his halo of hair. He tries to come up with something else to say, but all he has is this bursting feeling in his chest that makes it hard to breathe.
Michael’s giving him an odd look. “You’ve gotta work on your friendly talk from the best mate,” he says. “That was an interrogation.”
“We’re not taking a risk, are you out of your mind? If we lose that gamble we can fuck up all of reality as we know it!” Pansy runs a quick hand through her hair, and it falls back around her shoulders messily. She was just fixing it up, but Harry doesn’t point that out.
—but he misjudges the distance and his hand lands, almost comically, in the center of Harry’s chest.
“There,” says Malfoy, which is really strange for Harry to feel because Malfoy’s face is still in his hands. “That didn’t sound very surprised.”
“Am I supposed to be surprised that you’re an arse?” Harry blinks at him. “All evidence points to your being an arse as a given, at least to me. Which is kind of weird because I was getting the impression that… you know…”
“Oh,” says Draco. “I don’t know.” This time it’s actually true. The soulmark over his heart aches. Or maybe it’s his heart that’s aching. Same difference. “You probably feel really, really happy.”
that.” Harry waves him on. “Go. We’ve still got a couple hours of sleep before we have to get back up again.”
“Jacob Jacobs.” Straight brown hair that falls into his brown eyes, tan skin and freckles, looks completely out of place in this coffee shop, his knees spread wide and his large hands fiddling with the sugar. He doesn’t seem to be drinking his tea.
me, then?” Harry demands. If he believes Draco, he doesn’t show it. “All this time, you knew. It’s on my fucking
Malfoy swallows again, and then he opens his eyes—looking down at the Firebolt and not at Harry—and pushes the Firebolt Harry’s way. “I don’t want to fly,” he says, his voice rough and quiet.
“Have you ever looked in a mirror?” he elects to say instead, aiming for… well he’s not sure what he’s aiming for. He sounds sort of resigned, even to himself. “I still think you’re an arse.”
Draco swallows and sits back, finishing off the last of his tea. “Alright. You have two half-strikes, which is one strike. Two strikes and you’d be out.”
“He’s a virgin in spirit,” Draco counters lamely, and changes the subject. “But I didn’t ask anyway. I don’t ask about their sexual history, that would be too awkward.”
That, more than anything, breaks Harry out of it. “Okay, okay, whatever,” he grumbles, and grabs Malfoy again, this time by the hand, receiving a noise of surprise from Malfoy that has him looking quickly up to make sure Malfoy hasn’t, like, died standing up or anything. This seems to make Pansy laugh harder. Harry casts a pointed Silencing Charm. “Let’s go, let’s move.”
Underneath Draco’s robe, he’s wearing a crisp white button down and a pair of black trousers, every day, always. Harry teases him about them—and about how he won’t so much as take off his shirt to change in anyone’s presence.
mouth? Besides, if I ask any adults for help, what am I going to get? A fast response or a lawful one?”
But. The point being: Draco couldn’t escape the tapping if he wanted to. He’s just had to learn to live with it, to think around it.
Harry’s chair screeches away, back to his own desk, where he once more sits on the wrong side. “You could be happier,” Harry says quietly, but Draco pretends not to hear it over the tapping of Harry’s quill.
Draco returned, and Harry had laughed, quiet and breathy, leaning over Draco’s desk yet again. Draco forgot how to breathe.
“Oh, stop,” Harry grumbles. Over his embarrassment, he faintly realizes that Malfoy’s reaction is a little bit of a weird one. “It’s not a big fucking deal.”
Pansy snorts. “Maybe you should ask Draco,” she says cryptically, which helps Harry’s panic not at all.
.” Harry grabs the sides of the boat as it gently scrapes against the land, coming to a stop. “You could just tell me. Or have you, and I didn’t notice?”
They fly across the country with what Harry hopes is a good Concealer Spell on Harry’s Firebolt, Pansy shouting at Harry to go faster and slower periodically. “You’re mad!” she eventually yells into his ear, and Harry just pushes them faster.
“Flexibility is important,” Harry says in a low voice. Or maybe Draco’s just imagining it’s lower than normal. Harry’s fingers trace the top of Draco’s paper absently, wide brown fingers with blunt nails cut short, more nimble than they look. “No matter how tightly you plan, you’re going to have to loosen up when the time comes.”
“Don’t worry,” she says before Harry can express that he’s worried, “This is the family room—they store all the things they’re not putting up on the walls. Estranged people. Portraits out of rotation. You know.”
“Harry has more emotional sway,” Pansy says, which Harry supposes is true. Malfoy hates Hermione, but he thinks Malfoy hates Harry even more. But how’s that gonna help—some sort of reverse psychology?
“I understand why you kept it from me,” Harry says one day. “If you thought we were Dissonant. I just… was so obvious.”
Malfoy’s expression flickers when Harry says his name, and he hesitates for a moment, and then he closes his eyes. “You have to not be joking,” he says, and this time his tone is completely different. He sounds wobbly, the way he does when he feels very strongly—when he’s furious, or when he’s crying. Although Harry’s only really heard him cry twice—in the bathroom and working up the nerve to kill Dumbledore. He sounds like he’s trying to give an order, but it’s coming out a plea.
is his very least favorite thing in the world to say. Harry wouldn’t be surprised. “After the Room of Requirement…”
him.” Butcher grins, the first sign of semi-confidence Draco has seen so far from him. “I’d lose. He’s—I’d lose.”
The corridors are dark, only very dimly lit at long intervals, but Pansy doesn’t falter or slow as the rest of them hurry to catch up with her, muffling their footsteps hurriedly when Ron’s shoes clack noisily against the stone floor and Pansy hisses something his way.
Draco stares down at his textbook, not reading a single word, not looking up. Salazar, fuck, this is going to be catastrophic.
Harry’s face is blank, completely, utterly devoid of expression, as if the message his eyes are sending him has simply not yet reached his brain.
waiting for Malfoy to either confirm that he fancies Harry or start making fun of Harry relentlessly.
“Yeah, fuck yeah.” Jacobs closes his eyes. Tips his head back a little. He should get a strike just for that. But Draco is extraordinarily fair.
It’s like he doesn’t want Harry to get any sleep tonight. Harry finds himself smiling anyway. He’s not sure how that smile got there.
If it was the other way around, if Draco’s was visible and Harry’s wasn’t, Harry would’ve told Draco. He has honor. He’s less selfish by leagues.
Harry makes an appreciative sound without thinking. It’s not a terrible idea. Of course, he’d never believe a letter that said it was from someone in the future… but maybe Malfoy, who’d grown up in a world full of magic and knew that Time-Turners existed… maybe he would.
Soulmarks are a manifestation of magic. Everyone with magical ability knows of Harry Potter. The statement is
“Yes?” It sounds like a question. “Have you ever made very good decisions in the middle of the night?”
late-night Harry, bright eyes, tired smile, stretching his arms up high enough that Draco could see a bit of his stomach. He’s not sure why Harry didn’t tuck in earlier.
Draco tugs up the hem of his shirt from where it’s tucked neatly into the waist of his trousers, his fingers careful, his movements almost inappropriately steady, as if he’s acting on autopilot.
Harry just gapes. He wonders if he’ll just spend the rest of this entire expedition in astonishment.
Harry doesn’t miss the way Malfoy flinches, his cheeks paling and his eyes darting towards Harry, so he takes a step back to give them space and almost trips over a pile of boxes, sending papers tumbling.
Merlin, how Draco wishes that could count as a strike. This guy is—fuck. Merlin. It gives Draco a headache to think about this man putting his hands all over Harry, putting his mouth on Harry’s neck, tasting his sweat and feeling his body move under his hands.
“Hey Malfoy?” Harry says, as he disobeys Malfoy and slides his hand down, grabbing Malfoy’s elbow tightly and his Firebolt in the other, “Why’d you kiss me?”
It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter. It’s obvious anyway. And Harry wants the answer so bad. Draco wants to give it to him.
The robes Harry wore yesterday are clean enough, and with a quick cleaning charm just to be sure, he slips them on, turning to face Pansy.
Draco pulls out Astronomy and starts studying. The interesting thing is that they’re not studying the magical elements of the planets, the constellations, any of that. They’re studying the
“Eight strikes,” he says, bringing his eyes back down to the page. “I’m eight strikes, if you were wondering.”
(Damn Potter and his distracting calves and bare feet and wild hair and bare arse) “Besides, I did a little of Muggle History, in elementary school.”
Harry falls silent. He doesn’t know what to say. He’s pretty sure Hermione once told him that most people—a very very large majority of people believe that they are Good, and that they are Right, most of the time. That they are the heroes of some story, even when they do bad things, because it’s just the way people are; they think they’re justified. Not that people believe that they’re perfect, but that most of them believe the sum of them is good.
“Oh, shut up, Malfoy.” Harry flushes, beaming wider, his shoulders shaking a little as he laughs. “You’re the worst.”
“We’ll Apparate close and walk the rest of the way,” Harry suggests. “I really don’t see any other option.”
“Possibly because I’ve been working while you have been wasting your time attempting to start a conversation with me.” Draco dips his pen in ink again, willing himself not to look up. It’s exceedingly hard when he knows if he does, Harry’s eyes will be so,
“Too much?” Harry steps up to Malfoy and gently takes the Firebolt from him, dropping it onto the air, where it hovers obediently, waiting. “Sorry. Come on, let’s get you back. You’re probably tired. I know
“Butcher doesn’t have an STI,” he says when he’s found his voice. If Harry notices his especially long silence, he doesn’t say anything. “He’s a virgin.”
Harry pulls his wand out slowly and undoes the Transfiguration on the boat. He doesn't look away from Malfoy, but Malfoy blinks and drops his arms from around Harry slowly, as if he thinks Harry still needs help standing.
” He sounds… well, he sounds the way he always does when he talks about soulmates: wistful. The tiniest edge of pain. They’ve had this conversation so many times. “I just don’t understand. How can you just… sit here when there could be someone out there
to do with his soulmate—gets detention with me,” Draco tells every class that comes through his classroom for the next couple days, but he has no way of actually enforcing it, and talking to Harry proves that it’s not working particularly well.
Malfoy reaches jerkily into the pocket of his robes and pulls out a shining Time-Turner, looping the chain about his neck and holding it out to Harry as if in a trance.
If there’s one thing Harry thought he’d never see, it’s Pansy Parkinson standing over him, shaking him awake at three AM.
The kiss is as fleeting, gentle, Harry’s hands pressing warmly over where Draco’s fingers clutch at the edge of the desk for support. Kissing Harry isn’t a wild, screaming affair. It’s quiet and sure, like a promise. There’s a pounding on Draco’s chest again, but it doesn't feel like his heart is trying to escape—it feels like his heart is cheering.
“Do you engage with and-or make use of Dark Magic, and-or have you engaged with and-or made use of Dark Magic in the past?”
in that disgusted way of his, and Pansy said, “About the Battle of Hogwarts—” and Harry said, “Don’t worry about it,” and she just shrugged and followed Malfoy off.
Malfoy breaks away from Harry abruptly and stumbles away, putting a good distance between their bodies, which sends Harry one signal. His hand clutches at Harry’s arm, though, which sends another.
Half the people here are wizards, and hardly anyone will pass up the chance to date Harry Potter for a couple of weeks. (Coincidentally, these fans are the people Harry’s least likely to date.)
does the Earth go around the sun and the moon go around the earth, and the stars shine so bright even when some of them are already dead, how do stars die, etc., etc. It’s fascinating, the how. It bores Harry to death, and Draco can’t understand it.
The same Hufflepuff from before, curious blue eyes, skinny arm in the air, asks what the whole class is trying to ask: “Who’s Harry Potter’s soulmate, then?”
It’s a testament to how distracted Harry is that Harry finds nothing odd about Draco showering in the middle of the day. Draco showers in the mornings, because it’s the only way to do it, frankly—that way, you get to be clean all day—and Harry always makes fun of him for it.
foolproof: it doesn’t account for the possibility that the one with the matching soulmark is Draco Malfoy, and Draco Malfoy happens to not be interested in getting his heart broken.
Days turned into weeks turned into months, and all Draco and Harry did was pretend they were just colleagues. Eat, teach, eat, teach, eat, sleep, repeat. Harry doesn’t bring Draco lunch. Draco doesn’t go to Harry’s quarters to coexist.
“I’m a little…” Malfoy’s saying, his voice all pitchy. His hands are still on Harry’s, not exactly holding them, just… there, his palms sort of pressed to the backs of Harry’s hands. “I’m sort of… Well. You know…”
Parkinson grips him tighter and her nails bite into his skin. Harry is very much awake, obviously; he doesn’t need to pinch himself.
Harry had his hands in that hair not that long ago—less than an hour ago, unless you count the time travel, in which case, who knows how long. But in the ways that count, it hasn’t been that long.
“I think…” Harry says slowly, realizing he has Malfoy’s attention. He swallows down his embarrassment and steps closer. He’s close enough to touch Malfoy, but he’s not sure if Malfoy wants him to, so he just leans against the wall. “I think you’re really… I mean… I really do think you’re hot. And you’re smart… and clever… I mean, I really think, you know, I think I’m, like, two steps away from falling in love with you, you know?”
Butcher flushes deep pink, shifting in his seat as if he can still feel it. “Isn’t that… why we’re talking? I mean, don’t you already know that?”
“Is this a wizard thing? Are you always so….” Butcher’s shoulders go up under Draco’s gaze. “No, he hasn’t. Sometimes he curses me when we play each other and I do something good, but it’s friendly.”
“Harry—” Draco thought this was obvious, that this was a given, that this information was a package deal that came with the soulmark. That came with Draco’s helpless smiles and his endless flushing and the way he can’t help looking at Harry as if Harry hung the moon. “I
later when he finally pulls back, looking at Harry with his eyes wide and his mouth still a little bit open, his hands having moved to Harry’s hips. “We shouldn’t fly in the hallway,” he says.
Harry doesn’t say anything, though he makes this sort of huffy breath sound, like he’s not sure if he’s supposed to laugh, so he’s doing it half-way. Draco understands why he would be confused.
Harry’s eyes fix on Draco’s face again, and Draco realizes they’re… very close. Harry raises his eyebrows just a little, giving Draco an incredulous look.
Harry stares for a moment. He hasn’t seen Malfoy with his sleeves rolled up for what feels like a very long time, and he can’t stop his eyes from going to the Dark Mark that stands out against his skin. It sends something black and horrible tumbling in Harry’s gut, but he swallows that down. He looks up at Malfoy’s expression—absolute shock—and maybe a little bit at the way his white-blond hair looks yellow-er in daylight and how his lips look very chewed, but definitely not that much time.
clear that Harry could ask him to swallow a Muggle bomb and he’d do it, Harry is still afraid to say it.
“I will,” Pansy says, leading them back down the stairs, through the house. “I’m borrowing one of your brooms, if you don’t mind. You can ride with Potter.”
“Oh? You didn’t want to strip down to your boxers and get your sweaty body in my personal space just for the sake of it?” Since Draco’s hand is already sweaty, he sticks it in Harry’s sweaty curls and rumples his hair a bit, as if he’s trying to get revenge on Harry for dirtying up his hand. “I need to go wash my hands.”
He just wants Harry to stop being so sad. He’d give anything, do anything to make Harry even the tiniest bit happier.
Malfoy is also a boy, a teenage boy who’s fucked up and gets irrational urges like wanting to go back in time at the risk of his life, and who keeps pictures (whatever they’re for) in his trunk and casts dusting charms under his bed.
This is a joke. The Manor is just as big and white and pretentious as Harry remembers it to be, though much less frightening. He can’t remember the last time he’d been here—to thank Narcissa?—but it was soon after the war and it still sort of felt like doom.
Harry’s voice is amused. “Maybe because you were asking him questions. He said it was like you were investigating my murder.”
Harry’s got his feet up on his own desk this time, staring at the grey ceiling. “When I was growing up,” he says, slow and careful. “My aunt and uncle
Harry laughs quietly, leaning forward to prop his chin on his hand, gazing at Draco with exaggerated earnestness. “Are you always this pessimistic with your kids, Professor Malfoy?”
“Right. Right. You’re a little repetitive.” Jacobs puts his index and thumb fingers up, indicating an inch. “Just a little.”
, okay?” Harry’s smiling like an idiot; he can feel it. He squeezes Malfoy’s hand. “I just think… I dunno, we should give this thing a chance.”
“You’d be surprised how many emergencies I’ve been woken up for in the middle of the night,” Harry mutters. They’re in the drawing room, where a fire flickers quietly in the very large fireplace. A whole family could fit in there at once. Harry just tries not to pay attention to where they are too much.
“Er… Parkinson,” Ron says, when it becomes clear Harry’s still recovering his voice, “Why’s the inside of Malfoy’s trunk covered in newspaper clippings of Harry?”
“Perfect!” he says with joy he doesn’t have to fake, and he grabs Malfoy by the elbow and yanks him in, slamming the door behind them both.
“Boyfriend?” Harry sits up, his forehead wrinkling. “I don’t have… oh, you mean the guy leaving my room last night—Jacob?”
“It’s like you practiced that speech or something.” Malfoy pulls his sleeve down and takes his arm back abruptly and sits back. Perhaps Malfoy caught Harry’s expression when he saw the Dark Mark before he could get it under control. “Whatever. You wouldn’t understand, Potter.”
Harry watches him mutter the password and step in. His heart does something absolutely ridiculous when Malfoy turns and looks back at him,
It’s a nice rowboat—a good Transfiguration job—shiny wood and smooth benches, wide enough for it not to be a squeeze but not wide enough for it to feel strange and empty. When Malfoy taps the side of the boat, oars on either side of them begin to turn themselves, and the boat glides easily forward, barely even rocking.
“Okay.” Harry kicks his feet up and folds his hands behind his head. He’s wearing deeply unprofessional Muggle clothes—T-shirt and jeans—and Draco has to pull his arms away from Harry’s forearms. Harry plays too much Quidditch for Draco’s sanity. “Teach it to me, Professor Malfoy. What say you on the subject of soulmates and soulmarks?”
“Harry, you weren’t at dinner. The only other time you’ve missed dinner is on Halloween.” Draco kicks the armchair lightly. “Put your knees down.”
anyway, and therefore not in her office. “I don’t know if there will be any going,” he says eventually. And then, because he can’t help it, “Shit idea, Malfoy.”
“Is that why you dragged me here? Are you jealous or something? I know you’re gay, and I know you’re not blind.” Jacobs smirks, leaning back in his chair. His eyes fix on Draco as if trying to catch a reaction.
The way Malfoy’s looking at him now is not doing Harry’s knees any favors. His stomach is fluttering like crazy.
Butcher smiles slightly, as if this might be a joke, but it slips off when Draco doesn’t return the smile. “Yes? Doesn’t everybody?”
Draco yanks his hand away several seconds too late. Harry has muscle. It’s not a surprise—he’s lifted things, you can
“I just don’t get it,” Harry’s saying now. “You could go find him, and if you don’t like him, so what? Get on with your life.”
“I think if you hadn’t become a Death Eater, we would’ve lost the war.” Seeing Malfoy opening his mouth with an incredulous expression, Harry continues quickly, “You never killed Dumbledore, because you didn’t want to. That bought us a lot of time. You didn’t identify me when we were caught. You let me take those wands—I
“Almost always,” Draco corrects stiffly. “Asking about someone’s soulmate can be a rather invasive question. I am going to move on to talking about soulmarks, are you ready?”
If he spends the night with Harry, he won’t be able to handle it, emotionally, to be around Harry any longer. It won’t work.
It doesn’t feel like it’s time for an adventure; it feels like it’s time for a nap. But when did Harry ever get to do what he felt like, right?
He’d said the same thing last night: they were in their shared office, tired and rubbing at their eyes. Draco didn’t want to go back to his room because he’d have to say goodnight to Harry and he
Draco remembers the feeling of meeting Harry for the first time. He was cute. Draco was ten; it wasn’t like he was capable of falling madly in love. But he was
Harry hums. “Yeah, he’s alright. I like him.” And then, unnecessarily, “I’m going to take a shower.” He closes the bathroom door.
“Uh,” says Harry. He shuffles out of the way, courteous enough to pretend he doesn’t notice Draco’s erection growing and growing under Harry’s gaze.
But that’s the thing about Harry—nearly everyone is nice if you get to know them, because nearly everybody is sympathetic in some way, and that’s good enough in Harry’s book. As long as you’re not bad, you’re good enough. Even if all your questions are sentences and you have the personality of a mouse in a cat household.
Hermione’s eyes widen, and she seems to falter for a moment, her wand lowering from where she was holding it as if she might need to cast a spell at any moment. It feels hot and stuffy, the four of them crowded around Harry’s bed, just sweating off body heat, waiting for Hermione’s bad news.
“I do, you have to believe me. I love you more than you can imagine, I—” He sucks in a breath, and then another. “I can’t even begin to—there are no words for it. Harry.” He presses his heart, every last piece of it, into Harry’s name. “I’m out of my mind in love with you. You don’t have to—forgive me. For not telling you, I—”
that.” He likes the name in his mouth more than he should. “Anyway, don’t tell him, or he’ll hex me into next Sunday. Or maybe into present day.”
Harry’s throat bobs, his chair screeches, his face gets closer. Unfathomably close. “Draco.” He says it again. “I love you.”
“I forgot about that,” Malfoy murmured, pulling out of Harry’s grip yet again. He almost sounds apologetic. He gives Harry what Harry thinks is—could he be right?—a half-smile. “We can walk there or take a boat. The boat would be more direct.”
“The day he got the Dark Mark, and he left half an hour or so ago,” Pansy answers, “Which would’ve been a lot shorter if we could’ve just gotten this done. He went off… somewhere towards the forest—I think so no one would possibly find him—he’s always been dramatic….”
managed to fall asleep to go risk quite a lot to save Malfoy and is now very tired and very confused and having a very hard time with the hot feeling in his stomach when he looks at Malfoy and who’s letting Malfoy fly them both on his broom and who is
“I’m not going to,” Harry swears, and Draco can see in Harry’s eyes that Harry means it. And he knows, he hopes, he prays that that will change. He’ll wait. However long it takes, he’ll wait.
Now Michael Corner looks less proud, more confused. “What kind of ‘best mate talk’ is this? I don’t think so, Malfoy. I dunno. Didn’t like me too much when I was dating the Weasley girl back in Hogwarts.”
“You brought Potter,” Malfoy sneers, and, having come to himself, promptly yanks his arm out of Harry’s grasp, taking very deliberate steps away from him. “Pansy. Here?
“No,” Pansy says, and then to drive the point home, repeats, “Ew,” and sends the time-turner spinning.
. But he tucks his shirt back in and picks up his robe from the back of his chair, still steady, and puts it on. Is there anything he can say that will help? Is there anything he could possibly say that could make it worse than it already is?
Pansy’s comically surprised when Harry turns back around, trying to focus definitely on business and definitely not on how Malfoy clearly has muscle under that shirt. “That worked out nicely,” she says eventually. “What did you do, Draco?”
“I know it was. Haha.” Draco takes a moment to refocus. He’s usually better at this, but then again, Harry’s taste is usually better. “Have you had any ill intentions towards Harry Potter in the past?”
” Harry hisses. “Shush, Ron.” Not that he disagrees, really. Only, Malfoy could really be in danger right now. He’s all for talking shit about Malfoy, but they should wait until Malfoy’s safe, at least.
,” Hermione says, smacking him on the shoulder, “In the years right before the war? Ron and I are just two more people you have to keep track of, who would happen to be some of the very last people we’d want to get caught at Malfoy Manor.”
sorry. Harry wants to put his hand on Malfoy’s shoulder and absorb his pain. “You went back in time because you wanted to do right.”
“He’s changed since school,” Draco says, looking quickly back down. Harry’s stripping off his shirt. Draco can hear Harry wandering closer to where Draco is laying on his bed. “Do you like him?”
getting hurt does make his stomach feel tight and tipsy, as if he might throw up. “Whatever,” he gets out, pacing faster, “I’m going to look out.”
despite Draco’s constant jabs about it, so that he can scoot over and look at Draco’s work whenever he feels like it.
room precisely when Harry pulled open the door, which contrary to being very bad luck (as it would have been if it was younger Malfoy), this is about as good as their luck will get.
thing about it—” Harry snorts. Draco shoots him a quelling look. Harry beams back at him. “Is that fate will put you into a path of
Harry tries to remember how and from who he got the information that they were all destroyed in the Department of Mysteries and has to concede that Pansy’s right; anyone could’ve just grabbed them during the Battle and had them declared as “destroyed.”
” Harry says through gritted teeth, “You literally cannot change your past. Anything that happened in ‘96 already
Malfoy steps out first, his footsteps quiet on the ground, and offers Harry a hand. He actually looks at Harry this time, which Harry counts as an improvement. In fact, he’s looking at Harry more intently than he’s looked at Harry all night, and it’s startling what Malfoy’s stare does.
“Go shower,” Draco says again, because he doesn’t have any other words; he has to start reusing recent phrases. “Get clean.”
Parkinson’s already wide eyes go wider in alarm. “For Merlin’s sake, Potter, I’m a lesbian. That’s not what’s happening here.”
He has to lower his voice as they wind their ways through the halls, because, well, because four in the morning—funny, he suddenly doesn’t feel tired at all—but he hisses after Malfoy as loud as he dares.
“That you might…” Harry begins, letting go of Malfoy’s face to gesture at the two of them. Which Malfoy misses, because he’s still got his eyes closed.
Hermione looks faintly ill. “I thought he’d know that, if he was going back into time. Him especially, I’d expect him to prepare.” She pulls Malfoy’s trunk from under his bed and thumbs the latches. “The longer he stays there… the more likely it is that something bad will happen. We need to get there soon. May I?” This is directed at the trunk.
Harry came away with the idea that Draco was a major prude, and Draco had let him believe it. It was better than saying he didn’t want Harry to see the shape on his hip. Or on his chest.
“I thought it was obvious when I kissed you,” he says, looking down at Harry a little, his brow furrowed. “But I’m a kind of…”
That also qualifies as an answer. Or, rather, the look he’s giving Draco—one of horror—is an answer.
It’s true. These are the basics, and Harry’s done some research on scar-marks. Draco wants to reiterate, but he can tell Harry doesn’t want him to push the point, so he takes a fortifying breath and continues on. He talks about how people can have multiple soulmarks which always all point to the same person—save for some polyamorous people and the rare friendship mark—and these are often scars. How scars are never the first soulmark, because everyone is
So it makes sense that Harry gets off the broom and steps over to get in front of Malfoy and kisses him.
“I didn’t think so,” Malfoy says smugly, and hands him the jar, which turns out to be Floo powder. Malfoy’s already taken a pinch and is stepping forward for the fireplace.
regardless of what they teach, to the Fourth Years. Each subject has a different subsection of this.
He says this with a little more relish than he probably should’ve, given that Harry’s already sniffing out his feelings, but he doesn’t manage to keep it in. And it’s also very obvious how much Draco enjoyed marking Jacobs down, based on the violent red slashes that mark the errors.
“So I’m off-the-charts fucked up,” Harry says. “Maybe that’s just too much for someone to love.” And the way he says it, Draco can tell he’s been thinking it for a long time. A long, long time.
Malfoy’s eyes search his face for a moment, and then get stopped in their search somewhere around Harry’s mouth. Talk about mixed signals. “Yeah…” Malfoy says vaguely, “What? Yes. Fine. Take your hands off of me, Potter.”
“You’re his best friend!” objects another kid. Apparently, Draco’s intimidation does not apply where Harry Potter is being discussed. “Wouldn’t you know?”
, exactly. He doesn’t think—and maybe he’s completely wrong here—that Malfoy looks fondly on the day he got the Dark Mark at all; he’s always wearing long sleeves, even in the hot, hot midday sun, sweat glistening on his skin.
“I do,” Draco says again, forcing Harry to look at him, as if he could somehow get Harry to believe him with a little eye contact.
doesn’t even know it. The only person who knows it is the person who has the match, who looks at Harry Potter’s forehead and recognizes the same lines from the inside of his hip, covered by his trousers and his robes
“So you think he’s in a secret relationship,” says a boy in the corner. “He’s already found his soulmate.”
Fake, light laughter at the back of Draco’s throat; an easy quip is on the tip of Draco’s tongue. Instead, he says quietly, “How could you?”
Malfoy looks at him for what feels like ages, his grey eyes glinting in the moonlight and his expression unreadable. “It’s another good speech. Now tell me what you really think.”
Pansy waves her on, not really seeming to pay attention to the trunk at all. “So it’s possible we could pull him out with no consequences?”
“Wow.” Malfoy peers over at Harry, and his hair falls forward onto his forehead again. “You must be really tired.”
Harry keeps straining his ears, eyes darting about to see if anyone is coming, and catching Pansy looking his way, as if he’s going to break down as they pass through rooms that Harry… well, that Harry recognises. “I’ve been here, after the war,” he whispers up at her. “Don’t worry about it.”
“Mmm… no? I’ve won soccer games against him? I mean, I’ve played a hand in winning… but he’s a really good sport.” Butcher smiles to himself, sweet and pleased, looking down at his teacup.
bed, which Draco is sitting on. He smells like sweat and cut grass, like clean, outside air. “I don’t think chasing him down and questioning him counts.”
Draco misses Harry like a limb, like an internal organ, when he isn’t there. He makes sure to always be in his classroom, so he doesn’t miss a day with Harry, so Harry knows where to find him.
It doesn’t matter, anyway, because the next second, Malfoy is yanking his hands away and hurrying down towards Hogwarts’ doors, muttering something about sleep that Harry doesn’t catch.
Harry’s eyes flicker over him, something hot stealing into them. He glances up at Draco. “Er. Thank you for your concern.”
“Dated his girl the one time,” Michael says, and then considers. “Actually, also dated his ex-girlfriend. We traded spots. But it doesn’t seem like he holds it against me, if you know what I mean.”
Harry breathes out, moving slowly away from Hermione and towards Pansy, who’s inspecting the little hourglass figure and the rings, slipping the chain around her neck. It hadn’t really dawned on him—his brain is moving a bit slowly, still—that whatever Malfoy is to him, he’s a friend to Pansy. A long-time friend, perhaps her best friend. Whatever Malfoy is to
“What?” Pansy’s still grinning and chuckling like she’s just won the lottery. “You’ve wanted to ride Harry Potter’s broomstick for ages—”
before you’re twenty—so you don’t have to go searching every last corner of the world for them, if you want to find them.”
“Do you want to hear the full list?” Draco asks. “Or—even better—would you like to read the transcript I made of my Boyfriend Check with Jacob Jacobs? The strikes are circled in red.”
Michael Corner, dark-haired, bright-eyed, fit as a fiddle—puts his cup of tea down. “You already know my name,” he says. He points to them each in turn: “Draco Malfoy. Michael Corner. We went to Hogwarts together.”
—but it’s a completely different thing for Draco to press his hand to them, to feel them move under his fingers. “Oh, Merlin,” he says, wrinkling his nose. “You’re so disgusting, oh
Pansy gapes for about two minutes, at which point she seems moderately acclimated to it. “How long, do you think,” she demands, an edge to her voice.
” Harry practically shouts in Draco’s face, as if it were obvious. His green eyes are wild and his cheeks shine with tears. Draco thinks he should be crying, but he’s numb. He’s numb to it entirely. “Deserve
But Malfoy just makes a face at him like Harry’s something he’s deeply allergic to and pulls out his wand, Apparating them both with a
Draco can’t focus on studying, so he writes out a transcript of what he can remember from the little chat he’s had with Jacob Jacobs. It’s easy because he knows his questions well, and remembering responses is easier when he remembers the question.
“Don’t, then,” Draco says, and his voice breaks. “But you have to understand—tell me you hear what I’m saying. I
What did you say? I mean… I mean, what did you say? No—what—” His throat bobs, and he runs a hand through his hair, completely messing it up. It falls over his forehead, and Harry wants to brush it back again.
Which is a really harsh thing to say to Harry, who had a nightmare and then got woken up right after he’d
Harry deserves every single last thing in the entire world, every smile, every spark of happiness, every moment of hope and of joy and satisfaction and content.
the Dark Mark.” They’re both just staring at him. He growls and tries again: “Nothing that ever happened today changed that, whether it happened in the original today or in the today you messed with, because it’s the
“Yeah,” Harry says cheerfully, seemingly unaware of Draco’s thoughts, as if that isn’t the natural direction for the topic to stray towards. “Say, what
Harry’s the brightest part of Draco’s life, but it’s fine. The feeling isn’t mutual and the thing is, Draco doesn’t even mind because he can’t begrudge Harry Ron or Hermione or Teddy or the students that Harry genuinely adores. He can’t begrudge Harry
It takes Harry a moment to realize that’s what’s happening, because it’s such a turn around from where they were just a minute ago, but he can feel the knuckles of Malfoy’s fists where they brush the underside of his chin as Malfoy tugs him closer, he can feel Malfoy’s stubble scraping against his skin, and he can
The water splashes gently around the sides of the boat, and the rhythmic sound of the oars in the water fills the silence between them. Malfoy sits with his elbows on his knees, head tipped down to watch his fingers slowly move about, doing nothing. His hair is still messy and loose and white-blond in the starlight.
Harry shifts back and forth on his feet. The grass keeps ungrowing and then suddenly jumping back up before ungrowing again. “About what?”
Harry toys with the blanket and clears his throat a couple times but doesn’t say anything. At long last, he turns on the light, and Pansy puts her Lumos out, setting her wand down and fixing her hair.
A spark of mischief enters Harry’s expression. “Yeah I thought it would be a bit of a triumph to get that prick under me, you know? ‘S weird. Like… not a hate fuck, but a dislike fuck? What were his two strikes?”
“Yeah, well. It’s my job. As a friend.” It’s ridiculous how solemn he feels in a fucking translucent shirt.
is stupid. As if he isn’t entitled to feeling discontent just because some people have it worse, as if he isn’t entitled to feeling discontent because he’s always been upset about
“Yes, really!” Malfoy’s raising his voice, and in the silent night, it seems to echo across the water. “You’re already
There’s something hard and threatening in Harry’s voice, something that makes Draco’s heart beat faster. It’s fucking
,” Malfoy presses. He’s messing around on the mantle looking for something, and comes up with this little porcelain jar, decorated with not very friendly looking snakes in black and green.
Probably since he came here to find Malfoy and Malfoy had no idea he was coming, Harry gets over his surprise first.
“You know.” Leans even closer. Draco tries not to move, his breath stuck in his throat as Harry very nearly presses his face into Draco’s neck. “Like a bunch of things at once.”
A couple weeks later, Harry tells Draco he’s been asked who his soulmate is again. “Secret,” he answered.
He looks up at the rest of them before he starts thinking about Malfoy’s clothes. And maybe his underclothes.
Harry can’t help but bristle at that. He leans back to dismiss Malfoy, but the boat sloshes, so he leans forward again. Once he’s safely leaning forward, he demands, “What’s that supposed to mean? Maybe I’ve never been a Death Eater, but you don’t think I’ve made mistakes too? I’d have killed for a Time-Turner when—when I got my godfather killed.”
Harry considers Pansy, who has dropped his arm in favor of gesturing sharply with pointing fingers and violent chopping motions. “Let me get dressed,” he says. Pansy rolls her eyes again, but waves her hand in the universal
“I feel…” Harry’s eyes flutter open, and he sits back just far enough to look Draco in the eye. “I feel like I’ve been searching for you.”
“I’ll show you bite,” Draco mutters. He shoots off a quick Cleaning Charm pointedly and gives his lesson plan one last glance before he folds it neatly into the pocket of his robes. He expects Harry to shoot something back in return, but Harry’s looking at him with flushed cheeks, uncharacteristically unresponsive.
,” Harry snaps back so harshly, he’s almost growling. He’s standing now, shoving his papers into a bag almost hard enough to rip them. “I’m sure you have your reasons for not
Pansy’s quiet for a moment. “I’m… Thank you for your help,” she says finally, “But I don’t think you two should come.” She points to Hermione and Ron. And then, hurriedly, she repeats, “But thank you, really.”
This is what he doesn’t understand about Harry: the trying out. So many people. Does he really never feel a spark that tells him
himself to memorizing Harry’s studying habits, it’s just that he’s spent so much time studying with Harry that he knows: Harry’s just not going to stop until he finds something to write. And then he’s going to write like the wind in that horrid handwriting for five minutes and fill half the paper. And then he’s going to do some more tapping.
“Nope!” He’s too cheerful, too careless. He could be lying his way through this and Draco wouldn’t even be able to tell because it wouldn’t be a bad faith lie, just a good old lie of convenience and impatience.
Harry tells himself he doesn’t notice that Malfoy smells good, smells a little bit of sweat but mostly of cologne that’s probably worth more than Harry’s entire wardrobe. It’s not his fault his nose has to be so close to Malfoy’s neck, or that the human nose has evolved to pick up scent, or that Malfoy chose to be so fucking hot.
” he repeats back at Harry, his voice breaking again, “Do you know what happens to Dissonant soulmates, Harry? It
Draco ignores this comment, though his cheeks burn red. Harry’s joking. Friends make jokes. But he’s imagined it too many times for his brain
Harry drops Malfoy’s gaze and follows Malfoy up the stairs when Malfoy finally goes. “Who’s fault is that, you ungrateful idiot? Didn’t you even check the time frame for time travel?”
It isn’t that it hadn’t really occurred to Harry that he’d encounter any Slytherins at any point in the night. Although he
It takes Draco a couple of seconds to rewind their conversation so he can figure out what Harry’s talking about.
“Draco, please.” Harry’s eyes flicker with something Draco’s never seen before when he’s talking about any of his boyfriends: Flustered. Urgent. In… love. “How do you feel about Harry Potter?”
“You’re terrible at explaining,” Malfoy says eventually, “But despite this, I’m bright enough to gather what you mean. I mean, you’re really shit.” He turns to Pansy, pointing to Harry. “What possessed you to bring this idiot?”
in different places. At least one of the soulmates’ soulmarks will be easily visible: on the hand, face, neck, or forearm. There is a myth that all scars are soulmarks. False. Only very significant scars—near death, emotionally significant, so on—will transfer as a soulmark. That is why scarmarks are so rare.”
him? Merlin’s tits. You’ve grown up.” She straightens and flashes a smile at them. “I’ll just go right inside, so that you boys can kiss, or fly, or whatever you need to do.”
Malfoy’s full on frozen, a complete statue, his expression blank and unreadable. He doesn’t look like he’s breathing; Harry probably has just killed him.
The Lumos charm Malfoy has going flickers out, and when Harry recasts, Malfoy’s looking away from him, frowning. The Time-Turner between them spins and spins and spins.
That’s—” Harry frowns, and Draco feels a spike of something black and unfriendly towards Butcher. “That’s rude. He’s just—he’s nice when you get to know him.”
The other half are Muggles exempt from the Statute of Secrecy—mostly siblings of Muggleborn Wizards. They’ve only heard of Harry Potter in passing, second-hand.
“I think,” says Harry frantically, because the Slytherin dorms are right around the corner, which means the night is about to end, and who knows if they’ll ever be able to pick this back up again if they put it down now, “That I would like to let you ride my broomstick.”
Because people were bullied off of talking to him, but Harry doesn’t say it. Harry doesn’t really talk about bullying with Draco. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out why not.
“Mother of Merlin,” Pansy says, almost wonderingly. She turns to Malfoy, this smile Harry doesn’t understand on her lips. “
And finally, Draco’s hair is as dry as it will get through the work of the towel, so Draco hangs it back up.
You sound like a bloody health care provider, not my best mate. What are you asking them, if they have an STI?”
saying anything directly to Harry, but laughing at all Malfoy’s jokes and sending Harry mildly pitying looks on cue.
Draco’s gut twists. He thinks of skinny, muscled, soccer-player Butcher under Harry, looking nervous and eager.
“Right there!” Pansy screams over the wind, one arm locked around Harry’s waist and the other pointing rather precariously in front of them.
He looks up at Malfoy then, his eyebrows raised. Malfoy’s looking back, and he no longer looks like he’s about to faint. His cheeks are flushed pink.
Pansy makes another frustrated noise, but she pushes on, seeming to elect to ignore the fact that Ron has sat himself on the edge of Harry’s bed and is listening intently.
feels about soulmates, he’d like to teach soulmates to the kids as well as he possibly can. He wants them to find the happiness that he aches for.
He can see Pansy setting her shoulders, putting on a brave face, can hear Ron step up behind him, can feel Hermione take his hand and squeeze it once, and he knows that they can tell he’s shifted gears; everybody sort of straightens up. It makes something press on his chest just a little—just that much more expectation.
, you listened to me wonder and you listened to me convince myself that I’m not—that I didn’t deserve—”
“Oooh stop! In the name of the law!” Malfoy mocks, not stopping. Actually, he’s speeding up a little, like he wants to get away without Harry noticing. “Gryffindor Tower is
“Ah…” Draco doesn’t know what else to say. His brain has stopped working. His stomach is a wild mass of butterflies. “That’s… good.”
“Sure, if you believe that.” Harry doesn’t need to turn to see the exasperation in Pansy’s expression; he can hear it just fine in her voice. “He has another time turner in his trunk, and I want to go after him.”
Harry considers Malfoy as Malfoy Transfigures them a boat—his concentrated look, the way his hair shines in the starlight, much whiter-looking this time, the angular cut of his face and of his skinny frame, black blotting out the starlight on the water so that it looks like his silhouette is a black cut-out with a halo.
Harry’s furrowed brow eases, and he smiles. False cheer. Draco can tell. “I’m alright,” he says. “It’s not like I don’t know all this stuff.”
“So?” The Hufflepuff girl asks Draco in class, her smile soft. “What’s it feel like, being together with your soulmate?”
“We have lesson plans to finish,” Draco says without looking up from his own scroll. The paper is about how to go about managing the now-mandatory Health Ed lesson given by
Malfoy doesn’t seem to realize it’s rhetorical. “Leave it alone, Potter,” he mutters lowly, and snatches the broom from Harry’s hand as if Harry has just fiercely insulted him. The scowl has returned, but it disappears for a moment when he looks at the broom in his hand in confusion. “You’re going to let me ride your broom?” he asks incredulously.
Pansy takes off across the Malfoy grounds, probably in the direction of wherever they keep their brooms. “You were kissing a minute ago. I don’t see how this is my fault.”
And my scar is—” He pushes up his hair with a jerky, forceful hand. “—Prominent. If this was my soulmark, my soulmate would’ve found me by now. Not to mention we’re fated to find our soulmates.”
Malfoy takes a step back, almost hitting the wall, and turns away, opening his mouth like he’s going to shout at Pansy before realizing that it’s four thirty in the morning. He turns back to Harry. “I can’t believe you saw that.”
“I have hands-on experience.” Harry peers over his shoulder. Draco’s on the same page as he was fifteen minutes ago:
Draco wonders if Harry can see his nipples—probably yes—and his Dark Mark—probably yes. He’s been around Harry naked before, but he’s never been in a basically shirtless state without the proper emotional preparation. Emotional preparation mostly consists of the internal speech:
things before: impending doom, abuse, Death Eaters. Voldemort. He doesn’t know how to deal with the little things, things that don’t have to do with physical harm.
Harry grins. “Have you?” He’s pulling off his shirt and stepping closer to Draco at the same time. Or, rather, stepping closer to his own bed, which happens to also means he’s stepping closer to
Malfoy makes a high noise in his throat, his hands hanging loosely at his sides, his eyes not leaving Harry’s face. Harry’s pretty sure he’s going to die. “I—what—why did you…
Malfoy manages to look away, in spite of Harry holding his face still. He casts his eyes to the sky and clenches his jaw—also strange to feel—and then closes his eyes. He really seems to not enjoy looking at Harry. “What?” he says, rather impatiently.
