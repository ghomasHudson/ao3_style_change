“Of course I was,” Blaise smirked as he wiped at his mouth, throwing his napkin down on the plate with a satisfied sigh. “About what in particular, though? I do like to keep score.”
Harry smiled despite himself and his Father-in-law’s love of everything muggle. He nodded, knowing that he needed to say something. He needed to discuss it with Ginny first. If they were going to tell them, it needed to come from them both.
Draco nodded as he sipped his water. “It’s true; I’ll never understand it.”
Harry tried to swallow around the lump in his throat.
The bell for lunch rang as the three Weasley children approached the desk, lingering as the rest of the class disappeared.
“I just can’t believe it; Someone cheated on Harry Potter.”
Neither Hermione nor Ron had seen Malfoy at the Ministry during the Wizengamot trials, choosing to stay away. Harry shuddered as he remembered Malfoy’s state when he was carted in before the Wizengamot. Harry had completely blotted the thoughts from his mind, but speaking to Malfoy had brought them all to the fore. He shuddered at the memory of Malfoy’s haunted eyes and broken body, so at odds with the healthy and strong man Harry had seen tonight.
“Kreacher will not hear of it,” the elf protested, letting the Christmas decorations crash to the ground. They really would be thrown out decorations now. “What is Master wanting?”
“It was organised with Patrik last week.” He smirked as he popped the cork on the wine. He began pouring out their glasses before holding one out to Draco.
“Thanks, Ted”
“I know, Patrik” She smiled and rolled her eyes “There is only one Harry Potter that would be good enough for Draco!”
“True” Harry admitted, “Maybe I just want to treat you well and ruin you for all other men.” Harry continued.
Harry nodded. He could see why Draco was so interested in the reserves, besides the dragons of course. There was so much history to glean from small intimate exchanges such as these.
Draco let out a breath and nodded, his nerves riling up again at the prospect.
The sudden burst of sound and activity seemed to raise his spirits somewhat as he waited for the kettle to boil. From the kitchen, the day looked dark as the low cloud and rain pelted the basement windows. He bit his lip as his mind wandered to the mundane tasks he had to look forward to at work. He felt his eyes roll at the thought of it. He huffed as he dreamed about leaving that job for something else.
“I asked about Weasley and Granger, and he asked about my wife,” Draco aimed a loaded stare at Blaise, who laughed. Draco paused as his mind recalled everything from the night before. “Do you think it was strange that the Weaslette wasn’t there?”
Harry smirked, before an overwhelming sense of weariness, overwhelmed him. Sighing, he went to stand, pulling on his own jacket. He smiled at them all as he grabbed the green one. The material felt cool and soft against his fingers as he hooked it over his arm.
Harry smirked but cleared his throat, and they all stopped and looked at him.
Harry laughed, almost choking on a flower. He cleared his throat before Patrik started to speak.
Harry paused for a moment and then rolled his eyes as he sat down properly.
“You okay, Moon?” He called. The pale girl blushed bright red and nodded nervously. Roxanne gave him the thumbs up as they swapped.
“Thanks,” He smiled shyly, his pride disappearing into modesty. “There’s a job going as DADA teach; you should apply, Harry!”
“You leave me no time to get everything made up.” She growled, “I will make something for you, you silly” She muttered something in Swedish which Draco assumed were swear words or insults. “What do you want?” She asked, her tone less hostile but still business-like.
Draco closed his eyes, wondering where to start.
“I am hungry, but I can get it.”
“Invite you for tea? I did not invite you around for tea,” Draco replied dismissively.
“Good thinking, but don’t leave it too long.”
If Peppin had delivered the letter, then either Malfoy couldn’t send the reply or didn’t want to. If, however, Peppin hadn’t, then Malfoy wouldn’t reply to something he hadn’t received. Would he look foolish if he sent another owl so soon? Did he care? He shook his head more to himself. He just wanted to return the jacket so that they could move on and get on with their lives.
“What happened? Is he alright?” Teddy asked, his voice high. Harry felt his pulse speed up as they waited for the redhead to answer.
“Where’s Pansy, Neville?” Luna asked, “I still have a slice of your cake in my bottom drawer.”
He looked around in surprised as he passed through Ron’s bubble. “Fascinating, You’ll have to teach me this spell, Hermione.” Ron cleared his throat as Hermione had the good sense to blush.
“Looking at this image, I would have to agree.” He studied the picture for a moment longer before shaking his head. “This is remarkable work. And the eyes.” He trailed off before glancing back to Draco. “Did you experience any of the believed effects from their gaze?”
“That’s very kind, Harry. Are you sure you couldn’t eat more?” Her warm eyes smiled down at him, and Harry could see the concern in them as if he was wasting away to nothing.
“You did that on purpose.” Draco accused with mock suspicion.
Blaise raised a knowing eyebrow and smirked before he leant closer. “If what Lucasta Lloyd told me is correct, it’s not strange at all!” He whispered conspiratorially.
I look forward to your reply,
Draco knew he would have to write them all and thank them for their kind words. The two men knew him the best, and both knew how difficult it would be for him to return. Their words of confidence were greatly appreciated. Mihaela, on the other hand, was a mystery to Draco. They hadn’t socialised or spoken other than about work-related topics. He wondered why she had felt the need to commend him. He would write and see if he could glean any more information.
Short version... Pansy tried to get Draco killed as well as throwing obstacles in their way at every turn. If you want to know more, I suggest you go read it ;) ;) ;)
“Christmas ham,” Draco explained as Harry frowned. “And Julbord is like a Christmas buffet, very traditional,”
“Who you owling? You don’t normally put this much effort when you owl people.”
“I managed to incapacitate the ladies and confiscate their wands after Draco collapsed, which was only a few moments before you arrived. You know the rest.” Blaise finished.
Shit! He thought again as he tried to gather his thoughts. What had they been talking about before he’d spotted the blond? Harry opened his mouth to speak when he noticed that Malfoy was moving -towards them. He felt hyperaware of his every movement. He couldn’t deal with this right now. He would not make a fool of himself in front of Draco Malfoy.
“So Malfoy’s alright?” Harry confirmed, ignoring the mention of the job, shaking his head in answer to Teddy’s question resulting in the youth’s hair going grey and limp as the boy pouted.
Weasley fidgeted against the bed as he bit his lip. Draco’s eyes narrowed as he began to speak.
“Are you mad?” Said Ron, at the same time.
“Mr Malfoy, It appears-”
Draco looked at his cane and nodded, slowly removing the dark wand from the cane’s sheath. He used magic as little as possible these days. Because every time he grasped the imposter wand, he couldn’t help but think of all the things he had done in service for the Dark Lord. His mind replayed the moment his first wand abandoned him. The wooden stem spinning in midair as it escaped from his hands and into Harry’s waiting fist. His wand had failed in favour of the-boy-who-live-twice. That was the moment Draco knew with any certainty that he was on the wrong side of the war.
“Indeed, it is.” Blaise agreed, holding up his own glass of wine. “Here’s to new beginnings and new experiences.” He offered his glass, and Draco gently met it with his own with a small clink. They smiled as they sipped the contents.
His stomach growled loudly, and he realised that he had skipped lunch again. Heaving himself up,  he left the smell of burning plastic behind him as he headed towards the kitchen. Muttering floated up the stairs as he ran down them, and he paused in the door as he watched the little elf moving around the room.
All he had ever wanted was a pair of arms to hold him together when the world threatened to tear him apart. Yes, Voldemort was dead. Yes, the war was over for everyone else, Never for him. He felt so alone like it was him against the world. He guessed that Malfoy had felt the same in sixth year; no one to talk to, no one telling him that everything would be ok. He could see so many parallels between them where only one choice changed everything.
“Hermione?” he asked but sniffed when Harry shook his head. “Rolf?” he guessed again but gaped when Harry shook his head again. “How, in Salazar Slytherin’s name did you find me if it wasn’t those two?”
“It is a complication, but from what I can tell, it stems from a pre-existing condition and not related to the incident.”
“Who’s jacket is it, Harry?” asked Hermione as she sat next to Ron.
“It’s alright, Ron,” Granger shot him an icy glance before turning her back to him, her bushy, dark hair completely hiding her face from view.
“I’m pretty confident” replied Roxanne with a broad smile on her dark, freckled cheeks.
“Open the box,” Harry said his smile building in intensity.
Neville smiled, looking relieved. “Good! She’s different from school. I reckon you’d like her. Just give her a chance,”
Mrs Weasley had already made her feelings known, and he wasn’t sure he knew how Ron and Hermione would take the news. Hermione already knew, he was sure of it, and it would surprise no one if she did, but Ron. He shook his head. Ron would pitch a fit, and their relationship would warp into something strange, tension-filled.
“So would you like to tell me, in your own words, what happened?”
“Where am I?” He asked, his voice sounding surprisingly calm, completely at odds to how he felt.
“Since school, started training right after the war,” He nodded. “What about you? Heard you’re working at the Governo Magico these days.”
“Your Harry is with Patrik.”
“How do you know all this?” Asked Harry, feeling woefully ill-informed.
“I am nothing, if not persistent.” He joked before standing to kiss her. “So, Harry, Are you ready to help me?”
He towelled himself dry and hooked the towel around his hips before turning to his clothes. Draco had brought his bag to him from the chalet and, with some hesitation, left him alone with the shower. He picked his clothes; luckily, he always packed extra. He pulled on his jeans and then grabbed the first t-shirt. It had become one of his favourites. He’d never been proud of his body. Growing up wearing clothes three sizes too big and also being underfed and underweight had always made him feel like a runt, just like his aunt Marge said. Next to Ron, he felt like a house-elf. However, he had always tried to remain fit and trim.
“Well, I’ll try not to, but I can guarantee that Mum won’t be knitting him a Christmas jumper any time soon!” They both laughed. “But seriously, Mate. Are you alright?” Harry nodded, not knowing how to explain his ambivalence toward the split.
“Happy Birthday” Harry muttered as Draco yawned, pulling him closer as he hoped every birthday from now on would be like this.
Teddy shrugged as he gripped his cup, avoiding his gaze.
“That does sound like something I would do,” Blaise smirked again and nodded, tapping his long finger against his cheek thoughtfully. “Either way, whichever “truth” you want to believe. I was not expecting you to flash me as I flooed in.” Blaise nodded in approval. “Very nice, by the way.”
“Where did you learn to cook, Harry?” It was Harry’s turn to blush slightly. He cleared his throat again before talking.
“No, I’m not very hungry tonight. Thank you, though.”
Harry shrugged in reply, surprising himself with his tact. “You?”
“How about, I tell you this if you tell me one detail about our wedding or honeymoon that I don’t already know?” Harry raised his eyebrow expectantly, a smug smile playing on his face, and both he and Draco knew that he had already won.
“I must be out of practice. Please, oh, Great-One. Teach me the ways of polite conversation.” He bowed sarcastically before perching himself on the stone wall. He jumped off with a shout. “Salazar, that’s cold!” before sitting on the step across from him warily.
“Harry!” Draco breathed “Someone might spot us,” He moaned, barely able to focus.
The tap at the window sent him sprawling out of bed with a cry. He cradled his racing heart in his hand as he glared at the unfamiliar owl at the window. The letter obviously wasn’t from Luna as she had convinced a raven to be her courier. He stood slowly before moving towards the high window, pushing it open to allow the owl entry.
He stepped to one side out of the sea of people when he was bumped from behind by someone else emerging from the fire. He took another deep and steadying breath as he looked at the faces surrounding him.  He knew he’d find no friendly faces here. He kept his head down as he rejoined the crowd, slowly sweeping towards the lifts.
“Yes Master Draco, I am bringing your mothers card for your birthday,” Draco nodded, still confused, It had been many years since he had received a birthday card from his mother.
“Blaise!” Draco snapped.
She smiled but shook her head in despair as she went to wave her wand. The plate suddenly levitated towards Ron, who grinned. Molly tutted but smirked as she walked back to the other end of the table.
There was a tap at the window drawing Draco’s attention. Pepin stood outside, tapping energetically.
He studied one of the newest outfits he’d recently acquired, hanging from a nearby bookshelf. The pale blue shirt complimented the navy blue trousers and looked great with the new brown shoes he’d paired with the ensemble. But the more he looked, the more he knew that his missing green jacket would’ve set it off beautifully.
“This is not a conversation I intend on having naked.” Draco huffed as he crossed his arms across his chest.
The bell tinkled, filling the shop with the sound of delicate chimes as they pushed in. It had been a long time since he had last been to Diagon Alley. But, it felt the same as it had that distant day all nineteen years previous. The day his letter came, with his supply list for his first year at Hogwarts.
Ron roared with laughter as they squealed in shock, breaking apart and cursing the poltergeist.
Harry grinned before raising an eyebrow.
“Indeed it has, very long,” Draco muttered, feeling unsteady and suddenly vulnerable.
“It’s Christmas?” Malfoy offered,
“What would be easy and quick for you to make?”
“So, you’re not having second thoughts yet?” Harry asked quietly.
Draco frowned. That voice… he felt the nerves build up in his stomach as he waited for the owner to appear. He had spent nineteen years trying to forget that voice-- The way it made him feel. He had hoped that by isolating himself with Astoria and Scorpius, he could forget the thoughts that had hounded him most of his school life. It had almost worked too. It had been so long since he had dreamt of bottle-green eyes staring into his own, burning in their intensity.
“I apologise. I know it’s nothing to do with the case. The thing is, Charlie usually owls every week; however, we’ve not heard anything in over three. So I just wanted to check that he was alright, y’know, for mum.”
“Ron!” Hermione chided as he digressed.
“Not that I saw,” Blaise replied, hand still on Draco’s arm. He felt comforted by the gesture.
“Seriously, though.” Harry asked his face sobering “You don’t want to wait and have a bigger wedding next year?”
“Master will be most pleased. Must have forgotten. Yes,” Harry slowly pushed into the room to see Kreacher levitating decorations around the room. Harry smiled despite himself. So it was Kreacher who was the colour-blind elf. It all made sense.
The voice laughed.
“Molly’s class, third year.” He replied, “We’re going to be covering Boggarts today, which should be fun.”
“Oh and, Uncle? Draco really loves chocolate.” Ted grinned and winked before he left the room. Harry stood blinking at the door as he felt a cold thrill of anxiety rush down his spine. What did Ted mean? And why did Harry need to know that? If he didn’t know better, he’d say that Ted was trying to set them up.
“You guys have got half an hour; if you’re still here after that, I’ll give you all detention.” He warned before turning to go.
Without fail, there would be at least three journalists waiting for him at the floos in St Mungo’s, digging around for details about his life. Sometimes they wanted feedback on the most recent Romilda Vane article. Then, when it was a dry news day, they would ask him about the Harpies and Ginny’s career. The whole routine had been going on for so long he knew most of the Prophet reporters by first name, last name, birthday and was even familiar with some family members.
Neville’s smile brightened as he looked around the room, trying to locate his bride. “Erm, last I saw her, she was with Blaise and Theo. Did you hear? Professor Corning retired last year, and Pansy got his job. She’ll be the new Alchemy professor?” He grinned proudly, and Harry knew immediately that even if it was an arranged marriage, to begin with, it had resulted in a love match, certainly on Neville’s part anyway.
If he could achieve a foothold in England and make it home again, all the stress would be worth it. Wasn’t it a good omen that he was already on better terms with Harry? Nodding, he felt slightly better about his decision.
“Yeah, It’ll be great. We’ve not had a party here since I got my Hogwarts letter.”
“And how would you know? You always have your face stuck in a book over on the Ravenclaw table,” Fred called back. It was always a shock to see Fred, so much like his dad and namesake, but there was no mistaking the two with Angelina’s colouring. Even with the darker skin, the red hair won out. They started to bicker between themselves as Molly rested her hands on her hips.
“You’re so beautiful!” he muttered as he brushed Draco’s dishevelled hair from his face. Draco’s breath hitched at the unexpected compliment. “I don’t think I can bear being away from you for this long again!”
“Because we were able to capture you,”
“Potter and Shafiq must be near that if not older, and they’d be crazy to get rid of either of them.”
He wondered where he could go with this lead. Maybe retracing the hiker’s steps, but that seemed like a fool’s errand. No, he needed to speak to the widower and family. See whether they could guess where she may have been painting. He opened his eyes as he reached for his quill but was distracted by someone standing in front of his desk.
The inside was larger than the outside and was fit to bursting with different ceramics stacked precariously on the floor to wall shelves. His eyes catalogued everything quickly, looking for something in particular. Something caught his eyes, and he headed there first. The black and electric blue mug caught his eye.
Harry nodded as the Weasley patriarch stood and left him. He glanced up to see Ron and Hermione looking at him.
“Thank you.” He replied apprehensively. She waved her wand over him, causing the air to shimmer slightly. Before Draco could make sense of it, the air cleared, and the mediwitch began making notes on her clipboard. He looked at her patiently as he waited for her diagnosis. After a few more moments, she looked up with a stern look.
“Secret lover? What? Who is it?”
“Please, sit.” Rolf offered as he pushed himself up onto the table, crossing his legs before him.
“Come on; let’s get you home. You’ve got work tomorrow to look forward to.” A new shiver of trepidation tingled down his spine as Blaise took the untouched chocolate from his hands and helped him off the bed. His legs wobbled for a moment, and he certainly would’ve fallen back onto the bed if Blaise hadn’t been holding his arm.
“Whatever you need, Harry,” She replied, her voice almost lost in the din as he scrambled to the door.
“About last night” Harry started putting his spoon down and looking between them, “Thank you so much for letting me stay and helping me arrange the surprise.”
“He makes you very happy,” She said, not as a question. Draco nodded as a smile formed of its own accord on his lips.
“Obviously, Molly hasn’t kept ‘things’ to herself, and I just wanted to let you know. Nothing will change around here.” He smiled warmly, and Harry felt some of the tension leave him. “You should probably tell the others before the prophet gets wind of it, though. Do it like a muggle and rip the plaster off quick. I think that’s the saying.”
“Draco, are you alright?” Rolf grabbed his hand and helped him up. His cheek throbbed as his face flushed with heat. A trip jinx, he’d put money on it. “Trip jinx, was it? Did you see who cast it?”
“Well, I can assure you that you have already achieved your goal, back in school in fact,”
“A sweetheart?” Scoffed Hermione.
“Are you sure you’re not Hermione’s child?” Harry asked, smirking again. In response, his hair grew darker and curlier, sticking up in every which way. Harry snorted. “That’s more like it,”
“Yes, I was under the impression that Ms Dalca wasn’t an admirer of my work.” He replied dryly. His mind flashed back to the petite, exotic Romanian who had bickered and griped with him, questioning every decision he made. He had often caught her eyes lingering on the scar on his arm and assumed that she was offended by his presence.
“You looked cold,” He replied with a shrug. Harry waited for him to go on, but the silence stretched on.
“Seriously?” Blaise said, shaking his head with a smirk on his face.
“Harry!” Hermione said, “If you splice yourself, I won’t be visiting you at St Mungo’s!”
“Luna has told me much about you and your initiative and ingenuity. She also regaled me with your adventures, and I am struggling to think of anyone better suited. Your work in Romania has been highly commended by the supervisors there. I even have several personal commendations from some of your co-workers from the reserve. Misters Torren MacFusty and Charlie Weasley and also Ms Mihaela Dalca all speak very highly of you.”
"Tre e Viverna" is Italian for the "Three and Wyvern" which is in reference to the Golden Trio escaping Gringotts on the dragon.
“Nothing like that.” Ron dismissed with a wave of his hand. “She would react the same if it were Ginny. It’s just Malfoy. She doesn’t like or trust him.”
“Really?” He asked, his eyes narrowing suspiciously, as though trying to catch him out.
Draco felt his eyes widen at the thought and shivered. The concept of any creatures getting in through his ears made him feel slightly queasy.
“Blaise?” He croaked.
“You alright, Harry?” Mr Weasley whispered as he sat down in the empty seat next to him, patting his back as he did so. Harry swallowed the panic and fought to smile as he nodded. However, he knew the smile didn’t reach his eyes.
He couldn’t do it! Two weeks were two weeks too long. Two weeks of waking up covered in tiny strips of metallic plastic. Two weeks of fighting off a glitter-induced migraine. It had only been 2 minutes.
There was a saying in Italy that “you should sell your coat and buy Betony” as its healing properties were too numerous to count. Hops and Feverfew were hardly surprising either as both were known relaxants, both commonly used as migraine treatments. As soon as the liquid had oozed it’s way down his throat, he felt the pain in behind his eyes recede and the churning in his stomach grind to a halt. He waited to feel the steam out of his ears, but when nothing happened, he quirked an eyebrow at Blaise. He shrugged back. “It’s Italian.” As if that explained everything, and in a way, it did. The Italians were well known for their potion tinkering and mastery. Da Vinci was known as a leading potioneer in the wizarding world.
“I would hardly think that you would know anything about my character as I’ve not seen a hair from your copper head in neigh on 15 years.” He hadn’t resorted to insults. He was proud of that; And to think that he worried about whether he’d grown as a person.
“About bloody time!” Harry replied, “I’ve got class in 5 mins.”
Ron opened his mouth to say something, confusion on his face. There was a bang as he jumped. He grimaced
“Alright,” Draco said, intrigued. “Can I touch it?” Harry nodded.
He’d skipped lunch, for which his stomach was growling in protest, but as he sat in the near-empty office, he found he didn’t regret the decision. In this newfound quiet, he was able to better focus on what he was trying to do. After Rolf had mentioned the missing people, he wondered whether there could be more disappearances that had yet been unreported. He knew he needed to look into all the old records but wasn’t yet ready to venture to the archives.
“I’m sure he did something to that poor witch. He is a Slytherin, after all. Just cause you didn’t see it in their memories doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. Remember the poor Bell girl?”
“You said presents?” He asked, “What on earth-” The box shook for a second before it began growing. Understanding dawned on his face. He should have thought of that. He raised an eyebrow at Harry who smiled smugly from the flames.
“Honestly, Uncle,” Teddy said earnestly as he stood up. “We just wanted some time together before I leave. We won't stay up late, I promise,”
“Ah” replied Patrik. “I will leave you to speak with your Hem Nisse. Come down when you are finished” He smiled as he left the room, closing the door behind him.
“Wow, so much food!” Said Harry, his eyes wide.
Anxiety twisted the knot in his stomach, and he lay down on the floor, the cold stone warmer now due to the fire. His world narrowed down to the next breath and the next heartbeat as he tried to reign in his emotions. With each deafening boom of his heart, he could pull in slightly more air until he was raggedly wheezing into the material of the chair. He panted as relief seeped through him, calming his nervous system.
”Or if you want to trade stories. Just ask for me at the main reception at the Ministry, and I’ll escort you down to the bullpen.”
“Master has some ham in the larder.” The elf croaked.
“Mr Potter wanted to know whether you still have your replacement wand,” Scorpius added, his eyes narrowing slightly.
“When you saw the flash, did you hear the witch utter any words?” Draco shook his head, only remembering Blaise’s voice.
“The Granger-Weasley’s are fine, and yes, they had kids,”  Harry said with a roll of his eyes.
“About a week ago, before I left Romania. He was perfectly unharmed when we parted.” Draco bit his lip and rested his face on his knee’s” He tried not to think of Charlie Weasley. He didn’t need any more complications right now.
Draco opened his mouth to object when Weasley cut him off.
“Have you been to Azkaban, Hermione?” Harry asked, looking down at his glass.
“I knew a walk was what the healer ordered,” Draco replied as they walked between the other buildings. A few other people walked past, waving hello to them both as they busied along with their work. Draco instinctively thought of Charlie back in Romania and felt his heart twist slightly. He’d received a letter from Charlie just before he’d left for Sweden, begging for him to reconsider before they decided to tie the knot. The letter went into some detail which Draco closed his eyes to try and blot out. He blinked hard, trying to forget the letter, wishing he could burn it from his mind as he had burned it in their fire. Harry knew about the letter but not what it said. For that, Draco was relieved.
“So what are you up to in the office? You’ve been in there all morning.” Ted smirked innocently as he ignored the comment about his relationship with the oldest Weasley grandchild. Harry rolled his eyes before rubbing his face in frustration.
His thoughts drifted back to Weasley and the hospital. What could he possibly know about him? He found his mind drifting back to Charlie and his long hair and green eyes. They were the wrong type of green, though. He’d often thought it; The green of dragon scales or seaweed. He’d caught himself so many times wishing that they were brighter, like sunlight through leaves or shimmering emeralds, and every time, he slapped himself down for wanting to change him. He closed his eyes to banish the thoughts of Charlie and the hurt that came with it. He would not waste his Sunday thinking about what could have been.
He blanched as he swigged directly from the bottle, sure that some pureblood ancestor was no doubt rolling around in their portrait in disgust as he performed such an uncouth act. He swigged more, defying his ancestors to do something about it. It was somewhere around his fifth swig that the first gasp erupted from his mouth; even the whiskey’s burn was unable to cauterise the wounds inside him.
“I know you’re tired Malfoy, I’ve only got a few more questions, and then I’ll leave you to rest.” Draco nodded, not wanting to open his eyes against the harsh light.
He climbed up the main steps and pushed open the door.
“You falling to sleep already?” Rolf asked brightly, laughter evident in his eyes.
Please send your reply with Peppin as soon as possible.
“Chocolate, please.” Blaise’s grin grew broad as if he had been expecting the answer, his laugh echoing down the corridor as he left.
“The wedding was wonderful.” Luna smiled brightly.
“Pepin’s just arrived,” Draco said as he climbed to his feet.
“Yeah, He ended up with Charlie at the Romanian Dragon Reserve in the end, so we were able to keep good tabs on him there.”
He paused, recalling the first moment the Healer had told them that they would never conceive. He remembered the reverberating silence in that small office, like a stone thrown into a well, waiting for it to hit the water.
“Zabini made a citizen’s arrest. She and her friend were floating mid-air in a body bind jinx when I got there. If Malfoy hadn’t been writhing on the floor, it would’ve been funny.”
The mediwitch stood and looked at him for a moment before resheathing her wand for a second time. She narrowed her eyes at him as if trying to figure something out.
Orla Dinwiddie was a half-blood witch, early forties, mother of four and a painter by trade. There were no warning markers Draco could see to suggest foul play or fraud. Her file explained that she would often frequent the peaks to paint. She was a highly skilled witch and was considered a local wise woman in the surrounding muggle community, aiding neighbours with tinctures, decoctions, and poultices. The act bordered on breaching the statute of secrecy, but no charges were pressed as magic was never witnessed.
He wondered what cock and bull story it would be tomorrow, wondering whether word of his inevitable divorce had filtered through yet. He closed his eyes, dreading the shit storm that was on the horizon when that little detail got out. He snorted soberly as he considered the spin the Prophet would put on the story. Harry would probably be leaving Ginny to be with Romilda if she could tell her story.
“Erm,” Harry replied, confused as to who he was answering.
“Can anyone see Peeves on here?”  Harry asked as he lay the map down. They crowded around to look at all the small dots.
“How are you here?” Draco asked, still not ready to believe that it was real.
Hermione’s eyes widened, “Can he see? I’ve had so many cases come across my desk where the recipient has gone permanently blind.”
“Alright.” He agreed, smirking at the broad grin spreading across his face. “So, what else do you have to study before you go back to school? Three weeks off really isn’t enough, is it?” Harry replied sarcastically with a roll of his eyes.
“Yes, darling boy. It’s just been a long time, and things were so very different before.” He said, avoiding Scorpius’s intrusive gaze.
They all watched as the punch bowl floated up and slowly tipped over onto the lover’s unsuspecting heads.
“See, you know me so well,” Draco smiled before putting another kebab in his mouth. He paused for a moment before turning to Harry again. “So, seriously, how did you find me?”
“Gosh, It’s hot, isn’t it? I don’t suppose you could get me a drink?” Hermione asked Ron. He rolled his eyes with a smirk as he stood up.
“Italian? Where’s that?” Draco asked as he finished messing with his scarf.
“Come on, you horrible lot; it’s time for bed.” He pulled out his map and checked to see where Filch was. Even after almost seventeen years, Filch, still looking as ancient as ever, prowled the halls looking for students he could punish. “Right, Dominique, Rose and Lucy. You go. Filch is up by Gryffindor tower. Ted, say goodnight to Victoire,” They all bid good night to each other before the three Ravenclaws and Teddy disappeared back through the portrait.
They were walking through icy water now, debris and other things brushing past his numb ankles. He felt their party pause again before a shove from behind sent him falling into darkness. His face and shoulder collided with a cold, stone wall before he could protect himself. He groaned as he tried to push the blinding pain from his dazed mind. Forcing himself up, he heard a snigger to his right.
After a few hours, he looked at his work. He’d realised about halfway through that he was drawing Harry again, but he pressed on. This image had turned out to be one of his best. It was a memory from their conversation at Hogwarts. Harry was laughing, his grin luminous and infectious even from the page where his pencils had toned and blended, giving this face definition and texture. Somehow he had even managed to pick up the slight darkening around his chin where his stubble had started the grow through.
“Not bad!” Noomi muttered as she stole a glance at Harry.
“Brunch date?” Draco held his head in his hands, willing the pain to go away. His mind wandered slightly, wondering whether there were any pepper-up potions within accio distance. He had been both surprised and relieved to find that they could also aid a hangover. A small vial was placed in his lap as he opened his eyes. He glanced at Blaise, who just grinned in reply.
“You could say that!” Ron chuckled, nodding. “He went all over the place! Quite impressive, actually.”
Some of the women at the office had told him he’d be a silver fox by the time he was forty. He laughed it off. He ran a hand through his salt and pepper hair as he scanned the crowd for Ron or Hermione, suddenly aware of just how lonely he was. There were couples dotted around, talking and flirting, but he was very much alone. He didn’t do well on his own, according to Hermione anyway. He thought he did alright, but she always knew best.
“I don’t know, Ted,”
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, Ted. It was just too hard to admit. If it makes you feel any better, I didn’t tell Ron or Hermione either.”
“It’s Christmas, Uncle, And this place is depressing enough. So we’ll get this place feeling festive, and we can have everyone over for New Year’s Eve like we used to. Maybe we could invite Uncle Draco too?”
“Ron told us about it last night; it sounded awful. The Somnus delorem hex can be quite serious if the counter-curse isn’t cast soon enough.” Granger offered as her large brown eyes wary as she regarded him.
“And so what if he does?”
He looked down at the image of Harry Potter and suddenly felt slightly less panicked about the morning to come. He could do this; Dragons were in his blood. He pushed the sketch of Harry into the middle of the muggle notepad before moving it into his bag, ready for the day ahead. He pulled out his wand and pointed it to the apple again, which he had once again neglected to pick up off the floor.
“It was blown up during the war. It was next door to Eeylop’s Owl Emporium,” Came a voice from the back room. “I’ll be right out, take a seat,”
“I tire of these games Mr Potter. We did not bring you here for information. You’re the entertainment.”
“Ah, Master Potter. Kreacher forgot the time. Is Master wanting dinner?”
Harry wanted to world to swallow him up as all their attention narrowed. He closed his eyes as he sipped his whiskey again.
“So he owl’s Andi a lot, does he?”
He cleared his throat before setting his cup down again.
“What?” Noomi smirked, then giggled as she took another sip. Finally, she shook her head and tried to look serious. “Sorry, my English is not too good!”
“How did you-”
“That won’t be necessary, will it, Mr Malfoy?”
“Hi Luna, I like your dress, it’s… very green” Harry smiled kindly.
“Help yourself, Harry” Noomi smiled as she scooped up some of the herring and placed it on his plate. The smell of sandalwood floated up from the plate, causing his mouth to water. He dug in eagerly after that, wanting to sample everything.
“Good Morning,” Someone called from his right. He spun around to greet the caller.
“Dray? Can you hear us? Are you alright?”
I sent a letter earlier, but my owl is old, and I’m not sure it got through as there was no reply. If you received it, great! Let me know when I can return your jacket, as I don’t want to arrive at the manor unannounced.
“What does my thirty-fifth birthday have to do with anything? It’s not a special birthday.”
A school reunion is a perfect place to put your life into perspective...
“You pulled rank?” Draco smirked, he certainly didn’t believe that for a moment.
“Who hexed the ferret?” George asked before Teddy glared at him. “Sorry, Ted,”
Draco spun out onto the gravel floor, tripping as his thoughts distracting his feet. He caught himself before he could muddy his clothes, biting back his attack, not secure enough to let loose the tsunami of emotions yet. His precariously built mental walls were crumbling at the base as he strode up the drive, head down to keep out the cold. His head spun as the apparition crack continued to ricochet around the manor grounds. How he hadn’t splinched himself was a miracle. He could feel the Scottish snow melting into his hair. He glanced up at the sky as he tried to distract himself. The snow clouds hadn’t travelled this far south yet, leaving the skies clear and stars visible, and the moon bright. Draco shivered before resigning himself to his return to the manor.
“I am sorry. Draco has come here many times, and the dawn is usually up with him.”
“Yes, Patrik needed another pair of the hands.” She replied with a smile. Draco smiled, too; he loved listening to her talk. She smirked, “He came to ask for you, but Harry volunteered.” Draco stopped, spoon halfway to his mouth.
Harry felt sick at the thought.
When Draco sat down quietly and thought about it, he still couldn’t believe that He and Harry had become what they were. They still had their tough days where sometimes the memories got too much, but between them, there were far more good days than bad. He closed his eyes and tried to imagine what they’d be doing right now if they were together. The bottom dropped out of his stomach as the early stirrings of desire curled up inside. He took another deep breath before opening his eyes again. They landed on the pile of presents before him, and he smiled as he started to open them.
Sincerely
“Really? Why didn’t I know that!” He didn’t expect any of them to answer; the question had been to himself. He felt shameful for not knowing, as much as he hadn’t liked the woman, she had saved his life, a debt which he had swiftly repaid by speaking up for her and Malfoy at the trials.
“Thank you. I like your jacket; it’s very green too” Luna smiled with a slight tilt to her head as if considering something. “Who’s is it?”
As he made it to the seventh floor, he found Sir Cadogan’s portrait and the knight fast asleep. He looked around to find the hallway deserted. He cast a disillusionment charm on himself before flicking his wand, causing the tip to spark and popping noises to erupt like a firework. He stopped and stepped back as the portrait bellowed to life.
“He knows where I am,” Malfoy replied, which shocked him.
“Of course you deserve all this. If it helps? I deserve to be happy. Making you happy makes me happy. So, therefore, you are essentially doing a public service.” Harry chuckled before kissing Draco’s face. Draco smiled, not being able to argue with that logic. He moaned with pleasure as he cuddled into Harry’s warmth. He was starving, but he didn’t want to move.
“Just stop.”
“Speaking of evening, have you seen my friend?” Draco asked as he sat down. He saw Noomi flinch at the term ‘friend’ and internally mirrored it. He didn’t know why he always had trouble announcing to the world that Harry was his. ‘Boyfriend’ seemed too immature and wasn’t accurate anymore. ‘Fiance,’ while the most accurate, still felt strange.
“This is our floor. Have a good first day, Malfoy.”
“I can’t believe you bothered the Minister for magic for what? A portkey here?”
Weasley looked at him for a moment before he also turned away. Was that disappointment he saw in the ginger’s pale blue gaze? Was Weasley really expecting him to be better than this too? He remained quiet for a moment before opening his mouth again. If he ever wanted to be friends with Harry, then this was his family. He gripped his hand around the strap of his bag as he swallowed.
“What?” Harry repeated as his mind raced
“I don’t understand.”
Rolf smiled at him and crossed his arms.
“So, how can I help you today?” He asked, breaking the stillness between them.
He shook himself as the clock chimed quarter past before rooting through his things to get ready. He could not be late on his first day.
He rubbed at his hair as he anticipated the reaction from Draco. His eyes would first find his face, then drop to his hips and waist, then to his backside and then up again. There was nothing more thrilling than watching the lust on Draco’s face as it subtly dusted his cheeks in a pale berry blush. He grinned to himself as he opened the door, grabbed his bag and descended the stairs.
“Please, tell me!” Draco begged he hated not knowing.
Draco couldn’t talk, as the pleasure heightened. When Harry took hold of his cock and began to pump it, a burning, blinding white light blew up behind his eyelids, the coiling desire within him snapped and unfurled. He cried out, as his mind and body melted into oblivion. Sluggishly, his numb and boneless limbs returned as his mind focused. His spirit seemed to return to its body, leaving him gasping and shaking. Harry cried out above him before collapsing on top of him, moments later.
To Draco’s surprise, Weasley didn’t even blush. Instead, he chuckled as he vanished the quick quotes quill away.
Harry blinked against the light pouring through the windows. It took him a moment to remember where he was. He smiled as he rubbed his eyes. He reached over to the nightstand and felt around for his glasses. His site was getting worse without them. He grimaced at the thought that maybe, after all this time, he should see a healer and see whether there were any possible treatments. He felt the cool, wire rims and opened them up before pulling them onto his face. The room came into focus, and Harry could appreciate the little hut for what it was. It was small and whitewashed, the wooden panelling going from floor to roof. The window sills were natural wood, creating a feature and turning the stunning scenery outside into a framed painting. There were a few knick-knacks around the shack which Harry knew didn’t belong to Draco, but the picture of them together on his desk and the small box of presents by his rucksack, they were all Draco’s.
“Just ask him. The worst outcome is that he says no, and I think he would appreciate the invite.”
As he walked towards Hogsmeade, Harry looked around, even though he knew he was alone. He guiltily raised the green jacket to his face, and he breathed deeply. He didn’t know what it was about that scent. It smelt so familiar but exotic at the same time. The spicy scent seemed to heat the places that the fire whiskey couldn’t touch. He walked as he puzzled over the evening in his head.
“I have been very blessed.” Draco nodded. As he began to collect up the paper, throwing them into the fire, ready to burn later.
Draco blinked at Rolf and nodded.
“Ordo is very particular about who he hitch-hikes with.” Rolf nodded, a smug smile on his face. Draco nodded as he carefully scooped up the little creature and placed it back onto the over-flowing tree next to him. He noticed a few pairs of eyes watching him as he let the Bowtruckle step off his hand.
“No, thank you. You have been a tremendous help today!” Said Patrik as he moved around the kitchen. Platters and plates started to flow through the air, setting themselves down on the table before them. Harry’s mouth watered as each platter revealed a new and exciting dish.
“I am,” She nodded, “I think I am frustrated with the being housebound. I hate not being able to do things,” She huffed. “I want to meet our little one. I am impatient.”
Harry nodded before taking another sip of his coffee. Ted stood up, pushing his chair back noisily. “Right, see you later, Uncle. I’ll put the postcards scrapbook in the study for you.”
“Wow,” George remarked, “What’s going to happen to the witches?”
He felt angry at the injustice of it all. When he stood up for Malfoy in the trials, he thought that maybe he could right some of the wrongs and allow the blond to start afresh, giving him the ability to make better choices. Merlin knew that options had been few and far between for both of them during their childhood. Harry had just been lucky to have the Weasleys and the Order members to guide and help him. Malfoy hadn’t been so fortunate. This attack just felt like a slap in the face to everything Harry had ever tried to do.
“Not for lack of trying!” Harry snorted “They’re a resilient bunch, remind me of me as a kid.” He chuckled.
“Both accommodating and good looking?” Harry raised an eyebrow “Sounds like he’s exactly your type.” They both smirked as they played along.
Malfoy stood in his charcoal grey suit trousers and shirt, his arm bearing the scarred remains of the dark mark as his hands sat relaxed in his pockets. Harry’s eyes followed the muscle and sinew from his wrists to elbow, noting how it looked like the other man worked for a living. He swallowed and turned away from the blond to glare out at the darkness again.
“What are you up to, Malfoy? What do you want?” Harry managed to choke out as his eyes lingered on the smooth pale collar bone at his throat. He licked his lips slightly before looking down.
“Thanks, Molly. It was delicious, as always,” He offered.
“Amazing, isn’t it?” Said Hermione bitterly, “That he can get a job after everything that has happened.”
There was a long corridor off to the left, which read ‘Containment & Examination’ He glanced down the hallway before weaving his way towards the office. There were only a couple of other people in the room, but their eyes followed him as he walked by. He nodded solemnly to them in the hopes to start on the right foot. When they didn’t reply or acknowledge him, he sighed and continued to the end. He raised his hand to knock on the door when it swung open before his skin could make contact.
The last time he had been within the ministry had been the final day of his trial. He shivered at the thought of that dark and isolated hall where the cold shackles had cut into his wrists. Where only a doorway stood between him and the dementors of prison, he remembered looking up into the gallery within the Wizengamot court where lots of stern and hostile faces glared down at him. Geering and heckling as he tried to make himself as small as possible.
“Of course,” Harry promised, and he would. If Draco was anything to go by, then Pansy could have changed too.
“Mmm, Julskinka,” Noomi smiled with her eyes closed as if reminiscing. “I love Julskinka!” She rubbed her stomach in slow, soothing circles as she opened her eyes again.
Their passion in the bedroom had long since ceased. Harry knew that he no longer loved her, not in a romantic way. Whenever she’s wanted to initiate something, he feigned a headache or knocked the light off; her soft curves and supple skin overwhelmed him as he closed his eyes, pretending she was someone else, someone firmer, thinner, paler.
Harry sipped his barely cold coffee before answering, using the action to buy him time to prepare. He knew he was not going to like this question.  He placed his cup down before he nodded slowly.
“What are you talking about?” He felt thoroughly confused at this turn of events.
“I sense that these commendations were a surprise,” Rolf noted with a raised eyebrow,
“Found him,” Molly announced as she pointed to the prefect’s bathroom on the second floor.
“We won't, Not this year anyway.” Fred grinned. Harry knew better than to ask for more, so he let it slide. He was George’s son, after all. If he had the will, there would be nothing standing in his way.
The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures or the “D.R.C.M.C” was a vast, open-planned office with heavy, dark-wood desks lined in rows. A closed office made of the same darkened wood sat over in the far corner. Blinds covered the windows allowing privacy for the occupant. The far wall had enchanted windows, giving the impression that they weren’t so far below ground. Hat stands and filing cabinets were dotted here and there, finishing the office’s décor.
“My mother used to say that,” He said with a sad smile and Draco swallowed the lump in his throat.
“So? What else do I need to do?”
“Can I ask you a question?” Granger asked
Draco nodded before reading the letter again. It made no sense to him, something about a magic charm and its dissolution upon his thirty-fifth birthday. No mention as to what the charm was for, nor was there any reference to when it was cast or by whom. Draco racked his brains but didn’t know what relevance it had. The letter ended with both his mother and father wishing him a very happy birthday, but most of the bottom had been blotted out by what looked to have been a spilt ink well. He placed the letter onto the desk and turned around to the house-elf who was looking at the snitch intently.
“Yeah, Professor, We’re not up to anything mischievous or anything.” Said Fred, grinning.
“Well?” Asked Hermione, not letting a good mystery go.
“That’s a shame.” Luna nodded, not noticing the glare Ron gave Hermione. “I really like Ginny’s stories. I wonder where Neville and Pansy are?” Luna asked herself as she looked into the crowd.
Peppin hadn’t returned yet, and Harry was struggling to stay up any longer. His mind darted between Malfoy’s letter and Ginny. He could see it now, Ginny and Orion, enjoying their time together, in each other’s arms. He didn’t begrudge her, but he felt envious.
“She couldn’t make it tonight; The Harpies are playing the Moose Jaw Meteorites.”
“Well, as I was saying, you will be the head of this investigation working alongside another member of staff, Ms Cosima Prewitt. Unfortunately, she is on annual leave until after the Christmas period; however, we can really knuckle down when she returns. So, unless you have any other questions, I’ll show you to your desk and introduce you to the team?” Rolf smiled as he slid his legs off the desk and stood up.
‘What can I get for you, sir? Oh! Harry!’
The barista leaned over the counter at him and winked, ‘You make a cute couple, y’know.’
‘Sing, papa,
Harry shook his head in disbelief. He’d been trying to help, but if Malfoy was just going to throw it back in his face like that then what was the point.
‘How many dirty things do you reckon they all think I’ve whispered to you already, then?’ Harry forced himself not to jump at the sensation of Draco’s breath on his ear lobe.

‘In your life. And you come in here, ranting at
Whatever he was saying seemed to have an effect on Malfoy to say the least. He was suddenly very tense and uneasy, no longer looking Harry in the eye, squirming around in his seat. The confident, puffed-up prick was gone, and in his place was a very timid, insecure man; Draco Malfoy was unrecognisable in seconds. In fact, it was only the platinum hair that convinced Harry that this wasn’t someone else using Polyjuice potion that had that instance worn off.
‘No.’ The word came out slightly hoarse, as if Draco was all of a sudden finding it difficult to breath, but Harry ignored it, figuring that Draco was just being his usual dramatic self.
this has been a very slow update and for that I am very sorry! please accept this extra long chapter as repayment for taking so long, I was away and then it was my birthday and now its been weeks <3
When Harry was only three months away from being eighteen, he repaid the life debt.
it when I’m a git to you.’ Ma-Draco smirked at him, his voice all low and sultry. Harry rolled his eyes in response, angling his head down so that the heat on his face wouldn’t be visible.
‘Aww, well I’m flattered you’ve finally admitted it,
‘This is you trying
‘In your life. And you come in here, ranting at
Draco wished Potter wouldn’t keep ignoring his request for the counter for that stinging jinx, it was the one piece of charm work he’d never been able to quite manage at Hogwarts.
, mate, why do you look like you’ve just got laid?’ George is grinning back at him, like he’s been let in on a huge secret.
In that very moment, Harry Potter’s worst enemy was every single thing between him and Draco.
as your parolee!’ Ron was still laughing, almost crying with how hilarious he obviously found Harry’s unfortunate situation. Hermione, however, wasn’t laughing. Harry thought that she almost looked guilty at the news of his being assigned his arch-nemesis.
‘What are you talking about?’ Harry frowned at him,
It’d been four years since Draco had last seen him. Four years since he’d allowed himself to think of that mop of black hair and those particularly piercing green eyes, the tall, lean frame of his body and the sharp cut of his jaw.
‘Nothing to get excited about?’ Ron was in disbelief. He turned to George, ‘Nothing to get excited about he says! Like he’s not had a date in over a year and a half, like we’ve not been trying to set him up with every witch, wizard, and muggle we can!’
‘Quite sure mum, he told me himself. Sat me down in his office and broke the news in his usual brutish way.’
‘Of course. Take your time.’ Harry turned to the barista in front of him with a smile. ‘Two large hot chocolates please.’
‘What?’ Harry snapped out of his train of thought at the
‘It’s fine, Draco, honestly. I couldn’t decide which shirt to wear anyway,’ Harry gave a small, self-deprecating laugh. Draco joined in, but it sounded much more genuine than Harry’s ego could take at that moment.
Running his hand through his hair and down towards the back of his neck, Harry’s grin only gets wider at them.
I took christmas/new years 'off' and spent it with my family in lockdown so this one took me a little longer than usual, but I'm back now & hopefully gonna get back into the swing of solidifying plots and actually writing this fic lol
Harry felt a warm body sit down beside him, pressed up against his side from shoulder to ankle. It was comforting and familiar and so very
‘Maybe it’s time for me to come out, then, Draco, dearest.’
He pulled away, reluctantly, mind, from the best lips he had ever had the privilege of kissing.
in a while.
‘I don’t want to lose you, either. I think I’m going to go to my room now, if you can help me into bed.’ Draco’s voice was very quiet now. So quiet it was almost scary.
Andromeda Tonks smiled fondly at Harry, as a grandmother would smile at her grandchildren, or a certain stern Scottish professor would smile at her unruly, rulebreaking house members. When he looked up, Harry broke into the widest smile he’d managed in two weeks.
oh sweet
Azkaban.
being… being- that he hadn’t noticed himself slumping inwards, losing the confidence that he tried so hard to portray at all times, lest someone look too closely and see how broken he still was.
The night went on. The conversation flowed on and Harry nursed his butterbeers and his fire whiskeys, trying to concentrate on the names and details of people in the stories that Dean and Seamus spun around and around in circles around his head. He had a vague awareness of Ron, sat awkwardly, reminding Harry of how he’d looked every time Oliver Wood had tried to give a pep talk before a quidditch game. He turned to give him his attention, certain that he could see something bubbling away just below the surface, something that needed the slightest
And then… she started laughing.
‘Well, I have an obligation on Saturday evenings - a family thing - if that’s the only day you can do we can work around it.’
The whole sight made Harry feel very giggly, which only rewarded him with a fond eye-roll from Draco when he told him so. Draco had been doing a lot of that recently, looking at him fondly. He had done for years, when Harry thought about it properly, but Harry’d only begun to notice recently, and there was no way he could think about it properly after whatever was in the shots that Seamus had forced on him.
‘But Potter, you and I both know that you
Hermione nodded, hand still cradling her stomach.
‘World, bet you just love all this attention don’t you Potter?’
‘Alright,’ he stood up, ‘same again? Who wants another?’

. The bloody poster boy for reformed Death Eaters.
He absolutely definitely did
Eyes that now seemed doomed to pop up and follow him around for the rest of his life, no matter where he went.
‘Right,’ Draco’s voice boomed in the silence and Potter jumped a mile, ‘you’re all done with the ink. Shall I get started on the movement charm?’
‘Oh please, Ron. a missing eyebrow isn’t enough to scare a customer away.’
Draco had spent the entire weekend panicking.
Potter… blushed? At the mention of the tattoo parlour?
‘You didn’t have to bring my home yourself, y’know. I’m sure Robards is pissed that you didn’t hang around the scene.’
‘Whatever, Potter. I appreciate the help you’re offering for my name change but I’m not discussing the trials, or Azkaban with you, so just leave it.’ And with that, Malfoy made his way over to Teddy and set about playing with him most enthusiastically, determinately ignoring every attempt Harry made at getting his attention.
Hermione gave a disbelieving shriek at Harry’s stupidity, and threw her hands up in the air before banging her head against the table, nearly knocking over their drinks. Ron, however, looked deeper in thought than Harry thought he’d ever seen him.
Malfoy fixed him with a look again, obviously enjoying the flustered state of his
‘Alright, love. Let’s get you off home to bed.’ Ron smiled at his wife, a smile so soft and fond and private that Harry almost felt like he was intruding, and had to look away for a second.
, polluted with strands of gold.
‘What do you mean you couldn’t decide? You’ve got a t-shirt for every day of the year don’t you?’
Harry cleared his throat and sang along with his godson.
‘Yes I know where it is.’
‘Black. Right. I was popular, alright, it was just with a megalomaniac who’d had it out for me since before I was born.’
Harry cleared his throat behind them and Draco looked over his shoulder at him, mouth still open in a wide smile that hadn’t been for Harry. ‘I’ve just remembered I had to meet Ron for a… thing. So. Um, see you I guess. Nice to meet you, Liam.’
Sam tensed up again, eyes widened, and knuckles decidedly a little whiter around the handle of his drink. Harry cleared his throat, he was suddenly much
wasn’t some massive flirt making his way through the entirety of wizarding Britain. The very suggestion of it made Draco’s blood boil; if he had had claws, they’d be out.
‘Whats tomorrow?’ Ron looked confused.
Before opening the door to his office, Harry hesitated. The

As soon as he had glimpsed Patch talking to Potter across the room, he knew that nothing good could come from it. And then Patch had gone and accused him of

‘Alright… it was those arseholes McLaggan and Thorpe down the hall. I don’t suppose you know the counter jinx, do you? Only I’d quite like to sit down.’

‘Potter, for the love of Merlin, why are you telling me?’ Draco finally managed to get a word in edgeways to Potter’s babbling. Maybe they’d both been drinking Babbling Beverage?
part two here we go! this was the scene that gave me the initial idea so I'm v happy to finally reach it, but don't worry, I have so many more plans for these boys.... enjoy!
It was Draco’s turn to have his eyes widened into dinner plates again, showing Harry plenty of iris to notice them darken considerably, and Harry knew his own eyes must have done the same.
‘Oh like you’re one to talk, Malfoy-’
Potter regarded him with a careful stare before nodding. ‘You’re not a death eater anymore, and you never were in my eyes, Draco. And you’re the furthest thing from scum I’ve ever seen. Far too poncey.’ He laughed, and Draco managed to turn up a corner of his mouth. They were kind words, but Draco didn’t appreciate Potter lying like that, especially for someone like him.
No way. There was no sodding
‘The lifts were slow.’
Potter gasped as the bright white tendrils of Draco’s magic snaked their way around his wrist, stroking their way along the edges of the stag before thrusting themselves into the very ink, which seemed to throb and pulse with the new energy from within it. The stag began by stomping its front hooves and shaking out its antlers, before taking a few tentative steps along Potter’s wrist bone, the movements making Potter hiss at the new sensations. Draco was no virgin when it came to tattoos, and he had a few magical ones himself; he had to admit, you never quite forgot the tingling thrill of a magical tattoo moving for the first time.
Voldemort had been dead and dust for seven years, Uncle Vernon was nothing more than the occasional bad dream, and even the bloodhounds at the
‘Yeah, and you don’t deserve that. So let's go have that drink, I’m feeling like hot chocolate.’
The dirt coffee was left cold, and forgotten, on his desk.

‘You’re late, you know,’ Harry said, still focused on his paperwork.
Malfoy gave a bitter laugh. ‘Sure, Potter. Instead of leaving half an hour early, I’ll make it a full hour. How’s that for you? Would that work?’
Harry just looked at her over the lip of his mug. ‘Is he blond, fairly short, blue eyes?’
‘Bloody blood purist, never lifted a finger-’
Harry was shaking with nerves; he’d finally worked up the courage to ask Draco out after what felt like a lifetime of pining, much to the relief of Ron and Hermione (who were, by far, the only people he’d felt it safe enough to confide in).
He cleared his throat. ‘So, what’s with the stag?’
Malfoy cast one more look over Harry’s face, before strengthening the numbing charms around his wrist. Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever feel his wrist again at this point. When the gun started up once more, Malfoy looked up again to check Harry’s pain level. Seeming satisfied with Harry’s lack of response, he continued with the drawing.
Luckily, having known him and his temper so long, Hermione seemed to realise this and changed tack. ‘Alright, alright. I just think you need to be careful now. You don’t know what happened to him,’ she lowered her voice to a whisper, ‘
Potter, however, was not amused. ‘Come on, Teddy. It’s late and Grandma Andi will be mad at both of us if I let you stay up any longer.’
‘You know I’m not going to quit Ron, being an Auror is basically hardwired into my brain and you know it.’ Ron snorted at this, but Harry carried on. ‘If anyone’s got a right to be pissed, mate, it’s me! You abandoned me! What happened to becoming Aurors together?’
Wincing slightly at the sudden cold fingers at his wrist, Harry drew in a sharp breath and tore his attention back to where the blond head, previously bowed in deep concentration, had snapped up at the sound of Harry’s pain.
Draco and Potter had been walking aimlessly around Hyde Park in silence for forty-five minutes now, and Draco was beginning to think that they were a little lost. Despite Potter’s grunting assurances that he knew exactly where he was.
‘Oh, you know me, just in the neighbourhood and I thought I’d drop in on my favourite Diagon establishment.’
Draco hadn’t heard a single word, he was too focused on the way Potter’s lips moved around every word they spoke and the way his throat looked as he swallowed down more and more whiskey.
‘People change, Ron, and I think he deserves as much of a second chance as anyone else!’
‘Dray -
‘Alright, we can watch it. But you don’t tell Grandma Andi and neither will I, okay?’ Edward nodded, thrilled to get his way. ‘And you go to bed as
him like Draco, these days, not even Ron and Hermione.
, it was almost dizzying and Harry almost spat out the sip of punch he’d just taken.
Making his way back into the room, he could see Potter still fixed onto his wrist. As Draco took it back into his own hands, he heard Potter’s sharp intake of breath and felt rather than saw his eyes snap up to lock onto the top of Draco’s head.
Harry allowed Ron’s voice to fade into the background, nodding and making the appropriate noises when he paused in tales of how the past few months of his eighth year at Hogwarts was going. Harry needed this, he needed some semblance of normality, the mindless gossip of eighth-year Hogwarts. The daydream of a Hogwarts that never had to bear witness to the horrors of the Battle, of his own childhood and time at Hogwarts not being tainted by the relentless threat of Voldemort and his dumb Death Eaters year after year. Missing Hogwarts was perhaps even the worst of it, the thought of all of his friends having gone back to school for their final (and probably most

Harry Potter is the only one in that whole Ministry who would have it in him to give you a fair chance at parole and a life beyond that mark on your forearm! He will see more in you than just an ex-Death Eater, he always has! Oh! Dragon this is your chance!’
‘I don’t think I could forget either, it was very special to me.’
worse!’
Harry thought about how nice it had been the last few months, taking Draco lunch from his favourite places and seeing him smile as he surprised him at work. Seeing Draco in a good mood on the days Harry sent him flowers, and the deep satisfaction that Harry was the one that caused it. Being spoilt by Draco in return, with boxes of his favourite sweets and chocolate getting delivered to his office. The way that Draco just
- minutes to go before he was officially late and claimed to feel ill they’d see right through him.
‘Oh like you’re one to talk, D-Malfoy-’
‘You’re not in any pain are you? I’m not hurting you?’ There was definitely something behind Potter’s eyes, but Draco couldn’t quite tell what. The last thing he needed was a complaint from Wonder Boy that he’d been neglecting his pain-numbing charms. Eddie would put him right the way back down the list of artists, that is, if he didn’t fire him straight away.
Although, Draco supposed,
Summoning up one last bout of Gryffindor courage, Harry closed the distance between them. It took all of his concentration not to fall straight to the floor as his lips touched Draco’s. Knees immediately weak, Harry’s hands came up to hold onto Draco’s arms. All he could focus on was how
Potter grimaced at that.
‘Oi, Malfoy! Get your arse on the front while I go have my fag break.’
‘You want me to… what, invite him?’
‘Yeah,’ Draco breathed at him, leaning heavily into Harry’s side. Only, Draco winced as Harry helped him lay down on the sofa, his hand moving to press against his side.
‘I already
‘Good. I hope he’s upset.’
But Draco was already storming to the fireplace, ignoring all attempts to get his attention. He took a large handful of floo powder, shouted “
‘Hi Harry… are you alright?’
But Draco would know if Harry, one of his best friends since they’d met when they were eleven, fancied anyone, let alone him. Right?
‘Hey, look. I’m actually on official leave next week so-’

Draco scowled at him. ‘I thought you were supposed to be busy this weekend, anyway.’
, the irony that he was protecting Malfoy was not lost on him - Harry marched him to the Atrium, out of the ministry, and down a couple of streets before coming to a stop at his favourite fish and chip shop. This was always a favourite place to come back in the early days of the auror academy; all the recruits would come here every Friday, after a week of hard training sessions, and pig out on fish, chips, mushy peas, battered sausages, the whole works, all while bitching about whatever Robards or their training instructors had said.
It was Sunday afternoon. A whole thirty five hours and… twenty three minutes since Harry had asked Sam out on a date, thirty five hours and twenty minutes since a knot had appeared in his stomach, and Harry couldn’t quite figure out what it meant.
. He’d had enough of that from Patch and his mother, he didn’t need it from Harry fucking Potter, too.
‘If I’m not mistaken, it was a night not unlike this… Ginny had played her first game, everyone was getting drunk, you and I snuck off for some fresh air…’
‘Look mate, it’s getting late anyway and I’ve obviously had more than enough. I’ll probably see you for lunch at the Burrow on Sunday or some other time, but I need to go. I’ve got a load of shit to sort out before I get back to training on Monday morning. Damn weekend breaks are never long enough.’
, Potter. Are you really going to go the whole nineteen yards with this small talk?’
.’ He said the word with such disdain, Harry almost flinched.
The smirk wiped itself from Malfoy’s face at the mention of Azkaban. Clearly the six months Malfoy had been out had done little to help him to forget his time spent there, despite the fact that he no longer looked half starved.
It had been two weeks since Draco had given Potter - yes, still Potter, despite the flirting, he hadn’t earned that privilege
‘Merlin, no. It makes me feel physically sick when you do.’
Draco wasn’t stupid, he knew he would have to see Potter eventually for their weekly parole meetings, he’d just hoped he would have a few extra days to save face before being forced into that meeting rather than a mere thirty six hours. And with two months left of his six month parole period before he would be properly free, he had at least eight meetings still to go before he never had to see Harry sodding Potter ever again.
‘No, I suppose not.’ Harry opened his eyes and smiled over at Charlie.
The two boys sat in a comfortable silence for a few moments, taking the first few hot sips of their drinks. Their eyes met over their cups and Draco grinned at him. ‘I saw that barista wink at you,’
‘Black Lotus Tattoos? It’s on Diagon Alley, been there a while I think, took over from Fortescue's after the war.’
Luke, but until now he’d had no urgent desire to act on it. He liked coming in for coffee and a pecan plait on his way into work in the mornings, and he liked that it always seemed to be Sam serving him, and he liked the way that his hair flopped over in front of his eyes; he always felt the urge to brush it back and tuck it behind an ear. Clearly some force in the universe was pushing him to go on his first date in months, and it would just be rude of Harry to not divulge the universe.
,’ which hadn’t helped
‘It was. But Edward wanted to watch a film with us both on the teevee and neither of us had the heart to deny him, so we watched Aladdin - horrible muggle rubbish, horrible plot, horrible characters, horrible songs, you’d have hated it, mum - and he fell asleep but it was really nice just spending time together and getting to know Edward and not feeling like I had to impress anyone or uphold any standards or defend myself against the Malfoy name or-’
It was so entirely unexpected, and yet it fit the house, and Potter, perfectly.
‘And that’s another thing,’ Ron continued on his rant, ‘why the bloody hell are you calling him
All he could hear was Potter’s breathing getting heavier, all he could smell was the fire whiskey on Potter’s breath, all he could see was Potter’s lips parting slightly as they got closer.
By the end of her little speech, Narcissa was almost singing with joy at what Draco had told her, obviously there had been some accidental potion or narcotic in her tea? Why else would she be acting so barmy? Draco was bewildered.
remember from training, Harry maintained his eye contact, refusing to be the one to give in after all this time.
Malfoy seemed somewhat dazed and mildly confused as he spun a full one-eighty on his heels and half-followed/was half-dragged by Harry down the corridor.
- for everything Draco Malfoy might want to give him, and Harry couldn’t bring himself to acknowledge the million and one rational reasons why he shouldn’t give in to that anymore.
‘Please,’ Harry’s smile grew wider.
‘We’re not just friends, Potter, and you fucking know it!’
‘Maybe because you can’t look me in the eye properly without grimacing? You bloody well know that you can’t lie to me Harry Potter.’
All too soon - or not soon enough - the film was over and Teddy had fallen asleep on the sofa between them.
sorry.

She squealed, all worry melting from her face, which confused Harry to no end. ‘And?!’

Of course, it didn’t take long until Harry could feel Draco’s breathing get slower, and hear tiny little snores coming up from him. The beautiful blond git had fallen asleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘You only pull the pig tails of the one you love,’ Hermione’s voice was muffled as she refused to lift her head, but she couldn’t resist correcting the idiom for her husband.
Gauntlet accepted.
‘Erm, well, I did, mate. It’s Malfoy. Robards gave me Malfoy.’
It was all Harry could do to call out pathetically after him, calls of ‘
, first and foremost, and if ever there was a rule Harry wouldn’t break, that was it. Highly unprofessional. And if he wanted to make Head Auror by the time he was thirty five like Robards and Kingsley and the whole of wizarding Britain expected him to, he needed to keep his head down, his nose clean, and nowhere near the temptations of Draco Malfoy.
Harry grinned at him. ‘Did you ever ask it to rain misery down on me?’
‘Now. Do you want to tell me what’s on your mind? Or are we going to just sit here in silence this week?’ Andi’s smile was kind, but there was a glint of knowing in her eyes that Harry didn’t like one bit.
‘Alright, alright,’ Harry raises his hands in submission, cheeks flaming, ‘But I did nothing that wasn’t encouraged thank you very much!’ But Harry was properly laughing with them both now. Yes, his love life had been a complete joke (and by that: non-existent) for the past three years. Yes, he hadn’t had a girlfriend - or boyfriend - since Ginny -
‘Ye-’
‘Erm, yeah. That might be best. See you next week, Malfoy.’
So really it was just Teddy and Andi keeping him going really, with their weekly Wednesday coffee meet ups. That and the weekly parole meetings he was having with Mal-
‘That’s what the toys are for, silly! What sort of grandmother do you take me for? I came prepared!’
‘You’re a sodding hypocrite. I can’t believe I saved your-’
And the more they drank, the closer they got; fire whiskey removing all forms of inhibitions and social barriers. Potter was flailing his arms around telling some story about Edward changing his hair colour in the middle of Potter doing a food shop, and the subsequent emergency obliviating he’s had to do.
‘Not bad, Potter. Since when did you have good taste?’
‘Apologised for anything either, you-’
‘I thought you weren’t talking to your sister, something about… being disowned from the family?’
‘No, papa, no! One jump, one jump!’ Edward looked up at Potter with some of the most well-practised puppy-dog eyes Draco had ever seen, it was truly commendable and Draco resolved to plying him with sweets to help him improve his manipulation tactics so they’d be in peak condition by the time he started Hogwarts.
‘What the bloody hell was that?’
‘Don’t make me repeat myself, Harry, dear. It was just before Draco was released from Azkaban, and I suppose Cissa was feeling nostalgic about family. We’ve been exchanging owls for just over four months now.’
Draco and Harry, who had both just taken sips of their drinks to avoid looking at each other, simultaneously began to choke on them. Patch let out a bark of laughter as he walked away from them.
‘Err, I mean, well I have.. Training you know? Not that I’m not - er - capable, this is weird, what was the question?’
Draco looked unbelievably pleased at that. It was an expression that never failed to make Harry feel proud at having participated in producing it. He looped an arm around Draco’s shoulders; they had an audience after all.
The lower neckline of his t-shirt also meant that Malfoy’s prisoner identification number was on full view, but Harry tried very hard to look absolutely everywhere else instead. Neither of them needed (or wanted) to be reminded of that.
‘Course, mate. Anything you need.’
‘You request them!’
Potter sat back down on the sofa, much closer than he had been when they’d been watching the film with Edward between them. In fact, if he got any closer their legs would be touching.
It didn’t matter. Every minute he was late was another minute that Harry didn’t have to drag out the stupid questions he had to ask every time. The answers never changed. It was the most pointless hour of his week, and that said a lot when most of his week was full of other such pointless paperwork. Honestly, if this was being an auror then the DMLE sold the biggest con ever with their “dark wizard catchers” and raids and busting up potion smuggling dens. A lifetime of pointless paperwork was enough to make Harry want to jump off a broom mid-flight.
Was the Chosen One really trying to suggest something here?
‘But what about… that drink...?’ But he was gone, and there was no hope that he would’ve heard Harry over the noise of the bar; Draco Malfoy was lost to the crowd of dancing students.
‘But sir-’
‘Hey, so. That film you told me about ages ago is out in cinemas now.’
“IT couple” indeed. It was like they were characters in one of Draco’s muggle romance novels.
, that’s all, we’re going for dinner.’ Harry laughed and sighed and smiled and ran his hands through his hair again.
Harry was sure he must be irritating everyone around him by bouncing his leg so much, but he just couldn’t help it. Draco was the man of his dreams, his soulmate, the love of his life, and Harry was allowed to be nervous before their first date, goddamnit! Checking his watch, Harry cursed his nerves making him turn up almost twenty minutes early, but it had allowed him to get a drink in before Draco arrived, and calm his nerves, even if just a little.

Patch had arrived a few minutes ago, but it had done little to sooth his nerves; Draco was still flooded with the feelings of nausea and terror that threatened to take over, that only increased in intensity as the clock ticked closer and closer to the arrival of his guests. And
enough marks from ol’ Voldy thank you very much, Harry felt like his body was covered in the scars of his war against him. It was high time he marked himself for a change.
Hermione said nothing, just nodded approvingly. A picture of calm in the midst of Harry’s world flipping on its head.
at last week’s meeting, I’m gonna have to ask you to stop. And possibly never mention them again. Yep. most definitely. Please do not mention them again.’
installment number four of this lil thing
Patch let out a bark of laughter at that. ‘You and I also know that she’s threatened to have your bollocks if you don’t attend your own party.’
Death Eaters, let alone a brand new group that seemed even more unhinged than the last lot.
‘Harry!’ Hermione scolded him How can you have let this happen! You had a level of responsibility as Draco’s parole officer to make sure he feels safe in your office and you don’t abuse that trust.’
you’re out! I don’t care that you could keep this pub afloat with your business alone,
know how magical tattoos worked. He probably could’ve put a bit more research into them in the months he’d had before he committed but when had he ever done anything other than jump in head first?
‘What?’
Harry? Childhood rival of Draco?’
Draco Malfoy, Harry decided, was quite possibly the worst person he could have been assigned for this parole bullshit. Kingsley and Hermione be damned.
‘Why aren’t you drinking, Mione?’
It was only as the door had closed behind him that Draco noticed Potter had handed him a nice round thirty galleons instead of the twenty-seven he owed. Unsure what to do with the extra three galleons, Eddie seemed to take pity on him.
Why the hell was Harry so spectacularly shit at dealing with emotions? For as much as Mione had said Ron was the one with the emotional range of a teaspoon, Harry knew that he was much,
The pair of them last a total of thirty more seconds before erupting into peels of laughter. Potter swoops down and scoops up Edward into his arms, tickling him as he does so and making him laugh all the more.

. He wasn’t sure exactly what had spurned him on to ask Sam out right now. Sure, he’d known for a couple of weeks now that Sam had been harbouring a minor crush on him, having been told by the
Not trusting himself to speak, he’d been teased once too many times about his ineloquence by Draco to risk it, Harry took one step, two steps, three, until he was right in front of Draco. Sharing the same breath, eyes almost at the same height, green on grey.
This was nonsense - why was he so nervous? It wasn’t like Malfoy would be there, he’d checked his work schedule the day before, and Merlin knew he was hellbent on these tattoos, he’d had the designs picked out for about two years now. But it had still taken him just as long to book the appointment, and then months again to convince himself to stop postponing it. Whatever it was, fate had decided that today was the day that Harry Potter would
‘Harry! You cannot possibly think you can stay objective as his parole officer now!’
It was also two weeks since he’d got his little Prongslet, his little stag tattoo on his wrist, which had taken to cantering up and down his arm at all hours of the day. Harry couldn’t even get annoyed at his constant awareness of it moving around thanks to the tickling sensation that occurred whenever it moved, as it obviously meant that the stag was happy making a nuisance of itself on his arm.
And with that, to the protests of ‘Sam?!’ and ‘Harry, wait!’ and ‘You’d better be over first thing Thursday morning’ and ‘don’t do anything I wouldn’t do young man!’, Harry ran from the shop laughing, and made his way back down Diagon Alley towards the apparition point.
‘Hang on, what makes you so sure I’m in love with him? I’ve never given you reason to believe that

Draco thought he might spontaneously combust.

And he’d been invited to his party on sunday.
- since the end of fifth year and his father’s imprisonment in Azkaban. His life and his choices hadn’t been stellar up until that point, by no means, but that summer before sixth year and ever since was, collectively, the worst time of his life. It was only now, sitting here needling a tiny stag into the wrist of Potter, that he felt his life finally start to be looking up.
They raced to the Apparition point, along with a few other partners of Aurors, and twisted away to Diagon. The scene that greeted them upon arrival appeared to be one of pure pandemonium at first glance, but Harry saw that it was just several frantic shoppers all talking to their own Auror pair in the immediate vicinity.
, it was going to be a long night if he kept this up.
M- Draco’s eyes widened ever so slightly at that, before snapping over to Patch and fixing him with a glare. ‘I told you that little pet name in private, P.’
Harry opened his eyes and caught a glimpse of fiery ginger before his other best friend joined the death grip Harry was currently victim to.

Harry had walked away from his tattoo appointment in a bit of a daze; healing cream in one hand, the other wrapped up tightly in what felt like muggle cling film, and a dumbstruck smile on his face.
Anyone who actually knew Harry Potter knew that he was nothing like how the press presented him; he didn’t want the fame, despite the taunts that Draco had favoured at Hogwarts, and he
It had been twenty-two hours and thirty four minutes since Harry had begun to regret the majority of his life choices and stew about what had happened and what that could mean for his future.
With his wrist wrapped up, Draco pressed the healing cream into Potter’s hand. ‘You’ll need to wash it with gentle soap and apply that twice a day for about two weeks, and make sure you
‘Actually, Harry, there’s something we wanted to ask you.’ Hermione put down her lemonade and looked from a nodding Ron to a confused Harry. ‘We wanted to ask you if you’d be our baby’s godfather.'
‘Whatever. Do you want me to bring over some chicken soup or something?’
‘If I could possibly get a word in, Potter? How can I respond when you seem to talk a mile a minute?’
Liam had just fixed Draco with a knowing look and said ‘Sure, Drake, sure.’
Harry wasn’t surprised at the answer, but Draco’s reaction to it could have provided some sort of evidence in some case against a new group of Neo-Death Eaters that the main aurors were trying to build. Not that anyone would tell him any more details than that, apparently destroying a Dark Lord means fuck all to people who’ve been doing it for a living for longer than he’d been alive. But still, anyone who knew anything about Draco Malfoy knew that he’d wanted nothing to do with the
‘You want me to invite Potter. To the party. The party you’re throwing for my birthday.’
‘It’s a mystery, Potter. Maybe you should ask your colleagues? See if they know?’
‘Absolutely everything! Every time someone says that in one of those muggle pictures you force me to watch-’
‘Nope. No no no no. I’m gonna stop you right there. If this has anything to do with the, er,

wait, what? Draco shook his head and looked back down at the address that Potter had written down.
Harry even made it past the parents lyric without wanting to cry his eyes out in front of Malfoy! Hey, he’ll take the wins where he can get them.

Today was the big day. The day he’d waited for for months, ever since he’d made the appointment. Today was the day he got a tiny stag on the inside of his wrist - his left one - to remind him of his parents and everything they stood for. It was part one of his master plan to get all three animals, his own personal zoo: a stag, a dog, and a wolf, all dancing around his left forearm. He’d get the lily flowers later, but for now it was all about the zoo.
And they
after seeing his parole officer, and definitely did not cry in his room until Patch came to find him.
‘Don’t you think you’d know if I had? No.’
Malfoy, however, returned it with just a scathing look, before turning back round to Harry. ‘Eddie’s right. I apologise…

Potter eyed him carefully, his own eyes narrowed in an expression Draco knew only too well; one that implied he thought Draco might be
Harry knew that Draco found it hard. In the seven years since the end of the war and the beginning of their friendship, Harry had learnt how to read past every layer of the pureblood mask that Draco put up. Publicly, Draco was back where he started; muttered comments as he walked down the street, and general suspicion that he was up to something Dark with the Saviour.
He sighed again, and stood to wash up his tea cup in the sink. He didn’t see P nearly as often as he’d like, not anymore, but their weekly phone conversations were just enough to get him through one visit to the next. He dried the tea cup and placed it back into the cupboard.
Apparently this seemed to soothe Sam a little, as he visibly relaxed into his seat and took another sip of his drink. Deciding he looked entirely too comfortable like that, Harry thought it was high time he summoned up some of that famous Gryffindor bravery.
Potter had tipped him. No matter how small, it was surely a sign that hell was currently freezing over. Draco looked back up to the retreating figure in the window.
‘Don’t freak out! I just want to know… if it was a date I’ve got a very important question.’
Harry gave a smile that he hoped wasn’t too strangled.
She had flown in her first game just after Halloween of the same year, and had been on the starting team for the three years since. Harry had yet to miss a game.

Usually, his boss would be shouting from the rooftops of Diagon at Boy Wonder coming into the parlour for an appointment, so how come Draco hadn’t heard about it before now?

Harry started fidgeting. He couldn’t help it. Draco wasn’t looking his way anyway (not that Harry knew, because he was resolutely
‘You would? Why, Potter?’ Malfoy looked confused, Harry couldn’t exactly blame him.

‘... but I’m really sorry, Harry. I was really looking forward to getting a drink,’ Draco was still talking to him, and Harry couldn’t deny that he did sound ill,
Harry sobered at this slightly, sighing. Resigned. He knew this was the reason for Ron’s overgenerous gesture of buying their many rounds of drinks, that he’d been waiting for Harry to lower his defences before broaching this topic again. He felt betrayed, slightly, at the fact that Hermione had given such strict instructions to Ron, yet hadn’t felt the need to ask him herself. The pair of them hadn’t exactly been subtle in their disappointment that he had insisted upon going straight into a Ministry job rather than back to Hogwarts to finish his education, like they had both done after the rebuilding of it in the summer.  If anything, he’d have thought that going out and beginning the career that the whole wizarding world expected of him would have them
No one else could make his cup of tea just right, or knew when to make him coffee instead. No one else would share a Hawaiian pizza with him. No one else could make him cry with laughter at just a look. No one else knew to cheer him up with Drew Barrymore films and takeaway Chinese food after a bad case. No one knew he still took potions to help him sleep after nightmares, sometimes. Potions that Draco brewed himself. No one else made Harry feel so safe and looked after and-
He walked the mugs back over to the sofa where Draco was sitting, and got only a small ‘Thanks,’ as he handed over the perfect tea, before sitting down in the chair opposite. They sat drinking their tea in silence; Draco wincing every time his side moved too quickly, and Harry watching on in silent desperation to help. A whole six minutes passed before Draco spoke again. ‘You know, one day you’re going to get me killed… remind me why we’re friends again?’
‘Skinny arse in the room of Requirement, could’ve saved myself-’
And Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen anything so
‘Of course not, spending time with young cousin Edward is always a joyous occasion.’ Leaning down to pick up his sweet baby cousin, Draco deftly chose not to disclose that he happened to know
She actually had the gall to
Ron whirls back around to look at Harry again, cross examining every single micro-feature, every twitch in his gestures, and whatever he seems to find in Harry’s face satisfies him somewhat.
‘I’m leaving now, mum!’ He called out.
‘Oh come off it, how many times are you gonna insist on this fight Ron? You and Mione both know this job is the only thing that’s made me want to get out of bed in the morning! - and don’t try and argue with me anymore!’ Ron had gone to protest but promptly shut his mouth again, ‘I love you both, but you’re just wrong this time alright? I need to do this, I need to be useful. There’s still so much shit to change back from when Voldemort tried to take over, and what kind of “saviour” would I be if I didn’t at least try to help and round up some more death eaters whilst I’m at it, heh? Being an Auror is the only way I can do that.’
‘Don’t wait till you drop me home, to kiss me goodnight.’
Harry thought to himself. Although, he knew full well that it was not the
‘Do your
Hell, the most action he had got in the past year and a half was a horrific excuse for a “relationship” with Sam from the coffee shop (which had resulted in Harry having to find a new favourite coffee shop) and that kiss from Malfoy last night (which had resulted in a lot of confusion, frustration, nausea, and Malfoy running out of his flat).
‘Oh, well. About that. It seems I’m ill.’
‘Hi Janice, bye Janice.’ Harry marched past the witch and threw Robards’ office door open. He’d had to wait
, and
Draco turned back to look at Patch and found him smirking. A signature Malfoy smirk that he had obviously copied from Draco. He scowled.
Of course, Harry’s new worst enemy couldn’t see it that way. All they could see was the Dark Mark on Malfoy’s arm, and the history of blood purism behind his name. All Harry could see was a child soldier that had been bullied into joining the wrong side, and another eighteen year old who’d had little more of a childhood than he’d had.
‘Have you visited anyone at the prison of Azkaban?’
Harry was dreading their meeting on Friday, already knowing how awkward and stilted it would be between them after Draco had kissed him last week. His head had been swimming with thoughts about how Draco would behave, how he would talk to him, after Harry had rejected him and his kiss in all but the physical words.
stopped Harry in his tracks. ‘Lemonade?’
It did seem, however, that Potter could tell just how awful this extended silence between them was. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco could see Potter fidgeting in his chair, running his hands through that bird's nest he called hair, and his eyes darting between Draco and absolutely anything else.
Andromeda made to stand and fix Teddy up into a form that would vaguely allow for leaving the establishment at some point in the next half an hour, leaving Harry to sit and stew in his own thoughts for a few minutes more.
Signing, Harry resigned himself to having to spend the entire evening dodging questions about “how his parole appointment to Malfoy was going” (awful, thanks for asking, he kissed me and I might fancy him) and “are you still seeing that Sam guy” (haven’t been for a while because he’s an arse but you never asked). Although he knew Mione would almost certainly figure something out before the end of the night, it was bound to happen.
‘Harry…’ Ron began cautiously, before he was interrupted.
Harry started in on his paperwork, stretching the truth yet again and signing off that Malfoy had stayed for the entire duration of their meeting. It was probably all Harry’s fault that he didn’t anyway, it usually was when someone stormed out upset, he just couldn’t seem to figure out what it was this time that had upset Draco so thoroughly when really, Harry had just been doing them both a favour.
He sighed as he finished his coffee and poured another before leaving the kitchen. He was determined to finish the letter before Teddy dragged him off to decorate the house.
Grabbing his books, he climbed the stairs to his office where Kreacher had left his lunch today. He smiled in appreciation, Kreacher somehow knew that this time of year was the busiest for marking and coursework.  He took a greedy bite of the ham sandwich before he grabbed his pile of essays from his sixth-year class. It was at times like this he was happy that the number of students reduced in sixth-year. He’d already marked four of the six essays, only two more to do.
“I have never been one of the best flyers, and so somewhere I got turned around, and then a bolt of lightning has the bristles of my broom on fire. I had to land. I had been in the air what felt like days but had only been around eight hours. I was tired, cold and wet. When I landed I collapsed, I was so tired!”
“Sorry. Yeah, Zabini and Malfoy were telling the truth. The witch just started on him. Shouting abuse at him and then firing hexes when they went to leave. This little old lady. If Malfoy were evil, I’d say she was fearless. Stupid but fearless.”
Sunday morning, found Draco furiously trying to sort and hang his clothes as he ignored the nervous bile threatening to rise within his throat. The thought of being surrounded by strangers who probably hated him made him feel sick. He took a deep breath as he focused on unpacking some of his suits, his mind wandering to the events of the day before. Blaise was probably back in Italy now; his portkey was due to activate over an hour ago. They’d met up for a muggle coffee in the early hours to bid each other farewell. Draco was sad to see him go; it would be lonely without having a friend.
“You’re being nice; you’re talking to me.” Harry ran his fingers through his hair, shaking the snow out onto his shoulders.
Dudley had children of his own now. Olivia, ten and Michael, six. He wrote regularly and sent letters, the muggle way, of course, keeping details of the magical world secret as much as he could. But, as far as he could tell, he was passed off as the eccentric uncle who travelled around a lot. He could live with the lie despite it being the polar opposite of his life. He yawned but stopped abruptly as he realised something.
“Who’ve you got?” Draco asked as he unlatched the window, allowing the owl entry.
“I don’t think so, but they were talking about the war, so…” Draco trailed off, shrugging uncomfortably. “I didn’t instigate it, Weasley. If that’s what you’re suggesting.”
“Yeah, not long after Lucius as it happens, about ten years back.”
“It’s one of Luna’s little foibles. Wrackspurts are supposed to be invisible creatures that float into the ears make the person’s brain go fuzzy.”
“I’m feeling alright, Weasel.” Weasley chuckled as he leant against the edge of the bed, the quill and note pad floating behind his left shoulder.
“Sorry, Ted. I didn’t know she’d died,” Harry looked down into his black coffee, feeling slightly ashamed that it had escaped his attention.
“it’s a funny story about how Patrik got here.” She chuckled. Harry raised his eyebrows as he looked to Patrik, who rolled his eyes with a smile.
The other one was shorter with hair so thin and white it looked like a gust of wind would blow the remainder clean off. She wore large rimmed glasses and no makeup, but her face was no less creased and as thin as her partners. Both looked like their clothes had seen better days.
Draco blushed furiously at the mention of Charlie’s name. He’d known nothing about this particular recommendation. He wrestled with his thoughts, unsure of how to feel. He was both equally touched and irked by the meddling gesture. He schooled his face into the smooth mask he’d used for so long.
Draco nodded as Rolf returned to his office. He placed his bag on the desk before sitting down. He looked around and noted how most of his co-worker’s heads had turned away to avoid getting caught watching him. He took a deep breath and hoped to get at least some of them to talk to him. He prayed to every deity he could think of, including the boy-who-lived that his day would run smoothly before he started to take out his quill and ink. Maybe he could do this; perhaps he could succeed.
“Harry is out at the hatching place.” Draco looked at her for a second longer before opening his mouth to speak.
As it turned out, ‘Tre e Viverna’ was a charming, family-run, Italian place- even if the owners were goblins. Since the fall of the Dark Lord, the force that was Hermione now-Granger-Weasley had ensured that equal rights had infiltrated every level of the wizarding world. As a result, non-humans could now purchase, own, and use wands, much to the Goblin community’s delight. Fortunately, it also meant that blood status was meaningless, and both positive and negative discrimination was illegal.
“How are Granger and Weasley, by the way? I heard they reproduced,”
“What?” Harry asked innocently. They paused for a second as they looked at each other. Draco pouted slightly, and Harry sighed. “I miss you!”
“Absolutely!” enthused Draco “I just can’t believe you’re here!”
“Wow, nice one! I never did like this band.”
His shoulders relaxed, no longer crunching up to his neck defensively. He stretched it out, tilting his head from left to right, appreciating the provided relief.
“Did the other woman attack him?” Draco heard Weasley ask.
Harry nodded as he looked over the food. He was reminded of the feasts at Hogwarts as he waited to see if there were any traditions to follow.
Shit! Harry cursed inwardly as the blush flooded to his cheeks. He looked away from Malfoy’s eyes and caught Hermione looking at him, a weird expression on her face. His mouth was dry as he put the glass to his lips, realising too late that the remains were mostly ice water. He placed it down, harder than intended, as he felt panic build up in his gut.
“So how are you enjoying it?” Harry asked, his face open and interested. Draco smiled, unable to help himself.
‘Your complete lack of getting into the loved-up spirit, for one,’ Draco mused over at him, ‘my own knowledge of your dismal love life, for another.’
‘And you apologised! What’s that, the first time you’ve ever said the word “sorry” in your life?’
’ for each line rather than the full lyrics and jumping as he did so; not for the first time was Harry struck quite vividly with the similarities between Abu the monkey and his very own Ted-monkey.
what Harry had done in the months between the end of the war and the beginning of Auror training, which in itself coincided nicely with all of the people left to nag at him returning to Hogwarts in September).
Harry kept his attention trained onto the coffee in his hands and the joy on his godson’s face every time he took a sip of his own sugary hot chocolate. His weekly meetings with Teddy and Andi were just about the only thing getting him through these days, always in the afternoons to fit in with Teddy’s morning nursery time, but they’re still the only reliable event by which he could mark the passing of yet another week.
‘I’m fine, mum. I only had two small fire whiskeys.’
‘Yeah, I think I do.’ Charlie’s voice was soft now. ‘After all, you’re
‘I’m sorry, what? What would you change your name to, then?’
‘Woah, watch the coffee. What did that paper do to you?’
‘No you shouldn’t,’ he said, finally, unsurprisingly feeling relieved at Draco’s reaction. ‘It would violate your parole. You
‘So you’re not… you and him. You’re not…’
‘So um. I’ve just noticed the time.’ Potter ran a hand through his hair, making it into more of a mess than it already was. ‘Is your mum gonna be worried? Or do you wanna stay for a drink or something?’

people - when they needed it most. And for free. As I became friends with Draco, I began to help him unpack his trauma and deal with it in a healthy way. Although, as I said, we’ve only managed to have proper breakthroughs after his release. After he got out of that hell hole.’
But watching the blond interacting with Teddy, Harry couldn’t help but imagine the scene five or six or seven years in the future, of a blond man playing with another small child - not Teddy - that had platinum blond hair and green eyes… or scruffy black hair and grey eyes. It was a dangerous thought to even allow into his mind, let alone properly indulge in.
Draco looked up and Eddie was smiling at him, his eyes filled with more humour than Draco had ever seen.
‘Because I have tiny hands, papa,’ Edward whispered back at him. Draco won’t pretend that his baby cousin calling Potter “papa” didn’t make his heart swell.
‘Eugh, Harry! That’s so disgusting!’
‘Right! So, our Harry here, and the blond ferrety git known as Draco Malfoy,’ he gave a dramatic shudder, ‘have been using fights all these years to cover up the attraction. Correct?’
a library with floor to ceiling bookshelves, a moving ladder to reach the top, and the comfiest pair of armchairs imaginable (though Harry would never admit to that part). Draco had thrown a party the day Ron moved out and into Hermione’s flat, and Harry hadn’t had the heart not to join him. In all honesty Harry was glad that they were wizards and could perform expansion charms on the bookshelves, or Harry would’ve worried that he’d be forced to move out too, to make space for Draco’s ever expanding collection of muggle romance novels.
‘Could you try it though? “Malfoy” was his father, Draco is just Draco. Him and Narcissa have distanced themselves from that man as much as they can by choosing to go by Black now, you calling him Malfoy just brings up all that hurt again.’
‘Amazing, isn’t it? The feeling of the magic. You never forget your first magical tattoo,’ Draco whispered, not wanting to disturb the moment but unable to stop himself.
‘For a second there, mate, I thought you said you had
Draco was only a little over two minutes late by the time Harry’s eyes flicked up to the door to watch him walk in, only he wasn’t alone.
‘Counter-productive… so, you too?’
‘How about you both stop squeezing me in a death grip and let me in off the front doorstep?’
Draco is thankful that his traitorous mouth doesn’t release the snort he so desperately wants to make, but he is disappointed in himself for allowing the corners of his mouth to twitch upwards ever so slightly. He has appearances to uphold, after all.
worry if he was late home. She hated him going out without her these days, especially since he’d told her the reasoning behind his parole meetings being moved to outside of the Ministry. Any wand-happy death-eater-hater could chance upon him and that would be that.
‘Right, okay then.’ Potter was looking at him in utter disbelief, Aunt Andromeda had clearly not informed him of Draco’s increasing presence in his young cousin’s life. ‘Can you sit down now so we can have our meeting?’
‘Right,’ Draco drew out the vowels of the word. ‘Of course you don’t, Potter.’
‘Oh yeah, I’m fine. Just highly contagious. So, erm, I’m afraid I’m gonna have to cancel.’
for Merlin’s sake. Had done for the past seven years! It would’ve been weird if they hadn’t had some sort of casual, platonic intimacy by now. Harry knew exactly how Draco liked his tea to be made; what his hair looked like in the morning; how he would stay up all night and drive himself slightly crazy when he came up with new ideas for potion experiments. How he would let Harry hold him as he cried if the experiments didn’t work.
‘Malfoy, you’re late. Again. You do realise I’m a lot more lenient than most parole officers would be? Merlin knows why, you’re the biggest git I’ve ever met.’ Potter turned around at that, and the look on his face when he saw Dracos was almost so priceless, Draco wished he had a camera to preserve it forever.
The rest of the film passed without much more of an incident, bar Teddy forcing Harry to duet “A Whole New World” with him, to the obvious amusement of Malfoy. Harry had glared at him and warned him that ‘
The three of them brought their glasses together and drank, eyes shining and definitely crying a little bit. (Ron would deny it, claiming to have sympathy-pregnancy-hormones, but everyone knew he was the biggest softie out of the three of them).
‘No.’
Hermione stayed sitting, finishing her coffee in peace after Harry’s departure. Boys were such idiots, sometimes.
I left. Can you imagine if I’d walked in on them going at it!’
‘Don’t you think you’d know if I had? No.’
If he was being honest with himself, he’d wanted Malfoy to kiss him ever since he’d sat down in that tattoo chair. Or when he’d seen Malfoy sitting in his office. Or at some point in sixth year when he’d been stalking Malfoy around the castle just for a glimpse of him. Who could say which it was, really.
Grumbling as he made his way to the Auror department, Harry scolded himself for not remembering to leave enough time to grab a to-go cup of coffee from his favorite coffee shop before work. Mondays were shit enough, but Mondays
Not that Draco particularly minded, it had been a fairly long week. He’d been picking up more and more customers at the parlour, been forced to take his mother and Patch out for lunch several days, and had had a particularly gruelling session with his mind healer two days previously.
‘No, Dra- Malfoy, wait! I wasn’t- I was just-’
Harry wasn’t sure how he managed to stumble his way over to where Draco was sitting - a vision of white in a sea of green - but he seemed to blink and he’d arrived. He heard nothing, couldn’t move his eyes from Draco’s face. He didn’t register when Ron put a hand on his shoulder, didn’t register anything the Healers were saying; there could’ve been a second attack and Harry wouldn’t have noticed. All of his focus was on Draco.
and immediately wiped his face clean of the scowl, but he couldn’t help the corners of his mouth from twitching up in amusement. If there was one thing Patch knew how to do without fail, it was cheering him up and distracting him from the rest of the world going on around him.
Harry watched in disbelief as Hermione’s hand moved down to cup her stomach. Both Hermione’s and Ron’s eyes were shining.
But the jealousy that had spiraled through him at the sight of Patch, as the sight of the ease Malfoy had with him, refused to remove itself from his system. The jealousy Harry felt over something as petty as the thought that Malfoy could be comfortable with this man and not with him, tore him up and he couldn’t get over it.
before the twist of apparition took ahold of him. They landed solidly in the living room of their flat, with only a slight stumble from Harry which he was taking no responsibility for. Instead, he looked over at Draco, still holding his hand, to continue the giggles that had followed them out of the pub with their friends.

Yep, becoming an Auror was clearly working out
‘Well are you going to tell me how the meeting went, or am I supposed to start guessing for myself?’
, Harry thought, losing himself to the soft sensations of Draco’s lips against his,
Silence.
, Harry landed his apparition in a small alleyway in the middle of Notting Hill. Emerging, he took stock of his surroundings. A few streets back from the famous Portobello Road sat the neatly hidden wizarding community that surrounded it’s own high street. Although charmed to appear as any old collection of houses (although with a very strong anti-muggle repellant), Harry felt himself be welcomed by the wards as he strolled along the road with his hands in his pockets, taking stock of all the establishments around him. He kept a keen eye in particular on the Troll’s Foot pub, one of his and Ron’s personal favourites, wondering if he’d have time to pop in for a quick pint later on.
Harry desperately tried to get some moisture back into his traitorous mouth, which had chosen now -
about attraction? We were fighting a bloody war most of our lives! I do
‘But it’s not! You have to understand; Harry is the best choice to assign to Draco!’
The corner of Draco’s mouth twitched before he schooled it back into a blank mask. ‘Did it ever occur to you why I might think it was such a terrible idea? Besides being yours, I mean?’
Potter had moved on to another story in which Edward had covered the entire kitchen of Grimmauld Place in flour after they’d tried baking for the first time. Draco still didn’t hear a single word he said.
It was also only fifteen  minutes until he was really going to be late.
Second, Draco’s flipping through the appointment book meant that he arrived at the page of tomorrow’s appointments. Glancing down at the page, his eyes got stuck on the name of an appointment set for tomorrow afternoon under the horribly obtuse name of “Roonil Wazlib” - the most obvious of pseudonyms and only befitting two people that he could think of; Ronald Weasley, and…
‘Of course not, Auror Potter, how on Morgana’s green Earth could I forget?’
Malfoy,’ Potter deadpanned.
‘Alright, if you surprise me, I’ll agree.’ He folded his arms in front of his chest.
‘Did you not say it back?’
He gave Charlie a small smile as he stood up, patted Harry on the shoulder and unhelpfully told him ‘
Torn between keeping an eye on the street outside and flicking through the appointment book for the previous week, two things seemed to happen almost simultaneously which were what Draco would class as

‘Har har, let’s just try and get through your probation period and then we’ll never have to see each other again. Right, so you’ve got another six months before your parole is over and we have to meet once a week to keep everything in check, so… are there any days that you’d prefer? Wednesdays and Thursdays are best for me, or Friday evenings, or we could maybe do even the weekend if you can’t do it during the week? Although not Saturday evenings, and you’re supposed to have some form of employment - do you? If not I’ve got all sorts of leaflets and flyers you could look at - here’s one,’ Harry handed him

Harry sighed. So here he was: queueing up for coffee he didn’t want, in a shop he really didn’t want to be in, just to spend some time with his godson and Andi. What he

And how the hell was Harry supposed to help the git understand that he really shouldn’t be propositioning those who hold power over him? (Not that Harry wouldn’t necessarily object to Draco propositioning him, under different circumstances, but that was a whole barrel of flobberworms that he really didn’t want to acknowledge, let alone think about.) The whole thing was a logistical nightmare and Harry was going to have to talk to someone much cleverer than him about how to let Draco down gently, before anyone’s feelings got hurt and Draco’s perception of power play got even more fucked.
Harry’s cheeks flushed. ‘It, er. Nothing, they just said we make a cute couple is all,’
Sure, there were privacy wards up around the back garden (Merlin
Draco’s small smile widened into a grin that stretched across his entire face. It was a very unique grin, one that most people never saw, and Harry was immensely grateful for the knowledge that it was one he saw almost every time he saw Draco.

want to see Potter. Did not want to have another two months of parole meetings with him before his sentence finished. Unfortunately, he also did not have much of a choice.
‘Gods, I have to go to him! I have to- I need to tell him.’ He tugged his hands through his hair. ‘I need to tell him.’
‘That’s what I was worried about.’ But Ron’s voice was already fading as he made his way back inside, the back door and it’s yellow light closing behind him.
. ‘Right. Well I guess I’ll just go then? I’ve shown my face, helped you out with your mum, been dropped a load of ominous hints about some obvious trauma you’ve got that I can’t ask abou-’
‘Thing wrong, Saint Potter, saviour of the wizarding-’
Malfoy stiffened. ‘None of your business, Potter.’
Harry took both of their cups and dumped them into the sink. He’d wash them up later; now was not the time to spend away from Draco. Especially a hurt Draco.
‘I don’t know!’
‘Are you sure?’ Draco had asked him, grey eyes sparkling up at him in the darkness.
With a start, Draco realised he was back in Great Aunt Walburga’s house, where his mother had spent a great deal of her childhood, although needless to say the decorations must have had a huge overhaul since those times. The hallway was light and airy rather than the cramped and foreboding that Draco remembered, and rooms he could see leading off the corridor seemed
Harry felt stunned, had Draco really just responded civilly to him? Had they had an interaction that didn’t involve insults or shouting or raised wands? Was he in some kind of alternate universe?

Was this what he could expect? To be favorited through Auror training and Auror duty and the whole ministry until he was promoted up to Head Auror obscenely young? Or even Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement? Minister of Magic? There certainly were witches and wizards who would love him to be sworn into the Minister’s office immediately - the fact that Harry was just shy of his nineteenth birthday notwithstanding. The fact that he didn’t necessarily, strictly, completely want to

- really so messed up from Voldemort and his dad and being a Death Eater and Azkaban that he had no concept of right and wrong when it came to acting around people who he really shouldn’t be making a move like that on? Did he really have no understanding of how toxic and damaging it was for people to use and abuse their power over him?
‘Of course I do. This year will be your- what? Fifth? No, sixth.’
What did this mean now? What did this mean for their friendship?
‘You deserve a fresh start,’ Harry murmured, ‘I wouldn’t have spoken at your trial if I didn’t believe that. I’m sorry, by the way. I didn’t want you to go to Azkaban at all. I thought I could help but I failed you.’
, instead of just Harry.
Watching the machine splutter out the most pathetic excuse for coffee Harry had ever had the misfortune of tasting, he scolded himself for not leaving with enough time to swing by his favourite coffee shop on the way in. Not only was he now missing out on some actually nice-tasting bean water, he happened to have found out - via his second favourite barista
‘I’m not saying it’ll be easy, and you wouldn’t have believed me anyway if I’d tried to. I just don’t want you to lose hope that there
The words were out before Harry even realised what he said, or how they could be misconstrued, but it was too late.
It was only when Draco’s face turned to him and his mouth started moving, that Harry managed to zone back in. ‘… Harry? Hello, Potter?’
Reaching the appropriate side street, Harry took a left turn and came to a stop in front of number 7. It was a remarkably neat red brick house, considering half of who lived there, and there was a fresh bed of tiny daffodils in front of the window to the left which gave off a wonderful scent. Smiling to himself, Harry reached up and knocked on the door.
So, Harry had grumbled along as he’d packed his trunk, grumbled some more as he’d had to use a glamour to get through the crowds waiting for his arrival on Platform 9¾, and grumbled again as he’d been stared at and whispered about since the second someone had spotted him getting out of a carriage. The only one having a worse time, as it happened, was Malfoy - ex-Death Eater and ex-worst enemy of Harry Potter - so they’d stuck together. Malfoy’s social standing was raised significantly by his new, positive association with Harry, and everyone was too scared of Malfoy to get anywhere near him when Malfoy was around.
Potter clears his throat and stands up straight again, facing Draco head on with the most serious expression on his face. ‘Because he has tiny hands.’
Acting as almost a guard to Malfoy - and
pissed off some Gods to earn this kind of bad luck so frequently in his young life.
‘No worries, I’m free Wednesday. Pick me up at 8?’ Still beaming.
Harry looked up, all thoughts of Malfoy gone, he knew that voice. But when his eyes fixed on to who had spoken, anyone could have seen them harden. For the sake of politeness in a public setting, he nodded. ‘Sam.’
, Harry nodded. The explanation made sense, without the charms the tattoos would just be plain old muggle tattoos. He’ll admit, the whole thought of having his little zoo trotting around his arm was mostly the main reasoning behind his wanting the tattoos in the first place. Having tiny representations of his dad, Sirius, and Remus running around a bed of lilies and keeping him company, and matching to his moods? Harry couldn’t wait.
‘This is amazing, Andi, honestly. You’ve been talking about wanting to get back in touch for years now. I’m so happy you’re reconnecting.’
‘No.’
of Azkaban, or did you forget why you were here?’
Because of the war.
‘Of course, mate. Who else would we ask?’ Ron was grinning at him.
‘No.’
Downing the rest of his drink, Harry grimaced at the hint of nausea the alcohol was beginning to give him. If only he hadn’t invited Malfoy to stay and watch bloody

And if they didn’t strictly need to hold hands in the muggle world, well, Harry told himself that it was all good practise.

broke him. Yes, you act as a reminder for that, but you were never a cause of the pain so it’s not your job to feel guilty for that, but the reminder hurts him. And when he’s hurt or he’s feeling uncomfortable or insecure or whatever, he lashes out. He tries to make everyone around him feel uncomfortable as well, to distract from himself. I don’t know how that’s manifested itself around you, but I’ll bet you’ve felt uncomfortable?’ Harry nodded his head. ‘Thought so. It’s not personal, Harry, it’s a coping mechanism. I’ve been working with him for three and a half years now, but we’re only just starting to make some progress.’
Draco hummed in response and (thankfully) leant backwards into his own seat a bit more. ‘I’ll count my lucky constellation that I get to see it now then.’
‘Good.’ Narcissa nodded sharply. ‘We shall see your fate on Sunday. Goodnight, darling.’
‘Erm, yes? Why would there be?’
‘No that’s not- I wasn’t- Malfoy. I just meant maybe you could make more of an effort to be on time in future?’
‘Bu- but can you not request a change? A- a- or go to Kingsley?’ Ron was gobsmacked it seemed, unable to process the news of Harry’s misfortune and unable to make his way through a sentence without stumbling over the words.
to just tearing through the anti-apparition wards that coated the street and apparating straight into the tattoo parlour. At least there he wouldn’t get asked “what it really felt like to have the killing curse thrown at you”. As if he wanted to relive that every time he needed to pick up a new quill or book (although unlikely) or visit Ron and George at the shop.
What could have been so traumatic that Draco couldn’t even bring himself to say the word of the place he had been held prisoner for three years of his life?
, but I’m in the middle of one right now- just waiting for the charm to settle before I can finish. You know how it is,’ Eddie gave a somewhat nervous laugh.
He saw the corner of Malfoy’s mouth twitch up before schooling itself back into total concentration.
Harry sat back in his chair, thinking over everything Hermione had just dumped onto him. There was no way he could be in love with his best friend of seven years without realising it, was there? There was no hidden meaning behind their easy banter and inside jokes. So what if Harry always wanted to sit next to him on pub nights? Harry liked the bitching him and Draco got up to, being catty and petty about random strangers around them.
It wasn’t until after Harry had sat down opposite Andi, placed one of the coffees in front of her and the hot chocolate in front of an enthusiastic Teddy, and they’d all got past the first few sips, that Andromeda spoke.
I will put “ !!! ” before and after the section as a warning in case you do not wish to read it.

contact with his best friend.
‘Mione! Let the man in the door before you attack him.’
And with that, Harry was alone at his table once again, not entirely sure how he had just participated in the past fifteen minutes of conversation but not upset either way.
. It was nice. Refreshing.
Still smiling to himself, and well aware that he must look a complete and utter fool for it, Harry made his way over to one of the tables for two next to the big window at the front of the coffee shop.
Patch’s eyes bore into his, but he remained silent until Harry gave him a quick half-nod.
‘Right. Well. Good.’
‘Unca Dray!’ came the cries from Teddy.
‘And what, pray tell me mother, is so funny?’
? Honestly, what was Potter thinking? Draco raised one singular eyebrow in what he knew would show as a highly unamused expression.
‘Which end?’
‘Nope, you’ve not surprised me. What an absolutely
Harry grimaced at that, remembering the cold voice calling out the spell and the flash of green light before he’d fallen to the forest floor, before trying to mask it by rolling his eyes at his best friend, trying to remember why he’d put himself through the past three months of training.
‘Relax, sweetheart, I just want to hold it,’ Draco smirked at him, ‘I’m not proposing yet.’
Oh Merlin,
Maybe he’d just been shopping. Draco loved shopping for books.
‘Just tell me,’ Potter said through gritted teeth.
In hindsight, he really should have known that was what Sam was after; he’d booked a table at one of the most popular new restaurants in Wizarding Britain, used

on jumping up and dancing to for each song. He had even forced Potter into singing and dancing along with him, and Draco vowed to himself to make fun of Potter for at least three years for the sight of it. Making fun of it would definitely hide the fact that the sight of Potter dancing around his living room with his godson to a muggle animation film made him feel all kinds of emotions and none of them were good news.
Even after seven years of friendship between Harry and Draco, and Draco’s acceptance into Harry’s circle of friends, Ron still insisted on calling him “Malfoy” or “ferret”. Harry insisted it was a term of endearment. Draco just called him “weasel” in return.
Sitting down into the chair, Harry stretched his left arm out onto the rest next to him, wrist up. Malfoy also sat, on his stool, gathering the equipment he needed before fixing Harry with his steely eyes.
First, a figure strolling past, with thick, unruly black hair that just

Shaking his head, Harry couldn’t help but laugh. It wasn’t surprising that Andi had been in Slytherin, she truly was the most pleasantly cunning woman he knew.
Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes had flourished incredibly in the years since the war.

He hadn’t set foot in
‘Oh, Draco! I forgot to mention, give this to Mister Potter, will you?’ Narcissa Malfoy looked up from the book she was reading and handed her son an envelope that looked suspiciously like…

He usually let Teddy corral him into dancing along to the last part of the song, and they had a tradition of jumping back onto the sofa for the last jump of the song, but they had a guest and Teddy was just going to have to take over dancing for the both of them. Harry’ll be damned before he lets Malfoy see him dancing like a loon with his godson, he’d never live it down.
Unable to see how to postpone the inevitable any longer, Harry began making his way down the corridor to his office. In a last ditch effort to not actually
Potter blinked up at him owlishly. Merlin, Draco couldn’t help thinking how green his eyes would truly be if only he’d get rid of those infernal glasses. Hadn’t he ever heard of eye correcting potions? Did he not wonder why no one else in the wizarding world had eye problems?
Unfortunately, it also meant that it was time for Harry’s third parole meeting with Malfoy.
