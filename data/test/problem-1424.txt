Rather than immediately call out the first name in the alphabet, McGonagall waited for silence, and then informed the hall, "One of our sixth-years has had a change in name, and will be re-sorted as a result." It was that dry, no further explanation given. Perhaps, since the real reason had been in the Prophet, there was no necessity. What was she going to say?
"Oh, no you don't," Draco drawled, and hauled Neville back in by his collar. "Harry!" he called, and Harry looked sulky but obeyed when Draco asked for him to leave them there, and leave them his cloak.
"No, it's true, darling, I was the one to send the invitation to the Lovegoods," she insisted over breakfast on the morning of Christmas Eve, while Father looked like his eggs hollandaise were eggs hellebore from the face he was making. "The girl is Draco's cousin, you know, and it's known at Hogwarts. It would be unseemly for her
"Ah. So you've been in prison yourself, Kaktusblüte. I never would have thought. But I suppose it explains..." Grindelwald gestured around at the new finery and creature comforts of the space, the pillows and transfigured bed and furniture- and by implication, all the food Draco had brought to him. "You had an intimate knowledge, of the bitter unfriendliness of bare stone walls."
They made out for some time after that, with Draco still half-drowsy, clingy and happy, both of their hands wandering. Harry had set his watch on the turn of the hour before the match began, so they had no fear of missing it. "I'll let you borrow a Ravenclaw scarf," Draco promised between kisses. "You won't mind wearing that as much as a Slytherin uniform, will you?"
Draco did not trust. That didn't keep him from feigning the need to sleep early, barring his door, and Apparating out for a prearranged meeting with Dobby, who'd hung around sightseeing clandestinely in his break. Dobby seemed tired once they arrived once more in that ruined hall with the whistling razor-cut wind, and the cold of the alps at night was a senseless beast. But above them, the partial eclipse had already begun. Midnight was the hour they had set, in the heart of the total eclipse.
With a frown, a flick of Severus's wand undid the bubble-head charm. The fact he had already cast it showed how little he expected Draco to lose his nerve at the final hurdle, when Draco had so determinedly inserted himself into the proceedings at every other turn. "It is, indeed, massively dangerous. In that case, I would ask you to remove yourself completely back to the Slytherin dungeons before I begin."
Draco inwardly thanked Harry for establishing guilt other than Draco's as soon as possible. Another still more detached part mocked himself for the retained ability to look to his own advantage, even after everything that had just happened. Everything he had just done.
"Yeah, exactly," Draco said tightly, biting his tongue hard. McGonagall folded her hands before herself, her air growing more grave and cautious.
"Harry," she whispered, looking around to make sure no one was coming in, "Has been having terrible nightmares since the graveyard, you know that, don't you? And it's not just that. He's been getting these... these flashes... he wouldn't want me to tell you, but he's been having flashes of strange feelings- aggressive ones- from outside of himself. And when his scar hurts, sometimes, he can feel what the Dark Lord is feeling. This time, it was anger."
"Ssh!" Draco hissed, as they reached the steps to the entrance hall. "Wait, what do you mean, it's obvious? It's only just happened! I've only told Hermione! Did she say something? Did Harry?"
Harry stared at him for long enough that Draco felt a surge of actual hope, that this was not the end of everything between them. "Why do you hate your godfather?"
"No, it's just-" Harry bit his lip, looking almost as awkward as people did when corrected about Draco's new name. "You're going to be... re-sorted, aren't you?" He knew how sensitive Draco was about that, "And the last clasp I gave you was silver and green, and S for Slytherin..."
"You know the penalty if you speak of this." Draco poked out at Theo's tongue playfully, and then took a deep breath. "I suppose I should begin by telling you, I think there's more reason than our tainted blood that my aunt went mad..."
Draco had the supplies for Wolfsbane now. He quickly forgot a Yule Ball had ever happened, with the pure academic thrill of such a difficult potion coming to obsess both him and Hermione. He felt very close to her on those long afternoons and evenings, carefully researching and casting charms to speed the pickling process of the myrrh, to the point that Hermione predicted they could have the first batch ready to send to Remus by Valentine's Day. She kept cautioning him, though, that the first one or two tries could very well fail, and that it would be better safe than sorry testing it. They didn't want to poison their favorite Defense teacher.
Harry did not, considering he wouldn't be staying there. He just wandered around the housing he had called home for so many years. It hurt him to have to leave it, but it was also so freeing to know he would have his own dorm. Well sort of his own dorm. The thought of being without his friends scared him. Harry never really enjoyed meeting new people. Having to live with a new person was most definitely going to be quite an adjustment for Harry.
Draco went into the only bathroom he could think of so he could find someone to talk to. The girls lavatory. "Myrtle?" Draco said shakily. He wiped his eyes. He would not cry over Harry Potter.
"He's uh..in the shower" Draco smirked as he said it. "But weren't you..?" Hermione looked at Draco but quickly shut up. Ron looked disgusted. "I'll go get him." Draco slinked away and into Harry's room to get him some comfortable clothes. Once he retrieved the clothes he walked into the bathroom and shut the door behind him.
"Okay" Harry laid his head back onto Draco's chest and yawned. Draco finished up the dishes for Harry then took him by the hand leading him upstairs to their room.
Draco pulled away just a little. Harry looked at Draco, confused now. Draco looked over to the tear running down Harry's face. Draco kissed it away and placed his lips on Harry's again. Harry smiled and kissed back. There was no tongue, no burning passion. It was a sweet kiss.   Draco spoke softly against Harry's lips.
Draco pulled away slowly and opened his eyes. He saw Harry staring at him with a goofy smile. Harry's cheeks were flushed, as always. Draco sat up, and sat Harry up as well. Their hands were still intertwined. Harry sat there with a smile on his face. He felt..calm.
"We are together and I'm sick of hiding it." Draco turned Harry's face towards his own. Draco ran his index finger along Harry's porcelain skin. Harry wrapped his slender hand around Draco's firm arm in which was wrapped around Harry.
What or who had caused that? Draco thought. He was getting slightly angry at the thought of someone putting their hands on Harry like that. Draco tried to push the thoughts aside. He convinced himself he wasn't getting angry because someone was hurting Harry, it was because he wasn't the one doing it.
Everyone hugged and chatted for a bit. "Okay gift exchange. Me and 'Mione have got to be on our way soon. Mum's expecting us home soon." Ron said and pulled the gifts out of Hermione's bag. Neville and Blaise were cuddled up together next to the fireplace.
"You'll see" Harry smiled mischievously. "Have her close her eyes" Draco yelled from the doorway, struggling to hold something behind his back. Narcissa closed her eyes and Draco walked over.
"Draco, it's almost time." His mother said from outside the door. "okay.." Draco said quietly. Draco's voice never rose above a quiet. He missed the way Harry's voice was always so soft and quiet.
Snape had managed to sneak back to the dungeons. "Alohomora" He said softly to the locks. They clicked open. Lucius was too busy scolding his son.
"What did you decide for the password Potter?"  Draco said trying his best to sound cold and angry. "Unicorn Hair" Harry said smiling. "Interesting choice Potter what made you choose it?" Harry was not about to admit that he knew Draco's wand was unicorn hair core. "It just had a nice ring to it" Harry said with a convincing smile.  "Do you need to use the restroom?" Harry asked, that had probably came out oddly.
Harry awoke at around 1:13 am. Harry's head was pounding. His eyes fluttered open and he began to look around, to take in this setting. Green banners on the wall. He looked down, green duvet. Where could he be? Harry had no idea where he was.
Draco got up and crept over to his door. He opened it and made his way over to Harry's door. He pressed his ear against the cold door which reacted with a shiver through his body. He couldn't hear much other then what sounded like Harry messing with the covers.
"Is it because of him? Listen baby I miss you, I'm sorry for what I did" Blaise said looking at Harry. Draco took in a deep breath trying to keep his cool. "Go away Zabini" Draco said picking up his pace, taking Harry along with him. "This isn't the last you'll see of me Draco" Harry heard Blaise chuckle.
They had beautiful tents set up, there was a large tent for the reception. Two smaller tents for Harry and Draco to wait in.
Draco finally calmed down after exactly 64 steps. It usually always took just 64 steps. He crawled back into bed and snuggled the covers. Draco was a softie at heart but would never show that, that's what made him weak.
It had been four days since the incident. Draco referred to it as the incident, he would never say the day the love of his life died.
"Looks like you two will be living to see another day." Draco smiled and walked over to them. "We told you nothing would happen" Ron said and got up from the chair. "How is he?" Draco looked down at Harry.
"You seem upset, whatever is the matter?" Myrtle tilted her head to the side. "Well, potter played with my emotions, I was stupid enough to let him, now he's off with Blaise. My damn ex." Draco said sadly.
"Good to see you Sevy" Narcissa smiled and made her way up the stairs and out of the dungeon. Harry followed behind her. "Great to see you Sev" Harry smiled. Snape was rather confused why Narcissa was there. He shrugged it off they had much more to focus on.
Bellatrix had become a very close person to Harry. She gave him advice, she joked with him, and she was there for him. Harry and her had began to become friends, very good friends. He trusted her, he believed she was truly a changed woman.
"But you're aware that we'll probably get more threats right?" Draco ran his hand through Harry's soft raven hair. Harry nodded. "Draco when your by my side none of that matters. It's like I can do or be anything I want and I'm not scared to." Harry smiled and turned his attention up to the ceiling. As if he was caught in a daydream.
"Lou bear, come on" Draco heard a voice say from behind him. "Coming, one moment Harry" Louis smiled. "Hello Styles" Draco turned and waved. Harry waved back. "Well I must be going, enjoy your little Potter problem" He turned and walked over to his Harry. They intertwined hands and went to Gryffindor table. Draco followed and found a place next to the red headed boy.
Harry sighed a little. "It's okay, I'm okay now" Harry didn't let go of Draco. Draco just smiled. Harry let out a soft breath and pulled away. "I never thought once in my life I would hug you" Draco chuckled. "And I never thought you'd be the first to find out just about everything there is to know about me" Harry smiled a little.
Although the spell failed, Bellatrix fell dead instead. Her body hitting the floor with a thud. Someone had killed her before she got the chance to finish speaking. Harry fell to his knees, shaking.
Draco reached his hand out and softly touched Harry's knee. Draco wanted to see the bruises. He wanted to make Harry feel beautiful. Draco knew he could make him feel beautiful because he was. "Why not?" Draco said, his voice softer still with a little edge.
Harry laid there breathless and watched Draco's head fall lower with each kiss. Draco looked up at Harry and flipped them around. Harry now straddling Draco. Draco re-connected their lips. Harry kissed him hungrily. Draco kept his hand spread out on Harry's waist line. Harry did something that shocked Draco. Harry began kissing down to Draco's neck.
He couldn't shake the feeling someone was watching him. Harry looked around the common room about three times and saw nothing. He heard Draco shift around in his bed.  Harry went into his room and grabbed around under his bed for the invisibility cloak, once he found it he grabbed his marauders map. He also made sure to grab his wand. Then walked back out into the common room.
That room was like the sun of Draco's manor. All the other rooms just circled around it. Snape and Dumbledore were looking around. "I've been expecting you, just not the others you were so kind to bring with you" Lucius said as he made his way into the room. All four of them turned around to face him. "Where is he you lowlife?!" Draco shouted. "Calm down son, no harm has been done. Yet" Lucius smirked sinisterly.
The Rat Thieves all sat together in the Slytherin section at the Quidditch final. They wedged in between Vince and Greg, and the Greengrasses, who all politely greeted them, while looking like they would rather be spitting on Draco's female company if he hadn't been there. Draco wanted to tell them that he'd been hoping for the Hufflepuff section but been naysayed, due to Hermione's desire not to show her loyalty as fully atrophied. But if she thought it was going to keep Draco from holding up his banner, she was sorely mistaken.
to really be friends. We're too old for those- those jokes. I know you think it's funny, but someday someone might actually think-"
a second," Draco sulked, "If we ever duel again," and watched Remus start up the kettle while Hermione eyed them disapprovingly.
The walk stretched on and on, but finally, they made it to Kings Cross. "Hey, Harry," Tonks said, scanning the platform for Muggles before leading him forward. "I heard you and Draco go through together every year. Why don't you two go after Ron and Ginny?"
"Sirius Black," Severus said, with as icy a tone as Draco had ever heard him turn on him, "Has wanted me dead since long
It wasn't as gratifying as expected, though, the howling screams of Phineas Black, as he was split open into jagged horizontal lines, living tatters that each writhed in incomprehension of their severing. Eventually, they fell in individual tatters of canvas and were forever still, all without Draco feeling much appeased. Nor did the wand seem ready to give up the grudge.
"Ah, yes, I won a Special Award for Services to the School," Draco cut in. "Thank you for reminding me. After the stellar year I had, it's gracious I'm not asking for three weeks, isn't it?"
"How are you, Myrtle?" said Hermione, in a falsely bright voice. "It's nice to see you out of the toilet." Oh, the pride of Gryffindor: Hermione Granger's social skills.
"You worked your way in with these individuals," Severus intoned, "In the main, by charm, one extrapolates? If necessary, by..." Severus's lip curled distastefully, as he pronounced the word like some foreign virus. "Sensuality?"
Draco stormed off, and had the singular indignity of noticing that the champions behind him just turned to each other and resumed sharing intelligence, ignoring him. He heard Crouch's fake voice, and that was always enough to make him run. And his Ancient Runes professor seemed likely to give him detention for being late, so Draco just claimed that Severus had needed his help on something. He knew Severus would back up the lie, and that was that.
Potter blinked. "Er. Yes. Hello, Draco." He didn't seem to have registered Hermione was there, much less that she'd hugged him, as if the months with his Muggles had addled his wits. "You have, er, grown."
to? But she'd been in my head, the summer after you killed my father, teaching me Occlumency. She saw how I- how I used to feel, about you." He rushed through that part as if poisonous. "So I had to prove to her that I wasn't like that anymore, that I would be loyal. How do you think she wanted me to prove that? Astoria sufficed at first, a pretty pureblood girl, young enough to excuse not- but not forever. And then Bella- so- so I've done things I didn't want to, to get here. You can't imagine the things I've done-"
"Remus," Black said, voice breaking on that one simple word. "Remus, you don't know how good it is to see you. I never...
"Wow," Potter said, staring at him with enough renewed wonder that Draco stopped feeling the drying tears on his face until he heard his father bark his name.
"Sweetheart," Mother said, pushing her hair out her eyes with her branded palm, "Your aunt couldn't have done those things. She wanted to. But she can't penetrate the House Black wards anymore, let alone bring them down. Nor will the castle respond to her. You blasted her from the Black tapestry..."
Mother's face didn't change. "You don't," she said simply. "You're a child, Draco, and this is a childish infatuation, but it will fade. Because you're a Malfoy. You're a
Ravenclaw was slaughtering Slytherin. Absolutely slaughtering them, just as badly as Draco remembered from the first time, although the lack of superior brooms had to be making it worse. Draco didn't remember the exact score this many years later, but he thought he would have remembered at any time falling down 120-0 to Ravenclaw. A Ravenclaw that had already been soundly beaten this year by both Hufflepuff and Gryffindor.
Again, the two women looked more astonished than Dumbledore. "Dobby," Dumbledore said mildly. "What a pleasant surprise to meet again so soon."
"You think she saw something with Tom Riddle... I won't say a word. And I'll look after her, I promise."
Draco rolled his eyes, then cast a Lumos and lifted his wrist. "I'm attached to this snake here, but it was a perfectly good watch, Potter." Potter did seem to spend too much money on presents for Draco. As far as Draco could tell, he didn't spend half as much on average on Ron and Hermione put together. Maybe he thought Draco was too rich and snobby to appreciate anything else.
Dantanian turned, and seemed to smile despite himself. "Shouldn't you be at your party, champion? It's not every year that a first-time competitor wins the whole thing."
There were perks to living in Ravenclaw. One was the ability to re-enlarge his Grindelwald board, putting it up in his dorm hidden behind an enchanted curtain, with little fear his dormmates would try to spy on it. Another was staying up late talking with Luna. He could talk to her for hours without getting bored. Not only did they have a fair number of outlandish experiences and interests in common, she invariably had some perspective on most things he hadn't thought of before.
, Draco wrote in the first free page of his third notebook, squinting at the letters until he was satisfied they matched his memory of earlier that day, and he hadn't messed up the spelling. He was wet from the blizzard outside, but it was hard to even notice that, save for the distraction it was to avoid getting his notebook wet. He threw his hat and furs and gloves aside on his bed and raced to Severus's office, letting himself in at a sprint. He came to a stop only when Severus, in the midst of grading papers, looked up at Draco like he had just attempted to cast the Oppugno jinx on his custom silver nameplate.
Harry walked in and Professor Flitwick was inspecting the students tables. Harry took a seat alone in the back, he didn't really feel like being bothered. He pulled out his wand preparing for the class.
He rolled his eyes and laid his head back on the rim of the tub. "I'll be back" Draco smiled and walked to the door. "Yes?" Draco said to Hermione. "Where are the cups? I don't want to search through your cupboards. That would be disrespectful" She said politely.
"Dray" Harry said once more a tiny bit louder, hoping he would hear. Draco did hear him, his wand clattered to Harry's stone floor. He ran out into the common room to see Harry sitting on the floor clutching his side. Draco was relieved Harry was home, but also worried.
"Wait..." Ron's face dropped. "You don't think Harry and Malfoy like are gonna do anything about it?" Hermione started reading. "Yes I do..eventually" Ron sat across from her.
"Love there's letters!" Harry said excitedly, three letters. Meaning all three people had responded already. "Really from who?" Draco sat up on his elbows and rubbed his eyes. Draco was overly tired, he truly did not want to be awake. "The people you sent them too dummy" Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed the letters from his nightstand. He got comfortable back in bed and handed two of them to Draco. Draco began opening one of them while Harry did the same.
Draco softly sucked on Harry's bottom lip. Draco did every little thing he could to make Harry shiver, or moan. Harry' right hand was back up in Draco's hair tugging at it softly. Draco's hands were everywhere they could be. Draco wanted to get to know each and every curve of Harry's body. Draco continued to kiss Harry, using his tongue to fight with Harry's.
He glided to the portrait and walked out. Draco snickered. "How odd it is he got the password" Draco chuckled. Harry wanted to cry, scream, and hit everyone and everything he could.
When Draco turned his face he lightly brushed his lips against the marks on Harry's neck. He made it look like an accident. Harry shivered slightly tilting his head out of reflex. "Harry, how do you like the dorm?" Hermione asked. "It's very nice like Malfoy sai-" Harry was cut off by Draco turning back around and softly hitting his neck with his lips again. Harry inhaled sharply. "Are you alright Harry?" Ron looked at him. "Yes yes I'm perfectly fine." Harry smiled.
Harry smiled mischievously. "So you're not angry anymore?" Harry looked at him. "No, no Potter I was never really angry" Draco said through bites of his food. Harry really needed Draco, after watching Draco take control and defend him, Harry was on a short fuse.
"Listen it's not something I enjoy talking about Malfoy.. No one knows and i don't ever want anyone to know..can you please keep this between us, and whatever you do, do not tell Hermione or Ron" Harry looked at him pleading. "I don't see the big deal Potter." Draco said but he looked like he had more to say, turns out he did.
Draco found an envelope. He sat down on the bed with it. His trembling hands opened it. He found a simple piece of parchment. Draco opened it and began reading.
Harry blushed, his cheeks turning a light shade of pink. "Darling, I would love that" Harry smiled and kissed Draco. Draco held Harry's face so tenderly. They kissed like old lovers on a patio watching the sunset go down. It was a sweet and warm kiss, it felt so familiar. It warmed both of their hearts.
Draco hadn't noticed Harry staring right back at him. For once they weren't angry at one another they were...calm. "Well.. I'll be retiring to bed now" Draco said quietly the tension between the two of them building.
"You're always welcome in my room" Draco smirked and walked out of the bathroom into his room. Harry followed and slid onto the right side of the bed. Draco smiled at Harry then climbed into bed on the left side. Harry curled up under the covers.
Draco placed his lips on spots of Harry's neck, until he got a reaction out of Harry. Harry inhaled sharply and let out a moan when Draco's lips hit the sweet spot on Harry's neck.
"I told you, you cannot sneak up on me like that" Bellatrix said sounding frustrated. The man sat down on her bed. "C'mon like you don't love being scared?" The man chuckled. "You must be quiet they may hear you" She said as she put her dress back into her wardrobe.
Only an inch of space was separating them at this point. Harry's arms were now around Draco's neck, softly tangling his hand in Draco's platinum blonde hair. Draco moved his hand to Harry's cheek where he softly caressed it with his thumb. Harry's heart was beating rapidly.
"Okay, well you're a Gryffindor" Blaise said. Draco laid down, his upper half on Harry's legs. He crossed his hands and twiddled his thumbs. "Well yes" Harry chuckled. "Do you know Neville?" Blaise asked sheepishly. Blaise seemed to grow smaller when he mentioned Neville's name.
"You don't have t-" Draco said sincerely but was cut off. "I know I don't have to, I want to." Harry cleared his throat. Draco simply nodded and leaned back into the couch. "Ever since my parents passed, I have been living with my wretched aunt and uncle, not my mention my awful cousin. It was alright at first, but then things got...a little bad" Harry took yet another shaky breath.
"And what's this?" Harry looked at him. "It's one of my sweatshirts, so when you start missing me, well you know put it on, hold it, perform a ritual I don't know" Draco chuckled. Harry laughed as well and took it. Draco laid back down. "and um..whenever you start to feel..bad again just remember I'm here for you always ok? Just smell the sweatshirt and know that I'm here" Draco said softly. Harry felt tears well up in his eyes and he hugged Draco. "I'm really really going to miss you" Harry whispered into Draco's neck.
Harry's eyes widened. He'd cried and acted like a fool for that long. "Oh my it is?" Harry frantically stated.
updated Pansy" Hermione smiled as well and began to walk in the direction of Harry's dorm. "Oh and I will win the bet" Hermione smiled. "Forgetting something?" Pansy asked. "Oh god Ron" Hermione laughed and walked back into the hall getting Ron. "Thank you" she said as she walked back in. Pansy smiled and walked away to her first class.
"Give the boy back now. You can't take on all four of us Lucius" Lupin said. "Yes I can. If any of you try to harm me. Harry will die." Lucius chuckled and ran his finger along a small table that sat in a corner of the large room.
Draco and Harry fell asleep Christmas eve with the biggest grins anyone could see. They were both so excited to give each other their gifts. They were restless but managed some sleep throughout the night. The sun arose bright and early.
"I'll be back." Draco got up after taking Harry off of his lap. Draco left the room, going downstairs. "So how's it all been going?" Ron looked at Harry. "It's been truly amazing. You two don't even know. I never thought I could feel like this." Harry smiled and basically drooled over his relationship.
He finished and turned to Draco. "Amorentia" Snape said softly. "Of course" Draco rolled his eyes. "How long until it wears off?" Draco looked at Snape. "about 6 minutes, he will be tired afterwards, it seems Zabini did more than Amorentia, he also used some spells, Potters body is most likely exhausted" Snape put his wand away.
Harry finally reached the alter. Draco took Harry's hands, Harry smiled up at Draco through his tears. "You look beautiful" Draco whispered with a smile. Harry's cheeks turned red and he chuckled.
Draco felt himself loose control, his anger overtaking him. "Thank you Myrtle I promise to visit more." He nodded and stormed out of the bathroom and back into the Hall. He was stopped by Hermione. "What's got your knickers in a twist?" She scoffed. "Not now Granger" He shoved past her and walked over to Blaise and Harry.
Harry moaned quietly. Just as Draco reached the waist band of Harry's pants, a knock at the door. Draco rolled his eyes. "God never can go un interrupted can we?" Harry sighed and chuckled slightly.
Hermione hugged Harry as well. "I'll see you around. Be safe ok?" She said as she smiled and walked out the door. Harry closed the door once they were gone, and locked it.
Pansy went out into the hall and waited for someone to accompany her. "Finally took you long enough" A voice said approaching her. "What's the deal with Malfoy?" the girl said. "I don't know he said nothings happening anymore and Potter isn't at breakfast" Pansy said. "You really think I didn't notice. He's my best friend" The girl said.
"Oh..yes they were" Harry stopped for a second but continued looking. He walked into the bathroom and looked around. To his surprise the envelope was just thrown carelessly to the side. "What an idiot" Harry whispered under his breath.
Draco cried the whole way there. The echoing of Harry's laughter hadn't left Draco's brain for the past four days. All he could hear was the happiness. The happiness that went silent on Christmas.
Draco had awoken only 30 minutes later. It was 12:49. He heard a slight quiet bang. Draco got up and opened his bedroom door slowly. Harry's door was wide open. Draco's eyes widened, he thought Harry left. Draco walked over to Harry's room. He found the bed made and everything untouched except for Harry's wardrobe. It was wide open but all of his clothes were still there. He completely missed the blade on the floor.
Harry rose to his feat, Draco watched with his hand still entwined with Harry's. Draco grabbed his wand and stood up as well. Draco was willing to fight, to die for Harry. "Ah looks like we'll have a fair duel after all" Bellatrix clapped cheerfully.
They arrived a little ways from Malfoy Manor so they weren't seen. Dumbledore was already there. They got off of their brooms and stood there waiting for instruction. "Draco" Dumbledore said.
Harry walked out of his room and into the bathroom. He grabbed a rag and wet it. He slowly dabbed his new wound with it, cleaning the blood. Harry winced when it hit the cut, it burned.
It opened before he could make it. It was Hermione and Ron. "Figured we'd find you here" Ron chuckled. "You wankers scared me. Don't do that" Draco walked back over to Harry's bed and sat down.
"I'm so sorry Harry this is absolutely awful" Hermione said offering a wry smile. "Good luck with that bloke mate" Ron said, still stuffing his face. "I.. um.. It's fine I can do this I can stay civil and calm I'm mature enough..right?" Harry said looking at his two best friends for reassurance. They both nodded in agreement. The rest of the feast Harry sat there poking at his food barely eating any. It's not anything new or painful he's already used to not eating much so it didn't really affect him.
Hopefully tonight would be a good night because of Draco, one without the night terrors.  He changed into his red pajamas and got into his bed. He snuggled into the covers trying to get comfortable. Harry must admit this bed was much bigger and more comfortable than the one in his old dorm.
Draco got out of the shower after about a twenty-five minute pep talk to himself about how everything would be fine.
"Yes yes my boy, me" His father smirked devilishly. "Where's your little boy toy?" His father looked past Draco's shoulder. Draco took a deep breath. "You will be going no where near him." Draco said angrily.
He got up and put his school clothes and robes on. He fixed his collar and looked at the marks on his neck, he smirked. Draco fixed his tie and his hair. He slid his shoes on and made his way to Harry's door.
Draco took the hint and unbuttoned, then unzipped Harry's pants slowly. Harry let out a soft moan when the material of his pants rubbed against him. Draco continued to kiss Harry's soft, swollen lips. Draco slowly palmed Harry from on top of his boxers. Harry moaned and squeezed his eyes shut. "Please stop teasing" Harry whimpered. Draco slid his hand under the waist band of Harry's boxers. Harry let out a quiet subtle moan. Draco laid his head next to Harry's and placed soft kisses on his neck, then sucking up to his earlobe.
"She is dead," Severus said, turning his face away. "It changes nothing. It is only her I have always loved, and her I shall love to the end."
"Well, it never would have crossed my mind," Gilderoy said, the one on the defensive now. "As it says," he pointed out, head leaning over the shoulder of Karkaroff, "
And Potter wasn't there either. Draco's heart stopped until he heard a sharp wet sound of metal, and turned to the front of the beast to see Harry covered in ink and blood, Sorting Hat under his arm with his wand back in his hand, pulling a sword back out of the mouth of the dead Basilisk.
It was nothing like doing it to Mother. There was no voice in his head anywhere, not even at a distance, telling him to stop. More power surged with every word, his very fingertips on the talon wand crackling with bursts like black lightning. Ink poured out and seared dark into the white-hot flame on Father's hand as he screamed. Draco cast Cauterizo over and over until he was breathless. Father was sobbing, tears falling down his face, and Draco heard himself laughing, high and strident, or maybe it was sobbing, as tears fell from his own eyes.
"Because your godfather's Head of House," Montague snapped. "I would be captain if it weren't for neapolitanism-"
"Draco, you can just conjure us a non-flammable room, right?" Neville asked hopefully, and Draco regretted not having objected more strenuously to the common misconception that he had personally created the Room of Requirement.
"Enchanted mistletoe," Draco corrected. It was a very important distinction, and Draco was very proud of his ability to make it, or even to think once he looked up and saw what it meant he and Harry had to do. Suddenly the taste of Amortentia came to his tongue, those lips that fluctuated so uncertainly before him marked for his by some law of the universe or some aberration in it, some turning of Hecate's wheel, sending berries growing overhead and Harry's eyes locked on his with perhaps something of the same thoughts in that head, something of the same-
"Seguinus," Lockhart said softly. "I wish I could say he kidnapped me. Or that he used some kind of magic. But I spoke to him willingly. I went with him willingly. I knew he was a vampire. But he..." Lockhart looked at Draco nervously. "Erm, how old are you now exactly, Mr. Malfoy?"
"Oh..it's very nice...last name." Neville said smoothing his pants. "So does the bottom part of your last name acquire to your preferences as well?" Blaise decided to be bold, to jump at the opportunity. Draco choked on his food now, everyone was barely expecting that. Neville was basically dying.
"We just wanted to see how you were doing." Hermione said as her eyes made their way down Harry's marked up neck. She put the pieces together and got quite frankly grossed out. The sitting down slowly, showering together, the marks. "Seems you two had fun" Hermione smiled and looked between the two of them.
"No one knows that I actually have real emotions, so I come here to express them" Draco ran his finger along the random carvings he had made when he was angry. Harry watched his slender fingers pass over the brick.
He tip toed back into Draco's room and left the note on the pillow beside him. Harry took a moment to look down at Draco and admire the way the moonlight peaking out from the side of the curtain hit Draco's porcelain skin. Harry smiled and swiftly left. He walked out of their dorm putting the cloak on and crept around the hallways.
"It's only for two days, I promise I'll be here when you get back." Draco smiled. Harry sighed. "You know what? Hold on" Draco got up and trekked over to his room. Harry sat up and cocked his head trying to see into Draco's room. Draco came back with a sweatshirt. It was a plain grey sweatshirt. Although the sweatshirt didn't lack character, it had Draco's scent. Harry could smell it right from when Draco stepped into his room.
"Now come on let's go eat dinner alright?" Blaise helped Harry up and lead him out of the bathroom. Harry hadn't even realized he'd ran into the girls lavatory in a fit of panic earlier. Blaise walked next to Harry holding his hand.
"We will, you can come visit anytime you want. We even picked out a room just for you" Draco hopped down from where he was inside the truck. He was making sure everything was in place and not going to break. The sleeves to his sweater were rolled up and he had a hint of sweat glistening on his forehead.
Harry rolled on top of Draco and kissed his chin. "Wake up darling" Harry cooed. Draco grumbled and turned over with Harry, pulling him back into his arms. Harry smiled and pecked the tip of Draco's nose. "It's Christmas darling" Harry said softly as he caressed Draco's cheek.
"Shag yet?" Pansy said with a playfulness in her tone. Harry just about choked on his spit. "Wh- what?" He said frantically. "Calm down Potter I'm joking, I know he would never shag before taking you to dinner first" She smiled.
Dumbledore left the room and the painting closed behind him. Harry sat there for a moment just staring at a wall. "Well then Potter, stay out of my way and I'll do the same for you." Draco said with anger as always. Just as Harry was about to be rude back the painting opened back up. "Oh and you boys have been excused from your classes for the first three days so you can become accommodated to your new room" Dumbledore said with a smile and left once more.
There wasn't much else going on around it. On the right side of the door there was a Gryffindor flag, on the left side was a Slytherin flag. They had clearly already prepared for their arrival. "The password is Phoenix as of now..you boys can change it to whatever you please" Dumbledore said then he repeated the password to the painting which happened to be Salazar Slytherin. Harry thought that Dumbledore hated that guy.
Snape got up and glided across the floor to the spot they were sitting. "Oh hello Professor Snape isn't it just a lovely day to be in love?" Harry said smiling. Blaise smiled up at them. "Is there a problem? Blaise said innocently. Snape looked down at him. "Potter come with me." Snape said folding his hands. Harry stood up.
"Good I'm glad you're so happy Harry" Hermione smiled. "And this manor is truly striking. It's amazing." Hermione said.
"You're lyin-" Harry cut Draco off. "Draco let him speak. Come here both of you" Harry gestured for them to come closer. Draco had this look on his face. A look of 'what the hell are you doing?'
"She's really being an angel" Harry said as he scrubbed dishes next to Draco. "Yeah, I actually believe her sob story now about how Voldemort was controlling her" Draco dried the dishes after Harry was finished with the washing. "Darling I'm tired" Harry yawned and rubbed his eyes. "How about we go send the letters to everyone coming to dinner tomorrow and then go to sleep?" Draco came up behind Harry, rubbing his sides.
They put their robes on and lounged around the Gryffindor common room until it was time for the feast. "I'm gonna miss having you as a roommate Harry" Ron said looking up at the ceiling.
He didn't want to relive the moment. Harry knew he would eventually have to, and he felt comfortable doing it in front of Draco. Harry sounded small now. "he threw me onto my own bed, shut the door and...well..you know" Harry nibbled on the inside of his cheek. Draco's heart shattered. He had figured that's what had happened, but he didn't want to believe it.
Draco still felt uneasy and got up to go check on Harry. He had promised himself he wouldn't be sweet on Harry, but he needed to make sure Harry was okay.
The upstairs of Draco's home was now much larger, all the rooms had been knocked down and made into one. To the left there was a record player against a wall with a couch in front of it. Straight back was a kitchen, the color scheme of it was marble and black. Marble countertops and black cupboards and counters. To the right was a dining area, a long table with a chandelier over top of it. All the way to the right was a door.
"W- well we're about to be so let's go" Harry pulled out of Draco's arms, catching his breath. Draco chuckled. Harry turned back to look at him. "Always leaving me breathless somehow"
"Avada Keda-" Bellatrix began speaking and pointing her wand at Draco who was attempting to protect Harry. "No!" Harry yelled and jumped in front of Draco.
Draco closed the door after Harry left and fell to the floor shaking. He opened up the envelope to read the letter again. He slowly started to re read it.
"I love you so much." Harry looked up at Draco and took Draco's head in his hands. "I love you too" Draco connected their lips softly. Harry smiled into this sweet kiss. A knock on the portrait startled them.
"I know.. I know" Harry said softly into his shoulder and sniffled a little. Harry was so frantic, it made him look messy and unstable. Harry slowly unwrapped his arms from around Draco. "I'm sorry" Harry said clearing his throat. "For?" Draco said looking down at him.
Draco turned around to see Ginny Weasley staring at him. Draco narrowed his eyes. "What?" He asked coldly.
Harry wanted Draco more than Draco could ever even fathom. Draco's right hand was still rested upon the back of Harry's neck. Harry's breath was shaky and uneven. Draco could tell Harry wanted this just as much as he did. Harry let his eyes fall down to Draco's lips. Draco's perfect lips. Draco let his tongue flick over his bottom lip slowly. Harry melted at the sight of it. Draco wrapped his arm around Harry tighter, but not too tight because he had felt how frail Harry was.
"you're so perfect" Harry said under his breath. Draco finished getting dressed and smiled. "no we're so perfect" Draco slid under the duvet next to Harry and wrapped his arms around the boy's waist.
"Nothing just a prank or something" Draco said softly. "Oh well alright" Harry didn't move. "Well go get dressed" Draco said with a little edge in his voice. Harry flinched at it slightly and walked out of the bathroom.
Harry smiled to himself and moved his head back down, slowly drifting off to sleep. Draco also smiled and felt his heart flutter, although it had already been fluttering all night. Draco pitied Harry. Draco wanted to know who the hell had been hurting him. He wanted to tell Harry everything would be alright, he wanted to hold him and kiss him, he wanted to be the one always there for him, he wanted to be the one Harry would trust with all his secrets.
Draco removed Harry's pants completely. Harry was already hard and whining for just a tiny touch. Draco smirked down at Harry before licking his lips. "Needy are we?" Draco ran his finger down Harry's jawline.
"Okay spit it out" Harry pushed on looking at Draco. "You like all of this right?" Draco watched Harry's expression change. Harry was not about to admit to Draco Malfoy that he loved the way Draco's lips felt on him. Harry got up but Draco grabbed his arm softly. "No Potter, no you're not just going to run away from this, Its just a simple question"
Harry simply nodded and started dinner. It took him an hour to make but when it was finally done he was rather proud of the work he had done.
Harry had eaten most of his dinner, which was a good new thing he had began doing. Draco was proud of how far Harry had come.
"I go home for Christmas, get malnourished and beaten. T- that's why I c- cut.." The last word out of Harry's mouth came as a whisper. Draco scooted closer to Harry. "Can I see?" Draco whispered looking at Harry.  Harry let a tear fall down his cheek.
"I'm surprised he'd able to control himself around you" Pansy said shaking her head. "Im flattered?" Harry said chuckling. "Not like that prat, no offense you're not my cup of tea. Draco on the other hand, let's just say he wouldn't mind taking a sip" She laughed quietly.
"Why didn't you tell them?" Ron looked down at Hermione as they walked out of the dorm. "I feel like it would be better if they just fell in love naturally and figured things out alone like we did, you know without all the pressure of us knowing" Hermione said walking hand in hand with Ron. "We hid it from Harry for like 2 years" Hermione snickered.
"But we must find him, it cannot be taken lightly that this boy may die. After all he is the chosen one" Snape said. "Malfoy Manor" Draco mumbled. "Malfoy Manor" He spoke up.
Draco walked into his bedroom and pulled his pajamas out of his wardrobe. "Hurry up I'm cold" Harry complained and snuggled under the duvet. "I am love" Draco responded and changed. Harry's eyes fell on Draco's body.
Harry began washing dishes. His side hurt, he was sure his uncle had most definitely broken something in Harry's body. Oh how Harry longed for Draco to be at his side helping him.
Draco and Harry burst out laughing. "Did she just give us permission to come here?" Draco said through his laughter. Harry smiled and calmed down. "I think she did" Draco wiped his eyes which were teary from the laughter.  Draco smiled. "I know it's your thinking spot, but would you mind if I came and used your thinking spot when I get...well you know" Harry asked softly.
Harry adjusted the way he was sitting trying to remove Draco's hand. "Well then, how is your dorm?" Hermione asked trying to be nice. "It's very nice, the rooms are huge, the bathroom is stunning, the beds...the beds are comfy" Draco smirked. Draco turned his face away as if he was looking back over at Slytherin table.
"Any other bruises or marks or anything?" Draco looked down at him. Harry rolled up his pant leg. A bruise on his shin. Draco sighed and softly caressed Harry's arm.
Harry went to the bathroom to freshen up. He looked in the mirror, he had dark bags under his eyes. His whole face was pale, well paler than usual. Harry sighed and began to brush his teeth.
Draco sniffled and took another look down to Harry. "You really like him don't you?" Hermione said softly as she watched Draco's gaze fall back down to Harry.
"Night terrors?" Draco said staring at him. "Yes, night terrors" Harry said grabbing his glasses and putting them on. Harry's voice was a bit shaken up. Draco watched him intently. "You've interrupted my sleep two times now Potter you're lucky I don't hex you." Draco immediately closed his mouth.
"Anymore what do you mean?" Pansy pushes on. "nothing Pansy." He replied with his head down. Pansy sighed and looked over at a table behind her and motioned for the door. "Well I hope all gets better good day Draco" She smiled and walked out of the hall.
Harry turned around to face Draco. Harry ran his hand through Draco's hair. Draco traced Harry's jawline with his finger lightly. They both smiled at the same time. "I love you" Harry smiled and kissed Draco softly. Draco kissed back, his hand resting on Harry's cheek. "I love you too" Draco said against Harry's lips.
Snape and Lupin were now throwing spells at Lucius who was deflecting all of them. Hermione, Ron, McGonagall, and Madeye came inside and were now attempting to help. There were flashes of different colored lights being thrown around the room. Dumbledore was still out cold.
Everything began moving in slow motion for Draco. His fight or flight instinct immediately kicking in. Draco backed up and wrapped his arms around Harry, keeping Harry behind him. Harry held Draco's arms. "I love you" Harry whispered into Draco's ear. Draco looked back at Harry with tears in his eyes.
They finished up in the Great Hall, everyone said their farewells and went their separate ways. Draco and Harry made it back to their dorm and removed their shoes.
Draco stood at the alter, nervously but happy. His heart was pounding out of his chest, he couldn't see any of the other people there. All he could focus on was the aisle, anxiously waiting for Harry to walk down it.
Harry nodded. "Come here" Harry scooted over and patted the spot next to him. Draco took his shoes off and got into the bed. Harry snuggled into Draco's arms. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry's hand entangled in Draco's silky hair. Draco stroked Harry's back soothingly.
Draco awoke bright and early the next morning to Harry staring at him. Draco chuckled. "creeper" He rubbed his eyes. Harry smiled. "I told Dumbledore no classes for us today" Harry grabbed his glasses and put them on. "Why?" Draco looked at him hoping it didn't mean what he thought it did. "I told him, well
Harry looked back and smiled waking up to Draco. "Oh thank you Draco" Harry took his glasses and put them on. "I like that" Draco said softly. "What?" Harry looked up at him. Draco smiled.
He could hear a door shut and figured Malfoy went to his room. Harry sat down in the shower and tried not to cry once more about how ugly and weak he felt. He ran his hand through his hair and started washing himself. He ran his finger along each one of his ribs. Harry wanted to cry, break down, and hide. He wouldn't, not this time. He finished washing himself and got out.
"We will, now go eat" Ron said and shooed him away. Draco slowly left and forced himself not to turn his head back around to look at Harry. Draco walked through the halls dragging his fingers along the stone.
Harry wasn't put in his new dorm because the feast in the Great Hall where the announcement of Head boy and girl hadn't happened yet.  Ron and Hermione unpacked and got comfortable.
Harry watched Draco pull a basket out from behind a big potted plant and walked back over to Harry. "I wanted to give you a sort of...date." Draco smiled and opened up the basket. He pulled out a black fuzzy blanket, laying it down on the bridge. Harry had an smile on his face, a big cheesy smile plastered on his face.
Harry never had a hefty appetite because of the way he was never correctly fed. If he ate too much he would throw up. If he ate too little he would just cry over how bad his stomach hurt. His aunt and uncle never fed him, they always made sure he was frail enough and scared enough so he would never leave them.
Harry sat down on his bed he hadn't even looked around his new room yet, he was too busy being embarrassed and trying not to cry. Harry put his head in his hands when he heard a knock at his door. His heart skipped a beat. Harry was about to be made fun of or beaten up he thought. "Y- yes?" Harry said trying to keep a steady tone.
Draco had moved over to sit next to his door so he could hear what was going on outside better. He heard Harry's door open and the bathroom door shut. Draco sat there holding his breath waiting for something to happen. Draco couldn't stop thinking about the cuts and the bruises.
"Wouldn't you like to know" Myrtle giggled and twirled her hair. "Myrtle this is serious. What happened next" Draco said sternly.
Draco locked the bedroom door with his wand, trying to be safe before shutting his eyes and letting sleep overtake him.
Harry smiled and walked out behind him. "I'll see you in potions alright? Oh and before lunch" Draco winked at Harry and walked into the Great Hall. Harry followed and walked over to Ron and Hermione who were already in their places.
Harry's cheeks heated up and he knew he would never hear the end of it from Draco. "His journal?" Draco asked holding back laughter. "Yes his journal, Draco this and Draco that." Ginny fixed her posture and crossed her arms. Hermione and Ron were trying to keep their composure, but failed desperately and began laughing. "Well why'd you do it?" Draco chuckled as well but knew he would be able to tease Harry about it later on.
"I would absolutely love to see these on you" Draco smirked and threw them onto the bed as well. "Maybe you will, maybe you won't." Harry chuckled. "A sweater" Draco threw that.
Draco took a seat next to him. Hermione and Ron acted as if this was normal and treated Draco kindly. "Hello there boys" Hermione smiled. "Hi" They said at the same time. Ron waved but was like always busy shoving his face. "I'm going back home for the weekend" Harry said softly trying to sound happy. "Oh that's great Harry! Have fun we'll miss you" Hermione smiled at him.
Harry hit him with a pillow. "So? so ew that must've been weird for her idiot" Harry chuckled. "Wanna look for some formal clothes for dinner?" Draco looked down at Harry as he got up, going to his wardrobe. "Yes where's my trunk?" Harry looked around. "Check your wardrobe I bet mum bought you clothes" Draco smiled and pulled out a dark emerald green suit.
Draco pulled away all of a sudden. "What?" Harry looked at him. "That's just a little preview" Draco smirked and released Harry. "More after dinner." Draco licked his bottom lip slowly and wiped his mouth.
"Fine, I'll quiet down" He rolled his eyes and poked around her room. "Have you gained the boy's trust Bella?" The man looked at her.
"You should've waken me I would've gone with you" Draco said softly yet angrily. "You looked so peaceful I didn't want to disturb your beauty sleep" Harry said chuckling.
"Did I anger you Potter?" Draco said while placing his hand on harry's frail arm. He had never realized how small Harry really was. His height was not far off from Draco's but his body, his body was incredibly scrawny. Yes Draco wasn't the biggest boy but he was definitely bigger than harry, hell even Hermione seemed bigger than Harry. Harry was staring down at Draco's hand on his arm. Harry's heart rate quickened and his mouth went dry.
Ron and Hermione rushed over to him, placing their hands on his back. Hermione's hand clasped over her mouth when she saw Harry.
Draco got down on one knee and looked up to Harry as he pulled a black velvet box out of his pocket. Harry let out a choked up chuckle as Draco fumbled with the box. Harry sniffled and stared down at him.
"Malfoy Manor, my father would've taken him to the dungeons in Malfoy Manor" Draco told Snape and Snape repeated it to everyone. The professors, Ron and Hermione, and Draco all had gotten their wands. They were ready to leave. They were ready to go get back what was so rudely taken.
"I'm such a mess I'm sorry you got stuck dealing with me, I promise when we're no longer living together you will not have to deal with me" Harry said softly and wiped his eyes once more. Draco felt a pang of sadness wash over him. Harry probably wanted him gone.
He walked over and hopped into the truck's driver seat. Draco pulled out of the driveway. "Bye we love you, come visit very soon!" Harry yelled out of the window. She waved until they were no longer in view. "Looks like it's just you and me now huh?" She smiled down at the puppy. The puppy seemed to smile in response. Although he was probably just panting.
"I could get used to the whole suit and tie thing." Harry checked himself out in the mirror. "You look hot as hell in it" Draco smirked looking back at Harry, Draco was fixing his tie. "We both do" Harry smirked and walked over to Draco.
Harry's brain was overflowing with the smiles and laughter of Draco. He couldn't bare to let that laughter go quiet.
"Harry" Blaise whispered. Harry rolled his eyes and turned to face him. "What" Harry whispered back. "You know that Draco's in love with me right?" Blaise whispered back. "Leave me alone Zabini" Harry whispered harshly.
"Harry!" Draco yelled as he watched Harry hit the floor. Once the green light made contact with Harry's chest, his life left his body.
"What is going on?" McGonagall said. "Harry has been taken." Snape said in his normal monotone. Gasps erupted from the people in the room. "By who?" Dumbledore looked at Snape.
He had gotten Blaise and Neville a joint gift, necklaces. One said he's a catch, the other said he's a keeper. Harry thought it was a funny cute gift for them because they were just starting out. Blaise was very passionate about quidditch so Harry found it to be a perfect gift. It was cheesy but cute.
Draco's palms were sweaty. His mouth felt dry. He managed to keep his composed face and remained calm. "N-no" Harry said he could feel his cheeks heat up. Harry loved Draco being this close. Harry could smell his scent, green apples and vanilla.
Harry unwrapped it, a piece of paper. Harry tilted his head a bit, sort of confused. He opened up the paper. Harry read over the words and basically attacked Draco with a big bear hug. Draco fell over with Harry holding him. Harry was in tears, happy tears.
Harry smiled and scampered away into his room. Draco chuckled and turned around walking into his. Draco changed into his silk green pajamas. He fixed his hair and went to the bathroom to brush his teeth.
"For the first time too it seems. Congrats" Hermione giggled and held Ron's hand. Ron was still, completely mortified. Harry was also mortified.
"The other boy is.." Dumbledore had all the student's full attention. He paused a moment to create a murderous suspense, which indeed was killing Harry. Students were murmuring, like usual extremely confused. Dumbledore usually left the whole hall completely confused. His words were always riddles. The hall fell silent again when Dumbledore cleared his throat to continue speaking.
Draco rubbed his temples. "I'm glad he chose you" Hermione smiled. "Me too mate" Ron said and took a seat by Harry's bed.
"Yeah good idea..yeah me too" Harry said just as quietly. Draco was the first to break the intense stare. "Let the bed bugs bite potter." Draco said turning around and walking into the darkness of his room. "Goodnight to you too" Harry said and shut his door. Draco got into his room and grabbed at the collar of his shirt which felt as if it was tightening.
They made it back to the dorm finally after what felt like ages of walking. Harry flopped down onto the soft couch and rubbed his head. "You alright?" Draco toed his shoes off. Harry nodded and held his stomach. Draco furrowed his eyebrows and took Harry's shoes off for him. "What's wrong?" Draco sat on the couch laying Harry's head down in his lap.
"Good morning!" Bellatrix came into the room and waved hello to everyone. Harry smiled at her, then noticed she had her wand tucked into her pocket. He found it odd, but let it slide. Maybe she was ready to defend them against an intruder or something.
Harry nodded, re-assuring Draco it was okay. "Harry I'm so sorry, what I did was evil and cruel. I'm not like that I promise. I would never do anything to hurt anyone intentionally. I was just so jealous of you" Blaise and Draco were stood right next to each other. "that's a load of bullshit" Draco mumbled.
Harry shuddered at the memories. "Your friends are gone?" Bellatrix asked politely, warmly, sweetly. "Yes they left a few minutes back." Harry replied with a smile.
"Of course, I don't mind at all" Draco smiled and nodded. Harry became his normal giddy self again. "Oh thank you, thank you, thank you" Harry said smiling.
"When Ron asked me mine I knew he was the one. It's just so special for some reason." She kisses Ron's cheek. Harry smiled and returned his attention back to his food.
He took the cloak off once he was out of sight and inhaled deeply. The fresh air was exactly what he needed, his head had stopped pounding. Harry walked around the grounds, just wandering about.
"Tired?" Draco looked down at Harry and twirled a piece of his hair. "mhm" Harry grumbled and turned on his side. "okay love just rest, you've been through a lot." Draco played with Harry's hair soothingly.
"They're great, it's always pleasant seeing them" It pained him to lie to his friends but he would never want them to worry. Harry would never want to put his feelings before anyone else's. If he could hide the bad parts of his life from everyone forever, he would.
Harry rested his head on Draco's chest and yawned. Draco ran his fingers up and down Harry's arm slowly. Harry drifted off to a peaceful sleep. Draco smiled and fell asleep not so long after Harry had.
"Harry poo is my soulmate." She smiled and looked off in a daze. "Well 'Harry poo', dumped you. Please stop being such an odd stalker. Goodbye Weaslette" Draco scoffed and turned around. The looks he was receiving on his way to the hall, were disgusting. People were looking at him as if he had murdered someone. Well, not just any someone, Harry. In all honesty he did murder someone but not everyones beloved Harry Potter.
Draco wanted to kill whoever put their hands on Harry. Draco was always having a constant internal battle. He wanted to tell Harry, to let Harry know how he felt. At the same time he didn't want to be labeled as some guy who got rejected by 'The Boy Who Lived'.
Draco ran over to her and Harry. Draco was distracted and thrown off by the sight of both of them. He pulled both of them in for a tight warm embrace. "I missed you mum" He mumbled. She smiled. "Harry you're alive" He smiled and kissed Harry. Draco didn't care who was watching, he needed to kiss Harry. He needed to make sure Harry was really there. Narcissa watched in awe. She couldn't be more relieved Draco had found someone good for him. Unlike herself, Draco had found stability and safety.
"Yes?" Blaise looked down at Draco and Harry. "Sit down" Draco said and patted the seat between Harry and Draco. Harry nodded. Blaise sat down. "What?" He looked at both of them. "Neville's totally into you" Harry smiled with excitement. "Really?" Blaise's face lit up. "Yes and we're having a dinner at Malfoy Manor, You, Neville, Ron, Hermione, and us. Will you come?" Harry said to Blaise.
"I didn't mean to startle you, I was out for a stroll. I didn't think anyone else would be out here"  The girl said sincerely.
Harry closed his trunk after he made sure he had everything. He wouldn't stay another minute in that hell hole of a house. Harry limped and winced as he moved around the room searching for anything he may have forgot. Once he had finished his last sweep of the room, he took in a shaky breath and apparated out of the room. Harry always hated apparition. He hated the feeling of being squeezed through a small tube. It haunted his dreams.
Draco pulled away and stared down at Harry, he ran his hand along Harry's cheek. "Thank you...but who are you?" Harry stared up at Draco. Draco's face fell, as did his heart and his hopes.
"I'm a freak according to my family, I don't deserve to be breathing, I'm a disappointment, I'm the reason my family died, I'm the reason I don't deserve love." Draco felt tears well in his eyes, but he was also happy, Harry had never been so vulnerable. Harry trusted Draco.
He wanted to throw up at the thought of it. Harry's head ached and his eyes were heavy. He sat up slowly and looked down at his hand which was being held. His eyes landed on Draco who was sitting in a chair his head resting on the bed, asleep. Harry smiled. He hoped Draco wasn't angry.
Harry just followed and Draco's feet smiling. Draco finally said something. "Close your eyes" Harry obliged and closed them. Draco lead him somewhere, where cool wind hit Harry's face causing him to shiver a little. "Open up" Draco said letting go of Harry's hand. Harry opened his eyes to see they were on the ground in the middle of the quidditch field.
Harry nodded and yawned. Draco walked out of his room and into Harry's. He walked over to Harry's wardrobe and pulled his pajamas out. "We've got to get you more in green Potter" Draco said to himself and chuckled. He walked back into his room to find Harry sitting on the edge of his bed with his ankles crossed and his hands folded neatly on his lap. "Thank you" Harry said smiling.
Once dinner was finished they all helped clean, still talking and laughing. "Loves I think it's time I retire to my room." Bellatrix said and smiled before hugging all of them. Wishing them a good night.
Harry subtly took Draco's tie in his hand "Well, I'll be going back to the dorm...you can join me if you please" He slid his hand off of Draco's tie and got up making his way to the doors. Draco bit his lip and watched Harry walk away. Something about Harry made Draco lose control.
"Harry.." Draco chuckled breathily. "You probably know where this is going" Draco took a pause to take a breath. Harry smiled widely, tears now falling down his cheeks. "So, this is such a cliché. I promised myself I would never fall into a cheesy cliché, but god I would do anything for you. Harry James Potter. You risked your life for me and I would risk mine for you. Our hearts are tied together, I ache when I'm not with you. Almost losing you was the scariest moment of my whole entire life. I don't ever want to lose you. You're the whole reason I am who I am. I changed because of you, I'm happier because of you. My home, my love, and my darling..." Draco took a shaky breath.
"Let's go eat ok?" Draco said softly and turned to face Harry. "No, you're not ok. Do you wanna talk about it?" Harry stopped him and placed his hand on Draco's bicep. Draco looked down at Harry's hand. "He outed me, he made my father hate me more, he ruined my life." Draco said softly staring down at Harry's hand.
"Now go ahead take it, and try to control yourself considering you're going to be in love with me" Draco smirked once more. "Insufferable git" Harry scoffed and chuckled. Draco handed Harry the vial. Harry took it and downed it.
Draco smirked and placed his lips on the exposed part of Harry's neck. Harry shivered and inhaled sharply. "we have classes" Harry whispered looking back at Draco. "In 5 minutes" Draco spoke softly into Harry's ear.
"Dudley please go tell that thing he should stay away from me for the rest of the night..and he won't be eating tonight"
Harry was ready to sacrifice his life for Draco. That was real love. Real, raw, genuine love. The feeling of an eternal bond being created between two hearts. Souls being bound together. Soulmates.
"James, wake up my little munchkin." Draco placed his hand on his son's shoulder. The little boy just grumbled angrily and turned over to face his dad. "Noo." The little boy said softly. "Come on we have to go to your Nan's house today for Christmas Eve." Draco picked him up and placed him on his lap.
Flashes of different colored lights were flying around the room, the Christmas tree had been knocked down by this point.
His Aunt Petunia would yell at him or slap him if dinner was cold or prepared later then she wanted. His cousin Dudley was just plain rude, he would make fun of Harry for being a 'freak' he would bring up Harry's dead parents every now and then. Although they were nothing compared to his Uncle Vernon. His Uncle Vernon was a monster. He had done unspeakable things to Harry countless times. That whole family was toxic, manipulative, and underhanded. Harry had hoped that soon he could scrounge up enough money to move out or maybe find somewhere else to stay.
"No, I will not leave him." Draco said shakily. "We will stay with him, we promise no harm will come." Hermione reached out and placed her hand on Draco's shoulder. He sighed and looked back over to Harry. Harry's vitals had gotten much better, which was a good sign.
"Yes, just stood up too fast is all." Harry smiled and looked around for his shoes. "Where are my shoes" Harry kneeled down to look under the bed. Draco walked to the opposite side of the bed and picked them up. "Right here" Draco set them down in front of Harry. Harry smiled and slid them on.
He was stupid enough to let someone get close to him, let himself get close to someone. Harry felt it'd be better to stay out of Draco's way. Let him cool down.
Draco laid his head back on the head board. Harry proceeded to suck on Draco's collarbone. Draco would mumble curse words under his breath. Harry finished sucking two sweet love bites on Draco's collarbone and proceeded to do something even riskier.
"You're right, I'm just so used to things going wrong.." Harry said in a deeper, raspier voice, getting more tired. "It's okay love, just go to sleep" Draco soothed. He rubbed circles on Harry's back. Harry intertwined their legs and began to fall asleep in the arms of his lover.
Harry stopped him. "No darling, I have awful morning breath. I don't want to accidentally kill you" Harry chuckled. Draco shook his head and rolled his eyes. "I don't care" Draco kissed Harry softly.  A good morning kiss.
Harry finished putting his clothes on and walked into the bathroom, almost bumping into Draco. They both walked into the bathroom and brushed their teeth. "I'm nervous" Harry admitted and looked up at Draco who was wiping his mouth. "About what?" Draco turned to him. "What if your mom decided she doesn't want me there" Harry tapped his foot nervously.
"We're working with amorentia in potions tomorrow. Snape really wanted to dive right in this year" Ron said smiling. "You take that class too right?" Harry looked over at Draco. "Yeah I do, after all Snape is my godfather it would be rude of me not to" Draco snickered.
Draco laid down and got under the covers as well. "Mind if I read?" Draco looked over at Harry who was taking his glasses off. "You better not be reading Shakespeare without me prat" Harry said smiling. "It's a different book you git" Draco chuckled. "Then go ahead" Harry cuddled up to Draco. He placed his head on Draco's chest and intertwined their legs.
"Darling! Wake up! Get up!" Harry smiled and jumped on the bed. Draco grumbled and turned on his side. "It's our wedding day! Wake! Up!" Harry threw pillows at him. Draco chuckled and got up, he started jumping as well. Draco and Harry fell back onto the bed laughing.
"What the bloody hell was that for 'Mione you smiled! you were being oddly nice?" Ron said shaking free from her grip. "I have a theory about this whole Draco being considerate all of a sudden thing." Hermione said smiling and making her way to the library.
"Well then I will sort the gifts." Narcissa smiled and walked over to the tree. Harry looked out of the large window and saw snow covering the land as far as he could see. A warm sensation filled Harry. This dark manor seemed so light in this moment.
Draco picked Harry up and kissed him roughly. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco's torso. Harry's arms fell around Draco's neck. Draco still had Harry up against the wall. Draco caught Harry's bottom lip between his teeth and nibbled on it. Draco kissed down over to Harry's earlobe. "You're such a tease" Draco whispered into Harry's ear and softly sucked on his earlobe.
"So you've been having fun?" Ron asked. "Yes it's been nice" Harry continued to eat, Draco made him want to eat. Draco gave him a reason, a reason to try.
Just Draco and Harry remained standing in the hallway. "Journal huh?" Draco looked down at Harry smirking.
Hermione and Ron had ran over as well. Narcissa was holding her son who was holding Harry. Harry soon couldn't take the pain, he passed out. Draco cried. Hermione cried and Ron held her. Ron was watching his best mate bleed to death. He could barley look, Ron buried his face in Hermione's shoulder.
"I know he will" Harry smiled. "So, seems we'll be here for a while. Tell me all about you and him" She smiled trying to lighten the mood. "Is he a proper gentleman?" She looked at Harry. "Yes he truly is" Harry nodded and chuckled. They continued to talk about anything that involved Draco and Harry. She was so interested in how her son was doing and how he was treating Harry. It put a little light on the dark situation.
"Okay we have preparations to do come on!" Hermione lead them into Ron's house and up to an empty room which had Harry's tux handing on the back of the door. "I'm so nervous you two" Harry said as he came into the room and sat on the bed.
"How's Draco?" She looked up at Harry and continued walking. He followed walking side by side with her. "You know him?" Harry said while facing forwards, still holding onto his belongings. "Know him? That twit is my best friend" She giggled again. "Well he's doing fine." Harry smiled.
"I must be heading home" Neville said getting up and wiping his mouth. "Thank you two for the lovely meal and great time. I'll definitely be back for Christmas." Neville smiled. "I'll walk you out" Blaise said getting up and waving goodbye to the others in the room. "Need to give Neville a little goodnight kiss?" Hermione teased.
"Did you hear that?" Harry looked at Narcissa. She nodded. They got up and walked to the entrance of the locked dungeon. "He came" Narcissa smiled. "Of course he did" Harry smiled as well.
"So, Draco how did you know Harry was having a night terror?" Hermione said looking over at him. "Well I guess I just woke up and heard someone...crying. I immediately got up to go see where it was coming from" Draco said shrugging.
"Yeah yeah that sounds like fun" Neville smiled as well. "You two should come as well" Harry turned his attention to Ron and Hermione who were already listening in on the conversation. "We'd be delighted." Hermione said.
"Draco Malfoy" Dumbledore said. Draco's head shot up and he stared at Dumbledore. The whole hall turned their heads to look at Draco. Looks of confusion and admiration circling him. Draco felt his cheeks heat up. "Draco Malfoy was brave enough to save us all from the threat. To save us all from who hurt Mr. Potter" Dumbledore smiled.
Draco smiled and wrapped his arm around Harry's waist. Harry looked up at Draco. Draco dipped Harry and captured him in the most meaningful, loving kiss they had ever shared. Harry was taken by surprise but fell into the kiss immediately. They only pulled back when they heard applause.
Blaise looked red as a tomato. "So you're into him?" Draco sat back up and looked at Blaise. "It's like how you were always into Harry. You know it's just always been there." Blaise smiled wider. Harry smiled as well. "I'm very happy for you" Draco smiled too.
Harry nodded. Draco threw the floo power into the fireplace. "Okay come on" They went in and came out in the middle room of Draco's home. The room where Lucius had died and Harry had almost died. They both shuddered at the memories.
Draco tilted Harry's head up to look at him. Harry met his eyes. Draco removed Harry's glasses and placed them on the bedside table. Harry smiled. Draco looked back down to Harry. Draco slowly placed a kiss on the corner of Harry's mouth. Harry smiled and placed a kiss on Draco's lips. Draco returned the favor. Slow and steady. Softly.
"Well of course I can't do it now." Bellatrix rolled her eyes at the moron standing in front of her. "I never said do it now" Barty said annoyed as well. "I said do it soon." Barty said. "Leave me alone you wretched lizard. I told you I shall do it on Christmas." Bellatrix stuck her tongue out at him, mocking him.
"Lucius thought it would be great to torture Draco with you and me." She sighed. "I'm sorry that you're here. It's all my fault Ms.Malfoy" Harry looked down. "Hun it's not your fault at all. And please none of that proper speak. Call me Narcissa." She took Harry's cold hand in hers. Harry smiled and felt a little warmer knowing Draco's mother accepted them. She was a complete sweetheart as well. "Darling you're freezing. This is just awful. I cannot imagine how you must feel right now. If it's any consolation I know he'll come for you" She smiled and rubbed Harry's hand.
School had finally come to a close. Although it was sad to see it go, Harry had never felt more free. No watching eye of a head master. No worrying about his family. No judgement.
Harry groaned, annoyed he had to wake up. Harry yawned and rolled off of Draco's bed. He smiled and looked over to the indent of his and Draco's bodies in the bed. Harry got up and walked to his bedroom.  He stretched and pulled out his robes from his wardrobe.
"Bed rest. I do not expect to see you at meals tomorrow. Or classes." Snape ordered rather demandingly. "Yes sir" Harry said. "Good, Draco keep an eye on him. We both know he likes trouble. After all he does like you" Snape chuckled and Draco hit his shoulder softly. Harry chuckled as well. Snape left before they did, for the soul purpose of dramatically swishing his robe around as he left.
Harry sat back down on the bed just as Draco finished up his shower. Draco came back into the room, dressed in more comfortable clothes. Harry smiled. Draco smiled as well. "Have fun snooping around?" Draco smirked and put his shoes in his wardrobe.
A lump formed in Harry's throat. He hadn't even thought about it, returning back to his suffocating family. Harry got a tiny bit shaky, his anxiety kicking in. Draco noticed and began to rub small circles on Harry's hip.
Once Dumbledore was out of the dorm completely, Harry collapsed against Draco. Draco held him tightly. Harry started to tear up. "I can't go I can't face them I don't want to" Harry rambled into Draco's chest. Draco rubbed Harry's back soothingly. "Sh sh sh it's ok" Draco said softly. Harry was very worked up it became hard for him to catch his breath. "Hey take a deep breath it's ok" Draco looked down at him slightly pulling away.
"Yes that one, it was a messy scene, of course they didn't know I was watching" Myrtle giggled again and laid on her back in the air. "What? What do you mean a messy scene?" Draco was starting to panic.
Draco came into the bathroom. "I have no idea" He shrugged and began brushing his teeth as well. Harry put on comfortable clothes and walked out into the bedroom. "Neville said he would be here at around 5:00" Harry put some house shoes on. "So did the other two people." Draco smiled.
Draco wasn't afraid to express how he truly felt now. He didn't care. He had always cared but now it was different. His father was in Azkaban his mother was building a new healthy life without the wretched monster. Voldemort was dead, his mark was gone.
"Darling I'm tired and cold" Harry said and flopped down onto the bed in his suit. "I'll draw you a bath alright?" Draco smiled and removed his shirt, then pants. Only to put on pajamas.
Draco had already taken his seat. Blaise smirked devilishly and pulled Harry over to Slytherin table. They sat down next to Draco who seemed to be enjoying his food. "Oh hello Harry...and Zabini?" Draco looked at them.
Dinner had finally been served. They were all sitting at the table. Draco and Harry at the head, Hermione and Ron on the right of them. Blaise and Neville next to each other on the left of them.
The four others began clapping, laughing and smiling. "Look at that everything worked." Draco said smirking. "Worked?" Neville said looking back up. "Yes everything worked Neville end of story" Harry smiled.
He laid Harry down and Harry nodded before Draco had time to ask if it was okay. Draco kissed the corner of his mouth and down his jawline. He saw Harry's marked up neck, both sides. He looked up at Harry with a look of hesitation. Harry nodded and started unbuttoning his shirt. He was still insecure, but he trusted Draco wouldn't judge.
He looked down at his arm. Draco's hand had slapped against Harry's wrist when he pulled it away so roughly. His wrist ached. Harry started to cry, to be weak. The flood gates opened.
Draco couldn't help but look down at his lips. His red lips, his perfectly shaped red lips. Draco knew one thing and one thing only in that moment, he needed Harry. Harry's arms snaked around Draco's neck. Harry's hand re-tangled into Draco's hair. "Maybe isn't an answer" Draco said softly. Draco's left arm made its way around Harry's waist, sitting him up and pulling him closer. This time Draco only left a mere centimeter of space between them.
"I mean it's alright if we were, we don't mind leaving" Ron said wanting his best friend to know he was comfortable with Harry being gay. Which now was apparently clear to him Harry was gay, or at least bi.
Harry kissed down Draco's chest. Draco watched him, Harry was walking a fine line. Harry kissed down Draco's stomach and stopped right where Draco's pant line started.
Draco would admit it did look a bit suspicious that he came in with blood soaked into his clothes. He also had quite a reputation for hating Harry.
Draco let out a soft sigh and smiled. Harry felt like he needed to cry. He had a strong urge to cut. He felt weak and sad. The reason why was unknown. Harry wanted to be loved, not just..used. He knew who Draco was, he knew Draco wouldn't use him. The fact that the thought even crossed Harry's mind made him sad. Harry zoned back into reality and saw Draco staring at him with a look of worry or panic.
"I will talk with him sometime, thanks Harry" Neville smiled. "But, anyways what's going on with this whole situation?" Neville pointed between Harry and Draco. "Oh..ha...well. you cannot tell anyone if I tell you" Harry said sternly inching closer to Neville. Harry trusted Neville, there wasn't much to be worried about with him.
"I know he is, I hate him as much as you do, but if Harry falls in love with him or something we have to be nice. I mean come on ever since the Battle of Hogwarts things have been...different." Hermione said still reading.
"Merlin ok, this is going to sound odd, but did you snog Hermione last year because there was this rumor.." Draco said biting his tongue trying not to laugh. "Oh no most definitely not. I don't really like her like that..I don't really like many girls like that" Harry said.
Draco laid down with Harry, he never let go of him. He gripped Harry tightly, letting all of his emotions and feelings transfer to Harry through his touch. Harry finally relaxed and sniffed. He looked up at Draco. He saw Draco's beautiful sadness.
Harry let his hands drop down to Draco's hips. Harry loved the way his hands fit perfectly on Draco's body.
Draco turned to face Harry. "Come here to embarrass me again Potter?" He spat out at Harry. "On the contrary Malfoy, I came to say..sorry" Harry looked down. Draco couldn't believe his ears, he had Harry Potter apologizing to him. What a strange world.
Harry looked down to find a branch snapped in half. He hadn't imagined it, someone or something had broken a branch. Harry's heart rate sped up, he tried to calm himself with thoughts of serenity and safety. Probably just an animal.
Draco let his eyes fall to Harry's exposed chest and stomach. Draco felt his stomach churn when he saw the bruises. He could see each of Harry's ribs. Draco's mouth fell agape. He wanted to cry, he never knew how bad Harry had it. Draco wanted to keep Harry safe, he wanted to know who had given those to Harry.
Back in the Gryffindor quarters Hermione was trying to have a serious discussion with Ron. Ron on the other hand was too busy complaining about how hungry he was. "I think something is seriously wrong with Harry, didn't you notice he's acting a little..off?" Ron simply shrugged "I didn't notice much" Hermione scoffed
Harry removed his glasses and placed them back on his night table. "Well I was lucky enough to stay out of your grip." Draco smirked. "You know what Malfoy you're just so sweet" Harry smiled. "What?" Draco looked at him. "It was sarcasm moron" Harry rolled his eyes.
"I promise" Neville said solemnly and took a forkful of food into his mouth. "We've been well together ish for about three and a half months." Harry smiled, it felt nice to get that off of his chest. It felt nice to not hide Draco. "Oh talking about us are we?" Draco turned to
The day had gone by faster than he expected. Next thing Harry knew it was potions class. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way into the classroom. They took their seats at a table. Snape was straightening up his desk. Harry spotted Draco on the other side of the room and smiled.
"Harry it's you, I found out because Dumbledore said you hadn't responded to him yet, but congratulations" she continued looking at Harry while Ron looked completely dumbfounded as if he had no idea what they were talking about. "Oh I did get a letter I just never got around to reading it." He shrugged. Harry hadn't read it because he saw who it was from. Usually when he would get letters from Dumbledore, it was bad news. "Who's head girl?" He asked, wanting to know who he would be sharing a dormitory with.
No answer. He decided to open the door. What he saw made his heart drop a little. Harry's bed was made neat and tidy, his shoes were gone from in front of his wardrobe. Draco's heart sped up but he tried to calm it with the thought of Harry probably left without him, meaning Harry was still angry about whatever he was mad at.
Draco melted and smiled. He toed his shoes off and got into his bed. "You like the way I smell?" Draco wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry laid his head down on Draco's soft sweater vest. "It makes me feel safe" Harry snuggled into Draco and closed his eyes. "Do you want to put pajamas on?" Draco looked down at Harry. Harry shook his head. "No I'm comfy" Harry smiled. "Alright then" Draco  took off Harry's glasses and smiled. "You really know how to make me melt Harry Potter" Draco said softly. Harry just subtly chuckled and began falling asleep. "Goodnight Harry" Draco kissed his forehead. "Goodnight Dray" Harry said back softly and quietly.
His heart felt heavy, he began feeling nauseous. "Are you alright what does it say?" Harry asked peeking over Draco's hands to see it. Draco folded it up quickly and put it back in the envelope.
"You skinny, pale, blond, coward" Harry's face turned serious as he backed Draco up into a corner, the moonlit corner.
"Of course mum" Draco kissed her cheek. "Now go on!" She pulled away. "Okay okay we're going" Harry chuckled. He walked to the passengers seat of the truck and hopped in. Draco was walking away, but Narcissa grabbed his arm softly. "Take care of him okay?" She said with a soft smile. "I would do anything for him." Draco replied with a smile as well.
Dinner was finally over. Harry said bye to his friends. Seamus and Dean also came over to wish him luck as head boy. Harry made his way out of the Great Hall to the place Draco had said to meet him. He saw Draco come out of the Great Hall alone. "You're such a prat" Harry said softly so anyone passing by wouldn't hear.
They returned back to their hotel suite. Draco walked in after Harry and began removing his shoes. Harry unbuttoned his shirt, so he could change into his pajamas.
"What do they look like?" Draco said happily, "Eavesdropping ears," and handed Remus one before putting his into use.
"Ron could use the extra practice," Luna said with her usual bluntness, and smiled at Ron, patting his arm reassuringly when he began to sputter.
Compared to the sound of Severus's death, the thought of witnessing Father die seemed inconsequential. Even a half-dead boy retained his preferences.
The Gryffindors were quick to tell him about it the next time they saw him, and that was soon. Extra homework and revision meant Potter and Weasley were at their library table almost constantly. They said Hagrid had got himself a dragon egg and was planning to illegally hatch it. "Sweet Salazar, woman," Draco gaped, scandalized by the manner of the delivery rather than the news itself, which he had written down already on a nearby page in the first notebook. "Are all Gryffindors this suicidally trusting, or is it only a specialty of the most troublesome ones?"
"You'll go in together," Draco said decisively. "He'll help you in and out, to make sure you don't freeze or drown, isn't that nice? Remember, Gilderoy, complete immersion."
"What does it look like?" Theo said lightly. "Come on, Grindelwald, don't ask stupid questions." The real Grindelwald let out a soft noise of affront. "Sorry." Theo's voice went wry. "I do have to try and break that habit."
The Slytherins also got to talking about the fact that it was Halloween. Draco was smug that he had the inside line, and was the only one correctly able to identify all of Hagrid's pumpkin carvings to his classmates. "That's a Hippogriff, Blaise," Draco said, "Sorry if that's triggering," and Blaise put on a brave face, while deliberately not looking at that particular pumpkin anymore.
"Hogwarts," Dantanian said, like his mind was already made up. "You love Hogwarts. I'll take that too."
"I mean, is it?" Ron asked, to everyone's surprise. "Hagrid always has had, you know, um, a bit too much of a liking for monsters, you know? He had Norbert at Hogwarts."
Draco's second circle around the stands took them low enough for Peregrine to spot them and aim a Bludger at Potter. Potter dodged, getting Draco in the way of the Bludger so he had to move away too, but it gave Draco an idea. He didn't waste a second in delay before speeding his Nimbus 2001 like his life depended on it straight towards the Slytherin hoops. Potter would be less likely to suspect a feint if it was Draco's own Keeper he was putting at risk.
Dumbledore did not believe Draco. That much was clear, as Draco repeated the same story about the Longbottoms over and over again, and Dumbledore kept asking questions about the smallest details. It was infuriating. Draco didn't understand why Harry had been so depressed by Dumbledore ignoring him this year. If it were Draco, he would just have been relieved. He got fed up pretty quickly, offering to take Veritaserum, even though it was illegal for minors. Upon that reminder, he offered to put the experience in a Pensieve for Dumbledore to watch, or to allow Dumbledore to try and use Legilimency on him.
"Well, that is what we are here to discuss, Mr. Malfoy," she said brusquely, leaning forward with her gaze alert behind her spectacles. "Your career options upon graduation from Hogwarts. Have you any other ambitions for your future, if becoming an Unspeakable is no longer your goal?"
He was going to have to emulate her example with Harry, without the negative reinforcement that had made her teaching so effective. In short, he didn't have much faith in how this was going to go. "I had lessons a long time ago. And no, I'm not telling you who." Harry opened his mouth to protest, and Draco rolled his eyes. "Just add that to the list of all the other things I haven't told you, alright?"
"Harry..." Draco wondered if Harry would welcome or flinch away from a kiss right now. "Harry, you know... you know my childhood wasn't exactly..."
Severus pulled himself up unsteadily, latching onto Draco's arm as his lifeline, and then was fumbling in his hooded robe with the formidable pile of wands he'd taken from Draco's friends. "Which is yours, Black?" he snarled, holding the ends of them up like they were meant to do some kind of Divination. But Sirius's eyes rolled back in his head, his weakness already leaving him helpless to the wrenching tug of Dementors, closer and closer. Whatever moonlight had been above them was blocked out fully from the sky-
boy. Consider this my consultation with one of Hogwarts' foremost experts on dark magic- save, of course, for that expert's godfather-"
"Get the basin," Wormtail obeyed, and Draco's hand put the wand away for him. His eyes swept around, searching, and then followed Wormtail's gaze towards a stone cauldron large enough for almost anything to be sacrificed in its ritual. If they had needed to put not just Harry's blood but his body in whole, to make the Naufragiam, he and Luna could have managed with that cauldron...
But the imposter held it up in the air for everyone to see with vicious satisfaction. "Clear as day, laddie! Green and black, and here's the snake, and look, it's being eaten and all... so you've gone from casting it, to wearing it to
Draco looked away uncomfortably, fearing an outbreak of Gryffindor sentiment. "You don't deserve to go to Azkaban, Hagrid. I don't... I wouldn't want to see you there."
Draco hid self-consciousness with a cocky smile. "Didn't keep me from wiping the floor of your new classroom with Potter, did it?"
Ginny seemed even more fascinated by his wall of photos, the ones that contained Harry the most so. Ron had claimed Ginny was over her crush on Harry, but Draco ended up doubting it whenever he spent any time with her. He told himself, as he did each time, that his determination to hold Harry at arm's length would bear fruit soon, and Harry would transfer his mistaken affections to Girl Weasley. All he had to do was wait, for an outcome he told himself he desired.
"Draco?" Father said as he got up, voice coming out of that mask in pure horror. Draco couldn't tell if it was fear for Draco, that he might be hurt by the Dark Lord, or fear
Draco's grin wouldn't leave his face until he fell asleep, even with the petrified face of the other boy staring right at him.
"Oh, Harry, how could you?" Granger said at once, tugging at Potter's sleeve plaintively, and Draco began to pick himself up in turn.
"I'm sorry, Draco," Myrtle said dramatically, "But the heart wants what it wants." She soared over to Krum, stroked a ghostly hand over the musculature of his shoulder, and delivered rather bluntly, "Draco's gay. Harry Potter fancies him, they took a steamy bath together." Hermione got a pole-axed look, but it was erased by indignation when Myrtle added, "And Draco's been a busy boy, you know... he and Hermione have been coming here to brew an
"Where is the joy in life," Dumbledore mused serenely, "Without a spot of unpredictability?" His tone was indulgent, as if facing nothing worse than the tantrum of a spoiled child.
"This is going to sting," Remus warned, and Draco sat up, turning his back to him. "What are you doing?"
"No, it's just..." Lamia flinched, not seeming to want to speak aloud the next paragraph. Dantanian took over for her.
The other Slytherin boys were none-too-pleased to see him when he emerged the next morning, though his hair was starting to grow long enough to let hang in his eyes and hide any swollenness. After Vince let Draco in on the tale of a troll attack, and Draco tiredly feigned surprise, the air of the other boys turned colder. Blaise was the one to start complaining about Draco's absence, and their return to the dormitory and the realization Draco wasn't with them. Theo sounded as hurt as he did curious as they outlined their failures to open Draco's curtains to ensure he was inside, eventually assuming Draco had charmed the curtains locked and the outside silent, rather than going to alert Severus of Draco's absence with the castle in peril.
"I'm not, though," Severus said, advancing on the boy with a poor imitation of the prowl that would menace so many students, the uncertainty as evident in his bearing as the tentative air of triumph. "I'm on to all your tricks. I've figured out where your
He pushed Harry off him, lying back and running his hands through his hair, trying to gather himself. But his body felt hot all over, like one great pulsing ache, that only Harry's touch, only that pressure could satiate, an itch nothing else could scratch...
And there it was, the real reason Harry was up there at the cell. That Grindelwald cut right to Draco's weakest point, and in such a pleasant tone- any reaction of Draco's part would tell its own story. But then, this was a story Draco
cheering from Slytherin, namely by Blaise in the front row, beside Luna in her snake hat. But there were far more boos and hisses from that direction. Not far behind Blaise and Luna were Bletchley, Montague, Pucey, and Warrington, hulking forms instantly recognizable, even if they hadn't been yelling out taunts to draw attention to themselves. Much of their sixth and seventh-year classes seemed happy to join them.
"No, I, what it is... I need to tell you something," Theo said, taking both of Draco's hands, before looking into his face with a look Draco remembered, fascination without wanting it to be that: desire Theo could never fully admit to himself, even if he was about to try and admit it to Draco.
Merlin, they hadn't all had to come gawp so much, though, some remaining craning their necks even after Severus swept past. Granger was jotting down notes frantically, as if she could somehow capture the precise color in words. Severus could have just told them all to try and get their potion the color of Potter's excessively green eyes.
Once Lupin had Hagrid hustling off again, quite contentedly from the sound of it, he returned to the hut, dispersing the fog inside with a wave of his wand. He looked down, and Draco saw at the same time as Lupin that Black had escaped with his wand in tow. Only the talon wand rested on the ground. Draco would have told him not to touch it, if he could speak.
"No way," Neville breathed. "But you're so good at magic! How did you end up in Slytherin, then? Just because your family had been in it, did the hat put you there?"
"What I promised," Draco said, bracing himself for a thunderstorm of a reaction. What could Grindelwald do now to retaliate against them, anyway?
He had expected that group, but he had also invited all the witnesses for the defense from the trial, even Millie and Pansy. Mrs. Weasley had okayed that move, knowing they owed them, though she looked uncomfortable about it. Draco had just told her they would never show up anyway. But to his astonished excitement, they appeared together by their own custom Portkey, looking around as warily as if they expected a chorus of Stupefy to greet their arrival. He was familiar with that feeling of being deep behind the lines in enemy territory, and unable to understand why you had not yet been cast out from their midst. He directed them to the tent with all the refreshments, including the alcoholic ones, and joined them in sneaking some mixed drinks when the dozing bartender had his back turned.
"You go on without me," Draco said weakly, trying to swallow back bursts of nausea to his throat, though they didn't seem likely to turn to full retching. "We shouldn't overwhelm him."
Until he saw her eyes were not following the flame, but his wand hand from so close to her. Could she have recognized the talon wand as Aunt Bella's somehow? It hadn't been a familiar sight to her before, given how she never had them do magic in
Ron's rat had always been a sorry sort of creature, but now, he had droopy whiskers, sunken eyes, and a kind of gauntness which would have put him right at home hung on the walls of 12 Grimmauld Place. "At least he didn't come back
"As you said, Albus," Umbridge said, saying Dumbledore's name like a filthy word, "We should learn the characters of these young witnesses of yours, should we not? And the things that...
"Last-minute change of plans," Draco said innocently. "An owl from Hermione. It's these horrid Muggles he has raising him, you'd never believe what
"I've been your mate for over four years now!" Ron said, sputtering in indignation. "And you still put me behind my brother because you think he's
Severus ignored this poor show of gratitude, but Draco prodded as well. "Severus, do I need to tell you what I'll do if you back out or undermine-"
Draco kept his grip, beaming from ear-to-ear. "Christmas together! Christmas Day together as godfather and godson!"
"Soon, the five watched the burial of Obitus, thought stricken dead by some curse from God above for his iniquities. After the funeral was done and the sun was down, they intruded in the dust. Before the sun rose, their new magic led them to Estella's slain body, buried in the grave meant for the lord's son. So they took her to Eros, and buried her together in the way her father the gravedigger had once buried so many, in the graveyard with her ancestors, where the lord's son still lay as well.
"I love you too," Draco said, loud enough for not just Sirius and Remus but Cornelius Fudge to start and turn.
"No, Gilderoy," Draco said, with exquisite, icy reserve. "And to think I thought you experiencing a crisis of vocation. I think it's
Draco had reason to be doubly grateful of his own determination not to let Severus expose Remus as Moony this time around. Remus would have been treated very differently in court as a werewolf. And before Draco had gotten to know him, he knew, he would have seen little wrong with that.
"You evil traitor," Harry spat at Severus, and Draco had no idea whether he was acting. For Draco's part, this shook none of his faith in Severus's loyalties. In the current situation, there was nothing else Severus
If Father had truly wished to punish Dobby, and not just scare the others- and it had seemed real anger behind that punishment- he could hardly have picked a worse method to accomplish it.
Severus stared at Sirius, so long that Draco feared Severus would draw his wand. If he did, Cruciatus seemed the

He squared his shoulders, smirked at Theo, and drawled out, "Ready to have your charms look sub-par in comparison to mine, gentlemen?" To his surprise, none of them looked offended or amused, just terrified, even Theo, as if they all took him at his word. And
It didn't budge. Harry pulled hard, time and again, and didn't so much as make a dent, palm gliding over it as ineffectually as if he was trying to turn a liquid solid with only touch.
Charlie looked every inch a dragontamer, built like a brick house. His shoulders and bare arms were wrought with visible ridges of muscle under his Ireland kit with the sleeves cut off, thighs in ripped black jeans solid enough to show the arch of more muscles under the broad rips. He had ginger hair lightened with sun, and struck a different figure from any other Weasley Draco had seen, even not taking into account the freckled tan, or the gash-like scar on one arm and relatively new-looking dragon burn on another.
of staying with you..." He laid a hand on Dorian's arm, and the flush on Dorian's face went down his neck, lips parting helplessly. "Tell me what it would take."
"I saved you from your father! I saved you from the Great Lake! I had to fight in the tournament when I didn't want to and everyone hated me for it, and all you did was yell at me for helping Cedric! I saved you from the Dementors that
Harry Potter's well-wishers may only hope that Miss Bulstrode is proved wrong, and Mr. Potter will not have his heart broken by the notorious son of a notorious Death Eater.
Hermione was less sanguine when they emerged from the kitchens, and she was faced with the prospect of getting ready for the ball. Draco told her to get everything and bring it to Severus's rooms. Hermione had some Sleak-Eezy hair potion that Draco was sure would serve her well, and didn't wilt at all at Severus's astonished glaring at finding her in his rooms.
say it at Easter. They were talking about her cousin, Sirius Black, and Father said that he wasn't the one to be the Potters' Secret Keeper and turn them in to the Dark Lord, it was Pettigrew, and that Pettigrew had framed Black of his murder and fled in hiding, probably in his Animagus form as a rat- Mother had already known the first part, but she didn't know Father still thinks Pettigrew is
"Yeah," Ron said, bleeding exhaustion from every pore, and finally accepted Draco's hand up. Neville helped support him on the other side as they made their slow wet way towards the exit. "Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Draco. Listen- did Harry really do it? You're
see," Voldemort said coldly. "Wormtail, take the Potter boy down from the headstone." Wormtail rushed to oblige, silver hand shining in the light. "Yes, smile you might, at the hand that I have bestowed upon you as blessing. Such blessings shall fall on you all... if you remain loyal. For those disloyal... I have different gifts that await. Untie the boy." Wormtail's new hand made quick work of the ropes. When Harry scrambled up, stiff rope-burned limbs not slow in moving to try to save himself, Voldemort raised his wand and called, "Crucio!"
"Theo?" Draco gasped, at the same time as Harry gasped, "Nott," Grindelwald went, "Who is this," and Theo said, "Hello, Grindelwald."
Draco followed Harry's eyes and gesture to the fall of now-raven hair. "Just to keep me safe. It'll be back to normal when break's over."
"Enough of sentiment," Severus said briskly. But Draco thought he looked pleased at this genuine admission by his godson's. That gratification sent Draco's insides into a panic, threatening respiratory difficulties, merely with the all-too-common thought,
"Oh my God," Harry blurted the moment they were inside. "It'd be worth becoming a prefect to use this bathroom!"
Mr. Weasley took up the story then, and by the time they were done, Draco found he had somehow fallen asleep standing up against Mother's shoulder. At the very least, the two men had not come to blows. When Draco woke up enough to corroborate Mr. Weasley's account, of intervening to prevent Draco's arrest from being executed, Father was even forced to grudgingly thank him. Mr. Weasley looked at Draco directly and asked if he was going to be alright, in a way that made it unmistakable he didn't just mean from the night's events, but at being left with his father. Draco nodded and let him Floo out.
Draco wondered if it would have been counterproductive in the long run, to corner Flint right before tryouts and threaten to curse him if he didn't put him on the team. Or just cursed Higgs, that might have also done nicely.
"And I believed it, Peter," Lupin said, and let his arm settle on Black's shoulder, the pain of wasted years alive in his voice. "I believed that you were a hero, and Sirius the one who destroyed our lives. I didn't even believe Sirius until I saw you. How could you have done it, Peter? Look at Harry. How could you have left him without a mother and father?"
"Luna's doing it," he said defensively, and sure enough, Draco's favorite cousin was there in the thick of it, jumping up and down demanding fireballs.
It would be a lot easier, though, to figure out what he should be doing, and whether he had already altered the blue loop past recognition, if he had any idea how it had gone the first time. He'd been so distant from these events, he didn't know what the active approach should be to ensure the loop's dictates followed. He knew that one day in June, Black was captured at Hogwarts, somehow escaped, and that there was no Dementor presence for the final days of term or the next year. His name had never been formally cleared before he died, and Draco had no idea how Potter had become close enough to Black to mourn him.
"So! Charlie! What are you doing in Hogsmeade?" Potter asked, with a forced brightness in his tone about as convincing as Krum's attempts to pretend he didn't like Hermione. Either he was still all pearl-clutching about the age difference, or he must really not like the gorgeous dragontamer giving someone else attention. Poor Potter's bisexual awakening had yielded so few dividends.
Potter looked inordinately guilty. "Oh, I know, you do always wear that, I just- I just remembered that when we were sleeping in the Great Hall, on Halloween, that you had trouble with the snake, and it wouldn't go to sleep when you told it, so..."
Draco laughed out at him breathless and aggressive, as loud as he could make it pursue Severus. "There's no peace for me! I'm- what I am is a
"You're dead, Harry Potter," said Riddle's voice from the other side of the creature. "Dead. Even Dumbledore's bird knows it. Do you see what he's doing, Potter? He's crying. I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time. I'm in no hurry. So ends the famous Harry Potter. Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, his friends crushed by a Basilisk, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry... She bought you twelve years of borrowed time... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must."
," she said, and thrust into his vision a golden necklace, which she fished out from under her Gryffindor tie. An hourglass hung from a long fine chain, small but crystalline in its brilliance, and it hung in the air like a leftover snowflake from the winter.
"Harry will want to see you," Hermione persisted, waving the others on. As they left, Draco could hear Bill Weasley asking his sniggering brothers why Draco was banned from their tower.
"I'll see you soon," Harry said, catching Draco's hand as they reached the door. The passage through so many glaring, murmuring House Black portraits was commonplace by now, and Draco barely registered their disapproval as they finally stopped by the door.
Draco considered. "Both, if they're on offer. Alright. Demon Goddess Hecate, hear me." Gilderoy went off and plastered his back to the furthest wall, while Draco cut and healed his palm again. He smeared blood over the whole talon wand.
Just the wings were a tour de force, custom-ordered with a wingspan of over six feet, though Draco didn't have to keep them unfurled. They were charmed to respond to his thoughts like real wings, and almost looked real, curling out from laced-up midnight blue leather. His boots were the same leather, laced up to his knees, his trousers form-fitting and darker, with a blue dragon worked across the leather over his chest in blue diamonds and sapphires, coiling all the way from his waist up to his collarbones. His mask was also midnight blue leather, just over his eyes, lined in sapphires too.
"Harry really messes with your head, doesn't he," Ron laughed, diving to grab the Quaffle after Draco just let it hit his arm for a third time rather than catching it. He swooped back up with a cheeky grin. "What were you whispering about over there anyway? I thought you might like Nott these days. Don't tell me you fancy
Gilderoy, who knew Draco's real purposes, would have to be a good liar, his much-maligned skill on demand. "Severus," he said in a placating tone, sliding off the arm to put a tentative hand on Severus's sleeve. Severus's chest rose and fell, a harsh exhale, but he did not try to remove the hand. "He doesn't confide in me how he feels either. I worry about him too, believe me." That almost sounded a truth in service of a lie.
Dobby took a deep breath. "Dobby would like to tell, since Dobby is with friends. It is the worst and best memory Dobby has." Draco just willed him not to mention Draco's part in it more than necessary. "Dobby does not want to bore Harry Potter. Harry Potter is a great wizard who-"
Nymphadora's Stunner caught Black square in the face. He crumbled to the ground, with Robards behind her raising his wand over Black-
"Neville," Ginny said in alarm, going over to where Neville was still standing in place, though the predatory mistletoe had curled and grown itself away. "Neville, you're bleeding."
Being thirteen, it turned out, delivered the unfortunate situation of not knowing where to put his sleeping bag. Little order seemed to have been obeyed when it came to houses, as people just rushed in small groups of often cross-house friends and relatives, to find the most favorable places to put themselves in Peter Weasley's allotted timeframe. Draco didn't see any of the other third-year Slytherins, and even if he had, he didn't know how safe he would feel sleeping around them, without a bed to charm and lock around himself. It would be the first time he had slept without any real protective spells in many years, and maybe that meant it would best to try and not sleep at all...
"Draco, you were in the lake, don't you want to come too-" Harry began, and then cut himself off, pushing back his messy hair with a self-deprecating laugh. "Wait, how many times do you have to remind me, you're banned from our common room, aren't you? You don't think an exception could be made just this once?"
"How about if I told you that makes Sirius sad each time to see or hear it, because it makes him remember my father is dead and gone it forever? And that if you don't get into the habit of always using Harry, you know you'll slip up with him..."
"It's not Bella, except for how savage you duel. And your father wasn't ever this good with a wand, that I remember for sure."
Harry had been pressing him to work on offensive spells, and to have more than very tame practice duels, ever since their first session, the Protego Diabolica fiasco notwithstanding. The problem was that Harry didn't see it as a fiasco, and sometimes spoke of it fondly as "the coolest thing he had ever seen." But in this, Harry's willingness to wade blindly into danger would serve Draco well. He planned out a lesson with Everte statum, Depulso, and most importantly Diffindo, if he couldn't get Harry slammed enough in the face to make him bleed without outright cutting him. He had that lesson on his mind, and didn't look at the Marauder's Map properly that one solitary trip from the dungeons to the Shrieking Shack, and that was his undoing.
"Given that only a drop or two is necessary at a time, for one person," Hermione said sharply, "That shouldn't be a difficulty."
The return of the Dark Lord actually proved easier to sort. Draco had his spell ready to disable the Portkey, though it would be possibly touch-and-go being sure he saw the cup last. But at least he was relatively sure who'd be behind the cup being one, Crouch and/or Karkaroff. And then there was his vial of Felix Felicis, small enough that he decided to drink every drop of it on the morning of June 24th. Hopefully, that would make him lucky enough for his timing to work, and the Portkey plot to fail. Any future plots of the Dark Lord's, well, it wouldn't be on Draco anymore to stop them.
And then Harry Potter strode out from the fire, flame billowing behind him in every direction, as huge a halo as any angel could wish for. Draco had thought he was beautiful drawing the sword from the Basilisk's mouth. But he had never seen anything half so beautiful as Harry emerging untouched from Draco's flames. He was grinning, the mad bastard, and walked as confidently towards Draco as if they were in the Gryffindor common room.
"Look!" Cho groaned, shoved the parchment at him, and buried her face in her hands. Draco looked down, wondering if the letter was from Tonks. He didn't recognize the handwriting. It didn't look whimsical enough for her. It was steady and masculine, with a resolve behind the words, as well as style, that spoke of a decision made in full confidence. It read,
"It's an Imperturbable charm," Draco explained. "I just picked it up, Mrs. Weasley started using it to keep out the Extendable Ears." He'd spoken without thinking, so at Harry's annoyed look at something else he didn't understand, he quickly added, "Those are these devices Fred and George have made, we've been using them to eavesdrop on meetings of the Order of the Phoenix-"
"No," Dantanian said, as Frederick went over and tried to read over his shoulder, eggs forgotten. "It's for a different school." He turned to them accusingly. "Why would I be invited to the British school, instead of the French? I was born in Paris-"
"It has happened," she told the silent staff room. "A student has been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself."
"And I work in Romania with dragons," Charlie said with a laugh, serving Draco and Potter sausages of theirs, and handing Bill the ice to distribute with the water that Potter's trio had apparently gathered earlier. "Some call that a dragontamer. The jokes write themselves, don't they?"
"You weren't," Potter said, awake as he had ever been, "Weren't really hurt in a potions accident?" Ron had sat up too, all of his drowsiness falling away.
"Karkaroff's Dark Mark is getting darker again and all that," Draco said casually. "Yours must be too, right?" Draco could see where clutching the wrist of his hurt hand had pushed up the left sleeve. Father was usually so careful, but a darker version of his Mark was indeed visible, just the bottom. Father quickly pushed his sleeve down when Draco saw.
Draco pushed his arms aside to poke at his scar. "Is this true, Harry?" he purred. "Do the other Gryffindors suffer from the consequences of your insatiable erotic appetite?"
Potter's eyes focused on him, long and plaintive, for a suspended moment, before his jaw set and he squared his shoulders. "Yes, Draco. That's what I've been trying to say. Friends."
Draco was disappointed but not surprised. "You're holding our godfather-godson bonding time as ransom against me?" he pouted. "You don't mean it. You wouldn't really send me away."

"No, it's not that. I guess I was just thinking that every time I think I know most of your secrets, it turns out you have so many more, every time. It's like I'll never know them all..."
"Oh!" Harry exclaimed, and then blanched completely, gripping onto the edges of the bath behind him with undue terror. "Wait- does that mean, who we fancy the most or something- who we have the most
won't," Draco laughed, arching like a cat and clinging to Harry. He wanted Harry all over him, not just the surface but everywhere, down to the
And no one even dared question Wooky and Nissy's presence, nor Draco and Luna picking up Dobby and putting him on their shoulders, for the whole walk back to the castle.
Harry was unusually full of opinions, to the point he almost seemed as nervous as Ron. Though admittedly, to a Muggle-raised boy, casually hiring a troupe of ghost nuns to play for a Halloween party in your house common room might seem rather confronting. But it fit the ambience, Samhain inspiration given reality in the preeminence of bluebell fires that Flitwick and Hermione had helped Draco place everywhere, along with concentric wreaths of blue flame. With furniture cleared out of the way and a dance floor laid down in midnight blue velvet, it
. He was sure he was onto something when Erised became Desire. Weasley made a noise like he appreciated it too while staring over his shoulder. "You think it's all just written backwards? That's brilliant!"
"Protego!" Draco cried, shielding against the red light that looked already more than effective enough to fell him.
The party's decorations were admittedly beautiful. Slughorn had obviously magically enlarged his office. But there were enough people to crowd the place to the rafters- in a way Slughorn had no doubt intended, to show off his reach. Draco's eyes began to inventory the people he knew and those he didn't, after his eyes first sought out Severus. So many people here who might see him slipping out before Veritaserum disappeared that night...
"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power, in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living?
it. He could grab her, pull down her left sleeve if he liked to see. She was in no state to stop him. But he did not have it in him to look. "I don't believe you. Father's forcing you to. You did this because you're afraid of him, you've always done whatever he said because you're afraid of him and your sister-"
Draco gave Potter his most unimpressed look, as if that Basilisk-slaying image didn't haunt so many of his nights. "Don't be worrying about Death Eaters yet, Potter. You should be scared of the Dementors first. All a Basilisk can do is kill you. I'd take a Basilisk over a Dementor any day."
"Ossio dispersimus!" Draco yelled at the next dummy, for each of its arms, turning what would have been bones to limp jelly, then, "Serpensmorta!" Snakes came out from his wand and coiled around the dummy, its limp arms encircled and squeezed. As the fourth dummy fell under the pool of writhing snakes, Draco called, "Sectilis procella!" and darts of air shot out from his wand and impacted the fifth like tiny invisible arrows, leaving lacerations behind each strike. He let them keep hitting until the dummy was pecked to pieces.
Mother, if you come to our side, I can protect you. I've gotten a lot more powerful. It's not just my wand. I've learned a lot more spells, I've practiced a lot of things, and I've done a lot of things. I don't know what you've been told or what you think about the things I've already done, but I'm going to do more, and there's no stopping it. I've picked a side, and I'm going to fight for it. I'm not going to stop at anything. And my side is going to win. So I want you on the winning side.
"His cousin?" Riddle asked in mild surprise, and looked between them. "I suppose I can see the resemblance. Although you were a stranger to
"I'm serious," Draco said excitedly, "You'll regret it if you don't, Ron, I've got a surprise for you. One you'll like.
"When are you going to get," Sirius said roughly, shaking his shoulder, "That people value you for more than your power?" Draco opened his eyes, and Sirius looked downright annoyed, though Remus was giving him a look to calm down. "Seriously, Draco, it's getting old. Just because your self-esteem is shit-"
"Let you die with him, you mean?" Father whispered frantically in Draco's ear. "Do you still think I have chosen the wrong side?"
"It wasn't, we were just having a fight. Because- because he danced with Ginny Weasley." Severus let out a contemptuous snort. Draco glared at him weakly before going on. "While we were fighting, I saw Mother up on the tower, and thought she was Aunt Bella. But then I heard Mother cast Piertotum Locomotor, to activate the castle, and then the Dark Mark, and that seemed the signal for the Dementors to come. And the spell to bring the gargoyles to life brought down a lot more of the ruins... some of them hit Harry and knocked him out, but the charmed opal necklace Theo gave me for my birthday protected me..."
He stumbled and drew his clumsy leg against Harry's knee. Harry awoke to him with a smile. There was no accusation in those green eyes behind their clouded frames, not even when he noticed the direction of Draco's stare.
Draco had written this down in his notebook, finding the memory in his head with little difficulty. He remembered nearly every bitter word.
"Independently wealthy," Millie quipped, "So I wouldn't have to worry when my parents cut me off for having one. Otherwise, being around and interested when I'm a successful Keeper and can support us both. So, many years in the future, if ever." Millie flinched at Ginny's sad look. "What, don't look so pitying. I'm just a practical person."
There had been more than enough diamonds to melt, some of which Draco had the distinct impression he had seen on Aunt Bella in photographs. They were leaves and runes now, and the vines led to the drooping snowdrop at the center of the ring. The flower was a single moonstone, embellished with diamonds and carved into a delicate pronged shape, each petal hanging poised like dragonfly wings.
"Perhaps," Severus said, "Before swanning about playing the Dark Lord rising, you should have thought more about what you stand to
Either that, or he didn't have the strength or energy to repel the enthusiasm. When Draco clung to Severus's shoulders, telling himself he would not have been sent back in time if Severus was just meant to die again, he could feel the aftershock tremors of Cruciatus, still vibrating in random bursts down his back.
"Mail," Sirius announced, dropping two letters in front of Draco on the afternoon of the 27th. "Apparently letters have been going to Hogwarts for you. They can't find you here, the Fidelius and all. Minerva passed these on. One's from the Ministry, looks important."
"It comes down to choosing sides. And you chose. Severus. Fine. I always would have expected that. Personal attachment trumps objective feeling of debt. That's natural. I just never expected Severus and I to
"Knock it," Ron snapped, and then said more tentatively, "You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn't you?" Draco nodded.
He was already an old man then, but I still wanted to follow him. We only spoke once, and I-" Karkaroff looked sheepish, and wouldn't meet any of their gazes as he admitted, "I was full of dreams about the power he had, the power I could have if he rose back to what he had been and let me follow him, I- so, I- I offered to help him escape from Nurmengard."
would be his own preferred method of tackling the situation in the others' place, catching Draco unawares without having to break the locking charm on his curtains, and giving plausible deniability.
"Now, now, everyone, let's keep things sporting, shall we?" Madam Hooch said disapprovingly, and directed Flint and Wood to shake hands. It looked rather more like two orangutans trying to wrench each other's appendages off by the wrists.
"Daniel, I don't get it," said Dorian, bringing a glass. Dantanian didn't take it, sat back in a plush chair, in what was unmistakably Malfoy Manor. In time, this room would become Narcissa Malfoy's parlor.
The headline was nothing to do with the War. Draco couldn't remember the last time that had happened. Nothing about Muggleborn Registration or Death Eater attacks or Harry Potter sightings or the Dark Lord's threats. Only a smiling image of Gilderoy Lockhart triumphant over some great dead chimerical beast in the vast wild of what was labeled as Zanzibar- LOCKHART POPS POPOBAWA!
Draco pushed the door shut as quietly as he could. Then he rushed away from the tower, taking refuge in the closest section of castle that put a roof and walls around him. He grasped onto an unlit torch and felt his nails slide over the old wood and threaten splinters. He was more worried about getting glass in his other palm, as he forced down the draught of peace from his pocket.
. And, one had to concede, from the many maps Karkaroff had produced for them, it seemed that Nurmengard was at least a kilometer taller than L'Infern. No wonder he'd complained less about the altitude of his new hideout than its furniture. The mountain Dobby had taken them to was lower as well, with Nurmengard's great peak and its fortress rising into view before them like storm clouds massing and marring the remainder of the pure white sky.
Remus was astute enough to make that his first question as soon as he and Draco were alone. Harry was successfully banished to his room, with promises of a lengthy visit soon. Meanwhile, Sirius looked annoyed to be sent away once he'd been put to work taking Draco and Harry's bags up, but he was assuaged by a few lingering kisses, tromping off down the stairs to grouse good-naturedly at Kreacher. They both seemed to assume Draco would be more likely to confide in just Remus. "I haven't wanted to discuss this in our letters," Remus began, "For fear they would be intercepted, but I've asked Harry, when we speak by the mirror. Theodore Nott..."
"And there we have it," Draco said, "No more scary heights. If only all of the world's problems were so easy to solve." He yawned and stretched, getting to his feet, only to be met by a round of applause. The Weasleys and guests had made it to the box, and as seemed as pleased by his display of creativity as his mother seemed embarrassed.
"Cousin!" Luna exclaimed brightly, coming up from behind him to give him a hug. "Oh, isn't it marvelous! Do you think we're going to have a Very Harry Christmas?"
It began to rain outside, which had Draco's nerves on edge, but no Dementors showed up. Instead, they finished out him and Harry's first ever successful full trip to Hogwarts together, upon which Luna gave a rather embarrassing applause for the accomplishment. "Oh, but it is an accomplishment, Draco," she said, wide-eyed. "You're always wandering off such strange places."
"I know," Phineas gasped, overwhelmed. "And it seems that you know, Draco-" Draco held up a warning hand. "Heir to House Black. You know it all. But I- I have suffered for it-"
The fast approach of Valentine's Day alarmed Draco the most when it came to his charge at the citadel. As far as Draco was concerned, his number one priority on his excursions there, up to and including ensuring a successful evacuation of children from ravenous Death Eaters, was preventing one Gilderoy Lockhart from sending a Valentine.
She was already on the warpath. She'd marched up to the Gryffindor table, banning Harry from Hogsmeade, docking a massive number of points from Gryffindor, and giving another week of detention, which thankfully would end before Ron's birthday. And she put up her decree that anyone in possession of the Quibbler would be expelled, just like last time, but Draco had failed to appreciate before how counter-productive that was. Hermione said they couldn't have had better marketing if they put up a billboard in the Great Hall. That launched him into a minor panic over his Muggle Studies OWL prospects, from not knowing what a billboard was. But she proved to be right, as no less than fifteen students sidled up to their library table just that afternoon, asking if there were issues of the Quibbler they could borrow.
you trust me?" Draco finally asked, and Harry nodded. "Then can you stop insulting my hard-earned expertise in dark magic?"
The investigation of the Spanish Bruixots de Sang has uncovered a shocking twist in the saga of Gilderoy Lockhart: Mr. Lockhart is the
"It is a deal that you will find nowhere else in the world, kaktusblüte, and I ask for nothing in return, save you answer a few of my questions as well. I have privileged knowledge. Gleaned from Dantanian's coded journal, which I destroyed a century ago."
Gilderoy stepped up and kissed Seguinus eagerly, erotic fervor greater than any thirst for knowledge. Seguinus smirked against his mouth. He made Gilderoy draw back in alarm when he leaned his left hand behind himself, crouching and pulling Gilderoy with him, and drew his fingers once more over the water.
have its staff sneer at Ron, a furball that seemed to have it in for Scabbers as much as Egypt had. Draco hoped the feline would do in for Scabbers, and then maybe as a belated birthday present- Draco and Ron hadn't been speaking on his thirteenth birthday in March- Ron would allow to hook him up with a discreet luxury private dealer to secure a superior replacement.
be in my bed?" Draco drawled. "She'd have to fight for that, it's bound to be a heavily contested position." He tossed his head, and wished he'd had the time to comb his hair. Its wavy tangles spoiled the gesture's effect. The realization how bad his hair looked made him cast a nervous glance at Harry. It seemed the near-death of one of his best friends' fathers wasn't enough to stop Draco worrying what Harry thought of his hair. "Sirius and Remus will bring up mattresses for all of us, you'll see."
"It's brave of you to come out at such a young age," Mr. Granger asked seriously, seeming genuinely concerned for his welfare. "It has to have been difficult. Have you had issues with other students bullying you?"
He did try to think, though his sneezing and coughing and infernal headaches gave him only brief respites, for thinking about anything other than how miserable he was. Except he thought that when he wasn't in pain too. Draco had two major questions to answer, life and death questions: how to prevent the return of the Dark Lord, and what to do about Harry's feelings for him. The second had become a life or death situation once Draco heard Trelawney's prophecy.
"Give it to me," said Voldemort, and Draco handed it over. He suppressed a shiver as his palm brushed
"I know that. It's just when someone talks about them like that, I can't handle it, I get so angry- he said they'd be ashamed- and of you and
"Look," Severus hissed right in his ear from behind, a foul or fair spirit on his shoulder, driving him towards some fateful truth that Draco had to be strong to face. "Look into the water and see what it is you are so desperate to prove innocent
, Draco thought, the blue loop leaving him feeling like a seer, and was proud of himself for resisting the urge to show off and identify a second before Hagrid did. "Look there," said Hagrid, "See that stuff shinin' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery."
hold the sole key to a counter-curse. Is this the essence of your revenge? The desire to wholly and completely hold the power?"
At least Draco had tactics of his own, compromised as those were by his compulsive need to glance over at the red mass of the Gryffindor stands every few minutes to make sure Potter was still there watching. He also caught himself glancing over at the Malfoy Invincible banner, held up with pride in the Slytherin stands this match too. Draco's tactics had been caught between trying to catch the Snitch where he remembered, although that memory was vague- somewhere high in the clouds- and trying to stall to give Slytherin a chance to recoup some of the points. But the sight of the snake slaughterhouse unfolding made him realize that waiting was risking that rare situation where a Snitch catch was still not enough to win a match.
The real highlight of Durmstrang and Beauxbatons' arrival was the foreign food that the house elves had made, namely the French food. Draco went and got Luna after dinner was over, intending to go down to the kitchens to compliment Dobby on the bouillabaisse, but he was stopped dead by the sight of Karkaroff near the door. His gloves still on, he had stopped before one of the students, but not Draco: Potter.
He staggered over to regard his reflection, letting the half-empty bottle drop and roll away over the old stones. He surveyed the vision he would have made, taking measure in turn of what shape he show his next two times compelled to leave the Manor anytime soon- Severus and Vince's funerals. Where he might or might not see Potter, probably not at the first and definitely not at the second. It depended on whether that noble pity extended to Potter's least favorite professor.
." He tilted his chin up, hearing Severus's notes in his voice, and pretended he was a Dementor as he watched the light all drain from the Muggle's eyes. "Farewell, then. I do so hope to hear of an appropriately respectful treatment of Harry Potter. If not, rest assured that there are limits to the mercy of a Malfoy."
Malfoy born since the wand's creation. The first combination of his family's blood and Dorian Malfoy's- even if you are not either's direct descendent.
great Quidditch players at Hogwarts, Minister, so I have no reason to doubt their or your penetration of the game. Now, Mr. Bagman bet the opposite against him, but surely the Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports would not have the same instincts as real Quidditch players. Did you know I myself play Quidditch?"
"A menagerie is right," Dorian cooed smugly. "You think you know everything about your friend, don't you?" He ignored Dantanian's murmur of
Draco's insides clenched, some treacherous excitement already at Harry's touch, grabbing his hand the same way and leading him in the opposite direction. They ended up in the stands, in that place where Harry had used to hide to watch him. By the time Harry settled an unresisting Draco there, Ron and Hermione were fully gone.
"You don't have to," Draco said softly. "Ron and Hermione asleep? Don't worry. I can give you a calming draught, or a draught of peace. You know I have some for my anxiety..."
"Striker." The feeling of comfort as he buried his face in her thick bushy hair was bone-deep. "I'm sorry it's been so long, but Luna was telling me about what was going on with everyone-"
"What's going on?" Potter asked, eyes going to the wand in Draco's lap, and there was a spark to that brilliant green- the eyes were exactly the same- with intelligence that Draco didn't remember seeing so keenly the first time. "Are you here to get a wand too? Is that your new one?" He lowered his voice. "Is something wrong with it? I don't mean to pry. But the man who brought me, Hagrid, he knows all about Diagon Alley and Hogwarts- he's the groundskeeper- maybe he could help?"
Dobby appeared with Draco's godfather, in between the Death Eaters and their intended victim, and the newest and prettiest Death Eater let out his Head of House's name with utter shock. The appearance of Karkaroff at Dobby's other side, long missing and marked for death, seemed barely an afterthought for him or for those behind him. "Severus," Bellatrix breathed out, with hatred and wariness, while Theo stiffened like he had been caught cheating on a Defense essay.
father, to one who fails to provide the bare necessities for her education. Although by the look of this runt, any attempts at civilizing her would be a waste anyway-"
Severus laughed. It was startling enough to break Draco's concentration, turning to examine his godfather in alarm. Not that it was strange in itself for Severus to laugh, but this was no clipped, reprimanding laugh of derision, nor a sardonic reflection on the ridiculousness of existence. This was what Draco had heard so rarely from Severus: a genuine, whole-hearted chuckling and guffawing, deep from his diaphragm and soon shaking his stomach as it went on long and full-bodied, lips and black eyes both smiling. There was no restraint in it, no calculation, only a bright surprise, almost making him sound-
"Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore said, "Are you sure there was nothing else about the diary that alerted you to its true nature? I know this may be hard for you, but we must know everything possible in order to properly handle something as dangerous as I fear this diary may be."
"I know I should say thank you, for the time you spent training me in dueling. I used what you taught me, it kept me alive, so thank you..."
"Okay." Hermione pressed her wand between the letters, one by one. Nothing happened. "Should I be doing some spell?"
Hagrid proved just as much a sucker for large unpleasant-looking animals as expected. Hermione did the work talking Hagrid into accepting this stray into his care, but it wasn't much work at all. "He kin be friends wi' Fang," Hagrid said optimistically, while Draco went over and began to coo incoherently at Imoogi in her place of pride on the shelf, who he really should have been visiting more often. "Yeh foun' him in Hogsmeade, eh? I bin seein' him aroun' Hogwarts all year this term. Be glad to give this big fella a good home."
"You told me to do this," Draco said defensively, even though his hand was on the talon wand in his pocket, the counter-curse already on his lips at the sight of such a proud girl reduced to such a ridiculous setup. It reminded him of Hermione with a face full of hair from Mr. Wilberforth.
Draco peeled his face from Hermione's hair to peer down at Potter along with the rest of them, still taking hacking breaths while Lupin got out chocolate. There were snapping sounds that set Draco's spine on torturous pins and needles again. But it was just Lupin breaking the chocolate into pieces for them. It was a good remedy for the aftermath of Dementors, Draco remembered, though nobody had been rushing to pass out hot cocoa in Azkaban.
"I haven't been alone with him since, well, the mistletoe," Luna said, fidgeting. "I wouldn't know where to begin... maybe Hermione can speak to him..."
Harry would realize that everything he knew about Dumbledore, this virtuous public face he showed the world, had been built on the foundation of a lie. That the man who had fought the century's two Dark Lords, when no one else could, had also been part of their creation, not one but both. That Dumbledore was a Dark Lord himself, or as good as one, not just in power but in ruthlessness. Except something had gone wrong in that usual selfish script of power, and all that power had turned towards the maintenance of the status quo, the maintenance of his own appearance of blamelessness even while his hands were so covered in blood, Verniculpa might have no
"Steak sounds delicious." Harry smiled, his mouth watering at the thought of it. "Okay then we'll do steak." Draco smiled and looked over at the clock.
"It's quite crazy how everything played out." Draco yawned and caressed Harry's arm softly. "I would've never imagined to be laying here with you, no matter how bad I wanted it I could never imagine it actually happening" Draco chuckled.
Draco and Harry ended up having to push the trip back until school had finished. Narcissa made a full and speedy recovery, thankfully. They had disposed of Barty and Bellatrix properly.
"For all those years I convinced myself I hated you, but it's like from the day I turned down your handshake I knew there was something so intriguing about you" Harry said. Harry shook his head chuckling. "I couldn't shake the thought of you for the rest of that night, well for the rest of the year"
"you like that?" Draco mumbled into Harry's ear. Harry moaned in response. Draco began pumping faster, then just stopped all together. Harry whined and thrusted his hips, wanting more. "sh sh be patient" Draco grabbed the bottle he had carelessly tossed on the bed.
Draco looked up at the sky. "I wonder what time it is, we must get back to the dorm before dark." Harry looked up at him. "We are going back to the dorm bloke" Harry rolled his eyes playfully. Draco nudged him and continued walking. Harry walked silently, avoiding the looks he and Draco received once they entered the castle.
Harry shivered and moaned softly into Draco's ear. That sound sent a shiver down Draco's spine. The feel of Harry's warm shaky breaths on Draco's ear felt like heaven. Draco moved his mouth from Harry's earlobe down to his neck. His already marked neck. Draco smirked and went to the other side. He sucked one mark slowly and softly, circling his tongue around it. He bit the tender skin softly. He felt Harry's legs tighten around him.
Bellatrix had become a very close person to Harry. She gave him advice, she joked with him, and she was there for him. Harry and her had began to become friends, very good friends. He trusted her, he believed she was truly a changed woman.
"So want me to take care of that one too?" Hermione said and pointed her wand at Barty who was still very unconscious. "No. Let me do it" Draco kissed Harry's forehead and stood up. He pointed his wand down at the man and said the spell. The murderous spell. "That felt amazing" Draco straightened out his shirt.
They awoke the next morning at the same exact time, sort of odd but also a funny coincidence. Maybe a lovers connection, but who knows. Harry grabbed his glasses and yawned.
"Just because Harry isn't here doesn't mean you can't have some fun, we won't bite we promise" Ron smiled. Draco bit the inside of his cheek. Draco would go for a quick drink and be back in an hour. "Fine yes I'll go with you" Draco said.
"Okay?" Neville said nervously. "You know Blaise Zabini right?" Harry placed his head on the palm of his hand to hold it up. Neville's cheeks heated up and he smiled slightly. "Yeah I know him" Neville said obviously trying to sound stern. "Well, I've heard he's got a crush on you" Harry smirked.
Draco was on his way back to his room when he heard Harry. "Malfoy" Harry said. Draco was confused but turned back around and walked back into his room. "Yes Potter?" Draco said standing at his doorway. "I didn't like..grab you or anything right?" Harry said biting his lip nervously. The sight of Harry biting his lip made Draco absolutely lose it. "No potter you didn't grab me why would you even think that?" Draco said staring at him, lying once again.
"Thank you." Draco said softly and wrapped an arm around Harry's waist. Harry smiled up at him and placed his hands on Draco's chest. "You're welcome" Harry smiled. Draco placed a soft kiss on his lips. Harry kissed back and let himself melt into Draco's arms. "Now let's go I'm hungry" Draco said softly and let go of Harry. "What is up with our exes approaching us today?" Harry smiled. Draco shrugged and walked out of the bathroom.
"What is it you needed?" Draco continued looking forwards and walking to the Great Hall. Luna looked up at him. "The wrackspurts are gone, I see none around you lately" She said smiling. "Wrackspurts?" Draco shook his head and laughed. "They make your brain fuzzy, they go away with positive thoughts, you used to have a swarm of them" She looked around the hall.
"I was jealous. He was my boyfriend at the time, it wasn't an amazing feeling to read about you in his private journal." Ginny chewed nervously on her lip. She felt a little bad for being so rude, Harry looked happy.
Draco had tears streaming down his face once more. He could barely move, he was stuck. Harry didn't deserve what happened to him. Harry deserved the world. Draco tried to give it to him but failed.
He opened the envelope and began to read. He felt his heart drop and his legs go numb. His mouth ran dry and his head began to pound. His hands were shaking.
If Harry had been listening, he would've heard what Snape said which is just common knowledge. Amorentia smells like whoever you desire the most, someone you love.
The echoing sounds of moaning and their skin softly slapping were the only sounds to be heard. Harry felt Draco brush against his prostate causing Harry to moan. "I found your spot" Draco smirked and continued to hit it. Harry felt a knot form in his stomach.
"When do I get discarded from this god awful place. Believe it or not I miss the green" Harry smiled and rubbed his tired droopy eyes. "I knew you eventually would appreciate that amazing marvelous exquisite color" Draco smiled and caressed Harry's cheek softly.
He looked up at Draco, Draco nodded. "Well it's better if I just show you" Harry said softly and looked around making sure the classroom was completely empty. He unbuttoned his shirt. Snape felt compelled to look away.  Snape's mouth dropped once more when he saw Harry's bruised body.
When they finally pulled away, they lingered for a second. Then turned to look at the shocked faces staring back at them. Neville's cheeks went red once more, he looked down and twiddled his thumbs. Blaise cleared his throat. "Well that was long awaited" Blaise chuckled and wiped his mouth.
"It may not be the best time or place." Harry yelled over all of the commotion going on in the room. Draco was staring at Harry who he just noticed now had a shirt on. Lucius must have been so kind to put it back on. Anger bubbled up inside Draco, Lucius touched Harry. Lucius had to carry Harry, put his shirt back on. Draco sniffled slightly and turned his attention back to Harry. "But you must know I lo-" Harry was cut off.
"I'm not an evil person I promise I won't try to kill you again." Bellatrix offered a smile. Harry decided it would be best to not have any enemies this Christmas break so he decided to forgive her. "Okay, that's good to know" Harry said politely.
One spell did hit someone, a stupefy spell hit Narcissa. She fell unconscious. "Your own sister! You're evil!" Draco shouted at her.
Harry finished washing all of the dishes somehow. "May I be excused to my room" Harry said shakily. "Fine, you will be making breakfast tomorrow." His uncle dismissed him. Harry took his trunk and walked into the room under the stairs. He shut and latched the door. Harry flopped down onto the cot that was his bed. He cried. Harry sobbed, he felt weak. His side hurt more than he could even handle. Harry was trying to remember a numbing spell but nothing was coming to mind. Harry gasped for air and reached for his trunk. He opened it and sifted around for Draco's sweatshirt.
Although he had done it many times before, it still rattled him to run through a brick wall. His friends immediately spotted him and ran up to embrace him. He held in a wince, it hurt the bruises.
Draco went first. "Harry, I knew from the moment you walked into Hogwarts you were something special. It wasn't that you were 'golden boy'. It's that you were so shy, so reserved and timid. Yet so fiery and fierce.  I tried to deny the way I felt about you for years and I hated every second of it. Now I'm lucky enough to stand before you and marry you. Harry you are my forever, you are my home. You are the one and only love of my life." Draco finished speaking, his voice breaking a tiny bit towards the end. Harry was in full blown tears, crying with a smile plastered on his face.
"Wow okay you shouldn't have gone first, now I'm going to cry throughout mine" Harry chuckled and sniffled. Everyone there laughed as well. Harry wiped his eyes and nose.
Harry smiled and laid down on the floor he put his head in Draco's lap. Draco played with Harry's hair and kissed his forehead. "You will never be going back there." Draco said softly. Harry nodded and looked up at Draco. Draco leaned down and kissed Harry softly. Harry smiled and kissed back. "You are the reason I'm still here" Harry said getting up. "Where are you going?" Draco watched him.
those girls?" Draco said pushing on. "I- Of course" Harry said crossing his arms. "You seem rather nervous for you to be telling the truth Potter"
"Yes love we must. But for now I'm just happy you're alive and well" Draco kissed Harry's temple softly after pushing away a piece of hair that rested upon it. Harry smiled and any remaining pain in his body seemed to dissipate when Draco held him. Draco rested his head atop Harry's. Harry rested his head on Draco's chest and yawned.
Harry limped over to the shower and got in. "You know what I'm even sore" Harry smirked, teasing at Draco. "Your limp says otherwise" Draco chuckled looking at Harry through the glass shower door. "No limp, I'm fine" Harry pushed on as he washed himself and his hair.
Draco left three love bites along Harry's neck. Harry couldn't help but let out sweet soft moans at the feel of Draco's mouth and tongue on his neck. Draco licked over each mark he had made. Draco kissed back up Harry's jawline to reach his lips again. Draco kissed him hungrily. Harry kissed back just as eagerly.
"Where is it?" Harry looked around and down at Draco's empty hands. Draco got up and opened Harry's door. "Come on he's up" Harry looked out of the doorway, confused at who Draco was talking to.
Everything was so peaceful and gorgeous. It all felt so nice. It all felt so freeing. It all felt so perfect. Too perfect.
"Let's go pack alright?" Draco said softly into Harry's ear. Harry nodded and skipped away into his room. "I'm so excited Dray" Harry beamed and began packing his trunk. Draco followed Harry into his room. Draco flopped down onto Harry's bed and watched him pack.
"You have to come in with Snape, Lupin, and I. You know your home better than any of us. The rest shall stay on look out, and be back up in case we need it" Dumbledore motioned for Draco to come join them at the front. Draco took a deep breath and walked up.
Draco apparated them into their hotel room and smiled. "You are so beautiful fiancé." Draco kissed Harry's cheek. "Fiancé that has such a nice ring to it" Harry smiled and held Draco's face.
They both fell back to sleep. Comfortable in each other's arms. There was this silent anxiety Harry had, he constantly wondered how long this would last. The nude fragility that captivated Draco. He wondered when Draco would turn on him and build his walls back up.
"As most of you have seen or heard, Harry Potter has been wounded deeply. I am telling you all this just to let you know, there is no threat. Do not be afraid of another attack. The person who did this to Harry had been taken care of accordingly" Dumbledore cleared his throat. The students were all staring up at the front of the hall attentively.
"Yes, it is" Draco said chuckling. "Would you care for some lunch or not?" Draco said looking at him. Harry was rather hungry, his stomach felt empty. So did his head. Harry grumbled and shook his head. He wanted to sleep, starve. Draco tilted his head a little. "You sure you're not a little famished?" Draco moved a piece of hair off of Harry's forehead.
Ron and Hermione had completely different looks on their faces. Hermione was smiling and swooning over this new found love between Harry and Draco. Ron was shocked that Draco could care for anyone but himself. Nonetheless they were both thrilled for their best friend.
Draco's heart fluttered. Although he was also worried sick. He dropped his eyes to Harry who had fallen asleep surprisingly quickly. Draco smiled. If Harry went home to his family, Draco was afraid he might re-start his bad habit. He wanted to do anything he could to keep Harry safe, happy, and satisfied. Draco's mind was buzzing with awful thoughts. All of the loud voices overlapping each other. It gave him a headache.
"Oh shut up" Harry hit Draco's chest and rolled his eyes playfully. "I must see this journal sometime." Draco smiled and proceeded to walk down the hall. Harry followed him. "Never."
"Blaise" Harry smiled and hugged him. He was barely in control of what he was doing. The only thing circling his mind was Blaise. A feeling of emptiness clouded his heart, remembering someone, he couldn't recall who. "Class is over, we missed the rest of it" Blaise said stroking Harry's hair. "Alright Blaise" Harry was lost in his eyes, just staring up at him from the bathroom floor.
It had taken five months to plan out every detail until everything was finally perfect enough for the both of them.
Harry turned and walked over to the Slytherin table. The Slytherin Table, Harry thought. He walked straight and proudly, confidently. He wasn't any of those things.
Draco looked back over at Harry who was now on the complete opposite side of the bed. Draco needed to kiss, to touch Harry. He needed that moment back. He also didn't want it to be rushed. "It was an intrusion" Draco said catching Harry's attention.
"That should be all" Harry smiled and finished putting the items in his trunk. Draco closed his wardrobe and walked over to Harry. Harry got into his bed and pulled the covers up over himself. Draco smiled and got in as well. Harry moved close to him, completely wrapping himself around Draco. Draco smiled it was almost as if Harry was trying to merge them. "I'll really miss you" Harry mumbled.
