“No I didn’t,” Malfoy said, then rolled his eyes. “Here, let me.”
Lydia choked on her tea. “Grandfather! You can’t say things like that!”
Draco nodded and gave him a wan smile, trying to tune back into the conversation.
They were sitting on a bench, now. Luna was chatting with some old man with a three pointed beard.
“It’s a reverse custody battle. The Manor wants to go to me, and is obeying Lucius’s will in ways that harm me in order to show me that. Basically, the Manor’s breaking a dish while washing it in order to get out of doing chores,” Draco took Hermione’s confused look as a cue to shove more noodles into his mouth.
Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil had been spotted circling Potter, and it was rumored twice they were involved in some sort of threesome scheme.
“You may try them on, if you are sure. But I don’t think you should be one to wear another man’s castoffs, Mr. Potter.”
“I dunno. Maybe I will bother him. But he seemed really upset when he ran away. I just hope he doesn’t feel like he has to hide from me. I hope he’s just taking time for himself, honestly. Because I know if I wasn’t here talking about my feelings to my dog and an invisible audience for half an hour straight every day I’d be working myself up into hysterics out in the garden. I’d have destroyed half my crops from overweeding.
“Hi, Harry,” she said. “Been awhile, hasn’t it?”
Draco watched her leave.
“I said, what do you want, Malfoy?” Potter said, wrenching Draco out of the daydream. “Are you okay? You’ve gone all pink and flushed,”
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy blinked and came back to life. “We found you shut in the cupboard under the bench last night, around eight o’clock. Your shoulder is dislocated, and you’ve broken your ankle and three of the fingers on your right hand, probably from the weight of your body being pressed into the small space, and then you put more stress on your body by moving around and trying to escape. So we’ve immobilized you, but we don’t have any higher-grade potions like skelegro,”
“I have no idea, Potter,” Draco started, much too quickly. “But if you’d come upstairs I’ve made some coffee for you, and we can discuss how to prevent anyone from finding you ever again,”
Draco took a long sip of his coffee. It tasted rushed. Of course, that could just be the smell of piss seeping into his daily life.
3. Not much research has been done on ‘matched’ patroni, where two people produce a male/female animal pair (ex. Doe and stag, bull and cow), but in the few cases studied, the couples had been married for over half a century.
“If you will remove your clothes and take a step onto the platform, I can begin with the tailoring,”
Merlin-curse-it, Potter. Where are you?
Kind soul, Potter was.
“Indeed, Stella. Quite unsatisfyingly tepid. You’ve a nice vocabulary for a dog,”
“Don’t be a little shit, Harry,” She said, and Harry put the dough in the oven to pre-bake then turned around to look at her. “I’m happy to see you. You’ll make a pizza and then we’ll find Malfoy, yeah?”
“I will not pretend you are here to apologize or to explain yourself,”
The tears ran down his cheeks and down his neck at a weird angle and he couldn’t do anything to wipe them away, to dignify himself. He might stay like this forever.
He heard a sharp intake of noise from Malfoy, but when Harry looked over at him, he looked just as fast asleep as before.
“It’s Saturday,” Potter said, like it answered everything.
That’s when Draco knew he was losing. He drew away, though every irrational bone in his body (he had about 200 of them) begged him not to.
Okay, that might have been a bit dramatic.
they said.
He ended the floo on Junior Auror Ronald Weasley’s surprised face. One would think he’d never been thanked for a service before. Granger was obviously slacking.
The words came out all at once: “I’m sorry for lying to you,”
“Yeah. Friends don’t keep track of favoring. Favors given sought are good, but given unsought are better, and all that,”
Draco looked at his father. He looked old, much older than his nearly fifty years. Age was in Lucius’s hair, once white-blond now lacking the blond. It was in his tarnished silver eyes and the wrinkles around them. It was in his shoulders, once proud, now drawn together like magnets. His scraggly nails pushed into Draco’s arm insistently, and Draco had no choice but to grant his father soft, pitying, eye contact.
He checked the time. How bloody long would it take for Potter to apparate some creeper to London and back? He was the most powerful wizard in the fucking world. Draco took an annoyed sip, then let it swish around his mouth.
“Even that would be generous,” Pansy remarked. “Firewhiskey?” She asked, gliding toward the sparse kitchen area.
The third letter was a detailed drawing of an arsehole. An arrow pointed to it. The arrow was labeled ‘you.’
And the arse–
“I did want to see you and all, but I’m actually helping Draco with the legal mess the Ministry has planted on him. I discovered something important that complicates this whole case so I flooed him, but he wasn’t in. Then I remembered you live around here and I came to ask you where he might be,”
“Harry! We nearabout thought you had skipped down without saying goodbye!”
Malfoy ducked back down, the tips of his ears burning red. “You have a wand. Do it yourself.”
The ancient house-elf greeted him.
“Kitchen walls too obvious?” She cocked her head and narrowed her eyes.
He tried the door behind him. Locked.
“Yes, please.”
The Manor was a maze of a place. When he was younger, Draco’d always had a knack for getting from one room to the next and had known all the right words to make his favorite rooms appear.
“Where is he?” Potter interrupted.
“...I can’t be alone for a second without thinking of him by accident. And that’s rough when you don’t have many people to talk to besides yourself. It’s just...this whole thing has gotten me rather fucked up, I think.” He paused, feeling a revelation coming.
They looked up guiltily. Probably in cahoots with Malfoy. He’d imperiursed them or something. Or even worse, they were helping him
People kept talking about raccoons in conjunction with him, too, which was frightening, since Harry still didn’t know what exactly Arnie had to do with raccoons. He hoped it was benign, but he strongly suspected it was questionable at best.
Draco laughed. “I don’t think that’s a real phrase,”
Malfoy glanced up at the music again, and he again shifted into a lighter tone. Harry watched his eyes. They looked up at the music, then down to his hands but Harry could see that he wasn’t really looking at his hands, he was going into a softly focused trance. His eyes were merely monitoring his hands, not controlling them.
Malfoy had moved to reclining on the clothing rack sometime during all of this. “Surely we’ve exhausted the rainbow? Honestly, Potter, they all look good. Just pick one,” he said, waving his elegant hands like an aristocrat.
Campbell’s gaze turned firm. “You’re staying.”
“Not this part,” he said. He started to summon the ingredients, but Hermione looked a little helpless at the sight of random vegetables flying out of cabinets. He took pity on her. “I have some sauce in the fridge. It’s the red jar labeled ‘sauce.’ There’s also some cheese in a bag.”
“Call me Hermione,” she said, “And if you’re going to apologize, please do it in writing so I can frame it. Owl me at, well, tell the owl to go to my office. I don’t have time for apologies today. You’re trying to stop the re-inspection?”
Draco set his coffee down. “Did you know Harry Potter lives here?”
“Harry, if you could give us a moment? I have some sensitive information to share, and client confidentiality and all that.”
A sharp knock on the front door had Draco scrabbling for his wand. Luckily, it was in his back pocket. In his
“Point in check. Let’s go to bed, yeah?”
Draco wanted those strong arms to lift him and pin him to whatever vertical or horizontal surface was near (preferably vertical, actually) and snog him until he couldn’t breathe. He wanted to run his hands along those arms as they tensed, to make them relax under his touch. He wanted to thread his fingers through that curly black mass of hair, to wrap a strand around his finger, feel him shiver as Draco knotted his fingers into it. Then he would lean in and kiss Draco’s neck, but Draco pulled his hair to feel him gasp, so that maybe Draco could turn his head to the side and breathe in the sweet smell of his breath. Draco would tilt his head closer, then, and mash their lips together like how the river meets the sea. They’d melt together, find a bit of a rhythm, but just until Draco would feel the erection pressing into his thigh. And of course, Draco wouldn’t want to keep him waiting, so–
Narcissa contemplated this revelation, causing a shadow of sudden age to fall over her face. “
“...And it’s just a piece for beginners,” Draco was saying as he walked toward Harry to collect the folder. “The real arrangement is much more difficult. This was not only abridged, but also simplified. So it really wasn’t all that impressive,”
The corner of Elise’s mouth lifted. “Come again?”
But Potter wasn’t shagging his friends; of that Draco was certain. There were no telltale bruises, no crumpled clothes. And when he wanted to, Potter could hide. He had that damned invisibility cloak, for one, and probably a lifetime supply of polyjuice from his numerous contacts.
But Potter was taking him down the street, not back up to his shop.
Draco ended the piece like it began, slowly. But there was a resolution and finality to the music as it laid the dragons back into their original places. Draco struck the last chord and let his hands hang above the keys. The engraved dragons froze, just as lifeless as before. Draco was breathing hard, cheeks flushed, little beads of sweat at his temples. He turned from the keys to Harry, eyes bright and a grin forming.
“I can’t believe I’m having this discussion with you. I’m not going to hook up, or date, or, or, or do anything with Potter. It’s not happening,”
He hated to think about how quickly the Manor could be manipulated. Draco hadn’t been there in a few weeks and suddenly Lucius’s mistaken thoughts had corrupted it.
Simple and sweet arabica, but with honey. Most people preferred sugar, but Draco liked the dissonance. It gave him a focus in tasting.
But it’s not like many people came to visit, and those who did didn’t mind the dirt. Or the dog. Or the slightly warmer-than-necessary temperature. Or the furniture that didn’t match. Or Harry.
Had he grown? Maybe Potter had taken up a penchant for outdoorsy work. Draco looked at his own pale, skinny arms in the mirror. Maybe Potter had a beard. Maybe it would look good on him, be neatly groomed. Or maybe, Draco reminded himself, Potter has the nasty sort of moustache that catches little bits of food in it. Potter is probably absurdly out of shape, can barely move from the couch. Or better yet, disturbingly skinny. Skeletal, matter of fact. He was definitely wearing the same broken wire-framed glasses from first year. Definitely. And Potter has halitosis, foot fungus, and all sorts of infections. Draco would be doing him a favor by showing up to his door.
Hermione had also been with him for the Malfoys. It was Lucius first and Harry had testified against him. Lucius om trial was all glib tongue and excuses, and Harry’s testimony prevented any of them from taking root. He had gotten life in prison, possibility of permanent house arrest if conditions necessitated. Ron had said it was lenient, then, and now Harry was wont to agree with him.
“Last night I received an owl–“
Draco took a sip of his coffee.
“Which is, of course, true, because old bones like the Manor soak up magic like… like…”
She nodded, then turned to lead them down the hall, most likely to the sun parlor. Potter followed with little coaxing, thankfully.
His hands traced over the note penned on the inside of the front cover. He read the words out loud.
Draco reached down to hold Potter’s hand, give it a reassuring squeeze or something, but Potter beat him to it. He felt a warm calloused hand clasp over his own and became painfully aware of how slender and soft his own hand was. But after Potter had released it, Draco felt a strange sense of loss.
“You really need to stop adopting random people off the street, dear,”
A rise of emotion grew in Draco. He wanted the man from the radio to seek reparations with his friends, to get back to the life he should be living.
“Did ya get this from the trash? It looks like it was thrown outta a back window somewhere,” The man at the radio store said.
“We’re not dealing with a simple purging of Dark magic. The only reason there’s Dark influence is because Lucius is still technically the master of the manor,” he said.
So he’d have to make a plan. But it wasn’t up to him. His savior complex, or whatever.
Elise nodded and Harry didn’t like the knowing glint in her eye at all. “He’s right in there. Ask him yourself,” she said, stepping back so Harry could see Malfoy, currently sorting through what appeared to be at least a hundred books.
The back page of the catalogue stared at him. Draco
“No! No, no. Please don’t. It’s probably best if… if it is who I’m thinking of, he doesn’t know I’m here. We aren’t…” He flashed a weak smile. “On the best of terms. Oh, look at that!” He ran several metres to his storefront. “I’m here. Er, goodbye. Thank you,”
Luna laid a hand on his shoulder. “I’m the only non-muggle he’s seen in the last year. Since he’s disappeared. Draco-”
The muggle radio and his gripes with the ministry and the prophet disapparated as Draco begun the process of cleaning up the empty store.
“Shit, I forgot,” Malfoy said. “Where are they? Here, I’ll put them on you,” He started searching around the bed with his hands.
You can’t control us just by thinking, pissbaby, they said.
“Oh yes, and I was flipping through it a bit downstairs!” Elise said.
Draco looked up.
But it felt less lonely when you had someone who you knew you could go back to.
“‘Yes, of course, Potter, I’m not trying to murder you. I’m only trying to ask for your help’
Horribly and strangely domestic, the lot of it.
“You just had to team him how to cook a squash, and you just had to borrow his old annotated book,”
“It’s your fault, innit? You’re the one who mentioned Harry,” Campbell responded.
A chill ran up and down his spine.
Then he had asked Harry for supper and Harry couldn’t well say no, could he?
“And I loved to see it in him. But all that’s probably over now. I’ve gone and messed everything up, I think. Not what I did, okay, maybe what I did, but I don’t understand why he did what he did, and instead of talking about it, I ran away. Instead of matching his energy in the moment, I should have taken time to think clearly and stayed,” That’s something he and Angie had talked about, back when they still did in-person sessions together. Deescalation. Calming techniques. “Except I didn’t,” He sighed. “So fat lot of good knowing that does me now.” Bitterness was okay. It was okay to be bitter and regretful and sad. As long as it didn’t prevent him from doing the best thing, in the end.
“What school was that?” A room-filling voice from behind them asked.
“One more thing,” Harry said, watching Malfoy’s head jerk up like he was asking the ceiling for strength. “Can you turn the piano around? I want to be able to see you,”
“Hullo, Harry,” Lydia said, sounding simultaneously surprised and unsurprised (a talent of hers). “Want a cuppa?”
“–still in London. Holed up in an expensive wizarding neighborhood accessed through the basement egress window well of number 34 Tite Street, Chelsea. He was kind enough to agree to apparate you there.” Potter finished. He broke eye contact to give Draco the sort of look that tells the other person to get out of here or there’s going to be trouble for you.
Depends on what? Aren’t radio shows supposed to be more or less
Draco muttered,”The Death Eater shit will never be over,”
Draco looked up at her ceiling. It was white, like most ceilings and had none of the unseemly speckling he sometimes saw in newly renovated flats like hers. “You said my favorite magazine?”
“I just want to talk to him, you know? First I’ll tell him I’m sorry, then I’ll demand an apology. I’ll be like hey, Posh Spice, sorry, but you gotta pull your own weight, too. Maybe some of it’s my fault, but certainly not all of it. I was doing what I thought was best, what I thought we wanted, but I might have read things wrong. I do know that you certainly reacted wrong, and I do know that I can’t control you. Woah, when did this get so direct? Sorry guys, that was probably intense,” he said, laughing a little at himself. “What can I say? I’ve found a passion for something other than my dog and my vegetables.
He laughed again, but it was tuneless this time. The radio host was making jokes out of habit.
She rolled her eyes. “You’re going to have to try again, and you’re going to have to keep trying. If I know Harry, which I like to think I do, he’ll get bored of turning you away and will eventually listen to what you have to say. And he may not agree with your case, but he testified for you and your mother once, and I have reason to believe he’ll do it again,”
But her hands were already moving, waving the object Harry could now see was a small glass orange bottle under Malfoy’s nose.
He turned down the volume slightly and laid back on the couch, staring at the ceiling.
Malfoy scoffed and stood. “My piano tutor was a Russian. If I’d asked him to teach me chopsticks he would probably have jumped in front of the nearest train,” he said, walking over to the piano to lift the hood.
Harry heard the door slam and Dracco’s footsteps travel down the hall, probably with a dark look on his face and determination in his eyes. Harry knew the look. Narcissa remained in the room, and Harry could imagine her standing in the center, watching the air where her son had just stood, openmouthed. Or maybe she was sitting in a sturdy and expensive chair, stern and imperial, waiting for her son to come back and apologize.
Malfoy looked on him with disgust. “Because I have class, Potter,”
Harry fixed his eyes on the door and started to count.
He went back into the kitchen and made another cup of coffee. Draco’s hands were shaking. Really, all this just because of a made-up scenario? Potter was probably fine. Lucius had absolutely nothing to do with it. Still, he couldn’t shake this feeling…
The device was obviously the muggle version of a radio. It also showed the time. Or at least he assumed it would once it was fixed. Draco tinkered with the contraption for the two hours until lunch, then skipped lunch and tinkered more. It wasn’t like he could really buy anything anyways. There wasn’t a Gringotts in Merlin’s Armpit, Scotland where he could exchange his galleons for pounds and ounces or whatever.
“They will not find her,” Lucius said, and it sounded like a command. “Go hide yourself, son. I do not care to be ashamed today.”
Harry waited for the door to close behind her, then said, “What’s this about, then?”
“No, it’s fine,” Harry said, leaning his head on his hand. “Did you know he plays piano?”
“And will this get him to leave me alone?”
Draco didn’t quite know what to make of the exchange. From their tones, he wasn’t sure if the insults were backed by amity or enmity.
If Draco was a rapidly aging man in dire need of a mind healer, the entire house’s magic under his control, and a penchant for drama, where would he be?
“Friends?” Draco echoed, not sure if he heard Potter right.
He opened the book. A small note was written on the inside cover.
Luna made a small skeptical, yet encouraging sound.
Draco tried to shoot Potter a glare of pure potential murder, but the blasted man was making direct eye contact with Mr Ager. Honestly, some people think performing a spell correctly is more valuable than looking at Draco. How rude.
“Haven’t heard from the poor dear nigh on two days now!” Elise said.
“Right,” she said, looking a little dazed. “I’ll just get to that. I’ll meet you here tomorrow?”
Lydia knew what he meant. Lydia was, after all, a Hufflepuff at her core. “I’m so sorry. You must feel terribly confused, right now. I would bet he’s feeling the same way. You’ll find each other again after you’ve both had some space, don’t worry,”
Malfoy bent down to pick up a few articles of clothing from a small duffel bag and held them against himself, frowning slightly. He was mumbling something to himself, Harry realized.
The floo rang, stirring Draco from his thoughts. It was Mr. Magnanimous, Junior Auror Weasley.
“No, it’s pretty small. Hey, you’re an auror now, right? That must be interesting,”
Narcissa’s voice faded back into his consciousness. “I do warn you, though, if you break his heart, he will not hesitate to destroy you, Savior and life-debt or not. Do you understand?”
“I know, it wasn’t my best broadcast. I just had to get some things out there, you know? Of course you do. You’re very wise.”
“Damn, mate. You look you got dry-humped by a ghost!”
He thought about lifting the fallboard, what it would be like to press his fingers down on the keys, hear the sharpness of a note chosen at random and played without musicality. There wouldn’t have to be an art to it; only crude mechanics. Raise his arm, slide the sheet of wood into the piano, move his arm back, let it fall on the black or white ivory.
No response.
“Rude,”
The baker was an older gentleman by the name of Victor. His mouth twitched as the couple approached until finally it broke into a blatant smile, white teeth shining against dark skin.
Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, forty-two…
Harry felt a bit foolish. Here he had been, smelling rats and forming conspiracies when all the Mums had been doing was helping their new stray find a book. And knowing his dislike for Malfoy, they hadn’t wanted to upset him. He was about to reel in the extendable ears when something Campbell said piqued his notice:
“Of course!” Malfoy said. “I’d forgotten that was today. Thank you, Luna,”
She didn’t budge. Harry gave her a half-smile. “Alright, Malfoy,” he corrected. “Let’s put her in the oven and go find Malfoy.”
Draco descended a staircase at high speed looking down at his feet. He didn’t notice the footsteps behind him.
And Draco was going to do anything to make sure that didn’t happen.
“They’re just as ivory as the white ones, there. And the white ones are just as ivory as your hair, Drasha. The name is just as good as the thing itself, no?” he had said.
“They’re down, Potter. But they’ll be bricks if you pull another stunt like that,”
“Sounds like he’s being a real pain,” Harry jumped in.
She turned to him, and either to her credit or discredit depending on how Harry would choose to interpret her last comment, looked completely unsurprised and a little bored.
“Finding me?” Potter repeated, and Draco knew he had said something wrong. “Nobody finds me accidentally, Malfoy. I hid myself. There are no connections to me here. No one–”
Malfoy turned to him, eyes turned a steely, cold grey. “Chopsticks?”
“Study, study, study,” he muttered in a sing-song sort of way. He turned onto a hallway he didn’t recognize and slowed.
“I’m so sorry about her,” He said, pulling a treat from his pocket and crouching down. “She does this homeless attention seeking act.” The dog bounded into Potter’s arms. “Dunno why, she gets more’n enough attention at home.”
The conversation drifted to other topics, to tea and coffee, to the French Alps, to journalism, to ballet.
A pile of letters greeted him on the floor of the shop. Draco banished them upstairs. He sighed, then conjured a gallon of vinegar and a dust mask.
He sat down on the sofa and began to read. Potter would have to wake up eventually, wouldn't he? In the meantime, Draco could do something productive for once.
Draco let her explanations fade into the background. Some hours later, he said goodbye. Then he packed up his belongings for the night and walked over to Campbell and Elise’s. He listened to the radio man, then fell asleep. The day had been long and he didn’t plan on having another one like it for quite some time.
It’s not like there’s much to do in a small town besides work and eat, and eat to work, and work to eat. And any other possible combination of those two words. They were big words, when you got down to it, Harry thought, rinsing vegetables. They encompassed the universal human experience. Work. Eat. Harry’d done that since birth and would continue to do it until the day he died.
I'm on fall break rn so expect the next chapter by next sunday!
“About two and a half months now, since the day after I met him in the street by accident,” Potter said, and Draco relaxed.
“Now that you mention it, yes,” she said, and then a fire lit in her eyes. “It’s atrocious that every intelligent witch or wizard is expected to work for the government! You remember when we had to do career planning at Hogwarts? Whenever someone mentioned entrepreneurship or higher education by way of independent study or apprenticeship, they tried to talk us out of it. Entrepreneurship was too plebeian, higher education was too expensive, and if you became an apprentice you’d be destined for some sort of lonely life of solitude. What the Wizarding world needs is more powerful, intelligent, and organized opposition to government rule! Do we even have government parties?”
“Afraid it still smells like that,”
You are formally invited to the 19th annual Christmas in July party (or informally if that floats your boat)
Just as he had been getting the hang of living on his own Potter was going to be killed on Draco’s card. They’d have to throw him in Azkaban now.
He shook his head. No, now was not the time. Potter was probably just signing autographs or had visited a Tesco to buy some grapefruit or something. Nothing to be worried about. But still, Draco’s heart beat in his ears. He took a sip of his coffee.
“We can’t just keep him here, though,” Malfoy was saying.
“No, no, you don’t have to, I assure you,” Draco protested, weakly.
The next day was much the same, except Lydia stopped by. They had a lovely conversation about the properties of newt’s eyes and the possible more humane substitution of mustard seed.
Malfoy made an expression like someone had shoved dung under his nose. “Kindly call back your animal. We have an appointment,”
“And Blacks know how to tell the truth.” he finished. It was something his mother had told him time and time again, so long as his father wasn’t in the room. It was their little secret, their little mantra. It had given his mother hope for restitution in darker times.
Malfoy had decided on a dark blue jumper and was holding it up in front of the mirror. The color matched his skin well and highlighted the shine of his hair. Hair which, Harry noticed with a bit of a smile, was currently sticking up in several different directions. It was a far cry from the stiff, gelled style he had worn it in when they were younger. Malfoy ran a hand through it, scattering the dust particles in the light. He looked good, Harry realized. Malfoy hadn’t done too badly for himself these past three years.
He’d been a fool to think an invitation from his mother could be anything but trouble.
“Of course,” she said. “Tall, built like a strong breeze would blow him away but also like some Victorian poet’s muse. Blond,” she turned around to look at Harry. “Should I not have added the Victorian poet bit?”
God, Kreacher. Harry hadn’t thought about him in damn near sixth months, thank God or Merlin or Angie or whoever. Kreacher had been the last of those fraying strings tying him to London.
Pansy passed him the bottle with a roll of her eyes and a huff. He took a rather large swig. Draco was beginning to get worried.
The Supreme Mugwump tapped his wand to end the session and Draco realized he hadn’t listened to any of it. Shit.
Twelfth Night. William Shakespeare. D. Malfoy on the bottom.
Draco raised an eyebrow and the hint of a smile graced his face. “I didn’t know you watched muggle movies,”
He finished the little waterfalls of notes, then with a slight bowing of his head and pursing of his lips fell into the next section, a combination of the two he had just played. It was dark, deep, but used the melody he recognized from the lighter section.
“Malfoy!” A familiar green-cast ginger opened.
Ten, eleven, twelve…
“I’ll leave you to it, then,” he said, sliding away from Harry and back into his floating piles of research.
Pansy was, of course, very smug about the whole ordeal. She slunk against the folding chair, gazing at the collage of Potter’s love life. “I see you found the articles interesting?”
That’s exactly how long Malfoy’s limit is. Harry took that information and filed it for further notice. He’d have to gather more data.
“Potter…” Draco started, but he didn’t know how to end it so it sounds right. “People shouldn’t treat you like that,”
“Pity,” Potter said, a bit of a smirk pulling at his lips. “That’d be a fun game. But who would I be making bets with, exactly? The piano?”
Draco jumped to knock his hand away. “Don’t touch that!”
He whirled around, which was quite difficult to do with one foot on one step and the other on another.
Potter mouthed ‘sneewitchen mirror’ unconsciously, like he was committing the story to memory. Shame.
Draco sighed and nearly incinerated the paper, then thought better of it. He needed a physical copy to threaten Weasley with. Instead, he simply set it on the table. It was an ugly folding card table, one of the four pieces of furniture
this was a super fun chapter to write!! thanks for sticking with this. keep in mind this is a wip, but i'll try not to be so obnoxious about the next installment. junior year is wildin.
Black was classic, Draco supposed. Or Snape-like. Black also wasn’t a remarkable match to the emerald green of Potter’s robes.
“Funny things, telescopes,”
Harry had let out a deep breath and reached over to close Kreacher’s eyes, but his eyelids were stiff and cold.
“No, why?”
“Just so you know, I don’t blame you for what you did. During the war, I mean. Well, during the war I did, but then I realized I would have done the same thing when I was seventeen and in your position, all my family threatened and supporting
“Session begins,” The Supreme Mugwump said, and the crashing hum of a tumultuous discussion ensued.
Harry sat in the overstuffed armchair from the Gryffindor common room, Stella at his feet, and unshrunk the book he had stolen that morning.
Such actions were petulant and below him, but Draco didn’t really care. It was five o’clock in the afternoon and Mr. Ager was in for it.
But Harry couldn’t believe his ears were registering Malfoy’s French voice. It was clearly Malfoy, but there was an elegant roughness to it not captured in his posh Wiltshire English. Harry tried to find the secret for Malfoy’s duality in his mouth, but all he saw was the smiling corners of Malfoy’s lips and the hint of white teeth every so often. Malfoy’s nose was the same angular Roman nose as always, but his nostrils were raised slightly.
Harry nodded. “Thought as much. And I’m stuck here so the ministry doesn’t paint you as a dangerous criminal?”
After all, his note had only read: bring me food and I will share a secret with you. Hint: I know how to solve our case
Draco picked up George’s list of stations.
Then the back turned around to front and the illusion was broken.
He wasn’t coming back. Harry must have made a mistake. But God, if all mistakes were like this he’d make them over and over and over until he beat the odds and got it right.
They worked through the afternoon like that as well, Draco silently pouring through papers, Harry silently watching him, and Narcissa silently embroidering and observing.
Harry wet his tongue. “Can’t imagine either of us intended to still be here.”
“Darling,” she added, running a hand through her normally stick-straight and glossy bob.
“Having a nice reverie, Potter?” Malfoy’s snide voice jerked him out of the recollection.
Draco lunged forward and grabbed the doorknob. He stuck his tongue out at the offended hippogriffs. He’d never liked them all that much. Rude creatures.
Elise started, a ripple passing through her halo of grey hair. She shot a glance at Campbell, a glance that was returned with a slight widening of the eyes. It definitely meant something. Glances like those were always the equivalent of a two-hour verbal discussion. Problem is, Draco didn’t know what something it meant.
He was still in the music room, and he was in the bay window. But the bench had been extended somewhat to act as a bed. That was fine, that was okay. He hadn’t had the time to truly look at anything in the room, before. The boards, the place where the wall meets the ceiling, those were nice. They were ornate. They had little creatures carved into the corners, but Harry couldn’t tell what they were.
It had probably been trained out of him when he was young. Harry amused himself for several moments imagining Narcissa Malfoy telling a platinum-haired toddler that ‘pure-blooded gentlemen do not use the shitter, they instead banish it from their bowels before it has the chance to breach the surface.’
A curious look came over Potter then, starting somewhere deep in those eyes of his and pooling out to the rest of his face, turning it into an impish grin. “You think I’m pretty?”
He had four and a half hours before he had to avoid Lucius.
Elise yelled a gracious ‘you’re welcome’ from her studio. Campbell gave him a salute over her cup –Draco was pleased to see– of coffee.
“Would you mind brewing this young man some tea? I have a radio to fix.”
If Malfoy wanted to fake-date, sure. He had just better be prepared for Harry. What is it that boy at the club had said? Oh, yes. Harry had a dominating sort of personality.
It was morning and Harry was gardening. As per usual. His little pear tree was doing quite well, and he was nearly ready to remove most of the stabilising charms around it. It was only a year-old sapling, so there wouldn’t be any fruit for the next few years. But Harry still carefully checked each blossom to make sure there weren’t any parasites or otherwise unwanted organisms.
“I feel like we should set up some boundaries or something…”
George nodded and made his way to the back door. He opened it to a garden that was modest and could be quite productive, actually, but was rife with weeds.
He walked towards it, but a glint to his left demanded his attention. He turned to see a row of flutes suspended in the air. He reached over to grab the first one, then thought better of it. It was tempting, though. Something about the golden and silver was so inviting, so graspable.
“Oh, one of those days, is it?”
He reread Draco’s copy of Twelfth Night the next day.
Malfoy’s brow furrowed, but he didn’t look at Harry. “You play?”
Draco showed up at Potter’s house at ten-twenty precisely again the next day. He milled about on the stairs, made a general inconvenience of himself, then left.
Or the yellow.
Draco’s ears started ringing, and he struggled against the force dragging him down the hall. He looked up at Lucius, but the old man was gazing emptily into a floral painting hanging on the wall.
He made an effort to smile. It didn’t work. “There’s these older women who’ve adopted me, sort of. And the granddaughter of the electronic repairman,”
She sighed. Ever since she cleaned up that paper article Hermione had become especially militant about homophobic remarks from Ron, other Weasleys, and the entire population of the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, Harry was included in the entire population of the United Kingdom.
“I’d… I’d actually rather Pott–Harry step out for this,” Draco said to the floor. Then he looked up to see Potter’s hurt face and stumbled over himself to explain. “See, as he’s part of the case Hermione’s building for me, she’s told me it’s better if his testimony is given without the knowledge that–without this knowledge. Sorry,” Draco said, reaching out to squeeze Potter’s hand as he stood to leave.
“C’mon, ‘Mione, it’s pizza, not rocket science. Let’s put her in the oven and go find the pointy ponce,”
Draco forced the corners of his mouth into a smile. “Or something,”
He put them on and looked in the mirror.
that the show started at 10:30 and ended most commonly at 11, but it depends.
Right, right. Owls can’t digest plant-based products. But the owl didn’t know that, and Draco wasn’t about to tell it.
Draco also know a thing or two about Latin, and that’s not really how root words work. But, considering the radio host did not have a tellyphone line to call him up on and complain, Draco’s knowledge would have to go unshared.
“I’m truly sorry for him,” she said to Harry.
“That, and I’m not wearing my glasses. Rather hard to read words I can’t see, you know,”
Draco nodded. “Why shouldn’t I? A lot of it is my responsibility, after all,”
“Oh, I remember,” he interrupted. “I gave that new boy your station frequency when he first came around, several months ago. For local culture, I told him,” George said, jostling into Harry’s shoulder like he’d told a spectacular inside joke. “Hope you don’t mind.”
All Harry could do was nod.
“Malfoy?”
It was probably the most Gryffindor thing he had done since moving out to Scotland in the first place.
“My mother is an astronomy enthusiast,”
Draco took the chair opposite Potter. “I’m going to hold your wand and you are going to explain to me, in precise detail, exactly
the Savior of the Wizarding World. A simple soup is probably below him.
Then the door opened behind him and both dog and man tumbled onto the floor of the dining room.
By 5:00 today–
Oh, well. Ponce probably deserved it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s not a big deal, really,” Draco said. It wasn’t like this was the first time he’d been yelled at, and it certainly wouldn’t be the last. “You didn’t hurt my poor little spoiled rich boy feelings,”
Because Draco was the one responsible for his death!
Just when Harry had made up his mind to hit Malfoy with another pillow, he snapped out of his trance.
Potter made eye contact with him in the mirror, striking green eyes boring into cold grey, the most adorably confused look in them. It was like the look a crup gives you when you hide his favorite toy behind your back. “It’s just a reflection of us and the hall,”
Malfoy’s eyes slid in the mirror to the door, right at where Harry was standing. Harry felt his blood run cold. The dust particles in the air, the ones that had highlighted Malfoy’s sharp cheekbones and proud jawline, would be disturbed by any sort of unseen presence. Like Harry.
“It’s only been a few days, Malfoy. I’m sure you can handle whatever muggle abomination it is,”
Draco nodded as he walked out the door. He made his way through the bookstore. As he was leaving, a tall dark-skinned man with wire-framed glasses and an utter mop of black hair approached the door. He set down an oddly-shaped brown paper package at the door before giving it a resounding couple of knocks. Draco didn’t get a good look at him, but he seemed exceedingly fit under the green jumper.
Harry was the one piece who hadn’t been able to fall back in.
“Sure,” he said, stepping in as she held the door open for him.
He watched his hands grasp at the doorknob and turn it open. He followed his feet down the hallway, felt the warmth of the morning sun but didn’t acknowledge it, eased the door to the music room open.
Steam oozed through the crack where the bathroom door met doorway. Harry heard some sort of muffled noise coming from inside. He pressed his ear up to the door and could just make out what Malfoy was saying.
All the Weasleys had come when Bellatrix was finally tried. They had her buried in a pauper’s grave, her money donated to the restoration efforts at Hogwarts.
The next chapter may take a little while as well, but I'll try to get it done as soon as school and conditioning and stuff allow!
Potter had made this into a game and the prick was winning.
Malfoy looked up, an interesting mix of startled eyes, frowning lips, and red-tinged ears.
“No. I’ve only started cleaning it out today,” Draco answered honestly.
“And because of Harry Potter,” Draco muttered. “That great prat,” he added silently, inspecting the embroidered dragons again. They were listening intently.
Then Harry remembered his own wardrobe, which was majority old Weasley sweaters.
“No,” Harry said.
Unfortunately, Draco’s new self-declared Lesbian mothers were clearly not witches.
Weasley opened his mouth to object.
She pulled sharply at the little hairs at the crown of his head. “I said asking, not whoring! But guess who it’s for?”
Draco set the volume lower and sat on the edge of the bed in Campbell and Elise’s spare bedroom.
But isn’t this what Draco had wanted? After all, he hadn’t dissuaded his mother from her mistaken belief in their relationship. It wouldn’t have been difficult to explain the real situation, but Draco had gone along with it. And here they were.
He looked down at his writing. There were two possible wand movements that could match the spell he wanted, but he couldn’t try them both.
“You know the little blond-headed kid? The new one?”
“That’s my nickname, actually,” Harry said, more to himself than anyone.
“And do tell Draco I would like a word with him as well.”
He took a sip from it.
Harry was inclined to agree. Risks were hardly ever worth, well, the risk.
, so Blaise had no trouble maneuvering himself to the single chair. Blaise moved with a sort of elegance one wouldn't expect from someone so lanky, but the sort of elegance you would expect from someone with Blaise's haughty eyes.
“He did!” Harry crowed. Stella looked up at him, mildly alarmed. “I gave him one of my squashes and the pointy git not only tried to refuse it, but I had to teach him how to cook it!”
Mother tilted her head just so, just as she had been taught to by her mother to indicate that she was sympathetic to the speaker. She beckoned for Draco to continue without words or gesture.
“Why can’t you just take ownership, then?”
Harry choked on the bite of chicken he had just put into his mouth. “Too much, I’d reckon,”
“A loaf of the usual for us and one for the lad,” Campbell answered. “If your old, arthritic hands can manage it,”
Draco closed his eyes, took a deep breath. Don’t let Potter see how you’re shaking the coffee mugs, don’t let him see you’ve spilled some over the side. “Do you want a coffee, Potter?”
Malfoy nodded. “That entry was dated from 1594. It’s the first mention of the house being able to change its rooms at will, so it’s been refining that power for over four hundred years. Do you want to hear the next important one?”
Malfoy looked at him, looked down at his hand in his pocket, then rubbed his arm. It was his right, Harry noticed. The one with the Mark.
Harry forced himself to smile. “Of course. What else?”
“I doubt you’d know him,” Campbell said. “He has one of those names,”
Harry tried to wiggle the fingers on his right hand. He stared at them, begging them to move, do something. They remained stiff, taunting him. Little bitches. Ungrateful. But under a hell of an immobilizing charm. He had to give credit to whichever Malfoy’s wandwork it was.
The rain had stopped at a drizzle, which Draco was marginally thankful for. A pair of sheep were chewing thoughtfully on the road. He looked for the flock, but they were a fair distance away on the side of a hill.
Elise led him to one of the short sofas.
The sheep seemed to nod to him, and Draco went on his way. He forced himself to remain relaxed. Loosen your shoulders, he told himself, Potter can smell your fear.
The letter sent off, Harry retired to his house. It was nearly eight, so he watered all his plants. First, the ferns at the entryway, then figs in the bedroom. Third, aloe and thyme in the downstairs bathroom, fourth was more aloe and lemon balm in the upstairs bathroom. Last, but his favorite were all the cooking herbs in the kitchen.
He shook his head. Of all the things he’d expected to come from taking Potter to his mother’s house, this would have been so far down the list it’d be in Australia.
The tables had turned. Harry wasn’t sure where they had been pointed in the first place, but now they were resolutely not in his favor. He was most certain of it. “Reading,”
Draco was well aware. Rattling around in the manor was bad enough- he could hardly imagine what it was like in one of the cramped local houses.
Harry sighed.
He set up a temporary warding charm to let him know when they came back upstairs. He felt a little guilty doing it, but honestly, if he didn’t know who was staying in that room he’d probably have a conniption. At this point, snooping was just self-care.
Potter was of interest. Much interest indeed.
“You talk like we go to parties together,”
And then the robe. The dark green of the outer layer coordinated with the pants, and the brilliant emerald of the inner layer swept around him with the power of holly boughs. The embroidered dragons from the pants pockets adorned the inside of the robe as well.
Potter looked back and forth like Draco was crazy for questioning. “Yes, friends. You know, you did something for me, I did something in return. And so on. I’d rather stop keeping track of favors,”
Potter was entirely too close to Malfoy, now, and not in a good way. Malfoy was backed up against the countertop in the kitchen, the gourd from yesterday right behind his hand. Potter was shouting at him, only inches from his face, wand drawn and pointed at Draco’s chin. Draco felt tears in his eyes and please, not now. He willed them back into the wells they came from.
From behind the door of his flat he heard the faint distinctive pop of apparition, then he walked back out into the store. Sure enough, Potter was gone. But come to think of it, London was an awfully long jump, especially side-along. Did he mean to do it in two? No, Draco realized. Potter didn’t mean to do it in two because Potter was the most powerful wizard of our time, by all reports (especially
Luna sniffed. “Lovely place,” she said, leading him and Malfoy out of the room. They walked down a musty hallway and finally through a cheap paint-peeled ‘white’ door. Luna opened the door and here was a familiar place. The dark marble courtroom was the picture of elegance and bureaucracy. The little busts of famous Wizarding lawmakers passed judgement over anyone who accidentally looked in their direction. Which was quite difficult to not do, as the busts lines the dome of the circular room. Apparently, they were harsher when you knew their names, which thank Merlin Harry didn’t.
He glanced over at Harry, who tried to look as out of it as possible. He must have been convincing, because Malfoy dragged a chair over to the wall near him and began rifling through his stack of papers.
Blaise had always said it was obvious once you knew where to look.
Which meant that Draco really, really hoped he’d been imagining that Potter’s was substantially larger than his. It had to have been the dark. Maybe Potter had accidentally conjured some incorporeal patronus wisps along with his jackal. Yeah. That would make sense.
He nodded, still staring at the bed. “I will be going as well. Back to my home,” he said.
Harry had the sense that he wasn’t supposed to be awake. Maybe it was the burning pain in his shoulder, maybe it was the fierce discussion going on in the centre of the room. He resisted the temptation to turn his head or move, instead looking straight up at the ceiling.
It was time. Lucius was calling.
She opened her mouth to say what Harry knew had to be concerning, stressful news. So he interrupted her.
Draco barely registered his head falling onto his card table. In seconds, he was asleep.
“And without the Manor, Lucius and Mother won’t have anywhere to live and our family history would be good as lost. Not to mention the grounds. Can you help me?” he finally asked.
Seduction it was not. But it was the start of something, Draco was sure. One didn’t often humiliate themselves in the shower without it turning into
Harry crept down the hall. The door was closed, this time. He tried the door handle; it was locked. He was about to creep back down the hall when he remembered he was a wizard and unlocked it. The door opened and the first thing he noticed was the darkness. The blinds on the windows had been shut, but if that had just been the case then a little light should have been trickling through. He squinted. Then he looked down.
“Ha!” George helped himself to tea. “He was the only one who never came. Old pig headed coot. Always on about those raccoons,”
Yesterday the man on the radio had complained about meeting an old acquaintance and Draco couldn’t have related more. His acquaintance, whom he called ‘Posh Spice,’ seemed like quite the arsehole, bullying him in school unprovoked and such.
Harry cocked his head. “A what?”
“Draco!”
Sleep.
“I’m so sorry, I don’t know how that got mixed up in here. It was a custom order for a gentleman a few years ago, but he didn’t like it. An apprentice must have put them on the show rack by mistake,”
“–should have been able to happen to stumble upon my town. This is my town, Malfoy, and I don’t need you polluting it!”
“–but I’m glad you have friends who will come to you. Not everyone has that.”
Professional wasn’t a good look on him. “Good morning. How did you get my floo address?”
Elise’s tone turned tender. “You alright, a leanbh?” She asked, gently grabbing his shoulder.
That did it, then.
This was said in Malfoy’s normal voice, the one he used when talking to Pansy or Blaise at school, not the one used for tormenting Harry or anyone else.
“Wizengamot ruled about a month ago that all past Death Eater places of residence need to be re-inspected for lingering Dark influence, whatever that means,”
“The lid wasn’t even open, Potter. I’ve done a lot worse to that old thing,”
“She was looking lovely when you brought her to see us. I’m astonished the post didn’t ruin her!”
“-I know you need to talk to him. Trust me, all he needs is a friend. I believe in you.”
“...right, Harry?” Elise said, snapping him out of the memory.
He blinked. “A what?”
Harry grabbed the squash. Something had made Malfoy ask him to stay for supper, and hell if Harry was going to skip supper because of a posh twat’s mad impulse. He grabbed a bowl and started mashing the squash.
Harry sipped his tea.
He left George’s Electronic Reparations with a fixed radio, a list with the tuning specifications for George’s favorite stations, and a potential friend.
“In case I was wondering,” Draco repeated.
on another note, my English teacher keeps posting our questions of the day at like 1:30 am. should I be concerned for her? lol ma'am you're not allowed to have an unhealthy sleep schedule. that's for your students to relish.
Then a tannish-colored knit shirt. It had none of the pomp of the other dress shirts he had tried on that day, and he appreciated it. Nothing to get caught in.
on his front porch for the past week. That had to be illegal. Of course, it’s not like Harry could press charges without revealing himself. Damn hermitude.
Elise nodded. “You must know a dozen other people with it,”
“I also assumed you had research to be getting to.”
and the side characters said howdy!
He actually had a nice face, he thought. Draco rather liked it. He liked it best when his hair fell about his face in a state of disorder. He liked it when he looked a little bit shabbier than was strictly necessary for a nice pureblood such as himself.
He hadn’t had the strength to look back at Harry as he’d fled the room, too busy thinking about patronuses and too soon and what if and soulmates and everything and nothing.
She sighed. “Malfoy, or should I call you Draco?”
He sat up, expecting the soreness and heavy muscles that usually come with sleeping on the floor. It didn’t come. He scowled. Damn Potter again, making everything perfect. Draco snatched a pillow from the ground and chucked it at Potter’s stupid face.
Malfoy had looked happy, almost, no, it couldn’t be, but
“Yes,” Draco agreed. “Funny things,” His wand was pressing into his backside. If the muggles asked what it was, he would have to pass it off as fancy pen or something. He looked over to the kitchen. Campbell was busying herself making some sort of sauce.
It had puzzled Draco when he was younger, having black ivory keys, as black ivory didn’t really exist. He’d asked his piano tutor about it one day, and the old Russian man had just laughed.
She didn’t give him a tour, instead opting to push him upstairs to her flat.
He bet Malfoy knew all their names. He spared a glance at the blonde man.
The baker’s eyes grew wide in what seemed like mockery, but was actually an invitation to tell more. “Oh no. Who insulted your honor now?”
“Never imagined I’d have Draco Malfoy in my kitchen with my grandfather fixing him a radio he found off the street,”
“Hmmm,” Draco said, making a show out of thinking and being very, very, confusedly confused. “It’s you. But that can’t be, since I’m clearly the most beautiful person in the world,”
“When you phrase it that way, it sounds crass,” Malfoy said, turning back to his papers.
He needed to talk to someone (Stella not included).
Harry had memorized the way Malfoy looked up after completing an entry, excited yet hesitant, waiting for Harry’s approval. The ever-burning passion in his eyes each time made Harry feel a little warmer, from the top of his head down to his numb toes. Not with lust or any sort of minor, intermittent desire, but with an aching sort of fondness. Harry could feel that kind of light fondness begin to consume him from the bottom up.
She nodded, albeit a bit uncertainly. “Good luck, then. I’ll leave you to it.”
Harry felt a bit of a grin pull at his lips. “You don’t, do you?”
So Hermione, his best friend since age eleven, was using him as a second resort. On her list of priorities, old mortal enemy somehow ranks above pitiful shut-in. “He has friends, Hermione,” Harry said, the words sour in his mouth. “Maybe he’s in Amsterdam or something.”
“Potter, this is Alexandre Lefevre. He’s going to be fitting some robes for you today,” he said.
A red brick house in the north held itself blissfully apart from the rest of town, and Harry’s feet were leading him right to it. The cheerily painted sign at the front read “George’s Electronic Reparations.” Harry stepped up to the door and gave it a few gentle knocks.
She gave him a hard look through her straight black bangs.
expectations.
to! I’ll be bored to death of feeling guilty,”
But it was just an honest observation, really. If Malfoy didn’t want to be perceived as a ponce, then why would he look so poncey?
He hooked his leg under Malfoy’s.
He supposed the rooms near the sun parlor would be first priority, but given that the rooms had been knocked out of order it was hard to be sure. Maybe Potter had gone in the first room he’d seen, but it had actually been one of the spare bedrooms. And then he’d gotten bored or something and tried to leave, but the room he chose had gotten moved as well. If Potter had been dropped off in some unfamiliar part of the Manor, there’d be no way he could get back. Potter had never been in this part of the Manor as far as Draco knew, and it was doubtful he even knew his cardinal directions, being from suburbia and all.
Elise grabbed it out of his hand. “Guests don’t have to do the washing up,” She waited while he remained standing for several seconds. “What are you waiting for? Go grab your things!”
As soon as he was in nothing more than underpants, Alexandre handed him a pair of light blue silk pants and a matching shirt, then a navy robe.
here are all the thoughts in my head:
The caption read: “Despite torture of his Fiancée, Hermione Granger, at the residence of this former Death Eater, Junior Auror Ronald Weasley magnanimously offers him a second chance.”
“I mean, there’s nothing the Savior responds better to than guilt, right? And if I seem kind, earnest, and completely changed, he’ll be falling to his knees to help me,”
“Must’ve made a pretty strong impression for you to know who he is without his name,”
“Draco,” he said.
“Wizengamot’s having a discussion today. It’s open to registered parties, which, luckily,” she procured three ‘visitor’ badges with the day’s date and their respective names. “we are,”
The man had let himself get distracted by his lover (or ex-lover) again with rudimentary comparisons, but Draco found it strangely endearing. Of course, it reminded him of Potter, and Potter reminded him of kissing Potter, and kissing Potter reminded him of how fucked up kissing Potter was.
It was a pompous, cultured room, and yet Draco had nothing but good memories in it. Sure, he had cried when unable to master a solo from Tchaikovsky’s No. 1 in Bb minor, but the thrill of performing it years later for his mother’s friends overshadowed it.
Harry looked around at the rest of the courtroom. A few of the mugwumps has taken their seats on the side opposite him and Malfoy. And as far as he could tell, he, Malfoy, and Luna were the only non-judiciary people in attendance.
“Why not?” She twirled her fork.
Mother turned the corner into the sun parlor. Draco followed, catching a glimpse of Potter, who seemed a bit off-kilter.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter hissed the inevitable question into Draco’s ear: “So what is it?”
“So about these Squoggles, I’m going to have to use a couple of charms and then flush them out with a potion…”
“How was I supposed to know?”
Harry got up and walked over to the receiver to check who was calling.
Draco smiled weakly. “Something like that, Blaise, something like that,”
They each grabbed one of Luna’s hands, and then all three whisked away to the Wizengamot court.
Blaise snickered.
“But to answer your question, besides being able to sell the grounds to private developers, yes. And if that hostility was a true reflection of the Manor’s nature, I’d be inclined to agree with the Ministry,”
Ask him tomorrow and Harry wouldn’t have the faintest idea what Malfoy had been talking on about for those hours, but he could tell about the way Malfoy’s throat bobbed when he swallowed for dramatic effect, or the precise timbers of the roughness in his voice when he needed a drink of water, or the little movements he made with his eyebrows to express the new writer’s emotion.
Harry took one last look at Malfoy, his perfect body so still in the night, then he turned over and closed his eyes. He’d like to spend more nights like that, Harry thought. More nights listening to Draco talk.
The statement was made in a deep caricature of a voice. Harry nearly laughed when he realized it was meant to be him.
There was this thing Draco had learned to do, back during fifth year, refined during sixth year, perfected during seventh year, where he just shut off all his emotions and allowed his body to walk around with fog for brains until he had done what needed to be done.
“You’re about four stone too heavy for that, girl,” he said, but let her crush his fragile knees with her paws anyway.
The door flung open and they jumped apart, Draco holding the folder and sliding the music into it.
“Of course,” she said, thankfully looking not at all out of place in his yellow-walled plant-filled kitchen. “But that’s not why I came,”
Or maybe it was hidden in Malfoy’s eyes, which glinted silver in the cool late spring light coming in from a window. He laughed at something Alexandre said and Malfoy’s eyes crinkled in a way Harry had never seen. He ran a hand through his fine blond hair, causing a bit in the back to stand straight up.
At eight he would water all the house-plants and herbs: the ferns at the entryway, figs in the bedroom, aloe and thyme in the downstairs bathroom, more aloe and lemon balm in the upstairs bathroom, and all the cooking herbs in the kitchen.
What a little shit. He thought, taking in the tear-stained cheeks and mussed hair. I’m being a little shit.
Swish, slash, flick, or swipe, flick, swipe?
The door swung open.
Harry held his breath until he counted to forty-seven, then let it out with a sigh. He shifted, lifting his head up to look around.
“She didn’t want much to do with me. Well, she did, it’s just she didn’t know how to say anything to me. I mean, how do you open a conversation with the man who just completely cut you out of his life a couple years ago?” The radio host took a deep, shaky breath.
“No one. No friends, anyway,”
Someone was shaking Draco. Not vigorously, not aggressively. It was more like… a gentle rocking motion.
A dragon near his knee was flitting around rather energetically, much to the dismay of the dragon on the edge of the cushion.
But an unexpected listener was falling asleep at his Mums’ house while the Mums talked in hushed whispers about what should be done about the Boys, what happened to them, and how to go about getting them to meet one another.
He knelt down and held his hand out. “Hey, where are you from?” he asked.
Harry could have cursed if he hadn’t been so distracted watching the white curve of Draco’s throat bob as he swallowed hard.
“Shut up and let her tell the story.” Campbell said.
-ed the floor. It was still a dingy grey, but at least it was no longer dusty.
One-hundred six, one-hundred seven, one-hundred eight, one-hundred nine, one-hundred ten, one-hundred eleven, one-hundred twelve, one-hundred thirteen, one-hundred fourteen, one-hundred fifteen, one-hundred sixteen, one-hundred seventeen, one-hundred eighteen, one-hundred nineteen, one-hundred twenty, one-hundred twenty-one, one-hundred twenty-two, one-hundred twenty-three, one-hundred twenty-four, one-hundred twenty-five, one-hundred twenty-six, one-hundred twenty-seven, one-hundred twenty-eight, one-hundred twenty-nine, one-hundred thirty, one-hundred thirty-one, one-hundred thirty-two, one-hundred thirty-three, one-hundred thirty-four.
He started convincing the sheep to eat Potter’s daisies. It was going swimmingly thus far; nearly a quarter of the supply had been damaged. He decided to name the other one Lola.
He sighed, leaving the dough mid-knead. Stella barked again and he heard a laugh.
The red set wasn’t it either.
“Of-of course not. What did you say your name was?”
Draco shook his head slightly. Potter smelled like sweat.
Harry sincerely doubted that, but came in anyway, making sure to take off his trainers. Looking at them, he supposed they were a little grey where they should be white, and a little brown where they should be grey. He referred to it as ‘worn-in.’
Hermione’s news couldn’t be that awful, could it? He crept over to the door and pressed his ear against it. Damned Malfoy had burnt up his extendable ears so normal ones are all he had.
Malfoy looked around, tried the door, looked around again. An odd look of serenity passed his face. He seemed to be taking in the whole room the way a flower takes in the sun. Then he passed the piano to walk toward Harry.
Draco looked down to see his pale thin fingers entwined by Potter’s rough and dark ones. “No, you’re holding mine,” he said petulantly. Potter rolled his eyes and Draco took the opportunity to not only snatch his hand away, but also lecture Potter on the Malfoy rules. “My mother is scary. Everything she says to you is a test. If you don’t pass, well, I’m not sure what will happen but I’m not eager to find out. You shouldn’t be, either. Also, don’t touch anything with a cover or in a cupboard or cabinet if you haven’t seen Mother or I touch it first. There’s a lot of lingering Dark magic, even in this Wing on the Manor, and with Lucius–”
He thought about protesting, but what good would that do? Harry didn’t very well have a good reason as to why he wanted to know about Malfoy’s legal matters, just that he did. He nodded to Hermione and went into the kitchen, closing the door behind him.
“This is my party,
“–I didna mean that–”
“Hello, Potter,” Draco said, not turning around. “Lovely day.”
‘Of course, Draco, you’re brilliant! I regret marring your perfect physique in the bathroom! I think about it day and night with no reprieve! I’m so sorry for my lapse in judgement! But just between you and me, I think they’re very sexy!’”
“You’ll never guess how I’ve been spending my days,” Pansy said with a little twinkle in her eye. She was now sitting on the sofa, and Draco on the floor. She was braiding little bits of his hair and he had his eyes closed, enjoying the sensation of the tugs and little scratches on his scalp.
He looked at his hands, gripping the sink. Blood pounded in his ears and he felt the telltale dizzying buzz of adrenaline. He looked in the mirror. Wild eyes looked back at him. God, no wonder Malfoy had looked scared. Anyone would be.
Once outside, he let out a huge breath, but he maintained the disillusionment charm. Sure enough, Malfoy stuck his head into the hall. His gaze drifted toward Harry, but slid right over him. Seemingly satisfied that he was alone, Malfoy continued to the bathroom.
He made himself a cup of coffee (just a light roast of arabica, something simple).
But maybe Malfoy was controlling it. Maybe this had all been a ploy to get Harry Potter alone and vulnerable. Harry felt doubt and paranoia creep into his mind, assuring him that Malfoy was up to no good, Malfoy was plotting against him, Malfoy was out for his blood and reputation.
“Pizza,” Hermione said, and he felt her steer him into one of his chairs.
“Talk to her, Potter. And don’t make an arse of yourself,” he said.
He closed his eyes, thought of Campbell and Elise’s Christmas in July party last year. He’d felt so loved, so accepted.
He looked at his hands. They were shaking. He lowered them onto the cool kitchen counter Merlin, Harry Potter. Of all the wizards he could accidentally meet, it had to be the one who owed him the least.
