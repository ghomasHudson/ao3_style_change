"Right. That's why you all look like you'll run off at the slightest sound," Draco grumbles, feeling left-out. "Potter, you're not actually the heir of Slytherin, are you? Is that why you're so nervous? Planning another attack tonight, perhaps?"
Luna cuts into a piece of bacon and shoves a forkful into her mouth. “He’s in my year,” she tells him. “That little boy that was always following Harry Potter around. It’s such a shame he’s been murdered.”
"Give me a second," Draco mumbles. He flips to the front page, and, yes, it was his diary. "Potter, how—?"
Without thinking, Draco shoved his hand into the air, praying to somebody up above that he wouldn't be ignored. Fortunately, both Trelawney and Umbridge turned at his movement. "Professor Umbridge, don't you think it would be better for you to see if Professor Trelawney's students could predict something for you? I mean, that would prove whether her teaching style is effective or not, yes?"
Draco nodded, “I am. I was born at the manor and our family’s private physician has always seen to me there.”
“My parents, as everyone knows, are dead. My other family hated me, apart from my god-father and Remus and they, of course, are dead. The rest were using me.” Harry wasn’t saying anything else on the matter. Molly had let him come here after all. As far he was concerned this was just a place to put him when he wasn’t needed anymore.
“Why would you want to stay under someone else’s control?” Rey sounded so incredulous it was almost pained.
Violet closed her eyes. “Oh my god…oh my god. So they’re not just famous wizards with a drug addiction.”
“So, what? You’re in each other’s heads now?” Mandy shivered. She couldn’t imagine anyone would want that. She couldn’t believe they’d done such a thing on purpose.
Draco slumped against Harry. They were thoughtful for several minutes, finally Draco shifted, “alright, when do we go?”
Harry nodded and moved as close as he could to the top. Draco, not trusting Vane and maybe rightly so, held onto to him as he reached out to take the blade from her.
Ron scowled as Hermione threw her coat over the back of her chair, “Oh Ron, it’s not nearly that bad. I had warned you.”
I would not be before this court. Might I remind you, I have lost two cousins, my sister, my husband, my son-in-law and my
Teddy looked up from his shrunken head, awesome gift. He was so going to Africa one day. “Huh,” he looked between his brothers, “what do you mean?” He’d thought he’d told them everything already.
Hermione laughed. “You did, it looks great. You look great.” He did, healthier and so much happier. The dark circles around his eyes were gone and as he sat up, his shoulders weren’t hunched by invisible weight. She wondered if they had seen the papers or heard about what people were saying and she loathed mentioning it. She stood up, “Harry, come grab some drinks with me.”
Mandy shook her head. “I know what Ron Wesley looks like. I’ll grab them when I see them. I’m not dancing, and I can see the door. It’s fine, go.”
Harry nodded to Anthony, rather like he was thanking the boy for mentioning it.  “He also left Poppy the remedy for the necklace’s poison and since he’d been ordered to kill Rosmerta the fact that he didn’t, nor had her commit any serious crimes says something, doesn’t it?” Harry answered with narrowed eyes and, having no response, Anthony looked away, “Malfoy held someone under the imperius for a whole year and yet, never used that power on any of you.”
Harry didn’t say much during group and Draco said less. Harry felt sure Murphy was trying to stay on ‘safe’ topics for their return. He did notice Mandy, beside him, hadn’t moved her chair away from him. Beside Draco, Ella hadn’t move either. He wondered what that meant. After group, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand to make a quick getaway.
“I don’t understand. I’m the bad guy, why?” Draco broke off and dropped his head onto Harry’s shoulder.
“It’s probably for the best you spoke up Molly, with all this talk at the Ministry about raising the majority age. Making your guardianship of Harry clear was probably a wise decision.”
Moments later the wardrobe door flew open, letting the boy out followed by three girls. Harry studied the size of the wardrobe, there was no way. Unless there was hidden space, he raised his eyebrows at Draco, who scoffed, but gifted him with a brief smile.
“No, Harry, you’re really not.” Tawy smiled. “Keep writing in your journals. We’ll talk tomorrow. Night boys.”
The walls yawned as all felt the presence of immense power, like a wave hovering and waiting to overcome them. Every wizard in the room, who had a wand, went to it as if by unconscious call, all but for Tawy, who raised her clearly empty hands. “No, Harry, that’s not what we’re doing at all.”
Tawy moved towards the observation room’s door and didn’t seem to pay attention to the three teens who followed her until Mandy’s, “holy fuck,” reminded her they were there. She glanced towards them but didn’t send them away. “I’ll need you all to be quiet.”
They ran into something Draco couldn’t identify and began trying to figure it out. They worked so well together. It was amazing what they could accomplish when out from under the expectations placed upon them. Perhaps Draco and Harry could reach their true potential if left unhampered by what was left of the adults who had enslaved them to their ideals.
Ahead of them Mandy glanced around, “Ben, find Tawy. Clara, find some-fucking-body.” Ben and Clara broke away from them at a run. “Here.” She slid to a stop in front of a set of double doors. Mandy tried to open them and slammed her hand against the wood when the door remained shut. “It’s fucking locked.” She turned and looked at them, paling, “Shite, this is the training room, but it’s locked, and I don’t,”
George didn’t know why they put up with it, but instead of anger Neville gave her a fond thoughtful nod.
Ron didn’t know what to say. He never did with Harry either, he joined Blaise, taking a deep drink. He wanted Hermione to say something. She always knew what to say, but she didn’t need to this time.
Murphy grinned. “That’s fantastic Ella, really good work.” He looked around, “did everyone see what Ella did? Instead of reacting with panic, she looked around herself and took the time to calmly study what was happening.”
Mandy remembered what they’d done to the privacy shield with nothing but their hands. She went back through the magazine, stopping on the article she’d been looking for. “According to Rita they’re the strongest wizards in modern history.”
“That sounds about right.” Draco agreed, pulling himself from the beanbag as he spoke, turning and offering his hand down to Harry, “come on Potter, let’s go nap.”
The iciness wasn’t surprising, unpleasant as it was, it was still better this well-earned anger than the mess she would have had with the Malfoys. Tawy pointed down to the two pictures, “Draco,” she moved to the other, “Harry.”
He worried even more when the Ministries representative, Mr. Kade, showed himself to be a bit of rambling fool. The man had been here a week, and Hermione was still sitting in a waiting cell.
Narcissa smiled and made small talk. She mentioned he looked well, but that was an understatement. She couldn’t remember the last time he’d looked so well. When last, she’d seen him the dark circles beneath his eyes had been nearly black. Now they were shades, it hurt that another had been able to help him when she herself had not. Between her own feelings and those of Lucius’ that twisted into her, but did not show past his icy demeaner, it was everything she could do not to scream and cry at the boy. Narcissa glanced towards Tawy and took a deep breath, determined to hold her grace in the presence of the ministry.
She was breathing harshly, having obviously run from where ever she’d been. “Harry,” she immediately made to start down the stairs, but was stopped by another girl, who grabbed the back of her shirt.
Harry thought maybe both he and Malfoy should be cut a little slack. They’d had a Dark Lord breathing down the back of their necks a majority of the time. Besides they usually took the most damage out on each other, which was rather sad, now that he thought back on it.
Harry pondered it, “likely, but not without Tawy asking about it.” They might get time with their wands every day, but it wasn’t time alone.
Draco raised an eyebrow but he smiled and it wasn’t a sneer or smirk. He looked over Neville's level of fitness, “So do you.”
Harry chuckled beneath his breath, while Draco rolled his eyes. “Must not be Hogwarts. They’re made of tougher stuff.”
The goodbyes were rather short after that. They’d made it a few feet from the burrow when a voice called out from behind them, “Oi, wait up!”
Harry gave her a tight smile for her support. Technically they didn’t even have to be here. Only Harry was routinely called in by the Wizengamot and they could always floo him in when they needed, but Harry didn’t feel right about not being here.
Rey grinned, “It looks like even healers aren’t immune to having celebrities in their mist.” He frowned and twisted in his seat. A whole bunch of people hanging around and watching them, made him nervous.
Sev reached across the table and squeezed his hand. All this touching was surprising to Teddy as usually neither of his brothers were very physically affectionate. “It’s probably time we go back and settled things there anyway.”
Luna glanced towards George and placed a hand on Pansy’s arm before she spoke kindly to Neville, “They’ve got to be delaying Hermione and Ron’s return for some reason.”
They both reacted to the summons and stopped themselves from reaching for wands that weren’t with them. Ben leaned up against their table. He looked both excited and uncomfortable. He raised his hands. “Hey just a question, alright?”
“It won’t hurt us,” Siri offered, “and if you’re worried we’d be upset or angry don’t be, we’re okay.”
“I am.” Draco replied and paused thoughtfully before adding, “Though I wouldn’t recommend learning it.”
Tawy found that hard to believe. The building was still standing after all. She looked to Murphy, “Here.” She took off her necklace, “this will allow you to grab the boys’ wands from my desk. Quickly.”
Harry took over the conversation, knowing that while it wasn’t obvious, Draco’s anxiety was starting to get the better of him. This trip was already concern filled for Draco, but waiting to see George was particularly taxing. George hadn’t shown by the time they sat to eat, and Harry knew Draco blamed himself for George’s continued absence. Draco was quiet but it was barely noticeably to the Weasley’s, who didn’t know Draco well. Under the table, Harry held his hand. After lunch, Harry had hoped to have some time with just Ron, Hermione, he and Draco, but it wasn’t meant to be. Molly seemed determined to keep them front and center. Harry decided instead to gather the trunk the Weasley’s had kindly stored for him, then used Tawy and their next appointment to leave.
She pulled the paper from her pocket and handed it over. She thought maybe they’d do better knowing exactly what everyone had seen.
Lunch was fancy and slightly weird, but it was delicious, and Harry decided Draco was going to be in charge of their food and shoes from here on out.
Murphy raised a hand, “enough Mandy. They did. Tawy agreed that’s exactly what they did. Now we need to move on.”
Ron shrugged, “Harry’s claimed him as a soulmate or some shite, so yeah, he’s mine too. Piss off.” He said it with such casual protective ferociousness that everyone acquiesced before they really understood what he’d said.
“It doesn’t matter,” Romilda offered, “if you’re caught, it’ll only lead to me and” she shrugged, “it’s nothing I don’t deal with often enough. Just don’t hurt anyone with it. Promise me, Harry.”
Harry could barely hear the Healer speak for all the whispering going on around him. He looked at Hermione, who had a tight pursed look to her face and then to Ron, whose lips were tight with, well Harry wasn’t sure, but he didn’t look happy or vindicated by Malfoy’s pain. Harry didn’t know how he felt. He was maybe hurt for Malfoy or hurt about Malfoy. Harry wasn’t sure what he felt but it twisted in his gut.
Draco leaned towards the host and spoke for a few minutes. When he leaned back, he was smiling, “Come along.”
“Got your bands here.” She held up two thick bracelets as she approached, “these will give you directions. Your schedules are programmed into them and arrows in the hallways will point you where to go.”
Hestia Jones, Professor McGonagall, Madam Poppy and several others of the ladies ended up around the kitchen table, where Molly had put out snacks, regardless of the fact that they’d all just eaten. They all had tea in hand and Harry was fairly sure he knew where the conversation would lead. He put Ron and Hermione off when they wanted to join the younger people outside and waited until he was sure they had gone before he found himself a chair. The perfect chair turned enough that he wouldn’t be in direct view of the kitchen but close enough to hear. He hung his robes over the back and now in his tee shirt and jeans settled in as if he were taking a nap. It didn’t take long.
“It didn’t help them, did it? Would you want to learn with the teachers they had? Snape, the convict Black or the fucking Lestranges?” Rey had never met any of them, but he’d seen more than enough to be glad he never had.
Harry nodded. “We need to send a lot, the minute we’re out of here. We send owls to our friends, see if they can meet us.”
Draco crossed his arms and leaned back against the wall. He was doing his level best to appear unaffected by all of this. He felt uncomfortable under the stare of the new Healer though she wasn’t giving him any dark looks just looking.
group.” It had been a slow painful process, but Draco had learned to take any concession to his wants as a win.
“For us?” Harry had no problems taking Draco with him, the sooner the Weasleys got used to it the better, but, “you’re going with?”
Had Harry known about the camera taking the picture, he might have given a two-finger salute to finish the task. As it was, Harry was too nervous to wonder about how Draco looked sneaking into Gringotts two hours before they normally opened. Harry didn’t think he’d ever be comfortable in Gringotts again. He apologized to nearly every goblin that came close enough until Draco stopped him.
“Inhale and hold, little puffs at first, but we’ll cough no matter what. Don’t inhale to deeply cause we’ll burn our throats.” Harry glanced towards Ben. “Raised by muggles and my cousin was into it.”
George raised an eyebrow, “Come on Hermione, you don’t think Harry actually hates him? Not the way he tracks that kid.”
He looked up and smiled. “Hey Zabini, we were just waiting for you,” but Zabini didn’t smile instead he slapped down a paper.
Tawy tilted her head with a cold smile. “Further investigation will not be necessary your honor. My office has officially dismissed him with a complete loss of benefits.”
Harry sighed, relaxing as Draco’s weight anchored against him.  “Nope and it’s big enough for both of us, so relax. I won’t let it hurt you.”
Harry wiggled his fingers through his damp hair then rolled the sleeves of his grey shirt. At least he didn’t have to worry about what to wear. He had a wardrobe full of the same thing. There were some light green loose pants, which were at least soft, some trainers, a drawer of underwear and socks, along with variations of short-sleeve matching green t-shirts, and gray long-sleeved shirts. There was even a soft gray hoodie with his last name on the front.
Tawy sighed, “He was too scared to.” She ducked down to meet his eyes, “Draco, are there any other potions you’re sensitive too or any other reactions?”
Murphy gave her a look that shut her mouth but didn’t stop her from huffing and crossing her arms. Murphy sighed as he looked away from her. “Does anyone have anything else they’d like to talk about? Last time we spoke of the unforgivables. Does anyone have anything they’d like to add to that?”
“Draco then,” her smile warmed, “in return call me Molly. Please everyone,” she turned toward the living room with a wide wave, “come in.”
The solicitor nodded with an immediate look of relief and turned back to his cohorts, waving for one to go, the last turned and quickly went out of the room again.
Harry tried to run interference. Ron and Hermione followed his lead and didn’t attack Malfoy. He’d tried talking to his house, Ron and Hermione silent but standing beside him, however none of them took it seriously. The only person he’d seen actually trying to stop the abuse was Neville. While Ron and Hermione had been silence, Neville had spoken up, which Harry appreciated, even if it hadn’t really done anything to stop the rest of the school.
Moments later, a boy leaned his head over the top railing, “Oi,” he called back, he walked around to the head of the staircase and paused, his eyes wide, “blimey, is that Harry Potter,” he looked next to Harry and backed up a step, “And that, bloody. Mandy, you cow, you off your nut? Bringing them round here? A fucking death eater!”
“We’re here! We’re here!” Pansy Parkinson ran up to them. Blaise Zabini behind her, “sorry, sorry. Where’s Draco?”
A younger woman behind the man said, “You might want to tell him whose great-grandfather you are Judge Bones.”
Red, a silent band of dark red shot along the walls, close to the ceiling. Healer Kelly paused and watched as it progressed around the room, standing as it went out the door again. Her movement cut off what a girl was saying, all of them focusing on Healer Kelly. She dropped the privacy bubble without fanfare, “that will be all for todays group. Please go directly to your rooms.”
Harry brushed his thumbs over Draco’s face until Draco raised his eyes, “Then I’ll do the fighting Draco and you just hang onto me. Don’t let me go no matter what and we’ll get through this I promise.”
with him. It’s always more with Malfoy. I don’t think Harry would settle for just mates, anyone else yes, but not Malfoy.”
Harry turned to Mandy as Draco ordered people around as was his nature. “Thank you, he needed this.”
They met Mandy at the door, which led into a muggle meeting/visitation room. Mandy rushed forward to meet a tall blonde woman, who looked nothing like Mandy, but the woman greeted her with a hug. “Mandy!” She hugged her tightly.
Kingsley glanced at the Malfoy’s but based his attention on Molly and Andromeda. “The Ministry was very insistent on this course of action. I hope in time you will see and we will prove this was the right thing to do for both Harry and Draco.”
“If you get caught with it,” the girl behind Romilda whistled lowly, “it’ll be hell to pay. They’ll want to know where you got it from.”
Clara jumped and quickly backed away. Mandy swore, while Ben moved his chair further away from the cans and them. Rey nervously twisted as a poster ripped itself to shreds and another can burst open in an arch of soda.
Judge Fumeurs glanced down at the injunction and then to the woman before him and decided to see this though. “Alright Madam,” he looked up and to the room at large, “Minister and members of the court will remain, everyone else out. This court will be close for,” he paused, while the judge to the right leaned in and whispered to him, Fumeurs nodded, “5 hours.”
Harry opened the door. There were 3 people in the room, two boys, one reading a book with hair darker red than Ron’s, the other a big tall bloke with brown hair and a small blonde girl. The girl didn’t look up from the ends of her long hair. The redheaded boy looked up from his book but then back down. The large boy stood. “Holy shite,” He stared at them. “Clara, Rey, look who the fuck has graced us. The freaks of wizarding youth.”
It was at that point Hermione and Ron came into the room, which ended the ladies’ conversation. Harry sighed and stretched as he let Ron ‘wake’ him up.
Ron’s grinned widened and he waved a hand towards the table, “Please join us. We’re just waiting for Hermione.”
“They made cards of us? They made a card of me?” Draco asked, taking his back from Harry and studying it.
Andromeda straightened, she leaned down over the pictures, “they did this,” she glanced at Tawy between beholding the pictures, “to each other.”
Draco huffed even as he shifted for Harry to sit next to him again. “They’re fantastic. No ink pot, inks right inside, it’s brilliant. You can just carry them around with you and not worry about them breaking as much.”
The ladies laughed with good humor, though Harry didn’t really see what was so funny. He and Ron would be fantastic Aurors. Another year under adult say-so wasn’t that pleasant a thought either. It wasn’t like they’d been a lot of help in the past.
Draco, still more asleep than awake, saw Bear and heard his tone but couldn’t make out his words. A large unknown wizard, standing over him and growling in anger sent Draco into a panic. He made a hurt noise and curled away.
Rey looked up from his book to remark, but he forgot what he was going to say when he saw who was approaching their table. “Hey, hey.”
Charlie, feeling properly chastened, quickly agreed and wondered when his youngest brother had grown so much. Then swallowed thickly when Ron turned haunted eyes his way, “Yeah, I hear ya Ron. I won’t say a word.”
Still it effected the kids, who stuck to the further parts of the room from the observation window. It wasn’t enough to stop them, this being the only time most of them got a chance to use their wands, but they stuck to small spells. There was no experimenting today. Harry and Draco hadn’t even done that. So far, they just leaned together in the corner, far down and opposite her own. Though they’d had their wands a short time ago, compared to the others, still she didn’t think they’d be so disinclined to practice now.
“I’m getting angry thinking about it, which might not be a good idea.” Harry tried to calm himself and the magic that was starting to roar around him. Then something odd happened, Draco put his hand over his and Harry could breathe again. He took a deep breath and released it. “Thanks.”
Harry’s hand slid over his and Draco looked up. “I won’t leave you and if necessary, I’ll kick ass before I let them hurt you.”
The boy didn’t even lift his head. “No can do Benny. The very lovely Penelope is using it and if I ever want to get some arse, I gotta let her get her grass. Ya know, come back in an hour.” He flipped the page in his book.
Mandy threw up a hand. “Shut it, we have a situation.” She moved towards and out the door, without giving the boy a chance to speak.
Even with near about the whole Great Hall trying it still took them about 7 minutes to get the doors open. Ron called out as the students spread out, “Now remember if you find Malfoy, for the love of Merlin, don’t attack him or I’ll hex your ass.”
Tawy nodded, “I’m glad you’ve made friends.” She opened the door to her office, gesturing them in ahead of her.
He really wanted to go. It was where his parents had gone. It was also where his older brothers had gone. Well they weren’t really his older brothers, but he’d always thought of them as his older brothers, even after their marriage. Severus and Sirius weren’t really their names either but that’s all he’d ever called them.
“You won’t.” Harry felt sure, but all the same hoped he wasn’t wrong. He wanted to tell Draco he’d always have him but wasn’t sure how that would go over or even how to explain. Harry did know he didn’t want Draco to move away and nearly didn’t let him go when he started to pull back. Harry glanced down to where Draco’s hand stayed in his. He felt something begin to burn in his chest, something he hadn’t felt in a long time. Harry thought it might be hope.
Hermione looked from one brother to the other knowing she’d missed something between them, but if it helped, she wouldn’t dig. Instead, “There’s no way Harry could ever be just anything with Malfoy.”
Draco paled. That had been most unpleasant, and he didn’t think he could do it again. The very thought made his breath catch.
“Sit down and listen to me, because I’m not releasing the doors until I’ve had my say.” He crossed his arms.
Shacklebolt tilted his head with a curl of lip that was neither a smile nor a grimace. “The Malfoy’s are next up on the block after lunch.”
Lucius nodded. He still seemed unsettled but resolute, “of course you’re right. Any advantage we can give ourselves we should.”
“Did you ever play any muggle games when you were little? Maybe your friends knew some.” Boy had some talent in drawing, she watched him, teaching himself to size his lines.
Bear nodded and both men left to start on their part of the plan, next to Tawy, Helen straightened. “I’ll go grab the first batch of potions. We might as well get them in him before he’s awake enough to really taste them.”
“Nope.” Harry popped the p and bounced on his toes. “But you’re going to give us a couple joints and somewhere safe to smoke them and we’ll answer near about anything you want.”
Ben believed it. He’d been freaked out since that lunch. When that kid said he could hold the curse. Ben knew he hadn’t been lying. He’d been torn between questioning and staying away from them ever since.
“Doubtful. There they’ll just fear you less and stalk you more. You are the Victor of a war after all. Not to mention the first years.”
Harry opened the door to their room, looking around as he entered, a habit he’d picked up and hadn’t put down after the war. Once he was sure the room was clear, he turned his back to it and continued walking backwards, “I wasn’t kidding Draco. You can be scary. I love that about you.”
Harry glanced at the byline, and sure enough Hermione’s name looked back at him. He skimmed the article. He read about the paperwork filed with the ministry when he and Draco were 15, along with their classmates, which marked their magic ability as slightly above normal. Then he read of the original paperwork found in Dumbledore’s office, which not only proved Dumbledore falsified ministry paperwork, but that he and Draco were quite a distance away from normal. Hermione made great pains to explain why Dumbledore might have done such a thing and had downplayed the idea of them having such a magical ability having any meaning. Harry had read her words enough to know it came from her. Still damn-it. He threw the paper onto the table. “It says our scores were above average that’s it. Doesn’t mean anything.”
“Harry, Draco, thank you for joining us. Please take your seats and we’ll get started. In the effort to save time, let’s remember the privacy hex I spoke of last group. Now, who’d like to start?”
Draco turned his hand and griped Harry’s. He felt something, a shock, something falling into place. Draco wasn’t sure what it was, but whatever it was, it tied him closer to Harry and that was alright.
“And sometimes, when they didn’t want her worthless ass, she’d sell me to get them.” She seemed to be bragging about it. Daring them to say something.
Andromeda Tonks listened to her solicitor and wished she could claim she was the least surprised, but she wasn’t. She could allow this, or she could fight and be fighting for not only Draco but Teddy as well. She eyed the contract guaranteeing her guardianship of Teddy. She didn’t have a bigger fight within her right now. She’d given Draco a chance, saved him from a certain criminal sentence. She couldn’t face even the idea of losing Teddy. She hated it and knew she’d feel guilty for years to come, but she signed the paper giving her Teddy and giving up any claim to Draco.
Zacharias’ scowled deepened. He’d left the D.A. and Hogwarts before the final battle. He needed something to distinguish himself before school’s end. Potter and Malfoy’s friendship would do that. The reporters didn’t even know his name, that did not bear well for his future. He thought furiously, but there was nothing for it, he had no rebuttal, frustrated he gritted out, “And Malfoy, he your best mate too?”
Ron rolled his eyes, nodded his thanks to Zabini for the drink, “I don’t know why we ever broke up. You obviously hold me to such high standards.”
Harry was more than happy to. He halfway listened as Clara stumbled through a story about her mother’s love of stinging hexes, which sounded better than his Aunt’s love of pans honestly. Clara reminded him a lot of Luna with her long blonde hair and odd color choices. Clara trailed off and Murphy spoke to her, while the others gave some feedback, which led into Ella talking. Harry couldn’t have remembered any of it under hex really. It didn’t sound nice; none of it, but Harry found himself just glad he didn’t have to say anything. He didn’t want people to think he was trying to one up them.
Neville slipped it back into his pocket. He’d kept it with him, half afraid it would light and half hoping it did. He couldn’t imagine what Dumbledore could have planned so long after his death, but it would have to be good or hopefully good, important.
“You sure you don’t mind keep an eye out?” Harry asked again, as he stood next to the table, looking down at her even as Draco tried to lead him away.
Draco could tell more money had gone into Mandy’s one room than several other rooms combined. Somehow that was significant, Draco could tell that, but not why.
She dropped her head onto his shoulders. He could feel her retaking her strength and as her tears dried, Lucius froze his rage into ice he could use.
Harry didn’t even identify who had called out, just that the whispers of agreement moved quickly around the room, but even they puttered off into shock when Harry laughed. He chuckled even as he said, “do you honestly think that Dumbledore didn’t know? Really? The man knew when you farted and you think he didn’t know Malfoy was working on the fucking cabinet?” Harry straightened and said in an eerie reminder of Dumbledore, “sometimes young Mr. Potter awful things have to happen and we have to let them so the next stage may occur.” Harry scowled.
Teddy nodded. “You’re the only person with that tat that isn’t wanted, dead, or in Azkaban. They don’t give a shit about Voldemort, they’re supporting you.”
Molly frowned and rubbed her forehead wearily, “Bad off then. We knew there would be some repercussions. Ron’s,” she took a deep breath, “he’s not well. Something called PTSD they tell me, the muggle-born healers, there’s no cure, no potion. They broke up, Ron and Hermione, I’d thought, well I thought I’d have weddings to plan but all I have is broken.” The tears gathered in her eyes. Minerva moved from around her desk and took the chair closest to Molly, moving it even closer and comforted the woman with a soft hand and no empty words. Molly gripped her hand.
Draco brushed his cheek with his fingertips. “You have no idea Potter.” He kissed where his fingers had been. “Yes, of course braid.”
Harry wasn’t sure that’s where he wanted to go but, by the time he’d finished the thought, he was already there. He sighed and followed Ron in. Hermione leaned in, “Ginny’s not here.”
to say. Now they’re supposedly at a posh resort becoming best mates.” Mandy supplied. “Or something to that affect.”
Hence it was a strangely different Draco Malfoy (ex. child icon of pure blood ideals) who’s picture was splashed across the wizarding papers, while sneaking into Gringotts. This Draco Malfoy wore Louboutin shoes, dark sunglasses, and a muggle shirt declaring someone Queen.
Murphy sighed. “I’m not giving up on them. They’re clearly damaged, but how can I ask them to share, when whatever they share traumatizes the other kids. I can’t even relate to what they’ve been through.”
“Pleasure. What you want to do yeah, is go right over to the table there, against the wall. You’ll see a girl sitting there alone, light brown hair, chin length. That’s my sister, Mandy. Your boys are there.”
At that moment Mandy believed everything, every crazy seemly impossible byline she’d ever read. She had to force herself to understand that these two were the same two she’d brought here. They just didn’t look anything like two ‘not so powerful’ wizards. No this was ‘The Savior of the Wizarding World’ and ‘The Dark Lord’s Torturer’ and around them the room tore itself to shambles. The practice dummies danced with the spells that hit them, each jerking with dark magic. A table against wall flew up and then towards their viewing window.
“Potter, I always want you, but I’m not much of a fighter. I’ve always just done the least painful choice or what my parents demanded. I’ve had to face some nasty truths about myself and I’m not sure if I know how to be strong.”
as all this sitting and waiting serenely while the courts held them up was nerve-racking. His mother was so still beside him, though sometimes she would stroke a lock of his hair. His father was at the small table speaking lowly with their head solicitor.
“If you say so Draco. I just think they should pay.” Pansy wasn’t used to a Draco that didn’t want payback but, as he smiled towards Potter, she thought maybe he had other things on his mind.
Harry whistled lowly, skipping over the English manor, telling himself that hopefully one day he’d be able to explain it to Draco. “How loaded are you?”
Hermione looked down the table, towards George, who hadn’t looked up from his paper. Feeling   her eyes, he lifted his head. “The Ministry took Harry and now the papers are all claiming he’s off making best mates with the Malfoy kid. Someone official fed that line to them, they’re all repeating it. We aren’t allowed to know where Harry is or what they’re even doing to him. Therapy? We’re all in group therapy through Hogwarts, why they couldn’t go there? We know Harry and at least understand that Malfoy kid. We’re more likely to help them than anyone.”
Tawy raised an eyebrow, even as she did as she’d been asked. She appreciated the gesture even if Draco couldn’t.
‘I don’t know what’s supposed to happen,’ George had said, ‘Ron doesn’t know either. He just told me he received a letter from Dumbledore, and you know how he is, all it said was the deluminator would light the way when it was time. Ron was afraid to take it with him to Australia, so he left it for me to watch, but I have a feeling this has something to do with the rest of it, ah so, you’d better take it. At least till Ron and Hermione return.’
It was Draco that Harry looked to though. Draco smiled and brushed his lips against Harry’s. “Of course, I am.”
Ella giggled. “I’d stare at both but yeah I could question Potter. All the papers say him and Ginny are over.”
Tawy set her tea aside and grasped his hand. “Don’t try, you can’t, no one can, but we can listen and we can help. They’re never had adults that acted like it. Never had adults they could trust to help them. We need to show them that we’re worthy of trust. It’s going to take time.”
Tawy took a deep breath. She wasn’t sure what had set off the alarms, but neither boy was answering the door. She’d have to go in but she wasn’t going to do so with half the staff looking over her shoulder. She looked to Bear, thankful he’d been here, he nodded and took an arm folded stance before her, blocking both her and the door from view. She took another deep breath and released it slowly as the door opened beneath her hand.
to protect Malfoy. The only reason Mrs. Malfoy lied about my death was in order to find him. Malfoy pretended not to know who we were, knowing it could cost him his life. He
“It’s okay,” Harry said, though he was still hanging onto his boyfriend and didn’t look her way, “you weren’t to know. It’s fine.”
Draco frowned. “I think, okay I know, sometimes I acted worse to get your attention. I don’t know to handle shite Potter. I strike out when I get scared and I was scared for a long time.” He sighed, “fuck, muggles scare me. I don’t know anything about them, just what my parents said and that wasn’t right. I’m trying Potter.”
The boy turned towards her and she waved her hand at him. He pointed at himself, Violet nodded, but it wasn’t until the brunette girl next to him shoved him that he came over.
Draco shrugged. “I used it because I was supposed to and,” he smirked at his apple, “it pissed Weasley off.”
“You’re the only one marked. The only one our age in the inner circle, because he had an unhealthy fascination with you.” She tapped her finger against the table, marking her points. “He got that fascination because Lucius and Narcissa let him see you. Had they hidden you away, he would have never seen you to get fascinated with in the first place. Draco you were there, and you damn well shouldn’t have been.” Pansy had thought about this a lot. She had thought about it every time she’d seen Draco’s picture recently, so daily. “You’re beautiful and powerful. They were stupid if they didn’t think that would grab his interest. And neither Lucius nor Narcissa are stupid. Their egos were just too big. They thought they could flaunt you in front of him and still protect you.”
“Enough Ben.” Harry turned to see a man with two more girls and another boy, “Take your seat Ben.” The man stopped next to them. Harry glanced up at him. He had gray streaking through his brown hair and beard. He seemed kind, even while he was glaring at Ben.
Once the transfiguration was complete, at her age she couldn’t just throw herself to the floor as the boys had done. She watched for a few minutes. They were just so into their play. It was nice. She wondered how long it had been since they’d played at all. “Okay Draco, I’m going to put a privacy shield up for Harry and me. Please keep colouring and I’ll be right with you.”
He smiled at her and she mentally upped the number of hexes girls were going to cast to get this one’s attention.
Hermione was much more circumvent about her body’s complaints, but she too was glad they were taking a break.
Lucius scowled at the newest missive from his barristers. He didn’t want to settle. He wanted that rag’s building burnt to the ground. He shoved the whole thing aside and picked up the latest from his ‘friends’ in the ministry. It seems there were fractions, underling and hiding with the ministry's infrastructure. His son and Potter were in the middle of power struggles that would spell out the future for the whole Wizarding world and he doubted if they even knew it.
Harry looked to Draco with wide eyes. He’d thought it, thought maybe, but was so relieved when Snape had saved him, brought him back. “The bathroom? Right?”
“Draco nothing you say to me could hurt them. I’m bound by the Ministry, the Minister, the privacy act, and my own conscious to hold whatever you tell me to myself. What you say to me goes no further than you and me, unless
“He doesn’t ask for shit, all he wanted was that arse, should of just,” Ron pushed against the door, which wouldn’t give. He hit it with his palm, “Fuck,” he recognized Harry’s door lock charm, “we’ll be here for at least ten minutes.”
“Alright then, why don’t you take a seat on the bed and we’ll get underway.” She gestured towards the bed, standing back and offering him space.
McGonagall dabbed at her face discreetly and took a couple of deep breaths, “You know I never agreed with what you were asked to do. You or Mr. Malfoy, you were both horribly mistreated.”
Tawy waited as Molly, still red-faced and tight-lipped brought Ron and Hermione back into the room. Molly murmured softly to them and neither looked happy about what she was saying. Tawy could surmise Molly had put off their questions until later. Probably a good idea as she figured Harry’s young friends might not see the wisdom of what had been done. She approached slowly and cast her privacy bubble.
Harry quickly looked Malfoy’s way but could see nothing but hair. He swallowed thickly and looked to the Healer.
Molly recovered herself, straightening in her seat, “as long as Harry’s happy. That’s the main thing isn’t it? We’ll work on that Malfoy boy. I’ll have Harry bring him along for breaks. Poor child, what they did to him.” Molly shook her head sadly. “It’ll be a Merlin’s blessing to help him.”
Harry could only guess how expensive Malfoy’s robes were, but they were unfastened at the top. Harry could see, what he thought might be a St. Mungo’s tee-shirt underneath. He recognized the color from his own stay. Harry’s gaze flew back to Malfoy’s face, noting the silver eyes seemed glazed and a little unfocused. Malfoy didn’t seem as graceful as usual either.
Pansy looked to Narcissa, who waved a hand towards him. “She can’t say, it’s hush-hush and if she tells us, it’ll fall though. I must write him a letter.” She went to his desk and without care, he watched his paperwork scatter to the floor. “Quickly Lucius, she doesn’t have any time.”
“Just when I thought you couldn’t possibly get more Gryffindor,” Draco smirked at the deep red stone surrounded by dark yellow gold. The Potter signet ring was something to behold, it was very Potter.
Rey’s book was still on his lap, though he wasn’t actively looking at it. “Anyone with a bit of common sense would be afraid of the cruciatus or any of the unforgivables really.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “If I cut out all the people in my life, who have directly or indirectly tried to kill me, I wouldn’t have anyone.”
“They deserve to be remembered.” The remembrance of Sirius’ love was sometimes the only thing that got him going.”
“Ah, thanks,” Harry knew he was blushing and that the ladies noticed when they laughed good naturally. “We would like to take you out to lunch after this.” Harry figured they at least owed them a lunch for their patience. He had to force it a little, Violet seemed a little reluctant to eat on their dime, but Mandy talked her around and Harry nodded her along.
“I agree,” Andromeda gave the court a tight smile, “but let’s look at the whole picture and not just the little glimpses they would have you see. Let us see how guilty that child truly is.”
“He’s a fucking Duke!” Mandy spoke loudly, over them all and they all looked to around to see if anyone had noticed her outburst, especially the table across the room. Thankfully Potter and Malfoy weren’t paying them any attention.
Draco handed her the paperwork, “mine has a request for my muggle card credit. They should send it along. Just in case I find shopping enjoyable.”
Hermione scowled, “I looked it up during my short lapse of insanity, dating you.” She nudged him with a smile to take out a little of the sting.
She nodded and then dropped her eyes, curling her body into herself. She cupped her hands and brought her face down, whispering feverishly into her palms. She lifted her head and un-cupped her hands. There, no longer than her palm, was a golden handled dagger. “Will this work?” She held it up, the light glinted off the sharp blade.
The Judge interrupted, really not wanting to air the Ministries dirty laundry to foreign nationals, “Has been suspended from duties baring further investigation.”
“I don’t know what it’s called. You’re supposed to move parts of the bigger cube so the little blocks of colour match on each side.”
Neville could help but ask, “It doesn’t seem like either of you have aged a day.” Neville thought they looked even younger without the whole world on their shoulders.
Tawy cursed herself for not explaining better. She’d obviously fallen victim to the Malfoy iciness and hadn’t seen beneath to give him the reassurance he’d obviously needed. She grabbed a chair and sat before him and took his shaking hands. “Oh Draco, no one’s going to send you to Azkaban.” He didn’t cry and the tears that gathered in his eyes barely fell and those that did, he quickly wiped away. She could tell he was trying so hard to maintain his Malfoy shell, but between the potions and his overwhelmed nerves he was unable to completely push his tremendous feelings aside.
“Umm,” Rey started, but paused as their attention turned his way. He turned nearly as dark red as his hair, before he started again, “I know where there’s a knife, but I don’t know if,”
Tawy nodded. “I know Kelly. It’s alright.” Tawy patted the distraught woman once more before looking to an assistant, “where are my wards right now?”
They whispered, hidden in a muggle bed, buffered by soft blankets. Someone understood and between them, a closeness formed, they became a knot that would never untangle again.
Draco just wanted this over with and wouldn’t have cared how he felt if it meant getting this done. He thought perhaps the sleepy feeling was actually rather welcome considering. It helped with the nervousness and made his fear rather distant. He stood slowly, thankful for Bear’s steady hand, “I would very much like to continue your Honor.”
Murphy waited them out. “You should both get one in mind. Something you think you’d be able to tackle, a starting place. You don’t have to share why it’s a trigger.”
Draco shrugged. He was used to having no choices and knew no matter how the golden trio reacted this was not a real choice. If the Ministry wanted them, they’d have them, whether they wanted to go or not. “Yeah, alright.”
Tawy allowed them to wander awhile. Draco explaining to Harry, when he couldn’t guess what something did. She took one of the seats by the couch and studied them as they spoke. She couldn’t believe these boys were once so hateful of each other they’d legitimately attempted to murder the other. They seemed so very content in the other’s company. She watched with interest as Harry grabbed Draco’s hand to show him something and not only did Draco not pull away, but when they stopped, he leaned against Harry, who smiled and kept talking. Very interesting indeed, this development could be only good.
Ben grabbed one of Mandy’s magazines and started flipping through it as Mandy and Ella went back and forth.
Coming in so late meant Harry had missed putting together what was going on beforehand. He saw Andromeda and her solicitors ahead, standing together at the right, before the judge’s station. There had been a table with five seats transfigured to the left, where Hermione said they were putting the Malfoy’s and their solicitors. Harry was rather glad they had gotten rid of the tying chair. As due to the sheer number of people accused, the chair had been set aside to allow whole families to be sentenced at once.
Ron took a bite with a gleeful relish, “either, both? Hell all 3?” Harry put his sandwich down with a frown. For some reason, the thought of Draco Malfoy’s memories being forcible searched really bothered him. He tried to tell himself it was because of how he might be seen through Malfoy’s memories. Though he had already gone over the bathroom incident with the Minister and there wasn’t anything else he had to actually worry about. He glowered at his chips and picked at one or two before he said, “I don’t know. They were just so two-sided. One minute helping us, the next Voldemort, who knows?” Harry wished it was all over with, though thinking of Malfoy in Azkaban didn’t seem right.
“While I agree, the ideals he was taught were harmful,” McGonagall paused with a sad sigh, “I believe Andromeda has more concrete issues. She never spoke to me, but I believe she spoke to Albus. I think he helped her as much as he could, as far the law would allow. Albus was very invested in Draco’s future.”
Draco agreed as well, figuring he didn’t really have a choice and that seemed the best compromise he could hope for.
Harry laughed, both at the thought and the idea that Ginny and Neville were parents. “I wouldn’t know. Teddy is as close as we get to kids.” Harry gestured over to Teddy, who was standing next to Draco, talking to Hermione and trying not to look star struck.
“Harry?” Hermione stood from the table, Ron clumsily followed, and he looked down at them, his steady companions.
Draco couldn’t imagine it, but Pansy had mentioned they had joined a group. It was just a foreign idea.
Everyone finally believed him, about damn time, but Harry’s eyebrows crinkled in confusion. He didn’t understand why this was important or even mattered but he glanced to Draco, who seemed to be thinking something out, and answered. “I knew I could.”
Harry snorted. “I’ve explained it and he’s tougher than he looks. A little coughing won’t bother him.”
Charlie jumped slightly as he was yanked away. He turned to see Bill shaking his head, “a longer moment Charlie. They’ve been apart awhile and it’s been doing Ron no good to be separated from Harry so long.”
Healer Kelly frowned. “The privacy shield is active for an hour. I must ask you both to sit. No one is going to force you to say anything.”
Harry hadn’t been sure what to expect, but this reminded him of Dumbledore’s office. He loved it and wanted to look over every piece.
The one in the lead waved a parchment as he stormed forth. “Senior Judge Fumeurs! We have an injunction.”
Once in the hallway, Harry checked his band. “Do you wanna go to the library until we have to go to Healer Tawy?”
“Yeah, hi,” Harry mumbled, slouching down in his chair. Next to him, Malfoy, perfect posture, nodded to her.
“Thank you, so kind, you arse.” He nudged Draco with his shoulder. Draco nudged back. “How come you don’t mind me touching you?”
Jeannie looked to the boy with the dark blonde hair and silver eyes. She could already see the girls going absolutely out of their minds, the boy was gorgeous. He had also adapted better than his mother to the muggle styles, already wearing designer casual with an easy air.
Murphy started talking even before they sat down, not giving any room for questions, they’d already been told not to ask.
Minerva leaned forward, “Molly, there will be no ‘working’ on that boy,” she set her tea aside, “Tawy made it very clear she would not tolerate anything of that nature. Also, I don’t believe Harry will be allowed to other student’s homes for any breaks. It would be best not to extend the invitation.”
was supposed to be here. The Malfoy’s were there with their solicitor. Draco was speaking quietly with his mother. Mrs. Tonks and her head solicitor waited on the other side of the room. The Judge waited them out from behind his desk as everyone took seats or stood. Harry chose to stand in the back, thankfully Ron and Hermione stayed close. After several long minutes, Healer Tawy and Minister Shacklebolt joined them.
Harry didn’t know which of them flinched harder at Ben’s description. He twisted his wrist in Draco’s light grip and grasped his arm whispering quickly. “Hey that’s not who we are.” Draco nodded but it pissed Harry off how all the humor had slid right off Draco’s face. Harry stopped himself from rampaging over. He was hoping one of them would say it was for sure weed. That he could get behind. Merlin knew if anyone needed a good high it was them.
Harry hadn’t even realized he’d closed his eyes. He readjusted, sitting up and glancing over to see Draco, alert and narrow-eyed.
Judge Fumeurs picked up his glasses and leaned forward. “We have found sufficient indication though medical analyses to conclude these boys are legally incompetent. They’ve been so twisted around by every adult around them they don’t know which way is up. The Ministry has the legal right to take them into guardianship within the confines of what is written there. Healer Robertoun will not give her ‘opinion’ on the state of their competence when questioned, but a professional diagnosis. The Malfoy’s parental rights have not been terminated as it stands right now, in the future, they may regain guardianship.” He nodded to Kingsley, who sighed heavily but removed several rolls from his robes and passed them out.
Harry rubbed his face and cringed at the heat he could feel rising on his cheeks, “you heard me, we have a lot in common and I hate how they treat you.”
“I’ve known.” Draco said quietly. “I’ve always known. I could see the difference between how other people treated their children and how my parents treat me.”
Draco nodded but he was frowning. He’d always cared what people thought of him. It was another hard lesson to learn that he shouldn’t. That he couldn’t, if he ever wanted to separate himself from their expectations.
The red faded, and Harry lowered his wand. “Oh ok,” from petrifying icon of power to sweet teenager in one tense second.
Draco stared at him but then tried the drink, then another sip. Harry grinned as Draco drained the can.
“Harry would never forgive us if we didn’t,” Seamus laughed, as he opened a random classroom door for them to meet in.
Draco smirked slightly, if a smirk could be classified as friendly this was one, “Of that I'm sure.”
It was small and cramped, lived in, but it looked homely. Though it looked nothing like it, it reminded Harry of the burrow. He looked around, “it’s great.”
Tawy nodded. “And he was raised by death eaters, his go to spells are going to be different than most other people. I promised him, no one would send him to Azkaban and I meant it Harry. He’s not in trouble.”
A knock at the door interrupted what Ron was sure was more bullshit. Ron stood to greet Hermione, smile at the ready, but it wasn’t Hermione.
Belinda’s eyebrow rose, “I would like to remind you of the oath I took to be allowed into this room as I ask, is that something they’d be interested in?”
Then she started in on her unmovable plans for the future and he remembered why he’d gotten out while he could.
The rest of the group was ahead of them and going the same way, though they made sure to stay far ahead of them. Harry noticed Ella looking back towards them once or twice.
He sat up and brushed some hair from his face. Tawy helped by grabbing the mass of white blonde and quickly made a messy loose braid. “There you go,” she grabbed his clothes, the well-made dress pants, the tailor-made white button down, the dark green tie, and ridiculously expensive robes.”
Harry didn’t care, she could say it 50 more times if they still got to leave. He asked her about somewhere to send owls from and a place to meet their friends at.
Neville grinned, “Bloody hell, good on Harry.” He raised his half-empty mug in a prideful salute, “I’m glad he got his man.”
“Somewhere I can’t leave, somewhere where people are going to make it their business to tell me what to do.” Harry said lowly, comforted by the feeling of magic around him.
He took a deep drink of port and shook his head. The Ministry had always been fools and this time… well he wished the Ministry luck in the endeavor.
Harry raised an eyebrow. He wasn’t sure why she was attacking them. Like she wanted them to try and top her pain.
Molly scowled, she had been told Harry had many varied problems, but this was the first time anything so serious had been announced.
The Judge’s speech paused Molly’s search into her bag for the paperwork that allowed her to speak on Harry’s behalf, her temporary papers were now worthless. There was nothing to be done. The Ministry had completely sideswiped her. She’d had no idea they could take custody or that they’d planned to. She glared at Kingsley, who blankly stared her down.
Draco chuckled. “I have no idea Potter. I know most people touch each other all the time. My friends have tried it with me, but I didn’t like it, so they stopped.” Harry started to lift his head. Draco stopped him. “But I’m willing to try with you too Potter. I’ve never had someone of my own either. I like it when you touch me. I don’t seem to have boundaries with you.”
“She’s right,” Seamus added, “We know the ministry is up to something, what with this resort bollocks. Ron told us what they did. How they just took them.”
She had to lean in to hear him, “yes, it is.” He seemed almost drunk with sleepiness, blinking and swaying, “Draco, did you know you had a hard time waking up after dreamless sleep potions?” He nodded, “why didn’t you say anything?”
Tawy tapped the dress shoes with her wand and transfigured them into a pair of trainers. She looked over his green tee-shirt and scrub pants. There was no way she was going to get that boy back into those stuffy clothes and get back to court on time, as it was he was going back a little groggy and a lot late.
Tawy nodded. “Alright, I understand. Though I think the trauma group would be productive and you should go, maybe just to shock them?”
Tawy quickly nodded, “of course, yes.” She received their wands and carefully pocketed them as the boys took off at a near run. She waited until they were gone before she turned on her colleagues.
“Thank Merlin. I thought I had missed you.” He looked the other boy over. Malfoy looked okay, beyond some dark circles under his eyes.
Hermione looked up to him, he nodded his head towards the door. She followed his nod to see Pansy and Blaise entering and frowned herself. They’d had to do the whole thing without them and their say-so over Malfoy. They’d had to practically throw Harry and Malfoy’s relationship in everyone’s face several times to back everyone off and it hadn’t been fun. “Let’s go see where they’ve been hiding.”
“It’ll be very bad for us cause if anyone besides their friends see them. We’re going to have very large wizard problem.”
“I think we’re done.” Harry stood. He reached out for Malfoy and was gratified when Draco grabbed his wrist and allowed himself to be pulled up. “Don’t ask things you don’t really want the answers to.”
Hermione thought they should wait until court was closer to opening the session to avoid the reporters. Ron thought they wouldn’t get good seats if they waited. Ron wanted to be close enough to see Malfoy squirm. They compromised Ron and Hermione went ahead early, while Harry found himself sneaking in just as the Grand Wizengamot took their seats. He slumped between his best friends just as Judge Fumeurs started the session.
Ron’s dragonhide boot pushed against the table as he balanced his chair on the back legs. His eyebrow rose, daring Smith to deny it, “Why in the muggle hell would I do that to my best mate?” His wand twirled between his fingertips, a move that looked graceful and easy now, but Hermione knew it had taken hours of work, while sitting a tent and trying not to worry.
“He made me sit on his lap sometimes. When he called me pretty, my skin crawled and they told me not to upset him.”
“Yep.” Harry nodded, the long white strands running though his fingers. “I’ll help keep it out of your way. I can learn lots of braids and stuff.”
Siri and Sev didn’t talk about their past and they had never mentioned going back to Britain. Hence, as much as he wanted to go Hogwarts, he would never hurt them as so many had. So Teddy put the letter aside, resigning himself to attending another school.
Pansy decided it was worth it. She was late meeting with the other three and the last to arrive. They had decided on a circumvent number of people. Everyone wanted to go see them, but it was decided Ron and Hermione, she and Blaise would be the only ones to go. They didn’t know what kind of shape Potter and Draco would be in or how they would be feeling, hence the fewer the better. She explained why she was late and then, made them even later, by having to relay any fears that she had told the Malfoy’s anything. She hesitated but then told them about the chain. She pulled it from her pocket and pulled it back when Hermione reached for it, “I told you what would happen if you touched it.”
Draco shook his head, “but that was for my safety. They had to, I broke through it a lot, can’t stay under.  And I couldn’t, not,” He broke off unable to put into words all the things he couldn’t handle when the Dark Lord had lived in their home. The imaginations of those in the courtroom quickly began to speculate.
“Alright.” Draco offered. He wasn’t sure what to say, usually breaking something was followed by a lot of promises to be careful and getting far away. Tawy wasn’t moving though and Draco didn’t think she’d take it well if he left, so he was at a loss.
“Oh.” Mandy didn’t know what to say. She wasn’t sure what the deal was. “You might want to go get ready. We can’t make Violet late for work.”
Molly sorrowfully turned to her once change. “Harry, if you’ve been siphoned. Perhaps this for the best. Just until you get used to things mind.” She wanted to tell him he could come home after, but she couldn’t even offer that. She didn’t know what they could do to fight this. She did know if she couldn’t get Harry to agree, the Ministry would take him by force and that would only strengthen their conviction.
Harry chuckled, “We’re not hiding really. We’re just getting away and this was the only place I could think of that didn’t involve seeing other people.” Harry glanced around the small dark room of their wardrove. They had just enough room for the both of them to sit together in a corner.
Mrs. Tonks looked as regal as Harry had ever seen her and still so much like Bellatrix that it gave him the shivers. Through now he had enough practice to see the differences as well. She nodded to him as she passed and he returned the gesture, though he was as confused as the rest of the room.
They had tea and cakes. Harry ate the cakes with the hand not occupied holding Draco’s. He didn’t mind Narcissa so much. She attempted to include him some in the conversation, but didn’t seem to mind his near silence. He may have glanced towards Lucius once and that was about all the Lucius he needed to see. Draco squeezed his hand and Harry knew he was attempting to reassure him and it worked. Draco’s feelings washed over him and Harry didn’t care nearly as much that Lucius sat across the table, only that Draco sat next to him.
“That didn’t sound like we’re leaving anytime soon.” Draco whispered, his ability to read between the lines had been fine-tuned in the last year.
Tawy stayed on the floor, her hands wide. She turned to the others, “back off.” Most of the group quickly stood and scrambled out of the room. She turned back to Harry, “Harry, what’s going on?”
The first thing Harry noticed was the hair. It was long and thicker than he remembered, still nearly white and really lovely, flowing halfway down Malfoy’s torso. Harry touched where his own hair had grown over his collar. He stared at Malfoy’s face, he looked tired and his wide gray eyes had dark circles beneath them, which was about the same as the last time he’d seen him. Malfoy looked thinner and paler if that was possible. He was the same height though while Harry had a growth spurt, of at least a couple of inches since he last saw Malfoy, he thought they’d be the same height now.
Draco gnawed at his bottom lip, stomach flipping painfully with each movement in the water. Terry was half-asleep beside him, and Luna’s head had fallen onto his shoulder almost as soon as the second task started. Harry had disappeared into the lake almost thirty minutes ago, and there was no sign of him coming up soon. Fleur let out a dry sob a couple of seats down, just as Draco felt the tang of blood seep onto his tongue, likely from biting too hard on his mouth.
They played around with her appearance for a little longer, only stopping when the bus pulled to a halt outside a gloomy-looking Muggle street. Severus stood up and headed for the doors, Draco and Tonks just behind him, chatting the entire time. As they got off, he gave the street a proper look, and felt a strange familiarity to the place, though could not precisely place why.
“Yes, yes, alright. You can have the wretched book, as long as you don’t…” He visibly shivers, hastily shoving a few galleons into Borgin’s hands. “Don’t ask that stupid oaf anything.”
Draco’s not sure how he hadn’t come up with it himself. Potter and Weasley hitched a ride to Hogwarts in a flying car, slammed right into the Whomping Willow, and then got quite the earful from Mrs Weasley the next morning. It all played out like some book.
“My apologies. I think my father might’ve…” He grabs the strange book. It was definitely a diary of sorts. Not one of Draco’s (thank Merlin) but he still decided to take it back. “Yes, sorry! My father must’ve accidentally misplaced it. Goodbye!”
A painfully long moment passed. Finally, Dumbledore stood and gestured for them to speak closer to the entrance of the maze. “I assume you would like privacy?”
“I’m not,” Draco denies hotly. It’s a lie. They’d both witnessed it last night. “At least, I wasn’t… I haven’t since I was nine.”
Draco shoved his diary into his school bag, along with his quill and ink. He could see Terry eating a few seats away, but they'd yet to talk this term. The whole thing confused Draco— he'd been getting iced by a lot of the Ravenclaws lately, and he has a feeling it's got something to do with the gossip that Zabini was talking about. Still, he has too much pride to actually ask the blasted git about it.
Dumbledore murmured something to the newcomer, which made him nod his head. They shook hands, and then the man was moving over to the empty seat which the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher usually sat in.
Professor Moody had a real rough, confident voice as if he was always nursing a sore throat. Although, it could've just been a side-effect of constantly yelling, 'CONSTANT VIGILANCE' at them.
“Good morning!” a misty, familiar voice interrupted. Professor Trelawney seemed to have appeared from the shadows. A pair of Gryffindor girls made excited sounds. “I have decided to begin teaching you of the intricate art of crystal-gazing early. I sincerely doubt any of you will get it on your first try, but I am anxious to give you a sufficient amount of time to practice before exams!”
Black been a Gryffindor, too. Draco found out about that after raiding his mother's closet as a child and finding photos of both Sirius and his little brother at Hogwarts together. Sirius had been wearing a red tie and was likely only in second or third year at the time. Draco thinks they're a bit alike, in the breaking away from family traditions way— not the murdering Muggles and following the Dark Lord way. A shame, really, that Sirius wasn’t actually as cool as those photos made him out to be.
She strode over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and disappeared down the hole. The class watched in amazement, right until Granger was completely out of sight. Thankfully for Draco, everyone then became too distracted to even remember what had started the whole thing. Potter, however, did not. He turned to Draco, and said, “Did you really See something?”
“It’s amazing, Harry,” Draco says, not even noticing his use of Potter’s last name. It only seems fair-- Harry has shown him something personal; something risky. Wizards worse than Draco would try to steal it. “Who gave it to you?”
Harry only managed one song before slipping away, just as he spun Luna around a couple of times. Draco pulled her back in and smiled down at her dizzy expression. "You good?"
experience flying to join the Quidditch team. Honestly, what had they expected? It’s only the first match of the year and Potter has already gone and gotten himself injured. Then-- and this is the funny part-- he’d gone and had all the bones in his arm removed! By accident, sure, but what kind of idiot lets Lockhart cast spells anywhere near them? If Draco had been able to reach the field faster, he could’ve stopped it, but the Ravenclaw watchtower is so far away from all the action…
"What? No. I wasn't at Hogsmeade," Draco blurted. He clapped a hand over his mouth when he realised his mistake.
"Ooo, aren't you tough?" said Septimus, and Draco imagined the man waving his little walking stick around. "Don't you dare open that door! There are the darkest artefacts hidden in there..."
Truthfully, he had a session with Terra that day, but he wasn't prepared to admit it to anyone. It would be seen as a weakness, and Malfoy's didn't do weaknesses.
“‘Kay,” Draco says. He attempts to stand but immediately falls back down. A numb pain shot through his leg. “Not to be a downer, but I think Riddle broke a bone.”
He moved to look out and investigate, but Luna held onto his wrist before he could stand. She shook her head minutely.
He pauses. Draco spots the familiar figure of his father approaching them, and immediately remembers what he’d come over here to do. Not bicker with Potter, but try to warn them. He glares at his feet, ashamed.
He slumped onto Harry's chest and yawned into the warmth he found there. "I'm just gonna sleep right here. Yes, right here."
Sometimes, Draco wished he had never befriended Harry Potter, simply so he wouldn’t have to get caught up in the inevitable drama that came with each year.
Another unexciting week passes. People begin moving around in groups, as if that would help. Draco thought the thing attacking students would probably enjoy a larger meal, so they were just doing it a favour. He told this to his diary, who replied and told him not to worry about it. Not the greatest advice, but he forgets about it in the next hour.
There’s some halfhearted grumbles, but they eventually go back to bed. Draco still has his eyes closed.
Yet, when February came, the broomstick was returned and deemed perfectly safe. Draco finally thought the three would get over their little spat, only for Weasley's ugly rat to go missing the same night. He claimed Granger's cat had stolen it.
“That’s Hagrid!” The boy finally sounds pleased. “He’s the groundskeeper at Hogwarts. Isn’t he cool?”
Quietly, they moved out into the hall and took the stairs up onto the second floor. Draco was afraid one of the floorboards would creak and that evil man would jump out, blasting them with green light.
“We offered to help,” Weasley interrupts, his eyes narrowed in challenge. Draco frowns. “Come on, Harry. We better get to the library. We’ve only got half an hour before lunch.”
Where the blanket doesn’t fully cover him, a light breeze floated across the room and takes shelter, leaving a ghostly imprint of goosebumps on Draco’s skin. He shivered and pulled the blanket tighter around him, but it does little to return him to that blissful state of deep sleep— the curse of consciousness had already taken root, which meant he could either waste a few minutes in bed or get up to have a shower and prepare breakfast.
When Draco finally reached the Hospital Wing, Madam Pomfrey didn’t bother with too many questions and just set to work at fixing Ron’s broken bone. It looked painful, so he looked away and hoped the others would be okay. He had been a bit mad when they attacked Severus in the shack, but it would be worth it to let Sirius walk as a free man, again. No innocent witch or wizard deserves to rot in Azkaban for the rest of their lives.
“I don’t know. I guess because you’re my friend,” Harry answers nonchalantly. “I was gonna look around the school with it. Wanna come?”
Half an hour passed like that; Draco calling for patients, figuring out their problem as quickly as he could, and sending them back with a cure or some advice (“Derek, this isn’t a magic problem. You’ve just stained your skin with hair dye.”), and then he’d call the next one in. At about 2 P.M., something finally interesting happened.
Ollivander disappears to the back and returns a beat later. “I haven’t sold a wand with this wood since I took over the shop, but perhaps…” He passes it over.
The library, usually, is pretty empty on Friday evenings, so it is with great surprise that Draco discovers Harry, Weasley and Granger huddled around a pile of books sometime in February. Their backs are turned away from him, practically begging to be snuck up on. And sneak up he did.
“Oh,” Draco said, surprised. He’d not seen anything about Potter’s resignation in the Daily Prophet. Did they not know, or had he simply missed that article? “My apologies, then.”
Draco chews on his bottom lip and trails after him. “I’m not sulking,” he argues. “But I thought we were going to buy my school books today, not get rid of a bunch of garbage you’re unnaturally attached to.”
Granger, in all her bushy hair and large teeth glory, lets out a loud sigh of relief at the sight of Draco. “My goodness, I’ve been looking for you everywhere! Harry and Ron are nowhere to be found, so I’m beginning to think that they’ve missed the trains. Hopefully they still have some brains left from last year and owled McGonagall for another way to get there, so I’ll-- Oh.” She stops her rambling very suddenly, breath coming fast. “I didn’t know you had a sister, Malfoy.”
It was, truthfully, quite embarrassing what had appeared inside the crystal ball. Draco was perhaps expecting images of war, or dead bodies strewn across a field, but instead, he’d seen something even worse. He’d seen an older Hermione Granger, perhaps seventeen or eighteen, with her arms locked tightly around Ron Weasley’s neck. They’d been
A dozen hands were shoved into the air, including Draco's own. He may have been freaked out by the man, but he wasn't about to miss out on potential house points ... Moody's magic eye darted around the room, before landing on Anthony Goldstein's outstretched palm. "You, boy?"
Draco startled back, reaching blindly for a tree to hold him up. The Dark Mark stared down at him, making the stars look green and cruel. The trees rustled as more people noticed the smokey skull come into existence. He squeezed his eyes shut, and bit down hard enough on his lip for blood to seep out. A terrible thought came to him as the darkness behind his eyelids hid the scenery around him; one that chilled him to his very bone— Lucius, Draco's own father, was probably out there, not helping to round up the rogue Death Eater's but aiding them, instead. He'd be fighting under the same moon, under the same stars that Draco was hiding under, without any care for the Muggles they were torturing.
Sometimes, Draco wished he had never befriended Harry Potter, simply so he wouldn’t have to get caught up in the inevitable drama that came with each year.
Somebody poked at his shoulder, and Draco hardly stopped himself from jumping in the air from fright. He turned, ready to scream at someone, only to come face-to-face with Blaise Zabini. His smug, big-headed smirk was as prominent as ever. "Morning, Malfoy."
much like him. She lacks all the Pureblood traits that Malfoy’s have spent endless decades working on, as well as most of the Black attributes from his mother’s side. “I’ve known her less than ten minutes, Granger.”
Wizards of all ages rushed past, yelling obscenities. He cursed himself and then stepped back inside. The tent was large, overly so, and empty. Lucius had disappeared sometime during the night, and his mother had run off somewhere as soon as the attack started, leaving Draco on his own.
a joke, but Draco knew the actual art of Divination wasn't. Wizarding history was filled with real prophecies and Seers. It was just at this point in them they'd gotten pretty unlucky with their fortune-tellers.
The rest of the morning went very enjoyably. So well, in fact, that Draco only shot the Ravenclaw one longing look! Terry had noticed and sent him a cheery wave in response. Once breakfast was over, Draco was forced to separate from the three. He had Muggle Studies, which Granger dropped in third-year, whilst they had Care of Magical Creatures. Briefly, he regretted never choosing it.
Harry had said Zabini had laid off them by the end of last year, but if he's back to being the school's bully— and specifically to Draco— then it would only add to the long list of problems that the Dark Lord had started... Draco licked his lips and straightened up, again. There was no point in dwelling in something that hasn't happened, yet. That went for everything else, too. Literally.
Draco immediately throws most of his weight on the man. It forces Severus to move slower, but if he didn’t Draco would definitely fall. Every limb feels heavy, like a bag of stones has been tied to each corner of his body. “Where are we going?”
The sight of the child snapped him out of his weird, Potter-induced daze. Breathing deeply, he said, “What is the problem today, Edward?”
Finally, they reached the castle entrance. He trailed after a group of gossiping sixth-years and was soon seated at the Ravenclaw table, stomach rumbling. Draco had only eaten a few Chocolate Frogs on the train, and as such was extremely hungry. Yet the feast wouldn't start till after the Sorting, which was always very boring. It was so repetitive— except for the Hat's song. This year, it sang a very long one, which made out Ravenclaw to be one of the better houses, Draco noticed (and agreed with). The cleverest would always be the best.
Slowly, cautiously, they make their way out from the gloomy place. Weasley meets them at the exit, along with a thoroughly confused Lockhart. At the sight of the professor, Draco felt another jolt of confusion-- none of this made sense. He also seems to be on the verge of fainting, with his leg getting worse with every step. “Hold on, I need a second.”
“It’s rude to walk away, you know.” Astoria grabbed onto his arm, halting his steps. He scowled and pulled away, ignoring the narrowed eyes that glared at him in response. “Could you just do me a favour?”
“You’re talking about Crouch, aren’t you?” Draco said, despite knowing full-well that Sirius wouldn’t want to talk to him. “Everyone’s saying he’s sick, despite having never been so ill to miss work before. Plus, he hasn’t been turning up for the tournament.”
Trelawney nodded, seeming disgruntled. Draco felt something roar inside him, like pity for Trelawney. It disappeared after a second.
The pub is built between a Muggle book store and record shop, as always. Draco avoided using Apparition to travel there, since the last time he had he accidentally landed on a man carrying a tray of drinks, which resulted in them both sticky for days.
Finally, lunch arrived. Draco’s feet were sore from walking around so much, and he’s not sure he could listen to another case of Accidental Magic even if it killed him.
Ron opened his mouth to reply, but a man appeared from somewhere and beat him to it. "Out of the way, Arthur," he said, and Draco recognised it to be Mr Crouch. They'd met hours earlier, before the game. "Which of you did it? Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?"
"Narcissa Black," he said, and waited for some kind of recognition. It didn't come. "Seriously? You don't know the Ancient House of Black? They're only, like, the most famous pureblood family ever!"
"Don't look so sad, Draco, the dementors aren't going to hurt you." Luna pulled him up, hand still holding his. "How about we get some chocolate frogs? I know you missed out earlier, and those always cheer you up."
Walking down the first set of stairs to the ground floor, Draco did his best to keep up with Severus' running dialogue.
The judges all looked at him. Draco stood his ground. His intuition, buried deep under his nerves and regret, let out a ripple of approval. “Sir, I needed to talk to you.”
Snape breathed heavily at him, and started walking up the stairs, arms put out in front of him. Draco cursed, and waited, and waited for the inevitable...
Moody clunked forward on his wooden leg, fake eye staring right through Draco's terrified face. "What are you afraid of, Malfoy?"
Harry spent the next day inside the Hospital Wing, along with the real Mad-Eye Moody. Mrs Weasley, her eldest son, Ron, Granger and Draco stayed with him the entire time. Even if Pomfrey had wanted them to leave, none of them would’ve budged.
She patted the side of his head and hurried him over to the train door. There was something far too knowing in her gaze. "You're a good boy. Don't lose that."
Later that evening, Draco arrived at the Entrance Hall to find a large crowd milling around a large sign hung up at the staircase. He pushed through the students, and read-out-loud what had been posted. "
“Neville kept forgetting the passwords, so he wrote them all down. Black got a hold of them,” Potter went on. “I think you were right about what you said months ago; about something deep inside the guy being wrong. He’s come all this way, but somehow mixed up the beds?”
His parents had tried getting him to talk about it with them and, on one particularly memorable occasion, a mind-Healer, but the only thing that really seemed to help was writing the dreams down. He has almost three full diaries worth, full of things that at first glance seem meaningless but always has Draco waking up screaming.
She was gaping now. Draco rolled his eyes. "Oh, don't look at me like that. I got really unlucky in the family department." He tapped his chin, pretending to think. "Let's see. Aunt Bella got herself locked up in Azkaban after torturing two Aurors, Sirius killed all those Muggles, everyone is obsessed with blood purity, and don't even get me started on what Grandfather Abraxas did to one of the—"
That makes sense. Probably a family heirloom of sorts, passed down from generation to generation… but it doesn’t answer the question of
Draco was sulking, he could admit it. According to Professor Flitwick, Umbridge has assigned him two week's worth of detention with her for threatening the livelihood of a teacher. He really hoped it didn't get back to Severus, somehow. "I didn't do anything, Granger. She asked for a prediction and I gave her one."
Draco swallowed nervously, resisting the urge to flee. Moody always made him feel queasy. "I mean no disrespect, Professor, but I really don't think that's any of your business."
"Sad?" Draco supplied. He got comments like these all the time, especially after the whole Boggart incident last year. "Well, unfortunately, that's just my face."
“Please don’t tell anyone. I’ve heard it’s not exactly... accepted among Muggles for boys to like other boys,” Draco said, afraid. Luna reached across the table and held onto his hands.
Draco almost got away with it. He hadn't run into any prefects or teachers on the way and was just approaching the first set of stairs leading to Ravenclaw tower, when he saw Professor Moody.
"Sirius Black," Draco said absently. Granger choked on her pumpkin juice. "Technically, it's first cousin once removed. Or was it third? Probably both, actually. Did you know his parents were second cousins?"
The boy made a strange face at the sound of his name. Draco mentally filed the moment away, so he’d remember not to use the name again.
"Defeated, huh?" Moody whispered, looking almost mad, before straightening up, again. "What are these nightmares about, Malfoy?"
He stares at the teenager who had spoken. He’s got handsome features, but the malicious emotion in his eyes ruins it. Draco’s mind, inexplicably, screams a name to connect with the boy.
Professor Trelawney hesitated, stiffening, and pulled her shawl tighter around her shoulders before murmuring. "I don't understand you."
Madam Pomfrey didn’t let him visit Potter, as the Hospital Wing was already overflowing with the entire Gryffindor team cooing over Potter by his bedside. So instead he’d been forced to retreat back to his dormitory, write a short passage in his diary, and then have a quick nap. When he woke up, it was much later, and Draco was standing dazed outside the girl’s bathroom. There weren’t any teachers around, fortunately, so Draco just rushed back to bed and pretended it never happened. He couldn’t remember ever sleepwalking before, which is a little worrying.
A fond feeling spread like vines across Draco’s heart. He smiled into his drink and said, “No, nothing wrong. Just thought it was time for a little change in scenery.”
Immediately she levitates him toward one of the beds, Potter and Weasley quickly following. “What a mess! What a mess! Someone go fetch Minerva, she’ll be in her office.”
"I've just noticed a lot of Wrackspurts floating around you lately, and didn't want you to be lonely," Luna explains, because she’s an angel and Draco loves her. "Are you sure, then?"
Potter tries running away. Draco grabs onto his hand and tugs him back. "Where are you going? The Duelling Club is at the Great Hall."
They chatted about nothing important for a few hours, and soon enough the train was pulling into Hogsmeade station, where a gaggle of eleven-year-olds immediately came pouring out and into the boats that would sail them across to the castle. A gush of frosty wind had Draco huddling closer to Luna for warmth. He noticed Harry, Granger, and Weasley doing the same a short distance away.
Harry hummed and scribbled something down on his parchment. Draco went to continue, but Umbridge was talking to Trelawney rather loudly, and it was impossible to not hear them. "You're great-great-grandmother was the celebrated Seer, Cassandra Trelawney, correct?"
"Well, it depends. Many would say mentally I have the mind of a child, but I was born in '72. Of course, there's also the fact I can appear as old as I like. Watch this!"
As if summoned, Helga appeared and weaved herself between his legs. She yawns at him, evidently having just woken up herself.
"I was trying to sneak out." Potter folded it up and stuffed it into his pocket. In his other hand, he held the map. "But if you're back early, we can just mess around for the rest of the day."
Unfortunately, Borgin notices. He smirks and takes on a look of triumph. Leaning forward eagerly, he gets into Draco’s space. “Young Malfoy, what is it you want to purchase?”
He’d been right. Back at his office, there was a whole lineup of people waiting to get diagnosed in the chairs Draco had set up in the corridor outside. Most of them looked like easy cases to solve, but a few were probably serious.
"You 'Ogwarts type are so uneducated!" a girl who had introduced herself as Fleur Delacour said. She had silvery blonde hair and was attracting a lot of attention. "At Beauxbatons, we are taught all about ze Goblet of Fire! Pah! And your French, eet is worse than my Eenglish!"
Draco wasn’t going to deny it. He screamed. Sirius Black’s grey eyes were familiar and filled with satisfaction.
Resisting the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose, Draco wondered what it was that he’d found so endearing about this awkward man back at Hogwarts. His bravery? His tendency to assume anything Draco associated himself with was evil?
Granger throws her head back and cackles, though he isn’t joking. Vampires are amazing; he’d thought so since his mother read Dracula to him for the first time.
"Quite the opposite," replied Luna, dreamily. She smiled. "It was really lovely, actually. Daddy's been very busy with work, but we planted some gurdyroots in the garden, you know. Hopefully, they'll be entirely grown by Christmas!"
He stuck his wand out in front of him, leaving it hanging for hardly a second before bringing it back to his side. The Knight Bus arrived a short wait later.
He felt, inexplicably, like crying. It explained a lot, though— why his house has been ignoring him, why students he's never even met before seem afraid of him. They're all under the assumption that Draco's going to become a fucking Death Eater. And Zabini had tried telling him... No, that wasn’t right. Zabini had been trying to
Five minutes later, Draco gapes openly at Potter. “Okay, wait. I need to recap. You killed the basilisk, got rid of the Dark Lord
For a moment, he wonders if the boy is having a stroke. Finally Potter says, “I can talk to snakes.”
Squeezing his eyes shut, Draco swiftly brings the wand down through the air. Immediately a cloud of white sparkles shower onto all their heads, while a lovely feeling of magic rushes down his arm.
They launched at Black as a group. Harry went for his chest, while Granger scrambled for their wands. Weasley, with his broken leg, staggered over and stopped Crookshanks from interfering. Draco got a hold of his wand and pointed it at the man. The others followed suit.
At dinner, he sits beside Potter and Weasley across from them. The professors sit further down the table, while other leftover students are positioned haphazardly around. The feast is large and seemingly never-ending, with a delicious apple pie to finish it off. It’s easily one of the better Christmas’ Draco has had, right up there with last year’s, when his mother ordered the elves to cook a few Indian dishes and decorate the Manor with glitter and hanging lights. Draco’s parents were in a happy mood, dancing and kissing the evening away. He doubts anything like that will happen again. He’s lucky to have even got presents from them.
Draco found Luna in a compartment at the end of the train, looking entirely well, if a bit peckish. She had sent him a short note promising she'd not been hurt during the Death-Eater attacks, but Draco couldn't help but worry. Sometimes Luna was so unaware of certain evils in the world, like how it was her classmates stealing her belongings and not some new creature her father had told her about. Hopefully, this year would be better. Draco's own third-year was far superior to his first two, after all.
Draco purses his lips. He’d pushed a lot of his friends away in the last few months--Vince and Greg, even Pansy-- in a last-ditch attempt to be left alone from their questions about his dreams. Pansy is dramatic about things as mundane as brushing her teeth, and both Vince and Greg would show an annoying amount of concern in their own, admittedly, unique way. His mother always tells him that he’s lucky to have such caring friends, but he couldn’t bring himself to agree. Now Draco was starting to regret it, since he no longer had any idea how to make conversation with someone his own age.
Draco almost refuses to repeat it. What the man had uttered, it was important. They were some kind of key for a lock that he hadn’t gotten his hands on just yet. But he has to tell Severus, or else his parents will be even angrier than they already are. “He said… he said ‘you are so small for a power so big’. Over and over again. And, the way he said it was pure
“Ron wanted me to forget you,” Potter confesses. Draco furrows his brows. Ron, Ron, Ron. Weasley? It must be. He thinks of that redheaded boy and all those stories his father had told him about the Weasley’s in the past. It’d make sense if this Ron character was trying to warn Potter off. Their families did
More voices came from ahead of him. It sounded like a group of French girls, and Draco could pick up on a bit of what they were saying. His mother had tried teaching him French from an early age, but it had seemed so useless that he'd stopped showing up for the lessons at some point. He could speak it alright now, as long as he did so slowly, but if you asked him to translate something written? It just wouldn't be happening.
“Well, not mine specifically. He’s been in the family for ages,” he says. “I’m sorry about this by the way. I can write a letter home. My parents will be able to order Dobby to stop bothering you.”
"That's no way to talk to a prefect." Zabini wet his bottom lip. "I just came to warn you about what some of the Slytherin's are saying."
James still looked annoyed but kept his mouth shut. Albus Scorpius and Lily grudgingly returned to where they had come from. Right before they totally went into the house, Draco added:
This time James didn’t yell or even pouted. He only quietly murmured but his voice showed that he was upset. Draco looked at his son, alarming. He was seriously worried now. That boy who was always full of confidence, saying he’s the most lovable being in the world, said that he’s loved less than his siblings. His baby James felt that he’s not loved! By Harry – his biological father, on top of that!
Draco had always been a bit nervous while being around the children. He was worried if the children would hate him for taking up their mother's place. When the Potter kids greeted him enthusiastically and welcomed him and Scorpius into the house, he was seriously overwhelmed with relief and happiness.
“It’s for the best.” Draco just shrugged. It’s really for the best. He doesn’t want more things to break, whether it’s Harry or himself.
), he and Harry tended to be stricter when it came to him. He cared greatly for the boy but he didn’t want to just push off his mistakes.
They had hated each other since eleven with a deep hatred. They had loved each other with all their lives.
Draco shook his head but couldn’t help but smile fondly at James. James looked so happy that Draco wanted to indulge him. However, it’s not a choice there.
Maybe this is just inevitable. Maybe Draco should have known this would happen. Harry may not, but Draco should have known. He’s a Slytherin, and Slytherins don’t act before they think. He shouldn’t feel hurt or surprised now.
Maybe that flame would really never burn out. Maybe it would be still as bright as ever. However, sometimes, it burns a bit too brightly. Too fiercely. To the point it burns them out.
for his pranks which often ended with the cry of one of his siblings, sometimes, all of his siblings.
From the very first day the kids welcomed him into their house with warm smiles, he had loved them as his own children. It actually proved as one more reason he was scared of making a mistake and being hated by them. Draco was also not very good at expressing his feelings, so he doubted the kids knew how much he loved them. No matter how many times Harry tried to reassure him that he was a good enough father to them and those horrible scenarios wouldn’t happen, Draco still couldn’t really get it out of his head. A failed marriage could greatly affect people’s belief of how solid a relationship was.
He and Astoria were in love, but apparently, just love wouldn’t be enough to save a marriage. Or maybe they just didn’t love each other as much as they thought, that Draco didn’t want to even consider. He didn’t want to think badly of his ex-wife and ex-marriage. Especially while the day Scorpius was born was the happiest day in his life. Draco mentally apologized to Harry for not considering their wedding as his happiest moment, although he thought Harry might have the same feelings. Kids were special, after all. That didn’t mean James, Albus and Lily meant any less to him though. And their wedding was one of his happiest days too.
continued Albus, following his brother’s example of stealing popcorn from Lily’s bowl while Scorpius was telling her
Sometimes, Draco still couldn’t believe how well his second marriage was going. When he started dating Harry, he was scared of how their relationship would affect the children. He would never forgive himself if because of him, Scorpius lost his first and closest friend. Thank Merlin that James, Albus and Lily were all generous kids.
, yelled James, which only earnt him a glance from Scorpius before he returned to his sister and said
James mumbled while purposefully scattering the weeds he had pulled out all over the ground. Draco rolled his eyes. James should know that would do him no good.
fairytale!), though, Draco didn’t understand. And so, he decided it was all Harry’s fault, just like how everything else that he didn’t understand was. At least, Draco wasn’t the one who read the kids Cinderella.
There’s no need for a wedding for Draco to know: he would never be able to leave Harry, until death do them part.
Draco was desperate. He would even beg, just so that James would believe that he’s treasured. A Malfoy should never beg, his father used to say so, but to hell with that! He’s also a Potter now, and Potters would beg if necessary, like how Harry practically begged Draco to marry him. Harry still complained about how difficult he was from time to time. It’s not Draco’s fault for being scared of one more relationship ruined after marriage though.
They continue kissing, only breaking up for air long later. Draco is sobbing out loud now. His hands fist in Harry’s shirt. The suitcase is lying on the floor, forgotten.
James raised his head so fast Draco was scared that he would hurt his neck. He was excitedly talking nonstop about how his afternoon would go without weeding the yard.
Draco and Harry had told James to stop with his pranks, at least while they were home, away from Hogwarts, but as if James would follow anyone’s order. That’s why James was there, weeding their backyard. As to why Draco was there too, well,
“Of course they are,” Luna replies. She tucks a strand of loose blonde hair behind her ear and continues. “Where do you think Bram Stoker got his idea from? Some wizards believe he was a vampire himself.”
They seem fidgety the whole evening. When Draco asks Weasley to pass him the pot of gravy, he flinches and spills it all over his own plate of food. Very strange. Very strange, indeed.
“Right, well,” Weasley continues. “After we found the note, McGonagall announced another student was attacked, but worse this time, ‘cause they’d been actually taken into the Chamber. Me and Harry snuck into the teacher’s office and found out the student-- you, obviously.”
Granger holds no such qualms, unsurprisingly. She’s squeezed into the crowd, practically drooling over the man-- Lockhart, the sign reads-- smiling prettily down at everyone. Draco glances at Lucius to find him glaring at the pack of Weasleys.
This leaves Draco feeling awfully uncomfortable and very alone as the remaining adults prodded at him.
Just as he was saying this, the morning owls arrived. They swooped over the table, dropping packages of all sizes and shapes down onto the students. Draco received his usual chocolate basket from his mother, and a special delivery of the latest Witch Weekly. Weasley goggled at it, and Harry looked on the verge of asking if Draco regularly got magazines for women delivered to him. Granger, however, looked suspicious. “What’s that for?”
Potter hums, knits their fingers together, and drags him through several corridors. They only need to head up one flight of stairs before arriving at the hall, where a few kids that are staying at school are hanging around. Potter makes a beeline towards two students talking with Hagrid near the front, his grip unrelenting in Draco’s hand. “Guys! Look who I found!”
A bubble of silence envelopes them. Draco watches the three communicate with nothing but twitches of their mouths and gestures. Just as the feeling of exclusion starts inside Draco, Harry faces him. “Do you remember what Dumbledore said about the third-floor corridor being out of bounds during the Welcome Feast?”
Oh, no. That came out way too sniffly. Draco touches a hand to his cheek and is horrified to find it come back wet. He’d been crying!
Draco’s breathing was coming out short and sporadic. Not now, he begged. This was the worst time for a panic attack. Harry needed him.
could be a bully at times. But-- evil? Surely not. The word doesn’t match with Sev; not the Severus that helps Draco through his panic attacks and can read his journals without being repulsed by the things written in them. Surely not
Never before had Draco felt so relieved to hear Ron Weasley's voice. He scrambled over to them, got a glimpse of Harry's face with Granger's own glowing wand, and immediately fell to the forest floor himself.
Zabini's jaw clenched noticeably, and his eyes turned sharper. Draco swallowed, regret filling his veins. "That's a point taken from Ravenclaw for swearing, Malfoy. What would your mummy say? And, by the way, if you knew what was good for you, you'd give a lot more than two shits, because my 'gossip' isn't pretty. But if you don't care? Fine. Suit yourself."
Sirius shrugged. Draco had a bad feeling about this. He had, after all, thought about it himself on that very night. When those Ministry people had been interrogating the three, Draco snuck off so they didn’t catch him and blame him for it.
“My dear, it has been obvious ever since you stepped foot in this classroom that you do not have what it takes to be successful in the noble art of Divination,” Trelawney said, her wide eyes glaring down at Hermione. “And frankly, I don’t ever remember a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.”
Draco poked his head into the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom. Umbridge was sat at her desk, wearing a fluffy pink cardigan over her shoulders, a pristine white quill in her hand. She was too focused on the parchment in front of her to have noticed Draco, who had gotten to class early and was now waiting outside. He had sprinted from breakfast to check for any evidence of them doing a practical lesson, as he had already decided he'd be leaving before it even began. First Lupin, and then fake-Moody... He refused to be traumatised again, even if it affected his O.W.L performance.
On Halloween night, Granger invites him to a ghost’s 500th Deathday party. He attends, obviously, and also brings along Luna so he has someone to complain to the entire night.
By the time break finished, Granger is still hidden away somewhere. Draco guesses it was the Hospital Wing, but could never get a look inside when he walks by. Several weeks passed.
Pomfrey, apparently finished with his bone, takes on the job of clearing away the blood that Potter’s arm is coated in. There had been no physical wound there, but she still is required to double-check.
The biggest photo has all Draco’s friends waving down at him in it— Hannah, Cho, Astoria and, rather surprisingly, Neville Longbottom. The smallest picture is from the day he’d finished Healer training.
"What? No. I'm just saying, I genuinely can't think of an instance in which the potion could be used for good and not some evil plan. Or, how about something sexual? What if you drank some and turned into your crush or whatever, and just wanked yourself off? It's an invasion of privacy, is what it is! A form of, of possession!"
“Nah, my place is further down the sewers,” Weasley replies nonchalantly. Draco giggles, incredulous. “You just have to take a right, and you’ll see my smelly old chamber. I keep my cows there.”
"I think you should go up to bed," Harry replied. He placed his palm on Draco's cheek. "You're burning up."
On Friday afternoon, he had Professor Lupin for the first time. The man arrived late, with a set of robes that looked far too old to even be worn. His hair was a light brown, and though he looked young, his eyes were old. Draco didn't know what to think of him.
Draco slowly backed away. He had a feeling if any of them caught him eavesdropping, he'd be getting the blame next. It would even add up in their eyes— "The boy's father must've taught him the spell!" he imagined Crouch's cold voice saying. "Oh, yes, the evidence is all there!"
“Auror Potter,” he said after a moment and moved aside to allow him in. Potter entered his office cautiously.
Draco stood up. He was so angry all of a sudden. "Don't talk about my mother like that. And, you know, for someone who hates their family so much, you're awfully like them in the way you're so quick to fucking hate someone based on who they're related to."
“You sold them out to Voldemort, killed all those Muggles. They trusted you. They fucking trusted you!”
Draco smiled, a bit giddy. They were standing very close. "Every respectable pureblood knows how to waltz, Potter."
After his little epiphany on what it was that was so often used in his dreams, Draco hung around Harry a lot more. He was the only one who could know, after all, as nobody else had realised Draco was a Seer. Except, perhaps, Professor Trelawney, who was acting battier every lesson. She had them doing horoscopes this year because apparently space was fucking omnipotent.
Draco, suspicious, hastened a glance into the compartment behind him. "She's in there! Move out of the way, Longbottom."
The evening of the third task came with a sense of foreboding. Draco headed for the grounds quite unwillingly, hands shaking and head hurting as he tried to think about why everything inside him was screaming to turn the other way. He found a seat with Luna at the bottom of the stands, practically already in tears. The moon sat at the bottom of the sky in the distance, waiting for its signal to come up. Draco, briefly, remembered that night so many months ago, when he had found the moon comforting. Now, it was anything but.
“Defence,” he answered. “Lupin had us go over our Vampire essays. I think he was very pleased with mine.”
His eyes were slipping closed. His grip on the book weakened, and it fell to the carpet floor. Draco's head leaned forward, and there he slept; there he dreamed.
’ on the train when a blonde girl slides open the compartment door. Her silver eyes burn into his own.
Draco wakes up on a cold floor with Harry Potter bent over him. His hair is somehow even more of a mess than usual, and he’s caked in a layer of dirt. “Have I died?”
A couple of minutes later, as the watch on his wrist reaches 7:33 P.M., Draco hears footsteps from down the hall and two voices. The first, he recognised, because it belonged to the wizard who lives in the portrait just outside his bedroom. "Lucius isn't here, boy! He won't like it if he finds you've been lurking about!"
Harry was dragged away to sit with the other champions to eat. Draco noticed Granger's absence, then, and glanced around for a glimpse of her bushy hair, but he couldn't see it anywhere. They found a table for themselves, and ate in awkward silence, as Weasley refused to make conversation with Padma, and Luna kept humming Muggle songs that she called 'elevator music'.
"Let's work together," explained Potter. Weasley frowned but didn't comment, swivelling around in his seat to work with Dean Thomas, instead. "I'm sure you've got some interesting dreams, then?"
“What do you mean? Look, give me my wand back. I might need it,” Harry Potter says, his tone fading into something resembling suspicious.
Lowering his book, he tilts his head. The girl is somewhat soft-looking, and while Draco’s own hair was far more white, he supposes she had the potential to pass as a Malfoy in certain lighting.
