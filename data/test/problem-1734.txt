Suddenly, there's a sneer painted across Draco's lips and ice in his words. "I suppose you think I'm weak, don't you? A man who can't stand up to his father, even after he's dead. A man who would willingly get on his knees for someone else's pleasure. A man who can't take what is rightfully his because he knows deep down he's not worthy of it."
Harry returns the smile. "Amazing what a bit of rest and the lack of nosy reporters will do."
Bolted to the table in the middle at a slight slant are two rounded, metal handles. Innocent enough, but Harry can already imagine what Draco will look like draped over the top, hands wrapped around those handles, begging for his Master.
Draco's mouth worked, but no sound emerged.
His eyes traveled from her hands to her throat, where no doubt her pulse was fluttering madly. She could feel the pounding in her heart all the way to her toes. Harry’s nostrils flared and he snorted.
She can't take her eyes off it. It's like the object and the image can't be disconnected in her mind. It is beauty, elegant and finely crafted. It's hard steel, fierce and arrogant. And even though it is static, it is
"No," he murmurs. "Counting is for discipline. This, Draco—this is for pleasure."
Harry’s lips tilted up in a tight grin. “So many ways to kill one man. Voldemort had nothing on the Ministry.”
"Not still pining after Blaise, then?"
"You're running. From your friends, from your guilt. From your life." Draco blew out a hard breath. "From everything." Potter swallowed, but kept silent. "Even dead, you're still running. But you won't get past it. Because it stays with you. It's part of you, like that damned scar that started it all. You can't face it. You can't face everything you lost." Draco snorted. "Wake up, Potter. You're not so special that you're the only one who lost something in this war." He took a step forward, and watched as Potter's body settled, moving unconsciously into a defensive stance.
"Good? Well, that remains to be seen. Severus has yet to lay out his terms."
Harry's mouth crashes into Draco's, and the chains rattle furiously against the metal as their chests collide. The kiss is volatile, a ragged tangle of lips, teeth, and tongue, certainly not indicative of the finesse Harry normally possesses. But he doesn't care about that now. Doesn't care about the seductive, teasing games his mouth could play on Draco's. All that matters is the completion of the circuit, Harry's lips on Draco's. They're both gasping and Draco's moaning like he's dying or being born again, and it's a carnal sound that trips the last of Harry's resolve.
"What—?"
Ron peered down at her. "Wow, 'Mione, that's—you should write that down."
"And you'd know all about that, wouldn't you? Deviant prick." Draco's tone is light and teasing, almost sultry, and it hits Harry straight at the base of his spine. This flicker of Draco's true nature is addictive, and it makes Harry wonder what else Draco's been hiding.
"Well, what did he want, then?"
She poured him a cup and pushed the sugar bowl toward him. He helped himself to two teaspoons and stirred.
Narcissa rouses from sleep, limbs heavy and sated. Her eyes blink up into the dimly lit room, focusing after a brief moment. Neville is pressed close against her side and the heat of his body seeps into her skin. She soaks in his warmth like a sponge, as if she can draw it inside and keep it there to chase away a future chill. His long, muscular arm pins her to the mattress, not with force, but with a gentle, grounding pressure that only adds to the lingering ache in her bones. The fine hairs on his forearm tickle underneath her breasts as her chest rises and falls with each breath.
A pointy finger came stabbing with accusation through the fire. “Did you see his neck? How could you do that and not heal him, for Merlin’s sake?” Indignant fire blazed in her eyes, and Harry swore underneath his breath as that look on her face confirmed the truth. Draco was her new cause.
Suddenly, he was being forcefully pulled alongside Potter, held tight against him. Potter’s gaze was searching, and when he ground out a terse, “Thank you”, Draco wasn’t sure if he was addressing Granger or himself.
Potter’s smile was smug as he lifted a shoulder. “Spelled her mouth shut, went out and picked up two blokes from a muggle club, brought them home, and made her watch while I fucked them both six ways from Sunday right there on her favorite settee.”
Suddenly, it clicked into place.
"You can't be serious, Mother!" Draco seethes next to her. His eyes are narrowed in contempt, his knuckles white from the clenched fists he has resting on the table. "The head of house always—"
Draco’s heart stuttered in his chest. Potter, dead. It was unthinkable. “If he’s that dangerous, then maybe-”
Draco rolls his eyes. "Ugh, please. Do we have to talk about this? I would feel much better about the whole thing if we didn't have to actually discuss it."
Potter’s strong hand graces Robards’ shoulder, urging him back down quietly and with apology. Well, fuck that for a game of soldiers. Draco turns, ready to give his last sickle for a portkey when Potter calmly calls his name. He can’t imagine why he turns back. He can’t imagine why he’s going to listen to anything Potter has to say. But he turns all the same. Potter asks Robards for the room, and fuck if the man doesn’t jump from his chair and zip past Draco out the door like his robes are on fire.
“I said no.”
The hard shell of his determined exterior cracked and he spoke. "I've left him. Merlin help me, I've left him."
“Not here,” Molly said with authority.
Hermione reached out and brushed her hand over his hair. “No, you really don’t.” She stood up, gathering her parchment and quill, stuffing them into her shoulder bag. “I’ll talk to Harry,” she said, heading for the door.
Potter glanced down at his shirt and trousers, both impeccably crisp. He reached a hand to tug at his collar.
"No," Harry says firmly, walking up to Ron. "He's Draco. And you're Ron, and I'm Harry, and the war—the war is fucking over. We've all moved on in every other way. Let this one go, too. For me."
"Who knows, Malfoy? Maybe things are about to change."
The warmth and the pleasure were still there, traveling through his body, and Draco relaxed, letting Potter drink his fill. He moved his hand from Potter’s hair, threaded it underneath Potter’s arm to wrap around his back, and let his legs fall open. Potter scooted between them, and Draco drew his legs up a fraction to trap Potter between his thighs, offering the only security he had to give. Potter melted into his body on a revelatory sigh, and the bite deepened.
Draco chokes back a sob, but nods in assent. Blond fringe is plastered to his forehead with sweat, obscuring his bottomless gray gaze as his head tips forward. Their cheeks almost touch, and the heat that's rolling off Draco in waves is charged—electric—and Harry thinks the air could spark between them and combust at any moment. He's taken this as far as it can go, and his cock is throbbing in his trousers to
"Are you familiar with aftercare?" he asks, somehow already knowing the answer. Merlin help him if he ever gets his hands on Zabini.
Draco laughed along with the rest of the table.
Clothes. He needs clothes. Harry considers reaching for his old ones from yesterday, but given Narcissa's thoroughness with the products in the bathroom, he goes to the closet and isn't disappointed. It's filled with clothes, both Wizarding and muggle. He grabs a pair of boxers and socks before snagging a pair of neatly folded jeans and a soft cotton t-shirt from a hanger. He laughs out loud as he slips the on the purposely-faded shirt, emblazoned with a Muggle band logo. He wonders if Narcissa has any idea who 'Van Halen' is, but he has no doubt this is her doing. Her hand is all over this, not to mention he can smell traces of the jasmine scent she wears on the cotton. She handpicked these things specifically for him, he knows it. It wouldn't surprise him in the least if she still tries to pick out Draco's clothes as well.
"Absolutely. I got a bang-up tour of the greenhouse and took a look at those roses." Neville looks at Narcissa as she disengages to remove her cloak. Draco's there in an instant to take it from her and he drapes it over his arm. "It'll be next week before I can get back, though. I've got some things to finish before term starts back, and I want to do some more research. If that's agreeable, Narcissa?"
Potter slunk to the door with all the grace of a kicked Crup. He paused at the doorway and cast a furtive glance over his shoulder. "I'll leave you in peace, then."
Emotion swells in his heart because it feels like someone has blown away the smoke and the shadow, leaving him to stand there in Harry's gaze, shining with light. The pressure clamps down and he fucks and fucks and fucks under Harry's watchful eye, until the sensation coalesces to burst out in a tide of orgasm.
"Behold, Potter," Malfoy says, the dry spite echoing out into the vastness of the cavernous room. "The studio."
“There were other charges they could have brought. But they didn’t. Why? Think about this, Harry. Really think about it. If they lumped them all together, the Ministry only gets one crack at him. Boom, he serves his time, and then they can’t touch him. But, if they hold back, only prosecute and convict one charge at a time, then Malfoy’s looking at a revolving Azkaban door for the rest of his life. He serves his seven years, he gets out, and if he even looks like he’s stepping one aristocratic toe out of line, they haul him back in and pull out another charge. There’s no statute on war crimes, and they’re still holding Dumbledore’s attempted murder and the torture charges for safekeeping. They’ve got scores of testimony and pensieve memories to corroborate. Even yours. Frankly, if he did get out, they wanted to give him enough grief that he’d just AK himself and save everyone the trouble.”
. Every other pass grazed over a spot that whited out his vision, pulling pleasure up from his toes to coil in a heated mass at the base of his spine. Over the buzz in his brain, the sounds of sex echoed in the room like a dark symphony. Wet, filthy noises, the tell-tale slap of skin on skin, and the harsh, jagged breathing of two men on the precipice of desire.
Harry hears Lucius Malfoy's voice in Draco's tone.
Draco scoffed and rubbed a shaky hand over his face. "Merlin, not this again." Draco felt his voice rising higher, and in the back of his mind he knew this direction was only going to take him places he didn't want to go. "Circe's tits, Potter, I didn't do it for you, so if you could just let go of that—"
"The self-styling leader of the Vampire Council. Silvestri," Potter answered.
He's planning on spending the better part of the day in the studio again, but there's something about the soft, earnest quality in Draco's eyes and his gentle awkwardness that has Harry wanting to put him at ease. And frankly, the thought of spending an uninterrupted hour or two in Draco's presence just
He's ungainly and uncoordinated, and Harry thinks he looks rather like a marionette caught in a windstorm. Harry finds it more arousing than it should be, and gives him a reprieve with a wave of his hand. Draco's coat, tie, and shirt come off, and one of his shoes flies across the room to bang into the opposite wall. But now he's naked from the waist up, and Harry latches onto
"Now," Mrs. Malfoy says, after taking a delicate sip of her tea, "why don't you start at the beginning and tell us why exactly you're here, Mr. Potter."
Ron's arm drops to his side and he stumbles back, confused. "What—just what the fucking hell, Harry?"
Dressed, he firecalls Neville and asks him about the gardens. Neville's more than happy to come over and take a look, and there's not a hint of reservation that Harry can perceive. He tells Harry he'll send an owl to Narcissa to confirm. When Harry tells him that isn't necessary, Neville frowns and says, "Of all people, Harry, you should know that propriety has its place."
“Like hell I don’t.”
Draco scooted his chair back and came around to stand beside her. “I suppose I’ll be seeing a lot more of you if I’m living with Potter.”
Harry catches Draco's gaze and holds it. "You're as worthy a man as I've ever met. You've shown that much. And there is no weakness in submission, Draco."
"Celebrate?" Draco's voice sounds a touch wary.
Draco stiffens, not in fear, but because Harry thinks if he didn't, he'd collapse to the floor in a puddle. He makes another mental tick in head beside 'bondage'. Yes, praise definitely won't be a problem.
Potter's hand fell to his side. "And that's the other thing. I had every intention of making this a lab for you when you mentioned it. But after I…I hurt you, I knew I needed to make it as perfect as possible. At first, I was angry. Angry with you because you should have known better than to bleed in my presence." Draco's eyebrow rose, but Potter put up a hand. "I know, I know. And then I was angry at myself for thinking that. You were suspended in a moment that had forgotten you. You were not at fault, I was. All this control I fight to keep every day, and I came undone from the scent of your blood." Potter shook his head and dropped his eyes to the floor. "There is a time and a place to lose that control. Standing over your mother wasn't it." It felt like ages for Potter to lift his head and fix him with those eyes. "I'm sorry, Draco. You don't know how much. I was overwhelmed with what I—the bond makes me feel for you." Potter's eyes were pleading for him to understand. "All I knew is that you were in pain, and I—the bond urged me to comfort you. But you were bleeding, and there's a part of me that reconciles all that. Hurt, blood, and sex all equal comfort to that baser side of me. It was never meant to discount your grief. Only distract you from it." Potter's hands clenched into fists at his side. "I am a man, a wizard, and a vampire. I am a dark creature, with dark magic, and even darker desires. But I don't want to be a monster."
Snape's lips pursed and he cast Draco a knowing glance. "So it does."
Pansy snaps her fingers and gasps, "Yes, that's it! 'Get some'."
Draco turned his head toward the door of his cell, the sound of hushed arguing drawing his attention.
"I see." Draco set the wine glass on the table.
"I really shouldn't. I've got a big week ahead of me. Give your mother my regards." Pansy's smile is soft and fond, but she does look tired, and Harry can see that she's torn.
00000
As per usual, the Cannons lost, but put up a valiant effort. When Draco asked him why he hadn't asked Potter to come, Ron had shrugged in that casual way of his and replied, "I've asked. He won't come. I've asked. He snarled. I've stopped asking. It's a thing." Either way, it hadn't seemed to affect Ron, and Potter hadn't seemed put out that Draco went. And if anyone had ever told Draco he would have a good time at the hands of Ron Weasley, he would have hexed them into oblivion and then punched them in the face for good measure (bad pun notwithstanding). Another shining example of a mediocre existence made good by the company of a friend.
Narcissa looks to Draco for confirmation. His head is bowed over his toast, and he crunches into it with force, nodding curtly.
"Tell me you want it." Harry hears the unusual grate to his own voice, but he's not really surprised. Nobody's ever aroused him as much as Draco.
Draco nodded, turned on his heel and bolted out the door into the empty hallway.
Snape regarded Potter with a long, searching look. "Do you honestly think that if you push him away, you can keep him safe?"
"Thank you for coming to dinner. Your mother was pleased, as I'm sure you could tell. It made her happy."
The tongue and finger vanished, only for touch to reappear a second later, and Potter was sliding two lubed fingers in their place. The burn was inconsequential, falling into line with the rest of the bittersweet twinges Potter had showered him with thus far. Potter stroked inside of him with a slow reverence, taking his time, dragging his fingers back and forth the awakened tissue.
"Draco, please—"
"Please sit, enjoy your breakfast. I presume I will see
He turned back to Potter, bewildered. "You—you planted these?"
"Miss Cissa is telling Master Dragon not to be being worried about Master Harry missing meals, but he is keeping looking at the empty chair where Master Harry sits."
Harry knows it's foolish to think that all traces of Blaise's influence would be gone by this point in time. It's something they're going to have to work through, little by little, and some hesitance is expected. But this is how they will build trust. And Harry's not cruel enough to chastise him for it right now.
He was on fire, burning up from the inside out, lit by the matches that were Potter’s fangs, fueled by the desire that Potter stoked in his belly. His arms shot out and wrapped around Potter’s back, crushing them together. Potter’s resulting growl was full-body, vibrating through him, and he leaned in to the embrace. His wet-shirt bunched between their bodies, scraping over Draco’s nipples, making him hiss with pleasure.
Draco laughed. “You absolute deviant.”
“No,” Potter said firmly. “You knew what my answer would be, so I don’t know why you insisted on coming here, Silvestri.”
? Merlin save me from Gryffindors and their reckless tangents!"
Draco ran to the bed and reached out a hand to shake him awake. “Potter! Wake up!”
The bite mark on his neck tingled and tightened in anticipation at the proximity of Potter's mouth, and Draco steeled himself for the sting to come. It never came. Instead, Potter rubbed the bridge of his nose over the two small marks, teasing and slow, alternating the touch with the drag of his lips and slow licks from his tongue.
"No," Potter repeated, biting at his arse. "I want you to take another. I want to watch you stretch for me." He breathed out against Draco's skin. "Do you know how gorgeous you are like this?" A third finger pushed its way inside and Draco's breath stalled in his lungs. "I could spend hours here, watching you take me in, licking you inside and out. I could rim your sweet little arse until you come, I bet. Would you like that? Want me to shove my tongue in your pretty pink hole and eat you out until you come?"
Draco bit out a broken laugh. "Respect? That's rich."
Draco's hands curl into the lapels of his suit jacket. "Then what the fuck was that? I could—I could
"And you required this for tonight?" Draco swallows hard and Harry watches the long line of his throat. He's ready to put his lips and teeth on Draco's skin. He's ready to leave all sorts of marks behind.
“Fiendfyre,” Potter uttered on a grunt. “Lost you.”
It's such a precious thing, Draco's willingness to submit, and Harry has to grip the frame harder to keep his hands from wandering. This is about the kiss. The insistent press of lips on flesh, the flicker of tongue against sweat-cooled skin, the taste of the man beneath him. The intimacy that only kisses can bring.
He let his hands press back against the shower wall, fighting against the urge to touch as Potter ravaged at his neck and rutted against him. He was afraid that if he disturbed Potter from his feed, it would anger him, much like a dog at his bowl, and he risked further injury, or worse, cause him to pull back and
Draco's head snapped up at the sound of Potter's voice. He strolled into the room, casual as you please, and Draco felt his blood rising in his veins. Potter must have noticed the change as well, because he stopped short, nostrils flaring, and put his gaze directly on Draco's face.
Draco's words cut off, saving Harry from another scathing remark when the patio doors open and Narcissa and Neville stroll in, arm in arm, pink-cheeked from the cold, heads bent in intimate laughter.
“There’s also the matter of financial responsibilities.”
"I see. How thoughtful of Molly to share you with me." Andromeda winked, then turned to offer a hand out to the woman behind her - Draco's mother. "I believe you've met my sister, Narcissa?"
Draco started a bit at Karen's voice, soft but distinct. "Uh...what was that?"
"He's well above legal age, Minerva, and a paying customer. I'd have been a fool to turn him away."
Draco didn't move but to bow his head as he always had so far when cornered for these kinds of encounters.
"How..." He cleared his throat. "How did I end up in the hospital wing? I don't remember what happened, how I got here."
“When will all this be taking place?”
“Yes, Teddy.”
He hears a door open.
Someone is singing.
“There’s a sayin’ that you don’t need therapy if you just talk to the barman.”
"Losing my best mate because people can't get their heads out of their own arses?" Harry snapped. The girl leaned back in surprise. "Yeah, it's pretty terrible, let me tell you."
"No, I just saw you go in a minute ago."
Professor McGonagall didn't answer right away, letting Harry wonder briefly if she had even heard him. But then, she said gently, "Yes, you have caused quite a ruckus in your time here. But I'm not going to expel you for being human, Harry. Besides, it's far more difficult to be expelled from Hogwarts than the staff lead students to believe."
"Oh, we'll see it alright," Hermione said with a grin of her own. "I'll see to that."
Fanning her face, she, too, vanished into the crowd.
The moan that came out of Draco's mouth was absolutely filthy, and Harry willed himself not to climax at the sound. He surged forward and crashed his lips onto Draco's in a messy kiss. It only took Harry's hand a few twists before Draco was actively thrusting upward with his hips, nails digging into the skin of Harry's back.
"That's what I'm saying."
"Shit, Josh," one of the other boys said, sounding uncertain. "Don't cut up his face where people can see."
Harry sighs. Things are difficult enough without having to worry about Teddy behaving appropriately. Although only the second one, the Battle of Hogwarts Remembrance Ceremonies are among the hardest things Harry has to endure lately. Being back at Hogwarts, seeing the castle even at a distance, smelling the grounds, catching glimpses of the lake, the Quidditch pitch, seeing the Forbidden Forest surrounding them...ghostly impressions of the destruction that took over the place overlay the happy memories that fight to the surface of his thoughts. Dark creatures growl underfoot as he plays his first game of Quidditch, curses soar overhead at a holiday feast, lifeless bodies lie in the snow of a fourth-year snowball fight-
Potter reached for Draco, but the hand frightened him. Draco nearly fell backwards onto the floor as he scrambled from his seat.
"Well...whatever happened," Harry continued, trying to continue taking notes. "It isn't right."
A note fell from his cloak when he made to fold it. It was a torn scrap of parchment, no larger than his palm, and Draco recognized the untidy scrawl there.
“Will you stop acting like a madman for two fucking seconds?” Malfoy hisses. He’s cradling a half-asleep Teddy, walking in the dark.
“And now that Potter and I are...ah...'playing nice’ around him, I think Teddy’s exposure to negativity is all but extinguished. I can’t say for Potter when he’s over there, but I make sure not to let Teddy notice my personal stresses such as the finances or whatever.”
Potter's smirk faded and he sighed. "I know you think that. But eventually, one day, I will change your mind about that."
Draco jerks in his chair to aim a furious scowl at Harry as he leaves the table. “I practically bribed this boy to eat old noodles because of you, and now you’re just letting him do exactly what I’ve always been allowing?”
"Oh no, the magic hasn't entirely worn off yet, has it?" she asked sympathetically. "I can only imagine what it'd feel like to be coming out from such a spell for so long...I'm sure I'd be a bit grouchy, too."
"Think of it as a bit of a vacation," Hermione had said, much to Ron's incredulity.
"I know, Harry." He gave Harry a small smile, reaching to pat him on the shoulder. "We all know."
"I love you, too," Draco said. He broke their embrace, making his way back toward the party. "Come on. Let's find Hermione and Weasley before they make too big a fool of themselves."
“Ugh...I’m so sorry, Fleur.”
As Professor Sprout began scribbling down several strange names on the blackboard, the class hastily pulled out parchment and quills, wanting to jot down all they could. Draco began to copy down the names, forcing himself all the while to take deep, soothing breaths so that he didn't faint at the desk. How had he thought he could return to Hogwarts?
"No," Granger said sharply. "Thank you, but no. I'll be right back."
Ron and Hermione had appeared only a few minutes after he had spoken with Ginny. They had apparently seen Ginny storming away, and Ron had cut over Hermione's tactful questions to demand Harry tell them if he had broken things off with Ginny for good. When Harry had said that he had, the explosion from Ron was almost worse than breaking his sister's heart. It had been a strained few days after that, but eventually the air had cleared and Ron decided (though Harry suspected the Hermione had helped things along) that Harry and Ginny were better off with other people and that his sister deserved someone "a bit more cheerful."
Sighing, Harry looked down at the eggs, toast, and bacon that she had piled onto his plate. His stomach churned at the sight, but he knew Hermione was right. He began to pick at the eggs.
"Good morning, good morning," Professor Sprout said as she came through the classroom door, allowing it to slam shut behind her. "And welcome to another year! Last year was a damned mess, and as I cannot be sure precisely who all was here and for how long, we will be diving in as though this is all your first time as seventh years. Peachy?"
As though hit with lightning, Draco started violently, spilling some of his tea down his front as he whipped around. In the kitchen's doorway stood his mother.
Potter had once nearly begged him to eat. Those green eyes had turned up at him, wide and pleading...
“Such as, say, general questions? Do you feel he’s eating enough?”
Dinner was approaching. The Slytherin common room was emptying as students began to make their way to the Great Hall, but Draco paid them little notice as he sat by the fire, staring into the flames with his mother's open letter in his hand. Karen had tried to talk to him earlier, though she had just quietly left him when he showed her the letter, dragging a comforting hand through his hair as she passed.
“No, you need to eat more of this breakfast.”
“Bye!” Teddy waves frantically, and Malfoy smiles back, giving the toddler a wave of his own.
Uncomfortable as it is, Teddy’s confusion about his and Harry’s relationship, or lack thereof, isn’t exactly novel. It’s a strange comfort, knowing that Draco’s not alone in such conversations. Much of the time, Teddy accepts simple declinations, one-dimensional explanations about why they three are so fractured, but there are times that he persists, Draco’s most memorable one being when Teddy pestered Draco about why he didn’t also give Harry a goodnight kiss.
"Some, though I think he's rather avoiding me the same as he's avoiding everyone right now. But I needn't talk to him to know that of course he's missing you terribly. Otherwise, he wouldn't be pulling away so hard."
"Too offensive? How's it too offensive?" Weasley asked.
“Yes.”
Draco looked up from his novel, an epic of a wizard on a journey across China in search of his lost brother, at Slughorn's voice. Harry, his head resting on the desk beside him, didn't stir until Draco kicked him under the table.
“Oh, come,” Draco scoffs. “Not even a toddler will let himself actually starve. Teddy’s eating habits are just different than what you prefer. You should trust his body.”
She seemed to take the tension with her. Light laughter followed her words, and soon overlapping conversations filled the Hall again as food appeared on the tables.
It seems there are no bounds for how many things Draco has wrong in his head.
“Grown ups only sleep in the same bed or, er, couch, if they- well, if they love each other.”
Draco would have given anything not to remember.
“No-ige stah.”
"What changed?" Draco asked.
Mr. Cook chuckles. “Well, you’ll have opportunity to prove yourself just fine, as my partner and I will be stopping by to check in on you and Teddy periodically until you are either deemed fit or not.”
"Which," Harry continued, hands gentle as he cradled Draco's face, "is why, no, I am not just trying to save you. I'm trying to be your...your friend because I know you deserve a second chance, because I do like you, because I know you are allowed to be happy."
“Oh yes, thank you, Harry. And how have things been for you since we last spoke?”
All good points, Harry thinks, good points outside of the obvious. And though he would rather stab himself in the eye with his own wand than admit it, Harry has been asked by Teddy more than once why Malfoy can’t be with them in the evenings and on weekends. Teddy loves them both; he would be ecstatic to have them all under one roof.
“Easy for you to say. You’re not the one being reformed like there’s something wrong with every little thing about you.”
A warmth filled Draco's chest that had nothing to do with lust when Harry smiled at his words. He leaned over and pressed a tender kiss to Draco's forehead, then flopped onto his back on the mattress.
“What sort of acting out has been occurring? Tantrums, hiding, refusing to eat? Anything of extreme concern?”
"Er..." Harry couldn't very well just abandon Hermione at this point. Not after she had gone so far for Draco on Harry's behalf. He asked, "So...where's Ron?"
Harry glances over with a frown, eyes meeting Draco’s. Confusion resides there, like it so often seems to, but it’s the gratitude filtering through that Draco notices. His stomach cramps at the sight.
“Oh, Teddy...”
their agreement not to fight, or to at least argue reasonably, is abandoned.
“NO!” Teddy screeches, balling his little fingers into fists.
Harry shakes his head, agreeing.
"Ah...no," Malfoy said, not looking at him. "Total."
I just...my aunt and uncle weren’t big on magic. Scared them, they hated it, the like. So whenever I accidentally did any, I was punished. I didn’t have a lot else going on, so the easiest was to withhold a meal or two and lock me in-” Draco’s eyes go round, and Harry switches gears defensively, face hotter than ever. “I mean, sure,
“It happens around this age, unfortunately, especially with boys. Ginny was always more willing to push at the top of the stairs...but don’t fret, Harry dear. You’re doing a fantastic job with him.”
"You think we all brewed it incorrectly? I'm not feeling a thing."
of the books Hermione recently gifted him. The grumbles from dinner are forgotten amid the smiling, giggling, the typical silliness of Teddy as he listens, wriggling in the crook of Harry's lap. Nothing is out of sorts as Harry tucks Teddy into his bed, sings a couple lullabies, then parts with a kiss to his forehead.
“No, Daco bed.”
Harry smiled, enjoying the familiarity of the scene. Things would never quite be normal again, but at least some things hadn't changed.
"Today, I'd like for you all to brew me something different," Slughorn continued. "Your deskmate will be your partner until Christmas, at which point in time we will mix it up for the second part of term. Go ahead and clear your desks, and I will come around and give each pair a potion to brew."
Harry was five, no six? Fire Whiskeys into his evening, and he still felt relatively coherent. The world wasn't blurring and spinning as the stories told, at least. No, he was sitting just fine on his nasty barstool, downing his drink in his filthy glass, brooding over Draco bloody Malfoy.
"I was asked to help oversee some of the administrative changes there over the summer."
To his surprise, Harry nodded. "Yeah. I still have nightmares from as far as before I came to Hogwarts. Most nights, I barely sleep because of it. Except, of course, the two times I had you here."
"Who?"
"No."
There was more applause as an unnecessarily stocky man stood up and waved alongside Professor Vector.
was what Harry regretted.
Draco tossed Teddy again and scrunched his nose at the baby.
“Ah-wee!”
“Like always,” Harry mutters.
Nothing had deterred it.
“Almost as good as it was before.”
A loud silence followed. Draco's entire body was hot and he was still sporting a raging erection that was distinctly disappointed at the turn of events. Much to his satisfaction and mortification, Draco saw that Harry, at least physically, was in the same situation.
"Draco, it's good to finally see you."
Draco should be in mourning.
And with an explosion of a pop, Draco Disapparates back home.
Harry held fast, only allowing their lips to graze. "It's good to hear. Real character development."
“We can go to the park if you want, sure.”
"It's just not-"
"Just shut up," Draco hissed. He had been patient so far, but enough was enough. He slammed his book shut and began to gather his things. "You don't know a damn thing about my mother, and you don't know a damn thing about me, so just shut up and fuck off already."
“Park?”
“Morning. Are you hungry?”
Instinctively, Draco froze, but before he could kiss back, Harry pulled away. Confusion clouded his sleepy eyes.
“Still, maybe we’ll get lucky enough to excuse ourselves early if the baby comes soon.”
"It's okay to ask questions." Luna looked up from her search and smiled at him. "Friends are allowed to ask questions."
"Well, no. You were being an arsehole and owe me an apology."
But as Teddy’s shoulders still within seconds, Harry feels that frustration ebb away into nothing. Teddy has been through enough without the last two people he has left constantly being at each other’s throats. He doesn’t deserve to deal with such apprehension when it’s so painfully plain to see just how much he loves them both, how much Harry and Malfoy each mean to him.
More tears fell. Draco gripped the tower's ledge harder with his numbed fingers and white knuckles as gentle sobs shook his body alongside the shaking the cold had brought him.
"Is it supposed to be...doing anything?" he asked, eyeing the liquid as it began to darken at the change of direction in Malfoy's ladle.
“Then I’ll see you next week.”
“We ought to spend a fair amount of focus on toilet training him now.”
The table fell silent.
“I should’ve known better than to trust you with flammable materials,” Draco scoffs.
"I wouldn't, mate."
“I know that, but for how much luck you wear like some gaudy cloak for all to see, I’ve dealt with Teddy’s magic acting up. I can’t constantly parade around for muggles a child that can change his appearance at will and turn birds into chickens.”
"For one thing," Hermione said, tipping her orb skins into the cauldron, "it's obvious that he's been nothing but happy with you up until now. For another thing, he's only acting this way because he thinks that being with you in any way is endangering his mum."
But Ron and Hermione had been rather insistent that he go at least once before the holidays, and Harry had figured that the Hogsmeade trip before the one that immediately preceded the break would be his best bet. When he had woken that morning to see the awful weather to accompany it, Harry had grinned at his luck.
Regardless, Teddy is already gobbing another huge bite into his mouth, and Harry finishes his own meal satisfied. He moves to start the clean up, listening as Draco introduces the idea of wearing underwear and sitting on a toilet to Teddy, who is only half-listening, asking if he can go play when Draco’s speech is finished. As the evening progresses, Harry wonders just what Draco might be getting himself into.
“He does well enough. We go out enough without any real issues. And it keeps him sane and more likely to listen.”
"Excellent. Let's get out of here."
Ron grimaced. After Ron and Harry had decided to return to Hogwarts, Mrs. Weasley had been rather teary-eyed. With Bill and Fleur living away, Percy returning to his London flat (he had insisted that he couldn't break the lease just then, but he visited nearly every weekend), George back to living atop his shop in Diagon Alley, and Charlie due to return to Romania shortly after the Hogwarts Express left, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were facing a truly empty house for the first time since the war once Harry, Ron, and Ginny left. Seeing Mrs. Weasley wipe at her eyes every time he retrieved an item for his trunk from around the house had Harry reconsidering returning to Hogwarts on more than one occasion.
Nothing would have satisfied Harry more than to have punched her square in the face, grabbed her and physically shook the stupidity out of her. But Harry just ground his teeth and stomped out of the Great Hall, eyes and whispers following him as they always did. It was infuriating, exhausting, and depressing to not just hear about how gullible people could be but to also stare it in the face day in and day out.
They passed by endless Weasley relatives, really more a blur of red hair and freckles in varying states of inebriation. But Harry caught sight of plenty of familiar faces as they picked their way through the crowd; Fleur sitting with Andromeda in a far corner with Teddy, loud and two, and the newest Weasley, Victoire, born a little over a year previous; George holding Angelina Johnson's hand as he laughed with Bill, Charlie, and Lee Jordan with his own very pretty guest; Percy and his fiancee talking with Mr. Weasley. The joy all around the garden was palpable, and Harry couldn't keep the grin off his face as he finally spotted Mrs. Weasley and forced their way to her.
"I know."
Pleasure rumbled in Harry's chest at his name on Draco's lips, and he pressed in closer, sliding his tongue into Draco's mouth.
“But he doesn’t seem hungry?” Ms. Dribble asks. She strides over to the bathroom, letting herself in without looking back.
"I'm not saying letting go, just not being complete arseholes."
It never occurred to Harry just how much
"Uh..." Draco swallowed, and the racing in his heart slowed marginally.
The world whirls at millions of kilometers per hour beneath his feet as he stands, both literally and figuratively; they are all but meat-bagged bundles of bones hurtling through space, after all. Nothing more. Nothing matters, not truly. Draco giggles at the thought.
"Yes, Draco, you already don't eat enough."
Harry laughed. "Oh ho ho, no, Hermione, I think it just became my business."
Mr. Cook waves his hand dismissively. “Then he’s likely fine. A toddler won’t let himself starve.”
"At one point, I shared a mind with Voldemort." Draco snapped his eyes back to Harry. "Not all the time, but usually when I slept, I could see through his eyes. And more than once...I saw you. The look that was always on your face wasn't something you wear if you're thrilled about what's going on around you. I couldn't get that look out of my head. There was no way you were as evil as I always made you out to be."
“Well, no.”
Those baby lips twisted into a smile.
"No," he said, finally answering Hermione. "No, it's...it's not like that. I just found him asleep in the Astronomy Tower and thought he needed a place to sleep. He told me he hasn't been sleeping more than an hour a night."
With a last, terrified look at Potter, Draco turned and sprinted from the pub.
"Draco? What-"
Draco whipped around at Potter's voice. He stood a few feet behind him, casually standing at the top of the staircase as though they had agreed to meet.
Encouraged, Draco pulled his head back, his lips tight against the cock in his mouth, licking all the while as he bobbed back down again. Harry's knees shook slightly, and Draco's hands pushed him into the door more firmly as he sucked Harry's cock fast and messy.
“We will be returning in about three months, on Monday, the 27th of November,” Mr. Cook says at the door. “At that time, we would like a copy of the notes from Teddy’s pediatric healer to see how he’s doing in that regard. Although, Harry, with how things seem to be going, I can’t imagine you have anything further to worry about in terms of being granted permanent guardianship. You will have to follow the contract through to the end, for which I am only partially sorry.” He laughs, pats Harry’s shoulder.
Harry had tried to talk to Draco despite Ron's message. But Draco must have known Harry would do just that and had done a spectacular job of avoiding Harry all week. But by Thursday, real panic and desperation had gripped Harry and he had managed to catch Draco in the corridor near the Slytherin common room, near the place where Draco had finally told Harry that he loved him.
“Well, it ought to be more definitive in any case,” Ms. Dribble interjects, but she’s speaking to Mr. Cook, who looks thoughtful. “We could draw up something similar to those with childcares, should Mr. Malfoy agree to the time table.”
Harry's heart was hammering, either from the sprinting or his proximity with Draco, he didn't know or particularly care. There was so much that could go wrong, but Gryffindors were brave and bold, even when they ought not to be. And it was that bravery and boldness that pushed Harry to lean forward and close the gap between his lips and Draco's.
“He doesn’t need you,” Potter snaps. “Mrs. Weasley and Fleur are enough. He doesn’t need some crazy rotation with a hundred people watching him.”
“Out?”
“Fell asleep just as we got home. He’s a pretty heavy sleeper, so I don’t know if he’ll wake up to talk or not.”
"No, you haven't," she said matter-of-factly. "But I appreciate your chivalry."
For the first time that term, Harry was going to Hogsmeade. It was a frigid Saturday, snow blanketing the grounds and heavy winds knocking over the smallest first years, but Harry figured it was time to just do it. He hadn't gone yet simply because he was avoiding the awestruck stares that his newfound heroism brought whenever he stepped into a public space. Buying his school supplies in Diagon Alley had been an absolute nightmare that he hadn't been eager to repeat.
But whatever Bill says to Ron seems to have done the trick. Some ten minutes later, Harry and Ron step onto the short platform in the garden beside the altar, Ron looking nearly calm. Harry attempted to apologize but was told not to worry. Looking as if he truly meant it, Ron even cracked a joke that he’d make sure his own kid acts up at Harry’s wedding.
“I wouldn’t know; I didn’t grow up relying on my father to do everything for me.”
Harry's lips trailed kisses down Draco's chin and neck, nipping at the skin just below his protruding collar bone. Harry heard a sharp intake of breath as Draco's hands gripped him tight on the arm and in his hair. A smirk stole Harry's lips at the sound and he slid his teeth against the soft skin again.
“Why couch?”
," Harry clarified.
“Indeed,” Ms. Dribble says, wry smile on her face.
Draco didn't move much until sunrise.
“Come on, Teddy, please? We’re not waking Draco up right now.”
Somewhere in the past several weeks, Malfoy had become someone worth worrying over for Harry. He had become someone that cause such strong emotions that Harry had nearly sent his own curse at Malfoy's attacker that evening. It was unexpected, these surging feelings, but Harry found that he wasn't averse to the idea. It did, however, raise several questions that he wasn't sure he wanted to answer. But Harry had long ago learned to take things as they came, be what they may, and he was not going to overthink whatever was happening between him and Malfoy.
"Well..." he began, then thought better of it. Understanding as Hermione could be, she may not have approved of him simply giving away his notes to Malfoy. "I guess I was just listening. Wanted to make sure I heard it all instead of worrying about writing it down."
Teddy is our oldest child in this chapter. It took that kid like three years to actually eat a full meal after lunch and it drove my poor husband to the brink of insanity each and every day of it so here's to you, K
But as Harry hurries toward Teddy’s angry screams, he can’t stop the guilt from festering in his chest.
Draco groans. “Sure.”
like. And I definitely don't like boys. So I probably like girls, right?"
Harry grinned. "That's a conversation I'd like to see."
to kill Dumbledore,” Potter snarls, leaning closer, “and you
Thankfully, Fleur is already on a maternity leave from her work at Gringotts and is far more kind than Hermione, Ginny, and Mrs. Weasley give her credit for and has saved Harry’s life. It’s mostly temporary, but Fleur agreed to watch Teddy for Harry during the work hours, a full-time job that Harry felt he had to plead until Bill cut him off and Fleur waved away his stammering with nothing but unconditional familial support.
Draco shakes his head. “Absolutely not. Fine day.” His voice is hoarse.
"Yeah, I'd rather avoid all the glares I'd get just by being alive."
"Harry's a thousand times the person you could ever hope to be, and he doesn't deserve to be drug through the dung by you!"
He headed the way round the corner and found four Gryffindor sixth years that he recognized as Josh Gregory, Conrad Oswald, Maddox Smith, and Cooper Fretzel. They stood in a semi-circle, wands drawn and eyes widened in shock. There was an unconscious heap near the wall that Harry recognized as Malfoy.
“But this place,” she continues, moving along the wall and opening a few drawers in the dresser that holds Harry’s things. “This has promise for a growing child.”
Bath time is a more subdued affair than normal for a Sunday night. Usually, there's more splashing, more rambunctiousness that Harry encourages, knowing he'll be gone for most of the upcoming week, yet they both stick to the basics, faces stiff. But when Harry pulls on Teddy’s pajamas, there seems to be a rejuvenation of energy, one-sided, and Teddy skips his way to the bookshelves, eager to read
Harry clenched his teeth as he began a quiet ascent to the top of the tower.
“Only because he was brave enough to take pity on your sorry ass.”
“After what I
Jasmine had been a chubby Hufflepuff that the Carrows had chosen because they didn't think she'd invoke a lot of pity. She had been selected to be made an example of, and Draco had been selected to carry out that example. Her eyes had pleaded with Draco and he hadn't been able to perform the Curse properly, causing Jasmine short spurts of pinching pain rather than the torture that the Carrows had wanted.
Luna had rushed to the Gryffindor table at dinner, dragging Harry out of his seat as she told him that she was certain a group of sixth years had made to follow Malfoy. She was sure that they were the same boys that attacked Malfoy in the first week, though she hadn't any proof. Harry had immediately let her lead him out of the Great Hall.
Draco shrugged. "Not that the textbook or Professor Sprout mentioned. Maybe whatever they're talking about is just interesting."
Panic was mounting in Draco's chest, every instinct screaming for him to run, to bury himself in the darkness of his bed and never resurface. Nothing could save him from suffocating but the sanctuary of his room. Lightheadedness was fast approaching, and Draco bowed his head as he pressed his back against the wall for support.
“You can cry all you want; as soon as you’re done, you’re going to say sorry to Fleur. Hopefully she’ll still sit with you during the wedding.”
"And how have you been?"
They glared at each other for a moment. After several seconds, Harry's lips twitched into a smile. He couldn't help it. Of course this was how their proposal would go. Laughing softly, Harry nodded.
"Quiet, quiet, come on now!" Slughorn shot a look at Draco and Harry. "Your Bliss Potions have fully matured and are officially ready for testing. Or, at least, they will be after some of you add the final ingredient - veritaserum."
. I was just always more confident than you and your shuffling."
Draco's voice was deep and raspy. "I thought this was a...ah, what did you call it? A 'quicky'."
"Well, it's Karen," she said with a smile. It fell slightly, though, as she asked, "How come you haven't spoken to me since that first night? I've wave to you in the halls and I try to talk to you in the common room when you're actually there..."
He hadn't truly cried in ages, the last time likely being when he had been struggling with fixing the Vanishing Cabinet his sixth year. Somewhere between the horrors that had unraveled from Dumbledore's death and onward, Draco had seemed to dry up entirely.
Malfoy's eyes were closed, his mouth slightly open, chest rising and falling in smooth, deep breaths. He hadn't a cloak on for some reason, and for it, Malfoy was shivering in the chill of the tower.
“And if the brainless Harry Potter seems to be doing okay, you must be something of a god, no?"
It was as though the chains of his past had finally been torn from his heart. A cool calm had spread through Draco, beginning in his chest as he had read with much relief that his mother was safe and slithering through the rest of his body like a liquid wildfire as the full impact of her words hit him. She was safe. She was happy. She wanted him to be, as well.
But such thoughts were only adding wood to the fire that was Draco's remounting panic, slashing away at his ability to breathe correctly, drawing shut his vision so that he could only see pinpricks of what was directly in front of him. Unconsciousness was creeping upon him quickly, and Draco wondered if he was going to die from the lack of oxygen or simply black out there in the snow.
"No way you're shirtless and I'm not," he said as he broke away just enough to remove his own robes and shirt, tossing both unceremoniously onto the floor. Harry's hands found Draco's waist and pulled him flush against his chest, their skin meeting and causing them both to moan softly as Harry pressed his lips to Draco's again.
“That you will.”
“Not much to see,” she says with a thin smile. “Tiny place you have here, Mr. Potter.”
Harry hardly has room to navigate to the kitchen area with Teddy and his bag. Toys, clothes, and random clutter covers the scuffed wood floors that are exposed around the crowding furniture. Harry’s foot clips the edge of a chair as he nears the counter, knocking Teddy’s booster onto the floor with a loud clatter.
"Night, Abe."
"What the hell did you do?" Harry roared, his voice echoing.
"It's nearly midnight now, almost Sunday," she answered. At his silence, she bent over the table at his bedside and busied herself with a potion and glass. "You should rest, Mr. Malfoy. It's the only thing that can help you finish recovering at this point. I have a Calming Draught here. Concussions can cause rampant emotions that I don't need you indulging while your brain heals."
"I know."
They laid there for a moment, side by side and still naked, breathing into the silence as their hearts raced in sync. When Harry felt that he could breathe comfortably through his nose again without his lungs burning, he turned and snuggled into Draco's side. An arm snaked along his back, rubbing circles into his muscles. Harry closed his eyes as Draco's fingers gently combed through his hair.
To his left, the air shifted slightly as Draco appeared there, cloak in hand.
Gray eyes met green, and it was only then that Harry became overly aware of how close they were. Mere inches separated their faces. He could feel Malfoy's stuttering breath hitting his lips as they stared at one another for several moments.
Draco nodded but didn't turn around.
voice, finding the source of all his problems standing within cursing range, Draco’s fury pounds harder, heavier. Potter’s face is tinged pink, contorted in just as much disgust as Draco feels.
He jumped at the soft voice. Sickening guilt threatened to drown him when he saw the wide, protruding eyes of Luna Lovegood staring at him from the end of the corridor.
There were only a handful of customers quietly browsing the shelves, making it easy to spot Malfoy a few rows in talking softly with Luna. Malfoy's head was bowed slightly to speak with Luna as she seemed to be combing the shelves, speaking softly back. Luna had been on friendly terms with Malfoy longer than Harry had, but the scene still stirred some surprise.
Teddy, the strange little Metamorphmagus that moved into Draco’s home, into his life, into his heart no more than a year previous. It’s Teddy that keeps Draco from falling into a grieving mess. Not that it’s his fault.
The crying stopped.
"See you, Abe!"
A soft grunt twitched Harry's chest. Draco glanced down at the face on his shoulder. After a moment of slow squirming, Harry's eyes fluttered open, glazed over from sleep. He looked up at Draco and smiled lazily before leaning up and pressing a small kiss to Draco's lips.
"You ought to turn to the ingredients detail," Malfoy said, setting the vials up on the small burner kit Slughorn had passed out.
Massaging his temples roughly, Potter grumbles something under his breath. Draco finishes his own breakfast amid the pouting, but when he goes to take his plate and Teddy’s to the sink, finds Potter giving the food almost a sorrowful gaze, Draco feels a shred of something akin to pity stir deep within. At the counter, he opts to set Teddy’s plate to the side and cast a Covering Charm over it. He doesn’t meet Potter’s bemused frown as he places it into the fridge.
Draco steps in his way. “Teddy eats more than I think you realize,” he says, voice blandly neutral, quite controlled. “It’s just more snacking than all at once.”
"I did the exact same thing," he said, trying to collect himself. "Obviously, I asked your mother, too, but I did the same fucking thing, Draco."
Chase’s brows shoot up. “Does that make it easier to work with him?”
Harry looked down at the vials. Prohibis Spiritum, Baneberry, and Blood-duct. "Alright, easy enough, right?"
Draco gasped softly. Heart fluttering in anticipation, Harry brought his hands up and rested them on Draco's waist, the closet only just affording him enough room to do so. They breathed into the minuscule space between them, neither moving but for the rising and falling of their chests.
“-but how he treats Teddy will. Remember, your parents held great status in our society yet were horrible to you. And look how you turned out.”
"Alright, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy. Today I'd like you two to concoct a De-Aging Solution. You can find the ingredients in your textbook under Pellis Novis. Now hop to!"
Draco hates it.
"No."
seep couch. Hawee seep Daco.”
"Come on, let's find this formula and get back where it's warm."
Malfoy's brows knitted together. "I'm not hiding."
“You’ve got to show him that you follow through.”
It had been a rather beautiful wedding, even if all Harry had to go by was Bill and Fleur's wedding three years previous. They hadn't worried about a tent this time, Hermione wanting to be able to watch the sun set as she and Ron exchanged vows, so the ceremony easily transitioned into the outdoor party that was the current reception. Thanks to Charlie and George, and likely Mr. Weasley, who greatly approved of Hermione, the party was rather well stocked with alcohol. It made for a spectacularly loud and rambunctious occasion.
There was no way. There was no way that this was happening, Harry thought. It wasn't that he didn't think Draco could ever not love or want him back, nothing that conceited. It wasn't that he didn't think Draco was definitely scared and confused after seeing the article. It wasn't that he didn't expect a bump after that.
“I...look, Teddy, it’s late,” Harry finally whispers. “Let’s just lie down and get some sleep, yeah?”
Typical.
“How the hell do you even know where I live?”
Harry let himself be dragged back into the swarm. The silver band on his finger felt like a beacon on him, the amplified proclamation of love that he had once told Draco he wished to shout from the rooftops. Finally, he felt that he had fulfilled that promise.
Harry stood in the snow for a moment before he realized that Professor McGonagall had already begun walking, leaving him several feet behind. He scrambled to catch up to her, slipping on the ice below his numbing feet.
Harry's eyes snapped open. Right. He was in trouble. He couldn't remember seeing Professor McGonagall looking so cross. Harry nodded silently at her reddening face, standing clumsily from the barstool. The world gave a violent tilt, and Harry's hands slapped the countertop to keep from falling flat on his face.
Harry hadn't seen Draco the rest of the day. He hadn't been at lunch, dinner, the library, or anywhere else Harry could think to look for him, leaving Harry with nothing but haunting thoughts and a runaway imagination that kept making Harry lose Draco over and over again. The worst of it was when Harry sat picking at his dinner, eyes on the Slytherin table, when he realized that it had been roughly 24 hours since he and Draco had lost their virginities together.
“What? Where am I supposed to sleep?”
“He’s
"What did?"
Ms. Dribble leans in, softens her voice. “Teddy, dear? Do you like going to visit Draco Malfoy?”
Harry stiffens, and Draco knows instantly that there is no appointment scheduled. Thinking fast, he says, “I have the specific date written down somewhere, but it’s toward the end of September.”
Several seats away is Malfoy.
Draco didn't answer but instead brought his legs up, wrapped them around Harry's waist, and pulled him closer. The low groan that came out of Draco's throat when the tip of Harry's cock pressed against the same spot his finger had touched earlier gave Harry all the answer he needed.
As someone commented about my tags, I'm sorry if they're insufficient. I'm still getting used to tagging things and will likely return to edit the tags as I get the hang of AO3.
Ron hums, following Harry as they make their way back into the bland conference room where most of their instruction on departmental policy takes place. Necessary though it is, it never ceases to be endlessly boring. Yet when their instructor, a thinning old wizard named Lawrence Planters, shuffles in, his words have every trainee sitting up marginally straighter.
"Well...maybe he's not avoiding you. Maybe he's just avoiding everybody."
“Coddley?”
Harry groaned. Of course Luna wouldn't have been discreet. "I didn't tell her to follow you. I asked her to check on you."
Harry raised his brows. "We all have."
"How's Malfoy?" she asked gently after a few moments. "Have you seen him today?"
The shaking in Malfoy's body calmed as the seconds ticked by, and finally, Malfoy broke the silence.
. The world around them didn't seem to exist, though Draco knew part of that was due to how close to fainting he was. It was just Harry and him, feet and legs freezing in the snow as Draco forced himself to breathe as deeply as he could, shaking with every inhale.
"Wait!" Karen reached out and grabbed a fistful of his robes. "Can't we be friends? Please?"
"I suppose it doesn't. But forgiveness doesn't have to make sense. Sometimes it just...is." Her wide eyes narrowed slightly. "Are you feeling alright? You look as though you swallowed something foul."
Harry took out a fresh roll of parchment and his quill and began copying the notes, pleasantly surprised that he remembered most of it without needed to read it word for word. It took barely ten minutes, and when he sat back and offered Hermione's notes back, he wasn't surprised to find her head buried in a textbook.
"So...is it true?"
"No more, uh..." Neville glanced down the table, nodding again. "None of that, right?"
There was a short silence, and then Draco heard the chair beside him move as Potter made to share the desk with him. Draco swallowed dryly. He definitely couldn't breathe right. He looked around and saw all the expected glares thrown his way, as though Draco had planned all along to steal the deskmate of the century away from them.
“May we come in?”
Three of the potions brewed had been left alone, which Draco's group was given to test. The other two potions had been laced with the veritaserum, which Harry's group was given. The class stood, vials in their hands for a moment fraught with anticipation before they all drank together as though on cue.
Ron shivers. “Still doesn’t sound right, calling him that.”
Harry frowns as he meets Draco’s eyes, searching. He’s been struggling with Teddy and food since the start of all this, and there has been more than one argument over it amid the three of them. But for the first time, Draco seems to be making a genuine offer to be on Harry’s side. Part of him wonders what the catch is, but all Harry can bring himself to say is, “Er...thanks.”
"Really," he said.
“So this is the Weasley family to which you’re referring?” Mr. Cook interrupts. Harry nods. “Well, we’ll see if we can arrange an interview with Mrs. Weasley in the next few weeks.”
Rage erupts in Harry’s chest, storming in his heart, burning his face as he grinds his teeth together, shaking with fury. It’s too close to the truth, to the insecurities that puncture Harry’s once rock-solid belief that everything he did had been necessary to defeat Voldemort. It's happened before, happened numerous times, but at Malfoy's hand? It's too far.
“Well, there is a lot wrong with you, son. At least as far as paperwork goes. And you know how much the Ministry loves their paperwork.”
"I'm up, I'm up," Potter said, eyes still on Draco as he answered Weasley.
“Definitely,” Harry agrees with an awkward chuckle. He watches as the old witch disappears to inspect the flat. Mr. Cook is helping himself to the sitting area, pulling out his Quick-Notes Quill and parchment. Harry joins him, Teddy still a deadweight. “So, good day, Mr. Cook?”
worth the time and trouble to not die of sleep deprivation."
But what Draco took away from her letter, something she hadn't even written, was the fact that there was no one he needed to please in order to be happy. He could be happy for himself.
"I'm not..." Harry exhaled. "I'm not going to hurt you."
Teddy looks up to Mr. Cook, then to Ms. Dribble, who moves toward the bedrooms. “Uhm...hi.”
"I'm-I'm sorry," Harry panted. "I didn't mean-I didn't-"
"I...I'm sorry to be causing so much trouble."
But surely not this time.
Friends? Draco felt the coffee bubble in his stomach as fresh nausea washed over him. "We can't be friends," he said thickly, trying not to vomit.
“Merlin, stop,” Draco says with a roll of his eyes. “This is ridiculous, the Chosen One stressing that the Ministry that loves him so much won’t just adore him for existing.”
"Returning to Hogwarts?" Ron rolled his eyes. "Honestly, I'd've rather taken the Ministry job. But Hermione made some good points about going back, I suppose."
In the center of the room, surrounded by creature figurines that move on their miniature stands, is Teddy; laid out on his stomach, head down, and fast asleep as though he fell unconscious in the middle of playing.
Still groggy, Teddy only looks at the Care-Seeker, face expressionless. Harry gives him a gentle jostle.
“Go on, now. Go get some sleep. It’ll all look better in the mornin’.”
Draco did, his lungs protesting at the air trapped there, but upon releasing, Draco's vision cleared considerably. He could see the dark fabric of Harry's cloak in front of him, his pink face just inches from his own.
he would take Teddy into his own bed after their conversation last night, Draco begins making a breakfast large enough to feed all three of them. It’ll show Teddy that they’re a united group, something almost reminiscent of a family, Draco thinks spitefully as he stirs the eggs.
It had been Kingsley Shacklebolt, newly Minister of Magic, that suggested the idea, and Harry had agreed despite his deep wish to vanish from everything at the time. It had only been hours after Fred's funeral that Harry had been approached with the idea. The Ministry had struggled with how to handle the Hogwarts students that had committed crimes while under the Carrow's regime. Did their mere age acquit them? Or should they pay just as much as though they were adults?
“Toddlers often bite off more than they can chew,” Ms. Dribble says, turning toward the kitchen.
"That's not even an answer."
Harry helps Teddy pull a chair up to the counter. “I didn’t fail. I had to get good enough marks to be accepted into the Auror program, didn’t I?”
Putting on an air of great surprise, Harry tilts his head. “Oh, I didn’t realize that having a career and a future that will actually provide for Teddy was a bad decision on the Ministry’s part. Especially if the only other option is an ex-Death Eater that works for a potions shop.”
"Sorry," Harry said, rubbing his eyes. "I just-"
"Really, Malfoy."
“Ugh!” Harry throws his hands up. “Go get ready for the bath, I…I’ll be there in a second.”
Draco glanced at him, but Potter was still looking at Weasley as though trying to hold a conversation with just their eyes. If only wanting something to do, Draco removed his cap and mittens, setting them on the table.
"Er...no."
“I’m not-”
"I don't want that, either," he said, and he meant it. "Ron really is a gormless idiot sometimes, but I know he cares about you."
Mr. Cook raises a surprised brow. “Teddy’s case, Harry. What will become of him now that he has lost nearly all his family. Though Mr. Malfoy is the last of Teddy’s blood relatives, you are Teddy’s legally appointed godfather.”
As Kingsley makes his way through the opening speech, Harry tries his best to both keep an eye on Teddy at his feet and look incredibly solemn yet attentive toward the stage. Although there are no flashes, camera clicks litter the quiet of the audience, the light applause as Kingsley steps away to make room for the first speaker.
Fred's old school trunk was much like Harry's own trunk had been. Dark, hard material, locks that were tattered after years of use, though several brightly colored sweets littered the bottom, much unlike Harry's had. Not sure if the sweets were innocent or unfinished prototypes of the joke shop, Harry reached into the depths of each corner, removing the bright candies and placing them atop the dusty nightstand.
"And I can hardly blame you," she said, speaking as though she didn't hear his half-hearted denial. "I know you don't mourn your father. He was terrible to you, even before the Dark Lord rose again." She closed her eyes for a moment. "I only wish I had been more aggressive in protecting you from him. No child deserves what Lucius put you through."
"Hello? Draco?"
"Happy Christmas, Happy Christmas," she said, patting them each on the shoulder as they passed. Draco tried not to look too uncomfortable as he stepped inside the home.
Potter's behavior, however, caused him far more anxiety.
“Of course I did! You’ve kept him from me ever since the Ministry just handed him to you, and I won’t allow it anymore!”
“What in Merlin’s name are you even doing here?” Draco hisses. “It’s not even two o’clock.”
Lucius Malfoy. Dead.
The conversation was quickly drifting into the realm of what Draco found to be rather uncomfortable. "Look, I don't know if I'm the right person for this-"
But Draco wasn't a complete fool. For all his avoidance of those that were desperately trying to tell him the truth, he knew that it was somewhat outrageous to think that the Department of Magical Law Enforcement was after his mother because he had made a friend in Harry Potter. It wasn't entirely plausible, though what Draco had told Hermione was the truth - he couldn't take the risk that his choices weren't affecting his mother the way the media had detailed. They were all each other had. Draco would be damned if he was going to cause her any more trouble.
Harry gave one last teasing thrust before stepping back, letting Draco's hands fall. It was a gorgeous sight, Draco naked and wanting him, one that Harry wasn't sure he would ever properly get used to even if he wanted. Draco pushed off the wall and took Harry's hand.
Harry sighed, wishing he hadn't been so quick to anger. But Ron simply gave his shoulder another pat and left, leaving the door open as a reminder to follow. Harry rubbed his eyes once more, then stood and made his way downstairs.
“Yeah, sure.” Harry’s eyes are closed again. The loveseat is soft, sucking him into the worn cushions like a fierce but loving caress. He has about three-quarters of an hour until the Care-Seekers arrive. He can afford to rest for five minutes.
The bed was fairly small, definitely not big enough to give two grown men adequate room for sleeping. He could sleep on the floor or in the common room. But what if someone found Malfoy before Harry woke up, or Malfoy woke first and drew attention to himself in his confusion? Harry didn't think many other Gryffindors would be too pleased to find Draco Malfoy of all people in their House in the middle of the night.
But still, Draco's heart fluttered happily as he relived Harry telling him that he loved Draco not just once but twice. When the train had stopped and Hermione and Weasley had left them alone for a moment, Harry had grabbed Draco's hand and pressed a quick peck to his cheek.
“Ah-wee otay?” Teddy asks again. At least he’s whispering.
Thank Merlin Malfoy is shut away in his room, Harry thinks when he returns to the living room. Malfoy would no doubt sneer, force Harry’s nose into the fact that Teddy has, in fact, fallen asleep on his own.
"Then you're a fool, too."
A very pregnant, very strained pause follows. Harry’s stomach officially begins to simmer with anticipation.
"Hope you're ready to have your backside handed to you."
“Think about it, Harry. Draco’s always been vain, that’s no secret, but his appearance is the one thing in his life he’s had control over.” She paused for breath. “He’s ashamed of the Mark, you know. Tried to keep it out of my sight line at Azkaban. He knows people see that and assume the worst of him. And now he’s got to try to acclimate himself to a society that’s already prejudiced against him. How do you think he’s going to feel when he has to walk in public, not only with the Mark, but you poking holes in him like a Crup toy? Or is that your plan, to deny him the right to be accepted by shuttering him away with you here at Grimmauld?” Her disappointment sat on his shoulders like weights. “It’s no way to live. You know that, so why in the hell would you put that on Draco?”
Harry leans further down and presses a soft kiss to Draco's forehead. When he pulls back, Draco's eyes are wide and glassy. He brushes the back of his hand over Draco's cheek. "No, Draco, thank you. And because you've been so good, I think you've earned some kissing."
Potter snagged him by the back of the neck and jerked him forward, sinking his fangs into Draco's neck. The vampire's rough groan of approval vibrated through him and into Draco's bones. He resisted the initial urge to surrender and go pliantly into Potter's rough hold. The last vestiges of his anger still thrummed in his blood, unwilling to acquiesce so easily. His hands grasped at Potter's shoulders, anchoring them both where they stood. The pull at his neck softened, as if a gentler touch might be an apology, but the hard erection that jammed into his groin offered no such penitence. Part of him thought it would serve Potter right if he left him with no release, but the other part, the Malfoy that had resurfaced had other ideas.
They stepped further inside and Draco looked up at the bounding of footsteps down the stairs. Granger smiled and headed toward him, with Weasley behind her, calling out, “They’re here!”
Harry presses a kiss to his ear. "So polite. So obedient. I like that."
Draco gapes at him, pupils blown wide with incredulity, unable to speak. He's thinking about it, Harry knows, has to be because they're close enough to touch now. He's thinking about what it would be like to be in Harry's bed, trussed up and exposed, naked, with nothing but the promise of pleasure between them. Harry knows because it's the same thought that's running rampant in his head at the moment. The same thought that's got him hard in his jeans, itching to run his hands and his mouth all over Draco's prone body, leaving marks of said worship behind like a victory flag.
"Were you guessing? Were you hoping I'd pop up and save you all? Is that it?"
"Yes," Potter snapped, shaking in place. "You would have. It was the right thing to do." He stilled, and it softened out Potter's edges before he added, "You've done it before. You've saved me before."
She settles herself onto the bench, prepared to watch as he turns around and kneels in front of the bed of rosebushes. "If anyone can do it, Neville, I think it's you."
When they enter, Harry is surprised to see Neville chatting quietly over breakfast with Narcissa. His eyes automatically go to Draco to appraise his reaction. His step falters a bit, nothing more. He greets his mother with an affectionate kiss to the cheek and his words for Neville are reserved, but filled with genuine warmth.
, she thinks,
"What I'm saying is that you don't have to. Maybe I can help." With that, he turns back around and gives the bushes his full attention.
Draco steps under the beat of the spray, rinsing out his hair, even as his hand starts pumping over his cock. Soap runs in his eyes with a slight sting, but even the hint of a burn only serves to heighten his arousal. The drag of his palm is bracing, and the faster it moves, the more the breath catches in his lungs. He throws his head back, giving into the harsh build of pressure, and lets the water cascade over his face and neck. It's Harry's hand on him now, he imagines behind closed eyes. Harry's hand stroking over his flesh, Harry's body next to him, Harry's words whispering in his ear.
Draco's arms ascend gracefully over his head, and his fingers curl around the metal frame above where the chain is anchored into place. He doesn't go around to face Draco, instead preferring to fasten him in from behind. Harry's hands work quickly, buckling him in securely.
“There was no other concrete evidence, and he didn’t do anything anyway.”
Potter’s finger was dexterous, moving slowly back and forth until a second could be added. The pressure at his neck lessened as Potter slid another finger inside, scissoring them in a delicious stretch. The vampire’s cock pressed at his groin, rubbing in short stabs that mimicked the movement of his fingers. Nonsensical sounds tumbled from Draco’s lips, a chant of gasps, hisses, and broken pleas as Potter’s fingers pumped in and out of his arse with focused precision.
"But we sat down after Par—Pansy, I'm supposed to call her Pansy now—left. We talked about it, and it was different afterward than we thought. It was, I dunno,
“We don’t stand on ceremony at the Burrow, Draco. It’s Arthur to you.” He fought back the urge to gape at the overt friendliness. Was it possible that the age-old feud had withered and died along with Lucius Malfoy and his prejudices?
"It's done wonders for your complexion, my love. You look almost new."
Malfoy's smile goes a bit firmer. "Tinky decided she wanted to wear nothing but tutus and for us to call her 'Cook'. Because that's what she does, she says. She 'cooks'. I know, it's all a bit weird, but honestly, she's an outright menace if she doesn't get her way."
Thank you for waiting so patiently. I'm just going to leave this right here.
"No," Harry chuckles as he shakes his head. "That was a particularly strong anti-wrinkle charm with a touch of an arousal-inhibiting hex." Harry stares straight into Draco's eyes. "The next time he gets an erection, he'll break out in hives. Very unpleasant."
"I know," Draco says soberly. His voice goes quiet and soft around the edges, and his eyes search the rug beneath his feet. "It's just that if I take his place, it means he's really gone. If I can still be angry with him, then it's like he's still here. If I lose that and accept what he left for me, then he's really dead." Draco's eyes glance up to meet Harry's, and Harry is lost in the pain he sees there. "As much as he hated me, as enormous a bastard as he was, he was still my father. And there's a rather large part of me that doesn't want him to be gone. Because even after everything, I still love him."
Harry stands outside Draco's door, keeping himself in check. The wards around Draco's door ripple lightly, and then with a stronger, more warning pulse. He rolls his eyes and sighs, whispering into the air, "Really? You know I have intention of hurting him."
It was late, and Draco didn’t really feel like gearing up to make his first appearance in the world at large just yet. “Why don’t we go tomorrow afternoon, before we head to the Weasley supper?”
Harry throws a sheet over the easel and swivels in the chair to face him. "Of course not. I was just finishing up for the night."
But Draco’s body was no longer content to stand pliant, and against all good judgment, he began to move. He writhed beneath Potter, arching into him, his traitorous body all but begging for more. The action sparked something in the vampire, and suddenly his hands were everywhere, teasing and stroking, ghosting over his water-slick skin. Potter’s hands mapped out the planes of Draco’s chest and arms, and when his hand slid down to cover the Dark Mark and squeeze, Draco cried out in reckless abandon.
Draco grabbed at Potter's arm to keep from falling over. He chuckled and righted Draco with a pat to the shoulder. "Catch up. I'm going to grab a nap." And then Potter left him, alone in a potions lab, with his dead godfather.
“Left unchecked, your friend will only grow bolder. He has shunned every attempt we have made to bring him into our fold and teach him ways to accept what he has become,” Silvestri said. “How long before he does kill someone, or Turn another without approval? We have laws and treaties for a reason. To ensure that we can coexist peacefully. If he tramples that trust, and my people decide to rally against him, even I won’t be able to stop the war that will ensue.”
Hermione cleared her throat and chanced a glance at Potter. “Draco, would you give us a moment, please?” He briefly entertained the notion that Potter shouldn’t be left alone with her, but put that out of his head in an instant. Temper he may have, but Draco didn’t think deep down that he could be as callous as to hurt her. Strangers, in a hunger and rage induced state, hell yes, but a bossy Granger? Not likely.
"Color?"
When Harry walks through the door, he isn't disappointed.
. Harry's fairly certain his heart knows the difference between the two, but the curve of Draco's neck and the long line of his warm body, standing so close, has his body struggling to remember.
“And what about a man? The light scratch of stubble against your cheek, perhaps? Deeper, breathier moans, the feel of hard muscle beneath you. The weight of a cock in your hand? The taste of it in your mouth?”
Draco's head drifted lower in subservience. "Draco is being Master Potter's warm meal. Draco is knowing his usefulness."
Harry's hand lowers outside the cracked door to what appears to be Draco's study. It's ajar enough to allow him to look inside without being seen from the hallway. Draco's bent slightly at the waist, with his back to the door, speaking with a good-looking bloke from the Floo. He makes a mental note to ask how many Floos the Manor has, since there seems to be one in just about every room.
"You're a bit…overdressed, aren't you?" Potter replied.
She nods, divesting herself of snow as well. He's turned away from her, kneeling down to dig around in the soil at the base of the rosebushes, and she takes the opportunity to slip off her shoes. She wiggles her toes in the warm grass and pulls two items out of her own coat pocket. She places her coat next to Neville's and drops her items on the ground.
, and the moan that comes out of his mouth is patently obscene. He feels Potter’s dark chuckle as it shivers its way down his body, ending at the tip of his confined cock. It’s the fastest he’s ever gotten hard in his life. And by Merlin, he is hard.
." He punctuates the last word with a hard grind. Draco's hands shoot out to rest on the edge of the table for support, and he whimpers. "All I can think about is getting my hands on you and fucking you until neither of us can see straight." There's a gasp that sounds suspiciously like a
Harry reaches out and cradles her to him in a one-armed hug. He presses a small kiss to the top of her head and replies, "I know, Blinky. I know."
"Sounds lucrative."
Draco's earned touch. The look of sheer wonder on his face has earned everything.
"Then why are you here?"
"Still doesn't make it anything but rude." He steps back, crosses his arms over his chest and glares. "I'd like to know what possessed you to come here."
"You can take cuttings too, although they won't be everlasting. In case you wanted to bring some blooms home. The plants will recover." Potter's voice was soft and entreating, but the darkness in his eyes still remained, lurking in the background. Draco shook it off and turned, heading around the front of the structure to the entrance.
“How much of that did you hear?” he asked.
Harry's brows furrow and he shakes his head. "What do you mean?"
In the meantime, he's busied himself with rearranging the studio. He's sent Blinky to Grimmauld more than once to retrieve some of his favored supplies and a few personal belongings, and also to reassure Kreacher that he's fine.
"I think that would be a good thing," Neville says on a sigh. "Harry needs someone to balance him and challenge him at the same time. No one's ever seemed to push his buttons like Draco."
Draco stopped and turned into Potter's body. No warmth radiated from the vampire, and he supposed it was odd that it didn't bother him all that much. Potter's coldness was different from the chill in the air, which was bracing and harsh. Potter was cool like a sea breeze on a hot day, refreshing and light, with all the power to restore and invigorate. It wasn't the oppressive frost of winter, but the fresh gust of early spring winds that coaxed flowers into bloom and life to be reborn.
There was something in that statement that begged the question, “Protect me from what?”, but the doors in Potter’s face slammed shut, leaving behind an inscrutable mask. Even if he had asked, he knew he wouldn’t get a straight answer.
Blinky pours from a silver pitcher, and Harry tucks into his breakfast because he doesn't know how to follow showy house magic. "Pass the salt" seems a bit underwhelming.
He murmurs gentle praise into Draco's ear as he releases his neck and strokes him through the aftershocks. Draco's head falls against the back of the couch, eyes closed as he shudders. Harry eases his fingers from Draco's body and gives him a moment to recover.
"That is the kind of man who is worth your everything. That is kind of man who is worth my son." She steps forward to cradle his face in her hands. Her fingers brush the fringe back from his eyes, and he looks into her face to see a wanting sadness there. "Listen to me, Draco. You can trust Harry. He values the things and people that are important to him. He will honor you, in your bedroom and out. He wants a partner, above all else. He will want you to stand beside him, not behind him. Because
The tall brunette smiled, her dark red lips glossy in the light.
"But you want to," Ron says, scrutinizing him with a squint. "I knew he was always a poncy git, but I didn't think he was, you know,
He pulls back, and Draco nods shakily at him, licking at his lips.
He raises his arms and cranes his neck around to where her eyes are focused. "Oh, my back? Yes, it's a tattoo."
." He waits while Malfoy stares at him, bewildered.
He's pacing back and forth now, heavy stomps on expensive inlaid flooring.
"I swear to Merlin if you don't put that thing away, I will throw you out on your arse!" He leans in to punctuate, "Lower. Your. Fucking. Wand."
"I'll think about it, yeah? How's that?" Harry offers her a genuine smile, but her expression doesn't change. She's not fooled, the Slytherin.
It's a veritable screech, highly undignified, and terribly amusing.
“Why? Does it disgust you?” he shot back.
Harry ignores him and starts a mental countdown in his head as he strolls lazily around the room, because it's only a matter of time before Malfoy's temper gets the best of him. Despite Malfoy's earlier urgings of his quelled fire, Harry knows it's bound to make an appearance sooner or later. They will never fail to push each other's buttons.
Harry's cock jumps in his trousers.
Potter moved like a flash, and Draco gasped as he appeared right in front of him. He grabbed Draco’s left hand and placed it on his chest. “You’re the idiot,” he growled. “Mine doesn’t beat anymore. But I can feel yours inside me.”
"Distressed?" Draco half-laughs. "She was absolutely livid with me for being an idiot. She warned me about Blaise in the first place, but I was just out of prison, Father had died, our reputation was in shambles, and we were scraping by on our last galleon. Admittedly, I didn't intend to fall into bed with Blaise. I went to Switzerland for the purpose of rebuilding the family wealth. I thought Blaise would merely be the cherry on the sundae." He lowers his gaze to the floor and shakes his head. "I was wrong."
Potter’s back tensed with all the poise of snake ready to strike. “Push me, and you’ll see how far those chains will extend. I daresay they’ll be long enough for me to rip out your throat.”
“Is that--?”
“Tell me, how is he, honestly?” The pointed question came as no surprise.
"Do not finish that sentence. You're not here because you want to be. You're here because you've been thinking about him, about me, about yourself, and you don't want to try to figure out what you want. It's messy and confusing, and you wish it would all go away. So you're here. Because you think a rough fuck will clear your head. You think a hard ride will either get Blaise out of your system, or you out of mine. But it won't make things easier. It will only complicate them more. I've never taken a lover against their will, and I'm not going to start tonight. Because I won't have you in my bed and then watch you walk out of here ashamed of what we've done." Harry exhales, long and slow, running a hand over his face. "Letting me fuck you isn't going to fix your issues with Blaise. If that's what you need, then you need to see a Mind Healer. And if you do, I will support you, but we cannot have a physical relationship with his shadow lurking over us. I would rather have you whole as a friend than broken as a lover."
Draco's response is a muffled groan.
Deep in slumber, the expanse of his chest rises and falls with soft, slow breaths, and his plush, pink lips are slightly parted. He is peaceful, quiet in languorous sleep, and so beautiful that Harry's breath evaporates. Unfettered by the slick gels from their Hogwarts days, his platinum hair looks soft as corn silk as it spreads out across the pillow. Harry's fingers curl by his side with the urge to
Potter groans, hot and humid, into his mouth and resumes attempting to take Draco apart with kisses alone. He mouths at the edge of Draco’s jaw, just under his ear, and licks at the strip of skin there. He gasps at the sensation, and Potter murmurs his approval while a hand snakes up to tangle in his hair. Potter’s fingers curl and
"Of course you are!" Draco hisses in return. "I'm not stupid. Don't think I don't know what all your
“I noticed.”
"With pleasure."
"Thanks," Potter murmured, moving quickly to the Weasley's floral-bedecked couch.
Draco huffed, but did as he was told, donning a crisp black robe. He turned back and did a saucy twirl. "Does this meet with your approval?"
"You thought he would kill you," Draco pointed out. "And you were going to let him. Suicide by fangs?" Draco tsked. "Sad."
"You're absolute shit at chess, Harry."
Malfoy's stride doesn't break in the slightest. Harry likes that. Much more than he probably should. It means that he didn't startle Malfoy, that Malfoy's been aware of him the entire time. Awareness is a good thing because awareness precipitates anticipation.
Surprisingly, it's more than acceptable. "I think that's a fabulous idea, Cissa."
"I know." Potter's voice was subdued. "I kept my distance to hold onto the moment, but I've learned the tighter I hold onto what is, I lose my grip on what could be. And in hanging onto that, I lost everything entirely. The past, the present, the future. You." Draco watched a fine tremor work its way over Potter's body. "I didn't want to love you because I didn't want to have something precious and then lose it. I had lost so much, Draco. I couldn't afford to lose anymore."
, of all things, his heart slams in his chest. Because that tiny gesture, so fleeting and imperceptible, makes Harry want like he hasn't wanted in months.
Draco's hands reach for the buttons on his shirt, but Harry intervenes.
Whatever he'd been doing all this time, combined with the owled vials of Draco's blood every other day, was doing wonders for the vampire's health. All Potter's rough edges had smoothed out, leaving him polished, honed, with an inner glow that radiated from the bright green of his eyes. Even in standard Muggle wear, Potter looked fit. His skin, which still held the classic vampiric pallor, was smooth, tight, and toned. The dark shadows that had haunted his face had vanished, making him look oddly refreshed for an undead creature. Vibrant, even.
"Yes?"
Draco's eyelashes flutter and he pulls his bottom lip between his teeth. "Anything to be in your good graces, sir."
"So you push him away, pretend you don't care? Because you think it will hurt less if something does happen to him?" A suspicious gleam appeared in the corner of Potter's eyes, one that threatened at wetness. "You're already invested, surely you see that? It's going to hurt no matter what if you lose him. You have to ask yourself which is worse, having nothing but happy memories, or regretting having nothing at all?"
"I mean it, who in their right mind wants to end up bare-arsed on this tragic excuse for fabric? It's an affront to everything I hold dear," Draco protested. Potter hauled him up with a gleam of fond exasperation.
"And it's helping, you say?" Draco asked. As if he really needed to ask the question at all—it was all written there on Potter's face. Potter was in a far better place than when Draco had left.
"I guess I'm helping already," he says, mouthing against her lips.
Like it fucking always is.
Draco's mouth fell open as words escaped him.
Pain danced behind his field of vision and his eyes closed against the sharpness of Potter’s fangs biting down. All at once, Potter came
Harry braces himself on one elbow, and tightens his grip in Draco's hair, pulling him off enough to leverage himself to fuck up into Draco's throat. Draco moans at that, a full-body sound that nourishes Harry's soul. Draco's urging him on, wanting it faster and deeper, and Harry complies until his orgasm screams up out of nowhere.
“Oh,” Draco said softly. Potter made no move to leave, and there was no way Draco was sauntering out of bed with his bits swinging around for the vampire to see. “If you don’t mind,” he said, gesturing to the door, “I’d like to get dressed. I’m naked under here if you haven’t noticed.”
"It could be because I talk to the woman. We have lunch every other Monday. She handles my Ministry Oversight Portfolio."
“What did you do that for?” Draco asked.
"I don't think—"
Harry swallowed, unwilling to go down that road. "So what will you do now? Since you're done with NEWTs?"
Granger’s eyes turned soft, and he looked away, afraid to see her pity reflected there. When she spoke, it was calm and empathetic, and his head turned on its own volition. No pity, just sadness. “You can help each other. Please, Malfoy. You’re the only one who can help him.”
Draco says nothing, merely lets his gaze linger on the comforts of Harry's room, taking in the low lights and fire crackling in the hearth. His eyes skim over the bed and then return to it, falling there for a second or two before his head swivels around to look at Harry and subject him to the same gentle scrutiny.
Draco lay in bed, unable to sleep. The sounds of light snoring drifted into his four-poster bed much to his displeasure. As effective as the
Well, technically Potter had cornered him but Draco had held a conversation with him, stood too bloody close to him.
Draco laughed. “Yes, when your mother told you to.”
“I think we should skip the pie today.”
The professor clearly knew Draco was being sarcastic but to fault him for anything would appear capricious even for the old man. His eyes narrowed.
"Feel free to put it in your tea," he said with a magnanimous wave, "it's about as bitter as – let's see, how would you put it – ah, hippogriff piss."
Harry thought about the liquids he’d poured into the bath. So many vivid reds and deep purples, greens like the grass on the Malfoy fields and browns like warm caramel and blacks like the Great Lake. Whether or not they were aphrodisiacs mattered little considering their current situation.
“I have always been eager, godfather. But unlike you, I have accepted that part of myself, made it a weapon. It cannot hurt me anymore.”
nervous, but Malfoy didn’t need to know that any more than he already did.
{HPDM}
He didn't know why he wanted to say it either. He didn't know if he was upset because Ron had been nagging him or because of something else. The conversation in the shower jumped to mind and Harry shoved it away as hard as he could.
“You… slapped me.”
He swallowed and huddled closer.
“Go,” Dean had said and turned back to the Great Hall. “I’ll tell them all that flying has you exhausted.”
Then the floodgates were thrown open and Harry spilt all over the sheets in a burst of bright light. Draco followed soon after and semen mingled with blood and sweat on the sheets.
“About the jackets?”
The large gulp of air he took wasn’t enough. He took several more before he turned and searched the water for Pansy and Blaise.
Still, Draco wouldn’t presume himself to be the cause of Nott’s current state. It would be egotistical to think he still had that level of influence over him. It was more likely that he had his own problems though Draco couldn’t understand why someone would want to have the presence of mind for forty-eight consecutive hours.
"... no?"
“Just make the…” he gestured towards the abandoned ingredients, “thing.”
Harry chuckled and pressed his lips to Draco’s. Cool and spearmint laden. They were as familiar as they had come to be these past weeks and he loved their taste and feel against his own lips.
“From who?”
“He’s going to kill you.”
"By what law?" demanded Firenze.
Harry started to point this out but Malfoy had already raised his wand. He muttered something to the rustic wooden door. It swung open and he stepped in as though he'd done this before. Harry followed and heard Malfoy shut the door behind him with a resounding clink.
Harry forced himself to focus on the empty corridor before them now. Even without Ron and Hermione at his side, it would be difficult to get away. Where to was still undecided. And although they walked in silence, Harry could see in their eyes today would be the day they made him talk. He clenched his fists and wished he could turn around and walk away.
He smoothed down his shirt and put on his jumper. "No thank you. I'd prefer not to bet on whose idea it was to murder me."
Harry watched as he got out the ceramic tin of lubricant from the bedside cabinet. He dipped his fingers into it and lowered them to Harry’s entrance. The suddenness of a cool finger slipping into him had him gasping. And then he was moving against Draco’s finger. It didn’t matter because he didn't linger.
“Six. Go back to sleep.”
“Draco,” he said again, voice strained.
“What do you mean there's no going back?” she asked with a quivering voice. “What’s done?”
{HPDM}
“Thank you,” he said.
Alphard had instructed them to meet him in the solarium in fifteen minutes. Draco hadn’t taken kindly to that. Not the solarium, at least from what Harry could tell, but how long he’d given them. He considered it a personal affront that Alphard thought fifteen minutes was enough for him to get off.
“Harry,” Hermione said not meeting his gaze. “He could be somewhere else.”
When he climbed down the stairs, he was surprised to see her seated opposite Lupin at the table. Both had steaming mugs of tea before them and looked up when he came into the dining room. Harry’s attention was on something else.
"May I ask why?"
"Ginny? What are you doing?" he asked.
Golden flecked grey eyes stared into his in question.
"Your essay," he said pointedly.
Draco’s fingers tightened around Harry’s elbows and he had a good mind to yank it away but he turned to him and said, “Fifteen minutes. The abandoned stairwell.”
Blaise hadn’t even thought to hide it. Draco wanted to laugh at his own stupidity.
“Don’t touch the bond,” Lupin said. “Promise me you won’t.”
He didn’t know when he’d become accustomed to the weighty silence in the corridors of Malfoy Manor. He didn’t know he’d become accustomed to being ignored. He didn’t know he had become accustomed to coming and going as he pleased.
Their first game against Slytherin was in November – a good month away – but Harry had just come into his Captaincy and losing to the Slytherins would not be a good look. He relished the coaching aspect of it more than the administrative but he couldn’t deny that the new recruits were been getting better.
in his head.
He coated three fingers in the cool the liquid and Draco's gaze settled on him, eyes were more amber than grey. He smiled and Draco licked his lips, eyes flitting to his fingers.
{HPDM}
"Get your own," he seethed.
things?" he demanded. "Well, look at me, Potter. There is nothing wrong with me and I don't need your pity or your goddamn sympathy."
"That would be... unfortunate."
Harry looked to his right. The shadow of the repainted wall loomed over several sheaves of parchment that lay atop the cool marble surface. Harry brushed aside the quill and bottle of ink and lifted the first page.
“Who was it?”
“I don’t know,” he said before Harry spoke.
Malfoy glared at him. "You may as well just read about it yourself. I'm sure Dumbledore won't deny his precious puppet anything."
Well, it was a good thing they'd finished with the pitch, he didn't fancy watching them fly.
“What happens when you do wandless magic?”
"I am well aware."
He had no reason to expect Draco to be here, it had been too late to do send him a note by the time he got back from quidditch practice but he could wait five more minutes.
"Highly doubt that idiot part, Potter." He commented, trying to force a hint of sarcasm into his statement. It was merely an attempt that failed to slide off their heavy main topic. "And if you're so smart, why ask?"
- of disquiet. The boy he knocked into stood tall before him, looking firmly down at Draco's stone-hard figure. He didn't remember seeing him around before.
if only he could ignore the sparks of absolute despise that jumped off each one of them, and the growing heat of his body as he was around them, half knowing where this was going. All with Draco tossing random glares at both boys who accompanied him.
Draco kept looking down as he walked after that, hoping that it would help put down the thought of what everyone thought of him now, how they all viewed him as, hoping that by not seeing their burning gazes, he doesn't feel their unrequired attention.
"Oi, watch it there kid." He spoke with a very deep American accent, pushing him off his way.
"No, not
"Because you need help, Draco! And if you won't let me in, get someone else to help!" He almost yelled, throwing it right to his face. He was starting to regret his worry, regret his eagerness to help and wishing that he walked away when he had the chance.
He'd never been this close to him before, Harry thought. Their bodies never touched the way they did at that moment.
His heart sank at the sight of the yellowish envelope resting his father's hand, knowing what it was. He was gradually beginning to panic. His eyes slowly started blurring, it felt as though concrete was placed upon his chest, taking his breath away. The only thing he could hear was his heart pounding painfully loud all over him, he could swear it would explode at any given moment. He let himself slide down from his stance, slowly sitting down on the floor with his arms covering his head as he felt his tears threatening to stream down his face. He was like a powerless creature in defense.
"What are those, Draco?" His voice only sounded like a brittle breath as he so hard fought away a burning urge to collapse down in sobs. He tried to take in as much air as his lungs could allow in, hoping that it would drown that urge, it didn't help much.
Gently Harry sat him on the tall stool as if he couldn't sit on his own, his hand still holding Draco's arm in the softest grip. Unable to think of a reaction he could possibly give, Draco let himself go with the flow of Harry's choice, watching him looking around while mumbling incoherent things under his breath like a dissatisfied mother, with a rather puzzled look on the face. He tried assuring himself that the gryffindor was truly concerned, as it obviously looked like it, but no matter how hard he insisted on himself to believe so, somewhere within him he felt as though he was obligated to do all, annoyed with what he had to do. He wished he could tell him to stop, and he wished he would actually stop if he told him to, for he knew certainly there wasn't anything capable of stopping him regardless of how he felt about the task.
A roommate of his was still fast asleep, it didn't seem to be that early, judging by the faint chatter just outside the door. A perfect time to wake up for any other student, not too early and he still had time to get ready and have proper breakfast, time wasn't the matter in his case. He lied still, his body unable to afford a blink of his eyes as he blankly gazed upon the ceiling. Exhaustion had already found a way into him, as if the mere thought of having to wake up and pretend to be living a perfectly flawless life drained him. He didn't want to go about pretending to be living a perfectly flawless life, he didn't even feel the will in him to live a perfectly flawless life.
"There he goes." The boy said to the rest of them as he watched Draco slowly rise up from the ground and straight on his feet. He knew that this was what the boy wanted of him to do, to get him to his very edge, and he couldn't help but let him have it.
"Thirty points from gryfinndor, for attempting - and succeeding - to start trouble. But, ten points for Mr. Potter for his obliging reaction." Dumbledore announced, feeling a bit proud by Harry and a bit let down by Ben, it was known how he hated to be put in a situation where he has to take points from gryfinndor, but as a headmaster of one of the biggest wizarding schools, he had to be just.
He walked the hallway that morning, late on his way to his potions class, and he could feel countless pairs of eyes following behind him wherever he went, eyes that appeared to say all sorts of things about him. Every face his eyes fell on was looking back at him, with pity, with worry, with a happy sneer sometimes, all while every mouth seemed to utter words he couldn't figure out to various companions.
"Didn't know you could paint." He spoke, for a moment he could say he wasn't aware he spoke. His nervousness vanished in him at the pleasant sight of all the paintings. As he looked in Draco's direction, he saw how the boy flinched as he turned to face him, almost dropping the brush and the palette of colors that rested in his hands.
"You too." Harry replied, trying to get his voice to sound anything similar to Draco. He had a certain feeling, closer to be being bad. He knew things didn't get any better for Draco in the matter of these few minutes, despite that he hoped they did, and he feared things would go back to how they used to be a few hours ago, feared that he will be shut out once more.
"It'll do you so much better if you mind you own business." Something beyond ease flooded Draco as he spoke, but he tried to keep it on the low. Did he actually
"Paintings...?" Harry was almost too sure Draco knew exactly what he was talking about, it would take a moron to not figure that much out. It was as evident as the light of day that he was trying to mask it by acting completely oblivious because the answer he had wouldn't be truly gratifying to both, despite them already knowing it.
Draco could only wonder what had everyone so interested in that certain spot near The Three Broomsticks, but as he fought his way through the crowd, his eyes widened and his jaw fell open at the sight. Potter was leaning against a stone wall, his hands buried in his trousers. The sound of his moans echoed in Draco’s ear and for a moment, Draco forgot how to function. He couldn’t think of a single thing to do, obviously he didn’t expect to have to deal with Potter masturbating where everyone can see. So he stood there for an extra minute or two, watching Harry rubbing harder under his pants with something far from the amusement that appeared in everyone’s eyes.
He slowly pushed himself closer to the blonde, and carefully enveloped him with an arm of his, bringing him back to his chest, taking too much of caution in his movements, as he didn't want to scare him away, for he didn't know how he might react. The boy hardly showed anything close to a reaction, except for letting himself carelessly fall into Harry's embrace.
And with that, Harry rushed out of the hall, being the last of the remaining gryfinndor group to do so. Draco had spare ten minutes, long ten minutes of doing absolutely nothing, which he planned to use in taking a slow, thoughtful stroll to the field.
He never needed someone to be there and talk to him as much as he did in that very moment, he wanted to hear a voice of a human saying any scribble of words to him, he wanted to feel life surrounding him. However, he was beyond grateful that he wasn't followed into the bathroom, specifically by Harry. But now, as he stood like a lonely tree in an abandoned land, he so badly wished to feel the presence of someone, someone who had the capacity to provide a sensation of comfort, perhaps he needed that a lot more than the raging cuts now.
Draco captured Harry’s cheeks with a tightening clench of his fingers and pulled him up by the face, Harry’s body felt massless. His lips crashed on Harry’s again, with so much force this time that Harry was so sure his jaw would soon turn to dust under Draco’s firm grip and from the way their jaws collided. No chance was given to Harry to kiss back; he was thrown back to the bed rather harshly, lying there helplessly while Draco crawled on top of him, his hands pressed by Harry’s sides.
Out of tiredness, he opened his eyes, questioning his purpose of fighting. He was exhausted, if exhausted was the word suitable enough to fulfill it. He looked up, his eyes meeting their reflection in the mirror before him, shallow they looked, as if behind them lied an empty space of darkness. He no longer felt like a volcano on its edge, rather he felt like one that had already erupted, he felt void in the most excruciating of ways, almost as if he could feel it within him, he could feel himself being like a cold dark tunnel without an end on the inside, and he so desperately wanted fill it.
Before he could feel it, Draco was grabbing on the boy's collar ever so tightly, pulling him closer. His fingers clutched around the clothing, in a continually tightening manner that his knuckles became white like unripe strawberries as their faces became close, too close he could feel the boy's heavy hot breaths blending with his.
"Oh, er, just a random thought you can say. These little flickers come into your mind, especially at night and you want to hold on to them as tight as you can before the light of day wipes them away and they're nowhere to be found."
"Hermione, have you noticed a change on Draco?" He was looking at her with hopeful eyes, like a child. He was hoping that worrying about Draco's bizarre behavior was an issue that worried everyone, so that he didn't feel weirded out the way he did.
. And another blonde girl holding the hand of one of the boys with a large smile she looked like she was trying to hide. He could ask what they wanted from him, but then one of the boys spoke before he could open his mouth.
He decided against reading the letter, keeping it for another time when he was all by himself. Despite hating to see it, it was the last trace of his mother, the only trace that wasn't a mere memory.
____________
"Nothing really, you were half dead." Goyle answer the question with undeniable confusion, he couldn't tell why it mattered so much, and why he was as rushed as he was to get the answer. Draco, on the other hand, was a bit too relieved, probably more relieved than he was meant to be. But he couldn't help it, it felt too good to feel such ease, having nothing to be scared of. "But last night oh lord, last night, you wouldn't shut up, kept murmuring something like father please a bit too loudly, wouldn't let us get some peace and quiet almost all night long."
"No you didn't." He couldn't put his finger on why it hurt him so much, the pain that poisoned Draco's words. He couldn't quite grasp how the gloom in his own voice was born from the mere sound of Draco's. But he knew, it was there, and by now he grew to be aware that it will always be there, whether he understood or not, the state of anguish in him that he seemed to share with Draco would still linger. He couldn't say he felt the way his feet took him, in extremely light and gentle steps towards the other boy, who stood rooted in his spot. On the contrary of all the times before, the closer he got, the more into that zone of safety he felt, he didn't feel his agitation wrecking his body until his knees would fight to keep him standing.
He wrapped his arms around her back and pulled her in so tightly it could've torn a muscle of his arm. There was no space in between the two of their chest, their bodied were glued together, yet still he couldn't feel her. He tried harder, attempting to draw her even closer just to feel the warmth of her grasp just one more time, yet it felt like her was holding mere air.
After Draco left him to deal with the demons of his mind alone in the hallway the other day, and after it all happened just before his eyes, it felt to Harry as though he was standing in a different corner, looking at Draco. He never saw him as the same Draco five minutes before his father walked into Dumbledore's office again. For the past four years, painted in Harry's mind was the picture of a stone-cold Draco, a soulless figure of a guy so full of himself. The fierce look in his eyes felt like a natural, a thin wall that hid nothing behind. But then he heard him, he heard the pain rushing out through his voice. He saw him breaking, and the image of an iron bar Draco faded from his mind. He was hollow, as if every spirit was forced out of him, leaving him as nothing but a shell of a body. His eyes, at the hallway, glistening, fragile like thin glass, and it took someone who truly cared to see through the cracks of them, and it wasn't empty nothingness that lied behind them. He did realize it was merely a mask of egotism he shielded himself with, one he was forced to put on from the moment he was conscious enough to feel the world around him.
who he used to be. He enjoyed that calmness, that peace he and Draco had somehow managed to achieve for now at least, and he was beyond willing to make the best of it, and though he'd hate to admit it, he actually found a certain kind of ease when Draco was around, without a fight, when
"It's late, you need to be in bed." Draco took a short journey to where his shirt lied unnoticed, pouring his whole attention on picking up the shirt from the ground in a snail's pace in order to avoid further contact with Harry.
”O- of course, baby.” He couldn’t tell when his voice got so raspy, as if it was his first time speaking in years. A crowd of butterflies came to life in Harry’s stomach at the nickname, drawing a little smile on his lips.
Draco’s eyes traveled up towards the ceiling, a massive sigh found an escape out of him. Why did it hurt so much to think that Harry was only saying those things because he was high, with no ability to think rationally, and all those words would be washed away by the light of day? But then again, maybe Harry was saying the things that were buried too deep into his mind that his conscious self was too scared to say. Was he still under the effect of the sexual pleasure to ridiculously want this to be true? It can’t be.
it felt. So, quickly regaining the roughness of his gaze, he pushed Harry away, abandoning him behind as he walked away after glaring at him one last time. He felt dizzy in a way.
In a bit of a distance, he spotted the pale figure of Draco, giving him his back with a half blank canvas before him, judging by the way he seemed to focus on it, Harry could tell he was reaching a dead end with his painting. He was shirtless, that caught Harry's attention a bit more that he'd like, and his pair of trousers hung an inch below his waist.
He whimpered as the cold liquid stung his freshly open cuts, in another case he would find joy in such pain but this was far too different. He thought he'd get used to it after a few wipes but oh how wrong he was, it still bit him regardless of how he prepared himself for it. Then in a split second, it started dying out, as if the fire on his arm was being put out, only then did he allow himself to open his eyes. The first thing his wandering eyes fell on was his arm, by then hardly anything overlaid the paleness of his skin except for the thin lines scattered around, even those were too well cleaned that they were hardly visible.
Harry’s head got heavy on Draco’s shoulder, and as the blond glanced at him, he looked to be fast asleep already. He’d passed out.
"Charms." Draco shrugged rather carelessly. Charms was never a favorite of his, and he couldn't truly wrap his mind around how anyone enjoyed it at all. The thought of the class ahead gave boredom a way into him, and just by thinking that he would have to just sit with random students flicking their wands around probably incorrectly made him feel closer to being alamort.
He thought.
"How could you go about telling everyone in this rat hole about your mother!" Draco's eyes widened a little too hard as he heard his father's blade-like voice, there was a burn in his stomach. He felt a bit disgruntled that his father thought he did this while he'd much rather die than utter a word about it, yet still he felt some relief creeping through him, this might be his way out of his father's merciless grip.
"Get up." With these two final calm-sounding words, he marched away, letting the sound of his clicking cane echo through the empty hallway.
It was one frigid night, despite it being hardly mid September, the darkness and the frightening emptiness of the hallways seemed to lower the temperature even more, he wished he wore some more clothes. As he spread the map before him, he saw that by that moment the footsteps were pacing around the astronomy tower. He waited for a second, just in case the footsteps would walk away, but once he was certain they had settled, he knew where he was heading.
them, he wanted to
Harry couldn't believe what he had just witnessed, and deep down he wished he walked away.
Draco's head turned up in a quick manner, a jolt that made his neck hurt. Looking at Harry as he stood still facing him, his brows raised in a softened stare, he remembered just how terrified he was of him only a few days ago, just how it put him in a state of distress to think about him having the slightest idea, only the thought of the memory itself filled him with dread, he was on the verge of freaking out. But as he looked at him for one moment more, the dread in him was replaced by the heavy feeling of his heart sinking so hard he almost couldn't feel anything except that drowning dismay. He could recognize that feeling, that growing fear and bitterness, the fear of what would happen next, he felt it before at the sight of his mother walking out of the bedroom with here suitcases behind her. There was no point of panicking whenever he's around now, he knew all right.
"I don't really care to explain, professor." He answered rather bluntly, shattering Harry's high built hopes of getting an answer. McGonagall's eyes widened, filled with what seemed like anger towards the statement she found disrespectful, yet she kept herself together, without saying a word.
He was too tired to get up, the thought of having to try to find his way in the darkened hallways itself exhausted him, yet still he knew, once his head is rested on the pillow, his stiff eyes would stay open, and sleep would fly from his eyes like dust.
With every word of the letter, Draco let his weakness overwhelm him. He didn't really want to put any more effort on fighting his tears away, so he let them wet his cheeks as freely as they wished. He was scared, the words in the letter planted so much pain in him, he was hurt, and there was no point of playing tough.
He did catch sight of Draco rushing to the exit of the Great Hall the night before, flames coming out of his face as he tried to trap as much as he could within himself. He saw the way his facial features tightened as he read a mysterious piece of a letter, knowing that whatever that paper hid had planted a severe sort of pain within him. Harry could hardly hold himself in place without running after Draco, everyone sitting around him must had sensed him burning as he watched the blond leave. He knew Draco ran off for a reason, he wasn't that much of a git to deny the boy the space he needed to process just because he wanted to know. And following the footprints that had just faded a minute ago, he figured Draco had had enough space with himself, and it was safe to check up on him.
He let a desperate sigh escape from his lips as he was tired to doing all the talking. Looking at both of them, he could easily tell that they didn't know what they're meant to do about it, and they just didn't care enough to do anything at all.
To his not-really surprise, he saw Draco standing right behind Dumbledore's back, and next to him stood the boy from the fight yesterday. A red spot settled just underneath his eye, a little plaster that matched the skin tone of his red-looking face seemed to hold his nose together in place, and the little cut just above his lip was left exposed. Quite frankly, it was a bit of a shocker to see the boy up and well, his bets were on him occupying a hospital bed for a day or two at least. The three of them, clear as day, could hardly breathe at the presence of others.
"Well enough, I can say." Draco replied with a little nod. He could hardly remember anything about his blank sleep the night before, other than the fact that it was blank, which was an improvement to an extent. "What about you?"
Draco gave a last glare before he let go of Harry’s jaw and went back down, his head between Harry’s legs. Everything looked too good to be true, just like in one of his wild daydreams during potions class when he drifts away watching Harry chop his asphodel, the thought of having Harry screaming under his mercy driving him out of his head that he so badly wants to punch a wall. But there he was now, in Harry’s bed with Harry under him, hands tied above his head and his face looking tense in the best way possible. He had sure slept with multiple people, but the feelings Harry made him feel when he moaned was nothing to be compared with any other, it sparked something in him no one else or nothing else could.
He didn't know what he envisioned to get in response, but most certainly it wasn't anything near the heartfelt chuckle that found its way out of Harry's lips when Draco's voice came to be heard. Struck by the unplanned shift in the atmosphere, Draco could only afford looking at him with his eyebrows curved so high up. As soothing and felicitous as the sight was, Draco still felt slightly uncomfortable in a certain way,
"My boy," he heard her whisper directly in his ear, her voice felt agonizing yet sweet, relieving as it washed away every bad thing off his memory. "My life's delight."
He still hadn't written back to his father, and he knew his father was turning into a bundle of fire sparks awaiting for a reply as he sat there thinking. He most definitely could give the whole world if it meant that he'd be anywhere far from that awful excuse for a father, but his mother was nowhere for him to choose. She all of a sudden stopped writing to him, he waited for her owl every early morning at the window, but every time he walked away with his hands empty. Last time he wrote to her, knowing by heart that he'd be getting something comforting back, was when his father left him in the hallway with bruises all over his torso, and after that, he never saw his mother's owl. He knew nothing about her whereabouts, he knew next to nothing about her new life in fact, so choosing her was like choosing to be adrift in the wind, to be wayward and lost, choosing her was like choosing nothing. His father had quite the habit of giving hell to those who go for anything other than what he wished.
"Professor, he didn't use magic against him. He threatened to do so, yes, but did not." Harry spoke at last, after giving it some thought whether he actually wanted to be a part of the conversation or not. But it was an urgent desire to tell the truth, even if it defended Draco, that was just a bonus, because he knew it by heart that Draco didn't care enough to defend himself.
"Promise me that you'll at least try not to cut again, please."
he meant himself, it wasn't that explicit to anyone who didn't keep a studying eye on Draco. With that thought in mind he felt himself shrink at the fact that he might had been a bit interested in a few of Draco's details, but he reasoned it was merely because they had been sworn enemies for as long as they'd known each other, and one has to keep a careful eye on their enemies.
Draco was trying to rewind his schedule in his mind, in attempts to remember what class he had coming. He thought since he was already up early enough, and had the closest possible thing to breakfast, might as well use the day for the best. He wasn't sure of how capable he was of actually living through the day, but he decided to give it a try anyway.
He leaned forward against the sink, letting the paper drop onto the floor as if it was too heavy for him to hold for much longer. For a moment, he just kept his eyes shut as tightly as they could that it hurt, refusing the urge to open them again as he felt himself a step away from pouring out, all of him, everything he felt was a blinking second away from flooding out of him. He felt like a volcano, his irascibility well mixed with the agony that was aroused by the memory of every moment throughout the last few weeks felt like active lava inside of him, painfully searing to the point that he felt the need to let it erupt. He didn't want to, he didn't want to sit in a dark corner and cry his eyes dry, for the longest time he thought that grousing his pain out to the walls until his lungs ache would help, but upon doing it over and over for days, it lost its charm, and became nothing but physically draining himself without a result he could feel. He wished to close his eyes for long enough for it to all go away, somehow melt away within him, or find away for it to flow out noiselessly.
He lost count, not that he cared to keep track of how many times he felt the edges of the piece tear through him anyways. For all he knew he felt closer to ludic every time he engraved another cut, felt the adrenaline piling within him one bit more every time. When he figured that it was enough, that he got to fulfill his minimum need, he decided to help himself for one last cut before calling it, not wanting to have any sort of undesired accidents. He gently pressed the edge against his skin and drew a line, he couldn't help whimpering in pain, this one had more pain that pleasure to him and he couldn't quite figure out why, but watching the blood rush out of him like a cataclysm in the sea, he came to realize that this one went deeper than his liking, which gave him one more reason to stop.
"Alright, just the bandaging now." Harry piled the blood stained tissues by the kit box, and after some light searching in the kit, he pulled out a roll of yellowish cloth.
Harry, on the other hand, was rather puzzled at the blonde's actions to say the least. Though it worried him in a way, Harry felt a hint of relief dash through him for a brief moment. For once he wasn't shut out, he wasn't insulted, and deep down gratitude found a way in him for not staying in bed watching the map with a plain face. It was unlike Draco to act on his impulses, like he just did, or to let his vulnerability show in plain sight. It was alarming, clear as day that something was wrong, too wrong that Draco's long-worn vanity broke to it.
There he stood, Draco, facing the open space where the cold air rushed in, biting his cheeks. Every time he thought his tears froze on his cheeks, he could feel yet another lukewarm trace of a tear gently warm up the area where it slid. He didn't expect much, there nothing to come from staring at the big empty night sky, yet he hoped. He hoped to feel like there would be someone, company of a sort, something he can hold on to.
He felt the need to walk away as he watched them march closer in his direction, he wanted to be hidden from Harry's sight while he still could, and he couldn't exactly put his finger on why it was too urgent that he goes before he's seen. He had no problem seeing Harry, or even having a settled conversation with him, which left him lost in why it urged him so badly to just walk in the opposite direction.
"You see, Draco, your mother was foolish enough to fall in love with some filthy mudblood. Not only dared betray me, but also, go to something so nasty for herself. And as such, from this moment forth, you're ought to feel no love for her anymore, as she didn't have any for you." His father spoke as though he could read through his mind while walking away slowly, never did he hear his father sounding so cold like a stone.
The words, finely written, burnt through his eyes, effortlessly occupying a spot where every letter sat heavy in his mind as he read that letter again, foolish enough to have the hope of a child that he might have missed something, that it was only the fear of the letter arriving that tricked his eyes into seeing the words as the words he feared, and that in actuality some sweetness hid between those few words. There was no ground to build his hopes on, the written words lingered just like how they used to be when his eyes felt on them for the first time, the melancholy dark ink stained the yellow paper just as bitterly.
"I was there, in the hallway after Dumbledore. I saw what he did to you, your father." He figured the words would be a lot easier to speak if he let them out in waves, with slow pauses of silence to make up his mind for the words that followed. He was right, it did help quite a lot. His voice even sounded almost as serene as he desired. "I know where these bruises came from."
"If she did she wouldn't have left you!" He kicked him with every word that came out of his mouth, and he was only kicking harder with every word. "If she did she would've put a fight for you!"
A tiny pair of footsteps appeared moving, to Harry's delight. He traced the rough material of the parchment where the footsteps stopped for a part of the second, eager to know where they would settle tonight. It felt like a reluctant stroll, the way Harry saw it, as he would stop, in various places for a few moments before he was back moving, as though he was seeking a place where it felt like shelter.
"What is he doing here?" He jumped, pointing at Harry as he got closer. He hated how obvious it was through his voice that his mind wasn't quite prepared to deal with Harry's presence around him. He tried to sit up straight, but the exhaustion in his muscles didn't allow it.
"Well, Mr. Malfoy, we'll let you get a bit of rest." McGonagall told him, mentioning both herself and Snape out. She wished for everyone to leave in fact, yet still Goyle lingered.
"I got you this." After a floating moment of silence, Harry reached to his loosely hanging bag, digging through the mess he managed to shove there for his desired item. Then, within a minute, he pulled his hand out again, with a shiny green apple resting in it. "You really like those, I figured."
Harry delicately brought Draco's head to his shoulder, in endeavors to hold him closer just like before. It took him a moment of disbelief, was it really the two of them, there alone in the dark, Draco Malfoy lying like a dead leaf in his arms, without neither of them minding it? It felt like a far fantasy no one saw coming.
Expeditiously, he dug his hand under the mattress, in a hurry to find it, as he was rushed by the fear of being overwhelmed by that self-reproach. He felt the sharp tip near his fingertips, and with no hesitation he pulled it out. His head fell silent, there the good side of it took over as he observed the piece of broken glass in his hand. It was as if the sight of that slightly stained object in his hand created a shield around him, from his own thought, providing a feeling of safety he knew for a fact was false, he knew it was the danger he taught his mind to see as safety.
Harry couldn’t take his eyes off Draco, who towered on him looking down, while Harry slid his trousers down his legs, creating a puddle of clothes by his feet, followed by the rest of his clothes. He meant to do as draco did, keeping his pants on for he suddenly was overwhelmed by a sense of insecurity, but Draco’s sharp gaze silently ordered for him to go on. And so he did, pushed his pants down and sat naked like a new born baby before Draco’s eyes, shivers crawling down his spine as the cold air hit him.
Harry left his desk, walking up to the door. Everyone but him could sense the way his body was trembling. He felt he had an idea about what Dumbledore would want of him, and he wished so hard he was wrong. The thought of having to think and talk about it again turned his stomach into knots. The journey towards the door seemed to go on and on for ages, as though his feet were glued to the floor beneath them, and it took the effort of a million years to get them to move. And all through the ages it took him to get to the door, he wished to be dead before he gets to the door.
He looked back up at Draco, attempting to meet his gaze, but his eyes weren't still for him to meet, yet still he could see the muted eyes showing what looked like disgruntle. He was biting on the inside of his cheek, and his breath was too hard to capture as he was so fully aware of his breathing. But regardless of all, his arm remained rest in Harry's hand, he didn't bother jerking it away or really attempting any kind of movement away from Harry, which was quite the surprise.
"Yeah, I just slept in, you can say." He breathed out and forced it to sound like a chuckle, he cringed at himself so hard for it, and deep inside he wished he could just shut up. He lied, he couldn't see the need to tell Harry anything close to the truth really. The lie burnt through him as it brought back the fresh memory of this morning, it had to be the earliest he woke up in days. He most of all wanted to believe that lie, for it to become the truth in his mind, replacing what actually happened and wiping his mind clean of it.
They let the silence heavily douse the place around them, taking them in as they stared forward with blank eyes. There was nothing, they felt nothing. It was the peace both of them starved for, it didn't feel exactly like peace, but it was a moment in which there was merely silence, smooth and light, and they couldn't ask for more. The cold was slightly creeping in again.
Harry twirled a little strand of Draco’s hair with his finger, and he opened his eyes. Draco’s stomach gave a jolt once his eyes met the emerald green pair, the mellow gaze in his eyes started a raging fire in Draco’s chest, a fire that only knew to grow, eating up the last bit of his resistance until he was left with nothing but the unholy thoughts of what those perfectly shaped lips could do.
People started chattering their way out of the room, and gradually it got loud, after a good hour and a half of almost complete quietness. By that point he was the only one still seated, where was he to head to if he were to get up and leave? What was there for him to do but to stay stuck in his seat and occupy his mind with anything and everything? So he sat there motionlessly, not quite comfortably, but as days went by, less and less eyes cherished the sight of him, the water of what happened to him was getting cold, which in more ways than one was truly delightful. He let the thought of what to do next sink in his mind, as the times to come had a lot more essential matters for him to busy his mind with.
He presumed that it was for the best he leaves, tries to find his way out of the bathroom and back into his bed before he crashes there where everyone could see. And so, with that thought in mind, he charmed the floor clean of the few drops of blood, and put the fragments of the mirror back together. He didn't know where his feet landed, there was no floor wherever he stepped, which led him to constantly trying to avoid nonexistent holes in the ground.
hurt. But there was some truth to Harry's statement, he did acknowledge his insufferable attitude, and guilt ate him up every waking moment of every day for it.
"Well in that case, we do not tolerate violence in this school, Mr. Malfoy, with or without magic." Dumbledore informed, choosing to believe Harry, yet it wasn't quite the satisfactory. "Twenty five points from slytherin for your reckless behavior, Mr. Malfoy."
Then none of them said a single word, as if all of them were silenced by some sort of an invisible force. They all stared blankly at Harry's passing figure, as if he specifically was not meant to hear a word of what they said. Draco couldn't help but fix his gaze on him, as everyone did, and he didn't know what to feel. He wanted him away, to vanish because the very sight of him, his messy appearance and bright eyes, was filling with with unnecessary annoyance, he couldn't put his finger on why exactly it was bothering him so much. Yet on the other hand, he was almost too scared Harry could tell what was going on in his life, and that he'll use it against him, but for the first time in almost two weeks, he felt noticed, he felt his being and it felt good. A lot of feelings were aroused within him, yet still he kept his eyes looking through Harry's as if there was nothing else to look at. And he watched as that red headed Weasley grabbed him away, not knowing where to feel grateful or upset.
It was a figure, a pair of arms wrapped around darkness, the head resting on the shoulder of a silhouette. Most of it had yet to be covered with paint, only an outline drawn with a pencil. And just like the one Harry had noticed, this one was all in dark tones, holding the same sense of sadness. But just like the one before, Harry found a rather strange pleasure in that melancholy.
Even with his eyes open, Draco was still haunted by that petulant way his father looked him in the eye. He could ever so lucidly see his clutched teeth and tightened frown. The sound of that his bitter yells still echoed through his mind, and still scared him as though his was consciously living it in that moment.
"I hate you father!" If he felt any despise regarding that situation, it would definitely be for his father. He couldn't stand the sight of him, as he took away the only person that loved, so easily, for what felt like the most stupid of reasons. And with that statement, he walked away with huge steps, heading up to his room. And after him he could hear his father yelling at him to behave himself, but he didn't care.
With the map resting wide open in his hands, Harry most definitely felt foolish and extremely dumb, standing there before a massive wall waiting for it to open at his desires. But he knew what lied behind that stiff wall. He shut his eyes, and he pictured the pale blond boy in the darkness in his eyes, hoping to find him behind that wall.
"How did you-" Looking at the round fruit which now rested in his hand, it gave Draco quite the amusingly light feeling to think that Harry had observed him closely enough to know that tiny bit about him. He for some reason felt as though he had just won something, something he'd been aiming to win for ages, and it overflowed him with pride that he couldn't hide that conquering smile that crept over his face slowly. That feeling was his favorite.
His eyes ran over the hall, scanning the gryfinndor table specifically in multiple rounds, but all he could find was an empty spot. Harry was late, or too early. The thought of asking Ron and Hermione clicked in his mind, but he brushed it off his mind just as soon as it came, imagining their disturbed reaction.
As breakfast was over, the Great Hall was gradually getting quiet. Only a few gryfinndors were left including Harry, and they formed a little group around the table to talk about what seemed like an important matter. Hermione had left, leaving only Ron and Ginny with Harry.
Draco pulled out his wand, pointing it right into the boy's neck. His hand was shaking rather noticeably as he gripped on the wand with so much more force than intended. Unable to control his unstable hand, he felt the tip of his wand digging deeper into the boy's neck, and he didn't really mind it.
He could ever so easily tell that Draco wasn't feeling his best self, he could see it like the light of day throughout those four days. He couldn't help but notice, whenever Draco was around, how unusually recluse he was, how
"Mischief managed." He whispered with a small voice under his breath, and slowly the lines of ink faded into the yellow parchment as if they never existed.
"No." Ron and Hermione said in union, shaking their heads slightly and eventually deciding to find something else to do,
About ten minutes afterwards, Harry could sense Draco walking away. He carefully watched him, from the corner where he hid, limping away with one arm around his stomach, while the other constantly traveled up to his face, wiping away his flowing tears with the edge of his sleeve. No matter how many times he wiped his cheeks dry, they still felt wet nonetheless, even though he was hardly crying by that time.
But what surprised him most of all was hearing his first name drift off Harry's lips for the first time. He didn't know how to feel about it.
Pleasing it was, to walk the empty hallways after breakfast. Draco enjoyed that lightness in the air when there was hardly any voice to be heard, the air he breathed was light as it wasn't loaded with crowded words and voices in different tones, it didn't take effort to welcome every breath in. It somehow made the weather feel better, gave it quite the relaxing breeze, and the beauty of it was better left unknown. He would occasionally pass by a couple of other students, but those countable few didn't seem to care for his figure roaming around them, and for once it was beyond relieving to find others with any other form of interest than himself.
”Draco,” Harry seized Draco’s lips, but the blonde’s lips remained unmoving against his. “I want you to fuck me right here on this bed. I can’t stop thinking of how good it must feel if
As he lied in bed, like a statue built to stay still in place, he tried to find any hint of hidden beauty to waking up as heavy as a box of lead almost every morning. This very morning however, he woke up feeling exceptionally heavy, enough to pin his body down to his bed, as if the gravity of the whole world intensified in that very spot, pulling his body deeper towards the pit. His chest could hardly move up and down, and he felt trapped beneath something he couldn't push off with all the effort he gathered, leaving him there like a lifeless corpse, unable to move a single muscle and unable to find the desire to move at all. Hearing the distant and muffled chatter of various people, the thought of staying in that bed with his skin tightening felt a lot more inviting than seeing faces and hearing voices talk to him or about him. The mere thought of the day ahead and having to live it exhausted him. He hated his options.
“Potter-Malfoy has a better ring to it.”
," he said.
"Clear-" he paused as he realised exactly what Draco had just said. "Did you say mate?"
It wouldn’t end well for either of them if Harry chose today of all days to pick a fight.
Harry took the time to change into his clothes and gather his quidditch gear underneath his arm. He was ready to leave when Madam Pomfrey returned with two vials of liquid. One was a pain tonic which he was to take in case his shoulder hurt. The other was a salve to decrease the swelling and alleviate the bruising. Harry thanked her and she shooed him away with a smile.
“As for your decision to stay in Malfoy Manor, you can only imagine my alarm. I’ve only recently become aware of your –”
I’m trying… I just need to regroup.
“Harry,” he said and there was something in his voice, he’d heard it before in Draco's voice.
Harry shook his head.
Harry stood and watched.
He took it in like he was seeing it for the first time. Majority of the room was occupied by a large tub that closely resembled a swimming pool with various taps along its edges. There were various racks for towels and clothing as well as several benches one of which Malfoy currently sat on. He was dressed in his school robes and beneath them Harry could see a perfectly knotted emerald and silver tie.
“Grandfather,” Draco said bowing once.
“If I let you get me off we’ll be here until lunchtime.”
Harry frowned. “What the–?”
He wiped down the rest of Harry’s body before tossing the cloth aside. Then he climbed in beside him. Harry watched, straddling the line between consciousness and consciousness.
“Yeah, will we?” Ron asked picking out a bean from a box of Barty Bott’s Every Flavour Beans. He examined it for a moment before popping it into his mouth.
Draco sighed and flung himself onto the bed. His limbs brushed against the edge of the book Harry had been trying to read on bonding and mating rituals. It was as dreary and forgettable as the last one. He had a good mind to make his peace with Draco’s jibes and spare himself the pain of reading this. Merlin knows it would be worth it.
The memory of the lazy summer days spent laying by the pool at Malfoy Manor returned to Draco. He could see Pansy swimming laps around the Olympic-sized pool claiming that she had to keep in shape. Blaise atop a fold-up chair dressed in swimming trunks reading some book or the other he'd nicked from the Malfoy Library. And Draco himself content with swirling his feet in the water, never knowing, never appreciating how much he had in that moment.
Because they’d always been too good at fighting.
Draco nodded and turned his gaze to the road. The bus crawled towards them at a steady pace. Five passengers stepped out when it finally came to a stop.
Harry hadn’t been able to resist having him try street food, mostly because it had been a secret fantasy of his for the longest time. At first, he’d had no money but even when he found out he had quite a bit of it, he hadn’t been allowed out often.
Too many for a casual touch let alone their increasing habit of hand-holding. The magical crew had been instructed to keep of Harry’s presence to themselves or suffer the consequences. Intimacy, on the other hand, would be far too valuable a piece of information.
It killed a part of him to say them because they were words he’d repeated to himself as well and he knew how hard they were to follow. Sometimes impractical.
“A few minutes to midnight.”
"Malfoy, is that you again?" a high-pitched voice asked from the last stall.
“You won’t bring it up anymore?”
How on earth was Draco expected to convince him?
"Still what, Harry?" asked Hermione in the background but he was already standing up and mumbling excuses to her before he too exited the Great Hall.
It wasn’t so much a threat as an assessment but Harry fell silent anyway.
“If they want me to come back--”
“If your family gets wind of this...”
Blaise’s Fantasy Fix: an alcoholic drink with a unique enough formula to demand some form of patent. More on this later. The drink, that is - not its patentability.
“The house was empty?”
For years everyone around him had planned out of his life. His birth, life’s purpose and death had all been foretold in a single prophecy. He’d sat and listened as people said where to go, how to act. Whom to speak to and how to speak to them. He’d had little choice in most of it and he wouldn’t let Ron take this away, unknowingly or otherwise.
"Oh no," Ginny said. "It's part of the look. It's cute and the pants are sexy, they complement each other."
{HPDM}
When he’d dried himself off and changed into a pair of sweats and a jumper, Harry made his way back to the room. Draco sat at the writing desk with a quill in hand and parchment before him. Harry’s efforts at stealth and his attempt to get a look over Draco’s shoulder earned him an impatient shooing.
Malfoy's gaze slid to his own plate. He sliced a piece of his cake with the slow practised ease with which he seemed to do everything. And as if he knew Harry would still be looking, he looked up.
Blaise splashed a puddle of water onto his face and Draco had the luxury of being surprised for the first time that evening.
Malfoy looked up.
But Draco turned away from the vision.
Draco inclined his head in thanks and climbed the steps to the boys' dormitory fiddling with his collar the entire way. He threw open the door to find Blaise reclining on his bed with a piece of parchment and a pot of ink hovering on either side of him.
There was no teasing or amusement in his eyes and Harry knew he had to this. He ignored his wild heartbeat and the tension in his stomach. He needed to do this before things got too… muddled.
Few Hogwarts students milled around them, some with their parents, others on their own. None of them so much as looked their way and Harry took the opportunity to steer Draco and himself away from the main area. Easter left the station less busy than Christmas but he didn’t doubt there would be a few people who’d recognise them.
He’d just made up his mind to go when he realised he couldn’t leave the common room when Parvati and Lavender were seated in perfect view of the portrait hole.
Ron scoffed at that.
Blossom pouted as Pomfrey fed him his potions causing some of the dark liquid to dribble down his chin. Draco snorted. What a child.
“Why does that… feel so... oh shit.”
Harry's brow furrowed. He scratched his head. "Never knew there was a wrong way to do it."
. He had never thought... He hadn't expected...
He opened his mouth to say something but he had no words so he tried to work up the courage to yank his arm from Draco's grasp but all that resulted in was a soft sigh when the Slytherin's nails grazed his skin.
A shout came from behind them and Harry stepped back.
He said there would be no stopping the violence when it came.
He wanted the showers and the snogging and the delicate touches and hidden smiles. He wanted the uproarious laughter and whispered promises.
Harry held his breath, chest tightening in preparation for the blow.
“You should do whatever the hell you want because it’s what you do anyway. Did you come here to bicker with my guest or plan a fucking party?”
He heard shuffling in the room and assumed that the rest were already up and preparing for the Hogsmeade trip. Squeals of excitement that made his head throb wafted from downstairs, no doubt a product of the third years' belief of everything they'd heard from older students. He hoped they would leave soon so that he would have the entire dormitory to himself, catch a few hours of sleep then laze around wondering whether he should get something to eat from the kitchens or continue to lay in bed the whole day.
Harry wasn't exactly all for it either.
Harry frowned, cursing the sudden stillness of his heart.
They liked seeing someone that they could relate to.
Harry wished for Ron to hurry then. His demeanour portrayed no intention to hurry up now that people surrounded them. He stopped to smile at the students and wave at them. Harry bit his lip and tried to ignore each hand that reached for him or the mouths that shouted his name.
“Take my hand.”
“I do have relatives like everyone else.”
Draco stood at the command. Somewhere along the line Stone had forgotten who he was, some line of formality had been crossed. He would set it right. "
Draco scrambled for his wand, cast a
There was nowhere else to sleep in the room, no sofa or chaise, only the window seat. He knew what it would mean for his back if took that road.
“If that’s your list of questions," he said motioning to the parchment. “I suggest you get to it, it does look rather long.”
Draco waved a hand.
“Harry?”
And he expected the rest of Hogwarts to operate under that presumption.
What if all this had been some elaborate prank? What would he do, stuck in some part of London he didn’t know well enough to navigate on his own?
He dreaded that he may not remember what he felt. How he felt it. How feeling it made him feel.
"What did he take?"
Malfoy glared.
Harry frowned, gaze flitting to the pale fingers inching their way his direction.
"Ron," said Hermione swatting his arm.
He shouldn't have cared so much what Potter thought but he felt something in his chest flutter at the quivering "I-" sound Potter made.
“Oh shut up and go back to your mewling.”
Of course, he wasn’t. What had Draco done?
“Yes.”
“That doesn’t let you off the hook with your promise about the bond,” Harry said.
“You’re not going to vouch for any unfair treatment, are you?”
“Think about it,” she said edging closer to the opening of the alcove. “Wherever he is, it will be easier for you to get him out.”
“Ever the pragmatist, aren’t you?”
Harry turned to Haneul who was watching them with a measure of morbid fascination.
He could feel the heat pooling in his abdomen, the pressure... He was so close, he had to –
badgering" which he thought wasn't fair but a fifth-year at their end of the table had come up with an interesting way to make his mashed potatoes change shape and that was enough to take the attention off him.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy," he heard Pansy yell as she stormed into the boy's dormitory.
“And if I want to bury it?”
“Kitchen.”
He could have fought off the stupid squid, he'd just needed time-
“If there are people inside, yes,” Haneul said.
“–that they abide by almost religiously. It’s not common to have secrets in our household and it will seem like everyone is prying –”
"No swearing in my... Merlin," Madam Pomfrey said when she had returned to the room.
Even so, it was the second part that bothered Draco more. Severus had ensured that his parents would want to meet Potter when he had tattled that he was his mate. Draco wasn’t shocked.
“I don’t give two shits about your family.”
He knew where Draco was steering this conversation and didn’t like it. His feelings for Draco had grown since last term, his fight with Ron was evidence of it. His refusal to speak to Hermione but not Draco was further proof.
“I know.”
Draco sat up and looked about to say something but his mother beat him to it.
Even in the low light of the room, Malfoy's livid expression was plain as day and the fire in his eyes was something that Harry thought Zabini shouldn't be fuelling so whimsically.
Draco chuckled and pulled back a few inches to look at him.
Roars erupted from the Gryffindors and the hours that followed were a blur in Harry’s mind.
“Do you think I would know the solution to a problem I don’t know how to do in the first place?”
She looked up at him. "Do it, Harry."
Harry contemplated turning around but there were no other empty tables and he wasn’t about to go back to the dance floor. He walked to the table with a decided air and set his glass down. He knew it would be a bad idea even as Zabini looked up at him from his mask. Polished ram’s horn engraved down to the last detail coiled into the air and the top half of his face was hidden save for his eyes.
He had never wished so hard to stop living.
Blaise swung for him but Draco dodged, catching his wrist in his hand and twisting it hard enough to cause him to cry out.
He was well aware that there were other people in the room. And he had to get to his first lesson in twenty minutes but his body did not fucking understand that he couldn’t have Malfoy. It didn't want food and it didn't want to rest. It
They were racing down the corridors as fast as they could with the patrols going on. It was taking too much time but this was the fastest route according to Haneul. Harry didn’t know how much more he could rely on him when he had so little to show for it but he had no other choice.
Harry smiled and withdrew it coating two fingers this time, his eyes still on Draco.
Malfoy’s eyes fluttered and he coughed water as he sat up. Harry shared a look with Ron and they turned to go. "Where do you think you're going?" demanded Zabini, wand still trained on their figures.
His fingers reached for the wet spot on his pants where the cocktail had spilt and he cursed.
“Seven floors and one basement?” Hermione demanded.
And then he fell.
“It’s an assessment for a reason, Potter. You’re not supposed to have any material on you.”
Draco shot him a look but the physician pretended not to notice.
books."
“Kreacher!”
Harry laughed this time. “You have my word, Draco Malfoy.”
The voice was female, soft and soothing. He opened his eyes to find Tonks peering down at him with wide eyes. Violet hair cascaded down her face shot through with streaks of black. She was dressed as though she’d been out all night though her eyes hid it well.
There were things like Draco’s pureblood status and the general dislike of the Malfoy family that would have to be factored in.
As his eyes drifted shut, memories of a conversation with Draco came to mind.
Draco turned to face him, face scrunched up, then his momentary confusion gave way to a grin.
Harry turned and saw him as he’d never seen him before.  Draco stood with his arms around himself and his gaze averted.
“How do you want me then?”
Yet even with all the events currently at play, Draco remained aware of the other matters he had to deal with. He’d allowed himself so much time with Harry that the thought of only seeing him at the start and end of the day seemed alien.
“Come on,” Draco said grasping his hand.
"What is it, Zabini?" Draco snapped drawing himself from his thoughts.
“You may leave.”
“You never did tell me why you liked the solarium,” Harry said remembering that he’d meant to ask about that.
“Really, Alphard, you couldn’t wait until I was done?” Draco demanded in the sort of way Harry knew only Malfoys dared do of their elders.
"I will have you know-" but whatever he had been about to let Hermione know they would never know for at that moment Slughorn silenced the entire class with a "that's enough. Now I'll have ten points from both Slytherin and Gryffindor for that."
"Good work guys," he said. "Friday next week."
Kreacher turned to Harry who had no services to request. He wouldn’t have Kreacher cooking for them but he couldn’t just send him away. He cast around for something to say until his eyes landed on the travelling cloak Lupin had in his arms.
"Shut up!" Draco screamed.
“No? I don’t know. I don’t know why I asked.”
"You know, Potter," he said throwing the sheets aside. "I don't know why the fuck I'm in the same bed as you but I'm leaving right now, before my body has a violent reaction towards you and your stupidity."
Harry nodded.
"Hey, could you maybe keep it down?" he heard someone say.
The footsteps quickened and something landed with a thud to his right. He only just managed to roll onto his right side before the air whistle by his ear. Another thud as something else hit the ground with a thud.
He made his way past the waiting room straight to the back where Severus’ office was located. This time he did not bother knocking, he pushed the door open and stepped into the room.
Hermione’s eyes widened. “With them inside?”
“With pleasure.”
Harry dodged another bludger and let out a curse as he soared higher to search for the snitch. They knew the drill, it was textbook gameplay. Keep all bludgers away from the cashers and the seeker. The crowd was on its feet now, louder than ever. An hour in and this was not turning into the swift victory anyone had anticipated.
He walked past a gaggle of fourth years that looked like they were getting ready to prank people coming out of the Great Hall and followed at a discreet distance – several paces – behind Malfoy so that even if Malfoy turned Harry would look like he was just coincidentally going in the same direction.
{HPDM}
Harry didn't know his name and he couldn't see the back of his flying leathers but he seemed a bit stiff, like cardboard.  He was also biting his lip and fidgeting with the edge of his cloak. Was he nervous? Harry could remember being this nervous before his first game five years ago.
The sentimentality of the gesture of it chipped away at his restraints most. He stood grinning like a fool long after he’d left and it was only when the week’s events returned to him that reality did as well. The events at Grimmauld Place still haunted his mind and every second they had to be apart… No, he was being sentimental.
His voice was dangerously low when he said, “You really want me to fuck you here and now, don’t you?”
Harry shot Hermione a look, she shook her head in disapproval but Ron's frazzled state was beginning to make him panicky too. "Here." He pulled a vial of golden liquid from his pocket. Ron's eyes widened.
“Being question by Dumbledore, McGonagall and Flitwick as we speak.”
Harry woke to the sound of breakfast downstairs. He scrambled out of bed before he realised he wasn’t in Hogwarts. He didn’t have to get up early to have breakfast.
Draco groaned and tried to get him to move again.
"I- I can't," he said.
“What happens if you’re with someone whose hand you can’t hold?” Harry asked.
"If you want to get technical about it..."
to perfection, I am willing to let your grades for this potion stand in place of the previous one. You have one and a half hours, you may begin."
“What time did you get here?”
He and Draco had sex after he won the Quidditch World Cup.
Draco’s body began to tremble and Harry half thought something was wrong but this time all that followed was a single loud crack. Draco cried out, spine arching and reforming. His legs – the wolf’s legs – bowed and he hunched forwards.
Draco smiled. “Your scent.”
His gaze moved to his wand gripped firmly in his left hand. It had been a while but he was sure he could fall into the rhythm of it without trying too hard. Transferring the wand to his right hand, Draco whispered,
He needed to heal, fast.
“…bludger…”
"Language," reprimanded Snape.
Madam Pomfrey had shoved a few more vials in his hands before he left and he was sure she had never been so happy to see a patient leave her care.
Draco sat bolt upright.
“Go back to sleep then.”
Had Malfoy used that word or was it Harry’s addition?
Ron chose to continue eating his breakfast in silence.
And so they travelled down the corridors of Hogwarts making sure to stick to alcoves and shortcuts rarely visited. Draco tried to fight the hold on him once but it was no use and he was relegated to watching as they led him deeper and deeper into the castle.
At least he would get to see Malfoy in the evening
His frustration had decreased to nothing by the end of the sentence and Draco reclined with a modest grin. The silence had Harry turning to him with narrowed eyes.
Harry set aside the clothes he had been folding and walked around the bed. Draco’s posture was rigid and his breaths were huff of anger. Harry reached for his hand and hoped he hadn’t miscalculated. Draco did not meet his gaze but he didn’t push him away either.
Interpreting the reaction as intended, Nott returned to his section of the table.
Something flashed above them.
And so the rest of the day continued.
He breathed easy. At least Lupin had been smart enough to heed his request in the last letter. It would have been difficult to explain why he was receiving letters from a known werewolf. Perhaps not to Blaise who already knew some of the truth of his condition. But anyone could have collected those letters.
“I’m serious.”
“So there haven’t been any…”
Draco watched them both with a raised eyebrow. “Are you quite done?”
“Tell them then.”
She sighed and perched on the arm of the chair. "Please," she whispered. "Even if it's after, the party ends at four so there'll be plenty of time."
Beside him, Hermione had stopped wringing her hands and was looking visibly more relaxed.
Draco set the mug down and a moment of silence passed between them. Draco still watched him with same eyes he had before but they no longer seemed so… glacial. Harry turned to go to the room, not to sleep but to have something to do.
Sometimes the feeling inside him felt endless. It felt like he had a void within him that kept sucking and sucking. Any trace of emotion was sucked in almost immediately until he eventually felt nothing and somehow that was what hurt the most.
“You’ll have to earn it, chéri.”
“Your preferences,” he said.
“I… it is?”
Ron had complained, so had Harry. After all, they'd gotten all the homework that was due on Monday done the day before which should have earned them a homework-free Sunday in their opinion. But Hermione had none of it and Ron hadn't stopped scowling for an hour.
“Of course.”
The answer knocked the breath out of Harry’s lungs and his immediate reaction was disbelief, then anger, then betrayal.
“You've got to be kidding me,” Malfoy muttered almost to himself as his eyes fluttered open.
Harry liked those and he would shrug like he always did.
Harry's fists were clenched, he had forgotten how to breathe.
On the night before the match – after Harry had gotten Draco to agree to bottoming – he listened to him rattle off Ravenclaw’s strengths and weaknesses for the third time. It was the last thing he wanted to listen to but it was something Draco liked to do. He might even have made a good captain if he didn’t resent the position so much.
{HPDM}
{HPDM}
Harry regretted the words the second they left his lips. He wanted to know but he hadn’t meant for it to sound like an accusation. Draco froze and in that moment Harry wished he would do something, even it meant raising his wand at him. This was a side of him he didn’t like to endure.
