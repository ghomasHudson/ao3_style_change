Draco runs his finger over the garden etched on Harry’s forearm. “Whenever the need for whiskey got strong enough, I cut it with a different type of pain. It’s how I’ve stayed sober a year.”
“Just an exploding charm! Just an exploding charm, he says. As though you didn’t successfully make a mechanical toy cast magic. That’s cause for celebration. I’ll let Molly know she needs to make a cake. What do you want? Lemon cake?”
Harry shrugs and offers Draco his other arm. Gemini, angry and red, still covered in plastic. Fresh.
Dean seems too invested in the conversation to notice her sudden recovery. “What is it? What are you all talking about?”
“I’m not going to get you in trouble,” Harry says, and then there’s a calloused hand grabbing his shoulder a little too tightly.
“Mr Malfoy,” Snape says. He’s scribbling something on a piece of paper when Draco enters the potions room for detention. Draco stands in front of his desk, arms crossed, foot tapping. Snape doesn’t look at him.
“Don’t be stupid; we’re together in every universe.” But Draco considers. “Though I suppose it’s a good idea to view the universe first before we commit. I read something about a pensive at Borgin and Burkes?”
“AVADA KEDAVRA,” she yells, one spell in a latticework sky. Draco zig-zags through red; orange; yellow; green, meant to kill him.
Draco winds up a monkey toy Arthur brought home from work, places it on the floor and joins Arthur behind their cardboard fortress.
Draco babbles when he’s nervous, and Harry’s unwittingly given him a pandora’s box of a rant topic. An IKEA box, maybe — the rant has more parts than Harry expects it to.
The other boy continues, slowly. “And we’re going to go to the store to see if they took anything or left any clues. Weren’t you listening?”
“Hmmm, yes, then, well. Ok.” He wants this too much. There’s no way he’s not going to ruin something he wants this much. No way something he wants this much isn’t going to ruin him. And
Granger’s been at the top of his Don’t Fuck With List for a long time, so it’s not surprising that she’s better at fighting than Draco is, but it’s still Fucking Annoying. He definitely wouldn’t want to be on the receiving end of her fist.
didn’t even know. So she’s manipulative, and creative, and tactical, and ruthless, and sneaky. So  would you rather have someone like that running a blood supremacist mob, or a half-deranged old man more bent on destroying a teenager than advancing his own cause?”
That’s enough context. Harry pushes their mouths together, works his tongue into Draco’s smile. His body starts to change in response, expand, grow taller and wider. Harry uses his new mass to press Draco against the wall.
Draco laughs and runs his hand across his face. “I’m trying to make a segue, you know. To tell you I’m ready. I thought if I was poetic about the whole thing It’d make me less scared, but it didn’t. I’m still scared.”
Grimmauld Place was clearly decorated by someone with a lot of money and no taste. The house is full of furniture that looks expensive — that definitely was expensive — and doesn’t match the wallpaper, or the drapes, or the other furniture. The dining room the Order meets in has a huge mahogany table in the center, brown drapes embroidered with interlocking gold flowers, and several large paintings of ducks that squawk at you if they catch you staring.
Voldemort has the horcruxes?” Granger’s words are low and slow, coated in lighter fluid even though she knows there’s a match in the room. “What
“Did everyone make it? Fred and George? Potter? Ron, Ginny, Granger, Ollivander, Luna, Dean?” He runs through the events of the manor mission, searching for people he might have forgotten. “Pan?”
It’s familiar. He dreams of this small brown room; its brick walls, curved stone door and faint dripping sound. A dust-covered prelude to ripping, burning skin. His last stay here — three years ago? Four? — had started in the dungeons and ended with Narcissa branding him with the dark mark.
Granger juts her chin in the air. She towers over Ron, who is still sitting at the head of the kitchen table. “You really weren’t going to do it?”
“Don’t say it out loud.” Draco’s intent on ignoring the whole thing. Or maybe listening to Molly and
eating chocolate cake on his birthday, and there’s Remus and his dad and oh, a little girl with green eyes. His sister. He has a sister. Maybe even multiple. He reaches out instinctively to grab the kid’s hand, and the scene changes.
can keep him away from his room for more than ten minutes on the weekend so I’m giving myself a hard five minute time limit. Also, she’s making me give her free flying lessons so that she can take Blaise out as payment which means I’m tangentially helping Blaise which means that when you say emergency you had better mean emergency. Ok, now you can tell me how much you miss me, how good it is to see me, etc., etc.”
“You refuse to acknowledge where you came from. I find that personally offensive as the man who loved the man who died for you.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “You caught me,” he rattles the chain he’s attached to the wall with. “The other Death Eaters caught me too. We were playing tag. Loser has to do a stint in the dungeons.
They had helped him heal, but that didn’t mean they understood the wound. Draco is — and always has been — alone in his understanding.
Last year ended with Draco and Ginny pulling a series of ingenious pranks on Blaise and the other students who had been bullying her. A public declaration of their friendship. Slytherin house had responded with a collective,
After Ginny, Katie, Anthony, Susan, Mandy, Hannah, Padma, Marcus, Ginny again, and Anthony again, Harry decides to learn how to make an apple pie.
The end of his wand bursts into flames. His hand jerks left. He tries to steady his thrashing arm with his other hand; sparks fly everywhere. “WHAT THE —” Potter starts. Draco twists around and watches the reflection of the firestorm in his glasses.
“AVADA KEDAVRA!” Ginny yells at Narcissa, who flicks her wrist and sends the curse flying off into the distance.
A pause. “I’m so worried. Aren’t you worried? I’m so worried. There are a million ways to fuck up a kid. So many ways. A million. I’m not positive we’ll even be able to put her together right, and what if we do, and then she's alive, and she has a soul and we have to
He presses a sliver of paper into Harry’s hand. It’s a receipt from the last time they saw one another. Six butterbeers, one order of fish & chips. They had gotten drunk enough that they hadn’t noticed when the polyjuice wore off, and when they had, they stayed anyways, together, as themselves, in a back booth at The Three Broomsticks. “It was proof you didn’t mind being seen with me in public. That you might even be willing to be seen with me in public again, if I kept going, if I kept working toward making a world where that was possible.”
By the time they actually get there, Harry regrets telling Draco he didn’t realize IKEA was a magical corporation original started by Salazar Slytherin a million times over.
Harry hadn’t been impressed. “It’s so clinical. Where’s the romance? He lives in Paris. Shouldn’t he know about romance? You deserve someone who wants to live with you because he wants
tired.” She yawns and leans her head against the wall. “Plus it’s hot and I can see — ghosts. Big, scary,
“Oh, I’m actually going to France with Minerva next week,” his aunt says before he can actually tell her
“Come on, cut him some slack. You remember how much of a little shit he was back then,” Fred says. “Course he didn’t play quidditch; he didn’t have any friends.”
Potter steadies a tomato with one hand, glides the knife through it with the other, his motion practiced and precise, in control. Draco swallows.
“If you knew my father, you would know that’s a ridiculous question. My mother won the house cup for Slytherin all three years she was captain.”
Right. Shit. “I know that. I was just saying so for your sake, so you don’t get confused. I’m not your friend. I can cast a patronus.”
, he whispers in his mind), it had been a means to an end, an unexpected source of power. But here, in the place he feels safest, it might amount to something. Draco’s not brave enough to even
The doorbell rings, and Draco chuckles, a raspy eh-eh-eh, his best impression of Voldemort giggling. It might be the most absurd noise Harry’s ever heard. Later, he’ll hear it come out of a dream-hazy Voldemort’s mouth in place of Kill the Spare and wake laughing, safe in Draco’s arms.
Draco stabs his roast chicken with a fork. “He never calls on me in class. He won’t look at me. He never comments on my potions. He hates me. It’s fine. I hate him too.”
The wards, which are generated by all of the bodies buried in the forest surrounding the manor, burn too. They flash into perception, a wall of translucent colors braided tightly together, shiny and faded, like the round surface of a bubble. The center’s charred; the burn-mark works its way across the pattern until it hits the edges and dissolves completely.
Draco keeps his workstation neat. A pile of electronic parts in one corner, magical oddities in the other, room to work in the center. Not that he’s an especially neat person — a good portion of the trash on the floor is his — but his brain thinks spatially and it’s hard to work when he can’t lay things out and move them around.
He repeats the mantra over and over again in his head, trying to chase away imaginings of what a wizarding world controlled by his mother would look like. Still, his heart beat quickens. Still, a sense of dread pushes down on his chest. Still, he feels claustrophobic in his own body. On edge, spilling out, failing to escape this moment where his past catches up to him and engulfs him completely.
been ransacked or not. There’s lots of takeout boxes, brightly colored wrappers and parts of old projects spread all over the floor. The twins’ combined workspace — two desks with a table setup between them — is covered in odd objects labeled with pink sticky notes. “Not for butts!!!” reads one on an electronic octopus. A sparkly black vile has “Can’t see the fucking lights,” and “Not Bulbadox juice, Draco” and “For butts” all posted on it.
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose. The little gray kitten with one black head and one white head starts rubbing herself against his body. He scratches the white head behind her ear with his free hand. The black head meows, and he stops pinching the bridge of his nose to scratch behind her ear too. “As much as I would love to blame you, and I still am,
“PROTEGO,” Potter screams, and Draco is knocked into a shelf full of Whiz-bangs. Sizzle-Boom-Pop. He focuses on the sound of the fireworks, takes deep, deep breaths. His hand is bleeding. His nose hurts. His ear still hurts, too, come to think of it.
He suspects Ron feels similarly, but Draco hasn’t been able to look at him since apparating to the tent. Ron will need to comfort or be comforted by Draco, and Draco doesn’t feel up to either.
There’s a noise on the other end that Draco can’t make out, either a pained laugh or a sigh, and if Harry would hurry up and say something back that would be ideal. This is why Draco never confesses these type of things, he feels open and exposed. Plus, the dynamite is digging uncomfortably into his jeans.
“Yes, really! And you can’t take that portkey because— because— it’ll wreck him. You're his whole world.”
It’s Draco, with a scar cross-cutting his face, skittish and fear-hardened, an orphan with an inherent distrust of stability. Snape smuggled him out of the Manor as a baby and entrusted him to Andromeda, who raised him on the run from Death Eaters. He didn’t go to Hogwarts. Draco and Harry had never even
Hermione has never regretted teaching Draco to pick locks more than when he switches the lights on in her bedroom at 3 a.m. on the only day-off she’s had in months.
“Stop bothering him,” Harry says. Granger narrows her eyes and engages him in one of their silent turf wars. Harry must win, because Granger changes the direction of her questioning.
There’s more rustling, muffled talking. Then, Ron exits into the living room mid-yawn, Granger right behind him.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Snape says again. He should be crying. Why isn’t he crying? The left side of his mouth twitches downward a little. Or maybe Draco just blinks. “You may clean the potions closet for your detention, and you may do so quietly. I will take 10 points for any noise that disturbs my work. 20 points if I hear your voice.”
“Ohhhh much better, thank you for asking.” She grabs his hands and holds one against her cheek. “I’ve always thought you had such beautiful hands.”
“Yes, really,” Ginny says, her attention still focused on Draco. “It really is good. Be happy for me.”
“That’s the entire point of being a spy.” Draco rolls his eyes and kicks some of the rubble of the Ravenclaw common room. They’re standing in what was Hogwarts until around ten hours ago, when it became a battleground, and then a place for celebration. Everyone’s in the main hall now, dancing and drinking firewhiskey and trying to figure out how to balance mourning with triumph. Harry slipped out to find Draco when Seamus and Dean started a teary rendition of Weasley is our King.
Draco’s a connoisseur of Potter’s anger; he’s seen every shade from slight distaste to fury. Right now, Potter’s shaking, his hands bunched at his side. Seething. The only other time he’s seen this stage, Draco ended up with several scars across his chest. If he was thinking clearly, he would back off and allow Potter space to cool down. But Draco’s seething too, the only thought in his mind: what does Potter’s rage look like?
“So I’m supposed to just walk around hissing?” Draco’s eyes steel the way they do when he realizes he’s wrong but has decided to continue on with his plan as though he’s not.
“I don’t know. It’s not as though I want to be someone specific. I didn’t even really know I wanted to be someone else until right now, when you were
“Harry and Draco? No. No. I mean, no. Harry says some stuff sometimes that’s like, ‘mate, what,’ but no, it’s a bonkers idea, really bonkers,” Ron says. Pansy leans in and smiles.
There’s a half-formed insult about the sound of Granger’s voice on the tip of his tongue, but he doesn’t have the energy to work out the words.
It’s almost 7 p.m. The tent smells amazing. From the timber of the humming, Potter’s the one rambling around the kitchen, making himself dinner.
“You shouldn’t have gotten me involved,” Draco says. With the vanishing cabinet in sixth year, but also now. Pan shouldn’t have reminded him — or Harry, currently standing near the trash can and trying to disappear into Molly’s red toile wallpaper — exactly how thin the veil separating Draco’s life from its shadow is. His past is always right there, lurking just outside of his vision. Reaching out to him with oily hands. Standing in his kitchen.
Draco tries to remember what he knows about the manor’s lockdown procedure, if he ever learned the spell to end it. His mind comes up blank, save for memories of his father showing him the wards, telling him about all the people who died to keep them safe.
“Yes,” he says and walks into the garden. Harry follows behind him like a dog. He’s not even sure he can speak parseltongue unless he’s actively looking at a snake, but he really doesn’t know how to turn Draco down when he has that intense look in his eye.
There are two possibilities: Pan lied to him and actually cast some sort of tracking charm or curse on him instead of keying him into the wards, and they’re fucked, or the Manor’s in lockdown mode and the wards won’t let anyone in or out, and they’re fucked.
. I was all, ‘That’s Crabbe! Right over there!’ Anyways, me and Draco want some privacy. Would you mind standing right here for the rest of the train ride? Perfect, thanks Crabbe, don’t move until we get to Hogwarts. Bye!”
, it’s at least a little bit not your fault. We get calls like this from muggleborms fairly often. There was a translation error from the old runes to English to wizarding communities to muggles. Wizarding cats don’t have nine
“Severus …” Lucius starts. Snape pulls the comforter tighter against him. “If you insist on being dramatic, I won’t stop you. Storms are excellent for drama. The exact right mood to have a fight. I think I still have some of King Lear memorized.” Lucius walks to the wardrobe and pulls out a silk bathrobe he ties over his pajamas. “‘
” Ginny catches the wand-maker before Draco can finish the word. Potter’s beside him, suddenly, reaching his hand out, “Get on my broom!” Draco lets himself be pulled sideways. Potter’s arms wrap around his stomach, and Draco touches back down into his own body.
Harry nods. Disappointed, but not too much. They both want this, which makes it as good as inevitable. One of the things he loves most about Draco is that he does things on his own schedule. Harry never has to worry about pressuring him into something.
“I’m trying to help.” Harry places a hand on his shin. Draco jerks his leg away from the touch. He doesn’t want vague sympathetic meanings right now. He wants to hurt.
“Draco,” Molly says. “Either that blanket did something to offend you or you’ve got something on your mind.”
“Not enough to tell me when people are conspiring behind my back. Not enough to consult me on huge, life-threatening decisions!”
“Something’s coming,” George says. “Something really, really bad. I know we know what’s coming but actually what we know is coming is only part of what’s coming and what’s actually coming is much, much worse than what we think we know is coming. It’s going to eat the really bad thing we know is coming for breakfast. Literally. I know.”
“I didn’t even tell him about Buckbeak. He just knew. I think he might be spying on me, and what am I meant to do if that’s true? Hogwarts is the only place I don’t have to worry about his bullshit pureblood rules.”
“Potter,” Draco says when Harry reaches the bar. The blonde pours fire whiskey in a glass and gives it to a burly wizard who winks at him. Draco winks back. Up close, Harry can see the cracks in his appearance. The bags under his eyes, the strands of hair not completely loyal to whatever grooming charm Draco uses, the stain on his jeans. He looks
instead,” he tells Molly three hours into an intense heart-to-heart, the first stop on his Harry Potter Gets His Shit Together Tour.
Except, he can. Not consciously, but he knows something’s locked inside him. It crinkles his thoughts; it lengthens his nerves. He feels off-balance. He feels restless. He feels wrong — no, not wrong. Something else. He can’t remember the name for the feeling anymore.
Draco fights a smile. He is Very Mad at Pan and Definitely Does Not find their response to Granger’s rather flippant remark funny.
“We weren’t expecting youuuuu to be here. What a treat for Auntie.” Draco lunges at her, wand drawn, a question on his tongue. “Where are they?”
But when Ron speaks, he’s firm and steady. In planning-mode, not solace-mode. “Alrighty then, they probably have the twins at Malfoy Manor, yeah? Draco how do we break into Malfoy Manor.”
“Wellllll isn’t this a lovely little display of house unity,” someone says in the doorway. Draco moves quick to one side of the kitchen. Harry mirrors him and crosses to the other. Suddenly, there’s six feet of space between them, and Pan, standing with their arms crossed in the middle.
“I … don’t know what I’m doing. I mean I am very very familiar with the mechanics. I do read. But I’m lacking in the practical application department so …”
Harry’s scowl deepens. “My life's not all fun and games, you know. I can’t go out in public without anyone trying to take my picture.”
Draco thinks, and sticks his head in the bowl. The world swirls, shifts, and now he’s in a dark room.
Draco will not allow himself to consider the possibility, will not allow himself to remember the taste of Potter’s mouth. If he does, he might do something unforgivable, like reach out and touch the ridiculous bastard. Wanting like that is … Reckless. Brash. Ill-advised. His brain supplies a million different ways to say
“I hate this year already. I’m going to be on guard the whole time. Waiting for one to attack me. I’m going to start peering around corners with mirrors. ”
“Everyone’s fine. Not 100% fine, but alive fine. Ollivander has some serious curse damage, and Luna and Dean are exceedingly underfed, but everyone’s gonna make it through. Of course, we’re all gonna have to hear bad ear puns for the rest of our lives.” She breaks into a wide grin. “I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve been as happy as when the twins got home, and one of them was right before that, when Ron did.”
“You blew my mind,” Potter says maybe a minute later. He pulls Draco forward so that his feet rest against the barn floor: half-in, half-out of the car.
Charlie, Ron, Fred and Dean hoist a large bowl of lemonade and a large bowl of punch onto the other end of the table. Fleur’s trying to have a conversation with Percy, who is, predictably, drinking a butterbeer and looking extremely put-upon.
Moody’s eyes flick to Draco as Lupin starts talking about werewolf pack movements. He’s been watching Draco all evening. Ginny likes to remind Draco his hatred for Moody is unfounded, based on a version of the old wizard that was actually just several vials of polyjuice in a trench coat. But the real Moody is just as paranoid and unsettling as the fake one had been. He listens to each report with his head attentively cocked to one side, occasionally yelling things like, “Evil is everywhere! Check your homes!” and “Good people don’t eat that many salty snacks!”
What do you say to get a snake to return to you? Harry doesn’t know, and there’s a lot of ground to cover so he starts at
“You’ve assembled a real Noah’s Ark for us today, Potter,” Pansy says as they slot themselves into their normal seat beside Luna. Luna kisses their cheek, and Pansy doesn’t smile, exactly, just looks gloomy in a slightly higher key.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Lupin says when Draco knocks on his door early the next morning. Lupin doesn’t do a good job of hiding his surprise. He doesn’t do a very good job of keeping his office clean either. The small room is covered in piles of books and papers. Also: half-eaten candy bars, empty mugs, and three different maroon-and-gold sweaters. Draco’s initial impression of Lupin was that he was scatterbrained and only barely able to take care of himself. The state of his office proves it: Draco’s an exceptional judge of character.
Pan drops Draco and walks toward the other side of the classroom, throwing a handful of dried wormwood in Draco’s cauldron as they go. His potion explodes.
Fuck it all. He sucks all the courage he possibly can out of Potter’s skin and drops to his knees in front of the other boy.
“What? I’m happy for you, let’s celebrate with music and a cheese platter, but you can’t expect me to be surprised.
“And then we happened on Ron, Hermione and Harry while we were trying to escape. Wasn’t too hard to beat both Notts with the element of surprise on our side,” Fred continues. “We were trying to get out, but somehow we ended up back here. Don’t suppose you know a way out that doesn’t involve apparation or the floo?”
Granger casts a disillusionment charm over the group as soon as they’re all geared-up. Not that it’s going to do much — disillusionment charms notoriously don’t work well on objects in motion — but it at least settles some nerves. The plan is to fly until they’re outside the manor’s anti-apparation wards, then apparate to The Burrow. It’s not a very good plan — no plan that can be foiled by someone looking out a window at the right time can be considered a
at almost exactly the same volume. Fred flicks him in the head. They’re flanked by Ron, Granger and Potter, thank god, but Draco can only focus on the twins.
“Cooking’s cool,” Potter says, his hand still working up and down and up and down. “It’s like, the whole world is very complicated and incomplete, but this is a goal that I can actually accomplish.”
, and thus frustrating. Sirius won’t give up any details either, outside of blanket support for hiring any and all disgraced purebloods. But Harry’s dying to know what, exactly, made Draco brave.
“Wanna bet? If I can get them together in 10 minutes, how about you come home with me tonight?” Ron spits out his drink. “Don’t be a prude. I’m friends with Blaise. I know you and The Bookworm aren’t strictly monogamous.”
“I don’t know. I don’t feel guilty. He was so shitty to me for so long. I can’t find it in myself to care.”
“Draco?” Harry’s talking slow and deliberate, doesn’t he know they’re on a deadline? “Did you need something? We’re about to go to the Peabody Essex Museum.”
, his core pressing up and up and up against his body, into his body, higher still. Every part of him is
None of the windows are broken, but that’s it for good news. There are scorch marks on the walls, the lingering smell of smoke. A thin layer of shimmering pink liquid covers the floor; the love potions, all shattered and pooling together. Fake teeth chatter their way through crumbled boxes. Everything strewn together, smashed, somber.
“Are you ok? If you, ah, if you want to keep doing … this, I need you to say something. I, ah, want to.”
“Malfoy Stop!” Potter yells, a ridiculous command when finally Draco is getting to do what he’s wanted to do for years, reach out and hit and touch, and Potter’s skin feels so good against Draco’s fist, and if they stop then Draco will be standing in the ruins of a place he loves. He punches Potter in the stomach.
“Voldemort was threatening my brother. What was I supposed to do? It was go along with his plan or sacrifice my family. There was no third option. I don’t have a magical family of redheads to help me with my problems. It was just me, all by myself. Choosing to save my brother’s life. You would have done the same thing in my position.”
“I’m sorry we have to stop Narcissa,” Draco says. “I know that her coup would mean a way out for you, but … it really would be worse.”
“Except they don’t know how to do that. How long do you think it’ll take the Death Eaters to figure that one out?”
He looks at Ollivander, barely conscious now; and Luna, whose eyes are glossy and unfocused. Dean’s trying to pretend he’s not nursing a broken ankle. The three of them aren’t in good shape. He doubts they’d be able to make it through a longer rescue mission.
He looks around at his team, a combination of regular members and new faces. There’s Luna and Pansy, of course, and Ron, who is currently consorting with the enemy — towering over Fred and George’s table in the corner, gesticulating widely about quidditch, one hand clamped around an empty bottle. Hermione and Anthony Goldstein are deep in conversation on the other side of Luna. Anthony’s eyes keep sliding over to Harry, and Harry’s trying to pretend he doesn’t notice. Inviting Anthony was Hermione’s idea, a way to smooth things over between them after their breakup. So far, nothing is smooth, and everything is very, very awkward. Two Gryffindors. Two Ravenclaws.
“How about you go get me another drink and while you’re up there you can decide if you actually want to win tonight or not. I’m for it, personally. Two Gryffindors. Two Ravenclaws. Two Slytherins. Has a nice ring to it. Symmetry.”
telling George that if he wanted to actually be psychic he should start by not being so completely clueless all the time.” Ginny stands on the seat and peers up at the Leo constellation. “What can this tell me about my future?”
He pulls his collar down a little. Dozens of twinkling stars, and the moon. Draco would give anything to undo the rest of the buttons and see the night sky.
Harry brushes long blonde hair out of Draco’s face, runs his hand along a jaw he’s never seen grow stubble because Draco cheats and uses a shaving charm. Kisses him fiercely, once, twice, three times, each a reminder that the best things in life are found in other people.
It’s not what he wants to say. It’s not large enough. But Draco’s eyes soften, and he pulls Harry close. They craft the meaning together: a kiss; a homecoming; a love letter to their past endurance and all the future versions of themselves that are happy and away from here.
“Well… It was hard. There was a lot of fear and uncertainty because of all of the Death Eaters in the school. They thought we would be easily cowed because our “saviour” was off in the wind. And we thought we could handle a few Death Eaters. We’d done it before, at least two years in a row. And the entire Army, plus a few other students, had staged a full-scale rebellion against Umbridge fifth year.”
The days leading up to Christmas were hectic. Andi, Harry, and Draco all took turns minding Teddy while the rest did the holiday shopping and everyone decorated at night after the little monster had gone to bed. Kreacher was dealing with most of the preparations, but Harry and Andi liked helping out.
“I refuse to believe every compartment is full to Saint Potter,” Draco said with a sneer. It wasn’t as malicious as when they were kids. He looked stunned by hearing those words come out of his mouth but didn't say anything. Harry didn’t say anything either, unsure of what to say. The silence turned stale between them as Harry sat on the bench across from him.
“There are no more Order members to ask, and the Wizarding world at large has heard of the curse and are refusing me! I even asked an
“I can’t believe his mother said that!” Hermione said to herself for the hundredth time. Harry shrugged, slumping further onto the couch.
hey welcome back! it's been ages! the pandemic really took a lot out of me, and my writing was one of them. plus all the bullshit jowling kowling rowling has been pulling kind of demotivated me. found this in my wips and decided to try and finish it. it might be a little difficult bc i started this when i finished book 7 my freshman year of college. i'm a senior now. i havent read the books since, but thankfully i have a lot of notes. buckle in, we're updating again!
Actually, it’s because his memory isn’t big enough to hold the main atrium. It’s huge. Taller than he remembers, with more rooms branching off from it and an entire extra fountain he completely forgot about — two intertwining dragons, water coming out of each of their mouths.
It takes a bit of wriggling — Dean watches with barely concealed amusement — but Draco manages to get his shoe off with only one hand. He kicks the metal tool across the floor to Ollivander. It makes a slight
“Hermione!” Ron stands up. She stares at the space above his head intently and then turns around to slide the wooden door closed.
“It’s bullshit to rush to the ending you expect because you’re scared of what’ll happen when you get there. Not when it’s something like this. Not when it’s love.”
Sometime around their 15th anniversary, Harry starts to become obsessed with the back of Draco’s neck. The tiny freckles, pale blonde hairs he can feel but not see, the taste. His favorite thing is to press the pads of his fingers to the plush skin and stroke all the way down the bumps of Draco’s spine, pausing only to savor the hitch in his lover’s breathing when he grazes his ring finger over the dip in Draco’s lower back.
” Molly says. Moody rolls his eye and slouches. No one can threaten you with your own name quite like Molly Weasley can.
“You’ll be proud of me, Draco, I spent most of my summer studying,” Pan says. Ginny snorts. “At first, it was only because I was trying to impress Sinistra — Her sister’s on the Wizengamot, and I’m meant to become a lawyer. But astronomy is
“It’s awful.” He’s never seen himself smile like this before — he’s never seen himself before, really. Teenage rebellion is tacky and campy and fool-hearted and harrowing and traumatic and fucking funny. Draco’s always been all of those things. How nice, to finally look the way he feels.
What the hell is Draco supposed to say to that? How is he supposed to tell Harry that the entire incident is the canary in the coal mine, sorta, an indicator of how Draco cares for people incorrectly, cares for them to the point of capture?
“Finish that sentence,” Snape drawls, “And I will take 1000 points and give you detention every day for the rest of the school year. I will tell Dumbledore that you stole valuable potions ingredients from me and have you expelled.”
When he came back down, Harry was waiting by the front door, humming absently. He hadn’t changed out of his baggy jeans and a white tshirt, but was now wearing Sirius’ leather jacket
“Tell me to stop if you don’t want this,” he murmured, cupping Draco’s face tenderly. He swallowed hard again, unable to form a coherent thought other than
His pouty thoughts were disrupted by a loud thump. Someone had dropped onto the bench next to Draco, their book bag falling gracelessly to the floor.
“I promise, I won’t let you down!” she squeaked. She was only a third year, but she out flew and outplayed the older students that had tried. Harry gave her a warm grin and a pat on the shoulder.
the problems Bill does and could have faced if things had happened differently. I can’t imagine them letting Bill do the job he loves as a werewolf. And then there’s Lavender… We may not have ended things properly, but she doesn’t deserve to have her life destroyed like this because of the War.”
Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Harry was all-too-familiar with the whispers of these people. He spent most of his Hogwarts days being the center of any and all gossip, so he knew when he was being talked about.
as of 12/28/18 this fic has been updated!! i added over 1k to this chapter alone,,, (also check out the lie above h a h) IF YOU HAVENT READ CHAPTER FOUR SINCE I UPDATED STOP AND DO THAT NOW there's new information now bc i hate my life
Forgetting the school day, as he had for several days in a row, he stalked out onto the Quidditch pitch.
“And then I sat in the kitchens and cried. It was like he’d managed to pierce through to everything I’d felt after the war. He had no idea he’d done it.
soak in the goodness of men talking about their feelings because apparently that's all i know how to write
“Potter. Is there a reason you’ve been skipping classes?” McGonagall asked sternly. Her one raised eyebrow cut through Harry more than any spell or blade could.
“The rest of the world has had tellies for at least forty years by this point. We’ve had computers for about that long too, and now we have the Internet. I’m just saying, I think it’s time for the Wizarding world to catch up. Might make us stick out less.” Harry shrugged, taking a long drink of his pint and turning his attention back to the telly.
“Thanks, Hermione,” he said instead, a genuine smile on his face. He knew she was there for him, he just didn't know what exactly he felt. She smiled back, briefly placing her hand on his before going back to her paper. Their breakfast was quiet and actually quite nice, but the niceness was disrupted by rowdy students and his team and their excited chatter and exuberant bets.
“They should televise Quidditch games. I’d love to watch them at home, rather than just listening to them,” Harry said with that excited glint he gets in his eye when they play Quidditch.
Harry dropped the pillow into his lap and pulled Draco into a kiss. Everyone else moved on to opening the rest of the presents without them, letting them have their moment. When they separated, Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s.
Harry and Draco didn't talk for almost two weeks. Harry stayed at Ron and Hermione’s flat, summoning his clothes as he needed them. Draco sent him an owl every day, but Harry never read them. He couldn’t just apologize by owl post. This wasn’t a small misstep or slight; it would take more than a three-page apology to make up for it.
Pan looks at him weird, and continues. “It’s been so much worse now that neither of us live at home, too. It’s like he’s going stir crazy since there’s no one there for him to lord over. He only
Relief washes over Draco’s face. Sirius walks behind the bar and pushes Draco in Harry’s direction, shoves a drink in his hand. Draco’s so close to Harry, now, so real. The whites of his knuckles pulled tight against the glass, the slight jitter of his foot, the uncertainty in his eyes.
“Oh, yes, you look more handsome. All orphans are handsome didn’t you know?” Harry says. “It’s my honor to welcome you to our elite and exclusive club.”
“Seems a little far-fetched, if I’m being honest,” Arthur says when Draco shows him the blueprints for the solution he came up with. He turns the paper one way, then another. “Let’s do it.”
Draco squares his shoulders, thinks about the way Charlie and Bill’s faces looked when they lost and casts.
rolling off of Draco, who preens and peppers Benny with more questions related to the balls-to-the-walls, batshit — thoughtful — present he got Harry.
Draco doesn’t especially like the look on Ron’s face. “I can see the wheels in your head turning. Having someone purposely get captured won’t work. It’s stupid. It’s dangerous. You have to be keyed into the wards to use the floo.”
also ! so you know what's up: the structure of this fic is two "flicker" chapters [the present], then one "tinder" chapter [the past]. expect more Weasley-Draco childhood shenanigans next chapter, is basically what i mean.
“You’re defecting,” Lucius says. His fury falls away as he steps into the heart of Snape’s secret. “You’re going to betray him.”
“Fine,” Draco says. He stares at Pan, who is tapping one black boot against the floor and still staring at the ceiling. “You were going to frame me for smuggling Death Eaters into Hogwarts in sixth year. There. We’re done talking.”
“Spicy tomato rice. It’s vegetarian. I’m vegetarian,” Potter levels Draco with his gaze. “I was, ah, making some for you too. Ron and Hermione went out for dinner.”
for the act. Lust, and touch, that’s all that’s needed. Nowadays, mostly me and my partner kiss. At least … we used to.”
“Hi Ginny,” Granger says. She looks at the large smile on her boyfriend’s face, tender. Draco’s sure he sports the same sappy expression Ron does, but he’s too happy to care.
Draco hears them. The whisperers in the walls. His friends. The ones who speak with violin-string tongues. He talks back.
“Next matter!” Moody bangs his fist on the table once Lupin finishes speaking. The room is silent. One of the duck paintings squawks. “Fine. The Child can speak now.”
Score one for the Slytherins. Also —” Draco beams. “Also, it’s going to take a lot longer for her to adjust to the fourth head. It probably won’t happen until she’s fully grown. I’m talking months.”
It shouldn’t be comforting, saying someone’s name over and over again, but it is. Communication without pretense; the linguistic equivalent of a hug. They reach toward each other with the minimum amount of language and allow affection and shared experiences to do the rest.
charm. Her tone is both cold and cordial, as though she’s conducting business she finds rather unpleasant. Her aloofness peels the bandaid off settled emotions.
Exploding charms, as all of Draco’s research has shown, require an extremely small amount of magical power to cast and are also — obviously — explosive. He basically channeled magical and mechanical power’s natural tendency to react poorly to each other somewhere specific. It was almost easy.
The war had been hard on everyone, but they were all sat here, giving Draco advice on how to handle his now celebrity-status relationship with smiles and laughter and
He didn't answer her question. There were more important things to talk about. “Andi, is there any way you know of to get rid of a Permanent Sticking Charm?” He asked, fiddling with the book in his hands.
“You don’t have to be,” Draco whispered right back. Together, they headed toward the dungeons, barely a space between them.
“Ah, yes, the Weasley twins,” Neville said sagely. “Men ahead of their time, certainly. This was long before the war, but when we were just first years…”
“You aren’t going to play the sympathetic boyfriend today?” He was whining, and he sounded petulant and sulky at the same time. He didn't want a lecture, he wanted Draco to be soft and sweet to him.
Turns out he’d overslept after their interrupted evening. He ran all the way to the Great Hall. The doors slammed open and everyone jerked to look at Seamus. He stood in the center for a moment before running towards his friends with a mischievous glint in his eye.
The look of affront of Draco’s face warped into hurt. He’d forgotten how much of a self-absorbed ass Harry could be sometimes. But the look of hurt on Draco’s face must have been misread as a pitying look because Harry just exploded.
“No, not really. I care about you, which means I worry when you go Lone Wolf. I want to be here for you, Harry, but I can’t do that well if you don’t talk to me.” Harry shifted closer to his boyfriend, suddenly needing to be close to him.
After the table had been cleared, Harry and Andi did dishes together while Hermione sat in the living room, playing with Teddy. The quiet domesticity was nice, especially in the wake of the second death of Walburga Black. Harry grinned at the thought as he dried dishes, placing them in a stack next to him.
When he had accidentally forced back against Snape hard enough to enter his memories, the memory he’d seen of his father had stung. He never wanted to believe his father was a bully. He wanted to believe James was always like he was in everyone else’s memories… But McGonagall had always been straight with him, and she’d mentioned before how his father was. Tonight, the off-hand mention of his family, of Sirius and Remus, made his heart ache. People rarely talked about his family to him, wanting to avoid any kind of awkward missteps. Without much thought, Harry headed down to the one place someone was willing to talk about his family.
Harry muttered a few words and unlocked the door with a key. They walked in, Harry calling out “Teddy, Andi, I’m home!” before dropping his trunk by the door. Fear seized Draco as he remembered Walburga screaming at any disturbance, even if it had been a pure-blood that caused it.
“Yeah, well, that didn’t stop me from playing today did it…” he responded lamely. Malfoy laughed a little before dropping his head again.
“I’ve learned to overcome prejudice to see people’s true worth. What lies in their talents and skills. So tonight, I would like to introduce the newest exhibit. At Hogwarts, there was an obnoxious muggleborn Gryffindor who carried a camera around his neck. For six years, he took pictures of anything and everything. Muggle and magic pictures were developed. When the war came, he documented everything he saw, both muggle and magic. Unfortunately, he died at the Battle of Hogwarts.”
this is,,,,longer than i expected. still not like great lengths or anything, just 3.5k (HELLO GUESS WHAT ITS NOW 4.9k!!!!), but still,,, thats a lot of information.
“Want to help?” Harry asked before the quiet slipped into uncomfortable territory. “I can wash and you can dry.”
After that, Draco was easily drawn into the easy conversations as they worked their way through Christmas dinner for Draco can’t remember how many people.
“Professor…” Harry started hesitantly. He and McGonagall were on a more even footing now that the war was over and all was said and done, but he still felt like a first year when he looked at her sharp eyes and stern face.
He gently pushed Harry away so he could move. Draco shoved a hand through his hair to make it look vaguely presentable. His shirt was less of a problem, so he left it untucked. The gossip column needed something to write about on Monday anway.
“Who let you in?” Harry groaned, not looking up from where his face was buried in Draco’s shoulder. The bouncing stopped with an evil cackle and Harry cursed the Weasleys for turning Ginny into this demonic person that was now disturbing his very nice sleep.
“Come on, come on. The wait’s killing me, go ahead, set it off,” Arthur says. His red hair peaks out over the top of the cardboard.
“Errrr not really. I mean, I knew Draco wanted to give Voldemort the horcruxes. I mean, he asked me to help, but it was only, I don’t know, 15 minutes before everything exploded.”
“I lost mine in the fire.” It’s fine, really, or at least it would be if Potter would wipe the pity off of his face and treat Draco normally.
“If it could wait then I wouldn’t be trying to wade into your pissy group meeting,” Ginny says. Her hand is still clamped around Pan’s wrist.
Seven days later — the day before Christmas Eve; two weeks before Draco has to go back to Hogwarts — Arthur reinforces a piece of cardboard with a protego and places it between them and their experiment. It’s the only safety measure Arthur claims they need.
“I love him, but he’s an oblivious idiot. He’d let you go because it’s noble or something, and you’ll leave because you think it means he doesn’t care when really it all it means is … you’re both idiots! You’re perfect for one another!”
He still doesn’t like Ron’s face. “I’m not keyed into the wards anymore. I’m legally disowned. Stop looking at me.”
“I have to go to work in an hour. It’s a school day; I can’t call out this close to the start of class. I guess I can call Luna, and see if they can end their trip early —”
” Draco says. He gives each kitten head a final scratch, spins around and quickly walks back through the floo, the fire spiking briefly as he steps into it. Harry watches slack-jawed.
“I’d do it again,” Harry says. “Ah, give you the horcruxes. Well, that’s not exactly true. I wouldn’t want to get caught again, but I don’t regret giving them to you. It was the right idea.”
Fred insists on keeping the device anyways because he thinks the fake fireplace screensaver is soothing.
“The twins?” Ron asks, all large eyes and hope. Draco shakes his head. Ron lets out a miserable breath.
He can’t help it; he’s grinning. This is the first time they’ve talked in five months. She had come home for Molly’s birthday but not for Christmas, because by Christmas the Carrows were “openly tormenting the students,” her letters said, and she needed to stay and fight. Hearing her voice, being connected to her through time if not space, it’s a balm. It’s relief.
The symbol on his arm hangs over the shop now, gaudy and tacky and ominous. Draco glances at the quivering green skull in the black night sky and quickly heads to the back entrance, Potter at his heels.
(inspired specifically by the lyric, "it's like we're sitting on dynamite / But we're not ready to start a fight)
“I expected as much. Obviously, die isn’t the right word. Metamorphosis, that’s the word I’ve decided fits best. Because obviously, he’s here still.” Draco indicates the flaming baby bird sitting in a ring of ash on the corner of the armchair. “But his memories were erased, and that’s a kind of death. Kelvin was old for a phoenix — I think he was holding out for me, and he finally realized that I had no intention of going. But it was his time. I watched, out of respect. It was … beautiful. He looked so relieved. As though, finally, he could rest.”
“Today's the first night in a long time I know where all of my children are sleeping. It feels wrong to be so happy in the middle of a war, but I am.”
Messy black hair, lightning bolt scar, and then the rest of Harry, standing like a confused lighthouse in the middle of Draco’s room.
Ollivander seems to understand. “Not only us. The wizarding porn industry too. Haven’t you ever wondered why the ministry’s never been able to completely get rid of them, despite their constant best effort? Pornographers don’t want this to get out either; it’d paint a huge target on their back. Between us and them, we have a lot invested in keeping this a secret. Whenever someone gets close to figuring it out,
“I know you’re awake,” Dream Molly says. “You don’t raise eight children without learning how to tell the difference between
“Definitely. I’m sure he hates that I outlived him. Well, sort of outlived him,” Draco waves his hand. “I don’t want to think about whatever happens on the other side right now; I’m in too good of a mood. Dancing! He would’ve hated that I dance.”
He doesn’t know how to get Draco to stay, how to press his desire into language. Draco does; he’s a linguistic contortionist. He whispers the words Harry’s trying to say straight into his mouth.
He doesn’t know what Draco gets up to during the day, only that he expects to come home to sarcasm and derision and instead comes home to a soft look and an almost-fond
They’re unintentionally mirroring one other, each rubbing the back of their respective heads. Draco, because he hit it on the car when Potter surprised him. Potter, because … from the way Potter's eyes seem focused on the floor, Draco would guess Potter’s neck massage has something to do with nerves.
This is important. Molly’s going to be out of her mind with worry when she learns their apartment burned down. Focus on that.
It seems cruel to dangle such little information in front of them. To give them bad news and then disappear the same way Ron, Potter and Granger had done several months prior. Molly and Arthur had been out of their minds with worry then, and that was when only one of their children was unaccounted for. Now, it’s half their family, gone.
“Come off it, Potter. If you get me in trouble, I swear—” There’s something like fear on Draco’s face.
Harry’s heard what it means several times before. Draco’s fond of this particular speech — it staves off Draco's fear of death, Harry suspects. Harry doesn’t understand most of the points Draco makes, but he listens anyways. Draco’s mind moves faster than his does — than anyone’s does, probably. He’s the one that figured out the Fiendfyre hadn’t died as much as it had escaped. It burns still, inside the two people who spent the longest time zig-zagging through its flames. It preserves the two of them. Prevents them from dying.
Something almost tender passes across Draco’s face. He fishes in his pocket and pulls out three treats he places in front of the little kitten. The white kitten head immediately starts rubbing up against his hand. “Yes, well, she’s still
and then Harry had rolled over and said, “I want to suck you off,” and Draco had stopped thinking all together.
“I’m, ah, sorry. I didn’t realize the monochromatic thing was important to you. Maybe you should explain it to me?”
Draco is weary and battered when Harry sees him again, with a left arm that hangs limp and a constant tremor from overexposure to the Cruciatus Curse. But when he speaks, it’s strong and clear, exactly as Harry remembers.
“Oh yes, We saw Fred and George a few days ago. Or maybe a few hours ago. Sometime …” Luna trails off. “It was nice when they were here. George and I talked about ostriches. He’s holy, did you know that?”
You’re right. That was rude. I’m sorry. We appreciate all the work you’ve done as a spy, and we definitely can use any information you have. So.
“You don’t remember when they were here, do you?” Luna directs her comment at a gray lump in the corner. It grunts in response. One hand shoots out to pull the ratty gray blanket tight. What sort of Death Eater gives their prisoners blankets?
“Nobody is saying that,” Ginny says. “We’re saying that we should just wait and see what happens. What do you think we should do? Try to stop it? Getting involved in a Death Eater civil war seems bad, regardless of the outcome.”
“Your hand shouldn’t be bleeding like this. You want to punch with your knuckles, not the flats of your fingers.”
The Ace of Spades sits fifth from the top right now. He pulls the card beneath it. The King of Hearts. Harry looks at him for a second too long — not even a second, really; a millisecond; a micro-millisecond, but Draco knows Harry’s rhythms well enough to know when he’s staring.
But when Draco boards the train on the first day of his third year, all he can think about is how much he hates the stained maroon seats, the lackluster metal finishings, the small compartments that don’t lock. The train is crawling with their classmates, none of whom Draco wants to talk to until he absolutely must. How is he supposed to avoid their questioning glances and questioning questions if he can’t prevent them from barging into his compartment?
“We left the fucking wards down. We let them down so that you could find us and then Bellatrix— Fucking Bellatrix
Ron’s staring at Hermione, and Harry’s trying not to stare at Draco, and Draco’s trying not to feel too strongly about Harry trying not to stare at him. Lust is not exactly a finite resource here.
to let a student experiment on the steam engine,” Draco says. “I wish I could mess around with trains. I’ve seen diagrams of how the charms are interwoven. The engine has a huge spell on it, actually, the first of its kind—”
“So you’re going to transform into a werewolf on Friday. Would you like company? I’m assuming you’re on wolfsbane, and I’m an animagus, remember.”
“You can stay with us tonight,” he says to Teddy. “It’ll be ok; the storm will pass,” he says to the boy who learned to wake whenever there were loud noises outside his cupboard and can only go back to sleep when his bed is full.
“DMV’s closed,” Steve says. “Both of you need to leave. Especially you, Parry comma Hotter. You didn’t even have an appointment today.”
Late in the evening, George punctuates his sentence by spilling butterbeer all over Draco, and Draco breaks eye contact with Harry to tune back into the conversation happening next to him.
Harry shrugs. “I’m too busy worrying about everything else, I guess. I wish I didn’t. I wish I could stop. I wish—”
It’s a good thing they’re in the middle of a field because he’s yelling. He’s really, truly full-lungs yelling.
and ends up talking to his impromptu roommate until Draco proclaims that he has to sleep or else the entire pet-owning population of wizarding Britain will suffer.
“I wasn’t intending on company, but if you’d like to join me, I wouldn’t mind,” he said honestly, downing the rest of his pumpkin juice before thanking the house-elves and walking out. Malfoy followed Harry back out of the portrait hole.
“Does your mum want to host, or do you want me to?” Harry asked Ginny as they made their way to an empty compartment on the train.
“Ah, sorry, I didn’t mean to sneak up on you,” Potter says. He’s standing at the entrance of the barn sporting a case of bedhead that looks more unruly than his usual bedhead. He’s slept recently; that’s good. “Molly sent me to get a screwdriver. She, ah, didn’t say you’d be out here.”
Draco recoils. Pan moves their head in an exasperated figure-eight motion. “I’m trying to say I’m sorry, you know. Last I saw, Fred and George were in the main atrium. You’ll need access to the floo to get out.” They flick their wand nonchalantly, and Draco feels warmth spread from his chest to the rest of his body. “And obviously I’m coming with you, so really you had better go ahead and forgive me because otherwise it's going to make the rest of this horribly uncomfortable —”
“Dobby is dead. The Manor is secure again. They’re not gonna pack up and move when they have a huge house done up with all sorts of errr evil spells. Draco, are you sure that we can’t break into the manor? We did before.”
Draco thinks The Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes multicolored storefront and interactive window display is gaudy. The twins don’t care; whenever he mentions it, they counter that he has the world’s tackiest tattoo so his opinion doesn’t count.
“Ohhhhh there’s still plenty of time to celebrate. Besides that’s not the point. The point is that I remembered. You said I wouldn’t, and I did.”
Draco screws his eyes tighter and hopes for a deeper darkness than the one he’s currently suspended in. He wants to pull his entire consciousness through the white spots behind his eyelids so he can enjoy this moment without its double: the rush of thoughts about how if he lets Potter any closer he’ll see Draco. He’ll realize how gross Draco is, how raw. Draco’s unfit, impure, damaged, fake, perverse. The only thing he’s good at is coming up with synonyms for
Ginny explodes. “They’re not spying! They’re not! I mean they are, but not like that. Oh my god, look, we’re dating. Me and Pan. Dating. We’ve been dating for almost 7 months now, and I’m happy and I trust them, and if you would just get your head out of your ass and
Harry snorts. “No, you don’t. Ah— I mean that’s sweet, thank you. But no, that’s ok. It’s not really necessary. I … might have blinded my Uncle.”
“What the fuck Potter — you left her alone? Right after she learned to stand?” Draco says, bounding out of the room at the top of the stairs and making a beeline for the kitchen. They hear the crash on the way there.
“You look like shit. Anybody that sees you is going to think you haven’t discovered showers yet, not that you’ve just finished killing a megalomaniac.”
“A little to the left,” Hermione says. “No, the other left. You’re a quidditch player. Shouldn’t you know which way left is?”
“Before you say anything, I need you to know I only have like five minutes to talk. Astoria’s causing a scene at breakfast right now so I can use Slughorn’s floo, but we both know
“Sorry. I know this can’t be easy for you to see,” Potter says, tender and understanding when Draco needs hardness. Draco is a feeling creature right now, not a thinking one, and it’s safer if those feelings are anger.
“I need another Merlin’s Ass for Pansy,” he says. Draco turns away from him to grab a bottle, and the sudden loss of his attention is shocking. “AndDoYouWantToJoinOurTeam?”
Draco crosses to the other side of the room and says to the wall, “Go check the shop. I’ll be up in a moment. I need to … write a letter to Molly and Arthur.”
“Open up, Malfoy! I know you’re there.” Are they on good enough terms for him to add, “You have to be there; you’re on house arrest”? They’ve only been talking since March, when Narcissa owled him from her deathbed:
“Hmmmmm,” Luna hums into his palm. Dean smiles timidly, his eyes large and focused only on her. Draco’s irrationally angry that something so nauseatingly sweet is probably going to save them.
Bellatrix removes her wand from Draco’s side. He falls forward, not able to support his own weight. She spits something small and fleshy at him, cracks something underneath her foot. Part of his ear, and his wand, he realizes.
“Fred and George can’t afford to hire anyone to test out their products, so they make people they know do it as payment for being allowed in the workshop,” Draco explains. “And they like to photograph it because they’re mean, ludicrous people.”
breathing patterns. You’ve been out for 14 hours, you know, and you weren’t in bad shape to begin with so, up and at ‘em. Lots of things to do today.”
Abstractly, it fascinates him. The train has several charms woven into its engine; it’s the prototype for most of Arthur’s inventions, and, by extension, most of Draco’s. Plus, everyone uses it — minus Ron and Potter that one time. It’s concrete proof that, under the right circumstances, wizarding society is willing to embrace magic-mechanical hybrids.
Ginny had to come out to Draco twice, something he still maintains is more her fault than it is his. Like war, coming out is all about dramatics, presentation, timing. She had chosen to do it while taking refuge from a rain storm in the barn one Sunday the summer before her fifth year. Draco had been installing a radio in the Ford, his brain as staticky as the signal he kept getting.
“I didn’t mean to. It was accidental magic. We were at the zoo, and there was a python, and I asked it to deal with my Uncle. I didn’t think it would. But the glass disappeared and it escaped and bit my Uncle twice, once on each eye.”
He’s not selfless the way the Weasleys are. But he tries to be; he’s spent the majority of the past few years trying and he can’t ever get there, but he can at least pretend he does.
