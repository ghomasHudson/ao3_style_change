Potter scoffs, his face twisting, before he grits his teeth together, evidently to keep himself from lashing out, Draco reckons. He’s quite enjoying the conversation so far.
Harry frowns, knowing that they’d better find something soon to eliminate the threat. There are too many people who
Potter stands up, a small smile on his lips as he glances at Draco. Potter gives Draco a once over, and Draco feels his throat working a couple of more times than necessary as a result.
Albus thinks with mild annoyance. He watches absently as his brother, his cousin Fred and their friend Jordan howl in laughter, while their classmates sit next to them, shaking their heads with amusement. Bitterness flares in the bottom of his stomach as he thinks how his brother had managed to screw things up for him.
Albus presses his teeth together, feeling angry, feeling betrayed. The unfairness of the situation is making his stomach roil. He moves his gaze away from his brother. Because he might take a swing at him.
Harry blinks at her, feeling resigned and angered at the same time. “I’m not the one who spends half of their holidays in
Potter thinks kindly of his son, and he knows that Auror Quinn will report everything to his boss nevertheless, he gives Potter a curt nod. “No. Go ahead.”
“Apparently, someone told the Aurors that you were fighting with Travers in the train, alone.” Albus tells Scorpius quietly, as they walk towards the Entrance Hall.
Scorpius nods, walking into the room without even glancing at his father or Harry. Malfoy follows him and looks at Harry for a split second, right as he walks past him.
Potter is quiet for a bit before he replies, rather tightly, “Ginny’s not staying in the village. She’ll come straight to the school for the questionings.”
exactly he was apologising for. That had helped to make Scorpius relax a bit. But now, Albus is wondering if Scorpius is still distressed about something.
Harry doesn’t know what to think anymore. He puts his glasses on the table in front of him and presses the heels of his palms against his eyes, trying to sort out his thoughts.
There’s a collective gasp and then – several people start to scream in shock, and even more people jump to their feet, their wands at the ready, many voices shouting over each other with panic-laced voices.
Albus can see a vein ticking in their father’s temple, as the man keeps grinding his teeth together in order to not explode in rage.
Neither the Scott sisters nor Westen had anything to do with what happened to Travers. But, as all three girls were close to the victim, Harry thinks there could be something else, some small detail they didn’t know to ask, and the girls didn’t know to tell. Miss Westen hadn’t mentioned the row in the train corridor during her first questioning. During her second, she had told Harry that she hadn’t thought it was important, and thus had left the occurrence unmentioned. Today, Westen told him that she
Mrs Scott sighs disappointedly, Mr Westen shakes his head in dissatisfaction, but Mrs Westen, at least, gives Harry an understanding nod. “Of course, Auror Potter,” she says, glancing at her fellow parents. “We just have to trust that our children are safe, under the protection of the Auror Office, as well as the school teachers,” she says pointedly, aiming her words at her husband and Mrs Scott – who both seem to calm down a bit.
As the parents leave the Entrance Hall, Harry lets out a long breath, and walks to the front doors, stepping outside. He breathes in the cold air, hoping it will clear his head. His mind is working furiously, putting together what he knows and what he has observed, moving the pieces to their correct spots in the timeline.
“ – Or someone who doesn’t go to this school,” Cecil murmurs, watching Julian’s face intently to take any hints, as said classmate who is one of the fifth year prefects, stands rigidly in front of the teachers' table and listens the instructions from Slughorn.
There’s a short silence, before Harry speaks, “Aurors Peele, Prone, Higgins, Bletchley, Walter, Parkinson, Bones and Smith will be stationed in the school during the night, patrolling the common rooms and corridors.”
with him? Why would James’s words make his insides sizzling like that? Why? Albus is frustrated, is enraged, is confused.
Quinn doesn’t say more to the subject, and continues to ask a couple of more questions about the train ride, before Albus is released. His parents want to talk with him, and Albus knows it is only about his history with Jenna and about the fame-seeking students, so he shrugs them off, telling them he needs to go to his dorm to get his books before lunch and his afternoon classes.
“The Aurors have been called to investigate the matter. I do not know much, yet. I do not know if there are other people associated with the incident. All I know, is that the safest place for everyone is here, in this school, in this hall. Stay put, and do not panic,” McGonagall says sternly.
He realises Potter is waiting for him to answer. If Draco has visited the place after he had attended the school?
“Yes.” Draco grunts, and with a curt nod, Potter walks up the rest of the stairs, dragging Draco with him by his hand.
Quinn clears his throat loudly. “Sir.” He says tightly, interrupting Harry. Even Ginny’s staring at Harry in disbelief.
McGonagall watches the students gravely. “There has been an incident in the train. A girl…a girl has been found dead – “
“Secondly – is that why I’m being questioned? Because I dated her four months ago?” He asks, gritting his teeth, thinking spitefully that the Aurors should then probably question the whole school if that was the reason.
“Don’t bother, James,” Albus says firmly, swallowing hard. He doesn’t want that – that blame – he doesn’t want to be a reason for something, whatever it is. He shakes his head, feeling his eyes stinging. “Don’t do anything for my benefit.”
Draco stares back numbly, wondering what the bloody hell has his son done? This is a fucking nightmare, he decides.
James throws a glare at him. “Nothing, because she doesn’t know,” James growls, his knuckles whitening against the pan he’s holding in his hands. “And she will never know. It was a fucking mistake. Do you understand?” He says, a threatening glint in his eyes.
James looks ahead, at the white courtyard, at the untouched snow in front of them. “Yeah.” He says quietly, a small frown between his brows. “Don’t know if there’ll be a future for us…”
“There’s a Locking Spell…but…I cannot detect any Unlocking Charms,” Potter states, glancing at Draco.
“Peele and Prone, you patrol the school corridors, while Bones, Smith, Keir, Quinn and myself will start questioning prefects, the Head Boy and Girl, as well as the late Miss Travers’ boyfriend,” Harry says, and then gives the Aurors more specific instructions about who will be questioning prefects from which house.
“I’ll be sending our new crime scene investigator there, to the scene,” she says, and her face becomes even more strained.
know it had been important, but, as her friend’s sister – Pamela Scott – had asked both her sister and Westen not to say anything about it, claiming Albus would’ve been in trouble, Westen had promised to not say anything about it.
The question had come out of the blue, and Albus had quickly disregarded the sudden feeling of apprehension, telling himself and Scorpius that that wasn’t the case. But it had been. After Scorpius had left back to Wiltshire, Albus had watched his parents, had listened their conversations when they thought no one else was in the room. And he had realised what was happening between his parents. He had felt…betrayed. They had been planning it, agreeing to keep it between them, to lie to Albus, James and Lily.
According to Scorpius, he had talked with Travers on the train, where she had threatened to spread rumours about Scorpius and Albus being… well, more than friends – which doesn’t make any sense to Harry. The two of them have never appeared to be interested in each other romantically, at least not in front of Harry. Why had Travers even made such a threat? Scorpius had told Quinn, that he had no idea why Travers had said such things, but Harry can’t stop feeling that perhaps Scorpius knows exactly what the reason behind Travers’s threat was. Did Scorpius feel threatened by something else the deceased girl knew? Would that have been enough for Scorpius to act? To harm her?
Draco’s jaw clenches, as he thinks how the witch had made his son a suspect simply by lying to the Aurors.
Scorpius listens quietly, seeming almost relieved to not be taking part in the conversation, and only looks somewhat amused as Albus tells the others a very colourful version of their New Year’s party. Well,
Scorpius looks a bit stunned, but then his expression clears into an indifferent one. “How kind of him,” he says, his voice polite, but the meaning behind his words not as so.
“James. Come here,” Harry says and gestures for James to sit next to Ginny, before taking the seat on James’s other side.
He shoves one of the sandwiches down, as he starts to scribble down the report, occasionally glancing through his notes.
Quinn gives Albus a thoughtful look, and is silent for a moment. “Why do you think your brother invited her there? To the party?”
“May I suggest that you carry out the questioning in the offices of the Head of House? Meanwhile, I would like to keep one of your Aurors in each house common room, just in case,” McGonagall says.
Potter nods, glancing behind him at the door, a calculating look in his eyes. “I wonder…” Potter mutters, and then stands up to wave his wand towards the door, to inspect the magic placed upon it.
“All right, then. Get out of here, before you get too smug for your own good,” Harry says good-naturedly.
Their father looks from Albus to James and back, his brow creased. “Why didn’t you tell me that you dated her?” He asks again.
I've written already a lot, but I need to tweak it somewhat before I can post (to get all the mysterious little details in!).
Harry gives a nod to the Headmistress. “If there is nothing else, I will head up to the Gryffindor Tower to inform James that he too will be questioned under Veritaserum tomorrow,” Harry says wearily.
Albus sits alone on the side of a silent courtyard, listening the distant voices of laughter, chatter, and goodbyes. Many parents have stopped by at the school to see their children, after the Headmistress cancelled the lessons for the day. He reckons that what went on the last three days, had been quite stressful, for many people – the students, their parents, the teachers – and that it was probably only sensible to let everyone take a moment before resuming to normal.
And that itself is enough to tell Albus that something is bothering his friend. Based on his past experiences, Albus has proved to be rather good at reading Scorpius. He knows there’s something Scorpius is not telling, but he reckons that his friend will talk to him about it eventually.
Harry splutters slightly, glares at the bird that is long gone from his sight, and sits down at the kitchen table, tearing the letter open with trembling fingers, somewhat dreading what Draco has written to him.
Albus lifts his brows at Quinn. “Scorpius told me.” He then sees Quinn looking at his notes again. “Why? What did Scorpius say to you?” Albus asks with suspicion.
Harry stares at Albus, not really knowing what to do, or what to say. He had suspected that Albus’s and Scorpius’s relationship had been something more than a friendly one, but in the end, he had thrown away those suspicions, thinking that it had been a mere lie on Scorpius’s part. And apparently, it had been.
Draco doesn’t even know how to take Potter’s explanation. Sure, Weasley knowing is not something Draco had been wishing, since, well, probably her whole family knows by now, and as it is the Weasley family, Draco does not have high hopes for discretion. But…Potter doesn’t seem to – to regret it, does he?
Draco arches a brow at him, forcing himself to not let his eyes drop down to Potter’s outstretched wand. “How kind of you to point it out, Potter,” He hisses, and then takes in Potter’s mixed look of anger and confusion and realises something. “Didn’t our beaver-toothed boss tell you I’d be here?”
“So, the wards were not breached by outsiders,” Potter says expressionlessly. “Neither the driver nor the trolley lady saw anything out of ordinary.”
Moonstone gives the bloke a small smile. “Thank you for that, Mr Riley,” he says, before lifting a brow at Harry. “Would you like to ask anything else?” Moonstone asks from Harry, evidently meaning for Harry to speed the fuck up, since Riley starts to look rather worn out by the questioning.
Harry nods, “Then I will inform Quinn that he should proceed with questioning our sons tomorrow,” he says unenthusiastically, and stands up. Malfoy follows his example. “Um. I’ll talk to you later…back in the village,” Harry mutters, feeling quite uneasy, and out of his skin.
“Those things alone make you closer to the girl than most of the students here,” their father states.
Harry tries to give him a reassuring smile, but Malfoy’s expressionless face doesn’t falter, and then he too has disappeared into the room.
Scorpius shakes his head. “No. I told Albus I wanted to be by myself, and I went to search an empty compartment, where I stayed for the rest of the trip. I saw Albus at the carriages the next time.”
He sighs, casting another warming charm around him. He only wants to be alone. He doesn’t want to go to enjoy the day without school, doesn’t want to go to say goodbye to his mum or dad. He wants the day to be over, and the next. And the one after that.
A group of girls leaves the common room, towards their dormitories, and they are followed by a handful of boys.
Albus digests his words. “Because she thinks that? Because you think that?” He asks, not really sure if he’s ready to hear James’s answer.
After the encounter in the corridor, Scorpius had stayed away from Albus for the rest of the ride. It wasn’t until they had reached Hogsmeade, that Albus had found his friend at the carriages, looking grim. Albus had apologised, even though he wasn’t sure
Albus stops in his tracks, and glances around him; the hall is empty. The classroom where Albus and the others were questioned by the Aurors in the middle of the hall is now closed, and Albus reckons the voices carry to the hall from one of the rooms around the corner.
Harry clenches his jaw, knowing he has no business to question Albus himself. He gives Quinn a sharp nod, staying silent.
His father lets out a long breath. “Was that the only thing? Not –” He trails a hand through his hair, a bit frustrated, “Not that it wasn’t the wrong thing to do to you, not that you don’t have the right to be angry about it.” He adds quickly, and continues, “I just…I’d like to know if there was something else…?” He speaks, almost silently.
“What about the cause of death?” Potter asks firmly, murmuring a similar spell than Draco had to his shoes before stepping into the compartment.
“It appears I need you to question my niece as well, Quinn,” Potter says quietly, watching Quinn with a weary look.
Albus arches a brow at him. Why would Scorpius act like this when his father is mentioned? Is he afraid to see him? “Your father? Isn’t he the Crime Scene Investigator?”
Albus’s mind spins. He wonders, why Scorpius is being questioned? If the Aurors didn’t know that Albus talked – or rowed, more like – with Travers and Riley, then surely they don’t know about Scorpius’s involvement either.
Albus watches as his mother leaves through the front doors in the Entrance Hall, his stomach twisting nervously. He’s going to be questioned under Veritaserum the next day, and even though he has nothing to hide – at least regarding Travers – he can’t stop feeling worried.
Harry is met with a similar welcome than in the Slytherin common room, if not a bit louder, as Rose, Roxanne, Lucy, Molly and Louis all attack Harry with hugs and anxious questions. He manages to calm everyone down, and listens as Lucy – who is a fifth-year Prefect – starts to explain the questioning she went through, and sees how Molly becomes even more nervous, as she hasn’t yet been to Flitwick’s office with Auror Keir.
“We’ll see, won’t we,” Harry says sternly. “Perhaps it couldn’t hurt if you stayed here until the morning,” he adds, and then walks towards the door.
He turns and gives James; who looks mildly disappointed, a small smile. “I’ll see you in the morning, James,” he says, voice softer now.
Albus processes his words. “And if I didn’t? If I wasn’t hurt? Would you have regretted it?” He asks blankly, his eyes moving over James’s anguished face.
Moonstone clears his throat behind them. “Miss Westen and Mr Woods – the prefects who found Jenna, and who were also her close friends – informed us that the door had been closed but unlocked,” Moonstone says slowly, a deep frown between his brows. “They saw no one else there.”
Fungbury volunteers to patrol the village through the night, when Harry informs that both him and Berrycloth are not needed there during the night. With that, Harry and Berrycloth make their way into the pub, to meet Malfoy.
Hermione purses her lips. “Well – yes. And no.” she admits, looks away, and then gives him a sympathetic look. “Ginny. She, um, told her family…It was last spring, a dinner at the Burrow, before the thing between Mark and her began. Only, she didn’t mention the bit about Malfoy. Only that something had happened between you and someone else,” she explains, and then gives Harry a sad look, “It was when you decided you’d get a divorce.”
Quinn nods slowly. “Why do you say Miss Travers was talking,” he glances at his notes, “rubbish, about you to Scorpius, when you found them?”
And then, something heavy and unpleasant drops in his stomach, as he realises something else. What James had heard Travers say on the train, implicates that she knew Harry was single and possibly looking for a partner. He thinks, if Albus had known about his parents’ separation, and told Travers about it.
Albus quickly steps back, a shield charm already in place as James jumps up and a mere second later, throws a hex at him, roaring at the same time.
Keir and Quinn trudge behind him, murmuring quietly as they approach the school. Harry left Berrycloth, Fungbury and Ron to the station and Hogsmeade. His friend was not pleased, but understood that he could not really provide them help in taking statements at Hogwarts, as he was no longer officially an Auror – and Harry insisted that he would be most useful at the village, which he knows like the back of his hand. Harry still promised Ron to check up on his children. And his brothers’ children. Which Harry thinks will probably take at least an hour, since there are so many of them.
going to question Potter’s sons as well. So, perhaps he is the best. Still, Draco cannot stop the unease crawling into the bottom of his stomach.
McGonagall gives him a strained smile. “Auror Potter, why don’t you take a seat with us – I believe we all would like to hear an update about the situation.”
“None of them, nor the two students we questioned yesterday under Veritaserum; Nate Riley and Pamela Scott, had any knowledge, of what had happened to Jenna Travers – nor did they have anything to do with her death. All of them confirmed it, under Veritaserum. In addition, all of them confirmed that they did not know of anyone else, who would have had anything to do with Travers’s death,” Harry explains to the twelve blank faces.
James is lying on the floor, with his left arm twisting into a very weird and definitely painful direction, blinking through tears of pain. Albus, however, stands there, in the middle of the hallway, breathing heavily, his wand at the ready, his lip bleeding but otherwise intact.
He looks out of the window at the softly flickering snow, the glimmering white grounds, and then shakes his head sharply. “The second solution, the more…complex one, it fits,” He says with a small nod to the crowd. “It fits with the facts.”
“Traumatic brain injury,” Draco says, pointing a finger at the wound in the girl’s head. “No damage, bruising or wounds elsewhere.” He flicks his wand a couple of more times before adding, “Time of death appears to be approximately two to three hours ago.”
Malfoy doesn’t continue, so Harry speaks about his sons, hoping it would help Malfoy to open up to him a bit more, thinking it would help the blonde Slytherin, as Harry is quite certain Malfoy hasn’t spoken to anyone about him and his son.
“You do make a good team, after all,” Hermione says slowly, her mouth curving up slightly. “I did have my doubts.”
Harry paces in front of the classroom in the Entrance Hall, waiting for his Aurors to step inside, to go over the situation, to try to make sense of the slim evidence they’ve got. Both Quinn and Smith are already there, having been questioning students with Harry since this morning, both standing rigidly in place, and not minding one bit that their boss is moving there, with an anxious expression, huffing occasional words under his breath.
Naturally he’d thought about the scar-headed man before the pub, but had always dismissed those thoughts almost immediately. Draco doesn’t usually waste his thoughts on unavailable people, except, apparently when he has lowered his guard due to an excessive amount of alcohol.
And possibly, James already knew when he went after Scorpius. And if James knew then, Albus isn’t sure if he knows his brother at all.
Potter follows him upstairs as they go towards their rooms, but before they reach the first landing, Potter takes Draco’s hand, stopping them both in the middle of dimly lit stairs.
Scorpius nods, “Yes, I spent my holiday with them. Mr Potter took us to the train, and then, Albus and I went to sit with our friends, Julian and Cecil, in their compartment.”
Harry watches him closely. “And you? Were you different?” He asks, not unkindly, but trying to picture the situation, knowing that how Scorpius was when his mother lived, was different from how the boy seems to be now, but knowing that a large part of it is being a teenager.
“I told her that I’m sorry for how my cousin had acted. I told her I could lend her some books, if needed – as I had some of them in my trunk.”
Albus’s eyes flick over to Julian, who is the only one left in their dorm, save for Scorpius and Albus, and is in the middle of rummaging his trunk.
“Why do you think Miss Scott thought you needed protection? Why would she lie and tell us that you weren’t there?” Quinn asks, watching Albus carefully.
“Did you know that it stopped when our sons became friends?” Malfoy asks, his eyes searching Harry’s. “That after everyone had seen the paper, or heard that the Chosen One and his children were associating with the Malfoys and were in friendly terms, the rumours stopped?”
“Why is he being questioned again tomorrow, under Veritaserum?” Draco asks, watching Potter and Quinn with an expressionless look, while knowing exactly why. He
Three months ago, Albus wasn’t laughing at that. Not that he is laughing now. He had thought it was different, that
Draco doesn’t think that neither James nor Albus had anything to do with Miss Travers’s death. They would’ve reached out to their father for help. He knows them – well, Albus, more like – well enough to make the presumption. He can only hope his own son would act similarly and come to him in a tight situation. But he unfortunately knows Scorpius well too. Draco would probably be the last person Scorpius would ask help from. Well, perhaps Lucius is, Draco thinks ruefully.
Draco blinks, momentarily speechless, reminded of another time, another night; the last time he talked with Potter. The last time he saw that innocent, sincere look in his eyes. He swallows hard and forces those memories to somewhere deep in his mind, allowing the envy and indifference to surface. He has always had mixed feelings regarding Potter, and only understood them after he had reached adulthood, long after he had married Astoria.
Albus nods. “She told me when I confronted her. After I demanded her to tell me why had she lied to the Aurors.”
Harry smiles tightly and turns back towards his son, to see Albus and Scorpius, and a handful of others watching him with anxious and curious looks.
She leaves, and Harry stays alone in the quiet classroom, for quite some time, going over the case in his mind, before Quinn and Smith return, followed by Ginny, Professor Slughorn, and Albus.
“Anything I can help you with?” Moonstone asks, taking a sip himself after taking his seat behind his desk.
However, the desire is still tingling in his groin, not lessened by the sudden wave of pain. He gives his lap a rueful look, before surrendering into his need, the craving and longing that have filled his chest not disappearing as Harry presses the heel of his palm against his prick.
. The rage inside Albus also makes him perhaps a bit ill-mannered, as he reaches Scorpius’s bed with a couple of long strides, grabs the book and throws it forcefully across the room, before turning back to his friend, fuming, his fingers curling into tight fists that he barely can hold against his sides. He wants to throttle Scorpius so badly it nearly makes him dizzy.
He is followed by Parkinson; a young man who trained in the Academy with Peele, along with his partner; Walter.
Albus frowns ahead, bewildered. Why does Scorpius sound so…anxious? Why does he need to talk to James? Albus listens attentively, feeling like a complete stalker as he leans against the wall around the corner, close to the classroom, the door of which has apparently been left open.
“Yeah,” Cory says slowly, his eyes lingering on Albus’s face. “Said he wasn’t feeling well,” he continues quietly. “How was it? The thing? You okay?”
“Good morning, Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter,” Fox says steadily, his sharp gaze moving between them. “I believe we have the same direction?” Albus and Scorpius stare at him blankly. “To see the Headmistress?” Fox adds.
Cory narrows his eyes at Cecil. “Unlikely. The train doesn’t take in outsiders. There are wards to prevent that sort of thing…”
But we need more information. We need to show that Rose is innocent, as well as find out if she has seen anything that could help us solve the case,” Harry says promptly. “You know this, Hermione,” he adds softly.
“I’m sorry,” Potter finally says, moving his gaze to Draco, who feels a small twitch in the back of his neck for being under the intense stare of the pair of bright green eyes.
Albus shakes his head, giving his father an incredulous look. “I know. I was with him then. And I believe
Scorpius moves his eyes quickly away from James and glances at his friend. “Yeah. Sure, mate.” He mutters.
Potter looks away, his brows twitching. “Sure.” He says and then nods his head at the door in the middle, on the right side of the hallway. “It’s that one,” he continues, and then gives Draco a strained smile before moving past him, towards the end of the hallway.
“We should head upstairs,” Potter mutters then, looking away. “I need to be at the school before breakfast to talk to the Headmistress…”
“Merlin,” Potter groans, placing the book back on the table before trailing a hand through his hair, worry flickering into those weary green eyes.
Potter gapes at him, then moves his gaze away, evidently in his mind going through the events during the holiday.
Scorpius’s jaw tightens. “We’ll just tell them what happened; she bothered me about you, you told her and Riley to sod off,” he says tensely.
Draco’s eyes flicker to Granger, who looks mildly surprised and moves her gaze away from the two men. He looks back at Potter and nods, thinking the Auror has most likely figured out that Draco is still peeved about the New Year’s and wants to apologise for it.
Draco quickly looks away and distracts himself with his notes, while the rest of the Aurors mutter their goodnights and leave.
“Miss Travers’s death was both an unfortunate accident and the result of a careless use of sedative potions,” Harry continues, his voice now sharper, making everyone fall silent once more. “She fell, unable to control her body after taking three vials of Calming Draught, and hit her head to the edge of the bench in her compartment. The blow to the head caused a massive blood loss and a traumatic brain injury. Had someone been there with her – as Miss Travers had been barely conscious after she fell and incapable of summoning help – we wouldn’t be here today.” Harry speaks solemnly.
have a motive. Revenge…protecting himself or his best friend by making sure Travers was unable to fulfil her threats,” Harry tells Quinn, chewing the inside of his cheek.
Hermione tells Harry that they need him for the statement, and then says her goodbyes to Draco, telling him that she will be expecting a full report on her desk next morning. Draco merely nods at her.
Potter mentioned, would be their boss, and what exactly the lovely Mrs Granger-Weasley had said to Potter. He takes in a calming breath before glancing at Potter, a blank look in his eyes. “Surely, as the Head Auror, you are more than capable to focus on the job, Potter, and not who you are paired with,” he says icily.
Potter then takes Weasley to the side to take a look at the book – his daughter’s book – and possibly to explain they will question the girl today.
Albus and James glance at each other, before sitting down. However, their father doesn’t. Instead, he starts pacing behind his chair.
Quinn glances at his notes. “You think James’s actions were not acceptable, even after what Travers had done to his brother?”
The barrel turns into a narrow and low passage going upwards. Harry nods at Quinn and Higgins before they enter, one behind the other, ending up into the cosy and round common room decorated with bright yellow and black and with several tables and chairs here and there as well as with plants and flowers hanging from the walls and the ceiling.
His father looks stunned again, and then demands that Albus explains everything that occurred during the train ride. Albus does, although he decides to leave out how weirdly Scorpius has acted since, as it might not have anything to do with what happened to Travers, even though the small voice inside Albus’s head kind of tells him otherwise.
When Zachary and Cory – who had both stayed at the school for the holidays – snigger as they explain every amusing event that took place there; how sozzled some of the teachers were at Christmas dinner and how they tried to hide it from the students, how they managed to beat a group of sixth and seventh-years in a
Harry closes his eyes and lets out a long breath. He thinks about the previous night in the compartment. He thinks about drinking the potions, remembers the feeling of lightness surrounding him. He remembers the darkness, the emptiness and the blood, he remembers Draco’s face: horrified, panicked, looming over him in the compartment. He remembers waking up in the hospital wing some hours after it had happened.
Harry is relieved, but at the same time, puzzled and distressed regarding James. What was his son thinking? James is happily together with Charlotte, soon to be engaged, if Harry has understood correctly. James is also soon to be picked into one of the teams in the Quidditch league, where, Harry thinks with regret, being gay would definitely not be tolerated. James could lose the contract if it would come into public knowledge that he’s seeing men. Harry is grateful, however, that his eldest has a strong alibi, and that James’s questioning under Veritaserum had gone as Harry had both hoped and expected – since it seems that James would have had the best motive of all the students they have questioned.
“For Merlin’s sake!” Potter exclaims, standing up with a huff. He walks towards the side table, presumably to pour himself a stiff drink but lets out a disappointed grunt when he finds only Butterbeer.
Albus arches a brow at him, knowing that there could quite well be ‘some stuff with his dad’, as there always seems to be, but this time he
A short, uneven breath leaves Malfoy’s lips. “What are you doing, Potter?” Malfoy asks with a blank look, unable to hide the roughness in his voice. He doesn’t move away.
Harry blinks at him, the haziness filled by hunger and lust slightly dissipating, and glances around them, both frustrated and confused that Malfoy wants to talk about that
The book moves to the centre of the table, and opens, displaying the inscription Draco showed Potter less than hour ago. Draco watches silently as Potter sets his jaw and takes a deep breath.
They watch the crowd on the other side of the hall in silence, as their boss nods rapidly at the Minister for Magic while two of his secretaries write down each word. There are likely putting up a statement for the press. They watch at Mr and Mrs Travers who discuss with the Headmistress in the corner, looking both detached from the people surrounding them and overcome by grief. They watch and acknowledge, as one by one, the Aurors come to say their goodbyes to Harry, before returning to their homes and the Ministry.
Riley starts to explain the events, from the moment he stepped on the train, to the moment he met his girlfriend; during which he chokes down a sob. He continues after a moment to describe how he spent time with his other friends – Harry asks what the time was then, and if it was closer to Hogsmeade or London. Riley tells him that he
“That’s fine. Harry can sleep in his tank like always.” Dudley replied with his mouth full of sausage.
By the time Harry shifted and they went back out to the others Dudley’s parents were gone. The man explained that they had decided to go back home and that they would be returned to their house after shopping. He also informed them that his name was Severus Snape and that he was a teacher at Hogwarts.
Though his scar, he thought, was the worst of all. It sat rather proudly on the left side of his forehead, taking up most of it, and looked like a burst of silvery white lightning that even ran down his nose and refused to conform to the rest of his chestnut skin tone. To his misfortune both of these oddities were still present in his snake form, his scar being even more pronounced against his reddish orange scales that looked like fire than on his chestnut skin. It certainly didn't help that his hair refused to cover the cursed thing no matter how long it got and seemed almost personally offended when Harry would try to force it to do so, sticking out even more with renewed static from his hands coursing through the strands and encouraged their defiance.
Looking down slowly he finally understood why his mother was making such a fuss so early in the morning. Apparently at some point in the middle of the night Harry had shifted into his snake form. His reddish orange scales looked like burning fire as the snake slept which deeply contrasted the white breaks in them that his scar made across his face. Dudley found himself oddly transfixed by the deformity and fought the urge to stroke it. Thankfully both of his hands were currently stuck under the younger boy.
Both were made of old leather and bound with ropes on their spines. The top one was dark green and had an odd round snake insignia on it. Harry absentmindedly thought the poor thing was trying to eat itself. He shifted them around as best he could, careful to clutch the envelope in his other hand, and saw that the second book was a deep red color. He squinted at the cover barely being able to make out the swirling patterns on it that seemed to connect to some sort of flower. He quickly made a mental note to ask Aunt Petunia what kind it was when they returned home before he set the books on the bench beside him. He then tore open the smaller envelope before he even fully registered that he had moved to find it didn’t contain just one piece of paper like he had originally expected but multiple.
Alright so I know this was longer than normal, between work and writing on my days off, plus other stuff. It took forever to get out!!
Harry didn’t bother replying and decided instead to move out from under the pillow and curl up near Dudley’s form as he fell into the sweet embrace of slumber. He didn’t really like sleeping out in the open, but he figured it showed that he had Dudley’s back since he was faster than the other in case the adults tried anything during the night.
“Not really, just a reducio and engorgio charm combination, an extension charm and some atmospheric charms for the inside.”
Dudley had been so intent on listening past the door that he hadn’t realized Harry had made his way onto his lap until he felt the other on his lap. Deciding to give the snake his full attention and ignore the conversation outside, Dudley saw that Harry had changed the color of his scales from his normal fire tones to a milky white that seemed to perfectly match the tiles under them. He could swear he saw a darker cream color still peeking out from the very back of his cousin's head but quickly decided it was just a trick of the light instead of making things awkward.
Would you rather I put them out as I finish or write ahead a chapter or two then post the one y'all need to read?
Unfortunately, when he asked her why he could change into a snake she just sneered at him and told him it was a repulsive family trait that he got from his mother. Which made his Uncle pipe up that his father wasn’t much better since he was a damn binder. He still wasn’t sure how his father was a stationary item but had just chalked his Uncle’s words up to him being too dumb to comprehend what the adult actually meant.
They decided to head to Gringotts before getting food so that Harry and Dudley could help pay for some of it. Harry thought that at least the bank would have some semblance of normalcy but he was soon proven wrong. There were no service desks with people, well there were, but they had goblins behind them. There were a lot more goblins than he had thought possible, and all of them kept staring at him and whispering about him being a prince or a protector. Snape and Dudley both sent confused glances down to the medium sized creatures only to be ignored. While Harry just tried to tune it out as much as possible and pushed down the urge to change forms. It was too bright here, he wasn’t used to being in sunlight so much, and all of the loud noise vibrations were hurting his jaw and over sensitizing him. He felt like he had a massive headache from all of it and he really wanted to hide. He knew he couldn’t though because he had to get his school things so he ignored the pain and followed Snape to the main service desk.
Dudley watched with an awkward smile as Harry tilted his head in an inquisitive manner and flicked his tongue out.
The letters followed them from his glass tank in the cupboard under the stairs, to the motel two towns over and finally to a rickety shack in the middle of a swamp that Uncle Vernon had somehow found. The letters outshone the fact that it was now his birthday. He wasn’t surprised though since his birthday is forgotten every year. The only good thing about them leaving the house abruptly to escape the letters was that no one had thought to load his tank with them, so he was free to roam around the room in his skin. It only took Dudley seconds to realize that the most integral piece of their lives was missing once Vernon had announced that there were only two beds.
Once he was sure everyone else fell asleep Harry got two of the letters he had managed to snag from the air and shove in his pockets before they left. He winced when he felt Dudley sit beside him and expected a blow to the head only for him to whisper hastily to get on with it. Both of them held their breath in anticipation as Harry handed one to his cousin, and they opened them at the same time.
“What the bloody hell are you talking about? This thing clearly says your name and not mine! I’m not like you. Stop making fun of me Harry!” Dudley whispered loudly.
“How dare you do that to my husband! Change him back immediately and leave! You have absolutely no business being around us!”
Snape turned towards them and eyed them expectedly. Harry wasn’t sure if they were supposed to leave or explain that the locket was for Dudley for some reason. He didn’t have time to ask before Dudley was pulling him along to go peruse the shop, who had apparently picked up on the social cues that the professor was trying to impress upon them before he could. His cousin drug him all the way to the back of the store to look around without so much as a second glance. There was even more weird stuff in the back like jewelry boxes that glowed and metal eyes on locks that followed you.
But based on Weasley’s behaviour last night, Draco knows he ought not to relay on wishful thinking on the incident being truly forgotten.
The hall is filled with anxious voices, whispers, murmurs, silent crying, nervous shifting and frightened gazes. The prefects from each house, all twenty-four of them quickly make their way to the front, towards the Headmistress and most of the professors.
“Did you see anyone as you left her compartment? Did you see anyone walking towards, or into Travers’s compartment?” Quinn asks calmly.
Harry thinks, swallowing deeply. Something incredible happened, something, he hadn’t even thought could be possible. He shakes his head. “No.”
Their holiday wasn’t the most brilliant one, at least nothing like last year. But it wasn’t that bad.
He thinks of Hermione and Ron, their distressed expressions, the gratitude in their eyes as they told Draco how incredibly thankful they were that Harry was okay, and that Draco had helped him. He remembers their shocked looks when Draco informed them with a crisp tone that Harry had decided to perform an experiment that nearly cost his life.
Albus seethes, taking a couple of steps back from Scorpius’s bed, fighting the urge to punch Scorpius into his stupid, pure-blooded, straight, perfect nose. “Oh, fuck, indeed,” Albus growls, leaning his back against the bedpost of his own bed next to Scorpius’s.
Draco contemplates Potter’s words. Finally, he has the confirmation to what he has been wondering, after hearing Weasley’s outburst about Potter being single, as well as Potter’s earlier confession about him and Weasley having problems.
“Is there anything else that happened during the trip? Or anything else you would like to add?” Harry asks.
“Oh, I haven’t, trust me,” James says, a smug and knowing look in his expression, as if he’s realised something.
“Ginny and I…we’re getting a divorce,” He says quietly, fixing his eyes at the floor. “What we have –
Hermione shakes her head. “Apparently the girl’s friends found her in the compartment. No one was there, and nothing out of ordinary happened during the train ride, according to them.”
“Of course, you do. Why would you let the Aurors do their jobs?” Potter says sharply. “Should’ve known this is what she meant,” He continues, grumbling under his breath.
?” Potter, one of the two Aurors, asks, and when Draco stands up and turns to give him and the other one an unimpressed look, he continues, “This is a crime scene! You have no permission to be here!” He shouts, lifting his wand towards Draco.
Potter takes one step up the stairs, and he’s standing so close to Draco now that their bodies are nearly touching. Draco feels the anticipation fluttering down his spine, as well as the urgent overwhelming need flooding into his groin, as he gazes into Potter’s darkened eyes.
it was closer to Hogsmeade then, but that he definitely met his girlfriend briefly, before the train reached to Hogsmeade.
The compartment is lit by the lamp over their heads, but otherwise the train is dark and quiet. Everything is in place – except the body and the blood – like it had been when Draco stepped in the compartment the first time. He watches, as Potter stays crouched in the middle of the room, staring at the exact spot where Travers was lying, his posture still.
His father clears his throat, and looks a bit unsure. “He…was seen having an argument with Miss Travers, close to the time when you saw her as well.”
After the Minister had left, followed by Hermione, Harry had met with Ginny, and together, they had decided to talk to their children about their divorce. In order to preserve some privacy, they had taken up one of the small classrooms on the second floor. It had been uncomfortable, quiet and painful, had left Harry feeling raw and concerned. He reckoned Ginny was feeling quite along the same lines.
After a short silence Potter speaks. “You think it’s true? …That bit about our sons…you know. Dating?”
Scorpius’s eyes widen in surprise. “I don’t know anything!” He almost shouts. “I’m –” Scorpius’s voice suddenly dies away, his gaze fixed at somewhere over Albus’s shoulder.
Albus wonders. Even Albus’s father seems to be coming along with Scorpius’s father, and they were the ones who were brawling their entire time at school.
Harry nods. “Her, then Mr Woods, then Mr Riley,” he says, and when Neville frowns slightly, Harry adds, “Quinn will accompany the students there and back.”
Rage lifts its head inside Albus, as he watches how his friend looks up, and gives Albus a questioning look.
A while later, the questioning has ended, and after fifteen minutes of excruciating silence, after Quinn has confirmed that the potion has worn off from Albus; Quinn, Smith and Slughorn make their excuses, leaving Harry and Ginny in the room with Albus, all three of them in uncomfortable shock.
Moonstone stares upwards, as if trying to remember the occasion. “They were…talking about someone. Names were not mentioned, but it seemed that Mr Riley was upset,” he says, giving Harry a steady look. “But that might not mean anything.”
He gives Scorpius one last scrutinising look, and then follows his line of sight. Scorpius is watching James, Albus’s brother, who is in the process of scowling at them. He glances back to Scorpius and sees his friend’s jaw tightening, and has an idea of what could be the issue.
“It is time to solve this case,” Harry tells the audience. “There are two possible solutions to what happened to Jenna Travers on the Hogwarts Express, 9 January. One of the solutions is quite simple, but, unfortunately, would leave an offender unsentenced, for the time being. This solution would fit with most, but not all the facts.” Harry speaks grimly, feeling the tension around him in the Great Hall.
“How’s the family? How’s Ginny?” Moonstone mutters from his desk, where he is rifling through a stack of parchments.
Quinn watches Albus carefully, before he speaks. “You said she threatened to reveal your personal and confidentially told information to others. How did you feel about that?”
Somehow, other people’s descriptions of the train ride, as well as his history with Travers made his own story questionable, and he doesn’t know how, or why. He knows that Rose too will have to face the same thing the next day, as during the train ride she had apparently stopped by Travers’s compartment, and been alone with her. He thinks back to their conversation in the library after classes, after Rose had been questioned.
, Harry thinks, for making him unable to enjoy a quick wank without his mind wandering over to the blonde Slytherin.
Albus and Scorpius exchange a quick glance before they move forward and take their seats; Albus next to his brother, and Scorpius next to his father. Professor Fox moves to the side where Professor Flitwick is already sitting in a chair against the wall.
Of course, the map is over forty years old, and as it was made for the amusement of four students, there could be errors. But it couldn’t hurt, Harry reckons.
“Don’t, Hermione,” Harry says tightly, knowing that this is not the time to be desperate. This is the time to act. “I’ll take twelve then,” Harry says after a quick thinking. “Peakes and Figg are on call – they can cover the Office,” Harry states, already waving his wand to conjure a messenger Patronus.
“What is it, James?” Harry asks, stifling the urge to check the time – he is on the clock, as they say, and he really hopes that this is important. “I need to get going soon,” he mutters.
James’s gaze snaps to his mother; he gives her a deep glare. “You don’t even know what happened!” James says heatedly, “She embarrassed him! Broke up with him one morning, with a new boyfriend already, in front of the entire school, just like that!”
James clears his throat and looks up at Quinn. “Yeah,” he mutters, swallowing hard. “After that…I gathered everyone together, and – um – basically told her that she was a daft cow to not realise we were taking the piss out of her – that she had to be deranged to even think we’d invite such a slag to party with us,” James says very quietly, looking everywhere but at Harry, Ginny or Quinn.
but then again, so had Travers, with how she had treated Albus, as well as spreading awful rumours about Harry and his son on the train, in the beginning of their holidays.
Harry feels a flicker of amusement, and briefly wonders how many times he has actually visited the office, both during McGonagall’s time and Moonstone’s. “I believe so,” he merely says, and then clears his expression before glancing at the group of three students. “Is Miss Westen there?” He asks from Neville, who confirms Harry’s assumption with an agreeing gesture.
Harry barely listens as Ginny starts to demand details from James about Albus’s relationships, and this group of witches that seems very much like some kind of a twisted Harry -fan club. James tells Ginny he doesn’t want to know about his brother’s personal life, and that Albus sure as hell doesn’t tell anything to him.
Albus frowns at the Hufflepuffs, before turning towards his friend. “What do you think, mate?” Albus mutters and nudges Scorpius, evidently pulling him from his thoughts.
Quinn gives Albus a tight smile. “I’m afraid I cannot speak about it.” He glances at his notes, and then back at Albus. “How would you describe your relationship with Scorpius?”
Harry narrows his eyes slightly. “And how did that make you feel?” He asks, wondering if that would be enough for the bloke to actually harm his girlfriend – or worse; accidentally kill her.
Malfoy’s eyes flash with something Harry can’t place. “Is this about my son?” Malfoy asks, as soon as he has sat down opposite to Harry, on the other side of the table.
Of course, he is not daft enough to utter something like that out loud. At least not in the company of five Aurors, who are in the middle of a murder investigation.
Quinn clears his throat a couple of times, and definitely avoids Albus’s mothers sharp glare. Albus can relate to that. She can be somewhat frightening. “So…you…” Quinn clears his throat again, glancing at his notes, “You were in bad terms?”
“Al?” Scorpius asks quietly, but rather…vehemently. And Albus knows he can’t avoid his friend, like he had done the previous night, when he had returned from his detention.
Potter arches a quizzical brow at Quinn. “What?” He says with a dubious look. “What are you talking about?”
Harry groans, stretching his back as soon as Quinn leaves Moonstone’s office, accompanied by Mr Woods. They have ten minutes before he ought to come back with Mr Riley. The boyfriend.
the fucking reaction I was hoping for!” He yells, but doesn’t move, standing still right next to Scorpius’s bed. “And, my dear friend,
“Who do you think is dead?” Zachary asks quietly, his eyes quickly moving across the Slytherin table.
Potter then asks Keir to order them something to eat and drink, and there’s a short break. When Keir returns, Potter nods at Quinn, who then starts to go over the questionings he had held with Draco’s son and Potter’s sons and niece.
“Let’s start with Miss Westen, shall we?” Harry tells Quinn with a low voice, as they stop in front of a pile of large barrels.
“Don’t you fucking dare to cry on me,” Albus grits out, as a tear escapes from the corner of her eye. He wants to hex her. He wants to – he wants to – he wants to get the bloody hell away from her! “I’m leaving. Stay – stay away from me.” He says harshly, marching past her and slamming the door closed behind him.
McGonagall nods. “You may certainly question them in the company of their Head of House, but should there be a need for more
Moonstone nods slowly. “How are you doing?” He asks, his voice soft, and a concerned look in his eyes.
Potter lets out a deep sigh, his gaze fixed at Draco. “It seems that we need to question Miss Westen and Mr Riley again. And probably the Scott sisters as well.”
Harry jumps slightly – he hadn't heard Quinn approaching him. He clears his throat and nods at Quinn. “Is James ready?”
Auror Smith clears his throat on Berrycloth’s other side. “Sir,” he says with a small grimace. “There’s something you might want to hear about your other son,” he says, and Potter’s eyes widen, almost comically.
James nods, and then gives their father a short summary of what happened at the party. James also tells him it was the last time he spoke to the girl.
Harry gives him an agreeing gesture to lead the way, and Moonstone does so. “Longbottom is keeping company to one of your Aurors stationed in my house,” Moonstone explains as they take a detour from the Entrance hall, slipping behind a tapestry and making their way through the narrow passage towards upstairs.
“Why didn’t you stay with her and go to the school together?” Harry asks, watching how Riley’s cheeks tinge slightly with red.
Harry sighs in relief inwardly, thanking bloody Merlin that Scorpius hasn’t got anything to do with Travers’s death. He glances at Malfoy, who too looks relieved, his impassive expression crumbling slightly as he squeezes his son’s hand, swallowing hard.
Harry gives Malfoy an incredulous look. “What?” He then shakes his head quickly, realising what Malfoy is on about. “No. It’s not,” He says firmly, and then looks away, rubbing his neck. “You just witnessed me asking Ginny if she will agree to it – to let Quinn question Albus under Veritaserum.”
Riley is tall and well-built; a bloke who seems like he would be popular among other students. But as he sits in the armchair, Harry reckons he looks rather weak…like he’s lost.
“Travers had a dispute in the party with James and his friends. She left soon after her arrival. James did not see Travers at all during the train ride, but spent it with his friends and girlfriend, leaving them only for thirty minutes, during which he met with Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley, approximately one to two hours before the train arrived to Hogsmeade. Rose Granger-Weasley’s questioning confirms that James did indeed see her and her brother during the train ride, but she couldn’t say if it took exactly thirty minutes.”
Harry and Quinn are having a quick bite to eat in the classroom they’ve been using for questioning the students, and simultaneously going through the results of the morning’s interrogations.
Harry eventually manages to order all but Molly to go to their beds, promising that they will be safe, proceeding to give the same instructions to Bletchley as he did to Parkinson. He leaves the Ravenclaw common room and exhales in the corridor before making his way to the Gryffindor Tower.
Harry thinks, not really wanting to picture the details of the occurrence. Scorpius and Albus, they were –
“It’s nothing. Just feeling a bit off, nothing more,” Scorpius murmurs back to his friend, averting his eyes from Albus’s.
McGonagall gives Harry a small smile. “I have faith in you, Harry. I know you are doing everything you can. I merely wish we could already put this behind us.”
Two hours later, he’s somewhat finished, at least for the day. Harry decides to review the report in the morning before sending it out to Hermione. He will be working the next day, of course he is, but he also needs a good rest, and that definitely means he will not be at the office at the hour Hermione is expecting Harry’s report. He leans down against the sofa, his head falling to the backrest, feeling heavy. Harry stares at the ceiling, his mind still in the case: still going over the details, still checking that he has seen all the clues, that he has paid enough attention to the evidence. The result was clear, Harry is sure of it, but he still needs to go over the case in order to let it go – something he had to learn to do, as years went by and all his cases and all the people that were part of them, were all there, stuck in his head.
Potter stills, pulling his head back slightly to meet Draco’s eyes. His glasses are askew, his pupils blown wide, and his mouth…well, Draco will steer his eyes away from Potter’s delectable mouth, at least for the time being.
Albus is too stunned by the recent events to point out how odd Scorpius appears. He feels angered. He feels exasperated. He stomps towards his bed and tells his friend about Scott.
Riley frowns at Harry, and then glances away before looking back. “No…I don’t think so. She – she didn’t quarrel with anyone,” he says, looking slightly edgy.
The Aurors have been discussing their plans for the day throughout the breakfast, occasionally asking about the details of the scene from Draco. Potter has been using most of the time to make floocalls to a number of people: the Minister, the Auror office, their boss – who Draco has only met a handful of times after the war and after his hiring – and Weasley’s mother, apparently.
The Aurors go over the results of their interrogations once more, trying to form a timeline based on the Prefects’ answers. Most of them eat, but Draco cannot stomach even the idea of food. All he can think of is his son. What is going on with Scorpius? What will happen to him?
Draco watches him expectantly, until, it must be at least ten minutes later, Potter gives Draco both a harsh and an eager look.
Harry’s steely gaze briefly meets Moonstone’s, before he focuses back to the boy. “What happened after you left her…in the compartment?” Harry asks, wondering if Riley was the last person who saw her alive.
“I dunno. She didn’t tell me,” Riley tells Harry, holding his gaze. “She was stressed out by something, and I…kinda,” Riley says with a grimace, “was frustrated by that. She blew me off, told me she’d need to change into her school robes and that she’d go to the carriages with Skylar, and that she’d meet me in school.”
Harry is utterly amazed and taken aback by his fourteen-year-old girl. He’s astonished how bright she is, how – how mature she is, as well as surprised by her insightfulness. At the same time, he feels mortified, that Albus…that Albus had known so long. And hadn’t said anything to Harry or Ginny – or his brother or sister, for that matter, until yesterday. But he
The food and drinks appear onto the side table, and Potter gestures everyone to take a snack, before Quinn continues.
had said to him. It had been James’s fault. Albus is certain there would be nothing to say, nothing to reveal, if James hadn’t been a tosser.
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” Albus asks, heatedly, cursing inwardly for letting himself fall into his brother’s trap once more, as the smug look on James’s face only intensifies.
Albus and Scorpius exchange a look, before Albus turns away, taking a couple steps back towards the castle, swallowing down the frustration and ache that presses against his chest, that twists his stomach. He stills and closes his eyes as Scorpius says his name behind him, as if asking where Albus is going, but at the same time, like he’s merely acknowledging Albus taking his leave.
After his final word, the hall explodes with shocked sounds, with urgent discussions, with several, raised hands. And Harry nods at each of them in turn, answers each of the questions calmly and steadily, until the next one.
They are all dismissed, and Albus’s dad ushers them out just as he hears Rose inquiring if her mother will be there.
His thoughts linger in the girl’s sad fate – how it all could’ve been prevented. Harry feels resigned as he thinks how something like that can happen by an accident. He thinks it wasn’t an accident, though, which doesn’t really make him feel any better about it.
Potter gapes at him, his neck turning red. “I…I need a minute.” He grunts and then he’s off, walking briskly away, with the other Auror following him.
His contemplation is disturbed by an uproar of laughter originating from, where else, but the Gryffindor table.
Ginny lets out an outrageous gasp, her eyes moving sharply from Quinn, to Harry, to Albus, and back to Quinn.
Moonstone sighs, standing up. “You’re more speculative. Harsher. But all of that probably comes with the job, hm?” He says, walking to his desk, his back turned towards Harry. “Have at it,” he mutters, waving his hand towards the fireplace at the back wall.
Albus takes a look around him, seeing the shocked expressions of his classmates, before he quickly starts to locate his siblings and cousins in the Great Hall. He needs to see that they’re all there, that they are not…not the –
“It is a nightmare,” McGonagall says, staring out of the windows in her circular office. The sun has gone down and the grounds are dark.
Albus takes a couple of heaving breaths, and stares at his friend – who looks…rather pale, actually. A bit nauseous. The dorm is otherwise empty.
He then explains what they have established so far; that nothing out of ordinary was found from the village, the station, or from the school. He tells the parents that his crime scene investigator is still investigating the scene, and that they can go see their daughter in a bit over thirty minutes if they so wish.
you say?” He asks slowly, something contemplative – which Albus doesn’t really like – in his expression.
Albus muffles a cry of pain, and as James actually pauses to see if Albus is really hurt, the Slytherin in him sends a quick levitation charm, before throwing James sideways against the wall with a sickening crunch.
Malfoy looks slightly bothered, and glances away briefly, before giving Harry a serious look. “Well, yes, actually. But I suppose it is not necessarily good news,” He says, pulling a book – the one that was lying in the pool of blood in the compartment they found Miss Travers from, now dried – from the chair next to him and places it on the table.
, was speaking on Draco’s behalf during the trials after the war, making sure Draco and his parents stayed away from Azkaban. What Potter
James shifts in his seat, looking very uncomfortable. “She, um…she said,” James murmurs, and gives Harry an apologising look. “She said ‘I hope for all the single women in the wizarding world, that Harry Potter is not as useless in the sack, as his son is.’”
it to happen, Scor,” Albus grits through his teeth. “I want to know, what kind of potion you were on, or exactly where in the head you were hit, if you thought it was a good idea to fuck my brother when you were staying at
“Calming Draught or the Draught of Peace are the most probable potions; both of which are used in Psychopharmacology, and with an abnormal measure those could cause a similar result to what was found in the blood analysis,” Draco clarifies.
Rose lets out a long, weary sigh. “Oh, Albus…” She whispers, and then, Albus feels her fingers curl against his waist, her forehead pressing against his back.
He gives Parkinson a curt nod. “Smith will return to the village after midnight, along with Bones, Keir and Quinn. Peele and Prone will stay at school premises. Summon them if you need anything,” Harry says, and then frowns a bit before adding very quietly, “In case of an emergency, send the usual messenger, but alert the teachers as well, since they are closer and can provide assistance faster.”
Potter swallows hard and gives a frown at Draco. “It’s nothing,” He mutters, and then nods at the school, as they approach its gates looming ahead of them. “Have you been here? After – after school?” Potter asks, changing the subject, and for a tense moment, Draco was afraid Potter was going to say ‘after the war’, but when he doesn’t, Draco thinks the Hero of the Wizarding Britain
Most of the students are in their dormitories, which Harry thinks is better, as they are only questioning the Prefects.
Harry clenches his jaw, nods at Malfoy, before giving Ginny a pointed look. “We can continue the discussion regarding our son later, Ginny, if that’s what you wish. However, you know it is for the best,” He says, lifting his brows slightly, moving the conversation back to the inspection.
Harry knows. Of course, he bloody well knows about it; how some students in Hogwarts had started rumours that Scorpius was in fact Voldemort’s child, claiming that Astoria had travelled back in time, to the past and had – well, Harry had been as appalled as any sensible person, when Albus had told him. Harry had been as adamant as Albus, to never show pity to Scorpius, but always make him feel welcome in their home, and make him feel accepted.
Quinn shuffles his parchments. “Albus spent the train ride with his dormmates Scorpius, Julian and Cecil, and told us in the questioning that there had been approximately a thirty-minute period during which he hadn’t seen anyone but Scorpius, Jenna Travers and Nate Riley, less than two hours before arriving to Hogsmeade. Albus had gone to change into his school robes, and as he had returned to the compartment, it had been empty. He had then proceeded to go and find Scorpius – whom he did find, in the middle of an argument with Travers.”
Harry lets out a quiet sigh of relief. Rose doesn’t know anyone who would know anything about Travers’s death either, as Quinn asks it from her next.
“It was different.” Malfoy suddenly says, not looking at Harry. “When Astoria lived. Scorpius was different,” he says simply.
“No. I daresay I haven’t,” he says quietly, watching the castle in front of them with longing and sadness. There are too many good and bad memories he needs to swallow down and examine later in the confines of his room.
On his way to the school, Harry had met James at the Quidditch pitch, where the boy had been flying laps, looking somewhat unfocused. As Harry had asked if everything was okay, James had merely waved him off, muttering something about school stuff. He had asked James, if he wanted to talk about the questioning that would happen later in the morning, remembering how shocked James had been the previous night after Harry had informed him of the matter, as well as asked if he and Ginny could attend the questioning. When James had stayed silent, Harry had continued to reassure his son, explaining once more that it was only to clear his name off the table, as he had been witnessed having a dispute with Travers during the holidays, and because he had left his compartment for thirty minutes towards the end of the train ride, and unfortunately, Rose could not say if she had been in his company exactly that time.
Albus crosses his arms and looks away. When he doesn’t say anything, their father turns to James. “James?” He asks, his voice still filled with confusion.
Albus quickly closes his mind, schools his expression into a blank one, before nodding at his friends and walking closer so his other house-mates cannot eavesdrop them. “Is Scorpius in dorm?” He asks stiffly, glancing at the direction to their dorms, suppressing the urge to grit his teeth together, forcing to stay expressionless, thinking that his friends would probably follow him if they’d think something’s not right.
Potter has been staring at Draco, so intensely, that it almost seems like he has forgot there are others in the room. Draco keeps the walls protecting his mind up, keeps the blank look on his face, and watches emotionlessly back as Potter’s concerned, green eyes try to search his, try to find something, before they move away, and focus on the middle of table.
“What did you tell them, just now? Did you tell them the truth about what happened on the train? That I was there, and I was the one who told Riley and Travers to sod off?” Albus asks, forcing his voice to stay calm.
“The Headmistress is with Miss Travers’s parents, expecting us there shortly. I have been in touch with the school governors, and asked them to inform the students’ families about the…incident. There will evidently be concerned parents arriving to the village tomorrow,” He says, and glances at Bones, Keir and Quinn before moving his eyes back to Harry. “Shall we?”
Harry nods, just as there’s a knock on the door. Quinn flicks his wand to clear the table while Harry goes to open the door. Ginny marches inside, a hint of a scowl in her expression, still undoubtedly steaming after what Albus had told Quinn, and somehow, deciding it is Harry’s fault. Which Harry thinks it kind of is, but it is not like Harry had any say about the matter. He didn’t choose to be the Chosen One – that was all Voldemort. All his life, he’s tried to stay away from the spotlight, and Ginny knows it as well. Harry knows she will eventually calm down and apologise. He just hopes she will do so sooner than later, as they really need to go over the circumstances of Albus’s situation together, and do something about it.
Draco clears his throat, glancing at the notes he has stacked neatly in front of him. “Sixteen-year-old girl, found in the train compartment with a severe penetrating blow to the head, resulting a massive blood loss and a traumatic brain injury; which I have confirmed to be the cause of death. Based on the body temperature, time of death is approximately between five-thirty and six-thirty pm,” he says, glancing at the timepiece on the wall, “yesterday, on January ninth.”
Scorpius gives Albus a thoughtful look. “Perhaps she wishes to know if we saw anything,” he says quietly.
Malfoy gapes at Harry for a moment, and then scowls at him. “You utter imbecile.” He growls, before shoving him away. “You realise what I said merely moments ago, about this –” He hisses, gesturing between them “– being entirely inappropriate.” He lifts his brows at Harry, who now feels a wave of embarrassment flicker through him under Malfoy’s hard stare.
Albus thinks for a bit if he ought to do something about what happened during the holidays – with her – but eventually decides to ponder it later, when he’s in the privacy of his own four-poster bed, and proceeds to join in the conversation with his dormmates.
The parents leave with Moonstone, who escorts them to the station to see their daughter. Harry agrees that he or one of his Aurors will meet them in the village the next day to give them an update about the investigation.
They walk the rest of the way in silence, until they reach the gargoyle, and all Albus can think of is what Fox might have heard from his and Scorpius’s argument. Fox gives the password, and then they take the stairs up before stepping into the Headmistress’s office.
“Potter…?” Malfoy asks quietly, but doesn’t say more, doesn’t object, as Harry steps into his space, so close that their thighs are touching. The air is charged, compressed between them.
Quinn tells them that he talked with Albus’s father, who told him what Albus had said this morning – that Albus did see the victim on the train. “Why don’t you start by telling us about the train ride? What happened and who were you with until the moment you saw Miss Travers?”
Harry has been thinking the same thing. Why get back at her several months later, if Albus and Travers hadn’t been in any contact between September and the end of December?
James gives Quinn a shrug. “I wouldn’t have, but then I heard her on the train, when we were on the journey back home for the holidays, and she was…talking about Albus to her friends,” James says, his voice cold.
Harry’s thoughts move to Albus; there’s so much…resentment in the boy, that Harry is only starting to realise it. And he thinks that a lot of it is directed at, not Harry himself, but, to
“Based on this – based on the evidence; I declare this case solved. Jenna Travers died by an accident. An accident, she had caused by herself.”
“Higgins, Bletchley, Walter and Parkinson will be stationed in common rooms,” Harry says, giving orders quickly, “Peele and Prone will search the school, while Bones and Smith investigate the grounds.”
“Yeah,” Harry murmurs, his eyes already flickering to the parchments. “Oh, Peele?” He says, remembering something from earlier.
Once he is positive that he’s alone, Draco lets his shoulders sag down, taking in several deep breaths before continuing his inspection.
There’re sounds of murmur and whispers along the Hall. Most of the students have noticed the peculiar behaviour of their professors.
“Mr and Mrs Travers are in my office, waiting news about the investigation. They were also asking to see their daughter’s body after the scene has been searched,” McGonagall says wearily.
Albus tries to question Scorpius, to make him tell Albus how his questioning went, but Scorpius shrugs him off, simply telling him that nothing particularly interesting came up. Albus has a feeling that his friend hasn’t told him everything there is to tell.
Berrycloth – the only one who Draco has actually exchanged words with, as he was the one who sealed the train after Draco had wrapped up for the day and sent the body with a Portkey to his colleagues at the wizarding morgue – levitates a large tray behind him, placing it on one the side tables before casting a stasis charm to the several plates of food. He then takes the seat next to Potter.
Scorpius lowers his gaze, looking both anxious and remorseful, shaking his head at his lap. “I didn’t plan that to happen.” He says slowly. “I didn’t think…And, I didn’t think it would happen again, so…I didn’t tell you. And I didn’t tell you, because I knew how you’d react!” He says, with a weary look and an exasperated voice.
“What do you mean, does he know that?” James asks, an eye roll in his voice. “He should. I asked him to shut up about it.”
Harry sighs, looking out from the window, to the snowy landscape. His sons should be enjoying the weather after their classes, and not be questioned for murder. Still, if there is a way to speed things up, he knows it is with Veritaserum. And if Albus truly has spoken the truth, wouldn’t it be better to question him once more, and be done with it?
without consulting him first, and then, keep something like that – and keep something as big as fancying men – from Albus, is…outrageous. He bristles at the thought, feeling betrayed, his mind still in a haze, his stomach still somewhat nauseous, his eyes still stinging – which he thinks is probably some after effect of the potion – and finally steps into the common room. Scorpius is nowhere to be seen.
“Hey Scor,” Albus greets his friend at dinner, as Scorpius sits down next to him at their house table.
He lets out a wheezing huff and stammers incoherently, “You! She – she said – and, and – bloody fuck!” Potter growls, trailing a hand over his unruly mop of hair. “You’re the bloody crime scene investigator!”
Harry sighs wearily, trailing a hand through his hair in order to soothe it down, knowing, it must be sticking into all kinds of directions after Malfoy’s long fingers were –
– as in Albus’s and Scorpius’s, since Scorpius spent his holidays with Albus’s family, while Scorpius’s father was abroad for work. Well, it was mostly Scorpius with Albus and his siblings, since Albus’s mum was called to some emergency business trip right after Christmas, and his dad was working half of the holiday, and spending almost the other half with James at his Quidditch try-outs – Albus begrudgingly admits that his brother is a rather exceptional player, and probably will make a contract with one of the teams in the British League.
He grabs one, and then glares at Quinn. “Are you all taking the piss out of me?” He demands, his expression bordering desperate.
A deep frown pulls itself between Quinn’s brows. Harry feels as confused as Albus looks. How the hell could one of them lie during a questioning under Veritaserum? There has to be an explanation. It simply cannot be possible.
James starts by telling how he had agreed to spend the night with some of his friends, and how it then somewhat expanded into a party when his friends brought their friends, and Albus had invited his friends. He tells how one of his classmates took Muggle Studies with Travers, and how Travers had been disliked by many of his friends. How she had been disliked by James as well, after she had messed around with his brother.
He looks down, where his hand is still deep inside Draco’s trousers, holding Draco’s cock in a gentle grip. “Shit.”
He exchanges words briefly with Walter, the young eager Auror, who seems to be getting well with the students, and has managed to calm them down somewhat, as James, Fred, Dominique, Lily and Hugo do not seem as anxious or worried as the rest of the children had been.
“Mr Riley is from the Ravenclaw house, but I presume he is currently in the Hufflepuff common room?” McGonagall says, giving an inquiring brow at Moonstone, who nods back at her.
Albus feels rage surging inside him. “Why would I have? Why should I tell you every time some daft witch decides to chase their fifteen minutes of fame?” He asks harshly, scowling at his father. “Why should I tell you about the one time I thought it wasn’t the case, and got bit in the arse because of it?”
James leaves after hugging Ginny, and after murmuring a quiet ‘later’ to Harry. Ginny looks stonily at the Malfoys, before giving Harry a sharp look.
Draco knows that there are still people – still, after almost twenty-five years! – in the wizarding world who think ill of the Malfoy family, and old Death Eater families in general; at least of those whose family members fought in the wrong side of the two wars. Will the Aurors be impartial, and give Draco’s son the same treatment and the same benefit of the doubt than they do for the rest of the students? Something they will most certainly do for the Head Auror’s sons?
Yes, Harry is aware of the fact that Draco and Scorpius look alike – quite like Albus and Harry do – but Scorpius is different from his father; he is, usually at least, carefree, smiling, polite, and open-minded. Whereas Draco…is not. Or was not. Harry couldn’t really say, as he hasn’t spoken with the man for a long time.
Harry walks into the room, moves to sit in the back with Slughorn and watches as Quinn gives the same explanation to Malfoy and Scorpius, as he did to Harry, Ginny and James only forty-five minutes ago. Scorpius moves closer to Quinn and Smith to take the potion, and the effect is instant; his shoulders sag, and he somewhat slumps back into his chair – a posture Harry has never seen Scorpius take, even as he has spent time with Harry’s son at his home. Regardless of how carefree Scorpius is compared to his father, his posture and gracefulness have always screamed of a Malfoy.
Potter leans closer, dipping his head onto Draco’s neck and presses his lips against the skin, very softly, all the while thrusting his hips lightly against Draco’s.
Harry blinks, realising how he has been staring at Malfoy’s fingers, knowing how he bloody well needs to get a grip of himself!
But it hadn’t meant anything. Albus is nothing more than a friend to Scorpius. And now Albus is not sure if he is even that.
“Berrycloth, Fungbury and Weasley are patrolling the station and Hogsmeade,” Harry continues, “Higgins, Bletchley, Walter and Parkinson will go back to the common rooms until we have cleared the threat – expect a nightshift, and communicate if there is anything suspicious,” Harry says to the Aurors in question; who all nod grimly.
Draco barely suppresses a much-needed sneer. What does Weasley think, exactly? That Potter has been slacking during his time in here? That he has had all the time in the world, during a possible murder investigation? Now that Draco is looking at him, and seeing how exhausted Potter looks, he reckons the poor bloke probably hasn’t been able to take a proper breath during the whole day before now, and even now he is being reprimanded by his wife.
Riley shrugs. “I went to hang out with my dorm mates – Tristan and Carter – for the rest of the trip.”
He knows that he has a bit of time before the others wake up and they’ll be starting a new day in the investigation – it is not yet five-thirty, and he assumes the Aurors are still sleeping – so he decides to make the most of it and step into a hot shower down the hall.
Malfoy’s eyes move over Harry’s features. “I take it she was not overjoyed?” He asks, his voice now void of the sharpness, his expression less menacing than it was mere moments ago.
Thirty minutes before the train reached Hogsmeade. Something Rose hadn’t clearly remembered yesterday, when she had been asked the very same question. Harry frowns, knowing that he needs to go over the details again with Malfoy
“Umph! Pamela!” Albus gasps and wrenches himself away from her, stumbling backwards. “W-What the hell?” He breathes, gaping at her.
“You didn’t answer my first question,” Albus says, scrutinising his friend. There’s something Scorpius is not telling him, and Albus feels a flicker of doubt when his friend looks at him.
Quinn nods. “And as James is of age, you will need to have his agreement again to be present during his questioning.”
Albus sighs. “I don’t know. He wanted to humiliate her in front of everyone. I suppose it was to pay back for the shit she did to me,” he says, and as his parents give him shocked looks, he continues, “James didn’t have any beef with her. He didn’t even know her.”
He walks to his coat rack and sees his reflection from the window beside it. He’s in a desperate need of a haircut. And a shave, Harry adds to himself in his mind as he scratches his holiday beard. Ginny used to cut his hair, and now that she hasn’t, Harry has let it grow to his shoulders. He keeps it tied back in a bun at the nape of his neck. Something his fourteen-year-old daughter teasingly calls a ‘man bun’. Harry snorts inwardly as he thinks about her; the small girl with her fiery red hair and spirit, and the fact that Harry will be utterly ruled over by her in a couple of years.
And Albus, he doesn’t object – not even though they are in the middle of an empty Entrance Hall, where anyone could see them. He leans against his father’s side, briefly marvelling how familiar and safe he feels. And for a moment, he closes his eyes, wishing he would be a young boy again, wishing that the world – his world – would be like he remembers it had been when he was younger.
Scorpius didn’t know the actual reason why Albus was avoiding him, no… because – how could Albus tell him, that after he’d hexed his brother for snogging Scorpius, Albus had realised that he himself wanted to do the exact same thing?
“Dad…” Albus mutters, feeling somewhat relieved that his father is coming there, and knowing that everything will be all right then. His father is good at what he does.
He has come terms with it – his eventual divorce from Ginny. He knows they tried to fix things for a long time, and he also knows that there were no villains in their story – at least not the kind that tried to break up their marriage. They succeeded doing that by themselves; by throwing themselves into work, into their careers, into their children, and at the same time forgetting their relationship. They had many good years together and Harry knows he will cherish those memories. Along with the bad ones.
Harry swallows uncomfortably, trying to not be bothered by the way Malfoy’s sharp eyes track his every movement.
Albus briefly thinks, that the old Madam Pomfrey must’ve been out of her mind to think they’d be finishing the several dozens of bedpans during this evening, without magic.
Hermione sighs. “Yes, Harry. I knew. Does it matter?” She asks, somewhat tersely. “Are you unable to do your job because of him?” She asks, already knowing the answer, knowing, that nothing can make Harry unable to do his job, when he has decided to do it, to solve the crime.
And Harry is even more stunned, if possible, since… James and Albus, they get along, but they have never been as close as Lily and James, or Lily and Albus. The fact that James would defend his brother – and Harry admits that the means to do so were rather harsh – makes his chest warm a bit.
Albus feels irritated by Scorpius’s dickish behaviour. He moves back to his own bed and watches his friend closely. “And yours.”
He grits together his teeth, knowing that he can very well suppress his feelings, and stay expressionless. But not with his brother. Yes, James, for some reason, manages to bring the best and the worst out of him. He manages, somehow, to make Albus stay open and…vulnerable, whenever they’re together.
Before Harry had left the village early in the morning to meet the Headmistress, he had talked with Quinn, and asked if he was going to question James about the party – as he, like Quinn, was aware that there had been alcohol and underage kids involved in the party, and not an adult supervising the get-together; something that could be quite uncomfortable to Harry, should it come to public knowledge – but Quinn had told Harry that he didn’t think it was important to ask about it, as they were more interested to know where James had been during the train ride, if he had seen Travers during it, and, if he had anything to do with her death, or, if he knew anyone who had.
“Amongst the spells Miss Travers had cast with her wand that day, were two Vanishing spells, before the last spell Miss Travers had cast; a Locking spell to the door,” Harry explains. “Vanishing spells, that were likely used to vanish the vials of the potion.”
Harry feels anxious, briefly wondering if Scorpius and Albus had wanted to keep their relationship in secret so vehemently that they had…acted upon it?
Harry quickly suppresses a snort, while Draco simply rolls his eyes, even though his cheeks flush with pink.
Hermione nods, watching Harry carefully. “Is everything all right? Between you and…Draco?” She asks, and Harry feels odd, that Hermione calls him by his first name, while Harry, well…Harry tries to keep it at ‘Malfoy’.
Harry follows him obediently, knowing that it is for the best, that, he ought to focus on his job, and not fucking Malfoy into his mattress, however tempting it sounds in his mind. Perhaps, if he somehow manages to solve this puzzle, there will be a time for that, later.
As they step into the Entrance Hall, Harry greets Professor Moonstone – the Head of Hufflepuff house. The girl was one of the students in his house.
Scorpius’s father walks forward and Scorpius follows, his back rigid. Scorpius looks back to share one last look with Albus, before he steps into the classroom.
But who was it? Someone who hates Scorpius? Albus doesn’t think there are students – or Prefects – who’d hate Scorpius, since Scorpius doesn’t really ruffle anyone’s feathers as he rarely even talks to people other than Albus and their dorm mates. Albus doesn’t think anyone would want to harm Scorpius and downright
Albus sighs wearily, knowing there’s nothing he can say about it, knowing that everything he wants to say, would be a very dickish thing to say, to both James and Scorpius. Because, deep down, Albus knows that James wouldn’t – he wouldn’t do anything, if Albus said he’d minded.
Harry gives Neville a small, tight smile and gestures at Higgins. “Auror Higgins will be stationed here for the night,” he murmurs the words, as approximately seventy pairs of eyes watch their conversation carefully.
Harry takes a moment to rub his temples, and then makes his way back to the classroom they’ve been using for the questionings. Ron and Hermione are both standing with Rose in the Entrance Hall.
Draco can hear his boss’s question, but his focus is on Potter, who right then walks into the pub, only to be confronted by a group of anxious Weasleys.
Draco feels Potter’s questioning look even before he sees it. “Yes?” Draco drawls, lifting his head and arching a brow at Potter.
“Oh. I was…um, going to check the compartment,” He says, and then gives Malfoy a sheepish look. “And also, to talk to you about the investigation if you happened to still be here.”
and him, knowing how she must’ve felt like after James had treated her so badly in the party. Albus on the other hand, hadn’t apparently known about what had happened between his brother and his friend, and had thought that Travers had merely spoken ill about Albus. Or, perhaps, it was what Scorpius had insisted to Albus, Harry thinks. Albus hadn’t even known that Scorpius had originally told Quinn that Travers had been threatening to spread false lies about Scorpius and Albus, something that Harry had seen from Albus’s expression, when Quinn had asked about their relationship.
“I was going to talk to you in the morning, in any case.” Harry says, and it is the truth, as it is quite late at night already, and he hadn’t known that Malfoy had still been at the scene. And Harry could’ve gone to see the compartment in the morning, allowing himself a few hours of rest. He gives Malfoy a shrug, “And…you said
The cousins eventually went their separate ways to explore the shop while the adults talked. Harry had every intention of looking at all the small shiny things. He truly did, until he heard squeaking behind a rather old looking bookcase. He followed the squeaking, vigorously passed old grandfather clocks, through rows of strange globes, and even under a table until he finally cornered the mousey morsel. All of his instincts were telling him that he was hungry, the mouse was food, it’s fresh. While the human part of his brain was screaming at him that was not proper behavior for a boy to do. That mice are not food when he’s human but he’s hungry. He hasn’t eaten anything more than that bit of broccoli from yesterday. He didn’t remember the last time he ate before that. He swiped up the mouse with deft hands and raised it to his mouth, ignoring the fact that it was very much alive and covered in fur. He ignored the footsteps coming from around the corner as he lowered the squirming mouse. He faintly registered Dudley staring at him but couldn’t make out the expression on his face. His only concern was the mouse in his hands and how fast it would take him to eat it.
Harry looked down at the odd looking goblin and waited for him to speak. He couldn’t be sure, goblins had odd faces after all, but it almost seemed like the creature was looking at him with tears in his eyes almost like Harry was a lost family member that finally came home.
“We should be off soon. I believe it’s time for you to gather your things now as we still have a long day ahead.”
Dudley rolled his eyes and fought back the urge to yell at the man that Harry was a person, not a thing. He didn’t because he knew it would get him nowhere and probably in even more trouble later on. So instead he trudged to the small bathroom with his cousin slithering at his heels. Thankfully his and Harry’s clothes were already in the bathroom when they got there.
Harry let out a small huff in response and wished he’d speak to him like he used to before he turned into Vernon’s little soldier. Sure Dudley had been mean to him when his parents were around but that was because Vernon and Petunia were horrible people and could be quite scary to a small child. Before Harry shifted into a snake the first time and bit him for being a dunce though, they used to constantly use snake-speak with each other and ad been quite close when behind closed doors.
Groaning rather loudly, Dudley sat up as much as he could with the added weight on his still sleep-addled form and rubbed his eyes. He resisted the urge to curse at his mother when her ridiculous noises turned into actual words, most of which had the word brute or beast situated somewhere in her small horrid sentences.
Harry whispered to his cousin as they got closer. The leaves crunched under their feet as they made their way to the man.
He found him still chatting with the shopkeeper at the front desk and it seemed that the only thing had changed from when he left the man was that he now had a silver beehive pendant in front of him on the counter. He heard Dudley come up behind him and faintly registered Umdri chattering away from his perch. He paid them no mind as the Professor looked at them with a pleased expression only for it to turn into confusion seconds later.
“In its smaller form I made it appear that the opening was painted on to not attract attention but in reality it’s an open hole to a hollow nest. It will shrink back down in size once you are inside and will grow once more when you are ready to leave.”
