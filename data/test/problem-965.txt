A few weeks later, having provoked Potter a couple more times into explaining more and more complicated defense spells, Draco felt a lot more confident in his capacities. Fortunately, it was this day Lukewarm decided to make his class a lot less boring.
Harry’s legs were getting tired and as soon as Draco noticed, he cancelled the jinx, even extending a helping hand to put Harry back on his feet. But before pulling him up, he whispered in his ear: “You will never win against me if you keep playing it fair.”
“Now that you can’t move away, I’m going to take the cage off”, Draco continued, while Harry started violently wiggling around.
He was afraid she would be able to make those rebound on him like Potter had done instead of ricochet away and that he would end up being the one dancing this time. He thought about doing it on purpose so she would be distracted long enough by her own laughter so he could disarm her, but it was a huge risk and he was already getting tired. He was moving around a lot to block her stronger and stronger jinks and she herself was barely moving. If he was to do something big and unpredictable, he had to do it soon.
“I’m fine.” Potter answered immediately. The Gryffindor was positioned on all fours, so Draco couldn’t look into his eyes to see if he was telling the truth. He decided he had no reason not to trust him.
Harry was very close now. Too close. If Draco moved at all, Harry would think he was making a move to kiss him and that just could not happen, so he stood up swiftly. “I’m tired Potter, I’m going to bed” Draco informed him coldly.
The Gryffindor’s lips were once again so, so very close to his. Draco could feel his face growing red, his mouth going dry.
“No we are not. You are clearly trying to seduce me back in bed and that is therefore not a good idea. You will say anything to get me to cage you again. We will have this talk properly when you are not a sex addicted, life trauma escaping survivor guilted idiot anymore. I will admit thought that we should have had this talk months ago. I honestly can’t believe I never noticed what was going on earlier.” Draco declared, looking as determined as ever.
“Now, let’s get me out of here and more importantly, out of these horrid trousers.”
an opportunistic Slytherin arsehole.” Harry smirked at him and Malfoy finally smiled, a little. Malfoy got angry at him for being nice and smiled at him being a jerk. Harry would have to ask Hermione about that. It didn't make any sense.
Draco must have looked like he was about to implode, cause suddenly Granger was sitting closer to him and stroking his back. Not unlike what Potter had done on the tower. "You must feel very confused about those feelings", she started. Draco could only nod, so she continued: "all that history between the 2 of you, all that violence and hatred. I could understand that even though you had feelings for him, you'd be reluctant to start a relationship with him. Do you know how you feel about him, exactly?"
“Yes Sir.” Harry half joked.
“Plus, we hate each other. It’s going to look so suspicious if you defend me out of the blue like that."
It didn’t make any sense. Malfoy didn’t identify him at the manor. He had saved his life. Sent him a letter thanking him for his freedom, his wand back and more importantly his life, after the fiendfyre. The letter had felt sincere. Harry even hoped he and Malfoy could finally bury the hatchet for good.
After a while, Harry let go of his collar, and sat back on the couch. Close. So close their thighs were touching. Harry turned his head to look outside once more. Still no movement. It felt like the whole outside world was a painting on those windows. As cliché as it may sounds, it felt like they were the only two people in the world.
Malfoy had decided to stay to practice the Cautio charm, after having yet again cunningly used Potter to teach him how to do it. He noticed at the beginning of the school year that he usually zoned out when Lukewarm was talking and often missed the hand movements explanations. Provoking Potter into explaining them to him seemed the simplest way to learn without getting caught napping by the new Professor. Plus Potter was a way better teacher, even when yelling at him.
They stopped laughing. Looked at each other. Smiled. It did smell like spring.
"Come what may? Are you bloody serious? You're the most annoying detail-oriented brat in all of Britain. And all you have to say for yourself is "Come what may?"" Harry yelled, sitting back in his chair and moving his arms everywhere with big unfathomable eyes.
At around 9pm, he took his cigarette break. Draco went out into the alley, leaning against the wall as he smoked. The street was strangely deserted for a Saturday night, but at the same time, it was still early. He let his mind wander into earlier in the day, and he thought about that trip his aunt was taking to see his mother. The last time the two sisters had seen each other was on the Malfoy trial, where Andromeda testified for Draco, and back then they hadn’t had a chance to talk much because of the chaos that had been after Lucius’ conviction. He hoped the visit would be a good thing for both of them.
“I sure do. Your little sister went lengths with me just for some change, back in the day,” Peter said, crossing his hands behind his head.
“I don’t think it’s coming back. They’re just a bunch of idiots who think they’re better than everyone, it probably won’t get big,” Draco said, turning to look at Blaise.
“Nymphadora’s room. Yeah. I think it’s time. I’ve been putting this off ever since she left home after Hogwarts, and now… I want to turn it into a guest bedroom. For you,” she said, smiling. Her eyes held the sadness of a mother losing her daughter, yet the tears that were forming looked like hopeful tears.
“Department of Law Enforcement. We’re here to see Potter,” Draco answered, his tone casual.
The good thing was Hermione’s office was located on the same floor as the Department of Law Enforcement. The bad thing was, that place was one of the biggest departments in the Ministry. They raced like crazy across the floor, crossing multiple offices, bumping into wizards, until what finally stopped them was a red-headed wall that appeared in front of them.
“Well, show your ugly face and then we’ll see,” Malfoy answered.
, because I’m pretty sure there’s more to it.”
“You’re quite smart, Ginevra,” Draco said. She bowed her head in mockery then smiled mischievously at him.
The next morning he was woken up by someone knocking viciously on his door. Wait, was it morning? Draco rubbed his eyes and glanced at the clock on his bedside table.
“Bloody hell. What was that about?” The red-headed wall asked, turning around. Ron Weasley had the sleepiest look on his face, as if he had just rolled out of bed and apparated here. Once he saw it was Harry and Hermione, he smiled.
Harry - Firewhiskey
Granger raised her hands to her face and groaned. Draco felt like doing the same.
“Sorry, I can’t. It’s not personal, it’s the rules of the Ministry.”
“Sure,” Malfoy answered, and turned around to grab a bottle from the back shelves. He grabbed a glass for scotch and set it in front of Harry. “This is a special Firewhiskey, smoked by dragon fire to give it a special taste,” he said, smirking, then poured a shot into the cup.
Malfoy slammed his cup against the counter, looking down furiously at Harry.
“Fuck,” he said.
“We’re not serious, though.”
“Yeah. She’s probably there already.”
Draco turned around and poured himself a scotch. He wasn’t into most muggle things, but the few exceptions were muggle drinks, cigarettes and record players. He shot back the cup, filled another one and started working.
“Right,” Blaise sighed. “Now tell me what the fuck you’re on about.”
Draco apparated in front of his aunt’s house, in a small beach town down in East Sussex. He glanced around, admiring the house. It wasn’t much, just a two floor, three bedroom exposed brick wall with vines that slowly but surely were starting to wrap themselves around the front of the house. There was a low fence and a small walkway that led through the carefully handled gardens, which were already looking quite dead because of the cold. On the small front porch sat a rocking chair, and on it laid Jinx, Andromeda’s old, fat cat.
“What if they don’t get killed?” Draco said. “Pansy said they’re trying a less murderous approach this time. Maybe they would keep their promise, and actually let those muggleborns live.”
“Shut it, Draco. He’s still Ted’s godfather, so you’ll have to put up with him.”
“So, what is it that you want that you had to come pester me at my job?”
At that, Draco chuckled. His list of sins was enormous, and he knew he wouldn’t even finish repaying what he had done in this life.
“Malfoy, good to see you’re up,” Blaise said. “Come, sit.”
Ron and Hermione nestled on the couch while Harry went into the kitchen to grab some drinks. It was a small kitchen that barely fit a breakfast table. He kept his bottles of alcohol in a top cabinet, so he had to use the accio spell to get them. He summoned a firewhiskey and three glasses and went back to the living room.
“Keep your hood up and walk behind me. I don’t want anyone bothering us, so don’t talk to anyone,” he said, and pushed past Harry. Harry followed, feeling a little silly and very much out of place. The pub was very well decorated, dimly lit and quite crowded. The low tables surrounded by armchairs were full, yet the bar was empty.
“I’m so proud of you, Harry,” Hermione said.
“It’s Monday, October 5th 2000,” Granger said, the only other sound in the room being the quill scratching on the paper. “Present in this room for their testimony are Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson.”
“What is it?” she asked.
“Oh, right. I forgot,” Harry said, pointedly ignoring Draco’s eye rolling, then turned to Josh. “They’re with me, Josh. It’s all right.”
“I see you’ve brought the whole troupe,” he said, leaning one hand on the desk.
“‘Ello, Malfoy,” he answered. He was serving pints for two hooded men sitting on the bar.
“Good morning, prick,” Standing in front of him was Pansy, wearing one of Blaise’s shirts and possibly only her underwear underneath.
Draco and his aunt spent the whole afternoon rearranging Nymphadora’s bedroom. It wouldn’t have taken so long if it weren’t for the crying breaks Andromeda took every time she found something that reminded her of her daughter, something she should’ve probably expected, since it was her daughter’s bedroom after all.
The thing is, Harry had bought this house thinking that they would all live together. In the end, Hermione wanted her own place and not to share anything with two other guys, and Ron had stayed at the Burrow because Molly couldn’t bear another kid leaving her.
“Maybe, but we don’t know who works there. We know who the owner is, but that means we’ll have to wait for closing time to talk to him.” Hermione said.
He got back 2 hours later. He was sweating beneath his jumper, and the cold air was hurting his lungs, but it felt good to run off his intrusive thoughts. When he ran, he didn’t allow himself to think of anything bad, just the good things from the past and daydreams about his future. It was his daily medicine.
They arrived at the meeting room just in time, and the Head Auror hadn’t even arrived yet. Harry, Ron and Hermione sat beside each other on one side of the table. A few more Aurors filed in, and soon came the Head Auror, an old, black man named Will Johnson, who was probably going to retire as soon as they found a substitute.
“I know, Malfoy,” she answered. Ginny hopped off the table and grabbed her bag. “Hit me up again if you want to talk more about your repressed gay feelings. I like this side of you. You should show it more.”
“Daco,” Ted said, reaching to touch the top of Draco’s head and grabbing onto a fistful of hair. The kid’s ends started getting lighter, reaching the same colour as his big cousin. Ted still couldn’t change his entire hair or any features, but he was learning more and more each day.
“Aw, you brought your cousin!” Pansy said as Draco stepped out of the fireplace. She extended her arms and grabbed Ted from Draco’s arms. Blaise was still awkwardly holding on to the baby bag but didn’t complain.
“Ditto.”
At the far end of the room sat the old, worn, light pink couch, and a muggle contraption called a TV (which Andromeda loved) placed right across from it. On the ancient, persian-styled rug in between the couch and TV, stood little Teddy surrounded by his toys. His hair was sand-coloured that day, just like his late dad’s. He was watching the morning cartoons and jumping up and down to the beat of the songs when he turned around and saw Draco. Ted opened a big, toothless smile and waddled over to his cousin, extending his arms and asking to get picked up.
“I thought the orphans were being sent to Hogwarts,” Blaise said.
“What’s your name, boy?” Blaise asked. He dropped the bag down at his feet and leaned on the desk.
“Could you describe the Spectre to us?” Potter asked.
“You’re a terrible liar. Tell me, I can help you.”
Xavier, the other member, was a small, scrawny man. He had brown hair and brown eyes, with an incredibly common face, and was as quiet as a mouse. And that was his advantage. He could blend in a crowd and no one would notice. Harry once saw him meddle himself into a small group of friends that didn’t notice he wasn’t part of the group. Xavier could listen to things no one could.
“Nothing I haven’t seen before,” Pansy said, but stood up and left anyway.
He then realized he was almost at the filter of the cigarette, so he stashed it into his cigarette butt box and lit another. Smoking was a habit he caught in Hogwarts, when a muggleborn Ravenclaw boy he was hooking up during his fifth year with offered him one. They smoked in the abandoned classrooms in the middle of the night, in between messy kisses and lots of groping. They never went further, since Draco was still exploring his sexuality and chickened out when the boy kneeled in front of him and started fumbling with his pants. Draco knew if he took that step he wouldn’t be able to go back to pretending with girls, so he just left. The boy tried talking to him again, but Draco ignored him.
“Are you sure it’s safe to tell the Aurors? While I want this to end, I don’t fully trust them,” Draco said, crossing his leg over his knee.
“Look, here’s the thing. It’s okay for you to like boys and girls. Completely fine. But what’s not okay is for you to toy around with the girl’s feelings while you have someone else on your mind,” she said. She almost looked pitiful while staring at him.
It was around 2am when Harry heard a knock on the door. He clumsily stood up, drunk with alcohol and sleep. He hadn’t drank much, but he got easily messed up. He reached the door and peeked in the hole. Harry quickly undid his locks and wards, his fingers trembling. It had been so long. He swung open the door.
Draco huffed. “Can we talk somewhere private?”
“I did,” Draco said, realizing his mistake. “Listen, Ginevra. We can’t meet up anymore. We can’t be seen together. If the wrong person finds out, this could go very badly for you. And I don’t want that. I’ll take this secret friendship of ours to the grave. I promise.”
He saw Malfoy hesitate, and heard him whisper Lumos. The light of his wand shone dimly down the dark alley.
Draco chuckled dryly, his mouth turning up into a scowl. The group stopped laughing to look at him.
“I said yes. I don’t know what got into me, Draco. Your mother and I haven’t spoken in years.”
“Are you still working at that pub in Knockturn Alley?” She asked.
“We’re going with you tomorrow to tell Potter and his idiot friends what we know,” Pansy said. He noticed she had thrown on a pair of leggings. So she had clothes. What was that in my room about?
One day Draco had walked out onto the courtyard just to find Ginny was nowhere in sight. He walked down to the greenhouse in the hopes of finding her there. And there the girl was. She was sitting on her usual table, her hair disheveled, her eyes red and puffy and cheeks tear stained.
“You seen those tossers over there?” Tom asked, pointing his sausage-like finger to the group of ex-Death Eaters Draco had seen when he arrived.
“He knows what to do, don’t worry,” she said, walking out the door and grabbing her suitcase. “Be safe, Draco. Love you!”, with that, she vanished.
“Hello, dear,” she said, stretching her arms out and pulling Draco into a hug. She smelled of sea-breeze, cookies and home. She pulled away and her smile melted into a frown. “We’ve missed you! Are you that busy that you couldn’t find time for your family?” Andromeda said.
He stayed there in shock for a couple of minutes. His dream had come true. Ever since Professor McGonagall had told him he had the vocation to become an Auror, Harry dreamed of a future of peace and fighting for justice. And then his dream had become true, he had gotten a job as an Auror. And it was getting even better. He would be able to transform that place, the way he had wanted to ever since he stepped in there.
“Okay,” Ginny answered, eyeing him warily. “Meet me at the abandoned greenhouse. I don’t want people to see us together.”
Harry was already halfway out the door, smacking Ron on the back of the head. He turned around and walked up to his boss. The old man was leaning against the table, his arms crossed, yet his expression was neutral.
“I don’t know, Malfoy. Harry’s a lovely person and I’ve always liked him. I think deep down I was never over him.”
“Knock it off, Pansy,” Draco scolded.
“We can ask to talk only to the three of them. They’re idiots, but we know how they’re always in it for the good,” Blaise said.
“Malfoy. They’re meeting in public places. It’s already big.”
“I-I’m sorry sir, but I can’t allow you to see him without an appointment.”
“Come on, now. Let’s not fight. Frederick here didn’t mean to offend,” said the man with the hand full of rings.
“Traitor,” a witch hissed as she passed. “Go back to the hole you crawled out of.”
“Blaise and I are kind of a package deal,” Draco answered. “And Pansy has decided to join us too,” he added after receiving a smack on the arm.
“I’d sure like this place if I didn’t have daddy’s money anymore,” the man with the family rings answered. The whole group laughed along with him.
“Oh shit, that’s today? I completely forgot.”
“Well, I’m gonna start from the beginning,” Harry said, looking around to see if anyone was listening. “We’ve heard of the meetings that have been happening here, Malfoy. Only thing is, this place is actually quite secretive, so we didn’t even know who worked here. We were just waiting for someone to come out,” he continued, taking another sip from his drink.
“Which gets me to my point. If you’re successful in this mission, I’ll appoint you Head Auror. You’ll be the youngest Head Auror, but I guess you’re already used to breaking records,” he said, smiling. Mr Johnson patted Harry on the back, and left the room.
“Okay, you're all set then,” Josh said, then gave back their respective wands.
The banging on his door didn’t stop, so Draco stood up and opened the door, his head pounding.
Malfoy’s face contorted into a frown. He looked down in thought, crossing his arms and holding his cup.
“You’re right. I apologise,” Draco said, lowering his head just slightly. As he turned around to leave, he heard one of the men say “heard he’s been mixing himself with that blood traitor aunt of his, the one that married a mudblood.”
Draco pulled out his cigarette case and lit one with the tip of his wand. He offered it to Ginny, who refused.
“So, how was it?” Amber asked. She had dark skin, her braided hair tied up into a ponytail full of little colourful beads. She was tall and stealthy, and was soon becoming one of the best in the Department, apart from Harry and Ron, obviously. Harry had chosen her for this mission because she was incredibly focused and a great spell caster.
“Yeah.”
“Do not speak of my aunt, you useless piece of shit,” Draco said, his wand poking into the fat man’s neck. The man’s face was turning red and he was sweating like a pig.
“No, I just don’t want Blaise walking in here and seeing this.”
“Yeah, no, it’s okay,” she said. “I think I’m gonna go back to my Harry phase.”
“I was bored. Blaise said he had some errands to run and left me here. So I thought, why not bother my old friend who has actively avoided me these past few years?”
“This is the weirdest part. Apparently, they noticed that killing off muggleborns didn’t put people on their side the last two times. So, their plans are actually to recruit muggleborns to rise against the Ministry.”
“You’ll find out soon enough. And I hope you’ll forgive me, and understand I had my reasons.”
“Well, I have to get going,” she said. “Take care of my baby. I know you’ll do great,” Andromeda reached up to kiss Draco on the cheek and give him a quick hug.
At around 4 o’clock they went downstairs to get some tea. They went outside with their mugs and sat on the chairs in the back porch, overlooking the sickly backyard, the sea a blue stain in the back, as a breeze rustled their hairs. Andromeda was wrapped in a woolen shawl to keep her skinny self warm, while Draco had spread a blanket across his own lap.
Draco sighed and waited for his water to heat. He had a massive hangover, and Pansy definitely wasn’t helping. He hopped in the shower once the temperature was perfect.
He picked up his scattered clothes, vacuumed the carpet, scrubbed the toilet and changed his sheets. Once he was done, he noticed he had nothing better to do, so he threw on a warm sweater, grabbed a hoodie and headed outside for a walk.
He met up with his team and they apparated to the Ministry. Since it was a Saturday night, the place was eerily empty. It reminded Harry of the night Sirius died. He shook his head, his heart aching from the reminder of his godfather.
“Sure. Why are you so worried, though? These people are always around.”
The team had apparated into the meeting room, which was allowed only for Aurors and the cleaning staff. They sat around the table, exhausted looks on their faces from such a long and boring stakeout.
“Malfoy,” Ron said in an unfriendly tone. Draco looked at him, seeing the resemblance with the only girl of the Weasley siblings.
“You brought Ted?” Harry asked, reaching out to grab the baby from Pansy’s arms. “How stupid are you, Malfoy?”
“Pfft, cleansing. You’re ridiculous, Malfoy,” she said, sitting on the edge of his bed. She was very obviously not wearing a bra. “Heard you’re gonna work with the Potter boy now. What’s that about?”
“Why? So you can kill me off? Threaten my family? Rip my eyes out of -”
“It’s not as easy for the rest of us as it was for you, Potter. I’m here because no one else would hire me, and I needed this job,” Malfoy said.
“Hmpf. Love is weird.”
“Potter,” he sneered, and lowered his wand.
“Most of them were. It took a while for Hogwarts to get back on track, so some of the orphans disappeared before getting called upon to attend. We never found them,” Weasley answered, his voice heavy. Draco hated this. Everything was supposed to be fine after the war ended, and still it seemed like the fight never stopped.
“Well, show your ugly face and then we’ll see,” Draco answered.
“I know it’s hard, but in our job we mustn’t let emotions get the best of ourselves. Much less some taunting from someone who clearly had inferior brain capacity,” Mr Johnson said, unfreezing Harry and Ron, who fell clumsily on the table. They scrambled to get back onto their seats. He turned to sit back down and whispered to himself “honestly, they’ll take in anyone these days.”
After being scared of liking guys and being another disappointment to his parents, he and Pansy had sex. They were each other’s firsts, and Draco had actually enjoyed it. From there, they started fucking left and right. He was so glad he didn’t like boys that he couldn’t get enough of Pansy. Until Theodore Nott joined their little group.
don’t give a shit,” Draco answered.
“Why were you running like maniacs?” he asked, taking a sip from his cup of tea.
Dromeda shook her head and stepped inside, Draco following.
After a day full of meetings and paperwork, they left for their stakeout at 7pm. Harry was leading the mission, and his group consisted of himself, Ron, and two other Aurors, Amber and Xavier. Harry and Ron would stay on one side of the pub, and Amber and Xavier on the other. They apparated into Diagon Alley, and walked all the way to Knockturn Alley, trying to blend in. Amber and Xavier were walking behind them, acting as a drunk couple, and Harry and Ron had covered themselves with their cloaks and tried to act unsuspicious. They could’ve used the Invisibility Cloak, but their approach was supposed to be peaceful, so a surprise attack would do no good.
“Hey, Weasley girl,” Draco said, strutting up to where the redhead was laying on the bench in the courtyard, her eyes shut. She didn’t move. “Redhead freak,” he said again, poking her in the shoulder.
“What makes you think they’ll talk? They’re probably terrible people for working at a place that hosts anti-muggleborn meetings. They’ll hide what they know, I’m sure of it,” Peter said.
Malfoy looked around, still unsure. But he opened the back door, and followed Harry into the pub.
“Malfoy, you’re a great kid, and you know I have nothing but respect for you and your family. But you’re going over the limit,” Tom said, hauling up Draco to stand straight. “You drink yourself stupid every night, and you’re wasting your life working here.”
Draco stood in the middle of the living room, looking at Ted as he walked around the place. He shook his head, the chaotic energy of his aunt still hanging around the room. Blaise walked out, only to see the small chaos Andromeda had left behind.
“Evening, Tom,” Draco said.
He shook the memory out of his head since it made his heart clench. He hated the way his parents had raised him. When Draco joined Voldemort, he always knew something wasn’t right, but at the same time, it made his parents proud in a way they had never been, so it felt so good going home to them and getting praised.
; the first secrets Draco had really learned how to keep as a child. It was through Harry that he finally learned that coveting things could be painful. That
The next time he rose, his mother was there beside him. She was holding his hand, rubbing a thumb across his knuckles, looking distant in thoughts until she felt the stir of Draco's hand. His head was still stuffy and aching, his stomach still roiling with nausea.
Draco suddenly recalled the books and the footprints in the library before he passed out. He remembered how red Harry’s defence textbook had been and the bright ochre of the prints on the wooden planks beneath his feet.
Malfoy shrugged. “I understand. You were trying to impress Puddlemere United,” he said. “I think it worked.” He jutted his chin up, looking at something over Harry’s shoulder.
Ron snorted, adjusting his grip on his backpack strap as they pointedly ignored the calls of Harry’s name, heading towards the Potions classroom. “Your hair
Malfoy nodded grimly, dropping his gaze to the floor. Harry suspected that was the end of the conversation, so he finally made his way onwards to send the letters before Hedwig went off for her nightly hunt.
just that. I wanted to ask you about the scouts coming to the match this weekend.”
Harry laughed bitterly, humourlessly. “Oh, the right thing, was it? Your idea of the right thing was to go and snitch to McGonagall about my own personal issues even when we aren’t even friends?”
Harry’s head swam with hundreds of questions as he marched up to the Transfiguration teacher’s office as fast as he could. His heart was racing by the time he got to her office, discomfort and confusion clouding his thoughts. Swallowing a lump in his throat, he raised his uninjured hand and knocked three times on her door.
Malfoy yelped, diving out of the way with wide eyes. Harry pushed forwards and plucked the Snitch right out of the sky, pulling to a halt with ease as he thrust his fist in the air and the stands exploded in cheers.
Harry groaned, burying his face in his hands. “It’s just Puddlemere United,” he grumbled. “The manager is coming to watch the next match. I’d kill to play for them.”
He very pointedly did not look back over his shoulder to see Malfoy’s dejected look as he stood alone in the corridor.
“Professor, I don’t know what Malfoy told you, but he was lying,” Harry insisted as they made their way up the stairs. “I really did just fall on the steps badly. Honest.”
All he wanted was to be alone for once. He was sick to death of people going on and on about the match and Quidditch and the scouts and his dad’s talent and everyone’s expectations for him to live up to his father’s legacy or even surpass it. His dad’s voice echoed around his mind with all his words of encouragement and constant urges to try harder, growing louder and louder in his mind until all other thoughts blurred to silence. The letter from PU was etched into his memory like a tattoo on his eyelids, his mind circling with the contents of the letter and the many other letters he kept receiving regarding his Quidditch career until his head was spinning.
“Really?” Harry blurted, unable to hold his tongue.
Harry scoffed, scrambling to his feet using his uninjured hand. “You’re fucking ridiculous. I can’t believe I even told you that,” he snapped, shaking his head.
His voice trailed off and he fiddled with a loose thread in his school robe, holding back tears. “I didn’t even realise what was happening. Everyone was asking me and starting rumours about getting scouted. I was just so anxious about the match and I couldn’t think straight and I felt like I was about to burst out of my body and I just—I just punched the mirror as hard as I could,” he murmured. “I just wanted it all to stop.”
Professor Blair started working at Hogwarts shortly after Harry’s parents finished school, after the retirement of Professor Slughorn. She was the exact stereotype that Muggles might think of when they thought of witches with her long dark hair, sweeping black robes and a pointed hat, standing over potions cauldrons all day. She was a fierce and strict professor who took points off regardless of house affiliations and never tolerated any misbehaviour or backtalk.
Slowly, Harry’s head began to clear and his heart rate slowed to a much more normal speed. With that came a great flood of embarrassment as he took in their situation, both sitting on the floor of a lavatory after Malfoy helped him down from some sort of asthma attack. Now that he was no longer fearing for his life or completely breaking down from anxiety, Harry felt the full extent of the pain in his hand, wincing and hissing between his teeth. He lifted his hand up gingerly to inspect the damage.
“Harry…” Malfoy walked slowly up behind him, getting in his space until he crowded him against the wall. Harry winced away, but relaxed minutely as Malfoy merely rested his forehead against the jut of his neck. “You have to breathe or you’re going to pass out.”
Harry’s resolve broke at the use of his childhood nickname, born of his dad’s animagus form he took to help Remus during full moons as a child. He avoided his parents’ looks and stared at the floor as he admitted, “Because of all the expectations! I was just so sick of how much everyone expects from me. You want me to be like you, Dad, to go on and be the next best Quidditch legend and everyone else expects the same because I’m your son,” he explained, forcing himself to look at his dad. “Everyone’s always staring at me and cornering me asking me about you or asking me about whether I’m as good at Quidditch as you and everyone’s always spreading rumours about me. Girls keep trying to spike me with love potions so they can shag the James Potter lookalike—” Lily and James both flinched in horror. “—and you write to me all the time about how I can improve at Quidditch and you visit me at my practices to hound me about it and I’ve got all this pressure on me from the different scouts to be just as good as you…”
Harry nodded tightly.
Harry shot one final glare over his shoulder and turned back around to his seat, ignoring Hermione’s chastising glare in his direction.
Madam Pomfrey huffed, but made no further comment about his terrible attempt at lying. She finished healing his hand to the best of her abilities in silence, leaving Harry with some rather minor bruises and a couple of scars from the deeper of the cuts.
“It was an accident,” Harry insisted. “Malfoy hates me. He’s just trying to—”
“I’ll explain later. I promise,” he said in an undertone before turning to his teammates as a whole. “Right, everyone. Just remember our drills we went over the last few weeks and just how much we’ve all worked to get to this point. You’re going to do brilliantly.”
“Will you?”
“Oh, that was so good, Harry!” exclaimed James as he neared. “Did you have fun?”
As soon as he was finished with the letters and his homework for the next day, Harry slipped them into his backpack, slinging a strap over his shoulder and heading in the direction of the owlery to deliver the messages to Hedwig.
Naturally, because of this, she was Harry’s least favourite professor.
“So, you accidentally punched the floor as you tried to catch your fall?”
In the end, Harry managed to get the Snitch right under Malfoy’s nose.
“—let your hand rest!” interrupted Madam Pomfrey sternly. “Look, I’m sorry, Potter, but that’s final. You’ll risk irreversible damage if you overwork your hand too soon. And then you’d really be unable to play Quidditch. For good.”
And then he led them out onto the field to the roaring crowds above. He caught sight of his parents up in the staff box with Remus and Sirius and Peter Pettigrew, all dressed in Gryffindor colours. He also spotted the Puddlemere manager, dressed in formal dress robes in the Puddlemere United blue, eyes instantly clocking onto Harry as he moved to the centre of the field to shake hands with the Slytherin captain.
“Forgive me, Professor, but I find that difficult to believe,” said Harry, crossing his arms.
Malfoy sighed. “Will you do it again?”
Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Harry landed on the pitch with the rest of his teammates, propping his broomstick on one shoulder and moving to help Demelza Robins and Ginny Weasley with putting away the practice balls in the trunk. He was just securing one of the bludgers, laughing at Ginny’s impression of their Transfiguration teacher when he heard someone near the stands calling his name.
As the school year went on, between Quidditch practices, N.E.W.T level homework, duelling club and classes, Harry was run almost ragged with anxiety, dread and exhaustion. He had almost no free time with almost daily Quidditch practices and co-running the bi-weekly duelling club meetings with Neville and the growing piles of exam prep. What little time he did have was largely occupied by helping Hermione in her house elf rights group or planning upcoming practices or duelling club meetings.
“I know, Dad. That’s why I couldn’t face telling you,” Harry replied, pulling back a bit so he could look his dad in the eye. “I didn’t want to disappoint you guys.”
Harry turned to go, but once again, Malfoy grabbed his arm before he could get very far. He turned to glare over his shoulder and pulled away again, but he paused at the hopeless, hurt expression crossing Malfoy’s face. He’d never seen anything but a neutral, laughing or sneering look on Malfoy and it was disarming to see him so downtrodden. His heart clenched oddly with what Harry refused to register as pity.
Regardless, he did indeed turn around in his seat just to glare at the Slytherin boy.
“I wonder what they could possibly be staring at,” Harry deadpanned to his best friend and fellow Gryffindor Quidditch player, Ron Weasley after noticing yet another huddle of kids staring at him in awe. “I haven’t got something on my face, have I? Something in my teeth?”
Harry smiled tearfully, looking back and forth between his two parents. What a mess they all made, all three of them crying in Professor McGonagall’s office as she awkwardly listened in. “I do love Quidditch, Dad. I just—I’m not sure I want to start doing it professionally so soon. I’ll never be exactly like you and maybe we should stop trying to make it that way,” said Harry, bumping James’ shoulder.
However, he was easily the most known in both Hogwarts and the wizarding world for his dad and namesake, James Potter, the world-renowned Chaser for the English national team. He took England to the Quidditch World Cup on 3 different occasions and scored more goals than any other English player in history by the time he was barely 25, having only started playing professionally when he was 21 after a brief (and disastrous) stint training as an Auror. Even though he retired when Harry was 8, his name was still constantly splashed across the newspapers, including winning the Witch’s Weekly Most Charming Smile award twice, making him a household name even almost a decade after retiring to take care of his family and settle down.
“Sorry about that,” said Harry. “The Snitch was right above you and I couldn’t take the chance of losing it.”
But Harry cut her off, tearing his hand from her grasp. His stomach plummeted and he felt his heart skip several beats. “But what about the match? I can’t miss the match, I’ve got someone coming from Puddlemere United to see me play!” he exclaimed, voice going shrill. “I’ll be really careful before the match! But I can’t possibly miss it, Madam Pomfrey!”
“For what?”
They had another match against Ravenclaw in less than a week’s time and Harry’s mind kept trailing to the letter he received that morning from Puddlemere United; the manager from PU was coming to watch his next match to make a decision about scouting him. Ever since he opened the pale blue envelope with the navy blue seal, in classic Hogwarts fashion, the entire school was buzzing about the news, someone having let slip the details of the letter at breakfast. Harry kept getting hounded once again by his peers all day, asking if the rumour was true and somehow coming up with the most far-fetched details such as him dropping out early to join the team or how the entire team was going to come watch him.
quite messy, to be fair,” said Ron, diving away from Harry’s sharp elbow jab.
“Will I what?”
“I had to!” Malfoy exclaimed defensively.
“Harry!” exclaimed Lily at the same time McGonagall said, “Language, Mr. Potter!”
“Why didn’t you tell us you felt that way?” asked James at last, breaking the silence. “If I knew how much you felt the pressure, I never would have…”
Malfoy huffed, folding his arms over his chest and cocking a single slender, pale eyebrow, giving Harry his signature sneer. “Don’t play stupid with me, Potter. Even if that’s the only way you know how,” he snapped. He interrupted Harry before he could comment. “You know perfectly well, Potter. Are you going to tell the truth about how you acquired your injury?”
“Thank you, sir. That’s—that’s great news. Thank you.”
“You could never disappoint us, sweetheart,” cooed Lily, stroking his hair again. “We just want you to be happy.”
Harry dove towards Malfoy, slapping a hand over his mouth as his voice echoed around the empty hallway too loud for his liking. His heart skipped strangely at the sensation.“Quiet! You don’t have to shout about it,” he retorted, dragging his hand away before Malfoy could shove it off. “Nobody can know the truth, alright? You can’t tell anyone. My friends will just worry about me and never trust me by myself for fear of it happening again and my parents will be so upset they’ll probably send me to a Mindhealer or something.”
Harry remembered way too late that the Captain was none other than the one person he had been avoiding for the last few weeks.
Harry’s heart raced once again, but at least this time it was because he was snogging the life out of his school rival instead of another panic attack. He knew he would have to tell his friends and family about everything that happened in the last few weeks with Draco, but for now, he was just happy to lose himself in his kisses.
“Er, yeah, maybe…” He cleared his throat, coming to a stop at the end of the corridor near the entrance to the Gryffindor tower. “But anyway, I should really get to the common room. I’ve still got to finish that essay Remus set me about basilisks.”
Harry grabbed his wrist as soon as he caught up to him, pulling him sideways out of the path of people going up to the castle. Draco yelped in surprise, stumbling as Harry dragged him unceremoniously away from public view.
At the end of Harry’s rambling speech, the room fell into an uncomfortable silence. It was only broken by Lily’s occasional sniffles as she cried into a hanky and James reached across Harry to rub his hand up and down her back. McGonagall watched Harry over the top of her spectacles with a concerned and alarmingly delicate expression.
That evening, tucked away in a secluded corner of the library, Harry wrote a series of notes to give to his owl Hedwig to deliver. The first was a letter to Puddlemere United to explain that he would have to reschedule the match due to ‘unforeseen injuries’ and the second—and much more difficult—letter was to his parents to explain the situation as well. He was already dreading the response from his parents at getting himself injured mere days from what could have been one of the most important matches of his school career.
Malfoy shot him an unreadable look while Professor Lupin simply grew even more suspicious. Madam Pomfrey tutted once again.
Harry almost wished he was getting a telling off from her.
“You’re such an asshole, Malfoy. This is why I’ve never liked you.” He shoved past Malfoy, heading for the stairs.
“Well, yes, but then I couldn’t gush with you about who it is!”
“What is it, Dad?” he asked, stepping back from the hug and forcing a smile as the three of them started towards the castle together.
Harry and Malfoy stepped to the centre of the field, right in front of each other. Harry swallowed a lump in his throat and held his hand out to shake Malfoy’s hand after only a short hesitation. Malfoy nodded stiffly, taking his hand in a tight, but not uncomfortable grasp. His hand was surprisingly soft despite the callouses, warm and gentle as a hug. Harry barely got to enjoy it before he was pulling away and they were getting in their positions for the match to start.
“You told them?” Harry choked, pointing at Malfoy with a shaking hand.
Hermione gave him a skeptical look, but thankfully said nothing of how he’d practically disappeared off the face of the planet. “Professor McGonagall was looking for you at dinner. She wants to see you in her office,” she said, biting her bottom lip. She was holding back another comment, no doubt about his disappearance, but Harry didn’t give her the chance to continue.
“Ooh, so the rumour is true?” cooed Hannah, batting her eyelashes too much for Harry’s liking. She had been trying to get with Harry for at least two years now, flirting with him in increasing strength so that Harry was almost always blushing when she was around. “You’re getting scouted by Puddlemere United?”
Walking down to the pitch with Ron and Ginny to get ready for the match, many people stopped Harry to wish him good luck, calling out to him as they passed them. Harry largely ignored them, merely nodding or smiling politely in acknowledgement, picking up the pace until the trio finally reached the locker rooms.
“There’s my favourite Seeker!” James exclaimed, opening his arms for one of his famous bear hugs. Harry rolled his eyes, returning the hug from his dad. He could already sense the lingering tension in the air.
“Sorry, Nev. I’m just a little distracted,” he admitted.
How was he supposed to admit that he had done it on purpose? That in a fit of some sort, Harry ended up punching a glass mirror with all his strength just to get his thoughts to stop? How could he admit that he was crumbling under all the pressure on him so much that he took it out on himself? And in such an embarrassing way, getting found by his school rival, no less.
“Harry,” Lily greeted, her voice soft and gentle as Harry reluctantly took the seat next to her. She reached out to stroke a hand through his hair, like she used to do when he was a little kid crying about something.
“Harry, what’s wrong?” asked James. “Why would you do such a thing? You can tell us anything, Prongslet.”
The skin was split open on all the knuckles and finger joints of his right hand, bright red and tinged purple with bruises, blood dripping down them tos tain the edges of his white sleeves. He had several bad, deep cuts from where shards of the mirror sliced through the thin skin of his fist, leaving more trails of scarlet dripping down between his fingers onto the floor and his robes. The mirror where he punched had a long crack going from top to bottom as well as a jagged, uneven dent where his fist collided with it, the edges stained with Harry’s blood. The sink was full of shards of bloody glass as well. Harry felt his pulse racing in his various injuries, which throbbed with agony as they continued to bleed.
By the time he got to the common room and slipped inside to join his friends on one of the couches, his heart was still racing and he felt positively sick with dread for the upcoming match and the growing pressure to live up to his father’s legacy.
However, just as he was making his way up the first set of stairs between the library and the owlery side of the school, someone called his name from down the steps. He froze, one foot hovering over the next step, stomach dropping like a stone as he recognised that voice. How could he not? It was the voice that had plagued all of his dreams the previous nights, the voice that taunted and argued with him from the age of 11 and rarely ever relented.
The match itself was a huge success for Harry. The second he shot up into the air, he felt all of his worries of the last few weeks fading away to a distant blur, feeling the rush of the air as he soared through the sky. Ron was his usual excellent self, saving goal after goal from the Slytherin side and only missing a few of the more difficult ones while the Chasers—particularly Ginny—kept scoring on the Slytherin hoops and using all the new formations they worked on. Harry flew around the field, keeping an eye out for the Snitch while listening to the commentary from Neville. He even managed a particularly impressive Wronski Feint, diving in the opposite direction with Malfoy hot on his tail, pulling up at the last second and zooming back in the opposite direction.
As much as Harry adored playing Quidditch, using it to calm himself down and as an excellent excuse for late homework or an alibi for pranks gone wrong, Harry was growing antsy by the time he made it to school that September. His dad was sending him daily letters with tips and reminders to ‘enhance’ his skills and help with his captaincy and even more people were beginning to ask him about the rumours of playing professionally as soon as he left school. He could feel the pressure beginning to mount as the end of his schooling finished and he would have to make an official decision. It was barely the second week of school and he already had people asking him about it.
“You’ll be fine, Harry,” Hermione assured him for what felt like the millionth time already since getting to school. “There’s no pressure to make a decision right now.”
Harry cut off the rest of his remark by grabbing the back of his neck with his free hand and dragging him closer, pressing his forehead against Draco’s. Draco inhaled sharply, freezing for a moment. Harry was about to pull away, fearing he had misjudged the situation when Draco closed the gap between them, kissing him. He dropped Harry’s hand to wrap his arms around his neck, pulling Harry closer and deepening the kiss. Harry kissed back fervently, up on his toes and deepening the kiss.
“OF COURSE I DON’T WANT TO BE LEFT HERE!”  Malfoy screamed, standing up swiftly, finally looking at those green eyes he hated so much.
After a little while without Draco speaking, Harry continued: “You strike me as a guy who can never be satisfied. You never had control over anything in your life. Your father decided everything”, Harry took Draco’s left arm in his hand and started slowly stroking his mark. “Then, Voldemort took over and it got even worse. But now! You had me to control, I thought that now you finally had something in your life your could control, it would never be enough, and it would always get worse and worse every time you got bored with your last idea on how to torture me.”
“1…” Harry started counting.
Harry was hard in his pants, not having a clue when or more importantly why it had happened. The green-eyed boy instincts proved once more way more intelligent than he was, after catching up on the other’s boy arousal and reacted appropriately. Their pricks apparently understood each other a lot better than their brains did.
Harry was sitting cross-legged with his arms behind his head, waiting for the deliberation in the other’s man head to end, his own guard totally down.
Instantly, the beautiful stag started bouncing right towards Granger, having its desired effect and completely baffling her for just the slip second it took to quickly cast a disarming charm.
So Draco went to get off the couch, he just couldn't stay amongst them all. But the second he started moving, Hermione Granger went and sat on the same couch he was.
It had felt so good to put it there. To take ownership of the world’s savior’s Cock. To deny him orgasms. To fuck him senseless all the time and not give a shit about his pleasure.
“Awww, I gather you can be kinda cute for a snake”, the redhead Gryffindor uttered quite loudly as an answer.
Hermione smiled as well at the same moment. The Slytherin couldn’t believe was he was hearing from his two Gryffindor counterparts. It really sounded like they would both be okay with him actually
“I came today in case they question us separately. To make sure we tell the exact same thing,” he explained, finally sitting down on the uncomfortable metal chair facing Malfoy.
Narcissa had saved his life.
“I don’t know that either. It felt like you got scared because I was in pain and didn’t want me to run away and end this.”
“You git! You cast Protego !! ('Non verbally at that, impressing', he thought) It’s like admitting I was right in the first place!” Harry managed to utter with difficulty, quickly loosing his breath because of the rapid dancing.
Draco hadn't spoken a single word since this madness started. Why could he say? He gazed at Potter, still sitting with the big group. The broom story still wasn't over. It was the Weasley twins who had cursed it. He should have guessed. They were now on the fact that Potter actually saw a broom nearly taking Dumbledore's head off in third year. Apparently, the old wizard had found that encounter hilarious. "Yes, it
"You didn't have to say yes Draco, why did you?" Hermione insisted.
“You don’t have to do that, wait!”, Harry panicked, sitting up and moving up the bed, as to escape him.
He then began to explain the rules without noticing how little his students were listening.
His first response would have been to say something mean and obnoxious (old habits die hard), so he just glared at Ron with sheer horror. When the Gryffindor boy grumbled a very loud "What??", Draco took a quick glance at Granger and was relieved to see the same disgust in her eyes. But since she is a nice person, she just calmly said: "You know Ronald, I’m pretty sure that meal was made to be shared with, you know, everyone here." Ron shrugged and took an even bigger bite. Granger was shaking her head, but her eyes held nothing but tenderness for her boyfriend.
Harry immediately thought about stupefying him like Malfoy had just threaten to do but didn’t think it would make his point. The new spell,
“I wouldn’t have minded Malfoy; I’m surprised you didn’t do it before today though.” Harry said, shrugging his shoulders, then circling his body with his arms.
Draco was not okay. Ever since that night in the tower, Potter had been in every single one of his thoughts. Draco was just realising now that his obsessing on the word NO was over. All it took was a five minutes conversation with the savior and everything had changed. It was clear to the blond now; he had just replaced an obsession with another. His guilt and anger and mostly shame was still very much in place in his head. The only difference was the coping mechanism he used to go through everyday life. Harry couldn’t become his crutch. All that boy wanted was to suck a few cocks because an evil maniac prevented him to do so for years.
savior’s Cock, that he had so easily caged. How the hell did they get there???
“Cursed broom story finally over?” Draco wondered after Harry had sat down next to him.
“Well no, but you know, it was…?
The Gryffindor was not the kind to notice the signs a moment like that was pointing at him. The cold and warm light both illuminating his school rival as to show him he had two sides to him could have been obvious to an analytical mind, but it was not to Harry.
They were once again in the room of requirement, a couple weeks later, and Draco was currently pounding the savior’s ass quite roughly, which was not uncommon. Although, it was the first time the Gryffindor had ever complained of any pain or discomfort in all those months of their arrangement. He had always willingly offered his ass for a hard shag; when he was not sucking the Slytherin’s Cock in an alcove between classes.
But the second they stepped into Hogwarts again, all of that was abruptly forgotten.
“I told you, I never intended to hurt you like that, it was an accident.”
“I never meant to hurt your feelings Malfoy, you’re right I wanted you out of your funk… I thought your reaction would be to try and break my nose again to be honest. The prom king usually doesn’t like to be chatted up by other blokes. I don’t know why I hurt you exactly, but I’m sorry. And I know it was a ruse, but I actually meant it” he blabbed, getting red in the face.
“You’re being serious, aren’t you?”
Because they let
“You do know I share all the classes you’re enrolled in, don’t you Potter? For that reason, I’m perfectly aware that charm’s class doesn’t start for 45 minutes. Besides, we should really milk your prostate, it has been a week. We should empty those balls”, Draco observed, now lying on his side, his head resting on his right hand, looking completely relaxed from his recent orgasm.
“Maybe.” He managed to answer, shaking his head, displaying a giant grin.
whatever your father taught you to be. But don’t think I don’t see how you act when you think no one else is looking: drinking tea, wearing a thousand scarves and reading weird and overly complicated arithmancy books. You’re like a shy hipster Ravenclaw nerd.” Harry demonstrated, leaving Draco speechless.
It was a still night. Back in the eight-year common room, he could see through the high windows the usually windy Scotland countryside being as calm as can be. The cold November full moon illuminated the whole room, and he could see as clear as in the light of day.
“And do you like that shy nerd? Or do you prefer your Dom for hire?”, Draco asked, his eyes drifting down, letting is inner shyness show openly for once.
Harry just frowned, like he was saying: ‘
“That’s who I am Harry. You run into things, I run from them. Maybe it makes us the perfect match. Maybe the perfect storm. The only thing you can count on is that
He caught Potter’s eye in the crowd, and it hit him. Wow, that was a bad idea. There was no coming back from it. But it was a guarantied win.
Potter was crying. Although it wasn’t that easy to properly tell the difference, something in his eyes made Draco believe that Harry wasn’t crying only because of the physical pain. There was so much in his eyes. So much more than a stupid sex spell accident. But he had to make sure.
When he looked up from the ground, Potter still hadn't answered him. The green eyed boy was looking at him with a complicated look.
“How far would you have let this go, Potter?”, he cautiously inquired.
“And you never thought about asking him to teach you? He might not be the finest observer of human behavior, but he is a great teacher. I’m sure he would accept.”
No, what would have been the real bold move, would had been to admit how he really felt. Thankful, grateful, promising of stopping to be an arsehole prat, scared that he would never be able to repay his depth.
"Makes sense", Weasley nodded. Draco looked at him with a scared and questionable look. So Ron continued: "Well you've both been obsessed with each other since forever, and now have no reason whatsoever to hate each other, so those feelings had to change into something else, and it turned into flirting or whatever you two have now. I'm just saying it's logical. "
“No, I won’t kill Dumbledore.”
Draco swiftly took a few steps back and added: “And no dry anal sex! Ever. Hard limit.”
His eyes still fixed on them, Draco whispered: "I don't know Granger, like you said, it's complicated." Hermione nodded and you could see in her eyes she was pondering what best to say to comfort and guide the Slytherin. But yet again, Ron was quicker. "Do you think about him when you wank?"
“So what do you suggest?”
Deep in thought, he didn't notice Weasley had sat on the couch opposite him. When he came to, the first thing he noticed was the redhead biting into what could terminologically be called a sandwich, but looked more like 3 meat pies, one over the other.
Potter appeared to be a little drunk. How did he knew he was always on the tower? Why was he here with him, if there was a party? The saviour looked like he was perfectly happy standing there with him in the night.
be scared every step of the way.”
“You wanna dance Potter? Very well, let me show you how it’s done.”
Draco knew his eyes were pleading, begging and full of despair. He knew it but he couldn't care less. He needed Potter to say the proverbial word and he needed it now. But the boy who lived to be a pain in his ass now looked annoyed. He clearly couldn't give him his blessing. Potter looked at the door like he was about to leave. Then suddenly, he took a big breath, turned over, walked quickly towards the blond and
The Slytherin was leaning on the edge of the astronomy tower, like he always was nowadays, when he didn’t
Harry felt like he should be adamant on the fact he was fine. But Malfoy wanted to talk, maybe he could convince him to keep him after the end of the year. After he convinced him to cage his Cock again.
Harry smiled. Nodded. Stopped flirting. He walked to Draco once more. Took his left hand in his. “Wanna go for a walk then? It’s beautiful outside. Smells like spring.”
Every time Draco thought about him, the space under his ribs burned, with shame, guilt, and hatred. Then there was a deep yearning under it all, dark and twisted and futile.
"That doesn't make it okay." Draco's frown deepens. "Harry, you were a
Draco snorts a laugh. He has a beautiful laugh, when it's not cold or mocking, when it's warm and open and genuine. "Why so tense, Harry? Do cuddles frighten the big strong Saviour of the Wizarding World? Have we finally found something even worse than You-Know-Who to you?"
The whole lesson, Draco was restless and distracted, which was probably why he found himself nigh on stalking Granger once the lesson had finished. It was also why now Draco had just tapped Granger’s shoulder and was flailing under her rightfully confused gaze.
and it was grim. So, when Draco read his own name, he cringed appropriately as his misdeed towards Harry was recorded in excruciating detail. He read how Harry hated him, righteously.
Harry snorted. “Nah
He could only hear his own body’s thrumming.
?" Harry blinks, startled. His brows furrow together, his eyes wide.
Draco halted himself, now feeling distinctly like he was on shaky ground.
Suddenly, Harry then took a hold of Draco’s face between his palms and gave him a look which said
Harry dropped the stirring rod he’d been holding, and it landed with a wet splash into the cauldron. Ron yelped at the brew that had just landed on his uniform.
Draco’s attention was drawn back to the ring and the geode it bore. There was a strange buzzing sensation in Draco’s fingers as he touched it. That feeling grew stronger when he put it on his finger.
Draco peered up from beneath wet lashes. His breath trembled as he took in the welcome sight before him.
Draco was just walking to the library. He wasn’t doing anything wrong.
"Eight forty-four, sir," Harry answered back cheekily.
Pushing on the door like a dead man walking, Harry tried to keep his back straight and his shoulders back, even though he wanted to crawl into the class – that way Snape might not see him.
There was a pull in his chest, then, stretching taut the swollen bruise that was his heart. He could not explain what it was that kept him there, what kept him sitting there on his knees for longer than he knew, fixated on the framed picture of Potter's face until his eyes blurred from something he couldn't name. Potter was smiling in the picture, the ebony curls of his hair tousled and wild, falling against the hinge of his glasses. His eyes were green, brilliant and somehow even greener than the soft and slow sway of the grass nettles around Draco. The dried autumn leaves clinging to branches dropped like rain, landing, amassing the ground.
Harry rolled up his sleeve, baring it. Draco still didn’t look, didn’t need to look. He knew the mark inside and out, how it would withe limply without its master, the greyish pallor of it where once it had been so dark it looked like you could sink your fingers into it.
it admitted.
"Well. There was Mrs. Figg, sometimes. But I didn't particularly like it with her. She smelled awful."
That sadness often resulted in Potter then staring right back at Draco again, his mouth opening as if he wished to say something, then a frustration when again he realised he couldn’t.
to save Potter.
Sneaking into Gryffindor Tower was laughably easy, and terribly anticlimactic.
He can, maybe. Maybe he can just reach out a hand, curl it around his bicep and tug at him and pull him in, and Draco will follow his cue, will give him what he's asking for. Harry knows he will, knows he'll never stop him. Some day he'll learn to reach out and take his hand first, and pull him against himself with an arm around him, and kiss him first, all without a thought, with an ease and comfort that's as natural as breathing, but maybe it starts here, now, learning to. It's all he wants to do, all he wants to learn in that moment.
"Or rather straightforward," Ginny agrees. "I just wish she was a little more straightforward about this."
"I’m so unfit," he wheezed as he flew down the steps to the dungeons. "I can’t be
Draco comes forward and sits beside him slowly, his shoulder brushing against Harry's. Harry forces himself to relax against him.
Then Draco spied a lone line of steps branching off from the mess of the field. It reached into the Forbidden Forest and disappeared under its foreboding canopy.
Potter smiled, though it's still a sad, downturned thing. He stepped forward and motioned for Draco to move his legs in the aisle so he could sit in the seat directly opposite Draco.
Draco rolls his eyes, but he doesn't say anything before he whips around and starts to walk, robes sweeping around at his ankles.
He shook his head, blinked, a brief flash of black before the world came into his vision again. But there was no Potter here. No Potter anywhere. He was gone. Draco's head swivelled around, dizzy and light, blinking rapid and hard as he was trying to catch sight of him again. He didn't realise he was stumbling around in a frantic circle until he knocked into another body, several thumps of items dropping to the floor.
Draco’s heart was thumping. His eyes were then drawn to Harry’s lips. Even bitten and chapped, they were still his and all the more lovely for it.
He wasn’t there anymore.
Draco looked at Harry, his eyes widening when he heard his name spoken by the very same voice he wished and wished he could hear again. Then, Draco was staring at those lips again and far stranger wishes whispered in his ear.
There was one sketch of Draco in a train station, trembling against the compartment door as a dementor passed behind him through the window. Draco's cheeks flushed, mortification laying thick over him. This had actually happened. It must have been the Weasley twins who told him. Under it, it said,
Soon, they loomed over him from all sides. He took a moment to look around at the stands, making sure they were empty.
"We need to talk. Alone," Draco says, solemn and ominous, his purposeful stride coming to a stop right in front of Harry. Ron and Hermione glance up at them in bemusement, curled up together on the couch of the Gryffindor commons. He reaches for Harry's arm, stops, and then lets his hand fall. "Just. Come with me, will you?"
. "I have done half of the chapter. How much did you do?"
Their eyes locked, and Draco’s stomach swooped as if he had been caught stealing something.
“Thank Merlin, otherwise I’d have to keep suffering your rancid breath, Burns." Draco grinned toothily with a levity he didn’t feel.
Goyle got him a painkiller potion from Madame Pomfrey, settled down beside him and flipped through a magazine. It made him drowsy after a quarter of an hour, and he fell asleep on the settee, hands loosening around his Transfiguration textbook. When he woke up around evening, the pain had receded almost completely. Goyle wasn't there.
Pulling himself away from the sight, he now focused on his immediate surroundings. Pansy was flipping Blaise off after a poorly timed quip about her new haircut. Vince and Greg were hunched over beside Draco. The first was drawing patterns into the wood of the desk with the moisture of his fingers. The other was trying to reattach a shirt button that had fallen off by repeatedly pressing it against where it was once stitched.
“Your magic has been...waning Mr Malfoy.” Pomfrey began, the sombre edge to her tone made Draco turn to stare at her and a cold sensation creep up his throat.
touch him. Everything was tender, warm, and brilliantly bright. Harry’s smile, his butterfly wing kisses, and his strong arms pulling Draco into him.
Granger turned to look back at Draco, and her eyes cast over his cast, and his too-thin form.
Sharp shame hollowed Draco out.
"You. Just... you feel nice," Harry mumbles, his lips buried into the soft material covering his shoulder. "And maybe I'm sort of thinking about kissing you."
. Leaning against the doorway silently. He was loose-limbed, shoulder pushed into the stone, arms crossed over his chest as he seemed to watch Draco from afar.
"I love you," Draco rasped, tremulous and thick, into his shoulder, over and over, feeling the warmth and life of Harry's hands moving up his hair. His legs were weak, and much of his weight was just held up by Harry's arms. "I love you so much, Oh God, I–"
“There was so much to you, wasn’t there?” Draco breathed. His face crumpled. “But I didn’t get to see any of it.”
he mouthed.
"Luna," Ginny says, with a small, fond smile that she directs down at the ground. "I think she might like me too, but… you know. She's
Interest piqued, Draco dislodged his arm out from where Goyle had been drooling on it and went to pluck the book off the shelf.
Despite his thudding heart and nausea, he smiled wretchedly at his worried ghost.
"They, er... they've never really liked... they didn't like magic and they didn't like me. So they didn't like touching me." Harry snorts a small laugh, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. "I, er. I tried to hug my aunt when I was six, and she pushed me away and called me dirty. I thought she meant that I didn't bathe enough."
‘You’re not Harry. What you’re doing is the furthest thing from
“Want that too, Harry. Exactly like that.” He croaked. “Would give anything
Harry’s frown deepened before he backed away from Draco by a few steps. Draco stepped forward, worried about the expression that crossed Harry's features.
Title of the fic is taken from Billie Eilish's song "Listen Before I Go"!
And Draco Malfoy is the most beautiful boy that he's ever seen.
He kept repeating, the tendons of his next raised, as if he’d screamed it.
He began following the set at his feet. Step-for-step, he moved with them to where the print concentrated at the boy’s Quidditch locker room. His breath picked up as he entered the room, still foggy and damp from Hufflepuff's scheduled Wednesday evening practise.
It didn’t, and the tears kept coming.
Draco was enveloped with a sea of red and gold and warmth.
Listlessly, Draco turned his head to the stranger beside him, whose bed Draco was currently laying in. Pale hazel eyes stared back at him, full of hope, playful. They would have been worth staying for, so beautiful they were, if they hadn't been the wrong shade.
Romance hasn't seemed to be in the cards for him anytime soon after Ginny. He gets what he needs during sex, anyway. It's not really enough, but it fills the hollow inside of him somewhat, this odd hunger roiling beneath his skin that he doesn't know if he'll ever get rid of. He's good at going after what he wants and taking it, knows how to demand and hold his ground until they're given to him, but the things he has to ask for, he has never known how to just ask for them.
at him.  See him. He remembered him at sixteen and he remembered him at seventeen, in his Manor. In the midst of war and Death-Eaters, locked in battle with Voldemort. Wild and utterly beautiful.
‘Harry’s – it’s a Potions book both he and Snape have written in. Harry thought he had hidden it well, but I’ve always had a knack for finding lost things in lost places.’
Potter cocked his head at Draco’s stuttered question, mirthful at first, but then an odd disquiet settled over his features. It was when the downturned smile quirked at the corners of his lips that Draco knew the boy before him couldn’t answer.
“Not for long, Death Eater.” Another voice hissed above him. It was Keith Burns, a Gryffindor from his year, one that Draco hadn’t in all honesty noticed before this year. But now Draco knew Keith well, very well, his vicious streak in particular. Keith, out of all of them, was the one that made Draco feel nervous the most.
Suddenly, Draco didn't feel comfortable reading it without Harry’s permission. But Draco was always an instant gratification sort of person, and he’d rather apologise than ask permission. He wouldn’t tell a soul what he’d read. He knew he’d hold Harry’s secrets to the grave.
“No," he said. “Not quite.”
There's so much silence. Harry glances up, finally, meeting his moonstone eyes. Draco's still staring at him, but now he looks lost and angry, a line between his brows, his jaw clenched.
His steps halted jarringly. His neck was hurting from how quickly it snapped towards the small shine in a forest full of fog, shadow, and decay.
Draco stared up at the ceiling. All his body wanted was for him to cave, to stay here, until he couldn't. But he knew, if this was all he had, then he didn't want to spend it like this.

means to me.”
Draco’s mind conjured soft echoes of sound; a laugh in the Great Hall, a groan in Potions, that whoop of pure joy that had echoed out to Draco in Care of Magical Creatures, sparking an awful jealousy in him.
The dormitory erupts into uproar, a chorus of howling wolf whistles and catcalls and guffaws of laughter when Draco crawls inside onto Harry's bed, all dignified and straight-backed until he turns around on his knees and flips them all off with both hands, a thin, satirical smile on his lips, and then jerks the curtains closed to Seamus and Dean's laughing faces. He casts
“Then let them,” Draco said quietly, lest he screamed it. “They already discuss much worse things about us – being a Malfoy isn’t exactly something to be proud of.”
Without so much of a backward glance, the blonde menace
Draco stared and stared at the boy beside him, drinking his fill. Harry was younger here – sixteen and so full of life and hope that it made Draco feel old and desolate. Harey's smile and stare were the only things about him that didn’t seem somewhat fragile or awfully breakable.
“Thank you," he forced out, despite the discomfort.
“Barely," he croaked, the act of speaking causing another wave of ice-pick headache. “Too bright.” Draco attempted to growl when the mediwitch pushed his curtains opening, letting even more bleach-yellow sun in.
"I'm just sick." His voice was hoarse. He could feel Luna's eyes on him.
echoed unsaid around them. “But I wouldn’t give him up for even the happiest of lives. Because, you see, my life was meant to be his. Just his. And nothing else beyond that. Everything is draining of light and colour because it was all for him, the only reason I could behold either was to see him at my side.” Draco swallowed. “And it would’ve been magnificent. He would have shone so bright and I would have shown him how much it meant to me. How much
Dear Mr Malfoy,
That night, he woke up to Harry's hand in the dark, smoothing a knuckle down his cheek, nails running thinly at his hair, so delicate it was barely there. His other arm was around Draco's waist, legs tangled up with his, and he had that crease between his brows again, always so worried and sad, watching him silently.
He rubbed at the tender flesh of his belly where, earlier in the week, McLaggen and Co. decided to take turns trying to cave his internal organs. And they hadn’t needed an occasion to justify it then.
"I do think you're awfully sore all the time, Draco," Luna says.
Returning to the pages he’d closed in the forest, Draco quickly skimmed to find his place.
His mouth opened.
"Not to sleep, you dolt. Just lie down, will you?" Draco leans back on his arms, fixating him with an expectant expression.
Unbidden, Draco’s arm lifted and reached above him. An unknown desire pulled deep down in his stomach, and it felt wretched.
“I don’t know about that – I like to read the last page sometimes," Draco humoured her, whilst scrambling on the inside.
“They’re yours,” Draco whispered, awed. “They are
He stood staring at it, his breaths suddenly feeling quite thick in his throat.
"Yeah. Like the sea," Goyle said, shrugging. "It looks blue to me."
"Do you see him?" Her voice shook a little when she asked.
He then froze under another realisation. Taking out his wand, he realised that it too was far brighter than anything else framing it. Transfixed, Draco stared as a grin crept up on his features. This was proof that Harry had lived, that he had been here, that the earth still had him inked upon it.
So for a moment, Draco only drank the sight of him in. There were too many words all clamouring for his attention, but this vision in front of him had captured it all instead. Draco happily surrendered to it.
Seeing nothing after a while, he shrugged it off. He had completely forgotten about it until Charms. After completely misspelling his own name attempting to make a piece of chalk write across slate, Draco caught sight of the gold glint again.
“It’s all a waste. It's all a fucking
that would be heart-breaking.” He then looked up at Draco. His smile still made Draco feel so wretched. “It’s
Slowly, he looked up and halted his steps. There was a boy standing in front of him, wild-haired and round glasses, his eyes fixated on Draco's face, and he looked painfully young, unmistakably solid and real. Draco wanted to reach out, but he was afraid he'd vanish into a mist like he did the last time. He stood rooted where he was, instead, whitened fingers clenched tight and quivering around the tucked edge of his towel.
It all made Draco think back to murmurs shared between Granger and Lovegood, reaching him as he hid in a darkened alcove. They whispered and wept about the passing of their dearest friend. The pair spoke about their loss, his life, and the imminent future without him by their sides.
"Your love would have been bright; it would have been colourful," Lovegood said as her thumb caressed the back of his trembling hand.
He knew this. This had already happened before. Draco watched Greg pull at his wand and knew he was about to drop it. He was mouthing the words Blaise was about to say before he’d uttered them.
“Who shouldn’t have?” An unfamiliar voice spoke next to Draco.
He could feel more than see Harry walking silently behind him. Draco didn’t look back. He just kept moving forward with purpose as another ugly feeling bloomed in his chest.
Goyle came over and tried to get him out of bed, persistent even as Draco groaned and mumbled at him to
He tips his head at Harry whenever he passes by him in the hallways, a small smirk at one corner of his lips that has an entirely different undertone to it nowadays, one that leaves Harry nowhere near irritated and very much near something that makes his heart skip a beat.
Draco draws back, a short scowl crossing his face before his face goes flat. "You do know it doesn't work like that."
"Here," she said suddenly, thrusting the necklace into his face.
“Not here. Not really. And I want you to
Harry jerked to a stop. The door flashed in his mind like a memory, like it was something he’d seen before.
"You talked about it with me."
into the hollow of his neck, once, and twice, and then again, like it was all he knew how to say and think. All the love that was written on the walls around them, packed into the way Harry said his name. All the things he didn't have time to tell Draco, just there in his voice.
Draco's head snapped to his mother, the movement jostling him enough to crack a sharp cough from him.
He left before he could see the boy vanish again, grabbing his clothes on the way out.
It's still early morning, Draco reminded himself glibly. That meant
“I’m there," Harry said softly, just above a whisper. “I’m in here too.” He gestured to the carriage around them, and his smile was so gentle and understanding, and Draco hurt all the more because of it. “I’ll be there until it ends.”
Looking down at his feet, Draco saw how many times Harry had walked in and out of the Room of Requirement. He thought he could even see the rushed jump and skid of the last time he had closed its doors; after he had saved Draco from burning to death.
Draco licked his lips before baring his teeth to the air. A kind of rage dazed him. Everything shrank away except for the overwhelming sensation of unfairness, of losing something before he had it. He could scream, break something. He wanted to.
Thinking back, Draco remembered this book in Harry’s hand. Harry had carried it everywhere towards the end of fifth year and the whole of sixth. Draco only remembered because he had been curious about it, had burned to read what was written inside. Harry had often covered the book as he wrote in it, and if anyone tried to get a look in, he tended to throw his Stinging Hexes hard.
He regarded tremulously, holding his own arm as if it was something sacred to him. Before he could think better of it, he brought it to his lips and kissed it softly.
nervous.
The image calmed him, and Draco stopped. He took it, and he let it happen.
Harry was so close, so
It was moments like these that Draco wanted nothing more than to rage and break something. He’d woken up in a foul mood, with fouler thoughts. He wanted nothing to do with anything that was around him, and currently, that included interacting with his Mother.
Warm water stung down his back, mottled with yellowing bruises and dark scabs. This was courtesy of three seventh year boys. They blamed him for Potter’s death, saying that Draco brought the devil to the door, that he helped the madman kill their friends, family, and loved ones.
He had not had enough. He wanted to find every moment of Harry's life when he was living, all of his handprints and footprints. He wanted to find out everything about him, from when he had been here at Hogwarts, all the things he loved with his heart, what he'd thought with that clever mind of his. How he'd lived. How wonderful he'd been.
He was well liked for his witty, sarcastic humour, daring nerve that had him getting into debates with teachers too often for his own good or pranking his fellow students and his friendliness that led to befriending anyone, regardless of their own popularity. He could crack jokes that had even the teachers hiding smiles and befriended students from all four houses through running the Duelling Club to help students with spellwork. With his messy dark hair and bright green eyes, he also had students of all genders throwing themselves at his feet, trying to get a date with him. He was also the Seeker and Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, bringing Gryffindor to the house cup 3 years in a row and everyone knew that it was just a matter of time before he went professional.
“I didn’t mean to. We’re—we’ve always talked like that to each other, haven’t we? Mutual destruction and all that?” said Malfoy.
Harry straightened up, trying to smooth out his hair. “I told my parents the truth about—about my hand,” he explained. “I’ve been seeing a Mindhealer about it and it’s really helped me with those panic attacks you told me about.”
“You’re not listening to me at all, are you?”
Malfoy’s sneer only grew, his eyes flashing dangerously. He opened his mouth, no doubt to throw back some other cutting jab, but was unceremoniously interrupted by the appearance of their Potions teacher, Professor Blair.
“Yeah. Dunno how it happened, but when I, er, went to catch myself, my hand just hit the floor…”
When they entered, Madam Pomfrey was having a low conversation with Professor Lupin while she idly checked on a sleeping third year Slytherin. They both looked up at the two boys entering the room. Professor Lupin paled at the sight of Harry’s bloody hand, eyes narrowing on Malfoy while Madam Pomfrey crossed over to them in a few quick strides. Malfoy stood back as Madam Pomfrey began the process of healing Harry’s cuts and bruises, Professor Lupin eyeing them both with suspicion.
Harry rolled his eyes, biting his bottom lip. “What about them?”
“Better?” asked Malfoy once Harry was no longer hyperventilating.
“What do you mean you can’t play the next match? But the manager from Puddlemere United is supposed to watch you!” exclaimed Ron the following morning when Harry explained his situation to his friends over breakfast.
For the majority of that day, Harry kept mostly to himself as much as he could. He kept his head down in class instead of making jokes under his breath or trying to get into debates with his professors, writing notes and practicing spellwork in relative silence. He could sense the concerned looks from his friends and even a few professors, but he couldn’t bring himself to bring any extra attention to himself.
“Ah, Mr. Potter,” he said by way of greeting. He held out a hand for Harry to shake and Harry took it. “Charles Burness, manager of Puddlemere United. That was a remarkable performance, I must say. Especially that feint near the end!”
Harry scoffed, hands on his hips. He had a vivid image of his mother doing the very same thing whenever he misbehaved and he promptly dropped his arms to his side, uncomfortable at the image of his mum’s disappointment. “I can’t, Malfoy. Nobody can know the truth,” he snapped, raising his chin in the air in defiance. “The fact that you know the truth is embarrassing enough, thanks.”
“Come on, Potter, let’s just breathe, alright?” said Malfoy soothingly. He shifted until Harry was no longer almost in his lap. Instead, he rubbed a cool hand up and down Harry’s back and began doing breathing exercises with Harry, breathing deep and slow until Harry could finally breathe properly again.
“Couldn’t put that in a letter? You were gonna find out when you came to the match, anyway,” Harry replied, barely hiding the bitterness in his tone.
As he did so, Harry felt another rush through his head and he stumbled sideways, catching himself on the sink. He swore violently, having grabbed onto the sink with his bad hand, tears pricking his eyes again.
Harry jumped half a foot in the air as someone banged on the door to his stall. “Harry? You alright in there, mate? The game’s starting soon?” said Ron on the other side of the door.
McGonagall sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Be that as it may, Professor Lupin and Madam Pomfrey backed up this claim themselves. You don’t believe they had any ill will, do you?”
“Of course not,” Harry blurted. He coughed. “Er, I… fell on the stairs,”
Harry opened and closed his mouth several times, struggling for any further argument. But he could find none. He didn’t even want to play anyway…
“Oh. Well, I’m glad you’ve got help,” said Draco earnestly. “I won’t apologise for telling McGonagall the truth, but… I am sorry about how it turned out. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I just wanted to help and I thought it was the right thing to do.” His pale cheeks flushed a pale pink and he ducked his head bashfully, looking at Harry through his lashes
Harry rolled his eyes. “Oh, wow, how long did it take you to come up with that, Malfoy? Been practicing all summer for that one?” Harry retorted, earning snickers from their other classmates listening into the conversation.
Harry hummed, nodding. “Yup. Fine. Just a second.”
Harry turned, just in time to see the manager of Puddlemere United walking over to him. He was a tall white man with grey hair and a jovial smile, wearing a formal robe in the PU colours with the team’s logo on one side. Harry’s heart skipped a beat and he forced a polite smile as the man approached.
To Harry’s complete and utter horror, Draco sodding Malfoy stood before him, eyes wide as they made eye contact in the cracked mirror.
He was careful not to mention Malfoy or anything that went on in the toilet, instead giving a similar explanation which he gave to Madam Pomfrey the night before. He even woke up early to go down to the toilets to repair the damage he’d done so that no one would be any the wiser. He could sense his friends’ skepticism, Hermione and Ron sharing looks with each other, but he pretended not to notice. Remus was also giving him long, frowning looks from across the hall and it took everything in Harry’s power not to look in the direction of the Slytherin table, for fear he might catch a certain blond’s eye…
“Oh, nothing! I was just coming to visit your uncles Remus and Sirius for a cuppa and I thought I’d swing by to watch the last of your Quidditch practice!” James exclaimed, grinning. Harry gave him a disbelieving look and James feigned offence, slapping a dramatic hand to his chest and gasping. “I do not like that face, young man! Can’t a dad come and say hi to his son when he’s visiting his genius best friends at work?”
Harry shook his head. He used the wall to get to his feet, peering down at Malfoy. “Well, it was all your fault it happened. If you hadn’t betrayed me, this wouldn’t have happened.”
And then, without even registering the decision in his mind, Harry punched the mirror as hard as he could.
That year, in his final year of Hogwarts, was no different. By his second class of the day, he had already been stopped three times by curious first years and he was uncomfortably aware of the tingling sensation of being watched by countless eyes.
“It was,” said Harry, grabbing one of Draco’s hands. “I don’t know if I ever would have gotten help if you hadn’t forced me to. So, thank you for that. It was the kick I needed.”
Harry sighed heavily, frowning. It was true that Harry was already getting letters from various Quidditch teams that summer, asking to come see him in his Quidditch games to scout him for their teams. His dad made him practice drills in their makeshift Quidditch pitch in their back garden almost every day that year, trying to get him up to standards in time for scouting during that school year. Godric forbid Harry ever had a break.
“Yeah, maybe. But you don’t have the entire school and your world-renowned Quidditch legend dad putting even more pressure on you to do well, do you?”
“Get off—me,” Harry gritted, yanking his arm out of the other boy’s grasp. He spun around, glaring at Malfoy with all the venom he could muster. “What do you
“It’s a physical response to having intense anxiety or panic,” Malfoy explained slowly. “You can get hyperventilating and shaking and rapid heartbeat and even more stuff. I get them all the time.”
It was one of those brief reprieves from his usual extracurriculars or coursework one evening when Harry found himself in the library alongside Hermione, Ron, Neville, Hannah Abbott and Ernie Macmillan. Ron and Ernie were in an intense chess match, Hermione and Hannah were going over details from their latest Transfiguration essay and Harry was half-heartedly listening to Neville’s rant about some venomous plant he read about recently.
Draco Malfoy was the Seeker for the Slytherin team, making them both instant rivals when they got to school when they were eleven. He had pale white-blond hair, daring silver eyes and aristocratic high cheekbones and a sharp chin, further accented by his near constant sneer he sent Harry’s way.
“Ugh, not again. Was last year not enough?” grumbled Ron, going pale. In their previous school year, Romilda Vane repeatedly tried spiking Harry with love potion and Ron managed to get himself spiked when he stole one of Harry’s chocolates one time. The embarrassment of having to get dragged to an irate Professor Blair after a very public proposal to Romilda and getting dumped by his girlfriend Lavender Brown as a result left Ron wary of any food offered to him for weeks.
“And that explains why you’ve also got deep cuts that look more like you cut yourself on glass than on stone?”
“Yeah. If Quidditch isn’t what makes you happy, I don’t want you to keep forcing yourself to do it,” added James, looking at his wife over Harry’s shoulder before returning to Harry. “Sure, I loved getting to share that with you, but only if it’s what truly makes you happy.”
“Oh, Harry!” Lily cried, covering her mouth. “Why? Why did you hurt yourself, sweetheart?”
With surprising care, Malfoy lowered Harry to the floor, still gripping him from behind until they both sat awkwardly on the floor together. Harry distantly recognised the position as odd, tucked up in Draco Malfoy’s arms as he crumbled to pieces, staining his shirt with his own blood as he struggled to take in any breaths.
Without waiting for a reply, he took the stairs two at a time and strided all the way back to Gryffindor tower, going to bed without another word.
“Right, okay, everyone. That’s enough for one night,” Harry said, blowing the whistle hanging around his neck. “Ginny, that was a great last shot there, keep it up. And Holly, much better than last week. You’re really improving.”
After the match, which Gryffindor just managed to win by a sliver due to the many goals scored by his wonderful Chasers and every goal saved by Ron, there was a party going on in the Gryffindor tower. Instead of attending and hearing about how brilliant his friends were and asking why he wasn’t playing and being constantly reminded by his complete failure, Harry hid away in the Room of Requirement until he was sure everyone had gone to bed. The next morning, he woke up only hours later, heading straight to the library to take out a selection of books for class before hiding away in the Room of Requirement once again. He couldn’t get Malfoy out of his head. His memories kept flashing with Malfoy’s hurt expression in the corridor and he noticed the Slytherin watching him in classes much more frequently, leaving him blushing and confused at all times.
“Anyway!” interrupted James. “Two scouts is still great! I mean, the Cannons aren’t exactly the best team, but the Magpies are really moving up the league this season. That would be great if you played for them! You’d be able to prove yourself and get transferred to better teams!”
“Malfoy! Draco! Draco!” Harry called out, sprinting up the field, jostled through the crowd of people heading up to the castle. They called out more congratulations, but Harry ignored them, tearing his way over to where Draco Malfoy was walking up to the school by himself.
