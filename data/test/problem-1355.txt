; Harry thought.
After a couple minutes of both the boys smiling and joking around each other, a peaceful slow song came on, and Draco blushed heavily,
"BLAISE ZABINI. I'M NOT A SOFTIE HOW DARE YOU-"
"Potter. We need to talk." She said bitterly.
"That's not a reason to hate someone!" Pansy shouted. "Blaise is an annoying git, yet you don't see me hating him and using sectumsempra on him now do you Potter? And plus, Draco has changed! Trust me he has! Why can't you just give him a chance?"
Maybe if he just said to Hedwig, "Send this to my secret admirer" it would work. But if it did work, then that would make no sense.
Ron looked up at Harry's confused and curious face, and looked at Hermione. "Bloody hell.. He has no idea, does he?"
"Wake! Up!" Draco groaned frustratedly, hitting Blaise with the pillow after each word.
"Tell me what?" Harry angrily replied.
Harry turned around and looked at her, examining her. Luna's blonde hair was slightly more curled at the ends than it usually was, she had some of the several odd strands out of place, but that didn't make a difference - her hair style was still unique and there was a zero percent chance that anyone could describe it as messy. Her dress wasn't necessarily short but it wasn't long either, it was ivory and long sleeved with a tie up around the waist, and some small sky blue flower designs scattered across it.
hello!! i realised that in one of my chapters, i referred to draco as "blonde" and not "blond" and apparently "blonde" is the female term while "blond" is male. i had no fucking clue haha i literally just found out O_O
Ron blinked at him. "Have they given you any hints?"
Harry didn't know why Malfoy emphasized on the "you" in that statement, but he decided to just ignore it.
Harry went to sleep that night thinking about Malfoy. And only Malfoy.
"You okay Harry?" Hermione questioned.
Thought Harry.
Harry sighed. "No. I actually have no clue, i'm not even kidding."

"What the fuck is wrong with you Potter?" Pansy asked while gritting her teeth.

Harry stayed up all night waiting for a letter back, but it never came.
Everyone turned around to look at him when he entered the classroom. But it wasn't like he cared that he was late, it was only by a couple minutes. But then again, he did have Snape.
i'm so bored
Harry gave her an annoyed look. "This isn't funny Hermione! Ron do you know who it might be?"
"Potter likes me back!! Look! Read this!"
His boyfriend smiled. "I'm glad too, Harry."
"This person is definitely a Hufflepuff, I mean did you guys hear how lovey dovey that letter was?"

Because Draco was a bad person; a horrible person; as so he thought himself. He had a low self esteem, and hardly any confidence whatsoever. He would always look in his bathroom mirror and sigh as the negative thoughts would fill his mind; Why am I so unattractive? Why would anyone ever look at me and think that I'm good looking? Exactly, they wouldn't.
He began to read the letter, trying not to smile. He nearly did smile, but then he remembered that Draco thought it was okay to wake him up early, only because the Potter boy returned his feelings. Blaise looked at Draco again.
She looked down at the floor before bursting into tears.
"Potter." Snape said sternly. "You're late."
"Right. Yeah. Gross. I'm going to class now, i'm already at least five minutes late. Bye Potter." He said quickly as he quickly ran away.
He was determined to write his secret admirer a letter back. Part of him needed to make sure that this wasn't some sort of joke; which it most likely was.
Walking into the great hall, Harry joined his friends for breakfast.
"You and your secret admirer definitely don't get along, you can just tell." Ron said blankly.
"Fuck yeah I do." Malfoy said while looking him up and down.
"Guys... I need some help." He said desperately.

"It took you both some time. I'm happy for you both, Harry." She congratulated him, and then muttered something on the lines of, 'I have to go to Ginny', before kissing him on the cheek goodbye.
Luckily, Harry ducked fast; and quickly aimed a hex at Malfoy.
"Pansy-" Harry almost whispered while putting his hand on her arm; trying his best to comfort her.
"Hi." Draco's shy voice from behind him said embarrassedly. Harry smiled lovingly at him and then took a moment to appreciate how pretty the blonde looked. The outfit that Draco was wearing was quite different to his, considering Harry was wearing his green dress robes. Because Draco was, well, Draco, he was obviously going to wear black. But Harry still thought he was beautiful, he always did, no matter what Draco wore.
Harry nodded his head quickly before running to his potions lesson.
People had been bombarding him with questions all day.
Harry gasped sharply, terrified of what he had just done.
"Why do you care?"
Harry blinked. "That would be disgusting."
"Someone like me?"
"Harry, sit down will you? This might be a lot to take in." Hermione giggled.
"You look great, by the way." Harry said after a while.
"Yes!" Ron said, snatching the letter from Hermione's hands and handing it to Harry, "See. Read it."
Draco smirked as he sat down next to Pansy at the Slytherin table. She looked at him and gave him the same odd look that she had been giving him for the past couple days or so. But Draco simply ignored her, and carried on smirking, not being able to help it.
Harry was more than sad for his secret admirer once he read that letter. Why did they think so badly of themselves? Harry was going to do whatever it took to find out who his secret admirer is, and he's going to make sure they no longer doubted themselves.

"Well that sure is helpful." Ron remarked sarcastically.
"I'm glad I finally have you, fuck." Harry whispered.
"Fuck off, you." Harry grinned back, and pulled him into a kiss which caught Draco off guard. He tightened his grip on Draco's waist and drew him closer, accidently letting out a slight moan when Draco purposely bit on his bottom lip and dragged it backwards a little. "Draco." He groaned as he struggled to keep his hands on Draco's hips.
______
"Well?! Any ideas on who it might be?!" Harry asked with anger.
He knew his idea wouldn't work. It made no sense anyway.
"Shut up Potter. Have you found out who your secret admirer is yet?" Malfoy asked, desperately trying to change the subject.
As soon as classes finished for the day, Harry sped up to his room as fast as he could.
"Watch where you're going Potter." Malfoy spat.
"Stop asking me questions!" Harry shouted, "I don't know who they are! I don't know if they're actually serious! They are probably joking! I don't know! Okay? Just stop asking me questions, please!"
He complimented her by saying she looked nice, and then told her about what happened last night with Draco.

The next day, Harry was still thinking about yesterday as everyone else in the great hall were peacefully eating their dinner.
denmark: +4570201201
There's something different about Malfoy. He's been acting weird and strange lately. And Harry was determined that he would figure out why.
Hermione seemed to go extremely quiet everytime Harry started a conversation about his secret admirer. It was like she knew something about them, or more like she knew who they were. But that can't be true, because Hermione would tell Harry if she figured out, right?
"That's not what I meant-"
"Send this to my secret admirer, please." Harry said softly.
"No. I would like to ask
Draco was this close >< to giving up. He didn't even know why he bothered sending Harry the letter in the first place. Harry didn't know his secret admirer was a boy, and from as far as Draco knew, Harry is straight. And it's not like Harry would ever reciprocate his feelings anyway.
Harry sighed.
"Well...." Harry paused; he couldn't think of a valid yet sensible answer.
"Yes. We know each other, but i'm not sure if we get along or not." He replied.
The past week had been extremely weird for Harry. It's been way more different than usual. It was strange.
"Malfoy- I- I swear- I didn't mean to-"
Talking about his secret admirer, he hasn't received a letter from them in ages, ever since he sent that letter complaining about Malfoy. This worried Harry, he couldn't help but think that he did something wrong. He hoped his secret admirer would write to him soon; Harry missed them.
He had to find out what Malfoy was up to. Malfoy doesn't just act weird for no reason.
Hermione elbowed him. "Ron! At least it's a start! Just let him continue!"
am i uneducated because of this? asking for a friend.
He hoped that the idea would work.
Thought Draco.
Well, except Harry of course. He was too busy staring at Malfoy; his heart aching second by second.

Harry's face went a shade of dark red, he wasn't really sure why. "T- Thanks, I guess."
"What?"
Harry looked at her; confused. "What?"
"No- No I didn't- I couldn't have-" He said, shocked.
"THAT'S SO CUTE! OMG I HOPE THEY GET TOGETHER!"
Malfoy raised his shaking hand and threw a hex at Harry, but it missed him by inches.
Harry looked at them both. "Are you guys actually being serious?"
Harry decided that due to the fact that he couldn't get back to sleep, it would be a perfect opportunity to write to his secret admirer again. Who, still to Harry's surprise, happened to be Draco Malfoy.
Finally, the now grinning and blushing boy spoke up. "Guess who's now Harry Potter's boyfriend?"
He looked at Malfoy curiously; why was he showing an interest in this of all things?
Harry took the letter from Ron and started to read it.

"No! Please stop!" Screamed Moaning Myrtle's panicked voice that echoed through the whole room. "STOP!"
; Thought Draco.
"You can't hate someone who you barely know! He's gone through so much shit you know. Don't you think it hurts, Potter?" She cries, "Seeing someone you love, come into your common room and cry everyday? Hearing them cry themselves to sleep every night? Knowing that they are feeling lonely and feeling as if they have no one that cares about them? He's my best friend! He deserves better than this bullshit."
"No you're not." Pansy huffed. "Why do you hate him so much?"
All he could think about was Draco, as always.
The sight shocked him. It truly did shock him. The voice was Malfoy's. Malfoy was the boy that had been constantly crying in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
; Thought Harry.
Ron and Hermione both look up at him with concerned eyes.
Moaning Myrtle let out a horrified scream, "MURDER! HELP! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM!"
hiiii guyss
Malfoy scoffed, "I don't."
"I don't know either. Sorry." She lied.
Harry sat down on his seat next to Malfoy.

"You used fucking sectumsempra on him! SECTUMSEMPRA!" She raged.
Could it be- No. Surely not.
Harry sighed. "I'm sorry."
"You listen carefully Potter! I don't want you causing him anymore pain or stress! Please be nice to him." Pansy sighed.
Without a second thought, Harry ran out of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom immediately.

"Who's going to tell him?" Asked Ginny.

Malfoy collapsed on the bathroom floor instantly, blood pouring from his chest.
Malfoy looked up at him, surprised and shocked. "Don't bullshit with me Potter."
"Why does everybody hate me so much?" The boy cried. "I've changed I swear Myrtle! Well- I- I mean- I'm trying to-"

The gryffindor table couldn't stop laughing. He could only just make out some sentences that were being shouted at him.
here's the chapter y'all been waiting for :p
He was sobbing; full on sobbing.
Hermione stopped eating; her mouth wide open in shock. As if no one saw, which they didn't, she turned around slightly to face the Slytherin table and smirked knowingly.

As Malfoy threw another hex at him; Harry threw himself sideways and was just about to jinx Malfoy with Levicorpus until-
"You know I hate you, I do." Harry told him. "You're always fucking up to something."
Harry clenched his jaw. "Get out of my way Malfoy."
He turned to look at Malfoy and studied him for a moment. Malfoy still had his tired eyes, and he still had his look of sadness in his eyes. His eyes were silver grey; shining vividly like some beautiful charm you find in muggle shops. His hair was still messy like it had been for the past few weeks. Not that it bothered Harry; he always thought that Malfoy's hair looked better when it was messy. His skin was obviously still pale as fuck. His nose was a cute nose. The type of nose that you just want to 'boop' with your finger. His lips were a dark pink but yet creamy colour. They were smooth and soft. Malfoy had the type of lips that you had to hold back from kissing them.
"Oh I just remembered that I didn't get to tell you what happened yesterday because I couldn't wake you up! Harry kissed me, Blaise. How awesome is that? Wait, I think Pansy probably told you actually-"

But the thing Harry found the most strangest is when he walked past or was near Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Whenever he did this, he would swear that he could hear crying. A boy crying. The same boy each night. He knew deep down that he knew the voice from somewhere; but he just couldn't figure out who it could be.
"It's not a big deal."
Malfoy gulped nervously. "What would you do if it was someone unexpected?"
Harry blinked. "You- You think i'm hot?"
_____
"Amazing right?!" Draco grinned.
Harry watched her shout at him as a tear streamed down her face.
Draco looked away.
“Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice low. "I'm trying to help you! You obviously don't have a plan and I-"
The group of girls standing near them broke into gasps and whispers.
"Mhm. And how many of them are staying here for Christmas?"
"Hey, you got Outstanding in DADA?"
Harry looked him in the eye, furiously.
Draco didn't look at him and got off his chest to lay properly on the bed.
"Oh, you're here,
"THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS CARRIAGE." he said and stormed out.
"Harry.. You were in detention for.. 9 hours?"
Harry smiled.
Harry smiled.
"Oh.. What do I do, now?"
Harry slammed their lips together. He was furiously kissing Draco. Draco was being stubborn but when Harry bit his lip, he gasped and Harry took the opportunity to slide his tongue into his mouth. He started kissing back after that. They made out for what felt like a lifetime. Neither of them knew when they fell asleep in each others arms.
"Really?"
"We could go to my dormitory instead of the Room of Requirement, tonight?"
"Call me a git again and you will be severely punished." he said and Ron snorted.
"I already have detention till Fridat."
Draco shuddered.
"H-hi, you look.." Harry said, breathlessly.
"Well. Then, clearly you don't need me here. I'll just head to my dormitory if I could have my arm back, Potter."
Harry frowned.
(Next night.)
Harry didn't have a date, either. He wanted to ask Malfoy but didn't have the courage to. And he didn't even know if Malfoy would say yes. Yes, he hadn't teased him ever since the.. incident. But, that didn't mean he reciprocated his feelings. Yes, he had finally admitted he had feelings for Malfoy. Anyway, the point was that he was too scared to ask Malfoy to be his date and he desperately needed a date as he was a Champion.
"She did?" said Hermione, looking surprised.
"Exactly! Three days! We used to hang out and play games in the common room, everyday after homework! You don't even do homework with us, anymore. Blaise is very suspicious and completely convinced you're shagging a girl and at this point, I've stopped denying him. Crabbe and Goyle were already idiotic buffoons but now they're just miserable. Even, Theo was asking about you.. What am I supposed to tell them?!"
"Shut it, Blaise."
Draco frowned.
"Malfoy and I fought and so what? It's not the first time." He lies without batting an eye.
Harry looked at him. He looked unsure as if he wasn't sure how Harry would react. Harry thought he looked absolutely adorable but he didn't want to die yet so he wasn't going to tell him that.
"Have you completely lost the ability to communicate in the English language, Potter?"
"Okay.." said Draco, confused.
"Ron.. Where's Harry?"
"How do you avoid someone in your own dorm?"
"Oh er.. Yes, sure, if she wants to leave.." she replied, half-heartedly.
"I brought you a pygmy puff!"
"Er.. I wanted to show you something.." Draco said, fidgeting with his hands.
"Do you know what giving a ring means?" Draco asked after their make-out session, staring at the ring on his finger.
"I won't. I'm sorry, okay? I- I didn't realise it would get that far.. I was just.. I.. I don't know! I was just trying to tease you and win the match for once but I.. I'm sorry."
"Maybe, you should drink that." Harry said to Draco.
“It’s all right, Ms. Parkinson,” said Snape, lowering his wand. “Potter is here for a little Remedial Potions.”
Harry nodded.
"Really?" he whispered, grabbing his hands.
(Next day at night.)
"Harry, my hand."
He had been waiting in the shadows the whole night. Waiting for everyone to leave the Hospital Wing so he could go see Harry.
"Don't worry, Harry, I already knew you were together." she said, dreamily. "I'll go change into my robes." she said and left.
"So, wait.. You're going to be doing this detention the entire week for like 9 hours?"
"No one gets it on their first try. What memory did you think of?"
"Seriously? Let me see it!"
"I'll lead, come on.." Draco said, dragging Harry to the dance floor.
"That I'm gay, Potter." he snapped.
"Hey, Draco, baby.. Let's go to sleep, okay? Worrying about it won't do anything."
"What are you so angry for? You should be happy Potter got caught." Blaise said.
The party seemed to turn normal after a few minutes. He'd had a few unpleasant conversations with his teachers then he'd sat down at a table with Draco and had dinner.
He could feel Harry's breath on his neck as he leaned down as if to kiss him but pulled back as soon as Draco closed his eyes.
"Draco?"
"Both of us, actually." Hermione added.
Draco was frowning.
"Well, are you just going to stand there or are you going to come along?" said Draco.
"HARRY! OH MERLIN! GET.. OFF.. ME.. YOU.. GIT.."
"I have my ways."
"I suppose I'll just have to kiss it better." Draco whispered.
“What?”
"Er.. I suppose.. But still, his father's a death eater!" countered Ron.
"But you didn't know that, did you? And you tried it on your best friend! Harry, please. Using a book for Potions help is different but don't bloody recite spells you've got no idea about! How would you know it's not the Dark Arts?!"
"Oh? I don't understand.. He wanted to poison Dumbledore?"
"Potter. I forced a seventh year Slytherin to transfigure my face because I wanted to prank you. I'm sure doing that again would be a ridiculously suspicious thing to ask for." he replied.
"I'm hungry." said Draco, settling in the armchair in front of the fireplace. Harry summoned his blanket and threw it over Draco.
"I'm sorry but- You can't just.. tell me.. Oh Merlin! I can't even.. What was Weasel..? Marching up to the girls' dorm-"
"Stupefy!" he yelled and threw Harry's friends wands to them.
"What will you do if I don't?" he asked and smirked.
Draco took a deep breath.
"Clearly."
Once he'd retold the story to Draco, Draco was frowning.
"No."
They laid in silence for a while before drifting off to sleep.
Draco blushed.
"Off to the owlery for your food!" he said and the owl flew away.
"No one knows." he finally muttered.
"Harry."
"What could happen?" Harry asked and started to open it.
After a few seconds of silence, Ron mumbled, "You sound like Dumbledore when talks about Snape."
It was 11:55 AM when he'd sent Arcturus. And it was 2:31 PM, now. Surely, Draco would've gotten his letter by now?
"I know, Harry! I know I need to choose!"
Harry really wanted to kiss him but he didn't. It would hurt even more.
"Is that.. It can't be.." mumbled Harry when he saw a large eagle owl perched outside his window.
"Well, I.. I want to.. I just need them."
"What is it?" Harry asked.
"Yes."
"Wha- Draco, you're tired!"
"Go on, I'll send lunch." said Molly, ushering them up the stairs.
"What?"
"Where were you?! I was so scared!" he said, his voice shaking.
"Happy Christmas, Draco."
"Come on."
Then Ron and Hermione started bickering about how insensitive Ron is and something about a teaspoon, Harry had zoned out.
"You're so mean, Draco." Harry said, smiling.
"Make something up, Potter."
"Gladly. You know what?" Draco took out some parchment and a quill from his bag.
"She should know you're taken." Draco said, pulling back from Harry and admiring the mark he'd left on his neck.
Harry chuckled again.
Draco's eyes widened upon hearing Snape's voice. No, Severus couldn't know of this.. He would tell his mother.. He can't let them know! But, what would he say? What is he doing with his supposed enemy in a transfigured bed, clutching his hand, at midnight? He was doomed.
"Um.. Yeah.."
When he came out of the lavatory wearing his newest Weasley sweater, he saw Draco was wearing the one he'd received last Christmas and the blue scarf he'd given Harry.
"Y-yes."
"Draco."
"Oh." replied Draco, also reddening.
Draco smirked.
"Oh Merlin, you're blushing!"
"Okay." Harry replied, not wanting to overwhelm Draco by continuing the conversation.
Harry blushed.
Harry caressed his cheek.
“Hello, Harry, Hello Draco..” said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.
"No! No, I.. No!" Hermione replied, flustered.
"You won't" he whispered to the boy who had already fallen asleep.
"I'll er.. go to the Prefect's carriage." Draco said and hurriedly left.
"But why Severus? Couldn't Dumbledore teach you? Severus despises you!"
"Oh. That was you."
Draco walked over and caressed his hair.
Draco snorted.
"Where have you been?"
"Yes, he needs help!" Harry shouted.
Damn it, Draco couldn't form a single coherent sentence.
The hurt in Draco's eyes made him feel guilty.
"That actually hurt, you git." said Harry rubbing his lip and pulling away but Draco's hold on him was tight.
"I.. If you could help me in Defense against the Dark Arts." he said in small voice.
"Draco.. Stop looking at me like that. I won't be able to restrain myself."
"By the way.. how was your meeting with your Godfather?"
Draco raised an eyebrow.
Harry rubbed his forehead.
Draco glared at him.
"Yes, Draco. Relax."
"Oh? Oh- OH!" said Harry and grinned.
"Are you blushing?" Harry asked.
"Oh.. Aren't you lonely, though?"
Harry turned back. He looked miserable.
He was still asleep. He looked so peaceful and calm while sleeping. Harry had never seen him look so carefree, before. He wished he could be like this, all the time. But, he knew it was stupid to wish for something like that.
“Luna, hi, how are you?”
"Of course, Harry.. I just meant.. Nevermind. I suppose you're making it public, now. Come on, stop hogging the entrance."
Just as he was about to interrupt Harry's pointless pacing again, something incredibly strange happened and a door appeared on the wall Draco had just been staring at.
"But.. Malfoy! Hermione, Malfoy! How could Harry-"
Harry rolled his eyes. He didn't want to bother with the Prophet but Draco looked upset. It was filled with strange - some somewhat right and some absolutely bogus - theories. Rita Skeeter reckoned it was all a plan to get Harry to Voldemort and Draco had given him a love potion.. Of course,
“I know it must be horrible for you,” she said, mopping her eyes on her sleeve again. “Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die. . . .  I suppose you just want to forget about it. . . .”
"Harry?" Draco's voice snapped him to reality.
"Pleeeeaaassse." Harry whined.
"See you at midnight." said Harry just as Draco was about to exit the compartment and Draco grinned at the door.
"Don't be so stubborn, Dray. You're cold." he said and forcibly took Draco into the Gryffindor common room.
Draco's face softened.
"Hey, you didn't open my present!" Harry exclaimed attempting to lift the mood.
"You didn't have to." Draco mumbled, looking at the floor.
Malfoy was alone! For once in his life, Malfoy's goons were not lurking nearby.. This was Harry's chance!
Harry guffawed.
Harry sat alone in the compartment while Ron and Hermione were off doing prefect duties. He was happy for Ron but also angry at Dumbledore. He was contemplating the reasons Dumbledore suddenly hates him when the compartment's door opened.
"I'm afraid." he whispered.
He closed his eyes and drifted to sleep. He knew Draco would run away, again, when he woke up and he wasn't ready for that, yet. So, he decided to enjoy this for a little longer.
"Are you and Scarhead having a threesome with the Weasel?" Pansy asked, realising Draco wasn't listening to her rants about Blaise and Theo.
Harry frowned.
"Yeah.."
They all went towards Ron. He held a small orb with the following words written on it:
"I have his owl upstairs.. I need to send a reply."
"I have my suspicions."
"Well, I wanted to apologise.. For storming out of the Hospital wing like that. I was just scared.", he gave a small hysterical laugh.
"Don't take Snape too seriously, you know how he is."
He leaned closer to Pansy so Blaise wouldn't hear.
"He meant it." he whispered.
"R-really?" asked Harry.
"Don't you have a detention to go to?"
"Now, what's the matter? Did you have a nightmare or..?"
Draco nodded and put the ring on his finger.
"So, it's true, then. The rumours, I mean. What did you bribe Vincent and Gregory with to make them lie about Potter kissing you?" she said in an amused tone.
"It's a fake Galleon with a Protean charm like the ones for DA.. I told you about them. I got Hermione to charm them for us in case we need to see each other.." Harry explained.
"Harry! You didn't tell me you'd be bringing him!" Hermione whispered.
Harry stood there with an open mouth, staring at Draco like an idiot.
“Why not?” he said. “It’s something to do with me, isn’t it?”
Later, when he told Ron and Hermione he'd scored an A, Hermione demanded to see his essay. The look she gave him after reading it made him squirm. He looked towards Ron who looked startled.
"At Hogwarts, Harry. Hogsmeade is outside. I'm not ready to go outside." he replied, fidgeting with his hands.
Draco ran before Blaise could say anything.
She hiccuped again. Her eyes were red and puffy. Harry felt thoroughly miserable. He really didn't want to be here.
Draco stared at it.
Neville waved his hand at Harry and Harry nodded.
"I wanted to ask if you would like to go to the Yule ball. With me. As my date."
"Why shouldn't they?" Harry asked.
"It's not that bad, we've played Quidditch in worse conditions.. And you love snow, anyway!"
He pulled his hand away, got up and left, leaving Harry frowning.
"It's from mother.. She sent money.." he replied, clutching a letter, probably from his mother.
Harry had not come in the room last night and Draco thought maybe he was mad at him but he wasn't at breakfast or lunch either. Nor was Ronald Weasley. A few hours of stalking later, Draco found out none of the Weasleys were at Hogwarts. Surprisingly, Hermione Granger was still here. Draco knew he shouldn't but he couldn't stop worrying about Harry so he went up to Granger in the library and asked her.
"I'll help you. Even though, I don't think you'll need my help."
Ron's eyes widened.
"By the way, Harry.. We were wondering what you've been upto with Dumbledore?"
"Where were you?!" Draco asked, rushing towards Harry.
Harry licked his lips and felt Draco shiver.
"You didn't deny it, either."
"Seriously, Draco?" asked Harry, angrily.
"Draco, you'll never lose me.. But you know who my family supports and.. Unlike you, I don't have a choice."
"Harry, I.." Draco started but didn't finish.
"Don't joke about dying, again" he muttered, climbing into bed.
, he thought.
"This is really not how I'd imagined I'd be spending my Saturday morning." Harry grumbled, scrubbing a Quidditch trophy, violently.
"I can't believe it! I thought you'd just get nasty looks and words but this?! People go this far for thinking you're a liar?! Who did it, Harry?"
Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. She was even nearer him now. He was backing away.
The look on Snape's face was priceless as he handed Harry's moonstone essay with an A on it. Harry thought he'd deserved at least an E for that one but nevertheless, even an A was enough in Potions after all his suffering.. Then, Snape started lecturing the class about how cheating off their friends won't get them a good grade in their OWLS. Harry just rolled his eyes and glanced at Draco who was already looking at him, glaring in case anyone saw him staring at Harry. Harry gave a small smile and Draco winked while scowling at Harry.
Draco grabbed his arm and flinched.
"Wait, I thought it was recent, how long has this been going on?" Ron asked, frowning.
"Well then, we need a plan."
Molly nodded.
"Fuck you, Potter. Go sleep in Weasley's bed." he said and turned around to dramatically exit the room when Harry grabbed his hand and pulled him onto the desk-bed.
"Right."
"So.. Where's my present?"
"Do you have a cold, Draco?" he said, putting his hand on Draco's forehead.
“I want to know where Sirius is!” mimicked the woman to his left.
"Fine, then. I'll send word to the Weasel and the.. Granger to come pick you up, then."
"Well, you better make up your mind and choose one side, Draco. Being caught between two stools will only make life more difficult."
"What?"
Harry looked at him.
"No, I didn't even notice I hadn't had dinner.. I'm used to the starving bit, you know?" he said and gave a hysterical laugh.
"I don't know what you're talking about, everyone loves my sass." Harry said, copying Draco's haughty expression.
"And why would he do that?" came Ron's voice from her other side.
"I was only rude to the Weasel because I was jealous. How could it be that a Weasley had befriended Harry Potter and a Malfoy couldn't?"
Draco still look unconvinced but Harry let it go and went to get the peppermint.
"Ron? I'd reckoned you'd have been more excited to see your best friend after the Holidays." he said and raised his eyebrows. He really wished he could raise one eyebrow like Draco.
"And.. would you support me no matter what I choose?"
"Wait!"
"Well no, she figured it out, herself. And she's the one who told be to write to you but that's besides the point. Where have you been?!"
"Are you alright?"
“Go on, then,” said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height.
Draco frowned. He knew Harry was right. And it reminded him of the choice he was procrastinating on making..
Draco nodded.
"Well.. I wouldn't say that. You're just following different instructions.. I'm sure Granger is just jealous you made a potion she failed to make." Draco said and smirked.
"Ah, there you are." said Dumbledore and gestured for Harry to take his arm. Draco looked uncomfortable at the thought of going with Molly but Molly would be nice to him, Harry thought. That's why he'd insisted she comes with them.
"I.. Sorry.." Harry uttered.
"We'll come with-"
“Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,” said Harry angrily.
"Draco, you don't seriously believe that woman? Did your friends not say crap to her about Hagrid? She twisted it into a horrible story as if Hagrid is some monster! It's the same with Mione, Draco.. That woman's just.. terrible."
Draco smiled.
Lucius Malfoy.
"Harry.. I know I said using that book for making potions isn't a bad thing but.. Granger is right."
Harry sighed.
Draco looked at him, eyes filled with hope.
"All gone." Draco replied, smiling.
"Is Harry Potter sir alright?"
"Happy Christmas, Draco." he said, putting his hands around Draco's neck to properly snog him.
"No, er.. They're dark magic. Forbidden magic. No one even talks about them, anymore. I doubt you'd even find anything related to them in ths Restricted Section. Though, there was a book in the Manor library.. I tried to read it once but mother saw it and took it away.. Never found it, again." Draco said, looking sad. He was probably thinking of his mother.
Draco was pouting, now.
"Serves you right for being a reckless Gryffindor." he said before vanishing the maggots.
Harry stormed out the portrait hole and slammed into a body, making both of them fall down.
"See what?"
"Well, you could ask him to send his reply by your owl? Owls are smart, Draco. If you tell him not to give the letter to anyone else, he won't. And you know that.. So, why are you making excuses?"
"Do you remember all the spells we practiced?"
He shook his head to clear his thoughts and resumed search of the snitch.
"No."
"T'was fine. Got Exceeds Expectations in History of Magic, Care of Magical Creatures and Ancient Runes. Outstanding in the rest."
"I suppose not.. At any rate, I reckon Hermione doesn't trust any Slytherins to keep quiet about the group. Of course, you're not all evil but.. most of your families are or are associated with Death eaters and those whose aren't are friends with y'all so.. I get her decision to not involve Slytherins, even if it is a little biased and unfair.."
For a moment, the two of them stare wide-eyed at each other, both of them furiously blushing.
"I didn't ask you, Potter. I'm not letting you go kill yourself while I just sit here and worry. And anyway.. I'm sure I'd be better help than Lovegood and Longbottom combined." he said.
"Harry, Pansy's my friend and you know I'm.. I'm gay." he whispered.
Blaise kept pestering me about how you're seeing a girl but I kept disagreeing with him. But, do you really think I'm a fool, Draco? I've known you since we were children, Draco. Who is it?" she finished.
"Come in." he said.
“To me,” said Malfoy yet again.
"Blaise and Theo keep pestering me about the 'Gryffindor girl I'm shagging', Pansy keeps yelling at me for not making a choice, Severus was mad at me because he hates that I don't hate you, anymore.. Life is miserable, should I be happy, Harry?"
He tore open the seal and started reading.
He was so lost in his book, he didn't notice Harry looming over him.
Draco smiled. Harry was talking to him! He didn't hate him! And he was expecting more letters from him! Then, he frowned. Why weren't Harry's best friends telling him anything? Maybe, he should send some important news to Harry with his letters? Although.. He doesn't think Harry would like it very much. Maybe, that's why his friends weren't telling him.. But, he deserves to know what's happening.. He'll eventually find out when he comes to Hogwarts. Isn't it better to at least prepare him for what could happen?
Draco rolled his eyes.
"I'm the Malfoy heir, Harry. There are certain.. expectations from me. I'm their only child, I need to produce an heir. And.. besides.. Homosexuality isn't exactly praised amongst the purebloods. I'd be disowned. I don't know about my mother but.. Father, he'd.. He'd probably kill me or lock me up or I don't know.. And not to mention, you're you. Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the boy who defeated the Dark Lord.. I'm sure you know who my father supports.. What do you think he'd do with me if he finds out I'm- I'm dating you? Hypothetically speaking, of course. And and.. He said.. He said he's returning. What am I supposed to do?"
He lifted his head to look at Harry who was frowning. He traced the crease of his eyebrows with his hand and Harry relaxed.
Soon, it was time for everyone to come back and Draco was lying on Harry's bed, sulking.
Draco looked at her. Did she know, too?
Draco frowned. How should he get an answer from her? If only Harry had told his friends about their relationship..
At that, Harry's eyes widened and he stepped towards Draco.
"How was your first.. rebellious DADA session?" he asked.
Blaise huffed.
"Only with you, Potty."
“Just trying to make up to well-connected people as I reckoned. Zabini was there."
Ginny shrugged and the two of them sat down, later to be joined by Luna Lovegood.
Harry noticed Draco was shaking.
Malfoy reddened and so did Harry.
Once they were in the nearest closet, Draco hugged him.
"Harry, please." even Draco was pleading with him to not touch it.
It was Harry's first morning at the Burrow.
She rubbed his back.
"What is what?" asked Draco, innocently.
"I said.. Detention. On Saturday. Understood, Mr. Potter?"
Harry frowned.
"Yes, you are."
“Saw it. Just now. When I fell asleep in the exam.”
Draco stood up.
"Stop distracting me, you git." Harry replied and soared up.
He didn't dare look at Draco, although he could feel his eyes boring into his skull.
"Hey, it's alright." Harry said, sitting down beside Draco and holding him.
"I love how you still blush like a tomato after everything we've done."
"Er.. it started in fourth year.. Y'know the rumours of me kissing Draco.." replied Harry, blush deepening.
"She was crying", Ron asked. "Why would she kiss you while crying?"
"Dear Godric.. He didn't even go to Hogsmeade today because he was afraid of being taken away by his family and you're saying he cursed Katie?!"
"Horcruxes?" he whispered.
Harry grinned.
"I almost forgot.. Take this." Harry said, handing over the fake Galleon Hermione had given to him.
But he had.
Harry frowned.
"I know.. But I just.. My father.. What he did to Snape.. And he didn't even have a reason.. What if he forced my mother to..?"
"Harry! Harry!" Draco called.
Harry closed his eyes.
"Really, now? I see how the roles have reversed. A few months ago, it was me skipping lunch or dinner and you scolding me for it.. Remember when you sabotaged our Quidditch practice because I hadn't had lunch?" Harry chuckled. "You honestly think I'll let you starve, now?"
Harry rolled his eyes.
"Somebody's in a foul mood."
Draco stared at their entwined hands for a while before replying.
"Right."
"Sort of.. I don't really care. And I kind of told Blaise about us and have been avoiding him since."
"I.. I didn't know what to get you and I saw that at a jewellery shop when I was looking for a present for Molly and it was.. it reminded me of you.." Harry muttered. "Do you like it?" he whispered.
Ron shrugged.
"ACHOO!" Draco sneezed.
"Er.. not yet."
"And you didn't ask him anything about it?"
"I- I didn't think-"
"He.. he said Crouch was the one who sent him to Azkaban without a trial."
Harry gritted his teeth.
"Er.. Parkinson."
"I must not lies."
Pansy raised an eyebrow.
"If you want us to be." he replied after a few seconds of silence, looking away.
"Merlin's beard- Pans, what was that for?"
"Did you lock the door?" he asked, snuggling into Harry's chest.
His heart was racing. He'd never lied to his best friends like this, before. He felt so bad but he couldn't tell her. She wouldn't understand. Hell, he didn't understand, himself.
Draco snorted.
"And you're complaining because..?"
He leaned towards Harry's neck and started sucking on it. Harry groaned.
He wanted to kiss Harry. Harry could tell. He was continuously looking at Harry's lips instead of his eyes.
"And how far.. has this involvement gone?"
"Come with us.. I know you want to." Lovegood said in her dreamy voice.
Harry tried. He really tried but he couldn't prevent the sob from escaping his throat. And the tears from running down his cheeks.
Was he telling Draco to choose Harry? But he hated Harry! And who was he talking about? Who had he lost?
Draco chuckled and wiped his tears away.
Harry was pacing in his room, checking the time every five minutes.
"Krea-"
Harry hesitated.
Draco pursed his lips.
"Why wouldn't she say anything, then?"
"Hm? Oh.. Let me check it for dark arts, I know a spell.."
Draco frowned.
"2:00am."
Draco thought for a while then said, "Okay."
"And I can't leave my mother alone in that hell-hole, Harry." he whispered.
Draco sighed and sat down.
"Alright, mate.."
Harry groaned and kissed back, forgetting everything else.
“He might be . . .” Harry whispered hoarsely, peering down the alley next door. “Or maybe . . .” He hurried to look down the one beyond that.
Draco plopped on his bed and started eating. Better to eat without having to listen to a lecture from Pansy.
Draco's blush deepened.
"Then, make your decision. Time's running out."
"I'm scared, Harry.. What do you reckon they'll do to mother when she goes back alone?"
"Thought I'd do it with you."
"They hate you." Draco deadpanned.
"Shut up, Malfoy!" Neville snarled.
"Draco, wait! Get dressed, first."
"Please don't ever call me your dragon, again."
"The cloak." he whispered.
Hermione was smiling at him.
"Could you um.. Do you have more of those fake Galleons we used for the DA?" Harry asked.
"I know that! I just mean their whole family is evil and supporters of You-Know-Who!"
Draco smiled and buried his face in Harry's chest.
Draco nodded, again.
"Dray? Didn't go to Hogsmeade?"
"Er.. Because of you."
Harry ran to Flourish and Blotts.
“You're not even a prefect and even we can't dock points.” snarled Ron.
"Oh, er.. Draco, make yourself at home while you're here." he said. It was clear Mrs. Weasley had forced him to say that. Maybe, they should go to Grimmauld place, Harry thought.
"Why, Draco, things like these need only take three hours to happen." Blaise replied.
"What was Malfoy?" he asked, entering the dorm. It was empty save for Ron and Hermione who seemed to be discussing his boyfriend.
And so Harry and Draco sat down to discuss the events of their respective summers.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Harry."
"Yeah, that'd be better.."
"Called you what?" Harry asked, again.
"No idea. I haven't been on much gay dates, Potter."
"You are. A drama queen." Harry replied.
"It's just a nice day."
"Actually, we have heating charms in the dorms and on the beds, but how do you know about the common room?"
He went inside. Blaise was still staring at the door as if he couldn't believe what had just happened.
He grabbed his hand and observed it.
“Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione.. and Draco everything you’ve told me?”
Harry kissed him so violently he fell back.
"Dumbledore.." was all Harry managed to say before passing out.
"You did not write this by yourself." she declared.
"I'm not." he sneered.
Draco smiled, humourlessly.
"I'll try."
"What?"
"I'm going now, come Draco." she said and left, hurriedly.
"Draco.."
"Thank goodness." Cho said.
"Well, he's teaching me Occlumency."
"Harry, you scared me!"
"You seem happy, today." Draco whispered.
"Shut up, Potter."
"What are you going to tell Pansy?"
"I don't want to stop you from enjoying Christmas, Harry.. You can go, I'll stay here." he replied.
"I'll talk to them in my dorm. Already met Pans in the Prefect's carriage.."
"What in the name of Salazar Slytherin were you doing with flobberworms?" Draco asked, frowning.
"Honestly, Ron.. That doesn't mean he'd be evil too!" Hermione said, agitated.
“You’re a r-really good teacher, you know,” said Cho, with a watery smile. “I’ve never been able to Stun anything before.”
"I missed you." he said in a husky voice which sent shivers down Draco's spine.
Like I said everything is the same as in the books. However, since Harry liked Draco instead of Cho in Fourth year, the scenes with Cho and Harry obviously don't happen..
“I want to know where Sirius is!”
"Why, do you miss them, Malfoy? Got no one to irritate, have you?"
"Oh Draco, it's okay to be scared." said Harry and squeezed his hand. "And you are more brave than you know."
"Weasel?!" she barked and then coughed loudly when Draco glared at her.
Harry grinned.
"Unless.. Unless, you don't want me." Harry added in a low whisper.
"I was thinking.. Well, you turned yourself into Cho, before.."
"Draco, don't go."
“It’s only teachers that can dock points from Houses, Nott,” said Ernie at once.
Draco had entered the great hall with Parkinson at his side.
Draco snorted.
"I- They- You and Malfoy!"
Harry took a deep breath.
"So, are you going to tell us about Malfoy?" Hermione asked when they were getting off the train.
"I don't know." he whispered so low he didn't think Harry had heard him.
"What?"
"What's up?" asked Draco, seeing Harry lost in his thoughts.
"Nothing." Harry replied in a small voice.
The first task was over, Ron was finally talking to him, again, and his mind was still set on Malfoy.
Harry smiled. Draco.
"Dramatic as always, Malfoy. Where've you been?" Theo asked, pulling his arm back from Blaise and grabbing his hand, instead.
"Come on!" Draco said and took his hand to help him up.
"Er.. I didn't.. I didn't think about that.." he replied.
Draco slowly opened his eyes.
Draco leaned forward and pressed his lips on Harry's and the world stopped.
"Draco!"
"BLAISE!"
"Your father was there."
"I promise I'll let you know if something happens."
"Harry, calm down, dear." she said pulling him down the stairs. "Breathe." she said and went to the kitchen.
"Draco. Sleep."
"You think Draco cursed Katie?" Harry asked, his anger flaring.
Draco's eyes widened. How could she know something it took Draco ages to admit to just himself?
Potter was sleeping in a chair, his head resting on the desk. He looked so peaceful and beautiful with his messy black curls falling on his eyes.
Draco shifted under his gaze.
"Let me see it."
"Oh, right."
Harry swallowed.
“Harry! Harry, over here!” came Hermione's voice.
"I borrowed your cloak and snuck into the Gryffindor tower to get your uniform and bag, you complete idiot." Draco said, pointing towards Harry's things on the desk next to their bed.
"For 9 hours?"
"Why are you always late?"
It was time for the second task and Dobby had just given him the Gillyweed and told him he had to save "Young Master". He instantly knew what that meant. He had to save Draco. Draco was the thing he'd miss the most. Of course. He didn't know how he was going to explain that to Ron and Hermione. Right now, all he knew was that he needed to save Draco.
"Hm?"
"Hey." Draco said, sheepishly.
"I think it's stupid of you to blindly trust the git!" Ron yelled.
"Dobby was helping Winky! But then he heard someone entering the kitchen, Harry Potter Sir! And it was being Harry Potter Sir!"
Draco squirmed and Harry squeezed his hand, again.
Draco glared at him.
"Hey.."
"Sorry? No need. No need to apologise for something you are going to do over and over again." Harry said, closing his eyes to prevent the tears from escaping.
"Harry!"
Harry smiled. He did like what he saw. He liked it, a lot.
"Now, get out of here, Potter. And you, Draco.. Stay here, I need to have a little chat with you."
Harry smiled.
"I think there are like 3 Gryffindors staying at Hogwarts.."
"We're invited to the Burrow for Christmas.."
"W-what?"
Harry frowned.
Harry frowned but followed him.
Harry glanced at the owl who had brought all of this, feeling sorry for it. He'd buy a cage for Arcturus when they went to Diagon Alley.
Harry supressed a smile.
"We'll be ok." Harry said in between the kisses.
He wouldn't cry in front of Draco. He wouldn't.
"Are they more important than your happiness?"
"Merlin, Draco, are you shagging the Weasley girl?" Blaise asked, accusingly.
They were both lain on the cold floor of the old classroom, Draco sprawled over Harry's chest who was idly playing with Draco's hair, making him purr like a cat.
"I'm slightly offended Granger didn't reach out to any Slytherins for this rebellious group of yours. Not all of us are evil, you know?" Draco said, his head resting in Harry's lap who was playing with his hair.
"Well, I.. I was thinking how it'd be nice if we could go on a date.." Harry said, blushing.
He looked down, towards the floor and started.
"Draco, relax! I'm sure there will be Aurors to guard me." Harry said, rolling his eyes. "If you want, you can wear my invisibility cloak till you're on the train?"
"Harry, I'll be fine. They're my family, they won't hurt me."
Once outside the Great Hall, Harry slumped against the wall.
"What are you talking about, 'Mione?"
He thought he'd gotten far but he ran into something invisible- Draco - and they'd both fallen with a loud thud.
"Wait! I'm coming, too! Help me mount one." he said and Harry's friends looked baffled.
"Come on, quit reading for once, let's go flying!" said Harry, changing the topic.
"No, I'm not." said Draco, his teeth chattering.
"Maybe, he was acting?"
He bumped into Molly on the stairs.
"Draco?"
He ran out, the tears refusing to stay in his eyes, anymore. As soon as he was in a secluded hallway, he broke down.
"She's joined Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad." Harry replied.
“And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,” said Hermione viciously.
"Mhm, your face says otherwise." he replied and got up.
Harry ended up catching the Snitch as usual and also ended up with a whiny boyfriend.
"Draco, you're late."
"Well, there has to be a reason he trusts Severus, right? I mean Dumbledore's not stupid, Harry.."
He smiled.
"It's fine."
"I did the same. But Remus said it must be stronger, the memory. Try again, think of something else." Harry said, encouraging Draco.
"What are you smiling about?"
"I just.. I don't know.. I was thinking about my family and.. well, the future and I.. I'm scared."
“Very good, Potter. Now turn around, nice and slowly, and give that to me.”
Draco hesitantly pulled back.
"Is "Won-Won" gone?" came Hermione's waspish voice from behind him.
"Sorry, Pans, I didn't realise I was ignoring you guys so much. Tell you what, I'll do homework with Harry.. Come on, let's go to the common room." he said, closed his books and stood up to be pulled into a crushing hug by Pansy.
"He's the one you ran away with, isn't he?" Pansy asked, rolling her eyes.
"Well, I'm sure Voldemort would be grateful considering you'd have done something he hasn't been able to do despite getting numerous chances."
"Malfoy and Potter. Detention for fighting again, I reckon? Foolish students, always fighting! If only Dumbledore would let me-"
"I know but.. I just.."
"This is amazing. The Hogwarts founders were great wizards! Merlin, a room that provides you with anything you require! Must've taken excellent spellwork and-"
"Your friends gone?"
Harry swallowed. Draco looked breath-taking. He was wearing full-white and Harry thought he'd never seen something as beautiful.
Draco looked up from the book he was reading to see Pansy.
"Dear Merlin, maybe I was right. He really is a barmy old wizard.. Maybe, the age has finally gotten to him?"
"Are you crazy? What will I tell Ron?!"
"Then, you were rude to the first friend I'd ever made."
Draco may have helped him a lot but he still wrote the essay, himself!
"Remedial what?"
"Potter, you oaf, geroff me! I'm hungry and there's someone in this room and my clothes are not on this bed."
"First of all, how?" asked Ron and Hermione rolled her eyes.
"Sorry, Dray.. But I think it's better if you stun me as well." Pansy said.
Harry had a smug look on his face. He had never thought he'd see the day Snape was so flustered. It was oddly satisfying.
"Dumbledore! I told him about Snape and Nott and he said the matter wasn't of great importance and that he trusts Snape!"
"You did, didn't you? Well, what about now? Will you stand by your father or will you choose me?"
"I.. Uh.. Mum.. Mum was calling you two down.." Ron said and hurriedly left the room.
After what seemed like hours but were only a few seconds, he felt strong arms gripping him.
Harry caressed his cheek.
He stirred in his sleep.
"Harry, calm down, dear. It's just 20 minutes.." Molly said.
"Do we have to?" Draco whined.
Ron shook his head.
Draco finally looked him in the eye. He had no sort of emotion on his face.
Snape raised an eyebrow.
"Pathetic." Harry finishes.
"Hey." said Harry and pressed a small kiss on Draco's lips.
"Hermione reckons it's cheating.."
He hears a lot of gasp and he thinks someone is screaming but he pays no heed to the audience as he's having way too much fun.
"Um.. I.."
Feeling slightly reckless, he closed his fingers around the dusty ball’s surface. Nothing happened. Then, they heard a voice he knew well.
"I heard Nott arguing with Crabbe and Goyle about looking out for him or something.."
"Harry-"
"Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix."
Harry went back to opening his presents. He'd received a book on defensive spells from Hermione and Ron had sent him a box of Bertie Bott's beans and a box of chocolate frogs.. And then there was the present from Draco which he hadn't expected considering Draco was short on money. Harry smiled as he opened the present to reveal a silver watch. He took his old one off and put it on.
But he couldn't just not go.. Draco would be furious, then, too. Harry sighed.
"I was not."
"She's stubborn and wouldn't let me go till.. "the message sunk in" or something."
Everyone was talking about the Yule Ball. Ron was complaining about not having a date to the ball, yet.
It was a wonderful first kiss.
Draco came closer and he felt his friends tense.
Harry dragged Draco away from them.
"I didn't mean to hurt you, I'm just.. a coward." he said.
"Harry.. It would be unsafe for me to write to you."
"It's Harry bloody Potter."
"Well, what are you waiting for? Go find Harry!" he said and they all came to their senses, running out.
"I.."
He caught Draco's eyes who seemed to be as curious as him so they followed Snape and Nott out.
"Oh. Don't you.. Don't you want them to know?" Harry asked, worriedly.
"N-no. Just me." he replied.
Blaise stared at him.
"For "disrespecting" him.. Don't laugh.. We were arguing in class like always and I said yes to something. And he said "yes, sir" and I replied.." Harry buried his face in his hands. "There's no need to call me "sir", Professor."
"Why are they being nice to me?" he mumbled.
“Mistletoe,” said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head.
"You don't understand, Potter.. My parents.. My father.."
Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry nodded.
"Well, that's the truth.. Isn't it, Pans?" Draco replied.
"I'll go now before they start wondering where I ran off to." he said.
Draco blushed, again.
"Yeah, I'll do that.."
Draco rolled his eyes.
"For what?"
Right. He'd just saved Draco in the lake.
“I was — trying to get my Firebolt!” Harry croaked.
"I hope you'll be fine sharing Fred and George's room with Harry?"
"To Slughorn's stupid party.." Harry replied.
"Hullo Draco. Welcome to the Burrow.." she said and Draco's eyes snapped to her. She smiled. "Molly says to make yourself at home while you're here."
"How could anyone have gotten that necklace into Hogwarts when we were all checked and our owls get scanned?"
"Was your girlfriend in there?" Blaise interrupted.
"I can't believe you took out the time for this..Considering everything that's going on.."
"S-Slughorn?"
He patted Draco on the shoulder to wake him.
"Of course, Harry. But, we can't just burst into Malfoy Manor and collect him." Dumbledore replied, gesturing Harry to sit down which he did.
Draco's eyes shot up from Harry's hand.
Inside the room was the coziest bed Draco had ever seen. There was also a fire and the colours of the room were Gryffindor red which slightly annoyed Draco. There was also an armchair by the fireplace and a bookshelf.
"We both have classes now, but.. see me in the same room at midnight." he said and Draco beamed.
Draco dragged Harry inside.
"No!" he yelled and Hermione frowned.
"W-what?"
"I don't-"
"Yeah well.."
"I'm going to miss the Keeper tryouts, too." he said and sighed.
“Get out!” she said, standing up.
He brought his broom closer to Draco's.
"When is it ever, Pans?"
"He works here, now.."
Hermione smiled and surprisingly didn't ask any questions.
"Draco, you're shivering."
"NEVERMIND THAT, WHAT WAS THAT AT QUIDDITCH PRACTICE, YESTERDAY?"
"Harry, why are you glaring at the ceiling?" came Hermione's voice.
"Stop it, already, Draco." Harry said to Draco who was on the floor, laughing while clutching his stomach.
Harry gulped. He supposed he had to, now..
"You're beautiful."
Harry ran to him and hugged him.
"Let me heal it, Harry."
"It's perfect." he whispered and smiled, wiping away his tears. "You're perfect." he said as he leaned in to snog Harry senseless.
“Neville!” said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him.
Not bad.. Harry wondered how Draco did. No way of knowing, though..
"Well yes, but I mean.. You have Potter, don't you? Who would I have? Anyway, this isn't about me."
"Why not?" he asked, taking Draco's hand.
"Whatever you say.. As long as I don't wake up, alone." he yawned.
"Potter, you're so daft, she fancies you!"
"Harry?"
"Do you have another chocolate cauldron?"
"Harry, I don't care about Voldemort but mother-"
"It's a huge castle."
"Well.. He must have his reasons.. He's a strange man after all." said Draco.
." he replied, loud enough for everyone to hear.
"I forgot my Defence essay in my dorm." Draco announced before rushing away from Blaise's accusatory glare.
Great, now he's stuttering.
"Come on, Mrs. Weasley and Dumbledore will Side-Along us." Harry whispered.
"Ron and Mione seem to think I'm great at DADA and want me to teach them, like you.."
"You know what they are?"
"No, Draco, you can't!"
Harry pulled the fake Galleon from his pocket to call Draco.
"What is this?"
Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry sighed.
"Come on, let's go." said Harry, taking Draco's hand and instantly letting go of it.
Harry shrugged.
"What the fu-" he said but was interrupted by Harry's lips on his.
Harry smiled.
"Hmm.."
"I don't think I'll be able to move from this bed for a while."
"I bet the Ravenclaw showers are empty." Harry whispered when he "accidentally" bumped into Draco. Draco's eyes widened and a blush formed on his cheeks as he made his way to the changing rooms.
? What is this? What are we? What are we doing?"
And everyone who didn't see their kissing incident and thought it was just a rumour would now be confirmed it was real.
"It's not the same." he repeated.
Draco gestured to his book.
“Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that’s all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days.”
"Sounds good. It's a date." Harry replied.
"The end. Right. End of our relationship, I suppose."
"I didn't say anything."
Pansy frowned.
Harry shook his head and cast a warming charm on Draco but he was still shivering.
"Thought you knew."
"Fine, give it here." he said and Harry smiled.
"Why are you so afraid?" Harry asked, cupping Draco's face with his hands.
"I'm not cute and I'm taller than you, Potter. Besides, why would you think I'd want such a pet?"
"Pansy, you cow, you spoiled the book for me! I hadn't reached that part, yet!"
Harry slowly leaned in and gently pulled him into a kiss, not sure of how Draco would react but Draco responded as passionately as ever.
"I.. I don't.. Not really?"
"Fine, Draco. Merlin! I won't use any other spells from the book!"
Harry zoned out midway Hermione's speech.
"No."
, his brain supplied) who was nibbling the owl treats.
Harry bit his lip.
Hermione still looked incredulous but she didn't say anything.
"I'm always right, Harry."
At 2:36 PM, Draco Malfoy rushed in.
I have the headcannon that Snape and Narcissa Malfoy are like really good friends and Snape is Draco's Godfather. (though, I still hate Snape)
"Well, no.. But.."
"That's weird. Dumbledore not talking to his favourite student? I don't believe it."
"So, I would not only lose my family but also my friends."
"Don't leave me alone with them!" Ron whisper-yelled and rushed out of the dorm.
"Hush, Draco. What kind of a boyfriend would I be if I left my boyfriend alone on Christmas?"
"Yeah.."
"Gladly." Harry said and pulled Draco into a deep kiss.
“Saved Weasley’s neck, haven’t you?” Draco said to Harry. “I’ve never seen a worse Keeper . . . but then he was born in a bin. . . . Did you like my lyrics, Potter?” said Draco and smirked.
"Let me tell you a story from second year."
Draco rolled his eyes.
"DRACO, YOU LITTLE SHIT! YOU SAID BREAKFAST WAS OVER. IT'S 6AM."
"I won't be alone, Potter, I have other friends."
Ron waved at Harry and followed her into the train.
Draco was still giggling.
"Harry, you're such an idiot, I'm going to kill you." said Draco, applying Dittany to Harry's hand.
"Harry, dear! What are you doing up at this hour?" she shrieked.
The blond grabbed him by his collar and pulled him into a fierce hug.
"Like what you see, Potter?", Draco smirked.
"I don't want to eat."
"That's great!" Draco said, looking impressed.
Draco tried to reach for his book but-
Harry shook his head and closed his eyes to prevent the tears from falling.
"We could.. If she wants to, we could take her, too?" Harry asked and looked at Molly.
"Harry.. Did someone do that to you?"
"Just shocked, I reckon.. Never thought I'd be brave enough to leave.. But I wasn't really brave, was I? I left because I was scared of what they'd do to me.."
"See something you like?" Draco whispered.
Two days later, Arcturus returned along with his letter. Draco frowned. Harry didn't receive his letter? He really wished he could talk to owls.
"No idea."
"Yeah, I suppose the house elves know I'm here.." he replied, flushing.
"Draco- What.."
"I'll see you, later, Draco." Harry said and started walking away.
She was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise.
Draco tensed in his arms.
"Have you ever given us a chance to be friendly?" asked Draco, raising an eyebrow.
"For fuck's sake.."
"It'll make your choice, easier."
He dramatically sneered and stood up but Harry grabbed his arm.
Draco had come to his dorm today since Harry was busy with Dumbledore's private lessons and Draco wasn't well so he decided to rest a little. But just when he was outside the door, he heard yelling.
Draco was so enraged and so done with all the lying and everything that he didn't care, anymore. Plus it was just Blaise, he wasn't associated with any death eaters.
"Okay, mum."
Draco gasped and cupped his cheeks in his hands.
Several of the Death Eaters laughed. A harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry’s left said triumphantly, “The Dark Lord always knows!”
"I think I told you to shut up. Hurry in, McGonagall's heading this way!"
“We’ll be in the library, Harry,” said Hermione firmly, and she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble staircase.
Harry smiled.
"Well, stay under my cloak, then. Just watch. You can practice, later."
says that.. There were surprisingly many other theories about the state of their relationship.. One of them said Harry was obviously straight and in love with Ginevra Weasley -what???- and he was just friends with Draco. Then, there were the angry people. How could the Chosen One choose a Death Eater's son? Harry snorted. Idiots.
"Ron-" Hermione squeaked but Harry interrupted.
He was right. He woke up on the cold hard floor with the sun shining in his eyes. Alone.
"Well, considering he's my boyfriend-"
"How do you know what the Slytherin dormitory is like?"
Draco snorted.
Draco sat down on the front desk, facing Harry.
Harry's tone stung. He felt his eyes water.
Draco closed his eyes.
Harry didn't realise he'd been screaming till Arthur, Ginny and Hermione woke up and came out.
Blaise turned to look at him.
"Don't worry, Harry. We've helped you through the last two tasks and we will keep helping you with the final one, too! I'm sure you'll succeed, Harry."
"I.. I'm sorry, Dray.. I was just following Umbridge's orders!"
Blaise frowned.
Pansy looked at Draco, apologetically.
“Harry?” said Hermione again.
"Thanks, Gin, but I'm really not hungry."
"Oh.. It wanted to put me in Slytherin. I refused."
"A nice day?"
Harry glared at the floor.
Harry took a deep breath.
"But he's Malfoy!"
"He cursed Bell! He wants to kill someone!"
"That's not.. I mean.. It's Hermione! Why do they think I'm better than her? And why do they think I'm so great at it just because I've managed to luckily escape Voldemort a few times?"
Harry sighed.
"Left you alone, have they?" he said, not wanting to make her suspicious. Although from what Harry said, she's already suspicious.
"Yeah, don't tell anyone."
Walking back from Hagrid's hut, Harry had forgotten about the day's events but as soon as he saw Draco's face upon entering the Room of Requirement, he remembered.
Ron and Hermione were fighting over something and Harry was busy staring at Draco.
"I know but I'm his friend and I'm supposed to knock some sense into him when he's being an idiot!"
Neville was frowning, Luna was smiling and Hermione was rolling her eyes.
There was the broomstick.. And some more money.. And some clothes.. Draco's school robes, the Potion ingredients Narcissa probably bought that day.. And some books..
Draco frowned.
"That sick man is my father and my mother is never going to leave him!" he yelled.
"The half-blood Prince? Who could that be?"
He hears Moody shout something behind him but before he can draw his wand, Harry does it.
"Where.. where is Dr- Malfoy?"
“Oh, don’t go!” said Cho, sounding tearful again. “I’m really sorry to get all upset like this. . . . I didn’t mean to. . . .”
Harry glares at the boy who paused to look at his minions and snicker.
"Brought you lunch." she said, setting the tray on the bed.
"No, it's Ron."
"Wait.. Zabini and Nott..?"
"I promise I won't." he said, looking afraid and clutching Harry's arm tightly as if Harry would run away.
“Somewhere about . . . here . . .” he said.
"Well, you can't just call me that and expect me not to react." replied Draco, cheeks getting redder and redder.
"I.. I don't think I can go to the ball with you, Potter."
Harry looked at Ron and his ears were red.
Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, “Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort’s secrets. And as for Mr. Malfoy..” Dumbledore paused to think. "I must say I would prefer if you didn't tell him but if you must.. Make sure you really do trust him."
He blew the candles and Harry clapped and sang the muggle birthday song as he cut the cake. He held up the cake slice as if to feed Harry and when Harry opened his mouth, he smashed the cake in his cake.
"I thought you were just being dramatic when you said you're in love with him."
"Er.. Thank you, Professor." he said.
"Malfoy's staring at you." he hears Hermione say as she sits down next to him.
Ron drew the curtains back.
Draco pursed his lips.
"I don't know why they thought he's the person I'd miss most, ok? They probably heard that rumour about me kissing him and thought- Anyway, I didn't kiss him."
Harry frowned.
"What happened?" he asked.
"Maybe he just angrily said that and didn't mean it?" he offered but Blaise shook his head.
"It's not that you lot are evil, but you aren't exactly friendly, are you?" Harry replied.
"Sirius' whole family was evil, too.. But, he turned out fine, didn't he?" he snapped.
"Harry.."
"Hard not to notice, actually." Pansy said and snorted. "So.. How's things going with Potter?"
"Fine, better." Harry replied.
"What's- What happened to your hand?"
"Good luck finding the snitch, Potty." Draco said to him up in the air.
"Looking for you, Harry. Come on, let's sit somewhere, I need to talk to you." he said, gesturing towards the Three Broomsticks.
“The what?” said Hermione, sharply.
"Er.. write lines."
"Really, Draco? Maybe, I should just tell Professor Snape to lecture you, again."
"The straights." Harry repeated and laughed. "Where do the gays go, then?"
Draco was eavesdropping on his father's Floo call with some Ministry official. He finally had his answer to why Harry hadn't replied to his letter.
Draco was silent and was clutching Harry's arm, tightly.
"Hullo Potter."
"Oh my God, you're bleeding, Harry! What have you done?"
Harry rolled his eyes.
"Ron, it's not your decision who Harry dates." Hermione said.
"No one knows what?" Harry asked, confused.
Blaise followed him.
Harry rolled his eyes.
It smelled a little odd. Like a broomstick handle but there was also a hint of treacle tart. The most prominent smell, however, was a familiar smell with a hint of.. coconut?
"Huh. Harry?"
"Just answer me Draco. Me or your father?! I'm sure Dumbledore can help you and your mother leave that sick man!" he yelled.
"Hey."
"What?" he said, finally looking up from his book.
Harry felt his cheeks heat up.
"I know you're still here."
Harry cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the words etched onto them:
"I've always liked it.." Draco mumbled, looking hurt.
"I.. I didn't even notice what you were wearing!"
"Of course, you do.. Breaking rules like your ridiculous, arrogant father. Detention on Saturday, then."
Harry sighed and then, almost screamed when Draco appeared from under his Invisibility cloak.
"Why do you have to assume I did this?"
Harry rolled his eyes and helped Draco on his own Thestral as there weren't any others.. He really didn't have any more time to waste.
Draco looked at him, he looked terrified.
"T'was fine. Except the fact that he's eating rats to survive."
Harry flushed from embarrassment.
"We're good, Ron. You know I love it at the Burrow but I don't want to make both Draco and your family uncomfortable."
"Nothing new about that. He must be plotting some evil scheme to hex me, probably." he says, not looking at Hermione or Malfoy, as he puts food in his plate.
Draco had been frowning throughout Pansy's rant. Had he really paid that little attention to his friends?
"What in the name of Merlin's-"
"Sorry, Draco, but I can't be late!" Harry said and ran away.
Draco sighed.
"What about him?" Blaise - the sodding idiot - asked.
"Yes, mum." Harry replied, rolling his eyes.
"Really, I thought you were past those stupid muggleborn prejudices but I guess not." Harry replied, furious. He'd really thought Draco had changed. But he guessed Ron was right. Family does matter.
"N-nothing."
"That's.. I.. No! She.. What?"
"What are you pestering him for, now?" Blaise asked in a bored voice.
"No, I meant.. us. What are we to each other? Are we.. Are we boyfriends?" he asked, his cheeks reddening and heart thumping, loudly.
Harry stood up to leave before he decided to do something incredibly stupid such as walking to the Slytherin tables, pushing Parkinson away and snogging Draco or yelling at him for leaving. No, he needed to get out.
Draco took a deep breath and took off to class.
She was leaning in, closing her eyes-
"Er.. I don't really understand.. Harry's saying something about the Malfoy boy.." Molly whispered to Arthur.
"Draco? You still here?"
Draco closed his eyes. Sleep had almost overtaken his mind when Harry spoke again.
Harry closed his eyes and shook his head.
"You know.." Pansy started and he could feel a lecture coming.
"Thanks, Mione, you're the best!"
Draco looked at him and he smiled.
"Maybe, we should.. stop seeing each other."
Draco looked at Harry.
"Wizards, I believe." deadpanned Draco.
"Sorry.. I'll get dressed and.. yeah.."
“No one —” said Harry, trying to pull away from her.
"Yes, yes, whatever.. Just, no more trying unknown spells on anyone."
"Find a place and stay there at midnight. I'll find you."
Harry was about to get up and kiss his boyfriend, again when he saw the look on his face.
"Ah, Harry.. Ms. Granger just told me everything that happened.. Arthur had sent a Patronus and luckily, I wasn't away on a job." Dumbledore said.
"Is he your friend, now?" Neville asked.
"Could you teach me the Patronus Charm?"
"What happened?" Draco asked.
Draco was heading to the library when he was suddenly pulled into a broom closet.
Draco sighed and closed his eyes.
Shit.
Draco rolled his eyes but didn't say anything.
"I.. I'm so sorry, Harry! I'll um leave-" she said and ran out the door.
Harry rolled his eyes.
"Better leave them alone!" she whispered and left.
"He's actually lost it." Draco whispered to himself.
"Draco, I told you-"
"It should matter." he whispered.
"What time is it?"
“I didn’t know,” she said, not looking at Harry.
Draco took a deep breath.
"And you've been to straight ones?" Harry asked, raising his eyebrows.
"Why, is that Draco Malfoy?"
Harry rolled his eyes.
"Sometimes.. I wonder how life would've been if I'd let the hat put me in Slytherin.."
"Um.. I'll check on him." Hermione said, leaving them alone with Luna. Neville and Ginny had already left to change their robes.
They danced for a while and Harry was lost in Draco's eyes and had almost leaned in to kiss him when Filch burst in, dragging Theodore Nott who was soon taken outside by Snape.
"You're such a little shit." he replied, cleaning his face with a handkerchief an elf had provided.
"Draco?"
As they were walking to the dungeons, Pansy asked him the question again.
"..."
"My happiness does not matter."
"WELL MAYBE I DON'T WANT THIS RELATIONSHIP TO CONTINUE!"
"C-come on!" he said and dragged Harry outside.
Harry nodded.
"Hog's Head? I didn't want to draw too much attention to myself. I'll look like a maniac talking to myself.. Oh and Hermione wanted to meet up to talk about something. You can come along."
"My mother.. She.. She said awful things about my father. She hated him.. I don't understand how they got together.. It's so confusing."
"Expecto Patronum."
He rolled his eyes.
Hermione came inside.
"Interesting proposition." Draco said, closing his book, rapidly. "Well then, let's go."
"What? Why?"
Later, in his dorm, Hermione storms in.
"Why's that?"
“Professor Snape, sir — oh — sorry —”
"Hm?"
"Blaise. It is not her. Now, shut up. I'm not bound to answer any of your ridiculous questions." he said, taking off the scarf and putting it on his bed.
"Ron, you're choking."
"I couldn't hate you even if I wanted to." he said and Draco beamed.
"What happened?"
"I thought I made that clear when we started all this what my parents stand for.." Draco, trying not to let his voice break.
Suddenly, he found himself on the bed underneath Harry.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.”
"Oh.." said Draco, tensing.
"Harry, the snow might end by the time I go to the Slytherin dorm and get dressed!"
They stared at each other for a while before Harry broke the silence.
"No, you should.. He should know.." Draco replied.
They sat quietly in the room for a while.
"STOP. BLOODY. LAUGHING."
"Master." he spat. "Kreacher hopes you liked Kreacher's present." he said and smiled like a maniac.
"Let's eat." Harry announced.
"I think I'd rather sleep with my dragon."
"No! D- Draco? Draco!" he yelled.
"Because it will make it less stupid and possibly enjoyable."
"Yes, well, I didn't think Blaise'd be interested.. And at any rate, I've been gone for three days not three months, how'd I bloody miss this?"
His eyes snapped to Harry and widened as he realised who was standing in front of him.
"I talked to Professor Dumbledore." Molly said once they'd all finished dinner. "He said it's safe for you to go to school, Draco. No one can take you from there as long as he's there."
Draco nodded.
On the way, he filled Draco in with the details of the dream and what Kreacher had said..
"I am the Malfoy heir, Potter. There are certain expectations of my parents from me. And I need to fulfill them."
Draco looked at her and shook his head.
Draco smiled and pulled him into another kiss.
"I er.. What do you want to know?"
"So, how was your OWLs result?" Harry asked, trying to lighten the mood.
He made his best puppy eyes.
Draco closed his eyes and said the words after a few seconds. Nothing happened. Draco frowned.
"Hi."
"Huh? No, she told me not to." he replied.
"To the Room of Requirement, Potter. We're not talking here."
Draco blushed.
"If anything happens to him, I will never forgive you." he snarled and walked away.
"Thanks."
"How can I stay mad at you when you look at me with those eyes?" he replied.
He looked to his feet.
"Poisoned."
"What happened?"
"As much as I like our position, I really don't want to wake up with back pain, again, Draco."
"Come with me, please. Don't go to the Manor! I.. I'll talk to Dumbledore, the Order, anyone! They'll help, I promise.. Please don't go."
He took Harry's hands in his hands and looked up at him with teary eyes.
"Young Master Draco Sir.." Dobby said, nodded to him and went back to his kitchen duties.
She was interrupted by a large eagle owl that had burst into the room and flown towards Draco. He had a letter and a huge package.
"Where are you going?"
"Er.. sorry.. Forgot we were going as friends." he muttered and gestured for Draco to enter the room.
Draco looked to the floor, feeling awkward.
Harry listened to Draco's muttering with a fond smile on his face while he got dressed.
"Come on, Harry." Dumbledore said, softly.
"A what?" replied Draco, looking up from his book.
"Henry's mother."
"I heard.. How's Weasley?"
"Maybe, I should've stayed in my dorm, tonight." Harry mumbled and laid back in bed.
"I'm-" *cough* "fine-" *cough* "Herm-" *cough*
Harry didn't let go.
"Okay." Draco replied.
“What’s the time? Have I missed breakfast?”
Draco snorted.
"Of course she bloody did."
“Liar.” She shook his head again. “Your Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Potter. You had your head in my fire. With whom have you been communicating?”
Breaking the kiss after a few moments, he said, "Did that show you how much I want you, Potter?"
"Don't be daft, Harry. Wouldn't everyone wonder why Draco Malfoy is suddenly attending a rebellious group meeting led by his arch-nemesis."
"Don't worry, I saved her from being scarred for life like me." Ron said and grunted.
Ron shrugged.
Pansy furrowed her eyebrows.
"He never sleeps at this time." Ron said, pulling the curtains and letting out a shriek upon seeing Draco and Harry peacefully sleeping in each other's arms; fully naked save for the blanket that was thankfully covering the parts of their bodies Ron didn't ever want to look at.
Draco smiled.
"See you at night!" he yelled, turning to see Draco's wide-opened-mouth while running.
"Good luck."
"Well yes, but-"
"Er.. I don't-"
They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the alley beside it. There was nobody there.
"I don't think so, Potty."
Harry heard muffled sobs when he was outside the room. He went in. Draco had opened the package and it's contents were sprawled over the whole bed.
"Quiet, Ron! I'll explain, later.. whenever we have time." Harry whispered.
Draco shrugged.
"Draco, quit sulking in your room. Your mother's suspicious.. I told her the whole You-Know-Who returning and Cedric Diggory's sudden death has gotten to you."
"I don't know, probably." he replied, unattentively. He was busy wondering why the characters in the book he was reading wouldn't kiss already.
"Professor Snape is right, Draco.."
Harry smiled. It was good to see Draco, especially after how miserable he had been the whole summer.
"Obviously not, Potter."
"How did you find out?"
It was past midnight. They were lain in the same bed. Draco was sprawled over Harry, holding him tightly. Harry was playing with Draco's hair.
"You knew he was a death eater."
"I'll do it in the morning, Mione."
Dobby was wearing an atrocity. He had one parrot green sock with black birds on it and one bright red one with gold stars on it. To top it off, he was wearing a weird, royal blue outfit.
Harry blushed.
"Shit, no." Draco whispered.
"Just sit at your own table, tonight, Potter. We'll see later. Now, I have Prefect's duties." Draco said and ran off.
"What do you want?"
"Happy Christmas." said Draco between the kisses.
"Harry?" he whispered.
"No, Harry. I do admit some people's words hurt me but.. I could never regret being able to kiss you whenever I want." he said and pecked Harry's lips.
"Oh and don't worry, no one will be rude to you or they'll have to face the wrath of Molly Weasley." she said and left.
Hermione rolled her eyes.
"Oh.. he's back, then.."
Draco looked gobsmacked.
"Why are you so cold?" he said and took his scarf off to wrap it around Harry's neck.
"Well, how was it?" Ron asked and Harry made a disgusted face.
Harry threw a pillow at him and he threw it back, which led to a pillow fight, which eventually led to Harry tripping and falling on top of Draco on their bed, which led to snogging which turned into something more.
"I know that but you heard Snape and Nott!"
"Harry, mate, you can talk to us." came Ron's voice from his other side.
"How come Dumbledore chose Weasley over you?" said Draco, incredulously.
Pansy was probably comforting him.
Harry wiped his tears.
"I dunno.." Draco replied thinking back to what Severus had once said to him about not making the right choice. "I still feel like Dumbledore wouldn't trust him unless he was absolutely sure.."
"Why don't you start by telling me the truth?" he whispered and Draco shivered.
"You are not skipping class on the first day of being back!"
“I’m not here,” he said, sounding perplexed. “None of the rest of us are here. . . .”
"I don't know what to do, I.."
"Harry, please." Draco pleaded.
Everyone was staring at them, Draco busied himself by grabbing Arcturus and his package and leaving to their temporary room.
"I know.." he grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him into a sloppy kiss.
"Pansy told me about that place." he said. "Now, can we please get inside some place before I freeze to death?"
Harry shrugged and left the room. When he came back with coffee, he saw Draco was back to reading his book and the pygmy puff was on Draco's shoulder. Harry smiled.
"Oh.. I was. Until I went to the dorm and saw-" Ron visibly shuddered. "-unspeakable things."
"Wha..? Arcturus?"
Draco nodded.
"She probably knows you'd deny it like you did last year." he replied, sounding irritated.
Harry snorted.
“You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.”
"Honestly, next time, I'm just going to transfigure our bed back into the desk to wake you up."
Harry took a deep breath.
"So.. You're saying it was someone from outside?"
"Think of it as choosing between the right and wrong, Draco.. Maybe, it'll make your choice, easier."
Draco nodded, again.
"Pinky has brought Master Draco his lunch." said Pinky, the only house elf allowed in his room at this point..
Harry shrugged.
"Sorry, I-" he started but was interrupted by Pansy Parkinson suddenly barging into their compartment.
"Sorry for disappearing, I saw Neville and well Trevor.."
His eyes searched for platinum blond hair but it was nowhere to be seen.
"Does that mean you plan to.. join Voldemort?"
Harry didn't let go of Draco's hand and didn't leave the compartment throughout their ride back home. He was leaving Draco alone in that hell-hole for the entire summer..
"We don't have to go if you don't want to! It wouldn't be the first Christmas I spent at Hogwarts.." Harry said. "And anyway, we might have the whole dormitory for us instead of sneaking up here."
"Just please come out alive."
"So Far Yet So Close..? Is this a muggle book, Dray?"
"Oh, Draco.. Don't you think it's still better than sulking like this and making assumptions about what could happen?"
“The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,” said Nott, pointing towards a tiny silver badge upon his robes.
There was a pause.
Harry was flooded with relief. Dumbledore was here, Draco would be safe.
Draco nodded and hugged Harry.
"At any rate.. are you serious about this involvement of yours?"
"You're thinking of Finnigan while being in bed with me.
"Favourite student? He hasn't talked to me even once!"
Draco smirked, maniacally and opened his mouth to say something but Hermione interrupted him.
"Dumbledore took the blame.. He's gone.. I don't know what we're going to do, now.."
"I.. She would've told my father! Draco, I thought you'd understand!"
Draco spluttered.
"Shut up, Potter."
It was almost time for him to go prepare dinner. He needed to be quicker.
"He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five."
"How am I supposed to see you when you're invisible?" Harry argued and helped Draco up.
If only he could write to Draco or Floo-call him.. He thought of the two-way mirror Sirius had given him.. His eyes watered.
"Er.. I.. It didn't go well."
"Well, I.. I did make a deal with Pansy that I would go with her.."
Harry giggled.
"I'm not dying, Malfoy. I can walk, myself."
"Oh, I forgot to ask you," said Hermione brightly, glancing over at the Ravenclaw table, "what happened on your date with Cho?"
Harry nodded.
"There was an emergency, they had to go. He's alright." she said and Draco's eyes snapped to her.
"I know but you did tell Severus, he must have done something.."
"That's a great idea! Let's do that.. You take my invisibility cloak wih you in the morning."
"Thanks Dobby."
He giggled and pecked Draco on his cheek.
"I mean you could.." he mumbled.
All of Harry's friends were still gaping at the two Slytherins.
She coughed lightly and Mr. Weasley looked up from the Evening Daily Prophet he was reading.
"Do you have any idea what you are doing, Draco?" Snape asked, furrowing his eyebrows.
"Harry.. Didn't we "hate" each other, too? Look at us, now.. I'm sure your parents loved each other very much and that is why they married each other.."
“I didn’t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?” asked Harry while Draco waved his wand over the parcel.
"Oh Salazar, is it.. is it Granger?!" Blaise asked.
"No!"
No sign of Draco Malfoy or Narcissa Malfoy.
"But I don't-"
"Why was Chang staring at you?" Draco sneered.
"Come on."
"But.."
"You're not mad at me?"
"As much as I like it when you spit out my last name like that, I prefer it when you call me Harry."
Harry wasn't convinced but he nodded.
"Well, pack them up because we're not using room, anymore." said Harry, gesturing towards his books.
Draco started giggling.
"Draco!" Pansy yelled so loud, the entire Hall was staring at them. He looked at Harry who was looking at them curiously. He raised his eyebrows as to ask Draco what's up. Draco returned a pained expression which made him smile.
"Sh-shut up, Potter. Malfoys don't blush."
Draco bit Harry's lip.
He went inside.
Draco's lips were trembling.
"Sod off. It's snowing, anyway."
He realised she had asked him something..
"So, my suspicions were true. Who's the girl?"
"I can understand that." came Dumbledore's voice.
Crabbe huffed and left. Goyle followed.
He woke up with the light shining in his face. He was in Fred and George's bedroom, again. He checked his watch. 11 AM. His eyes snapped to check if Arcturus was still there. He was, thankfully. Harry got up and ran out the door.
"I promise I'll try not to die."
Draco was shaking his head, frantically.
"You two do know I'm sitting right here between you, right?" Draco said, still staring at Harry who just winked at him. He winked at him! In the bloody Great Hall! Where anyone could've seen! His eyes moved to Uncle Severus who was luckily busy eating.
"But you care about me, right? Then, listen to me. We shouldn't meet every night."
"Gross, don't do that."
"Oh Merlin, you-" Draco said and burst out laughing, again. "You.. look so.. fucking funny.. when you.."
"You reminded me of Dudley back in Madam Malkins."
They were cuddling in their desk-bed after some making out and.. other things..
“Harry?” Ron called.
"As sure as you are about Snape." he said, without breaking eye-contact.
"So you're saying I shouldn't tell him?" Harry asked, frowning.
"Nothing, just remembering what he said to me.." replied Draco in a whisper.
Harry held out the lime green pygmy puff for Draco to see. He'd seen the adorable little creature and was sure it would cheer Draco up, even if just a little.
"Look. I know I need to make a choice and I know I've said this a thousand times but.. I'm thinking about it. Seriously."
"Harry."
He could hear the whispers but he was too cold to care. Hermione was yelling at him for not coming back when he freed his own hostage but he didn't pay her any heed. All he cared was that Draco and the others were safe.
"H-Harry?"
"Don't look so miserable, I'm just here to drop off your boyrfriend." she said and waved towards Draco who held his Invisibility cloak.
"I know.. When do you ever think, Potter?"
"Don't be ridiculous."
Draco frowned.
"I don't think that's a good idea."
"How?"
"Oi Potty, wake up. I think someone's here!" came Draco's voice from the bed.
"What?"
"Hm.. Want to go to the Hog's Head, again?"
"What?"
"I haven't talked to her since she helped Umbridge find your DA group."
"No way I'm sleeping in that cold humid place under the lake." Harry replied without thinking.
"Can we talk somewhere else?" he said when he heard rustling from inside the Great Hall.
"Hi.."
"What is your sudden obsession with chocolate?" Harry asked, sharply.
"Seriously, Draco.. Helena can die, later. I want to fly with you!"
"I heard someone got c-cursed and I.. I.. I thought.." Draco buried his face into Harry's neck. Harry hugged him back.
"You know the last time you told me to meet you at midnight, you ditched me and landed me in detention."
Harry smiled, sheepishly.
Draco thought that moment was good to take off the cloak. Neville shrieked.
Harry sighed. He really didn't know what to do about this whole situation with Draco. He couldn't just forget about Lucius Malfoy being a death eater but he also couldn't stop his feelings for Draco. That boy was going to be the death of him.
He felt several hairs part company with his scalp.
"Why, Potter, where exactly were your eyes?"
"Well, I dunno.. I just thought it'd be a good prank if I kissed him, it'd shut him up.. I just didn't think I'd like it so much.. And well.. There was a lot of avoiding then some kissing and running away.. A lot of drama, honestly.. And some fights but here we are, finally boyfriends." Harry finished with a blush on his face.
"If you're done gawking at the cake, come on.. Let's cut it." said Harry, bursting Draco out of his thoughts.
Draco flinched at the name.
Then he leaned in and whispered low enough so only Harry could hear him, "Detention, Mr. Potter, with only you and me in an old abandoned classroom."
He stood up.
"What's going on in here?" came a waspish voice.
"Harry?" came Hermione's voice from the stairs and Harry's eyes snapped to her.
Harry could never say no to his pleading eyes.
"I'm a wizard, Potter. And in case you hadn't noticed, I would be on top of class if it wasn't for your.. friend, Granger."
"What was the memory?"
Yes, first kiss. That kiss by the tree barely counts as Harry was the only one doing the kissing.
He looked him in the eye and gathering all his Gryffindor courage, asked Malfoy.
"Why does he have your invisibility cloak?" Ron asked.
Eyes widening, Draco opened the letter.
"What the-"
"I guess people are just bored to be spreading such ridiculous rumours, then." she mumbled.
"Well.. I was about to go take a long bath in the Prefect's bathroom. It's usually empty till 7."
Harry looked at Draco, curiously. Did it bother him that Harry's friends didn't know of their.. situation? But what would he even tell them? What were they? Were the boyfriends? Friends with benefits? What?
"I.. I accidentally stabbed myself with my quill." he said, concealing his hand.
There was a short pause.
"You heard me. We're done." Theo said and stormed out, ignoring Draco at the door.
"You're going to be missing mounds of homework and most importantly, dinner.. And you're worried about Keeper tryouts, Potter?"
"Oh, you want to laugh so bad? Let me give you a reason to laugh!" Harry said and started tickling him.
Draco was so lost in his thoughts, he hadn't realised Hermione's curious eyes on him.
Harry woke up to immense back pain. As he gained consciousness, he realised this was because he was sleeping on the floor. And there was something- no, someone- sprawled over him.
"Who's bloody Helena?"
"No, no.. It's er.. Draco Malfoy, he's in trouble! I need to help him! I need Dumbledore!"
"Shut up."
"I know, Harry. He knows, too. He said he trusts Dumbledore and if you do too then you should trust Snape as well."
Harry nodded.
"Harry, just because you don't hate me, it doesn't mean the entire Gryffindor house is suddenly in love with me. They hate me."
"What else?" Draco asked.
"Tell me!"
Draco put his head on Harry's chest and let the tears fall.
"Dunno. He's been like that since he got probation. And he won't tell us where he got those injuries from."
"Evening, children. Did you rest well, Draco?" Molly asked while setting the table with her children, Fleur and Hermione.
"Was visiting Hagrid." he replied, looking at the fire.
“How d’you — ?”
Soon, they were all dueling until only them, Pansy and Draco were left.
Harry coughed to gain his attention.
He was walking to the Hospital Wing to see his friends, lost in his thoughts, the following words echoing in his head:
"I went to the Weasley house only to find out you're staying at Hogwarts.."
Draco rolled his eyes.
"Why can't you just leave my friends, alone, Draco?" said Harry in a tired voice and dropped down on the armchair.
"Not hungry."
His eyes widen. He hadn't meant to mention the bit about his father. Who knew how Harry would take it. His body tensed. But, Harry didn't say or do anything about it.
"You didn't finish your homework?"
"I'm barely in my dorm, am I? I don't even sleep there, Harry.. Although.."
"I- what?"
"You don't look so bad, yourself." Draco mumbled.
"Are you alright?" Harry asked edging closer to Draco and putting his hand over his.
Draco swallowed. Harry didn't budge, he looked at Draco, worriedly. He squeezed Draco's hand.
"Potter, of course, it's you and-"
"Then, what..?"
Draco relaxed and listened to Harry's experience of his trial.
Harry nodded.
"Stop ignoring me! Honestly, what has gotten into you? What are you even reading?" Pansy asked, trying to peek at the book cover but Draco blushed and hid it.
Draco's brained had stopped working. His eyes could only focus on Harry's lips, his unruly hair, his rugged muscles, his green, green eyes and his-
"Er.. I'll be late for Quidditch practice."
"I think you should.. I mean you need to choose.. I keep telling you everything and.." Harry paused to laugh humourlessly. "Well, that's not very smart of me if you're planning to stand with your parents."
"I know.." Harry said and sighed. "But he seemed to be getting irritated by my untrustworthiness of Snape so I didn't press on the matter. I just don't understand.. He's always so mysterious. He still hasn't told me what happened to his hand.. And now he bloody expects me to get a sodding memory from Slughorn."
"But, I have the cloak and the map-"
Blaise huffed.
"What's up with him?" he heard Ron ask Hermione as he rushed out of the Great Hall, not noticing the silver eyes following his movement.
"Some friend you are." said Hermione, rolling her eyes.
"Er, yes.."
Snape's eyes widened and Harry gulped.
But Draco wasn't listening. His eyes had widened and he was staring at Harry with a horrified expression.
Harry covered both of them with his Invisibility cloak and let himself be dragged by Draco.
He was running. Umbridge had found out about the DA meeting. Dobby had just told them. And now he was running.
But, just then, Malfoy's lips part a little and Harry leaves no time in sliding his tongue inside Malfoy's mouth. Malfoy jumps. He actually jumps from the surprise of Harry's tongue suddenly inside him, breaking the kiss.
"Sorry for interrupting boys but now we're really late, Draco. We should've been in the prefects' carriage as soon as we got on the train!" she said, impatiently glancing out the compartment.
"But Saturday is-"
"I.. um.. I can't."
"If.. If I don't write back for some reason, go to Grimmauld place in the London Borough of Islington. Stand between the 11th and 13th house and think 12 Grimmauld place until you see it."
Draco hugged him and buried his face in his neck, squeezing him hard as if he would disappear. He really had a bad feeling about this. He wished he could stop Harry from going but Harry wasn't taking him seriously.
Draco put his lips on Harry's before he could interrogate further.
"But-"
He had come to the library to meet Hermione. She wanted to discuss his progress on the egg. She was surprisingly not here yet and Harry was about to sit down when he saw a flash of platinum blonde hair. Malfoy.
Voldemort had escaped again but at least everyone saw him. And Sirius, he was dead..
Harry looked at him and smiled.
Draco frowned.
"Oh."
"Don't make me change my mind, Potty."
"How was I to know what's in it?!" Harry replied.
"Harry.. You shouldn't have seen his memory in the first place."
Fred and George, however, were enraged. They had sprinted at Malfoy and well eventually that had led to both twins and Harry - even though he didn't do anything, bloody Umbridge - being banned from Quidditch and their broomsticks being locked away.
"Potter, don't think too hard, you might faint again."
"So.. why am I here?"
"It will be alright, Blaise." Draco said, putting his arm around him.
When he was ready, he cast a tempus charm.
"Maybe we should both be under the cloak."
"I'll write that to him. Preferably, he'll be able to get out, tomorrow. I don't want him stuck there, even one more day." Harry said and Dumbledore nodded.
Interesting. Draco raised an eyebrow.
"Well..? Don't you want to help your friends?"
"It could be your idiotic Gryffindor courage rubbing off on me but I feel slightly reckless, Harry." Draco said and Harry raised his eyebrows. Draco took Harry's hand and dragged both of them inside.
"Where are you going?" asked Draco in a whiny voice.
"I'm sorry but who's side are you on?"
Harry did not say anything to this; it was quite true, but he felt heartless saying it.
"I won't let anyone hurt you." he promised.
"How much of that did you hear?" he asked in a low voice.
"What?"
"I'm just worried for you, Draco." she said, softly.
"How could you?!"
"What was that about?" Draco whispered after their strange encounter with Hagrid.
Harry smiled.
"Harry?" Draco whispered, afraid of how the boy might react upon seeing him.
"I.. I suppose you're right."
They were sitting in a separate compartment than both of their friends.
"They could've sent him to spy on you! This could've been their plan, all along!" Ron bellowed.
"Are you going to be okay going back home?" Harry asked Draco.
Harry's heart was pounding loudly. His hands were sweating, he couldn't breathe. Draco, Draco.. His Draco, a Death Eater.. No! No, he wouldn't let that happen. Help.. Draco asked for help.. He needed to get it together.. Dumbledore.. He needed Dumbledore.
Harry stared at Malfoy. Did he just agree to fo to the ball with him? Oh Merlin, he was going to faint.
Harry frowned. What exactly was going on here?
Harry dropped his books. Draco Malfoy had just come up to him and said hi. He was definitely dreaming.
“I don’t —” Harry began. He swallowed. “In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room — that’s this one — and then I went through another door into a room that kind of . . . glitters. We should try a few doors,” he said hastily. “I’ll know the right way when I see it. C’mon.”
“It’s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,” said Malfoy. “Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.”
Draco.
"To say I'm confused is an understatement." Ginny said.
Harry's eyes snapped open and he snatched his hand back from Draco's.
"Pansy. She's suspicious. I couldn't even deny it.. And now I have to make up something to tell her."
“...and it’s supposed to smell differently to each of us, according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and —”
"I don't think I'll be going to Hogsmeade anytime soon, Harry.. I just.. I'm scared.. I did run away from home, you know?"
Hermione went to Ron's bed to help him.
Draco sighed dramatically.
"I.. He.. Draco.. Voldemort.." Harry panted.
Harry kissed his neck, trailing kisses over his jaw, his mouth finally coming to rest over Draco's.
And he led them forward, between the towering rows of glass balls, some of which glowed softly as they passed. . . .  “He should be near here,” whispered Harry, convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view upon the darkened floor. “Anywhere here . . . really close . . .”
"Sod off, Potter."
Harry sighed and opened the doors to the Room of Requirement.
Sighing, Draco took off the invisibility cloak and gave it to Harry.
Blaise got startled by Draco's loud interruption.
"Why are you not sleeping, Dobby?" Harry asked and sat down, gesturing Draco to sit who was still looking at Dobby, weirdly.
"And you told him?"
“D- Er.. Malfoy?,” replied Harry at once, without thinking about it. He had almost said Draco's first name!
Hermione blushed and let out a gasp.
"So.. I do have my suspicions but I'd like to hear it from you." Pansy whispered from his other side.
"Good evening." Harry said, sitting next to Ron on the Gryffindor table.
To say Draco was surprised was an understatement. The kitchen was decorated with fairy lights and the house elves had set a candle-lit table for Harry and Draco. Atop the table, sat a marvellous cake shaped like a golden snitch. Draco's heart warmed. Harry set this up for him. It was the best thing anyone had ever done for his birthday.
"I think it's probably the memory but alright, we really should sleep. Hey, why don't you come to the DA meeting tomorrow?"
Draco glared at him and Harry flushed.
"I may be your boyfriend, Scarhead, but that doesn't mean I'm going to let you win at Quidditch." he said and soared away, leaving Harry baffled.
"Er.. I can't dance.."
He closed his eyes.
"May I have this dance?" he asked, shyly.
"Why do you have to assume I'll choose them?"
"Why are you giving me a Galleon, Harry?" asked Draco.
"You helped her!" said Draco, pointing his wand at Pansy.
"Potter, this is serious. I will steal that book of yours and hide it so that you may never find it, again!"
"Mr. Filch, what are we supposed to do today?"
"Sorry.. What did Snape say, yesterday?"
"I've been "blindly trusting" him for more than a year! And he fucking left his bloody family! What more of a proof do you need he's on our side?!" Harry snapped.
"Molly, why's there shouting?" Arthur asked, his wand ready as if they'd been attacked.
"Be there or not, Potter. No one's forcing you." he said and walked away.
"Poisoned? But who would-"
Harry sat down and opened his books.
"I say you won't last 10 minutes in this tournament."
"You stupid bint!"
"Did you put something on it?" he asked, curiously.
"I've been thinking about it and well.. I suppose the world must know one day.. And we don't have to tell them we're dating, we could just let everyone know we're friends and not enemies anymore.."
"Very eloquent, Potter."
“On the count of three then,” said Snape lazily. “One — two —” Snape’s office door banged open and Pansy Parkinson sped in.
"Mhm.. And what happened to keeping this a secret?"
"You're so stupid!" he chuckled and kissed Draco back.
"Let it go, Ron." Hermione said, sharply.
Draco looked towards the floor, nodding.
"I think we ought to follow Professor Umbridge, guys.. I have a feeling Potter and Granger made that story up." Pansy said.
Draco cringed.
Harry gave a small sheepish smile.
As soon as Harry was gone, Severus opened his mouth.
He glanced at Draco who had paled.
“It’s him!” Umbridge said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor. “Excellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good - fifty points to Slytherin! I’ll take him from here... Stand up, Potter!”
Draco flushed from hearing Harry use his first name.
"Obviously."
"L-let me.. go, P-Potter! Merlin, the.. the look on her.. f-face when you.. s-said.. boyfriend!" he uttered in between the laughs.
Draco paused and took a deep breath.
"Girl?" Goyle - the idiot - repeated.
"Hm, no.."
"Why not?"
"Good." he replied, immersing back into his book.
Draco nodded.
"Oh, do you take me for an idiot, Draco? It's obvious you have a secret girlfriend. You've been acting weird for months, you're always distracted and you keep messing up in Potions. I knew it had to be because of a girl but Pansy kept refusing to believe that.. Probably because she wants you for herself but anyway.. I know it's-"
Draco sighed.
"I don't have more but I could charm some."
Neville was oddly looking at Harry, now.
"Do you really think a silly tournament has any chance over the Boy who Lived? Even Voldemort couldn't kill me." he joked but deep down he was just as scared as Draco.
"N-nothing."
Harry smiled and locked their lips together.
Draco nodded.
"Why?" said Draco, astounded.
"Mother took me to Madam Malkins, first.. I convinced her to get Potions ingredients while I get my books to save time." he replied, glancing around, nervously.
"For someone who doesn't want anyone to know of our.. us, you're being very loud."
Draco let out a breath he hadn't known he had been holding.
"Okay."
"Get to your dormitories, both of you." he finally said.
"None of your business."
"I.. Er.. I.."
He unintentionally glanced at Harry who was already staring at him. Pansy smirked.
Harry just noticed he wasn't wearing the school uniform. No, he was wearing royal blue robes that contrasted beautifully with his pale skin. At this angle, the sunlight shone on his white-blond hair and he looked like an angel.
"Of course. Do you want to try, now?" he asked.
A sob escaped his throat. And another. And then, another. Soon, he was crying his heart out on Draco's shoulder.
“Harry, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” screamed Angelina, soaring past him to keep up with Katie. “GET GOING!”
He grabbed Harry and kissed him passionately to describe how grateful he was for his gift and him being there.
Harry gave him a quick peck on the lips and left.
There was a knock on the door and Harry reluctantly pulled his hand away.
Draco just nodded in reply.
"Are you living with him?"
"And then Ron and I decided we should go to bed since only Hermione would know the properties of moonstone." Harry said and chuckled, while playing with Draco's hair.
“So, Harry,” said Draco, “what did Slughorn want?”
Hermione rolled her eyes.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy!"
"You want to know who I've been seeing, don't you?" he said, shoving Blaise away. "You want to know why I yelled at Pansy?"
He buried his face in Draco's neck.
"I'll help you do it. I'd do it for you but you already don't pay attention in classes and you need to learn. It's OWL year, for Merlin's sake."
Ron shifted, uncomfortably.
Harry grinned.
Harry sighed. He'd been thinking of Draco, too. When his sleep wasn't engulfed with nightmares of Voldemort, it was filled with dreams of Draco and their.. desk-bed. He smiled at the memory. But then he got flashbacks of Lucius Malfoy,  face concealed with the Death Eater mask, at the graveyard.
"Close that mouth, Potter, you're going to catch flies with it. Oh honestly, I didn't even need to do anything. Your Weasel perfectly sabotaged his own practice."
Harry silently stared at him.
"Are you stupid? Or do you take pleasure in pain?" Draco asked, looking at Harry as if he was an idiot.. which Harry supposed he was.
"Maybe because I'm me?" Draco replied, rolling his eyes.
"Believe me I know. He saw some of my worst memories.. And er.. he might have seen some.. memories of us.. Thank Merlin, he knew about us beforehand.." Harry said.
Harry sputtered.
Harry rolled his eyes and pulled Draco into a passionate kiss.
Harry explained about the book.
"Honestly, what is wrong with you Gryffindors? I saw another one of you exiting Umbridge's office, clutching his hand tightly.. You idiots certainly do take pleasure in pain.." Draco ranted.
He checked his watch.
His eyes fluttered open and Draco fell back onto the floor.
"I want to take you.."
"Shove off."
"I'm off to bed."
Harry pursed his lips.
Dobby set glasses on the table and a pitcher of water.
"Night, Draco." he said and pulled Draco closer.
"Draco, you're going to wake the entire school."
"Wake up, Potter!"
"You don't know anything about my family, do you?" he said.
"Don't you think Slytherins should be well prepared for war, as well, Harry?"
"Yeah, Draco.. I am well aware of that man's pointless, unbeatable, unremarkable hatred for me."
She returned with a glass of water which Harry swallowed in one go.
"If you're done whining, I'd like to start on our homework."
"Draco!" Harry hissed at Draco, abandoning his search for the snitch.
Harry chuckled. It was good to see Draco in his element.
"Harry?"
"That's all?"
"I ran away from home, in case you didn't notice."
He was going to the Burrow on Friday.. He'd have to explain his relationship with Draco to everyone.. He wished he could talk to Draco.
"To the kitchens for lunch." said Draco.
"Well.. He's my boyfriend."
“I don’t know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous,” she said firmly, again inscribing a fiery cross upon the door.
Draco sighed.
Harry rolled his eyes.
"I don't know what to do.. Don't judge me, Arcturus." he said when he saw the owl staring.
"Why not the Slytherin dormitory?"
"Don't be ridiculous, Voldemort wouldn't let anyone else kill me, he would like to personally end me." Harry said.
"Don't lie to me!" he said, enraged.
"Hogsmeade, tomorrow." Draco thought out loud and sighed.
"Thank Merlin, I thought you'd lost it." Ron said.
"I think it was an archway between the living and the dead." Draco spoke for the first time since they'd gotten there.
"You have to answer me. I need to know what this is, what you want. And I think you need to tell yourself, too. So, answer me, Draco. Do you want me? Do you want to be with me? Or do you choose to keep living in fear?"
"I really like you, Harry."
He looked away.
"She's strange." Draco said and Harry laughed.
"You'll have to make the choice, sooner or later, Draco. Better be now. Me or Voldemort?"
"Well, put it on, then, Draco and off you two go." Pansy said and walked away.
"Clean the trophies in the trophy room."
"Come on, Harry, take my arm." said Dumbledore and apparated them to Diagon Alley.
"See you, later?" he said, more like asked Harry.
He quickly put the note in his pocket before Ron could see.
On the way, he suddenly realised Draco must have needed the Gryffindor password to sneak into his dorm. When he asked about it, he received the answer, "Don't ask too many questions, Potter, or I'll change my mind about taking you along." and that shut Harry up.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
"Who's the boy?" she asked, making Draco blush.
"I do, sir." Harry replied instantly and Dumbledore nodded.
He drew his wand and closed his eyes.
Draco smiled.
"The Malfoy boy?" Molly said, frowning.
"You're adorable." he said, resting his face on Harry's chest.
"I think someone gave him the bottle to pass it on to Dumbledore."
"There's owl treats by Hedwig's cage.." he said to the owl as he tore open the seal.
“Another night’s detention, I think,” she said softly.
"He could be lying.. You did say he hated your Godfather.."
"It's not really surprising, you know? I mean I expect the school to be divided on this matter. Who knows, maybe even some teachers don't believe you? That Umbridge woman is bad news. I heard father talking to someone about her."
"Well, we certainly didn't." Draco replied. "No dark arts in there but I'm not sure if you should open it.. You did say that elf hates you."
"Did you write back to your mother?"
"What else would I do, 'Mione, hug him?"
"I suppose.. I just don't know how to."
"Maybe because you are?"
"Harry, I-"
"We're not defying her orders, Pansy." Theo replied and the rest of them nodded.
Draco sighed.
Draco shrugged.
"I don't think they suspect anything. After all, none of them saw me there.. And I don't think anyone recognised my voice amongst all those voices.. Besides, mother wrote to me.. She didn't say anything about me being there so.. I guess I'm safe. I don't think I'll be able to write to you, though."
"Felt a little weird without you there. Mum said to tell you that you were missed." he said. "Oh and.. I told Lupin about er.. Snape and Nott." Ron whispered. "He reckons you should trust Dumbledore which means trusting Snape and er.. he thinks you're blinded by your hatred for Snape which is why you want to believe he's evil. Dad agrees with him."
"You wouldn't understand."
"Detention, Draco. With Snape."
It was his third night at the Burrow when the owl arrived.
Hermione looked at Draco.
"Is this enough of a reason?" he said in a hoarse voice.
“And guess who’s a Slytherin prefect?” said Ron, still with his eyes closed.
"Um.. hi." he said, kneeling to pick his books up. Draco helped him pick them up.
"I'll think about it.."
"I just fainted and you're going to leave just like that? My head still hurts, Draco. It slammed pretty hard on that damned table."
Harry scrunched up his nose and made a face which in Draco's opinion made him look absolutely adorable.
With every sentence, Harry took a step towards Draco until he was right in front of him. He leaned down to face Draco.
"I.. I don't know."
"You can do that?"
They were going to the Ministry of Magic on Thestrals.
"What?"
Draco grabbed him and pulled him into a long deep kiss.
"Our hideout is exposed to Snape."
“Don’t worry about that, Mum’s bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed,” said Ron, rolling his eyes. "At any rate, you have something to tell us." he said, looking serious.
"I wonder if she'd still be happy for me for getting away if she knew I'd joined the opposite side.. I mean she only wanted me safe because she's my mother, not because she doesn't believe in You-Know-Who’s views. She would've even encouraged me to join You-Know-Who if I was of age and he wasn't just making me join him for avenging my father's mistakes.."
"FUCK OFF, BLAISE, IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!" Theo yelled.
He opened it carefully and found a beautiful locket inside. It was a lion with emerald eyes and a silver snake wrapped around it.
"He hates me! And more than me, he hates Sirius! I'm sorry Draco but I really don't trust him. Look, we're almost there."
"Well.. I have a surprise for you. I was supposed to take you to.. it.. when I came here but as you know we got caught up in other things.." Harry said, making Draco blush.
"I don't think anyone minds."
Draco's answering glare shut him up.
Harry stared at it. “D’you reckon this is safe to open?” he asked Draco who was opening a box of Honeydukes chocolates.
"Dobby?" Draco asked, surprised.
Now, Harry was looking forward to the day. With everything that was going on, this could be a pleasant distraction..
"Draco?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled Harry closer. They were laying on another desk-bed attempt of Draco's. Well, it was better than before but it could use some improvement.
"Hope you don't mind staying here while I.. attempt to write a reply."
"Hm." was his reply. Really, Hayden needed to tell Michael he loves him before Draco had a nervous breakdown.
"Or you could tell her the truth."
Hermione had come down the stairs.
Harry's eyes widened. He hadn't meant to say that out loud. Draco was blushing, again.
But Harry was nowhere to be found. Draco decided to transfigure the desk.. He had practiced a lot of transfiguration over the summer, even when he thought Harry hated him.. Just in case. And he was proud of the almost-bed he had transfigured the desk into. He was standing their admiring his creation when Harry's head, just his bloody head, appeared on the bed. Draco screamed and fell back. Harry rolled over in bed laughing, while clutching his stomach.
Harry’s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label reading 'To Master, From Kreacher.'
Just making it clear, everything that happens in the books is still happening in the fic. The only things that change are things that happen in this fic.. And all the articles Rita Skeeter has written, Draco hasn't given any interviews to her.
"You know the stupid toad won't make us do any practical work and you're.. you're good at Defense so I thought.. But you don't have to! If you don't want.." he rambled on..
"I don't give a fuck about her blood status, Potter."
"Well, no one I know has one.. What if someone other than me receives the owl? Even if Harry doesn't sign his name.. No." Draco shook his head and Pansy sighed.
They all shrugged.
Draco smiled and then, rolled his eyes.
"Since the start of the year?"
Harry sighed.
People were staring at them.
"I want to but I.. I can't, Potter."
"I knew someone came in! Oh Merlin.. You saw all of that.. Are you.. Are you laughing? You git! Stop! Bloody! Laughing!" Harry said as he tackled Draco, a smile forming on his own lips.
Ron started coughing violently and spilled the water he was drinking all over himself.
Harry looked shocked.
She was sitting opposite Ron, chatting with Cormac McLaggen, obviously to annoy Ron who surprisingly didn't have Lavender nearby.
"What? But you said yes!"
"You'd do it for me?"
"How did you manage to create a potion better than me?" Draco demanded.
"Why do you want to take me to a "stupid" party?" Draco teased.
He grabs Malfoy again, pushes him against the tree and furiously kisses him to shut him up.
"What, Potty?"
"Er.. Not much, just the end.."
"Potter was expelled.. But of course Dumbledore has to put his nose in every matter. He got the boy a trial and declared himself Potter's witness for defence. His trial is on the 12th."
"Well, I had to take revenge from last night. Honestly, Harry, you're blind even with your glasses.. I'm not even in my uniform.
"I'm not mad at you, baby, I just.. I hate Umbridge."
Granger had made up some ridiculous story about Dumbledore and Umbridge had believed him. They'd gone outside and Draco was still here. And his stupid housemates he'd once considered his friends were holding Harry's friends hostage. He had to do something, anything to help Harry. He looked at Pansy with pleading eyes and she nodded.
"NONE OF MY BUSINESS? I'M YOUR BOYFRIEND!" Blaise yelled back.
"I'm scared.. What if he.. he doesn't reply? Or worse he does reply but he.. he tells me he hates me and wants nothing to do with me? I can't, Pans.."
Draco rolled his eyes and mumbled "Gryffindors." before going back to opening his presents. He'd gotten a box of Honeydukes chocolates from Blaise, a collection of gay wizarding novels from Pansy which he hid from Harry, and he was opening his third present when Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.
"Oh my, he knows my name! Theo!" Blaise said, grabbing Theo's arm. "Theo, I might faint, the great Draco Malfoy just addressed me with my first name!"
Draco smiled.
"Shut it, Draco. Someone might hear you!"
"Harry, please.."
"Why, don't you like seeing me laugh?" he said, wiping a fake tear.
Harry made a disgusted expression.
"Hermione! Draco! He.. He.."
He knew she still suspected him but he'd never admit it to her. Draco was never going to be his so there was no point in telling Ron and Hermione, anything.
"What's wrong?" Harry said, putting his hand on Draco's shoulder.
No! Malfoy wasn't mesmerising, he's a pathetic git!
Right, last night, they'd..
"Still am.", he whispered.
"We're going to die." Draco kept muttering.
Draco hurriedly took the letter from Arcturus, his heart swelling at the fact there was a letter.
"You know I'm here for you, right? All you have to do is say it once and I'll steal you away from the Manor."
His eyes fluttered open upon hearing Draco say his last name.
"One would say this entire set up was a great birthday present but of course not for the great Draco Malfoy."
“Where’s Sirius?” Harry said.
"Why do you have to such an unreasonable, ridiculously infuriating Gryffindor?!"
"I can think of a lot of things.."
This kiss was different. It was slow, soft and gentle, and gave Harry butterflies in his stomach.
Harry then explained what he knew about the room to Draco who was incredibly impressed.
What was wrong with him?
“It’s got my name on,” said Harry.
Draco, who was looking flawless in those fancy dress robes.. Draco, who was standing with Pansy Parkinson. He knew Draco was gay, yet, he felt a pang of jealousy as he saw Pansy's arm in Draco's. He gripped his glass so hard it broke.
Draco's eyes widened as he looked at Harry.
"Yeah, I do." he replied and opened the door of the closet to leave.
"You do have a fever, Draco. Kreacher, bring us lunch, here, and some soup for Draco." Kreacher's lip curled but he gave a small nod and disapparated.
"N-no, it's fine."
"You're an idiot, Potty." he said when he'd finally recovered from his laughing.
He hugged Pansy and rushed out of the Slytherin common room to see the Boy Who Lived.
"Depends on how much you trust her."
As he emerged from the water with Fleur's little sister and Draco who was blushing furiously, the cheering audience went completely silent as they saw who he had brought.
"Do you regret it?"
"Where's Potty and Weasel, Granger?" Draco asked, not being able to resist.
But, Harry was beaming at him.
Draco fidgeted with his fingers.
“Thanks,” said Harry, awkwardly.
"What-"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't have a fever, Potty and act like a wizard."
Harry sighed and walked up to his bed.
"I just have a bad feeling about this.."
"Well, Sirius wasn't a slimy prejudiced git! And Malfoy's a Slytherin!"
"Sorry for being late, Blaise and Pansy were fighting and well.." Draco mumbled.
Draco looked away.
Harry chuckled.
"Potter, where the hell were you?" Draco, said yawning.
"That's what it looks like, yes. I suppose you were right about not going to Hogsmeade.."
"Mione?"
Harry nodded.
"I won't, sorry."
"Okay, okay." Harry yawned. "Bossy."
"Potter, you blind git." he said, trying to untangle himself from the invisibility cloak he'd been under.
"I just.. I'm scared."
"..as friends if we both couldn't find a date. But, looks like she'll have to find a date or go alone, now."
"Not really.. Crabbe and Goyle were just.. Well, they were more like minions than friends. I was close to Theo, though, but he's been distant this year and.. Since, he and Blaise broke up, he doesn't talk to anyone other than Crabbe and Goyle."
"Well then, let's make the most out of our last afternoon alone here before they all come back, shall we?" Harry said, climbing on the bed, settling himself on top of Draco.
Harry thanked Merlin that she was distracted with Ron and not able to further interrogate him. He didn't think he would be able to keep up the lies, anymore.
"I'm serious, baby. Just say it once. That you're on my side. And I'll never let you go."
"Welcome to the Room of Requirement, Draco."
"OUT!"
"You can rest in Hedwig's cage.. She's out hunting." he said to the owl.
He'd brought them all here and now Voldemort was probably coming.
"What if someone's there? What if someone sees me at the platform and-"
"Hmm.. What if I try to transfigure that desk into a bed? Or at least something that resembles a bed.. And we should put a disillusionment charm on ourselves and lock the door-"
That explains it. The coconut smell was Draco's shampoo! He glanced at Draco who seemed to already be looking his way. Harry gave him a small smile which he returned.
"Oh, that makes sense." said Hermione just before the wall spun, again.
"Mhm. Yours?"
"Why don't you write to him?"
"Come along, don't let the wrackspurts get to you!" she said and left to run after Ginevra Weasley.
June 5th, 1995.
“To me, Potter,” repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up.
"Told you he trusts Snape. But it is quite stupid of him to disregard the matter like this.. You-know-who has a supporter - maybe, two - inside Hogwarts! He should at least be a little concerned."
"Have you forgotten who your father is, who he supports? Are you aware what this could lead to?"
Harry's face fell. Of course. Malfoy was straight. It had been stupid to kiss him and even more stupid to ask him to go to the Yule Ball. Merlin, this was so embarrassing, he should-
"Come on, we've got presents."
She opened the book to a random page and shrieked.
"Were you a fan of me, Draco?" he teased.
"Er.. nothing.." Hermione replied.
"No." Harry replied.
"Mhm."
Harry looked out and indeed, it was snowing.
"Er.. I have to um.. go to er remedial Potions."
"Quidditch."
Blaise shook himself.
Harry sighed.
"It's hardly my fault I hate him." Harry snapped.
"Don't get so wound up over this!"
Harry was opening his Christmas presents and found an unnamed box wrapped in red paper and gold ribbon - Gryffindor colours. He wondered who that could be from. He cautiously opened it - the Hermione-like voice in his brain telling him it could be a dark artifact or a cursed object, but he was ignoring that voice - and found a royal blue scarf inside. Well, clothes could hardly be harmful, right? Unless it was designed to strangle him.. He touched it and it was incredibly soft. A piece of paper fell to the floor. Harry picked it up.
"Yes, sir."
"YOU CAN'T LET HER DO THIS!"
"Oh, I'm Malfoy, now?"
"I.."
"Are you for real? You've called me it twice and you didn't even realise?"
"Gladly." he replied and brought their lips together.
"You were thinking..?"
“Always,” echoed Malfoy softly. “Now, give me the prophecy, Potter.”
“ ’Course,” said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of his chocolate frog into his mouth and taking another.
Harry glared daggers at him.
"Kind of hard not to notice the Boy Who Lived."
"Please, I just had this conversation with Ron. I am not going to McGonagall or Dumbledore! I can't let her get the satisfaction that she got to me!" Harry yelled.
"I'm starting to regret telling you."
"Harry.. You went to Hogsmeade for the chocolate. How did you forget?!"
"Hey, it's okay, baby. It wasn't me." he said, trying to comfort Draco.
"Kreacher!" he yelled and Kreacher appeared, sneering at Harry.
He was going to be a little late to Quidditch practice, after missing the tryouts! Nevermind that he'd also miss lunch.
Harry chuckled.
"You're writing your Potions essay."
"Good night, Harry."
"What's wrong?" Hermione asked, her eyes filled with worry.
"I was just.. What are we, Draco?"
"No, he's not. He needs- Dobby?" Draco said, gobsmacked.
"What?"
Harry snorted.
Draco rolled his eyes and leaned in. Harry quickly glanced to the crowd, but no one was paying him any heed. Draco's lips were above Harry's, he could feel his breath on his lips.
"It wasn't exactly a memory.. I was just.." Draco took a deep breath. "I thought of you." he whispered.
"Hm.. Maybe he's right? Considering what his son did.." Draco said, looking away.
"Draco, no-"
"I know you're hopelessly in love with Potter but that doesn't mean you should avoid all your friends and spend all your free time with him!"
Harry finally escaped them at half past 12. He was late to meet Draco! He had already missed meeting him yesterday due to Sirius.. He couldn't not go today, as well! He rushed to his dormitory, grabbed his cloak and tried his best to exit the common room without raising Ron and Hermione's suspicions.
"Don't wanna get up." Harry whined.
"Oh Merlin.. Don't tell me you believe Skeeter's stupid articles about her."
"Uh- Yeah.. Er.. coming."
Before Harry could say anything else, Hermione changed the topic.
"You won't do it, again?"
"Don't you dare, Potter. Do you want me to leave you bleeding and wounded just because it's going to scar? Idiot Gryffindor." he replied.
Harry looked away.
"He's Draco. Harry's boyfriend. That's all you need to remember. Come on, Ron, don't you see how happy he makes Harry? Even when Harry is gloomy or angry, one look at Draco and his face softens. Be a good friend and be happy for him, please. He needs your support, Ron, not your accusations at the person he deeply cares for."
When they reached Hogwarts, they went to their own dormitories, none of them realising the Gryffindor scarf was still wrapped around Draco's neck along with his own scarf. Thankfully, the halls were deserted as most people were still out in Hogsmeade. The common room was also empty apart from Pansy who was smirking at him for some reason and a few first and second years who paid him no heed. However, as he reached his dorm, Blaise's eyes widened, Crabbe dropped the books he was holding, Goyle started choking on his water and Theo was staring at.. Oh shit. His scarf! Harry's scarf! He'd forgotten to give it back! Now he was the one who was wide-eyed.
Realising Pansy wasn't talking and had possibly asked him a question, Draco nodded.
"Arcturus! Finally.."
Draco rolled his eyes.
"Er.. anyway.. "Harry Potter Sir" is starving. Is there any food left?" Draco said, looking around.
