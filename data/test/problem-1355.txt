Minerva’s face softened at Harry’s question as she neared the small group, although her posture retained a stiffness born of the intense stress of the last few hours. “No, no. I don’t suspect any of our students had anything to do with this. I just would like to understand the series of events through their eyes. How are you feeling, dear?” eyeing Harry closely as she stood at the end of his bed, hands grasping the white footboard as she watched the younger man closely.
“I agree with Professor Snape. You have done very well today, Ms. Bishop,” Minerva added in a warm, motherly tone. “You are free to head back to your common room now,” nodding towards the door at the back of the room.Novalee didn’t make a move though, frozen where she was on Harry’s lap as she looked at the other occupants of the room. “Go on,” Harry urged with a gentle touch to the girl’s shoulder. “You’ve had an eventful day. Go get some rest.”
“Harry!” the woman cried, spinning to look at him with wide eyes, wand still raised, although she quickly dropped her arm after the initial shock wore off.
Harry felt a slight tug in his chest as reality sunk in that as of now, they actually were not, in fact, sharing that flat together. Instead, Draco was living in the flat and Harry was living here for the foreseeable future. They still agreed to visit each other as often as possible, but they knew both would be busy -- Harry with his classes and Draco with his job at St. Mungo’s and upcoming Healer’s licensing exam. Still, Harry felt empty at the thought of going to bed alone more nights than not after becoming so used to the other man’s warmth next to him.
"Mm. Yes, I suppose you could say that. We weren't a warm family or anything, but we were close. My mother in particular made it her business to keep track of every little thing going on in my life. She's still that way, actually."
Harry shared a grimace with Ginny who graciously stopped flirting with Oliver Wood for a second when she heard that. He decided to use Alicia's introduction as a distraction from all the awkwardness.
Though the original difficulty had been in getting Patricia to agree to see them, it turned out that collecting DNA from her would be all the harder after she agreed to meet them in her office for fifteen minutes.
Neville laughed, nudging Luna and Dean until they looked at whatever was so funny. Harry's face heated, but he pretended it wasn't happening.
"Harry," Malfoy said slowly as if sounding it out. His posh accent made it sound like another name entirely, so different from when he'd said it with a sneer.
Loving Harry was easy though, it was the easiest choice he had ever made, and he wanted to preserve that love for forever. The outcome of the hearing didn’t worry him anymore, it didn’t leave him anxious as it did Harry.
“You’re beautiful,” Harry mumbled as his fingers trailed along Malfoy’s chest, leaving visible goosebumps behind on raised scars. “Way too fit for your own good.”
Before they had come, he had been curious, interested even. Wanted to see what a Wizard tournament was like, only to be disappointed. Could Wizards do
“You have to realize how much power you have Potter.” Draco reached out a hand to run it along the closest section of Potter’s magic. The rush went straight to his head, and he was beginning to think the Dementors weren’t the only ones who needed a fix to keep going.
“Me either,” Lupin murmured, barely above a hoarse whisper. “I wish I could rewind the time, do it all over again and make better choices.”
Potter looked worried, but he did as Draco asked. Each vault was the same. More money than it should’ve had, a circle surrounding where the stone had once resided, and a trace of magic that disgusted him.
hadn’t closed the dressing robe. “There weren’t any wards, I just turned the knob and the door opened. Which is pretty stupid of you if you ask me.”
Harry was inclined to believe Draco. Draco knew how seriously he took injuries of any kind. After everything they have been through, safety was important to him. Especially since it involved Draco.
He shook his head, eyes focusing. Painting-Malfoy had a calculating look in his eyes, but he didn’t have the foggiest idea what that meant, nor did he have the patience to figure it out.
Neville puffed out his chest. “I am to bring along Witch’s Ganglion and Peppermint plants for aesthetics.”
His stomach jolted at the easy acceptance. No one knew they were mated, no one. Hearing it said out loud was surreal and he wanted to hear it over and over again.
know that?” Draco asked, eyes on the ceiling. “Because the last time I checked, mothers actually cared for their children.”
Severus nodded, hair falling into his face. “Black was desperate to prove that he wasn’t like his family, that he wasn’t the Dark Wizard that they were. I met him on the train and even then he didn’t want to be in Slytherin. When I said that I did, I knew he’d never like me.”
Harry closed his eyes. It would do no good to argue, the Dementors already knew what he’d say. He knew that normal Magic didn’t affect the Dementors like it would a human, but that didn’t mean he wanted to see them at the end of a wand.
“I don’t know who is gossiping with you,” Draco narrowed his eyes at Cedric. “But they are feeding you false information. Potter is just a… client.”
It was a testament to how serious Ron was that he let the insult pass without saying anything, and it made Draco nervous.
“Fuck.” Draco’s hips were still moving even as he came, cock buried deep. He didn’t want it to stop, wanted to feel just like that all the time.
“Whoever gave Mister Malfoy the painting didn’t care about the stability of the piece,” Shrew said with a frown on his face. “The frame is cheap, barely holding it together, the gold is fake and any charms to protect the structure are missing.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. What was Potter’s problem? There was no anger on his face, but he couldn’t figure him out.
The gasps that followed would reach his father; of that he had no doubt. It was hard to explain to anyone else, so he didn’t bother. Draco took in their snorts, their eye rolls and them thinking he was taking the mickey.  That was okay.
“It’s sick,” Hermione argued. “Wizards forced them into submission, conditioned them into thinking it was what was best for them, and they are so far gone that they
If Draco was awake, it would have been his hands that roamed Harry’s body; it would have been his fingers that plucked Harry's nipples and toyed with his mouth. If Draco was awake, there would have been lips leaving open-mouthed kisses to Harry's jaw before trailing down his neck, nipping at each juncture before sucking a harsh mark.
“I didn’t know I was a wizard until I was 11.” The wide-eyed look he got in return had his lips twitching. “Everything in my life changed after that. Then it changed again when I was told about my parents and Voldemort. Changed again when I was suddenly seen as some kind of celebrity. I went from a kid hoping to one day get out of a bloody cupboard to being revered by strangers.”
“I needed a life away from here,” Narcissa whispered, hands moving as if to reach for Draco but thought better of it. “Away from duty and contracts.”
“Full offence,” Dean laughed a touch wet, “but where were you when I was hunted and on the run? Where were you when I was in your bloody cellar? Where were you when every other Muggleborn like me were so hated that they, in turn, hated themselves for just being who they are? Where were you when people were harmed at the hands of your father?”
“I don’t buy it. I have never mattered to the Order, for the cause or for any of it and that was made clear the moment I got locked up.”
A small laugh had Draco shaking his head. He wasn’t sure why Potter found him funny when everyone else would have taken offence. Where was the correlation and why did he care?
“And if I’m not?” Harry continued to walk until Malfoy was the one cornered against a file cabinet. “Good, that is?”
Potter’s hand was clenched in the back of his robes, and he wished he could tell him to get a grip. Draco understood emotions—barely—but they clouded judgment and made stressful situations that much harder. He needed Potter at his best.
Draco cradled his wrist to his chest, eyes wide as he looked down at what only the two of them could see. A combination of their magic swirling around each other, entwined so thoroughly that it was impossible to figure out who was who.
Harry looked around the still messy flat with a bit of sorrow. He’d miss coming around, but he’d miss Painting-Malfoy more. Although, the prospect of being able to talk to Malfoy in person was even better.
“The Animatio Court was founded because we were all forsaken,” Draco began, and he hated that word, hated that all he could remember was pain at the hands of Lorian. “Wizard society shunned who we are, they deemed us unfit and beneath them. That was long before time began to be tracked. They have not changed their stance; they still consider us beneath them, and our rights are denied.
“Self-deprecation is kind of my thing.” It was a weak attempt at a joke, but it was the truth, and Harry had always known that.
“Oi! Quit hogging it all, I’m hungry,” Ron complained, the tone whiny and he wasn’t sure how Blaise put up with it.
Harry wasn’t sure what woke him up at first. That seemed to happen a lot most days since he became pregnant. There was no telling if he would get little to no sleep or sleep the day away—never in between. The thought of moving to check the time made his lip curl in distaste but before he could decide, a soft whisper had him staying still.
“She petitions the Ministry once a year for the Crumpled-Horned Snorkack to be added to the endangered species registry, and they deny it every year.
When Ginny sighed a third time, it was accompanied with fingers in his hair, which was an improvement.
Draco jerked a little, and it knocked Harry’s hand off his shoulder. “That would have sparked a rebellion.”
“Then don’t,” Ron said with a laugh. “But that doesn’t mean you can’t borrow my courage. And when you don’t need it, you can give it back.”
“You are the expert in Divination,” quipped Draco as his eyes roamed over Potter’s naked body. “Why don’t you tell me?”
, not when no one did these days, not when the legend of the man was whispered far more than sightings.
As Draco held Harry and murmured false reassurances he wondered again if all of it was worth it. There wasn’t much good in him, or if there had ever been any to begin with. But Harry had so much good that it intimidated him.
She wasn’t wrong but wasn’t that just what made people human? Learning from mistakes and moving on? It was clear that these two had no concept of that. His ego was just fine, perhaps a little too fine if Harry’s opinion mattered on the subject.
“With all due respect,” Leandra interrupted and a few people in the crowd oohed. “If given the chance to mate with who we want regardless of delegation, it would still give the body what it wants.”
“I was a fifth year by the time he came to Hogwarts. I only spent three years observing his youth, so I can’t offer much as I wasn’t around for his adulthood.”
There was a slight pink flush staining Draco’s cheeks and that, combined with the statement, had Ron’s brows pinching and confused frown to form.
“Absolutely.” There was a wicked glint to his eyes, a secret that Harry wasn’t privy too and he was tempted to ask but a gust of wind brought snow blowing onto them.
“I’ve never been selfish before,” Potter whispered as he rubbed his nose against Draco’s. “I thought it would come with more guilt than it does.”
When Potter let go of his wrist, Draco missed the warmth immediately. “It took me a long time to find my own self-worth. Sometimes it’s a daily struggle.”
“Move it,” he elbowed someone in the ribs when they purposefully stood in his way. “I’m not here to take your prime ogling spot, you weirdo.”
Draco chose to hide his face in Ron’s robes instead of responding. If everyone had courage, then did that mean the Sorting Hat was useless? He supposed everyone could embody other House traits if they
There was a dusting of pink that spread along Malfoy’s cheeks as he looked at the desk instead of at Harry, and it was just as pretty as before, only now it was in person.
“You are lucky Nott applied the spell himself or I would have you brought up on charges. If he dies, that’s on
Loving Draco had never been easy, never been what he thought it would, but it was exactly as it should have been, and he wouldn’t change a single thing about it.
“Yeah, but I think he meant duelling. I’ve recently started volunteering at the Youth Duelling Association on my days off. Teaching kids how to protect themselves will help in the long run.”
Harry had left the Headmistress to think about his proposal and the idea had grown from there until she called Harry back to the castle the week before his birthday and very abruptly asked him if he would be interested in accepting a teaching position as the Board of Governors had been impressed with the idea of a companion theory course and whole-heartedly sponsored the course addition for the upcoming term. Harry had accepted the position the next day and since then, it had been a whirlwind attempting to get prepared for his first year of teaching within just one month.
Snape didn’t respond to Harry and instead announced to the students milling about that they were free to leave and thus began the mass exodus of Hogwarts students, Harry and Snape following behind. The pair walked slowly down to the village, Snape displaying a practice vigilance as he scanned the students ahead of them. “How are the students fairing in Defense?” Harry asked, breaking the silence after some time. He hadn’t had a chance to sit in on Snape’s classes yet since they overlapped with his own course time, but he was curious how the students were doing.
Harry stood up from his seat and gave a small wave to the rest of the room before him as he felt his cheeks flush deeply at the attention. Over the years, he had gotten more comfortable in his own skin and somewhat used to the attention -- years of Ministry functions helped with that -- but he still didn’t particularly enjoy the attention at times like this. At least in terms of attention due to his name and unwanted celebrity status. The star-struck business could be frustrating at the best of times and feel downright suffocating at the worst of times. Today, standing in front of the Great Hall, was about right in the middle.
“Anyways, McGonagall heard I was back. She owled me last night and asked if I would be interested in helping out this year as an Assistant Professor -- getting my feet wet and all that since Professor Sprout is looking to retire next year and well, here I am,” Neville finished as he dished himself up some roast as well and dug in.
Ron grunted and held onto his arm tighter. “How much did you drink, mate?” He asked. He looked worried, but there was no need to worry. He ought to see that. Harry stumbled down the street, his friends arms never leaving his, but he still almost walked into somebody. They were in the way, it was their fault.
Harry let out a small laugh. It was more out of surprise than anything else, really, but everything felt okay again, suddenly. Ron didn’t hate him! Sure, he didn’t know the full story, but it was fine because they were still on the same side and really, Harry shared his view on the whole affair anyway.
Harry was on top of Ginny on the bed, the night sky tucked behind the yellow curtains, their clothes scattered around the room.
Seamus pulled out a joint, and lit it with his wand in his sleeve. “Yeah, but she is also way too bloody polite. She’d never say anything.”
, he decided, was getting him absolutely nowhere. He didn’t know how he was expected to just work things out. He’d never been the most introspective of people, but this wasn’t really something he could just go to Ron and Hermione about - he couldn’t exactly imagine asking them to just let him know how he felt about cock. So instead, he tried thinking about Ginny, as he strolled down the street in the crisp morning air, stepping over the cigarette butts that littered the pavement.
She sighed. “Yeah, but I am, though.” She grew more solemn. “I’m sorry, you know? I just panicked. I didn’t know what to do. I mean, that’s a pretty fucking heavy accusation I made.”
As Christmas approached, the group in the house got smaller with everyone off to see their families. Neville was first to go, two weeks before Christmas day. His Gran had been insisting he paid a visit for a while, and he said it wouldn’t be right, not seeing her for Christmas. Seamus and Dean insisted he took his advent calendar back, Seamus earnestly telling him that if his Gran didn’t approve she could shove it up her arse.
It could be worse, Harry supposed. Luna was sitting at the island in the kitchen with her long hair in three braids around her head, a bowl of frosties and her favourite mug. (It had a pink sheep hand painted onto it, and Ginny had got it for her last Christmas. Harry felt his courage start to shuffle away.)
In the days that led up to the new year, Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back to Grimmauld, and it was much less painful than it had been the week before. Perhaps it was because he had been reminded that the war really was over. Maybe it had something to do with the way Hermione was insisting they left the house to do something fun every day, because that way they wouldn’t forget that they could now. Grimmauld Place was back to being
“You seem down,” she stated, her eyes focusing on Harry’s right ear. “Is it nargles, do you think? Or is it to do with Ginny going back to the burrow?”
It seemed to him, all this had come out of nowhere. They’d been happy! They’d been doing fine! Sure, he had always known they didn’t look at each other quite the way Ron and Hermione did, or the way Dean and Seamus did. But that was to be expected, surely. They just needed more time, that was all.
“My diagnosis has been proven with thorough examination!” She giggled, and Harry was laughing too, so maybe this wasn’t so scary after all.
“For heaven’s sake” Hermione mumbled and grabbed onto his hand, pulling him away from it. She was swaying a bit too but she seemed less likely to end up on the ground than Harry did, so he anchored himself to her arm and let her drag him out. Oh! Ron was holding his other arm. That was lovely. The club was lovely, and so was the door that he was shoved through, and so was the cold air that he was in after that, and so were the lights that were coming from the windows and streetlights. It looked like they were heading for the tube. Ron definitely seemed to be guiding him there. That was lovely. It seemed important that his friends knew that.
As soon as they were through the doors, Hermione snatched everything the pair of them were holding and shoved both of her friends up the stairs.
Harry thought that was a bit mean. It wasn’t his fault that Malfoy had got in the way of his feet, because that’s who the person was, now Harry squinted in that direction. He looked very cold in those clothes. He didn’t even have a coat on. Harry was thinking about offering his coat over, but then Malfoy sniffed and walked away.
“Harry,” Ginny sighed. He hoped the mould was safe. He’d been breathing it in for months. He’d never really thought about it before, but knowing the potions that had likely been here, he really should have checked it.
Harry had to agree. “Sure is,” he said, but he hated holding grudges, he’d had to hate far too many people and he really didn’t want to add more to the list. So, “It’s okay though,” he told her.
But then if he didn’t want Ginny, who did he want? There weren’t any other women who he felt anything for - he knew that. And even if he did humour Ginny’s ideas, it wasn’t like there was a man he loved.
Shit. Harry had been so caught up in his worries that he hadn’t actually thought of an excuse. “She reckons we aren’t, like, a good couple”, he tried, “and she pretty much told me that and then left.” Harry muttered.
It turned out that George’s big plan for the night involved the garden gnomes, a flashmob, and lots of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes brand fireworks. They all stood in the garden as George lit them with his wand, counting down to midnight. And Harry didn’t start the new year with a kiss, like Ron and Hermione. But it was with a hug from Ginny, surrounded by his friends, in a place that he felt safe, and really, he decided, it couldn’t get much better than that.
Unfortunately, the calm of the morning was broken only seconds later, Seamus sliding down the banister, Ginny running after him.
“Oh, yes. She came to my room last night and told me she had to leave but she couldn’t say why. I was worried it was a curse for a moment but now I think she might not have meant it literally.” Luna told him, her lilting voice showing no signs of accusation. “Oh! Can you say why?” She gasped.
Once Harry had showered, brushed his teeth and even his hair, gotten dressed, shaved his face and given a moisturiser he found in the bathroom a try, he could think of no more excuses to stay in his room. He pulled open the door to go downstairs. He crossed his fingers tight, not one for superstition but willing to prolong the idea of having to talk about it for as long as possible. To be fair, he often was the first one awake, and it was only just past eight. So perhaps it made him cowardly, but if the others - especially Ron - were still in bed, he would most likely enjoy his breakfast a lot more.
He was on the front page again. This time it was mostly speculation about where he had gone and why he had vanished. (“You don’t owe them shit, mate”, Ron’s voice echoed in his head.) Otherwise it was filled with talk of Kingsley’s expected rise to Minister, the recovery of the wizarding economy and other things Harry was supposed to have an opinion on but didn’t quite understand. He threw it perfectly into the bin, shaking his head. But on the back cover, Draco Malfoy was smirking back at him.
“You know, I actually have been trying to find you since we got back,” Dudley said. “But you’re not an easy man to find.”
He thought about making a cup of tea, but there were no tea bags in the cupboard so he poured a glass of Hermione’s orange juice instead, and then sat down opposite Luna.
“He told me he has to help rebuild Hogwarts. If you hadn’t spoken for him he would probably be in Azkaban with his father.” Luna said softly.
Harry wrinkled his nose, but gave a nod of agreement. Luna went back to her frosties, humming what Harry just made out as the Oh Hellos. Harry smiled despite himself. Seamus had introduced the purebloods of the gang to muggle music and Luna especially had taken a liking to it.
Harry clenched his fists, jaw tightened. “Look. I’m not - that. Honest. I’ve never even thought about all that, I swear.”
Honestly, Harry thought, this was all very unfair. She’d just walked out, presumably apperated away by now, leaving Harry to deal with everything. How could he explain this to everyone? Oh and Ron! Ron would be furious - he’d assume that Harry had hurt his sister and how could Harry explain the truth without telling them what she had accused him of? Which, by the way, was completely unfounded. Harry wasn’t gay. He’d know if he was. He’d only ever been with girls, hadn’t even questioned that. Ginny hadn’t even let him speak, she just ran away without a second thought.
Although, Harry thought, slowing down as his eyes widened, the idea of being with a man, a future with a man - it wasn’t as terrible as he had hoped he’d find the idea.
Somewhere across the city, Draco was dancing. There were lights flashing and if he had any control over his thoughts he probably could have explained how they work, he imagined. Now though, there were more important things to do, like drink and smoke and forget that his father hated him and was in prison and most of his friends wouldn’t be seen with him and his mother was deeply disappointed. His wand was somewhere at the manor. He hadn’t been there all week and he didn’t need it anymore, anyway.
The news of the No-Longer-Dead were the reason that Harry’s move into Grimmauld place was a happy one, and he had vowed to make it nice enough that Sirius would be able to smile here, too. Living here was obvious for him, so he had picked a bedroom and made sure there weren’t any dead things in it. Admittedly, it was a less obvious move for all of his friends, but they had trickled in slowly and Harry felt the place was better for it. Ron and Hermione had come with him straight away, and awkwardly took a double room. It was strange, and different, but they were happy so Harry was too. Besides, it’s not like he hadn’t been expecting it. After a few days Ginny had come over, and she had asked Harry what was going to happen now, and Harry had said “I don’t really know” and Ginny had laughed and suggested they try being together again and Harry had laughed at that and he hadn’t laughed at much after the war ended so he figured it would be a good thing. Ginny moved into his room too then, and Harry hadn’t really got used to that, but he did like not having to be alone at night and he thought he’d probably adjust over time. The four of them started to spend most of their time performing cleaning charms, throwing rats out of windows, and building IKEA furniture the muggle way, which Harry insisted would make it feel more like a home.
Luna and Dean left soon after, and it was at that point that Harry felt the need to check with Ron that he’d still be welcome at the Burrow even with Ginny leaving him. Ron tutted and rolled his eyes, promising him that Molly would always want him around and anyway, if anyone had a problem they could do one. Harry punched him lightly in the shoulder, but nodded a thank you.
Harry shook his head, suddenly determined to move on. “Your parents were scared. You were a kid. It’s fine.”
“So. I think you might have a point,” Harry spoke in monotone, staring at the bedframe behind Ginny, “about the gay thing. But I don’t know how to know.”
“Oh, fuck, don’t be. I’m fine,” Harry said, because he realised he actually was. It had been a lot to take in, yesterday, but now he’d had the time to process the fact that he could maybe be a little bit gay, he was feeling more comfortable with it. “I overreacted to something, that’s all,” he promised.
They sat on Ginny’s bed, facing each other with legs crossed, and after a moment Ginny said, “and do we?”
Harry stared, shocked for a moment, before laughter erupted out of him, almost without his permission. He shook his head as he furrowed his brows at Ginny, but trailed off after a few moments had passed and she hadn’t joined in with his laughter.
“Well, you’re going to see her today, you know. We’re going back over for New Years, Ron says, if that’s ok with you? You could always talk to her about it.”
Ron nodded, so Harry and Ginny followed him to the door. Hermione suggested they apparate to the tube station and work from there, so they did, the general consensus being that Hermione was brilliant and always right.
They had all been happy. They were finally all happy, and Ginny had to go and ruin that. There had been a sort of peace that they had all been enjoying for the first time in years, really, and now Harry had to break the news that something had changed.
Today’s drink of choice was an iced latte from Saint Espresso, which he was definitely regretting given the cold. He tucked it into the scarf he was wearing to carry it without his fingers hating him, and started the walk back.
Ginny’s face fell, just for a second, but Harry didn’t think anyone else noticed. Her wide smile was back quickly as she smacked Seamus playfully on the arm, saying, “Plus you keep stealing my clothes.”
written on the bottom in permanent marker. Harry tried not to cry. Ginny smirked at him, noticing the tears anyway.
The three of them went back through the floo to the Burrow that afternoon, and it was just as lively. Bill and Fleur were absent, but otherwise the family was all together again. This time there wasn’t as much food cooking, but Molly still stacked plates full of leftovers, Harry’s being noticeably fuller than the rest. He heard her mumbling about looking after himself better as she pushed it his way.
“Well, eat your breakfast, I think.” Luna told him, seriously, but something in her eyes told him she hadn’t misunderstood.
Harry shrugged, and agreed. It certainly couldn’t make things worse. George had gone home already, but Hermione nodded too, and so Harry went upstairs to pull on some nicer jeans and attempt to flatten his hair.
At some point, Luna must have finished eating, because Harry was snapped out of his thoughts at the sound of her mug floating over to the sink.
gay.” Harry stared at her. It was hardly even an idea worth considering. And he hated pity. And he hated the way Ginny wasn’t answering him. Just sitting there, wrapped in the duvet, staring at him. “I’m not!” His voice was getting louder.
Harry ate too much and then sat on the floor and ripped paper off parcels like he should have gotten to as a child, and it was wonderful. His favourite gift was an old muggle record player from Arthur, who told him he had found it in the storage room at work, and noticed the words,
It was November, and Harry was not in a back alley, not yet. He was sitting on his bed, in Grimmauld Place, where everyone had eventually started to live while they waited for the future to start. After the battle it had seemed like the obvious place for him to go. If he had known he was to survive, it would have always been his plan, probably. That being said, he would have probably expected it to be a much more solemn affair. But then, who could have predicted moments after Harry had snapped the elder wand, Mcgonagall would announce that she had spoken to Dumbledore, walking and talking, and the evidence pointed towards the idea that anybody who had ever been murdered by or in the name of Voldemort was currently resurrecting themselves. That had led to a lot of aurors being sent around the country to find these people and take them to St Mungos, a lot of Obliviators working overtime with terribly confused muggles, and a lot of spirits lifted as the war came to an end. The No Longer Dead, as the Prophet had dubbed them, weren’t allowed to integrate yet. They were being kept in the hospital to be checked up on, and for those who had been deceased for a while, updated on the magical world. Still, the idea that Harry’s loved ones were breathing, and he could see them again - meet his parents, even - was one that he hadn’t properly stopped thinking about since he heard it.
On the other side, he was met by a kitchen full of singing tinsel, garlands of holly, the drooping Christmas tree and the sound of laughter from the next room, and he knew that this was as much of a home as Hogwarts ever was. There was a warmth that wasn’t only coming from the fire. Hermione stepped out behind him, and then Ron, who offered an arm to each of them, in jest. Harry grabbed onto his elbow, grinning, and let himself be pulled through to say his hellos.
Dudley nodded, awkwardly, and did. Harry followed suit. They sat on the bench for a moment, Harry pressing his lips together and keeping his eyes resolutely forward.There were ducks, swimming in a line on the river, and tourists leaning over the railings to look into its depths. Dudley cleared his throat.
It happened in a back alley in muggle London. A back alley in Muggle London tucked in between old, sketchy clubs, unnoticed unless you were looking.It happened at a time when the war was both a recent memory, hardly four months ago but already also somehow a past lifetime. It happened in a back alley in muggle London, probably. Although these things are hard to trace.
‘Draco Malfoy, Controvesially Pardoned Death Eater and known Pureblood supremicist, spotted outside muggle gay bars in London,’ read the caption. Harry frowned. He hadn’t known Malfoy was, well - like that. Not that Harry had a problem with it. Of course! Seamus and Dean had been together for years - he knew it was fine, he supported them. But Malfoy? And muggle clubs? Muggle clothes? Harry shook his head. It didn’t bother him. Malfoy didn’t need to be a part of his life anymore, maybe never again depending on whether they decided to go back to school once it was built back up. He pulled off the sheet of the paper with the picture and put it away in the drawer by his bed, not really thinking about why, before throwing the rest back away. Shaking his head, Harry got up and headed in the direction of the bright sunlight and the talking and the loud music that Seamus was definitely insisting was crucially important to keep on.
But as Christmas is wont to do, most of the day passed in a haze of shiny ornaments and food and music, and later, mulled wine, and before Harry knew it he was standing outside in the dark field as the stars shone down, cold and damp from definitely losing the snowball fight. And then soon enough again, he was warm and cosy in his pull out bed in Ron’s old room, listening to the soft snores beside him.
Dudley nodded, and walked away. Harry watched him make his way over to a blonde woman and grab her hand as they faded into the crowd.
He was well and truly wasted by the time Hermione pulled him up from the corner he was sitting in, and said it was probably time to leave. He wasn’t happy to hear it. He liked that corner. It was lovely and solid and if he had to move he might fall over, and the corner had a very funny phallic drawing next to it that he was busy appreciating.
“Um. Yeah, sure.” Harry knew he had turned red. It was probably normal to feel uncomfortable at that, he reckoned. Seamus was just trying to embarrass him, after all.
“Harry, you’re not even remotely enjoying this, are you?” She asked. She was laying on her back, determinedly staring at the ceiling as Harry looked over, eyebrows furrowed.
Ginny’s shoulders drooped. “Oh,” she said, and bit her bottom lip. “Will you? Because if you do, and I’m wrong, that’s cool. But I’ve seen the way you look at, like, guys you see in town, honest to god strangers, and it’s nothing like how you look at me.”
“Me and Perce have sorted it! Get excited, big brother!” George grinned, the mischievous look that he’d been missing lately back on his face. Percy grimaced, and Ron laughed. Hermione, on the other hand, seemed to have her own plans she was working on.
Harry snatched the paper back up. Malfoy in the picture was drunk, clearly. He was swinging off the arm of a young man Harry didn’t recognise, throwing a two fingered salute at the camera. Harry furrowed his brow. Malfoy was wearing leather trousers. A mesh shirt. He was holding a muggle cigarette. Harry sat back down on the bed, clutching the article.
Harry frowned. Ginny pulled herself up, and sat with the sheets nestled around her. She gazed into his eyes.
Harry nodded slowly. He thought he actually was. He said so. Hermione shot him a knowing smile, her lips together, and even Ron grudgingly nodded. Harry didn’t need to worry about Dudley, he decided. They would finish shopping, and then go home and eat the lasagne Kreacher had promised. And if Harry happened to buy Dudley a Christmas card, there would be nothing more said about it.
“Fuck’s an advent calendar?” Ginny said, which led to Hermione explaining muggle christmas traditions. Harry stopped listening and drank his tea that Seamus had made for him and put too much milk and not enough sugar in, but it was ok because everything was. He would go to Tesco and buy them all calendars later, but first he would let his friends argue about it.
Harry nodded. He did. But then again. “I don’t blame you, really Dudley. And like, it’s in the past now.” He shrugged. “I’ve dealt with worse, probably.”
“Ah.” said Harry. He could see the problem. He kicked Seamus, who dramatically rolled across the kitchen floor, giggling.
“What the fuck?” Ron sighed. He was holding a half eaten blueberry muffin, and had clearly left his table in a hurry. Hermione was close behind him, and Ginny trailed further behind still, at least having the grace to look a bit guilty.
That was when Harry saw Dudley Dursley walking in his direction, waving awkwardly, and he stopped in his tracks.
The day of Christmas was different to how it had been when they were younger, but better than the year before. It was complicated, in a way, with Percy’s exaggerated friendliness, and Molly’s worried looks between Harry and Ginny (Harry himself had decided to postpone those sort of worries until later), and George sitting slightly apart from his brothers, leaving space for somebody who wasn’t there, but it was full of hope too. Because this was the first Christmas in years where the future genuinely seemed like something to look forward to - friends and family who by all accounts should be dead waiting in hospital to meet them again next year, and then afterwards a whole life ahead, the war behind them.
“Let me finish then,” Harry laughed. “If we go to like, Diagon I was thinking some of those candles that change scent ‘cos of how you’re feeling. But if we stick to muggle places I did see this wooden clock thing in John Lewis. Maybe I’ll get both.”
Hermione glanced at Harry. He was glad to see she was surprised, too, but neither of them said anything more. Eventually, Harry fell asleep too, to the heavy breathing of the people he loved piled around him, and he felt safe.
Hermione was hugging him, now, supposedly as a comfort, and Neville was looking at him with an expression of loyalty, which was lovely considering how close he and Gin were.
The sun wasn’t shining through the window anymore, but they were still in the living room. Harry didn’t know the time, but the moon was high in the sky, Ginny was curled up asleep, her head on his lap, Dean was quietly sketching in the corner while Seamus smoked out the window and Luna was gazing at the stars. The music was quieter and Hermione was talking to Harry about taking the fidelius charm off the house. Harry didn’t really care either way.
“No, I know. Just. They’re my parents, you know? I can’t afford to leave any room for error.” Hermione stole a slice of toast absentmindedly. Harry swatted at her hand to no avail, but then remembered he was trying to be supportive and left his hand on her shoulder for a moment.
Harry smiled. He could! She really was the only person who he could talk to about the whole thing! He nodded enthusiastically.
“There’s a reason she likes me most,” Harry grinned, before turning to Ron. “Is everyone ready then?”
George raised an eyebrow in surprise. “Oh,” he said, and then squeezed Harry’s shoulder. “Then you’ll find a new girl and move on. And my little brother will get over it. If you’re happy, we’re happy.”
She was in his room quickly, a vial of potion in hand, which she threw over. Harry caught it in a hand and downed it in one. Down to about 50%, which was lucky, because he didn’t fancy throwing up all over Hermione.
So then he left too, and the house felt empty. Ron and Hermione were still there, ready to leave for the Burrow on Christmas Eve, but Harry had gotten used to the noise and despite the new furniture, the house started to feel just a little too much like it had in the past, when the three of them had been holed up. Harry always had nightmares, but there were more of them then, almost every night. The day before Christmas Eve, he slept in the same bed as Hermione and Ron, who insisted he wasn’t being a burden or making things awkward because nothing could do that to them - they were far too close.
Harry paused then, grabbing his cup again and looking about the room. All the students were hastily writing notes, the scratch of quills against parchment filling the otherwise quiet room now that Harry has stopped talking.
Draco let out a laugh that Harry didn’t think he could ever tire of, grateful the man had left the cold Malfoy mask behind him years ago. “Love you too, Potter. We will talk longer next time, I promise.” With that, Draco’s head disappeared from the flames and they returned to their normal warm glow.
“Yesses Headmistress,” the elf replied, nodding wildly at the Headmistress and then grasped both men’s hands tightly. “Wees be going now.” With that, the trio disappeared with the faintest of
Before Harry could respond, a familiar voice cut through all the other noise surrounding them. “Harry! Mate!”
Harry could feel a slight blush heat his cheeks as he glanced back over the mess once more, embarrassed by the sight. “Er...can you help sort out the papers, Minky? It appears my magic is a bit, um, wonky right now.”
As the door noiselessly closed behind him, Harry toed off his boots and hung up his outer cloak on the hook on autopilot. His fingers found their way behind his glasses to rub at his tired eyes as Harry took two unsteady steps forward before stopping dead in his tracks, gaze glued to the blond-hair-turned-golden in the dancing firelight and the grey eyes pinning him in place.
Harry watched as the many of the students nodded in understanding, adding notes to the pieces of parchment in front of them. No one seemed to have a look of complete confusion, so Harry took that as a win so far. “Now, for the next part of the lesson, I want you all to imagine you are in a friendly duel with the person seated next to. Their wand is at the ready, pointing right at you. What is a spell you would cast to defend yourself; the first spell that comes to mind?”
“What’s the meaning of this?” Poppy asked loudly, clearly startled by the men’s sudden appearance in her quiet ward as she appeared in the doorway to her office. Before Harry had chance even open his mouth in response though, Snape swayed violently on his feet and suddenly pitched forward. It took every ounce of strength that Harry still had to drop the man’s hand and instead pull Snape into a vice grip against his chest, preventing the man’s face from becoming acquainted with the hard stone floor beneath them. Harry struggled to hold the man upright; Snape was heavier than he looked. “Oh dear!” Poppy squeaked out as she quickly made her way over to the pair. “Put him down over here, Harry,” motioning to the nearest bed.
After Mimsy’s departure, the room fell into relative silence, with only the occasional clink as the tea cups were picked up and set back down again. What felt like an hour later, although was probably only about five to ten minutes, a knock at the door echoed around the room, pulling the three from their own thoughts. Minerva got up and opened the door. Her voice was soft, but Harry heard the quiet, “Thank you, Mr. Eliason,” that Minerva that gave out. Harry looked up from his cup then, focusing on newcomer, intrigued to see who it was.
Before Harry could delve farther into that thought though, he heard muffled voices, but he couldn’t make out any words. The voices continued at a near-constant hum until he felt the weight shift off his back as if whatever was pinning him down was being removed.
With a nod of her head, satisfied with Poppy’s response, Minerva directed her attention back to the two men laying on the infirmary beds, face grim. “Now, I would prefer to order you both to return to your quarters and rest for the remainder of the weekend -- no arguments. However, we don’t have the luxury of time right now. We need to sort out the events of today sooner rather than later to ensure the safety of not only the students, but you two as well. I refuse to fathom if something worse were to happen to either of you.” An emotion flashed across Minerva’s face, but Harry couldn’t decide if it was pain or worry, but he warmed at the feeling of being cared about. “Anyway, please come to my office as soon as Poppy discharges you.”
“What can Minky be getting Profess’r Potter?” the young elf squeaked out as soon as she appeared before her large eyes saw the state of the room around her. “Oh dears,” she breathed, wringing her tiny hands.
The next day dawned much earlier than Harry would have hoped, light streaming across his eyes as he and Draco apparently had forgotten to draw the curtains the night before. He knew he was alone in the bed, mainly because long limbs were not splayed over him. Draco would probably deny it with his last dying breath, but the man resembled an octopus when he slept, tangling his long limbs with Harry’s at every opportunity.
So...I suck at updating in a timely manner. I know this. I accept this. I wish I could say I will do better, but I would hate to lie to anyone. Because of that, please just accept my humble apologies for the delay and eternal gratitude if you are still here with me.
Brown eyes flew up to his face and Harry noted the brief flash of worry in them before Hermione schooled her features. “Oh hi, Harry. I was just dropping off some paperwork for the Headmistress and thought I would pop in and say hello since I was already here.”
“Like hell you are! Snape’s still bleeding -” Ron let his eyes dart to the man still sitting on the ground behind Harry, “- and you both somehow survived the bloody killing curse! I think that last part constitutes as not being ‘fine’. And until we know who tried to kill you or why, it isn’t safe to stay out in the open like this.”
“Impressive, Mr. Potter,” a deep voice called, dripping with mock disdain, but Harry could hear the actual masked praise behind it. He looked up from the book on his desk to see Snape leaning in the doorway to the classroom, arms crossed against his chest and obsidian eyes watching Harry closely.
“I fully support Poppy,” Minerva said in support of the mediwitch. “Gentlemen, I am no longer young woman. Please keep this in mind before you both continue to scare years off my remaining life by the dozen. While I do care for you both, I have enough other things to worry about than just you two. You will both stay put until Poppy deems you fit enough to be discharged and you will not argue on that point. Do you understand me?”
Orienting himself now that he had the opportunity to look around, Harry realized he had been buried under the outer wall of the Three Broomsticks, judging by the gaping hole in the side of the building and the other boards and bricks scattered in heaps around him.
charm. This is a pure defensive spell because its sole purpose is to protect the caster with no intended negative action against the opponent, although there are times that some spells can ricochet instead of being absorbed by the shield.
Hermione had the grace to flush then. “Fine,” she conceded with a huff. “I wanted to check in on you after yesterday. Is that so hard to believe.”
As he sat back down, a deep drawl came from Harry’s left side, barely loud enough for Harry to hear over the sound echoing in the Great Hall. “Still the center of attention I see, Mr. Potter. How...
While he had rewatched the memory several more times with Snape and Minerva, trying to find any possible clues hiding in the dim corners of the memory, they all came up empty each time. It was frustrating to say the least.
Not physically or mentally ready to get into the details with Draco, Harry dodged the question, asking one of his own instead. “How did you know?” his voice barely above a whisper.
HOWEVER, because it's been so long since my last update, I have an extra long update this time around. It will be broken in two parts though -- this shorter chapter and then I will add the next chapter tonight or tomorrow morning when I finalize the last edits (I'm still trying to catch those pesky verb tenses...). Hopefully these chapters aren't too bad. I'm still not completely happy with them, but it is what it is at this point.
Blood was running down the left side of the older man’s face from a gash along his hairline. “Snape!” Harry whispered loudly, hovering over the man to press the sleeve of his cloak against the gash in attempts to stem the bleeding. “Wake up, Snape! Please don’t be dead!”“Do cease your yelling, Potter,” Snape quietly growled out, followed by a long, pained groan. A pale hand materialized, hovered near the side of Snape’s head before unceremoniously falling to his chest.
Harry let out a long, shaky breath, trembling hands grasping at Draco’s forearms to steady himself as he felt himself start to sway. “It’s a long story and I’d...I’d rather not think about it anymore for the time being.” Draco opened his mouth to argue but Harry cut him off. “Please, Draco. You already know that I was attacked and I’m still standing, just a bit worse for wear.”
Giving the students a moment to finish up, Harry took another drink, happy his coffee was still warm thanks to the warming charm he had cast before he started his lecture. Setting the cup aside again, he noticed most of the students were just about finished up with their notes. “Let’s get into the good stuff now, shall we? Please open your books to Chapter 2,” Harry called out before diving into his first official lecture of his Hogwarts teaching career.
, but I think I me-messed it up,” she all but whispered the last part, dropping her head to her hands and crying harder. “It didn’t look r-r-right; the sh-shield. I-I remember in class, when Pro-professor Snape cast the
Once Harry heard that Snape was back teaching though, he could never pluck up the nerve to visit and thank the man as he so desperately wanted to do. For all the Gryffindor courage Harry supposedly had, that courage did not generally filter over when dealing with Snape.
The boy shifted in his seat nervously, darting his eyes around the room quickly before quietly responding,“The -- the second one was brighter, sir.”
“I -” Snape paused, his dark brow furrowing etching a deep line in his skin, “- I have never seen a spell react that way. Honestly, I’ve never seen magic look like that.” The bewilderment was clear in Snape’s voice, a tone that neither other occupant in the room could ever recall hearing before.
Admittedly, it had been awkward to say the least when both men started to work together. Old habits die hard, as they say. However, neither were the same man they were the last time they had spoken. Harry had grown up and had found a deep respect for Snape after viewing the man’s memories and Snape, well, he just had a new respect for life in general. Nearly dying in the horrific manner that he had was bound to change the man. They had quickly found a rhythm of co-existence.
Draco’s voice pulled Harry back to the present. “I’m still in Healer Blackshaw’s good graces, so that’s all that matters,” speaking of the aged Healer he was studying under. Draco’s face then turned in the flames, looking off at something on his end, but what Harry wasn’t sure. “Look, I should get going,” Draco sighed, his focus coming back to Harry. “It’s getting late and I have more studying to do.”
Locating the trunk he had brought earlier in the day, he opened it and began taking out the last few items. Removing the large afghan first, a soft thing of gray and pale green yarn courtesy of Mrs. Weasley and her magic knitting needles, he draped it across the back of the sofa. Turning back to the open trunk and with a quick flick of his wrist, several pictures flew out and settled themselves against the walls and along the bookshelves and mantle while a battered, but well loved, tea kettle flew through the archway into the kitchenette in the back corner.
Poppy was clearly still doubtful of Snape’s request by the dubious expression she wore. However, despite her misgivings, Harry watched as she pulled her wand from her apron and began running charm after charm over the other man.
“No one?” Harry stood, walking across the front of the room looking at different students as he passed. With a small sigh, he continued, “Alright, I will explain this concept but I do expect active participation in this class. I prefer volunteers, but I will not be above calling anyone out at random.
Novalee’s face took on a look of frustration then, creases forming as her brows drew together. “I don’t know what happened. My shield was there and then it wasn’t. I thought that it...that it didn’t work because it w-wasn’t there as a shield anymore.” Her voice grew distraught again as she continued talking. “It turned into ribbons. So many colored ribbons that were swirling around you. And then - then it - then you - EXPLODED!” Novalee sobbed out, burying her face tight against Harry’s chest once more.
Taking a few careful steps backwards until the bed hit the back of his knees, Harry finally sat down, swinging his legs up and settling back against the pillows. With practiced efficiency, Poppy ran her scans, warm yellow and blue and white light falling over first Harry and then Snape as the woman checked her two charges over, everyone else holding their breath for the results. As quickly as she had started, Poppy was soon lowering her wand, the warm magic lighting the room fading away.
No hands raised, which honestly didn’t surprise Harry. He had just thrown a lot of different information at the class and by the looks on some of their faces, they were still processing it all, while others were still calming their blush.
Harry felt a small smile cross his lips at Minerva’s concern. “Fine. Better than Snape I’d wager,” he replied, casting a quick glance to the other bed and earning an steely glare that could rival a basilisk’s in return.
Those sensations, simultaneously crashing over him, caused Harry to shut his eyes tightly again, bracing his hands on his knees and swallowing convulsively to push the bile back down, until he no longer felt like he was spinning wildly out of control. Blinking his eyes slowly open for a second time, he glanced over to his nightstand through narrowed slits and spotted a folded piece of parchment. With slow, deliberate movements as to not aggravate his body further, he grabbed the note, eyes skimming over the familiar handwriting.
“I’ll walk you out. You two stay put.” Poppy eyed both men. “We need to discuss a few more things before I am ready to let you out of my sight.” With that, Minerva and Poppy headed towards the door, heads together, their quiet voices fading with each step away from Harry and Severus, leaving the pair alone.
The room was comfortably furnished with a gently worn leather sofa and matching arm chairs flanking the hearth and several plush rugs scattered about the floor, a buffer between his feet and the cool stone beneath them. Several large bookcases flanked the hearth and Harry was quite proud of the progress he had made in filling them already. He had scavenged through the Black library for any tomes that may prove useful this year, among others for more personal reading if he found the time, and added his own book collection from his mastery studies.
Harry would not necessarily call himself and Severus ‘friends’ at this juncture, but they were pleasantly civil which worked well enough and for that, Harry was grateful. Making amends with Snape was something he had wanted to do since the dust had settled after the war, but the man had been a hard one to track down once Harry realized that Snape had not actually died in the Shrieking Shack as he had originally assumed. Harry had tried though, even convincing Ron to do a bit of snooping after he graduated from the Auror academy.
“Well enough.” Draco shrugged, causing the flames to dance around with the action. “I’ll be happy when my exams are over. This revising is driving me nutters, but I suppose it is better than Anderson making me inventory in the potion storeroom again. That task is enough to drive the sanest wizard off his broom.”
Poppy shifted slightly, the small action drawing attention to mediwitch still stationed between the two infirmary beds. “Harry, Severus,” she started, looking between both men. “As much as it pains me to admit, I’m at a loss. Generally speaking, you both are as healthy as can be expected in light of recent events. With that said though, I insist that you both stay for further observation until we have some sort of idea of what caused your episodes and if there is a likelihood they will happen again. I’m sure the Headmistress will support my decision,” she finished, looking over to Minerva who is now standing at the end of Snape’s infirmary bed.
Disoriented, Harry tried desperately to remember what had happened but he could only get snippets, like when the television at the Dursley’s would fade in and out during particularly nasty rain storms.
“As you should, Potter. As you should.” Before Harry had time to open his mouth to retort back, Snape was leaving in a flourish of black fabric, leaving Harry staring at the empty doorway. Shaking his head, he went back to the book in front of him, diving back into his notes again.
Before Harry let himself sink back into his woe-is-me thoughts, he decided to go about his nightly routine, brushing his teeth and changing into his favorite silky sleep pants while removing his shirt. Draco always preferred when he slept shirtless; ‘the better to hear your heartbeat’ Draco would always respond whenever Harry would ask why. He would then try to play it off as medically speaking, making sure Harry's heart stayed beating through the night, but Harry knew better. Draco had turned into a sap -- a sap that Harry was utterly besotted with.
It was then that the memory dissolved around Minerva, Snape and Harry, depositing them back in the Headmistress’ office, the silence of the room deafening after the chaos of the memory. Harry looked around, eyes searching Minerva’s and Snape’s faces, for what he wasn’t certain. All Harry knew is he felt disoriented, seeing the events of the day from the outside perspective as they fell into place with his own memory of the day, making him realize just how bad things were.
It just cannot be correct.Panic continued to bloom in Harry’s chest as he watched Poppy mutter charm after charm. He didn’t face down Voldemort, come back from the dead-limbo-whatever, defeat the snake-faced bastard, and become an expert in spell theory just to end up a casualty of some new magic that he couldn’t yet unravel -- something he was supposed to specialize in.
The room fell silent for a moment, as everyone took in Snape’s words, mulling the potential of truth behind his words when all other factors were considered together. “Could it be the girl’s spell?” Harry turned his head quickly to the side at the sound of Hermione’s voice breaking the silence, before turning back towards Snape, waiting on his response.
“Second, I am happy to announce that Professor Snape will continue to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts this term as Professor Barrows -” the Headmistress motioned to a portly sandy-haired man reminiscent of Slughorn two seats to her left who struggled to stand from his low seat and was blushing furiously, “- has agreed to a continue as the Potions professor for another term. However, Professor Snape will still continue to oversee the Potions Mastery Prep course for any interested seventh year. Please see your head of house for further details.
With a quick nod, Poppy turned her focus to the other bed. “Severus?”Snape, who had been watching Harry as he spoke, turned his attention to the mediwitch with a slight frown. “Unfortunately, I have to agree with Potter. The last thing I remember was coming out of the Great Hall, having just forced down a meager dinner and then nothing up until the point where Potter slapped me,” shooting another glare towards Harry, albeit milder this time.
This time several hands raised around the room and Harry nodded to a small blond girl in a Slytherin robe. “Miss Bishop.”
, he thought as he grabbed his wand from the side table and cast the stinging hex as requested, enough power behind it that Snape should feel something akin to a very hard pinch on his upper arm.
as a house elf appeared behind him. “Can Minky be getting Master Potter anything?” the small elf squeaked out, eyes hopeful as she smoothed the pillowcase covering her small form.
Harry reached out again and this time Snape slide his hand into Harry’s outstretched one, a strange tingle passing between the two men at the contact. Harry paid no mind to the sensation, attributing it to whatever magical force kept them two of them alive when in any other magical reality they should be dead. Instead, he focused on using the little energy he still had in pulling Snape to his feet and supporting the other man and he regained his equilibrium.
“Not at all,” he replied with an easy laugh that eased some of the tension remaining deep in his bones, pulling Hermione into a tight hug. He felt her slender arms wrap around his middle, squeezing tightly in return.
Harry let his eyes fall closed once again to the sound of the quiet words now exchanged between Hermione and Neville, too tired to fight to still-present exhaustion, and was on the cusp of sleep when he heard Poppy’s voice laced with frustration echo around the room. “I just don’t understand.
“My -?” Harry choked out, staring over at the other man, certain he must of lost his mind if Snape thought Harry could have anything to do with today’s events.
Without preamble, Harry set the note down, threw back the potion, and laid back down with the covers nearly pulled over his head, eyes closing on their own accord as he slipped back into darkness.
Looking back, their relationship was actually one that didn’t surprise many people, at least those close to the pair, outside of Harry and Draco themselves. But somehow, with all of their tumultuous history, they made a relationship work and they were now sharing a flat and were still so stupidly in love four years later.
I do apologize for the delay in posting. I had been sick, then work got a bit crazy and then this chapter was just hard to get how I wanted it -- but I think I got it sorted out decently in the end.
Sometime later, several knocks echoed around the room, pulling Harry’s attention away from the book on his lap. Glancing up at the muggle clock on the mantle, Harry was surprised first at the time and second that someone would be knocking at his private chamber doors at this time on a Sunday. The knocks sounded again, more impatient this time, as Harry pulled himself off the sofa. Opening the door moments later, his eyes focused on the small fist poised to knock again before focusing on the fist’s owner. “‘Mione?” he asked, surprised to see the woman. “What are you doing here?”
Looking up at his old head of house, he smiled. “Good so far. I have the last bit I just brought today to unpack, but so far I don’t have any complaints. It is admittedly good to be back.”
In the end, both were left in just their pants and Draco was soon gently pushing Harry back to lay against the pillows and climbing in next to him, pulling the blankets around them both. Harry felt the heat of Draco’s skin against his own, safe and comforting, as Draco pulled him against his chest and pressed a kiss to the top of his head that spoke volumes in the silence. “Sleep now,” Draco whispered into the darkness, his breath ghosting over Harry’s ear. And Harry did just that, in the safety of Draco’s embrace to the steady
Draco choked on whatever he was drinking on his end, eyebrows shooting up to disappear under his fringe.“What the hell has happened to the man?! I never thought I would live to see the day Severus Snape freely gave the Boy Wonder a compliment. You didn’t
The group watched as Novalee apparently made of up her mind and took a few steps toward the colorful storefront of Barlow’s before stopping in her tracks suddenly. The girl’s posture went rigid as her head whipped to the left, her focus going towards the dark alley that Harry could recall from his own memory.
Blinking a few times, wide eyes glued to his upper arm where he knew the hex should of hit, Harry just had to shake his head. “I saw you hex me, but...nothing. I didn’t feel a thing. Not a pinch. Not a sting. Not even a tingle.”
September soon bled into October as Harry found a steady rhythm with his day to day activities. As the days worn on, he came to realize he hated marking essays just as much, if not more, as he hated writing them as a student. A necessary evil, as Minerva called them, especially for a theory course that had little other grading opportunities. But that didn’t mean Harry couldn’t grumble through them every evening.
“Don’t you ever scare me like that again,” she scolded after she pulled away and set her steely gaze on the pair again. “I cannot even begin to tell you the things that went through my mind when Mr. Weasley’s patronus came charging into my office telling me that there had been an incident with two professors in Hogsmeade and that several of the Aurors were watching the children. What in Merlin’s name happened?”
“Severus,” the exasperation was clear in the woman’s voice, “I have already ran them all. Your magic levels are adequate, albeit mildly fluctuating, as established already. Your vitals are fine -- better than I honestly would have expected with how you both turned up here today. What more do you expect?”
His head snapped to the side, positive he had not heard Snape correctly, only to find the man sitting on the edge of his infirmary bed, staring intently over at him with an expression that promised Snape was completely serious. Despite Snape’s expression, Harry couldn’t help the “What?” that tumbled from his lips, still stunned.Snape simply rolled his eyes and Harry would have snorted at the gesture if he hadn’t been somewhat worried for the man, certain that Snape had just lost his bloody mind. “You heard me, Potter. Hex me. Do not argue.”
Turning next towards the set of closed doors at the back of the room, he opened the first door, his trunk obediently following behind him into the bedroom. He motioned the trunk to the settle at the end of the bed and as soon as it was, he reached in to gently grab the last item housed inside.
He held the large picture frame delicately in his hands and stared at the two pictures moving side by side. On the left side of the frame was the picture of his mother and father that Hagrid had given him all those years ago -- his first picture of his parents. He loved to watch them twirl and smile and laugh as they danced together. This is how he chooses to think of them -- carefree and so completely in love.
That description had Poppy’s face paling considerably, along with the rest of the room, Harry included as the description aligned with his own memory. “It was really that bad?” Harry nodded and could see Snape mirroring the action out of the corner of his eye. “Why didn’t either of you come see me?”
Rolling over, Harry threw his hand haphazardly over the side of the bed to fumble along the nightstand in search of his glasses. He felt the cool metal and grabbed them gently before sliding them up his nose, the room slowly coming into focus around him as he blinked behind the lenses. His body ached even worse than the night before. Now it was a deep ache into his very core. With a pained groan, Harry swung his legs over the side of the bed sitting up, pausing for a moment as the world swam before his eyes and his stomach did an uneasy flip.
Harry and Severus simply nod their understanding, neither willing to argue with the formidable woman.
With no argument, Snape downed the potion, albeit moving slowly to accomplish the task. As the last drop passed the man’s lips, Poppy plucked the empty vial from his hand, setting it on the bedside table before working on patching up the gash on his head now that the bleeding had finally stopped. It was several minutes more before she was satisfied that Snape was in no danger of immediate peril or death.
With a similar skepticism, Minerva arched her brow at the grumpy man and instead directed her attention to the mediwitch that stood between the two beds. “Poppy, how are they?”
It just had to be Snape. Harry couldn’t remember anyone else being that close to him when shit hit the fan.
“Very good!” Harry beamed at the class and resumed his seat at the corner of his desk. “Now, let’s talk about these spells. The first spell --
At that, Novalee let out a small squeak, her lip trembling again, but Harry was quick to reassure her before she could start panicking all over again. “You’re doing perfect. Now you’re going to feel a light touch of my wand to your temple just for a moment as I grab that memory.” He did just that, making sure to be as gentle as possible so Novalee wouldn’t even feel the pull of the memory; this process could be excruciating if not performed properly. Soon shimmering blue wisps were fluttering at the tip of his wand, which he moved into the empty vial that Snape silently held out.
After that, Harry allowed his eyes to fall closed in an attempt to stem the dull headache that had started building with the earlier onslaught of light and took a moment to catalogue his body. He didn’t hurt nearly as bad as he had all night and much of the day with the exception of the headache, so that was something. He still didn’t feel great by any stretch of the imagination, but he at least didn’t feel really any worse than he did when researching in his room earlier.
The woman clucked at him in response. “None of that now, Harry! You may call me Minerva. We have known each other long enough for first names, don’t you think?”
Snape drank greedily, allowing the water to sooth the dryness of his throat until there was nothing left in the glass. “Good?” Harry asked, gesturing to the glass in his hand and Snape gave a nearly imperceptible nod in return. Setting the glass back on the table, Harry took a step back to give the man a bit more breathing room.
“Severus?” she asked, glancing over at the other man. All she got in response was an cold obsidian glare. “Good. Mimsy,” she called and a moment later an elf with eyes and ears too big for her small head appeared. Minerva gave one last hard look at the two men, instilling fear deep in their bones of her wrath should they disobey her orders. “Please escort both Professor Potter and Professor Snape to the infirmary.”
Harry heard his name called and more screaming and more crying, but he couldn’t focus on any one sound. Several pops cut through the yelling and crying as Aurors arrived, clearly discernible with their red cloaks, splitting off into groups to do Merlin knows what. But that didn’t matter now as Harry looked below him and found black fabric covering the lump under him.
There were several beats of stunned silence before Poppy’s alarmed voice cut in. “What was the meaning of -” but her admonition was cut off by a long pained groan coming from the bed and dark eyes slowly blinking open. Before Snape tried to talk, Harry grabbed his earlier glass that still had water in it and slowly tipped it back against the man’s lips.
“You weren’t interrupting at all. I was just going over my notes for my next class.” Harry motioned down to the text and parchment in front of him. “Can I let you in on a little secret?” The girl nodded and stepped closer to Harry’s desk as he crooked his finger in her direction, motioning her forward. “I’m a bit nervous with this teaching business.” Harry whispered, not sure why he actually told the young girl this. Novelee’s eyes grew wide at the admission.
She was still the strict Scotswoman of Harry’s youth, but she was softer around the edges, figuratively speaking, adopting a bit more of a motherly air about her. Looking out among the faces in the packed hall, she continued, “I will keep this brief as I am well aware that everyone is more interested in the feast than my blathering, but there are a few start of term notices I do need to make you all aware of. First and foremost, the Forbidden Forest is still forbidden for good reason and unless you wish to possibly lose appendages or worse, you will heed my warning.
“Baxter, Jones and myself will round everyone up and babysit them until McGonagall or any of the other professors get here to bring everyone back to the castle,” Ron replied very matter-of-factly, switching into Auror-mode. Before Harry had time to even form a response, Ron conjured his patronus and sent the silver terrier off with a message to the Headmistress. “Just go,” the red-head urged, placing his hands on Harry’s shoulders again so he could look his friend directly in the eye. “We’ve got this. Just get yourself and Snape to Pomfrey before someone tries to cart either of you off to St. Mungo’s. I know that is the last place either of you would like to end up right about now.”
Harry had always been sensitive to the feel of magic, although it wasn’t until a few years ago that he actually realized what he had been sensing since he was eleven years old. The amount of building light magic seemed misplaced though in the middle of the small village street in the middle of the day and Harry started to turn around to seek out the source. In that same moment, but a moment too late, he sensed the building dark, violent magic nearby as well. Unable to search for both sources at once, Harry turned just quick enough to see a dark figure in the alley shadows, wand pointed directly at him and Snape.
Tucking his wand back in his forearm holster, Harry looked around the class. “Did anyone notice a difference?” Several more hands raised at this question and Harry looked towards a brown-haired boy that sat near the front of the room. “Mr. Collins.”
Harry had been to his quarters many times already, having spent more nights here over the last month than at his own flat, but he still had a bit more to do tonight before he would feel appropriately settled in to start the term.
Harry realized that is exactly what was happening as the weight fully left his back and he was able to take a deep lung-full of air. The voices clearer now, just slightly muffled by the continued ringing in his head were now discernible as a mixture of yelling that Harry couldn’t quite make out and clear sobbing.
This time his thoughts focused on Snape, trying to remember what happened to the other man. No matter how hard he tried though, the last thing Harry could remember was his hand closing around Snape’s forearm in a vain attempt to pull him to safety, but he couldn’t be certain if he had succeeded.
“Potter, hex me. A mild stinging hex should be sufficient.” Snape’s voice was deep and commanding, cutting through Harry’s daydreaming.
As the time passed, Harry frequently found his eyes wandering over to the other bed, watching Snape sit eerily still, expression indicating the man was deeply in thought, most likely focused on trying to unravel this mess. Harry was hoping Snape was making more headway than he was, oddly at a loss for how everything -- the multiple, converging magics, the misspoken spell, the intense physical reactions -- fit together. It was a riddle that was frustrating to say the least, and one that was not doing any favors for the still dull ache in his head.
Thank you so much for everyone that has given my little story a chance! I was so surprised with the kudos, comments and everything. You all warm my little heart!
your emergency contact. You better hope he is holed up at home today with the ‘Do Not Disturb’ wards up because Merlin knows I won’t be able to stop the gossip comet on this with as many witness are standing around and I can only hold Hermione off for so long.”
“I - I -” Novalee started, her eyes furiously blinking away the tears as her breath caught on her words.
Leaning back with his arms supporting him, Harry took a moment to just think. It was moments like this, just the simple day-to-day moments that most would overlook as insignificant, that Harry loved the most. If someone would have asked him back in school if we would ever picture himself in this moment, overwhelmed with love for Draco just after a simple conversation, he would have insisted they needed to  see a Mind Healer immediately. But here he was, full of that warm fuzzy feeling that comes from simply loving another person and being loved unconditionally in return.
The door closed with a solid thud in Novalee’s wake, leaving the three adults alone. Harry rubbed his hands over his face, falling back into the cushion of the chair behind him. “Well that was interesting.”
“Yeah, she’s a good kid. Brilliant really. She’s top of my class for the second years.” Harry smiled. “So what now?”
By this time, they had made it down to the village and were nearing the Three Broomsticks when one of the older Ravenclaw students flagged down Snape. The pair started to head towards the student and Harry was just about to tell Snape that he was going to go off towards the Shrieking Shack to make sure no students were causing trouble, knowing the older man despised the place for good reason, when he felt a building of light energy, like someone was getting ready to cast a
“I would like to know that answer as well,” Minerva’s voice cut in as the woman strode over towards the group, the infirmary doors closing noiselessly behind her. “You both seemed relatively fine last night. Understandably worn out, but I never would have assumed that either of you were under that level of pain or I would have insisted -” the word punctuated by an steely glare at both men, “- that you both be escorted to the infirmary as you left.”
With a small nod, Harry quietly replied, “Yes ma’am.” He knew there was no point to argue with the woman.
Minerva cast a quick glance at the red-head, nodding in return. “Mr. Weasley.” However, her gaze quickly returned to Harry and Snape. “Will someone tell me what happened.”
!” He let the stag prance around the room for the moment, all eyes of the students glued to the lightly shimmering animal, until Harry flicked his wrist and the patronus disappeared into the air.
Turning towards Snape briefly, Harry quirked an eyebrow in question. “Have you ever seen a shield spell look like that?”
“Of that, I am more than aware,” Harry replied, a genuine smile flitting across his lips for the first time since this ordeal began as he slowly bent to crouch beside the grouchy man. “I wasn’t rescuing you. I was rescuing him. I am well aware of your skills -- both wandless magic and curses of, let’s say, questionable origin. There has been enough drama and mayhem for one day, we don’t need you adding to it. Anyways, we should get back to the castle.”
Exhaustion was quickly settling into his body anyways as Harry crawled into the large bed and settled himself in the middle among a mound of pillows, hugging one tightly to his chest. With one last look at the picture beside the bed, he closed his eyes willing sleep to claim him quickly.
“Bye, Professor,” she called, running out the door. Shaking his head at the young girl, he returned his attention to his book and parchment once more.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair before he quietly responded. “Someone tried to kill us.” His fingers pulled at the clumps of his hair in frustration before continuing just as quietly. “I don’t know who or why or if they were aiming for Snape or me or both of us. All I know is that someone aimed the killing curse at us.”
Nodding in agreement, Harry turned and made it slowly over to Snape, his body aching with every step.
“So if you are both ready, I would like to bring the student in. ” Both men nodded in assent. “Very well. Mimsy,” Minerva called out and a moment later the house elf popped into existence. “Please alert Mr. Eliason -”
With that, wand in hand, Harry thought of a happy memory -- the first time he flew on a broom. Although it was no where near his happiest memory, it was happy enough to generate his stag as he yelled, “
With a gentle flick of his wand, an action he had done countless times, Harry summoned the stack of parchment he had lain out on his desk after classes ended on Friday. At least he tried to summon the parchment.
“I tried to save you!” The volume of her words echoed off the stone walls, startling the adults. “I tried to cast a
Harry knew Poppy spoke the truth. Without an even basic knowledge of the situation, especially potential magically inflicted injuries, there was always a risk of magical backlash where more harm than good would be done even with standard diagnostic and healing spells. It wasn’t always feasible to get the story first, but when the opportunity presented itself, any healer worth one’s salt would be out of their mind to pass it up.
Harry felt his cheeks warm as blush flooded them, involuntarily taking another step back to be just outside of the man’s physical reach and direct aim. Even laid up in the infirmary bed, Harry wasn’t stupid enough to think the man couldn’t or wouldn’t hex him blind given the right incentive, no matter how friendly of terms they were on. “Well -” he paused, rubbing the back of his neck nervously, “- that would be because of me, Snape. You weren’t waking up for Madame Pomfrey using magical means, so I tried, let’s say...muggle means.”
Snape cleared his throat. “Thank you, Ms. Bishop, for your assistance.” he said, speaking for only the second time since Novalee entered the room, looking at the young girl still sitting in Harry’s lap. Novalee looked up wide-eyed, startled as if she forgot others were in the room.
“So strange...” Hermione muttered more to herself, although loud enough for others to still hear in the otherwise quiet room, giving Harry’s hand a reassuring squeeze. “I’ve never heard or read of a curse reaction like that, at least a curse that didn’t kill the recipient in a manner of hours.” Everyone was seemingly in agreement with that statement as there were five solemnly nodding heads around the room, Harry included.
“In case it escaped your notice,” Draco snarled. “You have no say in the matter! It’s my business, my art, my project and Sirius was
“Can you say anything else?” Cooper glared at him with watery eyes and it reminded him of someone else with a fiery disposition.
Laughter rang out and normally, he would ignore it, but it was accompanied by cheers and that intrigued him enough to search among the dozens of students for the source.
“Disappointing,” Sirius shrugged, aura spotting with red. “It means that nothing has changed. It’ll be the same décor, the same spells, the same statues, the same judgment.
“I mean, Snape was a Death Eater. Moody certainly wasn’t. Complete opposites. Not to mention Moody was the one to bring Snape in.”
“Anyways,” Malfoy glared when Ron opened his mouth. “Bandit can do it and he can do it without getting caught. I’ve trained him to take more than just shiny things, he can wipe them clean.”
“Well, to accomplish my goals, I need to be determined,” Smith said with a nose in the air. “Besides, you won’t be complaining when—”
But not happy. While it had been expected, it still hurt. It bothered Harry how mistreated House Elves were, it bothered him to his core.
Draco looked up to see her already standing in front of him with a hesitant smile on her face. Despite Harry’s lack of enthusiasm, Sparks really was a good Auror.
The more he watched the Dark Lord’s magic, the more he felt a sense of Deja Vu. There was something about him that had Draco itching to pinpoint it. It made him uncomfortable, and he knew the outcome wasn’t what he’d want to hear.
With a hive, most of it is in the moment. They don’t dwell on the past unless the past meets them. The past to most of them, was one word.
Draco placed his glass down too hard and the whisky spilled over, but that was a mess for Blaise to clean. As he stood up, he had to do it slowly and carefully, perhaps he
“They’re courting me,” Harry whispered, eyes not able to look away from the passage. The gifts, the trinkets, even the visit in the graveyard—it was all a part of a courtship.
A couple at the nearest bus stop were arguing and while that drew attention from bystanders, that wasn’t what interested Harry. No, what interested him was their emotions. Dark green saturated the air surrounding one half of the couple, the woman.
Frottage wasn’t exactly what Draco thought about when he jerked off to thoughts of Potter, but it was the closeness that was second in his mind.
. Ron had a family that loved him, had a family there for him, had a family that gave a damn. All Draco wanted was someone to talk to, someone that could listen to him and someone who had been there.
There was an overwhelming amount of pain inside of Lupin, that much Harry could feel, but there was also a wide berth where there was a lot of love. It was sickening.
Every time I write a journal entry for Draco, I like him more. Shsk does that sound odd? He's very complex but I like that about him. His dichotomy is definitely something that pulls me in.
The only thing that stood out was a painting. A self-portrait over the mantle. He couldn’t help but snort. Malfoy
“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Draco said as he held up a hand and his quill fell to the floor. “Shacklebolt as in
may have grieved, your magic hasn’t. Your magic feels incomplete. Until you can acknowledge that for yourself, and learn to live without it, that weird feeling is never going to go away. You need to learn how to look at yourself objectively, and this book will help.”
it. Maybe that’s my fault. Maybe I didn’t show it enough, maybe I didn’t try harder. Maybe I should have done more.”
“Regulus left me money,” Malfoy continued with a glare. “I always wondered why. I never even met him; I was just a baby when he disappeared.”
Harry decided to not bother with the same speech on how his husband needed to be more careful when disturbing the wildlife of these creatures. He didn’t have the patience to nag Draco tonight. Not when all he wanted to do was spend time with him.
Coil brows furrowed as he wrote his notes. “How did he get out of the painting? How did their positions reverse?”
Painting-Malfoy shook his head and his hands moved back and forth in an attempt to get some kind of message across. But Harry had no idea what that was.
Every time he remembered the tears in Harry’s eyes the day he turned him down, he wanted to cry himself. Was it cruel to find love in Harry after hurting him?
. Harry didn’t feel bad about returning the favour. A shock of deep purple, almost black hair drew his attention. The length covered most of his eyes and was jaggedly cut. Piercings covered both ears, there was too many to count and some of the shapes were unique—his favourite was a bat mid-flight.
“I’ve already destroyed the wards. I will dismantle this place brick by brick until all that’s left is the foundation that was built on the suffering of Magical Creatures. What of your castle then?”
Nott backed up, eyes narrowed, and wand pointed at Draco who tilted his head before snapping a finger making Nott’s wand crack right down the middle before it disintegrated. That was enough for Greyback to run out of the room, the front door slamming shut, the noise echoing around the silence of the room.
“I don’t think you came here for a lesson in Dark Magic,” Draco said before he de-summoned his tools.
If he wanted, Draco could snatch his arm back and leave. Potter might be strong, but so was he. The real question was did he want to?
