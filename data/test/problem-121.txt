"Just call me Steve. Can I ask a huge favor?"
They nodded and made their way out of the Jet, the door closing behind them.
Potter scanned through the file. It was just basic facts about him and the DNA test results that matched him to the 1970 London blood.
Before Harry could stop himself from saying anything else, he was splashed with a glass of water. But his Polyjuice potion was wearing off. It was water from the Thief's Waterfall, the waterfall in Gringotts Bank that washed away any enchantments on whoever or whatever it hits.
“With red hair and hand-me-down robes?” Draco jokingly scoffed, “Must be a Weasley.”
An owl came tapping at his window and he tilted his head. He opened it and took the letter from it's beak, watching it fly away. He looked down and his stomach churned as he saw it was from Hermione. He opened it after taking a deep breath and grimaced, preparing to be scolded like Pansy and his mother had done.
His thighs were nice too. They were firm and muscular from all those years of riding broomsticks in Quidditch. One had to have strong thigh muscles for a sport like that as it was a lot like horseback riding and required muscles that most people don’t use in their daily life. His thighs were slightly bulging in his pants and that’s when Harry lost it. Never before had Harry felt the desire to bite another person. He was overcome with the strange desire to put his mouth on Draco’s thighs and he wasn’t quite sure why. He ended up dropping his book and he didn’t even notice when it hit the table.
Pansy Parkinson.
Harry did as he was told and felt the cool metal hit just outside of his shirt. The necklaces were simple chains of silver with a single rosebud at the end, carved in a great amount of detail. It wasn't too big, but it was just enough to catch eyes.
"At least we still have my flat we can run away to on weekends." Draco reminded with a small smirk.
Harry only shrugged in response. “He said I could borrow them. I’ve worn them before.” He found nothing strange with him wearing Draco’s clothes.
Draco’s biggest worry was that he was going to lose his mother.
"Because the other one is a lawyer." He said it as if it was obvious. When he saw the blank stare Draco sent him, he realized the other wasn't going to get it, so he explained himself. "Draco, people with important jobs, they tend to be more submissive. CEOs, subs. Lawyers, subs. Politicians, subs. People who work in a position where they have a lot of control and power, are submissive in sex. But a photographer, someone will less control, more likely to be a dom."
The Minister greeted him with a smile, which he took as a good sign. “Please, take a seat, Potter.”
It was nearly a week into break when Draco finally realized that Harry was gonna work himself to death when he should be taking time to relax.
The winter term was winding down to an end, and everyone was excited for Christmas. The latest “prank” had actually been sort of adorable. The Weasley boys, and Scorpius and James, managed to hang mistletoe around the campus. It would announce whenever two people walked under it and would trap them there until they kissed. Thankfully, they also charmed it to accept kisses on the cheek since they didn’t actually want to force two strangers to kiss.
He was quite cross with the entire situation surrounding Lucius Malfoy. The man had given up the names of so many Death Eaters, that all charges against him were dropped since he helped Wizengamot and the Aurors bring the last of Voldemort’s followers to justice. Of course Harry understood the importance of bringing the others to justice, but he hated that Lucius got off without penalty. So yes, Harry, who doesn’t even drink, kept some good wine, just to be an arse.
“Yea.” He mumbled his agreement, looking up at Draco from where his head laid on the table. “Stop making me fall for you.”
One day, while they were in a quiet conversation as to not bother their studying peers, Seamus blurted out, “Merlin Harry, why didn’t you tell us you were rich?”
Two months later and someone finally noticed the silver band on Draco’s finger, with a diamond on it cut to look like a rose. He shrugged and said he was married.
When she gave them the keys, Harry smiled and thanked her. But he wanted to do so much more. He was ecstatic that he could see Teddy anytime, but more than that he felt a sense of purpose. He felt like he had been handed they keys to Teddy's life, he felt like by having these keys he could be there for Teddy. He felt like they were a family.
“Filthy peasant.” He threw back.
While they shopped, they were eventually spotted by some paparazzi.
He continued down until he got to Draco’s hips. He used his fingertips to trace teasing patterns around Draco’s most sensitive flesh, all while speeding up and tightening his grip slightly around his length.
Draco didn’t know what to do or say. He was honored that Harry wanted to share, he was regretful that he ever tried following his dad’s footsteps, but most of all he felt like he finally understood just how broken Harry was. Or at least, he was beginning to understand.
Since he was off Hogwarts grounds, Draco was wearing what he would consider “street clothes”. It was a sharp contrast from Harry. He does a slightly sheer, light brown shirt with a deep v-neck. It showed off his chest and what was covered could still be slightly seen. His dress pants were white and his shoes were deep green, of course. He looked absolutely delicious and the photographers were eating it up.
"Now we're in the waiting game. His fall is inevitable." Harry declared with a smile.
Luna and Pansy both told Draco he needs to make a move since Harry is obviously in love with him. Pansy went as far as to tell Draco that if he didn’t confess to Harry, she was gonna slip him a truth potion because she’s “not going to spent the rest of the year dealing with your bullshit, Malfoy!”
Instead, after they sat down, they were met with an exasperated Neville. “Lads, you’re killing us. You’ve been in love with each other since third year, you both said you wouldn’t ask the other out cause there was a war, now there isn’t one, you need to do something about your feelings before we all kill ourselves.”
Harry only nodded, far too embarrassed to speak. His chest was lighting up with excitement and his heart raced from to their closeness. Harry could feel warmth radiating off of Draco and he could smell the other's cologne. That alone shot his nerves and stirred up a thrill within himself that he hadn't felt in a long time. His body was filled with sparks and he could feel the way his own heart pounded inside of his chest. For some mortifying reason he wanted to take deeper breaths, he wanted to take in the smell of Draco's pompous French cologne that he used to hate so much. But now, the hints of rose oil and lemongrass made him feel like his legs could give out at any moment.
And Harry only mumbled, "Good for her."
“I saw it too.” Dean added, “He was only a little too slow. He nearly touched it.”
"What?" Harry got up and went into the bathroom with Draco on his heels. He looked and saw that his scar was no longer the angry red hat looked as if a child had drawn it on. Instead, it had healed into raised white skin, that had thinned a bit and tapered off into something that looked a lot more like real lightening. "I ought to get a haircut." It looked mature and just a bit intimidating. It wasn't something he was ashamed enough to hide anymore. Maybe it was time he embraced that part of himself and everything it represented. It sucked, but it happened, and now it was over.
Usually his birthday parties would be planned weeks in advance. They would be at the Manor, filled to the brim with people, a giant cake and nearly a hundred presents, relatives and friends competing to see who could get Draco the best gift and therefore prove how close they are to the Malfoy family, house elves losing their minds trying to keep up with the demanding guests, girls fawning over him, a few boys in the back who knew they’d have him when no one was looking, a ball with fancy dress and formal dance, everyone keeping up appearances and acting in good taste, and everything as prim and proper as always. He wanted his nineteenth birthday to be nothing like that.
It sent him right back to their dance at the Yule Ball. A hand on his lower back and in his, held so close, a collarbone under his cheek, neck so close to his lips, bodies pressed together, an atmosphere of their own, music twisting and moving them, Draco leading, letting himself go, release, then to their night on the couch. Grinding, panting, moans, those beautiful noises, the way his body felt, being thrown down, nearly pinned, rubbed and kissed.
He didn’t hear McGonagall demand that everyone back away from him, he didn’t realize a majority of the student body of Hogwarts were crowded against the walls of the hall, staring at him.
“Ah, unimportant then.”
That shut Draco up pretty fast.
Draco looked at him with a shocked expression and flushed cheeks. "In front of all these people, including the press?" It wasn't very wise and they both knew this, but somehow, neither cared.
She wiped her eyes and shook her head. “Astoria Greengrass.” She sniffled out the name. “She’s in St. Mungo’s in a coma, they don’t know when she’ll wake up.”
- - - - -
Seamus got the magazine back and began to flip to the bachelor’s list that the paragraph on Harry mentioned. He let out a chuckle, “You’re number one on the Bachelors list, Harry. Neville, you’re here too as an honorable mention due to rumors about you and an Abbott girl.” He grinned.
“Really? You want to test that theory? I had no problem hurting you before.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You already want to do that again?”
Harry’s lips parted from shock and he shifted a bit, his legs never having been this spread open before. But somehow it wasn’t uncomfortable. He looked up at Draco and shifted again, feeling strangely intimidated. He blinked a few times to shake off the arousal and coyness buzzing in his head. “Please do.”
do it again. I’ll be fine.” Harry looked around and handed Draco the cup that was brought with his dinner. “Have some water.”
He scrambled to send out a letter, saying he would take part in the lawsuit case.
They arrived and Draco immediately flopped on the bed while Harry unpacked. He was about halfway through his trunk when Draco spoke up.
"Do not say it's okay. It isn't, and we both know this. I crossed a line. I said something that I, it ..... it still shocks me! I attacked you over something you can't help, I just ..... " He stared up at the ceiling and blinked away any tears that threatened to spill out. He’d stressed himself out just by talking about it. "We can't do this anymore."
Neville chuckled, “Oh come on, Ron, you’re good at it too. It just, it makes sense to me. I’ve got a niche for it I suppose.”
“Hi, Mr. Potter. I really don’t mean to bother you, but I’m with The Daily Prophet and I was wondering if you could answer just a few questions on the lawsuit between Mrs. Gilstrap and Mr. Strode?”
He switched to the other side and decided to take it a bit more seriously. Rather than kissing around, he tried to seek out where Harry liked it best. The search took him up and towards the front of Harry's neck. A groan escaped Draco when the hand in his hair tightened from a few kisses he placed between the corner of Harry's jaw and his ear. The body in his hands squirmed while letting out a trembling gasp.
“Sorry.” Harry cringed a bit. He didn’t like when adults shouted at him. Although he couldn’t hear it, he felt it in the way he read Prongs’ words.
Nevertheless, it was too late for Harry to change what was about to happen. He felt his release wash over him like a powerful wave and he panicked. He knew he was gonna be loud and in his moment of clarity, he made the decision to bite Draco’s shoulder to shut himself up. He managed silence for a few seconds before the throes of pleasure reached their full intensity and he was forced to cry into his lover’s shoulder. Though he made sure not to bite hard.
bet your arse that you aren’t as pathetic as me when you cum, and
“Yes?”
He approached her after lunch, seeming nervous and uncertain. “Hey Pansy. Uh, I was wondering if I could talk to you for a minute?”
Harry couldn't see it, but James had his arms crossed and eyes squinted, still not completely convinced that Draco deserved his son. But after some heavy consideration, he finally had his judgement.
They spent the rest of the night getting drunk, eating gingerbread, and teasing each other. Between the fire, necklaces, and wine, the snow outside meant nothing and the two couldn’t have been warmer in the middle of winter.
“Not really, no. They all look the same. I just don’t want something very thin, but not too wide either.”
“And you protected her while she was there. No excuses, come on.”
Draco laughed at his surprise. “Yes, Harry. In fact, most of my books contain inappropriate scenes. Anyways, my fifth book is about a dragonologist and a healer who work at the same sanctuary. Yes, I’m into the dragonologist, and it’s mostly comprised of naughty scenes. Try not to act too scandalized. It’s called Dark Scales and Slitted Eyes.”
They all knew that he was speaking from personal experience, but that isn't what was bothering Astoria. She decided to shift the subject in a gentle way since she didn't want to invalidate his point. "I suppose. I think I'm also a bit disappointed that no one came for me. All my old friends and my family. Daphne's the only one who ever showed." She mumbled a bit, almost sounding embarrassed.
“I could listen to you insult me all day.”
Draco smirked, “Need to wank?” He teased.
He gave a smile. “Thank you. That really means a lot to me.”
“Harry.” The blonde whined, “Just kiss me or something.”
“Come on, Draco. We need to find the table Hermione got for us. We can bring Pansy.” He suggested, a bit nervous. He wasn’t sure why, but he felt highly uncomfortable with where he was and wanted to find his friends and sit down. Of course, it wasn’t due to Draco or Pansy, he just felt really weird. Maybe he did have a problem with crowds? Or maybe it was the loud music? He wasn’t sure but it felt like shopping for Christmas decorations all over again.
“Never did, and it never grew on me. I hate it.”
“But what about when you were with Ginny?”
my idea. He had the leadership skills of a sheep so I told my friend to write about how we’re worried about his opposition, so people would read about it and fall behind him, making him a faction leader we could knock down whenever we wanted. Poor thing really thought he was in control.” He almost smiled. “I used Greenwood to end him. I’d given him favorable jobs, like Pawk’s bill, which I also leaked to give him good press, in order to keep him indebted to me. That allowed me to use him to dig up Luther’s crimes. He’s very useful.”
Harry nodded and stared at the papers a moment before growing a small smile. "Can you get me copies of these?"
Harry’s mouth opened to defend himself, but then he realized Draco was right. “Merlin, what if it does happen again? Oh shit.”
Draco let a soft smile take over his face. “Harry, you can’t possibly tell me your insecure. I’ve seen you in your boxer-briefs. Believe me when I say
“Ah, here he is. Potter, won’t you tell these blokes that this media nonsense is already over. I doubt Pawk was behind the slight on Crow’s reputation, and even if she was, it’s over now.” The man was confident that he was right.
“I accidentally wrote a poem about how beautiful Draco is, and then when I was talking to him I accidentally went off on a tangent about how beautiful he is, and I think I accidentally flirted with him and I’m such a fucking mess I don’t know what to do.”
Harry slowly came out of the bathroom and Draco let his eyes take in the sight.
Harry, on the other hand, was noticeably embarrassed. “Stop staring.” He said softly. If his hands were free he would be covering his face.
The Head Warlock almost looked confused but kept his mostly-neutral expression. "What crime?”
Draco wasn’t lying when he said he’d learned self-control. He could go the entire session without responding or making a sound. But he didn’t want to. He wanted Harry to know how good he felt. He knew Harry needed it. So what if he lost the bet, losing just means he gets to ride away Harry’s virginity, it’s a win-win situation for him.
“I don’t care. I want to sleep with you and I do what I want.”
“It means I don’t want to be a spoon. Period.”
“I was not!”
“Did he mention you’re dismissed from your regular duties for the next week? Because a week from today we need to have a rough plan.”
Tense was an understatement when describing the atmosphere between the two boys, but it also wasn’t quite right. Tense has quite a negative connotation, and although it perfectly describes how Harry and Draco feel when they see each other, it doesn’t convey how hot the room gets with them both in it.
Draco had to put down the knife so it didn’t accidentally slip from how much the question threw him off. “What?”
“You’d better shut it before I cash in the bet you lost. Then you’ll have nothing to tease me about.” Harry snapped.
Draco was taken aback. "You
Draco went pale, as if he wasn’t already. “What?”
“No matter what you end up doing, know I still expect an heir. But surrogacy or not, make sure the mother is of good blood. I believe one of the Abbot girls is open to working in surrogacy for couples who can’t produce, I’m certain she’ll take you on. A few Greengrass girls are in the business too.”
Harry only shot a small smile that bordered on sly and genuine. "No one was meant to."
He thought it was funny, albeit a little lame.
“Of course. It was at Hogwarts, just before we were taken in to be sorted. He tried to be friends with me, but in the process, he acted like a wanker and insulted my friend, so I declined.” Manners weren’t Harry’s priority at the moment. He knew what he wanted to say, his only concern was getting it all out there. Not only for Wizengamot to hear, but the press as well.
"Worry not, it's safe. You'll see it again, eventually, on me."
“Don’t, I was the one who agreed to do it.”
"Yes, everyone is meant to spend Christmas morning in their own homes, then we all come together for the afternoon to exchange gifts and have lunch. I'm quite excited." She tilted her head, knowing the change wasn't so spur-of-the-moment. She also knew that there was a reason Harry brought it up. "I assume the change was your doing, then?"
But they needed it.
Harry frowned, “I don’t see how anyone can do that to their own child.” He hated how Draco was being treated by his father. He acted as if their relationship didn’t matter at all to him and it disgusted Harry.
Harry nodded, “Alright, I’ll talk to her.”
Harry nodded. "You make a lot of little expressions, and you mouth the words, I also like how you look so focused after a while. It's just cute."
"All in favor of dismissing Harry James P-" The Head Warlock cut himself off before making a correction. "Harry James Malfoy-Potter, of any and all suspicion in regards to the charges of being involved in the attacks on Astoria Greengrass and most especially, Draco Malfoy, therefore revoking his status as a suspect?"
“Their nature is quite inappropriate for teenagers and children.”
Teddy laughed and then reached for Harry. He hesitated a moment before picking up Teddy and setting him in his lap. He wasn’t used to babies and wasn’t sure how to bond Teddy, but he tried his best. Teddy leaned back against him, unable to completely balance himself enough to sit up. Harry got him up straight and kept an arm around him. “How’s that? Better?”
When they arrived at Hogwarts, the castle looked mostly the same. There was still a bit of rubble, but it was in good shape considering what happened.
Draco glared. He was overcome with a mix of embarrassment and shame. His entire life he never had books for someone like himself, and now that he did, they were being made fun of. Not to mention they were one of he only things that made him feel better about the situation he was in, even though they teased him about a concept of love that he would never know.
When the first day of June arrived, Harry ate breakfast, went to take his Transfiguration exam, had lunch, and then was off to his Charms exam.
“I thought you had a hard time asking for things?” Draco commented with a smirk as he undid the button and slowly pulled down the zipper.
Of Harry, two things were always true. First, that he never had trouble falling asleep. Second, that his dreams were always so mundane that they might as well have happened in real life. But tonight was wildly different.
He went to the back room and found Harry sitting on his bed.
A smirk washed over Draco’s face and he pushed Harry back onto the bed. “I’ve been waiting so long to get to see you cum again.” It was true. With every orgasm Harry’s given him, he’s thought about getting to give Harry another.
“Ah, desperate for any inch of skin.” She teased. “Draco loves it when you wear his jumpers. Loves it so much he said he wants to shag you one day while you wear it.”
When Draco saw Harry was working away, he glared, setting the food down. “Working. Really? You’re working when you just got thrown across campus.”
The night could have been perfect, if not for what happened after they went home.
The blonde shrugged, “I don't see why not. We are married; we ought to be on a first name basis.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Love wasn’t a competition. Not inherently. But now that Harry has made it a competition, Draco had to win.
“We could shop, I suppose.” He was more afraid of how the tabloids would react to Harry and Draco going out to eat together.
As for the House of Malfoy, Harry had a hard time deciding on what to do with them. Part of him wanted to leave them alone and have no more dealings with them, but by the same token, he wanted to fuck them over. He could take the roof over their heads or the clothes off their backs. He could take everything and leave them with nothing but an empty home. Instead, he settled for a few pieces of furniture. It wasn’t even furniture from the Manor, but some items from other properties that the Malfoy family owned. Harry did, however, decide to take a good portion of the wine cellar, knowing how important it was to Lucius.
Harry speculated about his upcoming job as a professor and Draco talked about his unofficial internship with Madam Pomfrey. They talked about grades, classes, finals, their friends, everything.
Draco agreed and then chuckled, “I shouldn’t of been so dismissive of Muggle and halfblood culture. You lot have some good tastes.”
It was suppose to be simple, easy, and it had no room for what he wanted, so his wants were simply cast aside.
“Mmm, hm.” Harry moaned softly into his pillow. It was whiny and desperate. He was softly panting and his hips went a bit faster, every exhale was a soft grunt. Even in his sleep he couldn’t stay quiet. It was too easy to give in.
Draco was very familiar with the way Harry’s eyes moved and knew what he wanted to do. He wanted it too. “You want to kiss me.” It was a statement, rather than a question, but it demanded an answer all the same.
Although Draco didn't expect to get anything, as his mother was technically the heir, she asked him to come along because she didn't want to go alone.
“Are you sad?”
Draco looked down and saw it. “You can’t tell me you don’t enjoy this, Potter. Argue all you want, but your body says something else.”
Harry tossed his towel aside and closed his door, finally. He decided to put on lotion before he got down to business so his skin didn’t dry from the shower. As excited as he was, he couldn’t resist the thrill that came from a bit more teasing.
Epione nodded and gave a soft smile. "Right, don't pick him."
Alas, physical touch seemed to mean about as much as quality time and words of affirmation. It was special, and appreciated, but it wasn’t as effective as gifts and acts of service.
Harry’s lips parted and he blushed darkly. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He didn’t know it was possible to feel so physically and emotionally pleased, but he was. It was everything he could ever want.
“No! Harry, we agreed that you were going to go to bed early.”
Draco wasted no time and ended up tackling Harry, who yelped in response. Harry ended up rolling them over and pinning Draco down in an act of panic and self-defense.
Harry took the hint and started talking. “Well Teddy, I don’t know about you but I’ve had an absolutely atrocious morning. I was fast asleep in my bed, and suddenly, a blonde flopped down on me and demanded I wake up so we could come see you. I reasoned with the oaf and we fell asleep again. I woke up, awoke the oaf, and then the oaf had go to through a ridiculous hair and skin treatment. Then he insults me and we come here. I know what you’re thinking, Draco’s a complete tosser. Don’t worry, I already told him for you because I knew you would want me to.”
Harry smirked. "Ah, so you've always been in love with me. The pretty little posh boy falling for the rugged bad boy, how terrible. I might ruin you." He teased.
They all parted ways in the Station. Ron and Hermione to their house, Luna to meet up with Rolf, Pansy to her new flat, Dean and Seamus to their’s, Neville to find Hannah, and Harry and Draco to their new home.
Harry broke down laughing.
"What
There was something so pure about the way Harry whined and shook through the pleasure. It was so innocent and overwhelmed, and Draco couldn’t help but to enjoy watching.
The warm water tore a groan from Harry’s mouth. He quickly washed his hair and body, hoping that maybe his problem would just go away. But instead, his tip was resting against his lower stomach by the time he was finished.
“Goodnight, Draco. I love you.” He mumbled with closed eyes.
Draco raised an eyebrow, amused by how little control Harry had over his dragons. "What do they want?"
His anger threatened to burst through as he was made to speak and shake hands with more people, two things he very much didn’t want to do. All he wanted was to leave, but he couldn’t until the Head Warlock ended the meeting. Fear rose within him and eventually overcame even the frustration. A dull ache settled in his head and a desperation introduced itself to his emotional cocktail of anxiety and anger, fear and frustration. He was so desperate to leave. Why was this taking so damn long? Why couldn't be just be normal? And with that, self-loathing was also thrown in to the mix.
Harry let out a breath that he didn't realize he was holding and Hermione wordlessly wrapped her arms around him. Some might have clapped for their victory, but Harry couldn't hear any of it. Greenwood might have patted him on the back and said a few words, but Harry was numb to it all.
Of course, James couldn’t resist making a joke.
“Is there anyone here who
Harry noticed and elaborated a little further, “Draco was a bully to me and my friends. But he wasn’t a bully because he’s just an ass, he was a bully because that’s what he was taught to be. Every child wants to grow up and become someone that their family approves of, being the child of a Death Eater and surrounded by blood-purists didn’t give him a good start. My point is, Draco didn’t have a choice in who he became, he can’t be blamed for it because he was only trying to please his family.” Harry tilted his head, “And even so, what crimes has he really committed? He hesitantly took the Dark Mark to please his father, and at his absolute worst, he proved to be a mild inconvenience. He never really did much to hurt or stop us. He’s committed no real crimes.”
“No. Not yet. I’ll do it when we’re officially together, so I can do
Demgass quickly changed their surname, looking absolutely terrified of Harry, but he wasn't the only one. Narcissa and Draco also seemed afraid of Harry's display, but for very different reasons. They were afraid for Draco's sake.
"Of course I do." Harry responded.
“Yea. I-I feel like .....” He trailed off, wanting to be honest but not sure how. He decided to let everything spill out. It was about time he told someone. “It hurts Hermione. It really does. We’re so close, I wake up in the same bed as him, we lay so close, we talk about everything, he makes me so happy, he’s so lovely. But he isn’t mine. And that hurts. I never knew I could hurt like this before.”
Harry smirked and tilted his head. “Oh? And Draco’s weren’t? Let me reiterate what exactly, his crimes were. He hesitantly received the Dark Mark to please his father and at his worst he was a mild inconvenience. Other than that, he protected Hogwarts students hundreds of times, especially halfblood and muggleborn students. He personally protected the very people that Voldemort wanted dead. He was necessary to the wellbeing and survival of muggleborn and halfblood students at Hogwarts, and now you want to throw him in Azkaban? Draco Malfoy is a hero.”
Harry peeled his eyes opened and looked up to see Draco was looking down at him, ocean eyes full of love, soft blonde air, the golden sun shining through their curtains. Harry was in awe.
Harry grinned, “Ha! Even
Draco, meanwhile, almost choked on his tea. He assumed that Harry would end up touching himself as he knew Harry hasn't gotten off in about a year. Still, he didn’t expect sound to carry so well behind closed doors.
The meal was simple and he returned to Narcissa with two servings of beans and rice. They ate in silence and a simple spell was used to take care of the dirty dishes.
With the Ministry changing for the better and his father running out of law books to consult, Draco was lulled into a sense of security. As if everything would be alright. Still, there was a doubt that wouldn’t leave him. He felt like his father would still manage to find a way. A way to get back at him, Harry, and maybe even Narcissa for ruining Voldemort's plans.
"I know what it's like to be attracted to a close friend."
Now the blonde scoffed. “Sod off. You’re acting like you have amnesia.”
The third piece of good news came just hours before he was to leave to vote on the bill.
Draco’s hair had somehow gotten blonder, he actually was a bit taller, more muscular, and he somehow managed to dress even more lavishly than he did growing up.
Draco and Harry return to their dorm from their days out, and of course, one of them just can’t keep it in his pants.
Harry knew that Ron had informed them of his new life as the redhead had asked before hand and Harry said it was alright. They deserved to know and he trusted they wouldn’t tell anyone. “Yea. It, uhm, it isn’t terrible. Draco really isn’t that bad. I’d like for us to be friends.”
Harry looked surprised to say the least. He tensed up a bit but hugged her back. Something about the hug felt so genuine and caring, as if, somehow, they were family. She thanked him for taking care of Draco and then took her leave.
The blonde looked up at the unmarked flesh and put on a soft smirk. In that moment, he decided that one day, he’d make a mess of it.
He didn’t want to grow old, he didn’t want death to creep onto him, he chose to die in the war, he chose death. Now he would have to wait.
“Writers block.” His smile dropped in an instant and he looked a mix of serious and upset over his problem.
It was decided that for now, nobody besides Harry and Draco were to know the true identities of the Marauders, and nobody beyond Ron and Hermione were to know about the map. There were no arguments, and they all found that decision to be for the best.
Harry gave a nod. “Indeed. First, I’d like to say congratulations on your promotion! I’m very happy for you. You deserve it.”
The rush of emotion made him fall onto his knees. He screamed, causing the power he absorbed to be let out, smashing everything to pieces, the windows, the walls, everything.
The two hugged and Draco grinned at the sight of his mother.
No one said anything, but everyone felt bad for him. It was quite shocking to find out their friend hadn’t smiled in nearly a year. It made them all rethink their interactions with Harry to try to find a smile. There wasn’t one.
Harry raised an eyebrow. He found Draco’s threat to be completely meaningless. “I don’t think you can make me relax.”
Teddy fell to his knees and covered his own mouth, his eyes squinting as he teared up. He hated seeing his dad in so much pain.
Draco’s jaw dropped.
“Draco, c’mon. You’ve taking forever! You’re worse than a girl!” Harry called out from the sitting room, where he had thrown himself across the sofa, waiting.
He researched the ways different Muggle governments went about it and saw a lot of overlap. The overlap was copied and pasted directly into the document while other topics had to be debated and ironed out by Harry and Hermione.
“Come on.”
Draco had also picked up a habit that completely bewildered Harry.
They turned around and he caught up. “Is Harry alright?” He asked.
Harry shrugged and looked over at his fiance with a smirk. "Oh, it did. I just didn't want to admit it."
Draco tilted his head. "But what do you want?"
Draco felt a strange mix of happiness and sadness. He was absolutely elated that Harry would do something like this for him. But he was saddened because he knew the only reason Harry knew how to cook was because he was made to growing up. He had to remind himself that Harry did this because he wanted to and not because he had to.
He got a few looks of sympathy, but others were fuming. They couldn't understand how anyone could do this to their own son. For a moment, he felt as if they were angrier at Lucius than he had ever been.
Harry didn’t even look up, “I never went to sleep.” He said it as if it didn’t even matter. “I’m already on V. There’s a good bit on Vampires and Veelas, but there’s also a lot about the veil and voids.” It seemed he was only interested in discussing the subject matter of his books. He couldn’t care less about sleeping.
They found themselves silent, just laying with each other, slowly drifting to sleep.
The next year, in the summer after Teddy’s fourth birthday and after years of conversation and thought, Draco had his heir.
“How was I suppose to know that?”
“You, Malfoy, and Longbottom.”
Harry’s noises were soft and desperate. His hips occasionally jerked as electricity rushed down his spine. “Okay! I’m pathetic! I’m absolutely pathetic, Draco.”
He cracked a smile. “I mean your knees.”
And his pleas were answered.
“Apparently,” he began quite awkwardly, “with the use of such old property laws, the goblins of Gringotts have looked into old legislation for a legal solution, and have decided that the only legal answer is the implementation of the right of conquest.”
“I hate you, Potter.”
Unfortunately, Draco was still oblivious of Harry’s feelings.
“Looks like I need to find a new one, because after Hogwarts, I’ll have to be on my own.” He sighed as he began to wonder about what kind of home he would like to live in. He still had access to his family's vault and was certain they wouldn't mind if he used some money to find himself a place to live.
He also wasn't blind. He saw the way the elite tried to manipulate and bribe newer members into joining their side. He also saw the way they panicked at the changes in the political climate. All these newer people no longer tolerated bribery over morals. They couldn't be swayed and the elite didn't know what to do anymore. They were afraid because they knew they were losing. This would become an important battle to them and they'll be desperate for a win, which is why Harry can't afford to play nice, not this time. He had his morals and his rules, there were lines he wouldn't cross, but right now, he was prepared for a fight.
That made Harry quickly move to look Draco in the eyes. "What?" The shock of the suggestion wore off when he saw how close Draco's bluish-grey eyes and satisfied smile were. His own lips parted as his eyes glanced to the stretched ones before him. They were so close and he wanted to. But he couldn't. Not yet.
That comment went straight between Harry’s legs. He twitched in his pants and then sat up, getting under his duvet. “That is highly inappropriate.”
. The Auror who arrested and processed him only stared at it before looking back at him, his silence asking a million questions.
“McGonagall is going to try to get my mother to come to the school this weekend so I can talk to her.”
The day had started off so loving and normal that he almost didn’t know how everything had gone so wrong so fast.
The blonde raised an eyebrow. Now that the serious part was done, it was time for fun. "Ah, that still leaves so much to be done. So you wouldn't mind if one day I tied you to the bed?"
Teddy tried to go for the glasses again, but Harry quickly distracted him with one of his toys. A rattle shaped like a wand. Cute.
Harry pulled Draco closer and buried his face in the back of Draco’s head. He shifted a bit and pressed his bare chest to the silk of Draco’s pajamas. Closing his eyes and taking in Draco’s scent, he knew he could lay there forever. It felt right.
It took him a moment to register his own dismissive comment and he blinked in surprise. It was as if he had just realized who he was and what he had done. "'Mione? Do you think we might have become sort of shitty people?" He delivered the question in a slow and hesitant manner, as if he wasn't quite sure what he wanted to say.
Harry tilted his head and shrugged, “Fair enough. Well I need to go, almost time for DADA, but I’ll see you lot again soon.”
Draco noticed too.
“There, five minutes and no more, just like you said. Your rib’s fine now and your arm needs just another week in the cast.”
Harry couldn’t help but to smile. “I think he’d like to. I also think he’ll appreciate the sweater. Thank you, Molly.” He said before wrapping her in a hug. Much to his dismay, he was only slightly taller than her. In fact, he even feared Ginny would catch up to him as she was a tad taller than Molly.
Harry was the first to come home, which is what he intended. He remembered that Draco had once mentioned a traditional Christmas dinner and he planned to deliver, though in secret. He started by checking on the pudding and seeing it still needed about two more hours, adding a bit more water to the saucepan. He had a turkey thawing in the fridge that he drained of juices and patted dry. He put it in a roasting pan, seasoned it, shoved a meat thermometer into its thigh, and put it in the oven when it finished preheating. He then hurried to the pantry and pulled out potatoes that he planned on roasting. He chopped them up and let them sit in olive oil and a collection of herbs. With that sitting, he checked on the pudding once more, then the turkey. Sat on the counter was also cranberry sauce from a can, since he didn’t have the patience to actually make it. There were also brussel sprouts, but he had plenty of time before he needed to cook them.
“Are you worried it’ll happen again?”
Harry glared again but this time his cheeks were pink. “Shut up, Malfoy.” He taunted, but they both knew what he really meant. When one referred to the other by their surname, it always sparked a bout of friendly teasing and argument. Mocking their younger selves and their old bickering.
“I know.”
McGonagall trusted him and Harry would never intentionally break that.
“Haven’t I?” Harry asked, tilting his head. “Were you there, by my side, for the entirety of my journey? Can you really attest to the things I may or may not have done?”
"I wouldn't mind if you never let me go."
ABBA came on next.
Harry’s smile dropped and he raised his eyebrows in shock. He hadn’t even known that about himself.
“I don’t quite know. I didn’t take any offense to what you said, I just really wanted to hit you. Might be something to do with your face.” He taunted, but of course he wasn't serious.
Harry will never stop. He had already decided that even in his older years, he’ll tell Ron all about how he regrets never sleeping with his brothers. Assuming he never actually does.
He turned around and was faced with Epione Pawk, one of the newer members of Wizengamot. In truth, she was one of his only acquaintances because she was a lycanthrope, and most of the lycanthropes in Wizengamot made a point of introducing themselves to thank him for what he's done.
"But who? I won't tell anyone!"
"Magical legend says you told him hours before he died. Supposedly, he became mad at you for it after ten years of knowing each other, you didn't tell him your biggest secret. But, considering he was dying, he got over it and didn't order you to be executed. In Muggle, er, non magical legend, he always knew you had magic. You were a Court Sorcerer. Even Uther knew you had magic as you helped him with magical things occasionally." Harry recalled, "But... In my opinion, you should tell him. Believe me, I know a thing or two about losing people, and you don't want to leave this up until his deathbed. Keeping secrets from someone after they're dead is the worst. My godson never told his crush that he like him until he was impaled by Thanos, even though we could've saved him, he was dusted. You should probably also tell him about your feelings for him."
When the cuts healed, Harry took a deep breath and looked at Draco, "You bloody idiot. You should've told me you were under attack."
"Harry." His godfather said, crouching down next to him.
"What about the boy?"
"He called me the Master of Death. I know that's a common thing between us, we all know about it. But no one from the Wizarding World knew it, and obviusouly not Mordred. Plus, he called Draco my consort. I'm assuming you know what a consort is."
Draco and Natasha were the only ones to drink.
"And do you mind if I look around your mind a bit to confirm this?"
A couple seconds later, Draco's eyes shot open while gasping for air. "Fuck. I forgot how terrible that feels."
"Where are you going?" Draco asked, standing up and walking over.
Harry nudged Draco slightly and whispered, "Calm down, Dray. It's fine. Don't think about it."
There were groans heard throughout the room. Draco and Harry just laughed.
"Great! Now that you two are done with your lovers quarrel, Merlin is over here still kinda dying!"� Teddy yelled. He had already tried all the healing spells he knew and nothing held for more than a couple minutes. "FRIDAY?"
"FRI, tell Sev that he's free to come in. There's no trouble here."
Everyone collectively looked up and saw Tony standing there with Pepper and a baby girl in her arms.
"You forget Life and Death are one with each other. One cannot exist without the other. To kill so many living creatures at once would bring a state of chaos in between the balance. You told me once that you feel all the deaths happening all at once. After he snapped, what did that feel like?"
"Yes, well, Harry you should get back to the castle. If you're keeping up the pretense that you're a Lord, the King would most likely want you to stay in the castle."
Snape watched Teddy go back to his normal appearance, except deciding to go with purple hair now before drawling, "Yes, I suppose."
Merlin dwelled. If he told her, it had a chance it wouldn't happen. But, it already happened. So, there was no point in not telling her. But, there was only six months until it happened, so she could wait. But, she wouldn't leave him alone until he told her.
"The witch is rising once more."
Malfoy was on the third floor. With no Dementors in the place anymore, Harry didn't hear any of the screaming that would normally be caused by them.
Sirius seemed like he was gonna cry, "He found someone? How is he? Well, how are they?"
"Three drops of blood on the parchment." The goblin said in a scruff voice.
Snape nodded then left the lab.
"He brought everyone back. In doing so, he risked his life. He had been in a coma for... eight weeks before he woke up. But, no one is the same after using so much magic at once. He was already the Master of Death, he became something else when he used that power. He knew everything about everyone from our world. He probably knows about this conversation. But... since Harry was in a coma, Draco was the one who patched me up."
"Queen Guinevere?" Natasha asked, stepping forward with her hands up so they could see she didn't have anything in them.
"Tony. What the hell was that?" Sirius asked.
"Harry! You went all the way to another universe to get me a present?" Severus asked. When Harry nodded, he sighed, "You're an absolute idiot."
A couple weeks after, Scorpius had finally said Daddy. Harry had started crying, as to be expected.
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"No. But he could be doing it with magic. You never know."� Tony shrugged and made his way back to the Jet.
Maybe this would be the happy ending he wanted.
Harry set him down and looked at him, "I love you so much, you know that right?" Scorp nodded. "You know how I told you I'd never leave you?" He nodded again. "Well, I might have to leave for a bit."
"Wait. I've seen that before." Steve said.
"Harry. Would you like to tell us what you found?" Severus asked.
"It's in my room. Why do you ask?"
Harry getting back on his feet was a lot easier than he expected. He had the support of his family, of course, which made everything so much bearable.
"Luna Lovegood? She's a Seer?" Sirius asked. Draco nodded. "No wonder she was always a bit off. How is she?"
"You should have killed me." The blue lady said. It seemed like her and Thanos knew each other based on the way they were speaking.
He told them about the Triwizard Tournament. He talked about the two other schools that were staying at Hogwarts for the Tournament. He told them about the Goblet of Fire and thinking that he was going to have a normal year for once. Then he said that he was mistaken when his name was pulled from the Goblet of Fire. He talked about the Defence teacher of the year, Mad Eye Moody slash Barry Crouch Jr. He talked about the dragons, mermaids, and the maze. He talked about the death of his classmate and his fellow Champion, Cedric Diggory. He also told them that he gave the winning money to Fred and George Weasley for them to start their joke shop.
"Okay, Merlin, you have an hour. Explain."
There had been no news from Clint other than he was going on a murder spree. Thor, Loki and the Asgardians who had survived created a New Asgard on Earth.
"You were one year old and had all the fame in the world. You were a spoiled child—"
Heres a quick preview:
, not
"It's actually Potter, now. And mother was very accepting of my friendship with Harry. She even encouraged me to ask him out."
"All three of them studied in a boarding school in Scotland, Potter and his husband graduated in 1998, and the boy graduated in 2008. They both went to Harvard for their college years. The husband, Draco Potter, studied medicine while Officer Potter studied law enforcement," Romanoff explained.
"Block the spell I'm gonna throw at you, okay?"
"We don't know how to wake Harry up. We've tried our medical supplies and spells provided by Draco and Severus." Natasha said.
"Of course."
"Who's this kid?" Quill asked. "He looks like he just got out of school and decided to go on watch a movie with his friends but ended up on an alien ship."
Draco leaned over to look at the photo. "Those are Harry's parents. James and Lily Potter."
Banner nodded and passed him the vial. Harry opened it and put three of the flowers inside the cauldron.
- Birdy
"And I finally snapped when Andrew Creevey shot Draco. I was arrested on sight, there was a 'arrest Harry Potter if he goes crazy' agreement or something going on. And of course, 'arrest whoever helps Harry Potter go crazy', aka, Draco. They didn't arrest Teddy because he was only ten. We were on the run for 52 years I believe it was. We faked our deaths but stupid Hugo Granger-Weasley found us and the world knew we were alive. We infiltrated the Ministry, I got caught and almost actually sent to Azkaban by Granger, but I got away, found Draco, we found Teddy on the way and jumped through the Veil, not knowing where we were gonna end up."
Teddy mustered up all his power and put it all in one word, "
"We'll figure something out. We'll always have Teddy and hopefully Sirius."
Tony threw a towel at him with a pointed look. Draco realized what he was doing and stopped scratching. He frowned at his arm but then shrugged it off.
Harry went in to hug him tightly. "You're an idiot, Draco Lucius Potter. You can't leave me."
He smiled a bit and nodded before going back to Harry, kissing his hair before intertwining their fingers.
"What do we do to calm him down then?" Steve asked.
"Bathrooms in the back." Teddy said, tossing them their clothes.
A sudden light flash caused everyone to shield their eyes. When the light disappeared a man dressed in blue and green was on the floor coughing.
As soon as he sat down, a click was heard. Then a trigger being pulled. Then a gunshot.
Thanos raised his sword, commanding his army to attack. At the same time, Steve yelled for the Avengers to go. And so they did.
"Draco, truth or dare?"
"Where is your dad?" Peter asked, not having been there when they had explained Teddy's lineage.
"I'm gonna stay here with Scorpius." Draco said.
"That was Pettigrew's fault!"
He wasn't aging which he didn't notice until about 6 years ago. It really pissed him off.
Thor stood there in all of his glory for a good couple of seconds before he charged at the large herd of creatures while yelling, "
Harry turned around and almost cried at the sight. His husband stood there in all his glory. His blonde hair, even lighter in the light of the sun. His eyes seemingly sparkling. A familiar smile placed on his lips.
"Yes, that's right. That's Arthur. Then Leon, Gwaine, Percival, Elyan and Lancelot."
"Georgie, if I have any say in anything in my world, which I do, we're going to see each other lots more times. Okay?"
"That's the plan, Tony." Harry stated. "We have 4 months to go, though. We'll start the spoiling once he's here."
Harry looked down at his wrist where the bracelet was. "I suppose." He said, enlarging it back to it's normal size and placing it on his head, like it had been the day he brought everyone back.
"He's not here." Natasha said, "Why are you looking for him?"
"Yes, but not everyone can cast one. Others, like Severus or Teddy's dad, preferred non-corporal Patronus'. You can send messages through them or fight of Dementors." Harry explained.
"Scorpius?"
Wanda, Natasha, Pepper and Hope Van Dyne (Scott's girlfriend) all helped plan the party. Sirius was helping the girls plan too, giving his advice when he felt it was needed.
"Well, I can't call you by your real name considering were out in public and anyone can recognize your name and turn you into the Ministry, since now everyone knows we're still alive."
"What?! What year was it in the Wizarding World? And what happened?"
Christmas morning—or, Yule, as they said in the Wizarding World, both new and old—had a four year old Scorpius jumping around like crazy. He was excited that he got to spend his first Christmas with his whole family back together again. Tony, Pepper and Morgan were even coming over!
"You're absolutely right, Ted."
Gwaine rose his hand. Percival elbowed his shoulder. "Ow! What? Getting tortured really takes it out of a guy."
Harry got on his horse and started to ride once the others did. Riding was actually pretty easy, compared to the other modes of transportation in the Wizarding World.
"Yes. It is only a day's flight away." Thor responded, eyes still glued on his brother.
"Probably." Neville said then stood up along with the others.
Completely disregarding what Harry said, the Cailleach spoke, "I've come with a warning."
Snape snorted. "Of course Potter would end up as Head Auror."
Arthur nodded.
Draco smiled. "He's always with you."
"Arthur, Harry and I are required to go. We can bring five people. Who do we bring?" Merlin asked. If it was up to him alone, he would bring the Knights. But he had to think about Harry and who could help keep him safe. "Draco, Harry, can I talk to both of you?"
He started stumbling, "I don't know what's -- I don't know what's happening. I don't--" He fell into Tony's arms, "I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, Mr. Stark, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go...
1. This takes place around September 4th, 2020, unlike the actual movie which is 2023.
"Yes, him. Now, spells?"
Harry just nodded and grabbed his wand to cast the Patronus.
After that, he used a simple healing spell and watched as the wound closed up. He didn't use dittany so it would scar, but looking at Merlin's exposed chest, that wasn't anything new. He used a wet towel to gently dab away the blood then used bandages to cover it up.
Vision was laying motionless on the ground. Thanos had gotten to him already. Wanda was next to him sobbing.
"He's a principal. He's on summer break now so he works on some missions with the team."
On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen." It seemed like someone responded because then T'Challa said, "On my signal."
"Yes. Now can you explain why you killed these people?"
"Master of Death."
"Probably."
"Mr Stark, guys can get pregnant?"
Once Harry knew what he had to do, he almost dropped the StarkPad he had in his hand.
." He expected to see the dragon come out of his wand, but instead nothing did. Harry's face of shock explained everything Natasha needed to know.
Draco gasped, gripping Harry's arm. "What'd he say?"
Merlin searched his brain for a spell that would wake him up. He knew spells, but he didn't know if they would work on other magical people. The only way to know was to try, right?
"And what of the students of Hogwarts? Who will be the new Headmaster?" Another reporter yelled.
Apparently his scream was loud enough to bring the attention of the other Avengers who ran over to his location.
Harry made his way over to Sirius. "Argo Pyrites. Do you recognize the name?"
Merlin just stepped aside and let the couple hold each other. Gwaine went over to Merlin and patted his back. "Good job, mate."
Elyan spoke up, "He said you would tell all of us at the same time."
Sirius sighed. "Two years, Potter. I'm gone for two years and you decide to become the Master of Death..."
Harry finally agreed to let them go, seeing as he wasn't going to leave Teddy's side.
"Understandable." She agreed.
“They’ve both confessed to us that they like each other. Over the years we’ve watched them fall deeper in love, and we’ve been trying to encourage them, but they won’t listen.”
"Of course! If you're thinking about writing then I have to do everything I can to encourage you to do it."
Harry laid in Draco’s arms and let the turmoil inside of him be slightly dulled by those warm arms. “Thank you.” A tear fell from his face and he was hit with an overwhelming feeling of relief.
Draco frowned and set his book down. “Harry, it isn’t that simple. What kind of people are you in to?” He intended to use the answer as an example of how people aren’t so simple as to like only one specific type of person.
Hermione crossed her arms, a bit annoyed. “Do you two have late night chats often?”
"Oh, please, it's just Seamus. I feel we're friendly enough for that."
Harry let out a laugh. “Your kinky spells? This again?”
He felt strangely satisfied with himself. He knew it was a bit obscene to wank to the thought of his best friend, but the inherent naughtiness made it even more exciting. He had no regrets, and if he could, he wouldn’t hesitant to make his fantasies a reality.
Harry glanced up at him and stretched. “Oh, hey. How was dinner?” The jumper rose up just enough for Draco to get a peek at Harry’s skin. His own eyes wandered to the small part of Draco's chest that he could see. He knew exactly what was going on. They were going to spend the afternoon teasing each other and he already loved it.
The second came a few days after from Greenwood. It was a full report on seven different members of Wizengamot who were still against Pawk's bill. In the report, there were multiple unsolved cases of unexplained sums of money that somehow came into their vaults in the Voldemort-era. The investigations were dropped due to a lack of evidence but in skimming the documents, Greenwood explained that there were quite a few solid theories. It's an obvious case of the crimes of Voldemort's supporters being ignored. Greenwood even offered up the names of a few different Aurors that he thought would be great for the case, if it came down to it. Harry sent back his thanks and was about to send it, but then, he didn't.
Staying up late and talking was starting to become a habit between Draco and Harry. It had slid into their lives without either of them being aware of it, it quietly became part of their routine. They never fell asleep without having a conversation that went on until some ridiculous hour of the night. But they did tend to stay in their respective beds, blaming that on the high emotions and delirium of the night.
“Oh, don’t be. I never once thought to blame you. It was my mother’s choice and my father’s pride. Nothing to do with you, really. My father was a blind follower of Voldemort and he apparently put that above his own self-preservation and family. Good thing the Malfoy line has come down to me.”
Part of his healing was reaching out to his classmates about the things he didn’t understand or didn’t know much about.
"The Cupboard Project has passed it's preliminary vote." That made most of the room smile. "Mrs. Granger and Mr. Potter, you hereby have twenty days to finish the associated laws before The Cupboard Project will have it's final vote and be presented to the Minister for approval. Wizengamot will reconvene in three days for the preliminary vote on Epione Pawk's anti-discriminatory bill."
With a bit of maneuvering, Harry found himself eye-level with Draco. His arms loose around the man who still needed to bounce. He could hardly take Draco right in his face. He tried to look away but Draco brought his face back.
When he got there, he used his thumbs to spread Harry’s cheeks open, which made the boy squirm in response to cool air in such an intimate place. His eyes flickered to his next target. Small, a tempting reddish color, quivering slightly, virginal.
McGonagall, however, wasn't in the mood. But she did keep her tone light enough for Harry not to worry about getting in trouble. “Unlike Draco, I’ll not stand for you waxing poetic about me.”
He was getting better every day, and he was so proud of his life. Pomfrey even trusted him to treat minor injuries all by himself. He’s become especially fast at bandaging people up, and he’s always been excellent at potions, so he’s even brewed a few medicines.
Two years after the birth of Scorpius, and just before Luna and Rolf had their second son, a boy was born in the cold of December.
He forced himself out of bed and struggled not to whine as he got dressed. He hurried off to Hogsmeade and made it to the florist just as the shop opened.
In canon, Draco raises a child that he doesn’t teach to dislike non-purebloods, which disappoints his parents. I took inspiration from that for Lucius and Narcissa in this work because I didn’t want them to feel like completely different characters.
Dean gave him a glare so Seamus wrapped his arms around him in a hug. It seemed like a cute couple moment, until Seamus mumbled into his ear, “Draco works the hospital wing. Let Harry be his patient.”
“Seriously, we all know you’re in love. It’s obvious and it always has been.” Hermione encouraged.
“I don’t know. I just do it.” Harry didn’t think he was reading fast, this was just his normal pace.
Harry came in only a moment later, seeming almost defeated. “Fine. You can use the spell if you want. You don’t seem as tired as you were.”
Draco listened with a dropped jaw. He spoke up when Harry finished. “Alright, I see the problem here. You’re associating stress with survival. But you don’t need to anymore. You’re alright. No one is trying to kill or hurt you, you’re going to live a peaceful life as a professor at Hogwarts, your home.”
kind of escort. Then again, I can appreciate a bit of assertiveness.” He commented as he trailed behind Harry.
“Mate, Seamus’ feelings for you are just as obvious as yours for him. Everyone knows you like each other.”
James had absolutely no advice for Harry.
Draco returned to his seat and rewrapped his scrubs, putting the clothes and the letter in his bag. Those scrubs meant the world to him, just like the silver around his wrist and Harry’s neck.
His third set of business was sending off a short letter to Greenwood, notifying him of the good news. He graciously accepted, but Harry knew how Greenwood really felt about it. He knew he made Greenwood nervous because he was putting the man in debt while he was without the influence and leverage he was used to. Harry had all the cards and he was forcing Greenwood to play his game. Really, he was forcing everyone to play his game. By tossing around favors, he got the Searcy siblings’ support, Crow and Pansy’s influence, and Greenwood’s unwavering subordination. Through charm he got Alexis Wright’s vote. With subtle manipulation he got Crow on their side, not to mention how he built up and knocked down Luther’s career and political party at will, for the premeditated purpose of eating up the opposition, one by one. He had everything at his disposal. He made the game, he gave everyone their cards, and still, he told them what moves to make. He had carefully orchestrated a dance that everyone followed flawlessly. At no point was he not in complete control. For reasons that he wasn’t proud of, he actually enjoyed his work. It was strangely fun. But he could never confess that.
“If someone feels they’re being discriminated against, they would need to gather evidence in the form of witnesses, written statements, recordings, etcetera. They have to prove it to a jury.”
Draco had to throw all his weight to get Harry on his back, but once he did, it was easy to keep him down. One leg was propped beside Draco's body, foot firmly planted on the couch, while his other foot rested on the ground. Draco's body laid between the spread legs and it gave him a phenomenal view of the tent between them. His hands kept Harry's shoulders down since he didn't feel comfortable pinning his wrists just yet. He wanted Harry to have the chance of using his arms if he wanted. Once he had Harry laying back, he moved back to sit. "If you're comfortable with this, I would quite like to rub up against you until we both ruin our pants."
Harry smiled. “That’s what I’d rather talk about, if I’m honest. But you were given an assignment and you have to report on that.” He thought a moment before asking, “Have you ever written a story from a source you had to keep anonymous?”
Harry thought a moment, “I realized I was bisexual, I don’t know, when I was a kid I guess. Girls are cute, guys are cute, it’s just whatever. As for Remus, I didn’t care. He’s only a werewolf, not like it’s that big a deal. Still just Remus.”
Harry wasn’t sure how it even happened, he’s fairly certain that Seamus has some sort of natural pyrokinetic ability that flares up sometimes. It would make sense considering the fact that he’s made things blow up before that shouldn’t of blown up. The first example that comes to mind would be the feather that he made burst into flame in their charms class. He was supposed to make it float, then suddenly, the feather was charred and Seamus’ face was covered in soot.
Not even a threat from Charlie could stop Draco's curiosity. “Those things you said. About all the laws you broke, and how you don’t feel any remorse. Is that true?”
Of course he’d always wanted a proper ceremony, but didn’t think Harry would care too much about that stuff, so he never asked. He had felt just as silly as Harry. Even more so when he realized Harry wanted the exact same thing as him.
“So good, love. You made me feel so good. Now it’s your turn, yea? Go on. Show me how good it feels.”
“I don’t want remnants of your saliva on my house, you brute.” He had no idea where the name calling was coming from, but it made Harry laugh, so he went with it. The blonde finished wiping up his own icing and went back in with thinner layers, satisfied to see his walls were finally sticking. But that gave Harry enough time to cover his roof in icing as if it were snow, and iced the windows. “How are you so fast?!” Not to say this was a competition, but it was most definitely a competition and Draco had to win.
“Edward?” Harry questioned before realized who Edward really was. “Right, I’m so used to calling him by his nickname that I forgot his real name. I’m his godfather.”
Harry was trying his hardest to take in every little bit of the moment. How soft Draco's hair was, the warmth of their bodies together, the way Draco rested his arms on top of the one around his waist. Even the sound of a pen scribbling and the blonde's occasional hum of disapproval. Especially the way he could feel his lover breath and the way he swore he could feel a heartbeat. Every little thing was just so perfect and he never wanted that to end. He wanted to soak in every little second so that he might be able to recall every sensation. He wanted to lock it all in memory and keep it there forever.
His posture straightened and mouth opened but nothing came out. He looked around and cracked another smile. “Well, uh, no. Not really.”
Maybe it was because of what Greenwood did in letting Lucius off, maybe he blamed the man for his current situation. He told himself that it was fine, it wasn't Greenwood's fault, that he isn't upset anymore and Draco is his friend, he told himself that his new friendship was thanks to Greenwood, but nothing changed the way he felt.
Seamus turned to look at Dean, “D-Do ya really like me like that?”
He looked up to see Draco had entered the sitting room, crouched slightly to see Harry sitting in the Floo.
“He’s marrying you off!” Narcissa managed to shout the words into Draco’s chest.
“Oh? What about?” He quickly asked as he followed Harry from their room, where he had been writing, to the sofa.
Twenty chapters in and it still didn’t have a proper title. Twenty-one by the time Harry gets home, and even so, all twenty, edited and completed, were being sent over to Seamus for a final review. Harry imagined the same would be done with however many chapters remained. The coupling in the book had just gotten together in chapter sixteen, though the chapters were quite long, and in Harry’s opinion, didn’t feel rushed. The only problem was that Draco wasn’t sure how to end it. The only thing the blonde was sure of was that he hadn’t wanted to end it as soon as the couple got together, as so many books did. He wanted to explore their relationship and give them a bit of a dynamic. He wanted the audience to see how they functioned as a couple, before he wrote their happily ever after. The idea being thrown around was that he was going to somehow end a significant chapter of their life, write an epilogue, and call it a day. But that was easier said than done. There were so many routes to go down. So many smaller paths to be explored. He could do a thousand things, but wasn’t sure if he had the talent to keep it going or if he should just finish it while it was good. He even considered writing a sequel, but doubted he could keep things going with these two characters.
”And they were only rumors. Probably started by the other purebloods who couldn’t believe the only heir to the House of Malfoy isn’t interested in the gender that can produce a child. As for the ball, we went as friends, and considering that boys were taught one part of the dance and girls were taught the other, there wasn't too much room for same-sex couples. She now happens to be engaged to a woman.” Draco then turned the question around. “What about you? I never heard of you being with a man.” He's heard rumors about Harry as well. About him and Cho, Ginny, and a number of other girls. There always seemed to be some girl after his affections.
Harry chuckled, “Then don’t complain. And don’t you dare complain a decade from now when you get a Howler waxing poetic about you.”
The songs melted into each other and soon they were moving in silence, realizing too late that the record had ended. Neither knew when, but they didn’t stop. They moved around the quiet sitting room, caught in a dance, enjoying the feeling of the other in their arms. It was so slow, gentle, and perfect.
They locked eyes. Draco saw a deep sadness and a cry for help while Harry saw another innocent kid who was hurt by the war.
He wanted to say more. He was very aware that he had put Greenwood through hell in their dealings and he wanted to somehow show a more sincere form of gratitude. There was so much he wanted to say and express but he wasn't sure how. Instead, he ended by saying, "I owe you one". Perhaps this slight reversal on who-owed-who might fix some of the strife he'd caused.
Harry nodded, “Thank you. He’s been asking about Teddy, I know he wants to see him.”
Harry couldn’t handle being spoken to like that. His body heated up and a broken cry surged forward. His pace was wild as he felt himself fall over the edge. A strong and sudden pleasure swelled and crashed into his body like the ocean into the shore. He bit down into Draco’s shoulder, letting out a wail, almost mournful but incredibly relieved.
They started off sitting next to each other. It was perfectly casual and friendly. But as conversation went on, they got closer and closer. In the end, Draco had his head in Harry’s lap, and Harry was leaned across the couch so his head rested on the armrest while his legs still fell off the couch at his knees. Meanwhile, Draco’s legs hung off the other armrest. It wasn’t exactly romantic, but it was something that signaled they weren’t just casual friends. They were something closer than that.
“What?”
“I suppose we should be.” He said before turning to put away the parchment he had been looking over. He was about to stand up, but he stopped himself and turned to Draco, “Have you ever cooked salmon?” The scent of the Manor had him dying to cook.
Draco raised an eyebrow and cracked a smile. Regardless of the situation, he couldn’t let Harry get away with a quip like that. “Did you hit your head this morning? You were never half the potion’s master I was!”
He found himself concerned for Draco’s knees. The position couldn’t possibly be comfortable. Even if it was, he doubted it would stay that way. “Is this alright?”
“You. Have. A. Collection. Of. Lotion.”
Draco smiled, gave a nod, and went to bed.
"Harry, have you used any magic or potions to make Draco fall in love with you? Or do you believe the opposite had been done?" The Head Warlock asked in a suddenly very serious tone.
He wasn’t entirely sure that it would work, but soon enough, he was able to slowly read the last of the parchment. He seemed it good enough, but only because Hermione had been half-responsible for it and she wouldn’t settle for anything less than a good job.
Hannah glared at him. She was mostly upset with herself for having fell for his lies. “Fine, so I do fancy him. What of it?”
Draco thought a moment, “Hogwarts shaped me. If I had gone anywhere else, I’d still be the absolute shit that I was when I was eleven. St. Mungo’s is just a hospital. Hogwarts changes lives. I want to be part of it.”
(n.) French. Translates to, “The Little Death.” Euphemism for the feeling of post-orgasm as likened to death.
They lasted only a few moments like this before Harry felt completely overwhelmed.
“Oh, that would be fun. We could hex each other during Quidditch matches.”
His throat was suddenly dry and he was blushing as he held on to Harry’s hips and aimed. “One more deep breath.”
“Gonna do something about it?” Neville asked and Harry nodded.
"After the war, it all feels so small. Not to say it wasn't important, but the war changed everything. Your bullying feels like it happened decades ago." He knew he was standing right on the line of their relationship, pushing it. He was pushing their boundaries and he knew that his next words could change everything. Harry looked up at the blonde and made his decision. "I forgive you. What you did doesn't hurt me anymore, it doesn't matter anymore, and I'm hardly worried it'll happen again. But you weren't the only one who was an arse. You'll have to do the same for me."
Each time it happened he would jump and look at the door, fear would briefly flash on his face. No one said anything about it but they all noticed.
Only a few hours later, Harry approached Draco with a red carnation in hand. He gave Draco a shy smile and presented the flower.
Harry spent the afternoon exchanging small presents with every member of the Weasley family. He and Hermione also introduced Molly to the idea of Secret Santa, which she thought was a wonderful idea given the sheer amount of presents everyone had suddenly become responsible for. She was so excited, in fact, that she insist they draw names on New Years, so they would have ample time to prepare. Before she told the others, however, she pulled Harry aside.
“I wasn’t trying to figure it out!” There was a tension between them that had never been there before. Even their first day wasn’t like this. On that first day, they were both scared, but right now, they were angry. “Seamus just recognized it and went on about how he liked the book.” Every suppressed frustration Harry's had about the situation was starting to resurface bubble over.
It was a lot for Harry. Even though it was indirect, and it was really the result of a spell backfiring, he killed a man. The one and only life he had taken. And he didn’t feel bad about it.
It only took a few seconds for everyone to realize Harry and Draco has been fooling around, Harry got too loud, and Dean and Seamus heard him.
The blonde's silence prompted Harry to continue, but he could see the other's lifted spirits. "For starts, I have a lot going on at work. I need to get through a few things before I can give you the attention and time you deserve. I also need to work on myself a bit. I'm not saying I have to fill every hole and pick up every broken piece, that just isn't realistic. I'll never be completely healed and that's okay. I just need to figure out how to leave most of my baggage in the past. I still have bridges to burn. If I were to be with you, I need to be someone who can dedicate more time and energy than what I have, and I need to learn to take care of myself before I can take care of you too."
scarred into his arm. He stared at it a moment and he could feel the air tense around him. He wasn't sure how they expected him to react, but of all things, he started laughing. He threw his head back and laughed away. The irony of it was all too good. It was such a stark contrast to the Dark Mark and it sat right where it used to be. It was hilarious to him. But by the same token, he was oddly proud. He was proud that they considered him a Blood Traitor because he'd rather be that then have any association with Voldemort and the Death Eaters. It was almost a new era for him. It marked a serious change in his life, just like how Harry's scar was no longer red and irritated. It turned white and taped off into something much more akin to real lightening. They still had scars, but the scars had changed and so did they. He loved everything about that.
“You’d better, Malfoy.”
Lunch was grand and fun. Quail eggs, cheeses, caviar, salmon, and wine. For dessert, they had tiramisu, Draco’s only weakness.
“I’m not pathetic!” Harry sat up defiantly. “Careful before you lose your spot on top.” He threatened. He knew Draco’s fantasy very well. He wanted a defiant barbarian to break down and turn into a whimpering mess. He wanted to play to it, since it was Draco’s birthday after all.
“I know. But there are ways to make it better. Alec is actually from Northern Ireland, and in his hometown, it’s normal for people afflicted and non-afflicted to date. They make it work and if I happen to fall for him, then I’d be willing to try.” Pansy sounded more confident about Alec than Draco had ever heard. He was happy for his friend and proud of her for sticking to what made her happy.
“Right! I don’t know who he expects to do all the housework. It certainly won’t be me!” Draco ranted as he packed the last of his things. Besides the furniture, he’s fit all his belongings into two suitcases.
"We both did." He sat down and took a deep breath. "We were both angry and neither of us let it go like we should have. I'm sorry. I really am."
“I think I should stick to more vanilla things for now. You know how I like my men ..... tied up and helpless. You’re as wild as a stallion, Harry, and I’d like to break you before I ride you.” He winked as he set his clothes aside, standing naked before Harry. “Undress.”
The joy she felt made her realize that this is what she wanted. Her whole life she was taught to aspire to marriage. That marrying the right man and having her heir would be what made her happy. Maybe if she had married the right man, she might be happy, but she didn’t know who the right man was. She thought it was Lucius, but she was naive and young. Lucius knew this and took advantage of her for her riches. She spent decades in a loveless marriage, trying to figure out what she did wrong. She made Draco the light of her life, the one thing she did right. But now she knew that as long as she wasn’t living for herself, she was never going to be happy.
“Harry Potter! How dare you miss lunch and make me worry about you! Keeping yourself in here and working instead of eating.” Draco scoffed as he barged into the room. He was obviously displeased by how Harry had missed lunch.
Harry sat down and Draco brought him some of the chocolate he kept in the fridge.
With three fingers nearly all the way in himself, he decided it was time. “Harry, are you ready?” He could be rough, he could be wicked, but he had to know that the other was okay.
So they ran away together in their heads, lying in bed, and Harry held Draco, needing to protect him with all of his soul.
It was then that Draco realized Harry was nothing like the lawyer character in his mind, but instead, he was the photographer. Or maybe, he was both. Two different sides of Harry, personified as the characters in his love story. He felt like a fool, but wouldn't change a thing. "Yea, I'm fine. I just never put so much thought into a word before."
His cheeks went pink and he looked away.
Harry nodded and furrowed his eyebrows. “Bit of a critical reader, yea?”
Luna said she and Rolf don’t plan on having a permanent home for a few years since they want to travel.
Harry didn’t even see it as pampering. He simply wanted to ease Draco’s transition into Harry’s home. He didn’t want Draco worried about the cooking or cleaning, he wanted to make it as easy as possible.
“Oh please, he’s a baby. Babies don’t know what lying is, so he could never say such a thing about me.”
When they pulled away, Narcissa moved to hug Draco while Andromeda explained. “I invited her to Teddy’s birthday because she wanted to meet him. I also know that she hasn’t properly met Harry yet.”
“Do you truly believe the end justifies the means? If I killed twelve people to prevent them from robbing a bank, am I really a hero for saving the bank? If I ruin the livelihoods of countless people, in order to pass a bill or save some orphans, am I actually a good person? I suppose you’ll never know. But I do. I know for certain.” Voldemort seemed to shrug, as if he no longer cared. “But it isn’t as if you could ask anyone else. Hermione followed you and now she’ll suffer the same fate, and Pawk doesn’t know how deep you’ve gone. You couldn’t tell her. Then she’ll fear you too. Enough people are already afraid of you, Potter. Too afraid to tell others about your tricks. Fear or ignorance. You can’t tell anyone what you’ve done. Especially not the Malfoy boy. Once he finds out, he’ll know the kind of person you really are.”
He arched his back at the sound of his name being moaned out and his hips bucked into the hand that stroked him. “Fuck, Harry. Do you want me to cum before you? Is that it? Want me to make myself cum on you and then leave you hard and needy?” His tone bordered on threatening. He couldn’t help the things he said. His brain was turned off and he could only focus on his hips.
She pulled away and looked him over, her eyes narrow and determined.
Harry winced a bit, sort of nervous that his friends might not like that he defended Draco. But instead, they all seemed to be okay with him. They even congratulated Harry on his testimony.
Narcissa nodded and sniffled again, wiping her eyes. "Yes, of course. You're right. But I mean it Draco, do not leave."
She gave a nod and moved on to another stack. "Isn't worth setting up something big." She glanced up to see Harry found the paper she was looking for, handing it to her. "Thanks."
The Floo was already loaded up with his nightstand, vanity, wardrobe, and trunk; some of his only remaining belongings.
Harry was known for being oblivious, but sometimes, he could be quite stupid as well. Like now, because for some reason, he didn’t expect he would cum that night. He genuinely believed it was over.
Things were changing. Only a few months ago, Draco would have preferred to keep his composure and push his feeling aside than to admit he was upset. But now he craved the sound of his own voice, saying that he was hurt. He had to hear it, even if no one else did, and in an empty sitting room, the words rang out. The sound was like rain on a desert; relieving. It was the sound of life.
“No.” Harry said back, finally finding his voice. “I don’t get pinned down, Malfoy.” He lurched forward, nearly knocking Draco down from surprise. It was accidental but he kept his expression indifferent. Now he was leaning over the blonde and his eyes were filled with a mischief that has run in his family for generations. “You of all people should know that I never go down without a fight, and I always find a way out. You can’t win, love.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “Right.”
“I think I love Draco.” He blurted out.
“You didn’t, don’t worry about it. But I can tell you’d rather be writing about a hundred other things than some lawsuit about two wizards who are only relevant to one niche audience.”
The hall was decorated to the nines for Christmas, there were plenty of tables around the dance floor, a bar, and a long buffet of food and drinks. Harry was trying to find the table that Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Seamus were occupying; but he was pulled off course when Draco shouted, “Pansy!” Harry held on as he was pulled through the crowd and to the other side of the room where Pansy had just entered.
In class, Draco was attentive and very much awake, almost over exaggerated. He didn’t let himself fall asleep or even rest his eyes. After their classes he behaved the same way in dinner. But he was quite anxious for it to be over.
“Merlin Harry, put on a shirt, and shave why don’t you?”
Draco took a deep breath and tried to calm down, telling himself that there was nothing wrong. That he would be okay. He told himself a hundred times that no matter what happened, he and Harry would be okay. He pushed his own feelings aside and basked in an aura of gratefulness that he created for himself. In his head he went over all the ways this was a good thing. He reminded himself of how good this would be for him. He told himself time and time again, but he was still sad.
Draco’s jaw dropped and his pants quickly became uncomfortable as he realized what he was being asked to do.
Harry only whined. “Sod off.” He sat up and leaned back against the headboard. He opened his arms but his eyes remained closed as he was still quite tired.
“It’s beautiful.” Harry commented as he stepped forward to occupy the space next to Draco. He had a million questions and suggestions, but he knew what Draco had come here for. He didn’t come here for Harry to ask where a room, he didn’t come here to sit about, he didn’t come here to worry about whether or not someone would come along and catch them, he didn’t come here to think. He came here to be whisked away, so that’s what Harry intended on doing. “Do you want to go sledding?”
“Well, if I didn't you'd be in pain because of how you were lying. If I woke you up, I would have disturbed what was probably the best night's sleep you've had here. So I took a chance and carried you.” He said it as if it wasn't a big deal, as if he had been completely confident in his decision.
"It's okay to not feel great, emotionally. Being attacked like that can be traumatizing."
Harry shook his head. “No. I don’t like the idea of you giving me a sexual favor because you feel like you have to. I don’t want you to do it out of obligation. That makes me extremely uncomfortable.”
The blonde wailed and let his head drop to rest in the crook of Harry’s neck, moaning and kissing. He switched sides and let himself feel just how desperate he was. The way his own hips were so frantic, his loud calls of pleasure, the way he loved the grip in his hair, and the way he so easily fell for the dirty things Harry said. But he also noticed Harry’s panting and the way his thighs had begun to shake. He felt them as they rested on either side of his body. First, a shiver would come through them every few strokes, but soon enough, they rushed through him endlessly. He moved to rest his lips just beside Harry’s ear before moaning out the words, “Oh lover, your thighs are trembling. Close?”
Draco already knew where this was going. Given that Harry had a pattern of leaking stories, he could already tell Harry was going to say he was the one who leaked the story that ruined Garren.
Though he didn’t say anything on it, in the short time Draco was gone, he’d picked up the scent of the Manor. It was a scent that made Harry’s stomach churn, and he hated how much it affected him when he was trying to have a moment with Draco.
“It feels good.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It isn’t bad. I don’t know. I think it’s because so many people at Hogwarts have their names done that way. There’s just such a high concentration in one place, so it seems strange.”
Harry stifled a laugh and wrapped his arm around Draco, pulling the man into his chest. “I think I can handle that.”
His birthday party was everything he could of hoped. His friends and family all got along. Everyone laughed and joked, told stories, ate, played games, and fawned over Teddy.
It was calm and fine until Draco kissed just under the shell of Harry’s right ear.
“Oh, Harry! I just remembered, I wanted to talk with you about our DADA class, there’s this thing that I don’t quite understand.” Hermione said, grabbing Harry hand and pulling him away.
The boys have their first Christmas with Teddy and with each other.
Draco smirked and raised an eyebrow. "Oh? I didn't think you were so easy to turn on. Probably because we've both been so long since we've came." His arms went to wrap around Harry's shoulders. "Bit desperate, yea?"
Again, Harry found himself staring. He was distracted by Draco’s jaw. It was soft but still defined, just enough to catch Harry’s eye. His eyes trailed up slightly to Draco's cheek, his eyes outlined the shape of it, taking in each and every detail. Every curve, the little pink blotches, the couple freckles, and how his cheekbone stood out from his face. For some strange reason he wanted to kiss it.
They said their goodbyes and Harry put the map back in his trunk.
Draco bit his lip and looked away for a moment as if trying to compose himself. He was struck by a wave of desire and shifted a bit, trying to keep calm. "I never would have guessed you could be so dirty." He knew Harry felt his boner, so he used it to his advantage. He shifted his hips a bit to press up against him even further, making Harry's cheeks and shoulders glow pink. "I really ought to be teasing you for the way you teased me on Christmas Eve. Don't you think?"
