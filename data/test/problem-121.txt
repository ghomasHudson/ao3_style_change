Slowly, Harry starts to thrust against Draco’s finger, his brain beginning to fog up and he feels like Draco’s all around him and he wants —
“You okay?” Harry asks when he feels a wetness against his chest, when he hears Draco take in an unsteady breath.
Draco’s upper lip curls into something ugly. “And get caught by Granger? Do you want me to go back to Azkaban?”
“You shouldn’t say things like that,” Draco says, kissing against the sensitive spot of Harry’s neck.
There’s a knock on the door, and everyone turns to see Blaise standing in the doorway, face serious and lips drawn into a hard line. “Draco.” His eyes shift back and forth between all three of them. “It’s Pansy.”
The next day, Harry wakes up in Draco’s bed alone. Harry frowns as he blinks in the late afternoon’s sun. Pulling on his glasses, he slowly drags himself up and out of bed.
I am sorry to hear that you were hurt too, I thought it might have been happening to you - and I hate to hear that was in fact the case.
“Whoa slow down there,” Ron says, voice a soothing whisper. The floating candles flicker around them, making them feel cocooned in the safety of their intimacy. “I don’t have to forgive him, and you don’t have to hate him.”
“I like being gentle with you,” Harry says, the weight of this truth pushing heavily against the insecurities that have had their claws in Harry’s heart for a very long time.
P.S. I completely relate to your point of not being able to see a Muggle therapist because of the limitation provided by Statute.
It becomes a regular part of their routine after that, they’ll smoke and then they’ll fuck, or they’ll fuck and then smoke — either is fine and there’s really no rush.
Draco visits him regularly, far more regularly than Harry had anticipated, each time he comes seeking Harry out with an offer for sex. Harry thinks at first, he’s being tested, but discards that idea as quickly as it came. If he’s being tested, Draco hasn’t a clue that he’s the one proctoring the exam.
Draco moves his hand from inside Harry’s pants making him groan at the loss of contact and takes Harry’s hand off him too. Harry wants to keep touching him, needs to keep touching him — is already moving to kiss his neck, kissing, sucking, biting. Hard. Because Harry thinks Draco might just like it a bit rough too.
Theo puts down his knife, turns, hugs Draco tightly. Theo puts a cold hand to the back of his neck, touches the skin there softly. Oh, the ways in which a platonic touch can heal a wound turned sore from the bitter salt of a believed truth that has been rubbed into it one time too many.
Ron nods, swallows the burn of grief in his throat. How many nights had they stayed up, cradling one another after fighting a war they were much too young for? This feels just like that. And yet, it feels so different from that too – maybe because their grief is further away from them now than it was back then, when everything was pain, when the world seemed darker; devoid of a brightness they both thought they’d never see again.
Harry opens his eyes, begins to pump his fist as he watches Draco gasp, groan, whimper all because Harry’s touching him.
“Quite the accomplishment, you see.” Pansy’s white teeth are contrasted by her maroon lipstick. Harry thinks she’s trying to smile, but it doesn’t reach her eyes. “Occasion enough to celebrate, if I do say so myself.”
“I love you,” they say together. At the same time. Draco doesn’t want him to be the only one bearing their heart.
And then, get this Draco, Dumbledore knew I had to die from the very beginning. Ha fucking ha, he raised me as a pig for slaughter. Snape's words, not mine. From the moment he left me with the Dursleys, he knew I had to die. Makes you wonder what I would be like if I had been raised by people who actually loved me instead. Maybe I wouldn’t be such the eager fucking child soldier everyone is so excited to celebrate. Maybe I wouldn’t have been ready to die if I hadn’t been raised for literal murder.
Molly grabs a box by her feet, dumping its contents out onto the coffee table. Bags of white powder scatter, along with the silver spoon they’d used to snort the Pixie Dust. There are bags of weed, pre-rolled spliffs, cigarettes, tabs of acid on aluminium, and other random pills Harry’s never seen before. “We found all of this on your side of the room, Harry, dear. In your mattress.”
Undoing the button on Harry’s trousers, Draco drops to his knees before him, pulling the waistband of his boxers down to reveal his half hard cock and sucking on it until it’s long and full inside Draco’s hot mouth. Draco pushes down Harry’s foreskin with his hand, using his tongue to twirl around the head. Draco hollows out his cheeks, and Harry’s moan echoes across the empty bathroom.
Yeah, I’ve been with a few blokes and know a thing or two about having sex with one. It depends on what you think you’ll like and what you’re open to trying. I’ve sent along a book Hermione gave me when I came out to her. I don’t think I ever told you, but I came out to her and Ron a while back. They were super supportive, it was such a relief. Ginny is the only other person I’m out to, and eventually I plan to tell the rest of the Weasley family but for now, there’s this. It's a really nice feeling being supported by people you love. I’m so grateful to have them.
Room assignments are different this year, which is a point against Harry’s wish for a normal school year. Somehow, he doubts he’ll be given the pleasure of a peaceful year. The Eighth Years are forced to stay behind after the welcome feast, where they are then ushered off into a random tower and told this will be their new dormitory. Harry’s hardly paying attention when his name is called and his room number is assigned, he really should have been paying attention though, because then he wouldn’t be feeling so out of place in his new room.
I get what you mean about not being able to say Voldemort’s name. I hate closed spaces because of reasons I’d rather not get into but those things don’t go away easily. So, I understand.
Besides that, it was nice seeing you in person. You looked really...nice in your uniform. I thought it would be unsettling seeing you in a Muggle cafe but it was really...nice, I enjoyed myself a lot.
Harry can’t help but laugh a bit, because who would have thought that after Parkinson’s attempt to give Harry up to Voldemort, she’d be in his dorm room asking him which outfit looks, well, sluttier.
So, Harry does what he’s wanted to do since he saw Parkinson and Draco sneak back up to the dorms and walks up the round cobblestone staircase, heading towards his room. He hears their laughter before he sees them, and for a brief second worries he’s about to walk in on them shagging.
Christ, everyone wants to blame Malfoy like he has anything to do with it. Maybe, just, maybe this has to do with me and my life, me needing space. Has anyone stopped to consider what I
Hermione says forgiveness is “letting go of feelings of revenge and desire to retaliate,” which is either something she got from her books or her mind healer. I guess if forgiveness is that, then I've already forgiven you for just about everything. But, I guess, just because you’ve forgiven someone doesn’t mean you have to keep them in your life or accept them as they are. Sometimes, you have to burn a bridge or set strong boundaries and even then, that still counts as forgiveness.
He’s thinking of Ginny in one moment and then in the next, his mind shifts, and chocolate brown eyes melt into clouded grey, fiery red burns into white-blond ash, and Draco Malfoy is pinned sharp beneath him where there once was Ginny’s soft curves. It fucks with his head, really.
Harry was feverish with his want, open with his attraction, and he wanted it to be a smouldering heat they dipped into – plain and simple, he wanted.
3. Harry's a bit of a mess, but connecting with people while you're considered a saviour must be very difficult, don't you think?
“Hit me.” Draco says. He’s laughing so hard, and Harry feels elated at the sound of it. It’s the best thing he’s ever heard. Ever.
“I don’t know, Gin, maybe I just don’t want to be around all that grief right now.” Once the words leave his mouth, Harry’s surprised by how true they feel — but still feels incredibly guilty for having said those words aloud; it sits at the back of his heart, dragging down his mood from annoyance into something more sombre.
See, now that’s what Harry had thought too. How Malfoy’s friends can be more reasonable than his own is beyond Harry. Malfoy’s friends don’t care, why does Harry’s friends have to throw such a fit over it? It’s not just tonight, it’s every night. Every fucking night Hermione and Ron share a little look every time Harry gets up to leave like he’s a teenager in the midst of some sort of a rebellious phase instead of a war hero who’s just relieved he made it out of it alive.
“Did you know our pupils grow wider when we’re looking at someone we’re attracted to,” says Draco, lifting Harry’s glasses, placing them gently on the nightstand.
Later, after Dean’s left and Harry’s stripped into his pants and one of Draco’s long-sleeved shirts, Harry lays in bed waiting for Draco to return. The comforting scent of lavender and myrrh is all around him, and he breathes it in deeply.
“He was scared, just like me,” Hermione says. “He was awful to me; he did everything he could to let me know how different we were. And yet, we share something now – fear, we’ve both been afraid of similar things.”
“Just,” Draco says, hands held up and out into the cold space between them. “I can’t do this if you need to get drunk to fuck me.”
Draco attempts to grab at something under his bed, he’s struggling to reach it because Harry won’t let him go, kissing and sucking and touching and rutting against him. “Just give me
Draco rolls his eyes at her, wondering if it’s Richard again. He’s been visiting, trying to show Draco that everything is still okay between them. Draco appreciates the effort, the man had been Draco’s first friend in this odd little world he had willingly found himself in almost a year ago - it’s nice to know that his friendship is valued enough that there is an effort to make sure it is kept.
Under the fluorescent light of the pub, Draco’s face shines a soft cherry red with the warmth of drink and he’s quiet and observant and so bloody good looking. Harry can’t stop staring, Merlin, he wants to put Draco’s diamond encrusted silver earring in his mouth, he wants to bite his porcelain neck, he wants to lick those wet, pink, lips and yet Harry doesn’t move.
Harry touches his split upper lip, remembers Draco fucking into him, and fights to supress the grin threatening to show on his face. “Something like that.”
Harry raises a brow, turning towards Malfoy who flushes pink. “Am I not a man?” He half-yells, arms up, clearly annoyed.
Ron clenches his fists. “Y’know what really gets to me, mate?” He cracks his neck, eyes drawing thin, glare boring into Harry. “You go on and on about not having a family, but here you have one. A family, that is. And what? It’s too hard for you to be around us now that we’re suffering. Only want us when we’re the happy little family you can play house with?”
Drinks had been their amicable truce. “Brothers fight,” Ron had said. It warmed something deep within Harry, and soothed the ugly, decaying boyhood that still clogged his chest.
“You like that?” Harry asks, not because he’s unsure but precisely because he already knows the answer.
Draco stiffens. “Are you?” Harry wonders if Draco can feel the way his heart beats rapidly in his chest.
Harry apparates, and then suddenly, they’re in Harry’s room – he really shouldn’t apparate when he’s drunk, especially as an Auror, and also, he’s just ditched all his friends (who all went out for his birthday party mind you) but then Draco’s kicking off his shoes, laying on Harry’s bed and holding out his hand and all of Harry’s thoughts fly out the window. The only thing that matters now is Draco’s body against his.
“You think they’re going to–?” Harry leans towards Ron to ask, only cutting himself off when he remembers that they haven’t really talked about anything that happened before the break. They hadn’t really talked at all since Ron had come back early in the afternoon.
“Oh,” Harry said, licking his lips. His throat felt thick with something, his heart pattered in his chest — reminding him that he was alive, that he felt something. It was a complicated something. “What about that silence bit?”
I had to learn a lot about him, Dumbledore wanted to be sure I was prepared to face him when the time came. Something about knowing your enemy and all that other Hippogriffshit. So, yeah, that’s how I know about that.
. I’m not some emotionless martyr ready to be of service whenever you bloody well need me!” Harry’s grateful that this particular row is happening in the privacy of Ron’s dorm room. His roommate, Justin Finch-Fletchley, has already left for holiday leaving them with some semblance of privacy.
Also, about Snape. Yeah, I’m not too fond of the guy, but he was on our side in the end. Did you know that? I’ve submitted a story about it to the Quibbler, so that his sacrifices and death were not in vain. It’s kind of weird though, because apparently he was kind of weirdly in love with/obsessed with my mum? It’s
When Malfoy unravels, he does so beautifully, body shaking under Harry, damp forehead against his own. It’s perfect, just perfect. Harry feels the high of his climax in the way his body relaxes, the way he kisses at the saltiness of Malfoy’s skin, the way he feels the residual craving of his want. He wants more already and feels a joy that leaves him foolish. Harry slides out of the heat of Malfoy’s tight body, turning in search of something to clean his and the other man’s chest with when he hears a short sniff and shifts his gaze to meet the glittering tears that decorate Malfoy’s pale-reddened face.
The two lay there in the pale moonlight; for how long neither knew. They just enjoyed each other's company until they would have to leave each other's embrace.
“Babe,” Harry said, giving the latter’s shoulder a shake. The blonde shifted but remained asleep. Harry rolled his eyes playfully, a smile splitting across his face. “Draco!” His eyes opened, squinting at the curly-haired boy sat in front of him in sleepy disbelief. Draco breathed out a laugh, before yawning openly. He was dressed in his usual letterman jacket, for what he could only guess as football; the one Draco had always admired from afar. His glasses were perched on the bridge of his nose, glinting playfully at him.
“I’m great,” Draco replied, flickering his eyes briefly in Harry’s direction to find emerald green staring back at him. Draco blushed lightly, “How’s the family?”
Still, Draco stood tall. If he lets his father’s words get to him, who knows what might happen, “And? So, what?” Lucius stalked forward, and Draco backed away until his back was flat against the off-white wall.
“This might be the depression talking but,” Draco mumbled humorlessly, missing the frown forming on the other boy’s face. “What is it that you…see in me?”
Draco walked tiredly down the steps of his house, having gotten maybe two hours of sleep the night before. He was kept up by his thoughts, mainly remaining on Harry and his father. Narcissa came to greet him, giving him a peck on the cheek before letting him go off to school.
Harry moved to sit up, Draco doing the same. “Despite what you may think, you’re very beautiful. Your eyes are probably my favorite thing about you. They’re always full of wonder at the littlest things and I love that.” Draco blinked impulsively, fighting off the blush threatening to burn his cheeks.
Draco breathed a laugh through his nose and flung himself at Pansy, wrapping his arms around her, “You’re the best friend I could ever ask for.”
Meanwhile, Pansy walked up to Harry, her phone behind her back, ignoring the stares of the others at the popular table. He smiled at her, recognition flitting across his face.
The man, narrowed his eyes at him in confusion, lowering his hood and mask. “How’d you know it was me?”
"Oh my god, I might cry." Draco said, having just listened to the recording, pulling Pansy into an awkward hug across the table, "What did I ever do to deserve you?"
“It’s fine, really. Can I help you with anything?” Harry asked, figuring he might as well be polite. The blonde furrowed his eyebrows cutely, making Harry’s heart shudder in his chest.
“Eh, maybe two in the morning? And are you sure you’re okay? You’ve been crying,” Pansy pointed out, wiping a stray tear off his cheekbone. Draco tentatively touched his face; sure enough, his cheeks were still wet with slow-drying tears.
"Draco!" Pansy exclaimed, arms moving to fold neatly across her chest. "Are you even listening to me?"
. He let out a frustrated sigh as he went to his first class, one that he prayed wouldn't involve the dark-skinned man.
that I was dating you. They even started to try and get my opinions on various girls at school.” Draco scoffed. As gay as he is, he couldn’t believe how terrible most guys are.
He shook it off, not wanting to get his hopes up. After all, they’ve only been dating nearly a month. Draco scratched subconsciously at the black ink on his left forearm, closing his eyes and letting himself fall into a much-needed sleep.
Draco sighed reluctantly, finally getting out of bed for what was probably the first time that day. He straightened out his clothes and ran a hand through his messy blonde hair and slipped on the nearest pair of shoes, which happened to be his black converse. He grabbed Harry’s hand in his, offering him a small smile and letting the tan-skinned boy lead him out of the house.
“Uh…can we help you?” Pansy asked, the question coming out more bitter than she hoped. Hermione flickered her eyes briefly towards her, giving her a stern look that said
Pansy looked up, clearly startled to see someone running straight at them. She contemplated grabbing Hermione and fleeing but stopped completely at recognition of the person. He slowed as he neared them, leaning against Hermione’s car to momentarily catch his breath.
Harry turned back towards the ginger, pushing him as hard as he could into the wall opposite, Ron seemingly sobering up on impact. “You fucking asshole! Why the fuck would you do that?!”
Remus flicked his eyes over to Sirius, before turning back to Harry, shrugging, smiling warmly, “I say go to him.”
“Yeah...have I not told you?” Harry asked, furrowing his eyebrows, racking his brain for any recollection. Come to think of it, he hadn’t even been home enough in the past month or so to have a conversation that didn’t include whether he had eaten or done his homework.
first of all! thank you for 2.1k! (now almost 2.5k wow ily all) i appreciate every single one of you reading this :) second, i wanted to touch base on why I've been writing (a little too much) about draco and his depression, etc. if you have/had depression before, or even anxiety, you would know that it can come and go, or always be there (perhaps just suppressed). in draco's case (or many, including myself) it is typically both. i just hope it wasn't boring/childish/excessive sjsjkss. before this gets too long, know that i am here for you, as are others and know you aren't alone! thank you for reading! :)
He drove the few minutes it took to get to the party, parking and heading inside. The living room was crowded, chock full of assorted girls and boys dancing to generic electronic music in one large group. A few couples were spotted making out in random places and Draco grimaced. It didn’t take him long to spot Harry across the room, who seemed to be leaving with the boy he called Ron.
Harry sat down, running a hand through his curls before speaking, “I may or may not have overheard you talking,” Pansy rolled her eyes, “and I was hoping…you could set me up with Draco?”
A faint bang followed by yelling was heard as Draco ran away, though he didn’t care to look back. The blood rushing in his ears, heart pounding against his chest was far too loud to hear anything else. He ran blindly, eventually finding the front of the house. He pushed through the crowd, head down to hide his face. They resumed their dancing behind him, completely oblivious to anything going on. Draco decided that’s what he hated most about these kinds of people; they simply don’t care.
“Because. If you don’t, I’ll...” Blaise leaned down and whispered the last part into the blonde’s ear. Draco’s jaw fell open as he paled.
“We should go,” Harry whispered softly. Draco nodded, but he remained in the same spot. The dark-haired boy sighed and moved to sit up but was stopped by a hand pushing him back down.
Hours later, Draco sat in his history class, doodling aimlessly on the paper in front of him. The teacher, Mr. Binns, droned on about the civil war or something, while Draco looked up at the clock for what was probably the thousandth time. Draco sighed, willing time to go by faster, in hopes to get to his next class, pre-calculus, also known as the one class that Draco had with Harry, meaning his favorite class.
His mind wandered to his parents for the first time in a while, specifically his mother. Draco hardly sees her anymore between his schooling and her job, plus any time he spent the night at his friend's. He'd been so worried about himself that he nearly forgot about her. A deep sense of guilt settled in his chest; he should be there for her.
Soon enough, they arrived at their next destination; a white-sanded beach with glittering miscellaneous objects on its surface. Draco gasped, opening the car door and getting out before Harry even had the chance to cut the ignition. The setting sun reflected on the glass-like waters, shimmering almost blindingly. Despite being as pale, and cold, as winter, he loved the beach; something about it reminded him of better times, when he was truly happy.
"I'm sorry I cried and probably ruined the night," Draco mumbled, chuckling nervously, "It's my problem and I didn't need to put it on you too."
“What’d you need to talk about?” Harry asked, itching to finally ditch the party and head home. His patience was slowly wearing thinner by the second, as Ron had merely blinked at him in drunken confusion. The ginger’s eyes widened in acknowledgment, suddenly remembering the importance of what he had to say. Ron stepped closer to Harry, which seemed far closer to the sober one of the both of them. Harry squirmed uncomfortably under his stare, looking to the left and right in attempt to find a way out of this. “Uh, Ron–?”
"I don't think I can do it, Pans," The blonde mumbled after a few moments of silence, his voice muffled by the table.
“You’re,” Narcissa started, “happy about it?” Draco rolled his eyes; she really doesn’t know him at all.
“I assure sure you I am not,” Hermione said in mock seriousness, clear amusement painted across her features. Draco came to the sudden realization that they were standing in the middle of the hallway when someone roughly shoved passed him. Draco scoffed, before starting to walk down the hall again.
Draco scoffed at his poor flirting, though his heart still skipped a beat. Man did he like this boy. "
For whatever reason, they thought it was okay to interrogate him until he told them why he skipped out on the party they were throwing, the same one they throw every Friday. Of course, he would tell his friends about Draco, but he wanted to make sure the latter was okay with it first. As his friends, Harry assumed they would be understanding, since he was there every other time. Apparently not.
Later came sooner than he hoped, his two best friends practically demanding answers. Scratch that, they were demanding. Judging by their tones, they clearly noticed Blaise was back and that he was hot on his trail. Draco fought with himself internally over whether he should tell them the whole truth; not only is it dangerous, but
Suddenly, an idea popped into her mind and she smiled. Draco watched as she let go of his hand and whipped out her phone, typing a few things in.
“Sorry,” Hermione said sheepishly, “I just couldn’t wait to tell him. And he was definitely shocked.”
“No!” Harry exclaimed, loud enough for those around him to stare or shush him. He apologized awkwardly with a wave of his hand before bringing his attention back to the smirking girls. “Not at all. I-“
Draco stared at him as he spoke, fighting the urge to run over there and hug him on instinct. He opted for folding his arms tighter instead.
Harry came up from behind him and watched the awe flit across the blonde’s face, "Yeah, it is." He smiled fondly and sat next to Draco, turning to stare at the colors retreating on the horizon.
Draco got out of the car and was immediately ambushed by girls. With one look at the hair on their heads, he knew exactly who they were; Pansy and Hermione. He wrinkled his nose as a chunk of bushy hair tickled his nostrils. Before he could even open his mouth to speak, the girls pulled away and spoke enthusiastically.
He didn’t know when exactly the whole crush thing started. He did remember, though, the day he first laid eyes on the blonde boy.
"Why not, Drake," pansy asked softly. she grabbed his right hand in hers and held it in a comforting gesture. This was one of the times Draco was grateful for having these two as his friends.
The rest of the date went smoothly, filled with eating and inane “get to know each other better” talk. Harry paid the check and the two of them walked back out to Harry’s car. Draco sunk in his seat nervously, despite the excitement bubbling up in his stomach.
“Har, if you could just tell us what’s wrong, maybe we could help?” Remus suggested for what felt like the thousandth time. Sirius sank further into the couch with a sigh, pulling Remus closer to him.
Draco watched her expression sadden slightly, making him feel guilty. He wrapped arm around her shoulders and kissed the top of her head apologetically; he knew she was right.
Draco was close to sobbing now, clutching the soft fabric of Harry’s shirt in his fist, his tears slowly drenching it, “H-He got angry, p-probably the w-worst I’d ever seen him. I t-tried to s-stop him from leaving, b-begged him, s-saying we could m-make it work. H-He th-threw me o-out of the w-way, into the w-wall. I f-fractured one of m-my ribs f-from it, th-though it w-wasn’t anything I-I wasn’t already u-used to.”
His eyes snapped open with a gasp as Draco sat up in surprise, his head colliding with a hard object above him, making him fall back into the lush carpet. He groaned openly, his eyes shut in pain as he clutched his now throbbing forehead.
“He got more abusive as days went by,” Harry’s hold tightened as Draco’s breath hitched. Harry’s very presence made this ten times easier to talk about. Draco’s eyes welled up with tears, but he didn’t hold them back. “Calling me a slut and a whore daily, accusing me of cheating on him behind his back, even though I was almost always with him. Why I stayed with him I’ll never know; I guess I was afraid of what would happen if I tried to leave… Pansy told me countless times that the relationship was toxic, but I didn’t listen. I was fully convinced that things would work out for us in the end. It didn’t.”
Draco's breath hitched, memories of the past flitting behind his eyes. He tried so hard to suppress them since then, but he couldn’t help but think about it often. Harry’s eyes widened at his expression, realizing he had struck a chord. The tears soon came in waves, much like the ones a few feet ahead of them. Draco’s put his face in his hands, not wanting to show Harry this ugly side of himself.
- what if feeling this rotten would make the Omega attention unbearable? But besides the few dozen glances and intentional brushings of shoulders initiated by Alphas throughout the day, Draco was managing his… condition... relatively well. Although his hand was getting a little sore from the number of times he had to crumble up little love messages, poems, and invitations to clubs or Hogsmeade. Things were no doubt going to get a lot worse after his 4th elective, Defence Against the Dark Arts, which he frustratedly remembered was shared with the Gryffindor Sixth Years and taught by Professor Snape now.
Draco swallowed. Maybe he needn’t let it effect his night, after all that smile on the other boy’s face was refusing to waver, and Dumbledore was omniscient when he wanted to be, things would be okay tonight.
She was sitting by herself under a tree - she was talking to herself. She had on a big pair of orange, sun-shaped glasses and she was wearing a metal contraption on top of her head, it looked like a collage of muggle devises glued together and stacked into a pyramid-shaped hat.
Potter’s long legs could be seen descending the staircase from one of the towers, and when he reached the landing the boy smiled brightly at Draco. This was the first time - since the moment in the hallway after Snape’s class three days ago - that they’d spoken. Potter had kept his word, he stayed away. He kept his head low every time Draco walked past. Whenever Potter got a chance to he’d turn the other way and march down a different direction, which wasn’t really necessary. It actually irritated Draco, and it was irritating Draco the more he wondered why.
“I wanted to talk to you.” Harry said rather firmly, he recovered instantly. His eyebrows knit together and his glasses were sliding down his nose.
“But that’s aside the point. How is Harry not supposed to be here? I thought he’d bonded with Malfoy already.”
Eventually, the sounds quietened, or Sirius fell asleep again, he wasn’t exactly sure which came first but he woke up stiff and propped up against the door. He realised he was still pretzeled on the stool and that it was Draco’s weary voice calling his name that woke him up.
His nails dug into the padding of his sleeves, reigning-in the emotions that wanted to split his head open and burst out.
Draco pushed past Harry wordlessly and marched over without hesitation, feeling a sense of second-hand indignation at the treatment of the Omega. Or was he just a little too eager to escape that conversation? Because now the impending reality of the situation was crashing down on him and Draco’s mouth was moving faster than his brain could find a way out of it.
He was sprinting up two, sometimes three, stairs at a time. With no place in mind to go, so long as it was as far from the Great Hall as possible. He doesn’t take the time to count how many floors he was leaping through, or how many hall ways he tore down. Eventually he stopped, breathless and bleary eyed, gazing around uselessly in the dark corridor. He stood there long enough to confirm it was abandoned, before ducking into a corner and collapsing
“Alright,” Sirius said. He called out for Kreacher, who Apparated between them instantly. His glassy, bulging eyes peered at the Omega with intrigue for a few seconds, long enough for Draco to lose the will to keep his legs straight. Like a doll, he dropped lifelessly on the floor, crumbling to his knees. The sudden loud thud of his bone against the floor prophesied painful looking black bruised knees.
“Tell me about it.” He said with a sigh. “This has been - to put it politely - an absolute cockup of a semester.”
“I’m ready now to do what I have to.” Draco didn’t think he could live through another heat alone. “If my family is saved.”
’ with dark coordinating colours and fearsome-looking versions of the symbolic animals. For all intents and purposes, it was a Halloween party, and a very charismatically thrown-together one at that, thank you very much.
SORRY FOR THE WAIT EVERYONE I LOVE U ALL IM GOING TO REPLY TO ALL THE COMMENTS NOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE... ITS BEEN A LONG WHILE!!!! THEN I'M GOING TO DOODLE AND POST SOME ART FOR THIS IN AN UPDATE SO STAY TUNED! <3 THNX FOR THE SUPPORT IVE ALSO DECIDED ON THE NUMBER OF CHAPTERS!!!!
There was a slight breeze rustling the sheer bed curtains around them, it came from the draft wafting through the dungeon tunnels. Blaise convinced himself that it caused the shiver that ran down his spine and not from the terror of Draco’s quiet rage.
Draco couldn’t get what happened out of his head. It was eating at him from the inside, like there were maggots under his skin, wiggling and burrowing until the could burst out to the surface. He needed to find Luna, to say something. He had to apologise, he didn’t think he could live through another guilt-ridden, sleepless night.
With great difficulty, they worked together for an hour or so. Potter didn’t say much of anything to his Omega, deliberately keeping any questions about their duties short or general enough for the whole room. Draco’s wasn’t even able to enjoy testing out the shadow animals he was looking forward to. With a couple of spins from his wand a black fog poured from the tip of it, it spread like ink onto the floor. The smoke, as if alive, shuddered and divided rapidly, like a cell being split into smaller copies of itself. The dozens of black shadows turned into unmistakable two-dimensional animals, things like snakes, rats, bats, spiders, cats. They scurried across the floor and up the walls, running around in an organised sequence of circles and simple shapes, as if doing a choreographed dance.
The Omega would never be able to explain exactly what came over him, only knowing that it was too late to stop the gamut of emotions that came over him. Instead of attempting to communicate with words, Draco only flung his arms around the man’s waist, burrowing his cheek into his large chest.
He wondered what Lucia would make of it, so with a sweeping look of the room, he found her standing stiffly by one end of the rows of tables, occasionally pointing at things for people to sample. Draco hadn’t spoken to her since…
Draco shut his eyes and let the world fall away beneath him; when he finally opened them again, the world rushed back in nauseatingly. He thought back to what had happened - wasn’t bonding to Potter meant to keep his magic under control. Was this just going to get worse? He stole a glance towards the Gryffindor table, and sure enough Potter was sitting on the opposite side which meant he could easily stare across the dining hall at Draco. The blush that filled Draco’s cheeks was unavoidable. Shame, embarrassment, anger, they all churned inside him fighting for dominance.
His lazy stalker must have been hinted to by Dumbledore of when he’d be back. It seemed Dumbledore was giving Potter all the easy opportunities to leave an impression on Draco now, to make the union easier to stomach. Their partial-bond felt weaker than ever, the Omega could hardly register the Alpha’s scent from this distance, and it wasn’t until he approached the first step could he make out that familiar combination of polished wood, ink, and Lavender shampoo.
Could Draco be… Was he… Using the toy? Sirius only left it there as a spiteful joke, never in his wildest dreams would he think Draco Bloody Malfoy would have it in him to attempt to sexually perform with a cock so big even the most experienced needed prep-time and foreplay before daring it.
Then Draco yielded, and he sighed when the ache in his joints from lack of use finally caught up with his racing mind.
expect the chapter after this to come out fairly soon, it's almost done just some missing bits and pieces here and there
He had come up with ideas like snakes swimming in water-bubble-balloons, or little demons transfigured from buttons to flutter around blowing fire. His favourite were the shadow animals that would run around the room and up the ceiling, it was the spell he was most excited to see it fully performed in a room after all the hours it took working out the technical issues.
The pain flaring from the glands in his neck was so intense he struggled to even roll around in bed, let alone sit up. He twitched and cried at an attempt at relief, but all he managed was to gurgle through his swollen throat and spasm occasionally. The room quickly was overwhelmed by his sickly sweet heat pheromone - it was like over-ripened fruit. It nearly made him want to vomit. He tried to take slow deep breaths to stay detached from the sensations of his body, but even the act of breathing was enough to drive him crazy, causing Draco to let out another involuntarily shudder and loud weep.
“Okay - I get it. You don’t have to explain anymore. Hey - hey c’mere…” Harry pulled him into a hug as soon as Draco started to hiccup and let out a new sob, it was so tight Draco couldn’t move a muscle. He was so confused, normally he wouldn’t care. This was so unlike him, but ever since presenting, his emotions had been all over the place, and even now he was struggling to reel back the never-ending overflow.
The immense thirst he only started to notice was a distraction to the bitter taste and it went down easily enough. He smacked his lips to become accustomed to the tacky saliva feeling in his mouth. He was pretty sure he was supposed to take the beetroot juice concoction before the heat even started, and wouldn’t be able to confidently say whether or not it made a real difference, by this point he was desperate for anything that could relieve the pain shooting through every nerve in his body.
The Headmaster nodded, still smiling. “How did you find your time spent back with Sirius? I heard you two have become quite close, family is important.”
“We’ll put a pin in that for now. I gave you space today out of courtesy to you, Draco. Now you’re going to return the favour by explaining where the fuck you’ve been. Why were you taken away from me? Why couldn’t the Headmaster trust you to have your heat here, darling? Too good for a private room in Hogwarts?”
this one's a bit of a boring chapter! had to get build up out of the way before the fun chapters! :))
A dozen hands all launched into the air at once, some waving frantically. Draco almost let his knees bend to cut a couple of centimetres off his already smaller stature.
Potter looked disappointed and Draco wasn’t sure why. Wasn’t he relieved that Draco didn’t want to hex him into furniture?
All there was left to do was wait - he seemed to be in too much shock to reach for his wand in his back pocket - either until the ground cooled off enough to walk barefooted on, or until the castle realised what had happened and its inhabitants swarmed the scene.
It shook again, rumbling enough that it rocked back and forth on its four legs. The bronze hinges were rattling and the knobs were spinning off before shooting out into the crowd.
Draco took them gingerly, and as soon as they parted from the Alpha’s hand he whipped around and stomped towards the direction of the Gryffindor towers.
The presentation of his second gender also introduced Harry to a new kind of hunger: to concur, it was fed by unshakeable determination, which he had as he advanced in on Draco.
…when Draco bound to Harry Potter. It helped finding Harry likeable over the weeks, give or take a few less than ideal interactions, often fuelled by Harry’s jealously, or his stupidity.
buttons, or the song - rhymes, chorus and all - about Ron written solely to piss off Gryffindor house, or was it to piss Harry off? The casual smirk was blooming into a full-on grin. “Halloween after all.”
“R…” Draco tried. He looked so real. He smelt like he was there. But of course it wasn’t him. So why couldn’t Draco move? Why couldn’t Draco
He took a chance and went for a door, it was an empty classroom. He took a sweeping turn and collapsed down the wall nearby the door.
. He was safest with Sirius, inside his untraceable home. She gripped at the skirts of her deep blue robes and pinched her lips unhappily, why did Draco have to be so difficult? It’d been a week and from what little she could gather from Severus, she knew her boy was refusing to budge.
Draco laughed, the sound surprising himself. It relaxed the tension in his body and he sidestepped around the Alpha looming too close into his space, he refused to acknowledge the impish smile growing across the other’s face, instead eager to continue on down the hall until he reached the Great Hall.
“An unbonded Omega wouldn’t be able to resist releasing slick as it’s exposed genitals are presented to an Alpha. You didn’t give up a drop, so despite not completing his mateship Greyback clearly did enough to contain you biologically.” He left the lounge to leave Draco to his own devises, but Draco could only stare after him with open, horrified bewilderment.
Draco hesitated a long time, but finally mustered the courage to step forward, close enough for Sirius to grab at his arm and pull him over the engine cavity. Draco instinctually swung his leg over, like it were a broom, and shared the space on the seat. It only took a second for him to regain his backbone when he grabbed a hold of the leather handles without being instructed to. Draco jumped back in surprise when Sirius settled his own larger gloved hands around them, gripping tightly. He rotated both their wrists downwards until the motorbike roared to life and whirred loudly in response to each twist of the handles.
“What makes you think Dumbledore will agree with you now, surely you don’t think he will let you stay?”
“Severus is telling me some very stressing news - Tom has cut off communication with him, after ex-communicating the Malfoy’s.”
Luckily Draco didn’t have to walk far, and he was escorted to Beta Madam Pomfrey in the medical ward for the second time in two days. She rolled her eyes and rushed him to a bed to take his stats - he stuck his tongue out as instructed for her wand to inspect his temperature and he coughed as she stethascope’d his back.
The rest of them, however, went straight to gorge on the feast lain out on rows of black floating tables across the other side of the Great Hall.
“I know. I understand.” Draco’s tone was stoney, and he subtly glanced to his left, expecting to see Harry cut by his absence of emotion. But to his secret surprise, Harry was looking at him with a stern brow and tense jaw, resolved like a military soldier.
But Draco’s mild unease from the unwanted attention would soon burgeon to panic, when he seemed to be the only one who noticed the Slytherin Head of House seize up and flee the room, while clutching at his right arm tightly through his sleeve.
And then, as if on cue, as it landed, all the perfectly lined bottles started to shake. Albus lurched forward to save the few that knocked over, freezing them with a quick spell before they could have the chance to roll away and shatter. The stained windows overseeing the school grounds were not so lucky, and burst into a colourful, fine dust.
“Get up, you lazy queen. We’re going out.” Blaise ordered, throwing Draco a pair of lightweight white robes.
Fenrir began to walk, but it didn’t bother Bellatrix as she began stroking the hair on Draco’s forehead from temple to temple, easily shadowing the Werewolf’s long steps from behind as she did. She spoke to Draco as if he was in a vegetative state, dumb and vacant.
Moaned Myrtle, hovering around the ceiling. The ghost was filling the loo with a soft, eery weep - Draco rolled his eyes, he could see right through her, both literally and figuratively.
Harry ducked lower in his chair. Maybe talking about asking out the most hated boy in school to the dance wasn’t the wisest thing right now.
Occasionally, much to Draco’s displeasure, he and Snape would still make eye contact. Sometimes while he interacted with his friends, sometimes even from across the hall, as Draco topped up his goblet of Eyeball Juice ( - the eyeballs long since shrivelled and unblinking from the corroding levels of spiked booze).
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Get over yourself. I’m right, aren’t I? You must not have actually been in heat when you did it, we can wait for when it comes around again. We do it once and you can enjoy more tolerable mateship with someone you can stand to be in a room with for more than five minutes, plus if it’s alright with you I’d prefer to see other people after it’s done.”
Draco could feel two hundred eyes cast to him at once. He sat still with an impassive look on his face, revealing nothing. From where he sat he could see Hufflepuff and Gryffndor’s table be home to a lovely range of expressions – anger, suspicion, fear of the unknown.
“Why? Surely you’d be teachers pet more than ever. Head Alpha’s favourite.” Adrian said from a nearby chair, wiping his lip free of spilt liquor.
“I’m being given until tomorrow to say who I’m going to let bugger me and make me theirs for… life, probably.” Back at Grimmauld Draco had naively assumed it may have only been until school ended, but now with the added issue of being an emotionally-triggered explosive it was likely going to be his reality until he eventually died - or until he ripped out the part of his brain that gave him emotions. A
Draco stormed off into the portal Sirius gestured towards, and to his dismay the motorbike was indeed parked at the last step outside the train terminal. He barely registered the helmet being thrown at him from Sirius at the top step, the weight of it nearly knocking Draco off his feet.
And then, it dawned on Draco, this girl was an Omega. He could smell her now the more agitated she got. She must have been on pheromone suppressants for a very long time for Draco to be so blind of it. Potter’s weird behaviour was starting to make sense, and he looked up at the taller boy to find him looking rigid and nervous. How many were there really in this school? Including himself, so far there were three, out of nearly 300 students.
It’s vitally important that it runs successfully. This is our opportunity to put the students minds at ease even just for a single evening. With everything that has happened we owe it to the children of Hogwarts. You both know more than anyone that Voldemort -“ He ignored Draco’s wince “ - looms nearer. His plot will be complete any month now. We need peace in this school more than ever.”
They had a stand off for a few seconds. Intense, youthful grey eyes against cold, calculating black - the unstoppable force against the immovable object.
“Oh…” He whimpered out. As he arched his back and tilted his neck to the side, a drop of drool escaped and it dribbled across his cheek, disappearing into the pillow.
“Aren’t you clever.” He jeered, revealing his right hand. Along the palm lines stood out a pink wand induced scar.
Draco tried to shove Niffler aside at the face, but the skin on it’s cheek was like elastic, old leather. The only thing that moved were it’s eyes bulging from its sockets.
They are. “People can also be interested in what you have to say, there’s not much of a conversation happening between you and these guys.”
But despite that feeble moment of peace when he saw their blue-toned uniforms, Draco already had a very bad feeling about today’s class. As they all pooled into the room, his sense of dread amplified when his Head of House snuck a hateful look his way. The question on his mind now was what could Snape possibly do to Draco today that was any worse than yesterday? Draco already knew: a lot. There was a lot the older Alpha could do if he wanted to scare Draco senseless. If he wanted the boy to leave there was a lot more up this sleeve he had yet try.
“I don’t want to lose my freedom,” Draco bit out, sounding closer now, like he’d moved right up to the door.
Draco caught it with his left hand, the hand that was only moments ago in his dreams torn to a bloody stump.
-  person - and Harry could only imagine how Draco would react if he actually bothered to read this.
Draco ran his hands through his hair. Maybe this was why he didn’t visit, he was getting too old for her bullshit.
“My Lord, forgive me…” She heard herself weep out, she could taste the salt of her tears dilute the metal tang overwhelming her tongue (intact, it seemed). “I feared for my son, but I would never wish to slight you. We have been nothing but faithful, your judgement has always been clarity…” She bowed her head straight to the floor, her forehead burnt from the cool touch of the kitchen tiles. A perfect image of submission, all potential expressions of defiance vaporised in one swift move. She felt her hair pooling around her, curtaining her expression of shame and hiding the shake in her shoulders.
Without asking permission he propped Draco up on a desk like he was a child, but the boy chose to tolerate the gesture, too distracted with his flood of tears to care. Instead he waited for the eventual question the Alpha would ask him:
“So what do you reckon I should do? Because I don’t exactly want to bond. I’m not ready yet,” he said.
The other boy struggled to swallow as he continued. “Not even the worst part. He nearly killed him with a curse once he was done with him. If you ask me I dunno’ why the pompous bastard gets to stay and that Hufflepuff kid gets the boot.”
Then a pop went off as the pygmy puff’s head burst open into a cloud of stuffing. Draco let go and it fell into a heap of pink fuzz and white internal stuffing.
“That’s a good boy,” Dumbledore said, now taking a stand and reaching a long arm across the desk, cupping Draco’s warm cheek. “Everyone must make a sacrifice.”
“I have to ask you something, Myrtle… Have you seen Luna Lovegood today? Does she come here at all? Would you know where she normally goes?”
also please dont take my drawings as literal interpretations of the story, i just like to illustrate. ;)
“You process things like a sore loser. Look at yourself for god’s sake!” She put one hand on her hip and waved the other in his presence. “You haven’t re-spelled your hair tidy in hours! You still haven’t gotten out of those muggle rags —"
This whole thing had been absolute torture, his brain was now tingling with the oncoming threat of a migraine in response to the strain on his body. It was unnatural for an Alpha to deny his purpose this way, and Draco was the most unusual, unnatural Omega Sirius had ever had the (mis)fortune of meeting. All of this wouldn’t have had been necessary if he bonded properly, on the day of his heat, with a worthy Alpha, who could have helped him subdue his magic
“Evenin’ Hogwarts, we’re the Hex Girls. Lovely t’make your acquaintances,” whispered a dark haired Witch in red, heard only by the amplification of an oddly bulbous silver wand.
“I’m sure you’ll listen to this… I thought you should know that I had offered Draco my services during his heat.”
“I haven’t thought much about it… I might just get Pansy to come up with something for the both of us.”
They were the decoration designs planned for the 31st. It was basically an analysis of several edited enchantments or new spells, factually detailing their effects on the aesthetic, mood, lighting, sound, and overall experience of a party. The young Malfoy didn’t play around when it came to thrilling guests. He had spent years shadowing his mother when she would host - he had witnessed first-hand how to organise things from the simplest five course brunch to an all black-robe function for his father and his
“Hmm… Perhaps Draco?” His professor said, his sinister motive as obvious as the sun in the middle of the afternoon. The man was practically toying with him.
He looked back down at himself, at his hands. He needed an explanation. He needed answers. How was he able to perform such intense magic without a spell in mind, let alone a wand in hand.
“Or, I could go as the plague you eventually die from.” Draco retorted, voice mild, but he was smiling wide enough to feel a sliver of teeth expose.
The Beta girl hummed and stroked his fine blond hair, if Draco could purr he would. “Midnight maybe? Everyone went to bed only ten minutes ago so not that late.”
But before they could make it onto the covered bridge between the castle grounds and the station town, Pansy was nudging Draco hard in the side. She was looking elsewhere, Draco had to follow her line of sight to see what was getting her so thrilled.
She met with the other Alpha the night before the semester would start, she was already planning to have Severus swear his loyalty to her son regardless. The original plan was to Mark Draco as a Death Eater, later he would be the set in motion to their plan to infiltrate the castle. To kill Dumbledore, Harry Potter, and all traitors. She would have had the man help Draco in his mission any way he could, but now it was to just save him, any way he could. She knew that meant he had to be sent away from the school by any means necessary, each day that passed meant the Dark Lord was ever nearer to unleashing his expanding army. Greyback had recovered and was retrieved from prison by Yaxley, who were both now sitting in her chairs in front of her, eating the food lain out by her house elves. The wolfish man noticed her looking at him and gave a wide, sharp smile.
The serious problem was this was the first time since Grimmauld Place that Draco had been in so close a proximity to Potter for longer than thirty minutes. He could smell him
“Hiya,” Potter said nonchalantly, he was rocking back on his scuffed school shoes, hands stuffed deep into his trouser pockets.
Draco could only stare in stunned silence, his heart was sinking so suddenly he nearly felt the urge to vomit again. Everyone gladly took the cue to take their own things and put on their robes. He stayed in his seat a few seconds longer, nodding to Pansy and Blaise and the rest of the Slytherins as they skulked out. Draco felt like he needed to drop his head onto his desk. Uninterrupted.
That he would continue to follow Dumbledore’s orders. He sat, quiet as a shadow, and listened out for any signs of magical use.
Questionably he could still smell Sirius, but he wasn’t sure if he was there. No one called back out to him, so - assuming he was alone - he endeavoured to continue…
Draco smiled at him then, a surprised but genuine thing. It made his pale eyes glitter. Sirius wanted to kiss it, to taste the unforgettable sweetness and to revel in another heated moment not unlike that time before the start of school term - the secret kiss in Draco’s bedroom.
“Mr. Malfoy, stay behind.” Severus called out, as the flood of Gryffindor and Slytherin students bottlenecked the only door in the classroom.
for God’s sake. Think about your power. Think about your control. Think about your influence on others.”
“Sorry, what?” Draco blinked, trying to back-peddle on the conversation he had only been half-listening to.
Out from the darkness came Fenrir Greyback, not the Dark Lord. The smell of rot and pure Alpha musk creeped towards Draco from where the werewolf was standing.
If only he’d brought a book, he was going to have a tough time having no one to talk to for the train ride.
-looking worms wriggled in the frosting, and Draco couldn’t avoid the nauseous gulp visually rolling through his throat. He’d pass.
“Draco, what’s happening?” Pansy said frustratedly, she dropped the magazine back at its place on top. “You’re an Omega, so what? No one’s treated you any different in Slytherin. We love you. But we feel like you’re ashamed of us. Clearly you’re doing this for Loony - why? Why aren’t you telling me anything?” She was beginning to cry, her mascara running down her face in black streaks. “I - I just want things to go back to normal. Do you hate me, Draco? Have I upset you?”
Blaise looked down at Pansy - he towered her by almost a head and a half, he was already ridiculously tall and she was a little shorter than the average girl - there was a funny expression on his face… like he was constipated, or hungry, or a lot more hungover than Draco himself. “Who’re you going with Pansy?”
I want to try to see if I can handle this problem on my own, at least. I need to believe it’s possible. You’re a damned teacher!
Draco unclasped his hands to wave off the subject. Feeling embarrassed that he’d exposed more of his personal feelings than he would have liked to.
In the smoke, Harry could make out a red light glowing, and growing in intensity, and reacted by thrusting his body to the side, just in time to watch a curse hurl from it. No one was given an opportunity to wonder about its effects, as it slammed a student into the wall - hard enough you could see his chest concave - or its origin, as a legion of masked Death Eaters marched out of the smoulder.
Before he could realise what was going on, Draco’s feet carried him towards her. His body must have known he had questions.
Harry doesn’t ask if Draco’s sure, Draco wouldn’t be here if he wasn’t, instead, Harry puts his hand on Draco’s hip, looking into Draco’s eyes, finding it easier to breathe when he does. Draco nods his head, eyes on Harry’s own, emotion swimming in his grey-lined hues, and suddenly Harry’s heart is three sizes too big for his chest.
“That’s the thing. I don’t know what’s wrong!” Harry exclaimed, throwing his arms up in distress. He mumbled the last part, quieter. “I can just feel it.”
“They just don’t…respect me?” Harry started, adding quickly, “Not that they have to! I just figured that since they’re my
Harry retaliated, not quite seeing that coming. It seemed as if everything finally clicked into piece; the way the ginger had always acted towards him, the small things he did for him. It all made sense. Man, was he oblivious. “You…like me?”
“I think,” Draco started, letting his breath catch up to him. He took a deep breath in before letting it out.
“How’d you find this place?” Draco asked, fiddling with the plastic wrap on a random sandwich he had grabbed.
"Sure, why not?" Harry said, shrugging. "It's a bit of a private place, not many know about it. And you always look good to me." His cheeky smile making Draco’s heart flutter. He looked away, his face making tomatoes pale in comparison.
“Draco. I get it. With all this going on in your head, it’s a wonder how you’ve managed on your own for this long.” Harry murmured into the blonde hair, “I know I couldn’t.”
“I know,” Harry spoke a little too quickly, making Draco’s face heat up again. “It was Pansy’s idea.”
"It's fine," Harry cut him off quickly, "I understand. It can be hard sometimes. Especially after, you know… seeing someone who doesn't turn out to be 'the one.'"
Alyssa came over with their drinks, evidently saving Draco from having to respond. She wiggled her eyebrows once, making Draco roll his eyes and smile despite himself. He took his lemon-flavored iced tea and sipped determinedly, narrowing his eyes at the waitress. She merely giggled, took their orders for food and left again.
"Scared, Malfoy?" Hermione teased, though he knew she was joking. He nodded, not feeling up to giving his usual retort. The girls shared a worried look again; something was terribly wrong. Even on his worst days he'd at least give them a curt 'fuck off,' "I was joking."
The blonde left his house, hopping into his silver car and driving the short distance to school. He pulled into the parking lot, cutting the engine. Draco paused momentarily, wondering just how much things would change since Friday. He took a deep breath in through his nose and let it out slowly; this was it.
Even though Harry hurt him, he couldn’t help but miss him. They were together every day, hardly separated but for classes they didn’t share, and the past ten days they’ve been apart. Yes, Draco was counting.
The crisp air grew colder as they lay there, though neither of them really cared. However, they knew that they would eventually have to leave.
Harry’s heart clenched in jealousy, but he held it back, knowing he was thinking irrationally. It’s bound to be a hard topic for the blonde to talk about.
Harry walked through the school hallways, an abnormally large smile on his face. He received some weird looks, only slightly different than the usual, but he couldn't care less. He was actually
Harry looked away from the blonde’s eyes, looking up at the bright moon illuminating them. “Because I’m a fucking idiot. Why did I come here? My friends could care less if I came or not. In fact, I haven’t seen any of them all night. Except…you know.”
Harry feels hope, the treacherous thing, and it scares him. He focuses on the feeling of Draco’s cock inside him and hot breath over him instead.
“I can hear you think from here,” Malfoy says, breaking Harry away from his spiraling thoughts. The other man kicks at Harry with his socked foot. “It’s driving me mad, spit it out already.”
A flash of hurt crosses Theo’s face before he slips on the infamous Slytherin mask. “He’ll never love you,” he says, eyes on Harry, but it’s Draco who answers with, “I know.”
“Are you sure?” Draco’s pushing the hair out of Harry’s face and suddenly Harry’s never been more sure of anything else in his life — he tells Draco just as much, who then starts to thrust agonisingly slow inside of Harry.
Heard about your acquittal. Congrats to you and your family for getting off, once again, without having to serve time in Azkaban.
. Harry feels a familiar heat crawl its way down his body and he gladly parts his legs further, moving closer to the man before him.
Harry has a few guesses of what could have hurt Draco so terribly, scarred him so drastically. Harry has his own wounds, his own monstrosities he has tried to bury over and again. Maybe the relief he feels is found in the recently learned truth that they can come together like this, vulnerable, afraid, falling easily into one another; in love, all the same. Harry falls asleep pondering, Draco’s even breathing a soft tickle against the hairs of his chest.
“You’re the only person I’ve ever seen hold their own against Blaise, I don’t know how you’re even alive right now.” Malfoy exhales through his nose and hands the spliff to Harry; their fingers touch, Malfoy’s hands radiate heat. Harry feels too cold all of a sudden.
he thinks. Tentative peace between former school rivals doesn’t make a truce, and pent-up homoeroticism doesn’t fix the shattered glass remains of a past that pierce into the delicate, newly healed skin of the present.
Harry moves for his wand, lubes up a finger but then Draco’s grabbing his wand and saying, “There’s a spell –
“S’alright, I think I’m starting to speak their language,” Neville shrugs, eyes glittering as he watches Nott over his butterbeer.
Draco stops right in front of Harry, hand outstretched before him, clasped in Dean’s firm grip. “Nice face, Potter,” Draco says, bringing his thumb to Harry’s lip, brushing against the split he left there, making him shiver. Draco’s more beat up looking than Harry, his left cheekbone and eye are painted a blueish purple and there’s a nasty looking scrape on his forehead right at his hairline.
and undoing the button on his trousers. Draco’s hard and there’s a wet spot on his pants as he wiggles out of his trousers and lays down onto the bed, pulling Harry on top of him.
Harry has to bury his head into Draco’s shoulder, trying to keep focus on his goal of making Draco come. He wants it so badly, feels mad with the desire to make Draco feel as good as he does Harry.
Harry turns his head; he hadn’t known that about Malfoy. “But do they think it’s weird that, y’know, you and I are smoking?” After a beat Harry adds, “Together, I mean.”
“Harry!” Hermione rises to her feet. “Parkinson and Zabini have both said that they saw you take the drugs, that you took it with ease every time they saw you using, and that you were encouraging him to use alongside you. Even Moaning Myrtle says she saw you snorting Pixie Dust in her bathroom!”
Theo makes them dinner, but he doesn’t stay to share it with them. Pansy and Draco sit at the small kitchen table, and he wonders if something is wrong with him, wonders if it’s wrong to feel loved the most when he’s angry at his best friends – anger, a disastrous thing, but human, nonetheless. What does it mean to be loved through anger? Draco wonders, if perhaps, the most potent form of love is a love that does not waver in the face of anger. A love that gives you space. A love where you can still touch, even when in the throes of a disastrous fury.
“What do you mean?” Her golden brow furrowed. Draco tried to read her, to see if there was even the slightest glint of secret understanding. He didn’t want to be on the end of giving away too much information to the wrong people. Her face was just sweetly baffled.
With a flick of his wrist, Dumbledore’s wand glowed and it casted a charm that started his music machine, which Draco was beginning to pick up meant that the man was likely going to talk about something serious.
“I don’t want to be kept in a cage just because people don’t understand me. Ever since I presented people have either been afraid for me or of me. No one seems to give me a straight answer about why I can’t control my magic. All people tell me to do is bond! Bond to Potter! Bond, bond,
Nearly two months had gone by since she last saw her beloved son. She couldn’t even write letters to him in case they got intercepted by a subservient Death Eater.
Draco stood on a rock at the lakes shore, the stones beneath his bare feet were slimy with moss and algae. He welcomed the soft salty breeze that rustled his hair and clothes.
“Yes, so I’ll say goodbye to you now. Thanks for your help.” She leant in and kissed him on the cheek.
Sirius understood responsibilities. He understood the role he played when Dumbledore had him sent to Azkaban for twelve years.
“He didn’t… have anything to do with that.” Draco admitted. He cast his silver eyes down at his petite, pale hands, turning them back and forth distractedly. Severus could easily imagine the inner conflict his pretty blond head was brewing - debating over how honest he should be, if he was to tell the truth would Snape use this as his opportunity to remove Draco from school. It would practically be giving him the win. Would lying even work? It’s not as if Draco never lied to the man before, but Snape was like a bloodhound, and any slip up was a drop of blood in the grass. There have been many lies Draco had told Severus that were shortly after found out about.
Everything’s like some bloody soap opera with you.” His Alpha temper was rising and he rubbed his black hair in frustration.
Satisfied, the taller boy opened the map and offered the blank, yellowing parchment up to Draco. “Do you remember?”
“Yeah. You haven’t once shown interest and It’s not like you’ve stopped using suppressants so I know it’s not my allure that’s brought you here to my bed with no one else around.”
Draco stared at it gravely for a few a seconds, but couldn’t say a response in time as Potter walked in with Eleanor, Romilda, and Augustus. In the corner of his eye Draco could see her quickly roll her sleeve back down and press her arms together by her side, flustered and embarrassed in the presence of the Alpha. Potter only tipped Draco with an acknowledging nod, not quite over his resentment from two days ago.
“They’re everywhere, but you need to know how to look.” Luna said desperately, it was like she could tell she was being made fun of but couldn’t help herself by endeavouring to enlighten others. She cast her bright blue eyes to Draco, searching for sanctuary. Draco averted his gaze.
also hey hey hey ya fav boy sirius is back ;) <3 but fear not everyone i can assure u this is and always was going to be a drarry fic so u just get to sit back and see how that eventually unfolds.
, remembering who his masters are. You always will, won’t you?” Bellatrix cooed to him, twirling the stolen wand in his face. She seem pleased with Draco’s lack of response, mistaking frozen terror for subdued obedience.
Draco did, he dug his fingers into his robe’s inside pocket for his wand. Once out, he rested the tip of it against crumpled page. “I solemnly swear… That I am up to no good.”
There was a sound of shuffling, of things being moved and knocked over, he heard the sound of what ever Draco drank going down his throat, and the constant stream of moans, curses, and weary, incoherent ramblings. His dog-sensitive ears picked up every single detail, and it predictably sent wave after wave of arousal straight to his cock and balls. He was a simple man, and sounds of an eager, inexperienced Omega could’ve wiped out anyone.
It might have been a trick of the light, but Harry was beginning to make out glowing silver eyes inside the burning embers of the fire. Harry’s face and neck was heating up from the proximity
also pansy is my absolute baby i love her ok always cracked me up in the books her bullying was so painfully 90's british school girl
And then the elf Disapparated, whisking Draco off with it from the dungeons, leaving behind only the echo of a crack of lightning.
“We should charge now, tonight,” Bellatrix said eagerly, heat crawled up her neck at the thought of battle, at the easy slaughtering of weak children, all to please him. Her exhaustion be damned. “We shouldn’t be giving them any more time, strike now and kill them all.”
He swished his wand wordlessly and the jumper glimmered for a few seconds before warping into a similarly coloured muggle t-shirt, now less snug and thick, the bottom hem cropped enough to expose the tiniest sliver of white skin.
As the boy struggled with an on-coming wave of sleep vertigo as soon as he was standing, the elf was swishing his finger in the air, summoning Draco’s robes and personal things,
“No there’s lots to talk about,” she said pleasantly. As if to make her point she tossed a crumb to a nearby snowy owl, it almost looked like Potter’s except for the darker grey colour. “Isn’t that right, Wedges?”
Draco stared at him for what felt like a very long time, Blaise carefully kept an ear out for intruders to give the other boy time to think. He didn’t understand the wait, he felt like he had surely explained things clearly enough for the other Slytherin, it was an undeniable win for everyone. Blaise wasn’t prepared for the puff of a laugh, and despite a shadow hiding most of the blond’s face you couldn’t mistake the smirk. “So who would you choose to be with if not with little me? I don’t suppose you have a thing for Pansy, do you?”
The next song was slow, and the rainbow of lights faded blue. It made the room feel a little colder, and together they held each other a little tighter because of it. Draco’s hands were on Harry’s chest plate, Harry’s gauntlet clad hands linked together at the small of Draco’s back.
The Alpha snorted, it sounded like a short, unhappy growl at the back of his throat. He bared his teeth briefly before hiding them with his thin lip.
He wrongfully convinced himself that their punishment was over, and began to stand. Dumbledore put his hand up as an order to remain seated.
Snape leaned back a little bit, observing him down the length of his nose very carefully. He didn’t say a word, so Draco assumed he had to keep talking.
The bedroom Draco found his luggage in was a far cry from the bright and modern design of his own. Its sitting furniture had dark, bog-green upholstery with black and silver thread designs unlike the powder blues and white he remembered in the Manor. The bed was smaller than his own with a canopy so black it reminded him of a funeral veil.
hope the writing is coherent enough! just trying to give you the feel of the book while also being as fanficy as possible
He couldn’t believe what he was about to do, and struggled to squash the self-deprecating shame taking over his thoughts.
“What do you have there?” Cawed a woman, her head popped into view just beside Fenrir’s shoulder, curiously peering down with two pitch-black eyes. Long, tangled black hair framed a thin face, and black robes creeped up the length of a long neck, cutting off just below the jawline. He recognised her then, It was his auntie. “Oh, the traitor! Oh, don’t you look handsome. So
“No - not like - I mean like… Like being my boyfriend? Y’know, whatever I’d call you if you said yes to a date with me.”
“I can handle it by myself.” Draco tried to say confidently, but his mouth betrayed him and he only managed to whisper the words out.
“Pfft.” The shorter girl snorted and squawked out a laugh, she still seemed shaken but was doing her best to hide it. “You wish, my love. I’ll see you later. I’m almost certain there’s a chocolate cake in the kitchen with my name in frosting.”
“Why hasn’t Dumbledore asked to speak with me?” Questions about it swirled in his head, distracting him in classes until he was screwing up easy tasks. Was he in trouble? Had the Headmaster been more unhappy with Draco’s demands than he let on? The fear of not-knowing was making each night harder to sleep. The elder Alpha wouldn’t even meet his eye during meal times, not once. It was more unsettling than he’d like to admit.
“I - er - I’m not quite so sure…” Harry let out. He felt so stupid, why was speaking suddenly so difficult.
Potter’s mouth went slack as he stared down at Draco’s wand pressed bruisingly tight into the flesh of his hand, the tan skin taught and going white.
if you guys cant already tell i just really like drawing draco lmao 🤣idk if i started writing this story just so i could use it as an excuse who knows! either way i also really like writing too and its fun to use both as a tool to express the story. also please feel free to give feed back on the story my way - i do have an overall goal im trying to get to but i do change things up when i get inspired by other peoples vision for the story too.
“Do you…need me?” Sirius said after a while, the question was heavy with several meanings, and the Alpha had finished it on a desperate tone.
“Hey, Parkinson,” Blaise interrupted before Draco could respond. “Do you mind giving Draco and I a minute alone? We need a moment man-to-man.”
For the last few days the boy had been intentionally trying to forget their after-class meeting from a week ago.
As the train stirred to life and began to edge out of the terminal, Draco watched Sirius on the platform. The man looked as if an idea struck him, and he crumbled to the floor and disappeared into his clothes, only to emerge back out as a shaggy black dog. Draco gasped and pressed his hands into the cool glass to get a better look - Sirius seemed to notice the reaction and hopped around in a circle with a paw raised, long tail wagging.
“I can’t be the only one that’s going to be taking this train… Am I?” Draco asked, looking around for any other passengers.
for Sirius Black?” Draco said, baffled and blushing hard. In the moment he was shamefully reminding himself of his mother’s old cat. She would wriggle and squirm like Draco was in Harry’s arms whenever someone would dare pick her up and pet her. She was a mean thing, black with piercing blue eyes.
A grunt escaped his lips and he let his frustrations control his actions. He rocked on the toy like he was a fearsome animal, hoping his wildness would result in gouging the thing deeper inside him.
He took a self-assuring breath and threw his own school bag down onto the clearest space on the floor, sitting himself delicately down. “So anyway, as I was saying. I need your help.”
Despite the obvious signs of need, he wouldn’t touch himself. He felt like that wouldn’t be respectful. He remained hard throughout the night, as if in solidarity to Draco. Besides, he was here at the request of Dumbledore - to keep an ear out for any problems. This wasn’t for him, and he had a job to complete, he wouldn’t let himself get distracted by something like this.
“Same for yourself,” Draco said softly, as if he was contemplating something serious. He looked up, and he stared into the stormy grey eyes, a few shades darker than his own. He focused on the Alpha’s scent for clarity…Sweat, metal, oil, tea leaves, fresh bread…. He reached up, and straightened the crooked woolly collar, patting it gently down, and then slowly ran his palms over the man’s solid chest, as if to smooth out the creases in his shirt, down to his belly, stopping just before the belt and pulling away.
It seemed like it was only a matter of time before he was going to eventually be ripped away from the man.
Draco could make out a light burning brightly in front of him through his sealed eyes. He still didn’t open them, not sure if he was ready to release what he couldn’t explain. If Professor Snape was talking, Draco couldn’t hear, because there was that ever-familiar roar, like wind shooting out of the opening of an active volcano.
As he continued back to Draco, he proudly looked down at the fruits of his labour. He’d managed to arrange a colourful display of some of the things he’s seen Draco eat during his stay only two months ago - he wasn’t sure how picky the boy would be and wanted to play it safe. The tray was nearly at capacity with bowls of berries, oats, a plate of pancakes with syrup, decorated with plum slices, and even a lemon tart. The things on it were all a bit too sweet for Sirius’ liking, but he still couldn’t help but delight in the skill of his culinary magic.
“The Malfoy boy?” Shouted someone from the other end of the hall, possibly Yaxley or Rodolphus, having heard Bellatrix. “Bring him to the Lord alive!”
“Hey…” Harry said slowly, he was speaking too slowly. Draco wasn’t a baby, he wasn’t fragile or stupid. He wasn’t just going to go break. But… The more he was treated like he was nothing more than some delicate, unintelligent insect the harder it was for Draco to convince himself otherwise. He felt his throat shrink up, making it hard for him to breathe, let alone say any words.
it came down in a heavy, impenetrable sheet that Draco watched from his bedroom’s window seat. Behind him his clothes were packed in a modestly sized trunk, there was the rushed patter of his parents footsteps running up and down the halls, he could hear the house elves apparating and disapparating erratically to complete whatever tasks they were set to before it was time.
Then, with great force, something struck Draco in the back of the head faster than he could react, letting darkness rush in.
He took a test draw of his pipe, then lit it until smoke bellowed out of his mouth. Tendrils of the smoke escaped the Floo fire, as if it came from the coals, but Sirius could smell the tobacco in it.
Draco was probably never going to be able to look at Harry in the face again. Did he have to take it that far? Was it worth it?
“Um… Okay, if you’re sure,” Draco wasn’t totally comfortable with the idea, not liking the odds of her bumping into someone who wanted to give her trouble. But he couldn’t really stop her, and she was right, they would cover more ground this way. He didn’t want to spend all night doing handouts with the girl. “Once I’m done I just head off then?”
“Oh okay…” The freckled boy gulped, clutching it in his sweaty hands and shuffling away backwards. The small, fat boy awkwardly turned after he was out of arms reach and walked towards the stairs.
- they were all the memories that caused Draco the most suffering, which fuelled his supernatural power.
She stared out the window, and prayed to whoever would listen that her Draco remain safe, and as far away from this house as possible.
After carelessly disposing the empty bottle on the floor, he climbed back onto the bed and curled his body around the sex toy in his arms - it was so thick and large it could pass off as a small prosthetic leg. He squeezed it into his chest for a pathetic attempt at comfort; its round head pressed into his tear stained cheek. He had no idea how he was going to use it, but he knew the Omega in him was yearning for it. His sex between his legs spasmed and clenched for something to fill it, and his cock lay hard and ready to explode against his leg. He’d long removed his pyjama bottoms, finding them useless when they’d be drenched with slick in under five minutes. Even now, on the spot he lay over the padded bed cover, was soaked through with the endless trickle coming out of him. He had to avoid moving too much, nauseated by the sounds of the squelching mattress.
But now, in the firm but warm hold he could feel the tension bleed from his body, as if it was being absorbed into the other. Soon Draco was mimicking Harry’s calm breathing, and they were in sync, filling the quiet of the classroom with the soothing sound.
” He nudged her shoulder, careful to avoid the dangling goat head attached to her neck. “If you’re so worried just don’t have any, or do, and enjoy the night. Either way don’t care so much.
!” Screeched the Dark Lord, whipping the fabric out of her hands, sending her toppling backwards and into the legs of her husband, who knelt down slightly to clasp at her shoulders. Once she was up she bowed her head in an apologetic way. Such an action was once unnatural, for a powerful Alpha like herself, for all three of them, to cower in the presence of a single simple Beta. But Lord Voldemort was no average Beta, he was no average Wizard. He defied nature. He was a phenomenon unlike anything seen before in existence, a real-life thing of nightmares that wanted to consume anything unworthy of being in its presence.
“Oh little bird,” The voice growled, the same sound that haunted his deepest, darkest nightmares. “Where are you?”
At first glance, he liked them. He felt his cheeks flush a little in self-approval. He made a quick trip to the adjacent bathroom just outside the compartment and admired them in the mirror. He posed, twisting his back to stare in fascination at the pure lewdness of them. They hugged his bum in a way his robes never could, the stitching ran in a subtle heart shape along the contours of where his cheeks were, accentuating the roundness of it. He
Neither of them offered a glance to the other, both determined to stare out into the crowd. Draco could easily make out Luna, dressed as a butterfly, with a goblet of punch in her hand, sniffing it with a mystified gaze.
“Warblers?” Pansy shrieked with delight, looking around with her hands cupping her eyes, like a pair of imaginary binoculars. “Where?”
“Luna if you already knew it was me why didn’t you say anything?” Draco rested his forehead on his knees, sometimes he wanted to strangle the girl.
interested in was finding help - but a question kept coming back around like an overzealous race hound: who was going to do it?
The party had died down by now. It was just Pansy and Draco left to drunkenly cuddle on the sofa. Pansy was resting her head in Draco’s lap, who was running his fingers through her silky jet black hair to clean out the silver streamers. It was straighter than Harry’s, and not as thick. Draco realised just then that he’d never actually run his hands through Harry’s hair before.
“Listen, Malfoy - Draco. Can you just…” Harry began gravely, his new expression created a slight wrinkle above his brow. “…Wait a second? Please? Just… hear me out, for a moment. I won’t be long.”
The hall was fully festooned with floating pumpkins, enchanted bats, orange streamers, water snakes, dancing skeletons, and the ceiling’s usual illusion of nightly stars was replaced with glittering spiders. Harry had even suggested they change the House banners, which were now reflecting a more ‘
“I never actually had to go through the same problem that you have to. I’ve heard about it, and read about it, even my dad told me what it was like, my mum went through it. It’s how she died. He said it’s supposed to come from your amygdala, in the limbic system of your brain. It’s where all your emotionally charged memories get stored, and it’s where you’re most active in the brain when you lose control of your magic. That’s basically how first Wizards divided things. Alphas controlled logic and physical strength and Omegas controlled emotions and magical strength. But… I don’t really understand emotions very well… I never have…” She put the juice box away and was running her fingers through her curled pigtails, looking nervous. “No ones ever really been interested in me anyway. I like it, though. I’m not interested in others like that. This way I know that the people who do talk to me only want to for me and not because of anything else.”
or to find Dumbledore and see if things were going to be okay, but the ideas fizzled from his mind as soon as a gauntlet-clad hand placed itself on his shoulder, slowly pulling him around.
There was also something else bothering the boy about the situation, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. His skin was quickly growing flushed, rushing up his neck in a single second, the burn tingling in his cheeks.
Harry quickly managed enough of a grip then on Draco to wrestle his back to the floor completely. He settled on top of him, holding both his two squirming wrists in his own much larger hand.
The cold air against his throbbing genitals still couldn't relieve him, and in a last act of desperation, he mewled out into the emptiness of the room,
He had two unfortunate choices - he could either run and get caught, or wait and be found. Draco had limited time to choose. He didn’t know how many Death Eaters there were, his nose wasn’t attuned enough to smell in numbers, but the smell - a fermented, rancid concoction of spoilt pheromones - was too great to only come from one Alpha.
Draco shooed her away from the table and hushed her before a teacher could notice her hysterics. “Shut up, it’s fine. Be none the wiser and let others waste their booze if they want. Dumbledore’s not so stupid to think that Seventh Years wouldn’t sneak in
“Just… processing things.” Draco said slowly, and Pansy reluctantly let go of his face. The other Slytherins remained huddled around the table by the fire place, not pausing their game, but without a doubt they were hanging onto every word.
“Okay. On the condition you be my date to the ball. I wanted to do something nice together for once, and maybe… show you off?” Potter was rubbing his neck, it was a wonder how the damned thing wasn’t rubbed raw by now.
“Oh - fuck… Oh!” He mumbled deliriously to himself, eyes rolling back. He tossed his head back and forth as if he was destined for the insane asylum, damp platinum hair was swinging against his forehead and eyes. “
Draco must of had a lot on his mind to keep his head down like that, not registering he had just walked past his Alpha. He stunk of Snape - which got his blood boiling - and he had to remind himself to wipe away the sneer on his lip before he could call out:
The stool was the perfect tool to keep Sirius as uncomfortable as possible, to keep himself from dozing off. He also kept himself busy with pointless activities to make the time go by, like counting the balusters of the stairs both leading up and down the first floor,
“Mm…What train?” Draco turned over, away from the prodding hands, and wrapped himself tighter in his sheets.
The morning events haunted Draco, and he couldn’t help but feel glum all day in the Slytherin Common Room.
“Did she have you promise her?” Those pale eyes slipped down to Severus’s hidden palms. Severus could imagine what he must be thinking: a blood pact.
Draco didn’t like this at all. Not after everything. He wasn’t breathing anymore, only shuddering out a couple desperate gasps. He couldn’t hide and he couldn’t run away, he was trapped and bleeding and angry and surrounded by hundreds of people.
“Hey, I never got to find out, what were you going go as for Halloween?” Harry casually asked Draco, who was busy looking up deciding between spiderweb patterns.
She took hold of his wrist and lead him down towards the girls’ dormitories, the charm that once made the halls shrink when a boy dared journey through was disabled by students many decades ago, prefects never bothered to report it, and every Slytherin Head of House never cared enough to enforce a serious divide, except during Deloris’ short reign.
gasp! another omega !  i wanted to have someone in the younger years but i didnt want them to be in gryffindor (cough ginny sorry...)
The question made Draco’s heart pace quicken — He’d secretly thought about the question before, and recalled that his first heat was on the the 17th of July, and had taken a week of build up before it peaked and was over.
Lo-and-behold, however, as Harry sat down next to him where Adrian was sitting. He put his hand over Draco’s knee in what he could assume was meant to be comforting.
He wrenched the crown straight from his head with a jolt of his body, then tossed it to the ground, hard enough that if it were it glass it would have shattered, but the metal only bounced and flew off somewhere into the crowd - which reacted in unison with a startled cry.
“No, not really. I’ve just been trying to keep a better control of my emotions. Y’know, breathing techniques and things like that.”
With great difficulty he wrestled with the purple cock out of view again, blindly rotating it to be positioned at his aching hole. He pressed down on it to test his guess and gasped in shock when the round rubber head bore down on his asshole. He pulled back and repositioned it higher, this time meeting it more gently, and felt the head part the wet lips once more. He nudged it inside a centimetre against his hole before Draco finally felt resistance. His Omega sex couldn’t take the head, it clung to the curve but refused to budge.
“How much longer before I have Hogwarts,” he asked, instead of forgiving Bellatrix for her insolence. She trembled in anticipation for the moment he’d cast his wrath-some, god-like red gaze on her - Before anyone could answer him, a quick and loud pounding came from the closed door, followed by a gruff voice.
“Luna? Hey - “ Draco thrust the door open again and jogged up the stairs, gasping for air as he did;
Once Draco finally removed his hand and opened his eyes, it could be seen that some time had passed. The room was colder and the sun, last high and bright at around three in the afternoon, was positioned lower, indicating it was early evening now.
Draco felt a nervous trickle of sweat go down his back. He debated following before he could Disapperate,
He finally forced his eyes to open, only after he started to feel the fronts of his robes rustle from the miniature storm inside Snape’s study.
Since coming back to Hogwarts Draco had slipped back into the flow of things easily enough, and in a blur it was already Friday the 18th of October. They only had two weeks until the Halloween Ball.
. Get up, c’mon. Now, now!” Draco pulled the boy to his feet and without pausing Harry lunged forward, but still a foot apart, then offered his hand - which Draco considered, then eventually took - and lead the dance.
Draco had finished handing off the last tabloid to some fearful Second Year just outside of the Great Hall. Draco had shoved it into his chest, and sarcastically cheered “Congratulations! This is yours now.”
A couple of students screamed in horror when Potter lifted his head off the ground - his nose was a little swollen and blood had gushed down over his lips and chin. He looked like an absolute mess with his stunned face and crooked glasses.
.” He snaps his fingers for the immediate attention of his servants, ironically, Alphas. They drag her away, into her room, without her husband and wand. She was no longer in control of her own home.
“I’ll stick with the spiked punch, thanks.” He waved the goblet, swirling the glowing liquid and single blinking eyeball inside. He took another drink to make a point.
Draco was part of it last year, being a prefect. Along with the mud-blood Granger. He rarely went to the meetings when it wasn’t compulsory. He wasn’t offered the perfect position again this year, he hadn’t questioned it. He probably didn’t need the extra stress. These kids weren’t prefects anyway.
Draco didn’t know what he should do. He took a tentative step out of his ring of untouched stones. As soon as his toes came into contact with the blackened ground he had to whip the foot back - the sound of skin sizzling was indication enough to say it was way too hot.
If you had asked Draco that question two months ago, he would have laughed and taken the opportunity to say
The activity in the common room suddenly died down, and the whoosh of someone approaching from behind cooled down the back of Harry’s exposed neck.
Her laugh was muffled a bit by Draco’s hands cupping her cheeks, he gave her a fierce kiss to the forehead. “You stupid girl, I care so much about you. I want you to like Luna too. She’s actually kind of funny once you have a real conversation with her. Now, are you gonna help me hand these out?”
“You got pissed? Is that what I smelt off you in Snape’s first class?” Harry couldn’t help but laugh. Draco Bloody Malfoy, pissed on his first day of the semester? He didn’t know him as well as he thought.
Dumbledore concluded with a few unrelated announcements about the student council looking for volunteers to help with the Halloween ball preparations, something about class times changing, a thank you to the house elves’ hard work. He gave a sweeping gesture to the four tables and hundreds of plates of food appeared out of nothing.
Dumbledore had told the teachers to inform the students that… a dragon had flown by and sneezed over the castle.
It was late evening when Harry made his way up the spiralling staircase towards the Headmaster’s office. He was hoping the point of the meeting was to clue Harry as to how Draco was doing, or better yet when he would be back.
They crossed the bridge between Hogwarts’ grounds and Hogsmeade. Not one villager or storekeep was up yet, everything was shut and every window had their blinds drawn. After crossing through the town, the terminal could finally be made out down a cobblestoned slope, the steam train waiting for them at the platform, awake and pouring clouds of smoke from its chimney.
Sirius laughed, maybe a little too loudly, because instead of looking shy, Draco deadpanned, looking about as delicate as a prickling cat.
He was close to losing his mind. His cock felt like it would explode, and his cunt was dribbling non-stop, it made half his bed soaked, his night bottoms were five shades darker and sticking unpleasantly to his lower half. He tried to peel them off, and as he did strings of slick webbed the cotton fabric to his skin and a grotesque suction sound could be heard as he removed them.
“Between you and I? Mother would love it. If she found out I had a thing for Betas I’d probably lose the inheritance to my last three fathers.”
Draco hated people like that, the only person someone needed to be that senselessly loyal to was Draco himself. “Sparing my parents because he thinks I’m fit!”
Draco made some sort of non-committal grunt in the back of his throat, focusing on the papers he was shuffling into his book bag.
Not feeling hungry himself, he slowly absorbed in his surroundings, and as far as Draco was concerned, he had precisely served Dumbledore’s sentence.
It took so much of Sirius to remain in his seat. He gripped his jerking thighs and stared accusingly at his crotch. This was all
“Maybe we should do something else…” Draco finally said, the man clearly needing mercy after this now senseless slaughtering.
“It was how I felt my services could be best owed. For all I’ve done for you, for all I’ve done for your family. I don’t believe there’s anything else you could give me that I would want… unless.” His eyes went down, Draco almost physically felt the caress of Snape’s eyes over his crotch, before they traveled back to stare hungrily at Draco.
Another thing that made mindfulness and meditation impossible was that Draco would often times find himself facing the uncomfortable truth: he probably wasn’t emotionally prepared enough for his next heat. Everyone was right and since he’d already done this with Potter before there was no reason he had to be so difficult. His body wanted it anyway, why fight it?
hi guys!!!!! happy (early) christmas!! so sorry for the super long wait but in my defence this chapter is 10k long hahaa! next chapter please be prepared to see the story move on to good old hoggie-wartsie! hope everyone is gonna have an amazing christmas :) (a christmas chapter wont happy until another 2-3 updates lmao so that will be a little delayed!) i hope you guys appreciate how difficult it is to come up with a comprehensive biological universe for a/b/o while still making things interesting and different. so far i hope im making sense but if not i promise my goal is to keep filling in the cracks as i go along !
The engine ran on magic, it made him capable of anything. If Sirius wanted to he could go up to speeds that surpassed the human eye, he could fly higher than any Muggle aircraft. He felt invincible on it.
“I swear on all things good and sweet if some prick leaves me another love note or flower in here I’m going to fill it with spiders,”
Blaise continued, “I mean, you haven’t bonded completely, have you? People can smell it, even I can. That’s why it’s so easy for people to hit on you like they have all day. You and Potter didn’t do it right.”
Draco let out a whoosh of breath, the endless sources lights around him all dimmed at once as if confirming the inevitable.
Draco has no magic here, he has no voice. He has nothing, and can only throw his arm up to avoid the teeth snapping at his face.
And everyone was too drunk to care, so they all cheered. Draco smiled and basked in the pride swelling in him for finally receiving the validation he deserved. He came to a conclusion a long time ago that all his deliberate, painstakingly meticulous work - be it his grades, his appearance, his stunts, his jokes, his personality, or this stupid fucking ball - would pay off one day, and satisfy everyone. He blinked once the excitement of it wore off, and the warmth of the light on him grew cold, and he realised just how lonely he truely felt.
Without diverging his heated stare, Draco whipped out his wand and wordlessly shot a fire ball at the remaining shards of Luna’s glasses on the floor, burning them in a surge of heat until they couldn’t be recognised, let alone magically repaired. The smell of hot plastic filled his nose and mouth.
The blond Omega herself dumped a tall stack of tabloid issues into Draco’s unsuspecting arms as soon as he met up at their agreed spot, on the fifth floor just outside Ravenclaw common room after their last class.
, Sirius thought with a warm feeling in his belly. “He’d performed basic magic with his wand a couple of times again but nothing unusual, no weird behaviours. No spike in emotions, nothing at least to make me think it was serious.”
Draco took a deep breath and swept his left foot forward, angling the tip of his toe away slightly. Both fists raised at his cheekbones.
He looked at his deep emerald jumper, it was made out of an expensive and rare plant fibre, making the threads look lush like a leaf from a rainforest. It served him well, there wasn’t anything wrong with it and he didn’t need to mess around with its quality by transfiguring it into something else… But he couldn’t help himself.
Sirius decided he needed to treat this boy to something nice, as a reward for his bravery, or maybe as an apology for all the crappy bullshit he’d put the other through.
“I have told you that I understand your troubles, and that adjusting will be hard. But this didn’t give you the right -
The longer he stood there thinking, the more the magic rumbled in his ears, like it was yawning and waking up, ready to destroy everything in its path. It had no outlet, no reason to be channeled, it was an unleashed, unstoppable -
Even in the dim midnight light, he could distinguish the silhouettes of Headmaster Dumbledore, Filch, Professor Snape, Professor McGonagall, and the oaf of a groundskeeper Hagrid along the perimeter of the destruction. Draco couldn’t really make out their faces but he could easily toss a guess to say they were perplexed.
In the last three weeks since the start of the school semester, nothing about Sirius Black had changed. His hair was still the same shoulder length, black mane and his
“Wow… I sound like a right old creep right now, don’t I?” Harry said bashfully, rubbing the back of his neck. He nervously tugged at the longer strands of black hair that tangled at the back of his neck. It’s not like he could help it…
Harry shrugged, now the one to look embarrassed. “Well… Yeah? I can smell everything off you? What you’ve eaten, who you’ve spoken to…”
She grinned and dug around for something in her book-bag, she pulled out a fistful of notes and passed them over. Harry took them with a passing thought that he might need to straighten them out a bit, already predicting that Draco wasn’t going to look at them in this state.
“Students, members of the faculty. I’m aware of the rumours that have started to spin and would rather explain the situation myself. Oliver Claudwell has acted in interest against Hogwarts and is hereby expelled.
The glow of Draco’s hands receded, and the vibration vanished, leaving behind a faint, dulled pain in loving memory.
Seamus stuffed a sausage into his mouth, his cheeks bulged as he loudly spoke: “S’have you lot heard what happened then? Colin’s brother Dennis found out from Hufflepuff that Malfoy hooked up with some poor Fifth Year. Poor kid got expelled just coz the slut couldn’t keep it in his pants.”
A vibration, a sound straight out of a cosmic-horror-inspired nightmare, erupted from inside him. Draco couldn’t stop, or control, the energy rapidly building in his core, and only helplessly wrapped his arms around himself, hunched forward in pained submission. He tried to think peaceful thoughts, but anger would rear its powerful head and rip the thought to shreds, which only fuelled its intensity. His hands were starting to glow.
He put them on and was exaggeratedly swaggering around for an applause from the group, which he got, save from Draco. “Hey check me out in these!”
It was spiked. But not with much, a little cheap fire whiskey. It only left a mild burn at the very tip of his tongue. No doubt something more substantial would make their way in people’s cups later.
edit: also crap i know harry doesnt find the halfblood prince's book until his 6th year which he hasnt even started yet.... BUT lets just pretend he already had it in his 5th year.... ;-)
As soon as the thought materialised in his head, Lucia looked up as if she had sensed it, blue eyes meeting his.
Harry was so wrapped up in his thoughts he didn’t notice Ron, who collapsed into the plush cushioned seat opposite him.
Draco didn’t need to be told twice, still a little bit in shock himself, and whirled around out the door.
“What are you doing…“ Draco started, but he let his words trail off as his attention centred in on the folded up map in his Alpha’s hand. “…Ah.”
Snape nodded. “A point to Ravenclaw. Were this a normal, weaker boggart the shock caused with your greater spell casting ability would kill it. However this one has had all summer to fester and become quite powerful. It will take a couple of tries before it is ready to be expelled from the cabinet. Who will go first?”
Harry trailed off mid-conversation after that, looking on somewhere over Draco’s head. Draco turned, curious at the new distraction that could interrupt such an important conversation, but felt a cold chill rush through his blood when he finally made out what exactly was so interesting.
“D’you wanna dance, mate?” It was Harry, he had pulled back to bow with a hand behind his back, face twisted and pointed up to expose his green eyes and wide grin. A shadow snake, just one of the many scuttling shadow creatures swarming every surface like a reversed light-show, slithered over Harry’s lightning scar before vanishing away into his hairline.
She wasn’t wrong. His deeply conservative family, if forced to make the choice at the end of an active wand, would rather discuss Muggle politics than the goings-on regarding their second gender, especially of an
“I cannot believe the both of you. This behaviour…” Their Headmaster squeezed the bridge of his thin crooked nose. “This was unacceptable. Especially after I had warned the school tonight. Harry…” His tone was fierce. “You needed to prove to me that this could have worked. I needed to trust you and you let me down.”
Draco needed to be hidden away from the inevitable carnage, it wasn’t too late yet. Severus just had to push him
“My, don’t you all look delightfully terrifying! Or unusual. What a great effort spurred on by the spirit of Halloween,” Dumbledore paused to let out well-humoured chuckle, Draco didn’t realise he was sneering until felt his lips ache from the effort. “Thank you to the wonderful team of students in the student council. Everyone, please help me welcome these hard-working individuals up here for a round of rightfully-earned
Draco rarely went up there, he was a little grossed out by the site of dried up rodent bones and owl shit on the straw covered ground. Potter didn’t seem bothered in the slightest, as if he’d been up to visit hundreds of times.
“Oh shit…” The Alpha said with alarm, stiffening beside the Omega. He at first tried to wipe the tears away himself, but then amended his strategy to grabbing Draco’s wrist and pulling him away and out of the foyer. Out of semi-public and into a classroom that he double checked was empty.
Its dark, but Draco can still make out the throng of ancient black trees surrounding him - the details in their ageing trunks and dying leaves are illuminated by the silver full-moon.
“I saw what the council had done with the Great Hall, it’s wonderful. The ball will surely be a great success, and a night we will all remember. Thank you to you both. Draco,” Dumbledore turned to him with a warm, benevolent smile, “how did you find the volunteer work?”
Draco looked down at that, she was right. He was still in the clothes he wore to the train station, a dark pair of jeans, worn with a mustard jumper and slip-on style leather shoes, his scarf and black peacoat had been cast aside on the other end of the sofa. He’d been experimenting with different styles and colours during his week in Grimmauld, after observing Sirius and the Muggles he’d see on their rare outings. “Oh. Yeah. Whoops.”
Draco had never walked up to the seventh floor so many times in two months. He was panting, sweating at the armpits and face, all while trying to maintain a comfortable distance from the Alpha behind him, who was also obviously also struggling, but not from exhaustion. Harry had covered his nose and mouth halfway during the trip, possibly to avoid Draco’s post-heat pheromones. His tanned skin was blushing furiously and a sheen of sweat could be seen on his forehead. Unfortunately for Harry, Draco’s stubbornness to lead their walk was an already settled debate.
It was a group of first years just coming out of the Great Hall, probably having just finished breakfast early, and from the group of five Draco could immediately detect the Omega out of them. He was the smallest boy in the back, with tanned skin and golden hair. Draco deduced that he might have been in Hufflepuff as his friends proudly paraded around wearing the house insignia on their school assigned bed-robes.
Hagrid had offered to carry him but Draco nipped that suggestion in the bud effectively - by barking harshly. “I can
Harry looked stunned, but recovered with a laugh, offering a step back in an act of surrender. He seemed very pleased in a drastically short amount of time. “Christ, you’re just as bad as Hermione.”
. How Draco felt wasn’t important, it wasn’t important to his parents, it wouldn’t be to anyone else.
“You have to visit me every day to make up for all the times you haven’t seen me. She’s very tricky to look for when you actually want to find her. The harder you look the more she disappears…”
“No,” his Headmaster said, it didn’t sound like he was even taking him seriously. “I don’t think you can. The situation at the lake had reminded me that if I don’t take action now, it will not only be a costly mistake, but a deadly one. An Alpha is needed to behave as an insulator to your magic, Harry has agreed to performing the mateship with you properly. I need you to agree to this too, Draco, or I will have to ask you to leave Hogwarts.”
