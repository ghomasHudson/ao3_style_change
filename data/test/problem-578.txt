Watching Draco’s orgasm tear through him, and the feeling of him clenching around him, sent Harry over the edge as well, with a few more thrusts he was groaning out Draco’s name as he filled him. Feeling wrung out and exhausted, Harry kissed Draco’s shoulder and reached up, tugging on the restraints, so they unwrapped from around Draco’s wrists. Carefully Harry pulled out and stood, grinning at the utterly debauched sight Draco made.
“He doesn’t have one yet, that’s up to you,” Draco’s delighted grin was indication enough that he knew the little bird was staying.
“Best Christmas present ever” he heard Harry whisper in his ear as he collapsed onto Draco’s chest, both panting and gasping at the over stimulation.
The cabin was all timber but clearly well-built as no wind whistled through the timbers. One wall was made of stone with a small fireplace. Deciding to do a little showing off of his own, Draco flicked his fingers at the fireplace, muttered a spell and a fire was soon crackling in the fireplace. He just shrugged his shoulder to Harry’s muttered, “Now who’s showing off?” He assumed the view out the large window at the bottom of the bed would be spectacular when the snow stopped falling, right now though, he couldn’t see past the snow.
“Well… where is it?” Harry prompted; it was no secret that Harry loved presents. Grinning, Draco led Harry over to the lounge and pushed him down into it.
“A discount isn’t necessary; we’d be happy to help it sounds interesting. I’m guessing we’re not the only ones who’d bought lingerie under the guise of it being for a woman?”
Lightly Harry stroked over the warm, responsive skin beneath his seeking fingers. Toying with the soft head and stroking the shaft to Draco’s shuttered breath. Harry couldn’t take his eyes off him, as Draco’s eyes darkened to the colour of a stormy sky, the lust apparent as Harry played with him.
“The fact that we can’t be disturbed, no kids barging in or work floo calling, just… us..” Draco trailed off, feeling a little self-conscious. He wasn’t one for admitting what he wanted, well not without a lot of provocation. Gentle pressure on his chin forced him to look up and at Harry.
“Oh, shut up,” Harry grumbled, knowing he was not going to live this down in a hurry. “Owlbert was scared.”
“Blaise has invited us to spend New Year with him in London,” Draco informed Harry one afternoon as he got out of the shower. “Wants to show off his new flat, looks over the Thames and we can watch the fireworks, do you want to go?” Harry pulled the towel off his head to Draco’s grin. He could only imagine what his hair looked like as he dragged his fingers through the wet strands.
“So, it would seem! I must have been good this year, or is that wicked?” Harry asked, trying to look innocent, but he knew he wasn’t succeeding. The bulge in his pyjama bottoms showed that his thoughts were villainous.
“You have no idea,” Harry replied grinning himself as he ground against Draco to the other man’s moan. Harry hadn’t fooled around like this for ages, the feel of a fit muscular body under his hands, a hard cock rubbing alongside his own. Bliss.
Draco knew he was rambling but honesty he couldn't care less. He had never had a lover like Harry, even for their first time, he was, as promised, making Draco lose his mind. That wicked mouth doing amazing things to his cock, even taking the whole thing to the base and, sweet Merlin, those wicked fingers, stretching him wide and teasing his sweet spot. “Harry fuck, can’t, need, too.” The only signal Draco got that it was fine to let go was Harry taking him even deeper. It was all too much and with a shout, Draco came, flooding Harry’s mouth and gasping as if he had run a mile. The feeling of Harry’s throat squeezing his sensitive cock as he swallowed his release was almost too much but before Draco could say a word, Harry was on his knees at the base of the bed, pushing Draco’s legs out of the way and resting the head of his own cock against Draco’s entrance.
“No, it’s fine I get it. I do all I can to stay out of the papers. I don’t care if it's fundraising for the hospital or various charities, I’ve no shame in digging into my friend’s pockets for things like that, but my personal life is just that, personal. It was dragged through the papers enough during the divorce, enough is enough.” Draco raised his glass in salute.
“OK then, how about beautifully soft satin knickers? Not sure a thong would be too well received so I’ve chosen a full bottom. Now, these,” she held up a gorgeous satin and lace pair and Harry could feel his cock give an appreciative twitch at the thought of Draco wearing them “have a matching suspender belt and of course we have stockings in extra tall.” Her smirk had Harry laughing, it broke the tension.
Draco was larger than Harry had expected but he certainly was not complaining, he had always loved a big cock. Loved being split open but first, he wanted to taste Draco, make him lose control and shudder through his release as Harry swallowed him to the base. Looking up, Harry was pleased to see that Draco was watching him, so with a cheeky wink Harry gripped the base of Draco’s cock and slipped his lips over the head, slowly taking more and more until he had at least half of it in his mouth and just as slowly, he pulled right back to the head, twirling his tongue over the soft head.
“Idiot” he chuckled and accio’d the lube from the bedside drawer. He much preferred it over a spell. It was part of the Weasley twin’s new adult range, this tube had a slight warming spell in it, no more cold lube where it shouldn’t be.
“Oh yes, he’s staying alright,” he sipped his tea watching Harry get comfortable with the little owl as they settled in for a night in front of the television. Draco had turned into quite the television junkie and loved muggle crime dramas. However, by eleven o’clock, both men were yawning and ready for bed. Harry carried their little owl into the spare room to his cage and giving him one last pat, put him inside.
“Having a large family, I used to dream about that, when we were at school. Unfortunately, I knew by the sixth year it wasn’t going to happen.”
“Are you OK with this?” Harry asked he would never take unfair advantage of someone like this, it wasn’t in his nature. At Draco’s pause, Harry removed his hand, not wanting to influence the blonde wizard at his mercy however Draco gave him a hesitate nod. Reaching up Harry unknotted the ribbon silencing him and watched him work his jaw loose.
“Did you make me supper? Harry stepped out of the tub and onto the bathmat, he caught the towel Draco threw at him, his eye roll was epic, and he didn’t do much of a job hiding his grin.
“I’ve always wanted to thank her, but I didn’t think she had wanted to speak with me, after what my family did to hers.” Pulling Draco into his arms, Harry accio’d the handmade quilt over them.
“I wanted to thank you for Draco’s Christmas present,” Harry replied with a smirk as they both choked on their drinks.
“Malfoy, I want to fuck you through the mattress, that better?” this time it was Harry who found himself being ravaged. “I take it that’s a yes?” he grinned as they pulled apart.
“No, I want to ride you. Here, or upstairs.” His words made Draco’s brain short circuit. He’d not been on the giving end in a long time. Not that he had anything against it but it just hadn’t worked out that way.
“How many ex-girlfriends do you have?” he asked genuinely curious. They’d both discussed their pasts. Ginny was a regular visitor to their flat, she and Draco often got into in-depth discussions about Quidditch.
“Astoria?” Draco queried, wiping his hands on a tea towel and attempting to peek into the bag. Harry slapped his fingers as Draco had done to him on numerous occasions.
“He’s already got you wrapped around his tail feathers,” Draco laughed as he took the plates to the sink.
“Hmmmm eventually,” Harry grinned at Draco’s muttered profanity as he stood between his spread legs, the silk stretched tight so Harry could easily see the plug teasing his boyfriend, loving his whines of frustrated arousal. Kneeling on the carpet between Draco’s feet, Harry slowly dragged his palms up Draco’s thighs, feeling the muscles twitch under his hands. Leaning closer, Harry pushed the silk out of his way and trailed a line of kisses up the back of Draco’s thigh to the curve of his arse and lightly nipped it, enough to leave a red mark. At his shuddering breath, Harry repeated the same manoeuvre up his other leg. He was in no hurry to end this sweet torture; it was too much fun.
“You okay?” Harry asked, a glass of Firewhisky on the table beside Draco’s chair as Harry nursed his own, “You were gone a while.”
“My son’s birth dates and their constellations.” Harry had muttered dazedly as the potions had started to take effect. “James and Albus” he had finished on a pained gasp as his shoulder had slipped back into place. Draco knew from gossip that there was now a third date under the two boys, he could remember reading a birth announcement for a baby girl a few years ago.
“Oh, come here,” Harry carefully opened the cage and lifted the little owl out. “You’re going to get me in trouble, do you know that?” Harry scolded but clearly, he wasn’t being taken seriously as his owl lightly nibbled on his fingers.
“Come on, we need to get out of this weather.” After trudging for what seemed like hours, although was probably no more than twenty minutes, Draco grabbed Harry’s arm.
“My room is upstairs, I’m sure you can walk that far?” not waiting for an answer Harry led Draco by the hand upstairs to his room.
A few days later Harry walked into Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and pulled both twins into a rough hug, handing them each a bottle of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky.
“I don’t care what other people think, the only opinions I care about is my friends and family, the rest of the Wizarding world can go jump for all I care,” Harry snapped, it was an old argument which still irritated him. “Love is love, it shouldn’t make any damn difference who it's with, it's not illegal. I’d love to give Skeeter an interview that would curl her toes but Ginny has reminded me, it would hurt our kids and I would never do that. Sorry, it's a sensitive topic.” Harry smiled apologetically.
“Hey, Harry,” Seamus yelled from the kitchen and Harry called back a greeting. Clearly, Seamus and most likely Dean were in the kitchen. Seamus’ grandmother had been teaching the boys to cook while they were in Ireland over the summer break, and they were eager to show off what they had learnt.
“You are so damn gorgeous,” Harry slipped his hand under the silk and stroked Draco’s bare flesh, weighing the softness of Draco’s balls in his hands, slowly sliding his hand up the shaft to the weeping head before retracing the same path, with the same deliberate slowness. He could feel the slight tremor under his hand and Draco’s breathing quickening with his arousal. Harry repeated the movement, but this time over the silk, Draco’s gasp was approval enough that he was enjoying what Harry was doing to him, well that and his rapidly hardening cock.
“I don’t believe that bloody rag, they’ve dragged my name through the muck more times than I can count, thank you. No, I had no idea about your sexuality, not really my business is it?” Draco hoped he could attribute the heat in the room to his blush. You’re thirty-four for Merlin's sake, grow up he thought to himself, taking another careful sip of his drink.
“Sweet Merlin Potter… I won’t last.” Draco gasped, feeling his orgasm creep up on him. Frustratingly Harry backed off, teasing him and sucking lightly, running his tongue over the head and rim, driving Draco mad. He’d never had a blow job like this, not since Pansy Parkinson had bestowed the first one at 15 in the Slytherin common room. It had been a dare that no one thought she’d carry through on but then again Pansy always had been an exhibitionist.
“Molly and Arthur Weasley have the biggest hearts of anyone I’ve ever known, Draco. I promise you if you’re important to me they will accept you.”
“Yep,” Harry replied yawning “It must be seven o’clock,” he rolled over to kiss his boyfriend good morning but was interrupted by the door crashing open and an excited Teddy launching himself at them and wiggling his way between the two adults.
“It’s clear that you’re not totally against the idea?” Harry commented, lightly running his fingers over Draco’s ribbon-wrapped erection. He wasn’t fully hard but well on the way, so Harry decided to give him a helping hand as it were and reached down and tugged on the bow which unwrapped nicely leaving the remainder of the ribbons in place. I’ll thank Hermione for that later Harry thought, positive it was her doing.
“I think we’re going to have to make some room for your lingerie, I think we’re going to be regular visitors at Astoria’s lingerie shop.”
Sure, enough Draco was waving his hand in the air and blowing on his fingers. Harry leaned on the door jamb and grinned.
Watching the pleasure play across Harry’s face, his cock jerking in Draco’s hand as Harry shot his release all over Draco’s stomach, and Harry clamping down on Draco’s cock as he rode out his orgasm was very nearly enough to send Draco over the edge.
Harry could not tear his eyes off the soft black leather that hugged that spectacular backside. The tempting muscles defining his back, shoulders that flexed as he rolled over, and sleepy slate-grey eyes that blinked up at Harry.
“You still get on with your ex-in-laws then?” he asked, honestly shocked by the very notion. He was barely on speaking terms with Mr and Mrs Greengrass after the public scandal of divorcing their daughter. Money was no issue, as he had sworn to support Scorpius, which of course, meant that Astoria was very well taken care of too.
Harry swung his pack onto his back and grabbed his skis again, grinning at the group, Draco in particular. There was no way Harry was letting Draco get away with more runs than him.
“He’ll outgrow the baby feathers in a month or so, according to the owner at the Emporium.” Draco picked up their mugs and walked into the living room. Their little owl was not going to be ignored, and his sad little chirrups had Harry taking a detour to his perch near the window to pick up and carry him to the lounge with them to Draco’s amused smirk.
Molly and Arthur called out names and one by one they all filed up to receive their presents and a hug from their grandparents. Toys, clothes, books, tins of toffee and biscuits. Brooms for a couple of the older kids. Wrapping paper was strewn everywhere. Cuddling up to Harry, Draco hardly heard his name called. Scrambling to his feet, he hugged Molly and Arthur and took the small black box. It was tied with a red satin ribbon and had a note attached “Open this in private! F&G”. Draco showed the tag to Molly who glared at her sons but dreading what may be in that box, she nodded, letting Draco open it later. Draco was curious, if nervous. Those two individuals giving notice of a prank was unheard of.
“Fuck!” Draco gasped as Harry slid all the way in. He’d not been so full for far too long. He’d forgotten just how bloody good this was. Buffeted between Harry’s strong hard body and the soft mattress, there was nowhere else he wanted to be. None of his other lovers had brought Draco to such a height of sensation so fast. Harry had him teetering on the edge of orgasm and kept him there, at the perfect angle to nudge against his prostate on each thrust, the pleasure building with each strong thrust.
“Eventually,” Harry replied and Draco was sure he could feel his grin against his skin as Harry nibbled and kissed his way lower, his destination obvious. It had been a damn long time since anyone had made Draco feel like this. Astoria had flatly refused to pleasure him with her mouth after the first two or three times and never after she had fallen pregnant and Draco hadn’t had that many lovers, either male or female since the divorce to do it either.
“I brought your dinner,” Harry held up the dish, the warming charm keeping it nice and hot. “Hungry?”
Dropping his watch, glasses, and wand on the bedside table, Harry pulled back the covers and jumped into bed, only to scramble straight back out.
They fit perfectly, he’d never doubted that and felt somewhat strange, very different from men’s underwear but beautifully so. The elastic was tight around his waist, but the soft silk skimmed his body, so sheer he could see his hard cock tenting the front of them. Reaching down to stroke it, he couldn’t prevent his low moan; he’d never felt anything like it in his life. Caressing himself through the sheer soft silk, Draco didn’t hear the floo roar to life or Harry’s voice floating through the flat.
“Take him home, Harry; the night healer has just arrived, see you Monday Draco.” With his swinging shifts, it came around every so often that Draco had a treasured weekend off and he was eager to get out of here.
Harry left the bag on Draco’s side of the bed but added a little anti-tampering charm. He wanted to be there when Draco opened his present, to see the look on his face and the lust come to life in his eyes.
“Wondering what the view will be like, when the snow clears, and how long we may be stuck here. Not that I’m complaining, mind you, but that soup is not fit for wizard consumption.” Harry couldn’t help his snort of laughter at the disgruntled look on Draco’s face.
“You love my filthy mouth, don’t… fuck… don’t tell me otherwise,” Harry stuttered just as Draco got the angle right and dragged the head of his cock over Harry’s sweet spot. “Fuck yes there again,” he stammered, feeling the pleasure zing along his nerves. Draco was strong enough to hold him down, not that Harry couldn’t break the hold if he wanted to, but he loved handing himself over to his lover. He had no doubt Draco’s grip on his hips would leave bruises, but he didn’t mind that either, he loved the stupid grin wore every time he saw them before they faded. Draco was not allowed to heal them.
Leaning over to kiss Draco again, driving him wild with that wickedly talented mouth, Draco gasped as the rough carpet under him became a soft and luxurious fur and the ribbons melted away leaving him free.
“No chance of that happening,” Harry said raising his glass in salute. It was Draco’s turn to look puzzled. “I’m really not that into women, to be honest, and I’m not quite ready to explain to my 12-year-old daughter why there is a naked man in my bed, that conversation with the boys was embarrassing enough.” Draco choked on his Firewhisky.
Teasingly Harry let his hand slip further down, stroking against Draco’s sensitive entrance and carefully pushed a finger into Draco's warmth.
“My turn!” Harry growled in his ear and, gripping Draco’s hips hard, he lost any finesse he had and simply fucked into the compliant man beneath him, taking his pleasure. It wasn’t long until Harry was also losing control, flooding Draco’s body and collapsed on Draco’s back, gasping and trying to get his breath back.
Once the presents were all handed out, with a lot of extra gifts for the kids, it was Harry and Draco’s turn to go back upstairs to shower and get dressed.
“Well, anyone else and I could answer that, but you, I have no idea?” Harry replied, far more honest than he would have, had he been sober.
“Fishnets and seamed stockings to begin with? I’d suggest you cut your nails, these are very fine French silk, they snag very easily.” Harry nodded, at both her suggestions.
Draco’s muffled growl just made Harry laugh harder, “This will be fun, well for me anyway!” the look on Draco’s face was priceless. Harry would not push Draco beyond what he was comfortable with, but as they had been circling each other for years. Harry could only assume that Draco had driven his friends mad, same as Harry had.
“You keep looking at me like that and I’m not going to last much longer,” Harry accused, he was riding the edge of losing control as it was. he had not corrected Draco’s assumption that he had not had sex in six years, more like six months, and he had been nothing like the gorgeous man under Harry now, although thinking back, Harry clearly had a type, fit tall blond men.
“Happy Valentine’s Day,” Harry said, kissing him and handing over a huge bouquet of deep red roses. Draco buried his face in them, they smelt divine and their perfume filled the flat.
“Yes, but we’ll need a good selection to choose from, now shoosh.” She reminded him somewhat of Hermione when she was on a rant about something. He and Ron had learnt a long time ago, not to get in her way.
Hermione came over to give Harry a kiss while Ron gave him a thump on the back in greeting. They were Harry’s favourite people in the world, and it felt good to see them again.
“What would be worse?” George queried walking over to Harry and holding out a small black card with gold writing.
Draco left them alone and started dinner, listening to Harry talk to his new pet from the kitchen. There weren’t too many people who realised just what a softie at heart Harry really was. Draco had no doubt that would be a very spoiled little owl in a very short amount of time. Draco set to the task of cutting some steaks, slicing up a few extra smaller pieces, knowing Harry would likely feed the owl off his plate, or steal some before Draco had finished cooking.
Not that Harry minded, it was a view worth savouring. Draco was still slim but not as scrawny as he had been in school. He had filled out nicely with subtle muscle under all that pale skin. “Don’t stop!” Harry demanded, his voice husky as Draco got down to his briefs and hesitated. Watching Harry watch him strip was having the desired effect but Draco didn’t want this over too soon so he left his briefs on as he climbed onto the bed and crawled over Harry, twining his fingers into the dark locks and holding him still to ravage his mouth again.
“So very different to what they were with me. My mother has even taught him how to make biscuits, I didn’t think she even knew the Manor had a kitchen when I was a boy. Father is teaching him proper pureblood manners and has even taken him to the opera, to show off his grandson in public. Scorp isn’t much of a fan but he goes for his grandfather. I’ve warned them both not to even attempt to arrange a marriage for my son, he’ll marry who he loves, when he decides to, and not be dictated by some stupid pureblood rituals.” Draco couldn’t keep the passion out of his voice, it was probably the only thing he and Astoria agreed on.
Scorpius would marry for love but Draco secretly hoped it was years away. Firstly, he wasn’t ready to be a grandfather just yet but more than that, he wanted Scorp to travel and experience the world. It wasn’t as if Draco couldn’t afford to give his son the best, but he also wanted him to work for what he wanted. He showed a remarkable aptitude for potions and herbology, apparently, Professor Longbottom was his favourite teacher.
“Far too much damn information, Harry,” Fred wiped the Firewhisky off his chin. Harry just shrugged, unconcerned about their reactions.
“Yes, I am aware of where we are, I also went to school in the Scottish Highlands for seven years and the storm will eventually pass. Until then, we’re stuck as simple as that. Unless you’d prefer to take your chances out there?” Harry crossed his arms over his chest and glared, fed up with Draco’s childish temper tantrum.
Harry had stilled, given Draco time to calm down and carefully pulled out, dropping Draco’s legs to the bed and flopping down beside him, feeling very pleased with himself. The effects of the alcohol had dissipated, his euphoria was now totally due to the sexy man beside him.
“What do you mean?” Draco demanded, scowling and bouncing off the bed to stand in front of Harry.  Arms crossed over his chest.
“You do know I have no idea what most of this stuff is, don’t you?” Harry asked, not able to keep the humour out of his voice. She merely grinned and nodded.
“Yep,” Harry smirked, “Your ex-girlfriend was very helpful. It seems she runs the shop was the twins bought your knickers from. I just added to your collection,”
Carefully peeling off the gold dot, Draco pulled back the tissue paper to reveal a dark blue pair of lace undies. They were cut the same as his briefs, grinning he held them up to his hips and swayed them, to Harry’s grin. The second package was a similar shape, and he correctly guessed it contained more undies. Red, black, purple and green followed.
“Fuck, so close,” Harry whined, unable to take much more as his body ramped up for what he knew would be an explosive orgasm. “Sweet Mercy” he gasped as it was torn out of him. Harry felt as if his brain had shut down as he couldn’t say a word, just managed to gasp and moan his way through the strongest orgasm he’d ever had.
“Not yourself!” the twins yelled at once, glaring at them Draco did as he was instructed and was relieved to get Harry’s name. Tucking it into his pocket, he waited as Molly passed the hat around until it was empty.
“Did you get lost in there?” Harry’s voice carried down the hall and Draco grinned, in a hurry to get back to bed and to see where this, whatever this was, was going.
Draco loved listening to his boyfriend’s moans and gasps turned him on so much. Harry used to be so quiet, they both were really. The result of having discovered the joys of wanking in a dorm room with other boys. Sure, they all did it, but at that age, no one admitted to it. Now, however, Harry was a noisy bugger, not holding back his moans and groans, letting Draco hear his pleasure, gripping their joined hands hard, needing all the connection they could get.
“Come on, let's go home,” he put his hand out, and they apparated home. “I need a shower,” he said, heading for their room and stripping off his healer robes. While none of today’s cases had been life-threatening, it seemed the healer’s room was always full.
“No idea but…” Draco showed Harry the tag. He turned to glare at the twins, who just smirked in return.
“There’s no ice cream. I was just thinking how scandalised Scorpius would be, he can’t imagine a world without ice cream.”
Draco just shrugged, unlacing his other boot and tossing it aside. “Black is fine, two sugars thanks,” he replied, trying to hide his smirk at the look on Potter’s face.
Harry dropped a kiss into Draco’s shoulders and carefully pulled out, rolling onto the bed and brushing Draco’s sweaty hair out of his eyes. He had to grin at the well-fucked look on Draco’s face.
The only sound in the room for quite some time was of eight adults devouring Seamus’ cooking. It didn’t take long until they were all sopping up the juices with hunks of bread and groaning with full bellies.
Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s hair, gasping at the sensation of being right down his throat. “Fuck Potter,” he moaned unable to help himself. “That’s so good, more!”
“Don’t you fucking dare, Potter!” Harry couldn’t help his chuckle as Draco easily slid back into his normal snark, course it was rather spoilt by the whiny desperate tone it was delivered in.
Draco could not tear his eyes away and Harry gracefully crawled down his body and started to tease him. Clearly, in a mood to take his time and really, trussed up like a Christmas turkey, there wasn’t much Draco could do about it.
“Yes, with marshmallows. Let me run the bath for you and I’ll go make some.” Harry climbed off the bed and unselfconsciously walked over to the en-suite bathroom and seconds later the sound of running water filled the bedroom. “Don’t fall asleep!” he warned, tossing on a robe, the rest of the house was bitterly cold, and hurrying downstairs.
Getting to his feet and brushing snow off his jacket and jeans, Harry looked across the road at the very posh looking store. Black and gold were their colours, not that Harry knew much about women’s lingerie stores, but it looked bloody posh to him.
“Sweet Salazar Malfoy!” Harry moaned, twining his fingers into those fine blonde tresses. Harry needed to ground himself, he felt like he was floating away. Draco knew just when to tease with that wicked tongue of his, flicking it over all the sensitive parts of Harry’s cock, or to take him to the base, swallowing around the head which made Harry see stars. “Fuck yes,” he moaned as Draco took all of him again. “I’ll come again you keep that up,” Harry warned, feeling it was only polite but Merlin he really did not want Draco to stop, this was amazing.
Maybe the rumours he had heard around the ministry were correct. Even though Draco tried to stay out of office politics, it was hard to ignore prominent rumours when they were whispered loudly between the other healers and sometimes it was useful to know about the skeletons in the closets, in this case quite literally. He had not believed that Potter was gay, well bisexual at the least as he was married at the time, but soon the news of his divorce from his childhood sweetheart hit
Before Harry could remind Draco yet again that he didn’t want another owl, Draco cut him off, “Yes, I know all the excuses Harry, but look at him? You can’t send him back to the owlery, after all, he chose me, he’s a clever little owl,”
“Could I interest you in a nice hot bath and a mug of hot chocolate?” Harry was not above bribery to get Draco to stay the night.
“You’re a slob, do you know that?” Draco called out as he snatched the clothes off the floor and threw them in the hamper to Harry’s echoing laughter from the bathroom. Engrossed by the softness of those knickers Draco didn’t hear the shower shut off or Harry call out to him, asking what he had in his hands. However, he jumped a mile when warm arms wrapped around his waist.
“Apparently!” he gasped, edging closer and closer to losing control. Draco could feel it. Harry’s gasps and moans were getting louder and closer together. The feeling of him ploughing into Draco’s body was suddenly far too much. “Fuck Harry, I’m going to come!” he moaned loudly, unable to hold back any longer and came, hard enough to see stars.
“Please what?” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear to his whole-body shudder. Gently Harry tugged his arm above Draco’s head and wrapped the red cords around his wrist and secured it around the bed head before checking the ropes were not too tight. Kissing Draco’s shoulder, Harry repeated the process on his other arm, so both stretched towards the bed head. The red ropes stark against the pale grey bedding, and Draco’s body stretched out for him to ravage. It was a sight Harry would never forget. Gryffindor red is his colour, Harry smirked at the thought.
“Now, now, where are your pure-blood manners? You know better than to ask the price of a gift!” Harry chastised for Draco’s glare. He loved riling up his boyfriend.
“Bit impatient aren’t you, Malfoy?” Secretly Harry loved it, the thought that someone was this impatient to get him into bed was a huge ego boost.
Noting the goosebumps pebbling Draco’s skin, unsure if it was arousal or the cold, Harry cast a wandless spell and the fire crackled to life. 12 Grimmauld Place could be damn cold at the best of times, in the middle of the night in late December it was beyond freezing and that was the last thing Harry wanted. The cold was not conducive to seduction, and that was his plan for tonight.
Maybe ribbon wrapped was a better description as Draco’s whole body was wrapped in a thick, bright red, ribbon. It pinned his arms to his sides while crisscrossing his torso, in intricate knots, which wound down his body to end in a huge bow covering his privates.
“Fuck Potter, you’ll make me come doing that.” Draco gasped, not to stop Harry, but he figured fair warning was only polite.
Amused green eyes collided with angry grey ones and Harry couldn’t hold back his grin at Draco’s angry, muffled curses that emanated from behind the red ribbon that gagged him. Harry had studied the blonde Slytherin long enough to lift one eyebrow in perfect imitation. Draco’s scowl making him chuckle.
“We need a name for you, don’t we?” Harry asked stroking the owl’s head, “He’s clever you say?” he asked to Draco’s nod. “I hope you got him some owl treats?” Harry couldn’t help his grin at Draco’s epic eye roll as he left the room, coming back with a bag of owl treats.
Draco just grinned. He was going to be doing all the work here as Harry was a contented lazy sprawl under him, a slight blush colouring his face and neck as he gasped and moaned. Draco tightened his grip and jerked them harder, faster as he leaned down and captured Harry’s mouth with his own. Slipping his tongue inside and savouring the taste that was uniquely Harry’s. Tea, peppermint and Firewhisky.
It didn’t help that his ex-wife was now engaged to Draco’s best friend, Blaise. He and Ginny were co-parenting their kids and Harry really was happy for her, however, it did mean making nice with Draco.
Course he didn’t have time to focus on the knickers, what with excited children, the older ones with new brooms, the kitchen a hub of activity, and as usual, the smells mouth-watering.
“So, do you have any further tattoos, Potter?” Draco called across the room as he finished his tea, leaning over to put the mug on the coffee table.
Draco wrapped his hand around Harry’s length. He filled Draco’s hand, long enough to poke through the other end and thick. Draco’s mouth watered just thinking about being impaled on that monster. It had been a while but Draco was determined to get his wish before the night was over.
“Merry fucking Christmas Potter!” Draco snapped but made no real attempt to get away. Harry was under no doubt he could get himself out of this situation if he wanted to.
“We are, dinner is booked for Saturday night, but I wanted to get you something pretty,” Harry easily sidestepped Draco’s stinging hex, laughing at his husband’s mock glare as he wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. Harry rested his chin on Draco’s shoulder and watched him arrange the roses.
“Don’t you bloody dare, if you value your balls.” Harry threatened, however, Draco just snorted at that threat as he knew it was pointless. Harry was clearly quite fond of his balls right where they were.
“Can’t we apparate back to the lodge?” Harry yelled over the increasing wind only for Draco to shake his head.
“You still have not explained what you are doing in my room,” Harry demanded far steadier than he expected.
“Fine,” Harry said laughing at them both, knowing he was being manipulated but suddenly found himself not caring. He had loved Hedwig, from the moment Hagrid had given her to him and had been heartbroken at her death. But the truth of the matter was, it had been more than ten years. It had been long enough to mourn his first owl. Sirius’ voice rang in his head, reminding him that those they loved never truly left.
“Be with you in a minute” a voice called from the back “Look around while you wait.” Harry did as the voice commanded. He’d always thought underwear was just for practical purposes, but none of this was at all realistic, but it was all gorgeous.
“Is that what you want? Just us?” Harry was deadly serious. Not making fun of him, those gorgeous green eyes as serious as Draco had ever seen them.
Harry hated that Draco was right but for some stupid reason he was hesitant to strip it off. Harry knew he was fit, the ministry demanded it and he was keeping up with the new recruits some who was ten years younger than him.
A few nights later it was Harry’s turn to return the favour. It was close to eight o’clock, and Draco was at least three hours late home from work. They’d both had to work back on far more nights than they could count, but Harry could guarantee that Draco hadn’t stopped to eat. Putting his dinner into a container, Harry slipped it into a carry bag and grabbed his jacket. Grabbing some floo powder, he called out “St Mungo's” and disappeared in a flare of bright green flames.
“Maybe later we could try a corset? It would pull his waist in beautifully.” Harry wasn’t sure who was more excited about that prospect, her or him, but the imagery was stunning.
” had paid off, and they’d had enough. Blaise had threatened this for years but Draco had never thought he’d really go ahead and do it.
“Close Harry so close,” Draco stuttered, losing his tenuous hold on his control as Harry thrust into him harder and with no warning, Draco’s control snapped, and he gasped in relief as his orgasm tore through him. His release covered Harry’s hand, the knickers and probably the sheets as well. Right now, he couldn’t care less; he had as much energy as a newborn Niffler. Thankfully he could slump on the bed, held up by Harry’s body and the restraints around his wrists.
“Honestly, we were not so much worried about Mum and Dad, but the questions from the kids. Daddy, why does Uncle Harry have ladies’ knickers?” Fred said in a perfect imitation of Victoire to Harry’s laughter.
“Yes, my son Scorpius,” Draco dug out his own capture and handed it across. The slim solemn blond-haired boy who looked like a replica of Draco at that age right down to the grey eyes and the Slytherin uniform.
Huge glass windows showed off what he assumed would be the mountains outside, it was too dark to see much right now. The room was crowded with overstuffed chairs and the fire was crackling, making the room toasty warm. Harry shrugged out of his thick jacket and unwrapped his scarf.
Truthfully, Draco was more than a little jealous that Harry had been able to keep up such a civil relationship with his ex-wife. Draco could hardly even be in the same room as his without her creating a scene. Draco had tried, mostly for his parents and to carry on the Malfoy line, but he just could not do it. Their lovemaking had been pathetic at best, all he had wanted to do was get it over with. Though they both deserved more than a loveless charade.  So he had called an end to the marriage and Astoria had not taken it well, to say the least. But Draco was quite certain she was more in love with being the next Mrs Malfoy than she ever was with him.
“What?” he blurted, wiping Firewhisky off his chin and staring at Harry as if he had never seen him before.
He’d always been far too captivated by Harry, ever since school if he was honest. The first few years had been in spite of Harry rejecting his friendship but by the third year, it had been his developing sexuality and all the confusion that came with that. By the fourth year, he’d been enjoying his fellow housemates, both the boys and the girls, and had never really stuck to one or the other, switching between lovers effortlessly. Beyond Blaise and Pansy with whom he’d hook up with whenever he was going through a dry spell, Draco hadn’t had a permanent partner for a while now. Maybe that was all about to change.
“Stay there, eyes closed, I’ll go and get it,” after making sure Harry was obeying his orders, Draco rushed down the hallway to the study and checked on the little bird who gave him a happy little chirp. “Shhhh,” Draco put his fingers to his lips and carried the box through to the front room where Harry was waiting, eyes closed.
“Not like I’m about to say no,” Draco snapped frustrated. “I’m close, get in me now!” but Harry shook his head.
would still crucify them, Rita Skeeter still had it out for Harry and Draco had also gained her wrath on more than one occasion, so this would be just the sort of thing she’d delight reporting on. Draco figured they deserved some small measure of happiness.
“This is not going to be a habit, do you hear me?” of course his owl didn’t pay him any attention, having got what he wanted. “Spoiled brat” Harry muttered as he curled up on the lounge, pulling a blanket over them as the owl got comfortable in his lap, making soft little hoots as Harry petted him.
“Untie me, Potter!” Draco ordered, used to having his orders obeyed, course Harry did no such thing.
“Now, are bras required or not?” she queried, again the eyebrow doing its little dance and Harry could not contain his blush. He wasn’t sure how far Draco wanted to take this but that just seemed a bit too far, just yet.
“So, which stepfather does this belong to?” Harry queried as Ginny led him up to his room. The queen bed was covered in a dark blue quilt and Harry dropped his bag on top. Honestly, the room was as big as his entire first flat. He could see a bathroom through one door and the other he assumed led outside.
Watching Draco moan and twitch under him, his gasps and breathy demands, was one of the most arousing things Harry had ever seen. Admittedly they often played with restraints, but usually, Draco wasn’t wearing sheer sexy silk French knickers. Harry had no doubt this was not going to be a one-off. Who knows maybe he could convince his hot lover to try something else? Not that Harry knew much about women’s lingerie, but he was more than willing to suffer the embarrassment of buying more if this was the reaction he was going to get. He’d wear it himself if Draco wished, but he had to admit Draco had more the frame for the delicate lace and satins Harry wanted to dress him in.
“I think we’re going to have to clear another drawer for Draco’s lingerie,” Harry grinned as Astoria added the corset to the pile. Harry wandered over to a table and picked up a black pair of sheer knickers, some sort of stretchy lace stuff but he thought Draco would look adorable in them, not that he’d tell the stubborn git, he’d deliberately not wear them if he did. Harry picked up one in each colour and added them to the ever-growing pile.
Harry had floo’d home after work, got changed and grabbed his bag. He had not been on skis in years and was really looking forward to it. It was one thing he could thank the Dursleys for. There was no way Vernon would have left him alone in Little Whinging. So they had been forced to take Harry on their yearly ski holidays with them and it had given him a type of freedom he had never felt before. Skiing was very nearly as good as flying. Grabbing his brand-new ski jacket, Harry zipped it up and after checking the address again, stepped into the floo and called out the name of the lodge, disappearing in a flash of bright green flames.
“I could hear you snoring from our room, come on out before you do catch a cold.” Harry was half tempted to stay there just to spite him. However, the smell of something good was wafting in from their room.
“Fuck,” Draco gasped as Harry slid into his body repeatedly, driving him crazy and nudging him closer and closer to losing control again. He had not come again so quickly since he was in school, far too many years ago, but he could feel his cock hardening again.
“It’s from Ron, we can let them know we’re alright, cold but alive,” Harry muttered a spell and the coin in his hand vibrated. “It was a clever little communication device Hermione invented when we were in Dumbledore’s Army, we could communicate without Umbridge ever finding out." Harry handed Draco the coin and could not hold back his bark of laughter at the look on the blond’s face.
“You knew that would happen,” Harry nudged Draco out of his way, and put the kettle on. “I’ve never had a baby owl before, Hedwig was fully grown when Hagrid gave her to me. He’s all fluff.”
Somehow, they both managed to get time off between Christmas and New Year, so it was a few days of lounging around the house, eating the tonne of leftovers both Molly and Narcissa sent them home with and sleep in. They met Hermione and Ron for lunch at a local cafe one day and had dinner with Seamus and Dean.
“I’d prefer it if you fucked me!” Harry said and despite being held down, easily broke Draco’s hold and rolled over, boldly waggling his arse at Draco. “I’m prepped and ready and waiting for your cock to split me open!” Harry said opening his legs so Draco could see he was indeed ready to be taken. They made love often, so they didn’t need a lot of preparation every time, and honestly Harry rather liked the pleasure and pain of being taken fast and hard. Course the best way to get what he wanted was to provoke Draco into giving him what he wanted. Harry knew damn well Draco would never really hurt him, but right now he was not in the mood to take it slow and gentle.
“Honey, I’m home” echoed through the flat and Draco quickly shooed the little owl into his box and tied the ribbon, ordering him to be quiet and walked out to greet his husband.
“So, how can I help you today? A special occasion? After something pretty? Spice up the love life?” she asked with a wink and Harry couldn’t prevent his chuckle.
“Pull a name out of the hat, instead of buying a gift for everyone; you just buy a present for one person,” Harry explained yet again.
Harry stood just outside the bathroom door, the soft light enough to see his sleeping boyfriend. He was curled under the covers, hugging Harry’s pillow, a small smile on his face. Grinning, Harry climbed into bed, wrangling his pillow back and tugging Draco close. Muttering something, he wrapped himself around Harry, snuggling close and immediately dropped back to sleep. However, it took Harry a bit longer. He kept reliving their night of lovemaking repeatedly in his head. From walking in and catching Draco in those red knickers to the sight of Draco secured to the bed with red restraints. Not for the first time, Harry wished Draco had been sorted into Gryffindor, but then again most of his wanking fantasies involved the blonde Slytherin curled up beside him, often involved them fooling around in the Slytherin dorms. As Harry started to doze off, he knew without a shadow of a doubt he’d be buying Draco more lingerie. The results were outstanding.
Harry just nodded and set to work on driving Draco to the edge. Harry hadn’t done this in a long time, but it wasn’t something he was likely to forget as he took Draco deeper and deeper, relaxing his throat muscles until Draco’s cock slid down his throat and Harry was nuzzling the pale hair at his groin.
“Dean if you don’t hurry up and marry that man, I will!” Ron told him, to everyone’s laughter and a snort of disbelief from Hermione.
With the soup heated up and bowls of tinned fruit, the oddest meal Draco could ever remember having, they settled down in front of the fire again, the only noise was of them hungrily finishing their impromptu meal.
Harry was just as speechless, the only noise in the cabin was the storm still howling outside and the crackling fire. Harry wasn’t even sure if he was breathing. He couldn’t take his eyes of the gorgeous blond man underneath him. Draco’s thighs felt solid beneath Harry’s and his hair just that little bit messed. Exactly what Harry had sometimes thought Draco would look like after a night of solid lovemaking. Hell, even debauched fucking would be fine right about now. Harry’s body had well and truly woken up and he was struggling to get his arousal under control.
“Merry Christmas Harry, we’d best get down before Molly sends someone up after us.” No one could open any presents until everyone was in the front room.
“I need to come!” Draco whined and to his frustration, Harry stopped the delicious torment and let Draco’s cock slip from his mouth with an obscene pop.
“Fuck yes” Harry hissed at the sensation of Draco filling him as he wrapped his hand around Harry’s cock. It was sensory overload and Harry knew he’d not last too much longer so he slowed down. Rocking his hips to their mutual gasps, it was the perfect angle so Draco’s cock head rubbed over Harry’s prostrate on each thrust. Normally it took a fair bit of manoeuvring to manage such a thing but clearly, Draco was just the right size to manage it easily.
“Fuck yes,” he hissed, “but I don’t have any lube, I don’t exactly carry it in my pockets.” Harry had never been more disappointed about that fact in his life.
Even though they were stunning, Draco deliberately avoided the snowy owls. He knew that would bring back far too many painful memories of Hedwig.
“Don’t move my pretty pet!” Harry ordered, and even in a whisper, he knew Draco would obey him. Walking over to the wardrobe he pulled out their toy box and selected a plug, not an overly big one but it would start to stretch Draco out but not enough that he’d not feel Harry’s entry. There was no fun in that. Smothering it in lube, Harry was pleased to see that Draco had not moved. He just stared at the sight before him. Draco’s long narrow feet planted on the carpet, bare legs spread wide that led up to those gorgeous red knickers, Harry made a mental note to thank the twins later, to where his arse was on display under the sheer fabric. Walking over, Harry smeared lube on Draco’s entrance to his moan and quickly slid a finger in.
Instantly awake, Harry listened again for the strange noises that had woken him. A dull thud and some vague cursing drifted up from downstairs. He knew it wasn’t any of his guests; they’d all left earlier in the evening after celebrating Christmas at 12 Grimmauld Place. The house should have been empty. From the noises coming from downstairs, it wasn’t.
“I figured you’d not stopped all day,” Harry put the mug down and leaned down to give Draco a quick kiss. “Bad day?”
“You alright?” he asked concerned. Harry knew he probably should have been gentler, he knew from previous lovers that he tended to get a little carried away but Draco didn’t seem to mind by the look on his face. Tiredly he nodded.
“They are gorgeous,” he rested his chin on Draco’s shoulder, “You should wear them, you’d look gorgeous in Gryffindor red.” He was only half-joking but honestly, he’d not been able to get the thought of Draco in the soft, sheer silk since Fred, or maybe George had given them to him. He’d be bloody gorgeous.
“You’d be doing what?” Harry snapped. The combination of alcohol and lust swirling in his belly made him bolder. Looking Draco in the eye, Harry deliberately swept his gaze down Draco’s, over the small flat nipples—the left one pierced by a small rose-gold serpent, the flat abdomen, front of those sinfully tight leather trousers. Honestly, Harry had never seen anything as sexy in his life.
Harry could hardly contain his wicked smirk at the look on Draco’s face. That, combined with his ever-hardening cock, was a reasonably clear indication that Draco was entirely on board with it. Grabbing Draco’s shoulders, Harry spun him around to his startled gasp and pushed him towards the bed, so his thighs were flush against the mattress. Putting a hand between his shoulder blades, Harry pushed them down with a determined force until, as promised, Draco was sprawled face down on their bed. His silk-covered arse the perfect height for Harry to take full advantage of, but that would have to wait a bit longer. Giving Draco’s arse a hard swat, Harry walked around the side of the bed.
“Harry please, touch me, I’m so close,” Draco gasped, he so badly needed some friction, he was frustratingly close but just could not tip over the edge. He’d have to thank the twins later, much later, for their naughty Christmas present, if this were the result. He loved it when Harry took charge, slaking his lust in Draco’s willing body. He never left Draco wanting though so he could not hold back his sigh of relief as he felt Harry’s hand grab his leaking cock and slowly start to smear his wetness to make the glide easier. The dual sensation of Harry’s cock sliding into him and his hand on his cock was enough to make Draco squeeze his eyes shut and try to hold back his orgasm as long as he could. He would never tire of the physical aspect of their relationship. They’d both had lovers before, both male and female, but Draco had never had one who let him explore the more in-depth, kinkier aspect of his personality as Harry did.
Harry leant forward until their foreheads were touching. Harry tried to get his wayward emotions under control. This was crazy. Until tonight he had not willingly told many people he was interested in men, yet in the space of a few hours, and a bottle of Firewhisky, he had unloaded all his secrets to Draco Malfoy, a boy he had actively fought against in the war, one he had very nearly killed.
“Oh, rubbish Harry, you’d have found some excuse not to come, I know you too well don’t forget. You work too hard, don’t look at me like that! I know the hours you used to keep remember!” Harry stuck his tongue out to her raucous peel of laughter. “Come on, Seamus is making his mother’s famous Irish stew for us and he’ll not be happy if it’s ruined.” Dragging him off the bed they walked back downstairs, chatting easily.
“You have a milk moustache,” Harry laughed as Draco swiped his tongue over his upper lip, removing most of the froth.
Harry had never quite got the hang of floo travel and so, came shooting out of the fireplace like a spell from his wand, straight into someone’s legs. Managing to bring them down like a bowling pin.
“Good,” Draco managed, planting his feet on the floor and thrusting into Harry, making the dark-haired man shudder and gasp above him. The flames from the fire caught the rivulets of sweat making their slow path down Harry’s chest, Draco couldn’t tear his gaze away as they made their slow progression over chest muscles, taut stomach and disappeared into thick coarse pubic hair.
“Come for me!” Draco ordered, surprisingly for Head Auror Harry loved being ordered around, well by Draco he did. By that little hitch in his breathing and the twitch of his cock, Draco knew his boyfriend was close to losing control.
“Oh Merlin, please give me Draco Malfoy in tight leather pants in my bed,” Harry had asked, staring up at the night sky. It was a blanket of stars, one of them shooting across the night sky.
“Very, come on let's go, I’ve not been on skis in years.” Pulling his knitted cap down over his hair and zipping up his ski jacket, Harry hurried over to the others, it was a short trip from their villa to the top of the mountain.
echoed around the house and finally, all was quiet. Harry watched the moonlight track patterns over the carpet until he fell asleep.
The new year hit with a vengeance; the weather dropped to well below freezing and Harry lost another coat and came home from work freezing. Draco shuffled him straight into a hot bath.
“I respectfully disagree, my parents were married long before my birth,” Draco said in the haughtiest manner he could muster to Harry’s vast amusement.
“I’m not going to last long,” he stammered, “Fuck I’m close.” Harry just nodded, giving permission for Draco to take over, which he gladly did. Draco knew he wouldn’t last long, only a few more hard thrusts before he was burying himself in Harry and holding still as he emptied himself into his new lover.
“I’m not a bloody girl Potter; I don’t need sexy lingerie, thank you very much.” Draco tried to snark, but he could not take his eyes off the sheer silk, running his thumb over them.
“You damn well stop now Potter and I’ll curse your balls blue I swear it,” Draco snapped to Harry’s chuckle as he carefully lined himself until he could feel Draco’s cock nudging at his entrance and muttered a quick lubrication spell. Harry preferred the proper stuff however he wasn’t going to waste time going upstairs to retrieve it, this would do for the time being and he made love often enough that he didn’t need a tone of preparation, even though that could be a lot of fun.
“Where the hell do you think you’re going?” Draco grumbled as Harry walked over to the bed, dropped the towel that was slung around his hips and climbed in, taking off his glasses and dimming the light.
“Merlin yes,” he gasped at the very thought. His embarrassment from being caught trying on the knickers had swiftly been replaced by uncontrolled arousal. He would always willingly and entirely hand himself over to Harry. Draco knew there was no way Harry would hurt him. However, he’d push his boundaries as much as he could, and Draco loved every second of it.
He admitted as Harry teasingly licked him, unerringly found that super sensitive dip under the head and Draco whimpered at the pleasure. He desperately wanted to touch, but the ribbons prevented him, all he could do was feel and it was a unique experience. Once he’d like to repeat - often.
By the time Harry left for home a little after midnight, he was more than a little drunk and melancholic. His thoughts turned to the ludicrous suggestions earlier. However, Fred and George’s comments kept coming back to him.
“I’m serious Draco,” Something in Harry’s tone must have sunk in as Draco finally took him seriously and looked around more carefully.
Harry put the mugs down on the shelf around the edge of the bath, checked and water and added some bath oils. They would help with the aches and went to wake Draco.
“That could be awkward if you had company,” Draco said smirking, the Firewhisky loosening his tongue. There was no way he would ever have had this conversation sober. “Wouldn’t do the sex life any good having your three kids burst in on you and some woman.” Harry just gave him a very confused, slightly inebriated look.
“Honestly, we have no idea, the third one Blaise thinks," she replied with a chuckle, throwing herself down on the bed. “I’m glad you could make it, Blaise does want the two of you to be friends.”
“Harry please, I need you, now please fuck me,” Draco begged he needed more than the plug could provide. He required warm living flesh; he needed his boyfriend reducing him to a quivering mess. Taking pity on his quivering boyfriend, Harry stood and lubed himself up, holding back his groan as he stroked his hardness, at the last minute he tugged the plug out and dropped it, stepping closer, he pulled the silk knickers to the side and lined himself up. Unable to look away, he watched as his cock slide into Draco. They both groaned at the sensation of finally being joined. Harry had to keep himself still for a few moments; he was too close to the edge.
Harry nudged open the bedroom door with his hip, careful not to spill the mugs of hot chocolate he was carrying and stopped, grinning, taking in the sight of Draco Malfoy in all his naked glory sprawled over his bed. Clearly, he still worked out, that was not the body of a banker, and Harry smirked at the oval-shaped bruises that decorated Draco’s hips. Carrying the mugs into the bathroom, he noted the bath was full. Spelling the water not to overflow was one of the more useful spells Hermione had taught him after one too many overflowing baths.
“Nice one, Potter!” Draco grumbled as he climbed to his feet, brushing off his still immaculate black shirt and trousers while glaring at Harry. Of course, his friends being who they were, not one of them came to his rescue.
“Well not really, I was thinking maybe black?” he really should have been better prepared, Harry followed Astoria over to the far wall of the store. Row upon row of things he had no names for.
“Oh, do you now? You like hearing what I intend to do to you, is that it?” Draco could only nod. “Maybe I’ll put those ribbons to use later? Tie you to my bed and have my wicked way with you, repeatedly?” Draco couldn’t prevent his whole-body shudder at the thought of it.
Moaning into the kiss, Harry grabbed Draco’s gorgeous firm arse and pulled him slightly higher so their cloth covered cocks ground against each other. The sensation amazing as Harry lost himself in a good old-fashioned make-out session. ‘
“You’re spoken for Weasley!” Hermione announced, waving her left hand at him, he just grinned and kissed it, swooning at her eye roll. Being the first of their friends to get married had not made the couple grow up at all, to Harry’s relief.
“Their brains too thankfully,” Harry said with a chuckle, “But they are great kids and have handled the divorce pretty well. Ginny and I both have an open-door policy; the kids live where they choose. So far, it has worked pretty well although I often have kids sitting down for breakfast who were not there for dinner. You have a son, don’t you?”
“Calm down. Once the storm passes, we can apparate back to the lodge.” Clearly, Draco was not convinced by the look he gave Harry as he dropped onto a chair.
“Well hello there,” he said quietly to the little bird who again chirped at him, slightly louder this time, as it hesitantly walked across the bottom of its cage and gave Draco a quizzical look. Immediately, Draco knew he’d found Harry’s new owl.
“You wish, Malfoy,” Harry replied, picking up on the joke easily as he wrapped his legs around Draco’s calves and easily flipped them, grinning in delight at Draco’s undignified squawk which soon turned to a moan as Harry started kissing his way down Draco’s now naked body.
“I know that, Potter,” Draco snapped annoyed “However, there are two of us and only one bed, and I am not sleeping on the floor.” He shoved past Harry and walked back to the kitchen, pacing around the small cabin, clearly agitated.
Breaking their connection Harry sat back and stared at the sexy man he was straddling. His heart was thumping and these ski pants were suddenly very uncomfortable. ‘
“Fucking show off,” he grumbled a grin breaking out and ruining his pout. Wandless magic had always turned him on, the sheer power of it.
“Oh no, I rather like you gift wrapped for my enjoyment,” the look Draco gave him was murderous but that just cranked Harry’s amusement higher. He’d have to thank Santa later, much later.
“Five o’clock, Ginny and Blaise want an early start on the slopes, before they get too crowded. Now get up. Weasley is cooking a monstrously large breakfast, clearly, he’s still cooking for that family of his.” Before Harry could snap back about Draco’s comment about the Weasleys, he had left, slamming the door behind him.
“Yes,” was all Draco could manage to whine, Harry’s naughty suggestion sent shivers over his body and heat straight to his cock. Not that he wasn’t hard enough already but the thought of being taken over the end of their bed wearing women’s lingerie, well apparently Draco was kinkier than he thought as he had no objection to that idea at all.
“Harry, you two have been circling each other since you were about fourteen and the hormones kicked into high gear. No one, who knew you then is the least bit surprised that you two have finally started dating. Of course, I know they are for Draco, why do you think I didn’t go for girlie pinks? So not his colour.”
“No, just the kids’ constellations and birth dates. They were painful enough, thanks; I don’t need more. I’m surprised you remembered, although I think I only had the boys then, Lily Luna has been added to the mix since then.” Harry fumbled for his wallet in his discarded jacket and opened it, tugging out a capture and handing it to Draco. “James on the left, Albus on the right and of course Lily in the middle.” Draco looked down at three good-looking kids, clearly, the capture had been taken on Platform 9 3/4. “Lily’s first day at Hogwarts, she was so excited. That was nearly two years ago, James was in fifth year and Albus third.” The pride in his voice was clear.
Blearily Harry looked at his alarm clock. It was 3:15 am, and he had no idea what had woken him. He had just started to drift off again when he heard it. A sad little hoot echoed through the flat. Trying to ignore it, hoping it was only the once. It came again. The saddest sound Harry had ever heard, and it was breaking his heart. Silently cursing his husband, and not wanting to wake said husband, Harry carefully climbed out of his warm bed, snatched up his flannel pants from the floor and dragged a t-shirt over his head as he padded down the hallway to the spare room.
“Not going to happen, Potter, you’d defend those kids with your life, and I know it. Fuck, listen to us, sitting around in a snowbound cabin, getting drunk and talking about our kids and ex-wives.”
“Any what?” Harry asked puzzled looking back over his shoulder at Draco who was now sprawled on the couch, an ankle supported on the opposite knee.
“It is a tradition in my family to name children after constellations his full name is actually Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. Astoria chose it, she was ready to burst, and we still didn’t have a name. We’d known for months it was a boy. She spent a small fortune on his nursery but it was worth it. I used to pace the Manor corridors for hours singing to him and don’t you dare bloody repeat that. He was a fussy baby, Astoria had bluntly told me that I had my Heir, I wasn’t getting another one, which suited me fine. I mean I would have loved another child, but not if I had to return to her bed to get one. The sex always was mediocre at best, nothing like this. I don’t think it was just that I was forced to marry a woman I didn’t love, Astoria always considered me just the ends to a means, Scorpius.”
Smirking, knowing he’s going to tease his husband mercilessly over this, Draco headed to the kitchen to start breakfast.
“Draco!” Harry growled warningly, he’d been adamant for ten years that he did not want another owl, but clearly, his husband had ignored him and gone against his wishes.
It was times like these, that Harry was grateful they had all managed to survive the war. Sitting around talking about rubbish, making each other laugh. These were the best times of his life, including Malfoy, who surprisingly, had a very dry, sarcastic sense of humour.
“Come on, let's get all your things hidden away, your new owner will be home soon.” Draco put him up on his shoulder and walked into the study, the little owl making happy little chirpy noises. Draco enlarged the rest of the owl’s belongings and tucked them out of sight. He didn’t want Harry seeing them just yet.
Ignoring the mess on Draco’s stomach, Harry leaned over and kissed him, trying to get his heart to calm down, it felt like it was about to thunder out of his chest.
“Is this a good enough reward?” Harry asked smirking at Draco’s very vocal enjoyment of his body being very thoroughly pleasured, “Don’t worry you’ll get your chance at the fucking part, this isn’t going to be one way.” Harry gripped Draco’s hips tighter and speed up, thrusting into him harder, making Draco take his whole length, not that he was complaining about it at all.
“Once Lily is old enough, I don't care so much but I’d like to keep it from her a bit longer, the fact her father likes men. Shit, what is in this stuff.” Harry raised his glass, glaring at it accusing. “I never open up like this to people, particularly, people I don’t know that well.”
Harry threw a Stinging Hex at Draco, who was far too drunk to move out of the way in time. However, it didn’t anger him as it would have done in the past; instead, he toppled over sideways on the couch, laughing his stupid head off to Harry’s annoyance.
“He’s still with a patient Harry, but he should be having a break soon if you’d like the wait?” The medi-witch on duty told him with a smile. Harry, like all the Auror’s, was well acquainted with St Mungo’s and he knew most of the medi-witches on duty.
“Where have you been all afternoon, it's after six!” Draco muttered as he put the roast chicken on the counter and checked the vegetables.
Draco was long and thick and Harry desperately wanted to impale himself on that gorgeous cock but first, he needed Draco hard and ready. Harry had a couple of steady lovers but it was just physical, nothing more than that so he’d not been exactly celibate since his divorce, so Harry was more than confident about his ability to send Draco over the edge.
Harry couldn’t help thinking as he did it again. With no warning, he leant forward and teased Draco’s entrance with his tongue, to Draco’s much louder moan.
Harry’s flat wasn’t far from the pub, but tonight his feet were not cooperating. It was close to twenty minutes later when he slotted his key into the front door. Dropping his scarf and leather jacket on the sofa, Harry plodded down the long narrow hallway. A faint Lumos from his wand lit the way.
“Your miles away Potter!” Draco grouched, slumping against the pillows and pouting. Harry dragged him closer and kissed him, sucking on Draco’s bottom lip to their mutual moans. He’d always looked so perfectly put together, not a hair out of place, and his clothes immaculate. Harry rather liked Draco a dishevelled mess he decided as he pulled back for air. Draco’s lips were swollen and red from their passionate kissing and Harry’s bites, his hair was a mess from where Harry had been dragging his fingers through it and love bites peppered his neck and shoulders. It was a sight worth getting excited over and Harry was pleased to find his cock was totally on board with that idea.
-Potter, who was fucking him, his childhood enemy turned lover, the flex of his shoulders and stomach as he gripped Draco’s hips and lazily fucked him. Harry clearly wasn’t in a hurry either, he was taking his time, his thrusts strong and deep but not hurried, enough to make Draco gasp and groan at the sensation of being so full, Harry was no slouch in the endowment department either.
“Well, we clearly came that way, so we just have to retrace our steps.” He replied, which of course would have been perfectly logical except that visibility was low. Looking up, Draco noted the sky was getting darker. By his calculations, it was about two in the afternoon but felt much later. “We need to find shelter and fast.” Draco shouldered his skis and started to walk towards the forest, grabbing his own Harry followed.
“Sorry for keeping you, how may I… oh hello Harry.” He spun at the voice, shocked to find Astoria Greengrass standing in front of him. She looked good in what was undoubtedly the uniform of the store; her blonde hair pulled back into a loose bun.
Draco was not one for public displays of affection, hell neither of them were. Two damaged boys, just trying to overcome shitty childhoods and move on from the war. However, Draco would do little things like this and Harry did not doubt how much his boyfriend loved him.
“I suppose you bought the rest of what he’s going to need?” Harry demanded in a disgruntled manner, burying his fingers under its chin and lightly scratching to its clear delight from the soft little chirps.
“Muggle expression, you look pleased with yourself.” Draco just shrugged, running his hands through his damp hair.
“It's up to you if you want to wear them and yes, I did go a bit overboard, but I couldn’t choose.” Harry didn’t mention the number of items he’d put back. For someone who was showered with gifts as a child, and Harry often bought him silly little things, it still amazed him how carefully Draco always opened his presents.
“Like this, fuck me into the mattress Potter!” Draco ordered, rather surprised how steady his voice was as he most definitely did not feel steady. It felt like his world had been spun off its axis, honestly it had felt off-kilter since Blaise had slipped him that obviously spiked drink. He’d get his so-called best friend back for that later, not sure if he could curse him for it or buy him that ridiculously expensive bottle of Thousand-Year-Old Ogden's Firewhisky that Blaise had been coveting for years. It wasn’t as if the cheap bastard couldn’t afford it himself.
“You and Draco may come in quite handy, that is, if he, and you, would not mind helping an old school friend. Daphne and I are thinking of expanding into men’s lingerie but had no one we could ask about it. We’d be more than happy to provide you with a good discount?” Harry shook his head.
“His mother and I divorced when he was two. We spent a lot of time hurting each other. I didn’t want him caught between us.” Draco got to his feet and rummaged through the cupboards in the tiny kitchen and came back with an unopened bottle of Ogden's Old Firewhisky and two mismatched glasses. “I think this conversation needs something stronger than tea,” he said cracking open the bottle and pouring an overly generous amount into both glasses.
“It will be my pleasure Malfoy!” Harry whispered, his voice dripping sin as he lubed himself up and nudged his cock head against Draco’s entrance. He was already loose from Harry’s earlier attention so it wasn’t too difficult to slip into their mutual groans. Draco was tight and snug and Harry knew without a doubt he’d not last long, even though they’d only come less than an hour ago, some sort of Christmas miracle as far as Harry was concerned.
“It's beautiful, so soft,” Draco said stroking the satin. Harry picked up one of the square boxes. “These go with it.” He didn’t want to come off as pushy about it, but Draco had seemed to enjoy dressing up as much as Harry had. Taking the package Draco unwrapped it to reveal the stockings.
Dinner was, as usual, a big noisy affair with platters being handed across the table, everyone talking at once and Draco loved it. It seemed he’d always been a part of this sizable, noisy family. He caught Harry’s gaze from the other end of the table and smiled at him. Once they’d finished eating Molly was dragged out of the kitchen and the adults set about cleaning up. They had learnt years ago she would not sit down unless forced to do so. Once the kitchen was clean, they all headed into the front room.
“You’re both welcome any time, let me know how he likes them.” She said with a wink handing Harry the bag. Waving he left the shop and wrapped his scarf tighter around his neck, it was cold out here.
“Draco please!” Harry whined, he needed to come too but being squished into the mattress there was no way he could get enough friction. However, Draco knew just how to fix that problem as he roughly rolled Harry over, dragged him to the edge of the mattress and as soon as his knees hit the carpet he had Harry’s cock down his throat, sucking him hard and easily shoved his fingers into Harry’s stretched, sopping hole. Harry came within seconds as soon as he felt Draco’s mouth on him and his fingers up his arse, stroking his prostate. “Fuck yes” was all he could manage before he came so hard Harry felt like he was about to black out.
“Not right now I don’t think, maybe later.” He knew to fight his blush was a lost cause, he could feel it heating his cheeks. Astoria merely turned and pushed the few bras she had chosen to the other end of the rack.
Christmas Day passed in the usual blur. Even after two years of dating Harry, Draco was still getting used to the abundance of it all. He’d been accepted into the Weasley family, even if Harry didn’t know about the threats to his physical wellbeing if he hurt Harry. By Christmas night they were far too tired to do more than cuddle under the covers and get ready to do it all again the next day.
“Well, I think I should come clean,” Harry scratched the back of his neck, trying to work out how to explain the situation. It wasn’t every day that a man found himself in the frankly bizarre case of buying lingerie for his current boyfriend, from said boyfriend’s former girlfriend.
“Ya not be wantin’ dat one Sir” Draco didn’t bother turning to face the man who had spoken, “Scrawny lil’ thing it is’, how ’bout a nice tawny owl instead?”
has speculated on it enough times. That’s why I don’t date and never take anyone, except Ginny or Hermione, to any ministry function.”
More than anything he was looking forward to feeling that deep ache every time he sat down the next day. Maybe a little sadistic but he’d always loved that reminder of the night before. Clearly driving his friends up the wall with his constant reminders of “
“Did you just come to traumatise us?” Fred asked filling their glasses again. Much as Harry was like a brother to them neither wanted to hear about his love life, particularly with Draco Malfoy. Harry just smirked, in perfect imitation of Draco, he’d rubbed off on him.
“It was only once I got older, and Albus was on the way, that I sat down and watched his pensive memory again. Yes, he terrified us as kids but he also put his life on the line every day, in his own twisted way, to keep me safe. Sometimes I hate him, others, I’m not sure what I feel about him. It was Ginny’s idea actually and I only really decided on his name the first time I held him but surprisingly it suits him. How did you name Scorpius?” Harry asked to change the subject.
Walking was slightly painful, it had been far too long after all, but it was well worth it. He had forgotten that familiar ache, the pain and the pleasure. Not that Harry had hurt him at all, he had been fantastic. Catching sight of himself in the small cracked mirror, Draco could swear it was a different man looking back at him.
Thankfully his legs were not tied together so Draco could spread them wide to give Harry easier access which he took full advantage of and rolled his balls in his hands, to Draco’s gasp. He couldn’t hold back his moans and gasps of pleasure, this was more than he’d ever experienced in his life.
’ echoed around the room as Ginny bustled around getting things ready. They finished up their breakfasts quickly, grabbed skis, and prepared to head out.
Harry’s blue ski pants were just tight enough to draw Draco’s attention and he couldn’t help wondering about the body hidden underneath. He had seen Harry in a professional capacity on more than one occasion, however ogling a nearly naked man with concussion, broken bones or hexing injuries and cuts and bruises were considered extremely poor form. Regardless, Draco was not dead and could appreciate how fit Harry was. It was hard to miss when the man was sitting on Draco’s examination table stripped down to just his pants.
“You’d damn well better!” Draco grouched, however, there was no sting in it. “Come on move, I can’t carry you.” Slapping Harry’s thigh, he clambered off Draco who rather forcefully shoved Harry down the short hall to his peals of laughter.
your colour!” Harry grinned at Draco’s indignant squawk at the thought of him being sorted into Gryffindor., that was even worse than being tied up and delivered to someone as a Christmas gift. teasing the pale body beneath his questioning fingers, Harry took his time. Circling the small nipples until they pebbled in arousal, walking his fingers down Draco’s stomach, watching him suck it in, either in arousal or ticklishness, Harry wasn’t sure, and lower until they danced above his pubic bone. Harry walked his fingers along it, looking up to watch Draco watch him and that was not a look of distress in his eyes. They blazed with lust.
“Well I certainly won’t say no to a bottle of this quality but what’s the occasion?” Fred questioned as George went to get some glasses. Cracking it open, Fred poured them each a generous shot, and they clinked glasses to cheers all around.
“Well, you’re… not gay!” Harry stammered, unsuccessfully keeping his eyes on Draco’s face. Those leather pants fit like a second skin, leaving nothing to the imagination and, to Harry’s astonishment, a small lightning bolt tattoo was etched onto Malfoy’s hipbone.
Harry snorted in laughter at the look on his boyfriend’s face. His pure blood sensibilities were offended.
“Oh, you’d be surprised who comes in here and what they buy but of course it’s privileged information but not all of it is for the gentleman’s wives shall we say!” Harry found himself grinning at her mischievous nature. He could see Draco dating her, she was a lot of fun.
“Oh yes, to Fred Weasley. George comes in quite regularly, but that was the first time I’d seen Fred. I didn’t realise he had a girlfriend. Now, what can I help you with.”
“He chose you?” Harry asked, puzzled, pulled into Draco’s story despite himself and Draco was right about one thing, he was a cute little owl. Right now, he was purely a bundle of feathers, but Harry didn’t doubt that he would turn into a beautiful barn owl.
Once the kitchen was cleaned up, Harry was damn sure Draco used every pan they had when it was his turn to cook. They settled down in the lounge room. Harry had his nose buried in a Quidditch magazine when he heard a muted shriek from their bedroom. Grinning, he tossed the magazine on the lounge and walked down the hall.
He had his head tilted so Harry could scratch under his chin, soft fluffy baby feathers soothed by Harry’s fingers.
“Yes, that’s his name, Owlbert Einstein,” Harry replied as he sat down, gratefully sipping on his hot tea “He’s still sleeping.”
“Oh fuck!” Draco swung around in horrified shock to find Harry standing in the doorway, his eyes glued to Draco in those knickers. Automatically he tried to cover himself up, but Harry wasn’t having any of that. “Don’t!” Harry snapped in his Head Auror Voice, to which Draco automatically responded and dropped his hands to his sides. Harry hardly even realised he’d crossed the room until he was standing right in front of Draco. He could not tear his eyes away. The silk was so sheer he could see Draco’s weeping cock through the fabric, a wet spot at the tip. Looking up Harry caught Draco staring at him and with a wicked smirk, Harry reached out and stroked him through the soft silk, relishing Draco’s low moan.
“I see you made it, Harry.” Ginny laughed as she helped him to his feet. Giving her a kiss on the cheek only to hear Blaise’s playful growl, Harry dusted himself off and looked around the room.
“That was actually far better than I expected,” Harry said leaning over to put his bowls on the table. “Molly and Ginny would be horrified, tinned soup - Merlin forbid," but his grin had Draco grinning along with him.
“So…orry.” Harry stuttered, and Draco could not stay mad at him. He could guarantee that some down on his luck wizard was now sporting a new warm winter coat.
There was every type of owl you could imagine, from barn owls to brown, screech, snowy, tawny and barred owls, according to the nameplates on their cages. None had been named yet that as up to their new owners.
“More!” was all Draco could manage, his body was no longer his own, he wholly belonged to Harry. There was something very freeing about handing over his pleasure into Harry’s hands. He’d been shocked the first time Blaise had brought up being tied down and used, Draco had been sure it would have triggered his anxiety attacks. However, Harry had been willing to try it, and the first few attempts had not been the best. Strangely enough, it had been Blaise that had helped them. As he was Draco’s best friend, he’d expected it to be incredibly awkward, but he’d keep it clinical, and they’d all be dressed. He’d taught them to accept the ropes and to give themselves up to the feeling of being taken care of. Before that Draco had just seen it as his freedom being taken away from him, now he relished handing all control over to Harry.
“Oh yes, you can’t get out of the Weasley clan as easily as that. Of course, Molly and Arthur were disappointed, they all were, but they have been my family since I was eleven so they understood. Ginny and I are far better friends than spouses. I’m guessing you don’t get on with yours?”
Early Saturday afternoon found Draco putting away washing, not one of his favourite jobs but still preferable to de-gnoming Molly Weasley’s garden, which is what Harry found himself doing. Tugging open their underwear drawer, he shook his head, typically Harry’s half of the drawer was a tangled mess, tipping the lot out on the bed Draco set to tidying it again. He would happily admit he was a bit of a neat freak, as Harry liked to call him, but honestly, his boyfriend was a slob. Sitting on the bed, Draco started re-folding the underwear yet again.
“No… um… we don’t… err… have any milk,” he stammered, licking his lips and trying to get his voice to work, “Is black tea alright?”
“You need to ask?” Draco stammered as Harry slid all the way in again, as close as two people could be.
“Yes Potter, I’m gay,” Draco took a step forward, instinctively Harry took one back. Back and forth, until Harry’s back pressed against the door, and Draco sported a far too familiar smirk.
“You’re a kinky bastard you know that?” A dopey grin on his face Harry held his arms out for Draco to crawl into them, soon as he did Harry kissed him, snuggling down under the covers and entirely agreeing with him.
“Hmmmm good,” Harry sighed, happy to let Draco take charge this time. His grip was tight enough to make it good, but not so tight they’d come too quickly. Harry was captivated watching the heads poking out from the end of Draco’s fist, and then disappear again, their pre-come pooling on Harry’s stomach. “Don’t stop.”
“From the look of that.” Draco pointed to the sky, “A blizzard is about to blow in and we do not want to be caught outside in it, our friends will be digging us out when it blows over if that is the case.”
Taking control of the situation, Draco finally had Harry where he had wanted him for quite a while longer than he cared to admit. He was not going to let the moment pass. Draco tilted Harry’s chin and slowly brought their lips together. He felt Harry’s shocked intake of breath, but he didn’t pull away. Letting Draco explore his lips at his own pace and he was in no hurry. Who knew if he would get another chance, he was going to take advantage of all he possibly could. Draco wasn’t even in a huge hurry to deepen the kiss, happy just to feel Harry’s lips against him, the wonder as he hesitantly started to kiss him back.
Boldly, he stuck his hand into Harry’s pants to his startled hiss. Maybe or maybe not, his hands were cold and grinned at the glare his boyfriend gave him. Soon enough Harry’s scowl turned into a contented sigh as Draco stroked him, nibbling on his ear and making him all hot and bothered.
“Yes, I’m going to feel it later but… I don’t mind.” Draco’s wince, however, gave him away to Harry’s light chuckle.
He walked over to see what Astoria was looking at and she grinned up at him showing him the boxed stockings.
“I’d best stop talking then?” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear as he gave it a not overly gentle nip, to Draco’s breathless gasp as Harry relentlessly ploughed into him. It was heaven and a little bit of hell. Draco knew he’d be sore tomorrow, Harry wasn’t being gentle and mercy he was built, it had also been far too long since Draco had done this but it was worth every ache, he’d have tomorrow.
me themselves if they could have got away with it. I don't even think it was the scandal of the divorce, but the fact they were no longer associated with the Malfoy name. It was all just for the prestige and image, they didn’t care that their daughter and I were making each other miserable.”
“Ready. When. You. Are,” Draco panted, in return, honestly, he was rather amazed his brain was still working as his body had completely shut down, it was running on pure sensation right now. “Fuck Harry please,” he couldn’t help his whine of frustrated pleasure. This is what he had always missed, the raw pleasure of being fucked. Astoria was far too much of a prude for Draco to bring up what he really craved. As much as he regretted his marriage, Draco adored his son, so something good did come out of it.
Draco had no doubt the little bird knew it wasn’t valued by the sad look on its face.  Draco opened the cage door and carefully lifted the little bird out, who then chirped and whistled at him happily.
“You mean you’ve not gone on a date since your divorce?” Draco demanded, horrified by the very thought. While he had not dated a lot, he had spent time with other people, yes mostly men, but he decided to omit that little fact. Harry just shook his head, not wanting to reply as he filled their glasses with the last of the Firewhisky.
“Your miles away, what are you thinking about?” Harry asked, propping his head on his hand and watching Draco.
“I’ll floo him later,” Draco said, dragging Harry onto the lounge for a make-out session. It was perfect weather for it as far as he was concerned, cold outside but their flat was warm and toasty, and his boyfriend was still damp from the shower, and if Draco was not mistaken, he was naked under those loose pants.
“Come for me,” Harry growled in Draco’s ear, leaning over him and trailing kisses up his spine to his shoulder. “I want to feel you lose control as I send you over the edge.” Harry wasn’t far off himself; he could feel it building in his lower belly, the pressure that he was trying to hold back, for how long he wasn’t sure.
Harry had celebrated New Year’s Eve in the pub with his friends. Ron had proposed to Hermione and her delighted acceptance. His best friend had been full of nerves when Harry had helped him choose the ring last month.
“Go on, get out and let us get dressed then,” Harry ordered his godson out of the room and tossed back the covers “hell it's freezing,” he pulled back the curtain and looked out. “You got your white Christmas,” he told Draco, who scurried over to hug his boyfriend.
“Course not, wouldn’t dream of it,” Harry dried off and pulled on an old pair of flannelette pyjama bottoms and an old t-shirt and walked out to their room. Sure enough, on the small table near the French doors, was a bowl of soup, a pile of buttered toast and two mugs of tea.
“What the hell guys, French knickers!” Harry complained, dragging the twins outside; they just grinned at him.
“Getting ahead of yourself a bit there aren’t you?” Harry gasped from above him and Draco looked up at him horrified.
“Always one to make an entrance, as usual, Potter,” Draco growled, clearly not in a forgiving mood. Harry just grinned at him, he knew by now that Draco was more bark than bite.
The sight spread out below them was breathtaking. The whole Glen was covered in a fresh dusting of pristine white snow, with just the odd animal track to mar the surface. The sun was just peeking over the far mountain ridge, bathing the morning in the light.
“What’s so funny?” Harry asked, close enough to make Draco jump startled. The messy-haired git just grinned.
“Fuck, so good,” Draco whined, frustrated at not being able to touch, but also turned on. The bastard was taking him right to the edge, his orgasm looming and then backing off again.
“Maybe I should bend you over the bed like this,” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear, close enough that he could feel the heat radiating off his body and his gasp at the naughty suggestion. “Oh, you like that idea, do you?” Harry reached down and stroked Draco’s arse, his hand quickly slipping under the loose silk. He had to admit they gave him much more comfortable access than Draco’s regular boxers and that bright cherry red was a stunning contrast to his pale skin.
Harry couldn’t remember exactly how he had ended up with an invitation to one of Blaise’s ex-stepfather’s ski lodges in the Scottish Highlands for a weekend skiing. He was not entirely sure which stepfather the lodge belonged to, but according to Ginny, it was impressive. Ten bedrooms, huge fireplaces, chef’s kitchen, underground cellar, the place apparently had it all.
Swirling his tongue around Draco’s nipple, he was rewarded with a low moan which in turn made Harry’s cock twitch in appreciation as he lightly tugged on the hard nub with his teeth to a louder moan.
“Fear not my fussy eater, Molly Weasley has taught me fair few cooking spells over the years. Might not turn it into roast pork but it will at least improve the flavour.” Glancing up Harry caught the almost terrified look on Draco’s face. “What?”
He couldn’t prevent his chuckle at the sight that greeted him. Harry was fast asleep on the lounge, curled up under the quilt Molly Weasley had made him for his first winter at Hogwarts and curled up, fast asleep against his shoulder, was the owl.
“And there is that famous Malfoy snark I’ve missed.” Harry carefully climbed to his feet, his legs wobbly and his arse sore. Putting his hand out he pulled Draco to his feet.
“You’re a bossy git, aren’t you?” Harry demanded in what Draco called his Auror voice “Is this what you need?” with that Harry let loose, thrusting hard and fast, slamming into Draco’s willing body to his gasps and moans. The slap of skin on skin loud in the room, their grunts and gasps adding to the general noise in the room.
“Well, come on!” he held his hand up and helped Draco step into the bath, making himself comfortable facing Harry and accepted the mug gratefully. The water was hot enough to make his skin tingle from the heat and he sipped the frothy delight with relish.
“I’m not exactly looking forward to facing your parents either, thanks,” Harry grouched. While he was thankful to Narcissa Malfoy for lying to Voldemort in the Dark Forest, Harry knew it had only been for Draco’s benefit. If she had known her son was safe, well Harry didn’t want to think of the outcome.
, Harry thought, but his famous Gryffindor bravery had deserted him. He had lied earlier when he told Draco he wasn’t interested in dating. It was more no one was overly interested in dating Harry Potter, saviour of the Wizarding World, the Chosen One, and divorced father with three kids.
, the door creaked open; the exhausted men stumbled inside and stowed their skis in the hall cupboard.
“Then show me, or are you all talk Potter? Scared?” Draco easily fell back into their childhood banter but there was no malice in it this time.
“Love you too,” he grabbed Draco in a hug and kissed him. “Thank you, come on let's eat.” That little telltale smile flirting around Draco’s mouth told Harry all he needed to know.
“Bastards,” Harry said laughing, but he could not get the image of Draco’s pale skin starkly contrasting to those red silk knickers, he’d be stunning. Draco also could not tear his gaze away; they were beautiful and so soft, he thought, stroking the silk. Draco shoved them back into the box. He knew he’d be thinking of them all day.
Unintentionally, Draco’s gaze drifted to Harry’s left shoulder, as he remembered the dates tattooed on the tanned skin. Draco had noticed them as he had set Harry’s dislocated shoulder. The second one had been fairly new at the time, the first one roughly two-and-a-half years earlier. Draco, at the time, had very lightly run his fingers over the numbers.
Finally, Astoria had loaded him up to her satisfaction and led him over to a small sitting area and proceeded to rehang all the frilly things onto a rack, fussing over them until they were to her satisfaction.
“Oh, shut up, it’s well after midnight. We can talk more tomorrow,” tugging the blankets up over them, Harry leaned over and gave Draco a soft kiss and muttered “Good night” and they settled down to sleep with the sound of the wind howling outside, but they were warm and contented, heading down another uncharted path.
“How about we discuss our childhood later? Much later?” Harry said before finding that legendary Gryffindor bravery and swooping in for a kiss. There was nothing tender in this kiss, it was all passion. Draco clearly didn’t mind as he returned it with the same fervour. Boldly Harry deepened the kiss and vaguely felt Draco drag him closer. ‘
Draco didn't have the strength to move, he was wrung entirely out but could not stop the stupid grin that decorated his face. He grinned sleepily as Harry carefully tugged the knickers off and man-handled him until he was more comfortable on the bed. Vaguely he noted Harry cleaning him up and tucking him under the blankets. Sleep rapidly claiming him; he watched Harry walk across the bedroom and disappear into the bathroom before the loo even flushed sleep had claimed him wholly.
“Nah, he just wants Malfoy in his bed,” Fred had suggested, curling his arm around Harry’s shoulders in laughter.
“Your wish is my command, Malfoy!” Harry snarked back and thrust in harder, enough to make the old bed complain loudly, the creak of springs and thump, thump of the bed head against the wall joined in the gasps and moans of the two men. However, Harry couldn’t hold back, it was all far too much as he gripped Draco’s hips hard enough to bruise, and bellowed his release into the room, shuddering as it was torn out of him, and into the willing body of his new lover.
“What the fuck!” he stammered, grabbing his glasses so he could see what was in his bed.  Instantly recognising that platinum hair and dragged the covers off the man asleep in his bed he demanded, “Malfoy, what the fuck are you doing in my bed?”
“Now, you’re going to be quiet when I put you in this box,” Draco held it up for the little owl’s inspection. “I’ll put in some air holes and paper on the bottom for you.” The little guy hooted as if he understood what Draco wanted and hopped over to inspect the box as soon as Draco put him on the table. Draco crossed his arms over his chest and watched with amusement as the little bird inspected his surroundings. For now, he was just a bundle of baby feathers, but he’d grow into a beautiful bird within a few months. Draco was sure of it.
“Well, the love life is pretty spicy as it is. I wanted to add to the collection. Do you remember selling a pair of red silk French knickers before Christmas?” Harry knew it was a long shot, but Astoria laughed.
“Rather yes, you were amazing, but it looks like we may be here for a bit longer?” Draco nodded towards the window at the bottom of the bed. In their haste, they hadn’t closed the curtains, not that anyone could see into the cabin, but it was clear the storm had set in for the night. It was still blizzarding out there, for which Draco was extremely grateful, there was no way they could be disturbed and there was enough food for a couple of days, even if it was that disgusting tinned soup.
“They’ll find us Malfoy, don’t worry,” Harry said, taking a seat on the other couch and sipping his tea. He had clearly misunderstood the look on Draco’s face and Draco was happy to let him continue thinking that. “What do you suppose this place is?” he asked looking around the small cabin.
“What the hell am I doing in your room?” Draco puzzled, still not awake. That sexy, sleepy voice making Harry’s insides squirm, in a not entirely unpleasant way.
“Come on, into the bath.” Draco steadied him as Harry stepped into the hot water, hissing at the heat and as his sore muscles relaxed. Dropping his head back onto the edge of the bath, Harry closed his eyes, letting the warmth seep into his bones as he listened to Draco tidying up in the other room. The faint murmur of Draco talking, probably telling Harry off, although he was doing a half-arsed job of it. Harry had been told off by experts, Draco was nowhere near in that league, he just used that damned disappointed look of his.
“Salazar you are fucking gorgeous like this.” Draco blurted out, not caring in the slightest about his confession, it was true. Harry was shamelessly taking his pleasure from Draco, gasping and moaning as he rocked his hips back and forward, his thigh muscles stained with the effort to slide up and down Draco’s cock. His dark hair was plastered to his head with sweat, both from his exertions and the warmth of the room and those green eyes fairly sizzled with lust. Draco was captivated, by the man riding him.
Glaring at Harry, he swung around and headed for the kitchen, slamming through the door to muffled complaints from the other side.
Winking up at Harry, Draco took him to the base again, before letting Harry’s cock fall from his mouth. Clearly, he was pleased with himself by the grin on his face.
Course that wasn’t very successful as now all his senses were on full alert and it was more intense. Vaguely Draco had to wonder where Harry got so damn good at this but decided to ask him much later.
Critically, Harry looked the little bird over. Right now, he was just a mass of feathers, big dark eyes looking up at his new owner quizzically. He gave a squawk loud enough to make both men jump and Harry couldn’t help his light chuckle as he carefully reached out to stroke the little bird. It ducked its head to allow Harry to pet him and lightly nibbled on his fingers.
“You are so damn gorgeous, miles of pale skin and sheer red knickers, I’ll never forget this sight as long as I live,” Harry finally started to move, slow to begin with, he wanted this to last. He gripped Draco’s hips, there would be bruises later and started to move, letting Draco feel every inch, relishing in his gasps and moans. Harry was aware Draco knew the spell to undo the ropes if he chose to. It was entirely up to him. Harry also knew he loved to be tied down on occasion.
“Fuck me once you've made me come, I need to feel you inside me, please?” Draco had hardly got his request out before Harry was kissing him again, tongue teasing Draco’s. Breathlessly Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s.
“Much thanks, I didn’t realise how late it was sorry,” Harry just shrugged flicking on the electric kettle on the filing cabinet and set about making the tea.
and hiding. He pulled open some cupboards and found some tinned soup and fruit. Not exactly nutritious, but he was hungry. Digging out a pot Draco dumped the soup into it and set it on the old stove. A quick spell had it heating up, and the other tins revealed peaches. Not hopeful, Draco opened the freezer but, of course, no ice cream. He couldn’t prevent his small chuckle.
“Seems our friends are sick of us Draco.” at his puzzled frown Harry continued “Well they gift wrapped you for me, says a lot don’t you think?” Harry trailed his finger down Draco’s chest, across the ribbon and circled it around his nipple, watching it pebble in arousal.
“Fuck Harry more please!” Draco needed more, Harry’s slow thrusts weren’t enough, he needed to be fucked, hard and furiously. He wanted to feel that deep ache in his arse for days. He wanted Harry to mark him as his. “Fuck me, damn you.” He snapped, frustrated to Harry’s shock; Draco could be a damn bossy bottom.
“No puffskein’s were hurt in the making of this rug,” he murmured kissing Draco again as he swung a leg over his hips. “Are you positive?”
He was just about to turn back after inspecting the last cage in the last row when a soft little hoot caught his attention. Standing still, he listened and eventually the sound came again. Bending down, Draco came face to face with a small white bundle of feathers, dark, sad eyes looking up at him. Draco couldn’t help his delighted grin at the tiny chirp directed at him.
“Fuck!” Draco moaned, he’d never had anyone do this to him. Sure, he’d heard stories but none of his lovers had brought it up and how the hell would you ask someone to do that?
Clearly, though, Harry was in no hurry as he lightly ran a line of kisses down Draco’s length and back up again, twirling his tongue over the soft head and back down again. It was bliss and Draco didn’t bother containing his sigh. There was no pressure, no need to perform, just lay back and feel, let Harry make him feel good, and he was doing a fantastic job of it.
“Draco, I understand. I saw one for years and I did have a family to talk to. We were all affected by what we went through as kids. However, if it ensures our kids can grow up safely, then it was worth it.” Harry’s explanation was cut short but his jaw-cracking yawn and Draco’s snort of laughter.
That look Harry gave him made Draco’s insides squirm in arousal, he had never wanted anything so badly as he did this. Ducking his head once more, Harry brought Draco back to full arousal in seconds, swallowing him to the base as he slid his fingers further back and traced them over the sensitive entrance to Draco’s body to his clear delight at his loud, unrestrained, moan.
“Are you coming, Malfoy?” Harry taunted, grinning at the glare he received from the blond Slytherin as he clipped on his own skis and took off down the mountain after Harry.
“I could ask you the same thing, Potter.” At Harry’s puzzled look Draco continued “You’ve stopped moving!”
Harry just stared at the little fluffy owl staring up at him from the box. It blinked at him a few times, adjusting to the sudden light and gave a tiny hoot, tilting its head and blinking again.
“It's just some leftover soup and toast, don’t go getting all sentimental on me!” Draco ordered to Harry’s amusement.
“Two, Pansy and Astoria.” Draco absently replied, still trying to get a peek in the bag. From what he could tell it was over half full. “How much did you spend!” he demanded to Harry’s smirk.
“Molly Weasley!” Draco said in a small voice. “I’m going to have to spend time with Molly Weasley! The woman who rid the Wizarding World of my crazy psycho bitch Aunt Bellatrix?”
