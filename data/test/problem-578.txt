“Hey… Draco…” He says his name like an experiment… one that turns out rather well, apparently. “Draco, it’s going to be all right.” His words are soft… warm. “It’s not for much longer. That’s why I came; your trial’s scheduled for tomorrow.”
Weasley is beginning to go pink around the edges. “My wife,” he says. “She reads.”
Robes, trousers, and pants are all swept away. He feels it then… something hard pressing against him. Fury turns to terror and revulsion gives way to a searing pain.

He uses his thumb to trace Harry’s eyebrow, along his cheek, along his jaw… he can feel Harry relax, fractionally, underneath him.
“I know… Thank you.”
… never mind that most of them had never committed a single crime…
Harry was still holding him tightly when Draco felt a tremor move through Harry. “Are you okay?” he asked.
Draco nods as Harry climbs onto the bed.
Maybe he just didn’t care enough to leave his friends….
“Hi guys,” Harry says, slipping his arms around Draco’s waist. Draco is taller than Harry, but Harry is stronger, and he leans back into him, wrapping his fingers around Harry’s wrists and dropping his head back onto his shoulder. He closes his eyes as Harry places a gentle kiss on his cheek.
“I am, my lord.”
“Bitter coffee… why am I not surprised?”

Suddenly Draco finds his arm firmly in Potter’s grasp… there is a swirl and the nauseated feeling of Apperating unexpectedly, that can
“He really hurt me. I deserved it… but still.”
Draco could only nod. And if Harry noticed a few hot tears escape Draco’s eyes and fall into the tub, he politely pretended that they were nothing more than a few drops of the water he was using to rinse the suds from Draco’s hair.
“Do you want to? Come back, I mean. You can.”

It’s a lie. But Draco is actually rather good at lying… especially to himself.
Harry’s body becomes welcoming. His mouth finds Draco’s, hot and tender and giving, and Draco finds himself sobbing slightly with the effort of keeping still.

“I’m not upset.” It’s so obviously a lie that Draco doesn’t even know why he’s bothered with it.
“That would be—”

“I’m so sorry.” Harry’s next breath comes out hard and fast… but his words are soft: “I could say it every minute of every day for the rest of my life and I will die never having said it enough.”

“No, thank you.”
Weasley cleared his throat. “You’re safe here, yeah? You-Know-Who’s been trying to kill Harry since he was a baby… and he hasn’t managed yet. I reckon wherever Harry is is the safest place to be, really.”
With a roll of his eyes, Harry takes the blanket and covers him with it.

Ron shut the door behind him and went upstairs.
Draco cried until his bones felt liquid. He cried until his eyes burned and he could barely breathe.
“I promised Ron I wouldn’t let you out of my sight.”
Hermione looks as though she is choosing her words very carefully. “Do you think you could do that? Love children that aren’t yours?
Ron feels himself being pushed in the direction of the Floo.
Draco moans again, this time sounding of hurt and frustration… and Harry recognizes it as such. “We’ll get there, Draco. We will.” Harry’s fingers are light on his cheek. “I know what you’re thinking… and if I was
Kingsley was always beside him… one more introduction… one more hand, one more smile… He fled to Romania the following morning.
Potter saw him first.
“No.” He puts the book down.
“It’ll be Egypt and Portugal this year,” Draco says, joining the conversation on Antonie’s side. “Portugal’s too good. There is no way Romania can beat them.”
He feels raw and naked and more fragile than he has… maybe ever. It takes him a while to realize: the fog is gone. It disappeared in the night, like fog does after wind and a heavy rain.
Almost unwillingly, Draco reaches for Potter’s hand… running his thumb across the raised lines that he knows spells out “I must not tell lies”… in silver now.
“Mmmm, uh-uh, Harry.” Charlie pulls him even closer. “I’m not interested right now in what you think

might have been. He is pain and fear… like a monster under the bed… or an illness. He isn’t a person that’s dead or in Azkaban… or even someone who’s still walking free. He doesn’t have a face… or a name. Draco isn’t sure he wants him to.
Bill says the same thing.
“No!” He takes a step back and bumps into the sink. Tears are streaming down his cheeks. He’s breathing but no air is entering his lungs. The world is going black at the edges.
He lets the conversation flow around him and over him.
Draco smiles. “You hardly need to ask if you can kiss me, Potter.”
The existence of the coffee shop is what makes it quaint, he supposes, pushing open the door, as if it were a perfectly normal thing to do—rather than a… quest… requiring every ounce of bravery Draco possesses.
That might help.
to kiss Harry… and he sucks, probes, and caresses until this time it is Harry that moans.
He looked broken… broken in a way that Harry had never seen before, not even on that horrible day in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Miss Harding continues as if he hadn’t spoken, “…then I don’t even need to see your identification.”
“Not at all,” I say. “Victoire and her dragon are sound asleep in Teddy’s room.”
Potter opened his mouth for a moment, then closed it. Suddenly Potter’s bright green eyes met his own, almost as if asking a question.
He needed the support of Harry’s hand to get in, though, and was grateful to find it, strong and gentle, right where he needed it to be.
Harry has come, like everyone else, to fuck someone he can’t have. He thinks he is buying an hour with someone who is wearing Draco’s face… because Draco disappeared without a word. And, apparently, without a trace.
It had taken months, with Draco flooing over every night at Rose’s bedtime. They had started slowly… with Rose only reading a word here and there. By the end of the book she was reading pages at a time.
“He hanged himself,” Harry says quietly, not looking at Draco. “Just about the time you disappeared. He couldn’t make his payments either and he chose… differently….”

In the darkness, Harry whispered something. Draco’s eyes cooled and his nose, sinuses, everything cleared. He could breathe easily again.
“I… er…”
A bright shaft of sunlight streams in through the drawing room window and lands on one of the stylized peacocks woven into the Oriental rug. He never told anyone… but when he was very young he had named each of them: Morganna… Salazar Slytherin… Hecate… The sunbeam is illuminating Harry Potter.

Draco doesn’t say anything about St. Mungo’s… but Harry almost wishes he would. He was sick again this morning.
“He doesn’t,” Potter says shortly. “Everyone wants to date the Savior of the Wizarding World… but finding someone who wants to date Harry Potter? That’s harder. The last bloke I went out with was Muggle—are you shocked?”
Draco thought for a moment. “Yes,” he said, “I think I could eat that.”

“But… there’s lots of space here…”
Rodolphus is still arguing for Romania when another voice joins in, suggesting that the Jamaican team, which isn’t completely out of the running yet, might take a place in the World Cup.
Harry whimpers.
“You utter philistine,” Draco groans.
Without quite meaning to, Severus found himself reaching for the boy. He was trembling, and he leaned into Severus’s touch in a way that alarmed the older man deeply. Last year Draco had been a fox in a trap, snapping at the hands that tried to help him. Now he was passive.
“Shhh… You’re safe
“Yes,” Harry says. “Thank you.”
Harry exhales, sort of a cross between a sigh and a humorless laugh. “I doubt it. I think those are all the big ones, though.”
Draco was safe… and in the one place the Dark Lord couldn’t reach him. And the Dark Lord was blaming Macnair for Draco’s disappearance….
“I wanted to fit in… Somewhere to belong. I’d never… I’d never had a
“Shhh…” Harry’s voice.
Perversely, while the Polyjuice potion steals every feature that belongs to Draco, any pain inflicted on the not-Draco does not fade with the borrowed body. The pains stays, shooting through him when he moves; the bruises remain and Draco’s body is covered with them… though they are masked, of course, by the next dose of Polyjuice.
pyjamas—he sleeps in his boxers and a tee-shirt if it’s warm, or baggy sweats if it isn’t. Tonight he’s wearing sweatpants so large that I expect he has to hold them up when he walks, and a faded, threadbare Gryffindor tee-shirt that is at least one size too small. It makes him look so fucking fit… and like a lost child.
“I am entirely at your disposal.”
from here. Stop acting like I’ve agreed to lead packs of Muggles on a six week trek through the Andes Mountains.”
Potter’s smile returns. Genuine and full. “Yeah. Sometimes people go out to a special theatre to see them… but you can watch them at home, too. I like that better, if I’m being honest. Do you want to pour the wine while I set this up?” Potter asks, standing up.
“Yeah.” Harry holds out his other arm, and Malfoy draws his finger down the mark, long and twisting, where Wormtail cut him that night in the graveyard; Malfoy’s expression is very shuttered. Harry thinks he knows why… it’s where a Dark Mark would be… if he had one. It even has the same curl at the bottom.
They land in the front hall of Grimmauld Place, Weasley frowning and Draco shaking, gasping for air, tears streaming down his face. For a long moment they stand like that, Weasley’s hand still firmly on Draco’s.
Draco looks at her, his eyes threatening to overflow.

Severus wasn’t sure what sort of melodramatic flair had caused the Dark Lord to leave the comforts of the drawing room at Malfoy Manor and traipse them all out to the cemetery on the edge of the estate, but it could hardly bode well for young Malfoy.

Clashing with horrid Victorian wall paper is one thing. But clashing with his beautiful roses.
“Nothing you don’t want, Draco.”
“You could,” Harry says, a small smile finding his lips.
“Of course not,” his aunt snapped. “
Draco is trembling with the effort of staying still, of not pressing further into Harry before he is ready, of only moving his hand, tracing the contours of Harry’s face. His thumb passes over Harry’s lips, and he thinks Harry kisses it.

Black-eyed susans stare at him; he thinks they look censorious.

In truth, he didn’t handle it very well and had to cancel his next appointment because he couldn’t stop vomiting. Elladora was

on his bed. He doesn’t make it into the garden the next day, which Draco pretends is the fault of the rain.
“Anytime.” Harry glanced at the tub. “I think it’s about ready.”
Blaise always wanted to be completely open about their relationship… to walk through the halls, hands clasped, light and dark. Draco thinks of Blaise’s hands … he thinks of his lips, soft and gentle against his own. The thought of touching… kissing… of the
“Okay…” Potter is backing slowly from the room. “I’ll… just let you… read, then… until dinnertime.”
Harry feels the corners of his mouth turn up a little, imagining a young Draco, still pointy, but soft-eyed in the way that Hermione gets when she's researching, pouring through the ancestries in the Manor library... looking for information about his personal star-crossed lovers.
Three treats later, she is lying by his side.
Draco picked up Harry’s hand and kissed it.
“Yes, sir. Goodnight, sir.”
“Good,” Draco replied, and pressed his face back against Harry’s chest, though he was no longer sure who was holding whom.
Draco would have cried. But he can’t; tears, like words, are forbidden to him.
The house they come to is quiet and dark.
“We went to the same school…”
Now Harry’s lying on the bed, Draco beside him… just waiting for Isolde to return with the time of the appointment.
It means the door shutting behind him, leaving Draco on the floor of the white, windowless room, shaking and sobbing and in pain, his eyes burning from the tears he is unable to shed.
Draco looks up into the man’s eyes. He is holding out a fresh handkerchief.
Harry gasps.
“It’s a school night,” Draco says. “But I think I have time for one more glass of wine.”
“No. How could I?”
Draco feels a thread of unease… not

They’re little more than rags.

Weasley nods slowly and sits down beside Draco. “Should I be apologizing?” he asks.
Harry’s hands are on the waistband of his trousers, the tips of his fingers barely slipped inside. “There’s something I want to try. Will you let me?” he asks.
Draco squeezes back and forces his throat to open, forces his voice to obey him. “Cappuccino, please.”
A pause. “What?”
He’s not sure he can put into words… or even

He still refuses to count the number of clients Elladora sends him, but he is sure she is sending him more. And they are almost never gentle.

Before the Dark Lord returned… and turned his life upside down.
They’re standing at the edge of a cliff. Draco doesn’t know what’s at the bottom; Harry doesn’t care.
“I interviewed them,” Granger says, fingering her Department of Magical Legal Affairs badge. “Three girls and a boy. All Squibs. They all seem to be there voluntarily.”
Malfoy’s eyes are grey, more fog than storm, and flecked with hints of blue and green and even lavender. When he speaks his voice is ragged. “I… I think I’ll have that shower now.”
“I know more than anyone what he’s capable of, Malfoy and you don’t see me aiding his genocidal maniacal plans.”
Someone Harry couldn’t see cast an Expelliarumus at the attacker and Harry followed with a Stupefy in quick succession which hit him square in the chest. Harry felt the heat of another Confringo at the back of his neck.
“Okay good. Tell me how it goes as soon as you get back or I swear to Merlin I will hex you senseless, Draco!” Pansy threatened with a serious look on her face but laughter behind her eyes.
Malfoy stepped closer, both of their wands now digging into the others flesh.
Harry then looked back round to Draco and spoke with a controlled and level voice, in an obvious attempt to not betray anything with his voice, but failing when all Draco could hear was hurt still. Hurt that then made him feel pain as well. Pain in his heart that was now aching with guilt and the wanton desire to just fuck it all and tell Harry how he really felt and what he really wanted. “
was beautiful and it was the most fabulous, amazing magic he’d ever experienced in his life.
Draco moved and sat on Harry's lap, smiling broadly because
Harry could hardly get the air into his lungs to respond to his husband. Without even thinking about it, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, surrounding him, holding him tight.
, Harry marvelled,
Draco sighed at the amazing kiss, his body going pliant and submissive under Harry's hands. He wanted, at the same time, that Harry touched his breasts, and that he didn't, because they were so sensitive. They would usually stop being like this in one or two days so...
. The feelings he's been hiding threatened to come again, and Draco bit his own lips. He wouldn't cry anymore. He had the whole day of crying. Now it was time to be as strong as Pansy and move on.
, but still have no courage to do so. This was... The first one of many things I'll tell you... Just give me time... Can you?”
. Wood has told him the muggles who lived locally believed it was deserted, but it was actually a thriving wizarding community.
Harry bucked his thick, lengthy cock into Draco’s mouth. Somehow it felt better even than earlier. It was hot, sexy and so, so fulfilling, and Harry was coming before he knew it.
“Can our baby tell we’ve just had sex…?” Harry wondered, yawning loudly. “Obviously, they don’t know what sex is, but you don’t think it hurts them do you?”
. Theodore Nott came here with news and
Harry rubbed his hard length against Draco’s hip, panting.
everything. She grabbed the first thing she found - one of Harry's Quidditch trophies, perfect. - and threw it as hard as she could against a wall. It didn't broke, but dented the wall. She walked, grabbed it again, came back to her previous spot, and threw it even harder.
He looked dead into Harry's eyes, his face serious.
He walked to the living room, dressed only with his undergarments, trying to calm down, but his mood was obvious.
That was only a very little part of Harry, however. The rest of Harry didn’t give a single Sickle. Draco was inviting, wet and warm, and very, very sexy, and despite the odd, elemental nature of their lovemaking, Harry didn’t think that he would last very long. Already he could feel the warmth growing in his penis, and a tickling loop of desire starting to uncoil inside his belly.
“Potter, I said
“You are sexy, Draco... You are the most alluring, beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. And we don’t have to sleep together, but please know this: it doesn’t matter because I love you.”
Harry took a deep breath, enjoying the sweet scent of the perfect man lain beneath him, unsure whether to tell Draco the next part, but deciding to repay the omega’s own honesty.
He kissed his alpha fiercely, and they cuddled for a moment before starting their new morning. Draco asked to help him do breakfast, and although he wasn't the best of cooks, he was surprisingly good when following Harry's directions on how to do things. He hoped one day he'd be good enough to wake Harry with a homemade breakfast. But, everything on its own pace.
Harry’s Uber pulled up to the Bright Sun Hotel and he hurriedly paid the fee. He’d not done anything like this before in his life. He’d been childhood sweethearts with Ginny, and no other omega had been more than a one-night stand.
“I can't wait to come back home...” Draco sighed, lifting her hand up to Harry's hair and caressing him behind his ear. “Do you think she'll like her new house?”
Harry knew he was using Draco like a rag doll, but in the heat of the moment he couldn’t help himself. It had been so long since they’d fucked and he felt like his self-control was deserting his body. He was bouncing Draco off his cock, using her hips for leverage, throwing her about like she weighted next to nothing.
about threats to us. I can see you’re vulnerable, and upset right now and I’m sorry I didn’t communicate how I was feeling more clearly. I’ve never been a man of words; I’ve always been better with actions.”
“Is Jim starving again, Draco?” smiled Harry, leaning in to kiss his husband’s middle. “Let me just finish my cuppa and we’ll go get you some celery... But let’s go to the Muggle one down the road, I can’t stand the hassle when we go to Diagon alley. Being the so-called saviour isn’t so great when they report what brand of toilet roll you’re buying... That sound okay with you love?”
“I don’t want to forget it,” he wrote quickly. “Don’t worry sweet thing, I’m already on the way. You’ve not done anything wrong... I’ve never seen anything so sexy in my life.”
“Draco,” he replied, “Ginny is a good person, really straight forward. And we’re going to meet Lyra later this week, so Ginny will hear every detail about you after that anyway! I know we’re not together anymore but we still talk most days, catching up over Lyra, and every time she leaves Lyra at mine or I leave Lyra at hers. Tell her you’re my new boyfriend...”
He looked up sharply at the use of his first name. She was his friend and confidant on more than one occasion, but the witch was resolutely professional and only used his official title at work.
Draco was still early enough in her pregnancy that they could apparate, so they swirled and disappeared to an apparition point in Covent Garden, one of the most luxurious shopping areas of central London.
Harry was excited to get a message from Draco’s phone. He typed a quick reply.
He got up the bed, putting his tee shirt again and trying to fix his hair.
But Harry shook his head, trying to dislodge these silly, romantic thoughts. Draco didn’t seem to want that future, and he couldn’t... wouldn’t have another baby with an omega who didn’t want a future together.
Harry had never seen a more tempting and enticing sight than the man in front of him. So willowy and slight, Draco looked almost ethereal in the candle light of their room.
“Take me, Harry. I'm all yours.”
Harry has to laugh at their baby. Jasmine has gone completely puppy-crackers. She wouldn’t wear her nightie unless Harry charmed little puppies to run around the hem. She wouldn’t put her toy terrier down and she was driving Draco round the bend
Harry found himself marching back towards their home, his good mood having evaporated. He wanted Draco to be honest, to tell him what had happened.
Harry didn’t have time for another word as the limousine had arrived at the factory. He swallowed down any further words as the driver came around to open the door. Harry respected Draco, letting him exit the car first. It wouldn’t do to give anyone anything to gossip about.
It was like Mr. Weasley had told him, one night after they’d both had too much to drink.
Draco was sweating all over, he could feel the droplets of sweat falling down his nose.
“It would be awesome to have the Minister to perform our bonding. I'm sure it will be out on the news even if there's no reporter there.” Draco grabbed one of Harry's arms and put around his own shoulder, tucking himself on Harry's side. He put his legs close to his body, and continued. “It is one of the old Black estates. We haven't done anything with it because it's only an empty land with some greenery. But I think that we can have it all trimmed and full of flowers by the time we marry, and a beautiful gazebo in the middle. It will have space for all of our guests
It wasn't quite as easy for Draco. When he arrived home, he had no will whatsoever to do anything. He had foregone supper, and lay in bed thoughtfully as he remembered everything that happened in the weekend. He thought of Harry, his amazing Harry, taking care of him, being gentle and loving. If he focused enough, Draco knew that he could still feel Harry's body against his, taking over him, taking everything Draco had to offer...
“That’s a lot of questions there, Draco,” whispered Harry, caressing the side of the omega’s face. “Firstly, nothing on the planet could keep me away from you tonight. You could be a dangerous addiction for me to have, omega. Dangerous indeed.”
“But that's the thing, Harry... I'm... I'm not sure
“You do realise that my wife is in the middle of an incredibly sensitive pregnancy? Draco might act tough but you and I both know that she’s worried about the baby. And so am I! Bloody hell, Oliver. You might have given me a bit more notice. And, absolutely, she’s coming with the team. I’m not going otherwise.”
He wanted to prove himself to his boss...
Harry looked at his husband’s beautiful globe of an arse, and willed down his cock that was starting to stir.
“Potter, Potter... You can't even keep your hands to yourself... I think I'll end up pregnant before the end of next year.” Draco licked his lips, his hands going up and touching his own nipples. “What are you going to do with me now? “
“People used to say I was handsome at school... but it's different when you say it.” Draco admitted, raising his head and kissing Harry on the mouth, slowly. “Do you want to come back?”
"Also, don't forget about the meeting. I need to address some issues we're having." He sent after, starting to prepare the power point slide he would show in the meeting.
Even thinking about Ginny’s news set his heart racing and made him feel a little sick. It was certainly nothing that he felt ready to tell Draco yet. He could hardly even admit it to himself.
His lips were all over hers, enjoying the   soft scent of her hair, and the velvety feel of her mouth.
“I'm Jasmine's mother!” The words were out so harsh and fast out of his mouth that Draco felt surprised with himself. He licked his lips, blinking, trying to remain calm. “I... I'm sorry, I'm... Harry, I'm confused... I’ve been confused for a while now, since… Since before
"Harry... I... I really wanted to say what I'm feeling right now... But I don't think I can put it into words..." Draco said, looking at him and caressing his hair. "Are we forever?"
“Draco,” Harry replied from the kitchen. “You look more beautiful than ever. I thought you’d enjoy having a lay in, but I had to get up for Lyra. Ginny came by earlier while you were asleep, so she’s gone home now. I’m just making some lunch. Quiche and salad? Does that sound okay?”
Harry finished putting on his clothes and sprawled next to Draco, talking up a big chunk of the mattress. Fidgeting with Draco’s wand, he cast a healing spell over his lover.
Draco came again with only the stretch of Harry's knot in his cunt. He was absolutely spent, and he knew that some omegas went on it more than once. He hoped his body decided it was okay to stop now, because he was absolutely sure it was impossible to come anymore.
Now, the button pressing. He took a while to learn how to do it, but after two months, it was almost natural. He counted on his head.
Draco smiled, kissing him and holding him by his neck, his fingers caressing Harry's hair.
"I didn't try to diminish your feelings. I do believe you
“How do you imagine it is going to be, Harry? Super tight? I guess it will. It felt tight on your fingers only... Do you imagine it will have a good taste? Do you think you can make me come with your mouth only? Or, better yet, with your
“Your name and reason for visiting,
the annoying voice in his head that he kept trying to shut off.
Harry didn’t know what to do. There was half of him that wanted to jump, Draco right there and then and just kiss him until he stopped looking so rejected and vulnerable. He didn’t like seeing him like this. Harry was used to seeing the cocky, teasing, Malfoy side of Draco. This was something else. This was him reaching out to him. Letting his guard down and exposing his vulnerability. This was Draco. Not Malfoy. Then the other half of him knew he had to say something but didn’t know what. He didn’t even know himself why he had kissed Draco. It was just a spur of the moment thing. Well, a spur of the moment thing that had felt like his whole life had been leading up to. It had felt so right. So natural. He didn’t know how he hadn’t realised this before. When he was at Hogwarts he just put his fascination with him down to loathing and suspicion, but that wasn’t it was it? It was always him. The blonde haired boy from Madam Malkin’s that he had met when he was 11. Goddamn it, why was his life never simple?
Now that Draco was gone, Harry went to sit at his desk to attempt a start at today’s case load, trying to avoid thinking of pink lips and grey eyes, before he suddenly thought,
Harry looked like he was ready to cry out of frustration and ran his hand through his hair with more force than was necessary. “Don’t you feel it? Don’t you feel what I feel when you kiss me…when you look at me? Please don’t do this again Draco. Don’t push me away.”
Maria nodded and left the room, leaving Harry and Draco alone again. Neither of them looked at the other for a few seconds, both standing either side of each other not speaking. “Well I better go. I don’t want to keep Kingsley waiting.” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck nervously.
bodies fuelled his anger to boiling point. He was catching up to the blond and somehow he just knew it was him.
“What is your name?”
what on earth was getting into him? His robes clung to him in all the right places, however, and he found himself unable to look away from his toned looking torso for longer than he would have liked. He looked back up and moved forwards towards Harry, just wanting to be closer to him and see if he was alright.
“Please say something.” Draco whispered.
“Yes but it’s not completely out of the blue is it, you twit! How many times have I told you that I thought there was something there between the two of you? I mean at Hogwarts, there was hardly a day that would go by without one of you seeking the other out to have a go at the other or without one of you constantly looking at each other’s tables at meal times. I mean, come on he practically stalked you for a bit there in sixth year, Draco.”
Draco’s eyes were shining with unshed tears as he tried to compose himself. He couldn’t hold back his emotions anymore, however, and he stepped back from Harry, pulling himself out of his grip. He turned his back to Harry, his muscles visibly tightening, his voice rising with every word he spoke. “HARRY I SAID I CAN’T OKAY? JUST STOP! I’M DOING THIS FOR YOU WHY CAN’T YOU JUST EXCEPT THAT AND LEAVE IT ALONE?”
Harry quickly responded, “Oh, no. I just kinda figured that you wouldn’t want everybody to know our business. I’m kinda used to it, being Harry Potter and all. It’s kinda annoying.”
The rest of the week passed by uneventfully. As the weekend rolled around Hermione said to him in passing, “Oh yeah, McGonagall wants to see you.” He had been sitting in the common room, trying to get his potions essay done, but his mind kept wandering to where that week had taken him.
Gregor spun and grinned. “How are you today, Harry?”
I hope you enjoyed this!
Hermionie said hesitantly, “I don’t want to ruin the moment, but why don’t you guys go back to the dormitory? It sounds like it’s been a really long day for everyone.” Harry nodded and reached out for Draco’s hand. “Let’s go relax.”
“That doesn't change that I was the one to let Death Eaters in. I was the one to fix the vanishing cabinet.”
(See the end of the chapter for
As everybody rushed down the halls to breakfast, he noticed that Ron and Hermionie weren’t walking next to each other like they normally did. Maybe it had something to do with the argument they had that morning, but he decided to stay out of it unless they decided to include him.
Harry saw that Ron and Hermione were both sitting in one of the many sofas found in the common room, along with a few other students who he didn’t know. He walked over to his friends and said that he needed to talk to them tomorrow after classes near the lake.
Here's another one for the people. Thanks Liiizzaabeth_Rose
As everyone got prepared for bed and drifted off, Harry thought of all the things he had learned tonight. He hadn’t realized how many people were bent, or how many people had gotten together. And... Parkinson and Luna could actually become a thing... Wouldn’t that be something?
“Dean, Truth, or Dare?”
“Most of them were burned. I chose my favorites, and they were hung on the wall of my room.” Draco paused again and looked at Harry. The brunette noticed and gave a soft smile, leaning forward and giving his boyfriend a soft kiss.
Draco looked confused and said, “Wait, wasn’t he dead?”
The blonde smiled. “I like that, but I propose a detour on the way back here. If I can find it, I have something to show you.” Harry nodded, and the two headed off to dinner.
Shaking it off, he said with a grin, “Truth or dare, Malfoy?”
As he flew up into the air, he closed his eyes. He felt a sense of freedom in the air, like nothing in the world mattered. He took a deep breath before opening his eyes and taking a first glance around for the snitch.
Malfoy looked surprised, but not scared. “Truth. I’m not drunk enough for a dare yet.”
The Hufflepuff’s jaw dropped and he said, “You can do wandless magic?”
Draco knocked and tentatively walked in. As soon as he was across the threshold, he shut the door and threw up a wandless silencing charm.
McGonagall has a conversation with Harry.
————————————————————
Pansy said, “Wait, I wanna see it when he hexs you, can we come with you after dinner?” Harry laughed as Draco glared at Pansy.
Harry looked at him sadly, “I am going to talk to her. She is distraught. I’ll be back later, but first, is there anything I can do for you?”
Second, thank you Liiizzabeth_Rose, you have been amazing.
Harry nodded, definitely some claustrophobia. “What can I do to try to keep them away?”
He was startled and said, “Am I interrupting something?”
Harry was very surprised. He hadn’t expected that. He supposed he should tell Ron about Draco too… He took a deep breath before slowly saying, “I have a crush on Draco. We are now dating.”
————————————————————
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry could see the moment that Draco brought his guard up again. The tears that had been welling up in his eyes disappeared, the emotion on his face was hidden. Draco said, “Thank you. It’s tough for me to show my feelings to anyone, and you guys are really supportive.”
He entered the classroom and sent Ron a look that said something along the lines of ‘panic attack, talk later,’ before returning to their station to look at the instructions. The rest of the period passed pretty quickly with nothing out of the ordinary.
I hope you enjoyed!
He smiled, and introduced himself. “Hello. My name is Gregor Hollins. I assume you’re Harry Potter?” He nodded. “In this room I like to drop formalities. You are completely welcome to call me Gregor. Are you comfortable with me calling you Harry? As he finally found his words, he said, “Yes.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron growled, saying, “Do you really believe that? Mate, he’s Malfoy, he isn’t going to change!” Ron turned his back and ran his hands through his signature red hair as took a deep breath, trying to keep himself calm.
Hermione smiled and said, “No problem. Also, everybody went back to their rooms to get ready for dinner,” before walking out of the room. Harry turned and smiled at Draco and just stared in wonder for a moment before walking over to him and kissing again. It wasn’t like before, it was soft and sweet, unlike the desperation and desire in the kiss before.
“I would like to know, how much did the professor tell you?” He responded carefully, “Not very much. As I understand it, you were not told about being a wizard, and when you got your letter they tried to keep it from you. Anything else I should know about?” He took a deep breath before he started talking.
Harry sighed. “I am still going to talk to McGonnagal in the morning. She can make an announcement to the whole school, and we don’t have to embarrass one specific kid. Anyways…” He trailed off, unsure how to put his next words. After a few moments, Draco said, “Hey, it’s alright to not talk about it all now. After all, this is the first week we’ve been together.”
“Hermionie, when I first told her, said she was excited. Ron… I guess I’m not really sure. He’s fine with me being bi but doesn't really like the idea of me being with Draco. I wish he would understand just how much he’s changed.”
I think I will be able to post one more chapter today, but if not I will almost definitely tomorrow morning.
Sitting on one side of him was Hermione and on the other, Neville. Next to Hermione was Ron and next to Neville was Fred. Some of the faces in the circle were familiar, like Fred, George, lavender, Dean, Seamus, and Parvati, but there were about fifteen others he did not know.
Walking away he wanted to go to his bed, and cry for the rest of the day, but instead he forced himself to go to lunch. He sat down next to Hermione and quietly gave her the message from McGonagall. She quietly nodded, and he gave a pathetic excuse to leave.
As he opened the door Malfoy sprung away from it.
Ron spoke first. “Can’t you just use a calming draught?”
“I love you too, you big sap. Now, let’s set up the chessboard, yeah?” Harry said lovingly with a hint of mischief in his eyes.
Gregor gave a sympathetic look.  “I know that it’s hard, but you do have to remember his brother was killed in the war. Give Ron a while, I think he will come around.”
Thank you for reading!
I finally got around to posting this update. I barely remember what happens, I've had this chapter written forever. (There is a tiny mention of Draco's dad beating him, so TW for that, stay safe!)
Harry hugged him tight and they just stood there for a moment. He reluctantly pulled away and said, “I better go talk to Ron. He is more observant than he seems, and he will catch us before dinner is over. I’ll meet you in the common room when I’m done?” The blonde smiled and nodded.
As he knocked, he heard a now familiar “Come in!” As he walked in McGonagall said “Just on time! I will expect you to return in two hours, back to the Gryffindor common room. It is set up so I will be notified when you return, so don’t worry about notifying me when you return. Other than that you may be on your way.” Stepping up to the fireplace, he took a deep breath and stepped in.
After they finished their exploring, it was time for dinner. As they all sat down on the long benches, Harry noticed that Ron and Hermionie were arguing but didn’t think anything of it. It isn’t unusual for any couple to argue. Most of dinner time passed pretty uneventfully, but at one point, Draco decided to try to get Neville and Theo to have a threesome with him before the talking got too loud and McGonagall came over to their table. That was enough to shut him up.
Ron then spoke up, “I’ll come. I want to be able to help you, and probably the other boys would be grateful if you didn’t scream bloody murder in the middle of the night.” He added, sending a smile at Harry, which he gratefully returned.
————————————————————
The blonde gave a sad smile. “Just a couple of the many we all got during the war. I..” He drifted off lost in thought. He bit his lip, thinking hard. Draco sat up and said, “I think we need to talk for a minute.” Harry nodded before moving off the blonde’s legs, lying down in the bed, patting on the space next to him with a soft smile. Draco smiled and crawled next to Harry.
A game of truth and dare happens, and things are revealed.
She seemed lost in thought for a moment before shaking herself out of it and saying, “Pansy, Truth or Dare?”
Gregor’s cheery voice broke him out of his thoughts about the dreary weather. “‘Ello, Harry! How are you?”
His voice was barely above a whisper, and cracking at this point. He took a deep breath and continued.
Looking mortified, Hermione said, “Oh, Harry, I’m so sorry!” Ron piped up, saying, “Yeah, we’re so sorry mate. I wish we would have waited for you, then Malfoy couldn’t have listened.” Sighing Harry said, “No, it’s ok. Nothing can be done about it now.”
✨Drama✨
The blonde looked at his boyfriend. Draco gave a self-demeaning laugh and said, “I don’t really draw in the sense I used to. I… I keep a journal, I draw my feelings. At Hogwarts, there is no place to sit and paint, and I can’t really remember the last time I touched a violin. I might be able to find some old art, but nothing recent that I’m proud of.”
“You don’t want to lose control of your magic. You know that neither of your childhoods were pretty. If I were to guess, you wonder how your relationship is going to work. Both of you have major trauma.”
She laughed and said, “You’re right. Since no one else knows what it is, I'll even say it out loud. Who do you have a crush on?”
“It's Luna. Nothing too serious, Madam Pomfrey should have her fixed up soon. She fell out of a tree she was climbing, looking for nargles. She broke her arm, but I don’t think it was too bad. Just wanted to let you know.”
“Do you remember in first year when you caught me eavesdropping outside McGonagall’s class?”
Another chapter for you! I hope you enjoy!
The gray eyes met green ones in silent communication before Harry said, “His name is Sam. We were talking, sitting in one of the halls, and he walked by and tried to hexed Draco. According to Draco, it was lousy. We were teaching him to do a better one after Draco made a deal with Sam. We would teach him stinging hexes, and if by the end of the day, he still thought he deserved it, he could send one as hard as he could at Draco.”
“Ohhh, I’m getting back at you! Let’s see... the first time that we slept together, Seamus forgot that we are wizards. I may have scared the Gryffindor out of him by vanishing our shirts...”
Draco laughed and shook his head and set up the chessboard.
As everybody reached class, Draco noticed that Pansy had decided to sit next to Luna instead of him. He was a little sad until Harry sat next to him. He was slightly on edge for all of the class, but other than that classes went pretty well, and nothing interesting happened.
As he slowly sat and as Malfoy exited, she said, “Miss Granger informed me of how the Dursley’s treat you yesterday. I wanted to know if you feel comfortable sharing all of your feeling with her and Mister Weasley, and it’s completely ok if you aren’t.” Responding, he said slowly, “I have never met someone who I am completely comfortable sharing my feelings with, especially some of my deeper feelings. Those two are the closest I have ever had to family.” With that McGonagall responded, “Well, then I believe that you need a mind healer. Even if you don’t believe that you need one, abuse can do a lot of damage that isn’t visible from the outside.” All he said in response is “Ok. As long as it doesn’t interfere with quidditch.” Sighing the professor said, “Thank you. When you see Miss Granger will you tell her that I want to see her after classes today. Other than that, you may go.”
They sat down next to each other, and Draco pulled Harry closer. They looked into each other's eyes, silver looking into his green ones. The silence wasn’t awkward or uncomfortable, but Harry broke it and said, “We said we should talk a little about how we wanna take this relationship. Let’s start now. How public do we want this to be?”
(See the end of the chapter for
After McGonagall dismissed the class, Harry walked up to her desk. “What can I do for you, Mr. Potter?”
Harry was surprised; whoever it was must be pretty good at hiding it or didn’t spend much time with them. He glanced around the room, trying to figure out who it was, and Draco noticed. “He’s not in here,” he laughed.
Harry
At that, Gregor stood up and said, “I’m glad we got to talk, it; seems like you needed it. I’ll see you and hopefully Ron and Hermione in a week?”
As he stopped speaking, silence came.
As the chatter at the table returned to its previous buzz, Neville spoke up. “I enjoyed last night a lot. Maybe we can continue to do it? We could do Friday nights, so it wouldn’t matter if we got drunk?” Everyone at the table seemed to agree with this, and everyone was looking forward to it.
Pansy laughed and said, “Sometimes I just need a break from being bossy and uptight. It’s nice to let go.” Draco just shook his head and said, “Moving on, how about you go Hermionie? You don’t participate enough in these.”
It was Monday morning, so this afternoon he would be talking to Ron and Hermione. He woke up and did his typical scrambling around to get ready, along with waking Ron up.
“Yeah. The day was going fine, but that night I had a nightmare. That part is normal; I get them all the time. This time, Ron woke me up. He said I had been screaming and woke everybody up.” Harry took a deep breath and continued. “I finally woke up and told everybody to go back to bed and that I was fine. I then went down to the common room because I know I wouldn’t be able to sleep. Ron followed and we talked for a little while.”
Harry had been facing the entrance, and he spun. Harry started making his way to the back, as fast as he could. He paused partway, spotting something. He grabbed it, bringing it with him. “Hey, look what I found!” The brunette held up a mostly intact violin. Draco chuckled. “I don’t think that thing is gonna work. And I haven’t played in years.” Harry rolled his eyes and finished making his way to his boyfriend.
Draco smiled, but before he could talk, someone banged on the door. Harry rolled his eyes before taking a deep breath, taking a step away from the door, and yelling, “Come in!”
She stood up saying, “Ron, give him a hug. I’m going to go talk to her.” She turned and rushed up to the castle. As she ran up the stairs to the professors office the thought about what to say. She never spoke without thinking it through.
He slid down the wall, struggling to breathe. He was shaking, and couldn’t stand. He placed his head in between his knees and did his best to breathe. He sat there for several minutes before a person, who he believed to be Hermoine, came out of the classroom and kneeled in front of him.
Hope you enjoyed!
Knocked out of his thoughts, Malfoy tripped him and sneered, “Looks like someone is distracted. Fancy telling us what you’re thinking about?” “No.” He said, “You wouldn’t find it interesting anyway.”
It was Sunday. Later today, he had his first meeting with his mind healer. He was nervous if he was being honest with himself. He had just woken up, and it looked like Ron was still asleep. Getting dressed he then woke up his best friend and they headed down to the common room, where they met Hermione and went down to breakfast.
In a shaky voice Malfoy said, “Whatever I did my father would find the wrong in it, he beat me every day.” All he said in response was “Even.”
Sam watched in wonder and Harry said, “Come on, let’s see what he conjured up.” Harry led the way followed by Sam then Draco. The older boys glanced at each other, speaking silently before Harry threw up a quick wandless silencing charm.
Harry quickly looked at his boyfriend, saying, “Oh love, you deserve us just as much as I deserve you. You never killed anyone. You saved me that time in the manor, and your mother saved me in the battle of Hogwarts.”
“The first thing I found that made me happy was music. Classical music. I started playing the violin when I was six because my mother thought it would be good for me. I quit when I was thirteen, my father decided that it wasn’t proper for the Malfoy heir to play. I was in my second year when I started drawing. Since then, the only time I didn’t draw was when You Know Who was in the manor. I threw out all of my sketchbooks but the ones I convinced mother to hide in the vault. I also started painting when I was in our sixth year, so I was around 16. There were a few paintings that I sold, a couple that stayed on the walls of the manor.” Draco paused, hesitating.
“Will you two come with me to my next meeting with Gregor?” Harry finally blurted out. Wanting this to be over and done with. Both Ron and Hermione looked at him in surprise.
Draco’s eyes widened in surprise. “Since when are you a bottom?! There is no way! I’ve known you for longer than I can remember, and I always thought you would be a top!”
Draco brought his gray eyes to meet the emerald ones before saying, “I don’t mind. I want everyone to know that you’re off the market. But… we should talk about this more later.”  The blonde smiled and went back to eating, chatting with his friends and Harry knows, that nothing could go wrong with Draco by his side.
As they moved on, sharing facts about others, it got a lot more interesting. They had decided that they would go in the same order and give a fact about the person whose turns it was.
Well, I hope you enjoyed! I hope I can keep getting updates up more often, but thanks for reading, and hope you enjoyed!
Coming back to the present, he started catching up with those around him. Ron and Hermione were still together, and Dean and Seamus had become a couple during the war. Apparently, Neville was with Theodore Nott? Who knew either of them was bent? Other than that, most things were about the same. The school was trying to promote inter house unity, so he talked to some Slytherins to help with that.
Harry said quietly, breaking the silence, “I love you. Don’t forget it, and that’s not going to change.” Draco smiled sadly and nodded.
Harry spoke next, about Ron. “Ron has always been smarter than you would think. He said, don’t follow the spiders, and we followed the spiders. We almost died that night.” Everyone either looked surprised or laughed.
Harry said, “My nightmares often cause panic attacks. It would be nice, Ron, if you could try to get me out of the room or the other boys out of the room. I really don’t want them to see me like that.”
He got dressed and trudged over to wake Ron up, assuming that Hermione hadn’t gotten as drunk and had already started eating breakfast. He knocked on the door and heard a come in, but not from Ron. He walked in and saw that Ron and Hermionie were standing across the room from each other.
“Ok, I guess you are right. Draco, we should try to not be as obvious.”
Harry looked at the blonde with puppy-dog eyes. “Please tell me?” Draco rolled his eyes. “Those beautiful emerald eyes of yours are tempting, but I’m not going to tell you.” It was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. “If he gave me permission, I would, but that's his business.”
Just then, they heard footsteps coming, neither speaking so they could hear. Hermione burst in, and quickly said, “Oh, we have been looking all over for you two. Thank Merlin I found you!”
As they pulled away from each other, he took a deep breath before saying, “Will you go out with me, Draco?” His heart warmed at the smile that spread across Draco’s face when he responded with a quiet yes.
He raced out of the classroom.
Ron was the next to go. “Never have I ever kissed a guy.” Everyone took a shot except for Luna.
After they had calmed down, Hermione asked, “Did that answer your question Harry?” “Mostly, but I do want to know about what kind of privacy policies they have.” Hermione was quick to respond, saying, “For that I can easily find a book, and you should bring it up first thing Sunday.”
As his free period came to an end, he went down to the common room where he met the rest of the Eighth years on their way to DADA. The class passed uneventfully, and soon people were heading to lunch. As lunch started, it started raining outside.
The Hufflepuff meekly said, “I’m sorry.” Hie cast his eyes on the ground with tears welling in them. Harry breathed in deeply and said, “I understand that you think that Draco is a murderer, but you need to get to know people before you go hexing them. Would you have hexed him if he was anybody else?”
“Ok... Why did it always seem like you and Parkinson were a thing, though claim you weren’t?”
The two were silent, looking through the mess left over from the war. Draco was still picking his way through to the back. The only part of the room that wasn’t burned was the very back corners. Draco let out a shaky breath. Maybe it was still there. He paused, looking towards the left corner.
Harry took a deep breath and just blurted it out. “I’m bi. It means I like both boys and girls.”
All he had to do was keep Harry away from the snitch, and catch it if he could. He chanced a glance towards Harry and saw that he was quickly being overtaken, and was falling behind again. He pushed forward with all he had, but it wasn't quite enough. As they reached the spot where they had seen the flash of gold, they spun, neither spotting the golded winged sphere that they were seeking.
They moved on, deciding that they had embarrassed Draco enough for the night. Draco decided to get Pansy back and shared something about her. “Pansy has never learned to put up a silencing charm. If you hear something late at night, it’s probably her.” Pansy didn’t look at all fazed.
“I- Thank you.There isn’t really a reason for you to trust me, but you do. I don’t deserve that. Or Harry for that matter.”
I’m sorry these keep taking so long to post. My new goal is to post once a week, and mire often when I can.
Harry responded, “Going towards the middle of the castle, being outside, or in open spaces. The problem isn’t the storm itself, but the fear of walls coming in on me.”
Harry laughed and said, “Just wait, you’ll see.” He dragged Draco through the portrait, and towards his room, sitting on his bed.
Hermionie sighed and said, “As well as I could be, I suppose.” She glanced at Draco, giving him a skeptical look. The blonde cast his eyes down. Hermionie sighed again and said, “Draco, I think I can trust you. I don’t want to hold grudges from before the war, and I’m doing my best to forget old quarrels.” The blonde looked up, his cheeks tinged pink.
Smiling, Harry said, “Yeah. I’ll talk to McGonagall and make sure it’s ok, but I don’t see why it wouldn’t. Bye!”
So. Draco had a crush on him. His mind caught back up, and he locked eyes with Draco. He noticed that Draco wasn’t saying anything and was just staring and Harry gestured for Draco to follow him and walked out of the room. He headed to his room and waited for Draco to enter.
This chapter includes sexual content. If that’s not what you came for, skip the first 11 paragraphs. (I know that it is most of the chapter, but some important stuff happens after) Thank you to Liiizzaabeth_Rose for betaing.
After they got down, the room that had become silent when they had started yelling immediately burst out laughing and talking. The rest of breakfast passed by unremarkably.
Harry
Wait. Draco had a crush on… him? He froze, his mind trying to catch up.
Ron dropped his head onto the table, and Harry could see that Ron’s shoulders kept on shuddering with soft, barely suppressed sobs, leaving his distraught mate’s lips. A few beats passed before Ron spoke again, his voice quiet and raspy, face still hidden as he tried to hide how much this affected him. “I broke up with her. I… I don’t think it would’ve worked out. I need a simpler relationship, and she needs more than I can give her.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry just nodded, wanting to get the rest of the story out. “My cousin was always the star kid. He was a spoiled brat, almost like you used to be. Even if he got a horrible grade, and I got perfect grades, I would get punished. There was no winning for me. He also didn’t treat me very well. He always bullied me, and my aunt and uncle did nothing about it.”
Hermione sighed and glared at them, “You two shouldn’t have gotten drunk on a school night. You deserve to be hungover.”
Well. Thank you to my beta, Liiizzaabeth_Rose. Sorry I didn’t update in a while, I’ve had a kinda crazy life right now.
“I should've known. Thanks for helping, you didn’t need to. Both Ron and Hermionie know how to help.”
As his mind drifted off, he didn’t notice someone approaching. He was brought out of his thoughts by Ron sitting down next to him. “Wanna talk about it?” Sighing he responded, “Not really. I think I’m going to ask Gregor about it. Usually when I have that nightmare I wake up feeling like I can’t breathe, and like the world is closing in on me. You guys should be glad it was only that bad.”
Harry attempted to get Draco to talk to him, he apparated to the Manor gates but the wards flung him away violently. As he left, he spotted Draco watching him dispassionately from a window. He received a wedding invitation the next day, the words, “it is done” in Draco’s elegant script.
He pushed Draco softly onto his back, admiring his slim, pale form nestling against the red sheets. Taking a second to admire his round, red little nipples, Harry leant down and found them with his mouth. They tasted sweet, warm and hard at the end of his tongue, as he teased and flicked them. Harry loved these breasts and couldn’t believe that he’d get to give them this kind of attention every day, forever. He cupped their curve in his hand, squeezing them slightly and enjoying their softness.
It was weird, and different, but not bad. Now that he was prepared, it was almost good.
Then all there was was pain, and pushing, and pushing so hard she thought she was going to break, her whole body sweating, and fingers smashing a hand -
In the early months of his pregnancy, Draco would feel jealous of Ginny. Knowing his alpha had had sex with her, had a baby with her, was eating him from the inside. It was hard not to bark at her, but then when he saw her with her mate, his heart calmed down. They were two separate families, but Lyra made them one anyways. And Draco loved her as if she was his own.
Our favorite couple finally actually talk to each other.
I hope you enjoyed! I’m working on the next chapter, and I’m pretty exited about it! Thanks for reading!
Thanks to my beta, Liiizzaabeth_Rose. I hope you enjoyed, and thanks for reading!
Ok, two things:
So... I was planning on skipping ahead to eight year after five but then this got pushed back a chapter, and I really liked writing about Gregor. So, let me know whether you think I should skip ahead or add a couple chapters in between, maybe one for each year(other than seventh, I don’t really want to write about the war, though I might add some flashbacks later on). This was a long one so I hope you enjoyed. Oh, and I just wanted to say that the name Gregor Collins is completely random, I used a random name generator until I found a name I didn’t hate.
————————————————————
He was brought back to the present when Draco started an impression of Quirrel. “I t-t-teach D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts.” while fidgeting with his hand, doing a pretty good impression of their first DADA professor.
Sitting down next to her on the couch, he said quietly, “How much do you know about mind healers? I wanna know what to expect.” Closing her book slowly, she turned to face him. “I don’t know a lot about them. I’m guessing Ron knows more, or I can try to find something in the library.”
Pansy was the first one to speak. “Hmm… there was that one time in sixth year that we caught you leaving Theo’s room mostly naked. You were carrying your ripped-up clothes.”
Their lips moved together, Harry’s hands around the blonde's waist with Draco’s hand beside the brunette's head, and Harry’s hands wrapped around Draco’s neck. Harry then slowly started to relax. Draco moved his kisses down to Harry’s neck, who held back a moan. He waved his hand, with barely enough focus to get the silencing charm up.
The blonde smiled and easily said, “Sure.”
As the trio walked to the common room, Harry asked, “Are either of you as hungover as me?”
They stood up, Harry on shaky knees, Draco said, “Why don’t you go back to the table and look through the instructions, and I will grab the rest of the ingredients.”
“The first time I was beaten, I was eight. I had dirtied a pair of trousers, the first time I wore them. I don’t even really remember how I got them so dirty, but I was probably in the garden, and got them wet, or tore them. I was sent to my room, and my mother risked a lot to come and make sure I was alright. After that, I started putting on a figurative mask every morning. I would only show my real emotions when I was alone in my room.”
He smiled. He had been doing a lot better since the war ended, and he had been able to go back to meeting with Gregor. He heard McGonagall start her speech, as she was the new headmaster, but he knew he didn’t have to listen. If there was something important, Hermione would let him know.
“Ron, please give him a chance. I think the last thing he needs is more people doubting him, or someone going at him.”
After classes were over, the group decided to walk around the castle, to see what’s different, and to see how many places in the castle were still a mystery to them. They started in the dungeons. The Slytherins, of course, knew it all, and everyone else was pretty lost.
Harry has a rough day.
The blonde and the brunette headed to the common room together. Harry was the first to speak after they sat down on the sofa by the fireplace. “I hope everything between them turns out alright.”
Thanks for reading! I would love constructive criticism! I hope you stick around! This was a little shorter than I thought, but hopefully most chapters will be longer!
He felt kind of bad for adding, “and I don’t want people to start throwing curses as you because you’re gay either,” but it was true, and a realistic possibility.
Ron said, “Well, that's one way to solve the problem.” Harry shrugged and Draco said, “Harry might have been yelling and scaring him, and it was the first thing that popped into my mind. When I’m in a tight situation, whatever pops into my head first happens.”
“They have always treated me poorly, for as long as I can remember. I have always hated myself, for not being good enough for them. Logically I know I couldn’t have done better, that it was all on them. But I just can’t seem to get that thru my head. Since too young of an age, maybe five, I have learned to put on a mask every morning. I have been crying myself to sleep for as long as I can remember. They always did the bare minimum to keep me alive. I couldn’t believe it when Hagrid broke down that door and told me I was special. I was ecstatic, realizing that I didn’t have to stay with them.”
As he walked in to the great hall, he saw a separate table for the eighth year students. He sat down with all the other people who had returned. He saw Ron and Hermione, of course, along with Dean, Seamus, Neville, Luna, Malfoy, Parkinson, Zabini, Nott, Ernie, Abbot, Terry Boot, Justin Finch-Fletchley, and the Patil twins.
Draco blushed a bright pink which made him, in Harry’s mind, pretty adorable, and mumbled,  “I knew it. If everybody else must know, it’s Harry.”
He caught a glimpse of gold, near the bottom of the middle Gryffindor goalpost. As soon as he saw it, he was off. Chancing a quick glance to the man he was racing, he realized they would most likely reach the snitch at the same time. That glance he had taken was not good. He had taken his eyes off of the snitch, and when he looked back, it was gone.
The two layed next to each other, Harry snuggling up against Draco’s side. Draco was the first to speak. “I have a lot of scars. The dark mark… is something else too. I’m guessing you have just as many.” Harry nodded, waiting for the blonde to finish. “I… I think we should show each other all our scars before we do anything more, so there are no surprises.” Harry nodded and sat up and finished shrugging the shirt off his shoulders.
As food magically appeared on the table, he said a silent thank you, to the people in his life and for all the people who died. He was especially thankful that he never had to go back to the Dursley’s. Even though he thought they had a bit of a change of heart when they had to run from dark wizards, he was pretty sure he would never be ok sleeping in their house again.
Harry whispered so only his boyfriend could hear, “Why don’t we go to your room?” The blonde gave a small nod before pushing Harry off his lap.
Harry had caught the snitch. Harry had won the game for his team. They both slowly floated down to the ground. The rest of the players followed, the Gryffindors surrounding Harry and congratulating him. The Slytherins hung back, still not invited into the group.
“Woah, where on earth did you come from, and what did you do with Harry? I’ve never seen you get up early, or in such a good mood!” He thought, “Yeah, I guess that yesterday really helped. At the time it felt like someone just took a huge weight off my chest, and I guess I kinda forgot all my problems. I hope this feeling lasts.”
Harry has the next fact about Neville. “One time, in first year actually, Hermione, Ron, and I were sneaking out of the common room, and Neville stood up to us and told us not to. Hermione jinxed him. Full body-bind.”
“I’ll take a dare,” Luna said dreamily.
“Of course.”
The blonde nodded. “That’s… That's what I meant by if I could find it. I don’t even know if it’s still whole.”
Classes passed by pretty quickly and were pretty boring. By the end of the day, he was so ready to get having to talk to Ron and Hermione over and done with.
(See the end of the chapter for
When she reached the steps she saw the boys on their way back to the castle. She stood there, waiting for them. Harry still had silent tears running down his face.
Pansy shook her head, stood up, and walked across the circle. She stood in front of Hermionie and whispered, “No, not curse you. Kiss you,” before leaning in and giving her a quick peck on the lips. She stood back up, and after looking at Hermione for a moment, cheeks blazing red,  turned, and walked back to where she had been sitting before.
“Hey, it’s my job, and I love getting to help people. I propose that for the rest of today, we just have some fun and get to know each other. How does that sound?” Feeling relived that he didn’t have to talk any more today, he quickly nodded, “That sounds great.”
“Why are you two boys up!” a voice came from behind them. As they both turned and groaned, Hermione sat down next to them on the sofa. Glancing at each other, they both started talking at once. “Harry couldn’t sleep-“ “I had a nightmare-“ Rolling her eyes Hermione said, “Harry, you first, it sounds like you started this.”
Slowly, as Harry figured out who he was to the wizarding world, he found out why he kept hearing his name in the halls. His first month went smoothly, or at least as smoothly as is seemed possible for “The Chosen One.”
Everyone stayed for a while longer and after an hour or so, Sam left. After that, all the teens hung out for a little longer before everybody but Draco and Harry left. The two sat down on the floor in silence for a couple of minutes before the room decided that they needed a couch to sit on. It appeared across the room from them. Harry grabbed the blonde’s hand and dragged him up and over to the couch. The two sat down, Draco sitting on Harry’s lap.
“I… I’m not sure. Turns out, during a war, you don’t have a lot of time to experiment.” Harry said with a cheeky smile.
————————————————————
Just as the bell rung freeing them, McGonagall called, “Mister Potter and Mister Malfoy, I would like to speak with you.” As the rest of the class left, Hermione said quickly, “I would wait outside for you, but Ron is surely going to run off to lunch, I’ll stay with him, he still gets lost.” Smiling, she rolled her eyes and left, leaving him alone.
Everybody finished dinner, and most of them headed to the Room of Requirement. Sam was already there and looked a little intimidated by the number of people present. “Why did you bring all your friends to watch me fail?”
-EIGHTH YEAR-
Letting out a breath he didn’t know he had been holding, he said sincerely, “Thank you. I’m going to go to bed now, Goodnight.”
Sam rolled his eyes before raising his wand and firing at the dummy at the other side of the room. He hit it square on, and Hermionie looked impressed. “Well, that looked pretty strong, I doubt you will need much help.” Sam smiled shyly and lowered his wand. “I guess Harry and Draco did pretty well then.”
Looking confused Ron asked, “What’s Friday?” Harry quietly responded, “My first appointment with a mind healer. And by the way, how did you know it was Sunday and to tell me to go see McGonagall Hermione?” It may have been one of the things we discussed the other day after classes.”
Draco redraped himself over Harry and claimed the brunette’s lips once more. Harry’s hand snaked up towards the blonde’s hair, messing it up from its perfectly styled look and tugging at it gently. The man above him moaned, loving the gentle tug at his scalp. The blonde ground his hips down, seeking friction against his rapidly hardening cock. Both moaned as their clothed dicks pressed against each other.
As he looked around again, he noticed Harry staring at a spot near one of the stands. As he looked he saw a flash of gold before Harry was off. He raced off after him, a couple of meters behind. He gained a couple of feet and got far enough forward to bump into him. Harry took a second to shift back, and Draco was in the lead.
Pansy smirked, looking at Draco “Draco, truth or dare.”
He heard the blonde sigh before his boyfriend said, “I don’t know. In the past, I’ve always kept it pretty private, considering you-know-who and my father. I’m willing to do whatever you want, I guess.”
He smiled and shook his head, trying to shake off the thoughts. He sat down across from his boyfriend and gently took Harry’s hand and kissing it gently.
He chuckled and said, “Well, I don’t really want to do this, but I have a lot of homework I need to get done. Do you wanna help?”
Draco froze for a moment before shaking it off and saying, “How about this? You can spend the rest of the day with us, we can teach you how to cast a proper stinging hex, and if by the time you head off to bed you still think I deserve that hex, you can totally send it my way as hard as you can. Sounds good?”
Draco laughed sarcastically and said, “You don’t even know. I’ve already had more curses thrown than you could believe. Luckily I’m pretty good at shield charms and they won’t do it in front of other people.”
Thinking about this, his first question was, “Is a mind healer like a muggle counselor?” Answering, Hermione said “Yes.” Ron, (being Ron) said, “What’s a counselor?” Rolling their eyes, the two raised with muggles shared a look. Explaining, Hermione said, “They are like a mind healer, but from the Muggle world.”
————————————————————
Draco conjured a pair of glasses and filled them before handing them to Ron and Harry, saying, “Well Hermione, next time anybody gets drunk, either I’m going to get drunk with them or study with you. Anyway, tomorrow night, I’m drinking. I won’t drink on a school night, but on a weekend, there is no way that I’m the only one not drinking.”
An uncomfortable silence hung over them until Draco looked into Harry’s eyes and stated, “I’m sorry. Please don’t let this get in the way-” Harry didn’t let him finished and crashed his lips against the blonde’s.
Draco laughed in response, “I never thought I would be in love with my childhood crush.”
I’m going to post the next one right away, because I’m so sorry for the huge cliffhanger!
As Harry looked back up, he saw the pity and sorrow on his year mates' faces. He saw the surprise on Hermione and Ron’s faces, which turned into a kind smile, knowing how hard it was for him to open up.
Hermionie slowly opened the door and squealed. “Oh, I knew it! I’m so happy for you Harry!”
(See the end of the chapter for
I think they talk
“Thanks, mate, I hope that me and ‘moinie will work it out.  Anyway, what did you want to tell me?”
Harry smiled gently and said, “I still have more to tell if you want to listen.” The blonde shook his head in disbelief. “There’s more?” Harry just gave a small nod.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, if you are going to teach that hex, love, you'll need your wand out,” Draco laughed. Harry rolled his eyes and pulled his wand out of his holster ad shot a discrete tripping jinx making Draco trip and glare at Harry who smirked and shrugged his shoulders innocently.
Harry smiled and responded, “I’ll tell him later, but it would be great if you could tell him that I want to talk to him later, but that I would like a minute alone right now. And… thank you for accepting me.”
Harry sat down on his bed. “What happened?” He asked.
Draco was leading Harry through the hallways, and the brunette soon realized where they were heading. Draco let go of his boyfriend’s hand, pacing in front of the stretch of wall. When the door appeared, Draco opened it. It was the Room of Requirement. The room of lost things. The come and go room.
Draco gave an exasperated look, “Oh no. You have way too much information about me either way. Umm… Truth, I guess. I’m pretty sure I know what you are going to say, and this will be less harmful.”
He walked over to her, and in a hushed whisper said, “Harry has been crying himself to sleep since the beginning of the year. I brought it up just now and he said to grab you and meet down by the lake. I think he has something to tell us.”
As the group sat down at their table, he started chatting with his friends and the others that he wanted to get to know better. Food magically appeared on the table as always, and they all dug in. As they all talked, he found out some interesting details about his fellow year-mates.
DRACO’S POV
Harry smiled, returning the grip on his hand. The two walked out of the ROR and headed to the common room. They walked past the portrait, and Harry settled on one of the couches while Draco grabbed them tea in the kitchens. When he came back, Draco asked, “Do you want to play a game of chess?” Harry smiled and nodded, though he knew it was unlikely that he would win.
Gregor nodded thoughtfully and asked, “Your stance on this?”
Draco smiled but waited a moment before speaking. “I never said I was a good artist. Anyway, where was I?”
————————————————————
He made it to lunch and sat down next to Hermionie, which meant next to Draco too. He piled his plate full and started stuffing his face. He slowed down to talk to his friends, and before he knew it lunch was over.
Harry thought about how nice yesterday had been. He had been able to smile and laugh for what seemed like the first time in forever. It was kinda nice to not argue with the Slytherins just because they were the opposite house.
He was woken abruptly, in a cold sweat. Both Ron and Hermione were looking worriedly down at him. Groaning he sat up. Hermione immediately went off.
Gregor nodded, “Those are called panic attacks. I figured you might have them, and some claustrophobia.”
The boy paused for a second before saying, “I’m Sam. And first, Harry Potter is gay? Second, I hexed his boyfriend? Third, what is the Come and Go Room?”
Hours went by and Draco and Harry were still in the room talking about nothing and staying in each other’s company and admiring the wonderful view. Harry pressed a kiss to the top of Draco’s head before saying, “Are you ready to keep telling me about how amazing of an artist you are?”
After everyone was sitting Hermione said, “We are all going to play a game.” “What game?” Asked the twins. “I don’t know yet.” Hermione said, “We are going to vote. What are our nominations?” Truth or dare, seven minutes in heaven and never have I ever were the top three nominations. After voting they decided on never have I ever, and the person who did the least amount of things had to scream who their crush was tomorrow morning in the great hall.
After sitting in silence for a good twenty minutes, Hermione finally broke the silence. “Harry, cheer up. It will get better. Right now, you don’t even have to think about them.” Harry responded, “I do think about them every day. Malfoy wouldn’t bother be at all if it weren’t for the fact of him reminding me of Dudley. Sighing, Hermione stood up with a “I’ll be right back.” As soon as she left Ron spoke up. “She’s right mate. Blimey, she’s always right. Cheer up!”
Draco smirked, and Hermionie beamed. The rest of the lesson droned on, and since it was a double period, the class was over and they were done for the day.
Pansy sighed and sat down on the bed next to him. “He hasn’t said whether he is straight or not.” They both sat in silence for a couple of minutes before Pansy said, “Move on. Do something other than wallow in your self-pity.” She left, and he was alone, thinking about his crush.
Hermione talks to professor McGonagall and some cheering up of the Harry.
Draco sighed. “Just because he broke up with the Weaselette, doesn't mean he’s gay,” he said with an eye roll. Pansy just smiled. They reached the Eighth year table and everyone sat down and as usual, the food magically appeared and they dug in.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam giggled and pulled his wand from his bag, which he had sat on the floor. “You know you should always keep your wand on you. You never know when one of your enemies is going to throw a hex at you, and you wanna be able to grab it easily, best if you get a holster like me and have your wand on your body at all times,”
Harry sat down in the chair he always had, trying to sort out the mess running through his head as he did at the beginning of every session. There were a lot of things on his mind, Ron and Hermionie’s breakup, Draco’s doubts in himself, his childhood, and his speculations about Draco’s childhood.
It was Tuesday, and Draco and Harry were sitting together at lunch. The two had decided yesterday that they would talk this afternoon since they had a free period at the end of the day, so they would have more time.
Harry was furious. They had no right, the war was over, and Draco had changed, he was a completely different person. All he said though, was a quiet, “Who?”
“Well Ron woke me up around half an hour ago from a nightmare. I had been screaming apparently.” Ron butted in, “He was screaming for like five minutes before I managed to wake him up.” Harry continued, “I knew I wasn’t going to be able to sleep so I came down, after I told everybody else to go to sleep. Ron followed me down here and asked me about it. That’s it.”
The truth of the matter was that after they had separated, Draco’s mind had been working overdrive now that he was back to his senses. What was he doing? This was Harry Potter. He can’t kiss Harry Potter. What would people say? He wasn’t so much concerned about what people would say to him but what would happen to Harry. He had a job that required catching dark wizards and he was kissing an ex death eater. What if they got together properly and people found out? His job would be in jeopardy and not to mention what his friends would say. It was a well renowned fact that the weasel still loathed him. No one as far as he knew even knows that Harry likes men. It seems like Harry has only just found that out. He couldn’t do this. For Harry’s sake.
Harry took his wand in his other hand and shook Draco’s still outstretched one. Malfoy’s eyes pierced his as they stood there, the sound of the battle around them lowered to the sounds of crying and names being shouted. The firing of curses and hexes silent as Harry guessed the remaining two or so Death Eaters had either fled or been apprehended.
Harry went and sat down next to Hermionie, Draco, right behind him. Draco set his hand on Harry’s leg and said quietly, “Why don’t we postpone any more talking about serious things until tomorrow, and just relax. It’s been a really long day.” Harry gave a small nod, not enough to be obvious to the others.
Draco made his way over to the metal grated lifts and entered, pressing the button for level 2.
“We need to talk. Can I come in…please?” Harry said the last word with a little more desperation than he had wanted to betray with his voice.
“Well don’t worry about that, Potter. I can still put you in your place if needed. You may be everyone else’s great saviour but to me you’re still a specky git.” Draco said with his infamous smirk ever so slightly visible on his thin pink lips.
Draco felt his heart skip a beat at the intimate gesture, hardly believing this was his life. The feel of Harry’s stubble against his neck was not doing anything for his very prominent hard on right now either. Harry’s equally noticeable interest hard against his thigh.
“Oh for goodness sake, Malfoy just let me help you!” And with that, Harry put his arm underneath Draco, supporting his weight. It was an odd feeling being this close to Malfoy. He could feel the heat of his breath on his neck whilst he clambered up from the ground and the feel of him pressed to his side was one that Harry missed when Malfoy let go of him to lean against the wall instead. Green eyes met grey and a silence fell between them for a few moments in which Draco slowed his breathing and Harry tried to read what he was thinking to no avail.
“Nothing…I just need some time to think. I’m sorry.” And with that Draco left the room, leaving Harry standing alone and wondering what on earth he had done wrong in those last few minutes.
“Pansy just piss off! I don’t want to talk about it.” Draco huffed.
Hermione had grabbed Ron and Harry at the end of the battle of Hogwarts and disapparated them to the burrow initially. Only long enough to reconvene with the others once they arrived and decide a course of action. They’d have to go underground. That much was obvious. A safe house would be needed, and they would need to take stock and rebuild the Order. Keep the fight alive and plan how to once and for all defeat Voldemort.
Harry froze. “You don’t what?”
“Tellll meeeeee.” Pansy said, sticking her bottom lip out. “If you don’t I’ll just have to go and ask, Potter myself.”
“But he hates me! He’s never shown anything but contempt for me and I don’t blame him. I’ve made some pretty shit mistakes in my life so far.” Draco replied, feeling the shame and guilt building up inside of him again.
“But nothing.”
They both froze, Harry rooted to the spot as the realisation of what he had just said slowly hit him. He didn’t have much time to reflect, however, as Draco spun around and instantly closed the space between them, pushing Harry against the wall behind them and meeting Harry’s lips with his own, kissing him furiously with need and want and heat. Harry couldn’t help the moan that escaped his throat, being swallowed by Draco’s mouth who practically growled in response. Harry parted his lips to allow Draco’s tongue entrance, both of their tongues battling for dominance until Draco bit down on Harry’s lower lip, eliciting another whimper from Harry. Draco moved his hands down to Harry’s waist whilst Harry tangled his fingers into Draco’s blonde hair, gripping it tightly and pulling him impossibly closer. His other hand on the small of his back. Harry swiped his tongue along Draco’s lip, making him involuntarily moan back in response. This was nothing like either of them had felt before. It was passion and lust that practically blinded them and made them see stars. The only thing either of them knew or wanted was the other. Draco pressed his body even closer against Harry’s, stepping In between Harry’s parted legs and rocking his hips, so that their increasingly hardening erections could rub together through the fabric of their trousers. That made Harry’s knees weak and he moaned even louder into Draco’s mouth, still not breaking the kiss. He was overcome with lust and found himself wanting – needing, more. However, Draco then suddenly broke the kiss and pulled back, not looking at Harry. His face considerably more pink than it had ever been before, matching the flush on Harry’s cheeks. He stepped back, meeting Harry’s eyes that were a mixture of longing and confusion. Draco’s eyes depicting his conflicting emotions right now. They were a combination of the same longing that Harry’s were clouded over with but also of grief and despair.
————————————————————
Hermione
There. It was an easel, facing away from him. “Harry! I- I think I found it.”
The redhead sighed and looked at Harry, his eyes slightly red and puffy. The redhead opened and closed his mouth like a fish out of water before saying, “I don’t know. I think me and Hermionie are breaking up, but I’m not sure. When you walked in on us arguing this morning, she had come in to tell me that maybe we should take a break.” Harry immediately pulled him into a hug and whispered that everything will be ok.
Draco rolled his eyes fondly before saying, “Why not? Since we’re in your room already.”
Draco slowly pulled Harry into a sitting position and unbuttoned the brunette’s robe, letting it fall off Harry’s shoulders and tossing it in a corner. Draco then guided Harry back down to lay on the bed, his mouth left the brunette's neck for a moment while pulling off his own robes.
“Have a seat,” McGonagall said, gesturing to the empty seat across from her desk. “I have a feeling this is going to take awhile.”
Dean responded, “Well, actually I’m bi, but yeah. Luna, truth, or dare?”
Well, I hope you guys enjoy. This is the longest one yet and I’m exited to post it.
Theodore Nott laughed and said, “Did you know that in fifth year, Blaise and Draco hooked up. Now reminder, Blaise is straight.” As everyone looked at the two, Draco smirked, and Blaise had a furious blush.
He paused again, glancing up at his boyfriend, trying to figure out just how much he should say. He tried to read the blonde’s expression, but all he saw was a carefully schooled expression, blank and not giving anything away.
Draco glanced over at his boyfriend before responding, “I think they will still be friends, they have too much history, and you Gryffindor lot are very sentimental people; I doubt they’ll throw away 8 years of friendship over a failed relationship. But I don’t think they will get back together. One, I think they are both right, Hermionie wants something more in the bedroom, and Ron isn’t the right one to give it to her. Two, I know that someone else in our year that fancies her, and I think he is going to make his very move soon once he caught wind that Hermonie is now available.”
Just then, Fred and George stood up on the other end of the table and yelled, Fred first. “Angelina Johnson, I like you! Do you wanna go out with me?” Following quick in succession, George yelled, “Katie Bell, I like you! Do you wanna go out with me?” Jumping down from the table, they headed over to their respective girls, presumably to talk to them.
Harry nodded but didn’t say anything else. Draco looked down at his hands, which he had folded together in his lap, and continued.
Draco sighed and realized that they were avoiding it. His mind was racing with thoughts, but all that would come out of his mouth was, “Ok.” If Harry was brave enough to confront his demons, surely he can too.
Draco counters with, “Did you know that Theo here once ran all around the lake in just his pants?” Theo looked mortified, and he looked even more embarrassed when Blaise added, “Theo also, in fourth year, forgot that we had dorms, and people share dorms. A couple of times, several of us were woken up to him wanking. And he can’t keep a silencing charm up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
They all headed back to their common room, and someone broke out the fire whiskey. As they all celebrated the Gryffindors victory, Draco found himself gravitating towards Harry, and silently scolded himself. Harry didn’t want to be with him, Harry wasn’t even gay.
Ron went next. “I owned a rat as a pet. Turned out it was Peter Pettigrew. He was an Animagus.”
The game continued for a little while longer, but nothing exciting or interesting happened. As 9:30 rolled around Hermione spoke up. “We do have classes starting tomorrow. We should all head to bed; we shouldn’t be late for our first day of class.”
Harry got his letter. After the Dursley’s shenanigans trying to keep it away from him, he finally figured out why he always felt he was different.
Ron broke the silence saying, “I’m so sorry mate. I would have never thought that the savior of the wizarding world grew up in a abusive household.” Hermione, who had been silent up until then almost whispered, “so that’s why when we met you, you were so skinny. And also why you always eat like you have never seen food, and like you will never see it again, they didn’t feed you.” He just nodded, saying “I almost always am in a bad mood. That first day of school was the first day In as long as I can remember that I felt truly happy. I have spent so many days waking up and putting on a mask, that I don’t even think about it anymore.”
