Draco thought about pulling his hand away and giving Harry the silent treatment on the implication that he should
“Shall we move under the trees?” Malfoy asks.
Harry caught the next ring in 4 tries. This obstacle was a rope climb up to a slide, and Draco had been looking forward to it, thinking it suited his light frame and aerial arts experience (When Harry had joined a climbing gym, Draco had tagged along. He didn’t much like the bouldering part, but the gym had a room for silks, lyra, and trapeze, and Draco had gotten invested, taking multiple lessons a week) but when he finally began to pull himself up, he took no joy in it. He was frustrated with himself nearly to tears.
Shit, have I exhausted all other points of discussion? Are we back to the nitty-gritty? Alright. The potion I took was a modified Draught of Peace, with the hellebore switched with powdered root of asphodel and sopophorous bean to mimic a Draught of Living Death. I also added a wit-sharpening potion to counteract the drowsiness and an experimental muffling potion that put a permanent glamour over my visible magical signature.
“We both had to grow up fast.”
Hermione, Ron, and Ron’s extended family helped me move into a cottage in Devon. They have helped care for me over the past 2 years, and I could not be more grateful. However, a major reason I have finally decided to seek professional help is so that I will no longer have to leech from my family in order to survive. One day, I hope to give back some of what they have given me, but today, I can only bring worry and heartbreak.
“Iz, I got it. Fuck, we fucking got it,” he shouted, and she screamed in delight, urging him to come down and show her. He slid from the tree, landing heavily in a large leafy bush. Dignity be damned, he pushed carelessly through to the creek, letting twigs snag in his hair and mud dot his knees. He leaped down the embankment, stumbling when the stones he landed on shifted beneath his feet. Hand still clutching the Idol, he fell, barely saving his head from going under. Iz splashed him, and he laughed in delight, losing his footing twice more as he scrambled to right himself. They scurried back towards the beach, settling atop a slim fallen log in the middle of the island they had discovered on their way there.
“You sure they know what they’re doing?” he asks. A team of young men are in the process of digging a large hole at the center of Draco’s back lawn.
According to Neville, ‘
“At three, I hold the most Immunity wins of the season. I also found a Hidden Immunity Idol clue, and later the Idol itself, without instructions or prompting. I simply combined my own initiative, knowledge of the game, and ambition to put in the work that would improve my standing. It was these small instances of creativity, inventiveness, and sharp logic that, when combined, put me in the position I am now.
Draco comes by to help Harry pack the weekend before move-in. It’s been days since they have been able to spend any real time together, with Harry taking on extra projects so he can take a few days off work to settle in, and Draco has never seen the flat so empty. It is eerily sterile, all white spackled walls and polished corners. “Where are your plants?” Draco blurts.
Lithodora blankets the earth at the base of the island, deep green foliage offset by the glowing royal blues of the flowers. The colour of those blossoms-- Draco thinks it might be his favourite colour in the world.
“Childhoods,” Malfoy repeats.
Ron appeared at Harry’s shoulder. “Rose and Rhea have their hearts set on Hotel for Dogs again,” he said.
“Not really. Just wanted to let you know that Jibberlies gave the whole department a surprise three day weekend. I thought you could stay over. I think I’m going to the Botanical Gardens tomorrow, and I’ll be seeing Teddy on Sunday. I figured you’d want to come.”
“To care about what? Healing? Remorse? Malfoy, there’s no coming back from this. There’s no healing. Why do you think I’m here?”
Harry Potter
They waded along the seam where the ocean met stone, soggy shoes weighing them down but protecting their toes from razor-blade volcanic pumice. Isabelle stopped at a narrow out-jet of the island. A massive tulip tree learned over the edge, dropping petals that frosted the slightly-slabbed cliff face.
“Well, I don’t know! Can’t we shrink everything?”
“Pansy, Hermione is
Draco laughed. “Oh, no, no. You need to rest. We have all of tomorrow. Care for a mango?”
The conductor ushers him onto the train, reaching to place his hand on Harry’s back at the top of the stairs as he has done for every student since they were 11. At the last second, he thinks better of it. Harry paces the hallway at an unsteady trot, a manic twitch in his temple exposing itself each time he leans to check the occupancy of the cabins. He trips on a crease in the carpet, catching himself heavily, and a wave of adrenaline rushes through him, hot and twitchy. It sounds like an avalanche in his brain.
Day 7
Harry comes first, his knees falling to the side and quivering, tense shoulders smoothing from where they had bunched high and taut against his neck. He pants, whining with each exhale and eyes squeezed tight.
“You think
When he swallowed, he didn’t stick out his tongue or bare his teeth with little bits of legs and skin stuck in them like everyone else tended to; he simply opened his jaw wide enough for Jeff to declare the round over. Winning was not a triumph; it was merely doing what needed to be done. He was already looking forward to returning to camp and casting a very thorough tooth-cleansing spell.
“Look, Draco. I don’t know whether Jones is right or wrong, but I’m here if you need to talk to someone, whatever it may be. He’s a bigot, plain and simple, and it’s people like him that made it so I felt like I couldn’t come out until I was 46. We’ve been trying to get him out for weeks now back in the other camp, but the bastard won't budge, so if anything happens, you make sure to come to me.”
Draco scrunched his nose skeptically. “And how do you know that?”
So at Tribal Council Draco wrote down Harry’s name. “One last hurrah, Iz,” he told the camera, crossing his fingers and placing the card in the urn. He knew three of the votes inside bore her name.
Malfoy laughs, humourless and sincere. “I don’t think hating me makes you hateful. I think it makes you rational. It’s the most rational thing you’ve ever done."/p>
When Hermione and Draco stumbled home to the Granger-Weasley residence past nine, they would find Ron and Harry, fast asleep on the sofa, with Rose and Teddy snoring gently across their laps.
Draco chuckled, writing back ‘
I don’t like the idea of being distracted!”
He stood up carefully, turning and running his hands over Harry’s form to check for bruises. “No brain damage?” he asked.
Harry looked ready to speak again, but Draco cut him off. “Oh my god is that a starfruit tree?” he said, snapping back to alertness.
He bowed. “For you, my love,” he announced, eyes only on Draco as he presented a bouquet of brilliant pink and yellow flowers. Draco giggled. It was moments like this that made him fall in love all over again.
Draco was chosen to run. He might have liked to do the puzzle, but Isabelle had offered, and he wasn’t inclined to draw attention to himself. It was just as well anyway; he was quite good at running. He clocked about 30 miles a week back home.
“Love you,” Draco breathed. “So bloody hot. So beautiful. Watching you win those challenges, god. Your fucking body. How have I gone without?”
Draco gave an unamused snort. “You wish, Potter.”
did you want? Because I’ll tell you what I wanted; I wanted
Casting a light glamour to hide the still-irritated skin, he helped her to her feet, cringing as the scar sunk beneath the salty, lapping waves. He observed closely as she took a first step and then another, checking her face for pain.
Harry has done wonders with the place, spending every night from dinner until long past sun-down watering and tending with loving care. A dwarf red maple has been planted in the center of the infinity waterfall, a dappled, fluttering shade blanketing the ground. Combined with the soft shimmering ripples of the current, the surface of the water looks like a portal to another dimension.
Draco shakes his head, a sinking lurch of shame in the pit of his stomach. “Oh, of course. Harry, I never said you had to get rid of anything…”
“Because you were right. Not because he didn’t help.”
Hope to see you on Tuesday.
“Er, thanks, Hagrid…” Harry said as a smallish glass tank was pushed into his hands. Peering inside, he scrunched his nose up as he tried to work out what he was looking at.
Day 39
Draco nods. “Home, definitely. That guy over there is eying you up.”
Several of my friends have offered to write this letter for me, but I refused; I have been running from my past for far too long as is, and a proposition such as this one can only work if I am entirely transparent.
“Potter.”
Harry sighed. “Oh god. Oh fuck. Want you. Wanna ride you.”
In the remedial amount of research that I have done, I know that the core of a wizard does not in itself produce magic, but instead creates a sort of charge that induces a force on the magical field in the atmosphere around it. When a spell is performed or interacted with, the wizard shifts their core, creating what is akin to a magnetic flux and transforming magical potential energy into other types of energy in the physical world.
“Jesus Christ,” he mutters. Vaguely, Draco can feel the vibration of a coin in his chest pocket.
Draco’s back had erupted into hundreds of freckles and a blotchy tan, and Harry counted them with the pad of his finger, using an orb of light above them to see. Draco lay on his stomach. Eyes closed, he ran his knuckle over Harry’s ribs, down over his hip and against the coarse grain of his powerful thighs.
She continued. “I am proud of the game that I played, and I believe I was the example I wanted to model for my children of a calm, kind, decent human being who was able to empathize with others and do the work that needed to be done. I was a stable presence in an otherwise chaotic game, I think that takes a lot of patience and skill.”
You’ve been a reprieve from all that makes me suffer, a lick of hope and normalcy. It is ironic, perhaps, as you are my healer, and you’ve seen so much of how my story began. I now have to reconcile the person I am-- and have been, for years-- alone, and the person I am with you. Maybe it is not a bad thing.
he thinks,
“And?” Draco pushes. “We’re wizards!”
Draco tapped Harry awake. “I’m going out,” he whispered.
“I don’t know,” Jason says after a moment of deliberation. “I’m pretty sure I made splatter paintings like this as a kid.”
I also have anchored my magic in the woods and garden surrounding my house. This is equally exhausting, but perhaps slightly more productive. The forest is in constant fluctuation between die-back and growth, but during months when I am most overactive, it positively flourishes in an explosion of Hart’s Tongue, Ivy, Honeysuckle, and Dahlias. The ecosystem has an open tap on my magical core, and though it is perhaps not sustainable, I am a willing donor.
Tara followed Marissa, asking Harry so many questions that Jeff had to call time and escort her back to her seat.
I have spent the past several years confined to my house. In that time, I have done my share of sulking, of screaming, of cursing the injustices of the world. I have also, in stubborn refusal to ask for help, attempted to understand how the human magical core works, in hopes that I can fix my issues without professional interference.
She turned towards him on her side. “My dad’s muggleborn, grew up in St. Louis. It wasn’t a great time or place to be black or male or young, so he left for LA in the 70s. My mom comes from a long line of magical families in Mexico. She and her parents were the first to immigrate north, and they lost all their standing doing so. They worked hard to get where they are.
His fingers trace his hip-bones, frail and hollow and sharp like a bird’s, desert bleached. There is a scar there that he’s always had, that he doesn’t remember where he got. A muscle wraps beneath his sternum, holding him together at the heart. His ribs are rolling hills-- the skin paper-thin and teal-veined on the ridges, softer in the valleys.
“We’ll worry about it tomorrow,” Harry replies.
Draco could hardly walk for the rest of the day. He stayed in camp, offering to handle the cooking and cleaning but unable to do anything but sit, stare, and eat. It was a problem, really. Even with the bloody necklace, he still had an alliance to tend to.
“So, Ian and Doug want to get you out,” Harry continued.
Harry is splayed on his back, watching, bronze bicep folded over his eyes in defeat. Draco squats beside his boyfriend. “Tick,” he whispers into his ear. “Your turn.”
Dear Harry,
LCD is in its 3rd year. Which LCD fic from last year was my absolute favorite?
“What?” Malfoy replies.
at her feet. She beams up at him from beneath the rim of a floppy teal sunhat, radish earrings poking out the bottom along with a messy plait blond hair. She has woven daisies into her braid, and the faces of the flowers follow Draco as he moves. Magical plants have always struck him as creepy, but on Luna they’re rather whimsical. He wonders if this is how Harry sees them-- if this innocent, bubbly joy is why he loves gardening so much.
“What if we did that now?” Harry continues. “What if we spent all summer doing whatever we wanted?”
Harry starts as minty magic caresses his skin. “What the--” His eyes narrow. “Draco, are you trying to start something?”
“Love,” Draco says. “Joy.”
“You wanted to vote out Harry last Tribal,” she said with forced terseness. “We can make it happen in this one. He’s a threat; everyone likes him, he hasn’t screwed anyone over, and he’s loyal. Emotional votes will go to him. But if I’m up there beside you, well, they’re ambivalent towards you and they hate me. I won’t be getting any emotional appeals.”
Draco laughs wryly. “Haha, funny joke. Have you met me?”
“Oh, Harry, we always were.”
You said you love me! You said you love me!
“Brill,” Harry says. “Can you pick up curry at six?”
They shuffled over cautiously, like an anxious child towards their first stint in detention.
And then Harry smiles, and that seems to be enough, because Malfoy pauses, and pauses some more, and says “Okay.”
I cannot thank you enough for agreeing to work with me. We have a contentious past, and I am grateful that you seem willing to put it behind us. I appreciate your concern for my well-being, as well as for the compliments and understanding. If you insist upon, as you put it, treating me as a human being, I beg you to forgo any special treatment or pity. I do not want to be patronized or idolized.
Draco’s busy trying to get up. “What was that? You slurred.”
With a gasp, he burst back into wakefulness. “Harry, it’s exactly the same! If the stones were used to channel the energy of the Ley Lines into magic that could be used, I would have been able to feel those hundreds of years of curses affecting it because the spells would have been interacting with magic from the stone. Instead, it’s the exact same as the other one. These stones aren’t harnessing Ley Lines, they’re way more stable than that. The magic is old and varied, but it isn’t loose. I guess that’s why we haven’t been able to get them to react before. It almost feels like they
Malfoy widens his eyes in mock outrage. “Have I just been pulled by
“I’m fine,” Harry cut him off, “Just teasing. Carry on.”
He doesn’t know what to say, so he goes with, “Will you buy me a drink? You know, for all the trouble you caused?”
“Somewhere he can
“I saw you leave Hagrids,” Malfoy starts. “I wanted to make sure you were okay.”
Draco turns the music up. “My best friend,” Harry shouts, “once told me if she had an interview with the president, and this song came on, she’d stop asking questions to sing along.”
Day 28
It’s not Malfoy’s words, but the way he says them-- posh accent, mannerisms dripping with sarcasm, wicked wit-- that makes Harry laugh out loud. “Christ, I should have offered dinner and a movie.”
“Hm,” Harry says. “I love you.”
“So it
Ichabod continued to gaze at them, not attempting to move from where he was sitting on Hagrid’s hand.
“He’s, er, gone through some changes since you left him here,” Hagrid said, glancing at them over his shoulder.
Draco rolls his eyes fondly at Harry’s sneaker, his dimples deepening as a grin spreads across his face. “See you at mine,” he says as he steps into the restaurant’s apparition booth, disappearing with a snap.
“Fat cells don’t store heat or kinetic energy,” Harry added. “They store glucose, potential chemical energy that’s transformed later. And capacitors don’t store current, they store voltage, which is the electrical potential. We need to find magical potential energy.”
“... And then Sir Cadogen dropped his helmet on his pony’s foot, and then it kicked him in the face, and…” he blabbered between fits of giggles. Draco shot Claire a sympathetic glance.
Draco squeezes him tight to his chest in a playful hug. “No,” he admits, “I guess they don’t.”
A blustery wind blew through the camp on the 4th day of Survivor: Battle of the Coasts, and the balmy air smelled of rain and trouble. The dark skies matched Draco’s mood as he knelt in the abrasive sand from dawn to noon tending the fire. No matter where he moved, smoke followed him, making his eyes weep and his sinuses itch. He was sneezing constantly by the time Harry pulled him aside, the allergic reaction causing him to feel like ants had crawled into his ears and nose.
Harry’s eyes widened briefly and he headed for the door again. He certainly didn’t want to be late to dinner.
I know it must be hard to have felt like you were unable to go about your daily life for so long, but I want you to know that it's okay to need help. Focus on your healing. Reaching out is the first step, and it is incredibly brave and incredibly smart of you. If you had broken your leg, you would let the bone heal, especially if you had no access to Skele-Gro and had to heal it the Muggle way.
that it was impossible to pretend she wasn’t there at all. Resigning himself to his fate, Draco faked a toothy smile and turned to face her.
Harry hummed patiently. “Why don’t we go for a walk, yeah? We can come back tomorrow.”
“Can’t we just walk?” Harry asks. “There’s a park right round the corner.”
‘Yes.”
By noon, everyone was fed and watered, and the dishes were cleaned and put away (by a tired Ron, happy to have a second to himself while Harry and Luna entertained the kids). By two, mud tracks trailed up and down the hardwood floors of the cottage and a foot-deep hole had been dug with sand-box shovels in the garden by Jake, Ellie, and Teddy as they hunted for worms. By four, Hugo had fallen asleep on Luna’s lap and Harry was sweaty from participating in more rounds of freeze tag than he could count. Even Rhea, Nikhil, and Rose’s boundless energy was beginning to fade. Harry decided it was high-time for a movie.
Draco waits for the sun to break through the morning fog and for his nerves to settle, and then floos Harry’s office.
friend. You should know what to expect from him by now.”
If it will help you with your preliminary research, I can give some exposition on how the issues surrounding my magic have progressed over the past several years, as well as the strategies I have used to manage it myself.
Draco rolls his eyes. He steps into the floo, holding his breath as it whisks him to Harry’s flat. A curtain of vines blocks his exit, and he ducks clumsily on instinct, a cloud of soot rising to coat his robes. “Fuck you, Potter,” he huffs. The indulgently familiar scent of pine and humid earth flooding his senses.
“Glad we’re on the same page. I’m sorry you had to deal with that,” Lonnie said with a reassuring smile. Draco shrugged, leading the way back.
It is Harry’s reaction, Harry’s demand for control, that makes Draco snap. “Fuck,” he says. “Christ, Merlin, Harry, Fuck.”
“Second vote: Isabelle. Will not count.” Draco could tell this one was Jones’s from the soot stains. He let some of the tension ease from his shoulders. Harry grasped his clammy palm tightly.
Harry’s shirt is rucked up his torso, stubbornly refusing to come off-- Draco has convinced him to always size a tad tight (
The pitter-patter of rain against the window draws him out from the silence of Gryffindor Tower. The high Scottish air is thicker than usual with heavy drops and ambient mist, and Harry chases the smell of moss and life to the edge of the forest. He has left his cloak behind, and droplets tease the hairs on his arms and shiver after shiver runs down his spine. He has not felt so alive since he learned how it felt to die. He is too tired to think and too tired to try-- or even to not try. He is not himself, but he is alive.
He, Hermione, and Harry (who was involved in the project much more than was probably legal) had decided to test if certain artifacts (Stonehenge, Easter Island, etc.) might have been built along these magical currents, or Ley Lines, and if they were used by ancient societies to harness magic, similar to the way that modern wizards used wands. They thought that if they could better understand how different cultures had controlled magic, they could reverse engineer the core components  of magic.
“Ron,” Harry said, “It’s June.”
“Well,” she continued, releasing them from a tense silence. She had mastered the deft, quiet diplomacy of a politician’s wife. “I suppose I should ask who you are voting for.”
She lifts to her tippy-toes to smack a kiss to his cheek, and he pulls her in by the back of her floral sundress for a quick hug.
When they arrived back at camp, the sun was already up. Draco looked at Harry sheepishly and conjured a bucket, filling it quickly with an Aguamenti. “Let me do the talking,” he said. “You’re shit at lying.” Harry grimaced at Draco’s imposed American accent.
” Harry assures. He’s trying to be serious, but his eyes are far too wide and bright.
Before I got your arm half-charred, I’d have told you all about the hippogriff feather in the attic or the finger painting on the dresser. I found a photo of my father and Sirius at the fair. I wish I was healthy enough to ride roller coasters-- I think I would have liked it if you had taken me. I’d probably puke on someone’s shoes, though, or apparate half the patrons into the Atlantic. Maybe someday, if it’s not too late.
Harry hummed in agreement. “Good point. Well, I’ll only be able to do fake ones for now anyway, so it shouldn’t be a problem.”
He sets them up with lawn chairs and bottles of an effervescent fermented tea that Harry adores, tuning the wireless to a jazz station and leaning back in the sun.
Later that day, after the last class had let out, Harry and Draco left the school and headed to their new home – a small cottage on the outskirts of Hogsmeade. The close proximity to Hogwarts had been part of the appeal, with them both having taken up teaching positions. Harry was the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and Draco had followed the career path that Harry had always imagined he would and become Potions Master. They’d been teaching at the school for a couple of years before finally getting together, and it had been another year or so more before they’d felt ready to move in with one another.
“I think you’ll probably see Draco more than me,” Harry admitted. “But that’s very kind of you.”
Prepare for the finale! Also, how exactly do Rai stones work? (And how did gear theory wind up in a fic about a game-show?)
It was the day of a Reward Challenge, but Draco could already tell little else was going to get done. Strategizing was hard to do when no one ever left the shelter. The tribe had divided into two rough alliances, Doug, Harry, and Ian leading the first and the lawyer, Ed, who had gotten into multiple clashes with Ian already, staking a claim on the other. Draco and Isabelle, who had already established the foundations of a genuine friendship, formed a satellite group of the lawyer’s alliance. Without having been to a Tribal, it was still to be seen how the team would fare in the face of adversity.
You shagged me until I felt absolutely boneless, but now, just an hour later, I still feel too happy to sleep. But, as I see you now, sleeping in my bed with a smile on your face in the dawn-light, and healthier-looking than I have ever seen you, I just want to capture this moment forever. If you wake up now, and I’m not here, I’m just in my study to get my sketch block and oil pastels. I’ll be back in a moment, love.
Harry catches him as he goes limp. “I changed my mind,” he mumbles. “I like dance classes. Dance classes are good.”
“Er--” Draco pauses to wonder when Harry became so attuned to his life. “There was a mistake with the order. Now there’s a new one.”
“Yes. I do,” Harry replied, eyeing the toad in Draco’s arms. “I know you don’t want to believe it, but none of this stuff was happening before he arrived. It’s a bit of a coincidence, don’t you think?”
Malfoy doesn’t react. It is the most civil, the most subdued they have ever been. “Do I have to worry, then? About getting my teeth knocked in or something?”
“Draco, you know I can drive. You helped me study for the test.”
He lines himself up, pushes in slow and indulgent. As he bottoms-out, his eyes open, neck straightening from where it has been tilted up to the ceiling. He wants to watch. Harry is still, mouth open on a sigh and forehead wrinkled: bliss.
I know that last night was probably the best night of my life thus far, and that, if my life was paused, it has surely restarted. I know I’m fucking insatiable, and I want to do it again, right now, and I’ll do anyhting to make it good for you, too. I really, truly, didn’t think I’d ever be able to have sex again without hurting someone. I haven’t been able to lose control of myself for fear of catastrophe in so long that I became my own prisoner. A paradox, I suppose. I lost myself in being unable to lose myself. The protective spells and the shattered windows were annoying, but fuck,
His eyes glinted maliciously. “CJ, Claire, Come here,” He demanded.
“Don’t be silly,” Hagrid said with a smile. “You’re welcome to visit him any time you want.”
They are a shooting star in the night, the moon just now rising with a purple ring. The track ahead of them shimmers gold, fluid and airy, and Harry wonders if it only appears when he looks at it.
Draco’s face twisted into a filthy grin. “That’s never stopped you before.”
Day 22
He starts with one finger, conjuring lube with a snap and pumping lazily, barely brushing Harry’s prostate with each supine stroke. Harry is bucking back unevenly, breaths heaving around desperate mewls. In this position, he is unable to reach for his cock. “Ah, ah. A ringlock will get you nowhere here,” he gasps. “Better go for the full hand-jamb.”
When it was Draco’s turn to step up to the pedestal, he was up against Marissa, who, while boring, was one damn tough cookie. When Jeff lifted the cover, the spectating contestants blanched, but Draco just grit his teeth, took a deep breath through his nose, and shoved the thing down his throat, careful to chew in a way that avoided spreading the disgusting, gooey larvae over his taste buds.
Neville’s laughter echoes through the stoop, harmonizing the wind chimes and distant drone of city traffic. He is easy to amuse. “What can I do for ya.”
The production crew rolled out a set of wooden ladders, allowing each contestant to climb up and settle atop their poles. Draco had drawn green. Directly adjacent to him, Harry was on red. He wrapped his legs firmly around the structure, slotting his thighs and arms along the sharp divots in the beam. Locking his ankles together and his hands over his elbows, he tucked his head and braced himself for the long-haul.
“She told us we should gun for you. She thinks you need to go,” Isabelle replied calmly. They and Jessie had simply been doing the dishes.
“Things will all fall apart if she stays, anyway. She’ll want to vote for you, and I won’t be able to dissuade her until she’s got Jessie and Claire on board. We have to, don’t we?” Draco added, bitter dejection audible in his low voice.
Harry laughs. “I’ve been pawning them off to friends and neighbors. But I’ve been meaning to ask-- is there any way I can have space on your porch for the flower bed? Shit, and I really can’t part with my Madagascar Palm. Or the violets, or my peperomia, or the Saguaro I grew from seed. And my pitcher plant-- I promise it won't try to bite Pansy’s crup again. Fuck, I hate to ask this of you, Draco, but it would mean a lot to me.”
“Woah, woah, woah,” the woman says. “Slow down.”
P.s. I think Desdemona likes you. She seems particularly eager to leave today. Let me know what kind of owl treats you stock; I just might have to buy some myself.
The firemaking challenge ended rather abruptly, as they always tended to do, with Harry’s flame growing steadily and Jessie scraping dust off her flint with increasing desperation. Draco supposed Harry would tell him, after this was all over, whether he had used magic or not. Knowing his husband, or, rather, knowing Hermione’s influence on his husband, Draco figured he probably hadn’t.
Jeff bobbed his head in a curt, dramatized salute. “First vote: Tara.” Harry’s uneven, slanted scrawl slashed across the page. One corner was splattered with black ink.
Draco is dressed in heeled leather boots, black jeans, and a forest green underbust bustier that manages to appear both dainty and intimidating. The fabric is a silky translucent mesh, adorned with embroidered snakes that twist with the curve of his body. Although only a strip of skin between his solar plexus and the top-most line of his abs is covered, the garment’s clean lines highlight Draco’s trim waist and flexed pecs. The boning and hems are wrapped in satin, and it gleams under the stage lights. The moody burlesque-club atmosphere does wonders for every muscle, every movement. Harry wants to
Merlin help me, Harry, but I have to be bold. Bolder than I have ever been in my life. I don’t know if you feel the same, but I believe the house attacked me because I’m yours in a way that Hermione and Ron aren’t.
I know that you make me feel like I can breathe again. I want to show all my teeth when I smile, and go on 4am breakfast runs, and pinch you for a laugh while I hold your hand. I want the thrill and the excitement and the rush of falling, and kissing in the rain, and flirting when I shouldn’t, but I don’t want to be reckless, because you calm me, too. You make me think that maybe it will be okay. That I can take a chance on faith not because I don’t care, but because I do. I look out over the hills, and I still want to run, but this time I want to come back.
On that note, I thank you for making me aware of the magical force with which the letter entered your office. Desdemona, my owl, has been limping recently, and I could not for the life of me figure out where she had hurt herself. I feel truly terrible. I will have to bring her back into the clinic to let them know. If this message arrives a few days late, know that is why.
Harry unlocks his feet, whining and bucking up for leverage. Draco catches each leg, massaging and kissing the muscles before swinging them over his shoulder. Harry shudders, his heels digging into Draco’s back as he uses the new position to thrust up unevenly.
Incidentally, it did work, and Tribe West Coast finished the puzzle piece collection portion of the challenge a solid 60 seconds before Tribe East. Where they lost was in the puzzle. Drenched in sweat and dizzy, Draco watched helplessly as Doug and Isabelle absolutely bombed it.
“Draco, you and I both played hard, strategic games. Whereas I trusted my instincts, you trusted your head. In what ways do you feel these strategies are similar?” It was a leading question, and Jones knew it. He sneered at Draco, smug and rotten. It was very Mrs. Trunchbull.
I am able to live mostly self-sufficient, cooking and cleaning for myself. Often, I can do other non-magical activities as well. On good days, I feel almost invincible, a manic magical charge running through me that makes me feel like I can accomplish any spell or physical feat. On bad days, however, I am barely able to function.
-- and for a moment he thinks he will never be able to look away, but then Draco’s hips swivel, and Harry’s eyes follow on their own accord.
It was the third straight day of back-to-back challenges, and Draco could have sworn the quarter-mile slog from the beach drop-off point to the competition site took 45 minutes. When they finally padded around the corner, CJ groaned from the front of the line. Eight tall, grooved poles rose from a sandy flat at the center of a shady glen.
The spires of the castle are a forest around them, each gargoyle and painted window shuttering and charmed gutter as intricate as the next, suspended in time as they rush and weave above the hidden hallways of Hogwarts.
Draco,
The morning of the first Immunity Challenge, Tara coached them all through a round of yoga. It was torturous, so Draco planted himself right where he could get the best view of Harry’s arse. Harry even sent him a cheeky smile during downward dog, but it did nothing to ebb Draco’s growing disconnect with his husband. He really hated sharing.
“I love nature, and my garden is my favourite place in the whole world. I have a cat named after a mathematician. My University research thesis is my proudest achievement. I watch Survivor obsessively every Wednesday and my partner always falls asleep, but when we watch his shows, I do my best to stay awake.”
Jeff Probst greeted them with a winning smile, his khaki button-down and undeniable charm colouring the atmosphere even more thrilling.
Harry
Draco nodded, looking pleased that Harry had given in. “And some leafy plants. We’ll need to charm a weather system in the tank too, to keep things damp.”
He looked at Harry, entirely overwhelmed. Harry’s pupils blew wide and his shoulders rode up with tension. They stood in shock, facing the ocean, for what felt like an eternity before Harry blinked and shivered, as if physically fighting off a stupor. He closed his eyes and waved his wand high, and the world exploded with colour.
Draco Malfoy
Harry eyes him up and down, bushy eyebrows shooting up demonstratively. “I’d sure love to!”
“And you don’t think people will notice all the grease missing from my hair?” Draco asked, not really caring if anyone did or not.
He closed his eyes, savouring the way magic fizzed around them, the way it seeped inside of him as he breathed it in. It was a dangerous sort of magic, blooming from within the Earth’s core and carrying with it echoes of every spell ever cast and every wizard ever born-- that would be born. Usually, it was vast and subdued, but when manipulated it became a tempest. In many ways, Ley Lines were like the sea.
Draco is busy re-tying the apron around his waist. “Right, right,” he says in an exaggerated American accent, “I’ll be showing you an example of my artistic process, but I’ll be using this gentleman here as my canvas! Don’t worry, it washes out!” Harry smirks as Jason and Fred share another look.
In a rush of pearly steam, the carriage takes off into the darkness, smooth and steadily accelerating. Just when they can no longer make out each other’s faces, the world explodes into color.
“They have such an interesting texture,” Kristen notes. “I wonder what sort of paint was used.”
You told me that you use your mother’s scarf to calm yourself and that you anchored your magic in the woods. These are two good intuitive responses. One way I suggest we work on this would be to develop strategies to help your body learn that you are no longer at war. For this, I suggest we focus on watching your stress levels and finding ways to regulate them.
“Don’t start doubting my abilities now! Remember, I’m
Harry stares, not moving closer, not backing away. The music presses in around them. He reaches out a tentative hand, but pulls it back to his side; his fingers twitch, still reaching. “God. Fuck. Can I touch you?” His voice shakes.
Harry nodded, tugging on Draco’s arm until he followed him out of Hagrid’s hut.
He lifted her, aided by the waist-deep tide, and set her down gently on the nearest shelf of dryland, a rounded boulder around the corner of the peninsula.
Marissa proved a tough egg to crack. She was bland, but it turned out she wasn’t nearly as aloof as she came across. Draco wished she had shown this kind of attention span when he had been bored to tears from talking to her two weeks prior. Apparently, she just found other human beings unworthy of putting work into.
Draco pulls back, lips the colour of the scarlet velvet drapings. He soothes the nips on Harry’s neck with the pad of his thumb. “You okay?”
Draco would be lying if he said he wasn’t shocked. They had spent so much time in Hermione’s office going over the Statute of Secrecy and muggle protection protocols that it hadn’t even occurred to him that there could be another magical person on the island.
“Something wrong, Harry?” Hagrid asked, pausing as he saw the expression on Harry’s face.
“What’s going on with you and Harry?” she asked, and Draco laughed stiffly. He and Harry were still not on speaking terms, and they interacted only in polite small talk and in the company of their alliance. Even Lindsay had mentioned that they ‘seemed to be getting along better’. He supposed that compared to their usual scathing banter, it did seem like they were getting along, but in Harry-and-Draco world, getting along meant there was something very, very wrong.
“I can see,” he replies. “Neville filled you in, I take?” He leads her towards the kissing gate that opens up to his back garden, suddenly excited to show off his project.
Draco yelped, and Harry whispered a soft “Come here” in his ear as they landed in lush moss. Draco opened his eyes slowly, barely aware that he had squeezed them shut, to a view of a magnificent waterfall. Mist hung in the air, and, even in the grey overcast light, rainbows danced between the trees. Vines twisted up the rocky shale that guided the clear, cascading stream, and the atmosphere was filled with a pleasant splashing and gurgling.
Harry had broken Draco’s trust; he had blatantly disregarded the Statute of Secrecy, allowing his impulses to get the better of him and directly incite chaos. Draco did not need his husband to protect him.
Draco winks. “I see how it is. Kinky.”
“Should I ask what you’re doing here?” he says. The wind tries to snatch his words away.
Unfortunately, a disunified tribe does not make a particularly well-oiled challenge machine. The third Immunity Challenge of the game took place on the lush white sand of a long beach. It was pillowy and warm beneath their feet, but while it may have been well suited for tanning, it was abysmal for running. The challenge required each team to split into four pairs. In three of those pairs, one member would be digging for pieces of a puzzle while the other transported the pieces one at a time to a central location on the beach. The other two members would be assembling the puzzle once the pieces were collected.
“We’ve woven such a web of lies I’m starting to believe them myself,” Draco replied with a drily satisfied chuckle.
I’ll see you tomorrow.
food.”
The challenge was a classic, and one of Draco’s all-time favorites. The individual structures were similar to marble mazes, with metal tracks that a ball rolled down, twisting and swirling several times. At the center, there was a split, and a simple mechanical switch caused the direction the ball turned to alternate every other run.
Malfoy sheds his shirt, too, and sits, rocking down to his back and laying wide-open to the sky, platinum hair and freckled shoulders against a century of pebbles and dust. Harry stares because he can.
,” Isabelle pondered, “What the hell does that mean?”
“Hey, hey Claire, you wanna know a secret?” Harry slurred.
Harry is frozen, mouth slack and breathing fast. He makes a fuss about adjusting his pants. The audience has exploded into hysteria.
The morning was eerily quiet throughout breakfast and into the afternoon. It was not mentioned again until Harry and Draco had Apparated away.
“Gonna play some music,” he says.
Day 5
“Well, no, can’t say that I have,” Hagrid said, frowning. “What happened, Harry?”
You mentioned your reactions to Okafor’s potions. It should not feel like that. I think we should talk about it more in person, and make an appointment with Okafor. Meanwhile it’s safer if you don’t take the potions.
“Okay,” he said, finally, “let’s talk it out. Making a concrete plan is almost impossible in a social strategy game, so I think the first thing we need to do is gather information. This could blow over in a day; we don’t know. I think we should get serious about eavesdropping-- use charms and stuff to listen in on conversations and then exploit weaknesses. We look for holes and then sew paranoia.”
“Okay,” Draco said. “I still wouldn’t touch it.” He approached the stone cautiously, casting his diagnostic spells from a sizable distance.
Ian dove for the next rope, needing two breaths to get it untied, and Draco looked across the water to check the other team’s progress. His heart sank; they were already throwing for the upcoming platform.
(See the end of the chapter for
The club is heady and overwhelming, and doesn’t feel nearly like the escape Harry craves. He staves away the fear that even this-- even the booming music, the stranger’s cologne, the neon signs washed out by strobe lights and techno-- won’t be enough to forget, even with another drink. He staves away today, and yesterday, and tomorrow with more drinks after that.
“Oh.”
“Maybe. Limestone isn’t found anywhere else near here. Guam, I think, but I’ve never heard of a Ley Line being there. The limestone could have special properties. Like, the molecular structure could have tiny pockets that are perfectly suited for holding magic. Same theory as Stonehenge or the hole in the stones, but repeated millions of times throughout the rock. And the magical energy wouldn't ever refract out because it’s enclosed on all sides. These caves are close enough to the surface of the Ley Lines that bits of magic bounce off and get stuck in them, and then they just stay there.
Draco felt like he was losing control. His sense-of-being was centered in his mind; it was the only thing he trusted without a doubt. With no way to measure his sanity, though, he quickly became frustrated and frightened.
“Fine by me,” Draco agreed. “When we go back up to the school, we’ll have to find Hagrid to see if he knows what Ichabod will eat.”
“I like that idea,” said Harry, and Draco gave him a warning glare. Potter shrugged, tapping the man beside him on the shoulder. “Would you like to guard with me?” he asked, and the man affirmed with an easy smile and a clap on Harry’s arm. His shock of shaggy sandy blond hair was pushed back against his ears and his biceps bulged from his faded tank top. He and Potter were two peas in a pod. They both looked straight out of Point Break.
In your letter you seemed to insinuate that I might feel obliged or indebted to spend time with you. While gratitude might compel me to help somebody with their curse-damage or other magic-related health problems, the time I would invest would be strictly limited to the necessity. In the case of yesterday, it would have been staying only for the tests themselves. That would have been thirty minutes, but I stayed until two am. The reason why I stayed that long: pure enjoyment of your company.
Harry bores everyone but Neville with an in depth explanation of the garden layout. Which is ironic, considering Draco’s favourite part of the garden is that it barely has a layout at all-- everything is wild and organic and beautiful.
Content Warning for mild discussions of injury
When he pulled himself back into bed less than 10 minutes later, he didn’t even try to feign nonchalance. His bloodshot eyes refused to still in the pale dawn light, omitting a spastic paranoia that dripped throughout the tribe along with the seawater from his clothes.
Draco’s calf spasmed violently, and he clamped his knees tighter together with a grimace. His feet, slick with drying sweat, slid slowly apart.
“We should fuck behind the waterfall,” Draco mumbled distantly, hypnotized by the dancing rainbows and crashing water.
“Protego!” he shouted, and, as if the magic had a mind of its own, she spun, the base of her thigh scraping the rock and pushing her away. Draco caught her as she tumbled towards the sea, and they both landed with a splash.
“What happened to me-- what I did-- do you think it was tragic or beautiful? I’ve never thought of my life like that, never thought about if it means anything. Maybe I should.”
There is a drawn out silence. Harry has spent the last month wishing Hogwarts wasn’t so quiet, but, in this moment, it feels fitting. He supposes Malfoy is thinking. Harry, though, is just staring in awe.
Draco wrinkled his forehead. “What do you mean?”
Yours, till the end of time,
gotten into an Ivy.
Hagrid opened the door a few seconds later and gazed at them for a moment. “Ah. I don’t think I’m going to need that now.”
he scrawls,
Draco disappears within the booth, now obscured from the audience. He rustles the curtain for a moment deliberately as he goes. Within, Bill Hader stands against the wall of the set. He hands Draco a mostly empty bottle of KY jelly silently. Draco shakes it close to the mic on his chest, loud enough for the audience to hear, before squeezing some out with a squelch. Bill giggles into his hands.
Another thing about the medical side of our interaction: the colour of the charm will clash against your skin for the first times you wear it, but it changes its hue with adjusting to your magic and with how much work it has to do to stabilize you . It has most likely already undergone subtle changes since you put it on, and will harmonize with your skin tone after two or three days.
are indescribably brilliant.
The clearing that hosted the challenge was colourless except for a green and orange rope marking the perimeter of a muddy flat. Draco assumed that, as of yesterday, it had all been hard-packed dirt. Even Jeff’s moisture-wicking trousers were plastered to his body.
Draco’s movements were jerky and scattered, his lips slightly parted and teeth clenched so tightly the corner of his jaw twinged. There was no way he was going to make it much longer. Fortunately, Marissa seemed to be in the same boat. She made a narrow save, barely managing to swoop in and right one of her balls after she dropped it into the chute slightly off-center.

“I learned to play
“Nope.”
“Out?” Draco repeats.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine, fine,
Harry
“So he was never truly happy with us?” Draco asked, sounding disappointed.
Harry groaned, closing his eyes and letting his head fall back against the pillow again. “Great. So what now? How long do I have to stay here for?”
“We make Doug paranoid by isolating him. I invite Marissa or Ian or Lindsay or any combination of those people out for chores or swims until Doug gets the message that he’s an outsider. He’ll start asking questions, and the alliance will turn on him because, subconsciously, they
Harry gave him an incredulous look. “Don’t use words like persnickety. It’ll turn people off of you,” he muttered.
“The Room of Hidden Things, yeah. The magic, though-- the magic can’t burn. We should go, conjure something new. I bet all this time the castle’s just been holding in the flames. We should make it something happy.”
Harry nodded slightly, his eyes still closed. This was a lot to get his head around.
Hermione smiled.
The race to the adjacent empty alleyway is rushed and desperate. The top three buttons on Harry’s shirt end up undone; somehow, one has even been torn off entirely.
Whatever is in the stone, it doesn’t channel magic the way we thought it would.
Day 9
He sprints into the house, skidding to a stop in the living room just as the image of Harry’s head solidifies in the fire. Harry raises his eyebrows at Draco’s flustered arrival and the streak of mud on his cheek.
“You don’t remember anything?”
“How do you do that?” is all he can think to ask. “When you Apparate, it feels like a plane taking off. ‘Mione says I’m like a helicopter in a hurricane.”
I started taking the potions that I picked up from Okafor. I’ve felt a bit more faint and jittery than usual. Is that normal? I understand that the potion is supposed to work by blocking cortisol receptors in my brain, thus weakening the ion field that triggers my magical signature. Shouldn’t it be making me more subdued and tired, rather than restless and dizzy? Also, some of my addictive cravings are back for the first time since I kicked the habit. I have asked Molly to keep an extra eye on me, but if you say it’s going to be okay, I trust you.
CJ stood up, and Draco’s eyes widened. Isabelle squeezed his shoulder; this had not been expected.
Draco guffaws, giggles squeezing his ribs as he doubles over in uproarious laughter.
Jones cleared his throat loftily. “This voucher grants you an extra vote at any of the next five Tribal Councils. You may write on the blank side of this sheet and cast it in the urn in addition to your regular vote, and it will be counted against the player whose name you have written down.”
Draco’s lips meet his, and it’s nothing but real.
“I don’t. We got in five good weeks of playacting. Now it has to go back to the way it was and—” his voice cracks—“It was fucking miserable, okay! I shouldn‘t have trusted you. It seemed so novel—befriend the enemy. What a way to say fuck it to reality. What a way to stop being me.”
Harry growls, tugging at a belt loop on Draco’s jeans. “Not at all.”
“Well, if I ever,” he snorts. “Draco Malfoy, caught in a rainstorm. Come on, let’s get you upstairs.”
” Draco groaned.
Fragrant leaves hung above Draco’s head, lining the walls of the auditorium. A sea of faces stretched from the lip of the stage, anticipation palpable in the air. Behind him, the remainder of the cast sat poised on the edge of their seats. On the left, he held tight to Claire’s hand. On the right, he linked his elbow with Harry’s.
As for ADHD, I have actually heard of it. The student-health doc at uni tried to prescribe me something for it along with a few other things, but at that point I was already using potions, and I didn’t want to take anything that might have reacted poorly with them. Visiting a specialist sounds scary, but I suppose it’s likely a good idea. I’d love if you came with me to the appointment, if only to buffer my crippling awkwardness.
He sloshed through the waves to reach it. “
Draco was awful at accepting compliments, so he grabbed her hand instead, pulling her in for a long hug.
Jessie took it in stride, nodding her thanks and returning to her seat.
When someone asks Draco to dance, Draco looks to Harry for direction. “Um, okay, I guess?” he stammers. Harry gives him a nod of encouragement, but it only takes until the kid has put his hand on Draco’s waist for Harry to wish he hadn’t urged Draco on. He gives them one song, and then moves in.
“Model,” Iz corrected. “And she only does that part time to pay for her english BA. Did you ever even talk to her?”
Harry stops too, in the middle of the alleyway. “No, it’s okay. What?”
A smiling crewmember placed their feast in the ornate Tree-Mail basket shortly past 11 in the morning. Harry was still fast asleep, but Draco was long since up, pacing the woods as he rehearsed his Jury speech.
Harry gave him a gentle smile. “I’m okay. My magic isn’t burning me up inside anymore. But I’ll eat, for you, k?”
“Simply taking a light stretch, Potter.” Draco jeered bitterly. “It’s a lovely day, don’t you think?”
Harry’s breath catches in his throat. “Definitely.”
The footsteps taper. “Does it feel like yours?” Malfoy asks.
He gave her a long hug, blinking back tears, and then her torch was extinguished with a gentle puff. It finally hit Draco that his Survivor experience was coming to a close. Characters were disappearing, plotlines closing, and, after over a month of mystery and misery, the adventure he had dreamed of was nearing climax.
Draco is soaked to the bone, dirt caked to his knees and mud dripping down his temple from where he has pushed his hair out of his eyes with a filthy hand over and over again.
Since magic was part of the anatomical makeup of the earth, it had to abide by some sort of laws of physics, but these laws were nothing like non-magical ones. The magic wasn’t constrained by gravity, thermodynamics, or a single Newton’s law. Instead, they had theorized that the Earth contained powerful magical currents that reacted with magic to give it the properties that made it possible to control.
Harry smiled gently. “Oh Draco, you
“You know about weed, too? You’re a teenage connoisseur.”
Malfoy shrugs. “Snape.”
However, there is one text that helped many magical people recently. Its origin is kind of mysterious, but it’s a handwritten journal found between books about complicated magic, such as becoming an Animagus, in the Hogwarts library. The parchment dates from the 1950s, but we can only date the age of the surface, not of the letters written on it. It’s called the Prongs manuscript.
Men like that usually don't care about what makes you feel good. They only care about what makes

like a robot.
It was good to see you last night. You look good-- like you’ve filled into your place in the world. Or perhaps it is a comparative observation. Either way, it was more of an adventure than I’ve had in a long time. So thank you. I appreciate the company anytime.
“Doug especially seems to be the odd one out. He seems to have staunch ideas about how he wants things done and he expects us to follow. I understand why he seemed reasonable at first, but I don’t think it’s in your interest to continue playing with him. He doesn't do well in challenges, and, after the merge, things won't get better. No matter what, the attention will always be on him, if only for his size, and that’s enough to make him a winner contender. He’ll always be right at the forefront of the game if we don’t do anything about it. Also, just think. He doesn’t need the money; the guy made weekly showings on ESPN for 20 years. He’s got cash and then some.”
When the spells were finally gone, Draco began his inspection. He sat in the grass, eyes closed and legs crossed. It was a process not unlike meditation. Then, with a complex wave of his wand, he visualized the magical field of the stone, felt it’s presence, and ventured inside so that it’s signature surrounded him.
Harry tuts. “This is why I like
The coin in Draco’s pocket buzzes, and he jumps. “Shit,” he mutters. “I’ll be right back.”
“I didn’t do it for you, Potter,” Draco says.
P.P.P.S (Is this even a thing?) Last one, I promise. Remember how you were telling me about how much you’ve been enjoying hiking and backpacking, and that you were looking for some interesting nature essays? I was at a little Muggle used bookstore the other day and I found an 1890 edition Robert Service poetry collection. I don’t know how the thing ended up on this side of the pond, but he’s one of my absolute favourites. I also picked up an Oscar Wilde short story anthology-- you seemed like the type to like that kind of stuff. I’ll hand them over whenever I see you next and we can start a little book club or something (Merlin, that sounds lame, but I promise, give Service a chance. At least read
He pushes up on his toes easily, pressing his palm into the underside of a broad sloper and matching with his opposite index finger. Grinning smugly, he carefully descends the down-climb jugs, hopping two-footed onto the mats.
“Glad we’re on the same page.”
Draco admires silently from the mats as Harry projects, appreciating the way his brow knits in total focus, the way his bottom lip curls between his teeth when he reaches max exertion.
“I think my mother used to read it to me. I wanted to be the Master of Death.”
Isabelle smiled. “Without a clue? Bold.”
“I just want to start over, but I can’t. I can’t, or I wont, or I don’t even know! I still hate you! I fucking hate you, Malfoy. Why can’t I just have this one thing? Is this it? Is this what my life will be? I want a
flipping over and meeting Dracos eyes at just-this-side-of-too-close proximity.
“I guess I didn’t mean it,” Draco said sadly, and Harry pulled him into a hug, summoning both of their wands from where they were hidden outside of camp and apparating them away without warning.
Harry shakes his head.
“Yeah. I know of a party happening tonight. You seem like you need to think about something other than school.”
“Well, what are you waiting for, Potter,” he snarked. “The cuisine not up to your standard? I didn’t think the bar was very high.” Harry shot him a glowering pout but said nothing. “Cat got your tongue? If you’re smart enough not to talk back, maybe there’s hope after all. See, you're meant to pick up the food on your plate, and then you're meant to eat it. It’s simple, really, and I’ve already given a demonstration!”
He waved Harry over with a conspicuous flap of his hand, mouthing ‘save me’ and feigning a stroke. Harry rolled his eyes and ambled to meet him near the Tree-Mail box.
. He pours all of himself into everything he does, striving for the sort of confidence that can only come with competence. Draco does not do anything for the sake of doing it; there is always intention. He
The holly wand is pushed back into his palm, but Harry doesn’t break the Incarcerous binding their wrists. “Christ,” Draco says. “Where’s that blunt?” He yanks Harry to his feet by the arm fast enough to hurt.
“I wish more people would come,” Harry says. “The emptiness at meals reminds me of everyone who’s missing.”
Day 56
Potter shrugs. “I figured you were up to something.”
Rocks, it turned out, was sort of a broad search area. “Landmarks,” he muttered. “We should look for landmarks.” Iz bounced on her heels excitedly, and Draco smirked, rolling his eyes. “Play it up a little more for the cameras, why don’t you,” he teased.
Harry sat up, fully awake with fists clenched, and marched into the forest. Draco followed.
They run, breast to breast, breathless and stifling giggles to save their lungs. Harry’s eyes are locked on the corridor in front of him, and the windmilling of his arms and legs feels wild and out of control, but to the outside observer, it remains precise.
“Finding Nemo, then?” Harry asked.
Draco’s discussion with Marissa went well; it was short and discreet, but she seemed convinced. The real issues began later, an hour or so before Tribal.
He yanked twice at his lock, eyes squinted shut and puffy. A strangled sob intersected his gasping breaths and the stifling heat of the sun on his back felt like it was burying him alive. He was trapped, drifting; a vagrant in his own body.
“Is that why you think he was a hero?”
Draco smiled. He had everything thought through. “During the day, we leave one at a time. You go first while camp is busy in the morning, then I’ll go in the lull of the afternoon. At night, we go together while everyone else is asleep. Every day, we change up the schedule slightly. We play on separate alliances, so we know what is going on at all times. In addition, we use amplifying charms to listen to others' conversations and Muffiato to talk. Obviously, we can’t Obliviate or Confund anyone because of the cameras, so instead, we use subtle magic to our advantage. As for our relationship, we just pretend. Easy!”
“Thanks,” Draco breathed softly. He turned his wistful expression towards the ground.
“Changes? What kind of changes?” Draco asked, putting the terrarium down on the table.
have to vote with your alliance, you might be able to subtly convince others not to. Manipulation, my dear, is not so hard when you have vastly greater knowledge.
With everyone distracted, Kristen steps closer to the display of paintings, reaching out with one finger, she pokes one, jumping back in surprise. Laughs from the audience echo around the studio.
She really was a decent kid, Draco decided, just inexperienced and eager to prove herself.
Harry stops walking. “And the Carrows never found out?”
She climbed up 10 feet and then 20, traversing back and forth to check each crack and crevice. She was so focused he suspected she likely didn’t know how high up she was. She shrieked, and Draco’s head snapped up, his stance widening to attempt to spot if he needed.
Four high platforms stood at the center of the beach, held up by three posts and a narrow spiral staircase. At the top, a stack of wooden gears were stacked neatly and a bucket was suspended from a beam and a rope. At the base, outside of a circular fence enclosing the suspended bucket, sat a large jug and a second small bucket.
Draco slunk back to camp. Apparently, the Orange Tribe was already prepared to kamikaze their own before even the first vote, and Tara’s interest showed she probably wasn’t interested in flipping.
Draco looked away sheepishly, letting silence overtake them.
Potter gave him a disparaging look. “We’ve got three priorities; we need to be able to get away long enough every day to do our research on Rai stones, we need to stay in the game, and we need to pretend we don’t know each other. How do you suggest we go about that?”
to the beat of his pounding heart
Dear Mr. Potter,
Draco didn’t have much time to explore upon arriving at the new beach, but from his short tour of the well and the fire-pit, he considered it dreadful. Much was the same as their old camp, but he couldn’t help thinking that the cot here was lumpier and the sea murkier.
Yours,
Draco rolled his eyes. “How could I ever forget.”
“Thank you Marissa,” Harry started, “The first major move I made was during the vote for Doug. I was the alliance member that approached Isabelle and Draco about voting him out, and I helped plan the talking points we brought to you, Ian, and Lindsay. Then, when Ben was voted off, I was the alliance member that talked to Jessie and convinced her to flip to our side. Also, I was a strong physical player, and my Reward and Immunity wins shaped the course of the game because they shifted which players spent time with each other and which players got votes.”
The novelty of perfecting my letters has worn off, so I suppose now is a good time to tell you that I can’t watch ants. Don’t be surprised if my script only gets more chaotic from here; proofreading and I do not get along. My aunt and uncle tried to send me off to ‘St. Brutus’s Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys’ because I never sat still in class or in my cupboard, and while that may have been a pretty severe reaction, they weren’t wrong about the fidgeting.
“Show me,” he says. “
to be. Draco was having trouble sleeping anyway, and he saw no harm in getting a headstart on the paper summarizing his Rai stone research.
“C’mon, Harry, It’s just been busy at work lately.”
“Yours,” Harry repeats, but he isn’t talking about Draco. His chest leans in before his feet can keep up, and he nearly slumbles. The firm weight of a soft hand lands on his waist. A heavy breath leaves his lungs.
“You too?” Malfoy says. He sits on a bench beside the Black Lake, a mug of tepid tea clutched in his lap. It is dinner time again.
scared. Look at that; I’ve finally broken you!”
Mr. Malfoy,
Draco laughed. “Sure you do.”
Ian agreed enthusiastically, adding that he always felt like Doug was being insincere and that his paternal nature was patronizing and disrespectful. It was a good sign that the others were saying more than ‘yeah, man, I feel you.’ He didn’t trust any of them to be this good at acting.
“Won’t fit in my car,” Harrys says with a shrug.
“I bet there’s an Immunity Idol near that weird tree,” Draco commented, but he trudged after his irksome husband, laden with empty buckets and a belly full of sizzling excitement.
Harry Potter
Draco slaps back-- there is something uniquely disarming about Neville’s smile. “I hope I didn’t keep you long. Harry demanded pudding.”
A shaggy brown head pops out from behind an azalea bush. “Draco!” Neville jumps to his feet, a shower of mulch falling from his knees. He holds out a thick, calloused hand and slaps Draco on the back when he takes it. “Glad I could make it.”
Draco sets the table long before any guests arrive, just for an excuse to go outside. The garden is ethereal under summer blue skies, wild and ever-changing and teeming with life. It’s a fractal; no matter how close one looks, there is always another layer. More than once, Draco’s thought he’s spotted fairies-- not the ones he knows, but the kind from muggle children’s tales.
If I miss my appointment with you on Tuesday, at least I can say I reached out. If I do come, and you aren’t there, I suppose I can say I tried.
I'm yours in whatever way you accept me.
Hermione and Ron’s television was hidden behind a clever charm that transformed it into a coffee table when not in use. Harry transfigured it back with a flick of his wand, pulling out the crate of DVDs and leafing through them with a smile on his face. He picked up the top stack-- the most watched movies-- thumbing the worn plastic. There was something fun about reading the covers of films he’d seen dozens of times, just to find out which still-frames were deemed worthy of a feature.
Luna arrived last, a wicker basket of storybooks in hand. She didn’t have children, and didn’t plan to, but she enjoyed giving Harry and Ron a hand-- especially on the first play-date of the season. Often, it was just Harry, Ron, Teddy, and Rose (and, recently, Hugo), but on lucky, wild, stressful days, they got the whole crew.
The end was anticlimactic. It took Draco several moments to realize he had won. Chest heaving, he let his balls drop one by one, the knock of wood hitting wood echoing briefly around him. He stared at them, shaking off the shock of returning to reality.
“Home?” Harry askes.
had been stolen away. Survivor was something that he loved and that Harry tolerated, so why did he suddenly feel so incredibly inadequate?
Harry smirks. His eyes say he’s having a little too much fun, and it’s pissing Draco off. “No… the nursery is Muggle, and we can’t just carry everything while we apparate.”
Harry doesn’t know what time it is, but the sun is down. It might have been on it’s way to rising again; It might have just set. It didn’t matter much; he wouldn’t be sleeping regardless. Instead, he paces-- up one hallway, down another, in uneven meandering circles. A hundred yards past it, he realizes that he had climbed the stairs with the trick step and had avoided it automatically.
“Jones,” he said, keeping his nose pointed at the ground and avoiding eye-contact-- the man had made it crystal clear he had very little respect for Draco. “You can’t predict what Jessie will do. She’s proven how volatile she can be. But you can trust Harry, Iz, and I. We’ve got no power in the minority. Use us.”
want to imagine me in tights, wouldn’t you.”
Harry rolls his eyes, because he can, and, really, he’s having more fun now than he has in a long time. Ron and Hermione are back at Grimmauld, not asleep, certainly, but likely too tired to go looking for him. He wonders what they’d say about the conversation he’s having right now. “What an awfully muggle thing to say,” he tells Malfoy.
Harry whimpered helplessly, lips rising to meet Draco’s and tongue licking into his mouth. The production staff looked at each other, setting their cameras with red lights blinking and making themselves scarce. With a snap of Draco's fingers, two of the cameras turned off, the others turning slightly so they only captured the back of the wicker settee.
Draco
“You shouldn’t have,” Harry whispers, burying his nose into Draco’s hair.
There is the gratitude you have for a hero and the gratitude you have for friends, family members (as long as they are not people like my father) and partners. The latter one is the category of gratitude that I feel for you. If my feelings about you are a big bouquet, gratitude is but one blossom, and there are so many more.
himself?”
“Flip over,” he says finally, throat too thick for his words.
The post-coital bliss was short-lived, as the rain had begun to fall in heavy droplets. Forgoing an Impervious Charm, Draco took Harry’s hand and apparated them back within a few hundred feet of the water well. Unable to risk being away from camp for any more time, especially in such unpleasant weather, they trudged back to camp, deciding that sleep would likely be hard to come by and that, with everyone up, they wouldn’t be tracking any Rai stones for at least another day. Their trip was not going as planned, but it turned out it wasn’t shaping up to be all that bad either.
Note: This fic contains multiple characters in law enforcement, some wizarding and some muggle. The reason I included these characters is because Survivor frequently features these professions. I understand, however, that law enforcement, especially in the United States, perpetuates and contributes to systematic oppression and racism, and that cannot be ignored, even in this context. Black Lives Matter, folks.
“Oh my god! It’s the auction!” Draco whisper-shouted into Harry’s ear.
“So you like it?” Draco asks.
Plus, that way I’ll be all alone with Granger in a resort-hotel,” Pansy had begged. They had decided not to invite both Ron and Hermione, figuring someone needed to stay home with the kids. Harry had not been in favour of Pansy’s suggestions, but Draco needed Hermione to be his guest so they could speak about the project, so Harry had gotten vetoed.
“You’ve got to be right about the donut hole in the stones,” Draco muttered, lost in his own head. “It felt like Stonehenge in there, like the cave was holding the magic in and concentrating it. But it didn’t need any spells to draw up the magic, and the Rai stones don’t have charms either. It must be something in the rock itself that stores the magic and pulls it to the surface.”
Harry waved his hand dismissively. “They’re not that oblivious,” he muttered. “But everyone knows you're too smart to let a little budding romance affect your game. I think they pity me. We’ll be fine.”
Draco’s fly has already been mostly unzipped to make room for Harry’s hand, and he pushes his jeans to his ankles the moment they land, palms over Harry’s own on his arse.
“We’re voting for Jessie,” he snapped.
Malfoy is avoiding the question, and he’s not nearly as smooth as he thinks he is. For Harry, though, he’s just smooth enough. “No, hang out with me. Do this whole summer-of-love, befriend the enemy experiment.”
Pansy sounds like a gem. I’d love to meet her sometime-- when she’s not dangling off Ginny’s lap. I’ve seen them thrice in as many months, I don’t think either has said a word that wasn’t not whispered into the other’s ear. They look happy. It’s awfully sweet-- and awfully disgusting.
“Isn’t that a little… unethical?” Harry asked skeptically.
Draco nodded. “Tread carefully, though. There is unstable footing.”
“Malfoy,” he says to the voice in the shadows. Harry can see him now, if he squints. A touch of white blond against the velvet drapings, a sharp cheekbone against the curve of the plush bench-seat. He may have used a Notice-Me-Not, or it may be that Harry is so hyper-aware he has lost the breadth of his perception.
The impact is icy cold and loud and gurgling. His limbs cartwheel on instinct, his eyes squeezed shut but the tips of his fingers grasping at the surface. He comes up spluttering with a smile on his cheeks.
“So,” Jones snapped with intention, “Let’s get this out of the way. Draco, are you a queer?”
“Is that true?” Harry asked, lifting an eyebrow.

BONUS QUESTION! Comment your answers below, and the first to get it right will receive a drabble after reveals.
She hummed. “You seem happy.”
Harry nodded. “He does. Thanks, Hagrid.”
“Yes.”
The curtains for the left stage are drawn, rippling occasionally from the flurry of movement hidden behind. Draco Malfoy closes the doors to the right wings behind him, entering backstage. The white-walled hallways of the studio accompany him around the back of the stage and towards the set. He shares a slap on the back with Seth Meyers as they pass near the Weekend Update office and then greets Kristen Wiig, Jason Sudeikis, and Fred Armisen where they are already lined up on the blocking tape of the left stage, prepping for the skit .
“In this game, I was able to embody all three facets of Survivor: Outwit, Outlast, and Outplay, all without losing sight of my core values or hurting those I cared about. I hope you will consider writing my name down, and I want to say it has been a pleasure playing with you all.”
The intention was to slow down my brain enough that it could no longer trigger my magical field to activate, but not so much that I was unable to function cognitively. The result was that I lost the ability to regulate my energy levels. When I went off the potions, I was either manic, anxious, exhausted, or confused to the point that I couldn’t function. It wasn’t pretty, and withdrawal sucked absolute ass (and not in the sexy way).
Harry picks him up, both hands under his arse so Draco can wrap his legs around his waist. He feels himself being carried towards the sunroom, and he smiles into Harry’s hair, breathing in the familiar scent of rosemary and cayenne and lemon balm.
“Yeah, he’s… great. Really great. Isn’t he, Draco?”
“What was it like growing up here?” he asked, after they had needed to shift with the sun twice. “The Pureblood English are all propriety and parliament and parties and really, really bad ideology.”
Harry swallowed, opening one eye slightly. “What happened?”
Harry blushes. “Yeah, great, just, er--”
“What?
Neville waves away the apology. “No, no, I was just taking a look at your shrubbery. Lovely specimen-- was it here when you bought the place?”
“I don’t get it!’ he exclaimed. “I can feel a magical presence on the stone, but it doesn’t react to the external energy field at all. If it harnessed power from Ley Lines or currents in the Earth, we should be able to feel it connecting to spell magic, but it just isn't! I’ve tried weather charms, banishments, acceleration charms, anything I can think of that transforms the magical atmosphere and
He pulls a schematic from his pocket that he has designed with Neville (Neville’s had been hand drawn, but Draco has gone over it with spells to mark angles and dimensions) and pushes it into the woman’s hand. “I really need someone knowledgeable to go in with the right soil and charmwork, and I think all of the dirt will need to be replaced. I get city run-off, so I’m sure a protective shield will need to be placed, too. I really haven’t done much with the place in the past, and honestly I feel a touch overwhelmed, but--”
“Well, see for yourselves,” Hagrid said, stepping aside to reveal Ichabod, who was sitting on the stone floor beside the stove.
“No, no, no,” Draco slurs. He leans heavily against Harry’s back, covering bespeckled eyes with mud-smeared palms. “Come with me. I have a surprise.”
Strong fingers massage his arse, squeezing as they press towards his hole, and his hips buck, grinding down against Draco’s cock. He is straddled on top, a tendon in his thigh spasming as the tension in his core, in his nerves is pulled ever tighter.
Malfoy spins to face him on his heel, losing his balance and cursing as he catches himself with a hand against sharp scattered stones. With his back to a soaring pane of aquamarine stained glass, his eyes are corn-flower blue.
“Did it rub off on you?” Harry asks. He thinks he knows what Malfoy’s answer will be. He knows he thinks the opposite.
The salt on Draco’s lips tastes like topaz sunsets and apprehension and letting go. The salt on Potter’s lips tastes like possibility. It’s barely a kiss at all-- a happenstance accident in this comedy of errors. Potter freezes, and Draco doesn’t even think before wrapping an arm across Potter’s shoulders and treading water for the both of them.
to dig deeper.”
“Hagrid, as much as we loved your gift to us, we need to give Ichabod back to you,” Draco said, holding out the small travelling tank to Hagrid. “He’s… we don’t think he’s happy with us.”
Draco laughed. “Usually. It won’t be for Jessie. She betrayed every goddamn person on that panel, and she wasn’t even smart about it. If she had done it out of pure malicious genius, maybe, but she had no idea what was happening. Gotta have respect for trying, but she wouldn’t have my vote.”
The cameras stay on Harry’s face, set in a smirk and eyes wide, and the audience laughs in confusion.
He presses a last kiss to Harry’s jaw, feeling warm, sated, and just a little bit naughty.
“I want to work with you,” Draco started. “We have a solid group of young players on this tribe, and I think it would be in our favour to join up. We all are fans of the game, and we almost grew up watching it, so we probably have similar styles and ideas. I think it’s clear to everyone that Doug and Tara just don’t have the same game philosophy.
A whistle in the distance, muted by a hundred feet of cement on all sides, drifts in through Harry’s ears-- in one, out the other. It carries with it a stale breeze, heavy with the dust of the Underground but tinged with a promise of something that was once familiar. He catches a flash of gilded smokestack as the Hogwarts Express leaps towards the landing, screeching in protest against its brakes. It seems as reluctant to stop as Harry is to get on. There is nothing musical about the sound of a locomotive drawing to a halt-- the 1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2 tap loses it’s rhythm, the twirl of the wheels stutters and blurs.
“Looks can be deceiving,” Harry said wisely.
“Who?” Harry asked, blinking in surprise.
“Next?” Harry says. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” The chair screeches on the stone as it’s pushed back. Harry takes a last frantic look behind him and swings open the heavy door. The panic doesn’t retreat from his joints until he has collapsed in the clearing—his clearing, and Malfoy’s clearing. He’s slumped against a tree, fighting to draw air into his lungs. His foot skids through a patch of loose upturned dirt.
I don’t know if I love you. I don’t think I know anything at all. Sometimes, I think my time in the human experience was put on hiatus 4 years ago-- or perhaps even long before that. Every thought and emotion that has crossed my mind since has felt like an illusion. I am terrified of my feelings for you being nothing more than a mirage; a selfish hallucination fabricated to balm my suffering. I don’t trust myself to say anything, even if I mean it, because how could meaning mean anything to me, when I am what I am?
“Are you sure?” Harry asked warily, eyeing the toad who seemed to be staring at him. “Don’t we need all the fancy equipment?”
Day 382
Day 21
Draco’s lips on his skin are intoxicating, his nails combing over Harry’s scalp not nearly enough. “Please. Please. I don’t wanna wait, can’t wait.”
Yours,
The tribes affirmed with a few half-hearted grunts, barely audible over the din of constant rain. Jeff yanked a silver tarp off a lopsided mound in the soggy grass beside him. It stuck for a moment, bogged down by where water had pooled. Underneath were thick blankets and a stack of paisley pillows. Lindsay screamed and Ian gave a little bounce on his toes. Draco caught Isabelle’s eye between shivers.
every year.”
, yes?”
With the charming members of the tribe occupied, external conversation curbed to a halt. Ian sat leaning against the hull of the speedboat, listening along to Harry and Lonnie with mild interest. Isabelle broke the ice stiffly, introducing herself skittishly to the remaining East Coast contestants. Draco flinched at the volume of the response, the man’s coarse Boston drawl grating his nerves. His name, apparently, was Jones, and he was a consultant. Draco wondered what kind.
(See the end of the chapter for
Jones, however, was not content with these odds. He pulled Draco and Isabelle aside. “Jessie was talking to you,” he ground out, his deep-set eyes surrounded by racoon bruises and creased into a permanent frown.
Claire was last. She sat down on a jerry-rigged bench beside the hammock, greeting him with a motherly nod.
“How about me? Do you want to hear about it?”
“Have you been to the Room of Requirement?” Harry asks.
“That’s great!” Harry exclaimed.
“I know,” Harry whispered.
“Yes. She is the other strategic player. I don’t want her to get votes for gameplay that would go to me over Harry. She played fast and hard, but that’s what a lot of people like to see. Plus, she’s different; she’s a young woman who isn’t afraid to show emotion or be genuine, despite the fact that she flipped alliances more times than the Steelers have won the Super Bowl--” (this was an Americanism that Draco was proud to have remembered from his dozens of hours sat in front of the telly trying to learn how to act like he designed airplanes in Tacoma.)-- “I think you should consider voting for her as well. Jessie came from your alliance, and a lot of people, CJ and Tara included, might stick to that. If you want their vote, it’s twice as hard with her sitting next to you.”
“So you’re really just here to vacation? How disappointing,” Potter snarks, but there's a genuine glimmer of let-down in his green eyes that Draco wants to paint over with laughter and open sky.
Draco lands on a bluff overlooking the sea. Daylight has crept its fingers over the stars, but the sun is white and cold.
You know, I usually love when we have Teddy around, but yesterday I just wished to be alone with you. But I guess you realized that when Aunt Andie picked Teddy up and I ripped your clothes off as soon as they had Flooed away.
“Where I feel the strategies differ is in execution. When one operates on instinct, they lose the ability to plan ahead and, therefore, to understand which ideas fit with their overall gameplay. This can hurt socially, strategically, and emotionally. Because I maintained a logical awareness of myself and others, I was able to better grasp the consequences of my actions.”
I was raised middle class in Sacramento. It’s a cess-pool of a city, but there was a small magical school there. My graduating class was 15 kids, but we’d visit the school up north in Okanagen every few weeks to merge lessons. We even had field trips to Ilvermorny. It was isolated, but I’m grateful for it. I left the magical world for a while after graduating. I think after 17 years my universe just felt so small, so I moved to San Diego and studied sociology.
Harry is forced to squeeze his eyes shut as neon goo squirts onto his face. A shower of pink glitter follows. The audience gasps before breaking into raucous screams. Harry licks his lips, and Fred and Jason leap back, shaking their legs wildly where some of the viscous bright green, purple, blue, yellow, orange, and red substance has splattered.
Harry slows, his toes skimming the dewy grass. “Do you want me to tell you?”
Behind the sheet, Bill picks up a modified squirt gun, counting down from three on his fingers. The cameras once again zero in on Harry..
The challenge was a maze. One partner was the caller while the other was blindfolded and spun around a stick. Jeff said it was a true test of communication, and Draco sent Harry and Pansy a prayer or two. They would need it.
“There are two ways we can do this,” Draco said. “First, we could let it go to firemaking and really, truly cheat for the first time since we got here. Second, we could make an honest attempt at convincing Claire to get out Jessie.”
Harry Apparates them straight to their bedroom, tongue down Draco’s throat and a hand shoved into his trousers to get one finger on the wand holstered to his thigh.
“They were cut from quarries in Palau. They brought the Ley Lines with them!” Harry added.
“You can hold him and I’ll enlarge the tank,” Draco said, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth as he turned to Harry once more.
“No, no. Ichabod is fine,” Harry said hastily. “I’m sure I’ll get used to it. Right, is this cave okay for him?”
Draco,
I want to help you. I would want to help you if you were anybody, but even ten times more than that, I want to help you. It’s painful how harshly you speak about yourself, and how you suggest that you should be “dissected”. I can imagine with all the trauma you went through that you may feel separated from yourself, but no matter how broken you may feel, you deserve the best treatment and help available.I promise you I will do all I can, and I believe it will not need to feel like a dissection or an invasion of your magic or mind. Such a proceeding would do more harm than good. The treatment will look more like a gradual entanglement of the strands of magic in your core in order to find the best way to handle the unstableness.
His pail filled slowly, and then a little bit faster as he learned the motions, only to slow again as he grew increasingly winded. It was a strangely anticlimactic challenge for a final.
They had found another Rai stone a score of miles from their first, and they were meant to be comparing and contrasting the two. Instead, Draco brought them to the mouth of a cool, earthy, stream-eroded cave. He rounded on Harry with a violent sneer.
Harry snorted. “See you tonight,” he said as they parted ways.
“Not a good time?” he asks.
As they approached camp, Harry stopped him, letting his hand linger heavily on Draco’s arm and pressing his finger to his lips. Over the din of morning birds, they could hear a campmate running a confessional down the skinny trail that led to the production tent.
“Yeah, but this is the jungle, and we’re living on rice. It’s a whole different aesthetic. I
Draco,” Potter cut in. “Bloody hell, why did I agree to come on this damn trip. Any other Auror could have come, but somehow I’m stuck here for a month babysitting.”
“I mean technically,” Harry replied, “our work is done. I don’t need to be here. I wouldn’t mind checking out Ponderosa.”
“I haven’t felt like myself for a week. And if I haven’t felt like myself now, then I guess before had to be—I don’t know—not that. Maybe this is the human condition; reconciling the horror and the joy and meeting in the middle where there’s a needle in a haystack labelled ‘who we are.’”
Draco looks him up and down with a satisfied smirk. The effect he is having on Harry-- it shows.
“I’m fine,” Draco mumbled. “Get off me.”
Draco smiles, eyebrow raised and grin slightly lopsided in a not-so-accidental smirk. “Who knew exhibitionsim got you off like this. We could have tried it sooner.”
“Will I? I only know chakive--tchoo--er--Tchaikovsky.”
Draco was the first one to finish his gear configuration. Racing down the stairs three at a time, arms braced on the railing, he landed feet-first at the base of his platform. The water in his well had been dyed a chalky purple, and he dunked his bucket to fill it. Eying his target, he aimed and thrust the bucket of water forward with a short jerk, watching as the water sailed left of the elevator pail and splashed against the muddy ground. He sighed. This was going to take some practice.
“Not yet, I suppose. I was waiting for you to let on some sort of plan.”
Their new buffs were purple, which Draco found a little bit silly. Blue and red made purple, not orange and green, but the tribe was far too relieved for semantics. Isabelle pulled her old buff off her torso so fast her bikini slipped.
He throws himself into the first dark cabin he finds. With the curtain shut, it is quiet except for the hum of the engine. Even that is too loud, too overwhelming. It fills him up until his skin feels tight.
Malfoy hums in understanding, glancing down at his hands. Harry notices that the cuticle around Malfoy’s thumb is bleeding. “I was angry. Knowing you don’t even remember-- I don’t know if that makes it worse.”
“God, yes. Food. I
“Do you not?”
However, when it came time to make a fire for dinner, Draco’s day began to angle downhill. Firstly, it was bloody hot outside. The air was thick and cloying with the promise of tropical rain and Draco’s whole body felt sticky and tight. Making things inconceivably worse was that Potter insisted upon walking around shirtless, which did nothing to cool Draco down. His tawny skin quite literally glistened. It was disgustingly obscene.
Harry looked at him, green eyes crossed and straining. “Ugh indeed.”
“Welcome to your final Tribal Council,” Jeff commenced. “Harry, Claire, Draco--” he nodded to each of them in turn-- “you will have your chance to plead your case to the Jury. Jury, the floor will then be opened for each of you to ask questions. The night will end when you cast your final vote towards who you think deserves to be this season’s Sole Survivor.”
He quirks his lips in half a chuckle. “Friends, I guess.”
Incidentally, the most appealing activities after spending 40 days and nights in the boonies all involved beds: sleeping in beds, eating in beds, lounging in beds, reading in beds, and, yes, partaking in some very well earned, very satisfying shagging with one's extremely gorgeous, extremely lucky husband (in a bed).
They went to the site of the Rai stone, but they didn’t make much progress. Neither party was particularly invested in the task. The stone wasn’t reacting to magic, but Draco had deduced a spell that allowed him to inspect its core signature.
Draco sighed, knowing a losing battle when he saw one. Harry would be asleep in moments, and he could go back to his anxious musing. He would need the practice time. Harry, on the other hand, was always better on the fly. Despite his insecurities, Draco had all confidence he could roll off the cot bedraggled and hungover and still blow the Jury to Mars.
“Oh my… have you lost your mind? You, who hated every single Care of Magical Creatures lesson we ever had at school, actually
Uncertainty flitted across Harry’s face, turning down his jaw and causing his eye to dance from one side of the room to the other. “I am deeply interested in people. As a police officer, I wanted to meet others from all different walks of life in unfamiliar and uncomfortable situations and interact with them. I feel I went through a lot of emotional growth during this game, and I enjoyed challenging myself physically, emotionally, and socially.”
“Draco,” Harry whispers. “
If you believe emotional counseling would benefit me, I am happy to accept the referral to Dr. Bullstode’s office. However, if emotional upheaval will hinder the process of healing my magic, I think it might be best to consolidate my treatments. I may be repressed from my feelings, but I understand myself enough to know that spreading my treatment across several doctors will not be productive. I am an all-or-nothing person, and my magical, physiological, and psychological being tends to be inseparably tangled. If you are going to treat me for magical ailments, you likely should be present for my counseling appointments as well. Unfortunately for me, I think you are correct in the deduction that it is all interconnected.
! Ron, how did that end up in the kids box! We might as well show ‘em a war documentary and follow it up with kinky erotica! Great movie, though.”
“Come on then,” Harry said. “We’d better get home. I’ve got a ton of marking to do.”
“I’d like to play this for Jessie,” he proclaimed, stride assured and steady.
“My rod-riding strategy is much more efficient than yours. You look like you forgot your pointe shoes. Remember, keep your weight over your box, Potter, else your metatarsals will sprain.”
“And?”
The reading of names had everyone’s teeth on edge. The room was dark and a light drizzle slicked Jeff Probst’s hair to his ears. The fire cast unpredictable shadows around the room, sliding into the hollows of cheekbones and collars and making everyone look slightly skeletal. The first ballot read ‘Draco’ in block letters, the second ‘Doug’ in cursive.
“Oh, no, well… yes. But nothing bad,” Hagrid said. “You’d better come in.”
Draco rolled his eyes as the bell rang. “Right, I’ll see you at the end of the day. I’ve got some first years to scare now.”
Draco grinned. “Yes it could,” he agreed. “We need proof, but that can wait. They’ll be months in the lab and presentations and theses--”
The end! Hope you enjoyed!
Draco pauses, a frown catching his lips. He wonders when he started to identify himself in that category. Beneath him, Harry flashes a knowing smirk.
Draco bathed while Harry ate, and then vice-versa. It maximized the amount of time they got to spend talking. When Harry stepped out from behind the cubicle, towel slung low on his hips and biceps flexing as he ran his hands through the dripping curls at the nape of his neck, Draco nearly passed out.
“A bit, yes,” Harry replied. “But we’re colleagues now. We can’t keep calling her Professor.”
Someone beside him grins lasciviously. “I love it when they bring the novies in. There’s always something fresh.” Harry frowns at the ground, ignoring him, and dashes towards the stage in search of Draco. The need to touch is back; he wants privacy, and perhaps to be allowed just a touch of possessiveness.
Harry, on the other hand, was not so graceful. The dish was a spider, and Harry
“Alright, alright,” Harry says. “We’re going out.”
Malfoy laughs, low and loud. “How was I meant to say no? Besides, I was curious. I’ve been trying to get your attention for years.”
He was lying on his back on the only sunny strip of what was otherwise a dismally shady beach. He swatted sand flies off his ankles irritably. The old camp never had sand flies.
I’m looking forward to seeing you after work.
Draco shakes his head languidly, Harry’s chest so broad and warm, his touch so gentle. He is so tired, his magic so sapped. “Garden,” he murmurs, eyes falling shut. “Look at the garden.”
I hope that we can get to know each other-- I cannot let this relationship be built on obligation. You do not owe me anything. Nobody owes me anything. The world doesn’t work like that; we just think it does. If you feel you have a debt to pay, visit the cemetery. I’m done letting gratitude and guilt and idolization and all the rest of the damn roses and thorns by any other name rule my interactions.
A charged particle enters a magnetic field at a constant rate. There are no forces on it besides that of the magnetic field. What happens to the particle?
Malfoy freezes mid-step. “I tortured here.”
The nursery is a sea of possibilities-- thousands of trees and shrubs and hanging baskets, no two the same. A koi blows bubbles from a nearby tank of water lilies. Draco could get lost here. He wanders the uneven rows as he waits for Harry, looping through the same displays of rhododendrons and daphnes over and over again. He gets particularly attached to a lone variegated hellebore that must have been put back in the wrong place, and when Harry eventually finds him, he begs Harry to buy it.
The Rai stone was about four feet in height. Its surface was unpolished, and an intricate weave of spider webs, pitcher plants, and orchids had taken up residence in the open ring at the center. It was beautiful. It also had no magical presence at all.
Desdemona likes her charm. She flies in circles around the sunroom to watch it reflect pink and gold against the glass. It is quite amusing. Thank you so much; you have gifted us with a small joy in a very large, empty house.
“You reach your magic that far into the ground, it might never come back. You're exhausted. Back off. Please, Darling.”
Harry kicks his legs, propelling him into the air on a jerry-rigged wooden swing. The lush, silvery birch leaves of the branch that bears his weight flutter in the golden afternoon sun.
house now, Harry. I love you-- and that means I love that you love your hobbies. There’s room for both of us. I wish you’d just talked to me.”
“You too,” Harry whispered back.
With that, the curtains close.
“I want to check right over there,” she said, pointing towards a ledge that jutted out beside her head. She took one step up and felt around with a hand. Frustrated, she raised to her tippy-toes, smearing her other foot on a pointy jib for leverage. Pulling quickly with her other arm, she managed a desperate sweep of the back of the hollow. As she did so, the rubber sole of her shoe slipped, and she let out a short, high yelp. Her hand, the final remaining point of contact, held on for a heart-stopping second, but the abrasive edges of the rock cut into her palm, and she let go instinctually.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t think so. He’s been very comfortable in here. I don’t think it’s a very active species, so if we make this bigger and give him some enrichment, he’ll be fine.”
Draco made a face. “Well, yes. As we were… you know, getting down to it… Ichabod appeared.”
Malfoy’s forehead is furrowed so tight that the rain has begun to gather between the knits. In his palm, slick and shiny and freckled with mud, is a garnet stone. The dam in Harry crumbles.
Draco forced a smirk to his face, the strain of it on the sunburnt skin around his mouth causing a thousand tiny needles to poke his cheeks. “Like I said, Jeff, just stretching.” He yawned exaggeratedly to prove his point.
Harry eyed Draco’s ribs with a dubious frown. “
Hagrid had an anxious smile on his face that looked ready to burst into a wide grin at any moment, and Harry didn’t have the heart to disappoint him.
“He was a hero,” Harry says. “He loved my mother.”
He rings the bell on the counter twice before a bored looking woman in overalls appears from a side door, a pair of utility gloves sticking out of her pocket. She brushes back her hair with a hand, frowning at Draco’s tailored potioneer’s robes. “Anythin’ I can help you with?”
Harry winks. “I’d hoped.”
“I’ll go for the advantage. You need to eat,” Draco said quietly, sidling closer to Harry and appearing as nonchalant as possible. He didn’t want it to look like they were sharing anything more than idle small talk; Lonnie may have been both lovingly familiar with Harry and a fantastic read on people, but the fact that they had broadcasted any signals at all was a red flag.
“You look sublime,” Draco says, casting cleaning charms over them both.
While I was able to wean myself off of the potions over several grueling months, my magic only worsened. This is when my magical core truly took on a mind of its own, much like an Obscurus, and was the start of my difficulties with eating and my violent magical outbreaks while sleeping.
Mr. Potter, if anyone deserves happiness and good magical health, it is you. You gave your everything for a society that used you as a means to an end. I will do all I can to help you, and I wish I could do more than just this.
Harry jumps, less from surprise and more from habit.
Draco whooped aloud. “You were right all along! Look at that.” He untied the twine with shaky fingers, letting it unravel. When the velvety white petal of a magnolia flower landed atop his head, he laughed, leaving it there out of sheer, playful joy.
Malfoy looks up, frown set on his angular mouth. “I thought it was destroyed.”
I have some problems like that, too. Recently, a delivery man from the Owl Emporium brought me a new supply of owl treats for Artemisia, and the poor sod used the same aftershave potion as my Uncle Rodolphus. My magic went rogue, striking sparks in the poor bloke’s direction and giving him a fright.
The spell required a complex pattern of neat flicks and swirls, and Draco practiced a few times before motioning for Harry to step back, enunciating the spell in a loud, crisp voice. A deafening buzz surrounded them immediately, layers of melodies reverberating off each other and penetrating Draco’s brain until he could feel them in his pulse.
The words of your letter made its strange behaviour clearer to me. Sometimes when a witch or a wizard has an emotionally charged interaction with an item, the item absorbs a piece of their magic and being. It is usually too weak to be perceived by anyone who does not have a strong connection to you - unless the witch or wizard who sent it are as powerful as you.
This something happened upon arrival for the Day 21 morning Reward Challenge. Rather than large constructions of green and orange, eleven neat, multi-coloured structures lined the edge of a clear-cut gap in the jungle. Draco’s nerves bunched; not only was the merge about to happen, but there would be a challenge, and likely a vote, immediately after. First impressions were going to be everything.
Draco nodded again. “I don’t think he’s going to be eating the plants anyway. If we stick to ferns, it should be alright.”
She pointed to her leg, where diluted blood ran down over her knee, each drop a tributary of a much larger stream. The wound was wide and shallow, the kind one would get from falling on asphalt; the kind that, unless treated, tended to get very, very infected.
It was not until the following year that my magic began to go into overdrive. It started as a slow progression in my ability to master wandless or wordless incantations but evolved over several months into bouts of accidental magic.
All at once, a horde of production assistants leap into action, dragging the host backstage for a quick-change. Draco Malfoy, 4th season returning cast member and first-year head writer, is already in costume. His white-blond hair has been covered by a shoulder-length brown wig, and he wears a pin-stripe button-down untucked and unbuttoned down to his solar plexus. The trousers are patchwork, waist low and crotch lower, loose but cinching just above the lacing of black combat boots. It’s a look.
They don’t leave until closing, the sun low and orange over the sloping grassy hills. “Give me the receipt,” Draco says. “I want to write down the address.
“It’s grieving because the people are grieving. The people are what give it magic.”
“Okay,” he agreed. ‘We try to win Marissa with strategy and Tara with, I don’t know, fucking hugs and cookies. I’ll talk to Harry about it and we’ll make a plan. Jessie and Lonnie can go after Tara. They’re cool. If we can convince them to be nice to her, she’ll feel good about herself.”
Draco just smirked. “You’re on your own, babe.”
“Well, ain’t you gon try it?” Hagrid asks expectantly. “It’a new recipe. Just fo’ ya’.” Guilt claws deep in Harry’s gut. He’s been a lot of things, but he’s never been apathetic. He’s never resented Hagrid. He stares at his lap.
You write about running through mountain trails and sleeping under the stars. I guess I’m not as  powerful as you are - I’ve never dared to Apparate that far - but I have spent a few nights under the stars in the Scottish Highlands with a warming charm after a long walk to clear my head. I’ve always dreamed of sharing the view with someone. The alps are probably even more splendid…
Draco dashes into frame from a curtained booth in the corner of the stage. An apron has been tied around his waist, the black linen dotted with electric blues and yellows. A bit of fluorescent orange has made its way to his cheek.
“Necco Wafers. Oh, and Takis. And oysters and marionberry ice cream”
He thought for a moment. “Rocks. Definitely rocks.”
The magical energy that I interact with must be transformed into something, and often that something is something I am unable to control; the impact that I have on the physical and magical landscapes I touch is often destructive.
“More holes?” Harry said flippantly.
It was a successful reward.
The speedboat picked them up in the early afternoon, dropping the tribe on a gloomy, inconspicuous beach on the north-facing side of a small island. On the trek inland, the rough trail disintegrated under their feet as rain carved a path through the center, the ground entirely saturated.
Fred and Jason look duly horrified. “I really hope she does
Draco sighed. “Oh, don’t remind me, so do I. See you tomorrow, Hagrid.”
Draco cast his Patronus into the warm night air, sending his heron soaring above the trees. A moment later, Harry stepped out from around a bush, a grin on his face and hand hidden behind his back. He must have Apparated several meters away so he could make a grand entrance.
Ball five was where things got even trickier. It was almost impossible to space the balls out, and what had once been a steady, melodic, catch-drop-turn-catch-drop was now a frenzy. Draco no longer had time to keep pace with his tapping fingers. Instead, he honed his attention on each ball as it dropped down the chute, the click of the junction alerting him to how long he had until another began to fall. It was an exercise in muscle memory, but Draco’s muscles had always been fast learners.
“I guess that’s why I got so upset,” Harry muses. “Because I cared. Because it was real.”
“It’ll be fine,” Draco said, carefully lifting the lid off the tank. “He looks harmless.”
It came down to a drawing of straws; two short and one long. Jones picked first, fingers twitching as he deliberated. It took half a minute, but when he did choose, his hand shot out, precise and dangerous with the neuroticism of prey and severity of a hunter.
In your case, I believe the curse sensed your fear of your magic and of losing those you care about. To get to you, it released a deadly spell on me, in the hopes you would blame yourself for my death and hold you in a state of self-loathing and grief. These curses-- the ones that emotionally manipulate and drive their target’s towards emotional collapse, are some of the worst forms of torture I have ever encountered.
Harry hugged Draco closer. “I’ve tried to think of everything to save him, but it seems like a lost cause. I don’t like endings. Or losing.”
). He snaps his fingers, and all clothing disappears.
He leapt into Harry’s arms, wrapping his hands around his lower back and dragging them towards the sofa. Spinning them around, he forced Harry down and backwards, straddling his lap and diving to devour his mouth. The towel slipped off in the ferality of his movements.
One or two people nodded stiffly.
That evening, after dinner, Harry and Draco made a quick trip back home to collect Ichabod’s terrarium before carrying it carefully down to Hagrid’s hut.
“What the
“For once in my life,” Harry says, “I don’t think I care.”
“And that’s better?”
Harry’s face splits in a grin. “Great! Then we’re on the same page.”
She’s got two ginger spawn to prove it,” Draco had retorted.
“No, thanks,” Harry said quickly. “We can’t stay for long. Hagrid… ”
Harry groans.
“If I wanted to steal a wand and run, I’d have done so already, Potter. I’m irresistibly charming-- haven’t you noticed? In fact, I’m insulted you think, if I were to rob someone, I’d be dumb enough to rob you. You’re disgustingly famous.”
“Heyoo,” he says. “I hope you guys are enjoying the gallery! I was just about to start a demonstration, if one of you would like to volunteer to join me?”
“Oh, of course he was,” Hagrid said quickly. “You two looked after him really well, but he just needed more space and freedom. He can have that here, so he showed his true self.”
“Fifth vote: Tara. Sixth vote: Isabelle. Will not count. That’s four, that’s enough. Tara, bring me your torch.
Potter stands 30 feet up, motionless in the morning mist. He deliberates (
“Of course,” Draco says, a little too loud, but when Harry rises to his knees, Draco stops him with a frantic hand. “Actually, can we do your place? There’s construction outside today.”
Fred Armisen clears his throat. “Wow, aren’t these cool! I heard the artist was nominated for an award!” He points to a series of neon splatter paintings hung on a brick wall. Kristen, Fred, Jason, and Harry lean in for a closer look.
“Oh, you can’t possibly still be upset about this morning,” Potter quipped after a moment of studying Draco’s face.
“A bit warmer than we would have for native toads, maybe?” Harry suggested. “I’m not convinced he’s a native species. He doesn’t look anything like the toad that Neville had.”
Draco fucks him through it with increasingly incoherent praise. He isn’t particularly rough, but the strings of expletives that fall from his mouth and the stuttering of his hips in response to Harry’s blissed-out moans convey a different, rarer sort of urgency.
“I love Survivor. I am a student of the game, and my greatest inspirations are those who were able to seamlessly play to their personal strengths and maintain control over their own destiny until the very end. I played smart, consistently, and efficiently from the beginning, and, although I never lead a majority alliance, I never once let my actions, relationships, or performance be manipulated or become irrational.
I am also exhausted. My magic has consumed me, burning everything around it with volatile ferocity. As you probably know as you have far more academic knowledge  than I do, the First Law of Thermodynamics can have dire consequences.
He shook his head. “No, I’d rather be alone.”
” Draco said coldly, enunciating his vowels. “Go back to camp. I can handle this today.” He tossed Harry’s wand at his feet, spinning on his toes and Disapparating to Harry’s ‘buts’ and pleads of ‘darling, wait.’
Draco was actually quite pleased with that answer.
“Death is cunning. That’s what you’re meant to think.”
Draco nodded emphatically. “That must be why the ancient peoples went through the trouble of transporting them. They weren’t tools, they were a
“Aughhh! What the…” Fred squeals.
I have never heard of Robert Service before, but his poems are beautiful. The Oscar Wilde book is exactly the one my ex never returned to me after our breakup, and that I never got around to buying it again. It’s a funny bit of irony that you were the one to gift me this book again. I’m sorry if I’m being unclear. I think I’m getting a bit drowsy and have stopped making sense.
“Maybe this was where the homes were? Rai stones were usually only where the chiefs lived,” Draco speculated.
Pushing Malfoy against the banister of the highest moving staircase in the castle feels like the most natural thing in the world. Kissing him feels like something he’s done before. The 7th floor corridor falls away beneath them. The 8th is miles up in the sky. Malfoy tastes like green ginger. The magic in the air smells a bit like champagne. Hogwarts always did have a sense of humour.
Malfoy wrinkles his nose. “That one has shit swings. They squeak. We’re going towards the river-- I know a spot where the chains are so long that, if you pump your legs high enough, you can look over the whole city. Plus, the slide gets really fast when it rains.”
I had Hermione go back and collect as many papers as she could, once I was no longer in the room to pump 2000 watts through anything she touched. I will mail them to you tomorrow; there is no need for you to come and get them. In fact, I’d rather you didn’t.
“Win, obviously,” Draco drawled with a wicked smirk, his proper British pronunciations polishing his words.
I will not pretend that I am coming to you in cold rationality; this, to me, is deeply personal. However, I urge you not to see it that way. My body and my soul are a magical anomaly. In short, I am a puzzle that I believe you could find considerable fulfillment in solving.
Jones refused to respond.
The lack of melodrama made Draco nervous. A comfortable game did not make for good TV, and something was bound to give.
Malfoy shrugs. “The kids screamed anyway. They always screamed.”
The entire way home, he and Draco pre-occupied themselves by silently glaring into each other’s frowns. If conversations were occurring around them, neither noticed. It was quite pathetic, and exactly why Draco had fallen in love in the first place.
So I have a sneaking suspicion I know who Prongs is…
The camp had acquired a comfortable camaraderie in the six days since they had last been to a Tribal Council. Chores were delegated appropriately, and everyone seemed content to wallow in their hunger and discomfort. The outlier was Jones, who never lost the paranoid glint in his eyes and the air that he could
I will be by your side in this. You can count on me. I wouldn’t pass up a chance to look into your emerald eyes.
I didn’t know if you would ever say it back. I would forever have accepted giving my love and getting your time and your trust in return, but your love is a dream come true.
“Technically,” Draco said, “We only need to flip one person to force a tie, and at this point, it can barely be considered flipping. You will be our biggest asset, because, although
“Close?” she asked. He nodded vaguely, lips in a flat line as if to say ‘asi asi.’
“I’m scrawny and feeble. My stomach’s caving in. I can’t grow facial hair, just a weird translucent goatee.
He finished with a wistful smile. “I hope that helped, Ben.”
Draco cringed. Yikes.
Harry dropped next. He was incomparably sharp and quick, and performed brilliantly under pressure, but he lacked the organization and foresight to excel in this sort of mental challenge. Draco’s pet name for him was ‘tornado.’
Tara was out seconds into the second phase of the challenge, which tracked, given how scatterbrained she was. Meanwhile,  Draco, lost in his own world, felt the bare bones of resentment in the back of his mind. Later he decided it was because he hadn’t wanted her to be the first to touch the food.
“I’m sure,” Neville replies.
“There’s nowhere to hide anything here. I really don’t think so. We can check back later,” Draco argued.
She gave him an appraising glance. “You sure.”
The towels Draco had bought for their upstairs bathroom were robin-egg blue, and they matched the rich, cheerful colour of the sky through the window. Harry dressed himself in an outfit as distinctly opposite from his professor robes as he could find within his closet: a pair of slate-grey jeans that Draco had made him buy from a mall in Madrid and a charity-shop football jersey. He felt handsome, happy, and free.
Draco followed her to the mouth of the narrow murky creek that skirted the camp. Rolling up the hems of his shorts, he waded in, figuring that it would be easier to go directly than to bushwhack through the thick, prickly weeds along the banks.
Malfoy extracts himself from Harry’s arms, inspecting the floor behind him with a knit in his brow before his face explodes into riotous laughter.
“Probably,” Draco replied coolly.
Taking a deep reassuring breath, Draco gunned it, jumping onto the unstable bridge with shaky feet. He heard more than felt himself hit the water, his body careening sideways as the cylinder spun under his feet. He came up spluttering, coughing to clear the harsh salt-water from his windpipe. He gasped desperately for a moment, his frantic limbs thrashing to keep him afloat.
and mashed his face into the pillow. The buzzing in his brain was abundantly clear; there was no way in Merlin’s Green Earth he was falling back asleep.
“We should go for flint and tarps first. Everything seems to be secured with ropes, so we should choose the people who are best with knots to collect items. Someone faster and smaller can switch to attacking the other tribe after the first minute. We should also have two people guard our mat. What do people want to do?”
Harry excused them to the group, claiming that they were bored and wanted to hunt for fruit trees.
Ichabod just gazed at them.
?” Pansy exclaimed with exaggerated indignance. Harry grimaced and whispered something in her ear.
“Perfect,” Draco says. “I was wondering if you could come over after work. I wanted to show you something.” Ron’s freckled face pops out from behind a corner, and he flashes Draco a thumbs up, waggling his eyebrows. Draco’s really going to need to talk to Neville about the definition of a ‘secret’.
No-- it’s--” Draco stammers, wincing when a grinding thump sounds from the yard. “Um, no, this is fine.”
It was collectively decided that Draco would be the one to attack the orange tribe, and he was pleased. Rather than specifically ask for the role, he had successfully made everyone else think it was their idea first. It felt like a win; Draco had been giddily looking forward to practicing his wiles.
we could get out of here.”
After the insanity of Jones’s final Tribal, the alliances had shaken into rough twosomes of Draco and Isabelle along with CJ and Jessie. At the previous vote, CJ had been sent to the jury with a four to two majority, and Claire, lost without the guidance of Jones, had been taken under Harry’s guiding wing.
Draco’s mouth fell open in awe and he pushed away from Harry to get a better look. “When did you find this!” he exclaimed, and Harry, hands still around Draco’s waist, shrugged, donning that crooked smile that made Draco weak at the knees.
“Very thoughtful of you,” Draco smiled as he straightened up again. “He’ll fit right in, don’t you worry.”
you caught me.”
The spells dissipated abruptly, and it took several moments before the ringing in Draco’s ears and flashing in his retinas faded. He wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist and squeezed the polished Hawthorne of his wand in his fist. Taking a deep breath, he recalled the sensation of touching the periwinkle mist and apparated them away.
“That,” Draco states, “sounds like a euphemism.”
“If we didn’t do something, one of us – probably me – would have been seriously hurt,” Harry replied. “I know I had a weird feeling about him right from the start, but I didn’t think he’d actually try and hurt one of us.”
“Draco,” Harry said.
“Oh, for a visit? He’ll enjoy that,” Hagrid said with a smile. “Can I get you some tea?”
Hermione stood beside Draco, beaming. “I’m honestly thrilled.
Harry had dropped them in the middle of the woods. The day prior, he had Apparated to a well trafficked Apparition site in Koror, having done a specified tracking spell so he knew where to go. From there, he had used a spell similar to the one he and Draco had used at the start of their trip to find the most concentrated, most powerful magical signature in 50 miles. That place, apparently, was here.
Jessie did end up getting her treat with an elaborately shrouded tray Jeff held up reverently with both hands. When it turned out to be white rice and cow tongue, a wave of second hand anguish wracked Draco (he was back on speaking terms with Jessie; at the prior night’s tribal, she had flipped
A notebook slaps against the hardwood as it is dropped to the side, and Draco feels strong arms flip him onto his back. He stretches his arms above his head. “Planning to show me how much?”
Unfortunately for Harry, it wasn’t very long before his suspicions were confirmed. Three weeks after Hagrid had proudly presented them with the toad, he and Draco had visited Pansy at home. Draco had insisted on taking Ichabod along for a change of scenery.
“I don’t even know what to do with you. This is a gym. My friends man the front-desk. I come every day after work.”
The third day of summer hols were sunny and bright. Harry woke to late morning bird song and church bells, the sheets cool and soothing beneath him. Draco had long since left for work, but Harry had no such obligation. For three months, there’d be no more asking McGonagall for weekends off, no more begging Draco to spend the night at Hogwarts for more than just two workdays, even though the walk to the Apparition Point in Hogsmeade was more than a mile. No more stacks of grading or cranky first years or leaving Molly’s Sunday supper early; school was out. Harry rolled and stretched with a contented sigh, nearly crushing their sleeping cat. He gave her a conciliatory scratch, earning himself a soft purr; even she was in a good mood.
He shook Harry awake while Claire laid out the food and set the skillet to heat. “Rise and shine, love,” he whispered.
Draco signed, heavy and solemn, leaning back in the sand with lead-filled limbs. “I know. She’s been talking about getting rid of you, too. She’s not wrong, but, well, extraneous circumstances.”
“Oh. I-- nevermind.”
Draco kisses the frown from Harry’s face, deep and long. It feels like when his fingers close over the top of the wall, like when his legs swing out in the heart-stopping moment when he’s not sure if he’s going to hold a dyno, like the second before he rolls to his back after falling.
“Fix this hallway? Potter, I go to Azkaban if I don’t.”
Draco studied the gears. There were five different types of parts: large gears, medium gears, small gears, spacers, and shafts that could be secured to the wall and slid into the centre-holes of the other pieces. If he placed a large gear and a small gear on each shaft and then lined them up with the first small gear connecting to the handle and the first large gear connecting to the second small gear, he would maximize the ratio of handle turns to pulley movement.
Draco winks, takes a running start, and jumps into the ocean. His heart leaps into his throat and his hair streams behind, tugging his wits away from his brain. For a moment, he is weightless; then, all at once,
,” Draco tutted. “Honestly, Harry, I really don’t think he’s anything other than a regular toad.”
Evidently, it was not fine. Tribal Council was long and grueling as CJ gave Jeff an extended breakdown of their very long, not-so-good day. When it came time to read votes, one curly-cue script with the word ‘Marissa’ scrawled within a cloud of hearts caught Draco’s eye.
You are lying in bed, looking gorgeous, and I’m so happy I can’t sleep. I want to dance, I want to shout my happiness from the rooftops. I’ve never in my life been so happy, not even when I was a child and got my first broom! They say most people are never again as happy as in childhood, but you gave me a happiness that is so much more than anything I have ever felt.
“You can do that bit,” Harry said firmly. “I’ll sort the habitat out.”
“I don’t have time for you to throw a pity party! I have work to do,” he said to Harry’s back.
Today, they are hosting a summer barbeque, and it will be the first time all of their friends have been at their shared home at the same time. Luna shows up unfashionably-early, as usual, carrying a suspicious bundle of home-grown carrots and tomatoes. Draco thinks they may be writhing.
The challenge was a partner one, which meant each player and their loved one would be working together on the challenge.
“It makes you feel like you’re not you.”
And then I ruined my chances of a friendship with you by insulting people who were your friends. I ruined my chance to be your friend back then, but I could get your attention by being your "nemesis". What a prat I was!
“It’s a floodplain. Gets covered up in the rainy season, dry in the summer. Could winter mean death and spring mean life or something?” Isabelle said.
Draco’s lip turns up-- he is so, so hopelessly gone for this boy, awkwardness and all. “Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.”
Kristen watches with rapt fascination. “What vision,” she whispers.
Harry swallows and sighs. “Trust me, I know.” He places his wand in Draco’s open hand, looping his fingers tight around Draco’s wrist and securing them together with a spell.
Draco,
In the bed closest to the house, Harry keeps his collection of magical plants. A couple of them are confined to magically sealed cages, lest they get up and walk away. When Draco chose a spot for his favourite hellebore, he made sure to plant it as far away as possible from the
“You like it?” Draco says. He doesn’t hide the hint of satisfaction.
Day 17
This brings me to the topic of emotions. Leaving them out of the equation would jeopardize the whole process, as emotions constantly fuel magic. Like (as Muggle science has found out) a photon is both a wave and a particle, so magic is both acting from emotions and energy. That is also why children often experience accidental magic usage for the first time during a temper tantrum.
“How did they carve out of
“We should turn it down!” Harry yells between lyrics. “Someone’ll complain to the RA.”
Harry shrugged. “So what are we going to do?”
spiders. He would always call Draco into the bathroom to collect them from the shower, and Draco, cup and cardstock in hand, would find him naked and shivering in the corner muttering about ‘Hagrid’ and ‘Mosag’ and ‘that fucking Anglia.’
Grabbing the pale skeletal branches that rose from the water, he climbed gingerly onto the dead tree, placing one foot in front of the other and making sure to avoid stepping on places where time or moss had polished the wood to a slip-n-slide. He inched upwards, swinging his knees on either side and locking his ankles behind him when the angle got too steep to walk. Using his hands to leverage himself, he worked his way into the crevice where the two trunks met.
“We stick with our plan? Or go for him?” Harry asked.
Malfoy’s head snaps up, a deer in the headlights. He opens his mouth, but Harry is too far to hear what he has stammered. Harry clenches and then unclenches his fists, off time with the march of his feet towards Malfoy.
He leans over the railing of the Astronomy Tower, eyes on the fuzzy treetops that distort the horizon. Hogwarts is the only place where dawn and twilight look the same; slate and periwinkle with wisps of mauve and clementine. The open, the close; they taste the same.
He frowned. “That’s… oddly flattering that they think I’m that good. And I’m better at puzzles than Iz. It’s not my fault that beating people up is part of her job description.”
He laughed, short and loud. “I mean, I’m sleep deprived, I’m starving, and my grip on reality is rapidly slipping away, but I’ve got my work and my husband. This game is so bloody cool. It’s, like, once in a lifetime.”
tell her professor about this,” Fred mutters.
Harry summons his holly wand from the holster at his thigh with a snap of his fingers, holding it just out of reach. “The Wizengamot would say this is an astronomically bad idea.”
“Harry, if we're going to do this, you have to mean it. It can’t be a game, a rebellious bend to the dark side to spite whatever bullshit expected of you. You have to promise. You have to promise you’re serious,” Draco tells him at dawn.
“No, I suppose not,” Draco sighed. “Alright. Well, Ichabod, we won’t be too late home and we’ll bring you some food. Hopefully.”
You do that, though; you remind me.
“We are?” Claire asked.
“Yes?” Malfoy replies. His voice is closer than expected-- despite the trick blocks, they are making good time.
“HUH?” he yelled.
Day 14
To manipulate another person’s dreams and to prey on their fears was cruel, and the Harry Draco knew was never cruel. They were thirty-- five years too old to call that sort of behavior honour. He had seen far too much to excuse suffering. He needed time to think and time to forgive.
Draco fought a growl of frustration. “No, that's okay. Harry’s waiting for me, and we only need two people.”
“This
Needless to say, he did not take well to the test. Retching audibly, he stepped back from the table and cast a fleeting look at Draco, green eyes so big the whites were visible below the irises. He was up against a very smarmy-looking 40-something woman whose intimidating persona was marred only by the splotches of mud and sweat on her navy blazer. She smiled seedily at Harry’s hesitation, and Draco just could not keep his mouth shut any longer.
need to eat”
“But you said yourself the stone’s signature doesn’t match the environment. What if the magic isn’t channeling magic from underground, what if it’s from the stone itself.
Jeff eyed them with perplexed enjoyment, his forehead knit in befuddlement. “Draco showing his first sign of discomfort, sparking a bit of a catfight.”
“You hate starfruit,” Harry commented, screwing his nose up for emphasis.
Harry took the rope from a panting Isabelle, moving the ball from hand to hand to gauge its weight. Eying the target on the raft floating 15 feet ahead, he squinted through his contacts (Draco much preferred the glasses) and made an underhand toss, narrowly missing with a heavy clunk of metal on wood.
He had likely been wandering in circles, like Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Woods, for half an hour when he almost tripped over a protrusion on the ground. At first, he thought it was a root, but upon closer inspection, yellowy lichen and dappled limestone peeked out from beneath decades of woven vines.
Potter. Remember, we get voted out, we have to leave, and it’s going to be me saving your arse then. Your job is to help me work; my job is to keep us here. We make a good team.”
He shook his head. “No, no. I’m sorry. You hit a sensitive subject. I should probably get up anyway. Let’s go for a walk?”
My mother may sound stern, but that's just a mask to hide her tender side. She is fierce, but mainly just because she’s caring fiercely. Be yourself, and you will be in her good book. In fact, you are in her good book without having to do anything. You gave me a second chance.
Harry checks over his shoulder, recognizing the man from earlier. He rolls his eyes. “He’s eying you up.”
P.P.S George brought me some non-explosive candy this weekend, and I wondered if you would like any. I hope I haven’t been monopolizing your leisure time, but if so, perhaps a few small luxuries can act as a consolation prize.
Draco hadn’t seen it either, and he didn’t remember moving it. Also, there was the slight issue that the living room smelled overwhelmingly of sandalwood, teak, and pine.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Ian yelled. “No one was supposed to take the fishing spears without me.”
etched onto it with untidy magic.
“Fine, fine,” Harry agreed flippantly. “It’s just been nice to, you know, not
His arms land on either side of Harry’s face. His lips are red and swollen from being kissed and bitten and the sharp tendons of his neck are stark and strained. His head is thrown back in ecstasy, but his emerald eyes are wide open. Draco takes a moment to just stare-- even if he could look away, he wouldn't.
Neville laughs, hand on his belly as he doubles over. “Trust me,” he says. “You’ve still got plenty to do.” Draco has the niggling sensation that he’s being mocked.
Draco sighs, jaw set. He is going to have to switch tactics. “Fine,” he says. “I’m willing to pay whatever.”
Jones glared. “Yes.”
Harry was staring at the side of Draco’s head incredulously, wishing desperately that he could kick him in the shin without being seen.
“What do we do, then?” Harry asked.
Draco grit his teeth. “It
“Still slurring,” Draco drawls. “Anyway, I’ve never actually tried it.”
He shook his head, “Nope, I’m just a corrupted empath.”
Please, forgive me if I read too much into it. I will be fine if you just want to be friends.
Harry gasped and grabbed Draco's arm.
Draco made a slashing motion at his throat. “No. Iz. Gotta be.”
They re-voted, this time for only Jones or Harry, and Jones was offed unanimously in the most wild, most unpredictable Tribal Council yet. As his torch was snuffed, Draco gave him a wave and a nasty grin. For once, there was nothing Jones could do in response
Life, in general, was good. Survivor had been an adventure, an alternate reality where they had been deconstructed to their most base instincts and ideals, but it had also been particularly unsustainable. A game show, a research project, and a marriage were too many plotlines for even Draco’s rather sophisticated mind to keep track off. Fucking and getting fucked was much more fun.
“Like
Harry blinked slowly, squeezing his eyes closed again as they registered the blinding white light that surrounded him.
On the second try, though, he was successful, the ball dropping into a slot at the end of a steel ring as Harry gently tugged on the rope. Springing into action, the tribe gripped it, pulling on Harry’s command and dragging the rafts closer together. As they drifted towards collision, Harry leapt from one to the other, rocketing across a cylindrical spinning beam and skidding safely to the other side.
“For the entirety of the game, I made an effort to get to know and understand everyone I met, while, at the same time, maintaining a constant core alliance. I feel I was the unifying force between the people I worked with, and I grew to care for all of them deeply.
Harry’s voice cracks on the high note, and Draco giggles until tears run down his cheeks and gather in his dimples.
He was a million dollars richer, surrounded by friends he adored, and beside the husband that he loved; his Survivor journey had wrapped with a very neat, very happy ending.
Day 37
Harry snapped his fingers in front of Draco’s face. “Laptop down, honey.”

Dear Harry,
“Well, just be careful with him,” Harry said warily, watching as Ichabod made his way over to the side of his tank and placed one foot up on the glass.
would reveal that he has cast the same spell on the same ruins-- on the same crumbling wall of the same crumbing castle-- a hundred times. He keeps forgetting what he’s already done, and it frustrates him to tears. The uselessness and the inaction pounds nails into the depths of his insecurity, and a part of him hopes it doesn’t get better, that the outside continues to reflect the in; that it’s what he deserves. In a moment of clarity, he wonders if a dementor kissed him in his sleep. Even that thought, though, floats into the hidden folds of his brain, until all he can remember of it is a looming shadow.
If you agree to give my secretary your Floo address, I will have her send you several testing items with instructions. They are a bit heavier than what your owl ought to carry. The tests are simple charms and transfigurations you have to cast on the items and then send them back through the Floo.
Their heads careen towards the deck of a balcony, and Malfoy grips his hand. In the second before impact, they flip upside down, twirling away, and Harry whoops. They were never in any danger at all. And if they were-- well, there’s a freedom in that, too.

, because that was 9 months ago. Nine months, and Harry had failed to ask what
“Figure-four or Lay-back?” Draco asks. His hair flops over his face, mussed by calloused fingers and exposing a violently purple mark already blooming beneath his ear. His words tickle the rough skin of Harry’s jaw, left hand exploring the expanse of golden chest but right still cupping his cheek.
Draco was walking along the beach looking for Tara (and wondering if perhaps Lonnie had murdered her and hidden the body) when he stumbled within hearing range of Jones, Tara, and the three original East Tribe members Draco had yet to speak to: the burly man with the pronounced NJ drawl, whose name was Ben, the fit man, CJ, that Draco had learned managed a gym in Miami, and a plump DC house-wife called Claire.
“I make lists for plants. I’m gonna take another day off and go to that nursery by Southampton on Tuesday. Can you come? I need to take a closer look at the light exposure and charms, but I think I’ve got some ideas.”
It turns out that gardens require an infuriatingly specific set of parameters, and Draco writes them down until his hand cramps. Special soil, raised beds, charms to manage water flow, angles of sun exposure, walkways-- the list goes on. Sighing, he stretches out his fingers and grabs another scrap of parchment.
Jeff squinted. “That was quick. Draco, please come forward. Would you like to share why you chose him?”
The party is loud, throngs of people crowding into a tiny house, and Harry flirts with the boy behind the bar to get them doubles. “I’ve only ever had champagne,” Draco says. Harry laughs, downing his.
Like planned, Doug tried to take charge. His idea was to pair the slow diggers with the slow runners. Draco thought this was silly.
Additionally, in order to manifest a force that causes magic to activate, a wizard must input energy of their own. Thus, as my body is a shorted wire between magical charges, I am entirely depleted.
“Puh-lease.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Jones is due to start turning on his own alliance. He doesn’t give a shit about the weaklings on the bottom. Come on, I hear BLTs and a shower calling my name.”
Draco
Harry laughs. “You’re fucking crazy.” He plants a sloppy kiss on Draco’s forehead.
“They’re going for something big tonight,” Lonnie cut in, quickly and quietly. “Who?”
“Not today,” Harry says. He opens his eyes.
This chapter contains some darker themes. Content warning for brief homophobia, nightmares, and mention of past trauma and mental/physical/magical health issues.
“It’s sexy to kiss.”
Draco asked Harry, Isabelle, Lindsay, Marissa, and Ian to meet him at the water well. He hoped they were ready for the speech he had prepared; Harry had been buttering them up for days, and Draco had been sure to give Marissa words of encouragement during the challenge, but he was still worried it would be too much too soon. The problem was that time was running short, and if Draco were to flip the alliances, he would have to do it soon.
“Just hop in,” Harry coaxes. “It’ll be fun!”
He is still so very tired, and so very in love, and for a few fleeting moments, he wonders if he’s going to fall asleep while inside, if they ever get there. But then Harry’s hot, insistent lips meet his, and his hand trails to cup an arse cheek on its own accord, and it’s fucking bliss.
“We should try to pull Marissa and Tara back in--” Draco cut her off with a childish whine “-- I know, Tara’s a piece of work, but I think Marissa will budge if we can convince her we have the numbers. She’s the type to prioritize self preservation, and she hasn’t ever been in camp with Jones; she won’t know that he’s a flipper. We were on good terms with her before the split, I think we may have a sway.”
Draco Malfoy
Draco stopped in the trail and crossed his arms, making a noise that could only be described as a ‘harumph.’ “It’s not a
. I want to pick love or meaning or happiness or whatever bullshit, but I don’t have it in me.”
He shoves through the crowd, colliding head-long with a dancer at the base of the stairs, and he man lets out a surprised grunt as his arms are forced around Harry’s shoulders. Draco appears from behind the curtain, cup of water in one hand and still slightly out of breath. His laughter is bright and exhilarated between pants. “Unhand my husband, Jordan,” he snickers.
Harry humphed. He was holding himself up on four toes splayed painfully against the pole. “Usually when people say they stretched with a rod between their legs, they mean something entirely different.”
Draco reaches for a sip of water and spills the glass over the desk. “Shit, that’s my chem book,” he says.
She winked. “That I am.”
What else could I have done?” A clump of mud fell onto Harry’s shoulder, and his brown skin blended into the grey of the background.
Also, I’m very glad to hear that you did not in fact date Jonas. He was a real prick, and deserving of almost no one. We only went on, like, 3 dates, and none of them were nice. Honestly, the sex wasn’t great either. Marginally better, maybe. You’d think the (ahem) experience would have given him an edge, but apparently not. I don’t know, though-- maybe I was the one who was bad. That whole situation was a cluster, but it was sort of nice to have regular-people problems for once.
This work is part of "Lights, Camera, Drarry" (LCDrarry), a film-, TV- and theatre-inspired Drarry fest.
Harry laughed. “It’s been, like, a week. Did someone spike you with amortentia?”

Day 1
“I think I just got 30% stupider,” Draco replied.
Harry glares, but only for a moment. “Figure-four, then lay-back. Wanna see you.” He drops to his front, chest pressed to the ground and muscular back arched spectacularly to push his arse in the air. Draco pulls Harry’s shorts over the curves of his body, running his hands back up his thighs when the garment gets stuck at his spread knees.
“I know. Come on, let’s have an early night,” Harry said, wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist and giving him a squeeze.
“I went exploring the other day,” he said, walking Draco towards a fallen log with sure backward steps, despite the uneven footing. He sat down, pulling Draco onto his lap and running his hands up and down his bare back. “Do you know how bloody crazy it's been making me, seeing you walk around like this and not being able to touch. Merlin, you are stunning. It’s not fucking fair to have a mind and a body so equally fucking
“It’s not going to be that high. Come down!” Draco yelled back, cupping his hands to his face in hopes the wind wouldn’t whisk his voice out of range.
Draco
I don’t know if I love you, but I know this: I think you're smart, and sincere, and gorgeous, and compassionate, and when I’m not thinking about that, I still can’t get you out of my head. I think you are the strongest person I have ever met. I think that I admire you, but not in a cold, marble-sculpture way, but as a person, who I want to trust forever, and I want to watch fall apart, and I want to hold, and I want to hold me.
“I thought the game was over,” he asked softly, pouting and leaning into Draco’s hand.
Content Warning for mentions of self-harm and discussion of ADHD.
Harry nodded softly. “Only if you come with me.”
Harry gasps. “You tore out your grass.”
“Do you feel anything dark in the air?” he asked as they neared the stone. Harry tended to be acutely aware of magic. If the wizarding 6th sense was like smell, Harry would be a bloodhound.
Jones’s nostrils flared suspiciously. “Liar,” he hissed.
He was laid out in the sand alongside a clothesline that dripped a steady metronome of white noise onto a piece of driftwood. His hair was covered with the turquoise-green of his buff, and he thought the colour rather suited his eyes.
“Harry, this is our last day. What are we building? Tell me what we’re building.”
When Draco wakes up, the room is pitch black save for a golden orb of light above the opposite side of the bed. He wriggles towards it and sighs when his hands find Harry’s ribcage.
He grimaced. “Yep,” he mumbled, turning his back to his husband and swimming for the dock he started on. Pulling himself up and onto his side, he staggered to his feet as both Isabelle and Ian made it safely across. Hell, even Tara succeeded first try. Drenched and dejected with the sour weight of humiliation in the pit of his stomach, Draco did his best to dry his shoes and wound himself up to go again. Harry held out his hand, and, letting go of the rope that kept the rafts connected, he stepped onto the obstacle for the second time. Using quick, light steps, he dashed from one side to the other, breathing a sigh of relief when his feet hit the softly bobbing planks of the other side. Harry gave him a reassuring smile, but Draco just shook his head; the obstacle wasn’t difficult; he had just psyched himself out and cost his tribe precious seconds. It was only the first challenge, and he felt he had already painted a massive, garish target on his back.
“If you say so,” Harry said as Draco jumped to pluck a plump green fruit from the tree. He took a bite straight from the side, coughing and spitting it out before swallowing thickly. Harry gave him an I-told-you-so eye roll.
He was getting close, but so was Harry.
“Alright, if you insist. How do you want to do this? We can’t enlarge it with him inside,” Harry replied, still gazing at the toad with mild disgust etched on his face.
brain damage?”
“So it was purely self interest, then?”
“No, now that you mention it, he doesn't, does he?” Draco mused, gazing at Ichabod for a moment before shrugging. “Oh well. I’ll just make it slightly balmy for now. We may have to visit the library when we get back to the school.”
Currently, they were researching Rai stones, large, donut-shaped limestone sculptures that were mined, carved, and treasured by the native inhabitants of the Yap Islands. Since they had been made on the islands for hundreds of years, Draco was curious to study what magical influences they had. Mostly, though, Draco was curious to see if he could find an excuse to be on Survivor, and still call it work.
to be competitive for a few years of my life.”
Neville cuts him off. “Draco, if you buy all of Harry’s plants for him, I promise he will hex you.”
Harry heaved an uncomfortable breath, choking back frustrated sobs. “I
Harry took a step backwards, holding onto Draco’s arm as Ichabod looked at them.
“I mean, it could just as well be tied to the seafloor, or up a tree, or that stupid fucking medalion marking Tree-Mail,” he said drily.
“Hmm? C’ni come?” The sleepy murmurs nearly melted Draco’s heart.
Harry groans, swiveling his hips up and grinding. Draco can feel the hard weight of his cock between their stomachs. His thighs burn in effort, the mats beneath him unforgiving, and sweat drips into his lashes. He thrusts harder, faster.
Deciding it wasn’t worth the risk so early in the game, Harry and Draco opted not to sneak out of camp until at least after the first Tribal Council. Unfortunately for Draco, he was finding it increasingly difficult to pretend he didn’t want Harry’s attention. The prat was popular and gorgeous, and he always had a pack of surfer bros and pretty women trailing after him. One girl in particular never left Harry alone. Her name was Lindsay, and Draco hated her nearly as much as Tara. She had long bimbo-y hair and big bimbo-y breasts, and she was always giggling at whatever Harry said. Harry seemed to find it amusing, but Draco did not at all.
Neville has brought a ‘
Harry cheeks burn with a magenta flush. “Yeah, but you don’t just show up to a bloke’s house with a forest and a moving van. And you’ve never really seemed to like them, anyway.”
for you on my wand. If you cast vibrations, it makes notes. I got the idea from the magical signature spell. I’m arse at music, but I thought you’d appreciate it,” he had said to the ground.
“Sorry,” Draco says. “It’s just me. If someone’s there, I can call back.”
“Welcome to the Survivor Auction!” Jeff announced with an excess of gusto impressive for even him. “You guys know the drill. There are wallets on the table with $500 for each of you. You may bid on any item at any time. Some items will be revealed, while some will remain covered. Once you have placed your bids, the deal is final. Are you ready to get started?”
“No-- I don’t know. I just-- I thought I was so smart, you know? How am I supposed to be perfect? How?! But I have to be, and I never thought it would be this hard, and I’m so tired--”
“It won't be too, like, frat-boy-y, right?” Draco asks, apprehensive.
“So,” Harry said. “There are Rai stones on this island?”
Draco’s Apparition is smooth and tidy, but even the symmetrical acceleration forces Harry’s eyes closed, the pleasant buzz of alcohol in his blood turning queasy. He stumbles on the landing, jerking Draco’s arm forward awkwardly. Draco jostles into his side, and Harry’s reflexes respond just a moment too late. The ground approaches, slow and spinning, and it’s not until he’s flat on his back with Draco pinned on top of him that Harry no longer feels like he’s watching in a dream from above.
“Oh come on, that was a long time ago. I’m much better around the creatures now,” Draco said, waving his hand. “Give me the tank. He’ll be alright in my office for the rest of the afternoon, then we can get him home and set up a nice terrarium for him.”
“No, these are good ideas,” Isabelle said. Draco hated that he had forced her to work damage control. “Both Ian and I have experience in the water. We should dive, If that’s okay with everyone. Does anyone want to volunteer for other roles?”
My offer is this: to provide you with myself and my magic for the purpose of studying, without limitations or ulterior constraints. I am willing to remove my emotions and my desires from this interaction as much as I am able.
“Have you ever heard of the Deathly Hallows, Malfoy? The Tale of the Three Brothers? It’s a gift from Death. It’s a trick.”
“Thanks for asking if I was okay,” Harry groused.
The fit man dropped soon after. He had lasted longer than expected-- Draco had assumed he was a meathead-- but, with a body like that, he likely had an image to uphold that kept him going. Or perhaps there was more to him than met the eye. Draco didn’t really care; he just tried his best not to sneak a look at the bloke’s retreating behind as he trudged towards the loser’s table.
“Do you have anyone?” Lonnie asked.
The winnings were a private brunch overlooking the ocean. Draco scarfed down pancakes and mimosas until Hermione cut him off. “You’ll make yourself sick,” she said. “You haven’t been eating enough.” She pulled a pastry from his grasp and assessed his body with a concerned frown. He gave a pained groan.
The tension in the room melted away, and Harry put a hand on Draco’s arm. The only person who hadn’t flipped was Marissa. He supposed they would worry about her later.
“D’you like him?”
Harry laughs a bitter bark that he feels in his spine. ”Goodnight.”
“I found something!” he said, “It doesn’t feel as powerful as I expected, but we got one that hasn’t been museum-hopping since the British came in and stole the place.”
“Some would say so,” Malfoy says. “In a structured, entitled sort of way.”
“We’ve got a great night planned for you, so stick around!” a dark haired, bespeckled man shouts from center stage. “I’m gonna let you in on a secret,” he continues. “I went to secondary school with one of the cast members here, and one of the skits you’ll see tonight-- and I’m not going to tell you which one-- might have some truth to it. Panic! at the Disco is here, everyone! I’m so thrilled to be hosting SNL, and we’ll be right back after the break!”
see him as an outsider. I know the guy; he’s smart and tough as nails, but when he gets upset, he gets controlling.” The longer Harry spoke, the faster and louder his voice got.
“Should we even try to keep the six together? Or is Jones too much of a wild card to bet on?” Draco whispered to Iz on the boat ride back to their old camp. They were being given 30 minutes to pack all personal items and supplies before waving their goodbyes and joining the rest of the contestants at the original East Coast beach.
She looked at him. “Mmhm. Now we just add sunshine and water to make them grow.”
Draco huffs. “Fine, fine. But
Jeff sized him up skeptically. “Well, you sure are good at it.”
Draco struggled to remain inattentive; it was easy to zone out Tara’s words because they were utter gibberish anyway, but her voice was so bloody

I really appreciate you stating outright that you enjoy my company. I have come to enjoy yours as well. I tend to be a little oblivious and assume the worst-- at least that’s what Hermione told me yesterday, but I can tell that your beliefs have changed fundamentally. It gives me hope. The world is a cruel, cruel place. I had stopped believing that it was possible to learn who we were.
Sincerely,
He shrugged. “I haven’t-- I mean. It worries me, you losing weight. I don’t want it to take you back to anywhere bad.”
Draco turned, eager for the game to officially commence. A shrewd-looking woman of around 30 stepped forward, assessing all eight other players with a sharp up-down glance before speaking.
Malfoy hesitates, leaning back on his heel as he watches. “I wonder if it’s possible to see all of a person at once?”
And he is. For one, Harry Potter doesn’t ask if he can follow Draco to Tenerife, he just sort of tags along. Draco decides that, if Potter wants to fly through the night from Lisbon to the Canary Isles, there’s not much he can do to stop him. Letting it happen feels nice. It feels like progress. It shouldn't-- Potter is a reminder of a past he’s been evading, a past that’s been chasing his tail as close and precise as Potter is now. Right now, though, he’s not running; he’s leading.
