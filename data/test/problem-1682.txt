Naturally, I couldn’t keep my mouth shut forever. We got close to the end of the year, and I knew he’d be leaving. I got panicky, desperate, and I started hinting at seeing him outside of school or on holidays. The kind of things a boyfriend would want. He hit me again, and then a few more times because I was crying, and then he left. He wouldn’t have anything to do with me for the rest of the year.
Draco sat still, thunderstruck and silent. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he gulped and took a breath, and the sighed and nodded.
I mentioned other obstacles. As we’ve grown closer, others have noticed. It was one sort of matter when I was an unwanted suitor who would never be considered…it became another matter when he made me his constant companion, his public partner in the eyes of others. His friends decidedly disapprove of me. The Weasel and Granger have viewed me with scorn for as long as we’ve walked these halls, but that scorn has turned more dangerous…into open threats if Harry’s well being isn’t guarded with care. As far as they are concerned, I can only bring harm, never happiness. They aren’t wrong…but I want them to be.
“I’d prefer them made in the next day or two. Tomorrow if you can, the day after if you can’t. You can see me first thing in the morning as soon as you have them done. It’s very quiet here and I’ve plenty of time to go over them with you. Now…about your counseling with me.”
“You should ditch the tart, Blaise. You can do better. Lots better. Who knows? When we get the chance, show me if you’ve still got what it takes to keep me, and maybe a change of address is worth my while.”
“Okay. Let’s say that was true. All that aside, I am Professor Weasley or Sir to you, and don’t address me casually. Don’t forget that you’re a student on probation, and not a staff member! Just because you’ll assist me, it doesn’t mean that you’re a teacher of any kind. Now, I’ll take your challenge. I want you to walk the length of the bookshelf on the left, reading the titles in silence as you go, then turn your back and recite them to me in the order you read them. Do it.”
Draco stared into a the mirror on the wall and withdrew a comb, then brushed his hair back neatly and threw on his coat.
That was the state of things for many long years, with Draco gaining fame for his publishings after years of research and study beside Hermione, ultimately breaking away on his own to lecture periodically and to publish even more frequently than she did. His experiments were far larger in scope than her own, and while she worked in theoreticals, Draco worked in advancing what could be tested adequately and proved to work. His modest income from books and speaking was unneeded, since the Malfoy fortune covered all needs he could even contemplate, far into the future, so at Harry's suggestion Draco endowed the earnings into a charitable trust and issued grants for research to witches and wizards who could meet the criteria. It was a well received gesture, but he wasn't especially interested in fame.
The backside of Draco Malfoy possessed no flaw. His blond hair was slicked back and reached to just below his shoulders. Lean muscles played beneath the surface of his back while he scrubbed his chest with a washcloth. His skin was like unmarred porcelain…like ivory…like something precious and beautiful that was meant to be handled with the greatest possible delicacy.
It was about then that I figured it out, dancing around his moods, showing enough constant contempt to keep him from sniffing out my desire for him. You have to live with someone before you can really know them, and I got to know him well enough to see something truly amiss. It nagged at me, in the back of my head, that his responses were always so different than anyone else might have been. He never showed the slightest bit of sexual excitement. You know what I mean...blushing virgin I'm not...so I'm used to seeing people who share my tastes show some interest in it, and not just a smile. It isn't always about orgasm, but there's usually some hint of sexual lust or need in every person looking for a partner. It's often buried or sublimated by a need for stimulation other than boring old pleasure, but it's there...just not in him.
“I’d like to ask for something else. My therapist has been insisting on giving me ‘homework’. Things I’m supposed to work on whenever I can. I’d like it if…like it very much if you’d sit here with me. I want to hold you…right now, just for awhile. Never really done much of that before, except…after…you know. I’d like to start getting comfortable with that first, and there isn’t anyone else I want to hold.”
Harry smirked mildly. Ron had changed very little over the years, even though he was a bit beefier than he'd been in school and his hair was just beginning to thin a bit at the temples. He'd spent almost seven years playing professional Quidditch for the Chudley Cannons, and even though he'd spent his first four years on the second string and changed positions three times, he'd stuck at it until he'd had a good season all around. After leading the league in his final year as a Keeper, Ron accepted the Flight Instruction and Quidditch Referee slot at Hogwarts and retired from professional Quidditch almost instantly. It was largely because it would have been hard to follow up with a second year as good as that last one, and Ron had really wanted to be remembered at his best. Quidditch was a young person's game, and at twenty-four, Ron hadn't had all that many good seasons left. He'd proven himself in every way he needed to, and that was good enough for him.
"Where did you learn so much, O Savior Of The Wizarding World? You know I hate it when you sound all-wise and all-knowing. I appreciate it just the same, but it still rankles."
“Doctor Snape, this is Drake. He had a little fainting spell, and he hasn’t had the best medical coverage for quite awhile, so I thought it would be a good idea to get him a proper check up by someone that knows what they’re doing. Drake…meet Doctor Snape.”
“It’s supposed to be. I told you I’m okay. I was just…thrown off for a second. I’m alright, Harry. I’m just glad to have you all to myself for a little while.”
Three days. I gave him three days of the best head I could give. He looked at me differently, but he never said anything out of the ordinary. He has to know that I did it because I…I approve of him. He looked like he was measuring me. Weighing me. Not my body…my soul. He didn’t tell me when they would come. My release was moved up without a word to anyone. One day I was a number, and then I’m escorted to the offices, given my clothes and personal effects and allowed to dress, handed my paperwork and led to the exit. I never got to say anything to him. He never said anything. He’s still in that cell, and I’m walking out of the building.
“But not enough to put up with being treated like a convenience. I’m not just a place you get to park your dick for awhile. If you’d let some of those walls down you’d find out what it’s like to have somebody who really wants to be with you. I just don’t think you’ll do that, for me or anyone else. That’s why we’re through. And I don’t think you’re inhuman. Just the opposite actually…I think there’s a part of you somewhere in there that wants something more, but you’re too fucking good at keeping it buried. If you ever dig that part up and let it see daylight, I’d love to be there. Until then, I hope you’re alright, because I don’t like seeing you unhappy…no matter what you may think.“ Harry folded his arms and waited.
Potter closed his eyes for a very long time when he was blinking and Draco had the feeling he did it so he could hold back the tears.
Blaise nodded seemingly disappointed, turned away and listened to the teacher. Draco sighed again. He hated this day.
"Minister, dear jury, I am here to bring arguments against the accusation." Potter said and Draco had to admit, it was very brave of him to say that and especially in
"Ron!" Hermione said in shock, clearly audible for her three friends and two people at another desk.
Then they all grabbed a Coke and walked back to the garden, where Ron put up his chess board and Harry sat down with him to play.
He sighed. This day was absolute shit. Harry wiped his mouth again and stood up. He washed his hands and mouth and threw the bloody towel in the laundry basket. With shaking hands and knees, Harry made his way downstairs to the living room where he lay down on the couch and rested his eyes.
He grunted, put his feet down again and Charlie laughed. "Behave, Arthur." He said and received another annoyed grunt from his father, who then laughed.
"And you must be Vernon. Ah, Harry has told me so much about you.", Draco said, turning to Harry's uncle.
But against all odds, Draco's thoughts drifted off, he yawned, his eyes fell shut and Draco fell asleep.
"Let go of me," Malfoy said and shook his arm, "I'm not someone that just grabs your hand. I can walk on my own."
"Don't you dare to laugh at me, Malfoy. No get out!", she said loudly and glared at Draco. He had never seen her like that.
Now Harry felt his own cheeks redden. Did Malfoy just make him a compliment? And did he actually believe that every witch wanted him and that's why Draco wouldn't stand a chance? Harry smiled softly and bent towards Draco.
Hearing these words from Harry's mouth must have been too much for Malfoy, because he fixed his gaze on the terrace doors behind Harry and didn't answer. Harry looked at him in silence for a short moment and Malfoy got up.
Everything started to spin and get blurry. Draco looked at the bottle, it was almost half empty. He laughed while he cried and coughed.
It was impossible. Why should he? Harry's brain hurt. He screamed into the red pillow and after a while lying there, he cried.
Harry narrowed his eyes, but shrugged unimpressed and made some tea. Ron took Pig and the tiny bird flew out of the window and through the air to the Burrow.
When Potter stood there, Draco kneeling in front of him, Draco was suddenly very aware of the cold. He felt his fingers freezing and just wished for an answer - preferably one that would make him happy. But Potter didn't move. Draco threw a look at the people behind Potter and saw that some of them shrugged, others smiled hopefully and kept taking pictures. And then, finally, Potter nodded. Draco felt his heart jump. Potter was nodding!
After breakfast, Harry and Neville made their way to Transfiguration while Ron waited for Hermione to finish reading.
Harry felt his cheeks burning and his heart racing. His palms got very sweaty and he slowly wiped them at his trousers, hoping Malfoy wouldn't notice. Harry sipped at his beer to cool down and Malfoy sipped at his whiskey.
"Yes.", he said and a lot more students groaned and shoved more money towards Seamus, who grinned widely.
Draco nodded. The elf danced away again. Draco looked up and his heart leapt. Potter entered the kitchens and was immediately surrounded by several house elves.
Potter's eyes looked bigger and greener without his glasses, it made Draco want to kiss them, which was an odd thought, so he quickly shoved it aside.
Draco laughed and it made Harry's heart melt that Ron and Draco are getting along with each other. Only Hermione worried Harry.
"You're as little allowed to do magic outside your freak school as him.", Vernon said with a slight laugh.
As they entered the kitchens, three house elves stormed towards them and greeted both of them happily.
"Um... I took a shower and then I unpacked my stuff. I wrote a letter to Pansy and my mother and I've revised some stuff from sixth year. It was quite a busy day for me." Draco lied and Blaise nodded understanding.
He didn't get any further, because Hermione nudged him in the ribs with her elbow. Ron scowled at her, then put his fork down again and took a deep breath. Harry felt his stomach clench.
"After Mrs Black had died, the house was empty for many years. Before it was used as Headquarters for the Order, no one else was there, except Kreacher the house elf and this horrible portrait.", Potter told him.
"Who am I to judge?" He said chuckling. Harry laughed through his tears. This was as beautiful as he had hoped for it to be.
A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room. Parkinson was clutching Blaise Zabini's arm. Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner. But Draco was no where to be seen. He wasn't too cowardly, was he?
Malfoy followed the healer to Narcissa's room, and Harry watched them vanish inside. He stood in the middle of the hallway and stared at the door. He didn't know if he should be there when Narcissa would get out. Before Harry could make up his mind, the door opened again and Malfoy came back out.
Potter rolled his eyes and Draco did as he was told. He leaned back at the wall, like Potter wanted him to do.
Harry smiled too and agreed. They didn't talk for a while, but Harry noticed Malfoy shifting uncomfortably.
Draco grinned and opened the door of the cupboard. He took a hold of Harry's hand and dragged him along the corridor.
Potter had tried to talk to Draco until this very day. It was Monday and Draco was heading to his classroom, where he found Potter, Weasley and the Mudblood. But Potter didn't jump up to stop Draco and talk to him. Even though Draco waited a few seconds before going out the door after the lesson, Potter didn't look at him. Potter giving up on talking to Draco made him even angrier than he was when Potter annoyed him everywhere. The more Draco hated Potter the more Draco wanted Potter to like him. He was on an emotional rollercoaster.
"That's fabulous," Luna said lightly and clapped slightly, what made everyone turn to her in disbelief.
“No, but you know why you arrest people. I…” Malfoy takes a second to think, perplexed in the arch of his eyebrows. “I think I would like to run things past you, really, see what you think about it all.”
“This is not a joke,” he grounds out. “You’re a monster, coming here with this face when his son is here.”
“Then it would be a shame if I called our friend Mrs Skeeter for an exclusive on how you spend your Friday evenings while your wife is changing diapers. You can assert authority over her, too.”
He knows how the events of the preceding night brought him to wake up on the floor of Draco Malfoy’s bedroom. He wishes that he didn’t, but he remembers with great clarity downing the bitter potion that would ease the fury of the wolf, shedding his clothes off and letting his fur take over. He remembers the panting pain of bones breaking and hair pushing through his skin and the deep loneliness of his wolf, pack animal bereft of companionship. He remembers the chime of a Floo call, and he remembers pushing his muzzle through it and then being sucked into the fireplace and there, there! A human! A friend!
Witches (and Wizards) across the United Kingdom are worried that the boy turned saviour is wearing himself down.
Draco spends a long time staring at this plant, snow covering red-blood flowers like icing sugar. He almost wants to bend and take a bite, only to verify that he is not dreaming and that the bush has thorns that would cut him, make him itch for days with scratches at his chin.
“It’s not necessary to bring him a new one,” Draco tells her, face set in an ugly smirk, “Potter can have mine, I have to go.” He lays his fork toward Harry, purposeful and petty, like it’s a great victory and not ridiculous theatrics.
One morning, no particular to any other in any way, he simply decides to learn wandless magic. It seems like something to do and occupy himself with, so he gets a few books about it from the Black library and settles down in front of the fireplace to study.
“That’s not true. I love my job,” Harry complains. He turns back to David, “It’s called Auror, really, but we’re nothing more than Magical Law Enforcement.”
Arousal is just blooming into his gut, tightening, when Draco pulls away and says apropos of nothing, “I’ve never taken my ring off.”
“I thought it would be too late in the season for snow, but yours look absolutely wonderful. Very fight appropriate.”
Malfoy looks as affected as Harry feels. He opens his mouth and exhales slowly, doesn’t speak for a long moment.
When he does finally take it off, he has to brace himself against the sink, lock his knees in place. He’s not certain about it, but he has the feeling that the mark is bigger now, elongated and curving around his phalanx. He blinks down at it for a long moment.
The wet drag of Harry’s lips is a burn against Draco’s. It blows on the embers sitting quietly in his gut and they flare up in flames, orange of fury and red of lust. He fists the ugly t-shirt Harry always wears and tugs him closer again, feels himself moan when hands press in the burning heat of his body.
“Anyway, I have a photograph from your grandparents’ wedding in one of the rooms at the manor. You look exactly the same, you Potters, from fathers to sons.”
For a long moment, he stands unmovable in the center of his living room, a cup of tea in hand. He’s barefoot, toes rasping against the worn carpet and doesn’t know what to do with this new development. Then the knock rings again across his house and Harry has to do something.
Harry grips his shoulder firmly and pulls a chair out to sit next to him. He doesn’t stop touching him.
Draco sniffs, touches Harry’s arm with his gloved fingers in an intimate greeting, now that he’s done battling his limb into various weather-appropriate contraption. He has a knack for making Harry fall through floors with a touch alone; it always feels more than it actually is. Harry’s skin burns where Draco pressed his knuckles.
“It’s alright, Uncle Harry,” Teddy says mildly, looking a tad overwhelmed by the glittering setting and the hush of the room.
Astoria looks beautifully regal in a blue gown, her chestnut hair gathered in a high ponytail, away from her face. She smiles down at Lily and holds out her hands to accompany the last of her hesitant steps.
Malfoy puts his teacup on the table, folding his hands in his lap. Harry knows that he’s poised for action, careful tension in the line of his shoulders. “Then, I’m the one asking. Where were you?”
They knock; Harry strains to hear beyond the door. He catches the shuffle of feet and braces himself to look polite and invested as the door opens.
Panic makes him dizzy and he bucks against the person holding him down, wand trapped between himself and the grass, uselessly digging in his ribs.
Harry swallows against the knot in his throat, tries to remind himself that he should not be doing what he is doing. He shouldn’t be alone with a Death Eater. He wets his lips; his mouth feels very dry, too.
Draco’s hand wanders from his side to the fingers Harry is resting on the bed, turns around his wrist and continues over his arm. Goosebumps follow it. It stops at his shoulder.
So he’s left wandering through the Manor, looking for family or friends he’s authorized to see. Harry hopes that Hermione has cast a chilling charm somewhere in a room so that he can take a breather. His legs hurt from the running-around he has done all morning long. He never thought that a formality wedding could be this difficult.
Potter-not-Potter only smiles at him, a wide show of his teeth and the crinkle of his eyes, terribly unfamiliar to Draco, only ever seen in pictures. There’s a similar expression on the photograph in one of his guest room. Albus, Draco thinks and feels anger flood his chest, raise the beat of his heart.
The mockery doesn’t escape Draco, but he doesn’t stop to respond beyond a quick thank-you. He’s immediately back in Harry’s room, perched on his bed, leaning over his night-stand. The pen is a sort of self-inking quill and too smooth for his taste, but Draco survives the ordeal. His writing looks splotchy at times, but it feels recognizable enough to assure his friend of his identity.
They shag in the morning and eat an award breakfast next to Erica, Harry’s silent flatmate, then shag again, and once more in the shower. They eat another awkward meal with Tommy this time, and Draco dutifully makes appropriate small talk only to be met with monosyllabic grunted answers. Harry goes to work and Draco tags along and finds himself in the same seat as the day before, drinking the same vile coffee, but feeling ten times more settled. He’s wearing a pair of too short jeans from Harry’s dresser and a shirt that itches at the collar but he cannot find it in himself to be bothered by the lack of fashion. His bones have been rattled around in his body and put back in better, more efficient places and so he doesn’t grimace at the acrid on his tongue or the greasy coating on the table.
Harry tries not to look as bitter as he feels at the idea. He nods and gets out of the car, slinging his backpack on his shoulder. His entire life rattles inside.
His face must do something strange because Harry turns to him and pushes his thumb between his eyebrows, smooths out the wrinkles here.
His father comes to mind. For a brief moment, Draco wonders what he would say of the situation. Probably something unpleasant. He snuffs this line of thoughts in the bud and turns on his back to fall asleep.
“No, Potter… Harry. No. I’m asking that we stop dancing around what we… I’m asking that we to stop using sex as a pretence of seeing each other.”
Harry has hours of Auror training going for him, but he’s drunker than Draco is and so feels the great vibrations of an impact at his jaw, and the pain blooms right after, iron taste following. Harry spits. It looks black in the moonlight.
Life doesn’t change that much. He still wakes up at the crack of dawn with feet in his face (James or Al, depending on the day, never Lily, who sleeps well into the morning if given the occasion.He still blearily makes breakfast for his kids while Ginny is away on training. He still coerces them into their clothes before dropping them off at school.
I cannot say that I trust these Americans, but here we have not once faced a discrimination due to our family name. I believe Scorpius is in good hands. And if that means that I have to endure the noise and singing at every corner of New York City, then I will.
Draco nods stiffly but doesn’t answer; doesn’t think that he can. There’s a weight pressing against his vocal cords, effectively silencing him. The man slithers away and Draco is left shaking, wondering if he’s going to humiliate himself by crying, blubbering in public.
“Alright,” says Ginny, getting up from her seat with some help from Harry’s shoulder. “Let’s round up the kids and go to bed, before we have to roll ourselves through the front door.”
“I take wolfsbane,” he says slowly, gripping the arms of his seat. There’s the hint of claws at his fingers and he takes a fortifying breath to retract them. It doesn’t help; Malfoy is here, very close.
Harry tugs him by the hand, or maybe it’s Draco, and they leave. They apparate, tangled, into one of their rooms (Harry’s, but it’ll take him several hours before he realises it) and they lose grasp of time.
They end up in the living room and Harry has an alarmed moment of flailing before he spells away the mess of the last few days. The mugs accumulated over the week bob happily back to the kitchen.
And Harry cries. But it takes him a long time to tell Ginny that he’s crying in relief. That, he too, isn’t straight.
“Ahh,” he sighs, and smiles, tiny and embarrassed, with the corners of his mouth. Draco swallows against the heat that tightens in his gut. “I guess we’re in luck then.”
“Right.” Malfoy says and puts his messenger back on the couch. He riffles through it for a second before handing the file to Harry. “I have everything here.” He takes a fortifying breath, “I was hoping that you could tell me what you saw at the crime scene.”
Malfoy keeps silent as Harry undresses, tapping away at his smartphone —slick and expensive, like everything in this school. Harry puts his sleep clothes on and stands there in the middle of the room for a long moment.
They stand for a moment with the innuendo; Harry feels the air thicken between them. He has the unyielding desire to lean toward Draco and take a deep breath, see if he smells of distaste. He bites his tongue instead.
Draco blinks heavily and when it doesn’t work, he rubs the sleep out of his eyes with the back of his hand and tries to stitch together a complete sentence. He shakes his head.
“That’s actually why I wanted to talk with you. The intricacies of the Statute of Secrecy do not apply to our case, I’m afraid.”
Draco apparates back to the apparition spot closest to Harry’s apartment, and walks briskly in the dark city, feet floaty and pavement uneven. To sharpen his focus, he has Harry’s keys clenched in his hands all the way until the bedroom. He drops them unceremoniously on the night stand, which rouses Harry and kisses him all over his face, which finishes in waking him up.
Harry feels the tea get stuck in his throat and has to cough it out. He doesn’t spit anything, but Malfoy fixes him with a look that reads, really, what is wrong with you, Potter?
“If you try to climb on the bed at any point during the night, I’ll maim you, Saint Potter the Werewolf or not.”
Around eight pm, Draco has shaken off the worst of the surprise and is slowly making his way to proving his theory.
Harry whines, hears himself distantly, as he pushes against the mattress for more friction, licks at Draco’s skin and tastes the salt of his efforts. Everything smells of want and need and Harry sets his nails in the sheets, pulls to hold himself back, just a little bit longer.
By the next full-moon, almost three months have passed and Harry almost goes into rampant rage when Draco is whisked off under his nose by work for three consecutive days. His footwork is impeccable. He has not stepped on any foot in a month and he just wishes to woo the man he loves into marrying him.
Draco is helpless to tell him what to think; he himself has never been very proficient at it either.
Harry nods and nods again when he quivers, when things don’t feel as sharp, as red in his chest. He moves, hears the strangled breath of Malfoy and his own in unison. Draco’s hands spasm on his thighs and Harry grabs one of them, holds on tight as waves crest in his body, encouraged by the rhythm of his hips.
Harry does so and settles into bed. A weird loneliness presses on him. He vaguely thinks about taking out his own phone, the thin monstrosity Dumbledore got him, but he’s not sure how to operate it smoothly enough to send a message to Hermione without arousing her worries.
Dumbledore’s driver stops the car, and squirms out of the vehicle with great difficulty, almost too big for it. Harry watches him get out blankly, fiddling with a rip in his jeans.
Malfoy looks back at him amused and pushes the door open further in affirmation. Harry takes his coat, and they leave.
He waits all of five seconds before the door opens, and he’s left standing at the gaping entrance of an empty hall. Harry takes an additional five seconds to steel himself and crosses the threshold. He feels the shimmer of wards go over his head.
Andromeda gives him a sympathetic smile, takes a few steps closer until she is standing right next to him and squeezes his arm. He feels comfort seeps into his clothes with her warmth and he wants to cling close, leech on it for the rest of the day. Andromeda gives him a small smile and lets her hand fall to her side.
“You!” he shouts and the intruder pulls the veil away, reveals Potter’s impassive face. “Strip your glamours!”
Wiltshire is one of the most inconvenient places Draco could have chosen to live in. Far from everything, including work, the daily commute through the Floo network is a nightmare. But Draco bears it gracefully for the sole reason of seeing the sun set over the grounds, blazing everything in warm light.
“Just use a fucking spell,” Harry bites and Draco goes away for a second, leaves Harry naked and alone, until he’s back, and he feels the shiver of magic brushing into his flesh, making him relaxed and pliant.
Draco doesn’t hear; or he does, but would swear on his life that he didn’t. That Harry was silent, probably asleep for most of the day. The truth is theirs and theirs only.
“Oh, Potter, we’re not barbarians. The Manor has been fitted to accommodate some technology. I must say that your friend Weasley’s invention, Magikvision, is a great improvement to our home.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry, I’ve seen your cock up close and personal, you can handle calling me by my name.”
His scent dangerously appeals to him. Harry tries to read but the words are swimming in front of him.
Harry hears the clatters and hushed instructions of those who have something to hide and the door opens.
It turns out that British bonding rituals were part of the courting process a few hundred years ago and even if Draco doesn’t have an academic knowledge of them, he has the resources and the need to get things done swiftly. As it is, they read dense paragraphs about love and trust and convoluted sentences that make Harry’s head hurt.
“I used the usual curses and charms in case someone tried to stop me, so don’t forget to remove them. I wrote what I knew about your mother.” They look at each other. “But I could simply tell you about her. Can’t we go somewhere to talk? How can I contact you? My owls always come back to me.”
“I guess it’s healthier to summon me for tea and complaints rather than another ghastly pub night with Weasley,” says Draco with a pretentious tilt to his head, shedding his leather gloves in the pocket of his coat and draping it over his chair in the same movement.
They watch the dragon land, the grooves of Harry’s palm under its talons. The dragon walks around, unsteady with his wings spread, before turning on itself and settling down, head cushioned on Harry’s thumb.
“Of course,” says Dumbledore and Harry doesn’t turn to see him go. He shoulders his dread along with his backpack and drags it inside.
Abigail Murik, 25 years old from Liverpool, Merseyside agrees. “The boy is barely more than skin and bones. He needs a good meal and a long night of sleep. I do not know what that girl Ginny is doing to help him, but it doesn’t seem to be working.”
“You also forgot the most important information.” Draco smiles around the rim of his teacup. “You’re a wizard, Harry.”
“That boy needs some maternal affection,” says Rosedriah Dred, 54 years old, in Rye, East Sussex. “With the dreadful murder of his mum when he was so young, he deserves it! I would give it to him if he stopped by for crumpets. With this war, I haven’t seen my son in a long time. He’s been away in Europe, aiding the Order of the Phoenix from there and he has yet to come back. I’m sure there’s a mess to clean up there too, and my son is very competent with this kind of thing. Anyway, I have plenty of love to give and Harry should come eat my blueberry muffins.”
Chaperones have been arranged to lead the guests to and from the party. No witch or wizard is allowed to walk unaccompanied through the Department.
Harry’s room is a cramped little space, barely enough room for the double bed and the night-stand, but he manoeuvres them both in and closes the door behind Draco.
Harry exhales heavily, rubs his face with the heels of his hands, displacing his glasses. His back aches, nerve endings firing on a loop, making everything twinge along his spine.
“I never really thought about it, I guess.” He steels himself to meet Harry’s eyes. “I just really wanted out,” he adds, more truthfully that he had wanted.
Harry takes Draco’s extended hand and runs his hand on the gold; he takes hold of it, and tugs, gently at first, then more insistently. Draco grunts and hisses.
On the next full moon, Harry is careful. He locks the doors and windows with charms, cuts his floo connection to everyone including himself and goes the extra-step to manually lock himself in his room. There he unwraps the posh and soft paper the potioneer always sends his Wolfsbane potion in and winces through the taste.
Harry listens to the pulse of his heart, high with adrenaline, flight or fight response in his ribcage.
Draco doesn’t quite know what to do with all this new information; he has never known how to deal with emotions or people baring their souls to him. It never happens in his social circle of pureblood inbreds.
He makes a face and turns to Potter. He cannot say a word that his mouth is covered his mouth once more, palm against Draco’s lips.
“Bloody hell, just come here,” he swears as he hooks his thumb under Malfoy’s jaw, in this spot that always makes him rumble with urgency, and tugs him higher. Harry enjoys the weight of him, settling bony and unyielding over him.
Harry spends the next month in a daze, confused by the turn of events and entirely distracted from his former task. He’s discovering with virginal awe the delights of sex and the abundance of it when one has a regular partner. The fact that Malfoy is his regular partner is too much for him to process. He does a good job at ignoring it.
“No?” answers Draco with a bit of an inflection, not sure of what the right response is to this new and pleasant development.
After, they sit around the kitchen table with the kids covering their face in hot chocolate and giggling, exhilarated by the snow fight. Harry steadies an agitated Lily with a hand at her back, as she bangs a rhythm on the table, porcelain escaping her enthusiasm with little jumps on the wooden top.
“Yes. Alright.” He stands, gathers his bag on his shoulder. For a second, he pauses, to look at Harry, watches his face like he’s looking for something. Harry doesn’t know if he finds it.
“I don’t think we have no impact whatsoever on weather.” Harry informs him. Malfoy waves a hand in his direction. “But, yes that’s besides the point. You’re divorcing then?”
Draco gets off his horse and advance on him, pulling his wand of his sheath against his forearm. He casts a strong Revelio in his direction and Potter-not-Potter raises his hands in innocence and waits for the spell to hit him. Nothing happens. Draco doesn’t stop advancing on him, until he has him leaning against the tree, wand at his throat, Draco fuming from the other hand.
“What the… Oh, bloody hell. You think I’m-” He looks Draco up and down, and he tries not to squirm in his seat, tries not to flush under the obvious interest that he sees in the green of his gaze. “Is that why you were… Oh, whatever. Are you with the mafia?”
He turns slowly to his side, pushing himself away from the carpet until he’s seated, naked and hangover, jaws aching. Malfoy is, thankfully, still asleep, looking unperturbed. Harry would like to say that Malfoy looks ugly in sleep, but that’s not true; he’s just as poised and elegant in rest as he is usually.
The glass of water Teddy puts in his hand is cold and Harry takes a grateful sip from it. He almost spills half of it down his front when hands cover his eyes suddenly.
“I sent it all to the Aurors when you came through the other night. I told you then, but you did not seem receptive to communication,” he adds. “The suspect is in interrogation as we speak.”
Harry grits his teeth, pulls at his anger and glances at Teddy, who looks lost and very small in the lavish plush of his chair. He takes a breath in, exhales, and unfolds his napkin on his lap.
“What’s the point of telling you what you already know?” She sighs heavily, just like she does when she looks at one of James’s messes. “Do you want me to fix your face?”
They lapse into silence and stare in opposite directions. Harry feels the quiet press on him, almost regrets the Mufflatio he cast when they sat. Outside distractions would be very welcome now.
Harry loses pathetically. Draco rains hell and snowballs upon him, flushed and pleased with his incoming victory and Harry is hopeless to do anything about it. He lets Draco fall over him, cover him with his bony limbs and makes him swallow pristine and biting snow. All the sputtering in the world cannot mask Draco’s maniacal laughter.
“You can’t run away, you’re nineteen.” Harry says, but he’s teasing, smiling, trustful and quiet at the corner of his mouth.
When he comes back the day after, there is no sign of them. Not even a petal. Draco feels worry bubble up in his throat, but he swallows it back down and goes on with his day. He repeats to himself, that if there had been an intruder, the wards would have alerted him. It doesn’t reassure him.
Harry’s heart does a somersault at the proximity, and the almost-brush of Malfoy’s fingers with his own. He swallows thickly and turns his back (and his nose) to Malfoy to lead the way.
The day is gone in a blink and Harry swoops in between two shifts, kisses Draco on the mouth, takes a shower and goes back to work without noticing anything amiss.
“You’re unnecessarily aggressive. I thought we didn’t have to talk about the fact that we’re here for Teddy and Teddy alone.”
Secretly, in the quiet of his room, he thinks that Voldemort’s soul had hid there, quiet and inconspicuous, in the crease of his knuckles. It doesn’t feel right, but it’s the only explanation for the emptiness that swells in him when he is staring at his hand.
“Draco,” and there must be something in his voice, because Draco turns around in a second to face him.
He sees Mimpsy, his house-elf, coming to get water boiling but Draco waves her away and she goes back to her apartment, by the pantry. He rises to put a kettle on the stove and chooses a selection of calming herbal teas from his personal stash.
Draco looks at him briefly, doesn’t linger on Potter’s openly honest face. He clears his throat and turns back to his reading. The words swim in front of his eyes.
Draco pushes away and through the halls, until he’s bursting outside and walking with great purpose to the gates, his robe clutched around himself in flimsy protection.
But Draco sees strawberries redden in autumn, trees lose their leaves in the middle of summer and birds sing in chorus in the darkest of the night. He calls an expert one day, when the entire grounds are covered with soft and young grass at the beginning of January, but by the time she floos to the Manor, everything has disappeared under a thick inch of snow.
Draco tries not to squirm under the weight of his faux-pas. He’d rather not deal with so much emotion between them.
Harry straightens up and lays a hesitant hand on Draco’s shoulder. He doesn’t shrug him away and so Harry squeezes him gently, trying to convey reassurance and affection. They breathe together for a few minutes.
“So late in the semester there aren’t many rooms available. We put you with a student named Draco Malfoy.” She pauses mid-step and pulls Harry to a stop; there’s a new tightness to her lips. Her hand is light on his shoulder. “Mr. Malfoy has a tendency to bend the rules to his advantage. So you would do well to be careful and stay out of trouble.”
Malfoy works his jaw, turns away from Harry and doesn’t look at him when he answers. “It is what it is, Potter. We fuck. We go on our way.”
Draco looks curiously at the muggles around them; dressed with a disarray that would appal his parents, and London outside, shining bright under the summer sun as he tries to relax back.
Harry remembers slapping the report on his desk right before he had been called out, confident that he would look it over later. The nauseous pull the memory causes is not enough to have him relax in his seat.
Draco’s smile is genuine, but lacks the grand joy of his habitual grin. Harry waits for him to talk.
Harry takes a burning sip of tea-flavoured water; he really cannot see the appeal. Malfoy does the same, but sighs with such strong pleasure, head tipped back to the light, that Harry has to look away, hide behind his own cup.
“Don’t be an idiot, Potter,” he does that, sometimes, call him Potter when he’s feeling a bit vindictive or nostalgic. Or defensive, Harry adds mentally. “I dried them a few days ago.”
There’s something there, standing between his rose garden and the great oak, a tall figure swaying in the breeze, rippling at the edges. Draco squints down at it, tries to blink it away.
“It’s okay, Uncle Harry,” Teddy says, looking very formal in his small robes and bow-tie. Harry would bet a large amount of money this farce was all Malfoy’s idea.
Andromeda doesn’t look frazzled or surprised, but she rarely does anyway. She was born with a cool head and a heap of rationality that made it easier to navigate the tumultuous waters of the Black family.
Harry joins them and expertly kisses his children on their forehead without getting any flour on his uniform. Rose gets a hug as she’s clean.
Draco stands, finding out with pleasure that he has a few centimetres on the man. He seems to notice it too and sniffs while straightening out.
“Enough.” He takes a step back and watches Potter relax against the bark. “What is this? You’re not a ghost.”
Harry abruptly stands up but cannot get himself to walk away yet. His wolf feels settled like it never does, not even at home. Malfoy’s office is a place to rest and Harry is terrified by the reality of it. He wants to go, lest he does something mortifying; yet, he can’t bear to leave.
No one wants to touch a werewolf. Harry grits his teeth, but doesn’t say anything and pulls his hands behind his back, nods instead.
Once he has gone over it twice and deems that it doesn’t read as pathetically home-sick as he feels, he presses sealing charms and a few boobytrap curses into the papers. Pansy’s mother has always been an awful little snoop. Then he quickly pulls his shoes on, goes out onto the small, lichen-ridden patio shared between the surrounding buildings’ tenants, and apparates to the small wizarding village of Wimbourne.
Malfoy silences him with a kiss. And later that night, Harry follows him, veiled by the Invisibility Cloak. He still doesn’t say anything.
“All of that?” Harry asks with a spark in his eyes. It reassures Draco and he lets himself relax on his own bench.
Harry keeps his eyes firmly shut, but his nose alone tells him where he is. Malfoy keeps a large array of lavender-scented products and it sits heavy on Harry’s tongue.
“You never want to talk about it. You’ve not wanted to talk about it for six months now.” Her mouth thins in a line. “Listen, Harry… Hermione is only trying to help.”
Later, the shirt comes back to his mind. But by then, Draco has experienced three mind-blowing orgasms in quick succession, a feat he didn’t not think possible at his age, and he’s feeling a lot less agitated about it.
He disappears upstairs, where Draco has never been, but knows Tommy’s room is. He hears some banging around before Tommy descends and shoves some papers in his hands and some plastic sticks.
“Don’t tell this to anyone, but I pretended that I had no memory of where I lived and who my parents were. Nobody ever claimed me, so...”
Draco looks down at his neatly pressed dark shirt and his silver-hemmed trousers; the two items that he chose for the occasion, deciding that they would look sufficiently muggle to make him blend in. He looks at the man helplessly.
Draco smiles against his throat, adept hands unbuttoning his shirt and brushing his nipples with a deliberation that is too repetitive to be accidental.
“Do you want to know about?” and Draco doesn’t finish his sentence, his smile sitting nervous on his face.
“Very sorry about that, he’s completely pissed. Please don’t…” he darts his eyes to Draco and back to the floor. “Please don’t think badly of him.”
They don’t sleep exactly. Harry props himself on his elbow and looks down to Draco as he asks questions about his life before, about Wizarding Britain and inevitably, about his parents.
“No.” He blinks at Harry. “No, it would be worse to wake them up now. Better to let them have their tantrums separately.”
“Well, it’s not muggle per se, haven’t you heard that the Burton fellow is a squib? From one of the Twenty-Eight, even. Terribly kept secret, that. And anyway, Scorpius is fascinated.” He waves a hand in Harry’s direction, and yes, Harry sees it now, that Malfoy is already tipsy. “I despair. None of my childhood proper Wizard books appeal to him.”
“Don’t look at me like that, I love my parents. They’re honestly a thousand times better than the harpy who had my guarde when I was a kid. I think she was my biological mother’s sister, but she was such a cunt, that I’m not sure I believe it.” He looks thoughtful for a second. “I don’t think you could treat family like that.”
“Merlin,” Draco says, when he has found his voice once again, “Pansy you cow, I told you not to contact me. Has anyone followed you?”
In Malfoy’s neat script, there’s an address and the time of the meeting. Harry has an hour to get ready.
“Of course not, I took measures!” she yells. “And what was I supposed to do? Prepare your eulogy? I had no news for two weeks! I thought your father went too far and whisked you off to some grisly looking island to slaughter unicorns or something!”
“Don’t forget to pay,” he helpfully says, and when Draco rolls out a bill at random. “That’s way too much. Christ, where have you been living?”
“Ah, keep your secrets then,” Harry decides, and comfortably sinks in his seat, waiting for the end of the journey.
By the time they’ve made it home and eaten curry for dinner, Draco is too full to move, too tired to mention it, and so he lets Harry push him onto the mattress and deliciously rut against him until completion. They barely trade a last kiss before Draco is pulled under, warm skin soothed by the tingly cold of a fresh sheet. It almost feels like magic.
It covers the mouth and nose, tightens around the jaw and throat. It’s a long drawn-out death that leaves the body red and blue
“Stop playing,” he says and pushes his fingers in Malfoy’s shoulder to urge him, down or up, to do something.
A couple of short hours later, Harry squints in the blinding sun, feeling his headache roll over him like a roaring tempest. He feels dry, an empty shell that stayed too long in the oven. Death warmed over, Hermione would say.
It’s not a lie. They fall back into silence. Ron looks back at him evenly until mischief spreads onto his features.
He only realizes that he’s asleep when Ginny wakes him up by poking his feet with her long frigid fingers. Harry shudders and pushes them away from her prying digits.
Harry is seated on the steps outside, looking over the bustle of the streets and the curious onlookers trying to take a peek of the source of the commotion when Malfoy finds him. He hands a cup of tea to him.
So when the white figure appear on the grounds again, under the blinding light of a full moon, Draco pales with his hurry to get to it before any of the boys can lay eyes on it. The breeze sways the fabric over distinctive calves and the relief of a hand and Draco runs down the stairs and across the grass, feeling the sharp blades under his bare feet.
“You hate your job,” finishes Draco for him and Harry closes his eyes on the truth of it, cutting sharp and abrupt.
“Sure, uh, I come back around two in the morning, and I don’t have work until three pm, so…” Draco tries very hard not to look alarmed. Harry steels himself, face going hard. “So I could make you breakfast.”
It’s a half-truth, but Harry cannot voice what he really wants. Pack is not a thing Ron and Hermione can understand. He doesn’t either, not really. He knows that there’s strength in numbers and that his wolf is at his happiest when surrounded by the warm touch of others. But he doesn’t know how this new part of him can translate to their friendship, which seems so brittle now that Ron and Hermione are engaged.
Harry was in charge of the investigation. He’ll probably bring it to you when he comes back from his honeymoon.
He seems to think about it. His expression is doubtful and has Harry swallow back a whine; there’s something in him, rolling in his chest, that wants to please Malfoy at all cost.  Harry feels embarrassed and flushes with it.
Heads turn as they move through the Atrium, and a rise of murmurs follows their path. It’s the year after the war all over again. Harry grits his teeth and endures it, but doesn’t fight it when Malfoy bends his silver head to him and asks “Side-along with me?”
Draco presses a sure hand against his shoulder and says “Yes,” with a certainty he doesn’t have. Scorpius looks at him dubiously but doesn’t speak.
He shakes it off, casts his Good-Eyesight charm and then, finally, he sheds his clothes and his human skin. The wolf comes barreling in, pulled out by pain and cracking bones.
Potter looks real and solid on the other side of the table, handsome in the carelessness Draco has never associated with beauty before. He looks alive, not like he crawled out of his grave, wrapped in shroud.
“I guess I’ll have to owl her to know. It would be a shame if she was the one to ask for a revision, really.”
He purses his lips; Harry wants to do something stupid and feels the leather give under one of his nails.
Draco wets his lips and looks above Harry’s shoulders, in the safety of the non-judgemental white of the wall.
“Hello gentlemen,” says a man striding in. He doesn’t falter when he sees Harry seated here, but his heartbeat trips and startles into a breakneck rhythm.
Draco blinks at Harry; he’s not looking back, still watching the charm, half-warily, half-fascinated.
Draco prides himself in that, in not making Harry remark on anything. He had wanted to burst into a nervous fit of laughter at the very sight of him and only prevented it by pushing his nails into his palms, where crescent-shaped bruises might appear in the future.
There are hands on his hips then, not yet urgent but eager, and Draco steps back enough to unbutton his shirt. He takes half a second to curse the fact that Harry is a muggle and that he cannot spell the buttons open. All of that is forgotten when Harry bats his hands away and does it for him, face hidden in the crook of Draco’s neck, biting kisses against the tender skin.
As soon as he has said it, he regrets it. It sounds too bothered for the cool aloof persona Draco tries to shape himself in.
Having a grown werewolf making himself at home in his lap is not catastrophically bad. Surprisingly. Draco would probably find it enjoyable if he did not have the omnipresent knowledge that a human being hides under its fur.
Draco snorts. A second later, Harry feels pressure against his throat, he pulls away just enough to look down at the fabric neatly twisting on itself and then the knot sitting between his collarbones.
It’s in a similar situation that Draco sees it again. It’s glaringly white against the afternoon sun, and doesn’t move when he steps closer. The fabric is solid between his knuckles and gives away without difficulty when he pulls on it.
Harry nods jerkily and extends a hand; Draco’s fit his in it, warm and assured and Harry slides the other one at his waist.
Harry’s smile is not of its usual radiance, but he perks up a little and takes a sip of pale beer, luminous against the tan of his fingers. Draco leans forward and eats a salty chip, finds Harry’s hand on the table and links their fingers together, feeling mellow and vulnerable and seeking comfort there.
“I very well can.” He answers, scowling down at Harry, seeing his face expand with a grin. “I did! It’s still running away when you leave your house without giving much of a warning to anyone!” Harry makes a dubious face. “Well, what would you know about running away?”
Draco shakes his head, feels his chest tighten around the ache there. He misses his mother, he misses Pansy, but he fears what his father would do to him now that he’s an adult, of age, and expected to be someone he consciously rejects, someone he didn’t grow up to be.
Later in the night, woozy with drink, he steals a cig from a good-looking, dark-haired giant and slips through the side door, checking over his shoulder so that no sober person sees him cast Incendio.
It appears that someone in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement misplaced the artifacts N°789854A and N°569968U loaned to them by the Department of Mysteries. The investigation they were a part of has since been closed and they have still not made their way back to the Department.
“Here, give it to me,” Draco opens his palm and Harry tips the ring in, sees it shine in the low light. He puts it in the pocket of his shirt, above his heart and rubs the shape of it once.
He thinks of having to face Harry’s distress with the rising tide of his home-sickness and pulls Pride and Prejudice from under his pillow instead.
And Malfoy leaves, pushing the Silencing Charm aside and striding with purpose to the door. Harry lets his head thump on the table.
After the first two swallows, he finally takes stock of his surroundings. He smells rank, of sweat and salt and Scorpius is looking at him from over his book with a worried tilt to his eyebrows. Draco has a second of hesitancy, words on his lips to inform his son of the trespasser that somehow got through the wards, before he clamps his mouth shut. If Scorpius learns about it, Albus won’t be far behind. He is in no state to deal with an impostor wearing his father’s face.
“Shh,” Potter says, close, just next to his ear. “Here they come.” And he presses incredibly closer, pushes Draco against bark until his back stings with it.
Harry nods, tongue-tied. Malfoy is very close, looks awfully good in the rigid cotton of his shirt, angular and sharp. Harry is a bit scared to cut himself if he ever touches him. He wants to try. He pushes his hands in his jeans pockets instead.
The Oxford apartment features a view of a brick wall and awful lighting, but there’s a bottle of purple shampoo in the shower and a picture of a wedding from forever ago in the living room.
Harry looks at Draco, right next to him; it’s been years since they’ve been this close. Since the War and Fiendfyre, probably. He doesn’t understand.
Draco’s house (because that’s what the Manor is now, nothing else) is where Harry feels himself truly relax. Not working has been wonderful for his anxiety, but he sheds it completely when he is seated in Draco’s smoking room, a finger of amber liquor in a stocky tumblr, his lover stretching next to him on the couch, feet propped in Harry’s lap.
“You didn’t believe in me any more,” Potter elaborates, and Draco feels like he’s falling through the floors, down, down, down. Guilty, as he had charged himself.
They share delicious chocolate-coated biscuits over two cups of subpar tea in the mess of bedsheets, feeling buzzy with pleasure. Draco has the distinct sensation of newly-oiled joints, feeling like a well clogged machine better than any potion from Madam Pomfrey ever could. Harry’s hair makes him look as shagged out as he is, and the lopsided grin he has been sporting for the last half an hour cannot deny his high spirits.
The wet kisses of Malfoy’s reassurance have him yielding the prison of his fingers. Malfoy eases his wrists away from his face and holds them in his hands, gentle pressure opening him up to the space between them.
“I do!” he shouts, and Harry feels his heart in his throat. “I do,” Malfoy adds, more sedately. “Your lot is simply nitpicking things we overlooked when we renovated the Manor.”
Harry has locked the joints of his shoulders and hands, firmly cramped around Malfoy’s notes, to ensure that he wouldn’t unconsciously do something ridiculous like take a sniff of Draco’s skin.
“Yeah, erm. Hello,” he says, helpfully, instead of falling to his feet and burying his head in Malfoy’s stomach.
Harry looks to the heavens for an answer and finds none, only the ceiling stained by questionable substances.
“I promised him I would put him somewhere warm,” Harry says and Draco smiles back at him, small and complicated.
Harry, feeling too strange to completely relax in his seat, scrambles for the list of decisions that took him to this very instant, sharing a teapot with Draco Malfoy and listening to him rant on the best way to enjoy tea.
He has his own office and a secretary who nudges a cup of tea and crumpets at his elbows when he skips lunch. It’s good. It’s enough.
“No, it’s not what you’re asking, but it’s surely what you’re thinking.. No one can bear being this close to me for this long.”
Hermione opens her mouth to talk, but seems at loss of words. She empties her glass with a too large swallow and winces.
Astoria, whos Harry is helping tidy up under the gaze of a distressed house elf, looks at them go and smiles at him mischievously.
“Hello,” Draco says, trying to stamp out the affection that blooms in his chest. They have not spoken of him leaving yet, but it cannot be long before Harry chases him out of his house.
That gets a small reaction from Albus, at least. He takes the knife Draco holds out for him, and cuts a piece of soft p’tit basque.
He shuffles back a bit, smoothing a hand over Harry’s thigh, and lines up. The push-in is slow and steady and Harry has to hide his face in his hands. There’s too much power in this; too much power in Malfoy’s reach, when Harry is so vulnerable, fingers grabbing at his ribcage to pull it open.
He takes a short breath and throws an arm around Albus’ shoulders. The gesture is unexpected enough that the teenager seems to flicker back in his shell, surprise stretching the droopiness of grief on his face.
They don’t have the excuse of alcohol this time. The night is young, and Harry is sober when he stumbles upon the dancefloor of another anonymous gay club. He sees Draco, swaying in the red-purple-pink light. His hair is an artist’s pallet, reflecting colours like water. Harry is compelled to get closer, to be here until Draco looks at him.
He doesn’t risk it himself and decides to find himself a bottle of water and some shade before making the jump to the house. He doesn’t want to throw up on the carpet; he’s had to deal with enough bodily fluids with the arrival of a newborn baby.
“I know that. That’s not what I meant.” Malfoy smooths the fabric of his trousers in a nervous tick. Harry tries hard not to stare at his hands.
“I know. His name is David, and he seems like a proper gentleman. He doesn’t even mind that she’s married to a poof.” At Harry’s dismal expression, adds, “Of course, he didn’t say it in so many words.”
Malfoy stares at him for a long second. His fingers twitch in his lap. Harry takes a sharp breath in.
On the next morning, Draco pushes Harry’s hair aside and traces the path of his scar. It rouses Harry, who looks at him with the slow blinks of a heavy sleeper and rewards him with a smile, a bit puzzled but otherwise warm.
Harry’s honesty and emotional vulnerability must have soaked into him over the short days they have spent together, because the small confession leaves him feeling gutted and too raw for public conversation.
He doesn’t want to think about it; when he does, he feels carved out by anxiety. It must be a bruise, something Ginny bypassed because it was hidden. It’s alright.
His boots sink in the soft layer of snow and Draco watches the flowers with puzzlement. He is no botanist, but he knows enough to be sure that these are not in season.
Draco has to clench his fists two times before meeting the green of his gaze. Harry seems very uncertain, tan skin on the yellow of the bed, not really laid back any more, but held down by a tense rigidity.
The day is incredibly hot and Harry doesn’t think he will be able to withstand the constraint of his tie for more than the formal ceremony; supposing he finds a way to tie it without his future-husband. Draco really has an unrivalled knack for tailoring charms and Harry has strict instructions not to seek him out, for tradition’s sake.
Harry pants, thoughts flung out of order. Every one of his attempts to talk ends up in a gasp, muted by their next kiss. He sticks his nails in Malfoy’s skin and doesn’t even raise a sound in answer; they’re already tearing at each other, rib cages gaping open with the desperate need that pushes them together.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he says through gritted teeth. His knuckles are white at his sides.
Harry feels adrift at sea, anchored only by Draco’s hands at his hips, by his warm exhales on the skin of his throat. It’s too early in the night to get lost in someone’s eyes, but Harry tries desperately, feels like there’s fifteen years of desire stored up in his chest squirming to get out. He cannot speak; his mouth doesn’t stray far enough from Draco for him to talk.
The nights are nippy this time of the year and the meadow Harry has chosen for this is swept by great gusts of chilly wind, but Draco only laughs uproariously at him, gleeful, and casts a tight warming charm over them both. It helps and Harry stops sniffling.
At the table, a waitress is bending down to pick up his fork; Harry feels himself flush with embarrassment.
“Yeah.” Harry pushes a thumb in the arch of his eyebrow, rubs to ease the tension there. “But it’s not like we ever stopped hurting each other. I suppose that’s a no, then.”
Harry falls into blue-tinged darkness, oddly reminiscent of the Invisibility cloak. He hears nothing at all outside of this bubble, just his breath, and lets himself smile unabashedly.
Harry wakes up to pounding on the door and copious swearing. He opens his eyes just in time to see Malfoy smack him with a bag.
“I cast some spells to turn them away.” He tucks a strand behind her ear, uselessly; she leans in his hand. “I cannot go back to the Manor now, and I’m sure Father will send someone after me soon, if he hasn’t already.”
He goes to class with sore purple on his collarbones and hunches his shoulders in the showers so that no one remarks on it. He seeks out Malfoy for entirely different reasons; carnal desire lights up his blood when he sees his name on the map. Harry tries to look inconspicuous and go on with his life: he eats, he sleeps, he can’t remember his homework, he walks into doorways. Hermione looks at him with worried eyes but says nothing.
“My husband will join you shortly,” she says with a pinch to her mouth before disappearing to get water boiling. Too polite not to offer something to drink but obviously not happy with a werewolf in her house.
Harry tries not to squirm under Malfoy’s gaze, tries not to step closer. He shifts his balance, feels the drag of rough carpet under his feet.
I cannot imagine a universe where you would be glad for my correspondence and thus, I am willingly choosing to make this quick.
Harry, out of his conscious willpower, extends a hand. Malfoy shakes it with a dubious turn to his mouth, but it’s enough to send Harry aflame. It’s enough for a bit of Malfoy’s scent to transfer to his skin and for Harry to bring a piece of him home. He’s dizzy with the idea of it. His wolf pants excitedly.
“How are you even watching them?” he inquires, rubbing at the rim of his glass, crystal singing under his red-wet fingers.
Harry is silent at that, and Draco swallows around the lump in his chest. He feels constantly wrong-footed since he introduced Harry to his true identity. He’s never experienced grief himself, and doesn’t know quite how to tip-toe around the issue. He has spent the last days feeling like he’s knee-deep in his own insensitivity.
Draco makes a strangled noise in answer. “Yes, alright,” he says and pushes forward, in a slow, tortuous grind. Harry gasps into it.
“So, let me get this clear, there a magical secret society which I saved when I was a year old by defeating a Black Lord-”
He pats at Potter’s head, very carefully. The wolf sniffs his hand but doesn’t bite him. Draco feels incredibly stupid.
Three years after Harry Potter’s death, Albus reaches an all time low. He’s doing so badly that he in fact moves in the Manor for an undetermined amount of time. Scorpius looks torn away by worry.
Draco hushes him and hurriedly turns two pages. Harry recognizes the drawings there; he saw the design bloom on his skin without understanding it. He doesn’t need Draco to tell him that they’re at the fifth one.
Malfoy stares at him. Harry feels himself flush and takes a step back to put further distance between them.
“Good, then. I don’t think he would go to the Aurors first, but at least there’s a limited number of people looking for me.”
“Yes, hero worship. It used to be me. Now he cannot be arsed to even look in my direction when I talk to him.”
“You think you’re better than us, don’t you?” he screams over his friend’s shoulder who is trying to get him to settle down.
It was true, though- Potter did have to leave. It was too risky. He couldn't stay here, in Draco's bed. Draco's whole body clenched at the thought. Potter was in his bed. His room. Lucius slept in the room on the other side of the hallway next to Potter's room.
"But I just don't have the strength to deal with two babies right now." Harry said with a look at sweet Teddy sleeping in his arms.
"Harry Potter attends the Triwizard Tournament even though the ministry set up a new rule. The boy had always been up for stupid and forbidden things, but this is the cherry on top. I had him and the other champions in a little interview, what can be read on page 13."
are being weird." Draco said, "They don't even know what they're talking about. Wizards are so much more powerful than Muggles."
"Shh, Teddy. It's all right." Harry whispered as he took the baby out of the crib and walked back to his bed, "It's only thunder."
"Holy Merlin!" He said excitedly. "HOLY MERLIN!" Harry laughed. "And then he just left?" Neville asked, Harry nodded and Neville walked up and down in the room.
"How are you, Harry?", Hermione asked smiling. Then, she looked behind Harry and the smile vanished.
Dean gave Ron his Chocolate Frog card with his face on it and he looked so proud his face almost exploded.
"To be honest, I don't know. Maybe she will, maybe she won't. But if you want to, I can talk to her ans tell her that I didn't broke up with her because of you. Then she will have no reason for attaching you.", Potter suggested.
Harry ran down the stairs, waited and heard Hermione shout at Malfoy, what made him keep running. Since he couldn't stay downstairs in the snow or anywhere else in the castle, Harry disapparated, a thing only he and McGonnagal could do after Dumbledore had died.
Suddenly the laughter stopped and nobody talked. Draco turned around. The three friends looked at him and he stood up.
Even though Draco had been one hundred percent sure he wasn't going to find sleep this night, he fell asleep, the newspaper still in his hand and a smile on his face.
Draco groaned and buried his face in Harry's chest. Harry tangled his fingers in Draco's silky hair and smiled.
Potter told him that Granger wanted to know if he was alright because he wasn't home yet. And then she wanted to know where he was. And he should definitely call her if it would be getting very late and she was going to go to bed now.
"He said I'm disrespecting my family. I fought for the Dark Lord in the war and now I'm with the one who killed him. And appently I'm
Granger and Weasley looked at each other confused, but they let Draco in. He followed them along the doorway into the living room. He rubbed his hands together nervously.
Potter stepped close to the boy and looked him dead in the eye. Draco noticed that Potter wasn't as small as he used to be, in fact, he had grown a few inches.
Draco didn't know how he should feel right now. He had just watched another man ejaculate in front of him. Oh god he had just made another man ejaculate! He had just sucked another man off. Fuck, he had just sucked
"So that means" Malfoy said after he had stopped the video "This" he pointed at his wrists "And this" he pointed at Harry's hickey "Happened in the same minute."
After some time they went back inside and as Harry checked the clock in the living room he found that it was already nine o'clock. Malfoy pulled out his wand and cast a quick drying spell on himself and Harry did the same. The smile on Malfoy's lips threw Harry off track and he didn't know what to say. So to break the silence Harry asked if Malfoy wanted to drink something. Malfoy nodded and Harry filled their glasses with water again. Harry smiled widely. He was happy and even though Malfoy didn't mean to show it, Harry could see that he was happy too
"I would say you should go out. Because at the moment, I want Harry to be here, not you.", Draco said.
When Harry had finished packing his stuff, he lay down on his bed. He was really exhausted, but couldn't sleep. He missed Teddy. Harry trusted Mrs Weasley with him, she had raised enough kids to know how to do it, but he simply couldn't think of leaving until the Christmas holidays came and not see his godson at all. Harry sighed. This night was going to be a very long night.
He lay awake in his bed and listened to the sounds of Malfoy's slow and steady breathing. Harry somehow liked the sound and it calmed him.
Have you already thought about the holidays? What do you want to do when you are here? I thought we might visit the Goyle family and maybe the Parkinsons? Would you like that? Write me back as soon as you can and explain what is going on with Potter.
He normally only talked about this with Hermione, Ron or Sirius, but not with Malfoy. It was kind of strange.
Harry smiled at Ron gratefully and Ron nodded back. Hermione gave Ron a kiss on the cheek and whispered something in his ear - Harry suspected that she thanked him. Malfoy's grip loosened and Harry tried to let go of his hand, but Malfoy gripped it tighter again. Harry chuckled.
"Thank you dear." Mrs Weasley answered as she stirred the sauce, "Ron, help Harry to lay the table."
"See you.", Harry said and watched Draco walking down the corridor. He turned around and smiled at Harry, before he rounded a corner and vanished out of sight.
Malfoy's hand twitched in Harry's, but Harry didn't let go, because he didn't want Malfoy  to so anything stupid. Out of all the things Malfoy might be angry at, Harry couldn't allow
"How much I'm starting to like you." Malfoy said as if he'd heard Harry's thoughts, "It's embarrassing."
"Dinner is almost ready." She said and hurried around the kitchen hastily, "He said he would be home by now."
They left the room again. Narcissa opened the door to another room, in which a warm fire was crackling. On the walls were shelves with books, but these were no regular books. These were photo albums. Narcissa searched for a specific one pulled it out.
"I don't think so. I don't want you to have any trouble with your friends," Malfoy said, obviously not too happy about the circumstances.
Harry breathed out hardly. He had no idea where they had been. When Malfoy saw his clueless face, he broke out in laughter. Harry had to laugh too. Alcohol was making him feel very weird.
Was this another dream? No, in dreams you don't wonder whether it would be a dream, in a dream you were sure you were not in a dream. Then, Malfoy's gentle touch on Harry's arm made clear that this was certainly
"Malfoy-" Potter said and lay his hand on Draco's shoulder to stop him from doing something stupid. "Draco," Potter said and thought this would have more effect, but Draco ignored him.
Harry looked around. He knew most of the people in this room for they have been at Hogwarts with him. "Who? Where?"
Malfoy glared at Harry with his intensely grey eyes. Harry smiled gently. As Harry lightly put his hand on Malfoy's, Malfoy let go of his glass and grabbed Harry's hand.
talk to Blaise about it, Pansy wouldn't understand either. To be honest, Draco couldn't fully understand the situation himself. He wondered if Potter talked to someone about all of his feelings.
"In there?" Malfoy asked and Harry nodded. "Oh you're too cute. Don't tell me you've been doing it like this the whole seven years." Malfoy said and Harry was so annoyed that Malfoy chose to make fun of
Draco turned around to look at Potter, who smiled from one ear to another and looked happier than ever. Draco hasn't seen Potter happy in a very long time. And if so, it was
Malfoy spoke the words, but only a few silver strings came out of the tip of his wand and extinguished quickly. Malfoy opened his eyes again and looked at Harry.
Harry gasped dramatically. Malfoy had really tattooed Harry's and Teddy's doodles all over his Dark Mark. This was unbelievably amazing. Draco was amazing. Harry watched Draco in awe as he lay down in his gigantic bed and put his hands behind his head. Malfoy had a cocky grin on his face and all Harry wanted to do was kiss him. But he didn't. Instead, he stood there at the foot of the bed and smiled, holding back a tear.
Harry was thrilled, of course, but irritated as well. He decided to overlook the weirdness of this event and focus on the fact that Teddy was here. Teddy didn't have much of the evening, though. Hermione convinced Harry that Teddy had to go straight to bed after dinner or he would be too tired to watch the fireworks. With three hours left until midnight, they set up their tents in the field, making a circle around the big bonfire. Harry was sad that Hagrid couldn't be there - he would have liked for him to see this.
He had always hated it when his friends would ask about his feelings when he clearly wasn't in the mood.
He didn't want to wake him, but if Madame Pomfrey caught them, it would be horrible. Thank god, the curtains were closed.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "You decide to wear a suit, you have to live with the consequences." Potter explained.
Harry shrugged. "But Malfoy and I are connected by something. Nothing connects me to the rest of them."
"Don't start this year like the years before, Malfoy." Potter said astoundingly calm, "We all know what is going to happen if you don't behave yourself."
Three idiots like Goyle, Zabaini and Nott couldn't prevent someone like Mr Malfoy from coming upstairs to check if his son and his former enemy were sleeping together.
And he was right, only Harry felt different. When Ron had found out, Harry was shocked and feared and he didn't know what Draco would say about this.
"But now, like I already said, we have to do something else." She said, "We are pleased to welcome back many students that have returned for their eighth year at Hogwarts. And these students have to be sorted as well."
She checked her list and sent him to the fourth floor - treatment for spell damage. Harry jogged to the door he was sent to and found Nott and Zabini sitting on two chairs next to the door. They jumped up when they saw Harry.
As Harry and Hagrid reached McGonagall and Draco, Hagrid let go of Harry's arm hesitantly and took a seat next to Mrs Weasley, who rubbed his gigantic hand comforting. Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna stood right behind Harry, the boys wearing dark blue suits, the girls violet dresses. Harry looked at Draco, who seemed to be just as nervous as he was. Behind Draco were Theo, Pansy, Blaise and - to Harry's surprise - Gregory Goyle, all dressed in the same clothes as Harry's friends. McGonagall stepped to the podium between the two grooms and smiled. Harry smiled, too, and looked at the hundreds of faces in front of him. He recognized so many of them, also the ones who didn't attend Hogwarts for their last year were here.
Theo and Pansy laughed. This was exactly what they wanted to hear and Draco didn't dare to tell them about the talk he had had with Potter afterwards.
Plucking up courage, Draco raised his hand to knock - three times. He was freezing, but he was so afraid, he wanted the door to stay closed. Unfortunately, it was opened. Weasley stared at him from the other side of the doorstep.
"Today, we met with Harry Potter to discuss the issue he had in mind for a long time now. The boy is willing to donate a sum of money to three different orphanages, magical and Muggle. We asked what inspired him to do so. "I am an orphan myself. And I hated the people I had to live with. They treated me poorly and I never had the chance to fully be who I really was. I didn't know I was a wizard, I was refused to talk to people and I didn't learn to know the truth about my parents," he told us, "Also, Tom Riddle was an orphan." We were very surprised that Mr. Potter brought up this specific example."
After he had showered, Harry took one of his comics out and jumped into his bed. He started reading it.
He pattened the owl on the head and it flew away. Draco closed the window again and rolled out the parchment. It was the answer from Pansy. She didn't wrote much this time.
"I sure am. They follow my orders, I know that. They have no enforceability.", he said and took a deep breath.
The living room was big with dark walls. The fireplace is made out of black stone and above it hangs a big mirror. There stood several dark wooden commodes and a black piano. In front of the fireplace were two grey leather couches with golden pattern. All in all the room was very dark. Except for the bright red carpet. Draco smiled. Through high windows you could see a small garden.
Seamus nodded without saying a word and started eating. Harry was sick of being topic NO.1 in this school. He was talked about in first year, because he was the great Harry Potter. Second year, because everyone thought he was the heir of Slytherin. In third year, he wasn't the hot topic, but only because there was a supposed mass murderer on the loose. And now, in fourth year, first because he entered the Tournament without permission and now because he and Draco Malfoy were in a relationship.
Potter smiled, gave his friends a look and then decided not to give Draco a kiss. Draco was absolutely fine with that, he honestly wasn't going to as well. "I'm fine. Really fine," Potter said smiling.
"No. I came here to tell you right away.", he lied quickly. Of course, he didn't feel obliged to tell them what he really did.
"Something important." He said as he looked at Harry again, "Maybe something in a big fancy company."
Draco finally stood up, walked to his closet and opened it. Beneath his underwear, he took out a second floor and took out a black box. The box with newspapers.
He looked at Neville, Luna and Ginny who were all pretending that didn't hear anything of their conversation.
Pomfrey started to walk and Draco wanted to follower her, when Granger opened her mouth -why does she
Harry couldn't hold it anymore and came into his boxer shorts. Only a few seconds later, Draco came in his own. He sunk down on Harry, kissing his chest.
Suddenly Draco heard a familiar voice and turned his head to the entrance. Granger walked in, 3 books in her arm and a boy at her side. But it wasn't Weasley. Draco furrowed his brow. Of course, this was none of his business but still, he was very interested in telling Weasley about this and creating a little drama. So Draco held his book up to his nose and glanced over the rim, watching the two sit down at a table close to his.
Harry turned around, hastily grabbed a few milk cartons and got ready to leave. He was already almost around the shelf when Malfoy said:
And pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates, too. Draco laughed at Harry's surprised face.
"That's really ridiculous." Ron said and showed Harry the article he'd just read, "Who was the person who blabbed?"
He shuffled behind her and Ron into the living room where only one glass of lemonade stood on the table and half a bowl of popcorn. Harry realized that the room didn't give away that Malfoy had even been there. Ron made himself some tea and joined Hermione and Harry on the couch, Harry sitting where Malfoy had sat just an hour ago.
Harry laughed. That was kind of true, considering all the crazy stuff that was going on in the wizarding world.
Harry opened his mouth to say something, but Malfoy's aggressive look stopped him. Harry figured Malfoy wanted to speak for himself, but Harry had never seen Malfoy trying so hard not to say something rude.
Draco sighed, but let himself be convinced and sat down. The other Gryffindors stared at him with confused looks.
They talked a lot until Harry changed the subject and said, "By the way, why so you look like a homeless person?"
"It's August, Potter. How for God's sake can you be cold?" But Malfoy was already on his feet and ready to go back inside.
party, after all he had been a Death Eater, and Draco didn't want to risk getting hurt if he could just stay at home where he would like to be.
"Pansy.", Draco said. He had always been the one who fooled his friends or laugged about them. How did it get the other way around?
"Whoa, Malfoy. If you don't want to drink it then don't.", he said, but Malfoy shook his head. Harry's eyes rushed over the other boy's face and he relaxed a bit.
"I hope you all have the best of magical years here in this school like I did. Hogwarts was my home for six long years, and I couldn't wish for a better place to be. This year is a lot different than the years before, this year there is no dark cloud of threat and fear hanging over this school, this year everyone shall live in unity. To all of you who have the feeling they need to talk, if it is about what happened before or about what you fear will happen next, you can come to me this entire evening and I will be glad to help you."
"So I noticed. But weren't you the one who said we need to go to our classes?", he remembered Harry, who laughed.
"You know, there's nothing better than these chicken wings!", Ron said happily as they sat at lunch and he waved with the chicken wing.
"Yes!" Ron said enthusiastically, "That's it. With the trousers you already have in the dressing room."
, you're also the boy he tried to kill for the last several years. And mother- my mother would be so sad. She always wished for a grandchild. She wanted the Malfoy-bloodline to never come to an end. And I can't give her that. Not with you." Draco held back his tears. He just realised how hard it really was to be with Harry Potter.
Harry read the letter from McGonnagal again. The term this year, as every year, was starting on September the first, even though Ron had repeatedly said that rebuilding Hogwarts would take more time than planned.
Harry rested his head on Draco's shoulder and closed his eyes for a second. Then he looked at Ron, who had a wide grin on his face. This was such an important change for Harry - Ron used to look at Malfoy with loathing and now he smiled at them. Ever since that one night they had been up and talked about
"Actually, Hermione and Neville already knew. Ron, I wanted to tell you after classes but then this happened-" Harry gestured around the hospital wing "-and then I didn't get a chance."
"Does Mister Draco wish a warm meal or again only bread?", a second one asked, while a third brought Draco a glass of pumpkin juice.
Harry's throat tightened and he gasped for air. He was having a panic attack. Hermione and Ron caught on quickly and got up and sat down next to Harry.
"You were right. I should go. I really, really should." Potter gave him a sad look and tried to get up again.
Draco didn't know what to say. Why did Potter act like he was interested in all of this? Draco didn't want to talk about his mother or his feelings. He stared at Potter for a long time and could see that Potter was feeling intimidated and sorry. Draco sipped his whisky and looked into the glass as he put it back down on the table.
Again, Harry apologised and the song ended. The Weird Sisters earned a round of loud applause and continued with the next song.
But he didn't get any further, because two little people came up to them and asked for Potter's autograph. Draco snorted.
"None of your business.", Malfoy said, suddenly scowling and lay back down in his bed. Harry was taken aback. Had he done something wrong? He walked over to Malfoy's bed and looked at him.
Everyone looked at Lucius, to find out something about this all on his face, but it stayed cold as stone.
Malfoy nodded again. They stood there for a while until Malfoy had finished his cigarette. They both mounted their brooms and said goodbye, Malfoy flying off first.
Draco nodded. He didn't know quite what to say. Potter was inviting him to come over?! Where they would be all alone?!
"I don't know!" Malfoy shouted back and looked angry "You prick what have you done to me? What potion have you slipped me?"
. Draco wasn't used to cozy. He was used to naked grey walls and a simple plain black carpet. Draco wasn't used to walls covered with pictures, especially not pictures of happy people. He was used to one enormous portrait of him and his parents with stern emotionless faces on an even more enormous naked grey wall.
"Hey Potter.", Draco greeted Harry happily and kissed him shortly, what made Parkinson's face turn red in anger.
"Well... When the Dark Lord and my aunt lived with us, it was a very hard time for me. I thought that I would be a disappointment for my family and in sixth year, I got this job to do... I didn't want to do it. I was feared. And fear made me do things I didn't want to do. The night on the Astronomy Tower... I didn't want to kill him. Really, Harry, I didn't want to do it. I lowered my wand! I really did! It was... I didn't want to be a coward anymore. All I wanted was to make my father proud. If I hadn't killed him, I mean Dumbledore, the Dark Lord would have killed me! I didn't eant to do it. Believe me, please, I-", tears streamed down Draco's face.
In the evening, Draco didn't stop smiling at Harry. He had mocked Harry several times because he had been Harry's treasure.
Harry rounded the corner and could already see the store, a Muggle supermarket. When they only needed Muggle stuff, Hermione found it best to keep Harry away from as many wizards as possible. Harry slightly got used to wizards wanting to say thank you or shake his hand. He'd been a celebrity before, but now that he had defeated Voldemort it got slightly out of hand. Everywhere he went was someone that recognized him and came up to him.
"Well, inside the monitor is a cable turner, Which catches the light signals and converts them back into electricity.", the man explained slowly.
They sat there on the couch for a while. Through the tilted window you could hear the sound of the wind rushing through the trees outside. The singing of the birds was more quiet now, but still hasn't stopped completely. When Harry was almost falling asleep as well, Malfoy's arm brushed against Harry's, what made Harry's heart beat faster and he suddenly imagined what could be. That they could be actual friends. Or maybe even more... if Harry could actually admit that he would want that. Before Harry could finish that thought, he felt sleep washing over him.
“And what? I divorce, and my wife escapes my terrible clutches at the arm of a Muggle? After people seeing me whisking you away to destinations unknown, don’t you think it’s a bit obvious? Are you trying to set all of England against me?”
Draco simply dusts himself off, as if the answers will fall out of his pockets. When he looks back at Harry, it’s only to see the flat blanket of anguish on his face.
Gregory Goyle walked downstairs. His face was still pale and he didn't look very healthy, but he seemed to feel better now.
"I mean it's more comfortable than in this diner." Potter said, but it sounded more like and excuse than an actual argument.
"Why did you stuff Harry into the cupboard?", Draco asked. Again, Mr and Mrs Dursley looked at each other.
"Oh, it'll be ready in a few minutes.", he said. Malfoy nodded understanding and sat down next to Harry. Harry smiled.
, I'm telling you!" said Ron outraged, "He can't talk to you like that! As if he hasn't done enough already, gaining your trust and then treating you like that..."
"You can take him with you if you want, of course." Malfoy said when he finally sat in a comfortable position, "I'd love to see him."
Neither Pansy nor Theo knew what to say. Of course, Draco had to tell them that Granger was the one that wanted him to stay because if he would have said that Potter or even Draco himself wanted this, they would freak out. And them thinking that a Mudblood wanted him to be there must be too much for their brains.
"Draco, how do you think of keeping the bloodline uphold? He's not pureblood and you won't have any children. What will happen to the Malfoy-family?", Lucius asked.
"We've already seen a lot of people from Hogwarts." Ginny told them when they walked towards the entrance, "Fred and Angelina are here too."
Harry had never liked to mention that it was his birthday - he didn't want people to feel obligated to congratulate him. But Mr. and Mrs. Baker wished him a very happy birthday either way and Harry thanked them gladly. The married couple sat down on their own terrace, out of sight from Harry, Ron and Hermione and so the three of them turned back to their breakfast.
Potter turned around, his back to Draco again and pulled Draco's arm back over his waist. Draco slided closer and snuggled against Potter. Draco closed his eyes.
Harry had to fight the urge to clap his hand against his forehead. Draco stood up, what made Nott slightly back away.
"Thank you, Sir." A third witch said. She seemed the eldest and Harry wondered if maybe she knew him from Hogwarts.
Harry turned his head abruptly when he heard Malfoy talk. Malfoy's eyes were still fixed on the street - he consciously avoided Harry's look - but he talked and that was what mattered to Harry.
"Don't mess it up for him." Weasley said with a firm gaze that Draco would have expected from Granger.
Neville looked at him. He looked really sorry for Harry. "Well maybe you should just give it all some time. I mean you're great, really. If I would be gay I would be totally into you," Neville said and Harry snorted, "I mean you are the nicest person I know. And you're really a very good friend. And as a matter of fact, you don't look too bad."
But he didn't get an answer. Instead, a spotlight hit him and Luna pushed him forward. Malfoy froze for a second, but then followed Harry to the stage - reasonable, because he didn't have anyone else here. Hermione helped Harry up on the stage. He looked at the crowd, at all those familiar faces, and swallowed thickly.
Harry stood up as well and grabbed Draco's shoulders. Draco avoided Harry's eyes and looked at the floor. Ron cleared his throat.
"Harry, I'm not comfortable with breaking into Malfoy's drawer. Besides, shouldn't you trust him now?"
"Harry, will you join me later? I want to go to the library and then get some fresh air.", Hermione asked.
Theo chuckled. "Well if they did, they hid it fucking fantastic. We should tell you about the times and times these two lovebirds weren't so much in love."
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. He wasn't looking at Malfoy, he was looking at that bitch Parkinson that was talking to him and gripping his arm like she would fall down without it. What the hell was going on right now?
Harry thought. He had around eight hours to get awake. Ron announced that he was going to take a shower before he would run out of time. Hermione smiled and Ron left her and Harry alone. Hermione must have thought this might be a good opportunity to annoy Harry some more. She leaned towards him and looked at him with big trustful eyes.
"I know," he forced himself to say. His lips stretched into a smile, but it probably looked like a grimace.
He and Professor McGonnagal were talking about the upcoming meeting and what Harry was supposed to say and not to say. They had rehearsed this for a few times already, but Harry's professor thought it was very important to go through it again.
"Please, Malfoy. Let me explain," Harry said and hoped Malfoy would just turn around to look at him.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Okay so how about you just start by telling us what happened when you got there."
The raven-haired boy turned around to look at him, without a word, he looked at the attackers again.
"As you know, my parents were killed when I was one year old. Dumbledore decided to bring me to my aunt's and uncle's, where I should be raised with my older cousin Dudley. My aunt Petunia is my mother's sister and she loathed her. You know as well that my mother was muggleborn, so my aunt was a Muggle. She thought of all wizards as freaks.", Harry laughed weakly.
Draco started packing his stuff for Hogwarts as always on the evening before the first day. Every year and this year as well, he had made a list with all of the things he needed. The list contained all of his cloths, what were only black suits; his underwear, what was only black boxershorts and black socks; his books and other school stuff; three pairs of the same black patent leather shoes; his expensive silver watch; his grey silk pyjamas; hair gel and a lot of other stuff and most importantly the box - the box with newspapers. Draco stuffed everything into the suitcase and placed it on his trolley, the box on top.
"We are not abnormal! I grew up in a bad family, but they never stuffed me in a cupboard, not even as a punishment!", Draco said loudly.
As soon as the door closed behind Potter, Draco lay down on the bed - it was Potter's bed. He was lying in Potter's bed. Draco's stomach felt like it was upside down. He couldn't stop smiling, what was really uncomfortable because he almost never smiled. "This is weird," Draco said to himself but it wasn't a bad kind of weird. It was a good kind of weird, a happy kind of weird. And this was even weirder.
Seamus rolled his eyes. "You and Malfoy get along pretty well even though you almost murdered each other every time you came too close to each other. And by
"Malfoy? Are you bloody serious right now? This git?", Ron asked and Parvati shifted uncomfortable in her chair.
"Now tell me everything. Potter showed you how to do a Patronus? That's good isn't it?" Draco shook his head.
No one said anything. Harry was sure Neville hadn't told Luna, but he was also sure that Luna would never get in a fight with someone who didn't
. He liked looking at him. He liked touching him- that doesn't mean anything either. He liked his smell. And the smell of his bed, even if it was not Draco's smell. He liked the way Draco walked when he was happy about something. He liked the way Draco grinned when Harry did something stupid. He liked Draco's constant bitching about literally everything, even if it's annoying, but Harry knew he couldn't live without it.
Harry didn't ask any further and gave Malfoy one of his knitted sweaters from Mrs Weasley. Malfoy looked at it with a look Harry couldn't quite pinpoint. They sneaked next door to Harry's bathroom and closed the door behind themselves. Harry smiled at Draco's nervous expression.
George shook his head. "No, no, I'm good." Then his eyes fell on Draco. "Malfoy, you wanker! What wind blew you in here?"
Harry sat down on the couch and looked up at his two friends and Malfoy. What were they doing? Harry thought he had expressed his feelings towards Malfoy clearly.
Malfoy took a step back and breathed as hardly as Harry himself did. Harry smiled, even though he didn't know if he should. He didn't know if Malfoy still was so upset about his mother or if he just had to let out some steam. Malfoy looked down on Harry and then on himself and then - to Harry's utter surprise - chuckled. It seemed ridiculous to Harry now too, how both of them were completely wet as if they'd just gone swimming with their clothes on. Harry started to shiver a little and Malfoy suggested they went back inside to dry themselves up.
"Yes. I forgot my book in the classroom, I'm going to look for it and then I'll catch up with you, Harry.", he said and hushed back to the room they just came from.
Harry nodded. Malfoy sighed and ran his fingers through his hair. Sadness rushed through Harry. He could understand that Malfoy didn't want to be seen, but he should know that no one in this house would judge him. But before Harry could say anything, Malfoy opened his mouth to say something. He looked at Harry again and bit his lower lip. Harry drew a sharp breath.
"Malfoy. You had nothing to eat yesterday and drank two bottles of fire whiskey. It's absolutely normal if you don't remember anything," Longbottom said.
Potter didn't answer, what made Draco look up at him. Potter's green eyes glistened behind his glasses and he was smiling, but not like he ridiculed Draco. It was an understanding and comforting smile, one that made Draco feel safe and not ridiculous at all. Now he knew what Potter had meant when he had said that Draco didn't have to prove anything to him.
Harry looked up at him and nodded. Draco reached for Harry's hand and pulled him to his feet. Together, they walked back under the invisibility cloak. Then, Harry and Draco had to separate their ways. They stopped and Harry looked at him.
Harry chuckled and pulled him away. They looked at the expensive clothes and Harry took several things that Sam hung into a dressing room for him. Harry tried on different outfits, all of them very classy and very expensive.
Harry laughed and shoved Malfoy's shoulder playfully. Malfoy shoved him back. They looked at each other. Harry wasn't sure if he could kiss Malfoy again. Maybe he should wait, they just made up and the last kiss didn't end very well.
So they did. They put on their school robes and Draco loved to feel it on his skin again. From there, it didn't took so long until they had reached Hogwarts.
"I need to know." Harry said, "You can't imagine how it was to find out you're at the hospital and someone attacked you."
Harry watched Goyle dance and felt sad. He knew what it felt like to loose someone important in your life.
deserve it. Harry looked at Neville, who smiled encouraging and nodded. Dean stared at all of them- from Harry to Neville, to Hermione, to Ron. Harry swallowed. They were the last two friends he had to tell. The last two. And that was even harder than telling the first friend - maybe it was because Neville had been so understanding and caring.
"Not much." Harry said half heartedly, maily focusing on getting out of the store as fast as possible so his ice cream wouldn't melt.
Harry nodded, looked back at the field and smiled. "It was really heroic how you came inside and rescued me from the evil monster called annoyance," Harry joked.
He looked around as he sat in the common room and wanted to do his Divination homework. Draco noticed that some frames were already filled with pictures from some students, so he stood up and left his homework on the armchair and walked up to the pictures. He found the Patil twins on one and the Weasley twins with Ron and Weaselette on another. Draco rolled his eyes as he looked at the other pictures. Deep down he wanted to hang a picture like this as well, but he knew he didn't have any good memories that were caught on camera and if so, Draco wouldn't hang them up in the common room where everyone could see it and laugh at him or soil the picture.
"I know that he is my, same as your, enemy and I would never consider anything else. I had to play it nice with picking him up from the hospital, because I was the reason he was even in there. I was in a fight with another student and when Potter tried to play the hero, I fired a shot at him to get him out of the way. McGonnagal then rushed right to him and she said I better be there when he gets out of the hospital wing or I would be in a lot of trouble, you know how annoying she can be. Don't even get me started on her. Walking around like she owns the school, thinking she can live up to what Professor Snape did! There is no one greater than a Slytherin, am I right?"
Hermione said they had no milk left at home so Harry agreed to look for it. He looked around the store while walking over to the milk fridge and froze as he spotted a familiar figure.
"Ah, Mister Malfoy. Harry already told me that you would be late. Take a seat, take a seat.", Slughorn said happily and waved Malfoy to the empty table in the back where he always sat.
. Harry had never found out what that talk had been all about, but he was really fond of the idea that Ron and Draco had a little secret.
They came around the curtain and Hermione immediately threw herself around Harry's neck. Ron put the jello on the table next to Harry's bed and smiled. "Good to have you back, mate," he said.
. Or not. Harry didn't know what to do. If he would go and Malfoy would trick him, he could for ever hate himself. If he wouldn't go and Malfoy hadn't even planned to trick him, he could for ever hate himself. Besides, Malfoy would have to plan the prank in three hours, what was practically impossible. But for Malfoy everything was possible. Harry checked his watch. Five minutes after midnight. He put the watch back on his bedside table and closed his eyes for a second. Damn it, he was hopeless.
Malfoy rolled his eyes again and stepped on the cigarette butt. He wanted to take off the jacket again, but Harry stopped him.
After Luna had left, Neville sat down on his bed. Harry refused to sit there and sat on the chair. Neville asked what Harry wanted to talk about, so Harry started telling him about Ron and Hermione in the Three Broomsticks and when Malfoy had stormed in.
Harry was woken up by Ron. Harry would have liked to tell Ron everything about last night, but he couldn't. He had promised Draco not to tell anyone.
Harry felt his heart lighten as the hammer was being hit to the desk. He had done it. He had reduced the sentence from 29 years to 15! That's almost half of the usual time. Harry was so proud of himself, but one thing made his mood get worse. Harry hadn't seen Malfoy smiling for too long. The last time Harry could remember was fifth year when Malfoy bragged about being in the Inquisitorial Squad and took points from Harry, Ron and Hermione. Idiot.
With this statement, the topic of Christmas was off the table. Everyone ate in silence, what disturbed Harry very much. This was supposed to be fun, not some pity-party. He thought of what he could talk about but nothing seemed to come to his mind. The past had been very difficult and not a happy topic to talk about, his dream last night would worry everyone and talking about Malfoy would make everyone -including Malfoy- uncomfortable. That was why Harry was happy when Dean said,
"Relax, idiot. I just want to tie this damn thing," Malfoy said calmly. His voice was really nice like this, all soft. He tied Harry's tie, took a step back and smiled satisfied. "There you go," he said nodding, "Someday I will teach you child how to do this."
"Harry, please listen to us.", Granger said. Draco hoped Potter was annoyed and angry and he would find out soon.
Harry nodded. "She did. But what if she gets mad at Malfoy? I mean maybe she doesn't want him to have anything to do with me?"
Malfoy nodded enthusiastically and filled his mouth again. Harry felt pride and happiness filling himself up. He suspected it wasn't easy to please Malfoy because of all the high expectations he had and all the great things he as a part of the Malfoy-family was used to.
Malfoy turned his back to them again and emptied the glass. "Another one." He said to the bartender, who sighed and filled the glass again with what Harry could see was a single-malt whiskey.
"No, I've got everything on Hermione's list." Harry heard him shout from the living room. Hermione hugged Harry as a goodbye and he stepped out the door.
A while later, Malfoy was asleep. Harry smiled gently. He had missed lunchtime, but Harry didn't want to leave Malfoy asleep all alone and not be there when he woke up. So Harry stayed upstairs, happy to have someone to stay upstairs for. He realized that neither Hermione nor anyone else had knocked or come in or disturbed the two boys in any way. Harry didn't know why, but he was glad. He thought that maybe they were expecting Harry and Malfoy to fight. Whatever the reason was, Harry really enjoyed having silence and Malfoy next to him.
Harry looked at Hermione, who had a curious look in her eyes. Harry thought for a second. Did he like Malfoy?
Malfoy looked Harry in the eyes and Harry noticed a single tear rolling down his cheek. His heart was tap dancing, as Harry lifted his cold hand and cupped Malfoy's face with it. Harry wiped his thumb over Malfoy's cheek and dried the tear. And then, Harry felt a new-born connection between himself and the boy next to him.
Draco's eyes met Potter's and Draco leaned forward gently capturing Potter's lips in his own. He nibbled at Potter's lips, and twirled his tongue against Potter's as their mouths opened.
"Good.", Harry smiled and they went up to Ron's room, which he had to share with an annoying Hufflepuff who desperately wanted to be Ron's friend so he could hang out with Harry and who gave Ron cookies every morning and Ron actually liked him a bit, but only because of the cookies.
Down in the kitchens, Draco told the house elves they should pack in the food so he could eat in the first floor in the hospital wing.
"Three." Answered all four of them and Potter pressed the button with the number "3" and the one with "10".
Harry nodded impressed. Was this really Draco Malfoy talking? Judging by the faces of the others, they must be thinking the same thing.
"Say it again.", Draco said. Harry knew what he meant, but he didn't know if he was supposed to say it again, or if Draco would strangle him. But then, Harry saw a glint in Draco's eye and he said it again.
The minister of Magic hit with the gavel on his desk and the whole room got filled with silence. Draco and his mother sat down and Potter sat next to Narcissa. A door on the back of the courtroom opened and two people brought in a third stool, where a man sat upon. Draco immediately recognised his father's silver hair, that wasn't shining like it once did. Lucius was chained to the stool with magical cuffs on his hands and feet. Draco was shocked when he saw his father. This is what Potter had done. This and nothing else.
It was this unbearably quiet for about half an hour. Draco was sunken into his book and Potter was still working on his essay. Sometimes Draco thought he saw Potter turning around and looking at him, but Draco was sure he had just imagined it since he wasn't even that special to Potter. When Potter had finished his essay, he stuffed everything back into his bag and got up.
"He makes my knees feel weak and he makes my throat get dry. I don't know if I want this or if I'm ready for this or if I'll ever be?" Potter said.
He shouldn't fall in love with this stupid guy. That wasn't part of the plan. But Draco was tired of plans too.
Draco only shook his head. He raised his hand and Harry saw that his fingers were trembling more than ever before. Harry raised his own hand too and his fingers shook at least as much as Draco's did. Draco slowly moved his trembling hand towards Harry's prick, that jerked with interest at the touch. Harry took a deep, long breath. Draco conjured some lube over his hands and slowly bent over Harry.
He cried out of desperation because he didn't know how he should solve this with Draco. Harry cried. He cried a long time.
"He asked me what I see in you and I told him. Then, I should give him a reason why he should let me date you and I told him. And he said it was fine and I should go to you.", Harry said proudly.
"He could have thought about that before he forced me to live with and serve a man I was scared of since I was little.", Draco answered bitter.
He didn't want to hear Granger talking about Potter like this. She looked at him, her eyes wide open in sudden shock.
Harry laughed and left. Malfoy closed the door behind him and locked it, what made Harry grin. Harry took out his own uniform and got dressed. Just when he tried to tie his tie, Malfoy stepped out of the bathroom. Unlike than Harry's, Malfoy's tie was perfectly tied, his shirt was tucked into his trousers and those were perfectly straightened.
Harry remembered the dreams he had had about Voldemort when he had still been alive, not knowing it had been actually happening. Harry sipped at his hot chocolate and wiped his face with the back of his hand. He still couldn't believe what had happened. They really got into a fight - and a bad one, one might add.
"Goodness, Potter keep it to yourself," Malfoy only said annoyed and closed the magazine. He grabbed something from his closet and vanished into the bathroom.
Harry nodded, but then realized Draco couldn't see him. "Yeah." Harry started to cry, but he tried to keep his voice steady so Draco wouldn't notice anything. "Yeah, he was the one. He was my dad's best friend and very quickly he was mine, too. We were going to live together."
"Get out of my sight, Potter.", Draco said and waved him away. He was shocked to sound that mean. Potter grunted.
Malfoy didn't answer, but he held the eye contact. Harry's hand twitched and he hesitated, but then took Malfoy's cold and still shaking hands. Malfoy twitched himself a bit, but he didn't pull his hands away - he must have figured that it wouldn't stop Harry from taking them again.
This morning, as they walked down to the kitchens, many students were shooting him and Potter looks that made even Draco flinch and he had had to see these faces for seven years already.
"Well, I thought about this for a very long time  and I think it's for the best to leave him with the Weasley's. Molly and Arthur are used to having so many children and a little baby and Ginny was quite delighted when she found out she was going to have a little sibling, for she is the youngest of the Weasley's."
"Hermione, I want you to know that I do this because, as you already know, because I am deeply in love and I want you not to freak out. Please.", Harry said and after Hermione nodded agreeing, he continued.
Malfoy nodded again and they both sat in silence for a minute and thought of what had happened next.
After a long staring contest, Harry said, "Anyways, I'm really sorry and I just want you to feel better again and I hope you can forgive me and maybe trust me again."
"Um, Draco...", he said and pointed at the four blue spots on each side of Draco's hip, that came from last night.
So Harry thought he would start with a casual opening. "You won't believe it," he said to get Ron's attention, "I'm with Malfoy."
"You can put your stuff here." Malfoy said with a short look at Harry's bag and added "Even though you didn't bring much as I see."
Draco looked at Theo, who raised an eyebrow. Draco didn't know why he didn't want to open the letter. He guessed it must have something to do with the things Weasley had said. Draco grunted. He'd never thought that something Weasley said would bother him that much. And now he actually was afraid that Potter would think it would be best if Draco wouldn't come. How did it happen that Draco was afraid of something as silly as this?
Draco rolled his eyes. As she turned her back on him and started talking to Theo and her friends, Draco wasn't offended at all. This was exactly what he was used to.
"Right?! When my dad showed me this television-thing I wasn't really impressed, but Hermione showed me a lot of movies and now that I live with her and Harry, we watch a lot." Harry heard Ron say.
Ron turned to look at Theo. "How did we never realize earlier that they had a thing for each other?"
The rain had passed as Harry, Ron and Hermione drove to King's Cross the next morning and Harry felt a fluttering sensation in his stomach. It has been too long since he had been on the Hogwarts Express. Ron and Harry have asked specifically to ride the train, because they were getting sentimental. Hermione and her trunk and cat went first through the wall, Ron and Harry followed. Platform 9¾ was usually crowded with loads and loads of students and their parents and a lot of familiar faces.
"If you're not going to tell me, then don't mention it.", Malfoy said and continued unpacking his own trunk.
As soon as the door was closed, he was pinned against the wall by Draco, who kissed him harshly. Harry felt a strand of blond hair falling loose from Draco's hairdo, that was all geled back. Harry smiled, as the strand tickled is nose and pulled it back behind Draco's ear. Draco was incredibly good at kissing, maybe that's why Harry wanted to do it again and again, until he was old. Did Draco practise? With who? Not Parkinson, right? That would be completely- He had been with them today. But he was good at kissing at the lake, too. Did she- no. That was...
. But there was no point in avoiding a question that had to be asked at some point. Malfoy had to know what he was going into and he had to be sure about that, because Harry was.
"They came with me, yes. But they were all gone ten minutes after we came. Blaise was off with some big breasted bartender."
Harry then caught up with him and pinned him against the wall again. Draco spun them around and smirked again.
But Harry couldn't sleep. He was too excited about everything that had happened that day. They almost hadn't fought, they had kissed - twice - what made up for the fighting, Malfoy had cried, and now they cuddled. This was a big step for them, considering how they behaved around each other before the war. Harry yawned widely and carefully leaned his head against Malfoy's. Harry closed his eyes , took a deep breath and slowly dozed off.
After he had seen Harry with this stupid bitch, he ran back to their room and broke together on the floor crying.
She nodded, put pen and clipboard away and walked into the room, leaving Harry alone put in the hall again. But not for long, because Malfoy came out just seconds later. He didn't even stop to look at Harry, he just walked straight past him.
Harry smiled. Hermione and the others watched Harry and Draco with curious looks. Seamus and Dean are kind of a couple, they hold hands secretly, but they never came out over the Daily Prophet and never shared open kisses or something. No one apart from their closest friends knew about them. And not even they knew, if it was something serious between the two of them. So even these two were quite interested in Harry and Draco's relationship. Was Harry supposed to use the word now? Anyways, half of the students in the hall were now looking at the seven Gryffindors and the one Slytherin, standing in the doors of the Hall. Harry smiled at Draco encouragingly and Draco smiled back weakly.
"I know." Harry said more calmly too, "But I also know it's hard enough for him, even without you making him feel guilty."
Ron nodded understanding. "Okay, let's do it." And he shoved another fork filled with food in his mouth.
Harry walked over to him and saw, what made Draco that scared. He held a big, red howler in his hands.
Harry nodded slowly. So Malfoy was going to stay the night. Okay. He didn't know what he'd expected. He didn't think Malfoy would leave his mother here, but Harry guessed he had somehow hoped that Malfoy would.
Harry and Malfoy made their way towards the hut and a sweet scent filled their noses. Harry smiled. This was Christmas. Harry ordered two caramel apples and gave one to Malfoy. Harry smiled.
It has been Ron's idea to have Malfoy come over for dinner and to order a pizza, because he said without Hermione here they could use some company. So they sat together and ate and actually had a pretty decent time. Harry figured without Hermione, Ron had to talk to someone and he knew that.
Malfoy didn't answer. He looked back at his hands with an ashamed look on his face. Harry smiled sadly at the confused boy in front of him. How could his family have messed him up this much?
And she stormed back out of the library. Harry and Ron looked at each other and Ron shrugged. Harry smiled awkwardly at Madame Pince and the two boys followed Hermione. In the corridor, Luna and Neville passed their way and walked with Ron and Harry.
"Is it true? Is it really true? Kreacher is not being tricked by his own eyes, is he?", he asked and rubbed his eyes. Draco laughed.
Ron and Harry only nodded courtly and when she turned her back on them, they rolled their eyes and snickered. Inside the bookstore it was even hotter than outside. Ron immediately started whining and said he wanted to get back outside, or at least somewhere it wasn't 50 degrees.
Ginny stood up too and the four of them stood close to Draco, Harry had his wand at the ready. Draco smirked evil at Dean and Seamus, who went pale. Draco turned around to Harry and smiled.
Draco took out his wand and conjured stones to fly into the water. Suddenly, it came to his mind that he had to tell Weasley and Granger about Potter.
"That's why I hate you," Malfoy said, "Why are you so forgiving? Why are you so fucking nice? That's annoying, Potter!"
Harry nodded. "Still, everyone accused me and I didn't have anyone to talk to than my friends, who looked at me like I was going insane." Harry waited for a moment to look at Malcolm. "But do you really think that petrifying people in the whole school is as bad as being in the same house as Voldemort?"
After a while, Neville and Seamus joined them, neither Harry or Ron talked to them. They put on their pyjamas and slipped under their blankets silently. Ron flicked his wand and the lights extinguished. Harry rolled his eyes and tried to sleep.
She checked the temperature of his forehead, she checked his pulse and poured him in a bit of this potion. He drank it, shivered and Madame Pomfrey nodded.
"I believe you do know." Potter glanced at Draco, who was so sick and tired of Potter's shit. "You can tell me," Potter said.
"Yeah, well, I'd say I go see my friends and when I have enough of them, I come and see you.", Draco smiled.
Harry was surprised and lost for words when he opened the door. Malfoy stood on the doorstep in the rain, he had dark circles under his bloodshot eyes and a stubbly blonde beard was visible on his face. Harry furrowed his brow. He cleared his throat and needed to gather the thoughts in his head. What was Malfoy doing here?
Harry looked at him. He knew what it was Malfoy couldn't say: after Lucius had died. Harry nodded understanding, signaling Malfoy he didn't have to continue.
"Why should I?" Harry asked, his voice getting louder. His short temper has always been kind of a problem for Harry. "I didn't know you were coming over."
Harry sighed. It was really nice of her to say this. Ron didn't say anything, and even though Harry knew he didn't have anything nice to say about this, he still asked for his opinion.
"Now I know. Everything went so fast and I had no time of thinking that it would probably be only a joke or not on purpose and-"
"I'm going to the birthday party of my boyfriend's best friend. They're all pretty classy and haughty, so I don't want to look sloppy. That's what I'm here for."
He didn't move, he didn't blink, he just breathed in and out soundless. Draco sat down on the edge of the bed and took Potter's hand. She was cold and Draco held her so long until she got warm.
"Yes?" The healer came over to the three boys standing in front of Draco's door with worried looks, "Can I help you?"
Draco nodded unimpressed and lit a cigarette. If he would tell Theo where he'd been after midnight Theo would flip.
"This is Draco.", Narcissa told Harry, pointing at a picture with a small boy, who was laughing happily.
"And there was the thing with your father. I read about it in the Prophet." Blaise interrupted Draco.
Still thinking about what Malfoy had offered him, Harry drifted off to sleep, where he was haunted by Voldemort once again, this time having Draco at his side. Voldemort's rotted hand lay on Malfoy's shoulder, an evil smile on his lipless mouth. Also Malfoy had a grin on his lips, the one he used to throw at Harry and his friends whenever something happened to them. Squirming in his sleep, Harry couldn't get to wake himself up. He had to listen to Voldemort laugh at him, Bellatrix Lestrange appeared, laughing, saying that she had killed Sirius Black. Harry felt anger inside him. The snake, Voldemort's red eyes, Bellatrix's laugh, Malfoy.
Draco wanted to unwrap his towel when he heard something. It sounded like someone was moving beneath a blanket. In shock, Draco turned to look at Potter's bed and found the idiot staring at him.
Draco smiled absently. He remembered leaving Dobby small portions of food all around the house so he wouldn't starve. And he remembered how he had bought a shirt for him, but his mother had told him Dobby wasn't allowed to get anything.
All Draco had to do was renounce the kisses and let go of Potter, but that simply wasn't an option. Draco's grip around Potter's waist intensified at the very thought.
Malcolm had left the office with his head held high. Harry was proud of him to have resolved such a big issue, but then there came someone he knew through the door. Romilda Vane. Harry had had quite a history with Romilda, she had started at Hogwarts when Harry had been in third year and he remembered vividly how she had tried to give him a love potion, but Ron had eaten it accidentally in his sixth year.
He kept laughing more quiet, but Harry grinned as well. They talked and laughed for a while and the stuff with Draco's father and the tournament and Voldemort seemed forgotten. Then, the portrait opened, what Harry had only noticed, when Hermione and Ron looked at each other and the other Gryffindors started whispering.
"No. You know what, Potter? You're an asshole! You could never know how I feel. I have never had anyone before. Not one girl and especially no boy. I was raised in a very strict house. I wasn't and I'm still not allowed to have
Dobby sprinted towards Harry as soon as he saw him, but as Draco entered the kitchen behind him, Dobby stopped. Draco smiled nervously.
"Sure. Sit," he said once he gathered himself, "Not that this was an order, just an offer," he added, afraid that Draco might freak out.
Harry laughed. Draco knew he hadn't found it funny back then, but he was glad they could laugh about it now. He stared at the fire and smiled into his mug.
Harry grabbed a sharpie himself - pink - and drew a heart next to the Mark, showing Teddy he was allowed to do that. Teddy played close attention to the movement of Harry's pen, yet couldn't mimic it. He didn't paint a random jumble of lines though - Teddy drew careful circles and several lines that looked like they were supposed to be something, but weren't actually. It was abstract art. Harry drew some flowers and another heart. Teddy looked at him with big eyes and held the sharpie up high. Harry smiled, took it from him and put on the cap. He wasn't sure how Draco would react when he would wake up and find his Dark Mark painted on.
"I had a sister who was just like him. And then, she married this filth of a Potter and had a child. And he was just as abnormal as they were!"
"I also want to have children. I already have a godson who I take care of most of the time and I love him so much. But I would really love to have one with shining silver hair and dangerously pale skin. I would really love to have a child that is the spitting image of you," Potter said and Draco could see in his green eyes that he really hoped for Draco not to freak out.
Draco spun Harry around, so he lay on top of him, and did the same biting and sucking at Harry's collarbone.
Draco noticed the repulsive undertone the healer used as she said the word "boyfriend" and a shiver went down Draco's spine.
He had to pull Malfoy's arm a little to make him move again, but they entered and it wasn't as bad as Draco would have thought. Harry grabbed a basket and they went around filling it more and more. Harry met Miss Williams in the vegetable section and they held a little chit-chat until Draco called for help from the canned goods aisle. Finally at the cash desk, Harry and Draco unloaded their stuff.
"He- umm..." Harry wasn't very good at lying. But suddenly, something good came to his mind, "Apparently he was annoyed by me because of something stupid I don't even know about and then he just said I was so stupid and he would want to fight me."
Malfoy's jaw dropped. "Potter, if I'd have known this was of such value to you, I never would have taken it."
"Told me my parents died in a car crash and I wasn't allowed to ask about them. Locked me in a cupboard." Draco could see Potter swallowing and the finger at his glass began to shake. "I didn't know I was a wizard till I was eleven. They didn't want me going to Hogwarts. Told me I was a freak just as my parents."
"Do you still live with your mother?" Harry asked and bit his lip, hoping Malfoy wouldn't take it the wrong way.
They all gathered around the table as Mrs Weasley and Ginny levitated the food and placed it in the centre of the table. Hungry silence filled the room when everyone started to eat and Harry took the time to look around. Everyone was putting on happy faces, but he was almost one hundred percent sure none of them were as happy as they pretended, not even Harry himself. They all had their demons that visited them at night, if it was the corpse of their family member or of their loved one, or if it was a Death Eater or if it was - as in Harry's case - Voldemort.
Ron sighed and scratched his nose. "Then we could go by Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Haven't seen Fred in a while."
and Harry got himself a new set of Snitches to practice with. It had been nice to see George again even though he didn't have much time to talk since the joke shop was as busy as ever. Teddy was fast asleep upstairs when Harry, Ron and Luna fell down onto the sofa and put their feet on the small table. Ron lit the fire in the fireplace by a flick of his wand and they all shivered. Just when Harry thought everything in his life was going great, an owl flew against the living room window.
"I hated every second I had to sit at one table with him, I hated it when he touched me with his cold, dead fingers, I hated the way he talked, I hated everything about it. But I was afraid, I wanted to make my parents proud, I wanted to make my father proud."
Ron kissed Hermione on the cheek and she grinned. She kissed him on the lips and Harry rolled his eyes, sipped his Butterbeer and looked around.
"So, how is your year going so far?" She asked. Harry got the feeling that she knew. It was like with Dumbledore - he had always used to give Harry the feeling that he had known everything. Harry smiled.
"Don't you dare ever coming back!", Vernon shouted after them, as Draco grabbed Potter's arm and they disapparated back to their home.
The others looked at him and then at each other and continued eating, so did Harry. Every now and then, he looked up at Malfoy, who was now eating and talking to Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy turned his head and looked at Harry. His cheeks got at least as red as Harry's were and Malfoy looked away again. Harry stabbed his meat with his fork aggressively. Hermione opened her mouth to say something, but he shot her a hard look and she closed her mouth again.
Harry nodded while sipping his refreshing lemonade. He swallowed and smiled at the prickly feeling in his throat.
Draco nodded, but Harry could see he was thinking about something. Finally, Draco slowly shook his head and Harry furrowed his brow confused.
. Harry wasn't sure if he was going to return as well. Everyone hated him there and Harry knew it, but maybe his friends were coming back as well, so Malfoy wouldn't be alone. But what if... Harry didn't even dare to bring this thought to an end. What if he and Malfoy were going to be paired as roommates? Harry shuddered. Living with Malfoy for a whole year must be a nightmare. Or maybe... no. It would be a nightmare. Harry was sure about that. Even though Harry didn't like to admit it to himself, Malfoy hated him and that was it. There wasn't a chance these two were going to get along too well. After at least a week one of them would be dead.
"The question is do you really want to take care of a Malfoy chained to a bed for a week? And I didn't mean chained like
After Harry had ruined his potion, he had no time to start a second one, so he had nothing to present Snape at the end of the lesson.
In the evening, when Draco felt the need to eat something, he closed his book, that he had almost finished, and put it on his bedside table. He decided that he needed to look
Harry smiled to himself and made his way to Ron's room, which he shared with a Hufflepuff. Harry knocked at the door.
Ron had went to the Yule Ball with her, not because he had wanted to, but because he had needed a partner and Padma and her sister Parvati had been the only girls left.
Harry furrowed his brow and watched as everyone turned their heads to the big doors. They opened and little Teddy stood on his own two feet in the Entrance Hall, holding a small black pillow in his hands. Harry clapped a hand in front of his mouth in surprise. Teddy staggered a little down the aisle, balancing the pillow carefully. Harry was so proud to see Teddy taking his first few steps on his wedding day. Teddy's hair was black but his eyes were grey, a perfect mixture of Harry and Draco. Andromeda got up and helped Teddy walk along the aisle. When the child got up to them, he held up the pillow so the groom's could take the rings. Hermione grabbed Teddy and held him in her arms as she took a atep back in line with the others.
Harry looked at him and sucked in every movement Malfoy made. His long, blond eyelashes closed and opened slowly, revealing and hiding his beautiful, shining grey eyes. Malfoy rubbed with the back of his pale hand against his pale cheek. Harry couldn't hold it anymore. If he wouldn't ask Malfoy now, he would explode.
"Are you okay?" Malfoy asked when he saw Harry, who nodded wordlessly. "You sure?" Malfoy asked, put the food on the table and sat down next to Harry. "You feel hot," Malfoy said and Harry had to hold back another cough.
"Don't worry, I'll be there.", Harry said, "And if they are stupid, I'm coming over and punching them into the face."
Draco looked up. Potter was standing in front of him, he was fully dressed and seemed to have showered already.
"Hermione, I know more about him than you think.", Harry finally answered. Hermione rolled her eyes.
Harry shook his head. "His grandmother wanted to have him for Christmas Eve, so I can have him for Christmas Day."
Malfoy led Harry into Honeydukes. Harry loved this store. It smelled like sweets and everything was bright and happy. Malfoy walked over to a shelf with lollipops. He took one with the shape of a heart and one that looked like a bat. Harry watched him, his slim fingers wrapped around the stem of the lollipop. Harry's eyes moved up to Malfoy's face. He looked at the sweets in his hand and blinked. To Harry it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion. Malfoy turned his head and looked at Harry. They looked each other deep in the eye and something in Harry was starting to prickle. It felt weird and yet good.
Harry laughed and gave him a quick kiss on his cheek and left with the others to the Gryffindor table, leaving Draco standing there for a moment, now all eyes on him, and he set off for his own house table.
So Harry took the toast with slightly shaking fingers and lifted it to his mouth, what took him all the strength he had left in him. The first bite made him feel sick, but the feeling vanished with every bite he took. Hermione smiled and nodded satisfied. Harry looked away. He wasn't really in the mood to make jokes and he refused to feel good in any other way.
He and Dean were the perfect entertainers. The whole crowd laughed and shouted names of teachers. The first thought that came into Harry's mind was Snape, but it would be really disrespectful to say something like that - also in front of Malfoy.
"That's what I thought," Draco said nodding, "Now if you'll excuse us, we have to get this celebrity into bed."
Harry narrowed his eyes, but let Ron go. Something was definitely off. Harry followed Ron to the living room and joined his friends on the sofa. They played a few games of Wizards Chess until the sun slowly but surely went down. Malfoy was determined to look casual tonight and to Harry's utter surprise, he asked him to help with that. Harry was more than happy to do so. When they got upstairs, however, they didn't look for an outfit for Draco. Harry was thrown backwards on the bed and Malfoy sat on his hip. Harry grinned. They were so cheesy.
This was so embarrassing. Harry looked at Malfoy, who nodded enthusiastically. Harry had never seen him like this - like no one around him would matter. And so Harry started to dance as well. They weren't good dancers, but it was a lot of fun. Harry forgot how many people were looking at him, he just kept his eyes on Malfoy.
"Merry Christmas, Potter." Draco cupped Harry's cheeks with his warm hands. Harry could feel Draco shaking.
"I woke up every time you moved just a little bit, so I can wake you up when you have a nightmare. Unfortunately, you shift a lot when you're sleeping even if you're not having a bad dream."
"So, it is true then.", Draco Malfoy said, his arms crossed in front of his chest and his eyes narrowed. He glared at Harry Potter.
"Tomorrow we will contact you as soon as she is awake and ready to be visited again." The healer finished.
With that, Ron pulled Hermione away and they left Harry and Malfoy alone. Malfoy glared at Harry with a slight smirk.
He opened his mouth and slowly sucked the head, twirling his tongue around the sensitive corona. Draco gasped and thrust his hips upwards, threading his fingers through Potter's hair. Potter's head bobbed up and down faster and faster as he took Draco's prick in and out, deeper and deeper into the suction of his mouth.
"I hate you, I hate you, I HATE YOU!", he screamed and punched the pillow into his face. He didn't hate Potter. He hated himself.
"I feel weird being back here" Malfoy said scratching his head, "after what happened the last time."
The goal is that, should anything bad happen, I should be ready to run at a moment’s notice, with Harry at my side, and not be useless baggage that needs looking after. Fuck, I even agreed to this, believing that about myself and wanting to change it, even while Harry protested that it wasn’t true, but I never imagined anything as specific as my whole body hurting while I flop into bed every night!
Harry’s voice was as cold as ice. Very real outrage was fluttering at the edge of his nerves, and it was with great effort that he controlled his voice in front of the class.
Harry let loose a second later, savoring the slick friction between their bodies while he further soaked their joined hips with seed.
I can’t help looking at him at breakfast. The look on my face must be like murder. I wish someone would just kill him now and make the potential problems go away. No one does. The fucker stares down the first person to even hint at giving him grief. Those fucking eyes! People know he’s serious, but quiet, with danger just beneath the surface, waiting to explode. The other guy backs down. A point for Green-Eyes, but that kind of shit just piques Flint’s interest. Eyes and attitude don’t scare Flint. Nothing does. He lives up to his name. He’s a rock, and nothing can scare a rock. It’ll really be between the two of them, and Flint always wins. Always. At least…he’d better. I don’t want this. I want to be somewhere else, but there’s nowhere else to go. That’s why they call it prison. I have to watch this insanity unfold. I hate him. If a look could kill, his ass would be dead and buried.
It was surreal, until Harry's voice cut through the fog of Draco's bemusement and asked, "How do you take your tea? I never asked."
Soon, he would leave the relative safety of Hogwarts, and spend his time with the Order at Grimmaud Place plotting the next steps in the war against Voldemort. There, he might be able to escape the occasional sight of Draco, but he could never escape the memories.
Getting anything significant done in Chicago, from knocking a building down to starting construction on a new one, from zoning a business to acquiring a license to get started with one, took money. Not just a little money, but a lot of money. Just the bribes for mid-level officials and permission from organized crime in the area demanded a small fortune, but Tom Riddle had that. That wasn’t the point.
“Good man, MacNair. Get me to my office. I’ve a few calls to make. I want Asian currency stronger by the end of the week. It’s time to pull some strings. And bring me a brandy. Not the swill I keep out for company…the dusty bottle in the back of the cabinet. I’ll make something productive of this day yet!”
Breakfast was fun, with jubilant, laughing, and occasionally embarrassed students everywhere. Harry scanned the room, trying to stay casual, and there was no Draco in sight. Relieved, yet oddly disappointed, he took his seat and piled in to the potatoes and sausages. Ten minutes later, he realized everyone, save Draco, was present.
Harry fought his racing heart in silence. Just the memory of the event that had triggered Draco’s collapse was more than he was comfortable with. The notion of using Parseltongue on Draco again violated every promise he’d ever made to himself about never exploiting Draco’s weakness for his own personal gain. Draco waited until he was sure of Harry’s silence, and then started again.
I let a whiff of irritation flow from me, shoulders tight, neck a little strained, voice hinting at a person almost afraid of showing a part of themselves they hold dear and never share. He asked why I spend ‘so much’ time…and even if he doesn’t know it, he’s given away that he’s been spying upon me.
When Mr. White first suspected that his own pupil had become a well-connected criminal, he took steps to balk and curb Riddle’s growing power, only to learn that Riddle’s financial ties were so powerful that most of the people that might have able to exercise some authority against him…were already influenced by their profitable dealings with Riddle. Mr. White retired from the public view and the intelligence service, and concentrated on building a rival network, composed of and funded by like-minded people who feared Riddle’s meteoric rise to power and his grossly unethical methods.
“Come on…pull the other one! I know you’re kidding me! That’s the most spurious logic I’ve ever heard you utter out loud…and that’s saying something!”
A minute, maybe two, and he makes a noise like a groan, tensing like a man who is unloading his come into a skillful mouth. He steps back and fumbles with his fly in a way that, from the view of anyone outside of this cell, looks like he’s relaxed and just a bit sensitive after orgasm. I’m just hunched on the edge of the bed, wondering what the fuck is going on. Then he whispers one last time.
Among his trainees was a pupil so gifted that even Mr. White was duly impressed. That candidate was Tom Riddle. Shortly before what we consider the end of the Cold War, and the eventual changes to the formerly Soviet Union, Tom Riddle, who had spent years proving his talent for international manipulation, making contacts and consolidating his power, resigned his commission and retired from the intelligence service. He’d used his considerable influence to ensure that his financial choices worked out well, and his fortune is comparable to Mr. White’s own. Tom Riddle made allies in nearly every country around the globe, mostly industrialists and financiers. He is a silent partner in hundreds of enterprises around the globe, and by carefully hiding his involvement but retaining access to offshore accounts, he stays off the popular lists that catalog wealthy citizens of the world. More than cash, what he has is clout.
It hadn’t been half as bad as locker room talk had suggested. He’d never imagined that, as a Malfoy, he would kneel before another, much less Harry Potter, and then grant oral favors to said person. But it was an enlightening experience to say the least.
“Absolutely not! I haven’t even been told what happened, or where my daughter is yet. I haven’t any idea how she might have come to harm. You said it was an accident of some kind…and that’s all I know.”
Rumors flew fast and furious from Slytherin in the days that followed, and however carefully Harry may have hidden his interest, he was listening and watching for every detail, and what he heard and saw kept his rapt attention.
Tough question. He sounds so calm about it. He’d kill for me, just to give me revenge on the man that nearly ruined my life, and could have gotten me killed. I don’t want death on my hands. Not even for this. Maybe he’d die in jail, but turning Harry loose on him would be just like killing him myself. As clear as if I’d pulled the trigger on a living gun. No…I don’t want that.
“No. No. Don’t even go there. I forgot nothing, but I know things you couldn’t have guessed at, and I admit I never shared them. Not until now! Draco deserves this being said aloud. The only thing he ever cared about was keeping his parents alive. Voldemort made a sick prank out of keeping his parents hostage for Lucius’ fuck ups. Draco got Marked and handed a suicide mission because Voldemort expected to kill his parents anyway. As much of a shit as Lucius was, Draco tried to save them. All he ever wanted was to have his family back, and he sacrificed his life and his reputation to get them. He wound up watching them die anyway. That’s why he came to our side. He never asked for forgiveness, because even he didn’t think he deserved it. He just came, did what was asked of him by the Order, and waited for the world to end.
Harry pulled a hand from Draco’s waist and slid it down his chest, bemused by the sight in front of him. There was no question that this was right, but it was still strange to see a flat and definitely male chest in front of him, sweat slick and heaving with urgency. And then there was the swollen and needy prick that twitched restlessly, just inches from where his own body met Draco’s. Alien. It wasn’t as if a few boys hadn’t had ’the horn’ in school years ago, but he’d never been so intimately involved in the process. It was one thing to hear someone tugging at themselves in the bed next to you…it was another to be in the bed with them, the cause of the excitement!
“Please…don’t worry for me. It’s…it’s nothing. There’s nothing you can do. I’m beyond help, Potter.”
I have some self hatred issues. Still sort of working them all out. Also, some aggression problems. I tend to punch first and talk later. Not a great combination for a person whose name is suddenly back in the limelight. I've lived enduring violence for so long that it's hard to forget it all and act like other people do. Anyone hurts me, in anyway, and I want to hurt them, immediately. I suppose I'll be working on this for a long while.
That’s what brings us here. The Enigma Corporation is quietly backing the renovation of huge sections of downtown Chicago, primarily to build and cement relationships with local crime lords and politicians. It doesn’t matter to Riddle if the project is ever finished, what matters is the connections he establishes and the influence he gains. The millions of dollars in property sales and development is mostly irrelevant. We’re here to spoil his deal, make working with his company a known liability, and frustrate him into making an error that we can exploit.
“How many things can you do? I never really knew a doctor before. Did you specialize in scar removal?”
It was infuriating, having this held over him this way, but Draco nodded quietly. The old man had agreed to hold Harry’s secrets, and he seemed kindly enough, or at least uninterested in personal gain. It would have to be enough. If he was to stay, this was the cost, and he would pay it.
“Oh, Pans…for whatever reason would I simply give away a secret, even to you, my dearest…especially when its as delicious as this one! So much potential for mayhem…I can barely contain myself. Maybe I should share it, and let our matched wits find a way to make the use of it the stuff of legends…but it simply isn’t done…the giving away of precious information for free.”
Self respect was a fine thing, Harry thought, but it had a price of its own as well. He was lonely. Not for friends…he had those and loved them dearly. He was lonely for Draco’s touch, and in a way he hadn’t expected, given that the past several months had involved seeing Draco every night.
Draco slipped his robe on over his uniform and adjusted his badge, then strolled away in perfect calm. Harry sighed softly with relief, letting his breathing return to normal, hoping he could get on with a cool bath and a decent night’s sleep. He stared studiously at the mirror as Draco sauntered away. Draco turned just before he reached the entryway.
I won’t stuff myself or anything, but I mean to eat well and enjoy it again. Ron leads the way and picks the table, sitting with his back against the wall so he can watch the room. I know just a few phrases in Cantonese, and they’re all related to ordering dinner. I aim for spicy, and I ask Ron if he wants anything. He settles for letting me order some noodles and a cup of tea. He’s too on the job to concentrate on food. Good for me, because I feel safer with a large and dangerous man near me, even if he might bury me in concrete for doing anything too stupid. Silly? Maybe…but it beats panicking over it all.
“Ha…my…greatest desire. That’s…that’s what it is? What if that’s better than what I have? It makes sense…that something…like this…would be a lie. It…feels so…good. I can hear…feel…what it means…I don’t…I don’t want to go anymore.”
That...that's when things got...strange. Or stranger. I suppose all of this is odd enough looked at from your point of view, Granger. I hadn't realized anything was going on...but I think...I think I was approaching something like contentment. When you're around someone that much, every night, for hours at the least, and you get used to them being there...you get...comfortable. You talk. A little small talk here or there, a few words that aren't strictly about business or sexual demands.
“Oooo-kayyy. I owe them all for even contemplating doing this. I know it’s only possible because Blaise is ’connected’…and because of you, so if it means chatting while I look like this, so be it.”
“You’re adorable, we’ll put a sheet over most of you if you like, and it’s hard to get her away from the computers for more than a couple hours at a time. She takes breaks for sleep and food, but she’s usually monitoring several things at the same time. It’s amazing what she can do, but there are limits to her time. She’ll be here in a few hours. I’ll make it up to you later. We can curl up, with you on your good side, and watch a movie…or I could read to you like I did last night.”
"Maybe it is pathetic, but when I had to work to keep you from leaving...it was more effort than I've ever put forward for anyone...or anything. Maybe it makes you uncomfortable...but you made me feel things I've never felt before. I felt...good. Contented. Like I had what I wanted and I didn't need anything else. I just...the way I've lived my life...the way we met...I wish I could erase all that, but I can't. Wishing is for idiots...and you've made me that kind of idiot."
“No idea what you’re even talking about. You must have soaked up one too many cocktails last night.”
“I got it in prison. I was branded with a hot wire for sassing my owner. He didn’t like being talked back to by his own prison bitch, so kicking the shit out of me and burning a capital ‘F’ into my ass seemed like a good way to remind me of who was in charge. I suppose it worked, but at least I’m rid of the fucking thing now.”
Draco was still having trouble forming words, and just dragged Potter down to the ground where they could lie and snog for awhile. Harry was a perfect gentleman once again...and lived up to his end of the deal. the clothes were transformed back to normal, and a slightly dazed Draco wandered his way back to Slytherin House with a stupid grin plastered on his face that he couldn't control. Win. Lose. If he got off like that every week...who could give a flying fig about anything else?
“Good God, man! How should I know?! I’ve never…well not that! I told you I hadn’t done all that much. Do you think I just trot around the globe having it on with whomever crosses my fancy? I’m a Malfoy, for Merlin’s sake! A sense of decorum is called for! Are you?”
“No thanks, sweetie. I’m not wearing enough to want to peel off more than I have to. I’ll keep the jacket for now.” He’d have searched that too…but there aren’t any pockets on it, and it doesn’t leave a lot to the imagination.
Ron, the driver, Harry’s ’wheel man’, answers the call on the second ring. If I feel a little awkward asking for an escort to town, I hide it well. He’s all business.
“I…I understand. It’s…I upset him. The duel…and some things I said…after. I’m…I am responsible for this. I am leaving Hogwarts. I have no right to be here. I want to see…him…before I go. I‘m just…glad he‘s alright.”
Draco had gotten Harry to dress for the occasion, and Harry had acquiesced with charming ease. Not that Harry wouldn’t dress up normally, but it wasn’t as much of a thrill for him as it was for Draco. What Harry did like, was the way Draco responded to seeing his lover in formal wear. That was worth any inconvenience.
The first thing he saw, albeit somewhat blurrily for lack of his glasses, was Draco Malfoy looking down at him in vague annoyance when he emerged.
Harry sat bolt upright in his bed, gasping for breath. He wasn’t afraid, but only apprehensive. He fumbled for his glasses at the small table beside the bed, knocking over the near empty glass of water that lay beside them in the process.
It was the eve before James' wedding, and his son was in high spirits before the bachelor's festivities were due to begin, and, being the only Hufflepuff Malfoy in a thousand years, Draco wasn't especially worried about James misbehaving even under duress or temptation. James was decent through and through, and Draco never doubted that. It was just that he'd kept his secrets well, like a Slytherin ought to, and the idea of breaking a vow, even a vow to himself, seemed alien after this long a time.
Malnati’s is always busy. That’s just the way it is in one of the best pizza joints around. Ron has the place checked out and seats us near the exit, this time with his back to the wall as always. I’m in my boy clothes, which is fine, but I get a few looks because I can’t help that I ‘swish’ a little when I walk. I have never been ’butch’ or tough. It just isn’t who or what I am. I’ll fight to survive if I have to, but I know I haven’t got a chance in a brawl, because I’m too small to last more than a few seconds. Struggling makes it hurt more, and after a while, you learn to let go. For me, surviving is finding a man who is strong enough to protect me…and I think I’ve finally found that in Harry.
Draco finally had something to react to, and exploded promptly. “What the fuck kind of question is that? You know what there is to talk about! Stop playing so stupid…I know for a fact you’re not that dumb, Potter! There’s more Slytherin in you than just the parts I put there! Fucking talk to me.”
Harry pored over the pile of tomes in front of him. The unfortunate side of this hasty education in all things sensual was the way it made him blush. He may have been alone in his room, but some of the things in these books were just mind boggling!
“Not those kind of books, Hermione. I don’t need Dark magic. I could go home if I wanted those. It’s…well…it’s complicated.” She was going to make him tell it all. How utterly humiliating! He could feel his cheeks pinking…a blushing Malfoy…how pathetic.
“I am not! I-hey! What do you call inappropriate? I don’t know what you’re doing here, but you all but molested me in my sleep, then tried to snog me when I woke up and wanted you off of me! I’m the one being reasonable! You haven’t been hexed into bits yet, so stop complaining before my head explodes.”
Harry regained the power of speech just long enough to look Draco in the eyes with wild gratitude and naked lust, and almost snarled, “’S brill- brilliant. Again! Do it again.”
This is the telling moment. I must be crazy. Maybe it’s the vodka talking, or maybe it’s my conscience. (Where the hell it hid out the rest of my life I’ll never know…but it sure is back with a vengeance!) I can’t let Harry just do this for me…not when I can make it easier and less risky for everyone involved.
“Hey, Harry. My team just finished assembling the last of the equipment you wanted for this gig. Everything has been tested twice, all in working order. We’ll be going over it with Drake in a few minutes. I’m headed upstairs. See you there.”
The pair of fourth years slouched away, headed out the door and glaring daggers at each other while Harry made himself comfortable. John Prewett put away everything but his wand before leading Harry into his private room.
“Don’t act surprised! How thick can one man be? I can tell you’re peeling through way after way that this is entirely you’re fault! Poppycock! Utter nonsense! Harry, I won’t say that you haven’t done some wrong here, but more than a few people have contributed to what happened, and there isn’t one person involved who doesn’t know that! Don’t you play the martyr just to back out of facing what’s going on! Not until I’ve seen to it that you’re ready to make sound choices again.
Draco’s chin lifted, and he stared at Harry intensely, making it hard to concentrate while nervous gray eyes searched him for intent.
With that, James stood up and hugged his parent, taller than he had any right to be, and was off to his bachelor's night. Draco quietly strolled to the library of the manor, and found a shelf of private volumes that hadn't been opened in many a year. In the sleeve between two pages, a single photograph had been tucked away years before. You couldn't tell at a glance. Nothing was all that different. It was a snapshot taken of himself, Harry and an infant James. The clothing had been bulky and apportioned just so as to keep his condition hidden. To the casual observer, it was Draco and Harry, same as they had ever been, with newborn son held between them. There was a hidden truth in that picture...that no matter the shape or form, the person was the only real constant. The experiences that shaped a person weren't purely dependent on the sex of their birth...and the way in which a person saw themselves had little to do with their beginning or end. Some things simply were, without regard to flesh, or other people's perceptions of the world and how one fit in it. It would have been thought scandalous in his day, near twenty years ago...but times changed, as times were oft wont to do, and what once had been a private thing perhaps wasn't half so scandalous as he'd once imagined it was. He'd tell Harry of the conversation later. Whatever they'd kept from others, in twenty years they'd kept nothing more from each other, and never would. It was Draco's fervent hope that the same would be true for his son and his soon to be daughter-in-law. If he could have made a second wish...it would only have been for the happiness of his children and theirs.
The woman heaved and moaned, her accent European for certain, but hard to place. Her laughter echoed in darkness while her thighs flexed with pleasure. Though the man himself was hideous, she was aroused. She was stark naked, less than half his size, and seemingly totally unarmed. No guard, however well placed outside, could have guessed what was to pass between them.
Harry turned and opened the door to his office, watching as Draco rather sluggishly rose and ambled in, looking un-amused but calmer than he had been the day before. At least he wasn’t as actively insolent, but Harry was familiar with every form of teenaged slouch and sneer. He’d seen them all, and it was obvious that while Draco was covering it a bit, he was still irritable.
I knew it would come to that. He was going to ask it more directly than before. He never liked making a gesture without a certain style to it. The right time, the right words, the right ambience. He’s more polished now. Not just a high rent teenage dope pusher with a taste for good living. It’s funny. If I’d never met Harry…if I’d gotten out after seven years with nothing to my name and no future…or even if I’d just taken the two grand in that envelope and asked Ron to drop me off downtown…I’d probably say yes.
Malfoy is close enough to speak into his ear. “I’ve found that Muggles don’t have a similar understanding of personal space as we do and that this issue is best dealt with a lot of assurance when walking.”
Potter comes back for the week that follows and the entire Potter clan is summoned, ex-wife included. Draco asks Mimpsy to serve refreshment and holes himself in his office with a bottle of brandy and a lot of paperwork. When he hears the echoes of choked-up voices, he only spells the Wireless on.
When he straightens up again, there’s a blurry reflection of a phantom in the mirror. Harry turns around, and Malfoy is standing thin and worried in his strict, dark shirt. He’s  ghostly and hollow in the blue-grey light of the room.
“He knew who I was,” he gasps finally, straightening out to look Harry in the eyes. “Or he was about to figure it out. When I took so much time charming everything recognizable away.”
“Please,” he asks and reaches to call for lube. The bottle jumps into his hand and he reaches back for Draco to take it.
Potter trails after him all day long after. By midday, Draco turns into his seat to look at Potter leaning against the window and asks:
Harry James Potter dies at forty-three in the line of duty. The newspapers report a stray spell hitting him right in the chest and three days of agony spent in Saint Mungo before he passes away on a bright Saturday morning, with his family and close friends by his side.
He puts his cup down on a tower of unread books and strides to the entrance hall, feels the chalky scrapping of dust under his feet. If he strains, he can hear a heartbeat that is neither Ron’s or Hermione’s. His own sink into his chest.
He doesn’t leave a breath for Harry to answer and twists around to hail a waitress. They have a long-distance discussion about teapots from what Harry gathers from their gestures before the anthracite settles on him again.
“Maybelle Purplestock,” Ron says quietly next to him. “She confessed to everything. She was with Greyback and the other wolves during the war. She resented you for the dissolution of her pack; that’s why she attacked you. She didn’t care what happened to her, so she bought wolfsbane with all she had and set up the attack.”
“Yes, never mind. Let’s do something simple. A First Year spell maybe.” Draco takes a second to think; he’s learned from experience that something too big pushes Harry to his flight instincts, so nothing explosive or too impressive for his muggle-addled mind. “Alright, how do you feel about a Levitation spell?”
