He poked it through his shirt and wore a smile. "So am I the head of your Harry Potter Fan club?"
"No, they've been all fantastic until you bombarded my classroom," Harry answered for them.
Finally, he escaped her lessons when they had to study for a charms exam, and Draco couldn't push the urge to be mean away. He had to counteract all the hearts and rainbows that surrounded him. Just listening to all these bollocks lines of sharing 'small touches' and 'shy compliments' with someone was utterly terrifying and unbearable.
"Yes, it is. It's equal."
"Told you I could handle it. Good day, Malfoy," Harry said sarcastically. The three walked away leaving Draco smiling at his boyfriend, and turning to his carriage to go home once more.
But it already had.
Harry always loved it when Draco did that. He always found a way to pick the best answer by tying it in with the other options. It was a special knack Harry loved, along with all the other things about him. There was an endless list Harry could say he loved about Draco.
"So I took him to the place where we had our first date. The sun was setting, and there was a breeze."
"Prepping you. I don't want any of this to hurt."
Their lips demanded as much as they could from each other; their tongues twisted and mouths met in a heated lavish.
"Like when you kissed Chang-"
"I know, but it's over now. Do you have nightmares often," Harry asked, laying down so Draco could lie on top of his chest.
"I would love to," he bit. "Would you be able to tell me how to do it, turn off my love for my soulmate?”
"You are such a pest!" He turned his head towards Harry and the Gryffindor took his chance to kiss him again. Draco automatically relaxed into it.
-----------------------------
"Hm?"
Draco’s glare broke and he smiled, looking down at his love as his love was looking up at him. He noted each and every single breath taken by Harry, deep and ridged from wrestling. He eyed him, starting with his own scarf wrapped around Harry’s neck, which corresponded to his green eyes, which just so happened to be staring at Draco’s lips.
Draco stood. "Go sit with your friends."
“Let go of me,” he struggled between kisses.
“Those are your own words, Harry Potter!”
He scoffed and she took the silence as a 'I'm dumb, please explain this to me,' moment.
"Apparently you're not good at keeping plans."
"Mr. Malfoy," broke him from his trance, "are you going to administer the potion?"
Harry grabbed hold of his arm, and as Draco jerked it, Harry could see red and purple skin hiding behind the peaks. "What happened to you?"
"You stupid, fucking idiot! Wait, you never wrote me back! I thought you were dead!"
"I have to be," Harry said when he remembered to breathe, "It's my job."
Draco ran a towel under warm water and splotched his face with it. Little yelps came from Harry depending on where he was touched but it wasn't the worst pain he's ever felt.
in the same script.
"Fine," Ron snickered.
And Harry didn't have time to think about what he'd written. Have fun. Following a war. Ron's brother died. Have fun...
"During our first time, when you first saw my scars, what did you say out loud that you didn't mean to?"
"A while. It doesn't bother you?"
Draco didn't sign it, and Harry guessed he didn't have the courage to. He sobbed.
Harry swallowed. "Because I know he's safe now, he's with my dad, and he's happy again. But you... where do I even start? Where can I even start?" Harry thought and took a deep breath before speaking again. "Because I know you so much better than I knew him. Yes I knew him, but I never spent as much time with him as I wanted, but you... I know almost better than I know myself. And if you were happy going into this arranged marriage, I would try to get over it and it might have been possible, but I know you. I know that you're in there and can't get out and you're staring at all of this in horror but you can't speak up about it. And I know you're going to be miserable, and I'm going to watch you be and there's nothing I can do about it."
"What's that?"
"Yes, he was going to offer you a spot in the Auror training program. He's probably there now. I'll owl him and let him know you're not there."
There was fighting and pushing and shoving and battling and Harry found himself up against Draco with almost a smile on his face because he knew Draco would never hurt him unlike everyone else in the room. The casted hexes and dodged them and they loved it because it was each other, and at one point Harry almost caught himself laughing because, damn, Draco looked good when he was fighting for what he believed in.
"Which kind?"
"Have you ever prepped yourself before?"
"I wish I could
The first and only meeting Draco had to endure over the winter holiday was Christmas Eve. It started with a welcome to Lucius, who got out of Azkaban in time to attend. Then, the first twenty minutes was spent updating each other of missions going on all over the country. The Carrows killed four families North of London. Bellatrix had used more unforgivables than Draco could count. Greyback still smelt of blood from an endeavor two days ago.
"Remember how happy we were?"
"That's not possible... I hate you."
"Ah," he gasped, and just as Harry reached to unbutton his shirt, Draco pushed him off completely. "No, Harry! No no no no no no," he said, slipping away from Harry, tugging back down his shirt back down. He backed away so fast, he hit his head against the backboard of the bed. "Harry no, j-just no. I'm n-not....I don't- I mean... I do-" Draco trailed away.
“One strange thing about the trial was pointed out to me by the Prosecutor, Xavier Pumblechook, who openly spoke with me about said pilot. He now works at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry due to leaving his job as a lawyer, and hoping to teach the youth of today as Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
"Er... There was never a... an
"It's bad luck to see each other on our wedding day," Draco said softly, turning back to him, as if the only thing he did want to see was Harry.
Oh yeah. "The Plan."
"Let me take care of it."
Draco let go of the blanket, allowing Harry to tuck himself under it and climb into Draco's arms. "You left. I was worried."
It seemed like miles until they stopped. And Draco understood why. The sun had almost set, only the very tip was visible and stars had come out. They were above the clouds.
Draco had Astoria in his embrace, his arm dangerously low on her back. Jealousy had never found its way to Harry until right in that moment because he swore if he looked into the mirror, his face would be a deep, passionate green. He watched Draco twirl to the music, his eyes completely locked onto hers.
"Fake or not?"
"I have a few reasons," Harry crossed his arms. "One being influenza can only last up to two weeks, from then on its severity is the same as the common cold. Two: the common flu cannot eat your lungs out, just make them flemmy-"
"What's with all the shouting, is everything alright?"
"Yeah." A silence passed as they looked at each other for a few moments, and then they moved in sync, wrapping their arms around each other as they met for another sweet, lovely, exhilarating kiss. One that made their legs weak, one that felt like they were dancing in a galaxy.
When the door shut, Draco fell back against the wall and slid to the floor, his shaking legs giving way.
"Oh my god," he thought out loud, "I can't believe it's you."
, he thought. After all, it was his 16th birthday, and in spite of all the darkness, he wanted to do something teenager-ish. And Harry wanted to do something teenagerish, too.
Fleur had already been knocked out, and her appearance didn't calm Draco to the least. She looked as if she'd been to battle, bruises and dirt covering her face. Blood rested in a pool on a cut on her face and she was crying.
And, given his murder attempt, he let himself have a break from the cabinet, focusing on his and Harry's two-year anniversary, which he was supposed to host of. Merlin, how the hell have they made it two years with everything going on?
It was when everyone else's detention ended and the team left giving subtle frowns of sympathy at Harry did it start to feel cold and vacant again. His hand was red and burning and sore, and his punishment had only just begun.
"Harry I'm fine I don't need this." Draco tried to give back his jacket.
"And why would that be, Mr. Hotshot," Seamus snickered, causing the rest of them to laugh.
That was their turning point.
“Make me angry too! I want to mean it.”
Harry laughed.
"Now what?"
"No," Draco bit, turning on his heel to walk away from him. He should have just ignored him and gone a different way as he always had. "I have not."
"And I can trust you? You'll support me?"
Harry backed them up, watching Draco rather than the sinks. Harry had the better view. He looked so wondrous with his lips slightly split and eyes wide. Harry adored it.
"First call me that more often. Second, should we be friends, you know, out there?"
, Potter!"
"Yeah?"
"Because... I just have a good feeling about him for you. I do. Why do you think I suggested it not be me? You two are... You two are so contrasting, but at the same time, so compatible, and that's really strange, but I still remember the look on your face when he didn't shake your hand in first year. Shall I bring up the, 'I can't wait to meet Harry Potter. He seems incredible! Defeated the Dark Lord when he was one years old! I want to be his friend!'"
"But he's okay with it now, right," Scorp finalized.
The action didn't go unnoticed the prosecutor who now had a smirk on his face.
She smiled widely. Goodnight, Draco."
"When you walk into a room, I lose every bit of sanity I possibly have. I can't see anything else, and it's so. bloody.frustrating. And you smell so nice. I swear if your cologne was alcohol, I would overdose and be dead right now. And your hair. Your bloody fucking hair. Is it even real? Honestly, your hair makes me question my sexuality within itself. Am I hair sexual? NO! I'M BLOODY DRACO MALFOY SEXUAL!
But still, Harry shook his head, his eyes watering. "If I hadn't eaten. If I hadn't—"
It took him several moments. "I-I had detention with Pumblechook, a-and I had to organize some-some books and there was this chest," his mouth began to quiver. "There was a boggart in it." He finally looked up at Harry. "He took my wand. He locked the door. It's been—"
"Thank Merlin," Draco shouted as loud as he wanted to, which again, he didn't know how vulgar it really was. Harry smiled, unable to help it, and then grabbed Draco by the front of his shirt and dragged him up a few stairs leading to who-knows-where. He stopped abruptly, slamming Draco against the wall and shoving his tongue in the cavern of heat and lusciousness. The Slytherin's tongue was fast, smooth, and felt like velvet against Harry's own.
"Yeah. I don't know if I'll live here after graduation. I haven't thought about it, but I think I want somewhere I've chosen, brand new. A fresh start."
"That's good. Merlin, that's good," he chewed. Then he grabbed the slice from Harry and took a bigger bite. Harry couldn't help but laugh and grab his own.
"Hey, they should thank you. We got out of exams multiple times because of you."
Harry smiled and reached out, tickling his stomach. Teddy screeched with laughter. "The next time I see you, I'm going to hold you, okay? I'm going to squeeze you so tight." He brushed Teddy's hair back, and it changed colors with each stroke, ending in a highlighter blue color.
"That's okay." Harry kissed his cheek. "You're worth it."
"You are," Draco sighed, catching his breath, "remotely. I loved my birthday present by the way. I didn't know you could be such an amazing poet." Harry smiled, biting his lip with a blush, and walked towards the lake with his hands in his pocket. Draco followed him, wrapping his arms around him from behind. "You should be a professional," he said.
"Because I thought you were cute."
"Your mother is there isn't she," Harry said softly.
"I'm always going to love you. Bond or no bond," Harry said. "Endlessly and hopelessly." And then he added. "Thank you for everything we were."
"Didn't you ever wish to tell people," Ron asked, distracting him.
“59.”
Under the cloak, Draco cast a muffaldo, ensuring they wouldn't be heard, but they didn't look at each other or spoke above a whisper just in case. "It's my fault. I deserve this, come on, Harry, let me at least take some pain away."
"What are we going to do about it, Harry," Draco looked him in the eye. Harry was silent for a bit, thinking.
So Draco tried pushing his tongue forward when they kissed and it caught Harry off guard because it didn't feel like Draco's lips.
He wished Potter had never made him laugh so he wouldn't have known the feeling of it, and therefore, would never miss it.
Harry received an egregious amount of comments all the way up to his dorm, his friends teasing him and other classmates staring at him oddly. All the roses together filled ten vases, half of which fit on his dresser, and the other half he had to put on the floor next to his bed. Waking up to them the next morning made his heart leap.
Harry nodded enthusiastically. "Yes!"
"We don't even know if the DA is going to be a thing, it's just an idea. And that's the thing, I don't want you to. The less people that know the better, the safer we are. If Voldemort knows..."
"Draco," Harry stared at the paint. "That's so kind of you, but... we can't pull this off."
"No," Harry giggled, squaring him. He then dashed towards the table, hoping to climb over it and escape. Draco grabbed him by the waist and pulled him back. They both were laughing as Harry struggled to break free. "No no no, please no!"
Harry booked it to the fireplace and traveled through the network, landing back inside.
"I promise I won't. But you can't make me promise I won't fucking hurt them."
They cried for their stolen childhoods and broken hearts.
"Er..." Harry hesitated.
"You're dead, Potter," he growled, ready to make out with him but the clearing of ones throat kept him from it.
"I can't argue with that." Draco reached forward and kissed his cheek. Then he looked at the blank paper.
"I thought you liked me." Potter's face bent in pain.
He reached for the handle and jerked it, but the handle wouldn't budge.
"Hey." Harry's nervousness was practically tattooed on his face as they met in an alcove.
Fifteen-year-old Draco was prepared to fight for Harry, make his case of how good he was for him, how they were superior boyfriends and he only made his life better. Even Granger admitted that!
Narcissa tittered as Draco lowered his hand.
And Harry awoke from his nightmare.
"The Plan to Seduce Potter."
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, confused as he saw the Slytherin swim away. He surfaced, calling his name, going after him. "Draco!"
Draco dipped his head as Harry headed towards the castle, but Draco stopped him by grabbing his arm. 'Hug him!' Pansy shouted in his brain. He spun Harry around and wrapped his arms around him only so that their chests were touching. Harry didn't react at first but then slabbed his arm around Draco as well. It felt.... weird.
“Do you remember Cho Chang,” he asked the kids biting his lip. They both nodded their head. “She kissed me under the mistletoe and when Draco found out he flipped! I don’t think I’d ever seen him so angry in his life! Even after 6th year, even after I died and came back, even after the memory loss, I’d never seen him so mad before!”
And then more footsteps came. Draco saw everyone as everyone saw Draco. He didn't say anything, but took a step back.
“It’s your choice to fail if you want to. By the rate you’re at, Potter’s probably going to surpass every single one of your NEWTS. Don’t let him do that Draco! That’s something he’s going to hold against you the rest of your life. You’ll win a fight one day and he’ll say, ‘At least I beat you on the Potions NEWTs.’ Do you want that utter humiliation?”
“Me too-oo. How about w-we g-go to the prefects b-b-bathr-room and t-take a nice w-w-warm bath.”
"We're great, mother. Everything's fine," he bit as he let go of him. Again, Harry furrowed his eyebrows and smiled awkwardly as they passed her. She stood with crossed arms and stared at Harry as he walked.
Harry opened his eyes to see the two completely wrapped up in each other, making out so languidly, so lovingly; Harry biting Draco's lip softly, Draco pulling him closer in a
"Mm," Draco whispered in his ear, "I'm sure me being in here makes her uneasy, so I don't think we would have been able to do this. But I do agree, Granger is great help."
“For over a year,” Draco replied.
"You know, you're going to be my downfall. Not Voldemort."
Draco opened it and waved his wand, a Pensieve and a tower of small vials.
"You shouldn't have to babysit me on your birthday."
They made it to Defense Against the Dark Arts classrooms, where several students were crying and hiding. They all screamed when Draco entered and then began pelting him with spells, books—one threw a chair at him. "Hey hey hey! Stop it!"
"Totally. My face was green with envy," he said with a light heart.
Harry and Weasley ran from the stairwell, sending hexes their way. One of the snatchers stepped in front while Narcissa took Weasley.
"Draco! Please wake up," Harry grasped his shoulders. He, too, almost had a panic attack and he was trying not to hyperventilate.
Draco did as he was told, only to groan as Harry unbuttoned his pants with his teeth.
"Calm down, you're going to choke."
"Slytherins..." Harry muttered under his breath.
Harry pushed him away. "You need to stay away from me."
Harry did as asked, and after a few more pulses, he leant back into Draco and whispered, "I'm ready."
"Oi, don't talk about my client that way," Harry called.
"Because it is Valentine's Day and I'm sure you'd be wanting company."
Draco stepped closer to him. "I think it's worth it. But then again, maybe we won't have to worry about it one day."
"That solves that. You sounded like a snake."
“Of course I did,” Draco smiled back. There was a comfortable silence before they spoke again. Harry got up and sat on the ledge of the clock window, examining the snow flurries while tucking his knees to his chest and resting his cheek on his knee.
But deciding that now didn't matter. He didn't need to think about it right now, right this second.
"I swear to Merlin himself. He hates compliments. He hates attention."
"I'm not... I just... don't want to jinx it."
"Oh my God, that's Harry!" It was Ron, who, from the other side of the room, was pointing at him. He had glazed eyes and was surrounded by Dean, Seamus, Neville, and all the others from Dumbledore's Army. Ron charged after him and wrapped his arms around him, sending them both stumbling. He smelled of heavy fire whisky. "That's my best friend. I'm so happy you're here."
Harry took Pansy's hand, and they joined the crowd. Just as the music broke up, Harry snuck past the group and ran to Cho, taking her hand.
They both rolled over onto their sides, facing each other, their bodies so close they were practically touching and they could feel each others breath caress their faces.
Harry thought. He
It felt so cold and dark and awful.
"Wasn't your fault."
And he drifted.
"W-we weren't making out—"
Technically, Draco was supposed to be in Harry's room (at least according to Granger's plan). He didn't care. He wanted to see Harry as much as he could. Draco only had a day before going to the Manor for the holiday break.
Draco reached forward for a kiss, one that said all of the things they were thinking, and when they let go, Draco looked deep into his eyes.
“That’s awkward,” Harry laughed into his cup of butterbeer, “because you were not yesterday. Anything else?”
"They were trying to run out of the country. Got stopped at the border of France like a bunch of cowards. Word is they can't find Draco anywhere."
"Not move anything," Draco laughed. "Not leave the bed."
"Thank you very much."
"You're sure?"
"How have you been living," Harry asked. "I always thought you were just a complete arsehole."
"Harry, do you want another dose of calming draught?" Draco reached out and grabbed his wrist, feeling his pulse pound quickly. He knew the answer before Harry even said it.
Harry turned to him with wondrous eyes, "Magic."
"I can't believe I actually sent that to you," Harry leaned back into his embrace. "It was a last minute decision."
"What was it like? At the trial," Draco asked. "Was he bias?" Harry nodded, biting the inside of his cheek. "That's illegal. You have to have an objective trial."
"I don't want proper."
But that was the thing. Draco shoved it down for so long, kept it in for so long. Kept it from Harry, who he would consider his main form of stress relief, his best friend, his soulmate, his lover. Things couldn't help but slip out.
"Please open your textbooks to page two hundred and follow along. Can anyone tell me what Inferi are—Yes, Miss Granger."
And they laughed again.
"Sorry. I didn't mean to... no. You need to go back to treatment. You're not even cleared."
"I own this place now, she can deal with it."
"You didn't!"
"You scared me to death-"
"Yes, it is," he had to admit. "Unsanitary, but fun."
"I'm so sorry. I truly am." Draco looked at him and then the paper. The guilt trip was compelling, but then he thought of Harry. "I can't sign that. I'm sorry. I'm not my father. But I'm sorry for what he did to you. I know I won't ever be able to make up for what he's done to your family. But I'm not him. I didn't want this."
There wasn't a time where they weren't laughing.
"Sirius Black?"
"The relationship is said to be far along, as Potter is seen on one knee proposing to Malfoy. 'It could be a possibility that this was apart of Malfoy's plan. If the couple is married, it could increase their bondage between the curse,' said an anonymous source. Draco Malfoy is said to be engaged to Astoria Greengrass since before the war, however, the pair has yet to be married.'"
Harry looked up into his eyes and leaned in only to be shoved against the wall as hard as possible without cracking his skull.
"Please," Harry whimpered.
Draco couldn't stand the innocence in those eyes. "Yeah. I'm fine."
———————————————
"Potter, he needs to get to the Hospital Wing. Shall I?"
"Sign the contract, date it, but don't file it. Hide it here somewhere. In the Room of Requirement. So it exists. But the government can't track it until you turn it into them. My mum can sign it for you. She's certified. I'll figure out how to have her sign a blank one first, so it's valid. And she won't know who it is for. Come on, don't you want to be with Harry?"
"Erm... pretty sure you're a teenager now... You collected my wanted posters?" Harry grabbed them and unrolled them.
"Actually we are quite thankful you organized this dinner, now was the perfect time if not sooner. We apologize for not telling you before this." Pansy came up with the times spontaneously. The 5 children had just completely lied to the Dark Lord who fell silent again.
"The third stall," Draco guessed, however looked at him in disgust.
"You did not!"
Harry didn't laugh. Instead, he turned to the room. It was definitely cozy. There were big, lumpy couches, a fireplace, and big windows that let in beads of the orange sunset. The walls were cream-colored and matched soft carpeting.
"I'm sorry." Harry reached out and grabbed his hand. "I want to try something. Do you trust me?"
"Sorry. I tried to get away from my friends without being suspicious, but they care a lot."
"Draco, it's me."
"What if we gave it a name? Do you think that might help you?" Harry raised an eyebrow. "Like Umbitch."
Harry released from the kiss, "You know what I just realized?"
"What time is it?"
Wait.
“You’ve had four close calls, and not just four; one, two, three, and then four.”
"Yes."
"They won't do that," she said. "I have to have your account."
"Harry, the Dark Lord is on his way!"
Draco didn't say anything, but continued to listen as Harry ranted and ranted for over twenty minutes, letting his frustration out, and then Harry said, "You know how this all started?"
He heard Draco grunt, but Draco was supposed to be asleep. "I'm okay," he said. Harry could see the lower half of her body. She wore pink pajama bottoms and slippers that had ribbons on them. Harry got an idea, and Draco felt Harry's hand relax and let go. He thought he was leaving.
Draco didn't want to leave, neither did Harry. They were both frozen in their spots as if ice trapped their locomotor.
“Marry me,” Harry kissed the skin next to his cock, and Draco moaned as loud as he could.
But desperate times...
Once the train stopped, they waited for everyone to leave.
"No," he shrieked, the pain feeling like a drug. "Fuck, I love you, Draco, I love you!"
"I said get out, Potter," he sniffed, and tears slipped his eyes just at that voice—
"What's with all the shouting, is everything alright?"
Harry cringed, begging for this night to be over with. "Technically."
Fake Draco moved in to kiss him but fake Harry pushed him away. "
Draco pulled up his pant leg, revealing twenty little bites in his calf. "
"Prosecution, you may begin questioning," Kingsley ordered. Shit...
“Draco…”
"Okay, Ferret." Harry picked at his nails nonchalantly.
"I would give you some," Harry smiled, "I would give you all I could if I so happened to gain all the happiness in the world."
"I'll go get food from mum everyday if I have to. I'll sit with you, I'll—"
"Really, Draco, a rooftop?"
"Huh, that's wierd," Harry said more to himself.
Death Eaters behind him disaparrated, and Lucius and Narcissa grabbed him.
Draco found it mildly hilarious as if the golden boy were trying to blink away the monster that kept him up at night. He had dark circles under his eyes.
"You'll be out soon," Draco tried to comfort, but it didn't make Harry feel any less uncomfortable.
"I mean it. With everything in me. You're my favorite person, and you're the most important person in my life. If you weren't in this world, I'd be so lost. You mean so much to me." Draco kissed his cheek. "That's why you like it when I ask about your day, isn't it? Because no one was ever interested in your day."
, he says as he waits in the Room of Requirement to talk to me every night."
"Shut up, Potter."
"I. fucking. died, Draco Malfoy! And then I came back to life and beat said dictator—do you know how fucking exhausting that is?"
And Harry loved it, being wanted this much. Wanting someone this much. He had his hands on Draco's hips and welcomed him. Everything was okay. Better than okay, actually, as they met and sucked on each other's lips.
“So… push him away, break up with him.”
"Yeah. I am, actually."
"Fred?"
"You really are!"
Studying went well… for about 10 minutes… until Harry saw Draco’s name on his paper, ‘Draco Malfoy,’ in neat, cursive perfection. While Draco reviewed his notes, Harry dipped his quill in ink and put a line through his last name, writing ‘Potter,’ next to it, in his mess writing.
"It's not like I wanted to-"
When Harry watched himself throw food out of the window in his treatment room, Harry shuttered. "I didn't even realize that I did that."
"Harry," He grabbed both sides of his face. "If you're really that worked up about it, I forgive you. I do! I don't care. I shouldn't have done that to you or your friends or your mother. It was disrespectful and I broke one of your only rules. I knew what I was getting into. But damn it, calm down. You're sorry?"
"Move," Draco shouted and picked Harry up bridal style. Harry immediately relaxed into Draco's touch, into his scent, and leant his head into the crook of his neck as he wrapped his arms around his throat.
"It's only going to be a few hours."
Potter grabbed the dustpan on the desk and returned it to the front, the spell locking his wand breaking, and Potter grabbed it. He didn't even look at Draco when he left the room.
—————————————
"Hey, I'm not judging you," Draco smiled. "I prefer it that way anyhow. Where's Weasley?"
"WHAT!" Pansy jumped up and down and hugged them both.
"Oh rats, you'll get pie in your face again. Look where that led us!"
"Harry, you did nothing wrong. This was out of your control. You won't lose anyone, okay?"
It tore at Draco's heart. "You're looking for control." Harry didn't say anything. "You're only going to find it by talking to me about what's going on in your head. Not making stupid decisions."
Whatever, that didn't matter now as he saw Draco up in the Slytherin Tower.
"I saw you in Potions. You looked at me and you said my name."
. Draco rolled his eyes. "Fine, but for the record, it's just potatoes."
"Get out?"
“And don’t worry, Weasley, we try a lot,” Draco smirked, and Ron could feel it through the material.
"And I wouldn't have written you back if it did get back to me."
"He took it with him to the forest."
“Thank you, Professor, I will,” Harry beamed back at him before pulling Draco out of them room.
A chill when down Harry’s spine.
Ron furrowed his eyebrows and followed Harry out of the bathroom. He threw on some clothes and grabbed his map, checking to make sure that Malfoy was still in his room, which he was.
Harry sat down in his usual spot at the Gryffindor table, next to Ron and Hermione. Thankfully Ron and him made up after the first task when he came to his senses. He immediately shoveled scrambled eggs onto his plate with a piece of bacon and a slice of toast. Ron was already finished and slurping in his pumpkin juice while Hermione was chewing on a sausage.
"I was there the night that he had to assassinate him, he lowered his wand. The only magic he did was to disarm, which Dumbledore wanted because he knew he was going to die. And for the record, he was a minor forced to do these things with the threat of him and his family being murdered. He was a child. We were all children!"
"Draco," he ran a hand through his hair, "you're over thinking this. We are eating Christmas dinner just like we did last night, just at different house with different people."
Harry covered his mouth with his hand, pulling on all of his IV's. More tears flooded as Draco stepped in the room. All the nurses behind them checked his heart rate, which was beating quickly.
"That was very sweet of me, huh?"
"Oh please! What would she know?"
"I've tried every day. Harry, you're freaking me out." Ron nodded, a concerned look on his face. He squeezed Harry's shoulder before getting up and leaving. Harry didn't move or even look at him. "Can I borrow the cloak? Don't want to get caught skipping class." Hermione handed it to him.
"I've been with my friends for ten months. They understand. I want to be with you. I reckon they want to be alone, too."
Finally, their love was at peace with the world.
"You're so dirty," Harry finally said, wiping at smudge marks over his chin and forehead. The dust stuck to dried tears on his cheek.
"Example of said stupid muggles right off the bat."
And then he wondered, when did this even happen? Was this always there? Did Malfoy always have a crush on him? Because he certainly always teased him. Nothing had changed that Harry could notice. Except he stared at him a lot. But Malfoy always had. Maybe not this much, but Harry always talked with Ron, so he couldn't truly pay attention to him.
Draco stood from the bench, pushed the plates out of the way, climbed on the table, and took a seat on top of it, right in front of Harry, his legs spread so that his feet rested on either side of him. "Of all the lies I ever told you, I need you to know that there is no bigger lie than me wanting to wait until marriage to have sex." Then Draco leant closer to his ear and whispered the secret, "Remember the present you gave me, that book where you confessed all your sweet fantasies. Your handwriting alone gave me the best four orgasms of my entire life. And I'd like to repay the favor."
"Your hair looks nice," the blonde complimented.
“Tell me about the marriage contract, Draco,” Harry said, and he rolled off of him so that he could flip over, and then Harry lay across his stomach, drooping his arms around his chest, his head resting on one of his pecks and his legs cast out to the side lazily.
rang true. "Draco, you can't tell anyone this. I've never told anyone this at all."
"You're the smartest in our year, but you're not a very good shadow. I could hear your footsteps behind me when you followed me the past few days. If you're going to stalk someone, wear softer shoes."
"He did!"
"I hope so," Draco said. "I really do." And then he thought some more, "It's cool to look at how far we've come in the month we've been here. You came here with heart failure and I had memory loss. And we're leaving here as we are now."
Harry met his eyes and blinked. It was a serious question. "When I feel stable enough and ready to...
"You hate love only because you've never had it. Your father hurt you and your mother never showed affection past the age of six. But I've never known anyone who has ever loved more deeply than you. I finally figured you out in 6th year. You never had a cold heart, but one burned and scaled with hate and revenge because of your father. You were always too afraid to love until you met me."
"Sorry, I'm not used to being this strong. I really like this height though. Better angle of your hair."
Despite the winter cold, the fact that he could see Harry's breath as he said it, Draco's entire body felt warm, from his nose to his fingertips, to his toes.
"Draco," he whispered gently.
Voldemort.
"Mine has never hurt around him," Snape said.
"I swear to God, Potter, if you do I will forever hate you in an abyss of pure malice, and I will hang you upside down off of the astronomy tower and see how you like it, you prat!"
Harry, however, was thinking the same thing. He really liked Draco, like really liked him. Draco was an elite: how could he ever want someone as scruffy and mismanaged as Harry.
"Fine," Harry's eyes flashed. He put one knee to the ground. "Will you marry me?"
"Yeah, he wants you in Azkaban."
“Okay so, October 31st. Where do you want it to be?”
The man next to him is so valuable, so precious to him. Harry loved him. Harry
Again, Potter saying his name did something special to him. "I'm sorry!"
"Hm? About what?"
Draco awkwardly squeezed her. Next came Bill. Draco stuck out his hand, but he ignored it and went in for a hug.
"I was erm.. I was walking down the corridor and I saw you two together..."
She left him at the point to where Harry was crying so hard he coughed.
They sat next to each other and dug into their food. Harry fought the stupid voice, because he'd always loved Molly's lasagna.
"You didn't know," Hermione asked, "being a Death Eater and all?"
"Friends have each other's back, right?"
"Trust me, I wish I didn't."
To complete the tour, they ended back up in Draco's room.
"Our relationship is a mess."
Just as Harry prepped himself, Draco reached back to the sandwich and took a bite. "Ooo, yeah, this is really good."
They both realized it at once, looking at Draco's mercury eyes.
"I love him. I couldn't even tell him it. But I guess that's the world we live in, huh? I wish we wouldn't have confessed the trick to the Dark Lord. He would have just murdered me, and it would have been so much easier. I'd do that in a heartbeat over this, but I didn't know that when the Dark Lord branded me. Now it's too late."
He put it back where it came from and went into the main wing. There, Draco was still asleep, but he did appear a little less pale. Harry didn't care, he walked on and sat on Draco's bed, stroking his hair.
Harry just rolled his eyes.
"Why is that so surprising," Draco snapped.
"Harry! I-I remember you," Draco said.
"Oh please," Hermione giggled," They would kill each other the minute they found out what was going on."
“Me too,” Draco told. “But hey, I love you no matter what happens okay,” Draco assured him, pulling him into a hug.
"You're barking! His father almost killed you."
"Harry!"
. He hated her and it wasn't even the end of the first week.
He had to grip Draco's arms, and eventually he wrapped his arms around his neck, just like they used to when they were dating. Their tongues brushed as Draco held his face, then moved his arms around Harry's back, pressing their chests together.
"That was very sweet of me, huh?"
It was the first time in his life that the physical gifts, the materialistic items, didn't bring him any joy whatsoever. He stared at them vacantly, and then back at the Gryffindors.
"We do, too. But they're safe over there while we're here doing what we're supposed to do now. We're here for a reason. We only go when it's our time to go."
Draco rolled his eyes before opening his arms. "If you insist."
"It's worked for me," Potter shrugged. "Can I run our next date? I want to bring the food. You always do."
Draco cringed at that word. "Call me that, I'm leaving."
Draco stepped out from his hiding spot and walked up to his exlover examining his face slightly.
"At least when this is all over, we can stop asking what color we want for the tablecloth."
Tomorrow would be the first tomorrow that was guaranteed.
He laid in bed, shaking, all too terrified that at any moment, Voldemort could walk through that door and kill him on sight. The look of Cedric's lifeless eyes replaying over and over again. Tears slipped his eyes and his throat burned.
"Hey!" Harry tried to start an argument which would end in them kissing, however Draco stopped it right there, not responding and finishing his last 3 turns.
"If it was that git-"
"Potter."
"Draco, please just tell me what's wrong!"
"Professor Snape I found these two in a supply closet, skipping class."
"If you want. We can do whatever we want." That was the question: what now? They'd met up. They'd had sex. More sex than their bodies could handle. The war was over. Everything was okay.
"Erm, I think it's broken," he answered, and began searching for the old time teller. It was at the bottom of the trunk and it popped up after Harry yanked its chain.
At first, he was uncomfortable.
"Hey, it's okay," Harry touched his chest. He couldn't help but look at the scars, but immediately snap back up to Draco. "It's okay, it's just me."
"I didn't," he laughed.
"Well," Harry started, " we really didn't plan in falling in love, sir, it just kind of happened."
"Yeah thanks for letting me know, scarhead," Draco sneered as much as he could go without pain.
Draco stared at him, trying to hold back smile: failing miserably. "How thoughtful. You killed a living and thriving plant and disrupted the balance of nature just for me."
"I was screaming and hitting him, trying to get my wand. He took off his mask and I remember he looked scared. He wouldn't cast anything at first. I told him to kill me because I couldn't live without my family. He told me he was sorry and would try to protect them, and then he stunned me. I woke up and he was holding my kid's bodies and he was crying."
"Asking Draco Malfoy to not obsess over Harry Potter is like asking the sky not to be blue," Blaise snorted.
"I needed Sirius, too. And then Bellatrix killed him. Just like Voldemort will to all of you."
Draco remained under the cloak at the gate and lifted it the second Harry came close enough.
"I'm not interested in being your partner," Potter grit. "You're mean, you're cruel, you're obnoxious. I don't want you." And then Potter caught himself—he wasn't talking about the project. "I'd rather fail." Draco didn't know what to say, so he didn't say anything. "What, no snide remark?"
"So we're in the wizarding world and I'm coming home from the ministry, somehow my clothing seemed to be missing. The second I walk in the building, into the elevator, what happens?"
"I was at the Manor at the time that it started. Bellatrix Lestrange told me to find the Ravenclaw Diadem and bring it to her. I didn't know it was a Horcrux, but I knew that I wasn't going to actually get it to her. She threatened to kill me if I didn't."
-Draco Malfoy
"Harry. I'm telling you this right now. I forgive you-"
"Really am I, now?"
. After being owned for years.
"You're right," he said, lifting his head and setting it so that he was looking to Harry's eyes. "What do you mean 'stuck in between'?"
"What about Snape?" Harry didn't want to be caught with something as difficult as this situation. Draco looked up Into Harry's eyes, his hand caressing his cheek.
"Oh, er," Harry said, "Yeah."
Footsteps paraded through the Slytherin bedroom hallway. "What?" She rushed Into the room to see an angry Draco staring down at the clothes that she had picked out for his date with Potter.
"That's not my point," Draco wrapped his arms around him tighter. "You also fell asleep during Potions on Wednesday."
"Yeah?" Draco tugged on Harry's hair. Harry nodded. "Though, we wouldn't have had to if—"
"There are pictures in the top floor bedroom in a drawer. Please don't look at them, but if you could get them for me. I don't think they should be lying around, considering Kingsley thinks he owns the fucking place. Also Draco has his trunk in Sirius's room."
Draco's heart raced. If he didn't shove him out now, Draco would never let him leave. "Get to class or I'll take points."
Harry blinked. "No, you're not. You were just forced. I-It's fine, they'll forgive—"
"Since 5th year. I figured it out."
"Weird like girly weird or weird like Potter weird?"
Harry broke down, sobbing into his hands. The sound of it made Draco happy. He deserved it. He sat there and relished in his tears, however a single tear fell down from his eyes, because one small, very small, piece of him was being killed by the sound of Harry crying.
"I wanted you to have the satisfaction of taking it off. Like unwrapping a present.
Draco's mouth fell open at how good it felt. So he then took off his trousers, his erection calling for his attention, just there. He held it, just thinking about it, how different it was, how this was supposed to happen and he never knew. Then, using Blaise's advice, he grabbed some lotion and started stroking himself.
All the couples sat together at morning breakfast no matter the house, except for Draco and Harry who walked down together as usual. They locked eyes and began having a conversation with them. Next to Draco, Theo Nott was having a tongue war with Millicent Bulstrode and Draco flicked his eyes twice to them before sticking out his tongue and pointing his finger at it. Harry laughed and returned to his meal, although he was grossed out by the battles going on around him. He was digging into his toast when someone squeezed next to him.
He didn't understand, and furrowed his eyebrows as a result of it. "I... I... But I have..." Draco's eyes trailed to his arm, which rested at Harry's ribcage.
"Sorry," Harry cried before returning.
And then he noticed Katie Bell. Katie met his eyes and his blood turned cold.
"No, Draco," Harry growled, "I hate her so much. You don't understand." But it was Harry's fault that Draco didn't understand. He refused to tell him.
To take a break, Draco slowed them to a stop inside the forest so no one could see them. They were high above the ground, resting, looking at the snow below, the castle against the cold winter's night through holes in branches. They had matching windburn on their cheeks and watery eyes.
"What was that for?" He broke out into something that wasn't a smirk, something so foreign to him, while Harry laughed. The laugh coming from Harry's throat was like Angels singing to Draco's ears. There wasn't anything in the world that would make that note more beautiful.
"Harry, I don't know about this," she said uncertainly as they got into position.
A small smirk came on his face, “Well you have me, lucky you. I’m the Golden Boy aren’t I?”
"I haven't," Draco inhaled, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to push down the pain. "And I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about bloody kissing that Ginger Slut!"
"So, where are we going?"
"No no no no no no! It's a study date not a kissing date." Draco pushed away Harry's hand even though he wanted to do nothing but lock fingers with him.
"19 times," he bit.
"I would appreciate it if you two would stop your little pow-wow and get to your stations, unless of course you would like to attend here next week as well."
Draco ran his hand through his hair. "Last night... Did I ask you... for your permission to marry Harry?"
And now I've fallen for you
"Yes I do. I'm your boyfriend. And even if I wasn't, I still would care about you." Draco bit his lip and stared at his feet. "Look, I just want you to be comfortable around me."
The thought of being engaged to Harry, if only for a little, sounded wonderful. But a new guilt appeared: What happens if the plan doesn't work? What happens when he has to say goodbye to Harry? Does he just disappear? Or will his biggest fear become realized?
Harry beamed, but then looked away to hide it.
The blonde stepped over to Harry in defeat and jumped on his back where Harry hooked his arms around the back of Draco's knees. Damn it, Harry smelled so
"It's not a good tactic if I'm also distracting myself," Harry said, leaning and giving him a kiss. He put a hand on Draco's thigh, partly to hold him up, and partly to seduce him, because he was still trying to figure out how to feel comfortable doing that.
more like himself again. Rightfully so. He'd spent months in intensive treatment, working as hard as he could to get his life back. And part of it was privilege, part of it was luck, but a lot of it was grit, too.
"It's almost like he... it's like he wants a friend he can hug all the time. What a weird person."
They headed downstairs and asked Kreature to get them some groceries. Harry cooked them breakfast, though Draco offered to help.
Lupin blinked, trying not to give a big reaction, but it wasn't his fault that Harry blurted it out. It wasn't what he expected to hear. "Ah, I imagine you've gone through some tough self-discovery. Finding out you're gay when there are muggle prejudices, as with your family I'm sure, out there, it can be difficult."
————————————————
Pansy and Blaise gave each other a look.
The creaked open, leaving the two staring into the chamber itself. Draco's eyes were wide, and Harry wished he had a camera so he could take his picture, so he could remember the breathtaking look on his face when he was coated in wonder. It was beautiful, Harry concluded. It made him want to surprise Draco every second of every day. Still, Harry was grinning from ear to ear. "After you."
“That sounds good… but terrifying,” Draco said biting his lip.
"I have a Dark Mark on my arm. I haven't relaxed in two years. I can't relax because my parents are probably being tortured right now and the love of my life just almost got murdered. I would be hurt, too, if my mum didn't get me out."
"Don't worry about it," Harry replied while kissing his forehead. He actually wasn't sleeping. All the could think about was the inevitable dinner with the Weasley's that would occur 12 hours later. That,  along with doubts of them running away. What if it didn't work?
Draco grabbed him by his shirt forcefully, ready to kiss him mad when they both heard footsteps and shouting.
"H-hey you," Draco blurted, and Harry let out a light laugh.
"I wish I would have brought a broom stick," Harry admitted, and Draco laughed.
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but stopped himself. Don't let him get too close. "Because you're you," he said in a snobby tone.
"You jealous," Harry asked him. "Can't stand that you don't own me?”
"A description would be nice," Harry leant his head on his shoulder.
“Bollocks,” Draco turned to him. “I know I’m downright gorgeous but it takes time to get there.”
————————————————
"We were snogging," he whispered, but Harry heard him and hit his arm, giving him a firm glare. Draco just laughed as well as the kids.
"Seems intellectually stimulating." Hermione crossed her arms.
"Dra-"
Draco hit it again, turning back to Harry. "I'm going to kill you."
"Why?"
"Voldemort gave Harry a vision that he was torturing his godfather for the sake of getting a prophecy. He wasn't hurting his godfather at all, he wasn't even there. Voldemort was just tricking Harry. It was a trap to get Harry to retrieve the prophecy for him. Dumbledore and Voldemort dueled and Voldemort possessed him."
“You don’t know what it was like during the war, Lily, you don’t know what either of us have been through. He didn’t have a choice.”
Silence. Harry really didn't know what to say. "
You're so peaceful when you sleep, did you know? Probably not because you're unconscious, how could you know? While I was watching you sleep I just kept thinking about us. I kept thinking of sixth year, and how you never ate, and how you never slept. And I remember when you lost your memory, when I never ate or slept.
---------------------------------------------------------
"How would you know what I need," he said abruptly louder.
“You’re going to have to make me a thousand pastries to make up for this,” Harry joked, strictly because he wanted to.
And in that moment Draco Malfoy'a chest was hurting so bad it was as if he was beaten by a hammer. Before he could scream in pain he disapperated before anyone could hear him wince in the splitting of his own heart.
“My memory was erased,” Draco said almost solemnly. “I didn’t remember him.”
Draco gave a half smirk and hugged him back. "I'll think about it."
Harry then used nothing more than his eyes, looking at Draco, reading Draco, absorbing him. God, was he beautiful. And it wasn't just his entirety, it was every individual thing in the entire universe that made him so lovely. His legs and his hips and his chest and his collar and his neck and his hands and his arms and his toes and his fingers and his Dark Mark and his face-God, his beautiful face that Harry would never get enough of, even if he did end up marrying him; it would never be enough- and his hair, his perfect hair and his jaw and his eyes and his nose and his ears and his lips and his bloody gorgeous cock and his chest and his sweet, sweet arse, and his heart and his soul and his head and his thoughts. Every bloody thing about him.
I wish you the best.
"Well," Harry choked, "If that's true, a meteor should be flying out of the sky and wiping out the entire face of the earth right now."
"Have you planned anything out about the wedding?" Hermione asked.
"But here you are not pushing me away, and you know exactly where to hurt me. One shove and I'd be off your hands," Draco dug a thumb into his hipbone, bruising it. Harry inhaled heavily, trying not to bite his lip or moan. Draco's lovely scent filled his nose.
"No, it's not that at all." Draco shifted his gaze from Granger, who was quietly eating, an empty spot where Harry should have been next to them. She barely nibbled before turning to Weasley and speaking low in his ear. Draco wasn't very good at lipreading, but he definitely saw the word "Harry" mouthed. She then stood and grabbed a plate of toast, leaving.
"Harry," he bent down and kissed his forehead.
"It's an invasion of privacy." Hermione as well as the others grew afraid of what Draco would see and how he would react. They didn't want Draco anywhere near those memories while Harry was in this state.
"I would have made you fall in love with me again." Harry pulled Draco tighter to him.
"No idea," Draco kissed his lips yet again.
“Dead.”
Which they did, and then they lay back on Draco's giant bed for ten minutes, Harry trying to make conversation as Draco
"I'm not afraid of you," Draco shouted. Harry grabbed his arm and brought it to the front on his body and Draco inevitably regretted it, but Harry always knew he'd take the challenge. The dark mark was the same, and the cut marks around it had faded a bit. Harry traced his fingers over them. "Don't judge me too harshly. You don't know what I've been though."
And Draco notice that as well.
Draco frowned, his eyebrows creased like a puppy dog staring at an empty bowl. Facing he wasn't good enough, for Harry was always raw and painful. From when he was fourteen and defensive, eager to fight him before Harry could even notice it about him, to when he was fifteen, doing his best to be the best boyfriend he could so Harry wouldn't leave him, when he was sixteen, destroying each thread that sewed Harry's soul, to when he was seventeen, doing his best to fight against a dictator and standing by Harry's side as he mourned, to now at eighteen, helping Harry through treatment, being the shoulder he needed.
"Mr. Malfoy, What age were you convicted a death eater?"
By the time he reached his dormroom door, he decided he was done. Completely, one hundred percent done. He didn't even dare look at Draco's door. It was like he didn't even exist anymore. Like he was already away and married, Harry didn't think he existed anymore.
Harry climbed onto the bed and Draco followed suit. They were close enough to feel each other's energy, but not their touch. "So I was truthful on my evaluation form instead of lying since that's what I did when I went to St. Mungo's, and, er, I'm really fucked up." Though he ended the sentence with a laugh. "Surprise, surprise."
Almost like how Draco decided to play the trick on him, but Harry was more gullible.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows but thought nothing of it. He went to his seat at the end of the row as groups of people stood. An immediate eruption of arguing, chatter, hissing, and hatred filled the air, and Draco didn't even notice it as he grabbed toast.
There was an awkward silence after he sat down. "So I take it the stone works?" Harry smiled and nodded. Draco asked, "Are they right there?" he looked in their general direction.
Draco was gone, leaving Harry feeling like a used up toy from an abusive owner, a single tear streaking his cheek and heart burning, only to look up at the Dark Mark dancing in the sky, haunting him.
"I told you, I've never lost a game at my years at Hogwarts," Ron smirked. Draco just stared at the board, trying to comprehend how it happened. "Go ahead and sulk, but first I would appreciate if you stood over there to receive your pie to the face."
"They make me feel so ugly."
"Me?" She furrowed her eyebrows.
"I'm Dr. Barmer. I've been overseeing your treatment. I'm a Memoriologist. I deal with treatment of memory."
Draco didn't even look at him back, he could feel him. "What're you looking at?"
"Could you teach me how to cook," Draco asked.
Draco did his best to sound genuine too, except this time he actually was. He hoped his authenticity carried over. "I was excited to see you since I woke up this morning, so I'd say that qualifies as being a good day."
He shook his head. "Just because I don't say something for a month or two doesn't mean I grew out of it. You are my Scarface."
"Of course I worry about him. All the time. I worry about everyone." Ron frowned. "Because I have to carry on. I love Fred. I love everyone who died. But they wouldn't have wanted us to make this new world and hate everything and be miserable
"Children?"
Harry fought back. "Why should I? The locket's right. It lets me hate him like I should. It's the only thing I should be listening to right now." Because the alternative was still being in love with him, even after everything Draco had done to him. He still felt fucking in love with him.
Draco went down the stairs with a newfound confidence, one he planned on keeping, so long as his guilt didn't sneak in his head.
——————————————-
The way Harry kissed him. The way he touched him. No one could do that like Harry could.
It was also the fear of what was to come, because he knew Draco was going to try to hurt Dumbledore, but he didn't know when or how, and he wasn’t ready to risk his best friends on finding out. The only thing that gave him any hope whatsoever was the lessons with Dumbledore, looking through Tom Riddle's memory, a giant breakthrough after he took liquid luck and celebrated Aragog's death with Slughorn and Hagrid.
"C. None of the above. The correct answer is that I actually love him. It's not a trick."
Draco proceeded to the room of requirement, a place considered hell to him now. He went directly to the cabinet, and recited a spell he knew all too well.
"Please! We could get a ferret," Harry laughed, laying his chin on Draco's stomach.
Draco bit his lip and he choked, pressing his forehead against Harry's, sighing at the thought that their pain was over. He didn't have to hate himself anymore. Harry was safe. Draco was safe. They were going to be okay.
"I love you, too," she said.
"It just seems like you're always staring at each other, or just involved," Dean spoke.
"I know I love hickeys and you love them, but we've been doing so much."
"What about it? I'm the one who got us together. I'm the one who came up with The Plan to Seduce Potter."
"Oh er- yeah... I- erm, I'm fine," Harry tried to maintain a neutral composure, but then he said the word 'fine' and his cheeks, betraying him against his own will, involuntarily pulled upward.
Harry's eyes narrowed. "No, Draco didn't have a choice.
When they let go, Harry rubbed his back, but then looked past him. He saw the painting and began to laugh, which Draco was mesmerized by. Harry's laugh was his favorite sound. "A black square?"
"That's your job, certified Gryffindork."
There was an awkward silence but Harry played with his hand some more. They looked into each other's eyes. Harry was so speechless when saw how colored Draco's were.
Draco gave a weak smile, and Harry leant up to kiss him. The feeling made Draco tremble, and the rocking of the train made them break apart, Draco falling back against the wall, Harry against the sink. To solve the problem, Harry jumped and sat back on it, grabbing Draco's waist and pulling it forward, then wrapping his arms around his back. Draco grabbed his face and kissed him like it would be the last time. Because at some point, it would be. It was best to prepare now.
The phrase made him sick to his stomach. It reminded him too much of things that happened, too much of someone who hurt him so much.
"This is totally not fair!" Draco refused to let go. "I would've caught it if you weren't there! You absolute git."
"But—"
"No, Harry. Not yet," he said. "Bloody hell, we've just gotten back. I haven't seen you in months--"
“It most certainly is my business! I’m your boyfriend, damn it, I love you! I know you don’t have much credibility with love, but you have me. And if you’re hurting, it’s my business.”
"No," Draco spoke softly in his ear as he ran his hands over them. "They're not ugly. They protect you. They hold you."
—————————————————
"Oh, that's right, I forgot about that."
"I did, too."
"If you hadn't noticed, I've sort of hated you for years. Sometimes still."
But he didn't know that Harry was there with him, under the invisibility cloak, until Harry stepped in front of him as he reached for a book. His touch made Draco jump, but then he realized who it was.
Draco snapped up and covered his neck.
“Yes, Harry, we get that,” Ron rolled his eyes, “I think the entire Wizarding world gets that you’re in love with the bloke.”
"We all just miss him a lot," he hiccupped. "I miss you two."
"I love you so much," Draco mumbled into his neck. Harry smiled, "I don't think you understand how much this means to me."
"I won't need it," Draco smirked leaning in to kiss him, but letting go just before they touched.
"Men," Pansy shook her head. "You should probably pick a date."
"Well, we only meet up once a week. We're enemies in the hallway. We can't just have a chat. But missing dates, Draco never used to miss dates, at least not without telling me. But then again, he was angry."
"Yes, thank you, your honor." Pumblechook stood and walked in the middle of the room. "You said you were forced to get the Dark Mark."
"Draco," Harry shouted and he arched his back to him. The blonde smiled and raised his head so he was now facing the boy.
Draco just tried to contain himself and bit his lips. "Can we please stop talking about this?"
They carried on for a while, asking their "deep questions" and laughing at the answers given. Their butterbeers was finished and they still stayed, just talking, just like they use to.
"Can't see, four eyes?"
"What happened," he asked, sitting up.
But still, Harry climbed on top of him, and Draco wrapped his arms around him. He expected there to be clothes to pull on and something to grip, but there wasn't. And it was
"But that won't happen."
Arthur nodded. "You saved my life."
"No," Harry said. "Please, I don't want to get you in trouble."
"Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter, one more word from either of you and you'll find yourself riding home on the train, tonight!"
"I got lucky." He cocked his head to the side with a smirk on it that made Harry look so bloody wonderful.
"That's amazing."
And their lips met fiercely, the tang of each other's seed combining in their tastes, cocks already hardening again.
"ARRANGED MARRIAGE? What the FUCK does he mean by arranged marriage?"
"Are we eating in here?" Harry's eyes were wide.
"But how is it when none of us are happy? I-I'm not happy. Why am I still miserable?" Harry heaved a new breath. "You can't send me back to St. Mungo's."
Draco looked to the floor, his heart stinging. “I wanted to push you away but… It’s not worth it.”
"I love you so much." Draco rubbed his back, tears in his eyes.
————————————————————
And maybe that's why he had a mask. Maybe that's why he was so nasty to others.
Could he be falling for the Slytherin?
Harry grabbed Draco's wrist as an answer and dragged him along the grass and sand. When their feet touched water Draco immediately jumped at the arctic temperature and tried to run away, however Harry just tightened his grip on him and Draco was kicking sand with his elephant stomps.
"You're sleeping in the middle," Harry commanded, pointing at the bed. "You can't get up without waking me."
"I know."
"Wait so that means you have to have sex?"
Because it wasn’t a lie. If Harry wasn’t who he was, Draco wouldn’t have to worry about any of this.
"Yes, Draco. Do this for me. Making this tender would not.. I can't, Draco. Just bloody fuck me, okay? Make it hurt as long as you can. No lube. No preparation."
"Your nickname is Scarface, not Scarhead."
"All the bloody time."
"You're trying. That's all I care about." Draco let Harry fall the to floor. The statement made them both smile like morons. The two interlocked hands and walked over to the fire Harry had started. Both boys were wearing hoodies and pajama pants, however Draco's were made of silk and the finest wool, while Harry's were normal cotton. They also both had on their house scarves and a pair of black socks.
"I can make you dreamless sleep potion. It would help. We can stop sleeping outside," Draco suggested. Harry shook his head in agreement.
Draco fixed on Pansy. "Go on. What's it like?"
"After you bloody asked him, didn't you," Draco raised an eyebrow, looking up at him.
The scene in front of him changed.
It was what they'd worked for, why they'd hung on through all the war. And it was worth it. A million times over.
"What?"
"Would you like to walk on it in the snow," Draco snapped. "I should make you for being such a dumbarse."
"And then everything was clarified and since we were sworn enemies we decided not tell anyone. We dated for a few months and he broke up with me when I called Hermione a mudblood."
"Are you alright," Harry spoke softly and wiped the hair from Draco's forehead which caused the blonde to look back at him. "You weren't waking up."
It was the first time in his life that the physical gifts, the materialistic items, didn't bring him any joy whatsoever. He stared at them vacantly, and then back at the Gryffindors.
He could barely see, but when he opened his eyes to look into Harry's own, more drops fell from his eyes as he felt along Harry's back. Did it truly hurt so much to heal?
"It's an invasion of privacy," Harry pouted and sat at the table.
It was true. Draco's sweater vest didn't fit him as well, even after having it tailored. "Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Eating fine."
"I haven't smiled much. Not without you," he almost frowned.
"You've done so well. You did it, Harry. You've done your best." Draco lay next to him, rubbing his arm for a bit but also giving Harry some space. Harry's eyes lulled closed and Draco kissed his forehead. "Everything's okay. It's done now, love. You never have to do it again."
"It's your handwriting." Harry tossed it to him.
Harry smiled. Then, he grabbed Draco's hand and let his magic flow through him. Draco closed his eyes, and when he opened them, he was in Harry's bedroom at the Shell Cottage, him now the ghost of light, while Harry was real.
"Doesn't your nose hurt," Draco clenched as the burning on his arm returned. Was this supposed to happen every time he saw Harry? If it was, Draco craved to break up with him this second.
Wow, Longbottom looked nice when he dressed up. Maybe it was a newfound confidence for destroying a Horcrux, but
Potter dug in his bag and pulled out a thick stack of parchment. A finished essay.
Harry walked into the Great Hall when it was half filled and before taking a seat next to Ron and Hermione, he glared at Pumblechook slow and deathly. Pumblechook raised an eyebrow back before the realization hit him when Draco walked in crying. The man gave a smirk of satisfaction.
"You're going to hate me so much." Draco looked up at the ceiling, so close to breaking. His heart was wounded and sore. "I don't want to tell you."
"People die every day! Friends, family. Yeah... We lost Harry tonight. He's still with us. In here. So is Fred, Remus... Tonks... All of them. They didn't die in vain. But you will. Because you're wrong! Harry's heart did beat for us. For all of us! It's not over!"
It was like the real version of Draco and the weak version were in a tug-of-war in his head.
"Would you like to see my memories tomorrow?"
"King of my body," Harry whispered. Their noses rubbed against each other.
Harry looked up at the ceiling tiles as a war continued in his head. The glow from the hallway seeped in a bit of light.
"Yes, you can. You have to. No returns."
And staying with Harry meant he'd have to lie, and he'd lied plenty before, but not to Harry. He told Harry everything. He trusted Harry. For the most part. And there was no denying, Harry had become his best friend, and no one would ever replace that. Ever.
The slytherin nodded his head. He had, but they were alive, living within him, constantly biting at him.
Harry crawled back into bed, and a bit of time passed. He hadn't heard Malfoy get back into his bed. He looked at him: Draco was staring forward, blankly. His eyes were a bright mercury.
But Snape held firm. "The only reason you haven't been decapitated is because you gave him information that was sufficient for the few meetings you had with him. That information isn't going to matter if the mission doesn't get completed. You have no arsenal. You have no weapon. I would be surprised if you live through your next meeting with him without progress on the mission."
"The pleasure is mine," Draco smiled.
He grabbed his weak, limp hand and kissed the top of it. "It's okay, I'm here."
Harry shook his head, "'S good." And then he winced. "A little. Just take it slow." He laughed and winked at him.
"I'm never leaving Grimmauld Place again."
"Nothing."
“I originally wasn’t going to tell you this, but… I got a new nick name.” Harry raised an eyebrow quizzically. Draco took a big breath before answering. “Drackiepoo.”
"All the bloody time. Stupid things, small fights, and we'd end up laughing at the end. He can't tell the time of day to save his damned life. I yelled at him for it. We'd kiss. Honestly, not a problem. But
"Missed me much," Harry smiled while Draco buried his nose in his neck.
"Yeah, it's meant to be thrown at dickhead ferrets who enjoy playing with people's feelings, but I suggested we give it wings and put it in place of the snitch so that maybe next season you'll finally see it and win something."
"We made Lockhart go down to the Chamber of Secrets with us and when we found out the mystery he threatened to erase our memories. That's how he wrote those books, he stole the works from others by obliviating them. He used Ron's wand and it back fired."
"Draco calm down! Where are we going?" Harry said breathlessly. Why were they holding hands? Since when did Harry start calling Malfoy Draco? Did he just wipe off hair from Harry's forehead?
"Do you even look in the mirror? Harry, your hair is a mess!"
Draco licked his lips, trying not to wince. "Is that a dietary recommendation from one of your doctors? Are you cutting out gluten?"
Ron screamed into his hands.
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Hermione didn’t react, unlike Harry’s expectations.
"You're a shitty ghost." Draco's voice was small and cracked as he spoke.
"What, mate?"
"How, I don't understand," Harry asked, confused. He grabbed Draco's limp hand hand drew circles on it with his own hand.
"No, that's why your hair is always a rats nest." Draco barged in. "Let's just throw every spice ever made into one pot and use it in everything we cook—that'll taste delicious." He took a deep breath. "Different things have different purposes. It's important they're done in layers and it's important you take your time with them. Shower as long as you want." Draco laid them out in order as Harry looked at him, bemused. "This will change your life."
They were quiet for a bit, but Harry didn't work on his essay, and Draco didn't work on his either. Down the hall, a group of girls were giggling quite loudly, and they tried to ignore them.
"Yeah," Harry breathed, watching him. He couldn't help but adore the few strands of hair that went in his face, which was entirely concentrated. Another finger, and the burn was there but disappeared just as soon as it came.
“Like I’d let him win,” Harry smirked.
"How have you all been holding up?"
"Him and his stupid cult kill everyone I love. Sirius is dead because of me. If I'd learned Occlumency, If I'd just—"
“What are you doing,” Draco asked, turning back to Harry.
The first day of classes were spent in yawns, as Draco didn't get any sleep the previous night. What was he supposed to do about Harry?  All he could think about was the events of the previous night, the kisses, the laughs, the way Harry's thigh was warm up against his, hands held, touches, tongues, stories.
Draco nodded and looked at Madam Pomfrey. She cast the spell and a bead of light traveled from Harry's chest and into the air.
He grunted and struggled and tried kicking out of the restraints, but Draco's grip held too strong.
," Hermione asked.
His heart had never burned as much as it was. He'd never felt so horrible, so deceived.
"Ah. That's a funny name. Anyway—"
"How about once he gets to the intimate parts, think about Chang, the bitch! That'll cover me up hopefully."
Harry was going to answer with a whimper but stopped completely dead when there was another knock at the door.
"It was fake. Of course it was fake. I hated it. I feel really disgusting right now." Draco looked at the grass and swallowed.
Harry threw it back at him. "I have to win it back from you."
The cannons boomed and Draco had to resist everything inside him to run to Dumbledore, tell him to stop this. Draco's hair stood on edge. It never did that unless his father was towering over him.
. There was a group of Third Years who had turned the corner. Harry shoved him back. "Why don't you watch where you're going?"
Then they continued through Lucius's study, which was barren, a tearoom, a trophy room, and a library. They went upstairs into a ballroom. "Isn't this where you almost killed your dance instructor or something?"
Draco stirred from deep thought when knock knock knock at his door bounced off the walls. "Come in," he said, voice cracking in an un-Malfoyish manner.
At first, he thought the feeling of failure caused it. But as days passed, he realized that just before he fell asleep, his last thought was of his aching desire to have another kiss from Potter. Just one more. To make sure it was the action itself that caused his heart to beat faster. He even thought about kissing Blaise or Pansy or anyone, for Merlin's sake, just to confirm that kissing someone would bring this same feeling. Potter had nothing to do with him feeling dizzy when he thought about it.
Blaise sighed. "Since last night."
And even if he did, Harry didn't give him a chance to. He unbuttoned Draco's shirt and pushed it past his shoulders to reveal his marble, placid skin, it being decorated with two scars in askew, starting from just below his armpits, meeting in the middle of his pecks, just over his heart, and then going in opposite ways to his lower abdomen.
Harry took several seconds to gain control of the character he was playing, and then he obnoxiously wiped his mouth. "You're right. I felt absolutely nothing." But his voice was shaky and unconvincing. It was a lie. He felt warm and weightless and good.
"That far back?"
Draco nodded much more enthusiastically, this being a much easier answer.
Harry was a bit wobbly and using his magic to guide the broom was a bit tiring. He was already breathing heavy after one lap around the Pitch, and his abs hurt more and more.
"You are!"
"Who," Neville asked. Draco was about to speak but he got confused. Who was he engaged to? Legally it was Greengrass, in his heart and on his finger, it was Harry.
"Harry, I can't—"
"Yes."
"Yeah, you can rest here. Harry, is that okay?"
Because wouldn't that be a better answer? What if Harry forgot about him, too? He could move onto his life. He could enjoy himself.
"Until Death Eaters make it into the castle.”
"I'm fine," Draco said. His hair stuck to his blushing face. "Can you please put some clothes on?"
"Yes I am." He assured himself that the pocket watch was in his right pocket and took the girl's arm headed down to the Great Hall together, trying to keep himself from yearning Potter's arm instead. The one he had was too weak.
"My father only said five," Draco corrected. "I have more faith in you than you think. It was a compliment actually."
Harry waited a bit before speaking again. "Is that it or is there a punch line?"
next to some and I
"Okay."
"Draco, oh Draco, where for ought thou Ferret," Harry put his hand over his heart and made his voice light and almost feminine. Draco threw a pillow at him. "I feel like you would have cried at the ending of 'Romeo and Juliet,' though," Harry said in his normal voice. He then turned back to the bookshelf and put the book away.
Harry cast an alohamora on Draco’s door that morning and proceeded to jump on top of him in his bed waking him to a startle.
One never came.
"Never! I'm never going to let go of you! No matter what!"
“Fuck, my love,” Draco shouted. Harry trailed his empty hand to Draco’s balls, and cupped them, played with them, Draco squirmed. “OH!”
"It's like 5th year all over again, Draco." Harry continued reading.
"Granger would though."
"Maybe it's because you lie to him constantly."
Visions of Katie Bell up in the air filled his head, Draco sneaking into the girls' bathroom, not the boys'.
"Oi, mate! We have to go! You two can make out later," Ron shouted, hearing crashes and spell casting corridors down.
He was now the worst possible version of himself. Making Harry figure that out was killing him. And the thought that Harry was next door, feeling pleasure at the thought of Draco... it turned his stomach.
"Bloody hurt me! Whatever makes you feel good! It's whatever you want!"
"How's your sleep," Draco asked to change the subject.
"Greetings Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy," Blotting didn't break his stern face as he took a seat with the other reporters. The couple didn't return genuine smiles but they did flatten their mouths to a line.
When they reached the fifth floor, that’s when the problem started.
"Hey, you!" Draco repeated the saying every time they met. Harry walked up to Draco wrapping his arms around the other's waist, kissing him gently on the neck. This caused Draco to shudder to the touch of bare lips with pleasure, for the experience was new to him.
They all looked at each other awkwardly, but then Harry spoke boldly. "We're running away. I meant to tell you."
—————————-
Draco pretended that Harry knew everything and still accepted him. That he knew about the poison, he knew about the cursed necklace; he knew about the Mark, and he accepted and loved him, anyway.
He spun, and through the trees saw her hanging in the air, suspended by nothing. Four heads surrounded her, and Draco recognized the outline as Harry.
"You don't need to," Harry said darkly.
"I know we're young and it's a big thing to ask and with everything that's going on... I just... with everything that's going on, I wanted to give you a chance at a life that you could maybe want." He was so nervous. So so so nervous. "I'm sorry if I surprised you, I..."
"Until the Fourth Year, really. When You-Know-Who came back. We weren't enemies. I couldn't hate him because..."
"No, it's not," his voice shook, and he put his hands on Draco's arms. "It's not. I almost killed you." His lips quivered.
And then he looked in the pile for the other photographs. He found one had been lodged into one of the books and realized, after picking it up, there were the other four in it, too.
"No I'm not," the muffled shout carried its way to Harry's ears.
Now Draco was able to take another look at him, his translucent skin, his bony structure.
"You were there, you let your friends kill my parents," one of them frowned.
"So, no one knew about this...affair?"
"Harry, it's okay. I'm sorry." He rubbed his back, holding him.
"Nightmares?"
“We’ve had our differences. We’ve came across them,” Draco said, angry, his heart beating. “Nothing else.”
Fools. None of them had seen Harry Potter smile.
"A perfect way to end it." Harry smiled up at him, but then there was a voice next to them.
"Nothing bad is going to happen to you right now. You're safe here, okay? Safe is with me."
He didn't care if his brain burned. He didn't care if his stomach ached with ravishing hunger. He didn't care if he was crying or screaming.
"I'm not sure. When I calculated it out, it goes to the first day that we kissed. I've never seen it, not until we got involved."
"Get them," Umbridge ordered. Draco immediately let go of Chang and dove for Harry, grabbing him by the collar of his robes. He proceeded to drag him through the halls along with all the other members of the DA, wearing the largest smirk on his face he possibly could pull.
"What are you going to do about it, then? What can you do about it? What, you want to tell your father, who will probably give her a raise for it? You want to expose us so that she'll find out about you and ban us from seeing each other? Or maybe she'll just expel me so I never can practice magic ever again, and I'll never see you again because you sure as hell wouldn't come to the muggle world that you hate so much."
"Dean's bi, Seamus is gay. They've been on and off for years... Mate, I gave them dating advice."
"Objection your honor! Since said charges were accused at underage, shouldn't it be illegal to administer the potion?" It was an excellent point and Harry was surprised he could come up with something like that so efficiently.
"Ron. It was Draco Malfoy. I dated Draco Malfoy."
"I've had it since I was like four... no five..."
"Can you tell me the date?"
Draco rolled back over. How could he ever deserve someone like Harry. "Harry. Stop worrying about it. It's fine."
"You're one to talk!"
But nothing—no strength he'd formed, no muscle he'd built to hide his emotions—would work to hide how overwhelmed he felt.
"I want to be you're boy-.. boyfrrr... that thing."
"No no no no. It's not going to happen. You're safe here. You're safe with me, okay?"
"A little."
"Of what?"
"He's a Death Eater, Harry! Let him burn," Ron said, completely unaware of the conversation they just had. "He's worthless."
"I want you."
Draco, overwhelmed, pushed Harry away slightly, just so he could breathe, and he smiled as he caught his breath, Harry, too, on top of him, grinning. "You're wearing my jumper?"
Then Harry pulled on his tie to receive a kiss. "Fiancé."
It took several moments later for the laughter to calm down and Draco knew he was still red but he uncovered his face. He opened his mouth to say something but only a squeak came out before he shut it again, shaking his head and slamming his forehead on the table.
"Excited," Ron asked as Hermione fixed Harry's tie. They were standing in front of a full-length mirror.
The Daily Prophet was bent and messy, but he could still read the headline printed across the paper:
“We should make it look like we did,” Draco said solemnly. “Make me cry.”
Harry turned back to him, his eyes dilated.
Harry squeezed him. "I'm sorry... I can't stop thinking about Friday."
, Draco looked at him.
"To who? Haha, who am I supposed to be presentable to? The dead basilisk?"
"She has strict parents," he argued. "I get you want to know, but... what we do is between us. I'm sorry. You know I love you guys."
"No, it's bad luck!"
Harry learned he had to be careful with his tactic. There was relief from the pain, but coming back to reality was a hard crash. To do so, either Harry had to take the crash, or he could just... stretch his reality. Just a
"Glance up and stare at him longingly. Just do it!"
"Hey, you!" Draco repeated the saying every time they met. Harry walked up to Draco wrapping his arms around the other's waist, kissing him gently on the neck. This caused Draco to shudder to the touch of bare lips with pleasure, for the experience was new to him.
“Ecstatic above everything. It was such a big flood of relief that it was almost unbearable. I thought I was to die during the war, you know, and when I did walk to my death in the forest, I only thought about him and what I was leaving behind, so when it was all over, I couldn’t process that finally I could fully love him wholly and completely. Our entire relationship before the war, there was always a thought in my mind that I can’t get as close to him as I want because I will eventually have to give him away. I don’t have that anymore, thankfully, and when I wake up in the morning, that’s one of the first things I think of.”
"Not really, but I'll take it, anyway. And when I do, I'll write all about it." He hugged Harry tight. Then Draco gave Harry his. "I don't have any money at all, which has never happened before, so I had to make something from scratch. Sorry if it's not the prettiest thing in the world."
"Ah! Harry!"
Then Potter started laughing. It was so weird being so near to such a thing, someone laughing happily. "Snape had to teach you to dance."
Harry looked directly at him. "It's okay. Maybe one day, we'll laugh about this."
The scars crossed over his heart.
"No, Harry," Draco held firm.
"Marry- mhmm- marry mmme," he kissed.
Scorpius took the vial and poured it
Fun, a word Draco had always equated to weakness.
"I think seven, maybe ten."
Harry met him in the water half way, and Draco placed his forehead to Harry’s, attempting to soak up any warmth he had as he closed his eyes. “W-we need to flip the-the b-boat,” Harry shivered.
"You expect me to trust you with him," Snape said.
"I still want to hang out with you," Harry said once they reached the stone circle.
"He's the headmaster."
"Happy First Day," Draco kissed his shoulder.
"Rats," Harry stroked Draco's luscious locks. Draco smiled to himself.
"I... I don't have an answer for you... I don't," Draco gulped, "I don't really know why. I can't explain it," he looked off into the lake. "We've grown, times have changed. We have," he put his hands in his pockets and bit his lip.
"What are you going to do if I do," he smirked.
"If I ever meet them, I'm going to blow them up." It was a promise.
“You just wave a wand! Still counts. You bottom most the time-“
The ambiance of the room changed to one of such seriousness.
"That doesn't mean you can go around erasing your memory, you ignoramus!"
"Dad," Lily shouted out of shock.
"They can hear you," Harry snorted. Sirius raised an eyebrow.
“Alright,” Harry crossed his arms, “You walk over to him and ask him if you can be my Valentine, and if he says yes, then I will take you out all day.”
She looked at him.
A year ago, he wanted Potter off the face of the earth, but now, he couldn't imagine his world without Harry. He couldn't wake up to a world where he didn't exist.
"Do you remember what I called you? When we had that fight?"
Since the Hospital Wing visit, Harry drank a few bulking potions, but that wasn't to say his eating was getting better, nor was he gaining weight. It was just... keeping him there. In fact, it was almost an even greater mental battle before he drank them and he often forgot to. He preferred forgetting to because then he avoided said mental battle.
"Draco," Harry shouted, running up to him. "Draco, what's wrong with you?"
While Neville ran to get a few pies while they got started. Seriousness rang through the air. There was no joking around when it came to chess, and even when Harry would try and joke with him, he would just get a "Shut up, Potter."
"What's wrong?"
"Stop touching me," Draco pushed him away.
"Have a hickey," Ron didn't think about it, and Hermione hit his arm. "What? He does!"
Harry frowned. "You're not real."
Sex was fun. Sex felt good. Sex was safe.
“Well it only scares me that I might lose you again. I could never divorce you. I love you,” Draco looked him right in the eyes before kissing him oh so gently- he could barely feel it himself.
Awkward silence filled the air. "I'm going to shower," Draco swallowed, but then he smirked, "oh but before I go, I have something for Weasley."
"Are you responsible for this tension?"
"It's a promise ring, but I fully intend for it, when we come of age, for it to become more than that." Draco was so nervous he could barely keep the box still. "If you want it to be. It's sort of a promise, isn't it? If you want me forever, I'll give you my forever. I'll give you my heart."
“Hey, what do you think—Why do you look so nice?"
Harry winced. It was like he was under a microscope. "Please don't judge me about this. Don't change anything about how you see me or treat me."
“Really,” Harry scoffed, “Right.”
"Wait! When you grabbed them, did you check if they had a protectant charm on them?"
"It's okay. No body is going to hurt us." Harry was right. There were no other Death Eaters. Draco hadn't let them in yet. No one knew about them that would harm them. "Do you want to go to the Room of Requirement?"
Only his remedial group of friends could get a peep out of him. The absence of Harry was maddening. He wouldn't get much sleep at night, and sometimes the nightmares were horrific, enough to wake him instantly. They all contained Harry, one way or another.
“The fucking sex within itself is incredible! You know me. You do. And the thought of anybody else touching me makes me want to throw up, and the thought of anybody else touching you makes me want to kill them. I never thought that sex, especially with you, would be so… so… fuck! I can’t even describe what sex feels like with you! That’s another thing I hate about you! I can never think properly!
She crossed her arms. "Don't the people deserve to know that if Harry Potter is going to defend you at your attempted murder trial, that it's fair and honest, too? What about the justice system Kingsley is trying to build? You think that you getting away with your crimes will—"
He sneered. "Stop being stupid."
“He… he touched you?”
Dr. Barmer's face turned to one of sympathy. "I'm so sorry for the both of you. I truly am."
"Okay, sure," Draco somehow agreed.
“I understand, but we are doing all we possibly can right now for him. Just prepare for the worst, Mr. Potter, I would rather you not be blind sided,” she said quietly before leaving. Draco broke down again.
Harry's brow creased in thought. He crossed his arms over his chest. "But what does that mean? What are you going to be doing?"
"I don't care."
He leant back against the wall, taking several breaths as he continued looking at the pictures. Damn it, Draco was beautiful and perfect and amazing. And damn it, he wanted Draco so badly.
"No, I want to stay here with you!"
“We didn’t want anyone to know! And Harry apparently didn’t get the memo and thought I was tricking him again so we fought again and I kissed him for real while we were running and hiding from Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron.”
"They just use their first names, for the most part," Pansy added. "And instead of punching, they end up snogging. Then Draco comes back to the common room with a massive--"
"Well, I liked to read."
"Guess not." Harry stepped out of them, and Draco put his hand back, holding it as they made their way up the stairs, noticing a bit of soreness as some of the charms began to wear off.
“Hey, stop complaining, I was here first. You can be called ‘Professor Scarface.’”
"Harry," Draco's eyes watered. He just felt overwhelmed. Throat closing, he reached with a shaky hand and grabbed Harry's cheek only to make him to look. "Harry, don't you dare go back to sleep." He didn't say it as a warning, but as a precaution, to rip off the bandage: if Harry was to hate him, he may as well leave at the fastest and least painful opportunity.
He went to the ledge and leant against the railing, right where Dumbledore died. Then, without thinking, he sat down on the ledge and ducked under the railing so there was nothing holding him back.
"Can you tell Draco hi?"
But Draco stood there, knowing the answer in his core. He paused, sulking in his shiver. "I can't. I don't. I don't deserve you at all. You deserve so much better than me. I don't deserve to even look in your direction. I don't deserve to be standing next to you, and the fact that you're even aware that I exist is an act of your goodness and your kindness that I don't deserve."
And he felt his heart burn.
"To taste your parseled-tongue," Draco stood serious, and Harry, caught of guard, swallowed. His cheeks blushed a ruby.
"I-If I'll have you?"
"Tell me, Harry, would you have reacted that way," the Draco next to him asked, almost teased. "Would you have listened?" Harry just broke down next to him. "Why didn't you listen to me? I needed you!"
"Right, sorry. I haven't flirted in a while," Harry played it off laughing and backed off of him a bit, however kept his hand on Draco's arse, holding it. Damn, it felt good. Draco's heart beat quicker and his mind went blank. He bit his lip.
"You just kissed me... Blimey Potter, I didn't know you were gay." It was a Seventh Year Hufflepuff he'd barely seen before.
"Horrible. I wanted to punch his face in," Draco woke up a little bit more due to the anger surfacing.
At least the ghost would have this conversation with him.
"Mate, don't tell me you fell for that." Ron looked at him.
"Goodnight, oh ferret of mine," Harry smiled. Draco rolled his eyes slightly, still squinting due to his exhaustion. "I'll see you in six days?"
Harry smiled.
Draco wasn't expecting that answer... like at all. He expected so much more than that. He felt there was so much more than that.
"I... I mean it's justified, with me losing Sirius and everything... but you're not so I don't have to worry about it. Everything is okay, I'm okay."
"You will not visit him," he commanded.
"Okay, what is it?" His tone was playful.
The book rested at the bottom of the basket, beneath food, utensils, and cloth napkins. He placed it down next to Harry, who was looking at the sky. "Ooo, what's on tonight's menu? Last time was fun."
After helping Harry put on his headband, Draco took a special brush from the cabinet and dipped it in the muddy jar. He painted it on Harry's face, except his nostrils, eyes, and mouth, and Harry shivered. "Cold?"
"It doesn't matter."
The family smiled to him warmly and waved back at him as if it was an unspoken bond. Harry walked onto the platform and they all gave him big bear hugs and welcomed him and Ron as well as Hermione. They all turned and smiled at Draco eventually, and Draco bowed his head.
He didn't deserve Harry's arms around him and he didn't deserve to be able to put his arms around Harry. He didn't deserve Harry's laugh or Harry's smile or his eyes or nose or neck or lips.
," leaving Draco to wait impatiently for the reply. Merlin, he'd been screwing up.
"Are you okay, honestly?"
Harry took a deep breath. "It ends tonight, Draco. We don't have to wait anymore."
"Where should I start?"
quickly. In fact, I already have—"
"Mum, Dad, Lupin, and Sirius. And they'll be going soon enough since the ceremony is beginning."
It looked rougher than it did at Borgin and Burkes and when, after further inspection, he felt its broken magic. Horror froze the blood in his veins.
Harry woke up with the pressure of a heavy object on top of him. Oh yeah, Draco. They were chest to chest, legs intertwined and face to face... Somewhat. Draco had his mouth open and breathing on Harry's cheek, his chin digging into his collarbone.
"Whatever," Draco said, didn't even look her in the eye, and left without another word into the Great Hall. His eyes watered as he did so, and his hands shook. He'd never felt so uncomfortable in his life. His whole body yearned to strangle her; it itched and pricked and he tightened his fists.
Draco, finally, smiled greatly, like a dork. Like Harry's dork. He even laughed a little bit. "You're a goofy little horny bastard, aren't you?"
"Do it," Harry smirked. "Make me scream. I bet you can't."
"Nothing! I just don't see you two together."
Suddenly, the door slammed open, and they pushed each other apart.
Why did something as simple as a shower feel like an impossible thing? How much he had fallen: he'd beaten a powerful dictator who murdered his parents, saving hundreds of thousands of lives and a government takeover, and yet six months later he couldn't even leave his bed and bathe.
Lily turned to the storage room. "Ha!"
Harry swallowed sharply. "I just feel so guilty."
"I never thought I'd be sitting by the fire with a bunch of Gryffindorks, either, but look where I am now," Draco rolled his eyes. "Harry this introduction is awful," he told him truthfully.
Harry froze, his face hard. He eyed Draco's hand, and up along his arm, his throat slightly restricted. "Would you like to bloody tell me how I'm supposed to do that while I'm like this. It's like you're bloody asking for it."
"But..."
"I have blankets and heating charms." Draco hesitated. "I won't get your hair wet." He rolled his eyes. "Come on, it'll be fun."
“But please, for me?” Harry stuck out his bottom lip. Draco was about to talk but Harry cut him off again, “wait no, just kidding, you’re not going near that bitch, she could try and kiss you again.”
Harry burst out in laughter just imagining banana cream over either of their faces. But Draco was of course preferred since he knew he could personally help clean it.
And Draco let him have the bad day, just as he celebrated with him the next when he finished an entire bowl of soup, as well as had all of his IVs taken out. Regardless, he didn't leave him. And that's all the power that Draco had.
"Do you think this was a mistake," Harry joked.
Harry groaned.
"What," Harry turned around.
"What happened to him?" Pansy crossed her arms over her chest and frowned. "We were friends with him. You're his entire world. I can't imagine him not being into you."
Draco just smiled and captured his lips again, enjoying the sweetness, the calmness and absolute joy that came from their new and permanent reality.
And Draco thrusted. "Fuck, Harry!" Harry gasped and moaned and arched his back. He reached up and kissed Draco's neck when he could, but then he fell back against the pillow, looking up at Draco with dilated, wondrous eyes.
Everything depended on Harry.
Yes, he felt powerless right now in this moment, in this house, in this family.
"Draco, I really think you're over reacting. It's probably just a harmless relationship."
"Right," Harry said looking everywhere but in Draco's eyes.
"We almost did."
"Well, he'd be the one yelling at you and I'd tell you to follow your heart and if that means being in a silly, fun relationship with someone you love, to hell with all the rules."
"It's just, I've never really smiled before. Like truly."
"No you're not," Draco had to argue.
"You too."
"We aren't leaving here until we can," Draco demanded. "I don't care if it's all night. It's not like this is breaking into the vaults at Gringotts. It's just making out for Merlin's sake!"
"Funny, that's how I feel about all the things that you just listed."
Harry was dead. Harry couldn't breathe anymore. Harry's heart wouldn't beat anymore. Harry would never smell anymore. Or touch anymore. Or feel.
"Harry!"
"You think he actually put his name in the cup?" Blaise looked up from his bowl of cereal.
"Oh, Merlin," he put his head in his hands, and his shoulders shook, his sobs ringing through the deathly still hall. "What if I lose him?"
"My father won't allow it. And I'm sure You-Know-Who will have something to do with my summer, won't want the Golden Boy himself writing to the son of his best death eater." Harry's frown deepened.
"Merlin, I..."
"This girl is fourteen years old," Narcissa stood in horror, feet away from Lucius. "You're making her sign her life away."
--------------------------------------
"Y-yes." The veritasierum was working, how could he of just lied so easily!?
"Yeah, like here," Draco pointed to his heart and stomach and throat and brain and ended up giving up there.
When they released, their eyes locked and hearts raced. They gasped for breath, however Harry couldn't because of the sight of Draco's eyes and the heat of his arms wrapped around him.
"Be careful," Draco cried as he left.
This continued for a month.
“Every excuse is awful! There is only one excuse that’s keeping me from saying yes! Fuck, I need you so bad! Please Harry, just go! We can talk after. I’m aching for you!”
"My wand," he said almost angry. "The one you took from me."
“Father, what’s that on your arm,” 11-year-old Scorp asked. Lily gasped, her eyes widening.
"You should be glad that I wasn't in those classes of yours. You're really hot when you fight. I'd be way too distracted."
"Are you okay," one of the First Years asked.
"What can I say? Trouble finds me." Harry licked his lips. "I just hope it's not too bad. Unless Umbridge gets killed. That I'd be okay with—not like I'm wishing that. Only bad people wish that." He cleared his throat.
"If you don't do it for you, do it for me. For your family. You have to protect me, remember, like that time in the woods? You saved my life, remember? You'll have to do it again sometime and without you no one will protect me."
. He didn't feel he was handsome. "Er, thanks. You're good at hiding insults within compliments."
"What does that mean?"
"Okay, be safe."
Draco had to grab his cheeks and force him to stay put.
Draco took a breath and stood, "Get up."
"I've already let him stay much longer than he should have," she had caring eyes but she always had been a stickler to the rules, "it's much past visiting hours."
"Well come on then!" Draco was still standing 3 yards away from the broom. "Yes I only got one broom, I'm not that rich. Now hop on!"
"Shared rooms are excellent for morale, but for fantasizing about your boyfriend... inconvenient."
————————————————
Quickly, he checked it to make sure it wasn't bleeding, and the sound of rustling behind him made him bring his sleeve back down and button it quickly with shaking fingers.
"Luck is more like it. But we want better for you," Draco said. "We all can't run around with obnoxious scars on our foreheads, can we?"
"Harry!" He called as Draco walked away. Harry decided that even if he could never get Draco's memory back, he could always just try to make Draco fall in love with him again. It couldn't be too hard since he already had done it before.
Harry looked back at him. His eyes narrowed.
"Draco calm down. It's fine. I promise I'm not mad and I'm not broken or whatever he said. It was an accident. I forgive you. We punch each other all the time, I'm used to it."
, and everything in between.
"I've had this conversation three times today, two with Snape- right when you lot took Umbridge to who-knows-where, just now and here with you. I get it. We're idiots, fools. We'll deal with the details later, and I assure you there isn't anything we haven't heard. Rule 7, Granger."
"I'm alive and they're not."
Draco took his hand. "We always do."
"I....I really don't know."
"I dunno," Harry thought, "I don't want to work for the ministry, but maybe, after I get over my pure hatred for Kingsley, I'll talk to him about it. Maybe make some policies."
But then he realized—this is the last time he'd ever see Harry. Ever. He was going to be dead tonight. These were the last few hours of his life. There was no more Harry after this.
"He's the one who—"
"Like that, don't you," Harry stated as he looked up.
"Sorry. I'm just saying. It must be hard, but mate, you look like you're going to die."
"So what did you do before Hogwarts?" Draco's genuine curiosity was biting at him.
"Harry, it's not like you could help it-"
"We have to get out of here," Ron exclaimed, although he couldn't think clearly because the thought of Draco Malfoy clogged his brain. Were they trying to kiss?
"Where's your Father?"
Why was Draco dancing on glass? Why ask to take it slow and not love him as hard as he could in the time they had?
"S-sure," he hesitantly said.
"Good evening, Draco."
"I'd like to thank you for trusting the Prophet with this story. Kingsley and I had a very long talk following the war and how we reported our news. I can ensure you, our old model is long gone and we're trying to remain as unbiased as possible."
"I won't." He threw it on and made his way to the Snake Pit. When he arrived, he found it was less populous than previous years, with empty seats all over the compartment.
"We don't know when it happened, but someone erased your memory of Harry when you went to Azkaban."
"I understand."
"Would you let me finish," Pansy denied his ability to answer, simply because she just didn't want to hear another bratty response. But she knew Draco, she knew he was on to something for he had to be. The blonde never cared for any form of emotion, let alone love.
The door opened, and Draco jumped.
Instead, he watched Draco, who also cowered.
"Harry," Draco walked towards him in attempt to put a hand on his shoulder, to keep him from running, but Harry swatted his hand away.
"So," Harry started, his voice shaky but determined, "you all are probably thinking I'm a crazy lunatic right now, but that's okay, I think I am too. I'm honestly just improvising." A few people laughed. What was he worrying about? As Draco said, he's the eye candy of the wizarding world. He had to use it to his advantage.
"No." The mood in the air changed. It felt different and people were once again gasping.
"It's not," Harry shouted into his shoulder. His glasses bumped into Draco's skin and skewed across his face. Out of frustration, Harry grabbed them and threw them, further collapsing into his arms. "It's not okay. We're supposed to be together and happy and live together and love each other. We're supposed to grow old together!"
"Plants?"
Skipping to the evening, Draco was called up immediately after his last class to Umbridges office.
"Happy Anniversary, Harry."
"Absolutely terrified," Harry responded bashfully.
"You okay?"
"Of all people why him?"
"And probably more," Blaise raised an eyebrow before laughing suggestively. Ron just swallowed hard.
"You don't trust me. You think I would betray you like that?"
Harry smiled and rushed to the sink, pumping soap into his hands. Draco watched him, a look of amusement on his face. Scrubbing his skin, Harry caught sight of a stool across the room, which he pulled up at the edge of the tub after he finished.
"What," the Gryffindor scoffed, turning to Draco.
"Even when you found out you were gay, why didn't you tell me, Harry, I'm your best friend! How could I hate you for that?"
"Tomorrow's the day, huh?"
"A theory," Draco asked with a frown.
"Favorite vegetable?"
Harry's saving grace was the calming draught—though it only worked so much, and as weeks passed, he found himself having to take a higher and higher dose in desperation.
"The night that I found out about..."
"H-He's cute? Ha! Did you just make me say that out loud?" Draco stood, bewildered. "He wears peasant's denim three times too big, his hair is a doxy's nest, his glasses are bloody
Harry nodded and then Draco licked over his underwear, making Harry whimper. Then Draco took off the briefs and threw them behind him.
"I assure you," Draco spoke, "I won't fail."
"I hated you." Harry shook his head. Draco, after a bit of silence spoke softly, "I didn't want to be caught with the enemy."
Draco looked away from Harry to see the beautiful land that was speculated in front of him. The trees were ever so tall and the grass was ever so green. The sun was setting but the only thing he could look at was Harry.
"We're so glad you're okay," Hermione cried.
"Lily," Harry bit. "I understand you're angry, I get it, I was too when I found out."
Draco made sure to wait until he'd turned the corner out of the Potion's classroom. Draco pounced, grabbing his robe hood, then threw it over Hughs' face, pushing him against the wall.
"Good," Draco said genuinely. Harry should never be in pain. But Draco knew that wouldn't be the case this year.
“I can’t stand the thought of you at a wedding without me by your side.”
"And if I choose to get my memories back?"
She didn't say anything at first. "I forgive you. I just wish you would have told me you were gay. I dunno what my obsession is with gay men. First Dean, now you."
Draco casually leant against the wall at the top of the stairs.
"Since we've been flying, what has it been, four hours," he questioned.
"Me."
Both Pansy and Blaise laughed. Blaise cleared his throat. "Well, we should probably find out before we do it so we have the best chance."
"Bloody hell, Harry, they have quality leather and Persian rugs. I wanted to get a matching set--"
"Now what?"
Harry took a seat across from him as Malfoy reached into the basket and pulled out two pre-made plates. The china held a lobster tail, a green salad, and treacle tart for dessert.
"Yes, unless you have more questions."
Harry stumbled backward. There was a burn on his skin from where Draco touched him; a burn of hate. It felt evil and angry and made Harry sick.
"Are you okay?" Draco opened his mouth but footsteps marched outside the trolley door. They both froze. Oddly, Draco felt comfort from seeing the panic on Harry's face. Because in that moment, he wasn't alone in his fear, like he had been for so long. "What do we do?"
"Good day?"
"And have you casted unforgivables with this wand?"
"Sorry," she lowered her voice. "Come on, Harry, tell us about it."
Draco snorted, then searched for the blueberry with his hand. He found it on his pillow and ate it without even opening his eyes. "Breakfast in bed sounds nice."
And Harry did his best to keep from scratching the itch: if he told Ron about Draco, maybe he'd give him some better insight of how he was acting.
His stomach, Malfoy fed, knowing how hard food was sometimes. Fuck, how was he supposed to eat?
"Well so will every other wizard in the Wizarding World when the Prophet gets a load of this one."
"It's not that." It was.
Draco invited Harry to go to the Three Broomsticks and get butterbeers afterwards.
Draco took a deep breath. "Before what happened with Quidditch? And you still do?"
"Oh my... Merlin." There were ten beds surrounding a circle. There were red walls and red sheets and red curtains. Red posters and lion's and just... red. "It's. Just. Everywhere. It... it doesn't go away. It's just red and red and red and more red—it's hideous!"
Chatter and laughter filled the room. "Oi, shh shh shh. He talks about me?"
"I haven't found anybody," Harry spoke again after it quieted down, only to raise his ringless finger.
Harry's first wave of unbearable grief passed after quite a while. Hermione sat at his bedside and grabbed his hand, while Draco held him.
"You're saying it like we went on a date, not almost get murdered."
“Well, I lied about how many times I’ve kissed her,” Draco started. Harry rose and eyebrow and he could see the anger starting up again. “In fact one night…” Draco dropped off and got choked up, “You know this is really hard telling you this Harry.”
"Now," Harry said simply. Draco rolled his eyes before turning to the three boys.
"Alright, how about tomorrow before the chess match," Seamus suggested.
From the other room, they suddenly heard screaming, and not just any screaming, but bloody curdling, heart-stopping screaming. Harry flinched, however Draco remained firm with a frown.
"Good night, Draco."
"Hughs," Draco called in the hallway following a Potions class a few weeks after he and Harry broke it off.
“Do you want to make it seem like you’ve really moved on?”
“When did you get this?”
"Have your eyes always been that green," Draco finally asked.
Both boys didn't get any sleep the rest of the night. Either because they were too afraid or they just couldn't. Skipping to their first class, DADA, Harry presumably got there early, mostly because he didn't want to see the look on his friends faces. He knew he looked horrible. He didn't need to hear it.
"Taking a souvenir, are we? Don't let it stab you. You'll die. I know that from experience." Looking at the snake was like, oddly, meeting an old acquaintance. It surfaced a year full of memories he cherished. It was all about the adventure back then. Figuring out the mystery was almost fun, and it was such an escape from the Dursley's. Now, Hogwarts wasn't the same and Voldemort was alive.
“Ready?”
There was nothing Draco could say to make it better. So he just breathed.
But unfortunately, that was the plan.
"The mission," he strained. "I need to focus on it." Harry's stomach dropped as he said it.
"Okay, I need you to have an open mind before you try it because it's a classic Muggle sandwich."
"I love you, too," Draco smiled and kissed his lips. "Now hurry up, we've got an hour until the ceremony."
The second part of the plan involved planting seeds, giving things for Harry to worry about and conclude that it was all fake, if it was ever needed. Really, Plan DBR was a backup, Draco never wanted Harry to find out, though that seemed impossible given he had to sneak in Death Eaters into the castle by the end of the year and assassinate the Headmaster.
The group passed them and turned the other corner.
Harry, still completely passed out, said Draco's name in his sleep, and his heart melted on sight.
"No," Harry smiled. "That's okay. I was joking. I'm a bit nervous, too," Harry admitted, scooting closer to Draco so their legs were touching, and Draco put a leg though Harry's warm ones, tangling them. "Which is funny because we're literally already married.
"We didn't have to come in here," Harry said, feeling guilty.
"No," he cried. "No no no no! No don't tell me—"
Harry didn't mind holding her hand. If he and Draco were ever able to get married, Narcissa would be his mother-in-law. He could have a living mother tied to him legally.
"Oh Merlin, I don't want to know," Pansy heaved as if she wanted to throw up and covered her ears, running away with Blaise hand in hand. Draco and Harry just chuckled.
All the years they had together led up to this moment.
Draco couldn't stand the noise, it made him want to turn into an animal and fuck his mouth harder, but he restrained the urge.
Harry hung by his arm, swaying in the wind as he gripped Draco's wrist, and Draco gripped Harry's. He smiled up at Draco, who, if he wasn't fifty feet in the air, would literally kill him. Literally kill him.
“That morning we went to the forest, and I told you I’d meet up with you. I went looking for it.”
"Potter—"
"I don't even know where to start."
Harry's heart raced, his face tingling and numb from the spell that Hermione had used on it.
"Harry," he growled and tightened the fist holding his shirt collar, and he put his wand to Harry's throat. His lip still quivered.
"I wanted to say that I'm sorry how I've been acting, and I'm sorry how I've treated you," he said, but didn't mean. She didn't say anything back, but raised her eyebrow. "I've had a lot on my mind, with... the mission," he swallowed, "but I've decided I wanted to worry about my personal life a bit-"
Harry didn't quite care to know what that meant.
But Draco couldn't comfort him. He couldn't hold him this time or ever again.
"Or a million galleons worth of moisturizer."
"How do you think you did?"
"Harry!"
"No, it was good. You've never done it before. You can't be mad at yourself. How are you supposed to get it right on the first try? How are you supposed to know how to do something you've never done before? No one does," Harry said encouragingly. "It took me months of lessons with Lupin. It's really advanced. You'll get it."
"No!"
Draco was quiet a little bit before saying, "don't be. It's not your fault."
"I wasn't planning on..."
Draco looked her straight in the eye. "Break his rib. Buy some time, at the very least."
Harry looked up at him. "Nothing."
Snape sent everyone to get their supplies from the storage closet and pairs got to work. Ron and Hermione were put together, lucky them. Throughout the class she gave Harry a sympathetic look or a shy smile, while Ron sat there and didn't even look up.
"Because I realized..he wasn't the enemy anymore. I always thought he was but when I met You-know-who, I realized Potter was just a pest. Although he was bloody annoying in 6th year and stalked me wherever I went, I couldn't blame him. If I was in his shoes, I would do the same. I was too daft to see that. He saved my life, I've saved his. I don't know what you'd call that but, we aren't on speaking terms."
While looking for the illuminated snitch, Harry "mistook" a firefly for the object instead, and headed for the trees outside of the arena. He was now hanging from a tree, his broom stick laying on the dead branches beneath him. "Could you go any faster!"
"Don't knock it 'til you try it."
"Red. Like a ruby. Like love," he yawned.
Still, Harry said nothing.
"You've found a cure?"
"Come on, you bloody fairy," Harry smirked. Draco rolled his eyes at the comment and made his way to where Harry was standing.
"19 times," he bit.
"Shut up. You can't tell anyone." The voice in response was deep.
"So a dog! Yes! We'll be getting a dog!"
“What do you think? We just got chased out of the castle.” Slughorn gave them a look of uncertainty as they sat together. “Sorry we’re late, Professor.”
"Chandelier... But sorry about that, too."
"Love you. There's a lot of those, you got to narrow it down."
"I know," Draco said. "And I'd like to keep going. Forever, Harry. I want you forever." That was, for once, the truth. He wanted him. Always had. Always would.
"You don't remember anything from our first time?" Harry was practically begging at this point. Draco was silent for a while. He knew telling Harry he didn't even remember losing his virginity was going to be like killing him. "Please Draco," his voice cracked.
Three weeks into classes at full blast, the two woke to a normal day.
"Yes."
"You know this is going to be hard."
"It was nothing bad. Just went on about how you slept on a cot and ate adrenaline for breakfast before the war. Oh, and how you 'fucking died.' And then we banged for seven hours, and therefore you were going to sleep for however long you fucking wanted."
"Yeah, I mean I've planned this for a while," Harry said low, pulling out the correct number of galleons.
Until Harry nor Cedric arrived. The professor's below looked at each other with confused and fearful faces.
Suddenly, Draco's chest contracted and his breathing became shallow.
“Where are they? Lil and Scorp?”
"Is that it?"
in cursive, poised handwriting, and the silver read
Draco debated on telling him but decided against it. "He was just being an arse."
“Tuesday?!”
"Luck. Probably cheating somehow."
And speaking of mourning: there were too many people to even do that, so if he started thinking about Remus and Tonks, he felt bad for not thinking about Sirius, and then Cedric, and then Lavender Brown, Collin Creevey—
