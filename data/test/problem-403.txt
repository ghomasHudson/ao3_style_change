Without a word, the blond took his place and was submerged into the pensieve. When the memory was finished and he extracted himself from the dish, the expression his face held was shock, but also had a hint of understanding.
Draco faced out the window and swallowed the knot in his throat. They didn’t speak for the rest of the ride.
With pressurized grinding and rubbing, it only took a few moments for them to reach their climaxes, and not surprisingly at the same time, before they came back down, panting hard and raggedly.
When Harry finally caught his breath, it was then knocked out of him again as Draco tackled him into the sand. Draco kisses him hard and full, then. He kissed him passionately and lovingly.
The next morning, Harry and Draco made their way to St Mungo’s to speak with Healer Walkins about their situation once more. Ron and Hermione needed to visit his parents, saying to go without them, and that they’d meet up later to discuss what information the two had acquired.
Draco sighed. He was hoping Harry wouldn’t have noticed that. It must’ve been important to him though, if he’s bringing it up a while later. Clearly, he’d been thinking on it for some time. “I guess I’m just, I don’t know….”
When he got to the hallway he knew the Minister’s office was on, he continued down the hallway till he came to Harry’s office. He knew it was Harry’s because on the door was his name in the same golden glow as Draco's was on his cupboard in the basement.
Everyone that knew Draco knew he was gay. Those that he’d gone to school with had all found out by their eighth year, when he decided that after the war it was safe to come out. He’d started figuring out relationships with other boys and how he felt towards them. Of course, then surfaced the long-time admiration he had for the Boy Who Lived, which he’d spent most of his life burying under the anxiety of his world and desperation for survival during the war.
The morning of the interview, Harry was meant to meet the reporter in a small cafe a few blocks west of his home. As he was getting ready to leave, he saw Draco shifting on his feet by the door, his bottom lip pulled in between his pearly white teeth, his eyes cast down at his shoes and his eyebrows furrowed. He looked worried.
As soon as Draco Malfoy walked into the courtroom, Harry Potter's senses were assaulted with a scent like no other. One that could only be described as purely Draco Malfoy. Something similar to spearmint, soap and maybe sugar?
“Well, you can stay if you want to. Kingsley wouldn’t mind if you took the afternoon off. There are others that could do your work if you wanted.” Harry said, rounding his desk and sitting in his overly large chair.
“You said to call when I got over myself.” Draco slowly turns back to him, slightly intrigued by what he has to say. “I’m over it- better now. Please, it’s taken me this long to finally face you. I can explain what happened. I promise it’ll make everything more sensible. And if not, I’ll never come back and you don’t have to talk to me again. Just hear me out?”
Less than 10 seconds later, the fireplace roared and a blond head fell through, and Harry let out a breath he wasn't aware he was holding. They dusted themselves off and Harry gestured around them "Welcome home."
“What are you doing here? Not that I’m not glad to see you…” Harry said, running his hands through Draco’s hair.
“I noticed you left your clothes down in the basement by the washer the other day. I know you aren’t familiar with muggle technology, but you could've just as easily used magic. Is there a reason why you don’t want to?”
“I’ll see you later.” He said with a smile as he walked out the door. Draco didn’t even spare him a glance as he turned and walked up the stairs. Harry sighed and shut the door behind him before walking down the steps and headed towards the cafe.
He eventually moved towards Harry, wanting to tease but not upset, or Merlin forbid enrage. The amount of energy that surged through the room could have well enough been the energy used when he got mad. No, Draco didn’t want that.
“Woah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. You think, actually and genuinely think, that I did this on purpose?!” Harry stood in shock, regarding his Professor.
Draco stayed quiet for a moment. He didn't trust his voice so he squeezed Harry a little in response. He really didn't want to let go.
“Well, I assumed that, based on what I read about this particular prophecy, it says that because of a conversation they partook in, at a vulnerable point in their day, the prophecy had punished them as a warning for such behaviour.” Hermione explained briefly.
“You know how we went to Mungo’s a few days ago?” Draco nodded. “And you know how you were worried about me loving you? Like, you didn’t believe I actually could?” Draco looked away, but nodded again. “Why? Why didn’t you believe I could’ve loved you without it being proved to you that it was actually me having those feelings for you?” Harry didn’t sound patronizing or angry, just inquisitive.
“Ha, yeah. I suppose it’s better now that it’s not so empty, eh mate.” Ron laughed as Harry pushed him away.
Draco felt bad for bringing it back up, and with the look on Harry’s face, so was he. “No, I’m sorry Harry. I didn’t mean it like that. I was just worried.” He tried to peer into Harry’s face. “Can - do you forgive me? I really didn’t mean it.”
Draco was stuck. It seemed he truly couldn’t escape the fate the prophecy had decided upon the two of them.
An auror appeared at Harry's side immediately as two escorted the blond out in the opposite direction. Harry noticed he still had a shocked demeanour, probably at Harry's shouting.
“I, well, Proffessor Trelawney stopped me in the hall today and said something to me. I’m just confused with what it means and what’s going to happen.”
Harry stayed seated as the room cleared out. He quickly glanced over at Draco who was sporting a very panicked expression. The urge to hold and comfort the small Omega was almost too strong.
Harry stood and walked over to a large and beautifully carved hutch in the corner of the room. He opened a drawer and shuffled around a little inside before pulling something out and sitting back down in front of Draco. “I forgot to give this to you earlier. I remembered I had it at your trial but forgot to return it.” He said, handing over Draco's old Hawthorn wand.
Draco threw his head back in laughter. “Yes, yes I would.” Harry beamed at him. “Holy shit, Harry Potter is my boyfriend.”
Meanwhile, the golden trio sat at the head table in silence, feeling like shite for the golden boy who had just given his oldest enemy his everything. It’s not that Draco hadn’t proven himself over the past couple years, maturing gracefully and acting like a true gentleman. That’s all his friends tried to tell him - Draco’s not as bad as he thinks. And it’s not that Harry didn’t believe them, he could clearly see the change the blond had gone through. He just didn’t know if he could trust his own judgment, or that of his friends. As they sat quietly, playing with unused utensils waiting for the meals to arrive, they watched as their relatives mingled with Draco’s family. Harry sadly glanced around the room, wishing more than anything that his parents were there to help him through this. Ever since they were cursed and killed when he was a young boy, everyday he wished they would come back. Alas, they never did. It never stopped Harry from wishing though.
Finally, when he was able to, Harry found himself talking amicably with the oldest Wesley kid, Bill. They had become so immersed in their conversation, neither of them realized two hours later when Harry was to leave for his honeymoon.
“Fuck, Draco! You’re going to be the death of me.” Harry said, wrapping himself around Draco’s bent body, sniffing his neck again.
"Harry? Harry!" Hermione snapped her fingers, quickly bringing Harry's attention back to her. "This is serious. He must have just recently manifested, otherwise we would've been aware of this a few weeks ago." She said, more to herself than her boys as she started pacing the narrow hall they were waiting in. She turned and faced them both with wide eyes, "He could get hurt. Newly formed Omegas can be very sensitive and fragile at first. Harry, you really have to restrain yourself from him if you go back in there."
Draco, startled from Harry’s presence, spun around with wide eyes before he quickly realized who it was. “Oh, um, yeah, could you? I can’t quite reach the mixer.” He said, smoothing out a dark plaid apron that covered most of his front.
During sixth year is when he realized what all the hype was about the golden boy. He was the perfect being: handsome, casual, daring and loving. He was everything Draco wanted.
I don’t know how I feel about this chapter, to be honest. More poor Draco- it’s a theme. Oh yeah, and smut.
Harry grabbed Draco’s hair and pulled it to one side, exposing his long neck for him. Draco immediately knew that Harry had switched back on his scenting and was about to get the biggest whiff of Draco yet.
They talked about how they were going to deal with this new situation Harry got himself in. Harry did feel blessed though, because despite getting himself in such a mess, his friends were there to help him, and for that he was very grateful for. They talked until it was dinner time, in which Dean had to unbind Malfoy from his state of petrification.
Harry hummed happily. “What are we?” Draco nodded. “Whatever you'd like us to be. I just want to be with you.”
“Why would I, when I have you?” Potter said with a quirk of his lip. It was immediately wiped off at the wide-eyed look Draco shot at him.
“No need to worry Potter. It’s quite alright. I hope I can help you with whatever it is you need.” Kingsley replied, folding his hands on top of his pristine desk.
Harry winced and tried to reply with an apologetic smile for his earlier outburst, but the Minister turned his back and started speaking to one of the aurors. Harry watched as the auror nodded to whatever Kingsley had said, and gestured to another auror that stood in front of the side door that Harry knew was where Draco was being held behind. The auror opened the door and out came another auror, gently guiding the pale-looking Omega to the seat in the middle of the room again.
Because sex isn’t what you want, his mind supplied. Which was true. Draco loved it, don’t get him wrong, but he wanted to be with Harry in more than just a platonic way, even if they were being intimate. He wanted Harry to want to be married to him for more than just sex. He wanted Harry to want to be married to him because he loved him. He wanted Harry to feel about him the way he felt about Harry. But no, you can’t always get what you want. You get what our given, and you have to find a way to make it work. That’s just life.
Harry sighed, still in a mood, and got comfortable as Healer Walkins began casting her spell tests. After twenty minutes or so of her checking and recording his vitals, magical core strength and any other key physical tests.
Harry’s hands found Draco’s hips and sat up, pulling the blond onto his lap. They continued to snog for long minutes, taking small moments to press their foreheads together as they caught their breath. They kissed and made out for longer than either of them could tell.
“Woh woh woh, Draco.” The blond looked up at him expectantly, his hands still threading through the string.
When Malfoy’s eyes landed on him, the foggy mist that invaded his steel-blue orbs seemed to dissipate. His eyes lit up, and a smile bigger than any Harry has ever seen on anyone, let alone on the blond, graced his features.
Things between Harry and Draco are speeding up considerably. They get jobs. They make love. Vanilla smut ensues, nothing too explicit.
When they separated, Draco dove beneath the waves and started exploring the underwater world that lurked beneath them.
“I want to go swimming, the water looks so nice right now and it’s so warm out.” Draco laughed through Harry’s tender assault.
“No!” He yelled after Draco. “You don’t get to do that! You can’t make a big deal out of something and not tell me why. You want to do this thing together? Communicate with me!”
“Yeah, alright. No, it has been nice having someone else around. Since Sirius left, it got a little lonely. Then with you and Mione moving in together, I felt a little left out. It’s stupid, I know, but Draco is so much, MAN, you know? Like he just fits in everything so perfectly. My hobbies, my habits, my life. I like him a lot.” Harry said, a dreamy look on his face.
"I’ve noticed that you're different. You've changed a lot since Hogwarts, I mean. You're quieter, more polite, and I haven't heard you insult me at all since I saw you yesterday." Harry said with a light laugh.
Harry didn’t know this yet, and Draco intended on keeping it a little secret for now. He knew Harry wouldn’t feel any different if Draco told him, but just in case, he didn’t want Harry to shut him out like he did with his scent.
“Well it’s only proper, seeing as we’re mates, soon to be bonded.” Draco said with a hopeful glint in his eye.
She peered behind Harry to see Draco Malfoy and many shopping bags at his feet. “I see. Had fun, did you?” She laughed.
Harry’s just tidying up his papers from the day after getting a memo from Kingsley saying that he’s free to go for the evening, when his Omega walks in, looking tired and disgruntled from a long day’s work.
As soon as they landed in Harry’s apartment, having Apparated from a nearby alleyway, Harry was on Draco within a second, hands grabbing and groping Draco once more.
“Severus! Good to see you. I’m feeling fine, by the way. I could use a shower though, cleaning charms can only do so much.” He fidgeted, as if the dirt on his body grossed him out. “Say, Harry, care to join? There’s enough room for both of us.” The bastard winked again.
So yes, he cried. Sobbed, in fact. Tear after hot tear burned his reddened cheeks has he stood in the tiny loo, on the way to their honeymoon destination. He didn’t leave the bathroom for another twenty minutes, until once he decided he needed to stop crying, lest he die from dehydration.
Dreadful colour, he thought with disdain (mainly because he was in a shitty mood that he was here at all), silver would’ve been better.
“Haha, funny.” He said as he watched Draco giggle himself into a ball on the bed. He crawled over top of him as he calmed down. “I don’t know why now, or why at all, or how… but I love you, and I can’t wait to spend forever with you.” Harry said to him.
“You’re so gorgeous, Draco. And that man was a fucking creep.” Harry growled deeply, leaving Draco’s hard cock to throw a wet tantrum in his pants. “I would’ve fucking ended him if you hadn’t stopped me.”
The next moment Draco was alone. He sat back down and waited for this Abraham to come and help him with this job he wasn’t excited for in the slightest.
Finally once the classes ended, Harry gathered his things and approached Snape’s desk, where he sat, flipping mindlessly through parchment. Malfoy followed closely behind him, but keeping a good physical distance.
Harry really didn’t want to frustrate her, so he continued begrudgingly. “Well, we talked about mates and I might’ve mentioned that I found mine and he asked so I told him that it was him and he said that I was his. Or so he thinks.” He decided to leave out the part where Draco had a panic attack and that he held him for several minutes. “So yeah. That happened. And we’re together now.” He looked up to see her expression.
Draco shook his head and sighed. “No, that's not necessary. I'll just have some of those potions you use.”
Draco looked at the hand, then up at Harry, and then back to the hand. He didn’t forget about the previous night’s activities, he just wasn’t expecting Harry to all of a sudden be waking him up with tender touches. It felt so normal, so loving that Draco’s heart couldn’t handle it.
“Draco.” Harry ground out. Draco stopped moving. “Tell me, or you're going to be sore from sitting like this.”
“Anyways,” Hermione cleared her throat. “Never fret, I won’t tell anyone. However, it does apply to what you were doing, along with what you said, when you said it and had your accident.
Draco glared at him before attempting to extract himself from Harry’s big hands. It was impossible to talk to this man seriously, Draco discovered.
A hand snuck down between them, undoing Draco’s trousers’ button. Harry tried his best to remove them with one hand, but a few minutes and a sore forearm later, he’d given up trying to do it while still on top of Draco. He stood up and in one quick motion, relieved Draco of his burdening clothing. He giggled lightly, while Harry stared at his half hard prick.
He was already hard, everything that morning just setting him off a little more, and now Draco was trying to finish him off. All Harry wanted to do was rut into his little lithe Omega, but he needed to talk to him first. By some strength from Merlin, he rolled off and onto the bed beside his mate.
Draco just winced as he picked up one of the flabby cake things and plopped it onto his plate. He drizzled some of the syrup on top, cut a small piece off and brought it to his mouth. He looked up to see Harry watching him intently. With a raised eyebrow, he bit into it -
He grunted. “Draco…” it may have sounded like a warning, but Draco took it as an incentive to continue.
People had started saying that Draco had used the imperius curse on Harry, to use him for fame, fortune, everything. Then they moved onto saying that Draco was threatening Harry, then that he had kidnapped him and was using threats and magic to control him. Now they’re back with the imperius, saying that Harry could never love such a monster, an ex Death Eater. Harry continuously denied these accusations whenever they would go out. Draco would get verbally and physically abused when they were out in public, so he just resorted to staying at home, and Harry soon joined him. They were getting angry with how horrible everyone turned after Harry’s confession, and were desperate to put a stop to it.
Harry sat on the edge of his seat, his Alpha senses coming into play at the newly formed Omega that sat before him. He wanted to reach forward, tuck the piece of hair behind the blonds ear, and stare into those steel grey eyes that he so vividly remembered. He wanted to trace the sculpted features of the blonds face, run his hands through the soft locks that fell effortlessly back, and stare deep into those grey eyes that always took his breath away.
“You got that cov-” Draco started repeating, but before he could finish, Harry waved his hand (wandless magic is nothing when you’re as powerful as a dark-wizard killing Alpha), and Draco gasped loudly, arching repeated off the bed.
Hermione looked at him thoughtfully. “I wouldn’t kill you, no, but you might just end up burying yourself in guilt because you won’t give him a chance. Trust me on this one, Harry. It’ll count.”
As Harry sunk down into the steaming water mixed with a muscle relaxant (he was getting too stiff, dealing with Draco and his totally unpredictable moods), he moaned lightly at the soothing sensation. Dealing with Draco was like taking care of a petulant child. His head was throbbing, his muscles aching, and his magic thrumming. He felt off kilter, all of his senses, magical and non, telling him different things. And then there was all the issues Draco seemed to want to cause, stressing Harry out even more. What happened to the beautiful, haughty, Slytherin Omega Harry took into his home all those weeks ago? He really liked Draco, but man, the things the boy springs on him, plus his mood swings?! Harry can’t control him on his own.
Lo and behold a sneeze should tickle his sinuses. Draco had just enough time to stop kissing Harry and turn his head away before the sneeze exited his body, along with two others.
After taking a bite of his chocolate bar last night and holding Draco's hand, he decided that he needed to stay away from him as much as possible, if only to protect Draco from his Alpha-like tendencies. He didn't know what he was capable of, and he didn't know what he would do if he were to accidentally hurt him.
“Anyways, I hadn’t realized he’d cast it until I had already met you at the bar. By then it was too late, and it hadn’t worn out until an hour after you’d left. It was bad and a low blow on their part. I gave them hell for it this past week, especially Seamus. Trust me, it wasn’t how I intended the evening to go. Yeah, I was feeling all of those things, but they were enhanced and I wouldn’t have actually acted upon any of them in real circumstances. I understand if you hate me for embarrassing you like that, and if you don’t want to see me again. Originally I was just going to leave you be, but you deserved to know the truth about the whole thing. If you don’t believe me, I can show you memories or you can use veritaserum, I wouldn’t mind.”
The words “please don’t,” that came from the blond made Harry’s heart squeeze. They sounded so sad, lonely even.
He distracted himself with the easy and relatively mess-free task of making some tea, and after grabbing a warm cuppa, he went out to the small backyard and sat in one of the old deck chairs. The afternoon air was calm and warm. There were a few birds chirping in a nearby tree, but the overall experience was exactly what Draco needed.
Harry glanced at Ron, begging him to help him. Ron knew about Harry’s panic attacks - he’s had them ever since third year at Hogwarts. Ron always helped him with them, and he knew by now that the only thing that really helped pull Harry out was contact. Warm, comforting, bodily contact really helped bring Harry back.
The interview was coming to a close as Anne, the interviewer, said she had a few final questions for him. She’d already asked the exact same or very similar questions to those that Draco came up with, regarding Harry’s employment, position in the ministry, any present or future projects he planned to put into action, and many, many more. She also briefly asked about Hermione and Ron, another thing Draco was right about. But she was yet to ask about his love life, something he was dreading.
Draco just stepped back to let her in. She thanked him and handed him a cup of tea. She stepped in the room. “Oh, wow. I haven’t been in here in a long time. Harry’s told me what you’ve done with it. It looks wonderful.” She slowly spinned and took in her surroundings.
Draco nodded. He was constantly being told they dealt with memos too. Weird fucking system, this was. “Why not send all the mail through Ministry halls.”
Draco squawked. “I am not!” He said, beyond insulted that Harry would say such a thing about such a proud Slytherin.
“No, I’m going to wait until you're mine, baby.My bonded Omega.” Harry said sweetly, squeezing Draco for effect.
But when his new husband didn’t want anything to do with him, and all he wanted to do was show Harry how good he could be, the metaphorical door of redemption was slammed in his face.
“You’re good at Quidditch.” Draco said after a moment. “Great, actually. Fastest, youngest flyer, you are. Were, I guess. You should think about pursuing that.”
Draco hears the familiar crack of apparition and the front door open and close, followed by booted footsteps.
“Quite.” Snape said. “Although, your behaviour in my classes this past year has improved drastically, so I suppose I can overlook the mishap without deducting points. Nevermind that now. I wanted to discuss your and Mr Malfoy’s predicament. I am particularly disappointed in you that you would so carelessly cast an unknown curse at a classmate, no less. I am aware that you have been punished enough by your head of house, as well as having to watch over Mr Malfoy, which is punishment enough, I believe. However, you did seem to take on the task without much issue.”
Draco did have a great deal of papers and envelopes in front of him. He picked one up off the table, flipped it over, and dropped it back down.
“Well, um…” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck in a nervous manner. “I asked you a question yesterday, and you just left. Same thing after the kiss. I just wanted to know why.” Draco didn't say anything so Harry rambled on “I just hope I didn't scare you away, because there is something serious I need to discuss with you.”
“What has gotten into you?” Draco giggled as he pushed Harry’s head away. “You, stay put. I’m going to shower.” And with that he closed the door and stripped.
I'm seriously hoping to get this story done soon. I have so many more that I want to finish, I just never have enough time for them. Hope you enjoyed this update!! :)
Harry’s eyebrows knitted tightly together at the question. Alright? No he wasn’t bloody alright! His head hurt, his throat was dry, his lungs burned and his greatest nemesis was on top of him, pretending to care.
Harry spoke immediately. “Think harder, Draco. Unlike myself, we both know you’ve got a brain in there bouncing around with an answer.”
Yes, he was an Omega, and yes he knew he’d changed. War changes everybody. He quickly realized that all the shit he did and believed during his younger years was all fake and nothing he wanted to be apart of. However, he wasn't ready to tell anyone, let alone Harry Potter, about his new inheritance. That made him question though, just how did Harry know?
“Obviously this wasn’t the plan for my future, and I must admit that I haven’t been exactly cordial towards you today, but I’m willing… to give this a chance. More importantly you a chance, so don’t let me regret it. You haven’t exactly given me good reason too, no matter how oddly nice you’re being towards me. I don’t want to live the rest of my life with someone I don’t like.”
Draco stared at Harry with what looked like guilt and worry. He looked scared to even speak to the raven, so Harry started for him.
So until he found that type of love, Draco Malfoy continued to run his business with the superiority of a Malfoy, but with the kindness and love that took him so long to grow into.
“Nicknames. But yeah. As long as we’re together, no one gets to oggle you but me.” Potter grabbed his bum possessively.
Draco sighed. He grabbed Harry’s hand and held on to it for a minute. “Ok.” He finally agreed. “I’ll indulge in your little dates, you big sap.”
Harry shrugged. “He’s gonna take care of it. Also, there’s a Mungo's charity thing tomorrow if you wanna go.”
He once again decided to try reading a little bit before he shut his eyes, but, of course, that failed too. So he turned off his light, rolled over, shut his eyes and hoped for sleep to take him quickly.
But Harry didn't seem to get that, so he pulled back to look the bond in the eye. Tear tracks stained his porcelain skin. Harry's face changed to one of worry and he breathed an almost silent “Oh, Draco.” He reached up and wiped them away with his thumbs.
However, when Harry and Draco moved in together, the old estate seemed to change. The rooms were brighter, the air lighter, and the halls filled with sounds of laughter and joy almost all hours of the day.
Draco kept rolling his hips, trying to press closer to Harry with every move. Finally he went back to kissing the raven-haired beauty while he tried pulling down his pyjama bottoms and boxers in one go.
“It’s alright, Harry. I’m not upset. You would’ve come in me anyways had I not passed out. I am a little concerned about how you lost control. I just meant for a little bit of teasing but…” Draco looked away, ashamed that he let things escalate to what they did. It wasn’t a matter of consent, more about not getting his point across, and rather giving into their carnal desires.
“What?!” Harry exclaimed. Being given detention and 50 points taken away, he really didn’t think it fair that he must suffer a groping Malfoy for who-knows how long.
Draco chuckled. “Merlin Harry, yes! Go! Have fun tonight. I have some new books I ordered from Flourish and Blotts to get started on.”
“Figured out the cupboard, did ya? Names Jonathan.” He stuck his hand out for a shake. Draco eyed it before grasping it.
“I’m going to the washroom.” He stood abruptly, the hand falling from his lap. “Don’t follow me.” He whispered directly at his new husband. With that, he left the room and retreated back to the room he had first been lead to, where he got ready for this very unfortunate event. He sighed as he entered, locking the doors behind him and all but collapsing into the king-sized bed that lay in the middle of the room. He let the soft sheets and blankets surround him in a comforting manner, minorly relaxing his stresses. He didn’t intend to fall asleep, but as he closed his eyes and started drifting off, a soft knocking was heard at the door. He stayed silent, in hopes that whoever it was would leave. A familiar voice broke through.
Draco turned to stare at the oven as well before murmuring “I was just going to use magic.” He turned to look back at Harry.
When Draco sat down, his head fell forward, causing a piece of his immaculate blond hair to fall loosely in front of his face. He seemed to be in a daze of some sort; his gaze focused on the floor in front of him, his head hung low, and his lungs taking in deep long breaths.
Draco walked along the beach for a few hours, enjoying the sun and how it warmed his skin. He took in the breathtaking scenery around their little bungalow. He was thankful for the calm serenity found between every wave of the ocean, grains of sand, and the leaves of the tropical plants that bordered the beach.
Once she got to the bathroom after her trek alone, Hermione instantly noticed something was wrong. For one, the magic in the air was sharp and sparking, and two, Malfoy was passed out face down on the floor, covered in what looked like vomit.
Obviously there were feelings there that they both had, and it would be an insult to all the world’s greatest love stories, songs, poems, and gifts if they denied what they both felt for each other.
“Oh, Malfoy! I heard about your place and thought I’d stop in.” Potter greeted with a comfortable handshake. Hmm. Memorable.
This fic has had a title and rating change due to this chapter. It’s a little cringey and very sexual. I don’t even know, man.
“Harry…” he said in a deep whisper, voice rumbling from within his chest. It worked as Harry seemed to fall out of his stupor and refocus on the pale face in front of his. “There he is.” Draco said with a small smile. “Welcome back.”
Harry was happy where he was with Draco, and he didn't want to force him into anything by bringing it up. He knew the blond would come to him when he was ready, so he decided to wait until he did so.
“I did say that, didn’t I.” Harry began before Draco could continue. “I believe it would be best for us to start our jobs first though, and that could be another month from now.” Harry was just thinking out loud at this point.
He regarded her. She may seem toxic, but she’s his best friend. She would never do anything to purposefully hurt him. Well, at least she wouldn’t do anything she couldn’t reverse the damage of. “You wouldn’t. You know who works there.”
Hermione slightly cocked her head to one side and said “Harry also told me about your wand. It was very nice of him to return it to you.”
“No.” Draco said. “I’d rather converse with a baboon. Then I might actually have a civilized conversation, unlike with your neanderthal arse.” Draco said, still struggling to remove himself from Harry’s grasp.
Instead of apparating back to Grimmauld Place, Harry decided to walk there, taking time for himself, to walk through the park and enjoy the outdoors.
He couldn’t focus on his feelings correctly, still in shock and uncomfortable from the air that surrounded him, so he made his way to bathe the day away, drink a steaming cup of tea and go to sleep in order to prepare for work the next day.
Harry sighed and turned back to the front of the class. Malfoy climbed back onto his stool and kept his head down, twiddling with his fingers.
Harry watched as the man that supposedly loved him, broke down in tears. He recognized those tears as the same ones he had at their wedding, albeit because of the opposite reason.
Their laughter died down to a few chuckles then silence. Draco looked over to see Harry staring at him almost longingly. He slowly started moving closer to Draco, and Draco froze in place. Draco’s breath hitched in his throat as Harry’s chest pressed up against his own.
“I know, I wanted to- want to, but I’m ready now. I’m ready for us. I know I made it obvious I wasn’t ready to be totally intimate before, but I wasn’t ready to tell you that.” He took a moment to breathe. “I also wanted to see your reaction. I thought you weren’t into it at first, actually. You pulled away,” Draco frowned and Harry blushed red. “but now I know it’s because you care.” He said, smiling brightly. He nuzzled Harry’s neck, and curled up right around the Alpha’s side. His body hummed with contentment and relaxation, much different from the past few weeks.
Harry looked completely blank after Draco ended his rant. “That’s a question for Hermione.” he said.
Harry looked up at him, shocked. He didn't mean for him to take him seriously, even though he meant it.
As he felt the familiar pang of hurt return that was always brought on by his parents, a blond head appeared beside his telling him that the food was soon to arrive. Harry paid no attention to Draco, but this didn’t go unnoticed.
“I’m happy to see you too.” She chuckled. “Luna’s waiting for me, and Hermione and Ron have already taken their places.” Harry nodded, seeing as that was the only thing he could do at the moment. She looked down the aisle, pursing her lips together in a thoughtful manner, and turned back to him to kiss him on the cheek. “He’s not as bad as you think, you know.” She whispered in his ear. With one last hug and a you’ll be fine, she returned to her seat, leaving Harry alone once again.
Draco growled, lifted Harry up, and threw him down on the bed, just like Harry had said. Harry giggled as he spelled both their clothes off, too immersed in their activity to give a damn.
“Because we don’t want you to die! You know what will happen if you refuse to follow through with the prophecy. If marrying Malfoy is the only thing to keep you alive, then so be it! You didn’t deserve this, but you can't die.” Hermione fought back. Ron held her arm back, trying to get her to calm down, and to not role Harry up again, but she needed to get that out, and that seemed to be the only thing that actually got to him.
“Oh, just some homemade brownies. They’re my favourite.” Draco said. He looked up at Harry who was smiling at him in a dazed kind of way. “I hope that’s alright. I know I should’ve asked.”
Ron had to undo his Incarcerous for Harry to take over, which thankfully, Malfoy stayed in place for.
“Harry, stop. I don’t want to do this right now.” Draco said seriously. “I told you I don’t want this to be what our relationship is based on.”
But Harry didn’t feel the same, apparently. He just kept shooting him down whenever he wanted to talk or discuss serious matters.
He leaned over and kissed Harry quickly before looking at the clock on his nightstand. The red numbers shone ‘2:43 am’. He sighed and hauled himself out of bed before padding off to the bathroom.
Harry wanted to jump up and down he was so excited. But he didn't, he just ginned widely and turned back to Kingsley. The Minister nodded and had the aurors usher them out of the courtroom, passed Hermione and Ron in the hall, who shot confused glances at Harry, who just shrugged, and into his office a little ways down the hall.
“Draco, honey, could you bring me the letter that just flew in?” Harry asks, bent over his desk, likely reviewing some notes from Kingsley or one of his associates.
“Well, seeing as were already fucking married, and you’re already in love with me, you don’t need to get to know me. You probably already know everything about me, don’t you?” Harry crossed his arms haughtily and turned his chin up.
They were quiet for a few minutes before Harry spoke. “I know you don’t like being vulnerable with your emotions, but I need you to be one hundred percent, completely and utterly honest with me, if we’re going to do this. I have loved meeting the new Draco and falling for him the more I’m with him, but I need him to be completely open with me. Can he do that?”
"Umm, no, it's alright." Draco paused then continued with "But I think I should get back to bed. It's late."
He must’ve looked quite pitiful, standing there in a tieless suit, dressed sharply and handsome as ever, amongst the sweaty haired, tank-top clad mailing employees that watched him.
Draco broke through Harry’s train of thought. “We don’t have to. I’m sorry I asked.” He sounded broken, it hurt Harry’s heart.
After a long time of them holding onto each other, Harry slowly started to rub soothing circles all down Draco's back in hopes to calm him. It did, so he decided to break the silence. “Draco?”
“I am, assuming you’re talking about the colourist who owns a shop across the street.” Draco responded.
A little while later, as Harry was thinking about how to convince Draco, once again, that working would be a beneficial transition into adulthood, the door creaked open suddenly, snapping Harry out of his thoughts. A blonde head peeked in, and Harry could tell from the look in his eyes that he was calmer than he was before, if not a little sullen.
“What are your dreams?” Harry whispered into Draco’s hair. It was the next morning, and the two were lounging in bed, eating breakfast and enjoying their time together.
Draco looked up to see the huge grin plastered on Harry’s face. “I guess.” Then a thought occurred to him. “Imagine what my father would think.” He chuckled. Harry winced.
“Oh, precious…” Harry says, standing up and meeting Draco quickly at the door, taking his cloak and bag from his hands. “You look so tired.” Harry says lightly. “I’m done now, we’re going to go home. Wanna sit?” Harry asked, peering down at Draco.
Draco smiled, arching up into Harry’s touch. “Mm no more talk of him.” He leant down and suckled on Harry’s neck, making his way up to this ear; Harry continued groping Draco’s arse and rutting up into him. Draco licked the shell of Harry’s ear. “Take me to bed, darling.”
He raised an eyebrow and said “Yes, it was. And I thanked him for it.” She sat on the back of the couch, staring at him with an expression he couldn’t quite read. He wanted her to get to the point of her visit. Clearly it was important if Harry wasn’t accompanying her. “Granger, why are you here?” He asked in a tired voice.
Finally Potter had shut up and allowed Draco to absorb the information of the whole story. He started to feel bad about going off on him like that, but he stood by what he said. He chewed his lip and regarded the man opposite him for a moment. Draco couldn’t just give up Potter now knowing that he, technically, didn’t have control over himself that night.
Draco rolled over once more and shut his eyes, wondering when the next time they’d sleep together in the same bed would be.
Dumbledore looked thoughtful for a moment. “She told you a prophecy.” He didn’t phrase it as a question.
“I hardly think a sneeze should cause such a reaction.” Draco said irritably before succumbing to the pleasant hold around him.
He looked beside himself and saw that the blond was still sleeping, so he decided to go shower. He might as well use the alone time now that he had it.
“Malfoy,” Harry tried. The blond stopped attacking his neck, grabbed his face with both hands and turned Harry to face him.
When Harry was done, Draco nodded gently and left him as he went inside. He saw his breakfast still there, but when he went to cast a quick warming charm, he saw small streams of steam rising from it. He was sure it wouldn’t have stayed steaming with warmth for that long, no matter how hot the climate was. He cast a quick diagnostic charm and saw that a stasis was put on it.
Harry's day just keeps getting better and better. "Yes, please, take it." He said before starting his way down the stairs. "I'm going to go get started on dinner. Any requests?" He asked peering up at the blond.
Ron's jaw dropped and Hermione just stared blankly back at him. Eventually she said "Oh...well then. I can't say I was expecting that..." she replied, nudging Ron's side before his mouth snapped shut.
“Draco,” His eyes widened at the use of his first name. “I know this is a sensitive topic with you, but we’re worried about you. I’d like to talk with you, please.”
“Harry.” Ron whined. “What do I do?” He was no longer sick, so Harry vanished the contents from the bucket.
Harry turned to him. “You think? It’s this damn prophecy. It’s making me sick, I feel like absolute shit. That damn seizure wasn’t fake, it was fucking terrifying! I am so done with the constant feeling of my heart ripping out of my chest whenever I’m not in the same room as you. I don’t know why I feel all these things, or I’m the one that keeps getting hurt by this, but I’m fed up with it.”
But Harry never promised those words back. He didn’t because he knew it would be a lie. Draco never had anyone stick with him through tough times in his life, minus his parents, but even they weren’t here to help him with this. Draco felt his heart break more than it already had, because he no one helped him put it back together and he didn’t know how to do it himself. He was crumbling and there was no one to help save him. He questioned, not for the first time, if there ever would be someone.
“Ugh, not a chance. That place needs some serious redecorating. I was thinking something along the coast, or not far from the Malfoy land reserves. We can have a garden and a pool. We can watch the sun set from our balcony, or sleep under the stars on a hammock... “ Draco thought aloud. It was nice to hear his thoughts of their future, and how they might live one day.
Timeless moments passed as Draco continued to tease Harry. Draco was enjoying himself immensely. Harry, however, was becoming more agitated that Draco would not let up his actions and make love to him already. He groaned in frustration, eventually, forcing a foot to Draco’s chest and pushing him away.
It was open. He gingerly stepped in and peered around inside. He fumbled for his wand and casted a quick Lumos before finding a switch, similar to the one in the bathroom and flicked it. The room suddenly filled with light and he put his wand away. The room was a decent size and bookshelves filled with books and trinkets lined every wall. A sofa and a few arm chairs sat in a circle in front of the only window in the room. A desk and chair sat against a part of a wall not covered by a large bookshelf. A small framed photo of 4 boys around their age, hung above it. All the furniture was covered in sheets, indicating that this room wasn't used and hadn't been used in a while, if the fine layer of dust was anything to go by.
“Oh, Miss, I would like to know if you’re aware of any new updates with Harry Potter?” he asked politely.
Harry's eyes snapped to the frail blond that stepped through a side door where he was lead by two aurors to the seat that stood in the middle of the room.
“Oh, so I'm back to ‘Potter’, am I?” Harry asked lightly. Draco had stopped calling Harry ‘Potter’ every time he addressed him after their third date, but let it slip every once in a while when he was upset, especially at the raven-haired boy.
Now, seeing Potter here in his beloved shop, had set off an onslaught of emotions and feelings resurfacing, not for the first or last time.
When Draco came down to the kitchen, he found Harry at the stove and the table set. On it were plates, utensils and tea, but devoid of any food. “What’re you making?”
Draco stood up immediately, Hermione and Ron right behind him. “Where is he? I need to see him.” Draco says, already making his way past her.
He needed to write down the uses of Flobberworm skin and Scarab Beetle scales and what type of reaction they make when combined; whether combustion, with fire, or gaseous, with smoke. He’d once read somewhere once that when Scarab Beetles were mixed with another ingredient, he could make homemade stink bombs. Now whether that was Flobberworms or stink bugs, he wasn’t sure. Because on one hand, stink bugs were notorious for their stench, but Flobberworms, on the other, were so putrid-
“So, you actually love me?” Draco asked, berating himself for showing such weakness in front of their healer.
“You like him.” Hermione said, putting the water to boil on the stove. Harry went to say something but she stopped him with a hand in the air. “Now, I know what you’re going to say, you’re going to try to deny it, but I know you better than that. Everytime you’ve Floo called me this week was to talk about Draco. Plus, I see the way you look at him. Even at his trial. I know he’s an Omega, Harry, but do you really want to get yourself caught up in all of that?”
“Only you would consider being an owl a fun job, Harry.” Draco mumbled. Harry pinched his side lightly, which Draco was able to fake as a shift in his body weight, the smile never leaving Harry’s face.
“Are you going to touch me, Harry?” Draco asked once again, after watching Harry lick his lips and palm his crotch.
Harry looked at Draco, calculating. “Draco….” Draco just looked at him expectantly. “Draco, I- are you sure?” He asked seriously. Oh man, things were moving fast.
The first one. Followed by another and another. Soon, hands were shooting up all over the place. Harry's brain again screamed 'that's a lot of hands!' in a much more excited manner. He couldn't tell if it was more than before, but it had to be close, it had to be.
Harry smiled at the use of his last name, and shrugged again. “It didn’t feel right with her. It’s only ever felt right with one person.”
"I can come over tomorrow and chat with him for a bit after work. I think we should give him some time though. Didn't you say he's using the library now? He might be finding something in there.”
Draco woke with a start. He yawned and searched for his wand to cast another Tempus. 11:50. After adjusting to his surroundings and remembering where he was, he felt too awake to fall back asleep. He groaned and sat up. He then remembered the library and wondered if the elf was done. Probably, he scolded himself. He's a sodding house-elf for Merlins sake. He cleans for a living.
“Mrs Walkins has heard of your case and would like to discuss all the possible explanations as to why this has occurred.” Marigold spoke again.
“Let’s get dressed, yeah?” Harry quickly turned the shower off and donned a big fluffy towel, passing one to Malfoy as well.
They left, and Harry dragged Malfoy all the way back to Gryffindor tower. Once there, he had the help of Neville, Seamus, Ron and Dean to pull the screaming, kicking blond off of Harry.
Although they had briefly mentioned sex between them, it hadn’t been brought up again. The week had been extremely busy, and Draco had come down with a nasty fever the day after Harry met with the Minister. They both skipped the ball for St. Mungo’s, Draco being too sick and Harry insisting on staying home to take care of him. Draco felt bad, but Harry promised many more galas and balls in their future.
After regaining some control, Draco stood up straight and smoothed down his shirt. “I’m fine.” His voice was hoarse and Harry stared at him incredulously.
“It will be ok, Ms Granger. You did a very good job coming to find him. I will be awarding you, but we should make our way up to the hospital wing, don’t you think?” She asked, then cast a patronus, alerting Professor Snape about his house member and godson.
“I like you begging,” Malfoy said, biting his lip in a seductive way. “You got the devour part right. I’d love to just swallow down your-”
Draco and Harry exchanged looks. “Ok, I’m really interested to know what you found out, but,” he turned to Draco, “you told her what we were doing?” he pinned Draco with an accusatory look.
Kingsley sighed before addressing the blond. "Well, Mr. Malfoy," he looked up at the sound of his name. "after reviewing your case and the claims made against you, the majority of the Wizengamont Council has voted that you are found," he paused for dramatic effect, "not guilty."
“Oh Merlin.” Harry groaned. “What-err, what did you, um see?” he kept shuffling around as he asked the blond. He was extremely embarrassed and mad at himself for being so stupid and careless.
“Yes, I believe we are. Draco, Abraham shall be with you shortly to take you on a tour of the facility. I trust everything will be fine.” The Minister said. Draco nodded mutely, slightly terrified that Harry was leaving him to explore the Ministry of Magic with a total stranger, which he’d never met before.
‘Draco’s Hair Studio’ was a hit to all: young, old, muggle, wizard (discreetly, of course), and the financially unavailable.
A lace bralette covered his flat chest and small nipples, which would undoubtedly fill once he fell pregnant, leaking milk from his swollen teats. A matching pair of lace panties barely covered his semi-hard cock, which strained delightfully against the form-fitting fabric. And to top it all off, a garter belt that hugged his thigh deliciously, bringing together the sexy and undeniably irresistible outfit.
“No, don’t get me wrong. I like it, I do, I just never had a break from evil, power hungry wizards who want to rule the wizarding world. I feel like I never had the chance to find out what I was good at that I loved to do.”
Harry pulled back and when Draco tried to kiss him again, he just turned his head away. Draco settled for attacking his neck instead.
Draco emerged from their bedroom, ready to join Harry and his friends downstairs, when he walked past the bathroom door, slightly ajar. He assumed he’d left the light on by accident, so he went to shut it off, but found Hermione curled in front of the toilet.
After they ate breakfast, Draco wanted to finally test the water as he hadn’t yet gone swimming since they’d arrived.
“Well, that was quite lovely.” Draco said when he and Harry returned to Grimmauld a few hours later.
When he was done flipping through his many poetry books, he finally looked over to the few magical creature ones he brought out and winced. It's not that he didn't want to learn about it all, it’s just that then he’d finally have to accept his fate.
Harry kissed up Draco’s thighs softly and gently, making his way towards the delicious looking prick. Man, it was huge. He licked up the shaft slowly until he reached the head, at which point he engulfed as much as he could into his mouth.
Draco paused and looked deeply into the green eyes. “You have. In ways you’ll never know.” He whispered.
The trio didn’t speak again until Harry was once again dressed in his expensive suit, hair combed and fixed, and breathing deeply to Ron’s administrations.
“Keep doing that and I'll have bruises for days, Potter.” Draco whispered to Harry as the Minister approached them.
They kissed more, and more, and more, until they passed out, lying beside each other into the late hours of the morning.
Draco nodded. “I do. I told you Harry, I’m ready.” He smiled up at the brunet through hooded lashes.
Harry vanished his underwear (not keen on doing that with the rest of his clothes before; he liked his wardrobe, thank you very much. He wasn’t about to waste his clothes, although, one pair of pants couldn’t hurt). Before he could do anything more though, a hand pressed into his chest to stop him.
"Harry, you yelled at the Wizengamont?! What were you thinking?! I knew I shouldn't have let you do that alone. You could've gotten yourself in so much trouble!" Hermione scolded.
It started to convulse rapidly, almost as if he was hyperventilating and vomiting all at once. His eyes rolled back and he went limp as Draco reached around and held onto him. It was with shocking realization that Draco realized Harry was having a seizure.
He went to flip to another page when he heard the door creak behind him. It startled him so much he dropped the book and quickly spun around-
“Keep up your attitude and I’ll leave you in the hallway.” Harry threatened, remembering how much Malfoy did not want to be left alone out there.
“I thought you were going to let me pick.” Draco said from against Harry’s neck. He’d latched on as soon as Harry joined him in the couch, kissing and licking gently against the Boy Who Lived’s neck, leaving wet trails in his wake. Harry let him, loving the domestic feeling they created around them.
“Diana, can you take the next customer? I’ve got a thing to take care of.” Draco called from across the open shop, emphasising ‘thing’.
But Draco wasn’t making the most of this situation, no, he made it worse. He makes everything worse.
“Yes. Bloody great invention it was too. It ends up in each person's mailbox on their floor.” Jonathan said.
“Are you going to undress me, Harry?” Draco asked, referring to his trousers and pants that were still on him.
With the professionalism he’d perfected since owning his shop, he walked up to the Savior and greeted him.
As Harry stepped out onto the aisle for the second time that morning, himself once again presentable and the reddened eyes and cheeks missing, he cleared his mind of all things, the wedding, the people, the blond. All that remained was the will to think of ten things that made him happy. Just ten, and as he made his way toward the altar, his worry and panic subsided greatly.
Draco was astounded. He was not expecting Harry to go on a full rant about why he was so emotionally unavailable. But now he knew why. And now he knew that Harry was going to try to open up.
“Hmm, we could even have a Quidditch pitch built on a reserve. A small one of course, but one that we could practice on, and that I could kick your butt on.” Draco giggled.
As Draco apparated to the front door of 12 Grimmauld Place, another sneeze escaped him. He had sneezed at least five times while he was at work at Gringotts. Being the bank’s newly appointed manager gave him a few extra privileges than regular employees. One being that he could leave whenever he wanted too. After another sneezing fit that lasted 3 sneezes, he decided to call it a day.
Draco just held his gaze on their connected hands and willed himself not to shudder against the contact. Harry felt so powerful, so big and tough in Draco's tiny grasp. Eventually the silence carried on for a long time before I broke Draco's gaze and he asked "Why don't you use it?" He asked quietly, still not able to look in Harry's eyes.
Harry stared back at her in shock. "Wha- it's not like I'm going to attack him or something!? Quite the opposite actually." Ron grimaced while Hermione rolled her eyes.
Walkins thought for a moment. "It's very possible that the prophecy's magic needed time to strengthen and become accustomed to both of your magical signatures. If the arguments or temporary separations occurred in the first week or two of the bonding, it is very likely the magic hadn't become used to the situation and both of your signatures."
Harry glared at him. “That’s my family that you’re dragging me away from. So yeah. I’m going to take my bloody time saying goodbye to them, you arse.”
The Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt, sat high in his chair, towering over the jury and audience in the courtroom, which consisted of the Wizengamont and a single raven-haired saviour. Harry's best friends, Ron and Hermione, waited outside the courtroom, seeing as this was one of the many private trials that took place. "Well, my dear colleagues and friends, we come to a close for the day with the trial for one 'Draconius Lucius Malfoy'." As Kingsley read off the blonds crimes, Harry watched as he didn't visibly tremble or shake, but sat there silently, accepting whatever fate was coming his way.
Draco ran to the bed and started shaking the boy “Harry! Harry, wake up! Harry! Oh dear Merlin...Harry!” When the screaming stopped and he saw the boys eyes flutter open, he dropped on the edge of the bed, clutching over his heart with his hand. “Merlin, Harry. What the bloody hell was that for?” He asked, looking down at the raven-haired boy, worriedly.
“That won’t be necessary, Ms Granger,” Snape said roughly, before billowing out of the room, and towards what Hermione could only guess was their common room. McGonagall followed suit. Hermione sent a patronus anyways, alerting Harry that an angry Snape was on his way.
Draco regarded Harry, wondering if he was actually serious. “Date night?” Draco questioned, and Harry nodded.
Draco looked up and saw a Harry's worried expression. “Oh, no. I - I want to be with you, there's no doubt about that. It's just, I'd like a label for this. Not just mates, you know, if that makes sense.”
That thought got Harry up. He threw the covers off of himself as if they burned his skin and left the massive bedroom. When he entered the sitting room, he cast a lumos and saw Malfoy lying on the floor, still fully awake, just like himself.
Harry cleared his throat as he tried to remember how to form words, "Well, Minister Shacklebolt, I've known Draco Malfoy for 8 years, and although we've had our differences, and he's made a few mistakes in his past, I can assure you that he isn't a ruthless Death Eater that many accuse him of being. And he certainly doesn't deserve to be thrown in Azkaban." Honestly, no matter how hard he tried, Harry could not figure out where that statement came from, or the great effect it had on the jury.
They made their way into the bathroom, Malfoy’s arms staying put around Harry. He sat the blond down on the small bench that sat across from the shower, muttered a ‘stay out,’ hopped into the shower, shut the curtain, took off his robe, and turned the water on.
“Hey mate.” He said, walking straight over to Harry to give him a big hug. They stuck together like glue, those two, whispering in each other’s ears and giggling like school girls. Draco was a little jealous, not that he’d ever say that, though.
Draco growled angrily at him before saying “I am not sick, and it's the stupid comforter that's making me sneeze.”
“Oh, please! You think I’m some damsel in distress?” he clicks his tongue. “You asked me out, remember? Call me when you get over yourself.”
Draco shook his head. “No, I don’t actually. Why I believe so is because I had feelings for Harry even before the prophecy presented itself. Harry did not, and was unaware of mine at the time. I know he has feelings for me now, but we’re still in the early stages of dealing with all of this, that I think he just gets them mixed up sometimes. As well, he is the bold-headed Gryffindor, so he is more likely to go outside of the rules and ‘jostle’ the prophecy’s magic more than I am, so to speak.”
As the reception commenced, with family and friends gathered together, one would consider this a joyous occasion. Harry and his two best friends however, did not. Draco was off greeting and thanking everyone for coming to their -forced- wedding.
They sat in the sitting room for the majority of the day, because the sky had clouded over and rain began to fall. They read, completed puzzles, and played chess. Harry tried to make out with Draco multiple times, who just kept pushing him away.
Draco nodded in agreement. He remembered some fond memories he had with his Godfather, especially when he was really young, although no one could disagree that he wasn’t a rotten shell of a man at the end of it all. He protected draco, which he loves him for, but he was a wicked and selfish man at the same time.
“A normal person doesn't act that way, Potter, even if they are slightly intoxicated. You have to truly have bad intentions when sober to act the way you do when you’re drunk. Drunk behaviour is based on sober intentions. Regardless, the way you handled me that night was not appreciated in the slightest. If you’re here to make up for it, I’m sorry to say but you can’t. I have better things to take up my time than your intemperate behaviours. Goodbye now, Potter. I hope you get help.”  Draco says as he makes his exit back into his shop, however he’s stopped short when Potter speaks up.
Their month long honeymoon had sadly come to an end, but it was a time that neither of them would ever forget.
He retreated to his study like always, and began to prepare for his interview with The Daily Prophet. Draco had reminded him that he’d have to leave his world of comfort that he’d built inside the walls of 12 Grimmauld Place, after not having left in more than a week, to explain to the press and the whole Wizarding World that he was doing fine and not much has changed since he’d left Hogwarts.
A few moments later, Harry pulled away because he was seriously running out of oxygen, but when he looked into the grey abyss, he only saw remorse.
He pulled Harry’s cock to the rhythm of his thrusts, albeit uneven due to his mind’s state, although it did the trick. Harry was coming hard after a few good thrusts near the end, right before Draco filled Harry up.
It was quite for another few minutes, the two of them holding each other peacefully, just enjoying being in each other’s presence.
“Oh bugger off, you three. This isn’t my field of work. We can go ask Healer Walkins tomorrow. I’m sure she would know.”
“We best be going then, Harry,” Hermione said in a high-pitched voice. She grabbed his hand and pulled him through the portrait hole and all the way down to the great hall.
Harry didn’t say anything for a minute and Draco watched a blush creep up his neck. “It’s nothing.” He murmured, but Draco was having none of it. He turned to look at Harry.
“Why don’t you use magic anymore?” The question broke Draco’s concentration and he shot up to look at Harry.
"Well of course not, but it wouldn't be good if you go back in and loose control and start ravishing him either! Also your magic, you know how it gets riled up." She drifted off to just above a whisper when speaking about Harry's magic, in case there were any eavesdroppers nearby.
The Omega hadn’t spoke yet and Harry peered kindly into his eyes. He seemed deeply lost in thought, worrying his bottom lip desperately. So Harry gently grabbed Draco’s face and kissed him. They kissed and kissed and Harry poured his whole soul into it.
Draco let out another sneeze, much like the first, which caused a few muffled snickers from the boy behind him.
Draco picked the envelope up again and flipped it over one more time. It was thin, maybe containing a single piece of parchment. The front stated it was to one ‘Stacy Martins, Department of Magical Creatures, 6th Station”. He ran his wand over it, muttering a simple Revelio, which deemed it harmless. He had no idea what to do next. He silently watched the other workers who picked one up, muttered a few incantations, stated clearly to where the envelope was from through the pipe that hung in front of their stations, and sent the envelope through. It glowed green for a second and the envelope was gone.
He kissed all down the tanned skin, licking around the tight nipples and biting lovingly into the soft hips beneath him. Harry exchanged his soft chuckles for moaning Draco’s name repetitively.
Suddenly steel met forest and Harry's world felt like it was going to crash down right there. His stare was so intense that it pierced through Harry like a sword.
“Right. Well, this is wonderful." Harry said, scooping himself a large helping. He poured a cup of tea that was already made and sat down across from Draco. "So, what's new?" Harry asked before shoving a forkful of eggs into his mouth.
"Well, I guess that explains some of our initial... randiness in the beginning, during our honeymoon... but, we had a few fights, and I'd left temporarily a few times to go for a walk and Harry for a swim. How come we didn't feel pain then, when we were separated?" Draco inquired.
Snape sighed heavily at this point, almost put off by what he was going to say next. “...talented wizard you are, leaves me to believe you had some say in why. Why the curse had altered it’s path of choice, that of which it was created to do. That’s for one thing. The next, you didn’t seem aggressively against the thought of having to watch over Mr Malfoy, as well as move into his private rooms with him, and share all classes with. Also,” Snape seemed to get heated more and more as he continued to talk.
Draco squeezed his hand before removing it from his cheek but still held onto it. He interlaced their fingers and took in a shaky deep breath. “Ok.” He looked back to Harry. “But, I think it's you.”
“Care to explain why you tried to kill my godson?” In all of the years Harry has known Snape, he has never heard him refer to Malfoy as his godson. It was a common known fact that he was, but under all of Snape’s angry professionalism, he never revealed something as personal as family relations. Harry knew he was in trouble.
“Harry?” His name rolled off of Draco’s tongue not unlike a foreign language. It was weird to hear it come from the blond.
“Yes, professor.” Harry said solemnly. He turned to go back to the hospital wing to get Malfoy, when McGonagall stopped him.
The room(s) were decorated in dark green and black furniture, much like the Slytherin common room, from what Harry could remember from 2nd year. Lavish pieces and expensive trinkets littered every surface, but not making it look cluttered. The furniture looked rich and soft, probably made from the best materials that existed.
Draco sighed happily. Maybe he didn't need to always be strong, maybe it was ok to be sick. And babied. He didn't mind Harry's immediate reaction to caring for him. In fact, he liked how much Harry cared about him and his health, even if it was just a stupid cold. And maybe Malfoys don't get sick, but Dracos do.
“So then I just left. I wasn’t- am not in the mood, to deal with him and his weird arse emotions anymore. He’s so unstable. I swear, any moment he can’t see me or I’m not in the same room as him, he goes insane.”
“Thanks so much, Kinsgley. I was hoping you had any job positions available for Draco and I. I was going to ask your receptionist, but I’m requesting that we be placed together or in close proximity. I’d like to be able to see or speak to him regularly throughout the day. I wasn’t sure if your receptionist could work that out for us.” Harry fidgeted with his seat, hands and shirt hem the whole time he spoke. He didn’t know if it was wise to interrupt Kingsley’s day to ask for a job, but he needed this.
“Gentleman, ma’am, might I introduce Mrs Arri Walkins, Second to Head of the Spell-Damage Ward here at the hospital.”
“The only one I want to make uncomfortable is my Harry.” He said, full on groping Harry through his pants.
Draco stares for a moment, processing the information he was just given. He shakes his head quickly and shortly. “No, I don't. I need to see him. NOW.” He says, breaking through her arm the second time, and making his way at a quick walk, peeking into every room he passed, looking for his husband. At the end of the hall and to the right, he sees Harry through a wide open window, laying in a bed, assumedly sleeping. A glowing yellow orb floated above him, thin blue strings of magic interlaced gently within it. He enters the room timidly, watching the gentle rise and fall of his chest. The witch, Hermione and Ron have followed behind him.
“I-I didn’t mean to.” Between the storming professors and the Snape-Malfoy situation, he never even thought of the blond. Did he actually kill him? What did that spell DO?
“Don’t walk away from me! I don’t know what your problem is, but you’re being unfair.” He paused and released a breath. “I thought we were having a nice time in there.” He said less viciously.
“Ok, how about we meet up at John’s when you’re finished. You play pool, don’t you?” Harry asked as Draco vigorously towel dried his dripping hair.
“We were planning my best escape route. Sorry, Harry.” he said with a grin. It was quickly wiped off his face as he felt a sharp pain jab into his left lung, causing him to clutch his side and lose his balance. Harry was beside him in an instant, holding him up.
As a new day started, the sun peeked through the drapes and the birds chanted loudly outside the window. Hushed whispers and shy kisses were shared between tangled limbs and warm sheets. Although they were quite close now, they hadn't gone further than a few makeout sessions aside from their sweet kisses and small touches with each other.
“You are impossible.” Harry laughed, wrapping an arm around his husband. “Hermione’s pregnant, apparently. Ron just came to tell us, but it looks like he panicked.”
“You don’t like being an Auror?” Draco asked, genuinely shocked that Potter was trying to prove that Draco had the better career choice than him.
“Um, Draco, there’s a man asking for you.” Chick, one of Draco’s apprentices, came into the back room to alert him. Draco liked Chick, he was even gayer than Draco.
“You think I would have let him fuck me again if that’s all I was to him?” Draco asked her back, picking apart his croissant that she brought him.
“Oh no? Tell me again why you’re here.” Harry said, continuing to stroke Draco’s hair and cheek, turning to look at him in the eye.
Harry lay curled around his Omega, licking and soothing his shivering body. He pulled the blankets from their bed over themselves, covering their naked bodies for some added warmth.
Harry rolled his eyes and replied "Look, I promise I won't freak out again. I got it out of my system." Hermione just raised an eyebrow.
Draco gasped and bit his lip, feeling a stream of tears form. He sniffed and smiled so brightly, Harry squeezed him closer to himself.
They both avoided each other for the rest of the night. Neither of them went to make dinner or try to seek out the other, so when they both went to bed the last words they spoke to each other still lingered in the kitchen.
She eyed him with pity, something he hated that she did quite often. “Was Draco doing something? You guys seemed ok in there. What happened?”
i am beyond sorry for those waiting for this chapter. i am really hoping to update again. thanks for sticking around for this story!!!! all of your support is so greatly appreciated :)
So, Draco tried a different approach. He ripped the pages off of Harry's lap, straddled him and kissing him furiously before Harry could even make out a squeak.
“Madame Pearings, I would be delighted if you stayed to assist me in this meeting.” Walkins said. Pearings nodded, but stood by the door with her hands linked in front of her. She nodded towards the woman.
“Merlin, Harry,” Draco said as he rubbed his eyes, a few more tears spilling out. “That was incredible.”
He pinched the bridge of his nose, thinking of what to do. Well, to be honest, there was only one thing to do if he didn’t want Malfoy making sexual advances for the rest of the day.
“Let me finish and you’ll know.” Harry smirked. Draco sighed. “Yes, but, I want to love you… completely.” Harry finished.
“I’m being an inconsiderate bastard, and only thinking about myself. You want a normal relationship, and I’m making that practically impossible.”
“Well, yeah. I tried to, but the bugger held on tight. It took me a couple tries, but I’m here now.” Harry answered. He was still shaken up, unsure if Malfoy was pulling a prank, or Harry really messed him up.
"Are you alright?" Harry asked. The blonde looked at him confused, allowing Harry to elaborate. "You seem sad."
Once inside, he turned on the light and caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. He was paler than usual with blood red cheeks. His blond hair stuck to his forehead in a sweaty mess, and his shirt clung to him in a similar way. He closed his eyes and sighed before stripping and turning the shower on cold. He stepped under the steady stream and shivered under the intense temperature change.
"'Mione, its fine. Kingsley requested I step out for a minute to calm down, I guess." Harry replied, answering the unasked question.
“It is a fair punishment. You should not be dueling outside of class, no matter the situation. Especially unprovoked.” McGonagall stated from behind her desk.
While Harry was fighting with himself internally, Draco asked “You can't, what?” He looked scared. Harry couldn't have that.
“Of course. They should know I wouldn’t go anywhere without you.” Harry beckoned the blond over to him. He straddled Harry’s lap, running his slim hands through the rat’s nets of hair.
Harry tried for a smile, if anything to make the blond more comfortable. “Can you follow me to the study?” He asked, standing up. He always felt more comfortable in his warm study, especially if discussing serious matters. He was weird like that.
Harry stared up at the Minister as he spoke, not daring to look at Draco, in fear of the expression that covered his face.
Harry smiled, set the quill down and rested his elbows on the desk. “Well, because I’m an Alpha.” Draco's eyebrows disappeared into his hairline and started gaping like a fish. Not words came out, so Harry continued “Do you know how that works?”
Once his body stopped, a few minutes later, Draco grabbed his wand and immediately sent a patronus to St. Mungos to hopefully get an emergency team to help transport Harry to the hospital. He gently laid the rest of Harry down on the bed, slipped on a pair of underpants, put a pair on Harry too, and by that time four medi-wizards were bounding up the stairs to where Draco was calling to them.
Harry was walking to the Gryffindor common room after transfiguration, planning to spend his spare period there before lunch. Hermione said she had to talk to McGonagall about the essay they were given and what the particular outline was for it, and ways she could go above and beyond (its Hermione, what would you expect?), and Ron had stayed with her. They promised to meet him there when they were done. So, as he was strolling along the empty corridors (the next period had already started) to their nearby common room, he passed by Proffessor Trelawney, which was odd, seeing as he rarely ever saw her outside her classroom and maybe the great hall for meals, especially since it was during a period. Still, he nodded politely at the batty woman. She had a flash of a weird look pass across her features before she stopped and turned to him. Recognizing this as a sign that someone wants to talk to him, Harry stopped and turned to her with a question on his tongue. But before he could speak, a raspy, echoing voice sounded the halls that wasn’t anything like her regular airy voice.
This story took a turn I was not expecting. It is 2 am. I'm letting my sensitive and excited imagination run wild.
He would’ve owled his mother, asking his many unanswered questions, but she didn’t know much about her family’s breeding and genes. He’d have to figure this out on his own, something he really didn’t want to do. It’s not like he’d go to Harry anytime soon. What would he do for him?
Draco shrugged, putting his drink down and grabbing a cue off the wall behind him. He rubbed chalk on the cue, set up the table, and began playing, all while Harry watched from the bar a few feet away.
Just the fact that it’s Potter, his mind supplied. He agreed. If it was anyone else, he would’ve hexed them to Azkaban and back, to then banish them to the Forbidden Forest for Aragog’s children to feast upon their monstrous being.
“Wow, so you two really are limited with this whole prophecy thing.” Ron said after they’d finished.
Hermione continued to insist on being told what had just happened, but as Ron helped get Harry ready again, and Harry practically sat slumped in the chair, Hermione was at a loss and began helping as well.
“Perfect. I’m not one for arguing so much as getting my way in things. If we fight, we will resolve our differences and make up. Also, neither of us could stand being in much pain, so I don’t think we’d fight for very long before giving in and figuring out a solution to the problem. Neither of us would kill the other, as we would both die, so that’s not a worry. I think that’s settled. Neither of us will purposefully cause the other pain without a legitimate reason as to why.” he reached across the table and thumbed at Harry’s lip. “There really is nothing for you to worry about, dear. We have to be more careful, yes, but we will come out stronger in the end for it.” Draco finished.
“If there are any issues to be resolved in the future pertaining to your state of work, we will discuss alternate plans. Until then, you will go to work and you will try your best to expand your line of interests and talents, and obtain any other positive effects that working pays to you.” Draco nodded sullenly, giving in to his Alpha. “Good.” Harry sat back down. They ate their dinner in silence.
The sheer nerve of Potter had left Draco pacing his living room in a fury, wondering how Potter had become the way he was, all cocky and brash. What happened to him? Because that was not the Potter Draco had remembered from Hogwarts; and why had Draco thought it was absurdly attractive, but still greatly off-putting?
“I mean, we've been quite civil with each other, I’d even say friendly. I'd like to get to know you Draco.” Harry said with a smile.
Draco's breathing picked up before he ran a hand through his still damp hair. "It's hard to explain..." he saw the worried expression on Harry's face and backed away slightly.
Harry shrugged. “Yeah, it’s definitely different. We only just talked this morning. That’s when we decided to try us out, you know? And about what you said earlier, about me liking him, you’re right. I do. I really like him. He’s changed so much. He has this light about him now… I don’t know, ‘Mione. I just - I’m glad that we’re growing close.”
Harry's other hand came up and brushed some of the platinum locks back and away from his face. “Draco?” He repeated.
Harry turned to him and smiled. It calmed him somewhat. “This won’t take long, and neither should yours. If you need me, tap on this coin with your wand and we’ll come find you.” Harry said, handing Draco a large gold galleon.
Well, there goes that hope. He dressed as far away and as quickly as he could manage, from the blond. Malfoy’s eyes never left him, even as he pulled on his own uniform. Once he was done, he climbed over towards Harry, clinging onto his back and shoulders like his life depended on it.
Draco hummed. He leaned his head against Harry’s and closed his eyes. “A place for only our family.” He said. He was exhausted from the day’s events of packing and travelling, he wasn’t paying complete attention to what he was saying.
“I don't think so. I think you're coming down with something.” He immediately placed the back of his hand to Draco's forehead, before it was slapped away.
“Not with this prophecy on us, you won’t.” Harry pinched his side lightly, the same side Draco had experienced pain in his lung.
“Yes, professors?” He asked, no tone to his voice. He really didn’t want to make the situation worse by being snide.
“You didn’t kill him, Potter.” McGonagall sent furrowed brows in Snape’s direction. “He is under magical-medical care though, under close supervision. That spell was-”
Hermione and Ron looked at each other with quizzical looks, not expecting Harry and him to be so affectionate with each other. The last time they saw each other, the “happy” couple was going to rip each other’s heads off. Well, Harry wanted to, at least.
He went to pull away from Harry to leave, but Harry wouldn’t have that. He gripped his Omega and pulled him into an embrace.
“I know, Harry, I just want to make sure you’re ok. I know this is really hard for you, I can’t imagine it would be anything but. I love you Harry, and I’ll always be here for you.”
When he finally pulled himself out of bed he immediately blocked out the Omega's scent, if only to keep his own head screwed on straight. Handy little thing, that was.
“Do you not know I’m a hairstylist?” Weasley shook his head. “Nevermind that. I need to speak with Potter.”
“Don’t disagree that that man didn’t need to shower more than he did, the greasy roach that he was.” Draco said, playing with his nails.
When he pulled back to look at draco, his face was streaked with tears and his cheeks red and blotchy.
He had a great support system, mainly consisting of Pansy and his mother. But they weren’t someone he could go home to. They weren’t someone he could cuddle up to after a hard day. They weren’t someone that would stroke his ever changing hair and tell him everything would work out. They weren’t someone that would kiss him and hold him and mutter sweet nothings as they made love to him.
Let me know if you want to see more stuff like this, less sexual or more. This is my first time writing smut sooooooo. I don’t know what the next chapter is going to be, but I love getting suggestions and requests :)
Harry pulled his face out of his hands. “Keep your hands to yourself, Malfoy, and I’ll treat you later.” Harry said, knowing he was going to pay for that later. Better later with Malfoy, than with Snape and his pure hatred towards Harry.
He nodded, not really having a choice. “Ok, I promise. But you should tell Ron soon. I can’t imagine he’d be too happy to find out you’ve been keeping this from him. Oh, god. It is his, right?” surely Hermione wouldn’t…
“Me too. I’m excited to have a place where we can call our own, a place with only our memories in it.”
Draco scoffed. “Of course, I’m not a neanderthal.” Harry just rolled his eyes. “You know, I’m almost done. If you wait, we can actually go out instead of bringing food here.”
He knew he was interested in guys at a younger age, especially around 4th year when Cedric had become a Triwizard champion. There was no other reason as to why Draco chose to support him, other than that he was totally head over heels for the hufflepuff boy. And truth be told, he was heartbroken when he found out that Cedric was in love with the Chang girl.
Life isn’t fair though, and sometimes dreams can become a nightmarish realty. For Draco, that was exactly what he was feeling in this moment.
"Well, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy certainly can't just be dismissed because of a few mistakes." One of the Wizengamont jurists said.
The man nodded. “Yeah, my sister got her hair done there, it looks great. She was raving about how awesome her experience was.” The man said.
“Oh poor baby.” Harry soothed, kissing Draco’s cheek. He reached down and stroked Draco’s cock, feeling the half hard flesh thicken to full hardness.
He nodded towards the kitchen. “Yeah. Would you like a cuppa? We can talk in there.” He turned back to Draco. “Come on.”
“Aren’t you, though?” Harry asked with a patronizing tilt of his head. Draco just turned back to face his book. “As I was saying, I know you’re upset about our earlier confrontation, but I just wanted to talk to you right now.” He said, walking around the sofa to sit beside his Omega, pulling the book gently from his hands.
Draco's eyes widened as his eyebrows practically disappeared into his hair. Kingsley just grinned. "Thank you for the offer Harry, that's very generous of you. That is a fantastic idea, as long as Mr. Malfoy is ok with it." Kingsley replied.
“No!” Harry yelled. “Absolutely not! How would I be able to alter a curse I had no knowledge about what it did in the first place? And Malfoy? Why would I have chosen him to be my, what did you call it? Oh, play thing. Of all people, you think I’d choose Malfoy! Hell, I don’t want to be in charge of taking care of anyone, let alone him!” Harry was in shock. He couldn’t believe he was being blamed for purposefully causing this big mess. “I’m sorry, Professor. I really, really didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I don’t know why it did. Madame Pomfrey said it was because his mental state was more fragile in the moment than his physical one, so that’s why it had happened the way it did. I swear, you can see for yourself. Use a pensieve, Veritaserum, I don’t care. I just didn’t do it on purpose.”
Draco didn’t want Harry to feel pain, but he couldn’t exactly make him fall in love with him either. He tried that, and he truly thought they were close enough. Clearly not.
“Ok, do you need help with those?” He asked, addressing their passports, plane tickets and other travel information that Draco was collecting from the table he had organized them on.
"Alright, with that said, we're going to need to know where and with who you plan on staying, for file purposes, of course." Kingsley added, looking reserved.
He would go by appointments, but would take walk-ins if he had the time. This day was particularly slow, as a Tuesday afternoon would be, so he was taking anyone that would walk in.
“Why don’t make me, Dray.” Harry teased right back, escaping from his husband's grasp and running up the stairs, shrieking as his husband chased him back to bed.
“The one and only.” Ron smirked and took out his work. “Look, mate, we can go to her class later and ask her about it, maybe she’ll remember, or know something more, ok?” Harry could tell Ron was trying to be supportive and helpful, more than Hermione who was muttering away at her potions assignment.
Ok so this chapter was super short, I'm sorry. I thought this was the best way to end the fic as it's already super long. I don't really want to write anymore but if there is anything else you would like me to add, I will consider making a part two of sorts.
Harry took a walk around the rooms, ultimately deciding that even if they did have a fair sized sitting room, a massive bathroom with an equally massive tub, and a bedroom that was bigger than the one he shared with the boys, there would never be enough space to distance himself away from the blond. He was stuck living with him in these dark and dreary quarters, all because of an accidental spell malfunction.
As Harry entered the kitchen after showering and getting ready for the day, he saw Draco had made their breakfast of eggs and bacon. He felt his mouth water as he sat down beside his mate. He kissed his cheek and thanked him for the wonderful meal before digging into it. As he was shoving a forkful of eggs into his mouth, Draco slid the morning paper in front of him.
“I can tell.” Harry said. “It was done impeccably well.” He knelt down beside Draco’s chair and started caressing his blushing cheek. “You are a terrible liar though.”
“I'm fine with whatever you decide. You know I'll always be there for you, for us. I know because you're my mate you're probably... eager, and I am too, but it also can all be intimidating.”
“Well hello there, handsome.” Harry smiled at him. “Sleep well?” He asked, his smile spreading to a grin.
“How is it you always know I’m getting under your skin?” Draco retorted. Harry continued thrusting against Draco’s leg for another minute before he’d had enough.
He stood under the water for a few minutes, not making any moves to clean himself. The cool water was relaxing his irritated body.
“Oh no, it’s only to be taken when you know you two will be away from each other, or when you feel any pain coming on. It can be taken at your own discretion.” she replied. Harry nodded in agreeance.
Harry approached the blond and wrapped his arms around the slightly smaller body. He rested his chin on his head and squeezed slightly.
Nothing more was said as the two moved as one, chasing their releases together. They continued to kiss the whole time, until Draco clenched tightly around Harry, spurting his come over his chest. Harry soon followed, gasping draco’s name before spilling himself into his mate.
“What’re you writing?” Harry pulled back and threw himself down beside Draco on the bench he sat on.
“I was just thinking, how I am with you now rather than anyone else.” Draco leant back to look up at Harry.
Draco knew, however. When he went to inform his newlywed, he discovered how the two had been smiling and laughing so casually, but with an intensity that Draco knew didn’t exists between him and his groom. He stopped in his tracks and felt his heart ache with a terrible pain. He wondered if he would ever have that type of relationship with Harry. He really hoped he would, too.
“I… I promised Ron and Hermione that I’d try to be nice and get to know you. Everyone kept saying that you’re not the same as you were in school, and I know that. But, I’m still the same. It hasn’t quite processed yet that we’re going to be together for the rest of our lives, so I’m dealing with it the only way I know how. I just need a little time to get used to this.”
Harry screamed in delight, pulling his cheeks farther apart, and moaning so loudly, Hogwarts could’ve heard him.
The music started, the people stood, and Harry felt the tightness in his throat return. Willing himself to leave his tie alone, he repeated Ginny’s parting words you’ll be fine, you’ll be fine like a mantra in his head.
A furious looking Snape and adverse looking McGonagall stood in the portrait hole, scanning the room for Harry.
As Harry began wiping his cheek frantically, he scootched a little bit away from the blond. “Malfoy.” He said. “Nice of you to finally join us, dressed.”
Her facial expression remained the same and, realizing she didn’t need anything more from him, he turned back to Harry. The bruise was still gone, and Harry lay there, sleeping peacefully. His heart squeezed painfully, remembering how he passed out at their wedding. This view was scarily similar to that one. He really hoped that Harry was healthy, that there wasn’t something more deep going on within him, and this was just something they could overcome together.
He stood and grabbed Draco’s hand, then dragged him through the maze of people and offices, around a few corners, and down a long stretch of hall, all lined with what seemed to be dark, empty conference rooms. He went to the very end of the hall, Alohamora’ed one of the door locks, and ushered them both inside. Once he had secured the door with his own locking spells (which seemed excessive to Draco, seeing as he only wanted to talk to him), Harry turned around and was on Draco within a second. He lifted him up by the bum and sat him on the main desk, standing in between Draco’s legs, caressing his hair and neck as he kissed him smoothly.
- and holy shit it was the best thing ever! The sweetness of the syrup mixed with the softness of the cake made the flavours complement each other perfectly. Draco saw the excited smile on Harry’s face, clearly waiting for him to tell Harry what he thinks. He swallowed his bite and took a sip of tea.
He wiggles aggressively out of Potters grasp. “We aren’t together. We’re just here to play some pool. I’ve played more games with Ted than I have with you. So on the part of hanging out, there’s more between Ted and I, then us.” Draco said defiantly.
Harry and Draco approached the Minister’s office, hand in hand. They were there to begin their training for their upcoming positions in the ministry. Harry realized he wouldn’t require nearly as much training as Draco would (not that he was happy being a ministry owl, as he calls it), although Harry agreed it would be best for them to both attend critical training arrangements.
They stayed like that for a while, Harry holding Draco, and Draco clinging onto him. The little Omega had stopped crying, but he didn't let go. He couldn't let go.
“That’s good. What’re you guys talking about?” he asked, slinging an arm around Draco as he sat on the edge of the bed beside him. Hermione returned to one of the bedside chairs.
When he was going to change into his swim trunks, it dawned on him; he didn’t bring any. Not being told in advance where they were going for their ‘honeymoon’, Harry didn’t know to pack any with him.
“Draco Malfoy?” Abraham asked. Draco nodded and stood. “Welcome. I’m Abraham Smeed, but you may call me Abraham. I am here to escort you through the Ministry and begin your training as a part of the Ministry of Magic’s Postal Services and Interior Messaging Systems. Or PSIMS. Are you ready to begin?” The man asked. Draco nodded, and followed the stoutly man through the corridors of the Ministry, anxiously leaving Harry behind.
Walkins chuckled and smiled. “Mr Malfoy, a prophecy can’t make someone fall in love. Unless under a love potion, that is entirely their own doing.”
He watched as Harry sat at his large desk and gestured for Draco to sit in the comfy armchair across from him. It was almost as if they were in a business meeting.
Harry sighed deeply, thinking over his choices; which were none, to be completely honest. Hermione was right, he needed to at least try. Ugh, he really hates how right she is sometimes.
“You may sit over in the waiting area, gentleman.” Sarah informs, the smile no longer visible. She must’ve heard Draco’s comment about the memo distributors being owls.
“Oh, ho, kick my butt, huh? You think you can?” Harry said, joining in on Draco’s laughter as he started to tickle the blond.
He allowed the current to slowly drag him across the reef, while Harry inspected the friendly fish around him.
“-with middle-class working plebeian employees that have nothing better to do than gossip over coffee and tea breaks, talking about who just gave the latest blowjob in the men’s bathroom to receive ‘employee of the month’. I know, you told me this morning over breakfast. Just, try to be nice.” Harry pleaded.
“I know you can come like this.” Draco said. Harry nodded frantically, feeling the sensation build up. “Come for me, honey. I love when you do.”
Draco’s snarky attitude dropped immediately, and he pulled back to see Harry clearly. “Don’t you play like that, Harry.” Seriousness dripping from his tone.
The rest of the reception was fairly decent. Harry chatted with the Weasleys for most of the remainder of the time, who all came out to witness the wedding. He had an enchanting conversation with Charlie about the Dragon Wrangling Camp and some of the new editions. He, of course, talked to Hermione and Ron, as well as Ginny. The three of them strictly avoided anything to do with the new Malfoy-Potter situation, and just freely talked about job opportunities now that they were out of school. Ginny also revealed her early acceptance onto the Quidditch team the ‘Holy Head Harpies’, and that her training would start within the next few weeks. Harry was happy he could celebrate something worth celebrating on this day.
“Like the meeting with The Daily Prophet, wanting to know how the Saviour is managing life after Hogwarts; the groceries we need for this week: milk, toast, eggs, all the wonderful stuff; and dinner with Granger and her Weasel. I’m sure I’m forgetting something, so I’m trying to figure out what.” Draco replied, tapping the end of his quill on his chin.
Eventually he released him, and Draco stripped as went running down the boardwalk towards the beach. Once there, he removed his boxers which were last, and ran into the water without hesitation.
Draco slowly makes his way down the stairs, realizing that the Alpha is in some sort of daze and hasn’t made eye contact with him since Draco had come within his sight. Draco walked right in front of him, put both hands on his cheeks and looked deep into Harry’s eyes, trying to bring the raven back to his senses.
“Better, now that he’s here.” Malfoy then winked (WINKED) a Harry. “Hello, lover,” Malfoy said with a smirk.
Harry sat back in his chair, fiddling with a quill when his gorgeous boyfriend swept into the room, filling it with his brightness and ohmygodyes scent. A grin made its way on Harry’s face before he knew it.
It took Draco a moment to realize what he was talking about. His eyes widened and his jaw slacked slightly. “You told them?”
“I think I’m done for the night,” Harry said. He stood to leave, but a throat being cleared brought his attention back.
"Guilty?" The Minister asked the members that sat behind him. Harry didn't have time to count as his eyes frantically flitted across the hands that started to raise. He felt a twisting in his chest as his brain started worrying 'that's a lot of hands...' An auror stepped forward and could be seen quickly counting the raised hands. He did this twice and quietly told Kingsley the number. Kingsley then scribbled on a piece of parchment before speaking the words "And not guilty?"
Harry looked over to the oven before saying “You didn’t turn it on.” Draco just gave him a confused look before Harry continued “You have to preheat it, you know - warm it up before you bake those.”
He watched as Harry stripped down bare, and it then occurred to him that that was the first time he properly saw him naked. Aside from his skinny dip a few days back. He also saw his cock for the first time, and he swears he’s never felt his fill up faster.
"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean too. I just went to check on you, and you weren't in your room. Are you alright?" He asked, stepping further into the room.
Harry was clearly very confused with Draco’s behaviour. “About what? Being married to you? I’ll joke about it all I fucking want, you fucking prick.” Harry rebuked.
Harry shook his head vigorously. “Oh God, no. I don’t think I could. It took me a while to realize that you’re in the same boat as me.”
“So,” Ron began. Him and Harry had entered the study and Ron went to pour them both a drink while Harry took a seat on the sofa.
“Oh, good, cause I was debating on how we could break this prophecy so you didn’t have to deal with me, as I clearly thought that’s how you felt.” Draco responded truthfully. Harry had climbed into bed beside him and he was now combing his fingers through his unruly hair.
Being the powerful Alpha he was, Harry was able to 'block' out the scents that flooded his senses. Why didn't he do this when the blond first came in the room? Well, he had never been in the presence of such a fresh Omega, let alone the strong, addictive scents he gave off.  Harry tried his best to focus on the trial and not the pestering need that itched at the back of his mind to break free.
"That may also hold some control. Anywhere that held an event directly relating to your prophecy or bonding, will hold significant magical traces, able to force control over your relationship, so to speak."
“Well for one, that we actually sit and talk about what is bothering us, instead of just flying off the broom handle.” Draco rolled his eyes at that. “And for another, that we partake in a weekly date night.” Harry said with a beaming smile.
Draco didn’t know what was awaiting him in England, but he knew that as long as he had Harry, he could get through anything. His love had been proof of that.
“Harry. Listen to yourself! We do one thing, once, and now all of a sudden you’re all over me. You had to force yourself to be in the same room as me, just yesterday! A relationship based off of carnal desires is barely a relationship. I want communication and trust.”
Harry moaned, groaned, and fought himself from bucking his hips up too much. Draco continued his ministrations for a while before Harry shrieked above him that he was ready.
“Not really, no. They’re all swarmed down there. It wouldn’t be fair, and they’d probably hate me if I left them with my work.” Draco said, standing up to leave.
Draco thought for a moment. Harry was literally saying he was falling for Draco. Draco was already in love with the man, so there was no need to build on his emotions for the man, he just needed to know that Harry liked him back.
Harry caught the disappointment that flitted momentarily across Draco’s face that was soon replaced with a smile. “Oh good. You should go. You haven’t seen him in a while.”
As he exited the courtroom, Hermione and Ron rushed right too him, asking what happened, what all the shouting was about, if he was ok, what happened to Draco, and so on.
He was surprised to find the pantry and fridge there full with food. He fried up some eggs, toasted bread, shredded cheese and filled two glasses with orange juice. He didn’t know nor ask Harry if he was hungry, but seeing as they hadn’t eaten a full meal since the reception the day before, he could very well guess he was. He didn’t know if Harry liked egg sandwiches or orange juice for that matter. Harry never told him anything. The realization hit him hard when he realized he didn’t know much about Harry, just whatever he had picked up from school. Merlin, this was going to be hard.
“But why, when I’ve got you in front of me now, shaking like you are…” He reached forward and put his hands on Harry’s thighs.
And with that, he sauntered out of the kitchen with a sway of his hips, leaving behind a grumbling Harry to finish his breakfast.
“Ok, love, the cab is here. We have to get all this packed up to take to the airport.” Draco said to Harry as he came out of the bedroom with their bags.
No, he thought. The amount of distance he would have to put between the two of them would most likely mean moving to a whole new country, possibly continent. That wasn’t an option he was willing to consider.
When Ron and Harry came out from the study a little while later, talking more about what the other missed and how life was going in general, they saw Hermione and Draco sitting at the table, teacups in hand, their conversation paused while the two boys came to join them.
Nothing seemed to work, so he decided to just go to bed. 7:30 wasn’t that early, right? He changed into his pajamas and washed up. Harry still wasn’t home and the anxiety grew a little more.
“Good. You know I love you too much. Plus your arse is the best one there is, there’s no way I’d give it up for some sleezy fuck. Do you plan on arguing and fighting with me on avoidable issues just to cause me pain?”
“You know what I mean. It’s not like I was thrilled to marry you in the first place.” Harry continued, anger serging through him.
“My arse fucking hurts from your big wolf dick, you fucker.” Although Draco meant it, there was no real bite to the statement.
“Just so you know, everyone knows. I thought it best to prepare them for a situation like this, I knew was bound to happen. McGonagall didn’t let up easy, did she?”
Harry nodded. “The war…” he trailed off but Draco understood perfectly. He nodded as well and they sat in silence for a minute. Sleep creeping up more into his brain, Draco tucked himself further down under the covers. Harry got the message and turned the bedside light off, then rolled over to the Omega and curled around him.
“Yeah, he did. Out of nowhere, really.” Draco hadn’t revealed what had happened to Harry, just that he was taken to the hospital and that they needed to meet him there ASAP.
Draco walked over to Harry as he was buttoning up his shirt. He reached up to kiss him “I am so proud of you.” He said.
After dinner, one that Draco could happily say was the best he's had in weeks, they separated and left Kreacher to clean up.
He was playing, and Harry respected him too much to just tackle him on the bed and have his way with the blond. So he stood and walked into the bathroom, if only to get away from the (practically) naked Omega. He waited a few minutes until Draco called him out. Thankfully he was dressed, because Harry wouldn’t have been able to control himself if he wasn’t.
“Um, a coke for me Ted, thanks.” Draco said, his eyes still flicking across the room in search of round-rimmed glasses.
He’d seen the look on Draco’s face before he left, he felt the cold barrier Draco tried to build out of thin air to separate himself from Harry, the way he hugged himself so tight… it was all so wrong to Harry, and he knew what he had to do, despite his reluctance to do it. But if he was happy with Draco, and Draco with he, then why not tell everyone? He was dreading it because he didn’t want to hurt anyone, making them think he betrayed them by falling for one of Voldemort’s followers-
But now, he was dressed in a high quality, expensive suit, in a marvellously grand hotel, stuck with the worst, most impossible task he’d never thought possible. He was engaged to marry Draco Malfoy. Someone he could only think of as a disgustingly prideful, horrible, rude git who did nothing but bring anger and annoyance into Harry’s life. He hated this boy with a passion. But, nevertheless, his fate was sealed, or soon to be sealed, all because of a stupid prophecy.
“Of course... I want to bond with you. I want to be connected with you for the rest of our lives. You’re it for me. You’re truly my everything.” He whispered into Draco’s hair, and felt the blond exhale. “But, everything’s been moving so quickly with us, don’t you think?”
“You were doing really good, Harry. We can’t imagine what you’re going through…” Hermione faded, obviously not continuing her thought.
“That’s not true. And it’s not a valid reason. You can stand to be around him because you two were partners in potions for two years, not to mention you both got some of the highest marks out of everyone else by working together. And we did study with him a few times last year. Aside from our younger years, you never seemed to have much of a problem with him at school, especially last year. You two were ok last year. What happened, Harry?”
Harry breathed a sigh of relief. “No, thank you. I’m sure everything will calm down now. Thanks again, Kingsley. I really appreciate this.”
“You know I don’t think that way, Draco. You know that’s not true. If I was aware of any of that, I would’ve requested something better for you, or declined the notion downright, never mind supporting you to accept the offer.”
“Ha, yeah, Ron came up with that one. Personally I prefer ‘The Bent who Lived’, but Hermione said it was too tacky.”
“Refreshing.” Draco said after untying his shoes. He grabbed a glass of water and made his way to the bedroom. Harry followed.
“Just because I didn’t kill you this time, doesn’t mean I won’t!” Harry snarled at him, the only thing stopping him from jumping the blond was Hermione’s hand twisting back his tricep.
Draco bit his lip in an attempt to stop from laughing. “You want to put your cock up my arse, don’t you?” He whispered.
When Harry had finally joined him in the limo, Draco couldn’t help but notice the way Harry shifted as far away from him as possible, while on the other side of the vehicle.
“Touche, Head Auror Potter.” Draco kissed him before throwing powder into the fireplace and shouting out his residence.
“Well, Ron and Hermione were here when you came in. She kept asking all these questions. She probably knows what’s going on, or will, as soon as she does some of her research. You know how she can get.” Draco replied, smoothing his hand down Harry’s arm.
But they continued to kiss now. They pushed and pulled, and made out with each other like neither of them had done with anyone else before.
“I’d be concerned if you did, I’d think you’d have us on your mind all the time, which would be weirder than Snape showering.” Draco said, sitting in what he assumed was Harry’s seat, ignoring Weasley’s earlier denial.
“I love you so much, baby. You were so good for me, so good sweetheart.” Draco peppered kisses all over Harry’s face and neck, rubbing soft hands over the overworked body.
They had gone shopping out to some muggle stores for the day, even though Draco was hesitant at first. Harry convinced him it was just like wizarding stores, but with better clothing and not only robes for sale. Truth is, it helped Harry stay clear of all the reporters flooding the streets, trying to get a closeup of the Boy-Who-Lived-Twice. It was rather annoying not being able to go out in the public wizarding world without a glamour or something, so he tried to avoid it as much as possible.
“Personal relationships, well, that’s on you. There’s Granger and Weasley which they’ll no doubt ask about. As for romantic relationships… well, um…” that’s where Draco seemed to falter and Harry caught on quickly.
“He didn’t have any animosity towards you. He told me so at the wedding. He actually has loved you for quite some time. But I’m guessing you already know that. You were the one to have to get over your animosity, not him. He’s actually a great guy, you know.”
“Ok, Malfoy. What is it you want?” He said, not as unkindly as he thought, turning around in his arms.
Harry went to say something but the kettle shrieked, signalling the water was boiled and the tea ready.
Draco pretended not to notice his stomach squeezing at the sheer adorableness Potter had radiating off of him; a major contrast to the first night he went out with him.
“Because you’re still in the beginning stages of your manifestation. Everything for you is heightened right now. I’m saying no right now because if I said yes right now and you later regretted it once everything calmed down, I wouldn’t be able to lose you like that.”
“Uhh, yeah. I guess. I’m going to say bye to everyone first.” And that he did. He took his time, wishing everyone goodbye, while they all wished him the best of luck.
“When Malfoy was hit with the spell and it, what was it, ‘hindered’ his mental state, what does that mean? What would have happened if it was his physical state?” The thought that Harry could have really hurt Malfoy disgusted him. Although he didn’t like the prick, he didn’t want to kill him.
Harry was a powerful wizard, there was no doubt about that. He defeated Voldemort for Merlin's sake! However, he'd sometimes loose control over his emotions, which always caused his sensitive magic to start going all haywire and radiating off of him, disturbing the natural balances around him. Add some horny, protective Alpha senses to that, and you got yourself one big disaster waiting to happen.
When he was returning to his seat, he looked up and the little hint of brunette hair had disappeared from the top of the front seat. When he went to investigate, he found Harry slouched down, breathing deeply and sleeping soundly. His heart twinged again. He returned to his seat and remained there for the rest of the flight.
Draco woke with a scream ringing in his ears and a pounding heart. Soon realizing that he didn’t dream the cry he was hearing, he quickly went to Harry’s room to find the boy writhing on the bed and screaming bloody murder.
Harry nodded before an uncontrollable grin broke out on his face. “Well, I can almost assure you that you're my mate. So that makes me…” he drifted off in hopes that Draco would get it.
He knew he was probably being ridiculous. This gorgeous man who he loved, was all over him. And like always, he had to ruin it. Why did he have to be like that? Clearly Harry didn’t want Draco the way he wanted Harry. Why couldn’t Draco just accept the way Harry wanted him? Why did he have to go and put feelings into everything?
Harry didn’t know what to do. He didn’t want to say no because that would absolutely crush Draco; but it would also be untrue, because he did want to. It was actually what they were supposed to do- an Alpha bond with his Omega.
Despite them not getting any information to ease their worries, Harry and Draco relaxed into the night with their friends.
When he woke up to the smell of bacon and eggs with a side of fresh Omega, he knew this was going to be harder than he thought.
“Throw me onto the bed, ravish me, and fuck me hard into the mattress until I’m screaming your name?” Harry asked.
“I am so happy for you Draco!” She said, reaching across the couch to hug her best friend tightly. “You finally got with him! The man of your dreams.” She said in a sing-song voice. “I am a little hurt that you’d think I’d want to ruin this for you. I would never do such a thing.”
“Ten to one. Lunch is almost over. Do you want to go back, or stay here?” Harry asked, walk-in to his desk to place some papers on top.
Draco pursed his lips and looked around the living room. "I'm alright. It's just been a long day, I guess." He answered, attempting a small smile.
“Hermione?” She heard the medi-witch call from the hallway. “I brought along Professor McGonagall to help since she’s your head- oh, my dear! Mr. Malfoy? What happened?” Madame Pomfrey ran over and immediately started casting stasis and restorative spells over the limp boy, before levitating him to bring him to the hospital wing.
Harry opened the door and came out of the bathroom then, his towel wrapped around his waist, showing off his muscular back and lean chest.
Harry broke the silence with “I'm not babying you and you're not fine. It started with last night and now today. You came home early, which you rarely do unless for good reason, and now you start coughing uncontrollably. You're getting sick and I don't want to watch you suffer. Now, you can either take a few potions or I can drag you to St. Mungos and you can explain to them what's going on.”
“Oh just fuck me already!” Draco said, ripping himself out of Harry’s grasp and bending over the desk, his arse on full display.
Draco had settled into a crouched position on the boardwalk, with the heels of his palms pressing into his eyes.
Harry grabbed his hands and kissed them with so much love. He didn’t say anything for a while, but Draco knew he wanted to.
After washing up and getting as comfortable in Malfoy’s bed as he permitted himself to be, he was ready to fall asleep.
After showing Draco the fancy sitting room on the first floor he normally reserved for guests and parties, Harry moved onto the basement, then the second floor. He briefly showed his study and the library, then his bedroom, a spare bedroom and the 2nd floor bathroom. He then gestured up to the third floor "There are four more rooms and a bathroom up there, and then the attic is at the very top. I just use it for storage, so there's not much up there. You can pick whatever bedroom you'd like, they're all free." Harry secretly wished that Draco would pick the room beside his and not one on the third floor. Although he'd have to block the Omegas scent all day, he didn't mind much. Especially if he knew he was close.
The evening went by with more laughs and drinking than Draco had had in a long time. Although Gryffindors were brash, obnoxious, and sometimes insanely stupid, they were also fun, and crazy, and ridiculously great friends.
“I enjoy having intellectually stimulating conversations, normally about philosophical or astronomical subjects.”
Harry pushed Draco onto the bed, unbuttoned his trousers, and pulled them off swiftly. He pulled off his own pants and knelt down in front of Draco’s legs.
“Oh Merlin, calm down! We're fine. I just want to talk to you about something, about us… intimately.” Draco's gaze slowly left Harry's, as he suddenly found a loose thread on his pillow very interesting. He knew they would have to get intimate for when they’re bonded and want to mate, and he knew, being the Omega, that it would be him carrying their children. That really made him nervous.
“Ok, but would I be able to take it only when I’m not with Draco, or would it have to be a constant potion I’d have to take, like everyday?” Harry asked. He really hated taking potions.
Fuckdammit Harry Potter was fucking HUNG. If it wasn’t currently spearing Draco open and in half, he’d be screaming expletives at the man above him for daring to have such a big dick.
"I'm positive. I smelt him. I had to block him out, it was so distracting." Harry said, rubbing his hands down his face. "You guys should've been there..." a happy-dazed expression passed over his face.
There was no reply which prompted Draco to look up and saw Harry with the most gorgeous smile Draco had ever seen. And it took him a moment to realize that it was directed to him.
Harry hid behind Hermione, who had her wand drawn in case the blond decided to launch himself at Harry again. She could be scary, when provoked. Dean lifted the spell, and Malfoy’s features immediately softened.
Potter nodded in understanding. “I’m glad that you found something you love. At least one of us learned from the war.” Potter chuckled darkly.
As the days passed since their wedding, Draco felt more and more drained. He felt unprepared for what came with this marriage. At first, Harry didn’t want anything to do with him, and now he doesn’t want anything to do with Harry. This whole situation was so fucked up. He just didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know if it was even worth trying to build a relationship with the boy, because every time he tried, something would cause them to fight and break apart. He never has had good relationships with people.
He followed Chick out to the main room, where the reception desk and stations were all located, and lo and behold the specky git stood, looking more awkward then he did when he was a kid at Hogwarts.
Harry sighed dramatically. “Seeing as we don’t know anything about each other, I thought we could converse in a civil manner about the hobbies we like to partake in.”
Hermione and Ron sit quietly in the supplied chairs beside the bed. Draco sits still, looking at Harry. His face is the same, save for a slight bruise on his cheek. He wonders why the medi-team didn’t heal that. He reaches over and gently caresses his cheek, the spot where the bruise lay. When he extracts his hand, the spot is gone. He gasps.
“I don’t know, you fuckwad!” Draco shouted, turning to look at Harry, now mad that he was pinned down, and in an emotionally vulnerable state while Harry just dragged this on without giving him a solid answer.
The backlash was for sure going to be negative. The Boy-Who-Lived found mate with Ex-Death Eater Malfoy. He knew Draco was so much more than his past and mistakes, but no one else would see that. The change from Malfoy the Prat to Draco the Precious was drastic, but nobody knew Draco like Harry did. And that’s why he decided to keep their relationship private. It was just better that way.
Draco went back to gaping like a fish, but a new blush found it's way on his cheeks. Harry refrained from speaking until Draco did, letting the information sink in. Eventually he found his voice and words “So, how does that work?”
He inwardly apologized to Hermione before saying “I can't… get enough of you. Like, I always want to be around you but I don't want to scare you off.”
“Yes, you uneducated barbarian. I’m surprised you don’t know any better than to not cast such ridiculous charms on your friends, no less. Shame on you. Someone should do the same to you, you great lout.” Draco finished, sipping his whiskey rather loudly.
“Oh, father can suck it.” That earned a scoff from the professor. “I love my Harry. Ain’t nothing coming in between us.” Malfoy said, nuzzling further into Harry’s collar.
“Draco, baby, are you ok?” Harry asked frantically, not aware that Draco had been crying. He continued to check over Draco, asking him again and again if he was hurt.
Harry arrived to the ministry after his talk with Draco, and was allowed to wait for the minister in his office. He needed a moment alone anyways, to really think about everything that was going on with his mate. Aside from the whole Alpha/Omega thing, he just wanted a regular relationship with Draco. He wasn’t keen on how fast things were moving between them, even if he did love Draco and want to spend forever with him. He just wanted things to be normal for once. He wanted to go on dates with Draco, without being pummeled by the press, he wanted to go to sleep and wake up with Draco by his side, without thinking about another thing to worry about between them. He wanted to touch and make love to Draco without worrying about hurting him or making him uncomfortable. He wanted to do things normally, without the risk of his magic threatening everything and everyone around him because of how stressed he was. He just wanted to live a normal-
“Get away, he needs to breathe. Granger, Weasley, help me out here.” That’s when he noticed the other heads of his closest family and friends worriedly standing over him. Draco turned back to him and placed a warm hand on his cheek. “Are you alright?”
Harry’s mouth watered, and his skin became all prickly. His Alpha roared within him, screaming for him to take.
“Harry?” He called, rolling over to see the brunette slipping underneath the covers. “What are you doing? What time is it?”
“Your prostate, most likely. I can’t imagine another reason why it would be so pleasurable the first time.” Draco responded, pulling out with a low groan.
Harry smiled back and decided to let it go. He then gestured for the blond to follow him. "Come, I'll, uh, give you a tour." He said, stepping into the hallway. He stopped short and turned to Draco "Have you been here before? I know this belonged to your mother's family and all, I just wasn't sure."
Draco sighed but summoned enough courage to go on “Well, I know we haven't talked about it yet, and I've been thinking about it, I guess. I know we've come close a few times, but I thought we should talk first. You know, talk about our likes and what we’re comfortable with, everything. I totally understand if you don't want to talk about it right now though, I just thought I'd bring it up-” Draco's rambling was cut off as Harry grabbed his face and kissed him hard.
After he dried off and dressed, he took his clothes down to the basement only to find some already down there. He recognised them as the ones he lent the blond. Wondering why Draco didn’t just use magic, seeing as he didn’t know how to use muggle devices (the oven, for example), Harry threw them into the wash along with his own. Then he realized that he could've too used it too. After turning it on and making his way back up the stairs, he saw a familiar shade of pale skin and blond hair outside. He saw some tea that was made so he silently grabbed a cup, wondering if he should go out and talk to him. ‘Let him come to you.’ Hermione’s words unhelpfully popped up again so he turned on his heel and all but stomped his way back up to his study.
As his back hit the soft cushion of the arm chair, he realized he was breathing. The cool air soothing his burning insides brought him back fully to consciousness. He looked into Ron’s worried blue eyes and nodded, confirming that he was okay. He sat up, readjusted himself as Hermione rushed back into the room with a glass of water and what looked like a wet face towel.
He remained calm, and it worked, helping Draco to relax in his arms. “Really? Only kissing with the Weaselette? Thought you would’ve done a little more than that, Potter.” Draco jibbed, trying to mask his worries.
They were good support, but they weren’t a man, and they wouldn’t give him the type of love he needed, that he craved.
“Yeah, mate. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the git run so fast. He was beside you before you even hit the ground.”
Draco sighed, trying to think of a quick comeback that didn’t remain untrue but that didn’t reveal anything either, before he was saved by strong arms wrapping around his shoulders, making him jump.
“You went out far. Didn’t know if I had to come save you.” Harry replied, wrapping his arms around the blond.
"Knowing you, you're probably being to forward with your questions. You should let him come to you. He's just really flustered, you know, being under the same roof as an Alpha and all." She said back to him.
Harry stared at him incredulously, before reining himself in. “You’re staying there tonight,” he said before he ran off to the bedroom, Malfoy’s voice of ‘what are you afraid of!’ echoing behind the closed door.
Neither of them knew where they were, seeing as Draco’s parents picked the destination for them, since they were using their private plane to get there.
Now, as Draco stood in front of Harry like a FEAST, Harry was really concerned they hadn’t finished their intimate conversation.
The dick in his hand jumps as he stands. He pushed Harry’s legs up to his chest to reveal a beautiful dark, furled hole without a trace of hair around it. Draco sucks in a breath at the sight. Before he can do anything, he bent forward and licked a long stripe all the way to Harry’s bullocks.
Harry was leaning so far off his seat, subconsciously trying to get closer to the blond, to the magnificent sent of the Omega, that he was surprised he didn't fall off. He snapped up from his daze as he heard the minister call on him to make his statement towards Draco.
Oh, hello. Sorry I haven't updated this in a while. It's been on my mind for days but I've been super busy. This chapter is very long and it has taken a lot to write it. The next few chapters should come easy and I'm hoping to post again soon. This one is full of fluff and Drarry, I hope you like it! It's been a challenge to write, but I'm not giving up. Please please review! :)
Then the prophecy appeared, and all of a sudden Draco was to blame for ruining Harry’s life. He wasn’t going to live with this animosity for the rest of his life. He just wanted to be happy, too, and he hadn’t felt that in a long time.
“I know, but how’re we supposed to stop this? I’ve had enough and I know you have too. Don’t deny it.”
“Yes, I suppose. Which makes me a really horrible husband, I know. It’s just still new to me, and being home now, with you, it’s all hard to deal with. But I’m trying. I will say things neither of us want to hear, but I’m really hoping you’ll stick with me anyways because there is no one else that I would want to go through this with me.” Harry explained.
“Woah, woah, what do you mean? Why didn’t you tell me you were feeling these things? You should’ve told the healers!” This made Draco nervous. This prophecy keeps fucking with them, more so than it had before when they wanted to kill each other during the beginning of their honeymoon. “How long have you been feeling them?”
It was a day like no other. He got up, got ready, went to work, and brought out the internal beauty that he knew all his clients had, by fixing up their hair.
“Oh, Harry. Are you alright? What happened? You really scared us.” She said, placing the cup in his hand and wiped his face clean of tears and sweat.
“Well, seeing as his mind was compromised, it seems that he had no control over what he was doing. Based on my professional estimate, it seems that Mr Malfoy has become attached to you in some way, prior to the confrontation. The spell damage just happened to unlock his attachment in a way, allowing himself to disregard all usual restraint he might’ve had before the incident.”
Quickly, in their urgent state of arousal, they spelled off their clothes and rearranged themselves so Draco was kneeling, his arse up and on display for Harry.
He Apparated them within his apartment, straight into his room. He sat on the bed, never letting go of Draco.
Having gotten a pass from Pansy, Draco stood in the doorway to the Auror offices, looking over all the cubicles that housed the Junior and Senior Auror staff. His eyes scanned the crowded room, a sea of scarlet robes overwhelming his visual senses. With trepidation, he marched through the crowd, making his way to the back of the offices, where he knew Harry’s desk was located. He knew this, of course, from Pansy who frequented the DMLE offices as she did the rest of the Ministry.
She glanced between him and Ron. “Well, I was going to say that he’s not as bad as you think. He’s changed the last few years, and well, I don’t think you noticed but he was the first one by your side when you fainted.” Hermione said softly, trying to consoling him, trying to find anything that might change Harry’s mind. Ron seemed to notice ‘cause he stepped forward too.
“Ah, Harry, so glad you could join us. Draco here has been informed of the recent event that took place. Now, if you remember, I require your memory from the moment this afternoon.”
She nodded, shook his hand, and went on her way. Draco turned to make his way back to Harry’s room, when Hermione’s voice called out to him from down the hall.
Draco looked at him thoughtfully before replying. "No, I've got nothing. And honestly, yes. I'd love to leave this place." He spoke softly and seriously, completely different from his normal, snippy tone Harry was used to hearing at school.
“Get-off of me! Malfoy!” Harry pushed and pulled at the blond to try to get himself detached, so he could run away from this odd version of Malfoy that seemed to surface.
"I'm fine, and Kingsley wanted to discuss something after. Draco's been cleared of all charges, and he's out free. Also," he turned to where the blond stood behind him, watching the three friends converse. "he's going to be staying with me for a while." He turned back to his friends to gauge their reactions with a smile on his face. They then seemed to notice that he stood behind Harry.
“Malfoy, stop touching me or I will bind you up, Muffliato your voice, and leave you in the shrieking shack, all alone, until we find some sort of fix to your insanity.” Harry concluded in a quiet tone, lest any outsiders hear his threat.
Harry stood and placed a kiss on the Omega’s head, then made his way back to sit at his desk. He looked over at the blond with a smile on his face. “I can’t believe that we’re together now.”
Within the next beat, he was pushing inside Draco’s small hole, his large, hard Alpha dick ramming straight through him.
Ron left to tell the rest of the guests that yes, there would be a wedding, and yes, it would be today. He said that Harry just needed a few moments, but that he’d be back out. Draco and him shared a look, one Ron could only describe as relief.
