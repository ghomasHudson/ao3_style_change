“You sound like Ron,” Harry says.
“It’s possible that every team has to include one person from Beauxbatons in
Leon’s lips quirk into a smile. “Hi. This is kind of weird. I’m somehow eighteen years old and a newborn infant all at once.”
Draco shrugs. “Bits and pieces,” he lies. “I don’t really make it a habit to purposely intrude on people,” he says, shooting (admittedly weak) daggers at Weasley. He stands up gingerly. “I just suppose it’s unfair to the other students that I’ve had the first lesson spoiled for me.”
“That’s what I said, isn’t it?”
Be it only drops, Harry’s blood
“Professor,” Draco says, which causes McGonagall to flinch and straighten. She looks at him and he glances at the crowd of students, their anxious drone beginning to crescendo.
“I killed him, Harry. It all happened so fast, but suddenly he was on the ground and so was Marcus, and then I was completely paralyzed and all I could hear was Ariana screaming as that
“You could try again,” Ron suggests, but Harry looks at him sharply and he closes his mouth.
to have Harry Potter teaching them Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Confused, he frowns at her. “What?”
Harry Potter.
Harry turns on his heel. Points his wand at Pamela.
The corridors are eerily quiet. Even the paintings on the walls have fallen silent, like they’re afraid of being found, being targeted. It’s happened before, and in the midst of of all of the recent disarray, it’s not entirely unlikely.
“I would agree.”
in Hogsmeade when the second attack happened. How do you explain that?” Harry spits.
“So...Potter’s been made a professor,” Blaise says after a pause.
“Well, I’m off, then,” Luna says, and Harry tries to conceal a smirk.
“Er, hello everyone—” He stops mid-sentence, astounded at how instantly all chatter ceases and all eyes jump to him. He scans the room, faces full of eagerness and curiosity shining up at him. “Right. Hello, again. My name’s Harry, you can call me…well, just Harry’s fine, really.”
a Ravenclaw, after all. And her words are a validation, but there’s something else, too. It just feels like something is missing, a bigger piece than he can even fathom. Maybe it’s his lack of idea for any compelling motive, especially in contrast with the way Leon clings to Harry like a life raft. Either he’s an excellent actor, or there’s something Draco is missing. Maybe Harry isn’t a target at all.
, he thinks, shuddering as he races through the events of…when was it? How long has he been out? Birds are chirping somewhere, the sound hovering in through an open window, and all seems placid.
“Enough furniture talk!” Molly says as she lays a pile of toast next to the rest of the food. “Where’s Ginny?”
came from his room.” The words hang in the air, conductors of cognitive dissonance. It’s…not possible. Draco knows what he saw, he
He rolls his eyes at himself and continues, abandoning his half-sneaking posture.
Now, after a stretch of time without even thinking about his scar, Harry can say with conviction that it is, in fact, faded to a marginal degree, and he beams at the prospect that everything—even the worst thing, the darkest, most vile—will heal with time.
Draco nods. “I think so. But it will be good. We can be better. Happier.”
“I don’t care. I’m saying what’s on my mind. And
“Well there’s two of us, really,” Leon says.
to say is that he doesn’t want to be away from you,” Hermione adds quickly and leans in. Harry swats at her arm and she backs off, laughing to herself.
. I’m just a bit baffled at the moment. This doesn’t change anything between us, does it?”
Harry’s eyes flicker open. “What about him?”
“Oh, thank you, Mister Potter,” she says, sighing as she sinks down into it.
“Draco? One more thing I think you need to hear. You’re going to have to forgive
“You do?”
“Right?”
“Er. Hello?”
. The sound of someone Apparating downstairs booms through the silent house.
“I should warn you. I have no idea what I’m doing.”
the credit.
Draco pulls back, unsettled by the sudden contact and closeness.
Draco sprints toward Gryffindor Tower; it’s a good a place as any to start. He has no idea how long it’s going to be before the next incident occurs, but it sounded like soon, and the Great Hall is the target again. Lungs burning, he rounds a corner and almost bowls over Hermione, who drops a stack of books. “Shit, sorry,” he says and throws himself to the floor to help gather them up.
There’s a pause, rife with silent tension. A wave of nausea rolled over Draco at the words ‘blood magic,’ and the memory of Potter slicing open his and Draco’s hands flashes through his head. He hadn’t had time to register what actually happened in that moment, but looking back it does have immediately concerning implications. If it’s possible, Draco’s chest tightens even more at the thought of it.
Hermione steps forward with a broad smile. “Same to you, Professor.”
be relieved, so he’s confused why the feeling is so clear.
She gives him a look. “His painting can’t testify.”
“Tell everyone I say hello,” Draco says, his throat tightening. He’s nearly forgotten the severity of the situation, and such a request feels inappropriately mundane. Still, Harry nods and runs a thumb over Draco’s left cheekbone.
going on?”
“That’s perfectly alright,” she says, her smile informing him that she means it. “These days, it doesn’t seem like we have much of a job, does it? Everybody is so well-behaved.”
Another nod. He’s worried that if he tries to speak he won’t be able to stop, so he elects to keep his mouth closed.
To Draco’s surprise, his mother laughs at this, though it’s also tinted with something akin to a sob. “And proud I am,” she says. “I know you can’t ensure his innocence, but I just need to know he’s safe. It’s been torture, this not knowing.”
“I’ll be back in a couple hours,” Harry says, smiling. “Just have to run upstairs and change into something more comfortable.”
He shakes his head, tears pricking his eyes. “Yeah. Just having a mild existential crisis.”
Harry chuckles. “I completely understand. You should’ve seen him a year or so ago. He wasn’t just a prat, he was an
“Please, I have something that I wanted to talk to you about. It’s about Harry.”
Harry snorts. “Like that was ever going to happen.”
Harry forces himself to slow down and really read the letter, taking in every bit of information. He’s scanning it again when he realizes there are other pieces of parchment behind the one he’s reading and quickly flips to the next, which he instantly recognizes as the list of books and things they’ll need. Intrigued to find that there are two more pieces of paper, he slips that one in the back of his stack and begins the next one.
“Fine. But McGonagall is just as reliable. She made him Prefect, after all.”
His mother’s eyes widen. “Oh? That’s…nice.”
“What do you think Ron will think of all this?”
“When the hell did you get here?” Draco asks.
His face reddens further. “I’m sorry, I never should’ve—”
“Oh,” Draco says. “Tomorrow?”
“Right, something like that.” Harry suggests this partially because it makes sense to him to work chronologically, but also because he would rather get the discussion of his missteps out of the way.
Channels of red pour into the castle’s maw, a current of air gently tugging Harry and Draco into the Great Hall. Harry swallows down a mouthful of bile and almost falls over when Draco jumps into action. There are several students pressed up against the walls, holding on to extinguished candles, their wailing hardly audible over the whining howl of the pit. Even if the vacuum wasn’t devouring everything in sight, the chasm has grown too big to go around.
Harry’s heart jumps in his chest and his mouth goes a bit dry. “Oh?” he says, trying to sound casual.
“You mentioned ‘larger consequences.’ Draco, if you have information that could—”
Leon slowly lowers himself down, onto his back, allowing his head to come and rest in the nest formed by Harry’s legs. He looks uncomfortable for a moment, painfully hesitant, and then it seems he allows himself to relax and it all flows out of him.
Ron smiles. “Though this is going to take a little bit of time for me to get used to, I can see that you’re happy when you talk about him.”
“Can I ask what you’re so afraid of?”
“But the bad things are going to happen whether or not you think they’re going to, right? I’ve felt enough pain for a lifetime, I think,” he says with a dark chortle. “I’d rather just hope for the best and deal with whatever else presents itself.”
“Hello!” Draco calls.
“Leon…I would love to go with you. But it’s in a week. I just don’t know if I’m ready for that.”
“Mister Weasley will be fine,” she finishes, waving him off the subject. “And I’m sure you’ll understand that I can’t promise anything. Especially with so many Gryffindors in attendance and all that. Rules are rules.”
make an appearance is a single wisp of silver mist, which then dissipates.
“So, that feels like quite enough talking for now, doesn’t it? Let’s play some Quidditch!”
McGonagall nods. “Right after the feast, she came right here to this office and laid out a very logical argument for why it should be you. And no offense intended, Potter, but I do trust Granger’s academic judgment a bit more than yours.”
for you? Do you even know who you are?”
“I am
Hermione looks back at Harry, who holds his hands up in a sort of half shrug. She gives him a look as if to say
Draco looks around at the single pan he used to cook his bacon and taps his palm against Harry’s cheek. “You’re lucky you’re attractive, Potter.”
“Are you all right?” Harry mouths.
The room erupts into cries of
Leon shakes his head. “My parents gave up almost right away. Not because they didn’t care, but because they just couldn’t fathom a way that she made it out, even though there was no evidence that she
“I’m so sorry,” Draco whispers, but Harry either doesn’t hear or chooses not to respond. After another moment, he gives Draco’s arm a little tug and they head downstairs to look at what the first floor has to offer. The staircase deposits them into a sitting room, small and cozy, fireplace and worn furniture. “How long did they live here?”
just have a normal breakfast?”
“Fine,” Ginny says, not even really thinking about it. “Fine.”
“He’s
“Stop apologizing!” Harry says, laughing gently, earning him a bashful smile.
People fall into their seats. Draco looks up at Harry and tries to ignore the heat blooming in his face. He feels lucky that his location in the back of the room is not well populated. He frowns. That Leon boy…he’s not here.
Sure enough, on his way there, almost every person he passes gives him a strange look. Strange because….they aren’t disapproving? He doesn’t see one glare, one sneer. He hears some whispers as he passes groups of people about how he’d saved someone, even after being attacked himself. A few mentions of Harry Potter’s name as well. One or two people even manage to smile at him.
be this nice to him after…everything?
“What—…Can I ask what you saw?”
Harry stares at her, trying not to let his mouth fall open. He scrunches his eyes shut and opens them again, sure he hadn’t heard her correctly. “You’re interested in
“Glad I could be of service.”
“Actually, I’m not sure,” Harry says. “I hadn’t even thought of it. She doesn’t know where she is, obviously, just that he’s off the grid, I suppose.”
“Our guests have arrived,” McGonagall says simply.
“Shut up. Read this.” He shoves a paper in Draco’s face, and his heart drops through his back and burrows into his bedsheets when he sees an old picture of his father, and the headline: “
Leon shakes his head. “There were no warnings, no explanation. Just mindless violence. I've talked endlessly with Madame Maxime about it, and we believe it may have been an attempt to cover to Dark Lord’s back and make sure you wouldn’t be able to call on our aid when he attacked here. Or maybe he was trying to see if anybody was scared enough to come to his side.” He pauses, squeezing Harry’s hand slightly. “
“Better luck next time!” he calls to Draco, who is sitting almost directly below him, his mouth wide open. Harry means it too; he has a feeling there
The two stand and stare at each other for a tense moment, and when Harry is certain Draco has nothing else to say to him, he huffs and turns on his heel. Before he can go anywhere, Draco’s hand is around his wrist. Harry stops in place, still facing away.

Ron lifts his head from where it was cradled in his hands between his legs. “They’ll be fine.”
“Are you sure you’re good to go?” he murmurs, watching as Madam Pomfrey tends to the other boy.
be sorry, will never not feel a sucker punch pang of remorse when Harry looks at him.
“It seems Hermione and I have very different ideas of ‘letting up,’” Ron grumbles, sitting down next to Harry. He yelps when his mother also smacks him.
“A little soon, I suppose. Perhaps later on.”
Harry is considering giving a quick warmup talk, but Madam Hooch is calling for positions. He gets a good look at the other team and his head spins for a moment when he sees Draco Malfoy is the other Seeker. Good. They’d done this dance before. Harry knows that when he sees the Snitch, Draco tends to get tunnel vision and forget there are twelve other players in the air. Harry might be able to use that to his advantage.
“I mean, I don’t want to sound ungrateful, but it’s all just so much…”
scares me, if I’m being entirely honest.”
“As you know, I, myself am learning as I go,” Hooch continues. “This is an exciting new twist on our tradition, and I am greatly honored to be part of it and excited to see what’s in store. That being said, and in keeping to that tradition, we will have four teams in total!”
Draco nods. “Works for me.”
“It’s pointless,” Harry says. He’s stopped walking. Draco stops too, stunned.
Harry exchanges a glance with Leon. “No. And yes,” he answers. “We’re still trying to figure it out.”
He could tell Slughorn, but he still doesn’t have any evidence that would actually pin Leon down. It’s all just hearsay, word against word. Not worth it.
“Wait, you do?”
“You’re an idiot.”
“I wasn’t much help,” she responds, though she seems unbothered. “I’m not very good in emotional conflicts like those. Harry’s quick on his feet, you know?”
Ron nods, looking rather pale.
She exhales deeply and rolls her eyes. “Fine. But if you waste my time, I
He draws his wand and taps the envelope to test a few spell-detection methods. Nothing. His suspicion alleviated but not gone, he sets his wand down close by and opens the letter. He holds his breath as he unfolds it and braces himself for whatever might be inside.
“What’ve you been up too?” Harry asks as innocuously as possible.
“How are
Hermione sighs. “Well I suppose today can’t be easy for her. All this attention on Harry?”
of problems. Perhaps it’s just a byproduct of being hidden himself.
All eyes are on him, expressions slightly tense and curious. After a second, he smiles and says “Well, let’s eat, then!”
Harry considers covering his ears as the pitch shakes with the cries of joy and excitement.
“Let’s do it,” Draco says with a firm nod, feet planted in the carpet of the Potters’ living room. Everything is moving so quickly, but he’s leaning into this momentum so he doesn’t overthink the plan and back out.
For reasons inexplicable, he had felt a surprising lack of bone-deep loathing upon seeing the messy head of dark hair across the platform. Though maybe the reasons are perfectly explicable. But as he shuffles into the throng of people buzzing with excitement, he finds he’d really rather think about other things. Besides, his arm is suddenly being abducted into the grip of another, startling him. He looks to his right and sees Pansy Parkinson looking at him, clearly amused at his brief fright.
Harry had also been chosen to play in the third game, which he lost to that Denise girl from Ravenclaw. Hey, you can’t win them all. She does make him nervous, though. He’s never seen such an aggressive and risk-taking Seeker. And that’s coming from
Harry sticks out his hand, forcing his eyes to stay on Draco’s. “You. Er. Left this.” In his hand is Draco’s (Hermione’s) black hair tie. As his hair falls in front of his eyes, Draco realizes that he did in fact take it off in frustration and leave it in the classroom.
Take care of yourself, Harry. Everybody else is going to be just fine, and now you need to make sure that you’re going to be fine, too.
“Harry? Are you alright?” Hermione asks quietly, trying not to draw too much attention away from the story Ron is telling to everyone. He blinks, realizing he’d been staring down at his plate.
“A phase of what?” Bill asks as he descends the stairs and sweeps into the kitchen. Harry’s eyebrows shoot toward his hairline.
“Draco Malfoy. As in,
“You don’t have anything else to say?”
“Er. Right.” Harry’s face is still blazing as Luna speaks. “Look, Luna, about the letter…”
Draco hears vaguely familiar laughter carrying across a courtyard as he nears the castle again, exhausted. It’s with displeasure that he finally recognizes the laugh as it rings out again, this time in response to a familiar feminine voice. Potter, Granger, and Weasley enter the courtyard, Weasley’s face still stretched wide with laughter. Potter looks more serious. Draco pauses behind a pillar, both tired of walking and interested in hearing their conversation.
He watches as Leon does the same surveillance of the area, then turns to him.
“Well. Indirectly, yes. I would like to offer you the position of Slytherin Prefect.”
A sharp breeze ripples across the lake, spraying cool water through the air. It snaps Harry back to reality just in time for him to trip and hit the ground.
Harry swallows, confused about this sudden rush of nerves. “Er, yes, that would be great. Thanks, Draco.”
“Which is why you’ve taken it upon yourself to spearhead the ‘Free Draco Malfoy’ campaign?”
Returning to his spot on the bed next to Harry, Draco takes his hands. “It’s all right. I
“Hermione, I…I think I might be…” He can’t get the word out. She quirks an eyebrow, waiting for his response. “I think I might be gay.”
The skin around Leon’s eyes crinkles as he smiles. “I know. And I want to help you through that. Baby steps, right? Maybe you come out first, and then we go public soon after?”
“The Weasleys have been through quite a bit, you know. Once your innocence is proven, I don’t see why they would have any objections.”
Harry is going through his plans for Defense again as they enter the castle—an introduction to Patronuses—when Draco stops him. Physically stops him. He puts out his arm and stops walking. Harry nearly trips forward. It seems like Draco is tripping on his words.
“It’s a burn salve, but I chose one of the higher-intensity recipes. Tweaked to work twice as fast as it normally would. Hypothetically.”
“You saw what happened in class today! He disarmed me in front of everybody!”
“Oh, you don’t have to—” Harry starts, because it would really be much easier if he didn’t have to tell her all of this head on.
It feels like a punch in the gut. But a warm one, a soft blow that wakes him up rather than knocking his lights out. Draco feels his face flushing, unsure of how much exactly Potter knows about his life.
“It’s nothing,” Draco grumbles as he allows Harry to help him up. A ripple passes through his body when their hands meet. “Thanks for the help.”
“Of course it’s not,” Draco sighs. “But we don’t have a lot of options right now.”
“Could you not eat like a barbarian?” Molly says and swats his legs, which he removes from the other chair with a roll of his eyes. “Really, you’re supposed to be a full grown adult man, Bill,” she mutters to herself.
“Hermione—”
“We really need to stop doing this,” he says, causing her to giggle as well.
that you had a choice in any of this.”
“No, I agree. So what do I do in terms of classes, then?”
“Don’t be impatient, there’s just a short walk—”
else who can do it?”
Ron’s laughter dies an instant death. “Sorry?”
She huffs, looking at the ground. “Fine. I still do.”
—at least, that’s what I keep telling myself
“He said he had something to take care of,” Harry says, still craning his neck to see if he’s missing something. “I assumed it was family business by how serious he seemed.”
“I couldn’t agree more.”
Harry Potter didn’t have some influence on the sheer amount of interest. He tries to think rationally about the situation, knowing that he has the support of the likes of Kingsley, McGonagall, and Hermione (honestly, the most comforting of the three).
“No, I can’t. I get it.”
Propping himself up onto his elbows, Draco surveys the trio before him, backlit by a golden sunrise. “Harry was the one who flew into a black hole to save Ginny.
“But it’s just for the term, right?”
“My father has been sighted in Italy.”
When they arrive at the Great Hall, there’s a commotion at the board outside the doors.
“I bet,” Harry says, standing suddenly. “Um. So. I think I should get back to Hogwarts soon. Just, you know, make everybody aware that you’re alive and safe and all that.”
“But don’t you think there’s a more productive way to work through all of this?”
Leon grabs his arm and turns Harry so that he’s facing him.
The firelight accentuates the blush creeping into Leon’s cheeks, pink glow and shimmering eyes.
Hermione laughs. “Well, you’re not with him now, are you? How do you feel?”
He gives her a look and she goes a bit red.
Draco holds his breath as his mother rises and exits the room, passing them briskly. She pauses and frowns, gathering her shawl close to her chest and turning to the spot where Draco and Harry stand. Harry’s grip tightens around Draco’s wrist. She shakes her head and blinks a few times, then mutters to herself and goes off to the pantry.
That’s why he’s so confused about why he’d run from Leon. About why he’s been avoiding him. Shutting him out completely. And why it hurts
“Bloody hell,” Ron mutters under his breath.
“Right, I actually wanted to talk to you about that,” Harry says and folds his hands, trying to look dignified, adult. She needs to know that this isn’t some silly little crush. “And there’s…something I think I should tell you.”
“The Great Hall,” Draco says.
“Sure thing,” Harry says. He smiles at Draco, and then he’s off.
“I’m serious,” Harry confirms. Leon kisses him and pulls away. He doesn’t say a word, but the look in his eyes is enough to set Harry’s whole body ablaze.
I, that’s the question.” He smiles even bigger when everybody laughs. Harry notices that with the smile briefly returns that same glow he’d thought to be absent. “I’m not very good, but I do know that there are quite a few students from Beauxbatons that take it very seriously. I’ll be very interested to see what kind of teams end up being formed.”
“That’s why I hugged you. Just to make sure you were real.”
“It’s Harry,” comes a breathy voice from the other side of the door.
“I know, but there’s nothing to fight anymore,” she says, sounding weary, so weary. “You have to start your life at some point, Harry. It’s scary leaving Hogwarts and going out into the real world, but as I’m sure you’ve realized, the veil between them is incredibly thin. And you more than anyone knows what’s out there. It’s time. You and your friends have learned all you can here.”
“Supposedly, yes,” Pansy says, matching the blonde’s dull tone.
They start to walk simultaneously, an unspoken agreement to keep quiet as they trek through the grass. The first half of September and the beginning of their final year at Hogwarts is behind them, perhaps sleeping in a dip by the lake like Draco had been. The air is starting to cool off little by little, and the breeze that ripples across the ground and pushes the hair away from Harry’s face is welcome against the sun. A single stray cloud skitters across the sky, looking for friends.
“But these are nice surprises!” she says, her tone pleading with him just slightly.
Harry breaks from Ron and tries to intercept as they approach the doorway up to the girls’ rooms, but as soon as they’re close enough, Ginny separates from Luna and scrambles up the stairs. Harry stops next to Luna and huffs.
. Bill pulls out his wand quickly and clears the air, fighting for breath the whole time. “That’s absolutely incredible,” he says.
She nods, though not to answer the question but to confirm that she’s heard. “Honestly, Draco? I can’t answer that. I think you’re going to have to ask him yourself.
disagrees,” Harry says and throws off his covers. He slips out of bed and pats Ron on the shoulder, nodding in Draco’s direction. Ron ducks his head and huffs a laugh through his nose, but turns his chair around and scoots closer as Harry joins Hermione at the edge of Draco’s bed.
Another tear dribbles down his cheek. “So that’s it? We just have to pack up our things and go home?”
what he wants. As much as he needs to be with his mother, there are so many echoes in that house. And in the short time he’s been marooned in Godric’s Hollow, the Potters’ house has come to feel much more like a home than Malfoy Manor ever felt.
While that’s fair enough, Draco still finds himself craning his neck in an attempt to see exactly what state she’s in.
When the whistle blows, Harry shoots into the sky like he never has. Sure, he’d played some bollocks rounds at the Burrow, but nothing beats the wide open sky that the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch has to offer. For a second he forgets he’s technically in the middle of a tryout as he zips around, loving the balanced speed and control of his new broom. It isn’t until a Bludger whizzes dangerously close to his face that he remembers his role.
“That’s…good? This seems like a good thing. Why are you not more excited?” Draco is definitely thrown; this woman is essentially Harry’s mother, so this news should come as a win.
Draco gives her nothing more than a curt nod and ignores the blonde Slytherin, Pamela, who always seems to be here.
Ginny’s shoulders tense noticeably at the sound of his name, then relax. She turns. “Oh. ’llo,” she says
“That’s fine! I’m just trying to help you see that there are options. Now, you said that there have been confusing moments with this person recently. Do you want to talk about them?”
“I didn’t think I would get this far.”
Bella shrugs. “Partially, yes. He’s our team captain, after all.”
“I would have no idea what to even say. ‘Hey there, I know I despised you for years but now I think you’re pretty fit. Care for a snog?’ I don’t really see that going over well.”
“Nor do we,” Kingsley says. If Draco isn’t mistaken, there’s something almost
Madam Hooch turns to the four new teams as everybody else trickles out.
She shrugs quickly and bites at one of her nails. “He’s already broken one of the most fundamental rules by Disapparating on Hogwarts grounds. Plus, we never could figure out to the full extent how the Room of Requirement works. I would say…it’s possible, but not plausible.”
“Professor, with all due respect,” Draco says, the plan falling together like tracks being laid out in front of a moving train, “I think it might be wise to give everyone some time to recover and reflect. We’re all exhausted and emotionally compromised after what just happened. What if we met tomorrow afternoon instead? It’s a Sunday, after all, so nobody should have any prior commitments.”
“You know, you saved my life, I saved yours. No more emotional debt.”
“You were the only female Keeper who tried out, weren’t you?” Ginny asks.
Leon,
“Oh. Yeah. I guess it is.”
“My mother and I are both suddenly suspected of being accomplices in all of this. Which is ludicrous. If I could turn him in—if I could go out and drag him back here myself—I just might.”
Draco takes the less-travelled corridors on his way back and sure enough is met with looks of disgust and even fear. The mood in the castle is somber but frantic, like a colony of rodents living inside a giant mouse trap—nobody wants to be the one to set it off. He keeps his head down and his pace quick, avoiding all eye contact possible. Despite the risk, he decides to take the corridor that connects to the dungeons and hopes nobody else is dumb enough to still be hanging around there.
Holding hands with Leon makes him realize he was wrong.
“Not really.”
who to love? I mean, for Merlin’s sake, you just told me you’re harboring a criminal—”
He’s must be in someone’s bedroom. It’s void of any personality: a bed with a maroon duvet, two wall sconces that look like they haven’t been lit in years, a desk, an empty bookshelf covered in dust.
Hermione nods, her eyes glistening in the evening sun. Ron gives him a pat on the shoulder and grins.
The second match Ron scores twice and gets a little too overconfident, completely blowing the rest of his chances to do so. They start a third match, but it comes to an abrupt halt when Ron and Harry collide in the air, both thrown from their brooms. There’s a shriek from below as Hermione whips out her wand, catching them both with well-timed cushioning charms.
swing that way. So even if you did manage to breach the subject with one of their friends—which would be a bit awkward, I imagine—they might not even give you a truthful answer.”
“What does this mean for…us?”
“I’m glad you’re safe,” Harry says after a moment and pulls away. Draco is shocked to see that his eyes are glassy as well, and the emotion in him seems to double down at the sight.
“Fine, fine” Hermione says, smiling.
Leon nods, finally looking up and smiling at Harry. “I’m sorry for eavesdropping,” he says. “I was going out to go for a walk, and then I heard you talking so I didn’t want to interrupt, but—”
The room is too warm, even despite the open window. Harry tries to focus on the scratching of his quill and not Leon directly behind him, head rolled back onto Harry’s shoulder—needless to say, he’s having a difficult go of it.
“It was an invited invasion, though.”
Harry smiles. “No, I mean
. Stop,” Harry says after they’re out of earshot from anybody. “Are you okay?”
There’s a pause and Draco hears his mother blow her nose, somehow dignified even in this. “I still don’t understand how he managed it.”
“Fat chance. I just got a brand new broom.”
Harry pauses, mulling that over. “I see your point, but that’s not what this is. Sure, there are some things I’ve yet to work through, but I can promise that this—you—aren’t one of them. Besides, it’s not like I’m totally innocent in the grand scheme of things.”
Harry takes in a sharp breath. “Oh. I’d forgotten about that. So what is this?”
Minding his business, Draco leaves and allows the door to close behind him. There are too many other things to think about.
“I guess.”
“Headmistress, we need you at the staircases. There’s been another accident.”
And then there’s the matter of the culprit. Draco is about to lift his concealment charm and vacate the premises when Leon emerges. He’s pale, clammy.
“But you could be in trouble too,” Hermione says, stifling a sob.
“Please, don’t be. It’s over now. He won’t even remember me when his mind healing is complete.” It hurts, should hurt more, Harry thinks, but he’s already scraping the bottom of his emotional barrel, coming up with measly despondent droplets.
“If you say so,” Mari says. She crosses her arms, clearly not convinced. “You should tell your friend. It may cause some bad blood initially, but I think this person will eventually come around and respect you for telling the truth.”
Hermione blinks at him. “Explain to me, in detail, what you did.”
“Sit,” she says, and it’s a command but it’s gentle and coaxing and at its heart is a clear desire to help with whatever it is that’s gotten into him. He pulls out a chair across from her and throws himself into it, suddenly anxious to unburden his mind.
“The blood magic,” he says, like it should be obvious that
“It’s going to hurt. A lot.”
“Fair.” Hermione reaches across the table and grabs his hands, then recoils. “Harry?”
“Welcome back to Hogwarts,” she says, exhaling in relief as the entire Hall erupts into applause. Even Draco finds himself clapping. Every member of the staff is beaming, and Draco feels something strange rise in his chest. Nostalgia, maybe? Happiness? McGonagall allows the celebration to continue for a few moments, then extends her arms once more.
“And you taking his Defense class, surely that was a bluff, right? You haven’t actually gone through with it?”
“If you hear anything, send a Patronus,” Harry says and heads for the door.
Draco snorts, then gasps as she starts to spray cold water all over his head. The sharp clink of scissors sounds from behind him as she opens and closes the shears a few times.
“How was your meal?” he asks as they fight the tide of bodies, his voice almost drowned out by the excited chatter.
mother must be about all of this. I mean, she hasn’t heard from you since before all of this got out, Draco. She’s got to be worried sick.”
She breathes out through her nose. “While I think that’s noble, I do think you also need to consider if Healing is something you’d enjoy. The positive moral side effects may seem tempting, but I’d hate for you to lock yourself into something you don’t actually want to do. I understand your position, but you don’t owe the world some big debt. Your being here with me now is enough, in my opinion. You’re already trying to change. And succeeding, I’d say.”
“She’s out there, somewhere. She has to be,” Harry says, because for Leon, he
Harry takes a deep breath and rubs his hands together. “Er, do you two mind if I go in alone?”
The world turns upside down; Harry hits the ground headfirst, Draco falling beside him; a mouthful of metallic water; they don’t know where the spell’s come from, where it’s aimed; the world is lit up green and someone is screaming; there’s a second scream, a sequel to the curse.
He follows Draco’s lead, levitating them out as carefully and quickly as he can, his body finally taking over. His mind shuts down; visions of broken bodies sliding into the darkness will surely return in dreams later, but for now all Harry can do is save as many students as he can.
to be civil. Especially if you’re going to be co-captains.”
, oh please, Harry—you still have me, and Ron, and the Weasleys, and another handful of people. I assure you that nothing you could do would change how we feel.”
Most importantly, I’m so glad you’re feeling better. I can’t even imagine the relief. I risk being a bit self centered when I ask: do you have any idea when you’ll be back? Not that I don’t want you and your family to have all the time you need, but I also miss seeing you. It’s not like we have a whole lot of missed time to make for or anything like that. And I think it bears repeating that I am
“She seems really shaken,” Draco finally says once they’re well out of earshot.
“And why is it that you were present at both incidents today?”
Harry goes red from head to toe. “What do you mean?”
“Nothing! Nothing’s wrong! Are you headed back up to the castle by any chance?”
Once he accepts that all attention is going to be on him all day, he finds that he does rather enjoy it. He can’t remember the last time he was in the spotlight and it wasn’t about being ‘The Boy Who Lived’ or ‘The Chosen One,’ the last time people celebrated him for being just Harry, and nothing more.
“Now!”
Hermione gasps. “You’re serious?”
He shrugs. “Not really. I suppose I’ll try to apologize to Leon, if he’ll let me. And then regardless of what happens there, I’ll have to tell Ron at some point. Beyond that…I don’t know. But that’s true of a lot of things. I’ll figure it out eventually, I guess.”
“If I remember correctly, you’ve had some moments yourself.”
This is why his mind goes blank and he steps forward, steps into the light that is Leon and occupies the space between them that’s been so treacherous and stormy by his own design. His hands find their way to Leon’s waist and he pulls him close and his whole body tingles until their lips meet and then his whole body is on fire, but the burn is soft and Leon’s lips are soft and time itself feels soft.
with one?”
Draco nods and they go through the routine again, crouching as they walk.
“I don’t know, maybe he isn’t working alone. All I know is that I saw him, Harry.”
“Don’t give me that right now. That man is an abomination and a coward, and a real shit excuse for a father if I’ve ever seen one.”
“You mean he’s not—”
Ginny rolls her eyes, grabbing his arm and pulling him into the next room, away from everyone.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he says. He has no idea why he’s being so stubborn about it. Well. Yes he does. Hermione’s inference is
He grins and takes her right hand in his left, thankful they’d been taught to dance before the Yule Ball. Or, more accurately, that Hermione had helped him learn last year when they were on the run. Harry looks to his right and sees her and Ron already slow dancing, both of them wearing soft smiles, fit together like gears.
“Perfect,” Harry says and clinks his glass against hers.
He’s in denial. Harry is in denial, because there must be some part of him that knows Draco is right, but he can’t bring himself to believe it.
“Because I’m Head Boy, I get the top room of the tower to myself.”
The lock around his arm releases and he quickly stows his wand away. For a moment, Harry and Draco stare at each other. Neither says anything more. Then, Draco turns on his heel and takes off down the hallway, pushing through the ranks of observers.
she’s a fifth year), all of whom had either been on the wrong side of the fight or not in it at all. Besides, there wouldn’t be much use for having even one Prefect with only six people total in the bloody House.
as it was.”
was never cruel.”
“Thanks, Harry!” Neville says, beaming as he bounces away.
Draco stops them just outside the doorway; though they have the Cloak, he still feels odd standing in the room. They listen from beside the entrance, up against the wall.
That is, until a month later when they’re standing on Platform Nine and Three Quarters, Ron and Ginny trying to pacify a near hysterical Mrs. Weasley. The Hogwarts Express sits gloriously in front of them, dark smoke billowing upward. Despite all of the bustle, Harry manages to accidentally make eye contact with the very person they’d assumed would not be coming back.
Ron snorts. “Not at my house, you won’t.”
“Agreed. Do you want to join us for dinner?” Harry asks casually, feeling much more relaxed around Leon after this bonding moment.
“Oh,” he says, this time aloud. “Pleasure to meet you.”
Her expression darkness’s further. “Oh, yes. I know. I think he’s being a moron.”
“And that can’t be you because…?”
That’s why Hermione’s reacting so abhorrently. This is partially her doing.
Draco fights the urge to make a snide remark about how he might not
“A few housekeeping notices! At the moment, we are short a Defense professor, but we’re working diligently to procure someone so that you don’t lose precious learning time.”
There’s a moment when everything freezes, when Harry realizes it doesn’t matter, that he’s finally met an end he can’t skirt around. And then, a great wind whips through the Great Hall, a silvery, warm zephyr that ruffles his hair and makes him think of summer. The Dementors scatter and flee, howling as they zip away.
Harry nods. “I actually wanted to talk to you two about that.”
“See you in a bit,” she says, then gestures for her Houses to follow and leads them out of the Great Hall. Draco catches Pansy’s eye as the Slytherins shuffle by, but he can’t quite decipher her expression. He raises his hand in a wave as Blaise wraps an arm around Pansy’s waist and they leave together.
Harry brushes the drop away. “Then I will. Fuck the Wizengamot if they think they’re going to separate us after we’ve finally reached the place we were always supposed to end up.”
Harry smiles and leans down to plant a kiss on the tip of his nose. “Fine. You can be human for now. I suppose that suits my interests better.”
Gods, he’d been the absolute definition of a prick to Harry. Of course he knows how Draco is feeling. It was stupid to deny that, and even stupider to threaten him at wandpoint. With witnesses.
“Draco? What the hell are you doing here?”
“You won’t know that until you’ve tried.”
you,” he says, pointing at Hermione.
Draco pushes his lips into a fine line. “Is it…Would it be to soon to apologize to you?”
Harry swallows. “Sure, why not? We have two Beauxbatons players, and I know he’s friends with Bella.”
“Of course he knows. He was still conscious when it happened, so I explained it to him.”
Blaise turns away from his mirror, where he had been attending to his eyebrows, and faces Draco.
, I mean—Ron and Hermione are going to be a huge part of it. They’re my family, Draco. I know this is a lot of vulnerability to ask from you, but better to start now, right?”
“It’s somehow enchanted to only let me in,” Harry guesses.
He yawns, doing his best not to fall asleep right at the table. As he stretches, he notices Leon sitting at the Gryffindor table. He’s alone, oddly. Draco doesn’t know what to make of it, though it’s far from his business. Still, he’s sure
Harry isn’t sure how to feel. For the first time in his life, he’s fairly sure he already has a date lined up if he musters the courage to ask him. But the ball is only two weeks away, and there’s no way in hell that he’ll be ready to share that part of himself with the world then.
A suit of armor groans as he passes, startling him. He stops moving, just for a second, taking a deep breath.
“Draco, what’s going on?”
A small panic rises in Harry's chest when he notices Leon’s shallow breathing, but he tries to be attentive and let Leon keep going. He touches the shorter boy’s elbow gently, just to let him know he’s listening.
the teaching position. And McGonagall assured me that she would give you an option to turn it down as well.”
seems like a bit of an overshot.”
mean I am in any way thinking about telling
“I think I'm going to go get settled and try to get some sleep. Thank you so much for doing this, Harry. I really look forward to working with you,” Leon says, grasping Harry’s elbow and smiling. Something about the way he says Harry’s voice sends a chill up his spine, and he still wonders if there’s something about Leon that he should be wary of.
(See the end of the chapter for
The rest of practice goes well. Eerily well. In just a few minutes, the three Chasers are already playing well off each other and communicating, even despite the language barrier. Christie blocks an impressive percentage of shots on the goals, and the Beaters succeed in throwing the Chasers off their paths a few times each. For their first time flying as a team, Harry is impressed.
Draco finds himself at the Hospital Wing, finally, unscathed but on edge. He pushes the doors open and is immediately met with Madam Pomfrey’s voice.
“But…” Harry says, his mouth ahead of his mind.
“I can think of several things.”
“Likewise! Please, come in,” she says and opens the door wider. “I hope you don’t mind beanbag chairs. The desks that are in here are so uncomfortable and not really conducive to counseling. And my conjuring magic is a bit rusty since I left school, so beanbags are really all I can do.”
Hermione shrugs. “It felt warranted.”
Draco smiles and brings his own hand to meet the gesture. “Just thinking.”
She shrugs, an odd gesture coming from McGonagall. “We couldn’t have, but they don’t care about that.”
“Excuse me, I have an update!” she barks. Talking ceases. “The student has been found. She is in need of medical attention but will be fine once she is tended to.” She pauses. “No attacker was located, but we will continue looking for the time being. I apologize for disrupting your afternoon. I hope you’re still able to enjoy your time in Hogsmeade.”
Draco pictures himself perched over a hot cauldron, sweaty and tired but on the verge of something big. A new discovery that will make an important change. He pictures his mother, able to retire from the world in peace. His father, behind bars. Draco, sitting in the grass outside in the springtime, surrounded by new friends and not abhorred by every passerby. A partner. A…boyfriend? He sees himself kissing somebody, and his skin is a rich tan and his hair is dark and his eyes are green and his lips are against Draco’s and—
“You and Harry Potter…I never thought I’d see the day.”
“With all due respect, I was about to apologize to my professors for missing class today.”
“They weren’t for us. They were for, er…Draco Malfoy.”
A silence then hangs between them, the space suddenly full of their shared thoughts. The room haunted by change. Faces flash past in Harry’s mind, their vacant eyes making his heart seize up. Images he can’t blink away, ones that are burned into the folds of his brain, ones that still cause him to wake up drenched in sweat, unable to breathe.
He emerges from his sun-soaked reverie as Ron and Hermione come into the courtyard, hand-in-hand, looking tired but no worse for wear. Harry grins as they approach, an odd nostalgia pinging around in his chest cavity. This may be the last time they see each other like this, as Hogwarts students. Regardless of the hell they’ve been through, Hogwarts was undeniably the first place that ever felt like his home.
Before his question is finished, the door flies open. Professor Sprout stands there, out of breath and wild-eyed.
He shrugs. “People were already gossiping about it, so there was no point hiding it. I think it makes me more approachable for them to see that even I fuck up sometimes. Sorry,
She rolls her eyes. “Again, I wasn’t really injured. Just frightened. I’ve been through worse, if you’ll believe it.”
Rowan grins and strokes Leon’s cheek. “We had his sister. When we returned her, we Imperiused the entire Laurent family. Don’t worry, she really is safe now, if unaware of what’s going on. And Leon has been an absolute treasure. But you know that already.”
“And his flight?”
feels like a strong word, but I did make a suggestion to her.”
dragged her away, and now all I hear when I try to sleep is the sound of her crying and screaming for me to save her, and I just couldn’t
Truthfully, Draco thinks it’s a terrible idea to delay the discussion, but he needs time to concoct a way to have Leon distracted or else it will all be for nothing.
Hermione purses her lips, then shakes his hand. “If you’re lying, I will make it so your hair disappears completely. Bald forever. Can you make
Draco nods, but says nothing.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “Sounds right to me. Does that mean you’ll put me on the list?”
“Oh,” Draco says and does another sweep of the room. “
“You suck,” she says after a silence. “You understand that, right?”
“With all due respect…You’re not just doing this because I—”
“I don’t think I understand what you’re trying to say.”
Both Leon and the man laugh together, a dissonant harmony of height and gravel that rakes across Harry’s skin. They’ve reached the bottom of the stairs—the man walks with a cane, his right leg not bending as he moves. “I’m Potter’s replacement, of course. A brand new Savior, if you will.”
“Oh,” Harry says, a little noise of realization, “I can bring my Invisibility Cloak. Just in case we have to make our way up to the seventh floor.”
He’s pushing it down, covering it up, because letting it out means unleashing something so new, something so unknown, that he can’t even conceive of it.
Unsure what else to do, Harry pulls Leon into his body, his forehead resting on Harry’s shoulder.
“Fantastic! Let’s hear it, then.”
“You’re going around being civil to Potty and friends now?”
“You can say that again,” Ron grumbles.
“You see, therapy isn’t a cookie-cutter experience. Yes, we’ve all been through a collective trauma, but it affects people in such different ways that there’s no
things, just to survive the nightmare. I had to sacrifice parts of who I was to stay alive, and I still don’t really know how to deal with that. I feel like a completely different me after everything. But what you said at the beginning, about how it felt right at the time and so it must have been right… Leon, you did everything you could to try to save her. What you did made a difference, whether or not you feel like it did. Losing someone is hard. And losing two people at the same time like that is impossible. You can’t put all of the blame on yourself, it’s just going to keep breaking you down like this.”
Joetta is in hysterics in the Ravenclaw Common Room when Draco enters. A few sympathetic Ravenclaw girls and one boy as well are sitting around her, trying to calm her down. Others are not as willing to accommodate her grief and are shooting her dirty looks.
“I can’t believe this. How could we have forgotten?”
first?”
Hermione nods. “A bit immature, and very disrespectful. But he’s upset with you because you’ve blown him off entirely and made him feel like he’s done something wrong.”
“We did say after your Defense lesson, no?”
Harry shakes his head. There’s a fluttering, trembling feeling growing in his chest, in his gut. “What’s if it’s…”
“A good question,” he says. His eyes close and he slaps his hands over them.
Leon pulls away again. Just enough that Harry can still feel his breath on his skin, warm, nude. Eyes meet eyes and gold meets green. There’s an odd tint of pleasant surprise in Leon’s expression.
“I understand that the world is confusing right now. I still wake up unsure of how to move forward sometimes. But the fact of the matter is that time waits for nobody, and it will keep marching forward whether or not we come with it. If you ever need to talk about anything—”
“Yeah, thanks,” Harry says as he picks up his broom and starts walking.
“Draco, you’re eighteen years old. You just survived what will hopefully be the most traumatic experience of your lifetime. If I were you, actively aiding in dragging that out would be the last thing on my laundry list.”
His breath hitches as Leon reaches for the bottom of his shirt, fingers curling around fabric and dragging it upward. It feels like it’s happening in slow motion, or maybe Leon is just going slowly, but his eyes never leave Leon’s body. Harry’s chest expands and warms; Leon’s arms are over his head, exposing his underarms, his chest, which is adorned with a patch of hair that’s the color of cornsilk and looks twice as soft.
Hermione hums, face scrunched in thought. “I hadn’t really considered it. I feel like whatever the reason, we should know already, right? On account of Fleur being part of the family now,” Hermione explains in response to Ron’s confused look.
“Don’t sound so surprised!”
Harry nods, noticing how Leon’s accent is more prominent as he pronounces the name of his school.
There’s a flash of light. Ron’s wand remains in his hand.
Harry (because Draco had been reading their lips, but he had no real need to; the evidence was clear on both of their faces, in their eyes, in the way Draco’s heart spasmed and then froze over entirely as he watched it all play out). And yet, it’s the only possible explanation that Draco sees. After he’d seen Leon sneak into the dungeons moments before a girl was attacked, Draco knows he’s capable of more than Harry would let himself believe.
Draco blinks at him. “No?”
“I—Do you have some kind of problem with me?”
Draco looks at Harry and something bursts inside him. It’s warm, a spell going off in his abdomen. Whatever happens next, this moment is perfect. Eternal. He reaches over and cups Harry’s jaw in his hand, running a tentative thumb along the stubble there. Harry takes Draco’s hand delicately and presses it to his lips, soft and plump. He’s never felt more in his body, never felt less like himself. That’s what Harry does to him; he makes Draco feel like there’s an entirely different person inside him waiting to break free.
He stands. “I think you will,” he says, managing a small grin. He crosses to the door, reaching for the handle when she speaks again.
McGonagall nods in the pause that follows and presses her lips into a line. “First of all, I want to make it very clear to you that if you
“I don’t know,” Harry says with a shrug. “I wasn’t sure how you would take this news.”
“So, Draco Malfoy,” he says, impressed. He takes a bite out of an apple and Harry chuckles, ducks his head.
“And what about you, then?” he asks, his tone gentle now.
“Do you mean Dumbledore’s Army? But that was just a silly little club—”
“Leon, I’m so sorry,” Harry says, his voice just above a whisper.
Draco accepts the band and she sits back, crossing her arms. He looks down at the table between them and cautiously raises it to his head. He’s not worried so much about what people might think if they see his hair styled that way. Everybody already hates him enough, after all. It’s just…He’s seen plenty of girls put their hair up, but now when tasked with it himself, he’s unsure of the actual mechanics.
She looks up again. “Sure, sit, why not?”
Harry laughs, and the surprise of it brings him back to himself. “We are. Does nobody else know how important this moment is, though?”
“Are you okay?” Hermione asks.
runs in Draco’s veins.
“Now, this.” Harry’s whole body goes into overdrive as Leon steps inward. His heart threatens to explode when the blond has to stand up on his toes to get close. The mechanics of the kiss come so naturally: Harry’s hand gently lifting Leon’s soft jaw, the other resting on the side of his cheek. It’s yet another kind of kiss, not like the intense, emotionally charged ones from before. It’s sweet and chaste and it makes Harry’s stomach do a flip.
“Bloody hell, I’m sorry you had to see that. I reckon she’s been drinking on account of the welcome back feast and all.”
Blaise sighs. “You do get used to it, eventually,” he says to the three strangers, sounding bored as he returns to his book.
hard.”
“Thank you,” Harry says and lifts his chin in an attempt to look dignified. Then, he sighs. “Are you sure you’ll be okay here? I’ll be back as soon as I can be with groceries and a phone.”
And then he almost trips over his own robe when he sees Draco Malfoy standing next to one of the enchanted trees on the side of the stage. He looks bored—upset, even—and when Harry looks closer he sees that, next to his Prefect badge, Draco has one of the little shields that McGonagall handed out to the security task force. It makes enough sense, he supposes, Draco being Prefect and all. And it strikes Harry as unlikely that Draco would’ve asked anybody else, makes something in him leap and hit the ground hard on the way down.
Her voice carries as she’s led to somewhere where she can be calmed down, and after a minute passes McGonagall returns with a man and a woman wearing Ministry robes. She talks to them in a low voice, efficient and bordering on panicked. The two investigators draw their wands and rush into the dungeons. The headmistress crosses her arms and purses her lips. With one final unsure look in Draco’s direction, she turns and leaves.
Michael narrows his eyes. “Do you really think McGonagall—or any professor in their right mind—would allow the school to reopen if there were any real danger to us?”
Draco’s heart is going absolutely ballistic in his chest. He takes Harry’s hand from his face and moves it to his chest.
Draco stands, not taking his eyes off Slughorn. “Thank you,” he says curtly. “I’ll be sure to ask ahead next time.”
Ron frowns. “Involved with what?”
is going on there.”
“Right, yes, we did. But that’s extremely gracious of you. Almost too much so. And I just worry that you’re avoiding things instead of actually moving past them.”
“Stop. I don’t care what you have to say right now. I have good news.”
Blaise’s eyebrows both jump upward but return to their resting position. Draco pauses and Blaise offers a sideways glance as a request for Draco to continue. He clears his throat and looks around, making sure nobody is actively eavesdropping. “The problem is, I’m not fully sure if he’s…you know…”
“My gods,” Harry murmurs.
, three times when it wouldn’t be.” There are some groans at that, as it’s a more difficult question. But he needs to send the message that even if it felt fun and exciting, this is still a class. What happens within these walls matters.
Draco nods. “You’re my teacher now, remember?”
,” Harry and Hermione exasperate simultaneously.
to apologize to, and at the bottom of the ones he’s ready to.
“Oh, let’s not pretend the results are going to be anything less.”
“You’re not convinced,” Draco says, unable to stop a slight smile. He understands, because he’s not quite convinced of it himself. His optimism might be slightly deluded.
Not sure he’ll be able to handle any more drama for the rest of the year (or the rest of his life), Draco squeezes his eyes shut, lets a deep breath fill his lungs, and crosses the room to open the door.
“You’re making an effort. You used my first name, for God’s sake. The least I can do is hear you out.”
“Not very long, I think. Since before I was born, but not by much.”
Harry’s cheeks go rosy in the golden light. “I suppose I do.”
“It’s too late,” Harry says solemnly. “When I look at you, all I can see is tentacles and sharp teeth.”
would be back. And even though you fell off the face of the world this summer, I was just so relieved to see you on the train. But you were different. It wasn’t the same you.”
“Fine. Facing it head on. I’m not scared, Hermione, I’m…
Slughorn nods, patting his stomach and looking around. “Were you looking for advice then, or—”
there I would absolutely love that :) While I am focused a lot on another fandom currently (those of you who are subbed to me will have seen the onslaught of Love, Victor content I've been posting LMAO) I'm still vaguely an HP blog and also just love to talk about writing and such so. IDK could be fun see y'all there hopefully!! <333
When he opens up, a door has appeared in the wall. With a final glance at this friends, Harry pulls it open and steps inside.
This talk we’re going to have has me both nervous and excited. That’s how you make me feel overall. I’m not really good with words, even when I have the chance to sit down and think and write them out. I guess you’ve probably got that figured out by now. But I want to try to be better for you.
“Blimey, you two didn’t—”
and how he makes Harry smile and roll his eyes and how he’s never felt this way about anybody. But Leon and Harry need to talk first. He doesn’t want to reveal anything that Leon doesn’t want revealed, so he decides that until they can discuss some of the logistics, it’s between him and Leon. And Luna.
He knows she has a point. But it feels less to him like he’s suppressing his feelings and more like he has more important things going on to worry about the mess that his father is making. It’s not worth his time.
blood magic?” Draco asks, appalled.
“Oh? Really? Since when?”
The house seems to agree. He goes to grab the first picture and finds it stuck hard to mantle, but the same tingle of warmth then spreads through his hand and he finds he can pick it up normally. He lays his hands on the other frames, one by one, cradling them as he makes his way back outside.
“You heard from him?”
McGonagall had said, almost like she knew what was going to happen, what
“Oh, is that treacle tart?” he asks as he sits. He gives Leon a playful jab with his elbow and scoops a large piece onto his place.
“I want to take you to the Autumn Ball.”
“You really expect me to believe that you care at all about what I’m reading?”
As he turns back toward his friends, he feels an odd sense of melancholy, even after coming out of the tryouts so victorious. Perhaps it’s residual from his conversation with Ginny.
“Um.”
“You’re worried something might happen to someone here, too?”
Seconds pass, and minutes, and the distant sound of running water plays harmony to Harry’s shaking breaths and his whimpers that are indifferent to dignity. His throat is raw and his body feels dry,
He can’t deny that. Simplicity isn’t really his
“Probably had loftier expectations?”
“We were talking about Hogwarts,” Harry says, rescuing her. “About whether or not it would reopen this term.”
Draco now realizes with a start that the boy is one of the few remaining Slytherins. He remembers him from the train; he’d been so scared. David is his name, Draco thinks. And he has an older sister, too, also a Slytherin.
She leaves Harry alone on the couch, looking into the crackling fire and grateful that for once, all the pieces seem to be falling into place (some with a bit of jiggling and persuasion, but nonetheless). Later, Leon will come back and they’ll spend some time alone in one of their rooms, and Harry knows that for a moment everything else will be irrelevant.
Harry scratches his head. “Don’t really know what you mean. You would go to the ball and for all intents and purposes, Leon would be your date. Same goes for myself and Luna. After that, no expectations at all.”
Blaise snorts. “Isn’t that, like, the second-most important topic for Potions?”
Potter looks back up at him, bewildered. “I honestly can’t believe this. Did the castle squeeze your head too?” Draco catches him look at his own hand, and he can see that he does, in fact, have a matching scar.
One last sucker punch of panic hits Harry in the gut.
A sound like a trillion stones grinding sends a shockwave through the air, and the castle starts to shake again. Harry knows they should run but he can’t make his legs work. He gets as low to the ground as possible as it quakes, the water rippling. Then, it starts to pull, the second phase of a wave on the beach, sucking sand particles out into the depths. On his hands and knees Harry isn’t nearly submerged enough to be dragged across the floor as the water flows backward, but he still has to fight the reverse current, feet slipping as he almost falls again. Once he has his balance, he lunges out for prone bodies as they drift by, his shoulders and back straining from the effort.
“So you’re suddenly in the business of listening to Draco Malfoy’s ideas?”
“I’m…fine…for now…” Draco says between breaths. He forces himself to slow down and takes a few long, deep breaths and feels his pulse evening out some. “Now, before I explain, please,
The air is thick with silence again. Harry can see the worry in Ron’s eyes.
“My Patronus essentially just confirmed the suspicions that people have about me. That I’m a snake. Of course I’m not alright. I thought I was, and I thought that I was handling the news about my father fine, and I thought people were already getting over it. But this…it’s just going to unearth all of those feelings again.”
A brief silence, followed by a wave of hushed murmuring.
And then, because his life is apparently a joke, the door to the Hospital Wing bursts open and Leon rushes in. “I just heard. Where is he?”
“Alright everybody, watch closely. The most effective way to use this spell is to add a sharp flick along with the incantation. Ready, Ron? 3, 2—“
“Has…Has Harry not told you about that?”
“Well, that’s settled, then!” George cuts in impatiently. “Now can we fly already?”
“Hey! That’s French!”
, he thinks, trying to give Ron a reassuring look. But he knows exactly what’s going through his best friend’s head. He’s either going to have to play against Harry, or, even worse, he’s been cut.
“Then why, Draco?”
Now it really feels as if he shouldn’t be listening in on the conversation. On the other hand, he’d almost just died due to some mysterious force, so he feels a bit like he’s owed an explanation.
“But nothing I’ve shared is this serious.”
“How recently?”
“Our Slytherins,” McGonagall continues, directing her speech toward their table, “will be spending some time in Ravenclaw Tower, as the dungeons are currently in disarray and are not suitable for living. I assure that things will be sorted out soon, but in the meantime I’m sure we can all learn to get along.
recently. It didn’t have anything to do with you, honestly.”
Draco snorts. “I don’t want to consider that, and I don’t think
“What the hell?” Draco mutters and Harry feels like he’s falling through the floor, his inner world caving in on itself as the castle does the same.
He doesn’t buy it for a second, but it sounds nice on paper.
Harry’s soul nearly separates from his body when a pleasant voice suddenly comes from behind him, wrenching him out of his thoughts.
“Luna, er, if you don’t mind my asking, how did you convince her to come?”
He doesn’t respond because it’s quite the contrary; he’s trying to find the words to thank them for thinking of this.
“I suppose it is.”
, I don’t know. The point is, I need you to stop trying to swoop in and make things better, because I won’t heal until I’m out of the heat.”
“So about that Quidditch practice tomorrow…”
Harry’s hands ball into tight, quivering fists. “I don’t need you to take care of me, Draco. You don’t know me. You don’t know what I need.”
And then Harry’s next to him, feeling breathy, wanting to reach out and touch, to kiss. He should say something.
“The attacks,” Draco says. He wishes he could look away from Harry as he says it, but their eyes are locked. “McGonagall told me just now that they’re not random. They’re targeted, the castle is being controlled.”
“No,” Draco says, trying to keep his tone neutral but relishing in the fact that he’s here and Leon isn’t.
“From what your headmistress has told me, my position is very similar to yours. I'm in charge of making sure relations between our two magical bodies are going smoothly while we're here, as well as acting as a sort of authority figure for the younger students. We never really had a position like it until now.”
Harry raises an eyebrow and laughs through his nose. “Okay, then. Well, good job today, anyway.”
doesn’t know. She just showed up this morning at dawn, like the sun left her as a gift for us. My parents don’t even know what to do with themselves.”
He frowns. “Who says I’m afraid?”
“And you’re
So it’s with surprise that Draco approaches his proxy common room, the door hanging open. He frowns, creeping toward it. It seems that things are normal inside; a few students are gathered around a table, already hard at work on something
SO. I've noticed that there has been some slight contention in my comments about things in this fic, like people actually acknowledging Draco's misdoings, or characters not caring enough about them. If I'm honest, I haven't read a lot of Drarry fic myself, believe it or not, so I was not aware of the expected dynamics, and even if I was it seems like people are really split on how Draco's character should be handled. I risk sounding a bit rude when I say: if you don't like how I'm writing Draco's arc post-war, maybe choose a different fic! While I appreciate some people reading along even despite disagreeing with the way I'm developing certain things, it seems like my inbox has been littered with negative comments about how other characters interact with Draco, and people are also arguing which is?? Not something I have ever experienced before on one of my fics lol. It's not a problem by any means, but I'm not trying to start any fan wars here!!
“I’m accepting your request. I’d like to attend the ball as part of the task force.”
There’s Harry. And there’s Leon, pulling away from a hug.
“Brilliant,” Harry says, triumph cresting in his chest. “Would the two of you mind meeting me in the Gryffindor common room later? After dinner?”
Using the word
And the strangest part? Draco finds he'd truly meant it.
“It pains me to do so, but as I’m sure you’ve all noticed, not every House is fully capable of shouldering the competition.”
“Must have been the adrenaline,” Draco says.
—it will be for real and for good and I’m not ready for that to happen. Nobody is.”
“No, not at all,” Malfoy says. “I was just leaving.” He turns on his heel and rushes out of the room, pushing past Leon in the doorway.
“As in, romantically,” Harry clarifies. He realizes his hands are shaking, and his skin is practically crawling.
“Hermione had the same reaction. I don’t blame you. You don’t have to believe me right now, but the least you can do is
know how.
“Again, not what I meant, but good to hear it.”
Harry can’t meet his eyes. “The kiss. Kisses. I suppose.” His voice is a little high, breathy.
“Well done,” says Hermione.
“Draco? Is everything alright?”
“Well that’s the question, innit?”
A gust of wind comes in through the window and Leon visibly shivers. Harry frowns. “Come here,” he says, gesturing for Leon to scoot closer. Leon rolls over so he’s facing away from Harry, then tucks himself up under Harry’s arm.
Harry frowns, not quite understanding the relevance. But Hermione lets out a high-pitched gasp and brings her hands to her mouth. “No,” she chokes out.
Hi! Sorry it's been so long between updates! Explanation and also some meta commentary on this chapter in the end notes if you care to read about the writing process and my thoughts and things of that nature. And if not please feel free to leave a comment or kudos!! That always makes me feel real good :) <3
“See for yourself,” Blaise says. “Something that public and of that magnitude is much harder to hide.” He sounds resigned, even afraid as he sits down on the edge of his own bed.
“Oh, there will be tea.”
“Shhh,” Harry insists. “Listen.” He breathes in slowly, audibly, and releases. He repeats this until Leon starts to follow his lead, the gasping stopping, replaced by deep, shaky breaths. They stay there for a moment, Leon’s eyes squeezed shut, still dripping tears on Harry’s shirt. Without moving, he finishes his story.
Harry and Ginny glance at each other and try not to burst into laughter.
There’s that word again. Sorry.
Draco groans. “Don’t remind me. I was considering locking myself in here for the foreseeable future.”
“That’s fine. I’m fine, you see that now!”
“I could…go with you. If you want.” Harry wants to smack himself as soon as he says it.
“So I noticed,” Draco says. For some reason, Pansy’s reaction has had a sort of instant reversing effect on him. Maybe it’s because he’s tired of her attitude and simply wants to contradict her whenever possible, but he finds himself with the odd desire to
letter, it’s just…”
Harry can’t help but laugh. “Happy to oblige, Madam Hooch. Er, I actually was wondering about something. Ron—”
“What. The fuck. Are you doing?” she repeats. “You’ve never been the most emotionally adept boy, but asking Luna to the ball
“Sure. Great.” Three feet of space between them. Harry could simply lift his arm and make contact, but his body is frozen over. He’s a glacier, terrified that if he starts to move, he won’t be able to stop. So Leon does the moving for him. Slow, cautious movements, and Harry both appreciates them and wishes Leon didn’t have to treat him like a cornered animal.
Before he can continue, Leon begins to retch, curls in on himself. Harry can’t tell if his eyes are deceiving him but it looks like his flesh is melting away, he’s shrinking, he’s—
A similar racket breaks out as the other half of the room utters their incantations. Harry ducks as a wand twirls over his head. “Sorry!” comes Neville’s voice from somewhere in the middle of the room. Once the noise dies down, Harry assesses the damage. Not one person was unable to disarm their opponent.
“Y-your hand. What happened?”
The look Leon gives him is something like pity, something like wonder. “Harry, you’re not the kind of person people
The words come so easily to Harry, Draco wonders if he’s questioned Draco’s intentions and his sanity all along.
“I’ll thank you to keep the noise to a minimum while I explain as things are so different this time around. Now, some other housekeeping things. The tournament itself will be constrained to just this term and will conclude by the winter holidays. I know that it’s usually a year-round event, but as we are still unsure of how long Beauxbatons’ stay will be, it seems safest to keep things shorter so they’ll be much more likely to finish things out.
“Excuse me, do any of you know what’s going on with, er—” He gestures to the open door, wondering if he’s missed some kind of memo.
That thought runs on repeat through Harry’s head as the scene plays out, an enormous crater in the center of the Great Hall, widening, sending massive chunks of floor into the abyss, swallowing tables. Swallowing
Draco barks out a single laugh, incredulous, but allows Harry to continue.
Harry looks at him for one second, and another, and then his face melts into something that all but shatters Draco’s heart.
Hermione sighs. “I’m sorry. I wasn’t trying to make you think—”
His face flushes completely when Harry grabs both of Draco’s arms and pins them to the wall above his head. The position makes him feel so exposed; Harry somehow manages to get even closer, slipping one leg between Draco’s, the other flush against the wall. Draco’s sleeves have fallen and Harry must realize that this is new, unkissed skin because he changes course, lips brushing up and down Draco’s arms. This doesn’t feel nearly as good as wanton breath against his neck, but there’s something surprisingly intimate about the way Harry takes his time, up the right arm, over to the left—
He opts not to answer, which is enough for her. Her face grows even angrier. “What fucking game are you playing, Draco? I don’t know how to crack you anymore.”
he had seen. But after refusing her suggestion to have some kind of Ministry official accompany him to classes, the last thing he needed was to give her a reason to turn her suggestion into an order.
“I was so worried,” Harry said. “Do you know what happened?”
“Would you stop being so thick?”
“Then we have Fabien Arquette from Beauxbatons as Keeper, Ritchie Coote—Gryffindor—and Michael Robertson—Hufflepuff—as Beaters, and that leaves Kim Lassiter—Ravenclaw—and Xander Matthews—Hufflepuff—and finally Eloise Tremblay, also from Beauxbatons, as the three Chasers. Give them a hand, everyone!”
Leon is already standing next to the doors, smiling gently.
Now Harry is looking directly down at Leon, who returns the gaze.
“All right. Here goes, then.”
Harry and Ron exchange a look, half amused and half nervous, as they move to separate quadrants. Harry almost yelps as Madam Hooch suddenly pulls him aside.
Blaise gives a short huff of laughter and Draco rolls his eyes.
People shuffle around until pairs are formed. Draco is, unsurprisingly, alone.
and subsequent cries of amusement or protest as wands fly through the air. Harry smirks when Hermione skillfully catches Ron’s wand, giving Harry a big grin. Ron huffs, holding out his hand to request his wand back.
“To new beginnings?” Draco proposes.
“The time flow?”
“Harry’s right. I’ve been feeling a bit restless myself lately. After all those years leading up to our seventh, we’re suddenly sort of just...stuck.”
“Biscuit?” she says as she places the tray between them.
“Oh, bollocks, I’m sorry,” Harry says. “I wasn’t even thinking. We’re not exactly just two lads changing clothes anymore,” he says with an ironic twang.
By the time everything is on the table (except for the biscuits, those are gone), evening has fallen and the fire has nearly gone out. Draco’s mother nods when Draco has finished, then stands and adds more logs into the hearth and returns to her seat.
Leon shrugs. “I haven’t heard anything, but they’re known for practicing a lot of dark magic, so I assume they were safe in all of this.”
“Hello, Draco. Miss me?”
a witch, am I not?”
“Everything’s fine,” he lies. “I just want to get away from here for now.” He releases Leon, who in turn alters his step so he’s walking closer to Harry, their fingers brushing as they stride into a lovely afternoon.
Alright friends, just figured I would provide some fun news about my life. While I am sad that I haven't had time to write fic for a while, there are other fun things going on that I just want to gush about to whoever will listen :) First of all, I only have one more semester of undergrad, which is crazy. My senior thesis is also halfway done, which means this semester I wrote (nearly) HALF of my first ever novel, on top of taking four other classes!!! Very proud of myself for that. The first draft of the novel is a disaster but I'm writing it and for that reason I am still excited and happy.
“You’re right,” Harry says and dries his eyes. He shakes his head like he’s a dog and clenches his fists once, pulling himself together. The tension in Draco’s body flows away, the tide shifting. “I do think some time apart might be beneficial,” Harry concedes, “but not too much.”
“Well, something she brought up was how worried
Draco turns toward the crowd; Luna follows him to the tide’s edge. He clears his throat. “We’ll be escorting you back to your dormitories, just to ensure that everybody arrives safely. Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs with me, Slytherins and Ravenclaws with Luna. All Beauxbatons students will join whichever House they’re staying with. Let’s do this calmly but quickly, and once you’re in your common rooms, please stay there for the rest of the night.” Draco looks to Luna, who gives him a slight smile and a nod.
“May I?” Harry asks, gesturing to the bed.
Harry pulls away but keeps his arms on Draco’s shoulders, taking in the sight before him. Both are wrapped up in themselves, legs tucked underneath their bodies and knees against knees. For a split second Draco avoids his gaze. His face is wet and his eyes are red, and Harry can’t comprehend.
Harry turns to the blank wall, sweat bleeding up into his palms. He crams his eyes shut;
“Have you been outside the room yet today?” Draco asks, his armpits uncomfortably moist. He shoves himself out of bed and opens a window, morning autumn air like cold pellets as it hits fat beads of sweat on his face.
“Oh yeah, and who’s that?”
He rolls his eyes. His classic stank face suddenly feels appealing.
Draco realizes he’s been holding his breath, so he lets it out slowly. “Potter, that’s extremely generous of you. I…I know I don’t deserve—”
“What was the adrenaline?”
Draco is quiet for a second and Harry eyes him sideways, afraid he’d taken the joking too far too soon. Then Draco smiles.
about asking Harry to the ball?”
Harry nods. “Yes,” he says to eliminate any doubt.
Maybe it’s sane to revisit the idea of asking Harry to the ball.
This is a
Draco gapes at her. “I’m in shock.”
Draco takes a moment to process their conversation, their
“He seems rather stressed for someone receiving so much special treatment,” Blaise remarks, serving himself some sausages.
“Very clever, little Draco.”
“Good,” Leon says, standing up. “I’m sorry for being so direct with you. My mother always tells me it’s my best and worst quality.”
“Could you just shut up and get the ball so we can start? You’ve forgotten it,” Harry snaps, not wanting to spend any more time on the subject. He mellows out his voice as he continues. “It’s my birthday, remember?”
A weird sort of tightness is developing in Draco’s chest. These words are really coming from someone his age, someone who has been thrown headfirst into the world with no place to land. While he’s never noticed Harry to be particularly bookish, he can see now that there’s an indisputable wisdom built on experience. It’s what makes him unique. Sure, you could sit around for years and study for hours on end and read book after book, and that would give you a pretty good grasp on a variety of things.
Too late; his hair is down. Though he keeps it meticulously clean, it still hangs drably around his face and nearly down to his shoulders. Draco sighs. “Can you at least show me how to put it up the way you did that first time?”
“There it is.”
“Right, because I only have a week to find a date and there’s no way I could.”
“Thank you, Blaise. I appreciate that.”
“If you’d like, I can ask someone from the Ministry to escort you between classes.”
Harry directs them toward the violent tree and finds himself alone with Eva. They exchange a look and then proceed into the castle.
Stalking.
They’re near the edge of the Forbidden Forest, completely alone. Harry places his hand on Leon’s back, gently guiding him to kneel in the cool grass. Tears stream down Leon's face but the only noise he makes are desperate gulps for air.
And with that, Luna is gone. Harry exhales deeply, trying to force all of the jitters out his body through his nostrils. There, now someone knows. Nobody else has to be the very first to hear. Granted, Luna had made things rather easy for him. He’ll have to talk to Leon when he gets back about telling people.
“You care about him more than I thought,” McGonagall says. Something gleams in her eye.
Draco’s face is warm; he’s sure his pale cheeks are flushed pink. “Do you think it’s a good idea?”
know, welcome back.” She flashes a few smiles at familiar faces and tosses a quick wink in Harry’s direction. He grins back. “I’m sure you’ve already read the rules and guidelines when it comes to the forming of teams. I’ve been informed that they were a bit vague, so to clarify: each team will consist of players from
A new anxiety is rolling in. Had they not been at all subtle? Does everyone know? Are they all in the common room now, whispering about Harry Potter, the Poof Who Lived?
He nods, stunned. “I understand, but I…also don’t.” As far as Draco can tell, McGonagall is probably one of the only people at Hogwarts who knows the full extent of his involvement with the Dark Lord during the war. And yet, here she is, taking his side.
to happen, but I need you to stop following me around like this. We have to work together, but that’s it, alright? I’m sorry that I somehow made you think otherwise, but that was
“I know,” Draco says and crunches into a slice of buttered toast. “I’ll keep thinking. If we’re lucky, we can find a way to clear this up soon.”
“They belong to me, don't they?” he asks, trying to fight the redness rising in his face.
“Nothing definite,” Harry ventures. “Obviously
There’s a pause in which he’s certain he’s going to start crying, but the tears never come, like his body’s awake but his emotions are dormant.
“Who said anything about tea?”
you’re talking about, is it?”
Harry shrugs. “Like I said, I’m quite confused about the whole ordeal. It is true that I still don’t know him all that well, honestly, even despite the fact that he bore the deepest part of his soul to me.”
She looks taken aback, but after a moment she also smiles. She stands, brushes the hair out of his face and kisses his forehead. Narcissa Malfoy had never been an affectionate woman, but Draco can see how the war changed her. That, and her husband…well…He’s already in enough pain. No point in going into that right now.
“And Aurors won’t be able to figure out a way to do that?”
His office is rather cluttered, books and potion supplies strewn about. Slughorn waves a hand and a collection of empty (but dirty) bottles vacate the chair across from his desk, which Draco then takes. Slughorn squashes down into his own chair; the man actually looks relatively thin. Tired.
He feels insane even
Something heavy and cold falls into the pit of his stomach. There are so many things swirling around in his head. Is it really possible that he could’ve just pursued this and not feared backlash? Has he been an absolute and utter idiot and ruined his chances with Leon for good? And is it possible that he might be able to make it up to him? If so, what then?
, to save my life? I don’t get it.”
“I don’t…I don’t understand.”
,” Leon spits. Draco almost gasps at the hatred in the voice, can’t possibly reconcile the hatred with the eyes he’s always making at Harry. “Yes, he’ll come. And then the final phase will be set in motion.”
They look at each other for a moment. Harry licks his lips. Their legs tangle at the other end of the bed and something squeezes in Draco’s chest.
Harry considers inquiring about the story to change the subject, but hearing about that might be even more emotionally taxing. “Oh, Luna, I’m so sorry that you haven’t been included in things. With your being Head Girl and all. Though it was never really business, or anything like that.”
A second passes, then all eyes snap somewhere else. Anywhere else. The room is dead silent save for the legs of desks scraping across stones.
It makes sense, he supposes. But it only raises more questions. If it really is Leon, how could Mari have been attacked? Leon has been in Hogsmeade with Harry all day, or so Draco assumes. And then the thought of that is almost as nauseating as the image of Mari’s mutilated skin after freeing her from the wall. Draco can’t stop thinking about it.
His mother looks between them, exasperated, then jumps up rather suddenly. “If we’re going to have a long chat, we’re going to need tea. Tea?” she asks, gesturing between them.
“No, I understand. I want that, Draco. I really do. I’m going to need some time, I think.”
The truth is, Draco doesn’t have much of an idea about how to captain a Quidditch team. It’s a bit of a harsh reality check, really; in years past he always just knew it would eventually be him leading Slytherin. Now he wonders just how he planned to do that. Fear? Threats? A strategic veil that would prevent his players from seeing how under-qualified he was.
Conveniently, Hermione emerges from the throng. “Oh! Hello, you two. Have you heard about the Autumn Ball?”
what it’s like to love, and he wouldn’t dare say it, not yet, but it’s like he’s stumbled upon a pearl he didn’t even know he’d been looking for.
He brushes a platinum strand out of his face and grins. “Any idea where I might get a decent haircut?”
Now, Harry actually laughs, a dry, bark of a laugh that sends a shiver down Draco’s spine. “Go ahead. This crazy vendetta of a conspiracy theory is only going to land you a permanent bed at St. Mungo’s.”
In addition to all of that, I just finished the process of applying to GRAD SCHOOLS to pursue an MFA in CREATIVE WRITING. AH. LIKE, THIS IS REALLY WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE AND I'M SO HAPPY :,) I think I owe my readers here a big thanks, because my involvement in the fic community is really one of the things that has encouraged me the most and has allowed me to grow so much as a writer. So if you're reading this, thank you for allowing me to do what I love and have so much fuckin fun doing it.
Harry blushes, the panic of the situation disappearing for a moment. His mouth twitches into a smile. “Yeah,” he says.
They dart down the hallway in tandem, wands out as the structural integrity of the castle comes into question. Little chunks of rock cascade down from the walls around them, the horrible sound of stone grinding against stone filling the air. As they approach their destination the volume increases; it sounds like a cave collapsing and as the floors wobble, Draco wonders if they’re going to make it to the Great Hall alive.
Molly hums. “I think it might be best for you to find a way to contact her. As soon as you possibly can. She’s probably beside herself with worry.”
Harry blinks back. “Er…yes? Did you expect we would just sit here and talk about our feelings?”
Harry squeezes his hands into fists, lets them go with a sharp exhale from his nose. “You’re jerking me back and forth here. After our conversation last week you seemed upset, but like you were coming around. And now this? I don’t understand.”
Draco nods. “That would work. What about getting back?”
And they both laugh, the sounds intertwining, harmonizing. Draco had always thought life was lived most honestly in a minor key, a half step from normal, melancholy haunting him wherever he went. But as Harry’s knees bump against his own, it’s like a finger has slipped from black key to white, the sounds inside him taking on a different tone.
Harry is lucky that they start to move again, as his ears nearly catch fire when he registers the wording of his faux threat. Even worse is the rosy hue rising in Draco’s neck as he leads Harry into his old home turf.
“I’d very much like that,” she says, then gives his knee a light squeeze and retracts her hand.
And he Apparates.
McGonagall presses her lips into a thin line. Off to his left, Hermione releases a wet sigh; she’s crying.
Harry feels frozen in place. He’s staring down at the ground, one hand fiddling with his robes.
“I dunno,” Draco murmurs. He turns in place again. “So much is familiar, but there’s a lot that isn’t. It’s not possible that so much could’ve changed in the time we were last here. Is it possible that the Room of Requirement doesn’t follow the same rules of time?”
In the final moments of the ball, everything goes sideways.
They start out. Harry is grateful nobody else had stuck around to see them emerging from the classroom together.
He nearly falls flat on his face when he turns a corner and sees Leon walking in his direction. Light pours in through the windows and lights him up, his eyes crinkled in laughter as he talks to Bella, one of Harry’s new Beaters. The bliss on his face morphs when he notices Harry, shifts into cautious excitement. Harry fights the thumping of his chest as Bella leans in and says something to Leon, then turns around and walks in the other direction.
Draco gives him a look, searching for an explanation.
“What’s going on?” McGonagall asks sharply.
A notice about Quidditch had been posted that morning; it explains the way teams would be formed for the inter-House league. Madam Hooch would conduct tryouts for anybody interested—including Beauxbatons students—and make the teams herself. The total number of teams is still undecided, but the notice also included that the whole league would be cancelled if less than four teams end up being formed.
Harry lets out a huff of laughter, shaking his head.
and it’s not his voice but it’s coming from his mouth.
“Well, hold on. When was the last time you had to use that spell?”
Harry’s heart freezes and cracks. “What do you mean?”
“Alright, you’ll have plenty of time later to ge to know one another. We have other teams to announce!”
“I look a right mess, don’t I?”
“Not just anybody would be as forgiving as you are,” he says, exasperated, throwing his hands to his sides. “Not everybody is. I know that for a fact. So would you just accept my bloody thanks so we can move on? I feel like I’m still two steps behind in whatever this is because you’ve already moved on, and I’m really just trying to catch up and do the same. So, just…please.”
Harry takes a step back, genuine fear playing in his eyes for a moment.
“Oh. Mister Malfoy. I wasn’t expecting you, was I?”
See you soon,
Harry shrugs. “Worth a shot. What’s the worst that could happen?”
Draco nods. Now that he thinks of it, Harry could probably get into any House’s dormitories if he needed to, being Head Boy and all.
He’s about to launch into a frustrated rant, but a small silver cat darts around the corner and stops in front of him.
Harry grimaces. “You can say that again. We were planning on kicking your arses.”
“Something like that.”
,” Madam Pomfrey says, her eyes impossibly wide. “Water, up-to-neck burial, oxygen deprivation. It won’t stop, and it seems it’s not doing damage at the same rate as normal fire would but it’s just as painful. Experts from Mungo’s have been alerted and will be here as soon as they can be, but they’re backed up today!”
With a start, Harry realizes he’d never asked Molly if they could install the phone, so he jumps to his feet. Hermione looks over from the bed. “Something wrong?”
Not even Mari knows about this sleep-Apparating yet, as he’s been sort of hoping this specific issue would sort itself out. Clearly that was naive. But the implications of why he’s able to Apparate at all are frightening given the event that started this trend.
“I didn’t.”
He’s been set up. And the only thing he can do in response is to smile, because at the end of the day Leon is being respectful of his time and allowing him to work. And yet, Harry is brimming with the desire to toss his work away, turn around and pounce on Leon. That’s what something inside of him is telling him, anyway.
“That was incredible, Draco. I’m so proud.”
Harry shakes his head and tries to push down the sensation of drowning. “People will still know if we’re the only two people there who’ve come without dates.”
So Harry explains. Never taking his eyes away from his own hands, he tells her everything. Draco’s accusations toward Leon, Harry’s inability to see what he’d been talking about. The Great Hall collapsing and then rupturing, Rowan’s plan, Leon acting under Imperius, Pamela sneaking around as Leon thanks to Polyjuice. Harry lays it all out, his voice monotone, his chest hollow. Resisting Rowan’s control, disarming Pamela.
Harry scoffs. “What the hell do you mean? After…” He steps in closer and lowers his voice. “After we went down there together and saw just the
“What’s he going to do?” Blaise says with obvious disgust.
“But they didn’t.
“Well, I’m still gonna
,” Hermione says with a cautious look in Draco’s direction. He understands. Sure, he’s jealous that Harry is, well,
“Oh, just Head Boy stuff,” he says unconvincingly. He could tell her, but that feels like a betrayal of McGonagall’s trust.
She wipes at her eyes with a kerchief, pursing her lips. “Just that there was some kind of collapse in one of the corridors, and that…Harry Potter was the one who saved you.”
“So what was it that you needed to talk about?”
scared me, because you’ve turned around so fiercely and so suddenly, and it was really confusing. So I defaulted to what I knew, to how I thought this relationship was supposed to work, even though I knew it was wrong. I dug my heels in. I recognize that now. But I’m so
“I…I think I should go. I’m sorry for intruding.”
“I should hex you.” He regrets the words as soon as he says them. He flashes back to their altercation only hours prior.
“You’re having a horrible time,” Harry says and covers his face with his hands.
He steps up to her desk and takes a deep breath.
Leon suddenly stands across the room and breaks him from his thoughts as Draco opts to watch him storm out of the Great Hall. It’s hard to tell from a distance, but it looks almost as if he’s...crying? Draco is unsure of how that might fit into any of the hypothetical narratives he’s constructed, so he decides it’s probably time to go to bed and quit being so nosy. He gives the younger boy next to him a polite nod and thanks him for helping him with the food during their meal. He’s nothing if not properly polite.
There are so many things Harry wants to say. But more importantly, he has a thousand questions that are fighting to be the first to emerge from his lips. And he’s too afraid to ask a single one.
“This is bullshit,” Harry says, not caring about his language, not caring about anything.
Typically the status of Quidditch practices are up to the captains. I happen to know the captain, so I can probably pull some strings for you.
Harry can’t quite suppress a laugh. “Good question. Sometimes I swear she’s on a completely different level of consciousness or something. She saw me reading your letter and guessed that it was from you, and then also somehow guessed the nature of the letter.”
“I didn’t think you were. Just. What would you say?”
don’t want people to know that we’re together yet. It’s just a kiss, it obviously won’t mean anything.”
“If you have a headache, if your neck is sore, if you get heartburn, if you’re constipated.
They’ve already come so far. Might as well rip the bandage. “Believe it or not, it’s Draco Malfoy.”
“I’m glad,” Harry says. “Well, shall we have a tour? You’ll be living here indefinitely, so you might as well get comfortable.”
Hermione’s face immediately shifts from amused annoyance to deep concern. “Harry? Is something wrong?”
He sits up straighter. “No.”
“And how do you know this?”
“And he’s also…”
“Not so bad, right?” Leon says gently, so gently, and the hum of his voice is a tiny quake against Harry’s skin.
She frowns, but then seems to understand. “You are in the Hospital Wing, actually. I believe this is where Madam Pomfrey usually sleeps.”
Harry doesn’t know what to say to that, and he’s afraid that Rowan might actually be right. He can’t fathom what kind of twisted opportunity lies beneath their feet, remnants left behind by Slytherin himself, no doubt. Was this day always going to come? Was it just a matter of time before their home was weaponized against them?
“You do?”
“Fine, thank you,” responds Joetta, looking down at the floor. Draco notices a badge hanging from Harry’s robes that says ‘Head Boy.’ He feels surprisingly lukewarm about it, but he can tell Pansy’s noticed, too, by the not-so-quiet snort from behind him.
Hermione does release a sob now and buries her face in her lap. Harry glares at Ron; it’s perfectly fine if he’s mad that they didn’t let him in on their secret, but now is not the moment to hash that out.
“But still no shirt?”
It feels like an eternity passes, two, and all Harry wants is for everything to stop. Nothing makes sense but his hands are on the ground and they’re warm and sticky and a ferric odor fills his nostrils.
He takes a deep breath. As much as he wants to jinx her right in the face, he knows that things can only get better if he puts himself in her shoes. If Draco were her, he wouldn’t be speaking to him at all.
He nods, laughing in spite of himself. “Of course there is. You know there is. Sometimes I swear you know me better than I know myself.”
“So, what now?” Harry asks. His body tenses when he realizes they’re near the place Leon tried to hold his hand the first time. Then, he’d run away from the truth that Leon didn’t even realize he was offering. Now, he glances around, sees they’re alone, and makes the connection between their hands that he should’ve that first day.
Blaise takes a respectable bite of brisket and chews it, his forehead wrinkling as he thinks. He swallows and sets down his fork.
“Morning,” he says when he’s finished coughing up bits of bacon. “How’ve you been?” It’s been nearly two weeks since they’ve spoken.
There’s nothing there. Maybe it’s time to get some sleep. Surely Blaise is in bed by now?
“It’s open,” she says, her exhausted voice just audible through the wood. “Come in.”
Harry grins and tries to turn his head to look at Leon, but he can’t quite get around enough. “How did you finish everything already, anyway?”
“Isn’t it better to have a target for this kind of thing?” asks the Weasley girl. Ginny. She does have a first name, and Draco does know it.
“I’ll write you,” Harry says.
“You don’t have to—” Harry says, stopping when Leon looks up at him.
“I—I see,” Molly says, one hand partially covering her mouth.
“What are you doing here?” she asks and pulls away, suddenly panicked. “The Minister of Magic was just—“
Most importantly: the damage is fixable. He can see that, he can hear it in Leon’s voice. It’s a second chance, the branch of an olive tree carried in through that window Leon opened for him.
Draco allows his wand hand to fall to his side. “What does it matter? I can hardly get a fucking ball to show up, let alone an entire Patronus.”
“I’ll disarm, you defend, alright? Verbally this time, just as an example. You know the—”
. But it also helped me realize that there was something going on with
Draco watches as Mari is guided away with Madam Pomfrey’s support, his pulse throbbing in his neck, down through his fingers. He takes in a sharp breath when the headmistress clutches his shoulder and pulls him to the side.
you. They respect you, and they’re so grateful for you and everything you’ve done. And I don’t think telling any of them that you’re dating a man will change those feelings.”
“The snake is the Slytherin House animal.”
Another twist of his insides. Something about the knowledge of Leon’s presence in the class makes him even more nervous, as if he has something to prove to him. Not that he doesn’t feel that way about everybody else; there are clearly high expectations for Harry due to the short amount of time it took for both classes to fill up. Although, that could also be due to the fact that people like Defense Against the Dark Arts regardless of who’s teaching it. But it would be naive to dismiss the idea that his being
He’s in that unfamiliar part on the third floor of the castle again, and navigating there from an atypical Potions location had been something of a journey. He doesn’t actually expect to be seen right away, nor does he think Mari will even be there. But something in him had required his presence here. Sometimes your body knows what you need before your brain does.
Harry smiles, then buries his face in Draco’s shoulder. “I wouldn’t say no to a spot of tea,” he says, voice muffled.
Harry cuts Ginny off. “This is
Draco can’t help but laugh at how baffled Harry looks. “Yes. You keep saying
“Is okay,” she says, returning the smile. “I know enough English to get by. French is just more easy. But I am getting a hang of it, I think!”
Ron narrows his eyes further and leans in. “I don’t know. Your scar looks different.”
Leon shrugs. “You’re lucky you’re cute.”
“Right. Things sort of came to an end as a result.”
“Already laying on the responsibility, I see,” Harry says with a grin.
“That’s perfect, thank you! It seems your table is rather full, so I think I’ll join that one over there,” he says, pointing over at the Slytherin table, which is already overcome with light blue. Harry notices Malfoy staring blankly into space, not acknowledging any of the action around him.
“You’ll all have to come up with a team name, of course. That can wait until your first practice, or it can happen sooner if you wish. It needs to be Hogwarts appropriate, mind you, and there obviously can’t be any repetition. I urge you to get to know each other and see if there are things you all have in common, that would be a great place to start. Names need to be decided a week before your first match. I’ll be posting practice schedules and announcing the first official game of the season by the end of this week. I can be flexible with practice times as long as you can be. At the end of the day, everybody should get the same shot.” She claps her hands together, surveying her work. Harry can tell she’s proud of the teams she’s created. “Alright, well, that’s it from me. Have a great week, all!”
Ginny snorts. “My problem is
“If I die, I am going to haunt your arse
Blaise makes a noise and shakes his head. “Afraid not.”
“How could you have detained the entire faculty of Hogwarts?”
“That sounds about right,” Harry agrees.
Ron clears his throat next to them and Harry suddenly remembers himself and releases his grip.
He continues to scan the crowd of people mulling around the middle of the pitch. He sees quite a few Beauxbatons hopefuls, which is something of a surprise. He remembers that…Leon had talked about a few friends who were interested in Quidditch, but he’s completely in the dark about whether or not they have a league at school or if maybe they just play outside. Either way, they could be lacking in the talent to keep up with the Hogwarts students, or they could be miles ahead of them. Harry is incredibly interested to see how things play out.
Draco’s breath catches when he sees the change in Harry’s expression. It’s subtle, but the light in his eyes seems to flicker.
Daily Prophet
If the situation were different, Draco would be starry-eyed and his spirits would be soaring. Harry came to check on him. That’s what he’s saying by being here, by sitting on the edge of Draco’s bed, as far from Draco as he can, but on the bed nonetheless. It’s what he’s saying with his brows pulled together and his eyes big and full of worry, his chest heaving with the speed he ran through the castle. Or so Draco imagines, at least.
“And that’s okay! You don’t have to have all of the answers. Hell, you don’t have to have
Hermione laughs, and then remembers they’re in the library and covers her mouth.
Potter hesitates, refusing eye contact. “I can offer no official comment at this time.”
Leon nods, quiet for a second, just looking at Harry. “Thank you for inviting me in, Harry. I’ll let you go now.”
“No, I suppose I’m not. Not yet, at least. What a bar I’ve set for myself.” And then another wave of anxiety rushes over him like he’s been shoved in the Great Lake, icy green water filling his lungs; not even poking fun at the situation can take the serrated edge from the back of his neck. Harry guides Draco to the edge of the bed, firm grip on his shoulder. “What have I done…” Draco mutters into his hands, tiny salty orbs dripping between his fingers.
Lastly, Harry nods to Bella, who gives him dry smile. “My name is Bella Dumont, and I’m the other Beater. I’m a seventh year by Hogwarts standards. And this is Eva Lafoy, our final Chaser. She doesn’t speak a lot of English, but she knows a lot about Quidditch so she’ll catch on fast. She’s a third year. Second youngest person in the whole league, I believe.” Her accent is heavier than Leon’s, and she seems to take herself a bit too seriously. Harry wonders what her and Leon’s friendship looks like.
She shrugs. “Start wherever you need to, and I’m sure we’ll be able to figure out where to go from there.”
He shakes his head, stopping in the middle of the street. “It really was that long?”
Harry frowns, trying to pull it up so he can peer down at his feet, but sure enough it won’t budge. He then tries undoing his own knot, but it stays in place. “This is cruel,” he mutters, letting his hands come to rest at his sides.
His Patronus stands before him—towers, really—its silvery wings stretching toward the ceiling. The whole world has crystallized and from beyond his diamond haze, Draco realizes that all of Hogwarts is staring at him.
It makes Draco want to rip his fucking hair out. How could Potter
During his many years at Hogwarts, a perfectly mastered brew of fear and contempt had been cast his direction by many a pair of eyes. But this? This new concoction is free of the trepidation and replaced doubly with animosity, cold and distancing.
“I’m no expert, but I think that might help inform your inner debate about your sexuality.”
“Twice!” Ron says, launching out of his seat. Hermione grabs at his robes, hissing, “Oh, will you
“I suppose it wouldn’t kill me,” Harry mumbles.
“You’re right, this is crazy!” Harry says, feeling slightly frustrated.
“You wouldn’t happen to have any more of that salve, would you?” Madam Pomfrey asks, joining them by the bed.
“Are you afraid of shirtless men? What kind of homosexual are you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s stomach growls and he grabs his stomach, his cheeks turning red.
Harry frowns down at the piece of parchment in his hand; only a few lines are written. The material is good, but it definitely isn’t enough to have taken Malfoy so long to write. Unless…
He shrugs again.
Breakfast that day is almost as eventful as Harry’s birthday breakfast. It starts normally, the Burrow’s inhabitants shuffling into the kitchen one at a time at their leisure, eyes still heavy and hair mussed from sleep.
Michael shrugs. “Well, I haven’t ruled out the possibility.”
“I—what?”
Harry can understand why everything has been moved. It weighs on him the second he sets his eyes on the rubble. Hogwarts may look normal above the surface, but right beneath the students’ feet exists a graveyard.
Hermione places a hand on his shoulder. “Who says that’s a bad thing? It was inevitable that things would change now that
Harry picks at one of his nails as she speaks, his foot tapping. “What about you?” he whispers to Luna. “Are you still coming?”
Almost all of the loose ends are being gathered at this point; there's still one thing that still has yet to be addressed (which will make the speed at which the Drarry connection happened more believable but for now u just gotta trust me I promise tho). Very excited to see your reactions to this one!!
“It’s not. I hate it,” Draco’s chest heaves, sweat pooled at the nape of his neck. His eyes sting with heat. “I’ve…I’ve tried to get rid of it. Almost cursed my whole arm off once,” he says between breaths. Harry’s nose is virtually touching his, glass-green eyes pinning him to the spot. He doesn’t say anything, but his expression is enough; Draco can feel it, burrowing into his pores. Draco feels sympathy for himself, and something even more rare. Forgiveness.
He’s interrupted by Ron yelling “
“Too true.”
“Right.” There’s something almost comical about the business-like exchange they’re having, but it feels like a step in the right direction.
“Something like that. Do I sound crazy right now? I feel crazy? My heart should be in a million effing pieces, but I just have this weird hope inside.”
Harry snorts. “You didn’t think this was going to be
