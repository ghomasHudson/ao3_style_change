Then, came the long-awaited discussion of his father’s health.  Lucius fought it at every step, cutting in with snide, self-deprecating comments separated by uncomfortable moody silences.  Mother explained the details of the Dark magic – “wasting” magic they sometimes called it – and the toll it had taken on his body.

The thought of Harry sent a flare of pain through his chest as he remembered this morning, and he sobered as he followed the students at a chaperoning distance.
“Why?”
.  A ridiculous grin stole across his face.
It wasn’t a long journey – this week’s party was in the 8th year common room, where most of them happened.  They would occasionally switch it up and go to the Room of Requirement (which he’d been pleased to see at the beginning of the year had decided that the students

Harry chose to deliver his next diversionary tactic while plucking at loose threads on his jumper.  “We can discuss it later, if you want.”
Harry had become disgustingly sappy over the course of the past week.  Since the conversation in which they’d worked out their misunderstanding (Draco
And now, just days after the trials, he was still coming down from the torture of having relived it all again.  The Wizengamot had prodded through his memories unfeelingly – and it had only been worsened by watching his parents’ recollections in the pensieve as well.
Harry was still looking at him, so he forced himself to answer.  “Not at the time, but later.”  His voice dropped to a whisper.  “Mother told me.”
Harry’s long silence was eventually broken by Sam’s outburst: “

would hire him – and it took several more days of begging various shop-owners until one reluctantly agreed to take him on.
But today, though currently embroiled in a focus-necessitating potion, Draco couldn’t help but lament his current situation once more.  When would Potter come around – if ever?  How long should he tiptoe around the man to give him space before it became ridiculous?  Frankly, it

and ethically complicated that the thought of teaching it to students made him want to scream.  Though, perhaps, it could solve the issue of Harry’s intentions much more quickly.
In all honesty, though, it wasn’t his
Nodding, they set off.  And it wasn’t ten minutes later when Potter himself finally showed up.
It was simply a matter of planning.
Draco gasped.
The man took a fortifying breath before freeing Draco’s cock through the flap.  He paused, taking it in, just as Draco was taking

Something didn’t look right outside his office.  Draco paused by the door, thrown for a second by not being able to place what it was.  After a moment though, his eyes fell upon the office hours sheet.
The man flopped into the proffered chair gratefully, looking like he’d just fought in a war.  Draco offered him tea, and he politely refused – though he looked a little wistful in doing so.  “It has come to my attention,” he began, “that Minerva is trying to kill me.”
Draco’s was already pointed at his throat.
Harry stopped again, his face blazing.  “What, is this your fantasy or something?  This shit goes on for four more pages!”
“There are many things I wish I could change,” he finally settled on saying.  “It doesn’t mean they actually could have happened any other way.”  Even if
She said it offhandedly, like it wasn’t the single most exciting piece of news he’d ever heard.

Bagman tossed his head back and laughed.  “Right you are, my lad!  Every man’s got to go out for a drink now and again, every man indeed.”  His eyes twinkled conspiratorially as he leaned in closer.  “Even if society doesn’t think highly of you, you know?  They can’t take that away from you, at least.”
“So the boy rejected him?” Draco guessed.
Should he humor the older students, since they would surely take initiative and work on it on their own?  Or would a responsible Head of House cater to the younger students, so that everyone – regardless of age – would enjoy themselves?  He was several arguments deep, head pounding with migraine, and no closer to finding an answer than three days ago when this had started.

Marla’s lips curved into a contemplative frown.  “It’s not… I mean, I don’t think she even noticed.  And it’s not about that – not entirely.”
And if the Savior of the Wizarding World looked miserable, then what hope was there for the sorry bastards like him?
Harry sucked in a sharp breath and bit his lip like it was the hardest question he’d ever been asked.  “Just keep…keep doing what you’re doing,” he managed at last, letting out another little groan.
His rage boiled over.
“I would

Then, the panic set in.
.” The cum disappeared, and they both fell back onto the bed, exhausted.
Harry pouted tremendously before finally admitting, “It was…flirting.”
Then came panic – that his first thought could be so heartless; that no matter how long he lived, change never ceased to be terrifying.
, that is?”  He bit his lip to cut off any more humiliating questions.
” Right away, Harry’s dick shot up. Somehow, even more erect than it was earlier.
He felt eyes on him and raised his head to find Harry standing at the threshold.  “Really, Potter?  Lurking in doorways now?”  He gave the man a once-over.  “Are you ready to admit you’re stalking me yet?”
VOLDEMORT: It’s good that you used fresh – the extract would’ve been too strong for this kind of delicate cream.  Very nice bake.
“Come in!” Potter called from inside.  He sounded far more jovial than Draco had ever had cause to hear him.

.  Take me, for example-”  He levelled Draco with one of his more intense stares.
As far as conversation transitions went, this one was pretty transparent, but Harry seemed to sense that Draco was at his limit with depressing talk about his family.  “Nothing, mostly.  I stayed at the Burrow.  Ron and Hermione moved on and moved out into their own place, but I stayed.  Ginny was there, but busy with Quidditch stuff.  I kept everyone pretty distant; I was trying the whole ‘peaceful living’ that I had never gotten to experience growing up, but in the end, it just wasn’t for me.”
“Yes, indeed,” Slughorn murmured.  “Cruel – and also careless.  Which is why I shall forego participating in this year’s festivities altogether.”  He glanced up to meet Draco’s eyes in a rare show of acknowledgement.  “I was rather hoping
“I just…  I mean, we haven’t even talked about what we want to say to them, so I didn’t want to be blindsided, and-”
FRED: Draco – will you bring up your showstopper?
“Merlin,
“What’re you…doing?”  Malfoy asked, taking a few hesitant steps closer, like he wasn’t sure what this situation in front of him entailed nor if he wanted a part in it.
Draco felt his heart clench at the wistfulness in her tone; it had been a long time since such light-hearted fun, for her.  “We’re still deciding.  One of the seventh-years is scoping out the competition first.”
His class status was a point of contention between them, even though Draco had ostensibly lost any of his former privileges.  While Morpheus mocked him for his background, calling him “snobbish” – or worse – he could see the gleam of jealousy in the man’s eyes when he needled him about all the luxuries Draco had lost.
“Right now,” Draco explained, “it causes people to lie compulsively, instead of simply resisting the truth.”
He had the gall to smirk.
“Like…like this is exciting.  Scary too, but mostly exciting.  Like spending time with you…well, it’s different than how I felt for Ginny.  I loved her, and I feel terrible for how we drifted apart – it really was my fault, after all – but in this selfish way, I’m glad it happened so I could pursue this new thing with you.”
“Obviously, that was all bull, and he just wanted to make money.  I see it now, but I didn’t then.  Or I did, but it didn’t matter, because I had no better options.”  Her eyes made their way back to Draco’s.  “What I’m saying is you’re not nearly as entangled as you think you are.  You showed up one day at my door, and you can leave one day through it.  For me, it’s not quite so simple.”

Harry smiled.  “Oh, that’ll change for sure.  Don’t you know that we Gryffindors are required to skip everywhere we go?”
[DRACO nods and, without thinking, looks at HARRY who raises a brow then grabs the other side of the platter without prompting.  DRACO looks suddenly flustered, but, somehow, they manage to get it to the judging table without it toppling.  The effect is truly magnificent.]
She smiled.  “That’s lovely, Draco.  What kind of events have you been made responsible for?”
She nodded once before at last breaking her gaze.  And, after some shuffling and signing of papers, his wand was in her hand – and then, it was all he could see.  The smooth hawthorn length was so nostalgic, so perfect.  He reached out eagerly, and then he was finally holding it again, amazed at the thrum of magic that buzzed through him.
.  Why don’t you tell us, Draco – tell us how it feels to keep little mudbloods up on their brooms?”
For a long moment, Harry did nothing – and Draco began to panic that he had thought better of this whole affair.  Either that, or he wasn’t as into men as he must’ve thought.
Why the fuck was
”  He was mainly babbling out of panic now, which was why he startled when Harry grinned wider and slipped to his feet without any warning.

right now, given the news going around the castle.”
A flicker of something akin to pitied amusement stole across Slughorn’s face.  “Good night, Draco.”  The door shut swiftly behind him.
The party was slowing as the evening wore on – most of the younger students had gone on to bed, so it was just a cluster of seventh-years chatting around the fire.  Draco decided it wouldn’t be so terrible to have a sip of that drink now; almost all of them were legal in the Wizarding World, after all.
Now there’s a face you don’t see every day!  How’s it going, lad?  What brings you to the Wyvern tonight?”
“It’s time for dinner,” she said simply while both of them continued to gawk and sputter at the audacity.

Merlin, she was just toying with him now.  She was smart – smarter than him, certainly – so he had no doubts that she knew
Harry grasped Draco’s face and forced him to meet his eyes.  “That’s not true.  You being a competent, mature teacher here is reason enough to grant it.”  He hesitated, eyes drifting to the side.  “Also… I think she’s just really fed up with all the rumors focused on us.”
He turned to locate the voice in the crowd, but Malfoy’s hand, just coming down from spinning him, grabbed him by the chin and turned Harry’s face sharply back to face him.  Harry gulped as Malfoy’s hand slipped back to interlace with his, and those fiery, gunmetal eyes met his with infinite challenge.
Draco glanced over at Harry and tried to shake the memory of those green eyes dozy with sleep.  He’d somehow been even

He felt she was asking more of him, which was irksome – especially as there was nothing holding his father to the agreement, anyway.  But he would feel dirty if his pushback forced his mother to do something like bribe him with a returned heirship once Lucius had passed – something he was certain she would do if he protested.  In the end, he just shut up and ate his soup.

him to visit his class?  He seemed rather determined about it, in a way that both shook Draco to the core and terrified him.
“Really?” Harry managed, though inside the stall, he was engaged in a silent battle that consumed all his focus.  Draco had gone for his dick again, and Harry – in a panic – was holding him back by the hair.  Clearly furious with this tactic, Draco was pinching the sensitive skin of his inner thigh as a means of getting revenge.  “We’ve talked…sometimes.”
“Have you done this before?” Grant asked, drawing his cock from his trousers and stroking it a few times to full erectness.  His eyes were glazed, and he must’ve been distracted enough by the pleasure to miss the flicker of hesitation cross Draco’s unguarded face.
“Sure,” Harry said, voice colored with relief.  Like Draco, he was probably happy to avoid an argument – about serious things at least, since they both had agreed long ago that playful banter was a turn-on.
HARRY: You-
With that in mind, he drew his second hand down to catalogue the feel and size of his bollocks.  He rolled them languidly in his palm, and Harry let loose a wordless cry that had him pressing higher into his perineum next.
The man tossed his scarf and coat over the back of a chair at the table next to theirs and then met his gaze with a sly grin.  “Hmm, which to choose?  We all know which
“And I really don’t want to-”
“What was here?”  Potter’s head snapped from side to side, searching.  “What was supposed to be here, Malfoy?”
Draco eased the ragged pair of glasses from Harry’s face and folded them into his grip, not quite willing to let them go.  How many times had he teased Harry for these?  How many times had he drawn crude little sketches of unthinkable cruelty befalling this man – whom he had characterized only as a pair of glasses and a scar?  Though, even then, Harry had been more to Draco than that.
Draco scowled.  Just because it was true, didn’t mean he needed to say it.  Besides, judging by Potter’s presence here and the array of teachers around them, he had to be here as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor - a much more prestigious position.
And yet, his reactions-
Frankly, it
Which, admittedly, was a rather large divergence – but personally, he didn’t think warranted as much attention as it was now getting.  As he stepped up into the stands, he saw several students zoom in on him with Omnioculars, Hermione’s face grow dark with suspicion, and – gaping in wordless horror – Filch walk straight into a pole.  That one made him smile, once he was sure Filch wasn’t getting up to see it.
Something felt so freeing about the open air.  Perhaps, it was due to the stark contrast between this sky and the many forms of prison he’d endured so far in his life.  He remembered the first time he had noticed it, how, in sixth year, his initial excitement had bled into suffering – how the stone walls had closed around him like a vise, and Hogwarts had become his first real prison.
Draco couldn’t help but roll his eyes at that one.
So really, it was his annoyance at Potter and

Harry flinched away violently like Draco had discovered his darkest secret.  “It wasn’t during
Sure enough, Potter dissembled the enchantment in seconds.  He scrambled up from the floor and flicked his wand with another silent spell.
He teased Potter a bit more as they drifted along, but his thoughts weren’t really on the words he was saying – they were lost in the graceful curve of the man’s shoulders; the unwavering grip with which he held his broom.

acting queer – and he intended to get to the bottom of it.
Draco bit back the urge to scream; they were in public after all.
But in his dreams, it didn’t matter which choice he made.  Everything led back to the snake.
“If it’s sparking, then something’s wrong with it,” Blaise commented from several feet ahead.  He held up a hand and they stopped, pressing themselves against the wall until Filch had rattled by with his lantern.  “And Pansy’s right,” he continued in a whisper, “this is
He hissed as he pulled up his shirt to examine his side in the mirror.  One of his ribs was definitely broken.
But there was that tiny, senseless voice in the back of his mind that nonetheless wondered “what if?”  He hated to admit it, but a shamefully significant portion of him still believed that Harry could do anything.
He took stock of her posture, hunched with the burden of regrettable decisions, and wished more than anything that he could do something for her.  If he were Harry Potter, this would be the time to claim, “I’ll save you” – or something equally brash.  But Draco wasn’t Potter, and looking into Gloria’s eyes, he had seen that she knew all that.

sat Draco with two cumbersome horns on his head.
Blood pounding in his temples, Draco caught Harry’s chin in his grip and tilted his head up to look at him.  It was suddenly vital that he had Harry’s full attention.  “What, you like that, Potter?”
Draco winced.
He ground his teeth, feeling older than he ever had in his twenty tumultuous years.  Not long ago, he wouldn’t have had the guts to tell his mother to stop.  He’d been so compliant for so pathetically long, and it had only harmed him in the end.  Now, he stood up to her – not because it was easy or he enjoyed it – but because the alternative would surely destroy him before he’d had a chance to mature.
“Well, I don’t know about
The man stopped, and, very slowly, he turned to face him.
Harry laid a hand on his shoulder and faced him.  “I think that if you asked her, Minerva would give you permission too.”  He said it seriously, too, like he truly believed it.
Draco dove in anyway.  “In fact, I never thanked you for coming to testify at my trial.  I…I don’t think I appreciated it as much at the time, but I can see how you saved me a much more painful sentence.”  Which was, well, the understatement of the century – but it needed to be said, nonetheless.

Draco had gone to bed that night convinced that he had scared Potter off.  He’d been every bit of his pushy, unchecked self, and now he’d have to pay the consequences.  There’d been no mistaking the fear in Potter’s eyes.

Draco thought for a moment of the Manor – of all the thousand emotional betrayals he’d committed against the Dark Order during the war.  He thought of how it had coalesced into that one moment he’d looked into Harry’s eyes and said only “I can’t be sure.”  He thought of his father’s deluded arguments that were hurled at him to this day.
MINERVA: The flavors are fine.

.  If he was totally honest, he was too.
So when Potter suddenly darted in his direction, it was altogether too little time for him to reign in his fantasies and react.  Potter slammed into his collarbone.
He took a long drag from his cup and then sighed.  It would be vacation soon enough, and, personally, he couldn’t wait for the opportunity to laze about the castle with nowhere to be and no assignments to keep Harry distracted from him.  Just imagining it, even, felt blissful; it felt like more than he deserved.
“Of course.”
He’d crushed those thoughts quickly, before they could grow.
And the worst part was: Draco agreed.

Despite the inconvenient timing, the reckoning had arrived, and Draco planned to milk it for all the hilarity it was worth.  He feigned annoyance, rubbing at his ear like Potter’s complaints were merely an irksome drone in the background.  “Yes, yes.  Are you done your little tantrum?” he asked.

Seizing the theatric potential of the moment, Draco read a few key lines aloud, causing Harry to choke and splutter some more.  But the humor of it died when Harry stumbled upon the Malfoy article in unscripted retaliation, and he read the first line aloud before immediately trailing off at its unmitigated horribleness.
He felt a warm weight on his arm, and he looked up to find McGonagall reaching across the desk to comfort him.  “Thank you for telling me, Draco,” she said.  Then, fiercely, “And I would

“Fine!  Fine.  Look, Ginny…now’s not the best time-”  His voice jumped in pitch as Draco pinched him hard enough to tug free of Harry’s grip, and then his mouth was latched around his cock again.  He tried – rather unsuccessfully – to stifle both the gasp of surprise and subsequent groan of ecstasy.
Her gaze softened a fraction as she considered him.  “Where did you go after the war?” she asked.  Then, sardonically, she added, “And what are the papers likely to dig up, now that you’ve ‘stepped into the spotlight,’ as it were?”
That, at least, earned a grin.  “Well, I was
Draco cast another locking charm on the door, as well as several silencing spells.  He turned back to the page.

crossed his wand thrice above him, then shed a quick tear.
Harry stood immediately, cheeks burning, and stalked to the corner of the room, where he drew a strong silencing charm around himself like a cloak.  Draco could see his lips working but heard none of the lies that came past his lips as the seconds ticked down and away.
There was a collective shudder around the room, and Draco’s skin prickled at the name.  It sounded so unfamiliar, being said aloud.  The man had lived in his own

Potter froze his fidgeting, clearly not expecting that.  Draco had him trapped.  He surely knew that if Draco had talked to Hannah, then he might know about their outing to Hogsmeade – and their subsequent conversations.
Draco could feel his stress levels rising –

The loose t-shirts and jeans he wore only concealed his lean muscles and smooth expanse of brown skin.  It was practically a crime – and one Draco was only willing to forgive in order to keep this to himself forever.
Had he thought about it at all?  “Yes, well, like I said, it’s a bit beyond my control.”
And it seemed that these feelings he’d quite like to dull

His confusion was high, and his panic was mounting—
“It goes better when he’s not surrounded by Zabini and Parkinson.  And…I guess when I’m acting less hostile.”
“Well, that’s presumptuous,” he snapped, before he could stop himself.  Then, he looked up to see the smile sliding from her face, and he realized with trepidation that she very well might be the only one to show him any kindness here.  He couldn’t take that for granted.  Not anymore.

what Draco wanted to be doing.
Each morning, he was caught at this impasse, and each morning, it was the image of his father waiting at the Manor that made him put off reaching an answer.  Even if he did end up going home, he could never muster up the energy to face both Morpheus and his father in succession.
“Please,” Harry whispered, the request breaking Draco as the man arched against his fingers with lust.
made you do?  Knowing the position it would put you in?”  His face twisted in righteous anger, empathy, and loss.  Eventually, he added, “And your mother – she allowed this?”
Kat and Marla crowed at that, clearly delighted to see a teacher admitting to being sneaky.  He’d learned, by now, that that was a secret to teaching – you just had to demonstrate that you were also human, and it made them infinitely more comfortable being imperfect in your presence.  For kids, especially, that was important.
know?” he asked, wanting desperately to believe her.  But he couldn’t afford to get his hopes up again – it was far too painful when they were dashed.
“What?” Harry accused.
He liked it though – the thought of it.  Not being the one to try so bloody hard all the time for the reward of resounding apathy, a frown in his direction if he was lucky.  Draco decided that, for once, he would indulge his fantasies.  Just for a moment.
He fidgeted with the fit of it, but it was still just as tight and uncomfortable as when he put it on.  “And I haven’t even
.  Maybe good enough to force Potter’s eyes to linger.
The man seemed to come to Draco’s line of thought a couple beats later, when he stiffened slightly and cast his gaze around the room.  “No chance they’ve all just forgotten the articles, is there?” he muttered after he’d surveyed their surroundings adequately.
Draco’s breath caught.

“You smug fuc-”  He lunged at Draco again, only to be hit with an

could shed light on this situation.  Regardless.  What can I help you with this morning – if not something to do with Harry?”
”  His automatic response had Draco finally breaking into a grin at the absurdity of it all.

Instead of looking relieved, Harry just kept prodding at the now-clean fabric – as if it was a trick, and the blood would reappear.  “But the wounds…” he trailed off, eyes tortured and teary, breath coming in stammering heaves.
“Yeah, no.  You’re really not.”  The bluntness startled a gasp of surprise from Harry, and Draco kind of wanted to give Sam a handshake for his daring.
“Oh!”  Cheeks flaming, Harry dialed the volume down.  “I said, ‘just seeing what feels like me,’ I guess.”
,” Draco groaned, letting his head thunk forward onto the library table.  “Just kill me; I can’t deal with this.”
She swept past him with her usual self-possession, finding a seat in one of the armchairs without being asked.  Behind her back, his mouth twisted into a scowl.
Slughorn nodded emphatically, relief visible on his face.  “Yes, I… I think that’d be best.  Thank you.”
“Yes,” he said warily. “And?  What of it?”
.  “Okay,” Draco responded evenly, “See you tomorrow at one.”
“What was that about?” Harry questioned, directly after the door slammed closed.
– it was almost too much to reconcile with his years of unrequited pining.
“Well, you didn’t want me to, did you?”  She huffed an amused sigh.  “Really, Harry.  We ended things mutually, so it wasn’t like I was
He sat up a bit, propping his chin on his palm and looked at her properly.  “Good heavens, whatever would compel you to do that?  If it’s worth saying, it’s worth paying for – that’s what I always say.”
Harry sobered slightly, despite the teasing tone.  They were still far enough away from the other 8th years that he wasn’t worried about being overheard – not with all the caterwauling over ‘who was cheating who’ at Exploding Snap – but as his eyes caught on Malfoy, he couldn’t help but shiver at the mixture of emotions that ran through him.

Rows of picnic tables are set out in the open, snowy field, and heat lamps glow interspersed amidst former contestants, friends, and family.  They break into cheers when the trio come into the light.]
“Harry.  I can see you’re obviously freaking out, which is why I’m here to say…don’t.  Everything will go as we discussed – I’m sure he’ll figure it out in an instant!”
[HARRY, having finished his sheet of biscuits, runs around to the other side of his station to grab his piping bags.

Thanks to everyone for reading!  Sorry again for so much repeated dialogue; I feel like this part has a lot of scenes that are necessary to see from Draco's perspective or it'd create a weird gap in plot/emotional state.
When the man was suitably duped by his compliance, Draco veered into his secondary tactic: he swept the room performatively with his gaze in an act to involve the audience.  “A bit personal of a question to ask in a sweet shop, don’t you think?”
in such vulnerability every hour of the day.  People could hex him in the streets if they wanted, and he couldn’t so much as lift a hand to defend himself.  Would this level the playing field?
Draco didn’t have the wherewithal left to answer.  “Just get out.”  He wanted this to be over with as soon as possible.
“—and then, instead of fighting him, Harry grabbed the ferret’s hands and pulled him into a dance!  Can you believe that?”  Ron threw an arm around his shoulder and scuffed at his hair, despite Harry’s huff of irritation.

Draco scoured the shelves for several hours to find anything he could about sex and gender – which he now realized were two separate things, thanks to a few chapters in a book by Judith Butler.  For the first time in his life, he thanked Dumbledore for establishing a Muggle book section at the library.  Not to say there weren’t magical sources on these topics – there
The worst years, of course, had been the hellish expanse of time that the Dark Lord had inhabited his home.  During that period, all his nights had been fever dreams, and all his days had been spent regretting that he had woken up at all.  And the screams - the screams had soaked into the very walls of his home.  Made the once comforting place cold, unfeeling.
He glowered at Potter up on the stand.  All his life, Potter had snatched away everything he ever wanted from under him.  Fame.  Popularity.  Every winning Snitch.  Even his bloody

Yes, he missed his mother.  But his father – whom he was currently hiding from – was enough to keep him away.  She knew it too, he thought, by the way she glanced wistfully at him in the mirror.
“Really?” Draco drawled, leaning back against the counter with a smirk.  “
“Fine,” Draco echoed, the high of his refusal mingling with fresh fear and foreboding.  He stared Grant down until the man turned and left.
He had a reputation to uphold as the “cool” teacher.
Harry thought.  The very idea drove him on with indignation.
Draco wiped at his cheek self-consciously.  He knew he was covered in grass and dirt.  But with Potter looking so animated from the match in front of him, he couldn’t bring himself to care.  That awful weariness that had blanketed Potter since his return seemed to have evaporated in the space of his victory, and it was a good look on him.  A
It was only later that evening, after visiting the Kitchens and hearing that Potter had been refusing meals, that he decided enough was enough.  He went to bed with a headache, and in the morning, Draco set off resolutely towards the Headmistress’ office.
“Potter,” he repeated, voice low and throaty.  It cracked over his next words too, in which all he could manage was, “What are you doing?”
Draco rolled his eyes.  “I never lose,” he sniffed, clacking his empty tumbler down on the table.

There wasn’t a reliable answer, but in the meantime, at least he had Harry – in some capacity.  For now, that would have to be enough.
“I’ve got to prepare for class,” Harry said.  And then the moment expired, and he was already gone.
The poor boy looked like he was about to pass out from nerves.  “Err, yeah.  It’s fine…”  He looked desperately to Draco, who decided it was finally time to take pity on him.

“Well, that’s too bad – I was going to give you some free advice.”
Zabini noticed him first.  Harry could tell he’d been picked out of the crowd when he saw the man’s eyes widen comically before he turned to whisper furiously to the two Slytherins beside him.  An instant later, Malfoy’s gaze flicked to him incredulously, and Harry’s heart stopped as it dipped to survey his whole outfit before returning, perplexed, to his face.

Potter seemed a bit like he might explode, and his voice was at least three octaves higher when he screeched, “Have a little shame!” before ducking his head from the sight.
When he got to the pitch, they were already circling and hitting bludgers at each other.  This was a bit surprising for two reasons – the first being that Draco would not have pinned them as prospective beaters, and second, because they were actually quite decent from what he could see.  The two of them must’ve been practicing over the summer.
He endured their squiggly eyebrows, waving them off physically, before continuing.  “

That left Draco and Grant.
He heard the clack of a gavel as another testimony came to a close.  If they had any mercy, it would be the last one.  His hands ached from clutching the arms of the chair until his knuckles shone ghostly white in the dim room.  Maybe the trial would end here.

“I want you to last at least until I’m
Draco needed a better plan.
He was so deep in his thoughts that he startled when Harry turned, grabbing both his hands and holding them against his chest.  “That’s not true.”
And even though he was completely engaged in this, he sensed rather than saw the moment Potter reappeared on the pitch.  It was like he’d trained himself to notice the slightest hint that he was near.

– and he found his lips curling into a grin at the sight.
Draco distracted him with some messy tongue movements until he’d slipped the three fingers in.  He drew back, panting against Harry’s lips until he felt it was finally time.  “I think you’re ready.”
RON: [confessional aside; speaking faintly] Mum’s going to kill me… She told me I’d better make it to the finals, or I could kiss my chances of inheriting her Yorkshire pudding recipe goodbye.

Draco glanced back down at his ribs and the bruises spreading across them.

into it – there was no other way to describe it.  His whole body relaxed against Draco’s, his mouth warm and languid against his lips.  Harry shuddered out a sigh, and it was so intoxicating in its loveliness that Draco chased it back into Harry’s mouth with his tongue.
“Those weren’t on the same level at all!”
” Harry continued quickly, before he could be interrupted, “just because he struggles with this particular spell doesn’t mean he’s not brilliant at other ones.  Ones even
“Sure,” he exhaled, with an unconvincing smile.  “Why not?”
He smiled a bit sadly.  Well that was something amusing he could do, couldn’t he?  Add his own delusions to this book?  He doubted that Potter would read it anyway - out of principle - and if he did, then maybe it’d serve as that push Draco wasn’t willing to take on his own.  Merlin knew he’d been nursing these inappropriate feelings for enough years as it was.
Draco stared dumbly for a moment.  “So…do a dental charm?”  Because
But, in fact, he
The man was nothing if not dramatic; Draco let him run his mouth.
Draco finally let his eyes jump to Gloria’s, which he knew had been seeking his the entire time.  She looked frightened and exhausted and…resigned.  At a slight shake of her head, he relaxed his grip on his wand.
She momentarily halted her frenzied sorting of parchment scrolls on her desk to fix him with a hawkish glare.  “No.  And I’ve been asking around the staff to see if anyone knows
Harry glanced up with interest at that.  “Why?  I won’t laugh.”  He began tracing his fingers up Draco’s calf.
In the end, however, the saving grace had been Granger’s reliable penchant for literacy (a trait unlikely to be replicated in either of their other companions).  She’d started a tentative conversation about Potions texts, and that had somehow evolved into a full-on theoretical discussion summarizing all the major advancements in the field in the past two hundred years.
He realized his mistake as Potter hesitated, eyes locked warily on his hand.

Draco closed the door softly on his way out, musing that he’d better be visited by Potter tomorrow.

“Nothing!” they hissed in sync.  Both were quiet for several moments while Hermione read the instructions aloud for the third or fourth time, until “everyone would just be quiet and listen.”  Then, once they had settled into the game – and Harry thought that Ron had forgotten their conversation – the redhead leaned over and whispered, “Let’s meet at the library tomorrow – I’ve got a new plan to try.”
But as he helped a young Muggleborn girl keep her broom from swerving, he began to notice an underlying nervousness on the pitch.  She, like several other Muggleborns in the class, kept flicking her eyes to the more experienced flyers with an expression akin to envy, but far less self-confident.

“Malfoy, what the fuck-”
But he tried to push away that negative line of thought.  Harry was

But if so, they’d be taking him to Azkaban.  He was sure of it, and the thought sent a spike of adrenaline through him - morphing guilt into panic, regret into fear.  If he went there, he would die.  And despite the pain and loss he had experienced the past few years, he was not ready to die.
anything, after all? – he couldn’t help but speculate that it would feel something like this.  Trapped in a room, day after day.  Skin becoming sallow and pale, eyes bruising more from misery than lack of sleep.  Unable to see the depths of his physical decline due to the poor lighting in the bathroom – which was little more than a closet with a toilet and a single lightbulb dangling from the ceiling.  But, to be honest, he would rather not see.

And, just like that, the imposing table shrunk to a regular-sized one, and the imposing Harry-painting melted into one of the Weasleys that hung on the wall at the Burrow.  Hermione’s eyes twinkled.  “I know,” she said simply.  “But you’re going about it all wrong.”
Marla chewed on her lip.  “Like strong and cool and considerate and more outgoing.  Less…
“No, I’m good!” Harry yelped, dodging his friend’s overeager attempt to help.  “I had to sit through you plunging a needle through my ear for this – I think I’m going to keep it a while.”  He didn’t mention that he also enjoyed twirling the stud when class got particularly boring.
“I’m listening,” Harry said, eyes glazed like he wasn’t really.  “I just don’t care.  I would drop down and blow you right now if you wanted me to.”
Draco raised an eyebrow at that, amused despite himself, but his eyes dared Harry to respond in an appropriate way.  Which –
Harry blushed, his eyes darting to the side.
She gave him a flat look and an eye roll and then finally continued casting about the pitch.  “Just tell me you’re not taking it lightly,” she said after several moments had passed by in silence.
“Don’t apologize,” Draco assured, “I was entertained.”
Harry opened his mouth and closed it once before he found the words to speak.  “Draco.

He was thinking about refusing when they hit the final step and a cacophony of noise washed over him.  Then, his thoughts fell away altogether.
of Honeydukes – Mr. Ambrosius Flume himself – came running down the steps to greet Harry.
“Did Rolanda give you everything you need?” she asked in the face of his silence.  “If you feel unprepared for any of the lesson plans, feel free to contact me, and I can get you in touch with her for clarification.  The first year of teaching is always the hardest, and there’s no shame in asking for help – blunders are to be expected as well.”
“I can’t forgive you for calling Hermione a ‘mudblood.’”  The word sounded harsh and flat from Harry’s mouth.  “And I can’t forgive you for trying to get Hagrid fired – and for sentencing Buckbeak to death.  I can’t forgive you for the things you said about the Weasleys and how anyone less than a filthy rich pureblood could ever be of value.”  He paused a second, like it cost him something.  “I can’t forgive you for what you said about my parents.”
It stung.  It stung in a way that he wasn’t quite ready for, given how he’d hardened his heart to the whole affair in the past couple of days.
Granger punctuated a line in her notebook with a jab before looking up; her hair was frizzy and wild with humidity.  She smiled.  “That’s what I’m about to do.”
Harry scrambled to undo his jeans – the immediacy with which he moved startling Draco to full erectness.  Harry undid his belt first, tearing it free with a certain disregard that made Draco feel

Despite the pain, he had moved his stuff into his room at Hogwarts this morning, marveling at the bittersweet nostalgia he felt for being back within the castle walls.

“Yes, yes.  I braved the lion’s den for this; don’t cheapen it.”  He swooped in to press a kiss to Harry’s mouth, which he accepted eagerly, dropping the book he was reading.  Draco drew back, savoring the way Harry’s head lurched forward, chasing his lips.
“Draco,” Harry interrupted, the grin not leaving his face.  “It was wonderful.  It was hot and intense and terribly arousing.  But if you

He nearly laughed – here they were, after all these years, right back at the beginning.  Their second year duel was still so vivid in his mind: the rivalry, the excitement…  It was no different now than it had been then – though a world of circumstances had shifted.
Harry rolled his eyes and gave Draco a half-hearted shove that made him ache for more casual, friendly touches.  Knowing such wishes were dangerous, he pushed off his knees and stood.  He couldn’t resist offering Harry a hand, though, and was heartened when the man took it with no hesitation.
He must’ve been hired as a teacher too.
with Draco in public?
Perhaps it was a subconscious flattery, since Draco wanted his job.  But, perhaps it was also that he saw himself in that defensive way Slughorn carried himself.  Like he knew he’d chosen wrong at some point and would forever be working to pay off his second chance.
Draco glanced up, coughing and swallowing a few more times before he had the wherewithal to raise a brow at the suddenly-teasing tone.  It was as if a demon had been possessing Potter before and now was exorcised.

With brow furrowed like he was in pain, Harry reached down to grip his own dick – but Draco pulled out and caught his arm before he could.  For a moment, he had no idea what he was doing.  Just that the idea of anyone bringing him to orgasm other than Draco – even Harry himself – was unbearable.  He wanted… He wanted-
“I’m sure they can manage without me for a while.  Besides, it might even the playing field a bit,” he said over his shoulder, turning to stride down the path towards the Great Hall.
Scanning his reddened cheeks and breathlessness, Draco rather thought he might be.
MINERVA: Oh dear.  And what, exactly, happened to this loaf?
“What-”
“I’m sorry to hear that,” Draco said, trying to keep his lips from twitching into a smile.
Draco pulled down his pants, and his member sproinged into action. A bit of his foreskin still covered the tip of his long cock. He stroked a couple times, pulling it back. “Now I’m pudding it in you! Bend over.”
It wasn’t fair.  Why was he doomed to desire this man to the point at which it

He worked him looser before pulling his hand out and wiping the excess lube on Harry’s arse cheek.  The sight of him, messy and used like this, got Draco off more than he’d like to admit.
He did, crumbling it in like they’d discussed.  They’d argued a long time about whether chopping it or drying-and-subsequently-crumbling would be a better approach.  He’d won this battle, though he’d lost several others.
He met her piercing gaze and found himself nodding in disbelief.  “I won’t!  I mean, really – I promise.”  Could it really be that easy?

Each morning, he woke with the conviction that he was going to quit.  He sat up woodenly on the bench that doubled as his bed and got halfway to the front of the shop before he inevitably froze.
Jameson noticed immediately and dropped down to a similar altitude.  He was a good Seeker, after all, but Draco also knew he was easy to rile – he’d learned that from the sloppy aggression he’d fucked with after losing a match to Draco before.  So, after a handful of fake-outs chasing gold watches in the crowd or quaffle-tails, he saw Jameson move higher with a huff.
The girls looked at them with wide eyes before hurrying along their way, and Harry took that moment to straighten his jacket and clear his throat loudly before facing him.  “Err, should we go in, then?”
“Yes, Hermione,” he droned.  “‘Oh Malfoy – you look like someone who appreciates fresh produce!  Won’t you accompany me to the farmer’s market?  Or, better yet – let’s cast aside this corporate wasteland and both join a
FRED: [confessional aside, shot outside the tent] I actually slipped a Go-Pro into Harry’s apron when he was home last week, so we have some exemplary footage from Hogwarts to share in order to shed light on Harry and Draco’s school rivalry.
It happened on a drafty night in early April, wind whistling through the cracks of The White Wyvern’s imperfectly mounted front door.  Draco was in a somber mood, sipping on a beer that tasted vaguely of piss (but that the barmaid, Gloria, had slid him for free) after returning from one of his rare ventures beyond the tavern.  He had gone glamoured, of course – not that it mattered.  What he was realizing now, as he reflected, was that people didn’t have to be cruel to you for you to feel as if the world was cruel; the world just had to dazzle you with wonders no longer meant for you.
But also.
SIRIUS: Well, if I was still in the running, then I’d say me, but as it is…  Yeah, it’s going to be Cedric.
But he didn’t get to hear what the boy was wondering, because it was drowned out by the squeals of several
[Cut to Draco, grimacing and squeezing his eyes shut as if in pain.]
“Like he
Ah, yes.  The Christmas lights.  As if their estate was still something worth marveling at during the holidays.  He wasn’t shocked that she was starting so early; they’d lost most of their help after the war, of course.  An undertaking of that scale could easily take months.
When he glanced back, the heartbreakingly lost expression lingered on Potter’s face, though the side of his mouth did quirk up in a little smile – to Draco’s relief.  “We could always resurrect the dueling club,” Potter joked.  “To give my students some more practice.”
Harry sighed heavily.  “Yeah.  Said he wasn’t ‘that way’ or whatever.”

“Want me to remove it?” Ron asked, already readying his wand.

I don’t live in a boys’ dorm where privacy is scarce and secrets scarcer – let alone someplace I have to change in front of a bunch of my friends who are suddenly scared that I’m leering at them because they know I like blokes!”
He dropped his wand to the snake, prepared to vanish it if it lunged, when Potter cast his next silent spell.

[The camera refocuses on HARRY and DRACO to gauge the losers’ reactions, and yet they are not at all what we might expect.  DRACO looks wryly disappointed, like he can’t decide whether he’s upset or amused, and HARRY is shouting something to him over the noise – to which he nods, and suddenly they’re slipping away through the crowd.]
Draco shook his head in amusement.  “Spare me.  That might be the most pathetic thing I’ve ever heard.”
That’s right!  It had been in one of Aunt Petunia’s movies.  Not the ones she’d watched with Vernon, obviously, but the ones she’d play in the hours when her husband was off at work.  They were romantic, mostly, so Harry could understand her embarrassment, but he suspected it was also the fact that many of them were

“Why?  Scared you like what you see, Potter?”  He knew he was pushing a little now, yet he couldn’t help but say it – and with a laugh, no less - because Potter’s reactions were finally giving him reason to hope.  And that, more than anything, filled his chest with a warm, euphoric rush.
No, he had to be more than careful regarding his potions hobby – he had to be
The man looked caught between relief and indignation.  “Mister

VOLDEMORT: But let’s see how those bottoms turned out.  [He picks up one of each rugelach and flicks them systematically with a taloned nail.]  Hmm, fairly crisp.  That’s a good bake.

Draco had heard of the Green Flash – even confined to the shop as he’d been.  It had come out only two months ago, and like its namesake, was supposedly so fast you'd never catch it.  Like the flash of green light emitted from the sun setting over water.
He waited for Harry to nod again before easing down and pressing in.  Harry’s brows were furrowing in discomfort, so Draco snatched his lips in another kiss – praying it would be enough to relax him.  Even with just the crown sliding in, it was easily the most pleasurable thing Draco had ever felt.
**Hey everyone!  Just as an update, I've decided to remove the "Graphic Depictions of Violence" warning from my story, as I've gotten past the darkest of Draco's memories that I'm really going to delve into, and they didn't end up being as graphic as I anticipated.  As always, I will continue to give content warnings for individual chapters, but I just wanted to let you know the reason for the change, so it wasn't a confusing surprise.
Harry complied with a thud, and Draco marveled once again that this was happening.  That Harry was
In an instant, Draco realized what this must be about, just as he realized he didn’t have any good advice to give.  He’d heard of this – seen mentions in books, mostly – but he had never really dedicated much thought beyond the fact that it existed and didn’t apply to him; he’d steered towards learning more about being

The sudden knock came like a gavel, condemning him to his nightmares.
He had unpacked his bags, putting away the clothes and books he had brought, but that had been all.  After all, it wasn’t like he owned much these days, after being cut off from the estate.  But it was enough to make the room look his own, and the green glow of the lake through his porthole window calmed him.  Some minnows drifted by, casting small shadows on the chair.
Draco repressed a surge of jealousy at the delicious and comforting-looking meal that was leagues above the things he’d ever gotten sent up to his room.  Potter had certainly done more to earn the adulation of the elves than he had himself, though.  With a sigh, he set out to do what he’d come to do – flicking his wand over the meal with muttered incantation.
“Purple used to symbolize royalty,” Harry cut in, but Draco continued—at an increasingly high decibel—overtop.
The dinner with Weasley and Granger had kicked off abysmally, with both couples floundering between over-stiff politeness and the general disbelief that this could head anywhere but disaster.  Harry had been in rare form, skittering about like a startled shrew – so thick was his anxiety – and it had been all Draco could do not to start panic-insulting his partner’s friends
“I like it when you curse,” he protested.  “You’re so disgustingly posh the rest of the time.”  He sounded so petulant saying it, too, that Draco broke into a grin himself.
magic have you performed, then, in the past eighteen months?”
Several of the older Slytherins had volunteered to take over as the “haunted escort,” but Draco was having fun, so he shooed them onto the Ball.  Besides, it seemed a waste not to wait for Potter to come by – he’d be damned if the Savior was frightened by anyone else’s hands, and he wanted to savor the rare expression that would invariably cross his face.
Harry gave him an unimpressed look.  “They did.  Minerva brought that up at our meeting as well.”
Nothing ever came for free.
SIRIUS: [confessional aside] Snivellus?  Hah, he’s just mad that my bread chain does better than his – that, and I don’t need to kill myself with work to make it so.  His bakery tanked, and then he was forced to become a professor for money.  You know what they say: if you can’t do,
Draco blinked at him like that explained nothing at all.  “You’re telling
Harry returned his smile tentatively.  Then, he grew serious again.  “And your mum?”

Draco refused to look up at Harry’s undoubtedly kind expression.  “It’s not that I haven’t
Yet, again, Potter did not visit.  Draco might’ve simply given it all up too, had he not run into Longbottom on his way to visit Hannah’s office.
“Yes,” Draco breathed, feeling sweat crawl down his temple at the mention of
“Do you promise to go and see Minerva?”  He looked hopeful but wary.  Like Draco was prone to throwing fits like a child – an assumption that ultimately had him grumbling an affirmative that lit Harry’s face with relief.
Harry blew out a sigh of relief before he started shifting uncomfortably on the floor.  Realizing that his knees must be hurting him, Draco pulled him to his feet.  Harry leaned in for another kiss, and Draco couldn’t stop himself from being an arse and asking, “What, can I help you with something?”

“What the fuck am I doing?” he was greeted with as he stepped through the door.

“Good.  I’ll see you later!”  He took another step towards the door, gaze still lingering.

Draco’s eyes narrowed.

Harry swallowed.  “Yeah.  Any better?”  He’d thrown it out there as a bit of small talk, but now, with Malfoy’s intense gaze focused on him, he found himself rather nervous for the answer.  His stomach churned a bit, like it held a batch of Cornish pixies inside.
“Harry James Potter, if you don’t tell me-”

Harry burst into a renewed wave of laughter and tugged Draco in by the collar to press an adoring kiss to the side of his cheek.  “No, you idiot, it’s a
Draco flipped idly through the book.  He had read it, of course, when it had come out.  It may have felt a bit pitiful to set down at the register in Flourish and Blotts – he distinctly remembered purchasing a whole stack of books on that day to divert attention from that particular title – but he hadn’t been able to resist.
that defined every foray into Harry’s mere orbit.  It was instantaneous and calamitous and shook Draco right to his core.
He gave Harry’s knee a quick squeeze and then released.  “But that can wait,” he said, hoping it came out teasing instead of terribly unsteady.

Harry looked strangely out of his depth as he gestured for him to continue, and Draco was eager enough to get this over with that he did without any teasing.  “So I got sentenced to eighteen months without using any magic,” he said, trying to keep the bitterness from his voice.  “I lived at home for a while to sort out my mess of a family…  That turned out to be a horrible mistake.”
Malfoy hadn’t noticed him yet, so Harry took his time looking.  The man was crowded on either side by his new cronies – Zabini and Parkinson.  The latter was whispering something to them, which Malfoy responded to with an easy smile and low response of his own.  They didn’t seem to be playing any games yet (not that he’d noticed any going on), but his gut clenched with nerves at the idea of approaching them in their current formation; his clothes felt even more strangling as he watched and waited.  The trio was their own island in a sea of classmates, and something about their closeness sent Harry eddying away from their shores.
*!  That’s *
Harry let out a muffled groan as Draco gathered a firmer grip on his hair.  He tugged Harry’s head in close so it ghosted Draco’s abdomen with each panting breath.  He held him there until Harry’s throat started to ripple around him, seeking air; then he pulled off.
“Juicy articles about The Boy Who Lived taking place within our good castle walls?” Draco asked sardonically.  “Unlikely.”  His chest felt tight all of a sudden, and he couldn’t help the question that slipped out next.  “Why, would you rather no one knew?”
I thought it was fun that the chapter 11s of SIFLEOY and TNFI aligned, so it feels like the timelines are still somewhat on track!  Anyway, hope you're all gearing up for the real Halloween (the Greatest holiday), and stay safe!
Potter’s eyes roving all over him.  It made him want to yell, to strangle him, to succumb to those gross, complicated feelings deep down inside.
She smiled broadly, then skipped off to put away her broom.
“Invite me in, dear.”  Her face was made up as usual, but today it looked strained.  She wore a set of plain, unadorned black robes that were becoming, yet not up to her typical standard of opulence, and Draco found himself wondering for the first time whether she was aging more since he left – or if he was simply removed enough from the Manor to start noticing.
,” he said at last, sounding defensive even though it was true.
When her feet hit the pitch, Draco amplified his voice and called out “First!”  Several of the students, hearing this, grew sluggish in their efforts, figuring the winning position was already taken.  The teams in second and third, however, seemed to double down on their efforts to complete the circuit before the other.
“Harry, I know it’s you.”  She sounded exasperated, too – and not the least bit sorry.  “You always leave robes and towels lying everywhere when you bathe.”

At that, Harry’s grip tightened infinitesimally on his hand.  “And what does that compromise entail for you?”  The worry in his voice was evident, which would have been amusing had Draco not been intimately familiar with paranoia and doubt.
It wasn’t like that now.
“Lucius, stop,” Narcissa cautioned, eyeing Draco warily as he took his seat.  As if he would flee so easily after psyching himself up to come.
Fuck, maybe the crop top was drawing too much attention.  He had cut up one of his Cannons t-shirts as a last-minute addition, which had clearly been overkill.
But after everything, he was pleasantly surprised to find that he still enjoyed flying.  Sitting up on a broom in the sky, gazing across the green of the pitch and the dense foliage of the Forbidden Forest – really, there was nothing like it.  And the air, while crisp, still had yet to settle into those bitterly cold Scottish overtones.
.  Violently, unmistakably purple—”
Draco looked away.  He wasn’t quite brave enough to face all of Harry’s emotions laid bare – they mirrored his own too well.  “Mother…didn’t agree.  But ultimately, she is not in charge of our estate.”  He took a sip of his butterbeer.  “You see, this is why the disinheritance they mentioned in the papers didn’t affect me so much.  That news is nearly a year old; the
you read it.  And I honestly never thought you’d be interested.  So I let it get a bit…imaginative.”
“Well then,” Malfoy said, raising the Arithmancy book under his arm.  “Care for a lesson?”
“Imagine building up what you think is a romantic tension over months and months, and then you realize it was all one-sided,” Harry announced.  Draco didn’t have to imagine.  “It’s like if everything happened with us up until the Halloween Ball, and then you asked me to dance, and I was like, ‘no, what are you talking about?’  That would hurt, wouldn’t it?”
Draco scoffed, shedding his robes and folding them before seating himself next to Harry.  “You kept starting sentences with ‘Actually, I-’ then breaking off and telling me mundane updates about Weasley and Granger’s lives – all whilst continuing to frown like a kicked crup.  Was that
“Are you okay?” Harry asked – a complete non sequitur as Draco turned back around to face him.
Now he had the ghost’s attention.
“Class,” he greeted, then quickly realized he had nothing else to say.  “Hello.”
Draco’s eyes snapped to his.  “No.”  He couldn’t imagine anything more torturous than dealing with his father

Draco hadn’t thought it possible for Potter’s cheeks to grow any brighter, but to his delight, they did just that.  And he laughed outright when Potter glanced away, unable to maintain the heated eye contact.
“Do nicely for
If he had been able to defeat the Dark Lord, it would have saved so much suffering.
“Here…” Draco forced the fear onto his face.  It wasn’t hard – after years of the war, it was a familiar, cold embrace.  “It was supposed to be here…”
Perhaps it was tied up in Dumbledore, the man he’d both hated and looked up to his whole life; the man he’d been ordered to kill.  The mercy he had extended to Draco, at the end, was sometimes too painful to bear.
Harry drew back a fraction to sit up.  “Like, it will
HARRY: I know the others are taking a bit of a breather, but now is when I have to rush the most in order to get all my fillings done in time.

Endearingly, he only manages to smear it across his cheekbone instead.]  I’m still not sure about my flavors for the wild strawberry one, but I’m sure I’ll come up with something. [We see DRACO rolling his eyes from the work bench behind him, annoyed expression flitting across his face.]
“I…I mean-”
Draco laughed, drawing Harry flush against him.  “All the more reason, then.”  He dipped his head for a kiss, jarred from the softness of the moment when Harry drew away before they could connect.
“Stupider than you wanting to date a former Death Eater?” Draco attempted again, this joke falling even flatter than the last.
was following him, because it meant that, this time, he was well and truly alone.
Did he honestly believe that he would get anywhere with this pacifist shtick he had picked up somewhere in the past two years?  It muted and dulled him in a way that infuriated Draco, not only because he wasn’t living up the image in his head – the boy he remembered so clearly from school – but also because Potter looked so bloody

Harry turned around, catching the pudding cup in his line of sight. It glistened beautifully, the flame of the fireplace reflected in its plastic shell. Harry bit his lip and once again turned away.
“You would?” Harry asked, sounding shocked.  This was what Draco had been afraid of – Harry misinterpreting Draco’s frustration over their own miscommunications as apathy for Sam’s predicament.
He was sure to say it casually, like it wasn’t a big deal – and to his relief, Jimmy just nodded, seeming eager to end this embarrassing spectacle.
doing a ‘house of horrors’ – all through sheer coincidence, of course.”
“And what plan was that?” Harry asked, face rearranging into a scowl.  Even frowning, he was still far too good-looking.
However, he was disgusted by how easily he was being manipulated back into the Manor – back into their lives – simply because the timeline was vague.  But it was also serious enough that he couldn’t point it out without making an arse of himself.  Which he resented.

He settled for a vague nod, rising to see himself out.  “I’ll be going, then,” he said.
His shoulder, his forearm, and his thigh pressed tightly to Potter’s, and each swath of skin under his gear was branded with the singular, white-hot knowledge of that intimacy.  His eyes were on the snitch.
He blinked.  “Oh, right.”  Seemed to ponder it way too hard.  “12:30.”
the maliciousness Draco was capable of spoke volumes of the trust he must’ve had to let him anyway.  That he let Draco undo him seemed somehow secondary to this quiet concession.

A fan favorite, the earlier mention – and now visual evidence – of his girlfriend is doubtlessly breaking thousands of hearts across the nation.  She appears, beautiful and laughing, in the cozy kitchen set-up, and they begin to throw flour at each other in a highly impractical yet also highly endearing food battle.]
Draco leaned against the wall and waited for everyone to enter first while he tried his best to compose himself.  It had been over two weeks since he’d seen the man – would Draco lose it and do something to get himself fired?  The frustration and hurt within him were matched only by his rage, and that made him feel twitchy –

Draco allowed himself a full three seconds of shock before barking out a laugh.  “

The camera reverses for a moment so the audience can see a smiling FRED who throws a peace sign and sticks his tongue out before flipping the camera back around.  Most of the crew seems to have left by now – DRACO, however, lingers, and when HARRY steps out the door, he grabs him by the front of the jacket and slams him against one of the tent’s supports.  HARRY’s eyes widen, and the breath is knocked out of him.]
Harry groaned around his cock, and Draco bit his lip so hard he tasted blood.  He hadn’t received a blow job since Pansy Parkinson fifth year, and the difference between the experiences was staggering.  That one had been quick and one-sided and ultimately disappointing, while this one felt like a strange frisson of energy between them that was igniting.

And Potter’s eyes kept drifting over to Draco like he, too, couldn’t quite help it.  Like he couldn’t quite believe he was actually there in his classroom, listening peaceably to him talk.  Draco could hardly believe it either, and each glance had him preening – standing a little bit straighter, grin a little bit wider – while the Savior droned on and on about wandcraft with increasing fervor.
It had been irritating at the time, of course.  But it had also been all that kept him this side of sane with the Dark Lord living in his house.  Potter’s frantic attentions had been

So yeah, some snippets of Draco writing his sneaky Skeeter parody this time.  In the comments of TNFI last time, someone wrote that it was like Draco writing his own fanfiction of them, which I found hilarious (and pretty true)!  Hope you're all enjoying his perspective so far.

He worked Harry open gently – giving him the time that none of his hook-ups had ever afforded Draco.  He would make this
or whatever.”
His outburst made the judge jerk her gaze to him again, while his mother whispered a broken “Oh, Draco…”  He held the judge’s eye contact until her harsh expression flickered, and she heaved a heavy sigh.
“You awake?” Draco asked.  He shifted, then remembered the glasses still clutched in his grip.  “You fell asleep with these on, so I took them off,” he said, easing them back onto Harry’s face.
FRED: Okay, I’m intrigued.  Tell me everything.

He smiled at the clumsy antics.  “Yes.  Tea would be lovely.”  He kicked off his shoes and slumped onto the sofa, rubbing his face several times to rid it of his perpetual scowl at the Manor.
Draco could feel Harry tensing beside him, frustration clearly warring with his Gryffindorish sense of responsibility.  “Oh, of course,” he gritted out eventually.  “How silly of me.  I’d hate to keep our Quidditch coach from doing his job.”  He faked a laugh, and it was so stilted that it took every bit of willpower in Draco not to laugh at him in earnest.  “Will that, er, take long?”

His tone was lukewarm and unmistakably displeased, but Draco – knowing now that this was unavoidable – plastered a smile on his face before turning.  “Mister Flume.”  He offered a hand.  “How

“Oh, very well; I’ll be courteous,” his father continued.  “
“Or your perfect, perfect hair.”  Harry was breathing hard now, like the words were taking something out of him.  Maybe
Draco had spent the afternoon with Hannah the other day, only to hear an endless stream of horror stories about all the things students could incorrectly transfigure salamanders into.  (The worst of these was, undoubtedly, a singing blowtorch, which harmonized with Peeves as half the classroom went up in flames.)  Not having anything sufficiently terrible to relate in return, Draco had awkwardly described a Quidditch scrimmage in which someone had fallen into a patch of stinging nettle.  Hannah had not looked very impressed.
Harry looked at him with big, innocent green eyes, and Draco felt his heart rate speed up.  “You.”

The surety in his tone made Draco embarrassed that he had ever thought otherwise.  Even though,
He was pushed to the basement door, sweat breaking out as the wards crackled against his flesh.  Forgetting his bravado, his head swung wildly to take in his captors – to take in the situation, any possible escape routes.  He felt adrenaline shooting through his veins as he realized there were none.
Why was he being so agreeable about this?  Draco hadn’t wanted a fight, but he found this easy acceptance grated on his nerves just as much.  Did Harry even
looking Potter, he noted – walking a kid in his direction.  Potter glanced up then, eyes widening and then a look of worry coming over his face before he nodded, greeting him with a neutral “Malfoy.”
And yet,
It was a long moment before the man seemed to remember he was teaching and spoke again.  “First, we bow.”  Potter dipped his head hesitantly, eyes never leaving his, and so Draco let his own head drop into the respectful obeisance he had never granted Potter before.
Harry bit his lip to keep from saying he’d ditched the dating advice book at the Weasleys before they’d even started the Horcrux hunt.  It had seemed unimportant at the time, and it seemed even less important now – though for entirely different reasons.
GEORGE: The judging was especially hard this round, seeing what’s resting upon it, but after careful consideration, the judges have decided that this round’s champion will be…
Harry nodded, scratching the back of his neck, which was shaved and fuzzy beneath his hand.  Ron had insisted that “all the hip gays had undercuts these days,” so they’d gone with that in addition to the bubble-gum hair color charm this morning.
Everyone fell quiet for a moment.  Taking this chance, Roddy stepped hesitantly up to the table, floating a tureen of soup behind him.  “Er, Roddy is not meaning to interrupt, but the next course is being ready.”  He winced like he expected one of them to upend it over his head.  Draco wondered, with vague horror, whether that was something his father did while he was away.

“Do you want me to…” Draco flicked his gaze downwards, saliva pooling in his mouth at the mere idea of sucking him off.
“It didn’t work,” he snapped back.
It wasn’t like the wand changed things – not really.  He was still unemployable, he still had no home to return to, and he still hadn’t gotten any closer to unraveling the knot of feelings in his chest about finding love with a boy.  Ultimately, he was the same mess of a person he’d always been.

She answered as such – amused, like she was just indulging him, despite being the one who had asked.  “I imagine.  Though I have full faith that you’re doing a wonderful job.”

he’d written it down in shame and in fear,

“Man, you wizards read too much of that
Draco fought down a smile in order to keep his face impassive.  “Oh, surely you know?  The ones about Potter.”
“Like that, Potter?” he growled, praying to Merlin that he did.  Because, even after two hits, he could feel the addictiveness of it all set in; he felt the rush of physicality as his hand swung into the hit, the utter satisfaction of watching Harry’s body jerk and absorb it.  The quiver of Harry’s skin as pain faded into prickling pleasure.
Draco stared at him.  Harry’s face remained solemn for a few seconds, then his eyebrows wavered and his mouth cracked into an unstable grin.
And then, suddenly, it was too much.  The feeling of Harry squeezing around him, the warm slide of his skin in Draco’s hands… He came with a groan that he covered by biting down harshly on Harry’s neck.
Occasionally, someone would come in who needed a custom order, and in those situations, Morpheus would appear in the back with a list and a gruff “Get to work” that sent annoyance lancing down Draco’s spine.  The one thing he wouldn’t budge on was that Draco was not to be seen by any customers – a mandate that quickly grew frustrating when he needed clarification on potion uses or ingredients.
He winced, though it was fair.  And despite himself, he felt charmed enough by her treating him like a normal former classmate and not some odious monster, that he felt himself relaxing into casual humor himself.

Like I mentioned in the end notes of my TNFI epilogue, I will not be updating this story on a weekly basis like before, but I'll try to update every 2 or 3 weeks (and maybe go back to weekly if I build up enough of a head start). I've also had a lot of fun writing shorter pieces the past few weeks, so I want to leave time for myself to work on these and refresh my interest in continuing. (If you haven't checked my other stuff out - please do! I've got some ferret!Draco, some crack with Ron, some scooby-doo inspired shenanigans, a literal rewrite of The Raven along Drarry themes, and a more serious piece about Professor Burbage haunting Draco.)

“I cursed you.  Obviously.”
Ron paused until Harry looked up and saw his barely-contained amusement.  “Yeah, mate – that’s just common sense.  I could’ve told you that.  Remember that book I gave you last year?
Seeming to sense the bitterness in Draco’s tone, Harry brushed some bangs from Draco’s eyes and ran his hands down the side of his face in a soothing manner.  Draco leaned into the touch, feeling distinctly like that hippogriff Harry had tamed third year, his embarrassment only outweighed by the peace that overcame him.
Harry scowled.  “Not great.”

When he burst out onto the lawn, he wasn’t surprised at all to find Potter already there.  The man was hovering about on his broom, looking every bit the cheeky, injurious bastard who would do such a thing.
Harry stared at him for a minute, eyes sweeping up and down with a curious little frown on his face.  “Of course.”
“Then take it off.”

Her eyes stay trained on his for a long moment before flicking back to Harry and politely demanding, “Have a seat, dear.”
Her question cut through his musings, and Draco eyed her warily before responding.  It seemed that she was being civil today, too, from her less extravagant lavender robes to her slightly softened expression.
Merlin, no wonder Harry had praised Draco for his public speaking.  It hadn’t been anything special, but this was just pitiful.
Draco was relieved enough that Harry hadn’t asked “

Flitwick was saying something again, trying to contextualize this unacceptable display into something educational, but Draco found he couldn’t focus on the words.  He gasped around each unwilling bout of laughter, but it still wasn’t enough air-

His remorse about Dumbledore was the reason he was sitting in The Three Broomsticks instead of the more inconspicuous Hog’s Head Inn.  Though he would have less of a chance of being noticed there, he would likely be noticed by Aberforth - the one person with even more reason to hate Draco than most anyone else.
“Ronald, that’s not funny,” Hermione cut in.
The last curse sent Harry over the edge, and he was clawing Draco like an animal as his body shuddered and spilled.  Spasms wracked that body, and Draco milked them from him, savoring every jerk and jump of Harry’s cock against his palm.  His fist flew even faster now with the cum slicking between them; the obscene sound it made drove him higher and higher until he, too, exploded.

.  But Potter, being a common ruffian, was bound to show up late out of spite, so Draco had afforded a half hour window to account for that.  Really, it was a basic event-planning trick – one he’d used on Pansy many times in the past.
Now that he considered it, it seemed arrogant to assume it was.
“Earring?”
Draco crept closer to the cabinet, casting muffling charms so it wouldn’t alert anyone.  Technically speaking, even though he was a teacher, he still wasn’t supposed to be wandering around the castle without a patrolling shift.  It would look suspicious if he was caught – and suspicion was something he had to avoid at all costs, given the circumstances.  But, as usual, his desire to one-up Potter eclipsed even the barest of common sense.

Draco finally freed his hands to set his book aside without crumpling it.  “Hardly.  Now get off so I can read!”
Discomforted no doubt by the intensity of his reaction, Harry was now blushing.  “Err, I suppose.”  He said it like it didn’t matter – like this was just some casual, alternate path he could’ve walked and been fine with.  Not the earth-shattering realization it was to Draco.
But Harry was going wild.  Unable to keep up the deep-throating at this heightened pace, he had drawn back for shallower thrusts, but wrapped his fist over the remaining length to pump.
She grasped it after a moment, eyes never leaving his.
The man’s smirk only grew wider, which Draco corrected with a well-placed pinch.  Harry sucked in a sharp breath, which quickly faded into a groan.
; he just had to sit there, and Harry came up with strange and flirtatious interpretations of Draco’s actions on his own.  Like when he urged Draco not to fellate his bangers and mash at dinner, when it hadn’t even been on his mind (this time, at least).
Another thing he ignored in the coming months was a series of owls from his mother.  He had answered the first few – in the beginning, when he’d let his hesitation about his current path lead him straight down the road into masochism.  He’d wised up since then, letting his mother’s letters stack, unopened, in a pile that he tried his best most days to simply forget existed.
the “correct and moral” thing to do when a parent was dying – Draco was clearly just a petty, unreliable son: exactly what he’d always feared.
Harry pulled back to swirl his tongue over the head, and Draco nearly jerked out of his grip with the tremor it sent through him.
Mother had left the house the way it was the day the Death Eaters vacated it.  Sure, she had asked the elves to clean and restore, but otherwise, everything was kept the same.  The rooms where the most terrible of tragedies had occurred – well, she simply shut their doors.  As if, someday, when the memories had blurred a bit around the edges, she could simply throw them open again and see not a woman getting devoured on their formal dining room table, but instead, the easier times of winter suppers before the war.
.  He tugged lightly at Harry’s head, palm cupped neatly around the base of his skull, and Harry moved forward without resistance.  Draco could’ve laughed with surprised delight.  “Oh, this is going to be fun,” he murmured as Harry’s mouth wrapped around his cock.
Draco could see the light of interest sparking in the other students’ eyes, despite themselves.  They were being drawn in.
“Well, if that’s the case, then I’m afraid-”

He and Granger made a research date that their partners accepted with resigned sighs on both ends, and his shoulders felt slightly lighter as they Apparated their respective ways.

“What kinds of things does it make you say?”  Harry pressed.  “Also, who are you even testing this on?”

Draco drew himself up before looking “Google” in the face and asking, “Why do people wear stripey jumpers to parties?”
The former star laughed as he handed Draco a broom.  “Oh, rejects, villains – people down on their luck, like you and me!  There’s a whole slew of champions that the official league would never take.”
“Wh-what are you talking about?” Potter mumbled defensively.
A pallid white hand slid between the doors and forced them open.

, however, this was not necessarily the case.  After long games – mostly the ones Draco won – he’d often retreat upstairs to find not only Grant but a handful of other players waiting for him.  These were the kinds of men who often felt no shame in praising the Dark Lord – or, conversely, believed that Draco’s past lent him an edge of danger that would feel glorious to conquer and control.

He frowned.  If only that were true – but if it was, Potter wouldn’t run from him like he was escaping a curse.  The man was attracted to him; that much he couldn’t explain away in waves of self-deprecation.  However, the fact that Potter ran away
Draco blinked at him in confusion, watching a new blush rise to Potter’s face.  Then, he excused himself immediately, muttering that
post that fake schedule for my students to see!  They’ve been keeping me up all night for mostly trivial things that they could easily ask during the day.  Moreover, you made me look like an idiot with all those ‘flight lessons,’ you absolute prat!”
“The same.  No, this is all just his usual ‘planning ahead.’”
– and almost purpled with blood in his arousal.  Precum leaked freely down the side, and it took everything in Draco not to fall to his knees and lap it off.
Draco stared at him, tensed and ready for the slightest casting movement, waiting for Potter to try and show him up before the class.  Just the slightest twitch, and he would retaliate.
“Draco, that’s 80s Muggle slang. No one says that anymore.”
Draco tackled Harry, forcing him backwards onto the couch.  He climbed atop him, pinning his hands in a light display of dominance.  “Is this your way of complimenting my style, Potter?  There are more honest ways of doing so.”  He drifted his lips over Harry’s, smirking as the man tried – once again – to chase his lips as he pulled back.

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed, and I'll see you soon for chapter 2!
Draco’s heart tripped in his chest when Potter called him by his given name.  He wasn’t sure he had ever heard it from him before.
MOLLY: Harry’s a good boy, he really is.  Much more polite than my own sons – they could stand to learn a thing or two from him.  [She glares pointedly off-screen where we hear a crash and some laughter.  Then, fondness softens her expression once more.]  But he’s also very dedicated and works with a sort of chaotic creativity that I’ve never seen rivalled in the field.  I have full confidence that he’ll make it through to the end.  He’s destined for great things.
“Feeling better?”
would be able to work them.”
The panic of that night was returning to him in pieces – the running, the screaming, the flames.  But more than that, the quiet terror he’d felt afterwards when Mother had told him about Harry.  How close Draco had come to never seeing him again, never resolving anything, never setting eyes on his vital, radiant form.  It felt like being told that the glass next to his contained poison, and all the reassurance that he
Which…was good—it gave him an out.  Harry told himself that was good.
NARCISSA: Draco is a lovely boy – always has been.  He and his father both have a lot of professional pride, which is why there is sometimes…friction between them.  I just want him to be happy, so I’m glad he’s made it so far on this show.  Perhaps, if anything will convince Lucius that he’s got a pastry chef for a son rather than a sous chef, it will be this.
He knew it was mean, but Potter had been craving punishment with his own little prank.  It was only fair.
The kiss was harsh and wet and meant only as a precursor.  Grant’s large, scarred hands began peeling back his clothing, and Draco tried to lose himself in it.  He was sick to death of feeling ashamed and hidden and

Draco’s lips curled into a smirk as he realized he might be the first person Harry dared sharing this with.
“I…er…didn’t think of it like that.”
The worst effect of finals week, however, was neither the students’ behavior nor the other teacher’s distress – it was Harry’s constant occupation with things other than Draco.  Harry worked from morning to night designing, then editing, exams for his classes.  He worked until his wrist was worn out – which Draco thought would be the natural end to his martyrdom before Harry showed up in an herbal splint that allowed him to write for several more hours until Draco forcibly put him to bed.  Which was a thing he needed to do now, apparently.
Whatever Harry wanted, he would get.

Draco smiled slightly at the implication.  “Okay.  But that
It took Potter four days to catch on, which was a little dim – even by his standards.  The day after he’d put it up, Draco had come to breakfast almost anticipating a fight, but instead, he’d merely gotten to enjoy the expression of sheer disbelief on the man’s face when he realized Draco was sitting with Hannah.  He made it his goal to be unpredictable more often.
Draco spat at his feet, noting that that, too, was marbled with blood.  He felt sick – but also, sickly satisfied.  And, to be honest, that scared him.  “You disgust me.”

, they couldn’t be having that.
He startled to see, this time, Potter staring back at him.  The man must have been looking for a while, because he didn’t seem intent to break his gaze, even when Draco noticed.
Draco was momentarily stunned into silence.  Harry…wanted to go out with him –
She analyzed his face a bit more, seeming to find something that pleased her, as she broke into a wide smile.  “Well, after Harry had brought you up several times, Ginny didn’t seem too pleased about the turn in conversation, so she essentially told him to ‘fuck off and go sit in on one of your classes’ – if you’ll pardon my language.”

“What?  No, I’m not doing that again.”  Sitting in Harry’s lap the last time had been both arousing and humiliating, and he’d decided then and there that he was unprepared to hand over so much of his dignity in one sitting – literally.
Regardless, he worked himself to the point of exhaustion every day between potions and flying class – yet still, in the midst of all that, he found time to torture himself about Potter.  What was the man

Throughout the rant, his eyes grew wilder, his motions more emphatic.  At the end of it, he stood panting, wasted body no longer able to keep up with his rage.  Azkaban had trimmed the edges off his father, leaving him sharper and frailer than ever before.

“No!” he shouted just as Draco finished with “-feeling ill?”
okay – I’m not sure about Sam.  He had a bit of a disastrous confession to his crush.”
When it was over, Harry lifted the charm but made no move to rejoin him.
Fenn slipped away after that, returning to the frivolous conversation around them.  He didn’t blame her; things like the war were best talked about in small doses.  He fell back into easy chatter with his students, though the ghost of their conversation remained.
Harry realized all at once that he had made a huge mistake, because Zabini was

He entered Harry in one slow, steady thrust.
Harry chewed on that for a minute before gathering himself to respond.  Draco half-expected him to refuse such a sorry excuse.  “I get that,” he said instead.  “But I’d like to know what’s going on if possible so I can help you.  Or just listen.  Sometimes having someone just

“They made him come over and try to identify me.  I know he recognized me.  But he didn’t say it.  He told them he couldn’t tell.”
They clamored up the stairs, and Harry paused dazedly as Draco cleared the path of ghouls (mainly with some smartly placed lights and cleaning spells).  He considered stopping once they’d reached the common room, then decided against it when he remembered students could pop in anytime.
Draco set his jaw and nodded.
He ordered another firewhisky.  It didn’t escape his notice the way the bartender slid him the drink with a look of disgust.
[Cut to shaky point-of-view footage from the waist pocket of HARRY’s apron.  The camera flashes over a classroom full of students, all whisking pots of cream on the stove.

The thought sickened him terribly, but what else could he do?

The following week flowed by sweet as honey.  In the long stretches of afternoon after Draco’s flight classes, he’d begun carting his books up to Gryffindor tower to lounge in Harry’s office while he worked.  He read a mixture of books on gender theory – disillusioned to look like Potions books – and
In addition to the added stresses of the Halloween Ball events, Draco had also received a few letters from his mother lately, that he’d begrudgingly forced himself to open.  She had apologized – through long-winded excuses, mostly – and implored him to meet with her soon.  Though he felt he’d really rather ingest a burning barrel of bees than do so, Draco wrote back in the affirmative, convinced that she would only become more vehement if he refused.
“And you are laughing about this

Anyway, thanks for reading!
Remembering their argument now, Draco was astounded by his former naiveté.  It had been less than a month ago – really only a few weeks – and he’d already tired of the sex and the men he’d thought would release him.  For so long, he’d felt crushed into an unsuitable mold and believed that cracking it open would unleash him.
“A bit,” Draco lied.
– when had he ever refused a challenge?  It would work.
“Well?” Harry demanded.
I brought extras from home, so I wouldn’t need to wash the same one so many times!
Hell…”  Harry was clearly scrabbling for something comforting or lighter to say; it ended up being, “So what you’re saying is… I probably
The thought made Draco furious.
Several players in his periphery were mounting brooms and making substitutes, and it wasn’t until he saw Grant flying by with a beater’s bat and a laughing expression on his face that Draco came to his senses and took off as well.
Potter worked his jaw, fighting it, trying to speak through an unmoving tongue.  His eyes were wide with surprise.
Harry glanced confusedly between his face and the hand.  “What?”

for some reason, seemed to believe in him, and that kind of trust was intoxicating.
His eyes were on the snitch.
Heaving a sigh in between panting breaths, he sagged back in his chair, muttering cleaning charms.
Draco eyes widened surprised. “What are you doing?” he asked, as his eyes began to close sensually.
Seeing the stubbornness on Draco’s face, Harry relented.  “Fine.  Then here’s a different subject: are you going to stay over, now that Minerva’s given you permission to Floo?”
his sordid tale – and not sure he wanted to.  “Well, first off, I dealt with the trials and their aftermath.”  He looked up at Harry, cataloguing what might constitute a conversational landmine at this juncture.

With his bare hand, he drew his wand from his pocket and cast the cleaning and lubricating charms in a hurry.  Then, his wand clattered to the floor, forgotten, as Draco flipped Harry back around to face the lockers.
Whereas the steps had been perfunctory and reckless from Harry, Malfoy made them feel fluid and practiced.  His turns were effortless; his timing was perfect—his hands were steady as they guided Harry through a dance that was as intoxicating as it was frightening.
It was the kind of jibe he made on instinct, but Potter’s eyes locked on his with something dark and pained.  Before he could even reconsider his words, a desk to Draco’s left exploded.
”  He glanced around again, drawing attention to the silence before continuing.  “Let them come ask for themselves.”
VOLDEMORT: I agree.  The jamón is not quite thin enough, so you have to exert a great deal of energy chewing.  The flavors are good though.  [He reaches for the next.]  Moving on… The rhubarb here is good – it pairs well with the strawberry.  The bits of ginger are a nice touch.
Draco contemplated it, the pleasant fog he’d been steeped in starting to drift and fade away.  “She won’t.  She has no reason to.”
He let go.  Opened his eyes.
GINNY: It’s not nearly done!  I’m going to run out of time…  [She glances around at the stations around her where the other bakers are patiently waiting for their breads.  DRACO pulls his out of the oven, and it is perfectly golden-brown and ready.]  *

But by that point, Sam was lingering by the door.  “Well, I didn’t know you had company, so I won’t stay and intrude anymore.  But thanks, Professor.  It did make me feel better about all this.”  He reached for the door handle then hesitated.  In a nervous twitch, he fiddled with his sleeve.  “You won’t…mention this to anyone, right?  I know it’s not good to keep it a secret forever, but for right now…”
was a daughter.
Draco heard the telltale crack of a breaking broom as he dodged the opponent’s feint.  The man went barreling into the ground in a halo of splinters.  Shit.
.  Apparently, that promise had been short-lived.  “Er, no actually.  I hadn’t.”  The polite smile felt stiff and forced on his face, and the lie cost him something to force out.
“Then why’d you ask to dance?” Harry finally erupted out of annoyance.  “
And by the time he’d had the thought to wish Harry a good night, the man was already long gone.
“So I gathered,” she responded tersely.  “How’s that going for you?”
Draco hooked a leg around Harry’s ankle and spun him to face the lockers before the man could resist.  He yanked the back of his trousers down to expose the round globes of his bum.
LUNA: It’s a competition?  I thought we were all baking for fun!
“It’s not like a crush or anything,” she said, surprising him.  “I mean, I think Kat’s the greatest, and she’s my best friend, but…”  Here, she took a deep breath.  “I just want to be like her.”
Draco descended the stairs into the basement.  He’d had no wand to check at the door, and the bartender had shot him a complicated look before stepping aside to let him pass.  That, more than anything thus far, knocked into him a sense of foreboding – a feeling that Bagman was clearly trying to dispel, as he chatted endlessly on the way down.
, they’d both be fed to Nagini.
– and he was forgoing his cues.
While he was still incredibly nervous about dueling Potter in front of a class, he had Occluded enough of his darker thoughts that he was buzzing with that fleeting sense of false confidence.  Even if he wasn’t planning to do anything stupid regarding Potter – he
“How’s the soup today, Malfoy?” he often asked.  “As fine as the summer gas-patchos you’re used to?”
He steadied himself with a handful of black hair, and Harry’s heavy-lidded expression was enough to drive Draco to the edge.  His eyes flicked up to meet Draco’s, and Draco tugged his head away with a desperate urgency.  “Harry, I’m going to… I’m close-”
“Er, Ginny, I… I mean…”  Harry scrambled to tuck away his still-softening dick.  The wet leather of his trousers made the task almost impossible.
“Huh,” Draco said.  “So earlier, then.  Why
With the attention so narrowly focused on his throat, Draco couldn’t help the sudden urge to swallow.  It sounded noisy and calamitous against the quiet.

Our hearts break all over again for the last one, as LUNA has been a fan-favorite since the beginning, with clever flavor combinations and adorable animal-themed decorations.  Her departure has also left us to the mercy of male stupidity, as the remaining sausagefest has descended into histrionics beyond the scope typical of this show.]

Harry’s eyes had been trained on his orange bowtie for a while, and Draco vowed he’d wear it every day if it had such power to capture his attention.  When he glanced up to meet his eyes, his gaze was guarded, but hopeful nonetheless.
From the look on Potter’s face, he’d picked up on the challenge in Draco’s words.
“Oh, but I can
Harry writhed a bit under his hands, shivering away and thrusting into them all at once.  “Draco, the spell-”
Oh, his embarrassment was
“I understand, Draco.  It’s fine.”
She looked up at him gratefully, then hefted her school-issued Nimbus 2001.  “Thanks.  I will.”  She sounded a little shaky, like the confession had affected her more than she pretended.
“I should make you pay for it.”
The unwavering sense of hopelessness could not be shaken by his obsessive focus, nor could he abuse his body enough for it to forget.  He was trapped – trapped in his own skin, a place he’d learned in the war was a terrible place to be.

“No, no, I didn’t mean it like that, I just meant you have pretty balls in the way they so delicately hang beside your UNCIRCUMCISED cock,” he said apologetically. “I have no right to make fun of your testicles; at least yours are symmetrical. Mine right one hangs at least an inch below my left one. It’s really messed up. I think there’s some kind of pulley device in there, cause if I pull my left nut, the right one comes up - and vice versa!”
The man ran a hand through his hair, making it stick up even further.  “It made sense in the moment.  I don’t know.”
A bubble of hilarity almost choked her on the way out.  “Min…miniature
He felt his eyes widening throughout the fervid rant, and at the end of it, realization dawned clear and amusing in his mind.  “Professor… Are you scared?”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked somewhat reservedly.
.  If he stepped outside, who would curse him?  If he quit, where would he go?
He peeled off his robes and then his shirt, and Draco felt a renewed spike of lust shoot through him at the sight.  “
[It cuts back to said bakers when LUNA’s slow-mo reprise has concluded.  HARRY and DRACO look even sourer than before as their chilling period verges into its second hour.  CEDRIC sips happily at a cup of tea – and seems to be perusing a wedding catalogue while he’s at it?]
“Well, why not?”
Draco froze, panicked thoughts eradicated by the force and shock of that exclamation.  Then, the red heat of a blush crawled to his cheeks, and he found himself masking it poorly beneath an ill-positioned hand.  “Well, I wasn’t sure I’d get another chance,” he muttered, not fully intending to.
Harry’s head came down a little deeper, and then he was pulling away quickly to cough.

Draco forced a laugh.  “No, of course not.  It’s just…I mean, surely you’ve heard?  He’s doing a terrible job as a professor!  McGonagall might even fire him, he’s doing so poorly.  Everyone’s complaining about it.”
“Right,” Draco concluded.  “I think this interview should wait until you’ve thought through your questions a little more.”  He turned to the cashier, who was so engaged in watching that she flinched as the attention shifted to her and forced her from her spectatorship.  “I’m sorry Miss, how much was it that I owed you?”
The others followed soon thereafter, several needing a few tries to get it through a hoop – some needing to fly up right in front of it.  But soon enough, everyone was onto the next phase and looping around each of the House towers in the stands on their way to the tall tree by the pitch.  There, they had to toss the quaffle through a magical, hovering ring that Draco had spelled to blaze purple when they got it successfully through.  Then, it would release one of the rain orbs that he’d stuck inextricably in the branches with magic.

“Okay,” he murmured, feeling rather sheepish about his reasons why.  He would try – there was no reason he could think of that he shouldn’t.
He hoped he didn’t sound too pleading.
He dragged a hand through his hair.  Fury was welling up in him, drowning the logic – drowning the pain.  He knew it was merely defensiveness, but he couldn’t stop the words that tore from his mouth in the next instant.  “It was just a stupid dance!”
But despite his resentment, there were good memories mixed in with the bad.  Ones that his father was party to, if not directly responsible for.  He was like a summer storm, Lucius – one where you never knew whether it was bringing a reliable rain or a savaging violence.
That was it.  Perhaps Potter…
Potter grasped his hand rather suddenly and used it to pull himself up.
NYMPHADORA: It’s Cedric.  It’s gotta be.
And Harry
The castle was cold this time of night, and Draco said as much to see what Harry would do to accommodate.  What he hadn’t expected was for the man to throw one thick blanket over the two of them, tangling their legs where they sat facing each other on the couch.  It was startlingly intimate, and it made Draco want to scream that they could have this
He smiled wryly, wondering what he had done to deserve such trust and admiration in his students.  “I’m sure I’ll manage.  And I still have time – get Max to come back and switch with me in another half an hour.”
Bagman brushed away his words with an air of false offense, “Sir?  None of this ‘sir’ nonsense, Draco, my boy!  We’re all
Reaching the starting point, the boys lobbed the rain orbs into the air, where their final teammates were waiting.  The girl on the left missed hers, which sent her team quickly into second as she dove to retrieve it.  The other caught hers with a practiced ease, and she took off towards the magical shield Draco had set up in the sky.  She tapped it with the rain orb and smiled as the whole shield glowed blue before she twisted to descend.
Draco took a moment to admire the delicious embarrassment coloring the man’s face.  He couldn’t help but keep poking at him, drawing attention to that inherent scruffiness that, Salazar be damned, he found so perversely attractive.  “Also, you’ve got lint – right there.  That’s another thing wrong with your attire today.  Doesn’t really exude professionalism, that.”
The man worked him open steadily, saying nothing if he thought it odd that Draco was too tight and jumpy for someone who claimed to have done this before.  When he deemed him loose enough, he lined his cock up, and Draco fought the urge to eat his previous words and leave.
beyond an archaic surname and a long, bloody past.  A clustered handful of the worst of choices.
Marla burst into tears, nodding as she picked up a book of her own, clutching it to her chest.  She cradled it like it was the most important thing in the world.
Harry was blushing furiously now – somehow unused to the attention, even after all these years.  Draco’s lips twisted into a sneer, annoyed by the way the crowd was affecting the man; only

BLAM!  Your worst fear greets you at the door.”
Draco didn’t have to guess to know what word he’d censored.  He slung an arm around Harry and pulled him into his side, exhaling as Harry relaxed against his shoulder.

He met Potter’s gaze and saw a flicker of relief there.

At quarter of two – still a full hour from their Ministry appointment – Draco Flooed into the Manor to meet his mother.  Though anxious like himself, she managed to cover her nerves with needless grooming, making him sit behind her in their en suite as she fiddled about before the mirror.  Draco counted six different adjustments to her hairstyle before he eventually lost track.
Harry’s mouth worked silently for several seconds before he seemed to find what he wanted to say.  And once he had, Draco wished –

” he held up the fingerless leather gloves and watched as Harry’s expression flickered from surprise to lust.  He slid them on deftly, securing the fasteners with controlled, practiced motions.  “Well, Potter,” he said, leaning close until Harry’s eyes fluttered shut in anticipation, then stopping.

.  Here, let’s get you out of the dungeons.”
Harry closed the remaining distance and dropped his radio onto the seat with a clang.  He sat on the Malfoy-side of it, using it as an excuse to sit somewhere in the middle without looking ultra-pushy.  Not that he wanted to look like a manspreader either, but oh well.
Draco repeated the length his mother had told him.  “At least he’s still an arse, or I’d know things were really serious,” he mused, startled by the sharp downturn of Harry’s lips at the comment.
“Fuck!  I should kill you
SEVERUS: What is going on over there?  Draco – no!
“You left home?  What did your parents think?”
Oh – this was the icing on the cake.
Draco stopped.
After a moment, Morpheus appeared at the top of the steps like he expected.  “
Tuesday afternoons were usually reserved for watching Quidditch practice, as it gave the 8th years an excuse to get fired up about the sport they weren’t allowed to participate in, as well as the opportunity to hide drinks under the bleachers and pass them around when McGonagall wasn’t looking.  Today was no exception, and the only divergence from the routine was that Harry showed up in a crop top with a boombox over his shoulder blasting Y.M.C.A. by the Village People.
“Yes, well, I think that’s enough dueling for one day,” Potter said in the most obvious misdirection he’d ever heard.  “And enough laughing.”
“Who?  The elves?”  His tone was pointed, given their shared history.
Draco nearly laughed aloud in revelation.  It felt incredible – that these hands that had thrown spells and punches at Harry could also wring out such pleasure felt unbelievable; that he could know someone’s body so intimately, an unforeseen miracle.
Propelled by the words, Draco stepped up into his space, then paused, unsure of how to proceed.  They’d just been screaming at each other, moments before.  He reached out a tentative hand, half-expecting it to be swatted away despite Harry’s words.  His palm met the man’s face unimpeded, and he ran it down the smooth glide of Harry’s jaw before moving closer.
Potter?  Surely-
Draco – and that thought had to be curbed before Draco could come in a confusing mix of heat and tenderness.

Well, it was a dueling club.  Perhaps they could just duel it all out; it was the only plan he’d had that made any kind of sense, after all.  Potter certainly hadn’t reacted well to his other plans, like “levelheaded communication” or “attempts at apology.”

CEDRIC: She is!  I’m going to present it to her right after we’re done.  So I’m hoping to do so as winner.
“I can’t say I’ve really had the chance to practice much,” Draco said carefully, apprehensive about where this was going.
“Everything is fine!”
“Potter, are you-” he began as the enigma himself patted furiously at a juice stain with his napkin.

Draco stared after her, bemused, for a few seconds before resuming his walk to the Hospital Wing.

No matter – he would lure him.  He drew Harry in with a smirk that promised he knew exactly what he was doing.  “They can wait five minutes,” he declared.
But by now, Draco’s reality was so mixed up with his assumptions that he couldn’t tell if the emphasis was genuine or defensive.  “Harry, it’s okay if you are-”

“Draco, please,” Harry choked out.  “Please, not again,” and something in Draco broke at those words.
“More,” the man groaned, and Draco didn’t hesitate.
He looked momentarily startled.  “Th-thanks.  What time is it?”
He didn’t even know if she had
“Yeah, whatever, Malfoy.  Let’s see if you’re still laughing later when no one is convinced by your overdone acting.”
He swooped in and planted a kiss on Draco’s cheek that left him stunned and smug in equal parts.

He could feel all the eyes in the courtroom on him.  Analyzing this new information and comparing it to what they saw in front of them.  Given how he looked, they would surely distrust the praise.  Some shifted their disappointed glances to Potter, and that made Draco’s stomach clench with dread.
Vaguely, he could hear them taking off around him as he arrived in front of the Green Flash.  Or what was left of it, anyway.

.  He traced the outline of the bruise, and the breath he took was jagged.
Draco sighed, letting his irritation – which was really just nerves – drain away.  “Yes, I think that’s fair.”  He pulled his knee pads from the locker and began clipping them on with speed, as he realized it was almost time to go out there.  “Hey, pass me my goggles.”
VOLDEMORT: You’ve done well today, Draco.  I can’t say I was expecting it, but it seems like you learned an important lesson at a very opportune time.  [He glances fleetingly over at HARRY, and DRACO follows suit with a nervous gulp.]
“Is that what you’ll do, my traitorous offspring?” he continued, eyes never leaving Draco.  “Sic the Aurors on me?  Get

Potter was explaining the bowing bit now.  He described it – once more, in only the barest of Wizarding terms – then drew his wand with a glance.  Draco took this as a cue to draw his as well, keeping it light and loose in his grip.
He recalled one particular dream that he’d startled from during the war.  How his pleasure had faded to horror, and he’d clapped his hands over his mouth until he couldn’t breathe.  What if he’d spoken in his sleep?  What if the Dark Lord had

He nodded, not daring to meet her eyes.

also keeping Harry and his father apart so they didn’t kill each other.
Draco’s face was flushed with embarrassment, “Is that my nickname now? Pretty balls? Just because I have had a completely hairless scrotum my entire life? That’s not funny. Truthfully, I’m very sensitive about that.”
That was fine.  Draco had the upper hand – he knew more than he had before; he knew Potter was

“What if you ‘fuck yourself up’ and don’t have a wand to fix things?” Draco asked, finding a shred of his former boldness.
The Three Broomsticks was moderately crowded, seeing as it was noon and in the midst of its lunch rush.  Harry wasted no time in pulling them into a discreet corner booth, eyes roving to catalogue any unwanted audience, and then relaxing enough to engage in romantic date conversations like “what did

Harry froze.

She smiled with a snort.  “Well, as a Head of House, dancing around the common room with your students is your solemn duty.”  She said it so seriously that he began to panic that it
by the end of the lesson, including Sam.  Though, for Draco, that made his feeble attempts all the more humiliating.  He tried thinking back on those warm memories of his mother, the way the two of them would primp before a gala once Father was safely out of the room.  He thought about the way she’d coo about “her little Gemini” and tell him the legends of each constellation before bed.  In those moments, he could see the glow of the spell beginning at the tip of his wand.
Fine.
Harry looked sheepishly relieved, though Draco had the grace not to call him on it.  “Alright – just thought I’d offer.  I’m going out with Ron and Hermione tonight anyway.”
Draco inspected his nails as Harry drove himself to madness.  It was all part of the game.  “The boy made many comments.”  He could feel the frustration crackling in the air and smirked.

Grant tapped his wand to Draco’s ribs, and even that slight touch made him crumple with the pain.  “
Instead of protesting it like he’d imagined, Malfoy’s face went incredulous before breaking into a devious smirk.  “Kept a record of me, did you?”  He leaned against the wall, crossing his arms with a casual grace that left Harry’s mouth dry.
Malfoy was there too, of course.

“Yes,” he whispered back, and the word sent a thrill up Draco’s spine.  It unlocked a well of possibilities.

He could see Harry turning that over in his head.  “Wait, but if you’ve been disinherited for a year, why did they make you go explain yourself after that article came out?”
, but Harry was in a jumpy sort of mood anyway, so it didn’t surprise him to see.
Harry nodded, overcome with bliss. Draco wrapped his thicc lips around Harry’s wide cock tip and sucked it clean.
Which really must’ve been the final straw, because then Draco was breaking into hysterical laughter and cursing under his breath as he tried to speak.  “Are you kidding me?  You still don’t get it?  I always knew you were thick, but this is really too much!”  Harry’s confused expression drove him on, more furiously than before.  “I’m not mad about the article,
