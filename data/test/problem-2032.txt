“Seems like she’ll be an active child. Ready to train her for Quidditch?” he comments, grinning at her.
Some of the lines are smudged, and there is a faint coffee stain at the corner. Harry traces the outline of Draco's figure, and then glances at his own signature and the date. It feels like an eternity ago when he first saw Draco sing.
Draco nibbles on the chips as he turns over the possibilities of tonight. He's so lost in thought that he jumps when Potter, in a loose T-shirt and baggy knee-length shorts, emerges. There's a towel slung around his neck, and he uses it to pat his damp hair as he walks towards Draco.
To which Draco had replied, with his hair messy from lying on the couch and his lips turned up into a sleepy smile that made Harry's heart skip a beat, "Because I wanna be the first thing you see when you come home."
He feels Malfoy's hesitant fingers graze the back of his neck and his lips moving slightly. Harry slides a hand down Malfoy's body, finally resting on his hip to pull him closer. This must've encouraged Malfoy, for he sighs, wraps both arms around Harry's neck, buries his fingers in Harry's hair and finally, finally returns the kiss, ramping it up and making it so heart-stoppingly intense that all of Harry's synapses begin firing at full cylinders.
Harry normally did the shopping. Last Sunday, Draco had removed the shopping list written in Harry’s handwriting from the fridge and added to it. It was strange entering the shops without Harry, but he had made his purchases without breaking down at the treacle tart aisle.
"There isn't a body. It was an explosion that killed them. The Ministry will be holding a memorial service, of course."
Pork Chop lifts her head up from his chest briefly, before plonking back down in a show of exasperation. "You've got it wrong, you great big knob."
He's not going to last long, and Potter seems to know it as he jacks up the pace, hitting all the sweet spots that make Draco's eyes roll back and starbursts of fever-pitch ecstasy explode in Draco's body.
"Draco?!" Harry yelps, his eyes wide and his jaw slack in astonishment. "I thought the owl looked familiar…"
"You brought me here, which indicates you've got a craving for proper pub food. This leaves us with... hmm... steak and mushroom pie, bangers and mash, fish and chips or sirloin steak." Draco frowns as he considers the choices. "Pie is out, because you told Weasley earlier that you're not in the mood for pie. I've seen you pick bangers and mash, along with fish and chips more than sirloin steak, but then again, we don't serve steak often in the canteen. Which leaves me with either the bangers or the fish..."
It was the most tumultuous period of their lives; a war that boys like them shouldn’t have been involved in. It was a time when they fought from opposing ends. Yet, here they are now, standing in a tattoo parlour and talking about some semblance of a future together.
His words have hit the mark. He has missed many occasions, notably Draco's birthday because of this, spending the night in Manchester instead.
But if he had looked back for just one second, he would have seen how Malfoy had slid down to the ground, as if the kiss had sapped all of his remaining energy, might have even heard Malfoy's whisper of
"Live a little. I’ve ended work and you spent the afternoon writing a tough article," Potter coaxes, leaning back on the bike and folding his arms across his chest.
The guitar stops playing. Harry leaves the living room and heads out to the balcony (which is magicked to be much larger than the fire escapes in No-Maj buildings) of his rented high-rise flat, where he can best hear the singing. When the music starts, he casts a sound amplifying charm towards his neighbour. Harry sits down on a chair, facing the sprawling Manhattan skyline.
"Harry!" Draco shouts when he bursts into the plaza, a few steps away from the bench where Harry was sitting just minutes ago. He runs a frantic loop around the plaza, his chest heaving and drenched hair plastered to the nape of his neck.
Or more accurately, Potter’s kissing him while Draco stands there limply in his arms, his mind still reeling with the shock of it all, Merlin, is this a dream, because— oh, and Potter’s pulling away, looking rather flustered.
"Yeah. I am. But only to him. Others will probably bid for me, but the only person that can get me will be Malfoy. Let the organisers know that. No one else can win me. Only Draco Malfoy."
They stop a distance away from the main doors, and Draco turns to the gardens. Even though they have been abandoned and the overgrown shrubs and small trees are in need of a good trimming, the flowers are still breathtakingly beautiful, thanks to the imbued magic buried into the earth itself. Blooming spots of colour — yellow, red, white and powder-blue flowers dot the fields, and Draco smiles at the view. Despite the gardens being fully capable of taking care of themselves, Mother always liked to putter about in her gardening clothes and large sun hat, while a young Draco would toddle behind her, assisting with small tasks like planting seeds and watering flowers.
Suddenly self-conscious, Harry pats his hair to tame it into some semblance of submission. As he leads Malfoy towards the drawing room, he mutters Cleaning Charms over the mud that the Quidditch team had tracked on the floorboards. The house is rather messy, Harry has to admit: there are soft toys, crayons, picture-books and Lego blocks heaped on the tables, along with parchment and school textbooks that belonged to the older kids. There are coats flung on the backs of armchairs and boots piled on the foot of the stairs. An entire wall of the living room is devoted to drawings that his kids have done, while framed photographs of his loved ones — Hermione and Ron, the Weasleys, his friends from school and of course, all of his kids — jostle for space on the mantelpiece.
“I should go,” Draco mutters. His rational mind finally catching up — there ought to be rules about fraternising within the faculty — he wraps his arms around himself and quickly shuffles away from Potter.
"Nope, that's not how it works." Charlie grins. "And you should talk, being one yourself, years ago. Does it actually count if you didn’t finish the Academy proper?" He pauses, then dismisses the question. "Well, you're here now, and you're gonna do your usual terrorising of the first-years."
As in, he literally drops everything — the trays clatter to the floor — turns tail and runs away to the kitchens, and it all happened so fast that Harry is left staring at the swinging doors.
"No, I don't. But I'm willing to try most things, mmmm, the more I think about it, the more I definitely want to try that. That's the most pleasure you’ve had? Well, Harry, I'm gonna triple that tonight and every night. I want you to bend me over a park bench at night, and you're fucking me so good I'm screaming. You've seen a jogger around, perhaps a few other couples about, and you know you should stop before anyone catches us, but you can't, 'cos you feel so good in me, I'm so good for you, so damn good," Malfoy whispers, his voice low and smoky, dripping with sex and syrup.
As Malfoy sets up, Harry flips through his sketchbook. He huffs in frustration at the half-finished drawings of buildings and scenery. He spent a few hours that afternoon at a café in Central Park with his sketchbook, watercolours and canvas, but the only thing he achieved was sharing a shy smile with a rather fit blond bloke two tables away, and stuffing himself full of pastries and weak tea.
"Oh, really? What's left for you here? Besides your misguided notion of familial duties, your ill father and demanding mother? What future do you have after Hogwarts?" Harry snaps, enjoying the way Malfoy swallows doubtfully.
Potter waits for her to leave the pantry before continuing. "What d'you think?" he asks Draco, bright and earnest green eyes peering out from a fringe of tousled hair. "D'you want to try it long-distance? See how it goes?"
"No, so fuckin' tight, so hot, didn't think you'd be so good, fuck this is so real, your arse and your cock, we look so good together, I gotta fuck, please, Harry, I'll make it so good for you, so good you wouldn't
A piece of his aching heart will always be reserved for Malfoy, just like how a corner of Malfoy's heart will always have Harry’s name carved on it.
"Father's mellowed out quite a bit after his heart attack," Draco says. "Besides, I suggested having the dinner outside, away from the Manor. I’m certain that would make it more comfortable."
"It's my Dragonite!" she declares, flashing him a toothy grin. "My brother threw my Pokémon away because I didn't let him eat my ice-cream!"
Potter looks surprised and a bit wary, but he stands his ground. "Late night, Malfoy? Didn't catch you at breakfast this morning."
“Harry,” Malfoy whispers into his ear. “So fucking hot when you speak Parseltongue. I love it, fuckin’ love it.”
"You're gonna be here, in between my legs and sucking me off with that pretty little mouth of yours. Cheeks hollowed out, blond hair all messy and fuck, whenever you look at me with those sexed-up eyes with my cock in between your lips, I lose it, Draco, I fucking lose it—" Harry's rambling now, and Draco's hand matches his speed and intensity.
"Oh, really?" Draco arches a brow. He pulls his tea closer to his chest and gazes at the tealeaves, wondering why his heart gave a small leap at the news. He looks up after a moment. "No one else? I would've thought someone else would have snapped you up in no time."
This time, their kiss is certain and confident. Draco's lips part at once for Potter to deepen the kiss. He wastes no time in wrapping his arms around Draco, his fingers threading through blond strands. Potter's stubble scratches against Draco's cheeks, and Draco skims his palms over Potter's broad chest, a moan escaping his lips. All that time admiring from afar, and now he can finally touch. He winds his arms around Potter's shoulders and squeezes, grinning into the kiss when Potter grunts and hauls him closer.
This very moment, crackling with pent-up sexual anticipation and energy, stretched as taut as a rope, lingers between them, as they simply stare at each other.
They're so busy staring at each other that Harry doesn't notice the stunning spell flying towards him, hitting the floor just centimetres away from his leg, cracking the tile. He leaps up at once, his hand snapping to his wand.
"Is that what he did?" George says in the sternest voice that he can muster. He frowns at Harry, and Harry deflates in front of him.
Draco agrees to the latter option, and they're off again, scrambling with their hands covering their heads in the short distance from the gardens back to the street. They can’t cast Impervius Charms on themselves, if not the Muggles might get suspicious, but at least most of the way was sheltered.
"And now, you're going out with another Gryffindor," Charlie says, winking. "Perhaps we'll make you, the Head of Slytherin, an honorary Gryffindor soon, yeah?"
Harry watches him go, sighing dreamily at Malfoy's pert arse and long legs. Harry glances at the counter, where Malfoy had bent him over and shagged him silly. Fuck, he had come right at this very spot—
"Don't be so surprised, Potter," Malfoy says, looking back at Harry and sneering. "That's how life is for us. Sure, men love the whole bad-boy act, but off the stage and out of the costumes, that's how it is, and that's how I've learnt to live."
Harry turns around in Draco's arms to face him. "Yeah. That… that would be great," he says, touched at Draco's thoughtfulness. He grins suddenly. "Besides, it's the Burrow next month for you, yeah?"
But their kisses are even more passionate and desperate than usual, going straight to Harry's heart, made even worse when Malfoy climbs on top of him and lets out a pained sound, a cross between a sigh and a sob.
Although Malfoy isn't dressed in a Muggle suit, he still looks drop-dead gorgeous. He's wearing a grey shirt, paired with a black robe thrown casually over his shoulders, reaching down to his knees. The robe is fastened on the base of Malfoy's throat with a black and green brooch emblazoned with the Malfoy crest. The chain of a pocket watch peeks out from the pocket of his black trousers, and his polished shoes shine in the sunlight.
!" he cries, when his shouts have no effect. Draco is still unconscious, his body as limp as a rag doll, his head lolling back. Harry presses two fingers to the inside of Draco's wrist — his pulse is thin and thready. "Two bottles, what were you thinking?!" he rages, his worry morphing into full-blown panic.
A long moment passes, and George presses his lips together to contain his croon of delight when their faces move closer, their lips inching nearer and nearer...
"What? You can't be serious!" he says, astonished. He puts the bag down and stares at Harry, his mind whirring. "I've got a meeting tomorrow morning, and I'm certain all of the Portkeys going to Paris today are unavailable!"
"Yes. I picked up Muggle music in France," Malfoy offers shortly. Before Harry can ask more, Malfoy gestures to the umbrella. "I assume that's why you're here."
In a smooth, fluid motion, Draco pushes away Potter’s grabby hands. “You can have me anyway you want, but only if you catch me.” He punctuates his words with a playful laugh and a wave of Potter’s glasses. He whirls around and struts away, his grin widening at Potter’s agitated huff,
Draco twines another mouthful of spaghetti Bolognese around his fork and eats it. The pasta is too soft, the sauce too bland and watery, and the flavour of rosemary and oregano too weak. He doesn't understand why; he followed Harry's recipe down to the exact measurement as if he was crafting a potion, but it doesn't taste the same anymore.
Harry comes first. He spurts all over Malfoy's hand, his stomach clenching and mind hazy with the spine-tingling pleasure. Malfoy stares at him, and then cries out his name, shooting his load on Harry's hips and cock. Their synchronised breaths emerge hot and heavy, and Harry tucks two fingers under Malfoy's chin.
the welcoming party, because being reminded of Voldemort and getting eyed up by old enemies crawling out of the woodwork on a pleasant Monday morning was so not on.
Draco cries out with need. With his heart pounding, he realises what Harry's going to do and he's suddenly so desperate for it-
"Oh, that?" Potter says lightly after swallowing. "I wouldn't call that dessert, it's more of an... appetiser." He smacks his lips, his tongue peeking out of his mouth to lick away leftover chocolate. "I think it's time for dessert now," he says. There's desire scrawled all over his eyes as he stares in hunger at Draco's semi-erection.
"I think I ought to tell you this," Hermione says, taking a deep breath. "Years ago, over dinner in Osaka, when you asked us whether Malfoy asked after you, I lied and said that he didn't."
Two days have passed, and he still can't stop replaying that moment, and the fact that Harry didn't kiss back. Draco shakes his head to clear his mind and returns to his book.
Potter's eyes widen, and he bites his lower lip, as if stopping himself from saying something inappropriate. “Er… because you tidy houses and my house needs tidying?"
"Sorry, Mr Potter!" yells a horrified Ravenclaw a few pairs away. Harry waves back, signalling that it's alright. The students quieten down at the outburst, craning their heads to look at Harry.
"Don't think like that, Potter. You make wonderful desserts and don't let anyone tell you otherwise," Malfoy declares. Harry's pleasantly surprised at the vehemence in his tone.
amazing, but treacle tart coupled with Malfoy might probably be Harry's most favourite thing... Harry quickly swipes the dessert from Malfoy and places it on the table. The other man merely arches a brow in amusement and they finally sit down to dinner. Harry pours red wine into their glasses and pulls his own glass towards him. He takes a few bites of the pasta and catches Malfoy looking at his food and...
"Are you really going to?" Charlie grins, although he’s still tugging on his dragon earring. "It's about bloody time, then."
Draco gulps when he recalls the Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement, when he was screaming into Potter's ear, holding him tight. Besides the Astronomy Tower, the Room is another area he avoided, although he has entered it a few times with Filius to conduct some repairs.
Eyes closed, Harry and Draco rest their foreheads together, clinging to each other for a comfort that only either can give to the other.
Of course, Draco knows about those Muggle contraptions, thanks to his students. Even though they're useless at Hogwarts, he has noticed students using them the minute they exit the train. Moreover, everyone is on their phones in Muggle Paris.
One day, Draco received a large chocolate hamper delivered by two exhausted eagle owls (all the way from his favourite chocolatier in France!), and the faculty got so excited they could barely eat their dinner.
It's been eight months since he last saw Draco, but the memories are still as vivid as yesterday, as if Harry has pressed each one carefully and tenderly onto his heart, like precious flowers preserved between pages of journals. He tried to move on from New York, he tried so
- when you came, you screamed my name... you gotta... do... 'sall I've been thinkin' of," Potter slurs in between pants, hooking his arms snugly around Draco's waist and pulling him even closer.
At his emphasis on the last two words, Malfoy bites his lower lip. He deposits his bottle on the table, holding his heated gaze with Harry.
Harry recalls the stricken expression on Malfoy's face in the classroom. He swallows, keeping his tone light and his features neutral. "I dunno, Hermione. I might leave earlier than expected. I might not even stay for the Leaving Ball."
Malfoy is wearing jeans under his apron — tight, dark-blue Muggle jeans that hug his pert arse and highlight the length of those fantastic legs. Harry's eyes trace the long, lean line of Malfoy's body, the straight back with the perfect posture (so unlike Harry who has a terrible habit of slouching), the pale forearms (the only blemish is his Mark) with the sleeves of his white shirt rolled up to his elbows; even though he works in the canteen, Malfoy is always impeccably dressed. Harry's gaze drops to the curve of his arse again, and he swallows when his fevered imagination conjures a fantasy of Malfoy, wearing only his apron, bent over the counter and begging for him.
Although the uniform, along with the job, isn’t glamourous at all, Draco is determined to not let Potter see him as a slob that had given up. He’d charmed his hairnet to match his hair colour, used spells to tailor his apron to fit his frame, and refreshes the wrinkle- and stain-free charms on his clothes every night.
"You big sap," Draco says affectionately. He takes out his wand, and after ensuring that no one is looking, quickly duplicates a lock and removes the original engraving.
Working on a scene as busy as this has its pros and cons — inspiration might be at every corner, but it's difficult to sift through the noise and highlight something special. Should he paint a landscape, or focus on something different, like a story? There are photos of bridges, fountains and sculptures of the park on his camera, each with their own tale.
"I didn't," Harry throws over his shoulder as he stumbles away from the bar and hurries out of the club. Grateful for the fresh air and cessation of thumping music, he goes back to the alleyway to meet Bacon.
“Me too. How you touched me like this.” Malfoy reaches behind and guides Harry’s palms to his arse. Harry groans into his neck as he kneads that gorgeous arse, still as firm and lush as before. “How I touched you like this.” Malfoy frees the bottom of Harry’s shirt from his trousers and trails a heated hand up Harry’s abdomen, fingers grazing the trail of dark hair leading southwards. “Salazar, you’re even fitter now.”
Harry simply stands there, confusion rioting through him. Did Malfoy just come all the way out to snipe at
They return to their table soon with their desserts. Harry keeps it simple with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream on a bed of thick and sugary waffle, complete with a hearty drizzle of fudge sauce. Malfoy indulges himself with a pile of toppings — strawberries, Nutella, bananas and salted caramel sauce. They tuck into their food, and Harry laughs at the sight of Malfoy with Nutella smeared all over his mouth. Sure, he has pristine table manners most of the time, but Malfoy’s sweet tooth sends all of that flying out the window when it comes to desserts.
George doesn't know whether to bang his head against the nearest solid surface in frustration or to dissolve into fits of laughter. He quickly composes himself and strolls around the corner with a nonchalant air.
Charlie says — but he can't fall for Potter again without knowing that he returns Draco’s affections, until he's sure it doesn’t revolve around sex.
It's the sight of Malfoy and Greengrass standing together in their wedding attire, the sight of their joined hands that propel Harry’s limbs back to life. Steeling himself, he lurches onwards, walking down the aisle. The whispers intensify, and some of them are craning their necks for a better look. Undeterred, Harry fastens his eyes solely on Malfoy, who stares back, his eyes widening in shock and jaw going slack.
, the pressure in his pants is driving him wild because he's imagining his own tongue tracing Malfoy's body just like the snake; Harry desperately wants to know how Malfoy sounds like when he's touching himself-
"Although at times like these, I wonder why I do," Harry mumbles, kicking a parchment ball with his shoe.
There's nothing else that Draco can do except hold Harry as tightly as he can, hoping that his touch says the words that he can't.
Harry reaches over to the small table to grab something. It appears to be four tickets. He places two tickets on the bench, and Draco looks at the remaining two clasped in Harry’s hand — these are tickets for the London Zoo dated in the year 1999.
Overwhelmed with emotion, Harry hangs onto every word, chuckling when some of the lyrics reference their time in New York. When the song finishes, Draco launches into his usual introduction.
"You do," Harry insists, a landslide of emotions — protectiveness, hope, nervousness, worry, sympathy — tumbling within him. "You deserve my love, you deserve Pansy, Blaise, Greg, everyone. You deserve happiness and everything that the world can give you."
"Two years." Draco isn't surprised at the location considering his connections to a few papers in America. But it’s still disappointing, knowing that he'll be away from Potter for so long, right after they've started something.
After he was done grappling with his sexuality at the age of nineteen, he couldn't stop thinking about Malfoy's dick, wondering how big it could get when fully engorged and whether it could fit entirely in Harry. It doesn't help that Malfoy's a bloody good-looking bloke, too.
"Yes, I was worried when Parkinson told me they took you away! I come right down to see you having a cup of tea with Andrew! She lied to me!"
Draco catches a whiff of pastries baking — something chocolate, his favourite — from a nearby cafe. In his distraction, he almost gets his feet mowed over by a trolley. He jumps back and stares at the teenager behind the trolley, who had been tapping her wand on her mobile phone.
Desire circulates in Draco’s body like a drug, and he feels bubbly and light, as if someone uncorked a champagne bottle in his chest. Part of him can’t believe it, but the taste of tea on Potter's tongue, the texture of the carpet under Draco's hands and the slightly chapped feeling of Potter's lips against his own...
Millicent gives Draco a thumbs-up, while Weasley releases a mournful bellow, even though he must have known about their relationship from Hermione or Potter himself. "Bloody hell, now he's not only friends with my fiancée, he's going out with my best mate!"
Draco pulls the bag of crisps closer to him and fishes around for a decently sized piece. "I haven't had the time. Even if I do leave London, it's for work or to visit my parents in Florence. Paris is just one of those things that I like to think of. I'll visit it someday," he says, popping a crisp into his mouth.
Draco withdraws slightly. His right hand cups the remaining length of cock that's not in his mouth, it’s just a bit more, fuck, but he doesn't think he can do it. He opens his eyes, and is rewarded with the hottest sight in his life — Potter's completely
Harry snorts in amusement. "What's that supposed to mean? I gotta… slay a Hippogriff and present it to your parents or something like that?" He jokes, chortling.
Draco wouldn’t forget the way Weasley’s smile had faded, along with the hard look entering his eyes, anytime soon.
He turns his chair back towards Harry, who is facing the stove and humming a tune. His eyes roam over Harry’s frame, especially at his shirt stretched over broad shoulders and the tendons shifting under Harry’s forearms as he raises the kettle to pour water into the mugs. Harry turns around, holding two mugs of steaming hot tea. He puts the mugs down. Sighing, he pulls off his foggy glasses and lifts up the hem of his shirt to wipe the condensation away.
"Fuck, Malfoy, your cock," Potter marvels and tilts his head to admire it from all angles, his hand descending to squeeze his own cock. Draco knows he's supposed to be pleased at Potter's reaction, but he knows how things usually end: he's had men with similar reactions, as if Draco's cock is Merlin's gift to wizardkind, but the minute they tried to fuck, it was either too thick, too hard or too long, or worse — all three.
good-looking young man with messy black hair and cheerful blue eyes. Harry notices a sculpted physique; all broad shoulders and bulging biceps. The rest of him looks pretty good too, Harry thinks, sending an appreciative gaze down the man's lower body.
"No," Draco says. "My apologies for our disturbance at this late hour, but the castle has locked us out of our rooms.”
"So now what? I expect to be hauled to the Ministry for questioning any day now, because this damned club is in my name? You
"Eh, Hermione and I think it's bound to happen sooner or later," Ron says dismissively, biting into his sausage. "Doesn't mean we're entirely alright with it, but you're our best friend. Would help if you'd stop denying it, to be honest."
It took two days for the tabloids to get wind of the society wedding that never happened, and Harry glimpsed the magazine headlines at the news-stand outside the Ministry. The backlash doesn't bother him. He never hid his sexuality, knowing that British tabloids mention him when they see him with other blokes on the streets in other countries.
A burst of warmth spreads in Draco, bolstered when Potter cheers and coaxes Charlie into a drunken rendition of
“First, I'd like the bloke that I'm going out with to call me by my first name. Merlin knows you've moaned it enough during sex."
"We've seen you dance and we want to take you home... together. You up for that?" The blond offers between nibbles of Harry's earlobe as the three of them rub up against each other.
When he suddenly hears the flare of the Floo and Harry’s voice calling out his name, Draco scrambles to replace the ring back to its original position in Harry’s drawer. As Harry’s footsteps trudge closer, he looks around the room with wild eyes and settles for draping himself sexily across their bed.
"But it was difficult, confronting my past," Draco continues. "I was wary of doing something so drastic, so I left for Florida — somewhere sunny and bright, somewhere with no memories of you. I found someone there to talk to, a Muggle lady called Louisa. I omitted details of the wizarding world, of course, kept it as vague as possible. Things got better, to my surprise. I was advised to avoid contacting you until I sorted things out." He looks at the painting of the Empire State Building. "And then I received your invitation, and despite my sessions with Louisa, I knew I had to go."
"All this just 'cos you don't know when to stop drinking," Harry mutters and swings the door open. He casts a
Potter’s hopeful face falls, and he hesitates before smiling back. He looks down at his bowl, pushing cornflakes around with his spoon in a rather disappointed air.
His grey eyes half-lidded, Malfoy begins to take each chocolate-dipped finger in his mouth, his Adam's apple bobbing as he sucks, tongue peeking out every so often to lick at a fingertip or at the web of skin in between his fingers. Harry imagines having that hot wet tongue and perfect pink lips licking other... things.
"Christmas, snow and presents are her favourite things," Malfoy says, with an affectionate smile. "And mine too," he adds, eyes still glued on the picture.
This dizzying, overwhelming spectrum of emotions: a growing joy soaring through him like a bird taking to sunny blue skies, a shatter of disbelief and a squirm of unease
Draco's still staring at the tape recorder while the sound of Harry pulling off his underwear crackles through the recorder.
It took a long time after the War for Pansy to be able to wear that heirloom in public, and it was thanks to her partnership with Potter.
Ron and Hermione share a look, one that puts him on edge. She takes Harry’s hand, and leads him to his painting chair. She perches on the rickety chair that Harry uses to hold his palette, while Ron and Dean stand behind her.
“Yeah,” Harry rasps, his voice hoarse. “You taste so fuckin’ good.” His cock throbs in urgency, and he pushes his hips up, making his desperation known.
Potter straightens up at Draco’s blush. “Sorry, am I making you uncomfortable? During Quidditch training, we kinda just strip down like that in the showers.”
Draco knows bits and pieces about Potter’s childhood, titbits of information revealed by Potter himself during their time together in the Academy. He knows that his Muggle relatives didn’t treat him well, but he’s hardly privy to the full extent of things, not having wanted to push Potter too much on such an intensely private matter.
With that, he slides in a circle on the table, draws himself to full height and poses, throwing Parvati a flirtatious wink.
“Haven’t had you in so long, been so busy with exams. More,” he demands. Soon, he’s riding Potter’s fingers, stretching himself wide. When he’s ready, they shift in Minerva’s chair. Potter leans back and opens his legs, his leaking cock so hard and perfect, and Draco’s arse clenches at the prospect of fucking himself on that gorgeous prick. He wriggles his hips forward, trying to get into a good position to ride Potter, but—
"Did you just..." He stares at a mortified Malfoy, who has a hand clapped to his mouth, his eyes wide. Harry slowly turns to Ron. "Did he just..."
"Yeah. After we stunned her, we used Sleeping Draughts to keep her in the Forest. We waited a day for more Keepers to arrive. They brought her back to Romania, the same way we transported dragons for the Triwizard Tournament." Charlie looks down, tugging at his earring. "It'll take some time, but she'll be fine, especially when her nesting instinct fades. She loved Everest, and Everest loved her.” He looks at Potter’s injuries, and mumbles another guilty apology.
Harry tries again. This time, he manages to slide his entire finger in. He moves it in and out, studying Malfoy's expression to know when to push and ease off, until Malfoy's hips are rocking together with him. When he asks for more in a soft, breathy voice, Harry adds a second finger, going even slower.
Yet Draco has never lost his temper or surrendered when his clients tearfully request an adjourning of the session. He usually leaves the room to grant them some breathing space, but he wouldn't postpone it. Instead, he’d sit with them as they stumbled down memory lane. If needed, he made them tea and listened with a patient and attentive ear as they reminisced about halcyon days of the past.
, but even before the letters have fully dissolved, another word has already formed, completing Draco's sentence.
"Then don't," Harry whispers, promptly wrapping Malfoy up in his arms and kissing his smile all over again.
He smiles as he flips through his notes — he had barely answered any of the questions, instead doodling on the margins of the parchment. The entire workshop had made no sense to him, but Draco had been grateful for his company.
"Need you on me, need that mouth, you made such a mess, gotta clean me up good yeah?" Draco says between moans as Harry flicks his tongue out and touches the tip of his tongue to Draco's slit.
Harry hesitates and says the first thing that leaps to his mind. "If you win, I'll make breakfast for you."
On second thought, everything seems terribly underwhelming, and Harry shuffles his feet in embarrassment. What was he thinking? He should've offered to show Malfoy photos of his completed works first, rather than these half-baked paintings. "It all looks rather amateurish, yeah?" he says self-deprecatingly, rubbing the back of his neck. "I might scrap it all and start over.”
Malfoy’s lips curl into a familiar sneer at once, like a reflex action. “Go back, go away!” he snarls, and promptly slams the door in Harry’s face.
Draco's heart is fluttering in his chest, surprise surging in his veins. He can hardly believe that this is happening.
Witch Weekly?-, but his retort wilts on his lips when Potter tucks a finger under his chin, a brilliant sort of intensity glimmering in his eyes that tells Draco what he’s about to do-
"He's never given me any sort of hint, and I don't want to make things weird if he says no. We've just got comfortable with each other," Harry mumbles, more to his biscuit than to George. He looks up, worrying at his lower lip. "D'you think he'll say yes, with our history?"
Malfoy stumbles forward and drags Harry along. They crash into a bedroom and Malfoy immediately pulls Harry towards his bed.
The sound of flesh slapping against flesh, the slither of his tie against Draco's spine, their combined cries and gasps and yells of
“Or was it that love note in third year that you folded into a crane and then blew it over to me like an angel? Stellar job at bullying, Malfoy, absolutely stellar.”
“As long as it can still fit in my mouth.” Malfoy runs his fingertips over Harry’s inner thighs, and Harry’s hips jerk involuntarily, a groan escaping his throat. Malfoy’s eyes twinkle with delight at his responsiveness.
Draco grabs Potter by the hand and pulls him back to the living room. He slams the window closed and shoves Potter towards it, pressing Potter's chest to the glass. As if he knows what Draco is thinking, Potter raises his arms and winds the sheer chiffon drapes around his wrists. Fuck, Potter looks amazing: hands restrained by the curtains, shoulders heaving, the muscles on his back rippling, legs wide apart and his arse, God, that
. Harry, who whistled while making breakfast and wearing nothing but his favourite red boxers with Snitches on them. Harry, who never capped the toothpaste lid properly after using it, who snored when he was especially tired after a long day. Harry, with his sunbeam of a smile so bright that it could chase away all of Draco's ghosts. Harry, who went absolutely mad for Draco's treacle tart (the only thing that Draco learnt how to make from Molly)...
"Sorry!" Harry turns around properly and shoots an apologetic look at Jacob. With a long-suffering, yet good-natured sigh, he repairs the glass and Vanishes the mess. While he goes about preparing a new drink, Harry sneaks a quick glance at the other patrons — they're all watching Malfoy, bottles of alcohol neglected at the bar — one of the men's trying to take a pull from his Firewhiskey but he misses the lip of the bottle entirely, splashing Firewhiskey all over his lap.
Draco had then left for work, talking about a lunch appointment with a supplier. He looked like he wanted to say more, and something in his expression softened before he left.
"But it means I'll stop him from making this mistake. Or at least postpone it, shake some sense into him. I can't stand it, Hermione. Him lying to himself, living a life of denial. I’ve thought about it for ages, and I know what I felt in Barcelona,” he says, punctuating his words with a thump on the table.
Grey eyes gaze up at him intently as Malfoy hooks his ankles behind Harry’s back and lets his hands fall to the bed. Malfoy nudges the pillow under his hips, and they gasp at the slight change in angle. Harry exhales, his arms trembling with excitement and the effort of holding himself up.
Yes, Harry thinks automatically but says the opposite thing, "No... I just came here to return the umbrella. Yeah, that's it," Harry adds as if he's trying to convince himself. "Well, I hope it tastes as good as it looks. See you around, Malfoy."
“You believe me, because you know he’s back. You know he’s back because your father was there in the graveyard. Your father watched and laughed as Voldemort tried to kill me, a sixteen-year-old boy! I almost died, Draco! Would you have even cared if I had
"You're... you're not? Then what's all this about then?" Harry asks, confused. It's only now that he realises he's barged in on a perfectly civil conversation between Malfoy and his officer — Malfoy's even got a sodding cup of tea in front of him.
—in Potter's handwriting stuck to the door. This special reminder was added because Draco once completely forgot that the clients on the other side of this door are Muggles.
“I’m Marjorie,” she says. Her strawberry blonde hair is tied into a neat bun, and her twinkling blue eyes, which remind him of Dumbledore, dart between Malfoy and him. There’s a small tattoo of two intertwined red roses on the inside of her wrist. She nods at his empty glass. “Can I get you another one?”
"It's a story about a girl who's looking for her family. I..." Marjorie frowns and stops walking. "You're my family, aren't you, Harry?" she asks in a soft voice that makes Harry's heart ache.
Draco catches himself and shakes his head. Oh, what is he going on about? He’s got Harry’s engagement ring for him right in the heart of his palm and here he is, quibbling about its style and setting. He nudges it towards his ring finger. It looks rather small, but Draco wonders if it’ll fit him perfectly, just like how Harry has fit so wonderfully in his life.
Harry's features slacken in pleasure as Malfoy continues to finger-fuck him, hitting all his sweet spots. Anticipation and desire, flitting like fireflies in his blood, now roar into crashing waves.
It's hardly the same as Draco's hands. Harry recalls Draco’s arms that taper into slim and elegant wrists, leading to nimble and capable fingers that excel at crafting potions, cutting ingredients or giving massages. Whenever Harry had collapsed, bone-tired, in bed, Draco would sigh in fond exasperation and pull off his glasses and shirt. He'd slick his hands up with oil and rub circles onto Harry's closed eyelids, his shoulders and back. Harry would be floating on a cloud of pleasure, as long as Draco's hands were on him.
The night breeze on his bare skin, the dappled moonlight sieving through the trees, the leaves crunching under his shoes, Draco's tightness around his cock and his stifled moans only made Harry all the more aware that he was having sex in public, and that was more than enough-
He’ll have plenty of chances to catch another game, but he doesn’t know when he’ll get to see Potter like this again.
Draco tenses, and Harry holds onto his hands, in case he tries to pull away. Instead, Draco releases a small and sad sigh, pulling Harry closer.
"Harry, please," Malfoy cries out urgently and then there's the sound of a zipper being undone, a rustle of clothes — "God,
That was a plea for validation, and Harry gave it to him. "I meant it, yeah, but not to the extent that you've done it," Harry says evenly, not stepping up to the fight. They’re no longer at Hogwarts, nor are they at odds. He recalls what his ex-therapist repeated dozens of times, and he says it now, choosing his words deliberately.
Miffed, Pork Chop holds her head high, slithers into the room and curls up in her basket, sulking. She narrows her eyes at Harry.
Harry gapes when the suits of armour judder to life, as if waking from a deep slumber. Some students let out impressed gasps, while a handful cry out in alarm, flinching away from the animated suits when they jump down from the plinths, their large and heavy shields raised. Malfoy scuttles behind the suits, seeking refuge as the enchanted soldiers march towards Harry.
He wasn’t supposed to feel jealous when he saw Potter dancing with Patil — well it was barely dancing and more of a sort of awkward
Harry toys with his damp coaster. He wants to talk to Malfoy, but he keeps thinking about Malfoy looking like a cornered Kneazle last night when he saw Harry again. He won’t learn anything new about Malfoy if he keeps avoiding Harry. Even though Harry has no idea what to say, it’s impossible for them to ignore each other — they’ve always been hyper-aware of the other’s presence. Finally, Malfoy drains his drink and heads towards him.
Harry’s mind helpfully supplies. Instead, he clears his throat and manages, “Stretching is important. Wouldn’t want anyone to get hurt.”
"It's about time, isn't it?" Zabini says, a smirk spreading slowly across his features. He folds his lanky body into the booth. Although Hermione's looking at the box while Parkinson opens it, she can feel Zabini's dark brown eyes fastened on her. She tucks a strand of wayward hair behind her ear and meets Zabini's gaze head-on.
Time passes in alternating bouts of silence and light-hearted conversation, only to be interrupted when pinpricks of rain ripple on the surface of the pond. When the rain gets heavier, the Muggles exclaim in French and start to leave, taking refuge in the neighbouring cafes.
Potter's eyes fly open, staring at Draco. His entire body tenses; the tendons on his neck standing out like cords, his hands trembling into fists, his stomach clenching, and then he's yelling Draco's name and coming, his huge cock pulsing powerfully as he spurts in Draco's hand, so much of it that come trickles between his knuckles, dripping to the floor.
"I do it only 'cos you like it," Draco flashes him a silky grin and trails his hands up and down, and then back up Potter's bare chest. Squeezes his shoulders, sucks on his neck and earlobe while his hips sway in full figure eights to the music. Draco moves to the front, smiles and regards Potter with half-lidded eyes.
He isn’t supposed to be here, at Ron and Hermione's place. On this fateful Sunday, he was supposed to be stuck somewhere far away in the marshes of Ireland. He purposely signed up for field work over the weekend to help Labelle train his students in Defence. Unfortunately, Labelle fell sick with food poisoning last night, and Harry cancelled the entire mission.
Harry nods amidst his confusion. Parkinson throws him a strange look as Neville leads her away. He watches as they hold each other and rock to a slow, romantic song. The other couples in their group are dancing too, lost in their own world of two.
George leans back on his chair, pleased. He raises his arms and splays his fingers out in the air in a dramatic gesture. "The day when Malfoy literally fell for Harry," he says in a theatrical tone, complete with a jubilant beam.
"Oh.” Malfoy turns the record over. "Your favourite song that I sing, eh?" he echoes, looking pleased. His gaze lifts to Harry’s jaw. "You've got some paint. Right... here," he says. His eyelashes flutter when he tries to wipe it off with a swipe of his thumb, but oil paints don't come off that easily.
With his face suddenly engulfed in a hot blush, Harry bows and practically runs off the stage back to the dressing-room, where he strips off the thong and pulls on proper clothes. His ears are still ringing from the music and excitement's still fizzing in his bloodstream as if someone's popped open a bottle of champagne in him.
"Can I... can I hold her?" Ron says, his voice wavering and his lips tightening in an effort to restrain his emotion.
Perhaps he could say yes but request for a long period of engagement before the wedding itself? A year, perhaps? He could use the time to wrap his head around it, they could sit down and have a proper chat about marriage, but hang on, don’t people usually do that before the proposal? Draco thinks, wrinkling his nose.
This is when it finally hits him, with an astonishing intensity and clarity that takes him by surprise, that he’s finally at the city that never sleeps, rich in both Muggle and wizarding history, where futures of people — be it actors, artists, singers, restauranteurs and everything else in between — are crafted, where people are reinvented and nothing stays the same.
Potter's eyes sparkle at the challenge. He leans forward, his forearms on the table and hands clasped. "Go for it, then."
That was probably why, coupled with lewd gestures and meaningful eyebrows towards Potter's uniform, Draco had mouthed
He wants to make it so good for Potter, so damn good that whenever Potter enters the canteen, he'll always be reminded of this night with Draco.
Harry nods back and buries his head into her neck. Her tears seep through his shirt, and he pats her hair, a shard of sadness cutting through him. "Hey, don't be silly. I'll write, yeah? You’ll come and visit me and I'll bring you around. We’ll go sight-seeing and eat at the best restaurants."
"Potter." Is it his imagination, or did Malfoy stand up straighter? A bright glint of interest enters grey eyes, and Malfoy lifts his chin up, leaning forward with his palms on the counter. Harry suddenly feels warm all over when the other man eyes him up lazily, taking in his white shirt and his dark-grey trousers — Harry had left his Auror robes in his office. Malfoy's lush lips curve up into the beginnings of an infuriating smirk.
for you, but this don't change anything, fuck no," Malfoy turns over and misses his pillow entirely — instead his body ends up sprawled diagonally across the bed, elbows balanced precariously on the edge of the bed and his head leaning over while he continues to wank, and Harry's eyes instantly latch onto Malfoy's bobbing arse that's so ready for
Over the next twenty minutes, two kind-hearted people with umbrellas offer to bring him to wherever he needs to go, but it's Harry's luck that he's not going anywhere.
Draco fiddles with his shoelaces while he mumbles. "The Leaving Ceremony has just ended. The next part of our lives is beginning. You're going to be an Auror, Weasley's going to be one too, and Granger's probably going to do something equally outstanding. You're going to meet new people that will be a much better fit for you than me. And I'm..." His heart sinks at the vista of opportunities awaiting the Trio, opportunities that he will not be granted. He's always wanted to work in Potions, but he can't think of any Potions shop which would take him as an apprentice. "I'll just be pulling you down when everyone knows you're going out with me. The media is going to tear you apart. The Ministry might make it hard for you to be promoted. I don't want to hold you back, nor cause you any trouble."
“Aw, we don’t wanna stop!” Jason yells. He kicks the ball up into the air, and Leo lunges forward to catch it. “Can we team up and score goals next time? I want Leo on my team.”
“My glasses aren’t for show, y’know,” Potter points out as he sits up, leaning on the leg of the nearest table and squints up at Draco.
When Potter first saw Draco on his laptop, he gave him an incredulous stare. Draco was too absorbed in his work to provide a proper response, so he simply shrugged in a matter-of-fact
Harry sips on his drink. He regards the vast, opulent ballroom decorated in shades of gold, silver and white. Glittering chandeliers hang from the high ceiling, throwing facets of light on the dozen or so twirling couples, mostly composed of Western European Ministry officials and their partners. A cool night breeze drifts into the room, and he absently runs a hand through the thick and luxurious curtains framing the open French windows. He wanders around the hall. The low hum of conversations in different languages and accents fills the air, and he smiles at a few familiar faces. He used to be uncomfortable rubbing shoulders at such formal settings, but he's fairly used to it now.
His open book beside him, Draco leans back on the trunk, folds his hands in his lap and closes his eyes, feeling entirely at peace with the world. He nudges away thoughts of mounting piles of scrolls waiting to be graded, lesson plans waiting to be implemented, along with his other staff duties. Honestly, if another third-year writes that vampires are found only in Transylvania, he will be
The halls are quiet — it's almost eleven pm, after curfew. Draco requests for an order of chips from the kitchens, and happily returns to his chambers, looking forward to settling down with his food, and perhaps a bracing cup of tea.
He's transported to the carefree, happy times when Father taught him flying in the vast meadows of the Manor, pride and joy shining in his eyes when Draco caught his first Snitch.
Draco waits for the honeymoon period to lose its lustre. A small voice of doom within him counts down to the day when Potter will tire of him. He’s very realistic about these things. He knows how it all begins; romances as sweet as chocolates and red roses, yet as lightweight and fleeting as a summer fling. Taking their clashing personalities into account, and the fact that they’re practically living in each other’s pockets, a part of him expects it won’t be long before their passion and lust is tempered by familiarity and routine.
Draco wiggles his toes and his fingers, flexes both arms, stretches his calves out and hauls himself up to a sitting position.
He sinks in especially deep and straightens up, bending Malfoy’s left leg over his own shoulder and resting his right leg on the bed. He continues to thrust, Malfoy’s face crumpling in bliss at the new position. "Harry, there, fuck," he gasps, his eyes rolling back into his head and his toes curling. "No, you missed it, ah, yes, there, right there—"
Sure, no magic was allowed — wands of prisoners were confiscated upon entry and returned after discharge — but Draco was too busy thanking his lucky stars that he was serving his sentence in a Dementor-free prison. It hadn't been a conscious choice to pick up baking while he was in there; he had accidentally stumbled upon a class that was making jammy dodgers. The scent of baking, and jammy dodgers in particular, had made Draco's heart cramp up with nostalgia and sorrow. As a child, he had spent days in the cavernous manor libraries, and the only way to tempt him out was for his mother to waft a plate of home-made jammy dodgers under his nose.
Harry wails and comes, his thundering orgasm taking him by surprise. The clenching of his arse drives Malfoy over the edge as well and he punches the headboard behind him, shouting as he comes in Harry.
The rest of lunch passes uneventfully, although when they exit the canteen, Harry risks a glimpse at the serving line, only to catch Malfoy looking at him. When their eyes meet, Malfoy hurriedly glances away, busying himself with the trays.
A visible shudder ripples through Malfoy, and he makes that familiar sound, a cross between a sigh and a sob, reminding Harry of how he moved on top of him. Before Harry can control himself, he pushes his hips forward, pressing their erections together.
Harry enters the bedroom, his hopeful grin fading when he sees an empty room. Shoulders slumping, he dumps his rucksack on the floor and trudges to his bed. Draco knows very well that he'll be home tonight, so why isn't he... Harry catches himself and shakes his head. Draco's been busy with work lately; how could he expect Draco to be sitting around waiting for him?
"Why did you do that?" Draco's vehemence takes Harry by surprise. "I will never make you choose between you and your career! Isn't it obvious, after all these years? You'll grow to resent me if I make you quit, and where will we be, then? If you wanted me to give up my potions research, I'd feel the same way too. I don't want you to lose something so important to you!" He declares, his cheeks flushed in agitation and his fists clenched.
"Well... yeah. I didn't know it was you at first, but Jason, the shopkeeper at Islington, told me I had a customer that would come in every Sunday and buy roughly three-quarters of my entire stock. I asked him about it, but Jason didn’t know you by name," Harry explains. He works while he talks, moving around the kitchen and pouring different treats into labelled bowls.
"You bastard! You utter, fucking prick!" Draco hollers, cradling his jaw in his palm. The metallic tang of blood in his mouth propels him to further heights of fury. He lunges towards Potter, and they're rolling around on the floor in a tangle of punching and kicking limbs.
Harry freezes in mid-kiss at the question. After a moment, he pulls back to regard Malfoy with eyes wide in disbelief.
"They were talking about the wedding, and..." Harry pauses, wondering if Malfoy would run off again if he said this. "They want you to be their best man, if only they knew about your whereabouts."
Draco thinks of the extent he’ll have to go to in order to hide Harry’s letters from his parents; the lies he’ll have to tell and the absolute mayhem that would unfold if his parents, especially his father, ever found out.
Harry is busy with an exhibition of his watercolours — a collaboration with two other schoolmates — over a weekend in early July. Even though he isn’t headlining the show, it’s special, because Draco is there, a proud smile on his face, standing together with Harry’s friends, and he’s so happy.
Potter turns his face towards Draco and presses his lips to the side of his neck, licking and sucking at Draco's pulse point. Potter's hand stumbles onto Draco's and he slides Draco's palm down his shirt, curling Draco's fingers around the hem.
Blushing, Draco had run and sought refuge in his kitchen, the good-natured laughter of his two friends ringing in his ears.
Voldemort had stood, triumphant and gleeful, in the centre of his circle of Death Eaters. When he’d yanked off Lucius Malfoy’s mask, Harry’s heart had seized up. He’d thought it was Draco-
Harry is speechless; he doesn’t know what to say to this poignant confession. So, he leads Draco to a supposedly empty patch of wall, and with a wave of his wand, he reveals the only sketch that not even his closest friends have seen.
"Brilliant," Harry says, pleased. He places one ticket in Draco's hand and grabs his other hand, lacing his fingers through his.
The four of them — a camouflaged Pork Chop is curled up beside Draco — are at their usual corner in the Three Broomsticks. Upon spotting Charlie today, he noticed the new dragon earring with a new name.
"No." Harry shakes his head. "Just wanted a change of position. Bed was pressing on my dick," he says rather sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. Draco's eyes track the movement of his hand, a frisson of thrill jetting through him when he sees the love bites
When Malfoy deepened the kiss, Harry finally responded, pumping adrenaline galvanising his own lips into action. Malfoy's lips were dry, but his mouth was so warm. Inexplicably, Harry was kissing back, his fists uncurling themselves and his palms pressed flat on Malfoy's back, his eyes fluttering closed as he lost himself in this new sensation.
Parvati, Kingsley and a few members of the Magical Creatures Department are currently hatching a plan to round up the other criminals, but Kingsley had taken one look at Harry and kicked him out of the office to get some rest.
"I wonder, Potter, are gays the only ones with functioning gaydars, or do bisexuals like you not come equipped with one?" Theo says, letting out a genuine laugh. His abrupt air has vanished, replaced by something softer and warmer.
When Draco's hands fall to either side of his head, eyes closed and chin tilted towards the ceiling, Harry interlaces the fingers of his left hand with Draco's. He drops a necklace of kisses on Draco's throat and collarbones — smiling against Draco's skin when Draco lets out a happy little sigh — and then moves back up to Draco's mouth, sliding his tongue in between his lips when he pushes another finger in Draco.
"I know you're perfectly capable of looking after yourself," Harry says, shifting his chair closer. "But… well… wouldn't it be nice if someone told you,
On the white space beneath the photograph, Draco has written a sentence that makes Harry's heart thud with longing.
and there had been a rocky period in their relationship because of Draco's reticence about his feelings. But that was before Harry had learnt that Draco regarded actions to be more important than words. Some nights when Harry returned home late from work, he would find Draco fast asleep in front of the Floo with an open book on top of his stomach. Harry had asked him, "Why don't you go to bed?"
"Are you staying at Rolanda Hooch's old quarters?" he asks. At Harry's nod, Malfoy leads him back the way he came. Harry follows him, passing through corridors and climbing a staircase. Malfoy sniffs the air, and then looks at Harry's bag. "You know the elves can make you something if you get hungry later at night."
One night, Draco had heard nothing but his name falling from Harry's lips as Harry wanked. Harry had moaned, cried out, gasped, growled, hissed, whined that one single word, and Draco lost it completely as he touched himself while Harry dripped sex all over his name. Coupled with the rest of the sounds the tape recorder had captured: the sound of Harry wanking, the rustle of clothes and bedsheets, the squeaking of Harry's bed — it drove Draco over the edge and he had come so hard.
He sighs. It's not like he was expecting anything else. Harry steps inside his flat and flops onto his sofa, gazing at their shared wall.
, on the right side of light brown, and Harry can imagine cutting a slice, slathering it in clotted cream…
" Jacob immediately falls silent when Malfoy raises his eyebrows at him meaningfully. "Oh yes. Long, rich tradition of asking good-looking new strippers to the pub. Club unity and all that," Jacob says and wipes the counter down, fighting to keep a cheeky grin off his face.
When there is no answer, Harry's brows crease in a frown, but he doesn’t lose his grin. He knocks again. “Draco, it’s Harry! I’m back.”
"Fuck yes," he hisses, guiding his cock into Harry's entrance, eliciting a cry from him. It's obvious that Malfoy wants nothing but to pound him into the bed, but he's starting slow, gentle, just like how Harry wanted.
Draco groans, so deep that it vibrates in his chest and throat, eclipsing Potter's encouraging cries, and fuck, he's gonna—
"Look, I just want my tart," he says, trying to keep his tone even; it's not a good idea to hex the bloody git.
"I returned to the office after you tried to break in, and sure enough, the security spells had been tampered with. That's how I knew that you had discovered the safe and needed the key-code."
"Brilliant. See you next week." Judging by the twinkle in Harry's eyes and the spark in his smile, it seems like he's thinking along the same lines too.
There is even a small play area set up especially for Rose in the corner of his shop for the rare instance when Hermione was at work and Molly was unable to babysit. One time, when Hermione popped by to collect Rose, Rose had been in the midst of waving bye to Draco before her face crumpled up and she burst into tears.
"No... hell no, I've never even thought of this before," Potter exclaims, arching his back and planting his palms between Draco's legs on the island.
Malfoy and he worked surprisingly well together — Malfoy was not afraid to argue with him for the good of the business if necessary, and he was much better at marketing and branding than George was. Although George was still the main inventor, Malfoy was able to contribute to his work, despite their different inventing styles. George liked to test spells out and go with the flow, depending on where the product and his experience led him. Malfoy was a lot more structured, preferring to read up on the theory before trying anything new.
“Want you. Need you now, so bad,” Potter mumbles, dropping his head to press a necklace of kisses around the base of Draco’s throat. “Not here. In bed, wanna take my time. It’s your birthday, I’ll do whatever you want…”
A peal of laughter rings out from the other side of the portrait hole. Malfoy's eyes fly open, and they freeze at the approaching footsteps and voices. Harry yanks Malfoy down on top of him. Even though it's late, it isn't uncommon for students to return from the library at this hour after studying for the upcoming N.E.W.T.s. Anyone could walk in on them, and this only makes things more exciting.
"Oh fuck," Draco sighs, pulling out. Harry licks his lips, but he's barely looking at Draco. With shaking treacle-stained hands, he unbuttons his jeans and yanks his pants down to his knees, revealing his erection, big and thick and hard-
It's the date of the Battle of Hogwarts. It is written in flowing cursive, and it leads to a trail of snow-white lilies that curve across his wrist and down the inside of his elbow, finally ending in these words—
Harry's heart is beating so fast that he's afraid it might leap right out of his ribcage. Malfoy looks so vulnerable, an uncertain half-smile on his lips and his cheeks stained with a tinge of rose.
They're dealing with a female dragon that is confused, angry and grieving. Simply stunning her will not be enough.
It's sunset when they reach their destination, and Draco sees at once why this is one of Harry's favourite spots along the Seine. They sit down on the concrete bank flanking the river.
George grins at Harry. "A happy working environment makes for a good profit, that's what I like to say! Harass away, Harry!"
"C'mon, c’mon..." Potter mutters, shifting closer to Draco. Draco's breathing hitches when Potter's thigh touches his; the heat of Potter's body radiating through his clothes. He doesn't know whether Potter's doing it on purpose, but he's definitely not complaining, as he basks in the warmth of this connection.
It's easy enough to invite Parkinson over for The Intervention, but now that that was accomplished, Hermione isn't sure how to broach the subject. She couldn't very well dive straight into it by saying
People call Times Square the pulsating heartbeat of the city, but Harry doesn’t like the place. The suffocating squeeze of people puts him on edge, and he’s frowning the entire time as they wade through the jostling crowds, passing by the bright lights of theatres, glossy fashion boutiques, upscale hotels, heaving eateries and gift shops selling naff tourist knick-knacks. The perpetual honks of yellow taxis, caught in the snarls of night-time traffic, isn’t helping things either. Malfoy wears a similar expression, which eases when they stop at an al fresco waffle shop for a breather.
Malfoy glances away, muttering, "Always saying what's on your mind." He looks down at his lap. "He's stable and resting at home. I wouldn't be here if his condition was critical. Mother cancelled our subscriptions to the papers, for the sake of Father's health."
"What the-" Harry yelps in astonishment at the sudden torrent of rain. Raindrops pound on the pavement, wetting his shoes and splattering on his jeans. He sighs and thumps his forehead against the door. A shiver wracks through him when cold rain trickles down between his shoulder blades. There are rain-repelling charms, of course — Harry sluggishly pulls his wand out from his pocket, but right now, he just wants a takeaway, a warm shower and a proper eight hours in bed. He can probably make a run for it — his favourite curry place isn't far from here.
"When you put it like that..." Potter murmurs, and gropes him again. He looks around at the utilitarian tables and chairs littering the area. "But we're not doing it here. We need a bed, somewhere comfortable. You need proper prep."
"Right. Goodnight," he says. He lets himself out, leaving Potter snoring with his pet snake curled protectively beside him.
His hands limp and his knees weak, Harry crumples to the ground, his eyes glazing over at the unfamiliar lock shared between Brittany and Adam that has replaced
would be the one getting me naked tonight," In a flash, Malfoy pushes Harry down on the sofa until he's on top of him, their bodies pressed flush against each other and Harry can feel Malfoy's hard prick through his jeans.
“Alright?” he says, supporting himself by resting his palms on either side of Malfoy’s head and steadying his knees on the bed. He shifts Malfoy’s legs until the backs of his knees rest on Harry’s shoulders. His prick slips out slightly as he makes Malfoy comfortable, and he quickly eases in, desperate for every inch to be engulfed in Malfoy’s intoxicating heat.
Malfoy rears back like a startled pony. Alarmed grey eyes flicker up to Harry before dropping down to their entwined hands.
"And the sky is blue. Get to the point, Potter," he replies crisply, binning the wrapper. Although he pulls the book closer, he keeps it closed, which tells Harry volumes about his interest in the conversation.
Malfoy lays on the bed, making himself comfortable on Harry’s pillows. His thighs fall apart in invitation. “Slow,” he says, and Harry nods weakly as he coats his fingers. He lies down on his side beside Malfoy, his left hand cupping the back of Malfoy’s head while his other hand slides between his legs, his fingers circling his rim. Malfoy kisses him tenderly, a thumb grazing Harry’s stubble. He moans, the sound resonating between their mouths, when Harry pushes a finger in.
There's sudden movement in Sin, and Harry's eyes swivel towards the bakery. A figure — Zabini — moves towards the entrance, flipping the sign on the door and turning his head back. A white-blond head emerges from the back of the shop. Harry watches through the windows as Malfoy throws his head back and laughs, his face looking wonderfully open. It's obvious that Malfoy, Zabini and Parkinson are unwinding after a hard day's work, like what Harry, Ron and Hermione are doing now.
Still, to soothe Potter's internal protests, Draco slides a hand on his knee, giving him a quick squeeze. He slants a coy glance towards Potter, and winks.
"Come in me. Please, Harry, please, I'll take every drop, just like how I swallowed you all up. I'll take everything because I'm your Slytherin slut-"
They exchange goodnights, and Harry returns to gazing longingly at Malfoy's dot as he moves about in his room, Pork Chop's words of support replaying in his head.
Harry raises his eyebrows. He didn't know that these were potential Auror candidates — this explains why their spells are a lot more polished than he expected.
He blinks his bleary eyes open and lifts his head from his arm. A blanket slides off his shoulders. He stares at it, confused. He's not at home, nor is he in the office. It takes a while for his brain to register that it's Harry's blanket taken from his reading corner. A gust of wind ruffles the parchment caught under his hands. The lights of the rooftop illuminate the blotches of ink on his fingertips.
"Always so desperate for it." Malfoy smiles, teeth glinting in the moonlight as he prowls up Harry's body until he's straddling him, his knees on either side of Harry's hips. He's saying something, but Harry's brain is short-circuiting at this new position. If he shifts just a little bit lower and raises his hips just like this—
“It’s just sitting there, Ron. All alone.” Harry points at the tart, sighing wistfully. “I didn’t know we had treacle tart on the menu. I didn’t even see any at the serving line just now.”
“Oh,” Harry says, feigning surprise, as he isn’t supposed to know about this, if not for Marjorie’s slip of tongue. “D’you write your own music?”
"Thank you for this year. It's been delightful. I understand if you don't want to continue this anymore," Draco says and looks away. He's practised this many times in front of the mirror. His words were supposed to have emerged sleek and rehearsed, but instead, they felt chunky and stilted.
Draco hasn't even seen the man himself in seven years, yet he has sat through three separate conversations about him; two from Robards and Charlie, and one from Minerva. The Headmistress sought him out soon after he returned, breaking the news that Harry Potter is replacing Madam Hooch as Flying Instructor, although he requested for the name of his classes to be changed to "Quidditch and Muggle Games" to "better reflect the scope" of his lessons.
, even better than Draco's dozens of fantasies 'cos this is real and he can feel the heat radiating off Potter's body and Potter sounds… he sounds amazing, all soft breathy moans and gasps-
There's a stunned silence. Uneasiness starts to gather in Harry, but not for long, because the crowd explodes into a firework of cheers. Harry laughs loudly as his shirt slowly slides off Malfoy's face, which is a picture of utter disbelief. Beside him, Matt hides a guffaw behind his cocktail.
It doesn't escape Draco's notice that Theo has ignored his question. Nevertheless, he sticks to his original train of thought, because Theo has to know something, being Potter's Auror partner and in his company eight hours a day, while Draco only catches glimpses of him during lunch...
Malfoy frowns in indignation. "Think it's funny, do you?" He points at the other cupboard. "I wonder what's in yours. Bet it's even kinkier, full of whips and chains and… and sexy costumes, I reckon!"
Draco is dressed in black, his face so expressionless and his body so still that the photograph of him doesn't move. Harry’s voice is shaky as he whispers.
"Yeah, I understand," Harry says, eager to change the subject. "We've never had a conversation like this without fighting or snogging, so I get what you mean."
It’s early June, exam period, and although Draco is especially busy with monitoring exams, marking and writing notes for Robards about the candidates for the Auror partnership, he still can’t wait to be with Potter, to see him, to touch and kiss him. Salazar, he has sex on the brain, like a seventeen-year-old, and it doesn’t help when Potter adjusts the blindfold on Draco’s eyes and leans in close to whisper, his husky and playful voice sending thrills down Draco’s spine. “Wanna know what I got for your birthday?” He places his palms on Draco’s shoulders, propelling him onwards.
“Yeah, that’s how it’s like when he performs.” Harry indicates a dark, hooded figure at the corner of the bar, a sketchbook on his lap. “That’s me.”
Draco gets up too, nodding. At pub night tomorrow, they'd be Malfoy and Granger to each other, their acquaintances unaware of their surprising friendship. He watches as Hermione opens the door, a frosty roar of wind blasting into the restaurant. She winds her scarf tighter around her neck and hurries off towards Charing Cross Road.
"Please," Potter says around a sigh, scooting forward on the table. His calves are dangling from the edge of the table, his toes curling. His cock bobs in the air, and Draco swallows thickly. Fuck, he's not sure he can fit such a big cock into his mouth fully on the first try, but he sure as hell is gonna try. It's so tempting to release his own prick from his jeans and wank while he sucks Potter, but it's not about his pleasure tonight.
Potter's words play in a loop in Draco's mind, gradually eroding whatever shred of uncertainty that still remains.
Draco casts a lingering gaze at him before getting up and heading to the small pantry to prepare two mugs of Earl Grey—Pansy's favourite. He leaves the pantry and walks to the other half of the shop. He stands in front of a heavy mahogany door with the words—
Malfoy's eyes sharpen at his words, as if looking out for some hidden meaning or jibe, but he relaxes when it’s clear Harry meant nothing of that sort. Harry finishes his slice and wipes his fingers on a napkin. “You don’t mind, d’you?”
"That's what we always say, but something new always crops up just when we least expect it. So I've blocked off a week in my schedule and I've taken the liberty of" — damn, Harry loves it whenever Draco uses those formal phrases, and along with that cut-glass posh accent of his, it's downright sexy — "booking us two" — Draco gulps — "aeroplane tickets, first class of course, to Mauritius at the end of the month."
jumper is still draped on the back of his chair. His coffee-stained Gryffindor mug sits near the sink, and a box of his treacle tart is still in the fridge. Out in the hall, there are letters addressed to Harry that Draco can't bear to look at.
They will recite their vows, slip rings on each other’s fingers, promise the rest of their lives to each other—
"So we're really doing this," Parkinson says faintly. She straightens up, her gaze travelling from Ron to Hermione and back to Ron. "Well, I'll need my second then. Be right back." She gets up and flounces off towards Sin, returning shortly with Zabini and a royal-green box. Zabini pauses when he sees Ron and Hermione.
"I thought it was because of the Triwizard Tournament the year before, I didn't..." Harry casts his mind back. Come to think of it, Hermione had hinted something to that effect, but Harry hadn't paid much attention to it...
Harry flops back on the grass, splaying his limbs out like a happy starfish. He closes his eyes, releasing a content sigh at the warm rays of sunlight dancing on his skin. “Play something for me,” he demands. An image enters his mind — Malfoy, all charm and magnetism, looking deep into his eyes as he sings for him.
"When I saw the ring, of course some part of me was thrilled, but I was panicky and anxious about it. We haven't even had a proper talk about our expectations of marriage and here I am, holding a ring that I thought signified your proposal."
Malfoy smiles with affection at Leo. Harry suspects Malfoy has a soft spot for Leo, and his suspicion proves correct when Malfoy places his scrolls on a table. “Since you’re vouching for Mr Potter’s classes…” He looks down at his attire — formal robes and dress shoes. “I’m hardly dressed for this, though.”
"You've been smiling all night," Potter remarks, lifting his leg and resting his right ankle on his left knee. "Guess you really like me too, huh?"
“I’m keeping Times Square, and the one of him performing in Mona’s,” Harry says at once. “And Empire State Building.”
“Just curious,” Potter says, quirking an eyebrow playfully. “Who knows what you Slytherins get up in your dungeons. There’s lots of stories going about, you know.”
He tilts his head in curiosity when he comes across one that he has never seen: of Harry sleeping on a backdrop of rumpled pillows and sheets with a small smile on his face.
the whisper of silk leaving skin. There's something in the way the other man coordinates every part of his slim body with the sultry music as he slinks with the hypnotising grace of the well-practised — all slicked-back and layered blond hair; sharp collarbones and jutting hips; shoulders thrown back; acres and
Draco listens as Charlie launches into the explanation that he’s already heard. Everest was indeed Norberta’s mate. Distraught and heartbroken over his death, and infused with hormones and spells that amplified her motherly nesting instinct as part of the Ridgeback captive breeding programme, Norberta broke free from the sanctuary in the middle of the night and started her non-stop, arduous journey to return to her birthplace.
"I'm gonna-" Draco can barely finish his sentence when Harry grabs his hips even closer and swallows him down completely. Draco cries out at the force of his orgasm and spills himself down Harry's gulping throat.
"I've discussed this at length with your team, your superiors and the Unspeakables, and this is the only way." Kingsley's eyes sharpen, and his words have an edge to it. "This is not an option. This is your job, and you are duty-bound to perform it to the best of your ability. Do I have your word, Aurors Potter and Weasley? You will not entertain communication of any sorts with your loved ones, and you will not do anything to jeopardise the case. You will be free to leave at once when the case is fully closed."
"Bullshit. You moaned my name too easily for that to be the first time. You wanna know something, Malfoy? I was touching myself too while I watched you. I came outside your bedroom, on your floor, right
Disgrace and guilt, magnified at the knowledge of Potter seeing him at his lowest and most despicable, storms through Draco. Driven by rage and self-disgust, he shoves Potter away and descends the stairs, ignoring his plaintive cry. Draco hurries out of the Tower, schooling his expression when he runs into students. He walks, fast and edgy, towards the dungeons, breathing heavily and biting hard on his lower lip to control his emotions.
He has a choice right now. It’d be so easy to leave the compartment and never look back, knowing that by doing that, he will be permanently ending everything between them. With the advent of the new school year, they’ll be back at each other’s throats, the events of this year left as mere memories of heartbreak that will tug sadly at the trapdoor of their minds forever more.
When there’s no reply, Harry looks up from his painting. Draco repeats his name, a strangely determined expression hardening his features, as if the word gives him strength. Harry puts down his palette and brush, and goes to his side. Solemn and silent, Draco leads him to the nearest mirror, mounted on the wall along a corridor in Grimmauld. Between them and the mirror is an antique chest of drawers — Draco presses his hips against the top of the drawer, and squares his shoulders. Harry stands behind him, his confusion morphing into apprehension when Draco points his wand at the top of his own head. Draco takes a deep, pained breath, closes his eyes, and then shakily whispers a spell.
you, I've got better things to do with my time," Bacon sniffs. "It's not my fault that you sound like a wounded Hippogriff when you're touching yourself!"
"What in Salazar’s name are you doing, Potter? I certainly don’t recall sending you an invitation," he snaps through clenched teeth. He sends a vicious glare towards Harry, shaking a trembling fist at him. “How dare you—”
He cranes his neck, hoping to see if Draco is still wearing his promise ring, but Harry can't get a good view as he's looking at Draco from the opposite side. He wants to be beside Draco, unravelling his scarf around Draco's neck and kissing him all over. He'd engulf him in an overdue hug, and they'll drink Harry's homemade hot chocolate and cuddle on the bench until it's time to leave for the Burrow for Christmas dinner.
Malfoy huffs and throws his arms up in exasperation. "I knew I wasn't going to get any sympathy from you, Weasley. Of course, it'll be up to me to fix things that need not have happened if people learnt how to follow instructions! Who knows, I might just leave it there," he grumbles, skewering Harry with a glare. He hurries towards his bookshelves, pulls out a folder with colour-coded parchment and flips through it, mumbling darkly to himself all the while.
“No, don’t get a refund. I… I really want to go away with you. Mauritius sounds lovely. It’s just that this month isn’t good for me. The shop’s expanding, and the school term is starting, so…” Draco untangles himself from Harry’s arms. “I’ll go and unpack.”
"Luna's owl. She's away in Southeast Asia looking for creatures. Bambi likes to visit when she's not around," Harry explains. Draco’s close to making some remark about Luna's choice of owl names, but he's interrupted by a crash when a fluffy great grey owl careens into a large empty pot. Pig rears up, startled by the loud sound.
“Mmm, I did promise you dessert after dinner,” Draco says, his grin widening when Potter toys with the zipper of his jeans. “But I meant that in a more literal sense.” He leans in close, his lips hovering near Potter’s earlobe and his breath grazing his cheek. “It’s treacle tart day tomorrow, that’s why we’re here on a Sunday. How’d you like an advance tasting?”
"Seeker for Ravenclaw, although I made the team only in my final year," Harry says, his mind flicking back to Dan's cover story.
Harry looks up from the pork chops, his gaze drawn towards Malfoy's arse when Malfoy, with his back turned to him, leans against the doorjamb to holler something to the kitchens.
They pull away, their lips making a soft sound when they part, identical foolish grins on their faces.
Draco wants to say that Potter is the most gorgeous bloke he’s ever been with, but his words are swallowed by a moan when Potter presses on his prostate again, sending tremors of pleasure up his spine and prick. He is consumed with an overwhelming urge to hold Potter, to tell him that he isn’t running away anymore—
“Right,” Harry says eventually, wiping his palms on the thighs of his jeans. There’s really no subtle way to go about this. “I’d like to… er… pursue Malfoy.”
After that, he pads to the kitchen, his heart flipping like a pancake at the sight of Malfoy at the stove, cooking breakfast in a baggy T-shirt and joggers. Harry scratches his neck and leans against the doorjamb, soaking in the domesticity of the scene. He's never seen Malfoy like this before. Malfoy's making him breakfast after a night together, and he's wearing Malfoy’s shirt.
The chime of the oven jolts Draco from his memories and he peers inside the oven, pleased when he sees Harry's treacle tart coming along nicely. In a while more, the tart will be finished and he'll have a reason to pop over to Sugarcoated. Draco looks at his counter — the neglected chocolate in the bowl and the disarray of half-finished fairy cakes and tarts.
Draco looks up from his discussion about constellations with Aurora when a tawny owl swoops in the Great Hall during breakfast. There is usually more post during the first week of school, but even with the higher volume, this particular owl grabs everyone's attention because of the staggeringly large bouquet the poor bird is carrying — the flowers are two to three times its body size. A hush descends on the Hall as the owl soars towards the faculty table. Draco blinks when it deposits the flowers in front of him — he barely has time to shove his plate and goblet away, lest the owl careen into his food. It heaves a sound of relief before it ruffles its feathers and flies away.
He scrubs paint off his skin and from under his fingernails, and gets ready for bed. He wraps himself snugly in his duvet, grabs his phone and opens his messages, scrolling past other names before spotting Draco's. He pauses before selecting Draco's name — he has to stop this habit, nothing will come out of this... stalking. They haven't spoken since Harry left, so why should things change now?
"Because you'll always be an Auror, I'll always be in Potions, and because we have to be together," Draco says, a small smile on his face.
Pansy remarked in a matter-of-fact tone, while Mother merely patted Draco’s hand and gave him a gentle, encouraging smile.
The longing in Harry's heart aches more than the throbbing wounds on his flesh. He angles his head towards the wall adjacent to his bed. Pasted on this wall are roughly a dozen photographs of Draco, provided mysteriously by Kingsley and taken during Harry and Ron's exile. There are photos of Draco locking up his shop, eating dinner with his friends, walking along the streets...
He closes his eyes and imagines a future with Harry — that aquamarine ring glittering on his finger, exchanging vows with him and staying with him in this very house until they’re old. Harry has his annoying little habits: not capping the toothpaste properly after he’s finished with it, hogging all the covers at night and subscribing to way too many Quidditch magazines. They have fights too; horrible, fiery fights that end in furious words and the harsh sounds of slammed doors echoing off the walls.
," Malfoy moans and attempts to hump Harry, but ends up thrusting his hips into thin air. Nevertheless, with the promising mention of
Harry still has his wanderlust from time to time, especially when his colleagues return from new and exciting places. He'll think back to the times when he drifted from country to country, living out of his suitcase and exploring places that he never would've dreamed of going.
Draco tilts his head and pulls on a silky smile. He unfolds his lanky frame, standing to step out from behind the table. A thrill sparks in him when Potter's eyes drop down the length of his body for a split second before snapping back to Draco's face.
Draco picks one ring from the air, leaving the other floating. He rests it on his palm. The rings are customisable, in both band design, gem type, and width. He's crafted a suitable pattern for Harry: a simple sterling silver ring studded with the gems lying next to each other.
"I told Kingsley I'm moving back to London until further notice. I'll be based here now," Harry says, eyes fastened on the skin just beneath Malfoy's collarbone. He remembers how flushed that particular spot can get when Malfoy is on the verge of orgasm.
This time round, he doesn't bother with warming charms, hoping that the blizzard would be cold enough to numb his aching heart.
Potter merely shrugs, his eyes sparkling with mischief. “Sixth sense.” He tightens the straps on his glove. “Up for a game? It’s been a long time since I’ve played, what with the Tournament and all.”
“That sounds absolutely brilliant,” Potter declares after a moment. “I think you’ll be great at it.”
Potter's close; Draco knows by the clenching of his arse and shuddering of his body. Draco nibbles on Potter's earlobe and pounds into him even deeper—
Harry drops the umbrella when there's a lull in the song. Malfoy's eyes snap open and he zeroes in on Harry.
Bacon, curled up in his big cushioned basket in the living room, raises his head when Harry stomps towards the kitchen.
Harry knocks on Draco's door for the third time, calling his name for good measure. After a moment, he steps back, frowning. This is unusual; Draco is always on time. He presses his lips together in worry, and decides to Apparate to Draco's balcony.
“Yes, that’s what I fucking want,” Draco whispers, and releases a sound in between a sob and a moan. One more stroke, a loud huff of breath, his left palm braced against the tree trunk, and he’s coming, coming so hard and shooting his load at the base of the tree, gasping at the force of his orgasm. Spunk leaks between his knuckles, dripping down on the grass. Panting, he takes a moment to recover, and then looks up.
But it's too late, Draco knows the telltale signs of Harry's temper flaring: that spark of fire in his eyes, the grim seal of his lips, the furrowing of his brows and his clenched jaw. His face crumples into anger.
They've been walking on eggshells about this, but Harry needs to wrest it out into the open, to voice out his worries and concern, because if he doesn't, then who would?
"And I can't believe you have no appreciation for the fine art of seduction and subtlety," Draco says, huffing. "Just setting the mood."
Harry laughs. "Yeah, I'd like that very much." He suddenly frowns when he thinks of something he's been wondering about. "But why d'you like me that much?"
There's a dull thud as Potter winds his arms around the barricade, his biceps flexing 'cause he's clenching his fists on the metal. His head is thrown over the railing, throat exposed and gulping, and the sounds he's making... fuck, that's
"Tell Hermione, McGonagall and your mum that I'll be alright. I'll write when I reach wherever the Ministry sends me to." Harry pulls away. "Tell Hermione not to worry."
"I know." Even though Harry knew that Malfoy was lying from the start, something hard and bitter untangles within him, easing at those words.
"Wait," Draco stutters when Harry begins to kiss his way down his throat, his hands undoing the buttons on Draco's shirt one by one and his mouth following suit, dropping a hot trail of kisses down Draco's chest. "We have guests downstairs, we can't... oh
“Why, why, Potter. Your sweet-talking is improving, although I don’t really care for the half-hidden insults.”
about Oliver and Harry. "He's always bloody grumpy whenever the media announces updates about your love life."
“These different alternatives sound intriguing.” Potter’s enthusiasm is infectious, and Draco finds himself nodding along with him.
After the dreariness of a winter bristling with grief and loss, lies a long and winding path of new beginnings and fresh starts; a chapter full of promise and hope. Draco's heart lifts like a summer cloud at the thought.
Every fibre of Draco’s being wants to let Potter have his way with him, let him work him hard and good and
"Besides, what would you like me to write? 'I'm sorry for kissing you when you didn't want me to? But don't worry, I'll still buy your treats,'" he says. "That won't come out right at all.”
"Give him some time, Harry," Hermione says. She places a mug of hot chocolate in front of him. Harry smiles gratefully. He wraps his palms around the mug and stares disconsolately at the beverage, his shoulders hunched.
Draco’s filthy mind fills in the blanks — of him fucking Potter from the back, his hands digging into the other man’s hips while he pounds hard and fast into him. Draco bites a knuckle to keep himself from crying out at that delectable image, which morphs into one of him riding Potter when Potter switches position.
"No, he's not. He's just being his usual annoying self," Potter replies wearily. He snarls something to the snake and beckons it off Draco's lap. It follows, pulls itself up to its full height, tosses its triangular head in the air and hisses loudly.
"No, not particularly. It's adorable! I think I'll name him Blueberry," Potter says with glee, his arms still wrapped around the demon in a cuddle.
His love is steady; of a quiet, fierce devotion that will never waver or fade. It's a lifetime of putting Harry in front of his own needs, and Draco never thought he had it in himself to love like that. He was never the sort of person to put others before himself, but he would, for Harry, only for Harry.
Harry trembles under Malfoy's questing tongue, his toes curling and back arching with pleasure. No one's touched him like this before, with so much patience and skill, turning Harry's entire body into one helpless erogenous zone-
Rain streaks across his glasses, and he looks at the sky, squinting at the heavier drizzle. He pulls up the hood of his sweatshirt, discreetly refreshes his Warming Charm and resumes walking, narrowly avoiding a puddle of rain. He passes Dotonbori Canal, the bright lights of the signs reflected in the water. He rounds a corner, turning into Hozenji Yokocho, a small and old-fashioned alleyway tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Dotonburi. He releases a breath, glad to escape the crowds. He stands outside what appears to be an abandoned sushi shop, peers around, and waves his wand at the dark storefront.
“No, it’s alright,” Draco croaks, closing his legs under the bubbles; his body doesn’t need any more encouragement, he’s already hard. When Potter closes his eyes and tips his head back, fully enjoying the bath, Draco discreetly makes the water a bit colder.
It's Draco's first Christmas without Harry. No matter how busy either of them were, they made sure to spend Christmas together. Well, there was that one year when Harry had been posted to Birmingham during the Christmas week. Draco had all but given up hope of him coming home on time, but Harry had tumbled from the Floo at eleven o'clock on Christmas night with a lopsided grin, bloodied robes and a rather crumpled present under his arm.
The bakery was called Sin, with the S styled like the S in Slytherin and the colour of the name identical to the royal green of Slytherin House. Perhaps that was why Harry wasn't entirely shell-shocked to see Blaise Zabini emerge from the entrance, an unlit cigarette dangling from his fingers and a wry smirk on his lips.
He lies down beside Draco, wondering about his change in behaviour. When Draco reaches over and laces his fingers with Harry's, Harry tightens his grip on Draco at once, his heart leaping.
Harry ducks his head in embarrassment — he doesn’t fancy using his name for anything, not even for art school or his exhibitions, but he’s willing to make an exception for this.
“They’ve never served treacle tart before, and it wasn’t there while we were queueing—“ Harry stops short as understanding dawns on him.
Harry’s job has caused him to miss birthdays, weddings, pub nights, celebrations and Christmases. Still, he wouldn’t have any other career, which has whisked him away to amazing places with different cultures, food, scenery, people, and ways of thinking.
"This is what it's been like the past seven nights. Think it's fun, d'you, this teasing? Well, two can play at this game. Enjoy your orgasm,
They could have had everything, but instead, Draco is all alone in a reality that cuts like the glass shards of broken-down dreams; stranded in a place where love has lost its lustrous sheen.
When Potter got too close, pressing his front to Draco’s back lightly to correct his posture, Draco fought to steady the rapid thudding of his heart. He expected Potter to flash him a cheeky smile and inch nearer, but instead, he muttered an apology and moved away. Potter stopped visiting the war memorial, too.
Malfoy moves to the back of the class, looks at them, and then mimics their position. He bends forward at the hips and lowers his upper body, hands gripping his right shin.
When Malfoy is too stunned to move, Harry shoves the door open and steps over the threshold. He scans the surroundings—it’s clear it’s a flat Malfoy shares with Greengrass, perhaps for an occasional getaway. He glances at Greengrass’ shoes on the rack, the copies of
— flushed cheeks and shining eyes — after his shouting matches with Malfoy across the street and after late nights spent experimenting with chocolate. Not a day passes without Harry making some snide comment about Malfoy or glancing at Sin.
After a bout of thrusting, Draco pulls out and smacks his cock lightly on Harry's balls and is rewarded with a loud cry. Grinning wickedly, Draco begins to thrust between Harry's thighs, rubbing his entire length along his balls and perineum.
Malfoy looks pleased. "Dance with me then, won't you, Dan?" Malfoy purrs, a note of longing tugging on Dan's name. Hearing Malfoy use his fake name makes Harry even bolder.
It might not even be him in the first place, Harry rationalises, laughing weakly. Someone from Hogwarts with black and messy hair called Harry isn't much to go on, is it? Malfoy's met plenty of men, surely that description couldn't mean him,
Malfoy rushes towards him, and even though Harry holds his ground, his opponent is on an all-out offensive. They trade a barrage of curses, and Harry is backing away to the middle of the courtyard, his wand whipping in the air with defensive charms, which is honestly not his forte. He ducks an
Potter's lips are chapped from the wind, but Draco doesn't care, can't care at all because it's Potter that he's kissing. He's thought about this so many times, and it feels so surreal that it's happening.
Eventually, he gets out of bed, goes to a drawer and retrieves a simple wooden box. He returns to bed, opens the box and lays out a peculiar assortment of items.
It was nightfall at the drawing room of the Manor, the curtains rustling in the breeze and pale moonlight spilling across the floor. Draco was kneeling in front of the Dark Lord, who was twirling his wand and eyeing him with undisguised glee. In the audience were his parents, along with a few Death Eaters. Panic, fear and doubt raged in his bloodstream like an inferno—not because he was afraid of the Marking process, but with this Mark burned on him, it was irrefutable proof that he served the Dark Lord. Should Potter emerge victorious, Draco would have to face the consequences of his actions—Azkaban.
"No!" Ron roars, shaking Harry as if he could shake some sense into him. "Everything we've done will go to complete shit when word gets out we're alive. I'm not gonna let that happen! Kingsley—"
Even though Christmas and New Year has come and gone, even though the rawness of his longing and sadness has faded in intensity, Harry still thinks of Draco every day, holding tight onto Draco’s smile to tell him that it wasn’t just a dream.
Draco's heart bounces disconcertingly at the concern in his voice. He turns over to face the other man.
The wooden box is still tucked away in the last drawer, but there's two new additions in the box: the photo album that Hagrid had given to Harry in his first year of Hogwarts, and a white envelope stamped with a special golden Ministry seal.
The needle on Harry's speed meter tattoo indicates a higher speed than Draco's, which is rather fitting based on their personalities and attitudes towards relationships (Harry was the one who said "I love you" first).
"No," Harry murmurs, willing his heartbeat to slow down as he places his fingers on the other man's jaw, forcing Malfoy to meet his gaze. "I'm fucking mad for it now."
"I'll be back soon, just gonna go downstairs, yeah?" Harry murmurs in a soothing tone. A series of sounds ensue: the thump of footsteps, a hissed snarl of pain — Draco assumes that Harry bumped his toe again into the cupboard that Draco's always warned him about, the intermittent rumble of nearby traffic, the squeaking sound of Harry settling down on the couch, and finally, Harry's voice, gone deep and smoky with lust.
"Look at you, my God," Potter whispers with a note of reverence as he stares with wide eyes at Draco's erection. Draco's face grows warm. Cock stiffening even more, he straightens up and covers Potter's body with his own, kissing him so passionately and desperately that Potter's chest rumbles with every deep moan.
Harry doesn't need to look to know that Malfoy's cock is absolutely gorgeous—long and so responsive, just like Malfoy himself. The sounds he makes when Harry sucks him off…
“Is there anywhere you’d fancy?” Malfoy asks. Harry shakes his head, his interest piqued about where Malfoy would take him. “I’m hungry, so how does pizza sound? I know a place.”
“Yes, perhaps. I could have charmed the knife to cut the salmon and the salt to sprinkle itself, but I’ve learnt that relying too much on magic would affect the taste of the dish, so I limit myself to summoning, cleaning and warming charms. You must be close to your food to cook well, and I find the monotony of chopping, slicing and frying to be… calming,” Draco says. “Do you cook?”
What they did... it's just a way to let off steam, what with the anger, loneliness and sadness that Harry feels about his fraying friendship with Ron and Hermione, the stress and anxiety about the Tournament and the deluge of schoolwork.
Potter's response arrives in seconds. Draco dims the lights, plumps up his pillow and pulls the duvet up to his chest. His cheek sinks into the soft pillow as they exchange rapid-fire texts.
“I won’t. I’ll never forget that,” Draco promises. He pulls Potter into another breath-taking kiss, trying to pour all of his emotions — something that he is still unable to put into words — into it. They break apart reluctantly, and the sadness in Potter's eyes melts into something so loving and tender when he looks at Draco.
"Guess you haven't," Draco mutters under his breath. Resisting the urge to roll his eyes, he follows Potter, who seems intent on exploring the suite.
Harry sucks in a breath and goes very still, his body tensing. Malfoy trails off, his fingers faltering on his guitar. His eyes are round with shock, his smile dimming. They stare at each other, and Harry cringes when people turn back to glance at him. Malfoy shakes himself out of his stupor, and with his gaze still locked on Harry, he continues singing without his guitar, his whisper trembling.
Draco's sly smirk, brimming with sexual promise, is all Harry needs for him to know that Mauritius is going to be a brilliant, brilliant vacation.
"Norberta!" Charlie hollers, jumping and raising his arms. He adjusts his fireproof balaclava and shouts again, catching the dragon's attention. It staggers towards Charlie, who backs away into a grove of trees. Magical ropes snap around the dragon's ankles; Filius and Minerva quickly conjure new restraints. The dragon’s formidable spiny wings attempt to beat, but it can't — someone must've grounded it.
That tempting image of Malfoy in the tub lingers — the dark blond of his wet hair, pale and soapy shoulders, the delicate hollows of his collarbone, and that pink flush blooming across his cheeks. What if the door remained locked, would they have recreated that wonderful kiss from seven years ago, only naked...
In a quick, fluid motion, Harry suddenly spins Malfoy around, drops to his knees at once and tears off Malfoy's leather pants.
"Draco," Harry whispers, and presses himself closer to the tree. His breaths are shallow. He is completely still, because this might be another dream again, and if he moves, he'll wake up back in Underground. It's as if the rest of the world has melted away, leaving only Draco shining in the spotlight.
At the pride on McGonagall's face when she looked at them, Harry had to swallow his tears. This accomplishment of his didn't involve prophecies, murder and Dark Lords. For the past few weeks, he was just a boy indulging in his childish desire to paint, armed not with curses and strategies to kill, but simply a paintbrush and a palette.
When Malfoy turns the corner, Harry closes the door. With his back pressed against the door, he slides down to the floor, a long and dreamy sigh accompanying his descent.
Draco lets his gaze drift around the shop, wanting to keep the reveal for later when the tattoo is finished. There’s the floating tray, spinning around when Potter asks for a different colour, and some scattered knick-knacks that remind Potter and Pansy about their friends—a string of radish-shaped fairy lights wound around the counter, threading through a photograph of Luna Lovegood and the Gryffindors at the Fountain of Fair Fortune, a nearby wizarding pub. Hanging on a wall is a map of Europe with golden stars tacked on the countries that Pansy has visited—it’s hand-drawn by Millicent Bulstrode, who creates beautiful maps for a living.
Harry recalls the cobblestones and crooked buildings of Diagon Alley, along with its hodgepodge of magical, one-of-a-kind shops. It’s so different from Times Square, with its huge screens, and tall, sleek and rectangular buildings with perfect right angles.
"Even saying your name... it's enough t' make me come. I love your name. You want me to come, don't you?"
"That was a low blow. I shouldn't have said that." Potter backpedals, putting his palms up. "I'm keeping you from your class. Go. Just go before we do something that we’ll regret." He tugs on his hair in frustration and takes a step back.
Some days Harry is on the optimistic side: they're allowed to leave Underground as long as they're disguised, either with Polyjuice or a strong Glamour. Everyone gets along relatively well, well enough for a pint and a spot of fresh air in the nearby town after hours.
Draco leaps into action, pulling on his robes, and then rushing to the dungeons to execute Minerva's orders. On his way out, he runs into Horace, panting like a train and leading a huddle of pale-faced Gryffindors, who appear to be unharmed. Along with Aurora and Pomona, who are covering the other wings of Hogwarts, the older man’s instructions are to keep everyone indoors.
Potter blinks, the hesitance fading in his eyes. “Yeah?” A playful grin forms on his lips. His right hand forms a loose fist that encircles his prick, and he begins to stroke himself, his thumb smearing pre-come all over the head. “You sure?”
"Reminds me of Astoria. What you just said about showing me the world. She loves Disney. Aladdin, if I'm not wrong." Malfoy’s smile dims when Harry frowns. "This is what I meant when I said I need time. I just got out of a long-term relationship. Let's take the time to know each other better, see where that takes us." He tugs Harry closer and leans back on the sofa. Harry leans on Malfoy’s chest, making a happy sound when Malfoy hugs him tight.
Harry chokes on his tea, and Minerva waits for him to recover. “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely… er… go hard,” he says rather weakly, feeling incredibly awkward. He finishes his biscuit and tea, cleans up the crumbs, and bids goodbye to Minerva and Dumbledore. When he’s at the door, Minerva’s voice stops him.
"Okay, fine, maybe a lot more than a few times. I saw him tonight." Harry tells her about their antagonistic interactions. "It clearly meant nothing to him, and I feel so silly about it all, after what I told him that night..."
Draco knows what the colon and parenthesis means, thanks to his students’ note passing. He stares at the card, the roses, and then back at the card again.
“We’ll take Rose out for a walk while you and Ron sort things out, yeah?” Harry offers, squeezing Hermione’s shoulders.
His thoughts screech to a stop when Potter laughs, a giddy and joyful sound that cuts through Draco's doubts and insecurities. "What am I going to do with you, you gorgeous, lovely bastard? Of course I'll have dinner with you.” Before Draco can react, his mind still reeling at Potter's words, the other man is pulling him close, cupping his face with his hands, and they're finally
Harry alternates between concentrating on Malfoy's hole and sweeping the flat of his tongue along his crease in a steady pace. Malfoy clutches his pillow, his head hanging as he bounces his hips, pressing his arse back to Harry’s face in a plea for more.
Malfoy groans. "Remember that, where it is, 'cause I'm gonna come so hard when you fuck me there.” His words spiral up into a loud cry when Harry pushes in again, a little harder and faster. "Just like that, don't stop. One more, c'mon, one more.”
"Listen to yourself," Malfoy says, leaning forward. "You know the major events of my life, and after that it was just sex—" He raises a hand, silencing Harry, who was close to rebutting. "Sex, and our messy history. That's all we've shared. Is it enough to sustain a relationship? Enough to know that we can be together long-term?"
It takes a few seconds for Harry to register the Popper; he can barely tear his gaze away from Malfoy, who is at the next aisle tidying up the WonderWitch display with his back turned to Harry. At the sizzling sound of the firework, Harry turns towards it, only to yelp and jump back, revealing himself.
They exit the pub and walk in silence to Harry's home. A part of him still can’t believe it — is Draco really beside him, in London? He really wants to hold his hand, but he’s not sure how Draco would take it. "I'm afraid there's no chicken roll cart here," Harry quips, drawing a laugh from Draco. With that, the mood lightens, and Harry relaxes.
your fault that I’m here. I do have a very delicate constitution,” Draco says around a sigh of pleasure and nuzzles into Potter’s chest. He knows he’s acting like putty in Potter’s hands, but he loves being at the centre of Potter’s attention, and it’s even sweeter being pampered by Potter.
At the forest’s edge on the lower right side of the tattoo, there are three pairs of footprints placed side by side. The tattoo of the footprints is tiny. The feet cross the width of Potter's back, leading to a second landscape tattoo near Potter's right hip.
Malfoy's thighs clench, and Harry glances at the movement. Lust shudders through him when he realises Malfoy is hard. "Felt bloody long. Knowing that you were waiting for me. Sending me letters like that when I'm so far away." Harry's grin widens into something predatory, and he spreads his thighs just enough for Malfoy to see what he's offering.
Draco’s thighs clench at once, lust surging at Potter’s words, but he tamps it down, forcing his rage back to centre stage. Incensed, he aims a fist at Potter’s side, but gasps in pain when Potter dodges and his knuckles connect with the floor instead.
Draco reaches for his whisky and brings it up. He swirls it in the glass, noting how Potter stares at his long fingers. Draco lifts the glass to his lips and takes a slow, leisurely sip, regarding Potter over the rim of the glass as he drinks.
“Look at you,” Potter says. “Look at you take it, come all over me, come for me, look at you,” he chants under his breath as he pounds Draco hard into the mattress. All it takes is one look at Potter: brilliant green eyes bright with lust and desire, the red-hot flush on his neck and chest, the sweat glistening on his face, those sexy as
Excitement floods through him as he scurries towards Malfoy, stopping behind him. Oh, there it is, a perfect treacle tart, the hot, irresistible treacle still bubbling away. Harry can’t help the grin plastered all over his face as he gazes lovingly at it, his eyes following as it soars through the air when Malfoy levitates it onto a cooling tray on the counter. Malfoy bends down, hunching until he’s eye-level with the tart. He turns the tray in a circle, studying the tart at all angles, Merlin, the crust is
“I’m so sorry,” she says. She loosens her chignon, letting her curls tumble over her shoulders. She has dressed up not for Draco, but for Weasley. Her engagement ring sparkles on her finger, but what’s the point of proposing if Weasley’s not going to be around anyway?
“You and your presents,” Harry says around an affectionate laugh. He bumps his shoulder against Draco’s and entwines their gloved fingers together. Draco tugs his black knit cap over his conspicuous blond hair and inches closer to Harry until their arms are pressed flush against each other. He revels in the heat of Harry’s body that’s so much better at warming him up than his mug of mulled wine. He inhales deeply — the Gryffindor scarf wound around his neck still smells like Harry.
Potter is pulling on a T-shirt and knee-length shorts. He rolls up the mat, puts on his glasses, gathers his things and tucks them under his arm. Whistling, he strolls towards the castle, clueless about his role in Draco’s fevered imagination and public orgasm.
Potter wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. “Unlike us. We were a right nightmare to Hooch, yeah?” He tosses the bottle on the grass and sits down on the stands beside Draco. “With Neville’s Remembrall,” he adds, chuckling.
"Hey, Porks," Harry greets, toeing off his shoes and socks. He places the bag in front of her, and there's a rustling of paper as Pork Chop noses into the bag. "I cast a warming charm on it, so it should still be alright." He shrugs off his robe, jumper and his shirt, and grabs the comfortable, baggy AC/DC T-shirt on his bed.
Potter's eyes flicker to the side when Draco looks up. Potter's been sneaking furtive glances at Draco throughout the entire dinner, his gaze equal parts heated and playful. He returns his gaze to Draco's exposed collarbone, his lips turning up in a smirk.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that,” Harry says, contrite. He squeezes Malfoy’s hands. “I should have told you the truth — that I’m starting to have feelings for you and I wanna get to know you better.” He suddenly thinks of Malfoy bopping along to Led Zeppelin and he smiles. "I really want to."
However, the Slytherins had well and truly disrupted Harry's routine two months ago. He had known that something was happening to the old bookstore across the street — judging by the ongoing construction work, but it was summer, which meant a flurry of garden parties and picnics and an onslaught of orders for Sugarcoated.
"I can't," he says. He's so close to a complete breakdown, but the grimace of discomfort that flashes across Hermione's features as she hugs her stomach, recalls him to the task at hand.
" Potter gasps when he hears Draco's voice. He withdraws his fingers and Draco lets out a long, unhurried moan when he feels Potter pressing his cock against the crease of his arse, dragging it up and down infuriatingly slow, teasing him-
Harry is disappointed, knowing that Malfoy is no longer near him, as if he's missing something. He washes the mugs and places them on the rack to dry. He turns around, his back to the sink and his palms resting on the edge. He doesn't know if it's a good time to talk about this, but Harry really needs some advice, and who better to help him than Charlie, Malfoy's closest friend in Hogwarts?
"Harry's never admitted it to us, and I can't believe I'm saying this... but we think Harry's got a thing for Malfoy too," Ron pipes up, wrinkling his nose.
"I'll see you at the Leaky tomorrow," Hermione says, standing up and leaving a few pounds on the table.
They spent quite some time in the prefects’ bathroom too, with Malfoy in his lap and gripping his shoulders as they rubbed up against each other in the tub. They returned to the Room of Requirement, making good use of the same wingback bed (still scattered with rose petals), indulging in another sixty-nine.
Harry plops down on the bed, his eyes roaming to the variety of jars and tubes of lubricant on the nightstand. He twists open a red jar, sniffs it and gags at the cloying scent of strawberry. He flicks through the selection, finally settling on a tube of clear, non-scented lube and putting it on the bed.
Harry crosses the distance between them, stands behind Malfoy and places his palms on Malfoy's hips. He sways his hips to the music, hinting that Malfoy should do the same. With his lower lip caught between his teeth, Malfoy bites back a moan, closes his eyes and throws his head back on Harry's shoulder, exposing his gulping throat to the crowd while they dance together. Malfoy slides his hands up to the back of Harry's neck, pulling him even closer and then returns his descending hands back to his own body — fingers pointing southwards — down his chest yet again, entangling his fingers with Harry's, their fingertips ghosting the waistband of Malfoy's thong-
"I swear on Merlin's pants, if they've blown up the rose bushes..." Draco grumps as they emerge from their bedroom.
The next morning, Weasley had greeted Draco with a mug of coffee and a bacon butty, Draco’s favourite. They had exchanged tentative smiles, and that was one of the turning points in their deepening friendship.
Cornered, and still mired in his quicksand of memories, Draco lurches up to his feet. His eyes dart to the exit and he croaks out a flimsy excuse. "We'll continue this another day."
"I want my dessert now. Now, please, I'm so ready for you, fuck me good again, I want it," Harry begs, snaking a desperate hand down to palm at Malfoy's erection.
Harry swears under his breath. He lunges at his phone and answers Xu Jian's call, noting the details of his Portkey to Shanghai, which will activate in fifteen minutes. He hangs up and sighs.
Harry's expression of determination dissolves into bliss, and he repeats it, nudging his prick on that sensitive bundle of nerves. They're rediscovering each other, that same sizzling sexual chemistry burning up the sheets, and with every hard thrust, Harry's mind is unravelling, his brain short-circuiting. The thought of stopping, of pulling out of Malfoy eventually is agonising—
Draco huffs. "When did you do this? And... how?" He asks, tilting his head in question. He doesn't feel any hint of magic on the doll.
"You're wearing those tight jeans again. They're really tight. Especially when you bend over," Harry murmurs.
Nowadays, Harry still sees the other Slytherins — Pansy, Blaise and Greg — during pub nights. Luna is going out with Greg, while Blaise just told Harry that he’s going to propose to Pansy soon. It took a long time and much effort on both sides for the Gryffindors and Slytherins to smooth over the fraught tensions of the war, even with Luna’s patient nudging, but they eventually put aside their respective reservations and formed a budding friendship, agreeing that the future mattered more than the past. Although Harry isn’t particularly close to the Slytherins, he can safely say they’re friends. The Slytherin wit and sarcasm really is quite amusing when you’re not at the receiving end. The first time Luna arrived with the Slytherins in tow, Harry steeled himself for Malfoy’s appearance too.
"No!" he shouts. "Hermione’s due soon, I can't be dead, I have to be there for her! Rose needs her father!"
Draco’s familiar stirrings of Potter-related lust amplify when Potter fiddles with something under the water, pulling off his pants and then lobbing them towards his clothes.
His face engulfed in a hot blush of embarrassment, Draco shakes Harry's arm away. "We've got a house together and a joint Gringotts account, for Salazar's sake! Where did you think this was going?!" He pushes his hair out of his eyes, injecting some semblance of anger into his glare. "Imagine if it were you that found the ring, would you not have come to the same conclusion as I did?"
Draco has carved out a quiet, peaceful career in Hogwarts, and he certainly doesn't need Potter messing things up for him. Besides, why is he decked out in Quidditch gear anyway — flying lessons and Quidditch trials start only two weeks into term.
"Shit.” Harry cups his own leaking prick and squeezes his eyes shut. He sucks in a harsh breath, trying to summon some semblance of control. "Fuck, Draco. This is so hot. You're so hot."
"Didn't think so," Draco smirks and presses his body against the other man. "When I get back here, here's what I want to see: I want you sitting in a chair in your bedroom, and you're going to be wearing nothing but your pants. Got it?"
Nevertheless, Grimmauld Place used to be so cluttered, gloomy and foreboding, so it's refreshing to see what Potter's done with the place — bright paint on the walls and light-coloured furnishings.
When the Glamour dissipates, Harry flinches at the sight of the Dark Mark, something he hasn’t seen in so long that it feels like it belongs to another lifetime. It triggers memories that have long since been buried, but never forgotten — the twisting serpent coiling from the skull's mouth that stained the night sky over the Astronomy Tower during the battle of the lightning-struck tower, enveloping Dumbledore's falling body in a sickly green tinge, and so many more…
Draco snorts in derision. “How long? As long as all the nights I’ve spent dozing off in front of the Floo waiting for you to come home?” He’s releasing all his pent-up frustration, each piercing word designed to wound Harry in the best way possible. “Maybe you should go with Weasley instead, since your schedules match perfectly.”
"He's locked me out again, Hermione. He's locked me out and I don't know how to deal with it,” Harry says, a panicky note entering his voice. He sighs and cards his fingers through his hair.
"You don't like me in all of this?" he asks, indicating his body and the jacket flung hastily on the other side of the sofa.
Harry pairs up with Malfoy for half the time, but when he does his rounds, Malfoy joins Leo and Jason. Just like in Duelling Club, Harry’s gaze wanders to Malfoy, at that familiar grace as he jumps and attempts to score a basket. Not surprisingly, he is a quick study with excellent reflexes and a natural aptitude for sports.
Ron and Hermione understood the enmity; they've got front-row tickets to the punches and insults and kicks that Harry and Malfoy hurl towards each other. But what they don’t understand is that they fight now not to hurt.
Malfoy's head hangs, blond hair grazing the pillow, and he collapses, his elbows and knees giving way until he's face down and arse up for Harry, only for Harry. He chants Harry’s name like he’s praying to a god. His blush has spread from his chest to his neck, that’s how Harry knows he’s close, so fucking close. He keeps up the punishing pace, giving it to him rough and hard, pounding him into the mattress until Malfoy’s an incoherent mess.
How many times has he seen Harry do the same thing during meals at their eighth year when they had struck up an unlikely friendship? Or how Harry pats his hair and rubs the back of his neck whenever he feels nervous or self-conscious, like what he's doing at this very moment?
"Probably won't taste as good as last night, but I reckon it'll do," Malfoy drawls. The corner of his lips hike up into a secretive smirk, and he winks. "Enjoy your dessert."
Sniffling, Draco deposits the glasses on top of his potions manuscripts on the bedside dresser. It's not his dresser — he's currently sleeping at Hermione's. He's been staying over more frequently to look after her in the late stages of her pregnancy. Moreover, he had thought that the change in environment would be a welcome respite from the cacophony of memories that assault him at home.
He rubs the heel of his palm against his chest, sighing. "This notebook…” he says, thumbing through it. "When classes got too boring, Pansy and I would write in it and pass it back and forth. We wrote all sorts of things. Short stories, complaints, musings... anything and everything." Draco lands on a random page with Pansy's handwriting,
Draco is sucked into a maelstrom of memories about the Manor, images that he'd kept at bay for the past two years. After the war, Aurors dragged him from his Ministry holding cell to the Manor. Per their orders, he gave them access to every part of the Manor as they raided it for Dark artefacts. He could only watch as they took his terrified house elves away and plundered his ancestral home, turning it upside down and storming into rooms meant only for Malfoys. Draco trudged through the corridors, his head hanging, leftover horror and trauma dogging his footsteps because every corner reminded him of the Dark Lord’s torture.
Draco tracks the Chaser. After some time, he mutters, "Check Campbell's consumed drugs during scandal, recent Magpies’ scorecard, and performance of other players involved in scandal." In response, his floating Quick-Quotes Quill scratches his notes on a sheet of parchment. As Draco continues to re-watch the match, he rattles off more comments for the Quill, finally concluding with "Magpies' winning streak for League Cup affected?"
. He plays with Malfoy’s balls, teasing the soft skin, while his other hand moves up to palm his arse. Malfoy pulls off briefly to let out a loud, ragged groan of pleasure, and then re-doubles his own sucking efforts.
Draco groans at the memory. “If I had known that that would make you the youngest Seeker in a century, I wouldn’t have done that at all.” He sits up straight, focusing on his second purpose of attending today’s lesson. “I’ve been a prat since my first year here as a student, and once again, at your first year on the faculty. I would like to apologise for that day. You clearly backed off, but I was the one that goaded you.” He indicates Potter’s eye. “I’m glad that your injury has healed.”
"Bet you would have loved to fuck me right outside Sin, yeah? So eager for it tonight, I had to force us to walk back to your place to get myself under control, but you know what? The entire walk back to your place? I was thinking of how we were gonna fuck. Wanted our first time to be slow and sexy like this, seduce you like this, but I fucked you with my clothes still on, couldn't wait one second longer-" Malfoy licks a strip up Harry's neck, making Harry's body seize up with desire.
Harry doesn't even give him a chance to speak. "Your fiancée? A woman? If it was a bloke—" he pauses when Malfoy frantically casts a Silencing Charm, "With another bloke, I'd understand, but a woman?"
"We've already delivered your last letters to them," Kingsley says. He takes a deep breath and exhales heavily through his nose. "Your memorial services will be in two weeks."
Harry doesn't even know when his shirt became hiked up, his jeans yanked open, the waistband of his pants tugged down. All he knows is that they are. He straightens his glasses, not wanting to miss anything when Malfoy kisses his way down his chest, the heat of his mouth shivering on his skin. Malfoy removes Harry’s shoes and socks. Harry’s breath comes short and shallow, his heart hammering away in his chest when he lifts his hips, allowing Malfoy to tug his jeans and pants down to his ankles, before he kicks them off.
"So you used to fancy him?" Harry manages, frantically ransacking his mind to turn this conversation to his favour.
Despite all of the furore, Harry had also assigned two junior Aurors to keep a discreet eye on Malfoy in case any of Labelle's lackeys decided to come after him.
"Eleven thirty, room fifteen at Portkey Central," Harry says, even though he knows he shouldn’t expect anything. "Take care, Draco," he whispers, the words stuck in his throat.
He's trapped in a clear plastic bubble of a world, disconnected from the people around him. His anger has drained dry, leaving behind in its wake grief, depression, and another intense, screeching sort of pain that feels like it could break him as easily as a bone. Some days when things are particularly bad, Draco imagines a giant, skeletal hand reaching down his throat, all the way down to his gut and extracting everything that is good and true and
"Talk me out of it," Harry pleads. He waits expectantly, his gaze flickering between his two best friends. He waits for Hermione to fold her hands in her lap and launch into her usual lectures. He waits for Ron to shrug, wearing an easy smile as he nods along to Hermione, jumping in occasionally.
Ron and Harry part in the lift, with Harry stopping at Auror HQ while Ron continues on to Magical Games and Sports.
"You've lost weight," Draco says. He takes a step closer and stretches a hand out, as if to touch Harry's jaw, but catches himself, withdrawing.
Harry closes the distance between them and drives his cock as deep as he can, before turning Malfoy on his side. It’s a new position, and from his experience, he knows he can go deeper at a better angle.
As usual, Draco couldn’t help but marvel at Potter’s devil-may-care attitude about things, like how he paid no heed to the media storm when he came out. That night, Draco sat on his bed, his heart softening. With a silly, dopey smile like a first-year’s, he peeled off the foil on the chocolate and ate it, sighing in bliss when the silky-smooth candy melted in his mouth.
A hot sear of arousal shatters through him when Malfoy touches the tip of his tongue on his upper lip, his murmur full of promise and mouth quirking up in a sly smile that has all of Harry's synapses firing. "Let's talk tomorrow morning, shall we?"
There's no space in Harry's brain except for the image of Draco's blowjob cherry lips curved into a pout, and Harry's parting those lips with his fingers, and then with his cock—
"So close," Draco murmured and pushed his erection urgently into Harry's hand. Harry didn't know if Draco meant the jogger or his own orgasm.
“But not like this…” Malfoy releases Harry and looks around. He casts a privacy charm, and then points his wand at the ground, rolling away the pebbles and rocks, leaving only damp grass. Malfoy takes off his jacket, and lays it on the ground. “Lie down,” he says, and Harry does so, lying on the jacket. With deft hands, Malfoy strips Harry, tossing his tie and belt on the roses. Harry kicks off his shoes, trousers and pants. When he moves clumsy hands to his shirt buttons, Malfoy takes over.
"Look at you," Malfoy whispers. He touches his own throat, glazed-over eyes glued to Harry's cock. With a slow smile, Harry indulges in a wank, pumping his hips slow and steady, the head of his cock sliding through the circle of his hand. Lube drips off his prick, and Malfoy's lips part in desire. They stare at each other, and Harry drinks in the sight of Malfoy spread out in bed like this, just for him. And this is when it truly hits him, this immensity of the moment, coupled with this thundering lust and emotion so strong and encompassing that it takes his breath away.
Draco stops pacing and plops down on the bed. He begins to narrow down his options, counting them off his fingers.
They pull apart after a moment; chests heaving, kiss-swollen lips glistening and eyes shining with life; a fire that only either can ignite in the other. Desire thrums in Harry's veins, and he acts on that, pulling the other boy closer and angling his head so that his lips brush against Malfoy's neck.
“Good for you,” Potter scoffs, unimpressed. “My first attempt at dancing was just a week before the Ball itself, you git. Ron actually had to dance with McGonagall,” — he blanches — “Does… does this mean that Snape taught the Slytherins how to dance?”
The words are like ice-cold water dousing Harry’s heat. "I hope you'll be very happy together," he says, a growl building at the back of his throat. "I'm sure she'll make a beautiful bride and a loving mother to your children." He turns away from Malfoy and presses his elbows on the banister, shoulders slumping and head hanging.
Harry grins at the thought of Malfoy hunched over his work-bench, surrounded by cauldrons, ingredients, vials and scrolls of parchment. "It suits him. He’s always been keen on that," he blurts out.
Holding his gaze, Potter moves closer, foam rippling around his hips. Draco sucks in a harsh breath, his body tensing and his eyes wandering. The bubbles pop, soap glistens on Potter’s shoulders and chest. He stares at Potter’s chest hair, and then at the narrow trail of hair down his abdominals, his navel, before widening into a thick nest of black curls, fuck, he can almost see the outline of Potter's swelling prick—
"Yes, so good for… oh!" Malfoy gasps when Harry eases a finger in, working him open in a gentle, tender slide. He sprinkles a necklace of kisses on the base of Malfoy's throat when he adds another finger. Harry kisses him on the mouth, swallowing his moan when he begins to scissor his index and middle fingers. Malfoy is so tight and warm, and the thought of pushing his throbbing cock inside sends another wave of lust thundering through Harry.
"Ogden's, please," Harry smiles. Jacob bustles back to his arsenal of alcohol and Harry shifts his attention back to Malfoy. Malfoy's engrossed in a serious conversation with his companion, judging by the way he's gnawing on a knuckle and frowning. He's wearing a dark-blue collared shirt with the sleeves folded up to his forearms, revealing his Dark Mark. Malfoy pushes blond hair away from his neck and Harry spots the Azkaban serial number printed across his pale skin. Malfoy picks up his drink, long fingers twirling the stem of the glass. Harry watches as Malfoy lets the cherry rest briefly against his lips before popping it in his mouth.
"Let's make it into a competition." Ron shrugs his shoulders casually. "Say, the first person that gets the tart from Malfoy wins."
Draco closes his eyes, summoning his self-control, which rapidly deserts him when Potter claws at the hem of his shirt, tugging them from his trousers—
Harry shifts his knees on the bed. "Get your sexy legs around me," he rasps. Malfoy obeys, wrapping his legs around Harry's waist, hooking his ankles together and resting his soles on Harry’s back. This opens him up more, and with a racing heart, Harry slides deeper into him, the drag of his cock excruciatingly slow until he's fully seated inside him. It's as brilliant as he remembered; this tight warmth consuming Harry, this overwhelming sensation reducing him to his primal instincts to thrust and fuck, to claim and control.
Draco tells himself when all he wants to do is run to Potter's room. He glances at his clock — it's ten thirty on a school night, this surely can wait until tomorrow.
“I reckon that’s why I found him familiar, because he’s yours,” Harry says, smiling at Humphrey. “What’s his name? It starts with an
Draco is secretly relieved at the change in topic. He’s still an outsider when it comes to Hogwarts's Golden Trio, so it's strange to give her advice about Potter. He makes a sound of annoyance. "Some of my clients need a proper kick up their arses. Pointlessly clinging to letters and gifts from ex-lovers that mean nothing, and then sobbing into their shirts when sentimental things trigger a landmine of nostalgia and memories long gone. Salazar, I had to make the daughter a cup of tea in her own home!" he exclaims, punctuating his disbelief by widening his eyes.
Potter's skin is stitched with golden sunlight, keeping Draco warm and chasing away all of his demons.
!" Potter howls. It's how Potter drips sex all over his name, how his arse clenches tight around his cock, the crescent marks of Draco's fingernails littered all over Potter's hips that drives Draco over the edge. He pulls out, squeezes his cock once, twice, and then he shoots his load all over Potter's arse and lower back, coming so
"Say it properly," Malfoy commands. He pulls his fingers out and begins to lube his prick, his eyes never leaving Harry's face.
Harry's gaze flickers between them, and he withdraws his hand. "If it becomes more... maybe a long-term thing... would it bother you?" They've clearly been discussing this without his knowledge, and he isn't sure how to feel about this, that his friends have come to terms with it even before he has.
comes on the radio. Well, not exactly the same way... his mouth goes dry when Malfoy snaps his fingers, turns around, sticks his arms out and rolls his shoulders, his hips moving in sync with the music. He smooths blond hair away from his face as he continues to dance and hum. Harry's eyes hook onto the genuine smile blossoming across Malfoy's lips, how it lights up his face and transforms it. Green eyes slide to the elegant turn of pale wrists. Malfoy's looking terribly professional in his pristine white chocolatier uniform, while Harry knows he looks rather sloppy when he bakes in his T-shirt and jeans.
Harry's original intent had been to gloat, but Malfoy's sitting right there in Sin and tucking into Harry's chocolate desserts with a pleasure that's almost... sexual. Harry's eyes are as wide as dinner plates as he watches the trail of white chocolate dripping down the other man's hand, at the tip of Malfoy's tongue that darts out between a set of full lips, licking from wrist-bone to thumb.
closer. In response, a thrum of pleasure shivers down Harry's spine. "Welcome to Serpentes," Malfoy murmurs, his voice as light as silk, fingertips grazing the delta of veins under Harry's wrist.
the one to break Malfoy's polished, pristine composure, revealing this glimpse of Malfoy from the past.
The tinny sound of a Christmas melody rings through the cafe, jarring Harry from his thoughts. Ayumi laughs when a young girl presses a switch on a tiny sleigh to play another festive song.
Theo backpedals, tidying the quills on his desk, which are already arranged by size. "You mean the courting bit?"
He cries out as a last resort just before Ron's Body-Bind Curse reaches full effect. Draco's head turns towards his direction, but Ron is already towing him away, hissing spells to clear their footprints. Harry's heart is breaking all over again, the warm promise of Draco's touch disappearing like a lifeline. He mentally screams Draco's name in a frenzy, hoping against hope that maybe Draco could hear, maybe he would know
After Harry left the Academy, he visited Charlie at Romania, just to see if the sanctuary was a possible career option. He met Pork Chop there. In the end, he didn't leave with a job, but a pet snake. She was furious and distrustful of humans after her terrifying encounter, but under Charlie and Harry's patient and tender care, she healed, morphing into this snarky, pork chop-loving, smart-arse snake that they've come to know and love.
Fine. He'll figure out what he really wants during hols, although he already suspects he's made up his mind — he wants Malfoy, both in his bed and in his life. He’s fallen for him — attracted to his patient smile and words when he teaches, his resilience and perseverance, and their quiet, thought-provoking midnight conversations.
Whenever Harry needs a holiday, Ron is always his go-to person to look after the bakery. The next best person is Hermione, but if she's busy, then well, the point of the matter is that Harry has no shortage of friends he can turn to.
"Goodnight," Harry says, raising a hand and flashing him a lopsided smile. He summons an empty container and begins to put the treats away.
, just like what he always does when he's out in the field, but he remembers the oath that they had taken as Aurors, their duty-bound promise to Kingsley, and the final closure of this case that has already claimed so many lives.
"You're narrowing our profit margin by wasting perfectly good merchandise," Blaise pointed out in his best professional voice, trying to drown out the sound of vigorous kissing.
"I mean… I'd like it if you came back." Potter gives Draco a meaningful look. "I'd definitely like it if you returned."
"Right." Harry drains his beer, wipes his palms on his jeans, and pats his hair. The three of them ease out of their booth, and make their way to Draco.
He tosses his towel on the bed and walks to his table, unfolding Hermione's letter again. He smiles at her handwriting.
Harry's sobs intensify. His heart feels like it’s cracking in his chest. It's so tempting to reply with a
Potter nods his head eagerly. "Yes, yes, oh please!" A surge of renewed lust floods Draco's veins, and he sinks his teeth in Potter's neck, sucking and growling possessively while Potter clings to him and grinds their cocks together.
"I should bloody well hope so!" Ron casts another disbelieving look at Harry, who merely shrugs and tucks into his food. Ron prods his lasagne with his fork. After a moment, he looks up. "That's why you came home so late last night looking so bloody pleased with yourself. I should've known." He throws a dark look at the tarts on Harry's tray. "No way I can top that."
Malfoy pulls his gaze away from the picture. "Yes." His smile fades. "Among other things," he mutters darkly, a familiar tension seeping into his features. He puts down the photograph and looks around, taking stock of the sparse furnishings of the flat.
Charlie appears, his eyes widening at a conscious Potter. He raises his eyebrows at their clasped hands; Draco shifts away, but Potter holds on tighter. Draco fights to keep the growing smile off his face.
They finish their business at the serving line, although Harry chooses his food slower than usual, hoping to see if Malfoy will emerge. But he doesn't, and with disappointment tugging on his heart, he follows Ron to their table. He takes out the napkin, and together, they look at it. There has been no progress since Ron got that extra helping of chips.
"It’s not my fault you’ve got a thick skin," Draco jabs back without bite. Harry laughs and sips on his coffee.
Malfoy's eyes twinkle. "Oh, really? We'll see about that, then." He promptly pushes Harry up against the edge of the table—
"Harry's here already, I ran into Horace on the way here and he told me." Charlie looks at him, his words hesitant when Draco’s lips thin at the mention of Potter. "You'll be alright, yeah? You've always had a... history with him, and more recently, with the whole... Auror thing..." he trails off uncertainly.
Draco pauses in his whisking of egg whites and reaches out to touch a framed photograph of his family in happier times. "If only you could see me now," he murmurs. "I'm not doing something befitting of a Malfoy, but I hope you're proud of me nevertheless. I've got a job doing what I love, friends that care about me, and I'm home."
Malfoy scrambles on top of him in a sixty-nine position — Harry is careful to guide Malfoy’s long legs to the correct arrangement; the last time Harry tried this, the other bloke whacked him on the temple with his knee. Malfoy doesn’t even reply to Harry’s “
Harry did mention before that he was interested to know more about Malfoy's inventions, so it’s hardly George’s fault if he was merely granting Harry’s wish, wasn’t it?
Extremely pleased at Potter's reaction, Draco grins. He grabs an empty glass, fills it up with water from the tap and downs it.
There's a similar longing reflected in Harry's eyes, but how could that be? How could Harry ever want him like he wants Harry?
"Of course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, Golden Boy!" Draco had mocked, rubbing the inside of his left arm absently. "Do you think people will still come if they knew that a Death Eater was making their favourite desserts? It's my business, so go and stick your nose somewhere else!"
— He's so high on Harry, floating on a cloud of carnal pleasure and he doesn't want to get down, oh no he doesn't—
Potter remains silent, and Draco is grateful for that. His words emerge easier now, as if some sort of dam has broken, releasing suppressed memories. He places the recipe back in the box and picks up his family ring, always worn by his father.
"What you told me… just now when we were…” Harry’s skin still thuds with Malfoy's touch, those words of meaning and adoration were like a balm, soothing his heart. And now, for Malfoy to turn it all upside down and say that it didn't mean anything…
. He swerves to the right, trying to catch a space large enough to squeeze a curse, but the soldiers are too responsive to Malfoy's movements, staying right in front of him. After a brief standoff, the suits of armour stand to attention and salute Malfoy, before clomping back to their resting places.
"Demanding git," Draco says. He conjures some lube on his fingers and circles Potter’s rim with two fingers. Potter gasps at his touch, pushing back eagerly. Licking his lips, Draco slides his index finger in, easing through the tight ring of muscle. His eyes closed, Potter tilts his head back and lets out a needy moan as Draco takes his time in preparing him.
strange. "He doesn't have your eyes, though. He's got green eyes. The greenest eyes you've ever seen, like freshly cut grass on a Quidditch pitch."
"Besides, I think you'd enjoy it," Malfoy says, his tone silky and confident. He advances towards Harry. The sudden proximity of the other man, along with his heady vanilla scent, makes Harry's breath hitch. Malfoy grins in a self-satisfied manner and lifts a hand to tuck a finger under Harry's chin. He brushes his thumb on Harry's lower lip.
"I don't have to do anything," Malfoy scoffs in that imperious tone that he knows so well. Harry's hands curl up into fists — bloody hell, after everything that has happened, he still doesn't know whether he should punch or kiss the living daylights out of Draco Malfoy.
A heartbeat passes, Malfoy frowns, and Harry quickly shakes Malfoy's hand. He notices that Malfoy didn't bother introducing himself as the owner, as if Harry was
"You better come before them then," Harry replies, tongue held cheekily between his teeth. "All off, except the shirt."
Draco squints up at the charcoal sky and sighs at the weary grey clouds. In the horizon, lightning rattles the sky, and Draco flinches, steeling himself for the incoming clap of thunder.
"Wait!" Harry says, and to his surprise, Malfoy pauses. Harry doesn’t know what he wants to say; all he knows is that he wants to see more of him — not this sullen, reserved Malfoy, but the radiant Malfoy who sings and plays the guitar. It makes no bloody sense, but Merlin, he does. That pull towards Malfoy, tingling just under Harry's skin, has lain dormant for years, and it's now returning in full force.
Potter shakes his head. "Nothing. Looking forward to this Saturday’s game? Think you’ll have lots to write about for the paper."
This is the first time they’ve kissed out in the open; before this, all of their clandestine meetings have been held behind closed doors, their kisses hoarded away like polished jewels gleaming in tinkling music boxes, but something’s changed irrevocably tonight. Fresh night air breezes across Draco’s skin, ruffling his hair and breathing life into their relationship. Their kisses are no longer secret, no longer sheltered and tucked away.
The Keepers exhausted all efforts to track her with their ageing equipment and limited manpower. When they finally figured out her destination, they tried to catch up, but getting approval from the Ministries for emergency Portkeys was a major problem too. By the time they took the Portkey and flew to Hogwarts, they reached moments after the dragon touched solid ground.
"Yeah, got that." Harry knows that Theo's willingness to tell him this is a testament to their unlikely friendship (although Theo would rather endure a week-long stakeout than admit that to anyone).
"Only if I can come home to you," Harry replies. He pauses, relishing the pleased glow on Malfoy's cheeks. "It could work out? We could work out?"
It's when his fingers brush past a particular spot that Malfoy cries out, his body seizing up. He clenches around Harry, the soles of his feet digging into the bed.
The sun filtering through the windows of the Hogwarts Express sets his fierce green eyes alight and accentuates the harsh line of his clenched jaw, throwing his features into sharp relief.
"Perfect. It all sounds wonderful," Potter murmurs. A warmth, as sweet as honey, suffuses Draco at the sheer happiness radiating from Potter. "I’d love that, but can Porks come along too?" Potter worries his lower lip. "I know you meant it for just the two of us, but she's never been to France, and I've spent every birthday with her since I've had her. She won't be much trouble, really."
Harry hasn't taken his eyes off Malfoy, and neither has the other man. The remains of an amused smile lingers on Malfoy's lips, although his eyes are serious. Snapshots of memories zip through Harry's mind like quicksilver: of their practise duels in the Academy, their fights during the War, and lastly, standing in the Great Hall with their wands raised like this in front of a crowd bristling with excitement, when they were twelve, with Lockhart behind him and Snape behind Malfoy.
Harry sighs. It's so tempting to simply laze on the grass, letting the sights and sounds of the park lull him into a soporific stupor, but he definitely doesn’t want to return to London empty-handed. Nevertheless, Harry's motions are sluggish as he sets up his equipment. He dips his brush in oil, dabs it on the cloth and brings it to his loaded palette. He hesitates.
Ron snaps out of his thoughts. "Hey, couldn't sleep, so—" He pauses, frowning. "What's wrong?" He looks at the love bites on Harry's neck, and Harry slaps a hand on them. "Something happened between you and Malfoy."
Draco drags his gaze away from Harry reluctantly. When he looks at Ron and Hermione, he visibly recoils. His eyes flicker to Hermione's left arm, where her Mudblood scar is, and even though he's as tall as Ron, Draco doesn't meet his eyes, instead propping his guitar in front of him, like a shield.
The next day, Harry is working on a watercolour when Draco owls over a picture of himself and the Slytherins at Greg’s place. The following night, when Draco is at Grimmauld, guitar in hand and scraps of lyrics littered in front of him, he excitedly tells Harry that he’s writing a song for Pansy and Blaise.
"Then let's get Draco, Hermione and Rose, and then we'll go to the Burrow for dinner, just like what we do every year!"
"Of course I don't want you to go, you bloody idiot!" Draco shouts, slamming the pot down. "You disappear for a year, and then you return, and it's been absolute heaven for the past month, being with you again, and now you tell me you're going to someplace so far away for two months? How could you think I would want you to go?!" he rages. He rinses his hands and shuts the tap so hard the faucet rattles.
So that's how the three of them found themselves as co-owners of an up-and-coming chocolatier: Draco being in charge of the food, Blaise taking care of the money and Pansy handling everything else.
He tightens his grip on his broom. Instead of meeting Potter most evenings, he’s gone back to flying, back to the one thing that made him feel alive before he discovered Potter.
Draco turns back to the Christmas markets of Diagon Alley, filled with small wooden huts festooned with garlands of green and cheery sprigs of holly. They had threaded through the heaving markets just moments before, marvelling at the wares on sale: traditional handicrafts, delicately-embroidered lace, handmade stained glass jewellery that winked coquettishly up at them. Scarves, hats and gloves adorn stands, flapping gently in the breeze. Draco breathes in; he can smell the fragrance of roasting meats in large ovens and sausages simmering in huge pans. There are kids running wild with small red Santa hats fringed with white trim tucked in their hair, their shouts and giggles echoing in the air while frazzled shoppers weave between shops, their arms brimming with last-minute Christmas purchases. The mood is festive and busy, but the hustle and bustle of the jostling crowd is beginning to wear on Draco.
The twinkling stars shine down on them, and the full moon hangs in the velvet night sky. The view from the Tower is truly romantic, providing an encompassing panorama of the sky, the Great Lake and the grounds beyond.
Harry chances a look at Malfoy, whose face is a jigsaw. But he's definitely watching Harry now, and that thought — of having Malfoy's full, undivided attention on his body as he dances and gyrates and moves and thrusts to a room-full of roaring, hot-blooded men — is driving
Satisfied, Draco places the flowers beside him. Sighing, Potter brushes off the loose petals on his person. Draco rolls his eyes and laces his fingers with Potter's as a reconciliatory gesture, much to Potter's delight.
Sighing, Draco washes the cups and hangs them to dry. Grey eyes snag on Harry's coffee-stained Gryffindor mug. His soapy fingers hover inches away from it. The last time Harry had used this was on the fateful morning when Draco last saw him. He had kissed Harry, dusted off his Auror robes and wished him a safe journey
"Messy?" Draco suggests, gesturing to his chest. His voice is all ragged, and a thrill sparks in Harry when he realises he — or more specifically, his cock — was the one that caused that.
I don't want to remember them like how the history books portray them. They're more than that, so much more than that!" Potter yells, getting up on his knees and grabbing the History of Magic textbook. Agitated, he growls and hurls it at the sofa. "What if I forget about them, Malfoy, what if I
"Good," Malfoy bites out, his tone indicating anything but that. He narrows his eyes at Harry, and a sudden pang of sadness hits Harry — it seems like they're back to square one, that their growing friendship (or maybe even something more, but he doesn't dare think about that) during their time at the Academy is well and truly destroyed.
The bed creaks under them, the headboard rattles against the wall, fingers tighten on creased bedsheets while Draco shudders and trembles and writhes, pleasure circulating in his body like a brand new drug, his cries escalating in intensity and volume as Potter drives into him with a new urgency each time.
He loves how Harry crowded him against his office table, his hands stumbling on Draco's belt and trousers while Draco kicked off his shoes and socks. He wanted so desperately to be naked, along with Harry, but when he reached up to undo his shirt, Harry stilled his hands on his buttons and mumbled, "Love how prim and proper you are at work but how you're such a wild little fuck in bed, keep that on while I fuck you, yeah-"
at the finishing line, where Potter declared himself the winner by sketching a rough doodle of two stick figures. One figure has a lightning-bolt scar and spiky hair shaded black with ink, its arms raised in triumph and standing on a pile of treacle tarts, while the other figure is freckled and scowling.
He can't help but feel rather curious about the identity of the manufacturer. It's clear that the company isn't a big one, judging by the few pet shops that stock the product, along with the address being a residence instead of a factory or an office. Hopefully, this means that it won't take too long; he's got a heavy workload today, even though it's a Saturday.
"Wow," Harry says on an exhale. He moves to a good spot where the light of the waning sun catches the view just right, and he tips his head to the side, imagining it framed in a painting. He snaps a picture with his camera, and hurries to another area, eager to get another perspective.
The predatory spark rekindles in Harry's eyes, and Draco cants his hips against Harry's in encouragement.
When Draco had said at the beginning of the school year that he was excited about the Triwizard Tournament, he was saying it purely from the role of spectator, not as participant.
"Are you... are you all in?" Potter asks between whimpers when Draco withdraws and thrusts back in again.
"Get on," Potter orders, his voice rough. Draco eagerly obeys, his slinky and sexy act thrown to the winds because he'll do anything,
"Now that's not fair," Harry mutters. Nevertheless, he steps to the side. Draco goes to the kitchen, and begins unpacking the food, avoiding Harry's eyes the entire time.
Of course, he ruined it, yeah? Advancing on Malfoy like some... some naked sexual predator when things became too heated at the end, effectively scaring him away.
His bubble of lust pops when a scowling Malfoy whirls around. He scans the queue, and when his eyes find Harry's, his frown eases, and something in his pinched expression softens.
“Not many. Even if I do write new material, I rarely perform them. The audience prefers covers, something they can sing along to.” Malfoy quickly changes the topic. “What places have you visited?”
"Go back to your French girls," Harry snarls and tries to shake himself free. Malfoy holds on and drags him into a deserted corridor. He crowds Harry up against the wall, his forearms on either side of Harry’s head, trapping him. His lips pull up into a triumphant smirk and his grey eyes sparkle as they roam all over Harry's thunderous face and coiled-up body, so ready to fight.
This is probably why Ron emotional-range-of-a-teaspoon Weasley and he, Harry as-observant-as-a-brick-wall Potter are best mates.
He’s the only person that Malfoy has just confided his past to. The noise and the surging crowds melt away, Harry’s attention entirely on Malfoy. Suddenly, a picture barges into Harry’s mind, as vivid as day: Times Square, lit up with its trademark glittering billboards and shops, rain puddles on the ground reflecting the colourful neon lights, but the streets and roads are deserted and hollow, decorated with emptiness…
"Potter," he says. He frowns and tugs off his hairnet (charmed to match the colour of his hair, unlike the other canteen workers with their black hairnets), shaking his hair free. He puffs a breath out, flicking his fringe off his forehead. It's a habit that Malfoy has, ever since Hogwarts. Once again, Harry tamps down the urge to run his fingers through his hair, wondering if the strands are really as soft and silky as they look.
A glint of fury sparks in grey eyes. "At least I have family!" Malfoy shouts, taking a step forward.
. As he bites into the flaky pastry and chases it down with a fortifying gulp of tea, he feels his irritation ebbing away. He looks around and beams in contentment. Everything is exactly as he wants it to be: his ingredients impeccably organised and labelled; his workstation and associated baking paraphernalia so clean that they gleam; and a thick file of upcoming orders. He’s worked hard, and he will not let anyone, especially Potter and his churlish antics, ruin it. Draco finishes his breakfast in a much better mood, washes up and starts the day's work by switching on the radio and pulling on his freshly-laundered work attire.
In the horizon, a tentacle from the Giant Squid breaks through the surface of the Lake and soars up in a jaunty wave. Weasley cheers and waves back, while Granger turns and grins at both Potter and Draco.
Potter pulls his shirt on, and snaps, hurt and angry. "I don't say that to everyone I've slept with. And since we’re on the topic, it sucks, it fucking
"What we gon' do 'bout it?" Harry slurs and begins to nibble, leaving a winding path of blooming love bites on pale skin.
It's like Moaning Myrtle's bathroom in sixth year all over again — Draco's pale and wan face, the despondent slump of his shoulders, the shallow rise and fall of his panicked breaths.
"I figured out I was gay that year too, and you were the first bloke I wanked to, although you're not the only one. Merlin, I can't believe you're still so damn hopeless about this. Just makes me want you even
His heart lifts with hope. He wants to hold him close and never let him go. He wants to sear this into his memory, memorise Malfoy's breathy gasps of his name, this intoxicating slide of skin on skin and the pressure of Malfoy's palms on his chest.
“What I know now is that I can’t leave you. I can’t forget what we’ve become,” Harry continues. Draco feels that familiar blazing rush at the sincerity of Harry’s words and the way he’s looking at him — that intensity and focus directed solely towards Draco which makes his head spin and his blood pound.
"Oh Merlin, I've turned the Golden Boy into a canary." Panicked, Draco begins to pace the lab as he frantically recalls the spells cast on the original Cream.
“Shut up, you big brute. Merlin, you’re heavy,” Draco grunts as he lugs Potter, along with sticking an arm out occasionally to steady Charlie, back to the castle.
Unable to contain himself, Draco opens the box again, gazing at each item. "I don't remember my mother as Narcissa Malfoy, the snooty, uptight wife of a prominent Death Eater. I remember her biscuits, how she spent a lifetime putting my needs before hers. I don't remember my father as the power-hungry megalomaniac, as the Dark Lord's right-hand man on his best days." Draco shrugs. "I harbour no delusions about him, but I choose to remember him as the father who raised me, taught me Quidditch and how to read and write. I remember his love for me; something gentle and subtle, but always there.
Determined, Harry shoots a stunner at their shields, but he's the one that ends up evading the rebounded curse when the shields deflect it. He knows a variant of the Reductor Curse that is strong enough to blast them into pieces, and he raises his wand, poised.
"Yes, but we have many things to sort out,” Malfoy says, and Harry releases the breath that he didn't know he was holding. "We'll talk after you return from Shanghai. See where to go from here." Worry seeps into grey eyes. "Will it be dangerous? Like Melbourne?"
Harry frowns, resentment and irritation cutting through his amusement at Malfoy's jealousy. "Why do I have to justify my actions to you, anyway? You seem rather suppressed yourself. D'you need a mag for your own needs?" he asks, grabbing the mag and dangling it in front of Malfoy.
It's always like this, isn't it, ever since the War? Harry and his friends hatch beautifully-laid plans...
She blinks at his AC/DC T-shirt, raising her eyebrows at the crumbs. Harry hastily wipes them off, looking at her attire—a sleeveless blue blouse that brings out her eyes and black jeans. Her make-up is light, and her hair is tied up into a ponytail. She's prettier like this, someone that Harry can imagine seeing at the grocery store or a café.
When they’re under a street lamp, Harry sneaks a glance at Malfoy’s hair, which is an unsurprisingly unnatural inky black. Harry has dark hair too, but his hair has shades of brown, especially under lights. Malfoy’s hair is short, like sixth year of Hogwarts, and once again, it's bloody disconcerting seeing Malfoy as a brunet. Harry tugs absently on his own messy hair — he has kept it longer, like his fourth year.
"Going back to school nicknames again, are we? Let's see about that, Scarhead!” Draco grunts when a fist slams into his shoulder. He regroups quickly, hauling Potter close and hissing, “You couldn’t have missed me much, could you? All of your fucking conquests in the
Harry should get it out of the way, just like ripping off a plaster. "I'm leaving next Sunday." The words emerge more brusque and abrupt than expected, but a small, spiteful part of him thinks that Draco deserves it. Besides, they both know he can't stay forever — Harry misses London, all his friends and family, Mrs Weasley's cooking, and the familiarity and comfort of his home.
"So you're breaking up with me for my own good?" Potter asks, incredulous. He presses the heels of his palm on his closed eyes. "That doesn't even make any sense! I thought you were happy with me—"
Harry washes the cake down with water. His eyes snag on a photo of the Malfoys displayed prominently at the workspace. It was taken when Malfoy was a young child. He's perched on his father's shoulders, grabbing handfuls of Lucius' hair, and Harry can imagine the laughter burbling from his mouth. His mother trots beside them, her waterfall of long hair swinging as she turns to share a smile with her husband.
"We'll make it work. Trust me," he reassures, his grin sunny with hope and optimism. "I'm gonna be an Auror, you're gonna start your apprenticeship in Potions, and we're gonna get a flat in London together, maybe not too far from Ron and Hermione.”
"No, we've got too much time to make up for," Draco says, shaking his head. "So you'd better start thinking of places you want to go to." He leans forward to kiss Harry on the forehead, but Harry captures his lips in a demanding kiss instead.
"It's alright. I know it's too fast for you, but… but I do. I'll wait for you to say it back,” Potter says, a hopeful smile on his face. “I’ll wait, and it'll be one of the happiest days of my life."
Eventually, his sobs subside. He withdraws from Molly, runs his hands over his face, dashes his tears away, and wipes his nose with his sleeve.
Harry’s mouth waters. Malfoy’s cock is gorgeous — long and curving slightly to the right. He aches to trace his tongue around it, to fill his entire mouth with it. He licks his lips, swallowing his saliva. They’re now naked, save for their unbuttoned shirts.
eager to see this mystery man perform. If he dances as good as he looks, then..." Jacob fans himself theatrically and smirks at Harry, before his expression dissolves into one of concern.
"34th Street, if I recall correctly. We started at 13th Street, and we must've walked at least half to three-quarters of it. Shall we call it a day?"
This is on another level altogether, and Harry would never imagine that dancing with Malfoy tonight would involve such explicit displays,
Harry plasters a tight, thin-lipped smile on his face. "Thank you. Sorry for barging in like that. Please continue." He turns away-
When he locked eyes with Malfoy earlier, he probably shouldn't have glared at him like that, but it's hard to suppress his frustration at their...
When they're finished, Harry tosses the cloth to the side and gathers Draco in his arms. Draco loves how Harry holds him. His embrace is fiercely protective and his presence wonderfully solid. They rest their foreheads together, and Draco's mouth turns up into a brilliant smile at the sight of Harry's glowing smile.
Draco bursts into laughter. "Is that all you've got to say? You give me the best sex of my life and then you say
Harry slumps into a chair, dejected. "So now what? I don't know what to do to... get him back, if he was ever mine to begin with." He looks at Ron and Hermione. "But you're both alright with it, if this thing becomes… serious?" He asks, a waver in his voice.
When he first broached this idea to the rest of the teachers, Charlie Weasley (Professor of Care of Magical Creatures, Head of Gryffindor), who was a new addition to the faculty, frowned and said, "That won't be fair to the other Houses."
Licking his lips, Draco gropes for the waistband of Potter's boxers and removes it. They're both gloriously naked and about to have sex, and that fact alone is enough to bring Draco to full hardness.
"I don't use the rooms upstairs, so they're under a preserving charm," he says, briefly tilting his head back to talk to Draco as they pass the living room. As Draco walks behind Potter, Draco's gaze is drawn to his jeans, admiring the curve of his arse and the backs of his strong thighs. To make matters worse, he’s wearing a black T-shirt which hugs his shoulders in just the right way.
Perhaps a bit of jealousy won't hurt, Harry thinks playfully. With that, Harry throws himself fully in his present company. He rests his wrists on the blond's shoulders and grinds on him, biting back a groan when the man behind him steps closer and rests his erection against Harry's arse.
“I remembered your mother’s presents in school,” Harry says. “I don’t know if you fancy these in particular, but I hope you like them.” This is, of course, a blatant lie, as he grilled Theo mercilessly this morning about Malfoy’s favourite chocolate brands. He popped into Diagon to pick up the sweets during his lunch break, but he didn’t get the exact brands, though, or Malfoy would probably find it suspicious.
Draco turns back to slant a glance towards Harry, his smouldering eyes twilight sultry, hot and intense. His lips turn up into a sinner's smile and he sinks his teeth into his bottom lip, an unwritten plea in his eyes. He shifts his hips up and arches his back, wiggling his arse in the air.
a playful voice chirps in Harry, much to his embarrassment. He nods and steps to the side, allowing Malfoy into Grimmauld Place. Marjorie throws one last look at Malfoy before scampering away to her corner of books in the living room.
