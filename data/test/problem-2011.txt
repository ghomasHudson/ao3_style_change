Pansy just snorts and shakes her head.
“Oh,” he bites his lower lip, nibbling the pout away. “It's all in my stupid head again isn't it? It wasn't real.”
especially. He wonders how Draco feels being here, being here like this, what it means. It occurs to him that he has never wondered enough about Draco's own feelings.

“Hurting Harry, and not in a way that you can just fix like a spell. You

whatever that is. All of a sudden his parents are poised to move back to the manor, Bill and Fleur are headed back to Shell Cottage and Harry is trying to engage him in conversations about whether or not he wants to stay living at Grimmauld Place, or if

This isn't fucking though, at some point into it they both find themselves having to admit it, at least in their own heads, this is the other thing, the one they're still, as adults, too young to name. This is forehead to forehead, silence except for the effort of remembering to breathe; this is the whisper and mutter of kisses and of bodies moving together. This is a cry that is almost weeping but which shudders out like bird song full of joy followed by an exhalation of breath like a candle being blown out on an altar and a shuddering like the world has moved, in which two are one and they burst for the joy of it.

It's like a bloody bombshell, one that everyone else might have already seen land and in the debris of which he has been obliviously running for years. This is more than just lust. How had he never seen it before? How long had it been like this? In fact, only in the face of realising that it is more than lust can he acknowledge to himself that he
“What you have been through, yes, yes nobody else is saying it straight to you because they are all so delicate about the feelings, so English, drinking tea and waiting for the opening up but it does not come because you are all too stiff in the upper lip. I know. I am French, we say things. We see things. And I am seeing you are hating yourself. You are thinking, why am I here with all these stupid people who do not know me and do not understand me? Why are they even caring what I'm feeling when they judge me so harsh? Because your experience of life, of the war, has been from another side, because you are thinking, oh, oh woe is me I am so evil, I have failed at everything, I can never be good again, not moral good, not good at doing things. You are thinking, I am the worst of the worst and I do not deserve to eat, drink and be merry, I do not deserve to sleep without nightmares or be loved by this boy I love -”
Harry thinks, it probably did, the whole arm probably still hurts. Draco holds his left arm in his right hand, almost protectively across his chest.
“We should get going,” he replies, stiffly, buttoning up his shirt, looking back over his shoulder to the bed. Harry is blinking in sleepy befuddlement, squinting at the light, adjusting to the shadows, smiling cautiously at Draco, looking at him – oh looking at him with eyes full of fire and light, in a way he would like to be looked at forever. He stands up a little straighter, feeling beautiful, then his chest does that thing again and he swallows down the wash of warmth and happiness.
“I suppose I can't stop you.” Hermione puts her book down, and perches on a stool instead of settling back into the sofa. Narcissa waits for a gesture from the girl before taking a seat, noticing, when she eventually gets the gesture, that the girl does not take her left hand off her right arm.
“Shut up. Just talk to him, okay – please? He keeps asking for you anyway.”
like being drunk; he reaches what feels like a far too floppy arm for Draco, wanting - “You do the music.”
“Seven years -” Draco starts to say, and Harry does not know if he means it's
“Go,” she says, shooing him with hand gestures - “Go on get out of here. You have a date on the roof most of this room would
“I wasn't going to tell you that -”
It's easy to start, and familiar, Harry only has to say
“Oh what, like I've never been in here with half naked Quidditch players before? Don't flatter yourself.”
Draco looks at him suspiciously.
Draco makes a grunting sound in agreement and is halfway out into the corridor before calling back -
“Guys, shut up!”Hermione attempts to elbow everyone simultaneously and practically succeeds - “Fireworks are starting.”
“Yes I remember -” Jean nods suddenly - “Hermione mentioned a Malfoy – Draco was it? She said he was a -” she realises whats he is about to say and to whom and stops herself - “They – um – didn't get on,” she amends tactfully.
“I'm sure I don't know what you -”
“Take my hand.”
Hermione puts her head on the desk, thinking; this is how she ends up falling asleep here so often she thinks, but does nto really mind. It occurs to her, listening, that the library is actually silent today. The books have stopped snapping and clattering in anger at her very presence. She tentatively lifts the cover of one, curious; it hisses a little but does not bite, which is such an imprvement she raises her eyebrows. It's Narcissa's influence, she suspects, clearly. She has proved such an unexpected ally. It occurs to Hermione that she had come close herself to being too prejudiced against her to allow this; needing to find someone alive to blame for the horrible

though she has to remember that it is not as she heads away, note in hand.
“Yeah.” He slides down the stone, not caring what the moss and rock do to the back of the cream waistcoat, and holds his face in his hands. “It was like I was bloody well back there,” he whispers very quietly. Pansy waits.

“Now I have rehearsal.”
“Well, we're grateful,” he says.

Each footstep down the path to the pitch is like a snap shot, a memory, every breath a song of what a place used to be. These breaths offered up to the chill October air hover long after they have passed, plumes of frosty smoke left in their wake; here we go, he thinks, making ghosts of ourselves again.
of all places? But then the music swishes out like a wand casting a healing spell, the colours wrap around him in what feels like an apology, and Draco – the lighting makes his own dark mark stand out stark black on white and it doesn't look evil, it never did on him, no matter what he might have once thought or still thinks- just startlingly beautiful and edgy and raw, as though it was his skin he had rolled up not his sleeves, exposing his heart to the world. All of a sudden he's transported back to the Astronomy tower that night and he can see the fear and fury on a face trying to twist those things into pride as he exposed that mark for the first time and he realises with complete clarity why he ran away so hard last night.
George waves the apology away.

Pansy turns on her heel only just slow enough for Draco to get out a -
She feels humbled, asking this girl's advice, but it occurs to her that pragmatism suggests she take it. The girl is clever, clear headed – more or less -and she knows Potter. However well she herself is able to appear detached, she is far too biased to consider both boys dispassionately. There are cracks in her heart she can only stitch together with will power and self control, stitches which strain every time her baby shivers and shakes on her with nightmares. She is holding so much of his grief inside her chest there is no room to be as objective as she would like. It occurs to her that this girl, however well balanced she appears, can only be suppressing griefs of her own in whichever way she does it, and it occurs to her like a sudden revelation what griefs the greatest of those must be. She has to test to see if she is correct.
Something goes wrong. Harry finds himself holding on to Draco's wrist for just a little too long, and he's not even really staring at Draco's arm but it feels to Draco like he

word from
next, sometimes it goes on for a long time and Harry bears it because he gets it, because he has heard his own soul scream like that enough times himself. Sometimes, after all, this all goes the other way around, but not as often. He's been building walls against the things that hurt him since he can remember; Draco hasn't. He's made himself hard in so many ways with all those walls; Draco hasn't. He simultaneously finds it adorable and despairs at his beloved's fragility. It does not matter; love, he has come to reason, is not a series of weights and measures, not when it goes both ways- it is not a balancing act, it is what the other needs when they need it, what each cannot help but to give, in the end it always evens out, no matter what.

“Yep. I will absolutely be doing that any time soon. Chatting to your father about art. Yup. Mmm hmm. Completely.”
“We change. We make a place for ourselves in this new system and we stop bleating about what we lost. So many lost so much more and I don't see them wallowing in self pity like -” she stops herself from saying
Harry shakes his head, because he doesn't need to be sorry and he doesn't need to tell him that.

And he kisses him.
as though Harry has said something stupid. He closes his eyes and lets himself be kissed, cheek and jaw and neck, gentle but urgent hands on the buttons of his shirt and it's good, it feels so good he's terrified he'll cry, terrified the idiot will feel his heart fluttering like a trapped insect in his chest. Every button undone yields more skin to be kissed and he feels himself melting into the pleasure of it until Harry murmurs -
It is not like any any summer he has ever spent before school, Draco thinks, but at least for the first time in three years this is a good thing. All of a sudden it feels as though too much has happened too fast and now here they are, two weeks before the start of a new term, looking over book lists and arranging shopping trips. It all feels poised to trip him up with the suddenness and near shock of it. He realises for the first time what a stolen season this has been – what a break from
“Thinking? It's a lot isn't it? Being back?”
“Fuck off -” Draco hisses between clenched teeth, his body singing out the opposite of his words just like Harry's - “Fuck off – and die, Potter.”
She puts large question marks by that one. While she's fairly sure Ginny's presence would be helpful to Molly, she's not sure how it would affect Harry or if Ginny could keep from damaging the careful work she's been putting into the Harry/ Draco problem. It's strange enough to her and she knows it weirds Ron out, so how would Ginny feel? Either way, probably not helpful she decides.
And it's not like Draco expected it not to hurt, but he had never imagined it could feel so simultaneously
“Er – no – and I wasn't – I mean I was – I was just out walking – and -”
“Please –“ Harry whispers, terrified - “Draco please, don't make me, but I'll beg you to be mine if I have to. We can talk can't we? We can talk about everything?”
“Obviously for the run up to and for headlining the as yet un-named celebratory week Potter, same as you.”
is next, a two second dip in the lights apparently being enough for Draco to disappear and reappear with a complete change of costume – a silver variant on what he was wearing that morning. It's angry, but not as angry as
“Snowball?”
“I want -” his head is reeling, as though Draco's tiredness, the weary defeat that seeps out of him has sunk into his own bones and he shares it now. There is so much that he wants. He wants to take hold of Draco and hold on to him forever, wants to kiss away a thousand tears and however many more it takes. He wants to make every terrible thing that happened here not have happened, wants to cast a healing spell that will make them all better. Unable to look Draco in the eyes, he's been staring at his lips the whole time he's been thinking this. He wants -
“Well, thank you, I'll – and is it your belief that everyone noticed this – like you have?”
“I was – ugh – I was trying to help.”
“They're not Death Eaters,” he says immediately, feeling his cheeks grow hot - “Hermione I thought you covered -”
what?” Hermione sighs.
Once again he finds himself hating Malfoy with a fiery pleasure, hates him from the toes of those knee high silver glitterboots to the crystal jewels studded in a starburst pattern around the corner of his eye. He hates the way his nose turns up as he looks him over, like Harry was something he had stepped in, hates the knife-edge lines of him and the contrasting softness of the scarf playing around his neck as though the breeze itself was in love with him. He hates the way Malfoy towers over him, now more than ever in those six inch platforms, hates the sneering cut glass and crystal of him, silver and gold glitter in his hair and the breathtaking strength and fragility in his eyes – he

He's in a corner of the bathroom floor, knees pulled up to his chest, fingernails digging into his arm and just ever so slightly starting to drag, face screwed up, angry and sad.

They traipse through two more rooms of paintings, a long gallery that apparently was once – and is still very occasionally- used as an upper ballroom, another hallway full of sculpture and a music room that makes Harry have to fight hard not to say
There is a strangled sound from Lucius in the corner by the piano and a choked noise from Harry. Thankfully Ginny saves them all – except Draco - by rolling her eyes from her curled up spot on the sofa, head rested on Luna's shoulder.
“No I think she just -” Draco says out loud, “- worries about me,” at the same time as she says “- worries about you,” and they raise eyebrows at each other for a second and almost smile. Draco dumps the shoulder bag and sits down in the desk chair with a sigh -
“Anything I can reach to.”
Harry nods distantly and heads on up to the room that has become his. Except he doesn't. He takes a detour to the second floor and walks along the corridor just long enough to hear the sound of soft muffled crying from behind Draco's door.
“It's true and you should say it” Ron nods grimly - “You guys
“I think -” Hermione says carefully - “We should – for the minute at least – do as they say and leave them to it. Going back –

“The one with the - “ she makes a gesture - “Scars? Sexy scars?”
“Shut up, Malfoy.” Harry gets up, goes over to the little writing desk, smiling. The words are so familiar they cannot help but come out of him almost affectionately. The funny thing is, he does not know when or how, but at some point it seems to him like Draco's sarcasm stopped being a complete pain in his arse and is now quite gently funny. In fact
“Hilarious. Shut up Potter.” But he smiles benignly and lets it slide - “My mother first brought me here when I was five, as soon as I could fly on my own; she said the constellations were as good as a family tree; she said – don't laugh – that the stars were there so that we could never feel lonely.”

Potter takes a step forward, stops, squints like he's only just noticed -
He hasn't heard his name said like that in years. He'd had no idea how much he'd missed it – he'd had no idea that amount of condescension, verging on disgust even,
“Mrs Malfoy!” Hermione looks up from where she has been talking to the younger Mr Weasley on the sofa. She looks, Narcissa thinks, though she is not entirely sure –
“I mean – yes – but don't worry about it.”
“It is though isn't it?” - bitterly - “It always is. I have to be the adult. I've had to since I was twelve. Sometimes I just get so bloody

So he holds him, so he rocks him gently like a child, so he strokes his hair and lets Draco hold on too tightly and he feels himself almost cry himself because Draco has this effect on him, he always has – when he's sad, he is sad, when he's happy Harry smiles, if he's angry – well that one is perhaps more of a problem, since when he is angry Harry finds himself getting angry too, and they clash, they clash, they still clash a thousand times a day, waves breaking on the sand, each of them the water each of them the land.

He frowns, trying to remember that feeling of pride, of tenuous importance at being
Draco cannot control the jerk of his hips when he says it, the rub of their cocks so sweet, delicious and nowhere near enough, only rendering him weak enough to hear himself voice these silent prayers of so many years out loud.
“It's me,” his wife says. Time was, she never would have spoken two words so unnecessary, but she knows she has to now for reassurance. She lays out a small carpet bag on the bed and starts to magic things into it.
He needs to get up and leave this cupoard, but to go where? Firstly all the people in the room opposite will look at him and he can't talk to them about this. And he can't follow Malfoy because he's been told in no uncertain terms to fuck off and leave him alone and honestly hasn't he disrespected this enough already not to mention actively violated his personal space?
“You saved me.”
he didn't know any of it – about the tale of the three brothers, the Elder wand, the horcruxes, none of it – he takes a deep breath.
everything that has happened over the past two years just swamps him. He has to remember that he is allowed to even think again, that he does not need to hide any thoughts, that he does not have to lie to himself to prevent the Dark Lord overhearing some truth that will see him dead.
Draco says, vehemently, leaning back into the bed and pulling Harry down onto him - “Tell me. Tell me everything -” There is a brightness in his eyes, the brightness Harry saw there the first time he saw him on a broom, getting on and taking off with such exquisite elegance - he had thought that light had gone forever – he has never been happier to be proved wrong. There was a part of him that had fallen in love with Draco that day, though he had hardly understood it – an elation at another person's beauty that had lifted him into the air so effortlessly he should have known they were always meant to fly together – of course – of
“Just because you had some sort of falling out last night – yes you did, Hermione told me – doesn't mean he's not kind. You weren't there when I was staying at the Manor – I mean staying at the Manor makes it sound nice, but I was in a dungeon so it was ever so boring and a bit unpleasant – but he came to see me quite a lot and brought me extra food and books at least so I had something to do. He always looked so scared but he did it anyway. He got me blankets too. That's really incredibly brave, don't you think?”
“Which points may I ask?”
“I think -” Draco says slowly, looking sideways at Harry, still taking in the mark with incredulous eyes - “You're going to regret it.”
The adults. They just want us to be better so they can feel better about it. I'm sick of them.”
He leads the way. He has, Harry discovers, a half wing full of his own rooms; massive, high ceilinged squares that seem so large to him it would be like being outside to have grown up in these rooms.
“You love it -”
“Should you?” Harry raises an eyebrow as aggravatingly as he knows how – “Didn't know there was a rule book, Malfoy, you must have nicked it back in first year.”
“Ah fuck off Draco, you never

any more. He had no rights to anything. He wants to own Potter now more than ever – his hands move hard against him, slipping up under his shirt, palms aching to claim every inch of him, and Potter shifts under his touch to bring them closer, pulling Draco into his lap and looking up at him as his hand slides up his spine – looking up at him with stars in his eyes. So many starry-eyed glances thrown his way in the last two years and not a single one had ever touched him, ever made him feel anything beyond a faint satisfaction, but this – this was what he'd been waiting for,

she doesn't need to. Lucius feels himself open and close his mouth several times like a sodding goldfish before he decides against arguing. Narcissa, clearly witnessing him win this battle, nods in brief approval. She kisses him on the forehead and starts to leave. It's amazing, he thinks, how beautiful someone can look as they walk out a door, amazing how much he finds he could still fight to make her stay if it was forever. He takes hold of that fight and dares to ask it -
“Yeah, it's Draco Malfoy,” and waits for the shock to fall on him. Instead Ron just laughs -

and the sound makes Harry's head spin and he's beyond thinking, has to claim the body that arches beneath him, pushing back, offering himself up without being able to help it; he pushes in and it is so much more than just pleasure, though it's possible nothing has ever ever felt this good. He has to pause for a moment, buried deep inside, gritting his teeth to keep from coming in the instant. Bastard would never let him live it down if he did. He digs his fingers in at the juncture of hip and thigh, getting a spot which he remembers makes Draco scream – he tries not to, but it seeps from his anyway, a long stuttering cry – and he rocks gently into him at first, trying to get used to bliss, his breathing feeling

After all the noise he finds himself crying, silently, shaking and there's Draco, shaking beneath him and he moves carefully off him and to one side, but never letting go, clutching on to him as she weeps in a continued outpouring of release, enjoying the feel of crying, and Draco clings back, trembling, burying their faces in each other and tangling up their limbs into something nobody could hope to separate.

or something in that vein. In fact he hardly dares breathe, for fear it will stop Draco actually talking about this. As it is, Draco stops walking in the doorway between the corridor and the landing and Harry sees the shudder that ripples through him, down his back and making his shoulders twitch. He wants to touch, to run a hand down his spine, but he suspects it would not soothe like he would want it to; but god he wants to kiss the tension out of every line of Malfoy, wants -
“Would you say yes?”
“Girl – haha – yeah, exactly.”
the one with penchant for physical over magical punishment. Thank the stars he's lying on his back so Potter cannot see, though it hurts when he twitches -
I bloody well
Ginny? Why would she be mad he wanted to save somebody who saved him? Does she hate him? Does she especially hate the Malfoys? Did Draco do something he doesn't know about? Surely he always picked on Harry the most? And then Ron and Hermione. Maybe Hermione meant think about her fondly – well he does, like all the Weasleys – ah maybe that's it – he ought to be able to summon up something more for his girlfriend. Nope, it's gone again. There's only one face that swims into his mind when he tries to conjure her up, and it's pale and pointed and it's always been there, every time he started to think too much about anything. He darts away from thoughts of that face like he's a shoal of fish, all shivery and breaking up, coming back to this one thing like it's a nesting ground. Bad thought. He feels himself going red. He gets up, unable to account for the feelings of restless itchiness, and wanders the house. There's too much past here. Too many things that belonged to Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, like an In Memorium list. He lingers in the drawing room running his fingers over the gold strands of tapestry – Sirius and upwards to somebody he was told might be his own ancestor, feeling the ancient fabric, the threads without really seeing them. An hour later he hears voices in the kitchen and he looks to where his fingers have been lingering for some time, tracing them over golden threads as though through strands of golden hair, all this time lingering on one name –
and Potter
“Do you want the long list or the short one?”
“I don't

“Pans, get on the floor. Why are you even here?”
it. I think.”
He hears Luna's voice as though she's been trying to reach him for a long time. It's only on hearing it that he finds himself registering that the music has stopped, like the loss of it was too much to bear all at once and he's still just standing there staring at the ghost of sound, staring up at Draco on the stage with the cello in front of him, his coat fanned around him like a skirt, and he's frowning down at Harry with an expression Harry cannot read. In Harry's head, for a shockingly vivid moment that probably goes on for far too long, he puts the instrument down, drops down from the stage and turns his face to Harry, eyes glittering and lips a little parted and Harry kisses him right there with the music swirling red and gold in a fire rainbow around them.
“Everything,” George echoes dully. “Even me. Yeah.” He stares off into the mid space for a while, absently. It's easier like this, he finds, to absent himself. He wonders where he goes when his brain goes out like this. He wonders if Fred's there. Something tickles the back of his mind, he remembers – that was it – he was having a conversation – with Hermione Granger. Something about Harry and Draco Malfoy, yeah, that was it. Was she waiting on him for an answr? He wracks his brain, trying to remember what they had been saying. Had she even asked a question? Shit.
make you feel better. Honest. I better go and find Harry now.”
And then, all of a sudden there's a plan for the future – or the imminent future at any rate – he hadn't let himself think about it but now it's there – school and graduation and the lot of them branching off into their own couple groupings and homes. All of a sudden he sort of
Draco just nods, barely even nods; he looks as though he has just been pulled back from a cliff edge and had been picturing the fall so vividly it's still happening. When they step outside the court and see the crowd crashing up towards them like a storm-lashed sea, only Harry on the one side and Narcissa on the other hear Draco make a little strangled sound of terror in his throat. Terrified he might do something stupid like bolt, Harry grabs his hand too tightly for Draco to fight it and shouts -
“Yes. Yes I trust you, you stupid Slytherin.”
have been thinking of saying that - “Not with that hair. But you're smart and you have a really hot boyfriend now and it might -” she sticks her nose as high in the air as it will go and puts on her father's best and snootiest public speaking voice. “It might behove us to communicate more in the future concerning certain persons who may require our assistance.”
“Mmm hmm – that one. The one you're always staring at.”
“Yeah – you know – they invited a couple of wizard rock bands to play the same week we do our matches against the Harpies – looks like they arrived early to practice too.”
Pansy is saying - “She wanted to

really doesn't cut it? How are the others, by the way?”
Draco shrugs one shoulder and walks through coolly -
like difficult. Like on a test. Sometimes it's more satisfying for being a bit tricky. I'm difficult to like too,” she adds - “I expect. I never really thought about it. I think I'll go and see Harry now.”
Draco punches him. He doesn't really mean to and is faintly shocked at it happening – more shocked apparently than Harry is, who just staggers back clutching his nose and prising off his glasses which are now covered in spiderweb cracks across both lenses, Draco's fist getting him direct centre of the nose. He stares at his fist on pulling it back, as though surprised to have felt it do that, bewildered as to why it hurt
It occurs to him that this is going to keep happening. That however many times he kisses Draco's scars, tells him how beautiful he is, assures him that he loves him – even if he does it over and over again – there will be a part of Draco that will not – that
And Draco shakes and shivers like the air before a storm, and Harry fears for the thousandth time that the mischievous snatch of cold air from outside might steal him away, but he never lets it and sure enough eventually he gulps and hiccups his way to a simple sniffling, wiping his nose on Harry's pyjama sleeve and making a little
“The truth is, Miss Granger, I need your help. Can you tell me what made Mr Potter testify for us and then rescue us from the courtroom like he did? I consider myself an excellent judge of character – some ancient prejudices aside – but I simply cannot fathom his actions.”
“Staring at something, Potter?” she snarls and he looks down quickly. Maybe
“Well – I mean someone succesful, beautiful if you like that sort of thing – well hang it all I'm not going to just sit here and compliment you!” he sneers a little - “You know you're perfect.”
tried out?”
“Yes, alright damn you, yes,” and Harry smiles again and shakes his head because he knew already, should have known long ago just like he should have known what his own feelings were, but it's like he hasn't aged since he was eleven – not in terms of emotional maturity anyway– they had to get old so fast that parts of them that should have grown up never had a chance to. It doesn't matter now; it feels like he has been given a reprieve, a chance at life and it feels – touching Draco, talking to Draco, loving Draco in the days that follow – as though he feels the same. In the end when they emerge from the bedroom they hide nothing, not smiles, not tenderness, not
“Oh my -” Malfoy's hanger's on – Harry assumes they must be band members, producers and assorted team but Malfoy just makes everyone around him look like hangers on – have caught up to him by now, and are watching him and this exchange as though every word he utters is just poised to go down in history. “How we

nice? Hi, git-face.”
Draco rolls his eyes; he's already holding a little green glass bottle out between his fingers, and for a brief flash of a moment Harry thinks of snakes and gardens and apples. He takes the bottle, frowns at it -
He's panting, even though it wasn't effort, just because there's nothing between them now and Draco is staring at him with wide eyes that beg him to call every single shot – and he's not sure he could help himself there even without that permission – and he's
“But it
“Shut up. You didn't even stay around long enough to hear me say you were

“What you said -” Draco nods - “About doing it for the adults – seeming happy. It's like – I want to? For mother – but then I keep thinking – wasn't it the adults who fucked us up in the first place? I don't mean mother – or your mother – but the ones in charge, Dumbledore – Voldemort – they just – they
“What? You don't mean something -” he searches for a better word than the one that springs to mind – it's too difficult. There is nobody there to finish his sentences for him anymore, without which he finds himself barely able to talk coherantly half of the time. At least half.
“I do,” he says, making a mental note to surprise him with a piano in the cottage as soon as he can after they get home. He wants suddenly and terribly to tell Draco how beautiful he is, how much he wants him right now – a thought no sooner heard in his own head than it is burning his cheeks and he thinks several things at the exact same time in a jumble. He thinks about having him right there over the piano stool or on the cold marble floor of the music room, thinks about how little Draco can ever keep his voice down and how his cries would sound echoing off the vaulted ceiling thirty feet above their heads. He thinks how he is
he asks himself; it feels like many, but it's really just the same thing over and over and over –

He's not even in control of this, he thinks, even though he is the one moving Draco beneath his hands, turning him in his fingers like sand – like however much he digs his fingers in, his hands will never be full enough. But it's Draco who guides his every move, Draco who pushes himself into Harry's hands, his skin so so soft, his body so hard he hardly has the ability to notice that Draco is holding onto him in return. His body is so painfully aware of everything he wants that he hardly even realises that Draco is the one saying
“Hate you -” he mutters as he fucks him, because there is so much love in him right now he has to say it somehow - “Hate you I hate you, you disgust me -”

“They need help, don't they?” Hermione's lips pull in a smile.
Harry countering with the query as to if it was so tedious, why was he so often the one to initiate it. This time Draco starts it – he denies it later – but at the peak of it Harry gets up in his grill and he pushes him; Harry grabs his wrist, spitting out
sound like your idea of a nightmare, yeah. Hermione take a look at this for me, will you?”
over and over until Harry had actually got quite scared, like Draco was apologising for Burbage's death, for everything he had ever failed to do, every wrong choice either of them had ever made, for Voldemort, for the war itself and maybe he had felt responsible, maybe after all he had been -)

Towards the end the lighting appars to paint lines in silver and gold slashes across his chest and when the false start hisses back into a whisper Harry could swear Draco was staring right at him. The lights go down and he feels a terrible weird churning of guilt.

He's not sure for how long he has been, but Luna, when she notices, just nods as though she understands and he's glad it's her, not any of the others.

He doesn't believe in fate either, not any more; it was a wonderful thing to throw out, that belief and yet somehow it does seem inevitable that when he looks up at the towers of the school all around him his eyes are drawn to a tiny figure high up in the window to the Astronomy tower. He isn't recognisable from this distance of course; all the same Harry

straight up out of his chest -
“Gross, Potter – and what do I even get for it, eh?”
“Both if necessary, I presume,” she yells - “Good night Malfoy.”
He finds himself telling her how he cannot produce a Patronus any more, not when Fred was there in every happy memory he ever had. She glares at him for it, asks him if the memories are sad now, then? He starts to say of course, how could they not be, and she shrugs him down, doesn't make the past sad for what the present is. Would they have been crying then instead of laughing if they had known what the future was going to be? Happy memories aren't finite, she says, some of them haven't been made yet. When she says goodbye they agree to meet again soon.
“Technically we stopped – after the international statute of wizarding secrecy in 1692 – we weren't supposed to any more – until then it was easy, and we rescued a lot from this mad wizard who was posing as a muggle priest in the fifteenth century, he cast a glamour burning all these artworks but most of them he sold off to pureblood families -”
looks like – if it's the reason his father won't look at him.
“Fleur? Can I call you Fleur?” he has a crafty grin in the corners of his eyes and she nods. Draco's grin creeps all the way to his lips as he says -
“Am I fucking stuttering? Yes, yes the one with the name like stars. You also have name like stars, it is very – you are not – huh -” she pauses – there is something strange here. Whilst yes, the boy's eyes are on her and he is frowning, attention on her, yes – he is not even faintly captivated by her presence. It is as though her aura has not touched him.
a part of the re-decoration. If it had been anyone other than Draco, there would have been no way Harry could imagine anyone being a child in this room, which came with its own personal bathroom and and en-suite living room area, everything huge and opulent, stiff and rather formal. Cupboard under the stairs or not, he still found himself struck by a curious surge of sympathy, one he knew better than to express at that time, though he has tentatively broached it since.
“See Gin, this is why I wanted you to hush it. He's going to be insufferable now.”

Hermione nods, rolling her eyes and shaking her head, and then the doorbell rings and her parents are there and they can finally all smile for her as well.
“So you came into a cupboard?”
“I don't want to burst his bubble about it. I think – like – he's really into it – just like the rest of you and if I said I wasn't he might – deflate – it's horrible, I can't make him sad, not ever and that's the other thing isn't it? This – with Draco – it's all happened so fast too and now – now I have to think about that and what it all means -”
“Well -” she gives that one thought and then grins - “I did hear –
“It – didn't go down well, yeah.”
“Actually -” Hermione whispers as she lets her in and closes the door. “Ron charmingly abandoned me to mediate on a Black family reunion. It's utterly awkward and thank god you're here.”

“Try it.” (
“Umm is not a word Harry.”
Narcissa finds herself smiling. It feels like it has been a long time since she did that.
“Who says I'm thinking?”
“Right.” Harry's heart is already racing. “Of course – I'm -” he turns and heads quickly for the hall. In the kitchen doorway he almost runs straight into Lucius Malfoy and his feet feel electric with the need to run past, brain shrieking

“I -” Harry can just picture the tight little frown knitted between those silver shining eyes. He wants Draco here, beside him, wants to kiss it away. Shit. It's like that, then. He had not quite realised it was like that. Of course it was, though. Of course. It always had been, just underneath everything else.

On these nights he feels so close to waking the sleeper and giving up all pretence of bravery. He wants so much to crack and ask for help at last – help has been given because somehow his need had made itself apparent. He's not quite sure how, he was trying so hard. He wants to break and say

Roughly a year after the wedding, they find themselves in a carriage pulled by thestrals, gliding with eerie smoothness through a series of increasingly narrower country lanes. These are the lanes hidden in between the hedgerows, the byways of the countryside that even walkers do not see, and a cloaking spell masks the carriage from any passers by or from the cars on the main road cutting through the fields beyond the window. Their muted grind could belong to a different reality and sometimes Harry still has trouble reconciling the two worlds that feel like they should exist in different places, not alongside each other. He can hardly stop fidgeting, like the clueless kid he once was, on his way to Hogwarts for the first time, hands restless in his lap. He glances to Draco, looking for any reassuring signs of restlessness or nerves that might make him feel better about his own but there's nothing. Draco's hands are still in his lap, his face a careful blank.
“Yeah. You'll never guess who Harry Potter's -”
“I'm not. I don't want -” Draco heaves a sigh that moves his whole body - “Luna was right. But just because she was right doesn't mean I can be less scared. It's like a dream. Something I've wanted for far too long to possibly have. You say you want all of me? You don't know the worst – what if you -”
“No it wasn't that -” shit, Harry realises he has to explain this one now he's started. “Well – maybe a little bit that, I don't know – but your lighting effects – they were a different colour from the song – I – I see music in colours? Luna says it's called synesthesia?”

The truth is – and Draco has never been a huge fan of honesty, so any train of thought that starts this way is absolutely doubtless to end in grief – still, the truth is – he hadn't been expecting Potter. He cannot help but feel a little bit foolish – spending the last four years visualising what has always felt like an inevitable reunion, he never once imagiend that it would come

Then Potter's kissing him, and something unlocks just a little in his chest and he's kissing angrily back, teeth and tongue and snarl, lips curling under lips, both of them ready to tear into the other, and it's frankly the best thing he has felt all year. Somehow the hands that he puts up to push Potter away end up balling into fists in his shirt, pulling him closer, and it's like they're thirteen again grinding up against each other furiously, hard and wanting and magnetised to each other as ever.
