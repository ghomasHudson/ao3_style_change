“It is.” Potter indicates a chair and Draco takes it. “How did you know?” Potter sits down at the head of the table, diagonal to Draco.
“I did what I had to do,” Harry says, shrugging. “Meanwhile, I seem to recall you thinking the whole people getting petrified thing was pretty funny.” Harry’s tone is teasing but Draco flushes, ashamed of his past self.
“Fine,” Harry says. “I’ll go get dressed.” He squeezes Draco’s left butt cheek as he leaves and Draco glares after him. By the time that Draco gets out of the shower, Kreacher has laid out an outfit for him. He blinks in surprise and looks over at Harry.
“So, Potter,” Draco says as they cross the foyer of Harry’s house and make for the stairs. “Have you been good this year?” It is now nearing midnight. The four of them had spent another hour or so discussing their plan to go caroling around the Ministry and as the alcohol had continued to flow, the idea had morphed into something bizarre and extravagant. Poor Bertie was going to have to work overtime on their costumes. But Harry and Draco are home now, having left Pansy and McLaggen still plotting in the Sporting Page.
“Fine,” he said. “Have it your way.” His exasperation was evident in his tone and a flare of anger went through Harry again. He didn’t have to tell Draco everything that was on his mind, just because they were… whatever it was they were.
Harry’s stomach grumbled as food appeared on the platters in front of them. He had not realized quite how hungry he was, and he happily dug in, spooning lots of food onto his plate. He wasn’t sure if the Slytherins had also been drinking in their common room before the feast, so he glanced over to at them.
“What if he tells someone?” Draco’s voice was quiet, and this, more than anything else, stopped Harry’s laughter.
“Which is fine,” Ron continued. “I just wish you hadn’t slapped me. One, because it hurt and two because it was embarrassing.” Pansy scrunched up her face.
“Interesting.” Draco wanted to know what Dumbledore saw, but he didn’t dare ask. He hadn’t had the closest relationship with the headmaster — that had been Harry — and he felt awkward being here with just the two of them, particularly as Dumbledore had found him naked. But he wanted answers, so he squared his shoulders and faced the man.
“You took your clothes off?” Hannah Abbott asks, interrupting them with both her question and a steaming mug of coffee. Harry can smell the firewhisky from where he is sitting.
“You’re welcome.” He decides to take the bold move of sitting next to Malfoy on the sofa as opposed to going back to the chair he was in earlier. Or, rather, while Harry thinks it’s a bold move, Malfoy doesn’t bat an eyelid. But now that Harry is there, he realizes he is looking out at the room, and not at Malfoy. He shifts in his seat so that he is facing towards the blond and in doing so, he ends up bringing their knees together. And then once he has done that, he can’t take it away again or he’ll look like a twat. Merlin he wished he had tried harder during seduction class.
Later that evening, once Massi is passed out in a post coital daze, Harry pulls out his wand and performs a quick, silent
“I’m so sorry about that curse,” he says quietly into Draco’s hair. “I really didn’t mean to hurt you.” Draco shrugs.
But it didn't take him long to get over his surprise and instead get very into the kiss. Before either of them could think about the situation much, they were pressed together, hands roaming across torsos and tongues battling for real estate. Until, of course, Harry began to get too excited and instead ran cringing to the sofa, clutching his nether regions.
“Why not?” Anger flares in his chest. He’s perfectly capable of imitating Hermione in an undercover mission.
He had been surprised that the laptop worked in the Cooler, but Draco had explained that it was one of Ernie’s hybrid models. He idly wondered it Ernie would be able to modify some of the bugs to run on magic, thereby making them usable in the Ministry. But then they would have to disclose the technology to the Ministry and it would be useless for tracking the Simurgh Society.
The door swings open and Pansy is greeted by a vision in white. The figure seems to have its own light source and Pansy puts a hand up in front of her eyes in an attempt to block it. The light fades and Pansy recognizes Hannah, in spite of the waist-length blond hair and still faintly glowing white dress.
“We need someone who can take photos,” Harry said. “But before you say anything, I want to be clear on something.” Colin gulped and nodded. “All photos go through me. No one sees them without my approval. Is that clear?” Colin thought about it for all of two seconds before nodding vigorously. “Great. Then follow me.”
“But you’re a Gryffindor. You lot rush headlong into everything with no heed to the risks. That’s like, your
“We can always buy more if we need it,” Harry says with a shrug. “Plus, Draco, may I remind you that you’re a wizard. You can bring as much as you want with an undetectable extension charm.”
“Yes, well, we were talking about how I had asked him out as a dare, and, I don’t know - we had a lot of banter, and I thought why not ask him out again? It could be fun. The banter that potions lesson was kind of fun, perhaps it would be nice to not always be at each other’s throats.” (Or, said the Seamus voice in Harry’s head, to be at each others throats for the purpose of trailing kisses down them). “So we snuck out to the Three Broomsticks on Tuesday night and we had a really nice time.”
“You’re smart,” Pansy says. “Play and learn the rules as you go.” She nudges him with her elbow and he relents.
house.” Draco carries the shirt over to the closet and hangs it next to the ones he’s already placed there.
The inside of the building is a maze of corridors, but Harry is undeterred. He waves his wand around his head and then projects a tiny map onto the palm of his hand. Perfect. He figures out the part of the building where he thinks Hermione might be and starts to cautiously make his way over to it, scanning for defensive magic as he goes.
“I’ll put it on the board,” Pansy says. The board is now several boards, spanning the entire length of the room. In fact, Chester has his own entire section. Pansy walks over and writes Millie Davies’s name on a piece of paper and pins it on Chester’s board.
“So it seems like we’re going to need a Hand of Glory of our own then, if we’re going to get out of this unscathed.” Draco nods. “I don’t suppose you still have yours?”
“Right. I’ll be back.” He left and Harry settled himself at one of the tables against the wall. It didn’t take Draco long. By Harry’s estimate he was only gone fifteen minutes and in that time the old man at the bar finished one Firewhisky and ordered another.
“I’m not bloody surprised,” Blaise said. “Circe, Harry, I knew you were pretty powerful, but I had no idea just how much.” Harry worried his bottom lip and scratched the back of his head. These conversations always made him feel awkward, because it wasn’t like he had
“We thought,” Draco said. Everyone turned to look at him. “That we might use my orders to lure the Death Eaters, and the Dark Lord himself, to Hogwarts.”
“Fathers,” Draco says with a sigh. He sits down behind Massi and extends his legs out to either side of him. He wraps his arms around Massi’s waist and Massi leans back into him. Draco glances at Harry and he thinks he sees a flash of of a frown on Harry’s face, but then Harry gives him a quick thumbs up. “What did he say?” Draco says gently. Massi shakes his head.
“No rush.” He grins at her. His whole body is suffused with the warmth of the holiday and he feels utterly Hufflepuff-ish as he gazes fondly at Hannah. But that’s not really a bad thing. The Draco from school might have thought that it was, but this Draco knows better. She plonks three glasses on the bar in front of him before hurrying away again with the promise of seeing him later.
“Sit,” he said. “And tell me everything.” Harry rolled his eyes, but complied with the sitting part of Seamus’s command.
“Fine, fine,” Aberforth said. He waved two of them towards the Floo powder and the rest of them to a table in the back of the pub.
“I don’t want to hear any kind of explanation,” he said, even though he somewhat did want an explanation now. He picked up his beer and took a large sip. The bubbles tingled as they hit the back of his throat and he forced the liquid down quickly, eyes watering. He almost felt like he should have expected this, like this was an inevitability with dating a Slytherin, or at least with dating
“I don’t think Big Dick will be pleased about this,” he says and Luca’s face falls. Draco takes Jamie gently by the arm and leads him away from the group.
A moment later, Harry’s lips crash into Draco’s with a force that takes Draco’s breath away. He returns the kisses with the same vigor, pulling Harry firmly against his body. His hand ends up resting on Harry’s arse and he gives it a small squeeze.
“What’s that?” Granger asks. Draco opens his mouth to answer, but Ginny, who has clearly been listening to Draco rattle off the rules, explains it before he has a chance. He stares at her, his mouth still open, impressed.
The next day, all in all, the sixth years decided that the Shrieking Shack party had been a success. They’d laughed and drank and danced all their concerns away, even if just for a night. Their main complaint, however, had been how long it had taken to get back to the castle once the party wrapped up. So it seemed unlikely that further parties would be held there, though at least they’d given it a go.
Even Professor Snape had seemed willing to go easy on them, though Harry wasn’t sure if this was because he was giving them a treat, or because he’d been grievously injured during the battle and had needed the time to recuperate. He’d been found a few hours after Harry had entered the Great Hall, bleeding profusely from a neck wound he’d sustained from Fenrir Greyback, and had been rushed to St. Mungo’s after Madame Pomfrey had stabilized him. From what Harry had heard, he would be spending a grudging summer with Remus on the off chance he did turn into a werewolf come the full moon.
“This was the room, not my imagination,” she said. She joined Seamus at the bar and helped him unload his bag, raising her eyebrows appreciatively when she realized that it had an undetectable extension charm on it. “How many people were
“Of course,” Harry says. “But should you want to keep things here, that half is yours.” He turns and walks back into the bedroom. Draco takes a deep breath, aware that they have just skirted around admitting there might be something more to their fake relationship (again), and follows Harry back into the master bedroom.
“I’m already scheduled to come in,” Pansy says. She picks up her ring and slips it back on her finger. “Don’t want to let down Big Dick.” She doesn’t look at any of them, but instead stares detachedly at her fingers.
“I promise you, sir,” he began but Snape waved his hand to silence him and Harry snapped his mouth shut. Snape lowered himself into his chair, opposite Harry.
Before he could say anythings else, however, Professors Slughorn and Snape walked into the room. Professor Slughorn was smiling; Snape looked like he had just swallowed a lemon. Harry wondered if this was the face Snape made when he was worried.
started dating a Slytherin and offspring of a Death Eater, it wouldn’t be front-page news because he wasn’t Harry Potter.)
It read in Draco’s handwriting. Harry was pleased to realize that he knew what Draco’s handwriting looked like. It was cramped and narrow, but with long verticals and large, looping capitals - both elegant and spiky, just like Draco.
Now, Harry enjoyed food. Of course he did. But he had never had food this good. He didn’t even know food
“McLaggen,” he said as he drew close. Cormac looked up, surprised. Seamus crooked a finger at him, beckoning him away. “Come dance.” Hermione looked up at Seamus with grateful eyes. Cormac considered him for a moment before he slid out of the booth and stood up.
“I ascertained that Draco Malfoy did have The Reliquary and also that he had read it.” It is hard to tell with the tiny image, but Pansy swears she sees Dempsey’s posture slip for a second.
“Fine.” She glances up at the clock on the wall. “Why don’t you meet me at the Leaky Cauldron in half an hour.”
“Master Dobby has it,” came a voice from below Blaise’s elbow and he looked down to find a house elf gathering up the glasses for him. He shrugged at Hermione and shuffled out of the booth.
“You do?” Dempsey had looked surprised over the reading glasses that Pansy felt she wore more out of affectation than of need.
“I would think so,” Susan says, nodding. “And they’re still working together. The spells have been recently maintained.”
“Exactly how long have you thought he was a horcrux?” Draco shot back. If he’d had a wand, he would have been pointing it at Dumbledore, though given how angry he was, it was probably a good thing that he didn’t have one. He might have actually killed Dumbledore, the way that he’d been tasked to. Harry was still holding onto his hand, and he squeezed it now. Draco turned to look at him for a quick moment, but Harry’s face wasn’t reproachful. Instead he seemed almost grateful that Draco had taken the lead in angrily questioning their former headmaster.
Ron didn't know what Pansy meant by resting her hand there, or indeed if she had meant anything at all. He thought back to last night and his face burned at the memory of her slap. But had it been his imagination that right before that, she had kissed him back? Even just briefly? Of course, there was no way that he was going to ask her about it. He barely felt like he could get through a normal conversation with her, let alone one where they talked about feelings. Perhaps Hermione was right. Perhaps he did have the emotional range of a teaspoon.
Ron, Hermione, Pansy and Blaise were halfway through their Christmas lunch when Dobby appeared next to them, grinning from ear to ear.
“This is wonderful,” Dumbledore said once they had showed him the two horcruxes on Boxing Day morning. He clasped his hands in front of his face in delight, throwing his deadened hand into sharp relief. “Well done.”
Blaise and Hermione quickly ran into the issue of finding a house neutral place to play their board game. They had decided on Wizard’s Chess as it was a game that both of them knew how to play (even if it wasn’t Hermione’s favorite), but after Blaise had fetched his set from the Slytherin Common room, they had just stood awkwardly in front of the blank stretch of wall that concealed its entrance.
“Well, you had just insulted the first person my age that I had ever really befriended, so I wasn’t overly inclined to like you.” Draco snapped his mouth shut, but instead of sneering like Harry had half expected, he looked almost guilty. “But maybe.”
Pansy finds that taking her frustration out on the training room’s punching bag is a good way to unwind. And today is most definitely a day when she needs it. She replays the scene in her head over and over as she bounces on her toes in front of the bag. If she had just been a bit faster. If she had thought to disarm him. If. If. If.
“I thought I was already out,” Harry muttered. Draco gave him a pointed look and Harry walked into the room and shut the door behind him.
They spent the morning chatting idly and eating the scones that Dobby had brought them. None of them quite wanted to think about what they were going to attempt on Wednesday, because even though it would just be Draco and Harry carrying out the plan, the others were sure to be worried about them for the entire time they would be gone. And so they played lazy games of gobstones and exploding snap and pretended like it was a normal Christmas break.
“You know, I could help you put the ointment on, if you needed me to,” Draco suggested as they began walking. He immediately regretted being so forward but the comment was out there. Harry winced and shook his head.
“Shouldn’t Malfoy?” Neville interjected. “He was the one that said, well, whatever it was he said to upset Harry.” Harry frowned.
“I know.” She is frowning for reasons that Draco doesn’t understand. He wonders for the first time if Pansy has seen Greg since the war, and if not, what her feelings currently are towards him. He decides to head this off.
polyjuice potion can be used to swap sexes, it’s going to be easier for me to imitate her than it will be for any of the three of you.” Harry opens his mouth to speak but Pansy cuts him off with a glare. “It’s going to be me. End of discussion.”
“You’re no fun.” Draco shrugs again and walks off only to be accosted by Joe and Luca who are dressed as jungle explorers.
Draco lifts an eyebrow at him. They never stay at Harry’s house. Harry himself rarely goes there. He makes excuses like ‘but this is closer to both our workplaces’ and ‘but most of my things are here now’, but Draco suspects it is because the house reminds him of Oliver, even if Wood’s tenure there had been brief. Draco can’t blame him. It had been months before he hadn’t felt lonely in his own bedroom.
“Incarcerous,” Blaise said, tying the Death Eaters, Bellatrix included, together. Then he looked around. He wasn’t quite sure what to do now that they’d captured them. He felt a tug at the wand Hermione had handed him and realized that one of the Death Eaters was attempting to wandlessly summon it back. He tightened his grip on it and scowled at them before shooting another set of ropes at them.
“You would have too, if you’d seen the way they interacted in training. They practically finished each other’s-”
“Yes, I heard you,” Harry says. He blows out a breath. “I just. Shit. I don’t know what to make of that.” He makes his way over to the couch and flops down on it. Draco sits next to him and lays his head on Harry’s shoulder. It is now three thirty in the morning and Draco has work in a few hours. He wonders if he can call in sick or if Big Dick will think he just has a hangover.
It is now the next day. McLaggen had gone home around one in the morning and Pansy had fallen asleep on the sofa in the corner about half an hour later. She had woken, dazed and confused as to where she was until she had seen the half complete board. She’d apparated straight home, showered and changed, and had been in Dempsey’s office by the time the General had gotten into work.
Pansy’s eyes widen in shock. Her first impulse is to slap him again. Her second impulse is to tear all his clothes off and have him bend her over the table. Her third impulse is to slap herself.
“Let’s go with Potter’s suggestion,” he says. Pansy purses her lips but nods. Potter presses the down call button on the elevator.
“Well if McLaggen has told you about it, there’s not much I need to say, is there?” Pansy puts her hands on her hips and frowns at Draco. “Ok, fine. Harry and I were found standing over a dead body.”
“That bastard,” Draco says. He slumps back against the display case that holds the Voldemort Hand of Glory, letting go of Massi as he does. “That fucking asshole. I can’t believe he lied to me.”
“For fucking killing both of us.” Dumbledore by this point had taken several steps backward and seemed content to let them talk it through, just the two of them.
“I’m just paying you back for the Chamber of Secrets.” Harry shrugged. He was rather sure the effect of his shrug was lessened by the fact that he was difficult to see but that was alright.
“Look,” Harry said. “We’ll tell you all about it once Draco’s ready.” He looked around the room. “Where is it by the way?”
He allows Potter to lead him into the sitting room, which is bigger than Draco would have thought it would be from the outside, but somehow it doesn’t feel like it has been magically extended. There is a large red sofa against one wall and Draco sits down on this. It is more plush than it looks and he sinks down into the cushions. Potter walks over to the window and lowers the blinds before opening the lid to what Draco had assumed was a side table, but appears instead to be a hidden bar.
“Why not? It’s a party.” She leaves him and walks back to the bar. The previously grumpy house elf is animatedly bowing to Draco. Pansy sidles up to Draco and nudges him.
“If that’s fine with you,” he said. His palms were sweating now, and he surreptitiously wiped them on his trousers. He had no idea where this nervousness had come from. He had never felt anything like this before. ‘But this matters,’ he told himself. ‘For what is probably the first time.’
“Right,” Harry said once they were all assembled. “Let’s go to Hogsmeade.” Blaise, Draco and Ron cheered, and Pansy allowed herself a small smile. Perhaps this would be fun after all.
“Veritaserum?” Harry asks. “Are you saying alcohol alone won’t do?” Massi gives him a withering look.
“No,” she says. He nods once and then moves to give her space again. Harry walks over to the table and deposits two beers before hurrying back to the bar to collect the other two. Once they are all settled, Draco picks up his pint and holds it out.
“Do you,” Blaise started to ask, snapping Hermione back to the moment. He faltered there, then took a deep breath. “Do you want to go sit outside?” When she didn’t respond, he continued to blather on. “There are chairs and fire pits. I mean, it should be warm enough. But then again, we don’t have to-”
Massi sits down on the chair next to Draco and scoots it close to him. He flicks his eyes to the women who are hovering nearby and they sit down opposite them, their faces blank. Draco suppresses a shudder.
They reach the elevator bank and Pansy pushes the button for up and then immediately starts to tap her foot impatiently.
The song abruptly stopped and a slower one came on, in the way that songs always seem to do in romantic movies when the two characters that you want to get together finally start dancing. Ron looked around for the source of the music, but could not fine one. Perhaps it was the room itself that had changed the music.
“Does he really think anyone at St. Mungo’s is going to be part of it?” Draco asks. McLaggen shrugs.
Ron cheered and charged through, followed closely by Pansy. Hermione rolled her eyes but she was smiling. Draco and Harry hung back a moment, Harry to observe his friends, Draco to scoop up some snow to make a snowball which he then threw at the back of Ron’s head. When Ron turned around in indignation, Draco looked surprised and pointed at Harry.
“And for him?” Hannah jerks her head towards the VIP room. Pansy nods and Hannah mixes up another gin and tonic as well.
“Well, then I’m sure you will be pleased to hear that there are still times that we have to brew potions at the Ministry. You can show me up to all my superiors.” Draco pumps his fist in excitement.
“Mr. Potter,” a tall witch with flaming orange hair greets Harry warmly, sweeping him into an embrace as soon as they enter the Witch Weekly offices. She lets go of his shoulders and turns to Draco.
It took Harry another twenty minutes to finish trying on clothes and to decide what he wanted. In that time, Draco added a hat, a scarf and a very nice looking peacoat to the pile of items that he was buying. He would show them to Harry later, once he could no longer demand to pay for them.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand and nodded once at him. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the others exchanging glances. Now the real planning could begin.
“Quite,” she said. Then she clapped her hands together. “Well, now is the time when they will be of use. Right then. Hop to it. Younger students, please report to the girls’ bathroom on the second floor. Fifth and sixth year prefects will supervise your entry into the Chamber of Secrets, along with Professor Binns and the rest of the Hogwarts ghosts. Those of you who are of age, please follow the instructions that were given to you by your head of house. ”
He feels the moment that Massi comes, both on his hand and around him and he lets himself come as well. He cries out, only stopping himself from saying Harry’s name at the last moment.
“No, they said they hadn’t heard anything and I’m inclined to believe them.” Harry nods. He’s not sure he’s convinced, but Hermione knows Sylvia Swinn better than he does, so he lets it go.
There are no visible doors to any other part of the building inside of the laundromat. He curses himself for not having looked harder through the windows before following the old woman inside. But now he is stuck until she leaves, or until someone else comes in.
“No,” Pansy and McLaggen say in unison. They put their heads together and start planning the details. Draco turns to Harry with a resigned expression on his face.
“Come on then.” He pulled the door open and they darted inside. As soon as the door clicked behind them, Draco was on Harry. He pinned him against the closed door and kissed him with all of the pent up desperation of the evening. Harry kissed him back with equal fervor. They stayed this way for a long moment before Harry pulled away. Draco looked at him in confusion. Harry pulled out his wand and locked the door.
Harry looked at his watch. It was now nine in the evening and he and Draco had been each other for over eight hours. Draco had, of course, taken the first opportunity he could to kiss Harry-Draco and Harry had just closed his eyes and pretended that it wasn’t his face that had been moving in to kiss him. With his eyes closed, Harry decided it wasn’t so bad.
“What the hell was that?” Harry asks, suddenly alert. There’s another scream and he determines that it’s coming from the wall that Harry shares with the house to the left of him. Draco looks at him, eyes wide, and scrambles off of him. Harry says a quick, wordless, wandless spell and they are instantly clean. Draco’s skin prickles with the after feeling of the
“Again,” Hermione said. She moved the copied shirt to the growing pile at the end of the table, all of which were going to a very excited Ron when it was all done. “You’re so close, Draco.”
“And you’re wearing last year’s costume too.” It is true. Greg is wearing his vampire costume, with his hair slicked back and an emphasized widows peak.
“It might not, but it might make your working relationship better,” Pansy says. “Hell, it might actually be beneficial for all of us to see what was going through his head during those moments.”
He doesn’t like to think back to the summer in between fifth and sixth years but Pansy has brought up the issue now and so his mind goes back to that miserable time. Most of what he remembers is the fear. It was so palpable, Draco could taste it. All summer, everything tasted metallic. Even his birthday cake. Perhaps, his birthday cake in particular.
“You know there are rooms upstairs too,” Harry said to Draco later that night. He was perhaps three drinks in by now.
“Do you really think Draco would ask those two if he could be alone with Potter?” Pansy still found the idea of the two of them together strange. She knew that if she had not actually walked in on them snogging in that chair, she might not have believed it at all. But Potter had seemed almost unable to keep his hands off of Draco. Objectively, Pansy understood this. Draco was attractive and she was certain had she been in Potter’s position, she would have done the same thing.
“We don’t really use the Floo,” Draco snaps, more irritated by Potter’s teasing than he should be. Perhaps because it reminds him that this was just one night (and a shower) and that it won’t happen again. “But I’ve let you in the wards, so we can probably apparate. If you give me some paper, I’ll write down the coordinates.”
“Details,” he says, but he leans over and kisses her cheek conciliatorily. Without thinking about it, Draco reaches over and takes Harry’s hand. Harry squeezes his fingers and warmth spreads through Draco’s chest.
So they continue to enjoy themselves. They ski until their thighs feel like jelly; they make fleeting friends with fellow vacationers; they drink until everything is funny.
The owl arrived in the Gryffindor Common Room shortly after Harry, Ron and Hermione had returned from breakfast on Saturday morning. It fluttered around Harry until he reached out and took the letter it was holding, and then swooped out of the window that Ron had opened in order to let it inside. Harry opened the parchment and read it. It was from Draco, or rather it was from Blond Unicorn, Stinger and Esmerelda, and it requested the presence of Spaniel, Conan and Belle in the Room of Requirement in order to work on the horcrux conundrum that afternoon.
“True,” Harry said. “He does at the very least teach us practical things, which I would bloody well hope that he would as these are our N.E.W.Ts.”
“Of course,” Blaise said, clapping a hand to his forehead. “Your project. I didn’t even think. I’m sorry. Of course you shouldn’t go home. Harry’s right. It
“They might not know who,” McLaggen says after a moment. “Were you there when they got the assignment?” Pansy shakes her head.
“Should we perhaps go to Gringotts separately?” Harry asked in a low voice. “In case I get recognized?”
you would like to heal properly, I have opted not to ‘wave my wand and fix it’ so to speak, but instead to let the skin repair itself more naturally. If I were you, I would try to refrain from, ah, overstimulating yourself for the next week, if you get my meaning. The skin will be very tender and it is likely that any contact, stretching or pulling on it will be uncomfortable. Do you understand?”
leave and hope anyone watching the area thought that the wind had blown the door open, but as it is a very still, clear day he doesn’t think that seems plausible. He is about to sit down and wait when he remembers McLaggen. McLaggen bringing laundry to a laundromat is not something that would arouse suspicion to someone watching. And that would mean McLaggen could be around if something goes wrong even while Harry will has the opportunity to stay hidden.
“Fuck.” Harry leaned back and ran a hand through his hair. “How do I know if I can trust you? That you’re not plotting to kill me?” At this Draco lifted his eyes up to meet Harry’s again. He looked incredulous.
“What the fuck are you two doing here?” Massi asks when he sees them. He is wary, for obvious reasons, but Harry has greets him like an old friend.
The statue was indeed wearing a circlet on her head. Harry pulled a chair over and stood on it so that he could get a better look. It was delicate with interwoven bands that culminated in a circular pendant at the front. Though the statue was white marble, Harry theorized that the stone at the front might be a sapphire, given the Ravenclaw colors of blue and bronze. As he peered closer he saw that there were tiny words etched into the side:
“Of course.” He nods once. “Before we go, I want to go through the rest of this.” He gestures to the papers spread across the table. Pansy puts the map to the side and pulls over another paper and discovers it is a full file. She flips through the pages and her eyes flick across the words there. It is the report from the night Harry and Draco were taken in for questioning. Unbidden, the words from Draco’s interview jump out at her.
“I’m very used to doing dishes,” is all he says as he sits back down. Draco frowns at him, but he does not elaborate.
“You could say that,” Malfoy says. “Yes.” He takes Harry’s hand and leads him further into the room. “Greg, I’m sure you remember Potter.”
“Yup,” he said. “You're my bitch.” Draco lifted an eyebrow at him and Harry hurried added that he was joking.
“I know your family is mafia, Massi.” Draco says. “That’s generally what the mafia do to enemies of the family.”
He stalked back into the bedroom, muttering to himself. Once there, he glanced around the room for something that he could transfigure into a bald cat and in the end settled on transfiguring his alarm clock. Shortly, an angry looking feline sat on his bedside table. He cast an immobilizing charm on it before it could run away and then picked it up. It glared at him. He glared back. His costume was complete. And perfect. If perhaps the least sexy thing he had ever seen.
“You mean you don’t want people to come into the common room in the morning and find us like this?” Harry asked. He sat up, disentangling his arms from Draco’s.
Draco is nervous as they cross the threshold, and he reaches out and brushes his hand against Harry’s. The contact puts him more at ease. He is with Harry. Harry won’t let anything bad happen to him.
“Zabini,” Harry said, nodding at Blaise. Blaise seemed to snap back to attention at the sound of his name and he managed to flash Harry a small smile. Harry, oblivious to this, began to pile food onto his plate.
After a minute’s fretting, Harry tells himself to stop worrying. He’s not usually so concerned during missions, but it’s Hermione. He can’t not be worried.
“For these first exercises, I would like you to resist the veritaserum if you can.” Draco nods. His mouth is dry. “And don’t worry if you don’t get it on your first try, or even on your second or third. It requires a lot of practice before most people are able to mislead or lie under its influence. For this, we will pretend that you have been captured by a rogue witch, who wants to know if you are a Ministry employee. You must try to keep your cover intact. Ready?”
Lunch is a much fancier Christmas lunch than Harry has ever had. They start with blinis covered in creme fraiche and caviar and accompanied by champagne. It’s a far cry from his usual Weasley Christmas, but Harry supposes he should have expected that.
“No,” Draco says. “Thank you for telling me.” He runs a hand through his hair, a frown on his face. He can feel Massi watching him. “Fuck,” he says, blowing out the word in a long breath. “Do you think?” He stops and looks at Massi. “Do you think he is dating me just to try to bring down my family?”
“Thank you Ms. Granger,” she says. “If we hear anything, we will be in touch.” She shuts the door and Harry and Hermione turn and walk down the front stairs. When they reach the pavement, Harry turns and looks back at the front door as if he expects it to open again. It does not.
“I said, I fucking knew nothing,” Potter growls. Draco can feel the tension literally building in the air, and it is only when the corner of Potter’s napkin starts smoldering, that he realizes it’s not tension, but rather Potter’s magical energy. Draco shivers. He had been unaware that Potter was quite so powerful. Pansy clearly notices, because Draco watches as her face cycles through several emotions: surprise, alarm, irritation and then resignation.
“Should we all get in pajamas then?” Draco asked, his voice dripping in sarcasm. Ron, clearly, ignored the sarcasm.
The door opened and Draco’s head appeared in the gap. Pansy glared at him, not bothering to hide the fact that all she had on was a bra and trousers. (At least the trousers had been an easy decision).
“In which case, will you help train me?” Draco asks. “I mean, like extra training? Since you appear to be the best.” Pansy puts a hand on his shoulder.
“I wanted to keep you in suspense,” he said, even though he had intended no such thing and had merely walked at a normal, if slightly fast, pace. He took a step towards Draco, and then leaned in and kissed him. Draco melted into the kiss for a moment before he pulled away.
“It would appear so,” Dumbledore said. The irritation was gone from his tone and he was looking thoughtfully at Harry. “Draco, tell me, how
“No,” Draco says, shaking his head. “It’s just what we call him.” He claps a hand over his mouth, almost unable to keep from laughing. He glances over at Pansy and Potter who are also trying hard to suppress their laughter. Even Dempsey has cracked a smile. Granger clears her throat.
“Are you ok?” he asked. Harry took a deep breath and nodded. The pain in his head was such that he could ignore it, so ignore it he would. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand and they continued walking. As they neared the set of double door at the end of the corridor, Harry felt Draco grip his hand harder and he knew that Draco was just as scared as he was. At least they had each other.
have to go and not say, actually Pansy?” Harry sighed. They had gone over this so many times, he couldn’t believe they were doing it again. He was surprised, then, when Hermione jumped in to defend his decision.
“Perhaps we can pick up where we left off then,” Pansy said. She sat up and her head moved above the graveyard mist. The room was all but empty. There were a few stragglers, and when she turned to look outside, she saw a few couples out there. But for the most part, they were alone.
McLaggen starts to say something, but she shushes him with a wave of her hand. She thinks she might be on to something. The distribution of the houses. It’s not random. It can’t be. The houses are so close together. And they’re so close to Diagon Alley… But they need to confirm with the real estate agents whether or not they’re holding properties for a certain buyer.
“Maybe one day,” Draco said. Harry gave him a sad smile but nodded all the same. He put his head briefly on Draco’s shoulder. Draco turned to him. “Tell you what,” he said. “Do you want to feel like we’re a normal couple?”
“Good morning to you too, darling,” Draco says. He straightens a book on the display he is putting together and then stands back to look at it.
“What even brought this on?” She continues to deflect the question with another question, but Harry is ready for her.
He wishes he had something more comfortable to change into, but Potter hasn’t stopped by yet with his promise of casual clothes, so he’s stuck in his suit. At least he knows he looks good.
“Nothing. Let’s go to the Room of Requirement.” Ron frowned at her for a moment but then nodded and followed her out into the corridor.
“It’s a good thing I love you,” Draco agreed. Harry smiled and kissed Draco one last time on the lips before letting him away from the wall. “You’d better not have gotten dirt in my hair.”
“I’ve had Occlumency training,” Draco says because it is easier to keep telling the truth if it can’t hurt him to tell it. Granger nods slowly.
“No?” Malfoy asks, pouting but still not removing his hand. “But what if there are other wizards about? Or, better yet, the Prophet?” Harry groans. “What? If your cover is that you’re Harry Potter, and my cover is that I’m your boyfriend, the Prophet is bloody going to have to find out at some point.” At this, Malfoy sits back and removes his hand. “Which,” he says more quietly. “Means my parents will find out.” And then even more quietly. “Fuck.”
It really is an unfortunate predicament. For as much as he tries - and dear Merlin he tries - his left leg will not push him right. He’s too right legged for his own good.
“She’s right,” Blaise said. “And I have an idea.” They all stared at Blaise but he did not say any more, only screwed up his face in concentration. Nothing happened for a long moment, and then there was a slight creaking noise, and then a
“Can you teach us how to do it?” Pansy asked. This launched a repeat of the discussion about Dumbledore’s Army and the Inquisitorial squad (“I only joined because the headmistress at the time had set it up and she’s a ministry higher up. I was thinking of my future,” Pansy had protested.) that culminated in them deciding to start a new after school training group with just the six of them. They had levitated the three couches closer together in the middle of the room and were now facing each other across a round coffee table.
“Maybe.” Draco gives in. He hops down from his bunk. Harry is indeed taking his clothes off, but he has only managed to get his jacket and scarf off thus far.
Harry had no idea where they were going but Draco clearly did. Harry followed as Draco cut a quick path through the ambling tourists and window shoppers. Once they were in the store, he stood and watched as Draco decisively pulled various things off of racks. Occasionally, Draco would hold something up next to Harry and either nod and add it to the ever growing pile, or shake his head and return it to wherever he’d found it.
“No need to be such a dick about it,” McLaggen snaps. There’s a flush creeping up his face from underneath his scarf.
“And no one has followed one of them?” Pansy asks, incredulous. It is the first thing she would have done.
Draco sighed and put his glass down decisively on the table. “Look,” he said. “If it makes you feel any better, honestly, when I agreed to go out with you, I didn’t think I would like you so much.”
“Draco,” Harry calls after him, but Draco ignores him, so Harry follows him. Narcissa and Lucius look up in surprise as they cross the threshold.
“No need,” she says. “Croaker has personally approved your acceptance into the program. Secretly, of course, as you will then progress to Unspeakable training, and, well, we don’t necessarily want people to know about your being part of the Department.”
“Regulus Black was Sirius Black’s brother,” Dumbledore said. Harry found himself gripping the edge of his desk and forced his fingers to relax. “He was a Death Eater, but no one knows what happened to him, and it is presumed that Voldemort killed him.”
“Again,” Harry says. “It’s just a theory. That’s why I wanted to ask you how things were with you two.” But Ron’s not listening to him. He’s staring at a spot over Harry’s left shoulder with a frown on his face and his mouth hanging slightly open. Harry waits for him to speak and as he does, glances around the stockroom. It truly is a mess - the absolute opposite of the Flourish and Blott’s stockroom. He wonders if he should suggest Draco come help them organize.
I'm so sorry this is so terribly late. My beta reader has been so busy that I gave up waiting in the end. So if there are huge glaring errors, you can blame me.
“Welcome,” she said. “To Christmas lunch. As is Malfoy custom, we will have a full tasting menu, complete with wine pairings. Wilfie here will explain each dish as it comes out. I do hope there are no dietary restrictions.” She said this last part in a way that made it clear that any dietary restrictions would
“Draco,” she says as she reaches them. She reaches out and takes Malfoy’s hands in hers. “Oh, Draco, honey, are you okay?” Malfoy is still staring at the front page of the Prophet. Hannah looks behind her, over at the man who is holding the newspaper. She gently leads Malfoy to a table and makes him sit down.
“Do you have any other options?” Potter asks, which makes it sound like Potter does mind. Draco scrunches up his face.
A cursory glance of the room tells Draco the room is a pretty standard, pureblood dining room. From the room long table to the china cabinet, he could be looking at his parents’ old dining room. In fact, and here he does a double take, the china pattern might even be the same.
His breath is in his throat and a wave of terror washes through him when he can’t feel anything. Then he realizes his fingers are in the wrong place and he shifts them. He finds it - Massi’s pulse. It is as slow and steady as if he were just sleeping. Draco breathes a sigh of relief and then frowns at himself.
“Whatever you say, Goyle,” she says and he stiffens. Pansy is surprised to realize that this is the first thing he’s really been upset about during their whole conversation.
Before Draco knows it, it’s six pm on Christmas Eve, and he’s turning his key to lock up the shop for the holidays. As the lock clicks into place, a cheer goes up behind him. He grins as he turns back to his colleagues.
“Come in.” So Draco does. As he crosses over the threshold, he feels the change from the crisp March air to the damp interior of the house like a slap across on his face. Potter closes the door behind him and Draco looks around. They’re in the Entrance Hall mentioned in Herb— no, Draco supposes it must be
Draco almost falls asleep in the back of the cab, leaning on Harry’s shoulder, but they reach the Leaky Cauldron before he fully drifts off. And instead they stumble into the pub, Harry supporting Draco who is still drowsing and insisting he can walk and sleep at the same time.
“I suppose we are,” Draco said. He glanced nervously at Blaise. “I mean, why would we want to spend more time with each other than we absolutely had to?” The frown appeared back on Blaise’s face and Draco busied himself with a bowl of soup.
“Uh, no,” McLaggen says, looking suddenly uncomfortable. Pansy resists rolling her eyes and instead stares at him. “I was, er, unconscious. I’d been dueling and someone hit me with a Stunner.”
Of course, Draco had made the dinner slightly awkward by clumsily hitting on Seamus after too many glasses of wine, but Seamus had been gracious about it. He stops by the bookstore from time to time, but Draco hasn’t seen him since he started fake dating Harry. (Or is it real dating now?)
“He’s my boyfriend,” Pansy says. She relishes watching the emotions, first surprise and then disappointment, that flit across Cormac’s face.
music and kicking his legs to the beat, so Harry did his best to imitate him. Sure enough, after finding the beat of the song, he did begin to enjoy himself. He looked back at Draco and smiled. He was amused to see the blond scowl back at him. So he shimmied his hips a bit more, still attempting to keep eye contact, until Draco gave him a small, begrudging smile.
“What's that supposed to mean?” Draco snapped. He put his knife down, snowdrops momentarily forgotten.
“But Har’,” Ernie says, leaning across the table that they are now sitting at to put a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “She has nothing to go home for? I’m
“Do you mean to say we can get drunk in a hot tub like we did in Zermatt?” Draco asks. Massi smiles and nods.
“It’s not just that,” Harry says with a sigh. “It’s a lot of little things too.” He twists his mouth in irritation. “Like this afternoon, when we went to see the Swinns.” Pansy leans forward to listen. “Everything was fine inside - nothing out of the ordinary. Standard dealing with the family situation. But when we got confirmation from you, Pansy, that Winola really
Ron placed the diadem on one of the desks and the four of them crowded around it, each clutching a fang. Sure enough, once they stepped up to the desk, the circlet began to glow. The sapphire on the front burned red and Voldemort’s cold, high voice again filled the room.
“Your move,” Hermione said. Blaise turned his attention back to the game. He took in the pieces and sighed as he noticed that Hermione had put her bishop in a place where she could either take his king, or his knight. He moved the king and winced as she delightedly took his knight. The little man limped off the board, leading his horse dejectedly by the nose.
“Shall we?” he asks, gesturing to the stairs. Draco nudges Greg with his feet and the other man pulls himself into a standing position, grunting and groaning as he returns to vertical.
“This feels weird,” Harry said. He was standing in the Room of Requirement, transformed into Pansy by polyjuice potion. “I hadn’t thought about how different it was going to feel being a different gender.” Hermione and the real Pansy frowned at him. “I’m not quite sure how to move properly. My center of gravity is different.” He took several steps forward, convinced he was going to fall forward or look silly, but he found he soon started to get used to it.
The house is quiet when they arrive. Greg is either asleep or out, and Draco can’t tell which. It feels decidedly odd arriving on the landing with Potter. He had done it so many times with Oliver, that for half a second, his body expected to see his sandy blond hair when Draco turned his head towards the person beside him.
It took Pansy and Hermione working in tandem, but they managed it. There was one tense moment where Blaise’s foot brushed one of the stairs, but he pulled it up quickly and spent the rest of the time levitating in the smallest ball he could make himself.
Pansy leans back in her chair as McLaggen fills Hermione in on everything he has told Pansy. Having McLaggen explain everything is half the reason that Pansy wanted to bring Granger back here. That, and she really didn’t want anyone to overhear. She is pretty confident that no one would be eavesdropping on Granger’s office, but if it is a group inside the Ministry, Pansy is taking no chances.
“Yeah, it’s Malfoy. I kind of expected he’d had some Death Eater training. I mean, have you seen his dad? He’s like a walking recruitment poster for skirting the lines of what’s acceptable in terms of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Or, at least he was until he got locked up in Azkaban.”
“Uh, I will leave you two to it,” Greg says and start towards the stairs again. “Goodnight.” Harry raises a hand and then continues to glare at Draco once Greg has gone. Draco ignores him and starts up the next set of stairs, leaving Harry to follow.
Massi had not been supposed to leave the theater that night, and it had ruined all of the plans that the family had. They’d been informed by a friend that Harry Potter works for the British Ministry and they had been planning to, shall we say incapacitate him. But the heads of the family had conferred and now they think it’s best if they take care of Harry at the important dinner with the Luczkowski family on Wednesday. There will be so many bodies, he might get lost in the shuffle. So Massi needs to keep Potter and his blond harlot close. The family doesn’t care how he does it, but they’re Massi’s responsibility now. Oh, and sometime before the dinner on Wednesday, Massi needs to pick up their newly acquired Hand of Glory.
rice,” Malfoy agrees. They decide to split some hot and sour soup as well and are very ready to order by the time the waiter comes to their table. Harry throws in another bottle of wine, almost as an afterthought. It can’t hurt. He has promised both wining
“But when was the last time they were here? It’s probably been years. Memories fade. The castle is vast and confusing.” Harry had thought about it a lot since the idea had first been brought up. “I sometimes get lost for the first few days of a new school year.” Snape scowled and opened his mouth to say something, but Dumbledore spoke before he could.
to spend more time with Potter, it’s just that he has tasted the forbidden fruit now, and it’s going to be damn difficult to keep his hands off of him. Because what Potter had said last night was true. If they’re working together, nothing
“Are you okay?” he asks quietly. Draco nods. He is now. He stares into Harry’s eyes as his breathing slows to a normal rate again. Harry leans forward and kisses him gently on his temple and then rests their foreheads together for a moment. Draco breathes in Harry’s bergamot and citrus scent. He pulls back and knocks the rest of his drink back and gestures towards the bar. Harry nods.
“It is, though we were a bit late to the party today. We’re going to have to go in a minute.” Draco pointed to the clock on the wall, which showed they had roughly fifteen minutes until dinner.
“It might be funny for you,” Harry whispered, leaning forward to pull his trousers carefully back up. He felt like a sticky mess, but there was nothing to be done about it until they reached the Hogwarts grounds again. “But that’s the kind of thing that would
“Not bloody likely,” Pansy muttered back. “He wasn’t even wearing them. My bet is they’ve been in his pockets the entire time.”
“Shall we continue with the tour then?” He stands and pulls Draco to his feet. “Where were we? Oh, yes, the kitchen.”
Harry had never taken a Floo with someone else before. He clutched Draco close as they spun past fireplace after fireplace. He was surprised they could both fit, though he also was decently sure that his elbows were getting knocked about more than the usual Floo ride.
“The whole gang, back together,” Greg says. He beams at Draco who gives him a small smile. No one mentions Crabbe. Of course they don’t.
“You know how we have a complicated past that involves us mostly hating each other until a few months ago?” he asked.
Hannah and Ernie’s party, predictably, is amazing. They have transformed their entire house for the event, save for the bedrooms which are “colloportused shut to prevent shenanigans” according to Ernie. Every room has a different theme and Harry, Greg and Draco have a lot of fun going through all of them with Hannah before the rest of the guests arrive. Harry laughs briefly when they enter the upstairs corridor, which is entirely coated in fake cobwebs with realistic spiders crawling over it.
Draco feels bile rise in the back of his throat. He claps a hand to his mouth, willing himself not to be sick. He looks anywhere but at the bodies and notices the broken window. Wind is blowing through it, fluttering the curtains. He wonders if this was the shattering glass they had heard.
“Nothing,” Potter says quickly. “But, you do know that you can just take a plate off there and just eat it, right?”
“I— what?” Dumbledore heaved a great sigh. He walked over to one of the benches in the office and sat down on it. Draco hesitated for a moment before sitting down on the other end of the bench.
“Do you need me to?” Draco started to ask, but Harry had already instructed the door to open. He turned and watched the others as the doors slid aside, delighting in the looks of awe on their faces. Even Ron seemed amazed, which was fair as he had never made it to the chamber itself in their second year.
“Well, the Chamber is real,” Harry said. “I can show it to you if you want.” Now even Draco looked impressed.
Midway through work on Saturday, Draco realizes with a jolt that his “date” with Harry this evening is much more of a date than they usually go on. He was joking when he had said they were going to a place where they were unlikely to be spotted by the press, but it’s true. They’re going on a date in order to actually spend time with each other.
“Not being able to kiss you right now,” Harry said quietly. He was aware that there were other people around. It was precisely why he couldn’t be any more intimate with Draco other than sitting next to him. True, his knee was touching Draco’s thigh, and the contact was nice, but he wanted more than that.
“I’m starting to think Draco might be making friends with Potter,” Blaise said. Hermione straightened up with a start, suddenly acutely aware of the conversation.
It’s not that he thinks Draco can’t handle himself. He knows Draco is a perfectly competent wizard from their time at Hogwarts. But bad things can happen to the most competent of people. And doesn’t Harry know it.
“Er, yes,” he says. “That’s what it feels like when I see something. Like it sparks a memory. So for lack of any other word, I’ve been calling it sparking.”
The fact that Oliver is dead still surprises Draco from time to time. In his mind’s eye, he can see Oliver laughing; Oliver astride his broom; Oliver astride him… He tries not to let his mind go too far down the Oliver tunnel as it too often ends with Draco feeling abjectly miserable. At least he has the hazy images of Harry astride him to counteract the images of Oliver. Although, those images come with their own pang of sadness - though it is often sadness tempered with intense make out sessions. He’s not sure if that makes it better or worse.
“We’re friends,” he said and was then horrified as his eyes began to fill with tears of their own accord.
“Because you’re wrong,” Pansy says with a smirk. “And I would love to see it you proven wrong in person.” She walks forward and pokes him in the chest with her index finger before she can stop herself. She steps back quickly, irritated by her own actions. No wonder McLaggen thinks about sleeping with her; she seems to flirt with him at every opportunity she gets. Damn his stupid attractive face.
“Mr. Potter,” she says. She walks over to him and extends her hand. “How nice to see you.” Potter returns the handshake warmly, clasping his mother’s hand in both of his. Narcissa turns back to Draco.
“Sure,” Draco says. “Do you want to tell me why you’re asking?” Greg flushes crimson. It contrasts with his green jersey.
“You first, mum,” Draco says, indicating her pile of presents. Narcissa reaches out and picks up a box that is on the towards the top of the stack. She lifts it up to her ear and shakes it.
“Great,” Harry said. “How do we find the others?” He was sitting on the edge of his seat, excitement thrumming through him for the first time that day. Dumbledore chuckled sadly.
“Oh, uh.” She glanced down at the paper again. “Ignatius Proudfoot.” Harry released a breath he didn’t realize he had been holding. It wasn’t Tonks, or Kingsley, or Mad Eye.
Harry and Draco catch the 7:01 Eurostar to Paris, and then get on their sleeper train about an hour after they arrive in Paris. Draco thinks they have made pretty convincing Muggles on their journey. They have dragged their trunks rather than levitating them and they have taken trains as opposed to portkeys for the entire journey. (A small part of him is a little amazed that the Muggles have managed to build a train from London to Paris in the first place. Underwater! What a concept!)
“Sorry,” Pansy said. She dropped back down off of her tiptoes. “I don’t like being sad, and I figured this would cheer me up, which it did.”
“I still want to suck your dick.” Massi uncrosses his arms and lowers them. Draco reaches out and takes one of Massi’s hands. He tugs the other man close and looks up at him. He tells himself that Massi is just a pretty object. He’s a mark. And right now he’s wrapped around Draco’s little finger. Quite literally. Massi has intertwined their fingers.
Watching Potter cook is a revelation. Draco’s been in potions classes with the man, and he doesn’t remember Potter’s knife skills being nearly this good. Draco had offered to help chop, but Potter had waved him off, and now as Draco watches, Potter deftly dices an onion, some celery and several carrots all in quick succession.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Potter,” Draco surprises himself by saying. Potter turns to look at him. “No one should ever be ‘used to losing people’.” Potter shrugs and Draco shakes his head at him. “No.”
“Oh, I hadn’t thought,” Harry said, because he hadn’t. He would be the first to admit that sometimes he could be slow to think of things, but he was a little surprised that Hermione hadn’t mentioned it. “I can. If you’d like.”
“Harry’s got a point,” Draco said. “There’s no reason to wait until the morning. In some places, it’s actually tradition to have presents the night before.”
“What form does your boggart take and how do you typically deal with it?” Pansy asks, cutting off whatever Granger was about to say.
“Don’t mention it.” Harry looked up and saw Ernie grinning at them. He leaned against Draco for a moment, marveling in the fact that he could, even if just briefly, and Draco gave him a small smile. Then he moved away as more students began to appear from the tunnel.
“Dobby,” Ron called. A moment later the elf appeared. “Can you stay in this room until we come back? It might be a few hours. But we need you to stay in this room and make sure it doesn’t change. Can you do that?” Dobby drew himself to his full, albeit still tiny, height.
This, of course, sends him down the mental rabbit hole of what he would do if Draco were kidnapped. He had told Pansy he would be fine, but would he? Shit. He loves Hermione like a sister, but that’s nothing compared to the depth of feeling that he has for Draco. It has only been five months, give or take a few days, but he is starting to think that Draco might be
He tore open the wrapping with shaking hands. Inside was a box, which he then also opened to find an emerald green, cashmere scarf. He pulled it out of the box and stared at it, amazed. It felt as soft as butter.
For this, Draco wears a tan trench coat, while Harry wears just a plain white button-down shirt, which quickly turns translucent in the conjured rain. Perhaps, Draco thinks, the woman knows what she is talking about.
“Indeed.” They stand there for a long moment while Parkinson continues to glare at both of them, alternating between them.
“So let me get this straight,” Draco says after listening to Harry relate much of his sixth year at Hogwarts. “You had a book that helped you with potions?” He is laying on his side in the grass now, propped up on an elbow.
“Yes,” Draco said. “Wait! No!” Harry snapped his mouth shut. “He’s keeping the Room of Requirement the way that it is.”
“You were,” she agrees. “But apologizing doesn’t automatically make it better. Nor does it prove to me that you’re part of the group you say you’re part of.” McLaggen nods and chews the inside of his cheek.
“I mainly worked lunchtimes. And in interior design.” He laughs at himself. “I’m not really sure I can call it interior design. There was no real design in mind. It was a bit of a hodgepodge of things that Hannah could afford to replace at any given time.”
“Nagini,” came a hiss from the other end of the table. It took all of Harry’s self control not to flinch or to look over at Voldemort as he spoke, because he knew he was the only other person at the table who could understand what Voldemort was saying. “Go seek out the cup that is like you.”
“Well, if we take the Tube, that obviously takes longer than apparating.” Potter is clearly still stuck on the question of transportation.
After what felt like an hour, but in reality was about three minutes, they were spat out into a cavernous room, tiled in marble. Draco caught Harry before he could fall over, for which Harry was grateful, particularly when he looked around and saw that Narcissa had been awaiting their arrival.
“Nothing,” she said quickly. “I just never knew.” Harry thought he had heard Draco mention contact lenses before, but could not recall in what context. Whatever it had been, Harry hadn’t thought much of it at the time, but now he looked curiously at Draco.
“Actually, for the most part, I just avoid them. I don’t actually hate them. And may I point out to you that
“Oh, no,” she says. “Harry and I haven’t been together for years.” Draco extricates himself from the conversation, worried that Ginny’s magnanimity towards him will fade if he stays. She had insisted to him earlier that she was over Harry, but Draco isn’t sure anyone can ever truly get over Harry.
“What do I wear?” Draco cries, flipping through the entirety of his closet that Kreacher has packed for him in an undetectably extended suitcase. (He has even organized it by color, bless him)
“Anytime.” She walks out of the store. Harry wastes no time in opening the door to the Cooler and running downstairs.
“Mm,” Draco says. “Did their following come from the lime green get ups? Or from the time they levitated Luca above us on a bookshelf?”
“Thank you. Now please continue this delightful fashion show.” Harry rolled his eyes, but began to pull the most recent shirt off over his head. He put it on top of the pile that Draco was now holding and then turned away. Draco let the door to the fitting room swing closed behind him. Then he hurried over to where Claire was hovering at the end of the corridor and handed her pile.
“Not officially, but there is a bust of Rowena Ravenclaw up in Ravenclaw tower where she’s wearing something that
“Oi,” Seamus called. “Malfoy and Potter. Get your arses over here and join in.” Harry and Draco looked at each other, their faces wearing matching looks of concern. “I will not take no as an answer.”
About seven years ago, The Leaky Cauldron, which for hundreds of years leading up to the Second Wizarding War had not changed its decor in the slightest, had undergone a remodel. Tom, the old barkeep had finally passed away, leaving the pub to his niece, Hannah Abbott.
Unbidden, a memory washes over her. Not long before the Battle of Hogwarts, she had been up late in the common room studying for a Charms exam the following day, when Greg and Vince had come in, chuckling and nudging each other. At first she had thought nothing of it, but it quickly became clear that they hadn't noticed her. Vince had lifted up his sleeve and pointed at something on his arm. Pansy had been unable to see what as Greg had been standing in her line of sight.
“Is this your way of saying that you just opened an ice cream parlor?” Draco asks. His tone is bored. Harry sighs.
“Blimey,” George said. “Fred, I think we’ve sat down at the wrong table.” But he grinned as he said it and inclined his head towards Blaise by way of a greeting.
“So, tell me about your reaction to brewing a polyjuice potion. I think it’s the first time I’ve seen either you or Ron show any enthusiasm for a potion, and it is not an easy one by any stretch of the imagination.” Harry put his arms over Draco’s and hugged him closer.
“But for now, we will just have you sample some.” He held the phial up to his eye and, seeing that it was the correct amount, nodded to himself before filling a second phial. He handed the two measures of potion to Harry and Draco and then looked at them expectantly.
Presently they reached a spiral staircase and Luna dropped his hand as they climbed it. The staircase ended in a door with no handle and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. Luna reached out and knocked once. The eagle opened its beak and spoke in a musical tone.
“Yes.” Malfoy is silent for a long moment and stares at the wall behind Harry’s shoulders. Then he snaps to attention. “Well, no time like the present, I suppose. How do you feel about Wiltshire?”
When they reached the Room of Requirement, they found that the Slytherins had beaten them there. There was a door already set into the stone wall, with a sign on it instructing them to “Come in, losers”. Harry raised his hand to knock before stopping himself and just turning the door handle.
In hindsight, he should have realized that he and Draco could not keep it a secret forever, so perhaps he should have started dropping small comments about how perhaps the Slytherin wasn’t nearly so bad as they all thought he was. But then that would have interfered with their plan to have a giant fight to convince everyone that it was business as usual between them.
Was it what he had envisioned himself doing while he was at Hogwarts? No. But did it pay the bills? Yes. And once Big Dick had hired Draco, he had agreed to take on a subdued Greg Goyle, freshly back from a three year stint at Azkaban, which gave Draco both a roommate and someone to help pay the mortgage.
“I did no such thing,” Draco protested. “In regards to cheating at least.” He smirked and Harry nudged him playfully on the shoulder.
“Of course not. We used real guinea pigs for that. Take it or leave it, Potter. I just figured it would help with your, ah, situation.” Somehow Snape managed to draw out the word situation so that it sounded longer than its four syllables.
Draco’s room is at the top of the house, on the fourth floor, under the eaves. In reality, the whole floor is his, though the floor consists of just a landing, his bedroom, and a small bathroom. This evening the stairs feel like they take forever and his feet feel as though they are made of lead. He blames the man with the giant bloody pockets and sticky fingers for this exhaustion. It feels good to blame someone.
Harry leaned back in his chair, full and happy. The best part was that since they were finished eating, they could go back to Hogwarts soon. He could hardly wait, though he kept any impatience off of his face so as not to insult Draco’s mother. Instead, he sipped at the last of his wine pairings and let the sound of conversation wash over him.
“Let’s go see Dempsey.” In his exasperation, and still in an attempt to seem alright with things, Draco slaps a hand to his forehead.
“No,” Ron said, then he paused and cocked his head to the side, frowning at Harry. “Why do you ask? Is this about your bet with Seamus?” Harry’s mouth fell open.
“Thank you,” he says, his voice breathy in his excitement. He pulls the jumper out of its box and holds it up against his chest. “It’s lovely.” Before he can say any more, Draco interrupts him with an excited,
Ginny had taken it as well as could be expected. She had been rightfully upset, but had realized that Harry couldn’t help liking who he liked. However she has never actually seen him with anyone else. None of his previous relationships have been this public, or even public at all. And Harry isn’t sure how she will react.
“Tomorrow is the first day of December,” Blaise shot back. “We go home for the Christmas hols in just over three weeks.”
“The fish course,” Wilfie said, once the vegetable plates were cleared. “Is being a tempura fried black cod in dipping sauce with a cucumber foam on top with saffron strands.” He bowed low and the fish appeared. Harry looked down at it. It looked like fried fish that you might get at a fish and chip shop and was sitting in a pool of what looked like vinegar, but upon tasting was instead salty and sweet. The fish itself was delicate, buttery and a little bit sweet. Just when Harry had thought he had found a favorite dish (the lobster), he had now found another one.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry said again. He reached up with his free hand to wipe away the tear, but Draco batted his hand away, his face hardening.
Hermione noted through her melancholy that Blaise hadn’t said that he wouldn’t bring down Voldemort for her. But then, she had heard that the Zabinis, or at least Blaise’s mother, hadn’t taken any sort of side in the war that wasn’t a war yet. She wondered if she was starting to push him towards the side of the Order. Or at the very least away from the Dark side.
“Don’t play dumb with us, Malfoy,” Luca hisses, trying to look threatening, but instead he merely looks short sighted.
Harry is out of the hot tub in a moment. He grabs Massi’s wand where he has left it next to the veritaserum and kneels next to Draco. He waves Massi’s wand over Draco and then frowns at the readout. Draco has a concussion, and his lower back is bruised but it is nothing that magic can’t fix. Though Harry is not going to attempt anything using someone else's wand.
Draco himself had given Harry a replica of his Slytherin quidditch shirt, and Harry was so excited about it, that he immediately pulled off the Weasley jumper he was wearing and pulled it on instead.
comfort. At least it wasn’t a smile? Blaise, who was sitting next to Draco, was staring intently over at the Gryffindor table. Harry wondered who he was trying to catch the attention of and then deduced that it must be Hermione, who was sitting next to him. But she was just staring into space, oblivious to everyone, even Ron who was now sitting beside her, rubbing small circles into her back.
Severus didn't think he was wrong - the more allies they had in the upcoming war against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named the better. He just wished Dumbledore weren't so damn smug about it. All that eye twinkling was exhausting.
He knows what makes him happy and he knows what makes him tick. He might not know all of Harry’s hopes and dreams, but short of that, he feels as though they could go on a Muggle dating quiz show and he could easily tell people how Harry likes his tea (with milk and two sugars, the heathen), or how Harry’s hair really just
“What do you think?” he asked. Draco’s eyes raked his body and Harry felt himself blush (which was ridiculous as Draco had now seen him naked many times).
While he waits, he pulls out his phone and scrolls through his text messages. There’s nothing new there, not with Pansy in Argentina. Which — now that he thinks about it — how is he supposed to get a hold of Pansy if she’s (presumably) stuck there? Is their business just going to grind to a halt while this virus keeps everyone inside?
“Great!” Ron said with mock enthusiasm. “That answers all my questions.” He crossed his arms across his chest and scowled at Draco.
“Dear lord, Dean,” Harry muttered, his face turning red, as Seamus fell off his bed laughing. “You are the
Pansy reached for her shirt and the covers fell down. She hurried to lift them again, and Harry noticed with disinterest that her breasts were rather full. He wondered if he should share this with Ron, and then realized that there was no way he could share this with Ron. Harry was not so unobservant that he hadn't noticed his friend’s interest in Pansy. In fact, if Neville was to be believed, Ron had kissed Pansy the night before. She had apparently slapped him, and it was clear now why she had done that.
He had a nervous knot of energy at the pit of his stomach, that somersaulted and jumped around as he walked. This was it. They were going to be naked. Properly naked. In a bed. Together. Running their hands over each other. He shivered as he imagined Draco running his hands down his torso.
“You can’t just distract me like that. I have another present to give you.” With these words, Draco disentangled himself from Harry’s arms and walked over to his bag. He rummaged around in it for a moment and then pulled out a small, wrapped parcel which he then thrust into Harry’s hands. Then he stepped back and stared at Harry, gnawing on his lower lip nervously.
“Well, if you don’t need me, I might just head on home.” He begins to stand, but a quick glare from Croaker sends him back to his seat.
“Oh, right. Yes, of course.” He moves to the side and leans in what he hopes is a casual manner against the wall next to the door. As his hand touches the wall, he feels for the security ward and adds Potter to the list of allowed people. “Come in, come in.” He gestures and Potter finally takes the hint and walks inside. Draco shuts the door behind him. “Uh, the sitting room is upstairs.” He allows Potter to walk up the stairs before him and it is only when he is then eye level with Potter’s arse that he thinks that perhaps he should have gone first. And now he is worried that Potter will think he is checking him out. Which, in all fairness, Draco is, but he does not want Potter to know that.
As soon as he’s left the room, Draco feels the tension go out of his shoulders. He hadn’t realized how tense he’d been with Potter around, but he does feel rather like he’s been walking on eggshells all night. All day, really.
“Thank you,” he says. He glances to the chair next to him where Harry is sitting and sees that Harry is beaming.
For the first time in the pensieve excursion, the other three are rapt in attention. Their heads move in unison as they watch Harry and Voldemort’s conversation. Harry is almost surprised they don’t remember this, but then he realizes that none of them were there.
But the more he thought about it, the more his hormones took over, until he was quite convinced that all he wanted to do was rip all of Draco’s clothes off. Right. Now.
“And I need a change of clothes for the morning,” he said. “You lot might be fine prancing around in your pajamas, but I have an image to uphold.” Which is why he brought an entire bag, with the present hidden inside.
“Non lo so,” Massi says. Draco frowns at him, keeping up the pretense that he can’t understand Italian. “I don’t know.” Draco smirks and begins to move his hand up and down. Massi closes his eyes. “Si. Mi piace.” Draco doesn’t need to understand much Italian to know that he means yes.
“Potter, we’re not teenagers going to the cinema to make out. I at least want to see something good.” Harry frowns.
At the same time, he still feels hollow every time he glances down at Oliver’s watch. He really ought to have asked for a new one. And so he is annoyed at himself for not doing that. And he is still angry with Potter for not telling him about Oliver the night before, even if a small part of him understands that there was never quite a good time to do it.
“Hmm. I suppose in our own ways we both had shit childhoods, didn’t we?” Draco says. Over the past few years, he has started to realize that the childhood he had previously thought was rather sheltered and spoiled, was instead devoid of much emotional stability.
“Moving on,” Granger says, doing just that with the conversation. “You will now stay over at Harry’s at least once a week and in that time, you will train with Harry and I. As I said, we will start with Auror training and move on from there.”
He turns on his side, trying to get comfortable, and on an impulse snakes out an arm and drapes it over Draco’s torso. Draco doesn’t wake, but Harry revels in the closeness nonetheless.
“Who did you kiss?” Seamus asked. It seemed like the only way he was going to get information from Neville was by asking the blunt questions.
“Are you going back to Harry’s tonight?” Greg asks. He says it casually, but Draco feels like it is a leading question.
“Yes, if everything goes to plan, I will move in in about a month.” When Draco doesn’t say anything, Harry continues. “Did you want to come and see it?”
And that was how Harry came to lead two “Remedial Defense Against the Dark Arts” classes a week. Not that he would dare complain about it. At least not to anyone but Draco.
Draco picks up the pace, watching Harry’s face to make sure that he’s fine with that. It is hard to tell. Harry’s eyes are closed now and while Draco has seen his orgasm face, it has been a while and the memory is hazy.
Except, now he’s the asset, isn’t he? He is the proud owner of all of the Ministry’s secrets, whether he knows it or not. So she can’t kill him. In fact, she must do the opposite of that, at least until they figure out a way of getting all of the bloody secrets out of his head. She suddenly wants to curse whomever thought up with The Reliquary in the first place. It seems like such a stupid idea in hindsight.
“Harry,” Dumbledore said as everyone dispersed. “Can I speak with you alone for a moment?” Draco and Harry traded looks but Harry nodded while Draco left.
But, then, he thinks, they can’t be together. They quite definitely can’t. Maybe if Draco were no longer his asset... But how would that happen? Short of Draco becoming a full Unspeakable, Harry can’t see any way that their relationship would ever be approved.
“So you followed me?” Harry nodded again. “Foolish girl.” Harry took a deep breath and squared his shoulders.
While Harry and Massi watch, Draco begins to swing his hips in time with the music. He is about to shimmy out of his swimming trunks when a house elf appears beside him with a loud crack. Draco jumps in alarm and slips on the slick pool tiles. He lands hard on his back, his head slamming into the tiles.
“Right,” Greg says, nodding. “When you brought him home to meet them after your first date. Blimey that was fast.”
“Uh,” Harry managed to get out. He had thought Narcissa had wanted to meet him, but clearly that had been a ruse to get him to come in here so that she could yell at him. Perhaps he should have seen this coming. He was only half concentrating on what Narcissa was saying. The other half of him was trying to figure out if he could take out his wand without her noticing in case he needed to defend himself.
“But can we get dinner first?” Ron asked. “I’m starving.” They all agreed to that and so turned their steps towards the Great Hall.
Harry watched out of the corner of his eye as Voldemort’s snake uncoiled herself from his chair and slithered out of the room. He needed to stop her somehow. But how to do that without anyone noticing?
. But then, those same wizards often seemed particular about whether or not someone had been born to Muggle parents or not and it seemed that those wizards took more umbrage over the fact that Muggle-born witches and wizards did not automatically invoke Merlin or Morgana or some other famous wizard in their cursing. Blaise, however, did not seem to bat an eyelid.
Apologies for the delay on my other story - The Wizarding World is Not Enough - my beta has been really busy but he says he can hopefully get to it this week.
“This is true.” Even though he’d heard it several times now, Harry thrilled whenever Draco said he loved him.
“Of course,” Harry says. He takes the quill and the magazine and scrawls his signature over part of the background of their picture. He hands it back to Luca. Luca turns too Draco.
“I’ll walk with you to the elevator,” he says and follows her out the door. They walk in silence down the corridor. Hermione’s watch flashes purple as the reach the end and she looks down at it. Harry looks at his own watch for something to do, but it remains the same color.
“You wish, Potter,” Draco said, but the smirk on his face was one of amusement. Pansy frowned as she watched them. Although Draco had told her yesterday that they were dating, it was still shocking to see them be so intimate with each other. She looked away as Draco leaned down to presumably kiss the brunet.
Potter slides into the seat next to him and moves it ever so slightly closer, so that their knees are practically touching under the bar and when he leans forward, their elbows battle for space on the bar top. Draco’s breath catches for a moment in his throat, but he pushes the feeling aside. He can be professional. He just needs to remember that he’s still slightly pissed off at him for not telling him about Oliver.
“Yes,” Harry’s excited hiss was loud in his head. “That’s it. Come for me, Draco.” Somehow these were the words that brought Draco over the edge. His orgasm crashed through him and a moan escaped his mouth as he coated his stomach. A moment later, he heard Harry’s answering cry and he imagined the look of bliss that was most likely on the brunet’s face. He smiled, content. His mind was now thankfully blank. He listened as Harry’s breathing slowed to normal.
“Of course,” Draco says. He bows as Signore Battaglia dismisses him and then walks out of the room, holding his head high and trying to seem as confident, if deferent, as possible.
“Hi Susan,” he says. Susan is looking around the Cooler with wide, surprised eyes. She jumps when she hears him.
“How can I forget that you said you were trying to sleep with someone else recently and my best friend stopped you?”
Hermione had impressed upon them as they left that they would be pretty much entirely on their own for this mission as the Ministry didn’t want the Battaglia family to catch wind of the fact that someone was surveilling them. It is not the first time Harry has been on such a mission, but it has been a while. It had felt strange when Banks had turned his watch to its emergency only function. But in a way he feels free. It’s just him and Draco and the mission at hand.
“We’ll only tell you if you don’t report it,” Seamus said. Hermione stood up and whacked him on the back of the head with her book.
“Well, look at you. You’re on tenterhooks over there.” She stands again and makes her way over to him. He sits, frozen, unsure of what is going on and jumps when she starts to smooth down his hair.
And while the whisky has dulled some of the adrenaline from earlier, it has also lowered his inhibitions. Thus, when he crawls into bed, it takes all of his will power not to move over to Potter’s side of the bed and wrap his arms around the man. Because somehow, despite being tired and more than a little drunk, he is wide awake.
There was another small pop and a fireplace inserted itself against the wall of the castle. A fire sprang up in the grate. “Let me rephrase,” Draco said, settling himself properly in his seat. “What are you doing out here aside from decorating the place?” Harry gave a small snort of laughter. Draco decided that was a good sign. He couldn’t be
It is almost working when he feels a hand on his waist and a person dancing up behind him. His eyes snap open, but he does not turn around, preferring to pretend the mystery dancer is anyone but Potter. Instead he concentrates on the feel of the body behind him as he dances closer, pressing himself against the other man. Hands slip closer around his waist and Draco reaches up behind himself with one hand, intending to cup Potter’s cheek with his hand.
And quite suddenly, he didn’t want to be in Draco’s arms. He pulled away and picked up his broom. He began to scramble up the chute, not looking behind him to see if Draco was following.
The morning dawned far too early and far too bright. Harry groaned as he rolled over and scrabbled around on the bedside table for his glasses. He had snuck into Gryffindor tower at an hour so late that he didn't even want to contemplate it.
“Why don’t we just tell her we have something at the Cooler we want to show her?” McLaggen asks. Harry nods.
“Thank you,” and sits up. He wipes the residual tears off of his face and then slaps his palms down on his thighs.
“Quiet down,” Big Dick says, waving his arms to get everyone’s attention. Draco is more than happy for the shift in attention. “Now that we’re all here, I would like to introduce you to your newest coworker!”
Draco stands near the registers, watching as the flood of people moves through the store. Not for the first time he thinks about the flyer up on the wall of the break room, advertising the assistant manager position. It has been unfilled for several years now and Big Dick wants to put a change to that. Draco knows that more than anything, Big Dick wants an official person that he can push unwanted work onto. Draco resolves that if today goes off without a hitch that he will apply for the position. And then he knows that as soon as he has decided that, there will be problems.
“Good,” Harry interjected. “Because we’re doing a joint costume and mine won’t really make sense without him.”
“Cheers to that.” He holds out his drink and she rolls her eyes but clinks her glass against it nonetheless. “So you’ll join us?”
“Granger wanted them to be very low profile.” McLaggen brings his hand up to his mouth and chews on his thumbnail for a moment.
“Who here has been personally victimized by Draco Malfoy?” Blaise asked, smirking. Everyone raised their hands and Draco crossed his arms and sulked.
“Not much,” he mumbled. But Harry had been friends with Ron for too long to know that this meant Ron was hiding something.
“No,” he says once he’s swallowed the mouthful. “No, that can’t be right. Oliver wouldn’t do something like that.” Harry’s lips are pursed again and he is frowning. Malfoy clearly understands from his expression that he’s being serious because he slumps back down in his chair again. “Fuck,” he says quietly. “Then why’d he send it to
“How many fucking Unbreakable Vows do I have to swear?” McLaggen asks. He crosses his arms and slumps back in his chair.
“Well, Professor,” he said. “Pansy and I have been strategizing how best to get the Death Eaters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and his snake into Hogwarts and how to split them up once they’re here. We reckon that we should encourage them to use the Vanishing Cabinet in Borgin and Burkes once Draco, Blaise and Hermione fix it. This has the benefit of only allowing a few people through at a time. Once they emerge, we draw them out into the castle, so they become separated.
“Accio Draco’s wand,” he says and the wand flies over from where it had landed. Greg grabs it out of the air and hands it to Draco.
With a sigh, Draco relented. He picked up the notes he was reading and took them over to the corner of the room. As soon as Harry was sure he was not looking, he put the pillow down and eased his trousers back on. In the surprise and embarrassment of Snape walking into the room, his erection had gone away - a fact for which he was grateful. He quickly re-buckled his belt and then made his way over to the table.
“No,” Hermione interjected. “That was me. And we all remember the stupid articles, don’t we? So let’s let that drop now.” She put a hand on Draco’s arm. “But I do remember how miserable that was, and I don’t want that to happen to you, so you need to control your boyfriend.”
“Eh,” McLaggen says, still not looking up. “You might have been right to. I shouldn’t have said that.” Pansy stares at the top of his head for a moment before she reaches out and takes Cormac’s hand. He looks up.
It is in this manner that almost two months pass in what feels like the blink of an eye, and Draco walks into Flourish and Blotts one Tuesday and is surprised to find the store decorated for Halloween.
Draco was still passed out on the pillows beside him. There was a deep frown marring his face and the feeling of contentment that Harry had been feeling since witnessing their possible future began to fade. After all, it was only
And so Pansy is dressed as a cat, standing on Hannah Abbott’s doorstep. Behind her stand Joe and Luca, who had seized upon the fact that
As it turned out, Draco had actually saved the main part of Harry’s present for when they went to bed as he had been too embarrassed to give it to Harry in front of everyone. Of course, since he and Harry were now the pair sleeping in Gryffindor tower, he had to come up with an excuse to get something from his dorm before they left for the night. Luckily, his toothbrush was also there, so Harry was none the wiser.
“Hey Draco,” Seamus says. “How are you?” He crosses the space between them and pulls Draco into a quick, one armed hug and it is only because Harry has trained as an Unspeakable and has worked very hard on keeping his emotions in check that the surprise that he feels does not show on his face.
think we’re friends?” He looks taken aback by the question. His mouth falls open and Pansy thinks back to two weeks ago when he had kissed her and thinks that it’s perhaps the closest they’ve come to being friends.
“Is that so?” Draco’s tone was playful but his eyes were not. And suddenly Harry felt Draco’s hand reach inside his boxers and grab his cock. He gasped. “Who’s the bitch now?”
In June of 1998, Harry, unmoored from responsibility after the defeat of Voldemort, had been aimlessly wandering down Diagon Alley when he had come across the boarded up shop. He remembered Florean from the summer before third year, when the kindly man had helped him with his History of Magic homework and had given him free ice cream. He’d heard that Florean had been killed by the Death Eaters, but it had taken seeing the shop like this before Florean’s death had really hit home for Harry - and with it, the full impact of the war that he had just ended. For it was not just Florean who had died. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people had been killed at the hands of the Death Eaters. And for what? It had all seemed so pointless.
“My father wanted to see me because he was upset that I had taken you to the Wunderkammer,” Massi whispers. “But then I told him about your reason for coming here, and he’s agreed to see you.”
“You could lie about it,” Ron suggested. “What’s Voldy going to do? Perform an autopsy?” Harry laughed, then quickly realized he was the only one laughing and so stopped.
It is all Harry can do to stay professional. The more time that he spends with Draco - and he spends a damn lot of time with Draco - the more he likes him. And the more he likes him in a way that is not allowed in a professional setting. Draco is his asset for godssake. He’s not supposed to fall in love with him. But Harry fears that is what is happening.
“Yes,” Harry says firmly - more firmly than he feels, for he worries that Ginny will take one look at Draco and do her infamous Bat Bogey hex on him. “We’re both adults and we’ve been broken up for years now.”
So instead he goes back to researching Chester Davies in the hopes that the highest ranking member of the Ministry who is in the Simurgh Society will tell him something about them.
“Are you absolutely sure about this?” Ron said once they had finished running through the plan again on the morning of Christmas Eve. “I just feel like there are so many ways in which it could go wrong.”
“Harry,” Draco said sternly, but Harry was too far gone, doubled over in hysterics. The blond sighed. “That’s it,” he said and grabbed Harry’s cock. That shut Harry up. “Better,” Draco continued. “Now, did you want to pick up where we left off?”
“This would all have been so much easier if they hadn't been here,” Harry said. He felt bad admitting it, but it was true. Draco laughed.
“The first step,” Pansy says. “Is to change the name of our group.” Granger frowns at her. “Tell her, McLaggen.” She nudges him with her elbow and watches as his face turns scarlet.
“If you are,” he says. He shifts slightly under Harry and sees a spasm of desire flash across Harry’s face again. And he knows he has him. He jerks his hips up and is rewarded by Harry’s raised eyebrow again.
It was a clear, bright morning and the six of them were in high spirits as they walked through the snow covered grounds down to the gates. They each carried with them a letter from Dumbledore which would open the gates as they drew close. Sure enough as they neared the flying boar topped pillars, the great iron gates swung open.
“Sure it is.” He frowns and leans forward across the table towards her. It takes every ounce of her self control not to jerk backwards.
“I’m not sure,” Harry says, frowning. “But either way, you’d better get up.” Draco grumbles for a moment, but swings his legs out from under the covers.
“We wait for someone else to come along,” Luna said. Harry frowned and checked his watch. He didn’t have time to wait for someone else to come along.
He glances at the clock and sees that it is now quarter to six. His stomach lurches with nerves. He still needs to change and so he takes the stairs up to his room two at a time. Although his closet seems to mock him while he tries to pick out an outfit that is both nice, but also not trying too hard, he makes it back down to the kitchen by two minutes to six. He takes one last look around and decides that everything looks fine. He sighs and sits down on one of the chairs only to leap up a moment later as he hears the doorbell ring.
“I think we should move in together,” Draco said, squinting up at the blue sky above Hogsmeade Station.
He was tired, but he couldn’t sleep. He kept picturing the Chamber of Secrets when he closed his eyes. He was still in awe that Harry had faced the basilisk there when he was twelve. The skeleton alone had been scary enough for Draco. But Harry hadn’t been phased. Merlin, if saving the world were up to Draco, nothing would get done. But Harry? Draco sighed. Harry was better than Draco could ever hope to be.
Once Draco was satisfied, it was time for Harry to try everything on. A shop assistant showed them to a fitting room and told them that her name was Claire, and if they needed anything, all they had to do was ask, before bustling back out to the store floor.
“Hi,” Harry said. His arms were full of books and parchment and his ink pot was perched precariously on the top of the pile. Draco pushed past him to get to the door first and Harry went sprawling down the corridor, books, papers, and ink flying everywhere. Daphne Greengrass shrieked as a glob of ink hit her square on the face, turning her cheek blue.
He sped up his pace. Draco had clearly wasted no time in getting there as he had disappeared from Harry’s view by the time Harry made his way out of the dungeons. He hoped no one had observed that. But there were very few people in the corridors, so Harry wasn’t overly worried.
“Fine,” Luca says. “We’ll go ask Greg. Come on, Joe.” He takes Joe by the hand and drags him back out into the store. Draco watches as the stock room door closes behind them before rolling his eyes. Then he turns his attention to the new inventory of books that they’ve received and begins cataloging them.
“You just tap it and say ‘Show me’,” Harry says. “Same as the other messages.” Draco nods and does so. Pansy’s face projects out from the watch face.
His mother was standing next to his bed, methodically un-shrinking Draco’s pile of Christmas presents which now sat atop his blankets. When she heard the door open, she turned to face them.
“Yes.” Aberforth pulled out his wand and began to form a patronus before he lowered it again. None of the students had flinched. Either they were very good liars, or they actually had his brother’s permission.
Ron couldn’t believe it. He, Pansy, Hermione and Blaise had come across the three bodies in the corridor just a few minutes ago and Ron had been so shocked he'd stopped walking. Hermione had immediately burst into tears while Pansy had headed straight to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and had started stabbing him with one of the basilisk fangs she was still carrying. Ron hadn’t tried to stop her. He hadn’t known what to do with himself, so he’d walked over and stood behind her while she took out her rage on the former Dark Lord.
Things progressed quickly from there. Before long, most of their clothes were on the floor and Draco’s little cat was sitting dejectedly by the door.
“Lunch can wait,” Draco said as they entered their private room. “We have some unfinished ravishing to attend to, and the faster you get better the faster we can continue that.” Harry stared at him. “What? I’m a teenage boy with teenage hormones. Now get your trousers off.” Harry looked at the ceiling in exasperation.
Harry knows that if he can just get through lunch with the Malfoys, he has dinner with the Weasleys to look forward to. Not that he’s dreading the lunch with Draco’s family, but he would be lying if he said he was looking forward to it. Still, they are here now, so he is going to make the best of it.
But now it was time to fix the place up. The Parlour was just a few doors down from Flourish and Blotts, so Harry would be able to keep an eye on Draco while he worked there during the day. It was not that he didn’t trust Pansy to do it, except, well, he didn’t really trust Pansy to do it. After all, she had killed Oliver. Or let him die. Same difference in Harry’s mind. And while Dempsey, Croaker and Hermione all seemed to trust her, Harry still did not.
“Even better,” Pansy says. “I’ll be right back.” She stands up abruptly and hurries out of the Cooler. She is a little concerned about leaving McLaggen in there alone, but how much damage could he really do?
But for some reason, the idea of pretending to be spies stuck and they spent the next few hours keeping up the charade. It made it feel less like work and more like a game, though, they both agreed that it was a very serious game. They were serious spies and this was a serious potion, so they had to get it perfect. Somewhere along the way they gave each other code names, and then began giving codenames to their friends, even though they weren’t in the room.
Draco nodded and Pansy popped the top off. She threw her head back and took what Ron thought was an impressively long swig from it. When she placed it back on the table, he picked it up. After the slap on the face, he was feeling less sure of himself, but as the whisky burned its way down his throat, he thought he felt more of the liquid courage kick in again.
Once Potter finishes his own toast, he waves his wand to send the plates to the sink. Then he turns to Draco.
“Oh bother. Well, I love it anyway. Thank you, Draco.” He leaned over and attempted to kiss Draco on the cheek, but Draco turned his head at the last moment so it ended up being partly on his lips. “Now, open mine!”
,” Blaise said. He pulled it out of his bag and placed it on the table. Hermione laughed and placed her own copy on the table.
A house elf appears and cuts the cake quickly before passing it out and disappearing again. Harry digs into his cake with gusto. While everything in the meal has been delicious, this might be his favorite thing. The richness of the chocolate cake is complemented by the the whipped cream and cut by the tartness of the cherries. He savors it, just as he’s savoring this entire afternoon, and when he sits back to look around the room once he’s finished eating, he feels nothing but contentment.
“Except when it comes to girls, when you have the emotional range of a teaspoon,” Harry said, remembering the argument the year before with Hermione.
The house is impressive and nicely designed, but it isn't until they get to the master bedroom that Draco gets truly envious.
“Harry,” he said. “You and I need to talk.” Harry squirmed under the look that Ron was giving him and meekly nodded.
“Yes, well, it’s somewhat related to that,” Draco said. He wasn’t looking at Harry, but rather was looking down at his hands which were twisting in his lap.
“Sure,” Ron said. “But how are we going to respond? The owl’s gone.” Harry smiled and tapped his glasses. Ron frowned at him.
Greg looks visibly affronted when he walks into the store dressed in a Prada suit with silver glitter devil’s horns.
“What do you think?” Harry asks, turning to Draco. The blond, for his part, is staring at the room with wide eyes. He had clearly not expected this to be behind the secret door in the closet.
He really hasn’t thanked Harry enough for fighting so hard to keep him out of Azkaban, because Draco knows that it is mostly due to Harry’s testimony that he had stayed a free man. True, it had been hard to hear Harry say that Draco had been a coward for most of the war, but now, with ten years of reflection, Draco supposes it was probably true. He had done all the things that he had in order to save his own skin, while Harry had literally sacrificed himself for the wizarding world. Draco’s not sure any number of blowjobs will be enough to thank Harry for all that he did.
Draco suppresses a moan as Harry’s lips meet his. Harry feels like home. Kissing Harry makes Draco feel less like this entire situation is fucked, and more like things are going to work out - even as Massi’s hands tentatively roam Draco’s chest and ever so slowly make their way down to the tops of his trousers. Draco moves his own hand southwards and squeezes Massi’s ass. He has to admit that it is a very nice ass.
“In case you ever have to deal with muggles,” she’d said with only the smallest of sneers on her face. “It’s better you have a fountain pen than a quill.” Because no wizard such as himself would ever be caught dead with a
Dumbledore stood and attracted the hall’s attention with a large boom that emanated from his wand. Without thinking, Harry reached out and took Draco’s hand under the table. The fact that Dumbledore was about to announce their plan to the school made it all feel real and he wasn’t sure he was ready for it.
Silence falls as Draco turns his attention to his toast, not wanting to talk more about the night before. What would be the point? He finishes his toast and instead focuses on coffee. It is black, which is not how he prefers it, but he had not wanted to ask Potter where the milk and the sugar were and so has resigned himself to the bitterness.
“I can’t believe you just did that,” Harry said. He was holding back giggles as he stared out at the dancing students. No one seemed to be staring in their direction. So perhaps Draco had actually pulled it off?
better while he was alive. If he hadn’t wanted Draco to have these things, why hadn’t he told that to Harry, who he’d clearly wanted to have the three things.
“We’ll need broomsticks,” he says. “Or else we’ll get stuck down there.” He checked his watch. “And it might be a little late tonight. I don’t remember how long it took to get there last time.”
And so he did, inelegantly leaning forward and pressing their lips together. Draco kissed him eagerly for a moment before pulling back. He glanced nervously at the large window against the wall, but there was no one looking out. He turned back to Harry.
“Do I ever? That was possibly the hardest potions challenge he ever gave us. And possibly the only one that I beat you at that year.”
Does this mean he will be sleeping over most nights? Is it the end of Draco’s privacy? He is already aware of the fact that it is the end of his dating life, but he's not sure how well he can handle Potter in his life twenty four seven. The last time they were in such close proximity, they were at Hogwarts and Potter had given him the lovely web of scars on his chest.
“Of course it does,” Narcissa said, her severe air dissipating as she looked at her son. She reached out and took his hands, steering him towards his bed, where she made him sit before settling down next to him. “Draco, I am asking because I need to protect you and in order to do that, I need to know the true nature of your relationship. If you’re friends with Potter, then I’ll need to find a way to protect him as well as you. But if you’re not…” She let her sentence trail off. She didn’t need to finish it for Draco to get the picture.
“Draco,” she says. Her voice seems to fill Draco’s head without traveling through his ears. “We need you to look at this. This man just entered the country on a falsified visa.” He frowns as she holds up a picture of a person. And then it happens again. That strange feeling of suddenly knowing something. Or, more accurately, suddenly recalling a thing he already knows, but had briefly forgotten. He stares at the face again.
“It can though,” he said. He wasn’t sure if this was the best path forward with Justin. Sure, he liked him but was he really ready to go steady? With anyone? Let alone Justin? Couldn’t they just go back to randomly hooking up at parties every week or so? But he had already said it could be something more and to go back on that now, what with Justin was looking up with him hope shining in his eyes, would just be cruel.
tried doing work while he’s in the room? I love Ron - he’s great - but he’s a chatterbox and I don’t have time for his blathering on right now.”
“Harry and Draco are fine,” Granger says quickly. “But it certainly appears there was an ambush of sorts. I’ll be interested to hear what happened when they get back.”
“I would say we parade around the castle, carrying his head aloft to show everyone that he’s dead, but he doesn’t have any hair to hold him up by.”
“No need to be mean,”Harry snapped. He pulled his wand out of his pocket and pointed it at himself. “Tergeo.” Draco nodded approvingly and proceeded to do the same.
“You’re not crazy, Luna,” he said into the side of her head. “People only say that because they wish they were as secure in themselves as you are.”
“Speaking of owls,” Harry said, excited for this segue in the conversation. “Can you owl the Slytherin common room?”
Harry and Blaise seemed to have the exact same idea as to what the other one would want and had gotten each other equally nice bottles of whisky, though from different distilleries. Fred and George had sent Harry a large box of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes with a card saying “Merry Christmas to our favourite investor.”
“Yes.” Hannah takes one of his hands in both of hers and squeezes it. The smile on her face is warm and wide. Draco looks down, embarrassed but he can’t keep from smiling either.
The next day dawned early and bright. But Harry did not wake with the sun. Not in the slightest. None of the Gryffindor sixth years did.
“Fine,” she says. “Yumenoki on the Fulham Road at 1pm.” She had spotted this place across the street from the restaurant where she had encountered Harry and Draco on their “date” back in August and has been trying to come up with an excuse to eat there since.
“How do you reckon that?” Harry asked. He had not yet moved to get redressed as Draco was still there and Harry was wearing nothing under his hospital gown.
“ Hermione looked around the circle and the other three nodded. They lifted their fangs and brought them down onto the diadem as one. Voldemort’s voice gave out in a long shriek. The diadem lay, now mangled and slightly smoking, on the desk. Snape walked over and picked it up.
He mentally kicks himself. He needs to stop overthinking this. He spends time with Potter all the time. This won’t be any different.
Harry is no longer sure what he is doing. Or, rather, he is, but his traitorous heart (libido?) is leading him astray. He should be more professional on this mission. He needs to wine and dine Malfoy so that he can learn about The Reliquary. And yet, here they are, having this deep discussion about the War and their childhoods.
“I started to suspect that he might harbor a piece of Voldemort’s soul when despite his best efforts at Occlumency last year, Voldemort still managed to infiltrate his dreams.” Draco frowned. He didn’t know much about Harry’s Occlumency lessons from the year before, aside from the fact that Harry had struggled to learn the skill.
“Hardly. I don’t know any of the films that are playing now.” Draco gestured up at the titles above them. “What the hell is Tropic Thunder?”
“That must be why is hair is so greasy and lank, no?” Ron dissolved into giggles. He couldn’t help it. He was in a great mood, despite being tired. With his hangover gone, tiredness was the only thing weighing on him. And they had double Potions first thing which meant he would get to see Pansy again. He was practically wriggling with excitement.
“Charming.” Draco walks over to Harry and kisses him on the cheek before walking back to the Simurgh Society papers he had been working on. McLaggen stares, bug-eyed.
Harry stared into the fireplace, watching as the flames happily licked the inside of the chimney. He didn’t want to ask if inanimate objects could be sent through the Floo Network, because he figured the answer must be no if Draco hadn’t suggested it. He took a deep breath and attempted to relax his shoulders, which he realized, in his tension, were up by his ears.
Dobby nodded and disappeared. While they were waiting for him to return, Draco picked up a bottle of normal whisky, uncapped it and took a swig. Harry watched, appreciating the way his hand held the neck of the bottle and the way in which he wrapped his lips around - oh no. Now was not the time to think this way. Harry looked away quickly. Draco passed him the bottle and he took a quick sip.
“I’ll have to teach you Exploding Gobstones Snap on my own then.” He takes her by the arm and they make their way out of the room. Draco keeps his eyes on Greg the entire time but Greg does not look up. (But then, why would he?)
They spent all of dinner catching each other's eye and smiling, a fact that did not slip past Blaise.
“If,” he said, straining, and most likely failing, to keep the dislike out of his voice. “You finish early, then your weekend begins early. There are no other sixth year classes today.” The swot had the gall to look disappointed. Sometimes he wondered what she did for fun, if anything. Excited muttering broke out over the prospect of free time. Severus wondered how many of them would actually finish with any time left in their day. Perhaps this class would surprise him, but in previous years, most pairs had ended up staying late.
Days turn into weeks, and soon Draco and P Squared (as he has taken to calling Potter and Parkinson) start to feel like a proper team. They fall into a rhythm. Draco reads the Prophet in the mornings and reports on anything that sparks. Most of the time P Squared follow up and leave Draco to cover for Pansy at Flourish and Blotts, but sometimes he gets to go along. He has now been to more formal functions in the past few weeks than he had in the previous few years.
“What do you mean there are more of you?” Snape asked Harry when Harry and Draco went to see him the next Monday before Potions.
“Details.” Draco’s gaze was hard now. Harry wished he hadn’t brought up the fact the Lucius was in prison.
“Immediately,” Kreacher says. “Sir,” he adds sullenly. “And Kreacher can stay as long as Master Draco wants.”
“I doubt it,” Harry said. “Seamus and Neville knew where we were going, so they won’t be looking for us.”
“Fair point,” he said. He put the last of the bottles on the table and whistled. “This is quite the haul.”
But then He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had opened his eyes and Ron’s blood had run cold. He'd frozen, not knowing what to do, but had been saved by Harry and Draco waking up too. Draco had run straight at Voldemort and stomped on his face, which had to be the most daring thing Ron had ever seen. He'd almost wished he'd done it.
Draco swooped away and for a moment, it felt to Harry like a Quidditch match - both of them racing to find the snitch. In a way, it was just like that. And Harry was determined to win.
“Hold it up to your mouth and say your response. The watch will translate it into text which will show up on the other Unspeakable’s watch.” Draco nods and does as instructed, holding the watch close and muttering in to it so that Harry cannot hear him.
He is half asleep when he feels Harry’s lip brush his upturned cheek. He thinks he hears Harry whisper,
“What do you need my brothers for?” Ron asked, turning his head to stare at the professor. She flushed pink.
“Um,” Draco says. Pansy is staring daggers at him. After glaring for long enough that she is certain that he is uncomfortable, Pansy rolls her eyes.
“This is a map,” McLaggen says, pulling one piece of paper over in front of them. “On it I have noted where Potter’s new house is and also where I think there have been suspicious deaths. I am treating some of these as suspicious simply due to their location, because it seems to be too much of a coincidence for them all to have been within this five street area.” Pansy stares at the map. McLaggen has made marks along the streets in question, some of which are in different colors.
“-My father is in Azkaban, Potter,” Draco snapped, interrupting Harry. “And my mother isn’t a Death Eater.”
“You will notice that we have also provided you with copper cauldrons for this potion as they also cut down on the brewing time,” Slughorn continued. “Due to the specific properties of copper.”
“Uh, thanks,” he says. “I guess.” He is still processing everything that has happened in the last hour, let alone the last day. The main thing that sticks out in his mind is that Potter is now his fake boyfriend. He dares a glance over at the brunet, but Potter is staring straight ahead down the corridor and ignoring him. Draco supposes there
“That’s unfortunate,” Harry says. They turn to his house and climb the steps to the front door. Draco cranes his neck to look at the ambulance.
He knows that he is going in the right direction as the surveillance spells start to appear more frequently. Most of them are just camera spells, so he walks past them, safe under the invisibility cloak. However as he reaches the door he wants, he slows as there are tangles of spells guarding it.
Perhaps he could just write to his mother and tell her he couldn’t do it. But with his father in Azkaban,
“I have other skills,” he said. “It’s just that taking shots is not one of them.” Pansy reached up and patted him good-naturedly on the shoulder. At that moment, the song changed and Hermione watched as excitement crossed Pansy’s face.
“I guess first we have to figure out what exactly is wrong,” Harry says. “Is she being threatened to act a certain way, or?” He lets the last word hang.
Now it’s mid afternoon and she and McLaggen are back at the Cooler, staring at their completed evidence board.
Third time this month.” Ron sighs and then rolls his shoulders up by his ears before dropping them again. “Anyhow, what brings you here?”
“That would be me,” the blond said. “But no need for such tawdry notions. I’ll serve you for free.” He lifted the corner of his mouth slightly and Harry felt a stab of jealousy go through him.
There was Seamus with his arm wrapped around the shoulder of Justin Finch-Fletchley. Dean was standing next to them, chatting animately, his hands flying everywhere as he related his experience of the fight. There was Neville, hand in hand with a girl that Harry still didn’t recognize but must be his girlfriend, Clara or whatever her name was. He was standing in a crowd of Hufflepuffs that included Ernie, Hannah and Zacharias. Ernie’s arm was up in a sling, but he looked otherwise unhurt.
Draco checks his watch and, seeing that it is nearing opening time, squares his shoulders and makes his way to the front of the store. He peers gingerly through the front window. A small crowd has already formed outside. He looks around for Big Dick, but the manager is still safely ensconced in his office and Draco knows he will not emerge until the worst of the rush is over.
Ron wasn’t sure how the battle itself was going. He kept hearing booming noises from around the castle, but he wasn’t sure what they meant. For all he knew, they were Fred and George’s fireworks. He hoped that’s what he was hearing, but he was decently sure he’d heard the clatter of stones falling too, so it seemed more likely that someone was sending powerful spells into the walls.
“Oh,” Hermione said as they reached the marble staircase. “I forgot to ask Dumbledore about some sort of house neutral common area.”
“That sounds about right,” Draco said. He nuzzled Harry’s ear with his nose and then nibbled Harry’s earlobe. Harry melted back into Draco’s arms.
“Good, I brought sandwiches. I thought we could take a stroll down Diagon Alley.” This sound like a bit of an odd idea, so Draco immediately thinks there must be something else behind it.
“You can do it, Draco,” Harry said. He caught Draco’s eye and gave him an encouraging smile. Draco returned it and then squared his shoulders, turning to the shirt again.
Draco was rather taken aback with the ferocity with which Harry began to kiss him. It was as if suddenly the last few hours had not happened and they were back in the tunnel. Before he knew it, Harry’s hands were pushing him backwards on the bed and the brunet was straddling him, while simultaneously scrabbling at his shirt buttons.
Harry took a deep breath. He did not know how to explain what happed without actually explaining what happened.
“I know her from the Order meetings,” Blaise whispered back and it was all Hermione could do not to slap a hand to her forehead. Of course Blaise knew who Tonks was.
“As you may be aware,” Dumbledore said to the now silent hall. “We are in the midst of a war.” Whispering broke out amongst the students. “And I am aware, that some of your parents might be on the side of Lord Voldemort.” Someone shrieked at the sound of his name. “To those students: I encourage you to think about where your own allegiances lie. Do Voldemort’s beliefs match up with your own? Do you want to be ruled by a man who is quick to anger and slow to forgive? Or would you prefer it if his regime came to an end?” He paused and stared around at the students. They all stared back in rapt attention.
“Sometimes that counts as flirting,” he mumbles. He pulls his glass to himself and drains the last of his gin and tonic.
“But how?” he asked. He wasn’t asking Dumbledore, more just wondering aloud, but Dumbledore took it as a question.
“Well, it wasn’t funny,” Harry snaps. Draco hasn’t seen Harry this pissed off since Hogwarts, and part of him wants to keep pushing Harry’s buttons to see what happens.
“I guess,” he said. Something in his voice must have alerted Harry to the fact that he was now worried about that because Harry quickly apologized for bringing it up.
“Yes?” she asked. Blaise nudged Draco in the ribs and jerked his head towards the staircase to the dungeons and Ron had never felt so grateful to the man.
futures so that the brewers could work towards what they thought was the best one. It was created to help us decide how best to proceed, possibly with difficult decisions. ‘Is it a good idea if I take this job?’ for example.”
Dumbledore’s funeral had been held on the grounds of the school on the second to last weekend of term. Wizards and witches had poured into Hogsmeade village, to pay their last respects to Dumbledore. There had been so many that both the Three Broomsticks and the Hog’s Head had run out of rooms, which meant the countryside surrounding the village had been peppered with tents, making it feel to Harry more like the Quidditch World Cup than his headmaster’s funeral.
“Twenty four hours?” Potter nods. “What am I supposed to wear to bed? I’m in a bloody three piece suit.” Potter’s mouth twists to the side as he thinks.
“Not awkward,” she sad. “But we might fall behind in our timelines.” Her eyes sparkled as she smirked at him.
“Mother,” he says. “Father.” They look up, startled, but Narcissa recovers quickly and gets gracefully to her feet. She glides across the floor and embraces him.
“Uh, hi,” Pansy said. She had a confused look on her face. Harry beamed back at her. She was wearing a purple, scooped neck toga and had her hair up in a long pony tail down her back and Harry knew at a glance that she was Meg from Hercules.
A moment later, Draco hears the loud crack that indicates Potter has left and he lets out the breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He puts the toothbrush in his mouth and starts to brush his teeth.
“I said, when you were out of the room, he informed me that I was to get the Mark as soon as I turned seventeen.” Harry’s heart sank.
It’s a flimsy excuse, but Pansy’s had three drinks now and hate sex with Cormac McLaggen sounds oh so appealing. She’s seen him in the training facility and knows exactly what kind of irritatingly attractive physique is under those robes.
“Miss Granger.” Hermione squeaked in alarm when Narcissa said her name. She had been quite sure that Draco’s mother had no idea who she was. “It’s nice to see you again. I believe the last time we met was at the Quidditch World Cup.” Hermione relaxed and a tentative smile crossed her face.
“I should have come to help,” Hermione said, sitting up straighter. “I’m of age as well.” Pansy shrugged.
“No,” Harry says more slowly. “It really was all him. Draco deserves the credit. He knocked the man out. I just came along because I was curious as to where he was going.” Big Dick turns to Draco and instead of taking his hand, pulls him into a bone crushing hug.
He leans forward and plucks the wine glass out of Ron’s slack fingers and places it on the side table next to him. Then he tiptoes into the room where the others are still deep in discussion.
“That’s fair,” he says. “There is no reason to trust me. And I’m not quite sure how to gain your trust on this matter.”
Harry was glad that Snape could not hear his thoughts, but then froze when he remembered his Occlumency classes from the year before. He quickly thought about brick walls, just in case. Was he imagining it, or was Snape now scowling at him again? It was hard tell as Harry rarely saw Snape look at him with anything other than dislike. (That or he had resting bitch face - Harry wasn't sure.)
“This is fantastic,” Draco says, figuring he’ll start the conversation there. Potter looks up at him. He’s just shoved a forkful of spaghetti in his face and one long noodle hangs out of his mouth. He slurps it in, not caring that he splatters sauce all over his face. It takes some effort for Draco not to flinch at that. But then, Potter’s wearing his napkin like a child’s bib, so it doesn’t get on his clothes, only on his chin.
“Hello darling,” she says into his hair. He returns the hug quickly before letting go. Lucius stays where he is, but nods in Draco’s direction. And then they notice Potter. Draco can actually tell the moment that Lucius realizes there is another person there, as he stiffens slightly in surprise. Narcissa’s smile, which was already on her face, takes on more of a fixed look.
Eventually he settled on one of Dudley’s less unattractive shirts and a pair of jeans. Standing back in front of the mirror, he decided the shirt almost fit him. It would have to do though, as he didn’t really have much else. He’d never really needed any attractive clothing before and he’d already worn his good sweater on Tuesday for their Hogsmeade date, which meant he couldn't wear it again. Perhaps he could pick something up from the village this weekend when he and Ron inevitably went costume shopping there.
There was the sound of four bodies shifting in their beds. Then the sound of five bottles being uncorked and the sound of five boys chugging a thick liquid as quickly as they could. Then there were five satisfied ‘ahs’.
When the dessert appeared, Harry had to admit that it was beautiful. It was a white sphere, dusted with gold, sitting on a clean white plate. Harry picked up his dessert spoon and tapped the sphere. He managed to break through the white chocolate easily and soon was enjoying the chocolate mousse inside. Harry had to admit, that while he had laughed at the idea of the dessert, eating it was a delight. The mousse was light, but rich and the blackberries gave it lovely pops of brightness.
Harry feels both relieved and a little deflated as they are leaving. Relieved, of course, that Draco was skilled enough under veritaserum to lie about the full nature of their relationship, deflated that Hermione’d had the gall to ask about it. He knows it’s her job and that she just wants to keep them safe, but Harry is still upset that she doesn’t trust him.
He took a deep breath and looked over at the Slytherin table. Draco was staring down at the Prophet, a small frown on his face. That wasn’t much
Harry taps on the man’s shoulder and the whiskery kisses stop. The man turns around, keeping one arm wrapped around Draco’s waist.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said more loudly. Since he had started dating Potter, he felt like he had apologized for more things than he had in his entire life. And yet, it felt like the right thing to do. Even if it felt like he was going soft.
“I swear, I was just trying to keep our cover intact and not die. Massi said I was an enemy of the family and I panicked.”
“Where were you on Saturday night?” Harry was glad for the darkness as it hid the blush on his face.
“Wonderful,” Gillian says. There is a long pause where neither of them move and then Gillian prompts them again. “Now kiss, please.” Draco does not need telling twice. He closes the gap between them and presses his lips onto Harry’s. He is vaguely aware of more flashes going off, but he is too wrapped up in the kiss to notice.
Draco stares up at the Malfoy Manor gates. They are tall and imposing, made of wrought iron, with twin Ms at the top, painted in gold. He knows these gates well - how could he not? But standing outside of them with Potter makes them feel oddly imposing. He takes a deep breath, squares his shoulders and takes a step forward. He reaches out and pushes the closest gate. It opens at his touch, and he ushers Potter inside before following.
“Yeah, well, he’s still a bit of a git,” Ron said. Harry felt a flash of irritation go through him, but he tempered it down.
“So d’you think Harry’s going to ask you to move in with him?” Greg asks once Draco arrives at home. Harry had absconded to his old house after dropping Draco at his doorstep, claiming that he needed to pick up some clean clothes, and so Draco is alone with Greg.
If the teachers noticed half of the students becoming more and more boisterous as the evening went on, none of them said anything. In fact, Professor McGonagall even summoned a house elf part way through the first course and requested wine for the teachers.
The circle of people dissolved slowly back into dancing couples, but Ron and Pansy continued to dance, ignoring the others around them. Ron dipped Pansy backwards, her back arching over his arms, and then pulled her back up until they were face to face again. They paused there, both of them breathing hard, for half a second, before Ron closed the gap and kissed her.
“Wonderful,” Dumbledore said. “Now mingle while you enjoy some wonderful desserts!” He clapped his hands again and grinned around at them. As Harry watched, a mountain of cakes, cookies and ice creams seemed to rise out of the tables on the sides of the room. The younger years cheered and several of them made a beeline for the tables. The older students followed at a slower pace.
the interior designer?” Potter leans forward, his eyebrows raised. Merlin, the man really wears his emotions on his face. The look of surprise is almost comical.
“Fair point, Draco,” Blaise said. “Do we have any mixers?” Draco scrunched up his face. “Also glassware?”
“I have actually put them helpfully on a list,” McLaggen says. He searches through the pile of papers and pulls one out.
It is nearing the start of the Hogwarts school year, which means Luca and Joe have stepped up their planning for their book fort. Draco is now slightly concerned about it, as it has steadily grown in scope as the month of August has gone on. Draco wishes they would show this kind of enthusiasm when planning book promotions, but knowing them, they would promote books about psychedelic plants or something similarly inappropriate.
Loathe as Harry is to admit that Draco is right about anything, he starts to find himself having fun.
“Brilliant.” Ron grabbed one of the brooms they had been planning to bring to the hump back witch’s statue and jumped on it. “Be right back.” And he zoomed out of the room. Draco frowned and gnawed on his lower lip. After a moment he began tapping his foot in irritation, staring at his pocket watch. Harry walked over to him and put a hand on his shoulder.
how he pushed everyone away as opposed to letting them help him. She knows why he did it, of course. It is part of the reason she doesn’t think he is the right person to be the living incarnation of The Reliquary. At the end of the day, he had balked at killing Dumbledore, or so she had heard. If she is being fair, which isn’t often, she knows she would have done the same thing in his place. She, too, had been a coward at the age of seventeen. She knows she wouldn’t have helped him back then, even if he had asked her to. But Pansy knows a lot can change in ten years. Perhaps she is being too hard on Draco. Either way, she needs to stop stalling and call this in.
Jamie sulks in the corner while Big Dick gushes praise over Draco. He all but storms out of the store when Big Dick decides there and then to make Draco the assistant manager, tapping Draco’s work robes with his wand to add the managerial gold piping to the sleeves.
“As touching as this is,” Voldemort said, cutting into Harry’s thoughts. “I think it’s about time I ended you once and for all.”
They froze, Harry’s face inches from Draco’s. Harry hardly dared to breathe as a pair of feet appeared at the top of the stairs.
“After Dumbledore died,” Potter prompts. Draco is relieved that there is no malice in Potter’s tone.
“Fair point.” Draco put the book back into the box. “What do you think I should do with it?” Greg shrugs.
“Right, then that decides it,” Potter says. “I will escort Malfoy back to his house. Parkinson, we’ll meet you at the external entrance to the ministry once you’ve showered and changed.” Pansy nods once and then shoves altogether too much toast into her mouth before she shoves her chair back from the table and stands. She gives them both a small wave and then walks over to the fireplace behind Draco. She grabs a handful of Floo powder from where it sits on the mantlepiece and drops it into the grate. A green fire flares up, and she steps into it, saying her address so quietly that Draco can’t catch it, even though he is only a few feet away.
Finally, after what feels like an age, but is really only five minutes, they hear footsteps in the hallway. Draco turns around expectantly and watches as a woman in a Hit Wizard uniform marches towards them. She has so many stars above her crossed wand seal, that even Draco knows she is important. A small name tag identifies her as the Dempsey that Pansy had mentioned.
It’s been perhaps five years since Draco’s seen Potter in person. The last time had been at the conclusion to the Malfoy family hearings, when Draco had been acquitted for the reluctant part that he’d played in the war.
“And on that note,” Draco adds. “How will this whole thing work? Does the Ministry pay for our cover dates?”
“Before you go,” Dempsey cuts in. “You will need to stop by my office to get your security credentials.” She addresses Pansy. “Banks can help you with that.” Pansy nods and leads them out of the office. Once they are out of earshot, she says,
“So Draco has what? Been sleeping in another dorm?” Blaise kept his face impassive and Pansy, following his lead, lifted her head up and did the same. After a long moment, Narcissa rolled her eyes and shook her head. “Well,” she said. “I just hope you’re all being
“Mm, yes, I did notice that there had been quite a large contingent of people on the dance floor in there. Somehow I didn’t want to join them.”
“I accomplished what I set out to do,” Harry replied. He lifted his free hand to touch the now gently bruised spot on Draco's neck. His other hand stayed put on Draco's hip. Draco slapped a hand over the spot.
“We could send it by owl?” Draco shook his head. “Or we could run it outside of the house grounds and try the portkey again?”
“Great.” Potter pushes off of the doorframe and slopes down the corridor. Draco watches him leave, unsure if he should follow or not. He dithers for a long moment, looking again at the pile of clothes that Draco doesn’t think has gotten any smaller even though he’s hung up almost thirty things by now, before following Potter down the stairs.
He was lying on his back, of that he was sure. Or, pretty sure. Which meant he could feel things. Like the fact that he was naked. He blinked and turned his head from side to side. He appeared to be alone. He sat up slowly and took in his surroundings. It was a lot of white nothingness.
“Good, now let’s patch up the rest of you.” She pulled out her wand and began to heal his various bruises, cuts and scratches. Once she was finished with Harry, she turned her attention to Draco, who did not have nearly so many bruises. When she was done, she stepped back and looked at the pair of them, with her hands on her hips.
This room is wreathed in fog and fake ghouls float around at head height, occasionally bumping into the walls and each other. Pansy and Greg weave their way through the ghouls to an empty corner and then, once they are sure they haven’t been followed, they burst into laughter. The fog dampens the noise.
“I never intended for you to do it, Draco,” Snape said. “I was going to step in before you did anything serious.”
“Ha, fucking. Diagrams. Diagrams about fucking.” Harry hadn’t thought he could laugh any harder, but he was mistaken. He was laughing so hard it was getting difficult to breathe. He put an arm out and steadied himself on Draco’s shoulder, gasping for air in between each guffaw.
“Neville?” Seamus asked. “Partner?” Neville seemed surprised that anyone had asked him and so quickly agreed. His confidence in potions had grown since his Ehwaz potion had turned out so well.
“Yes, but I’m no good with architectural magic. In case you couldn’t tell, my house is exactly as I bought it, because I don’t trust myself to add anything in case it collapses in the middle of the night.”
“Of course,” Pansy blusters. “I’ll let you take lead on that for now. In the meantime, I’m going to start putting together an evidence board.”
“May I cut in?” he asked. And was it his imagination, or did Claudia’s eyes light up at his question?
“Well maybe I made a mistake,” Draco said. He looked down at his feet, unable to look Harry in the eye any more.
worst. She shifts slightly in her seat until she’s not quite as close to him and raises her glass to her lips.
“True, but I wouldn’t say you’re useless. You have your skills.” Draco reached out and put a hand on Harry’s thigh.
“I’m not an emotional support puppy, Potter.” Harry’s eyes widen in surprise and then he gives a short bark of laughter. Draco rolls his eyes.
“Is that because you want to go around the party asking everyone if you make them horny?” Hermione asked. For a second she looked very serious, but then a small smile crossed her lips.
“Shall we?” he asks. Harry nods and Draco drops the powder. “34 Sorella Gardens,” he cries, loud enough that Harry can hear him, even though Harry already knows the address. As the green flames rise up to engulf Malfoy, Harry makes a split second decision and dives into the fireplace with the blond, clutching at his waist and tugging him close. He feels Draco grab him back as they hurtle through the network, fireplaces and sitting rooms flashing past them, until the spinning stops and they stumble out into Draco’s living room.
“I can probably duck out a few minutes early,” he says. “My main responsibility for the day is to train Pansy, but I haven’t seen much of her, and she seems perfectly capable of selling books and stocking shelves.”
. During which Harry’s going to get down on his knees and - Draco stops the thought right there. He’s nervous enough without the promise of sexual gratification. Why did he agree to Potter giving him a blowjob in the first place? Merlin, he feels like a third year Hufflepuff going to the Yule Ball.
“Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck,” Draco repeated under his breath as he began to pace around the room. Harry wracked his brain for a solution, but nothing came. He wished he knew why the portkey hadn’t worked - then perhaps they could fix it. He walked over to the Cup and knelt down next to it. After staring at it for a long moment, he reached out and picked up the ring box. He turned it over in his hands, staring at it. But like every other portkey Harry had ever seen, it looked like an ordinary ring box.
“Draco,” she said. “I’m so glad you were early. It means that I have time to give you your Christmas presents before the guests arrive.”
“That was not what I meant,” he snapped. “Can you give me some privacy please? I'm not quite ready for you to see me without a shirt.” Draco slapped a hand to his forehead.
Harry doesn’t know why they have to wait outside. It’s December. In Scotland. And it’s bloody freezing. He wishes Draco hadn’t taken his scarf. He would be a lot warmer if he were still wearing it. Of course, he would be much warmer if he were just inside the house.
“Of course,” Potter says. “All night.” At this, he winks and Draco feels the color rise in his face.
” The Riddle-Harry’s eyes flashed a brighter red for a moment and he tossed his hair, looking more bewitching and also more cruel than the real Harry ever had.
Images of McLaggen trying to figure out where the Reliquary has gone, because it didn’t end up in the safe house where Wood was supposed to go. Thoughts of “It must be with Potter.” A long stretch of McLaggen following Harry’s movements in his spare time. McLaggen asking Dempsey about the Reliquary investigation and getting nothing. McLaggen reporting back to his mysterious, hooded counterparts (why do all secret groups have to wear hooded cloaks?) that he doesn’t know where the Reliquary is and he’s sorry, but he’s still working to make sure that the Simurgh Society can't do anything. A long memory of the night McLaggen brought Harry and Draco in for questioning. The bodies on the floor. Blood everywhere. McLaggen questioning Draco.
