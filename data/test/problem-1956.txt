“But I’m listening,” Malfoy continued. “Alright?”
– how dare you – ”
he adds silently in his mind.
Harry clears his throat. “Everyone be quiet. Class has begun now.”
It was Remus who introduced him to reading. Harry thinks it wasn’t Narcissa or Lucius who introduced Malfoy. He thinks Malfoy introduced himself. It’s a strange thought, a young, hungry, lonely Malfoy absorbing himself in words upon words upon words.
They fought that whole year – when Malfoy would say something bigoted or insulting, when Harry would make a pointed remark about Slytherins or Snape. They fought over anything and over everything, but Malfoy kept sitting next to him in Potions, and Harry kept letting him.
────────────────────
?” sputters Harry, but Ginny is already dancing off, and Malfoy is waiting at the door of the pub, tapping his foot and scowling. Harry trudges over reluctantly.
“It was reasonable,” Pansy agreed.
“No,” said Malfoy, and he almost looked like he wanted to laugh. “I’ve been waiting for you to ask Goldstein to switch with you or complain to McGonagall and tell her this was a horrible idea for the past week. I’ve been trying to make sure you wouldn’t have any reason to. I’ve been positively
He wasn’t worried about losing Ron and Hermione. Or, maybe he was a little. He just didn’t like that feeling that he was a hanger-on, unnecessary to their dynamic. And also, even though there was not a lot of privacy in a tent or the Burrow and he had basically seen it all, he wasn’t interested in watching them make out.
Other than that one look over at the Slytherin table, he didn’t look at Malfoy again, until all of the returning seventh years, or eighth years, he supposed, were gathered up awkwardly to follow Professor McGonagall to their dormitory.
“Draco had his heart set on staying in Britain,” Zabini said. “Oh, Narcissa tried to convince him, once
on the list.
Parvati, Padma, and Susan looked bizarrely intrigued and puzzled. Zabini looked completely unsurprised and a bit resigned.
“I knew he was doing evil,” Harry said. “That’s why. I was stalking in the name of good.” That didn’t sound right. “I was right, anyway.”
“Thanks, Hermione,” Harry says, and he stands up too. “I don’t know what I’d do without you. Do I need to come to the Ministry and give some of them a piece of my mind?”
It took Harry another moment to get it, and then he was grinning. “Oh.”
to let go? But what if he lets go and it seems awkward?
“Rafael,” Malfoy says, shaking his head and giving Harry a weirded out look. “He’s very famous.”
Malfoy doesn’t reply; he continues writing a scathing article on the Ministry.
“Merlin, of
with a smiley face at the end. Harry can understand what all those fans see in him. Rafael doesn’t mention their sleeping together, most likely because of Malfoy, and Harry is glad for it, because he really doesn’t remember much about it. Those days, he had been living for how he felt in the air: untouchable, sweat clinging to his collarbone, exhilarated, free. How he had been able to forget, for a minute, all that had happened. But he couldn’t have forgotten forever. Hermione and Ron and Sirius and Remus hadn’t begrudged him his time away. They’d known he’d needed it. Malfoy had been angry, and Harry knew why – because he had not taken Malfoy with him when he went to search for Horcruxes and then he had abandoned Malfoy again. Malfoy had been angry because he had needed to leave, too. It was a question Malfoy had left unspoken between them –
Luna came over to sit next to them. She didn’t look surprised to see Malfoy, who turned ashen at the very sight of her.
“Er, okay,” Harry said. “Blaise. Can we get some breakfast now? I’m really hungry.”
with Harry, Harry had dragged him into this, he was
“And,” Malfoy went on, in hysterics, “you have some sort of problem with me being a good roommate. What exactly in your opinion should I do instead?”
“Sorry,” he said again, and Harry kissed him.
“I’ll meet you inside, then, Harry,” Ron said loudly.
“What do you mean you’re staying?” Harry said, staring at him.
still written upon it. He let his head rest against it, briefly, and felt ridiculous, but he said, “Thanks.”
“Okay?”
Harry was startled into laughing and saying, “What?” He could easily have stayed behind when Malfoy opened the door and stepped outside. He could have asked Neville, Dean, or Seamus to cast a healing spell on him; they’d all had to learn them in the war. He could knock on Ron’s door. He could sleep it off, because he was used to sleeping with pain, and this honestly didn’t even hurt that much. He followed Malfoy instead.
Ron came back with the drinks and said, “Are we at five-pint sappy Harry and Hermione now? I’ve only just got the drinks!”
They did look just like Harry’s glasses, even if they were strange on Malfoy’s face. McGonagall would have been proud of the Transfiguration, if not the drinking.
Harry stares at him. “What?”
“Sixth year, and all the years before,” Hermione said, with a glance at Ron. “We’d been ready for the possibility that your Malfoy obsession would come back, this year. I even thought it would be a good thing! Help you feel a little more like yourself, you know.”
“I wasn’t trying to be nice then. I called you an idiot. I
Harry gives Malfoy a surprised, pleased look. Malfoy gives him the same look back.
“You were right just once,” said Harry, and let himself relax into Malfoy’s touch. As soon as he did, Malfoy leaped away and looked strange for a moment. Next moment he was perfectly normal again, and they went to have dinner in the kitchen before making their way to separate rooms.
“If not we’re going to do it anyway,” Zabini drawled out. He was leaning against the doorway, naturally, because he was an enormous pillock.
Harry laughed.
Harry makes his way, finally, to Malfoy’s coffee shop, and the flat above. He stares at it for a while. His home. Or – Malfoy’s home, technically, but it had been a long time since anyone had referred to it as that. It was their home now.
“Sugar pie!” calls Malfoy sweetly, advancing towards Harry’s desk.
Harry ignored him. He let his breathing even out, head resting against the seat of the settee with his legs spread out, and the sound below of the wind, the sound next to him of Malfoy’s breathing. He thought he should feel weird. He should go into his perfectly comfortable bed, which was a small distance away. He should tell Malfoy to move. He shouldn’t be able to sleep with Malfoy next to him. But then he felt Malfoy breathe in, and lie down opposite Harry so that his head rested beside Harry’s and his legs curled up on the rest of the sette. He felt Malfoy touch his hair, gently, hesitantly; it might have been a dream, but by then he’d already fallen asleep, Malfoy’s fine hair falling on his face, even though there wasn’t enough space for both of them, really.
,” Hermione says.
Harry followed him down to where the rest of their year was chattering and laughing. Ron and Hermione, mercifully, didn’t say they’d told him so, but smiled instead. He let everyone make the teams with his arms around Malfoy’s neck, while Ginny pretended to gag and Daphne made fun of them. The only thing he was firm on was that he and Malfoy be Seekers.
“Ugh, you know what I mean,” said Harry, shoving his shoulder.
Malfoy looks away. “Maybe we should call each other by our first names,” he suggests, sounding a bit more normal, but there’s a bitter twist to his mouth.
If his stomach kept twisting and if he thought about pulling Malfoy in by the front of his robes, no one noticed.
– but he couldn’t let himself believe that.
“Am I not attractive, or something?” demanded Ron. “Why have you never had a crush on me, Harry?”
“You’re going to get a cold and I will mock you mercilessly,” Malfoy informed him.
Harry frowned, staring blearily at the ground. “Why would we go to Madam Pomfrey?”
Neville pushes his hair out of his eyes. “Hey, Harry. I was walking by, and I haven’t got a class – I just came by to say congratulations.”
Harry thought about Malfoy saying,
“No,” Harry replies. “I want to live with you for the rest of my life.”
“You. Didn’t talk about it.” Hermione stares at him. “Ever? Harry, you’ve been living with Malfoy for three years and you’ve been friends with him for eight and you’ve never talked to him about your shared moment of passion?”
“The feeling’s mutual,” Harry told him, and he was being perfectly honest.
“I’d rather stay, too,” Parvati agreed, looking at Daphne Greengrass, who was writing an essay and checking it against
discovery for historians, but anyways, I’ve got a transcript in the book somewhere, someone tried to translate the language and put it in more modern words...there. Isolda’s the daughter.”
“I was all for it,” Zabini drawled, raising an eyebrow at Malfoy and leaning against the doorway. Harry wondered if he was allergic to standing up without anything to recline on.
It wasn’t a bad idea. He thought everyone deserved a bit of a break.
stalked anyone!” Harry protested vehemently at this gross slander. “Especially not Malfoy, I – he was doing evil things! I had to stop him!”
There had been blood everywhere, and Moaning Myrtle had been shouting, and Snape was screaming at him to

Harry caught his wrist. “Everyone’s too drunk to care, Malfoy.”

“Alright.”
than concussions.” He thought about the wisdom or lack thereof in saying Death Eaters in front of Malfoy, whose shoulders tensed for a moment. He added, “And Madam Pomfrey is probably asleep now.”
“I didn’t – ”
, Harry thought, over and over again while Flitwick was talking. Malfoy was writing notes, but his foot kept coming up against Harry’s under the table and even if Harry had been trying to concentrate, he wouldn’t have been able to.
“What does
Malfoy says, “Weasley’s your best friend.”
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Malfoy breathed, clutching at the bottle and downing all of it in one gulp. When he finished he made a face and shook his head, like a cat shaking off water. Harry watched him and tried not to smile.
He supposed Hermione or Hagrid would have said
When he put it like
Harry suffered through an awkward meeting with Narcissa, and now it’s Malfoy’s turn, so he ignores Malfoy’s grumbling and sets off for Sirius and Remus’s place.
Uh oh
“Yeah, okay, I paid attention.”  Harry looked a little sheepish, though he kept going.  “I still don’t feel like I was obsessed.”
I came to with my foot chained to a floor.  The room was dark, but I could just make out the outline of a bed against the wall.  My head and my heart were pounding.  I could feel rage through my bond.   I sat on the edge of the bed for a moment, focusing on letting my mate feel that I was still okay.  The creek of the door opening was loud to my ears.  The other’s breathing sounded ragged and sad.  I could smell him now and while he had not presented when I last saw him I knew it was Ron.  That explained why the scent seemed familiar earlier.  He opened a curtain that had been out of my reach, letting in enough light to see the room.  Ron then sat in an empty chair that had been sitting by the door.  “I’m sorry, but I had to.  You are a creature Harry.  Inhuman.  My mother has already been paid for an unbonded omega.  They are coming to get you after we leave."  He was an alpha, but all I could smell on him now was his nervousness.  An acidic scent that made my eyes water.
“No Ronald, so, Harry has been gone for three weeks, but he was not alone.  He has been in a relationship for a few years.”  She took a breath in and let it out slowly.
“Thank you, Granger.  I know this is a bit of a shock.”  He wrapped his arms around his husband’s shoulders.
“Not really, but alphas around unmated omegas are always difficult to handle, an unmated veela could  hurt someone they deem unworthy to mate.  Even worse, if the dreamed of mate sees it, there is a good chance of a fight.  Nothing was likely to happen, they were like your family.  I doubt you’d have even gotten any alpha vibes towards them, but she is still afraid.  Honestly, I am more worried for your safety.  An unmated male omega to the wrong alpha could be seen as easy prey, that will be worse when actually in heat or if the alpha is in rut though.”
We walked out into the living room.  I could feel Draco’s arm firmly around my waist.  Remus and Sirius were in the kitchen cooking. The smell of garlic from the kitchen was mouthwatering.  Remus was next to the stove while Sirius chopped onions.  I coughed once to let them know we were there.  “How was your trip dads?”
“Okay, not visiting my
Things were easier between them after Draco’s disastrous night out. He had more time on his hands now that he wasn’t working and he tried to spend as much of it as he could with Scorpius and Andromeda. He could be imagining it, but it seemed like Harry was over at her place a lot more than he previously had, and Draco couldn’t stop the warmth he felt spreading through his body every time he met him even if he wanted to. It was nice to have Harry direct those smiles towards him that he had seen him giving Scorpius and Andromeda in the past, and it was easy to fall into a routine where drinking tea together felt safe and something Draco looked forward to. He noticed that they seemed to gravitate towards each other in a way they hadn’t before, and after a couple of weeks, even Andromeda gave Draco smug looks whenever she saw how close they were sitting together. Draco shrugged, but his warm cheeks probably betrayed how he really felt about it. He was still being careful though, even though Ron had flat out said that Harry had wanted to ask him out, he didn’t want to get his hopes up. If he was wrong it could risk a friendship he had wanted for a bigger part of his life, so he took what he could get and it felt like a really good start.
Draco cut her off. “No!” He shook his head. “No, there’s no need for that. I’ll just go over in person and ask again. Maybe I can explain the situation better and they listen to me.”
They had just spent another dinner his mother hadn't attended when Draco asked one of the elves to take a plate up to her room. The elf started to fiddle and look everywhere else than on Draco.
Draco nodded while Scorpius hugged him from behind, his tiny hands clasping over Draco’s stomach. “I’m going to go to St Mungo’s and bring grandma home, okay?” he whispered while he turned around and gathered Scorpius in a proper hug. “Will you be okay with Nimly while I’m away or do you want me to call Andromeda?”
Potter scribbled something down on a paper. “We won’t be able to stop your hallucinations completely, but as long as they’re not hostile or you feel uncomfortable by them they’re harmless.” He turned to Draco before continuing. “You don’t have to correct your mother’s visions when she tells you about them. As I said, as long as they’re not violent or scary there’s no harm in her believing that they’re real.”
Draco took his tea in silence. He had a hard time not looking at Potter who was seated right in front of him as he laughed and talked to Scorpius. His comment had really disturbed Draco. He thought that they had a mutual understanding of some sort. They didn’t like each other, sure, but to realise that Potter still thought of him as some bigot really hurt. He had done everything to change himself to be a better person after the war, after starting his family, but maybe that wasn’t enough. Even if he knew that the public’s opinion of him didn’t matter in the long run, that the most important part was that he
“I’m sorry, sir. We only have one room under the names Potter and Malfoy. The reservations were made by Mr. Blaise Zabini. He left a note addressed to you, Mr. Malfoy.” She handed Draco a note.
“Shh! Keep your voice down,” Harry hissed. “No need to be a prat about it.”
”Do you?” Harry said, more to his drink than to Draco.
”It most certainly will not! We’ll kill each other.”
He hadn’t been standing in the kitchen for too long when Harry came in. He opened his mouth to start his apology when Harry beat him to it.
“You like me? But you don’t talk to me. You don’t even know me!” Malfoy huffed out.
“I could talk to the potion masters at St Mungo’s,” Harry said, coming after him.
“You want to get to know me?”
Draco was too angry to focus on Mr Finley right now, he was more upset about being called out by his father, knowing that everything he said about Draco was right.
“Of course she did,” Draco said under his breath and turned around so he didn’t have to look at Harry’s legs anymore. Or at his bulge anymore, because there was definitely a clear outline of Harry’s private parts through his trousers. This was going to be a hard couple of days for Draco if he was spending so much time in close proximity to Harry’s private parts. Or Harry in general.
Draco kept the pace slow, waiting for directions. He wanted to give Harry anything he wished for.
Draco tried to lighten the mood. “I guess I’ll see you tonight, then?”
Draco swallowed, “The Ministry?” he asked, while slowly walking backwards to the door, not wanting to leave in the slightest. He knew that it was a shitty job, but at least it had been his, and now he’d ruined everything just to make up for something he already thought he’d made his peace with.
“Potter.” Draco nodded towards him, where he was standing on the path up to Andromeda’s house.
“I’m not being a prat your obnoxious git! How is it that you manage to save the whole fucking world but not manage to avoid trying to off yourself every night?” Malfoy wheezed out through gritted teeth.
Somewhere in his mind he knew that it was wrong to harbor those feelings for Malfoy. Even though he’d changed now, he’d still been behaving like a major prick towards Harry and his friends for such a long time, it was hard to just forget about it. But somehow Harry managed to forget about it every night when his hand sneaked under his pants picturing it was Malfoy’s hand instead.
“I need to speak to the Minister, please behave while I’m gone.”
“And why did you change your mind?” Harry asked.
“Good morning, officers. What can I do for you this time?”
“Listen, when you’re done we should meet up for a pint. I owe you one,” Ron smiled at him.
“I’ve tried that, it doesn’t work. I don’t know how I do it, I’m not even carrying my wand and still manage to take down every spell and walk out of my room every night,” he said, slumping down on the sofa next to a standing Malfoy.
There was a tap at the window, a grey barn owl looked at him with curious eyes. He didn’t recognise it, but that was no surprise. He opened the window to let the bird in, but it only dropped the letter it was holding and took off. He opened the letter, half expecting it to be from the memory healer, but it wasn’t.
“I really want to forget it so I won't mention it again,” Draco smiled. He went into the fireplace, but before he said Andromeda’s address he turned his head again. “And Harry?”
back,” he winked at Draco. The nickname felt more teasing now, and even more familiar than mate did. “Come in, I'll buy you a pint.”
“What are you doing here?” Potter blurted.
Potter nodded, and they were left standing looking at each other. “Michael Corner?” Potter suddenly blurted out.
“Oh! Draco! You’re awake. I was so worried!” Potter stood up and bent down to give Draco a kiss.
Potter stood and went to grab some books and pamphlets from a shelf in his room, handing them out to the three of them. Andromeda put hers and Narcissa’s away in her purse, while Draco looked through them, not really getting what he was looking at.
. And here he’d been dismissive towards Harry for months, claiming he knew how Harry felt about him when he clearly had it the wrong way. Draco tried to cover up more of his face in shame. Harry thought that Draco hated him? Draco didn’t hate Harry, how could he? It wasn’t possible to hate Harry with his perfect... his perfect everything.
“You know very well that I have no say in what name the Department of Alias comes up with, just go with it and stop making a fool of yourself.” Harry undid the spell, looking around to see if anyone was keeping an eye on them, but further down the aisle a baby was screaming, so no one seemed to have noticed anything odd. Draco slumped even further down his seat, staring at the back of the chair before him.
Harry put down his mug. “I was just wondering what your plans were, Draco.”
“Well?” Hermione pried.
“Come, Harry! Do it! I want to feel you.” Draco slammed in harder, still stroking Harry as well as he could manage. Hot liquid started to spill over Draco’s knuckles, and Harry clenched down hard as he came, making guttural sounds that Draco knew he would do anything to hear again. With one final push, Draco was coming as well, plastering himself over Harry’s back. Draco kept his hand on Harry’s cock as he spurted inside him, breathing hard into Harry’s neck. A hiss from Harry made him let go of his cock, and he started to pull out.
“Enough! Go and flirt somewhere else!” he hissed, hoping Potter wouldn’t hear him.
It wasn’t before he was home again that he realised that Potter had called him Draco.
He sighed as he went around the counter, looking through their transaction papers. Name after name of purebloods he knew from briefly meeting them while he was younger, who all gave him a fake smile when they came by and collected their packages from Mr Finley. Draco always gave them a polite smile and wished them a pleasant day, while silently judging himself for not taking a bigger stand against them. A coward, that’s what he has been for a long time in his life. A coward during his younger years, hiding behind his father, a coward at the beginning of the war, a coward after the war, pushing away the help that was offered, and a coward now, running away from his mother’s disease and his stupid feelings towards Potter.
“Narcissa?” Harry asked, against Draco’s head.
“Zabini? Zabini is your brilliant idea how we’ll solve this?” Harry asked Draco with a frown. “No offence, Zabini!”
Ron dragged Draco towards him in a clumsy hug that Draco tried to return, but his thoughts were stuck on the words
“No. They’ve taken my mother and she should be at home.” He went to the other door and started knocking on that one instead.
“Well, you’re here fairly often, are you not?” Draco said with a teasing smile.
“He thinks that you don’t like him,” Ron shrugged. “You never talk to him when you see each other, and he says that you make it rather clear you don’t want to spend time with him. You even rejected him after Hermione’s party when he wanted to ask you out, he told me about it after you went home.”
Harry looked serious again. “I couldn’t help myself. I’ve been meaning to ask you out for a long time.”
“I’ll think of something,” Draco murmured.
“What fairies? We don’t have any fairies in the garden,” Draco said, gently stroking Scorpius' hair.
-Sara Zarr
He knew his boss was dealing with something that wasn’t quite on the legal side of things, but he didn’t know what, and Mr Finley was a master at hiding his inventory and himself whenever the Aurors came around. Even if he wasn’t the greatest boss, at least he didn’t put Draco in a difficult spot more than necessary.
When he approached them he could hear Scorpius’ tired voice, “I can’t see them Grandma. You said they were here.”
Draco shook his head vehemently but regretted it as soon as he felt the need to be sick.
Draco always got a funny feeling after seeing Potter. He was mature enough to admit that Potter was attractive, always had been if his Hogwarts fantasies were anything to go by. But now, not only was Potter attractive, but he also seemed like a really good man. A good friend, if he listened to what Ron was talking about while he and his colleagues searched the store, a brilliant godfather according to Teddy, a man very good at his job as a healer a proud Andromeda told him again and again and even Scorpius sang his praises after spending time with him. Though Draco never got to experience any of this first hand, he had grown quite fond of Potter, but since he knew that Potter couldn’t stand him, he tried his very best to keep his distance. Maybe it was for the best that he quit his apprenticeship so that he didn’t run into Potter at St Mungo’s all the time. He could only stare so much before it became pathetic. So, any warm feelings towards him, he kept shoving down, hoping they wouldn’t explode in his face one day.
Draco hadn’t bothered with a coat so he went directly into the living room and sunk down on the sofa, while Harry made them tea in the kitchen.
Malfoy deadpanned, “I didn’t want you dead before Potter and I certainly don’t want you dead now. Are you saying that you thought I was lounging around that couch every night out of coincidence? Are you that stupid?”
Hermione snorted. “You mentioned work already, Harry. Maybe you’ve had enough to drink for tonight?”
“Oh!” Draco couldn’t hide his blush, so he looked at Scorpius to shy away from Potter’s gaze. “Well then, I don’t know the voices so perhaps Harry can continue reading? If you ask politely.”
noticed.”
He stumbled out of the hearth, falling down on his knees and tried to hold his breath till the nausea subsided.
Draco deepened the kiss and was awarded with Potter’s hands on his hips, tugging him closer. He put one of his hands in Potter’s hair, the other one clutching his jaw. He broke the kiss to look at Potter. “You want this?” he asked.
Harry was already back when Draco arrived at the hotel. All his stuff was packed and he sat on the sofa, staring into space. Draco didn’t know what to say so he only nodded at Harry and went and gathered his things. When he was done, he sat down on the bed and cleared his throat. “Portkey leaves in five minutes.”
“Huh,” Harry said again. “I’m in love with Draco Malfoy?” he asked out loud, mostly to himself, but Ron answered anyway.
Draco looked down, but he felt kind of grateful that Harry didn’t offer any more consolation than that, he was probably not in the right headspace to accept it anyway.
”So when you danced on the table at Blaise and Neville’s party, that was you being sophisticated?” Harry said with a badly concealed grin.
Harry clearly took it as an invitation, because he dragged Draco towards him again and kissed him more firmly. The intensity of the kiss made Draco gasp and part his lips. The heat pooling in his stomach made it harder to breathe. He tried to get closer to taste more of Harry’s mouth, but they were both in awkward positions because of the chairs, so Draco had to draw back again. They were both panting, looking at each other. Harry licked his lips and Draco couldn’t help but trace his fingers lightly over them, smiling when Harry’s breath hitched.
“It was, but still, you’re out of a job and I was there being all happy that we finally got something on that bastard.”
Which friends and family, Draco thought, throwing the pamphlet in the bin.
“You didn’t. I’m sorry, Potter, I — ”
“Draco, listen to me. She’s not here.” Harry tried to steer him away from the door.
“They’re here, my love,” his mother answered.
Harry let the tip of his cock grace Draco’s hole before he slowly pushed the head in and stopped. He could hear Harry hold his breath when Draco clenched at the intrusion, but then on a loud exhale, Harry slid in, inch by inch into Draco’s body, draping himself over Draco’s back as he bottomed out. They stopped for a minute and Draco savoured the feeling of being so full that he could hardly breathe. Harry slowly pushed himself off Draco while he pulled out almost entirely, then he pushed back infuriatingly slow again. Draco tried to pick up the pace, only to notice that Harry had stopped while Draco was fucking himself on Harry’s cock over and over again. He pulled himself up on his hands, still not stopping because it felt too good. “Why did you stop?” he managed to pant out.
Once I introduced her to my fathers I did get a bit of a shock.  It turns out that not only did they know her in school, Sirius was a cousin of hers before he left his family.  Such a small world sometimes I guess.  We all had polite conversation over dinner, all trying to stay away from the topic of the kidnapping. Eventually she asked me how I came to be living with them.  Honestly, I had not even really explained it all to Draco yet. Just bits and pieces during our dates.  I allowed Sirius and Remus to explain about the Dursley’s.  They hinted at the abuse, but Mrs. Malfoy did not ask for specifics.  I just kept my eyes on the hand held in mine as the conversation continued.  That period of my life still causes flashbacks at times and I did not really want one to happen during this important family meeting.  She was saddened by my past, but wanted to assure me that I would have many good times to look forward to. “You even have the ability to grow more family now.”  I saw Draco whisper something in her ear, but she just laughed and shrugged it off.  “I eventually would like to see grand babies.  Is that so wrong?”
The lack of sleep made Draco unfocused, and he was late with several reports, which made Shacklebolt order him to stay until he was done. Dora also stayed late, talking Draco’s ears off with how hot Blaise was, and she didn’t leave until Draco promised to put in a good word for her. Shacklebolt left shortly after, making Draco the last person on their floor.
Later, just when Draco was about to go to bed, his fireplace roared to life. A giggling Pansy showed her face, looking a bit tipsy.
“Sometimes you have to know when it’s time to stop trying to fix something that can’t be fixed,” Potter said, squeezing Draco’s shoulder.
“You spoil me,” Draco said as he rose from the bed, wincing a little when come started to trickle down the back of his leg.
Draco thought that those words would mend something in him, instead, he felt a wave of sadness wash over him. “Why didn’t you say something?” He took back his hand from Harry’s hold.
“Let’s go for a walk, shall we? Draco said, a little more gently, just to get the smile back on Harry’s face.
“You only said the truth, and that’s all I ask for. I reacted badly, I shouldn’t have stormed out of your office like that, and I’m sorry for the chair.”
“Oh, how lovely,” Andromeda said, not sounding so sincere to Draco’s ears. “How is my sister? I talked to her the other day but she seemed very distracted. Is something bothering her?”
“I wouldn’t have laughed,” Harry whispered.
Harry winked back. “You like it.”
Harry looked at him like he was stupid. “What gave it away? Me asking you or...?”
Draco pushed the chair closer, so he could put kisses on Harry’s lower back, still keeping his fingers in him. He let his tongue wander down his crack, licking around his fingers.
They had been in St Mungo’s for over three hours now. Potter had run several diagnostics spells, making Narcissa do different tests that Draco couldn’t grasp the meaning of. What the point was to draw a clock with the minute hands showing different times, Draco couldn’t fathom, but he could feel his gut clench with worry when his mother couldn’t draw what Potter and the nurses told her to. After the tests were done, Potter talked with Narcissa alone, then he talked to Draco and he tried to explain everything that he had noticed being off with his mother. They were all exhausted by the time Potter called all three of them back in.
Harry’s stomach squirmed unpleasantly, but Luna struck up a conversation about the newest issue of the
“No fucking,” snaps Malfoy, and suddenly it’s not very funny at all. Harry swallows. “No going out with other people.”
He heard the familiar murmur of Ron and Hermione bickering and then falling silent, settling themselves down on either side of him. He wasn’t surprised they’d come, but he was hopelessly relieved. They were the only people he trusted himself to be able to be around right now.
Ron looked at him like he was crazy. “It’s past noon, mate. Everyone’s having lunch.”
“I was a special child.”
“Just take it back,” Malfoy said, words stumbling out of him in a rush. “Take it back, and it’ll be alright. You didn’t mean it.”
he will.”
“Don’t you know?”
“Er,” he said, and Malfoy said, “Hello,” and they both looked determinedly at the floor.
Malfoy grabbed a glass of Butterbeer and started to drink. Harry cursed the Hogwarts rumour mill and said, “Well, it isn’t me that Dean likes, if he likes anyone.”
Malfoy tugged down his sleeve and his shirt shifted down, and Harry saw the first white scar, stark against his skin, from his throat and going down in a wicked arc –
the one who breaks your heart?”
“Why are you being so grumpy?” Harry says, pushing the door open.
Ron shook his head disbelievingly. “But there’s all the
“Looking for you,” Malfoy said, “obviously.” He took Parvati’s empty seat and raised an eyebrow, crossing his legs at the ankles.
“You never talked about it again!” Malfoy says. “There was the war, and then you left, and I know you needed to, but when you came back you never talked about it!”
Ron was hopping up and down on one foot and cursing his name, and Ginny and the rest were laughing over something Luna’d said, but Hermione, pausing in the middle of consoling Ron, looked up. “Well, I suppose he’s got no chance of succeeding without N.E.W.T.S, does he, especially now?” she said, and beneath her words was the bewildered implication:
was dating Thomas, wasn’t she? Oh my God, you’ve loved Dean Thomas this whole time!”
Teddy kept looking at Malfoy curiously, so when Andromeda went into the kitchen to check how her house-elf was doing with refreshments, Harry dragged Malfoy aside to say, “Go talk to Teddy.”
“Don’t trivialise my job like that,” is Malfoy’s response. He grudgingly compliments Harry on the coffee, and takes out his
“It’s not working,” said Malfoy, frowning.
“No, I don’t.”
“You’re on a first-name basis with him,” despaired Pansy.
He liked the company, after all.
Remembering what Harry told him, to not contradict Narcissa’s beliefs, he nodded in response. “I’ll call the Aurors, but you have to come inside to make your statement.”
“You what?!”
Scorpius looked like he wanted to argue, but he nodded instead and scraped up the last pieces on his plate.
”No, come on! It’ll be brilliant!” Harry said with his stupid big puppy eyes.
”Barcelona. We’re in Barcelona.”
“You did what?” Draco gasped, that stupid bint.
Still panting, Draco watched Harry gingerly raise himself up to standing, turning around and then pulling Draco close against him, kissing him like his life depended on it. Draco gave back as good as he got, but it was hard because he was still out of breath. He gently pushed Harry away, and put their foreheads together instead. He ran his hands over Harry’s back, which was sticky with sweat and Draco’s come. “We really should clean up,” Draco said, though not making an effort to do it.
, Malfoy is too.
Malfoy collapses onto a nearby couch. “Coffee, you idiot.”
“Why not?” Malfoy was staring at him, flushed and desperate. “We can go back, and it’ll be the same – ”
“I’m not leaving,” Harry says, and sits down on the bed.
to?” Harry says indignantly.
Harry stares at him for a few seconds, then shakes his head and gives up. Maybe Malfoy is a little jealous of Harry, for having dinner with Blaise. He and Blaise have always had a strange sort of relationship. The thought of Blaise and Malfoy together makes Harry feel sick, but he pushes away the feeling, and gets ready to Apparate to Pansy’s.
name in the school motto, Potter.”
idea.”
Adriana grins brightly at him. “Thank you, Professor Potter sir.”
McGonagall’s gaze became gentler. “If you don’t, there’s been some talk about introducing a wizarding program for Muggleborn and half-blood children, to commingle with pureblood children – I thought perhaps you might like to be apart of it.”
“Yeah, Anthony’s a good bloke, too. Still, don’t you wish you were sharing with me instead?” Ron said, grinning and pulling her in for a kiss.
because you saved the wizarding world. Explain yourself.”

At least until now: Malfoy at the Slytherin table next to a figure Harry vaguely recognised as Blaise Zabini, and a Slytherin girl who’d been in their year who he honestly did not recognise at all. There were not many other Slytherins at the table, and they all mostly looked terrified despite McGonagall’s stern speech about inter-house unity. Most of them were just kids, Harry thought. They were just children, like Teddy Lupin. They were all just kids.
Inviting Malfoy to Grimmauld Place became clear as an awful idea as soon as they walked through the door. Malfoy’s chattering woke up the portrait of Sirius’s mad old mum and she began bellowing about half-blood filth and blood traitors.
. Malfoy tilts Harry’s chin up and kisses him like he’s trying to say a million things at once – I love you, I hate you, please don’t leave. Harry gasps out,
Malfoy had to talk to Dumbledore, but Harry didn’t know what Dumbledore had told Malfoy to do, what Dumbledore was going to do to protect Malfoy and Malfoy’s family. He’d accomplished his task, he’d set Malfoy on the course for good. Or as close as Malfoy could get to good. It was done. There was no need to think about Malfoy, or wonder if he was scared.
“Anthony probably wouldn’t mind switching,” Ron agreed. “He hasn’t got much history with Malfoy. No one would even notice, it’s not like McGonagall would find out.”
“So,” she said. “Draco Malfoy?”

Being back at Hogwarts, he supposed, was meant to be strange or hard or wondrous or
“Hey, have you ever had a crush on me?” Ron said.
“Alright?” Harry repeated.
smiley,” Malfoy corrects. “Aren’t you getting vanilla?”
“They were not,” Harry said.
Before Ron can retort angrily, Malfoy slides in next to Harry. “What disappointment? Are we talking about Weasley’s sad obsession with the Chudley Cannons?” He turns to Harry and says, “Hey,” softly.
Oh yes she would, he thought next, grimly, and he couldn’t stop thinking about it as they said goodbye to Hermione and went up their stairs. There was a long corridor that stretched out, three rooms on one side and two on the other, each with a door and names written on the door.
“You owe me.”
With Franny under Malfoy’s arm, they made a dash for the door, turning right and retracing their steps back to the common room, with the music crooning
“I like him more,” Harry said, letting Teddy clutch his pinky and planting a kiss in his hair as he enacted a play for Harry involving two potatoes that George had given him.
Harry’s first kiss had been Cho Chang, but his second had been Draco Malfoy.
Ron had his hands over his eyes and was asking Hermione if it was over yet, and McGonagall was beginning to march along to the Gryffindor table to break them apart, but Harry could see Ginny smiling from over here when they broke apart, and Blaise bowing to his audience, as Luna clapped vaguely. He’d never thought it would happen either, but he was glad for them. He hoped Ginny was happy.
to the List, but he finds himself falling asleep instead, right there on that stupid couch, falling asleep and dreaming of kissing Malfoy.
“Oh, Odo the hero,” he sings into Harry’s ear, leaning against his shoulders heavily, face flushed and hair an endearing mess, “they...something something home...something...something…”
“This isn’t healthy, Harry,” Hermione insisted, “are you friends with Malfoy or not? Make up your mind.” Harry didn’t like talking to Malfoy about Hermione. He didn’t think Malfoy deserved Hermione’s forgiveness, or Ron’s, not that it mattered since technically, to Harry's knowledge, Malfoy hadn’t apologised yet. But Hermione had a point. In the dark Potions classroom, Harry talked to Malfoy like he talked to Ron and Hermione, and outside of it, he usually punched him in the face.
than normal. They’re best friends. They’re going to go to Ron’s celebration party, and have fun, maybe. Everything will be great.
Malfoy narrows his eyes, but he’s turned bright pink. “I can hardly wait, my beautiful dove.” He flounces off, ignoring the laughter around him.
Harry could not stop looking at the scar, the dip of Malfoy’s collarbone. “It’s not alright.”
────────────
Harry had got what he wanted, but he had made things ten times worse than they already were. Maybe a little distance from Malfoy could have helped. But maybe the fact that he didn’t want any distance from Malfoy was the reason no one could help him at all.
Malfoy shrugs his bony shoulders. “Let’s talk about something else.”
“No, really,” Malfoy says.
Harry bit off a large piece of his toast, nonplussed. “Time for what?”
“Have I not been sleeping,” Malfoy scoffed, and avoided his eyes.
“I’m well aware,” snapped Malfoy, and then, grudgingly, “Sorry. I
“Good.” Harry shrugs, wanting to wait until they were in private to confront Malfoy about
“I did have to do that,” Harry said quietly. “I had to.”
He couldn’t sleep anyway. He lied awake all night, thinking about the curve of Malfoy’s mouth when he smiled, unexpected because he was always sneering or smirking. He couldn’t decide if it was better or worse that Malfoy wasn’t awake too.
Blaise did not seem fazed by this. “I do like her,” he said, and smiled strikingly. “I’d rather not hurt her if I can manage it.”
“I don’t really have to go to Pansy’s,” says Harry, “do I?”
here?”
“Squash that pawn, Ron. Oh – damn.”
Zabini was standing in front of Malfoy’s bed, looking completely refreshed and not hungover at all, the bastard.
“Wait,” Harry says. He leans forward and plants a kiss on Malfoy’s lips. Malfoy’s eyes flutter shut, and when Harry pulls away, they open again. He brings a hand up to his lips, carefully. He smiles at Harry. Malfoy’s smile is brighter than the stars at night.
Malfoy immediately moved towards Harry’s trunk and started rifling through it.
He didn’t think anything of it, that the feeling when he’d seen Malfoy was the same feeling he’d gotten when he’d seen Hogwarts. Not immediately. Not on the first day, when everyone was greeting each other and hugging and making fun of new haircuts. Not when Hermione came through the door with snow on her eyelashes and Ron spun her around and kissed her delightedly, or when Dean and Seamus came inside the common room holding hands and beaming. He didn’t even think about it that night, when he and Malfoy stayed up talking until their eyes were drooping and they’d passed out. He didn’t think about it the next day in class, sleeping on Malfoy’s shoulder and kicking each other’s ankles until Flitwick noticed. He did think,
Harry came back to the conversation to grin at Malfoy and say, “Oh, yeah, doesn’t it have your name in it?”
“Me neither,” Daphne said, vastly entertained.
“Been there, done that.”
“One two three, step-step-turn-you-are-awful-at-this-Potter-step –

“I think Blaise Zabini is very interested in dancing with you,” Luna offered.
that you would trust us with this, and I’m so happy for you, but I’m so
“He did?”
Hermione was frowning. “Do you mean to say, this, with Malfoy...is recent?”
“Oh,” Dean said again. Harry thought hysterically that
you, you wanker, you’re insufferable!”
They went down to lunch together and ate a hearty helping of everything, since they’d missed breakfast and were both starving. Malfoy tried to steer Harry towards the Slytherin table, and Harry tried to move towards the Gryffindor table, and eventually they sat at the Ravenclaw table, by Terry Boot and Anthony Goldstein, who looked absolutely bewildered. Zabini, muttering darkly about Pansy Parkinson for some reason, sat down next to them and spent the whole time flirting scandalously with Terry Boot, which. Harry had not expected. He hadn’t known Zabini, of all people – well. Terry seemed half-interested and half-alarmed, anyway.
“My love life is not depressing, thank you very much,” says Blaise dryly. “Just because I’m not in love like you lot – ”
────────────────────
“Obsession,” repeated Harry, flatly. “I was not – I was not
He woke up from a nightmare about Sirius and Malfoy was already awake, sitting on the floor in front of his bed and working on his Charms essay. It hurt to think of Malfoy not being able to sleep for the past week and just lying there, so that he would not bother Harry. Even though it wasn’t like that wasn’t what Malfoy deserved.
Malfoy had filled up almost all of their bookshelf with more books than Harry had thought anyone but Hermione owned. He was taking N.E.W.T level Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, because he planned on being a Cursebreaker after school. He was taking History of Magic too, and he constantly recited his notes when he was writing assignments. Each night before they went to sleep, if they went upstairs at the same night, Malfoy talked at great length about how insufferable Binns was and about all his classes, so that Harry felt obligated to talk about his too.
Harry almost asked.
“Rocket ship truck,” Teddy said, brandishing his paper proudly.
“We can’t go back to like it was before because I’m in love with you, you idiot!” Harry shouted.
, but Malfoy was already going on, “That’s still not an excuse, you could at least buy terrible clothes in your
of you to be able to treat your roommate with the utmost respect, and to come to me if you have any problems.”
Malfoy looked up wildly, and Harry looked away.
“That’s not an answer,” Harry accused.
Ginny had been right to worry about her mother – Molly pushed them together at every opportunity. Harry knew she just wanted a little bit of happiness, but both of them were losing their patience by the time they’d been sent to wash the dishes after dinner and Molly had shooed everyone else away.
Harry flinched but Zabini didn’t. He kept going. “Theo’s family was too affiliated with the Death Eaters. Millie’s been travelling. Daphne was going back, but you see how fickle she is, completely absorbed with her Gryffindor.”
Harry looked away because he thought if Malfoy kept smiling he might do something stupid like kiss him. “I’m sorry that you don’t want me to mean it,” he said in a low voice. “But I do.”
?” Malfoy sounded scandalised. “I cannot believe this.”
“Don’t think Malfoy would like that too much...alright, good night Harry.”
“We haven’t ever done that,” Harry points out. He tries to imagine calling Malfoy
He wasn’t sure whether he had got to Malfoy, whether Malfoy had listened to him.
the point is that I can handle it. I’m handling it.”
“Er,” Harry said.
“I’ve wanted to kiss you since sixth year,” Harry says, at the same time.
Harry rolled his eyes gratefully. “I just – I don’t know if you know – ”
Since Harry knew about Malfoy’s Muggle friends now, when Harry went over to visit the Weasleys or Teddy and Andromeda, Malfoy sometimes went to visit Ester and the girls. Harry would have liked to meet them, but Malfoy never asked, so he never did. It was after one of these trips that Malfoy triumphantly came home – no, to Grimmauld Place – with a Muggle telly and a VHS tape.
Malfoy is still speaking in that soft, amused voice. Harry scowls at him.
They were nice, those summers with Malfoy and his students.
things like that. You were just
Zabini threw his hands up in the air dramatically. “I don’t
“I think he would too,” Harry said, and after that the visit to Teddy and Andromeda ran fairly smoothly, and when they were leaving, Malfoy mentioned to Andromeda, hesitantly, that maybe he would write a letter to his mother about her. This meant that Malfoy came with Harry to Teddy’s birthday party, where many Weasleys looked at him askance but said nothing for Andromeda and Teddy’s sakes. Malfoy spent most of the party hiding behind Harry’s back anyway, which didn’t work because he was taller, and Ron gave Harry a look he couldn’t decipher. Teddy was happy, though. Harry called it a success.
And the door closed again before Harry could say anything, not that he knew what he would say, not that he needed to say anything. He wondered whether Malfoy was going to be a bastard about this. Surely not, since Blaise –
He feels that, having lured Malfoy to the side of light in sixth year and having lived with him for three years, he can now call them friends.
ever do is complain about him complaining and insulting your hair,” points out Ginny, yawning. “Ron, did you see how badly the Chudley Cannons lost yesterday?”
“I’m not trying to,” Harry said, and stopped. “I mean, it’s complicated, but I saw flashes of what Voldemort was doing, and I saw you, and. You didn’t look glad. And when you Disarmed Dumbledore – ” His voice stumbled. “You didn’t seem like you wanted to, and I saw your wand lower – ”
“Don’t stop,” Malfoy says, but he means
“We’re really sorry, Professor,” Harry said at once. “It was an accident, it was my fault, really – ”
Harry thought he should have been upset that she was here, but he wasn’t. It felt good to know that he wasn’t the only person who couldn’t sleep, that most of them had nightmares. It felt like he wasn’t alone. He nodded towards the basket and asked, “What’s in there?”
, for this and for putting him in a room with Malfoy in the first place, but he could not quite find the words.
Harry went to change and brush his teeth first, and he waited for Malfoy on his bed instead of going down to find Ron and Hermione, and he wasn’t sure why. Malfoy came out of the bathroom in his school robes smelling like vanilla again so Harry gave in and asked him what it was, because he could now.
“I’m always singing, even when everyone begs me to stop, because I know how talented and misunderstood I really am – ”
Malfoy smiles, a little wryly, a little self-deprecating. “You can’t beat since fifth year.”
He did not have enough energy to hate Draco bloody Malfoy, even though he could remember hating Malfoy more than anything, hating Malfoy so much it kept him up at night, hating Malfoy so much he let them provoke each other, just so he could satisfy that particular urge to punch him in the face. He could not bring himself to do it now. He supposed there was a reason he had saved Malfoy’s life three times in the past year, but it felt incredibly like he was paying for that now.
to just let him go like that, like nothing had happened at all last night, so Harry found himself saying, “Wait, we can...head down to lunch together? Since we didn’t eat?”
“What went wrong?”
Remus had said dryly,
Harry looked at his toast depressingly. It now looked about as appetizing as sawdust. This was a terrible conversation that made no sense whatsoever. Possibly nothing would ever make sense again.
Harry laughs a little. “Of course you already know.”
Harry smiles in response, Malfoy pokes his dimple absently, like he’s so used to poking Harry’s dimple that he does it without thinking now.
Malfoy sputtered. “
────────────
“Alright, Madam Pomfrey it is,” Malfoy decided. And then he was making his way past Harry and closing the door. Harry frowned at the door accusingly, and then turned around to say, “No I’m fine.”
, and they’d been kicking each other’s ankles and it was just more
“Yes.” McGonagall’s gaze was sympathetic. “You know, Harry, that Hogwarts will always have a place for you, however many years down the road you choose to return. I daresay any Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher would be thrilled to train you as a replacement.”
“Sorry?” Harry echoed, bemused, but Malfoy slipped out of bed, grabbed his robes, and went into the bathroom before Harry could say anything else. He was alarmingly quick. It was like he was trying to make sure he and Harry weren’t alone together for longer than a few seconds. This was not what Harry had expected in any way shape or form, if he had expected this at all, which he hadn’t.
Draco gave Potter a nod, then he bent down and gathered his pamphlets. Before he left he turned around, “Thank you, Potter. It means a lot.” He closed the door behind him and let out a big sigh.
“Please, please Harry. I need you inside me,” Draco whined, not sure if Harry heard him properly because his fingers didn’t ease up. He tried to get up on his elbows when Harry finally withdrew, and Draco felt Harry’s slick cock at his entrance. He felt almost too eager, pushing back, Harry grabbing his hips to stop him.
Draco snorted, but he didn’t contradict him, he leaned over to kiss him instead. “You already do.”
Draco, too shocked to deflect the other blow, took another slap across his face before he reacted and held his mother in a firm grip against him. She screamed and tried to break loose but he wouldn’t let her. “It’s me, mother. It’s me. Calm down,” He begged her.
Draco was used to his father’s tactics, so his attempt to scare him didn’t bother Draco in the slightest. What did bother him though, was the little tic his father did with his left eye, the one sign Draco knew meant that he was lying.
“And your mother won’t be able to stay at home for much longer, so you’ll have a lot of time on your hands.” Harry swallowed.
“Come on, you know you love to hear your own voice. Besides, isn't nice to be superior to me in something?
He felt a hand on his shoulder, and Harry sunk down in the chair beside him. “How’s your mother?”
“You don’t say?” Draco interrupted him.
“I’ll go get the Aurors for you, mother. You should rest in the meantime.” He lowered himself down to Nimly’s level, making sure his mother didn’t hear him. “I need to get some help, can you keep an eye on my mother and Scorpius until I’m back?”
Malfoy strode off not even giving Harry a chance to beg for more advice. Maybe it was for the best, Harry still felt a bit flustered from all the images dancing before his eyes, imagining himself being tied up and left at Malfoy’s mercy. Well, at least Harry had something to do instead of going to sleep he thought, while trying to walk somewhat normal with his erection straining against his trousers, back to his room.
“No, I’ve…” Harry almost had the urge to tell Malfoy about his sleepwalking but that would be absurd wouldn’t it? But he remembered Hermione telling him that Malfoy wasn’t a bad person. And perhaps it was easier telling someone he knew wouldn’t care or worry about him than telling one of his friends. Malfoy was gazing at him with a look that told him to go on.
Draco hummed in response. Finally, he opened his eyes slowly, letting them get used to the soft light around him before he turned his head towards Harry. He was leaning against the couch, his head only an arm's length away from Draco’s, Harry’s warm green eyes looking at him.
“I don’t hate you.” He didn’t look to see Harry’s expression but he could hear him groan as the flames swept him away.
“And you have?” Lucius asked. “You’ve spent less and less time at home, leaving your son for the elves to take care of. The only reason you’re home now is because your boss couldn’t keep his business in order. To think Mr Finley was an honest and good pureblood only to find out he’s been dealing with Muggle drugs like a miscreant. Pathetic!”
“No you’re not, I think you’re amazing,” Harry answered, slowly bringing Draco’s hand towards his lips and kissing his knuckles gently.
”I’m not blind, Potter!” Draco dragged Harry along with him in search of their hotel. ”Close that mouth of yours. One would think you've never been out of Britain before.”
Narcissa nodded absentmindedly but didn’t give a clear answer to what she prefered.
“It’s better if I don’t tell you. Makes the interrogation easier for you.” He squeezed his shoulder and went back to the middle of the store.
Ron let out a whistle to get attention from Kristoff, indicating they were leaving. Draco didn’t think the man could scowl any deeper but he was sorely mistaken. He could almost see the smoke coming out of his ears. Ron was out through the door first, but Kristoff slowed down before he caught up with him. He stopped by the door, he looked at Draco and then he kicked over an umbrella stand before rushing out, several snake umbrellas started to slither around on the floor, scurrying away before Draco could catch them. He was in for some overtime today it seemed.
“The fact that you use words like
“Keep going, don’t stop!” Harry begged.
“Shh! Sir, keep your voice down. We will not crash, it’s just a bit of turbulence. Now, please sit down here with your partner and fasten your seatbelt.” She gently, but firmly, steered Draco back to his seat beside Harry.
Harry licked him again, his tongue carefully going over the slit. Draco had to look down again, only to see Harry’s lips glistening with precome. Draco couldn’t stop himself from smiling, and the wicked smile Harry gave in return was the only warning he got before Harry swallowed him down. Harry’s mouth was warm and he seemed to figure out exactly what turned Draco into a shivering, babbling mess. It wasn’t long before Draco had to take a firm grip on Harry’s hair to make him stop.
Draco batted his hand away. “I don’t want to come like this.” He dragged Harry towards him for a kiss. “I want you in me.”
“This again!” Draco shook his head. “Blood has nothing to do with family Potter, surely you must know that since you are a Weasley and all.”
Harry nudged Draco so that he was looking at him again. “But you can, and you have. For a long time you did everything on your own, and that’s okay. But now, this is different, you know? Your mother needs help, help that you can’t provide. And that’s not your fault, that’s just how it is.”
he thought.
“Yes,” Draco hummed in response, trying to get even closer to Harry. “I’m filthy,” he complained.
Draco’s first instinct was to say no, but something in Ron’s open expression made him hesitate. He was one of the few people that had treated Draco nicely after the war, and nothing about him gave any indication that he asked only to be polite. Since they made a truce they’ve always been honest with each other, as far as Draco knew. Also, Draco was fairly sure that he actually would find it quite pleasant to have an evening out. So instead of declining, he answered with a nod.
An image of Potter laughing with Scorpius flew through his head. “I’ll think of something.”
“Of course, Andie. She should’ve gotten an appointment right away, I only did what they should’ve done.”
Narcissa looked at him with a disapproving look. “Don’t talk about your father like that,” she scolded, “and language, Draco. I will not have my grandson use those foul words.”
“It’s not a regular thing, and what were you doing awake at that hour, again I might add?” He looked at Hermione squirming a bit in her seat.
“No, I get that. Ron squeezed his shoulder. “Okay, let’s grab a pint and talk about our children then. Rose has been super curious about Scorpius, Harry talks about him a lot.” At Draco’s surprised expression he added, “Only good things, promise.”
“I said no! There’s about three hours left. Go to sleep or something.”
Malfoy removed his hand from the table. “I have what, now?”
“So,” Harry said, tilting his head back with a smile, to get a look at Draco. “Did I prove myself?”
Pansy nodded and left the table, laughing as she went.
Ron nodded. “You deserve a proper job, you know.”
Potter went into Shacklebolt’s office and came out with his wand a couple of seconds later. He walked across the room with long strides, and didn’t look at either Dora or Draco as he left, leaving an awkward silence behind him.
Draco cut him off. “No, I don’t want another healer. I’m well aware that you’re good at what you do, and I want my mother to have the best care there is.”
“I don’t know what to say to you. I know I’m oblivious sometimes but please, I stare at you every time I get the chance, how haven’t you noticed? And no, I don’t know everything about you, yet. But I want to. Please, Draco I really want to” Harry said while taking a tentative step forward.
Biddle gave him a stern look and continued, “It could sort itself out, but with a little help we think we can get most of your memories back.”
“You’re so tight,” Harry whispered, pushing the finger back again, this time more slick with lube that Draco hadn’t even noticed Harry had gotten.
Draco tried to feel happy about getting the bed to himself, but he couldn’t help but feel that it was wrong somehow. He started to unpack and put his clothes in the closet. He picked out his outfit for the day and slipped into the bathroom. With the new outfit on, he was just about to ask Harry if he was done, when he turned around and dropped his shoe that he was holding.
Draco took a sip from his coffee. He looked down, pretending to read the newspaper just to avoid Harry’s eager eyes. He gave up after a couple of minutes because it felt like Harry was staring a hole through his forehead. He was like a dog waiting for his treat.
“You could’ve warned me so I–” The water in the sinks turned on, and Draco couldn’t hear the rest of Potter's muffled response.
Harry ran his hands over Draco’s back, then he spread his cheeks slightly. “You have no idea how hot you look like this.” His thumb traced around Draco’s rim while Draco kept on fucking backwards. “You feel fucking amazing.” He stopped petting Draco’s arsehole and instead he clasped a hand around Draco’s cock, which was slippery from all the precome he leaked onto the mattress. Harry started to stroke him with a firm grip, trying to keep up with Draco’s pace. “Come, Draco,” Harry begged with a hard thrust. “I want to feel you come, your tight hole clenching around me.”
Potter shook his head. “No, nothing that will make it go away, I’m sorry,” he said, then he addressed Narcissa again. “The best thing to do is to keep on as you were, continue to do things that you enjoy. I know this is a lot to deal with, Mrs Malfoy. If it’s alright with you I would like to set you up with some appointments with one of our mind healers. I can get it sorted so that you can come to St Mungo’s once a week, or if you would rather have them visit you at the Manor that can also be arranged.”
Harry laughed. ”That’s not what my memory tells me. I’m pretty sure there are pictures as well.”
Potter raised his head. “Oh, um… I don’t want to impose.”
“You’re awake!” Harry said, feeling a bit dumb. “You’re always asleep when I’m up at night, well, those few nights I’m up that is,” he added, trying to save himself.
Draco tried to swallow past the guilt he could feel forming a lump in his throat, not knowing what to say to defend himself. “I’ll talk to Mr Finley and see if I can get more time off.”
“It’s been 14 years since the war, Potter.” Draco sighed. “I’m not the same as I was then, and I can’t imagine that you are either. Sure, I see where you come from, but I was perhaps hoping that people could see by now how much I changed, even if your memories of a young me haven’t. I don’t give a rat's arse about blood status, how could I Potter?” Draco clenched his hands. “You can’t seriously believe that I think that anything good came from the war? That I’m happy my aunt was widowed and lost her daughter? That Teddy lost both of his parents? You have no reason to like me Potter, but to think so little of me, that’s low even for you.”
“A bit,” Harry said, but he was smiling. “Do you want to grab a drink?”
It was the beginning of March and work had been busier than usual, something was happening but Draco couldn’t figure out what. The Aurors had stopped coming a week prior and the boxes were starting to pile up. The ones that usually went into Mr Finley’s office were piled behind the counter, and the man himself hadn’t been around for the last couple of days. Draco was a bit worried about leaving all their inventory out in the open as he didn’t know what they contained, and if the Aurors decided to stop by again he had no means to stop them from searching through the boxes.
Harry stared at him. “Move in with you? We couldn’t even survive three days with each other.”
Blaise snorted out a laugh. “Ah, Potter. I should’ve known.” He gave Draco a patronizing smile, kissed him on the cheek and left.
“Ah! He’s awake again. We got your test results back, Mr. Malfoy. You suffer from a slight memory loss— ”
Harry waved her away and tried to get the attention from Tom in the bar. “Pfft!” Harry said, while ordering another. “It’s fine, Hermione. I’m totally peachy.”
He woke up on his side facing a mop of black hair as Harry was pressing soft kisses against his shoulder, his hair tickling Draco’s cheek. He huffed out a little laugh and Harry looked up at him with his bright green eyes. He smiled at him before he dove down again, continuing to place kisses against Draco’s shoulder and neck. Draco slowly traced his fingers over Harry’s back, leaving a trail of goosebumps as he did so. He let his fingers brush against Harry’s thigh before reaching his hard cock, giving it a firm stroke as Harry started to work on what would be an impressive hickey on his neck. He continued to lazily stroke him as Harry panted harder and harder, making sounds that had Draco squirming in response.
“Go home and get some rest, your mother will be home in the morning.”
He looked through the book carefully, not wanting to damage it. The hero had similarities to Potter he couldn’t help but snort at, but overall the book was incredible.
“So, how...,” Draco cleared his throat. “How do we do this?”
When he finally got to enter the study, he sat down in his father’s chair, while Lucius sat behind his desk. His father raised his eyebrows in a silent question, but Draco didn’t know how he wanted to start the conversation. He noticed his mother’s writing journal on the desk and picked it up, glancing through it absentmindedly. As long as Draco could remember, she always kept her journal with her, scribbling down notes on how her day had been. When Draco was little he always snuck glances at her entries, but for a small boy they were always quite boring, so he hadn’t bothered since. But he knew she had kept the habit during all these years, even during the war, hiding her journal in Draco’s chamber. He closed the book but kept it on his lap.
Harry kept looking at him and gave him a little nod, but somehow his face looked like he was bothered by something.
“Fair point! Helsinki?”
“I… don’t know really. Because I w— ”
, and Draco was standing in the dark with a sinking feeling in his gut.
“I want to go to the cock.” Draco laughed.
“Would someone care to explain what the hell happened to me?” Draco stared at Potter.
Draco leaned over and kissed Harry, making their lips meet briefly before he pulled back a little to look at him. “You should.”
“Stop putting words in my mouth, Draco. You know that it’s only a matter of time,” Harry said, looking sad.
Harry could feel his whole face turning hot from the images he got from Malfoy’s last sentence. He was right. Someone should tie him up, preferably Malfoy. Preferably a naked Malfoy. Preferably a naked Malfoy keeping him down with his own body and…
“And then what? I send my mother away like the failure I am?” Draco asked, his voice rising. “Then I’ll go and get myself a fancy little job, right? Because after working with a fucking drug dealer for years the job offerings are piling around me.”
He woke slower this time, the divine smell lingering around him. Warm puffs of air against his neck, a warm arm draped over him, making him feel secure in a way he never felt before. He should leave the bed right in this instant, but it felt too good, too right, and Harry was too tired to get up. What if he only closed his eyes a minute more? What harm could come from that his sleepy brain told him. A lot apparently, because the next thing that woke him was an alarm and a very awake Malfoy behind him.
“Not a fucking word to that bint!” Draco said, raising his finger at Harry. And then he stormed off to the elevator. Harry laughed and followed closely behind.
Draco held his gaze for a couple of seconds, then he sighed. If Potter was telling the truth then Draco had overreacted and it would be silly to leave him hanging. “Apology accepted.”
“We could share?” he heard himself suggest, and then regretting it immediately when he saw Harry’s raised eyebrows. “I mean, we could transfigure it to a bigger bed of course. It’s not like I want to sleep with you, because I don’t want that. Sleep with you, I mean.” Draco closed his mouth, but the damage was already done.
“Hmm? What do you suggest then?” Draco asked, but still casted a cleaning charm over them both.
Draco must’ve fallen asleep. He looked up at Healer Biddle who was hovering over him.
She kept on muttering the whole way back to the Manor, and Draco took her to her room. He quietly called for Nimly and asked her in a low voice to stir a sleeping potion in his mother’s tea. His mother was cold and shaking, but Nimly was able to get her to swallow a couple of sips before she pushed the cup away, spilling tea over the carpet.
“What? Isn’t that a good enough answer for you?” Draco didn’t know why he was responding with so much hostility, but his own lingering feelings of being useless triggered something in him.
Draco did everything to make his mother’s days as pleasant as possible. It had been a month since he stormed out of Harry's place, and after ignoring Harry’s owls and Andromeda’s pleading eyes he hadn't heard from him in a couple of weeks. He had started on several letters, each of them trying to ask for forgiveness, offering an explanation, but nothing he wrote made any sense so he’d burned them all. He was ashamed and sad, catching himself thinking about Harry several times a day, getting lost in his own thoughts, but as the days passed his mother required more and more care.
Draco was relieved to see that Ron didn’t smile, instead, he looked apologetically at him while he strode towards him and grasped his shoulder. “Thank you,” he said, taking a step back. “This is just what we needed to shut this place down.”
“No! Absolutely not, Potter!” Malfoy stood and went to gather his belongings.
“Harry!” Draco said, smiling, “I don’t like you. I love you.”
“Is he? Is he a boy in question?”
the day after wasn’t pretty, but Draco knew he deserved it so he didn’t try to contact Potter again. Although, he did write a letter to each member of the Weasley family and a long letter to Granger. Not asking for forgiveness, but at least offering an apology for his part in the war and how he had treated them. Surprisingly, the only answer he got was from Ron, who thanked him for reaching out to them, but saying they were too fragile to offer anything else at the moment.
Draco chuckled. “That could be arranged.”
Draco didn’t answer. He had spotted Minister Shacklebolt who saw him and waved him over.
He and Astoria had lived in a beautiful little house on the outskirts of London, making it easy for both of them to date muggles without anyone other than them knowing. Since they got Scorpius their outings to muggle London had been fewer and fewer, but Draco’s attempts at having a relationship with his parents again had increased. When Astoria died, the only logical reasoning was for him to move back to the only family he had left.
“What’s your deal with Harry anyway?” Ron asked, only slightly raising his eyebrows at Draco’s empty drink. He sipped on his pint carefully, his second glass only half empty. “I thought you would have left all those bad feelings behind you by now.”
Harry continued laughing while climbing onto his bed, muttering a spell, and a few seconds later he was sprawled out, tied to the bed by both his arms and legs.
“No, it’s not okay, Harry.” Draco shook his head, taking one of Harry’s hands in his own. “I’m just used to doing things on my own,” he said, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder instead. “I was pampered and looked after all my life before the war, I didn't have to lift a finger. I was a spoiled brat.”
“Yes, why wouldn’t I be?” Harry said, somehow feeling he was missing something of importance here.
Harry clasped Draco’s hands with his own, tugging them away from his robe. He gently took a grip of Draco’s chin and raised his head. “Look at me.” They were standing pressed up against each other, and when Draco took one look at Harry he could feel his anger draining away. He let his head fall down onto Harry’s collarbone and Harry put his arms around him, hugging him tightly. They stood there for a minute, Harry stroking his back while Draco got his breathing in order. “Come, we’ll go someplace where we can talk.”
“No, there’s nothing more for you to do. Just… perhaps wait outside for one of us to take you to the Ministry.”
”How do you know that?” Harry gaped at him.
Draco didn’t bother to answer as he hurried out to get his mother safely back into the house again.
As they stood by the elevator, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand again, intertwining their fingers. It was a confusing feeling, the one that spread through Draco, but as they stepped into the elevator he couldn't help but to lean into Harry, placing a kiss in his hair. Harry looked at him with that look on his face, that Draco had been fortunate to see only once before. Harry looked contented.
“It’s a bit warm in here, don’t you think?” Potter said, nervously.
Harry startled awake, yet again, almost falling down the stairs. This sleepwalking thing was getting tiresome, he thought, while dragging his tired body back to the dorms.
“Sleepwalking you say. I haven’t noticed,” Malfoy said, coughing a little. “Why don’t you spell your door shut? That was what my mother did when I was a kid and used to sleepwalk”.
Draco swallowed down his immediate anger and tried to compose himself before he answered, not wanting to give his father the satisfaction of losing his temper. “Well, I understand that she doesn’t have any fond memories of you, father, but she's been acting differently lately. I’m afraid there’s something wrong with her.”
Draco groaned and gently moved Scorpius' legs a little. “Call me dad, Scorpius. No need to be so formal all the time.”
“But I never noticed you? You were always on the couch, not anywhere near me.”
“Still, that was very immature of me.”
Malfoy shook his head violently. “I did no such thing. I was merely resting my eyes to escape the horror of Mrs Lindon.” He took his glasses and folded them neatly into his breast pocket.
“I haven’t talked to her for a long time. I don’t see her for more than a couple of minutes a day, at most. Sometimes I don’t even see her at all. Why can’t I just be a decent son?”
Draco’s brilliant plan on how to cover up feelings was by being a git. It hurt a little, but it was better that Harry thought Draco was being his obnoxious self, rather than totally in love with him.
“So what would that make me? Your roommate?” Harry also took a step forward.
“Technically it was
Draco sat down with Scorpius beside him and listened to Teddy’s stories about Hogwarts while they were exchanging gifts. Teddy was a good storyteller and it made both Scorpius and Draco break down in laughter several times when he did his impressions of his professors. He could feel Harry’s eyes searching for his, making him blush every time they met. Draco wasn’t sure what Harry’s intentions were, more than making him hot all over, but it was getting harder and harder to ignore his lingering gaze.
“But grandfather said—”
Draco looked through his fingers at Dora. “Not a fucking word!”
Draco snorted, but Kristoff looked murderous, and he was only inches away from Draco’s face now. He was about to speak again when Ron took a grip on his collar and dragged him backwards.
“Mate, can you be any more obvious?”
Scorpius nodded and walked towards Potter. Draco could hear him ask for a hug and see Potter smiling at him, but when he glanced towards Draco the smile vanished from his face and he almost looked weary. Potter raised his eyebrows like he was asking for permission. Draco snorted, but he made a motion with his hand as to indicate to go for it. He then watched as Potter smiled again, a big bright smile that took over all of his face, and he leaned down and gave Scorpius a big hug.
Then it was as if nothing had happened. She didn’t speak after that, not acknowledging Draco’s presence, even when he left her with a kiss on her cheek. Every time he left he wished he didn’t have to come back, and he hated himself for it but couldn’t help it. That’s why he was sitting alone in the cafeteria, trying to gather his thoughts before going home.
,” Draco said as an excuse.
Draco cut him off before he could continue. “I’m sorry, but I don’t want to have this discussion with you when Scorpius is nearby. So, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go and have a cup of tea with my aunt without sullying this day by talking about my dead relatives.”
Potter blushed. “I didn’t know that when I bought it, I just thought that Scorpius would enjoy the dragons.”
“By choice!”
A healer, who was unfamiliar to Draco, entered.
“You were about to ask me if you could borrow my notes for tomorrow, and the answer is no. Do your own bloody work, will you?”
Something ached in Draco’s chest when he looked down, and shook his head again. He didn’t dare to look up as Harry exited the room. When he heard the door close, he fell back onto the bed and closed his eyes.
“Yeah? Me and Hermione’s daughter. You knew I had a child right?”
Harry laughed as Draco pushed him into the elevator and started to unbutton his trousers, and slowly sank down on his knees with the doors closing behind them.
Harry chuckled, and then dropped his head down on the desk with a moan when Draco pressed two fingers in, pushing as much come back inside him as he could. He wished he was younger, so he could go again immediately, but for now this was enough, hearing Harry’s moans and watching his fingers disappearing over and over again.
Harry didn’t know when his blood started boiling with something else rather than anger when faced with Malfoy. He hadn’t been surprised to find out that Malfoy was also going back to Hogwarts for their eighth year. During the trials Malfoy had pleaded to the jury that he wanted to take his N.E.W.T.s so he could train to become a healer, to somehow repair the damage he’d done in the war. That, and Harry testifying on both his and his mother’s behalf, made the Wizengamot decide that Malfoy was free of his charges, but would be put to house arrest with his parents if he failed his courses. So, when Harry caught a glimpse of blond hair in one of the train compartments, he couldn’t help but feel relieved. Harry had almost tried being the same prat towards Malfoy that he’d always been the first couple of days, but when Malfoy wouldn’t even look at him, he found it quite ridiculous to keep up the charade. Instead, the very first time he did catch Malfoy looking at him he just nodded in acknowledgment and was rewarded with a pair of raised eyebrows and a tentative nod back.
Harry huffed out a laugh, and started to work his hand on Draco’s cock, “Isn’t that the point?”
It was with a heavy feeling Draco entered his flat. The knowledge that he probably had ruined everything good he had going with Harry was eating at him. He felt like a coward, but most of all he felt lonely. The flat was dark and empty. He was used to having Harry here, occupying his space with his whole presence, and he missed him. He sat on his sofa, where Harry used to sleep, and stroked his hand over one of the cushions. Harry belonged here. There must be something he could do to save this. If he could just gather the courage to tell Harry how he felt, they could take it from there.
Potter looked at Draco with wide eyes and winced. “Feelings?”
Draco started to walk away when Potter stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. He dropped it when Draco startled.
“Nonsense, you’ll stay.” Andromeda gestured towards the table filled with tea cups and a large lemon and lavender cake, Draco’s favourite.
Draco looked around to see if Scorpius had really left the room before casting a
“Good for you mate. Now you can finally act on your feelings. I’m happy for you.” Ron gave him a hug that Harry didn’t reciprocate.
Draco snorted. “I’m a fucking coward, that’s what I am.”
“Andromeda’s,” Draco mumbled, still keeping his eyes closed, not wanting to open them and see who was in front of him. But he knew, which made him even more determined to not make it real. Draco could hear Harry sigh, as he guided him off the chair and into a standing position. His legs were wobbly, and he could hear someone behind him laugh as Harry took a firm grip around him so that he wouldn’t fall over.
“I’ll see if Scorpius can stay with Andromeda again, but I can’t promise anything.”
Malfoy let out a big sigh. He put his hand in Harry’s hair, and carded through it a couple of times. Then he took a firm grip and shook Harry’s head gently. “You’re awfully adorable when you’re intoxicated, Harry. We’ll talk tomorrow, okay?” He rose from his chair but then leaned down and kissed Harry on the cheek.
“Pfft, Ernie, you’re no fun!” Draco said while poking Harry in the face with his index finger, probably aiming for his nose but ending up smudging Harry’s glasses. “Ma’am!” Draco shouted, raising his glass in the air and waving it around, “another one of these, please!”
“So, who are we trying to fool, dear?” Blaise whispered in Draco’s ear.
Auror Kristoff took a threatening step towards Draco. “That is not how you address an Auror, Mr Malfoy,” he said, close to Draco’s face.
Draco woke up to the familiar smell of hospital. He felt nauseous, and the urge to be sick was so strong, he had to put his hands up to cover his mouth. But something was attached to one of them. Another hand. The nausea subdued a bit from the chock and he blinked his eye’s open. This was strange. Either he was still dreaming, or he’d hit his head extremely hard and started imagining things. There could be no other explanation to the fact that Harry Potter was sleeping in a chair beside his bed, holding Draco’s hand in a tight grip. A knock on the door made Potter stir, but he slept on.
Draco watched as Potter scooped up ice cubes from his water and squeezed them in his hand, and then dragged them over his forehead, water seeping between his fingers. He stopped and then looked at Draco’s raised eyebrows.
“Thank you,” Andromeda smiled at him.
As the pain subdued, he stood up on wobbly legs and rushed to the fire place. He threw in the whole bowl of floo powder and called out,
“Why Bert? Why didn’t they name me something else. I mean, Bert? Really?” Draco said, sulking.
And that was that, no other words than “Potter” and “Malfoy” had been uttered between them this entire time they’d been back, and still Malfoy was occupying Harry’s thoughts more and more each passing day. Harry had never let his thoughts linger on other boys before, not doing it deliberate anyway. But after ending things with Ginny at the beginning of the summer, both agreeing they were better off as friends, he started letting himself feel what he wanted to feel and look where he wanted to look. And if that was to look at Malfoy, so be it.
Scorpius looked between them both, clearly uncomfortable about what was happening at the table. Draco put an arm around him. “Go to your room, darling, so I can speak with your grandfather.” He kissed him on the head and Scorpius scurried away.
L.M. Montgomery, The Story Girl
“So anyway, I’m really sorry,” Potter tried again.
-Inspirational quote
“Why would you do such a thing? Now everyone will think I’m a poor lonely sod, wallowing in my own misery.” Draco dragged his hand over his face.
Draco looked Potter straight in the eyes and shook his head. “No, definitely not.”
“Malfoy kissed me,” Harry said, still staring out in the open air.
“I’m sorry, Mr Malfoy, but we’re not allowed to tell you who’s been admitted to the hospital,” Moira said dismissively.
Harry nodded, and he lifted their joined hands to kiss Draco’s knuckles. “Tonight.”
Draco’s eyes widened, but he took Harry’s hand and sat down. Harry let Draco fasten his seatbelt and then took his hand again, stroking his thumb over Draco’s knuckles.
Draco frowned. “It’s a muggle book.”
Harry cut him off. “I know you’re mad, but please hear me out. I didn’t mean to sleep in your bed, I was sleepwalking again.”
It’s a funny saying, that ignoring a problem won’t make it go away, Draco’s pretty sure that it isn’t inaccurate. He tried to keep a closer eye on his mother in the weeks that followed his talk with his father, but between work and taking care of Scorpius, things weren’t so different. To contact St Mungo’s seemed silly when Draco couldn’t pinpoint exactly what was wrong, so once again, he pushed that thought far away in the back of his mind.
“You know I never do.” Blaise winked at Draco and went to the bar, several heads turning as he went by. That man was too good looking for his own good.
”You’re a wizard, you git. You can use a sun shield spell! And no, I don’t want to spend my whole holiday looking at boring buildings.”
“Why’s that?” Harry asked, his voice a little closer than it was before. Draco could feel the back of the couch shift as Harry moved.
“We have our presentation tomorrow, there’ll be no time for paperwork,” Malfoy said in a slow voice, like he was talking to a child.
“But, what did you do then? Since I’ve been sleeping better, I mean. Except for these two nights.”
“What’s the harm in just one drink, Potter? I bet Finnigan will be very disappointed if you don’t show.”
“True,” Harry laughed, but still looked a little nervous.
“I’m dead. I’m so, so dead,” he gasped out. His words were met with a chuckle.
Suddenly, the idea hit Draco with full force, and he sputtered out, “Move in with me!”
- said, squeezing Draco’s leg gently, probably in a friendly manner but the touch sent shivers down his spine.
Harry looked embarrassed. “No, I was meeting Seamus actually but when I saw you I–– I couldn’t leave you alone like that.” He cleared his throat. “So you and Ron, being mates, I didn’t think that would happen.”
Harry smiled, placed a kiss in Draco’s hair and said, “I’m pretty sure they do!”
Draco swallowed through the constricted feeling in his throat. “So you say she won't get better?” He probably squeezed his mother’s hand too hard, but it was the only thing that kept him from losing it entirely.
“Never mind, Potter! She came up with something else, nothing that would work with you I think,” he said, casting a glance at Harry.
“Are you going to open your eyes any time soon?” Harry asked, sitting down beside him.
“Draco, I’ve got to tell you something. I — ”
Draco nodded. “I think it’s time.”
”Las Ramblas,” Draco answered.
Draco felt himself blush. “Amongst other places!” he hissed, not daring to look over at Harry.
Draco shook his head, not wanting to hear anymore. “I don’t need anybody’s help. I– I can fix this on my own.” He headed towards the Floo, this was too much. He heard that Harry was trying to stop him but he didn’t care, he just wanted to get away.
Michael snorted at the same time Draco coughed out a “No!” They both looked at him. “I mean yes! Yes, we’re going down. In the elevator.”
“Yes!” Potter cried out.
“Thanks, mate. I owe you one.”
Harry opened Draco’s trousers and helped him get them and his pants down enough to make his cock stand up over the waistband. Harry looked at him with his pupils dilated, only leaving a sliver of green around them. He lowered his head and licked Draco from base to tip, while he closed his hand around him. Draco let out a groan and fell back on the sofa, staring up at the ceiling, his hands in his own hair to stop him from reaching out to Harry.
Draco had changed his shirt three times before deciding what to wear for his date with Harry. It was times like these when he wished he had someone close to him to ask for advice. Astoria would’ve helped Draco pick out a good outfit and then told him to grow a pair before shoving him out the door.
“We do,” Malfoy said, with a nod. “I could probably do that speech in my sleep. Potter here, on the other hand…” He gestured towards Harry.
“Slow,” Harry whispered. “I’ve got you.”
“Good for you mate,” Ron said, ruffling Harry’s hair.
“I know what they’re called, but why are they so tight? It’s indecent!”
“It’s Mr Finley’s time off, I had to. Besides, I got to spend Christmas eve at home so I don’t mind working a couple of days before the new year.” Draco kissed her cheek in return. “And although late, I get to spend some time with you now as well,” he said, while taking off his coat and placing it on the hanger behind the door.
He had been visiting his mother earlier that day. She didn’t have that many days where she was cohesive for a longer period of time and Draco was happy if he only got one moment of clarity, though today he didn’t know if that was the case anymore.
He always went all out to get new robes for every occasion. Say what you want about Draco Malfoy, but there was nothing faulty about his fashion sense. This night he was wearing a dark maroon suit under an embroidered robe, which had an amazing fall, if he could say so himself. He could. And he did, to anyone who would listen. Pansy had left his side a little while ago, she’d spotted the Weasley girl and left mid sentence. She had no patience, that one. Perhaps she didn’t need it, Draco thought, as he saw the two girls sneak out of the the place.
“Most of them? What about the ones that I don’t get back?” he asked, worried.
“Oh! Sorry, I just figured everyone knew,” Ron said sheepishly.
Potter looked up from his shoes, a surprised look on his face. “Well, if you put it like that.” He was quiet for a couple of seconds. “Though it’s not like you to disregard blood relationships, is it?” He finally met Draco’s eyes, a small smirk playing on his lips.
All of Harry’s friends were scattered around the Leaky in different constellations. He sat and watched them with amusement, feeling happy that he actually took the time to see his friends after all, even though he’d been very busy at work and had that presentation looming over him. It was totally worth it, he thought, while looking around the room. Ron was dancing with Seamus and Dean, a weird dance that somehow involved circling around Luna, while she flopped her arms around in the middle. Draco was over by the bar chatting away with Hermione and Pansy. And he could see Ginny and Neville downing shots together with Blaise.
“No. He won’t be joining us,” Draco answered, and he could see the relief in Potter’s face.
“Grandma says she sees them all the time. I’ve never seen one and I wanted to see one for real,” Scorpius yawned.
Draco was sitting in a wobbly plastic chair in the cafeteria in St Mungo’s. He was stirring sugar in his tea only to have something to do with his fiddling hands. One of his colleagues from the potion apprenticeship program passed by him, only giving him a nod as a greeting. They knew better than to disturb Draco on days like these.
“Fuck. I totally forgot. I thought it was this Saturday?” Harry asked.
“Oh Harry, you won’t be walking anywhere tonight.”
“I didn’t date Charlie, you know that. We kissed, once!” Harry smiled, and started walking again. “My big bisexual awakening, I told you about that. Perhaps you were too busy dancing on the — “
So, no escaping then. “I’ll do my best, sir. I still have some work left to do.”
“Malfoy! I’m sorry, I’m so, so sorry! I can explain,” Harry all but screamed while jumping out of bed
Nilmy didn’t seem to want to answer because she sent worrying glances towards Lucius, and Draco knew immediately that he had something to do about it.
“As I said, we can only treat the symptoms, not the condition,” Potter said, looking forlorn.
They stood by the door examining the room. It was small, but it did contain a bed and a sofa. Draco didn’t dare look over at Harry’s expression, afraid that it would tell that Harry was really upset about having to share a room with him.
“You’re what? You’re sorry? Potter I’m s— ”
Thief - Our Lady Peace
Draco could honestly say that he didn’t handle things great after the war. He was broken and sad, all of his beliefs crumbling at his feet. He felt disoriented and lost, and when Potter had spoken in his favour at his trials, he didn't say thank you as a good person would. Instead, he lashed out and accused Potter of pitying him, and then left the courtroom in a hissy fit. Now, several years later, Draco could easily see why Potter had pitied him. Hell, even he pitied himself from time to time, that scared boy who couldn’t tell right from wrong even if it bit him in the arse. After several weeks of self-contemplating (and several bottles of Ogden’s), he tried to man up and apologize to Potter, but of course, Draco couldn’t get him to listen. He did try when they bumped into each other in the middle of Diagon Alley, but he was brushed off almost immediately. Draco had tried going after him, but he was surrounded by his fans who didn’t want to let him through. After an attempt at turning Potter around, he found himself pushed backwards by Potter's angry mob, tripping over his own feet and landing in a puddle of mud while people stood around chanting that he was a filthy Death Eater. The spread in the
Walking up the path to the Manor, he ignored the lilies and their distinct smell, only reminding him of an evening he wanted to forget. When he got nearer he could hear voices coming from the garden, and he could see the silhouettes of two people, one of them smaller and should be in bed by now.
Draco blushed, “Oh, fuck you, Potter.” He dragged the blanket over his head as he heard Harry’s soft laugh disappearing down the corridor.
Draco hugged his son and kissed him on top of his head. “That’s quite alright mother, thanks for looking after him. Will you be gone for long?”
“What notes?”
Draco snorted and then he didn’t even waste a second before he was nuzzling Potter’s neck, breathing in his scent and then started to kiss his way across Potter’s jaw to his mouth. Draco could feel the intake of breath before their mouths met in a soft kiss. It was nothing like Draco had anticipated. He’d never let himself think about how it would be to kiss Harry Potter, the knowledge that it would never happen was too hard to bear, so all of his fantasies had been vague, with a poor excuse that the black haired man he’d imagined was someone else.
“Let’s get you to bed. You can sleep for a while.” Draco led her towards the bed and laid down beside her, stroking her hair while she fell asleep. Draco stayed beside her listening to her slow breaths for a couple of minutes, still crying, making the pillow wet under him, before he dried his tears and left the bedroom.
Fashionably late, with a Muggle suit that looked like it was glued to his body, Draco was back at the Ministry, entering the ballroom with Blaise.
“Draco? What happened?” He stroked his fingers gently over Draco’s cheek, where he must still have a red mark from one of his mother’s rings which he’d forgotten to spell away.
“That’s perfectly fine. Sometimes it’s good to have a relative's point of view,” Potter smiled. “Um, will your father…?
“You’re drawing attention to us, Bert. Remember how we said that we should keep a low profile?” Harry whispered.
Draco slammed his folder down on the table, “Dora! Harry Potter is not fat. And even if he was, so what? The man saved the whole fucking world, can we please let him be? His hair is fine! His beard is fine! And I’m pretty sure he’s also a very fine lover!” Draco slumped down in his chair and dragged a hand over his face. Dora looked at him with wide eyes.
Harry looked at him with a sad expression, “I thought I did,” Harry whispered. “After all this time, I thought I did.” He slumped down in the chair again and buried his head in his hands.
“Draco, stop it. It’s alright. We’ve all been shitfaced sometimes. Don’t worry about it.” Harry shoved him lightly in the side.
“Good morning, Father,” Scorpius said politely, before slipping under the covers, and then he kneed Draco right between his legs.
“Are you bribing me with food?”
Draco smiled and shook his head.
After a couple of months, the mind healer cancelled the rest of his mother’s appointments, claiming there were no improvements to be made, just to let nature take its course. Draco had stormed off to St Mungo’s, yelled at the poor healer until Potter came and dragged him away to his office, slowly trying to explain what she meant by that.
“Obviously not! There must be some kind of mistake!” Draco tried to drag his hand back from Potter’s grip, waking him in the process.
Two hours later Draco could feel his head spin. He’d been talking to the wizard Shacklebolt wanted him to meet, and though he loved his job, there was a limit to how much time he could spend on explaining something that the other party clearly didn’t understand. He excused himself after agreeing they would continue this over owl, and headed to the bar for some much needed alcohol.
“People need other people in their life, there's nothing wrong with that.”
When Draco entered his house, he got a strange feeling that everything was off. Things weren’t where they supposed to be and there were clothes scattered everywhere. There was a strange looking pair of soft trousers hanging from the sofa, a pair of socks that couldn’t be his by the fireplace, a knitted sweatshirt that Draco never would wear was hanging over one of his lamps, and under one of the sofa cushions someone had hidden a pair of red pants. Gryffindor red, his mind supplied him. Draco ventured into the kitchen and found utensils in his drawers. Draco didn’t cook and had no need for utensils. He went to his bedroom and looked inside, scared of what he would find. The bed was a bit of a mess and a shirt lay on the floor. He picked it up and smelled it. The scent was familiar. He closed his eyes and a warm feeling settled over him. For a second he thought that all his memories would come back to him, but when he opened his eyes his mind was as blank as before.
“No, really,” Harry insisted, spreading his arms out. “Try the lift.”
It was fun, it was just
“No, it just applies it to your face automatically and gives you an everlasting glow for the day,” Malfoy said absently, like that was perfectly normal.
Harry stares at her some more. “Right…”
“No chance of that,” her sister said, looking up from her book and giving Parvati a meaningful glance.
“With me and Malfoy being – ” Harry hesitated.
Harry sits down next to her. “I’m not dating Malfoy.”
Malfoy continues, “No kissing unless we have to, but more physical affection…”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “You too?”
“I haven’t lived here since the summer,” Harry said defensively. “And it was like this before me.”
“My belongings?” Harry started tossing his clothes back in his trunk.
Actually, thinks Harry darkly, it’s
“Have to,” Harry explained.
“To the – it’s
” Harry said. He was always saying that to Malfoy in sixth year.
“Whatever,” Pansy snapped. “He’s also our heroine.”
“What are you
Malfoy has either forgotten about their joined hands or doesn’t care. Either way, Harry isn’t about to complain. He pushes down any stray thoughts about how that isn’t a strictly platonic way of thinking, and focuses on Malfoy’s excited voice, comforting and familiar as rain starts falling down amongst them.
“You don’t have to sound
“I was under duress, I take it back!” Malfoy squawked.
“Er, sure?”
“So does Pansy,” Malfoy replies. “She told me that she’s known me long enough to know I am completely head over heels for you, and everyone has known it since we were in school. Well. Everyone in Slytherin. Apparently I talked about you quite a lot at Hogwarts.”
Harry waves him off. “Don’t worry about it,” he tells Dean. He doesn’t say,
“I think we already are,” Harry said and then he waited.
“I have to go talk to Zabini or I think he’ll do something drastic,” Harry said, remembering. He staggered up, looking down wistfully at the warm bed and grabbed his robes out of his trunk before he moved towards the bathroom.
It was stupid.
“Wait, Potter dated Ginny Weasley too,” Pansy said. She started cackling. “
“To the garden,” Harry called out from behind his shoulder.
Harry must have imagined it.
He’s not just attracted to Malfoy in a passing way. He doesn’t just like having Malfoy as a friend. He is so obvious about that Sirius, Remus, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Pansy and fucking Dean Thomas and his sister knew before he did that he has more than a baseline compatibility with Malfoy and a sexual attraction to him.
“‘M not that drunk...don’t worry,” Harry assures him, planting a sloppy kiss on Ron’s cheek and giving him a cheeky smile. He wobbles a bit on the spot.
“How’re you two lovebirds doing?” she asks pleasantly. Harry starts coughing. Instead of helping him, Malfoy laughs.
Pansy’s lips twitched. “Of course.”
He pulls away, resting his forehead against Malfoy. Malfoy is breathing heavily. Harry can hear every intake of breath he takes.
One of Malfoy’s eyes cracked open.
him, and I – well, I did love Ginny. I’m bisexual. Hermione gave me a lot of pamphlets about it. I don’t know why I said that. I wish I hadn’t said that.”
“What’d you wish for?” Harry says. His voice is soft. This is a moment, he thinks, he will remember for a long time. Malfoy in the rain, hair sticking to his head, eyes bright, mouth turned down.
“I don’t remember,” Harry said honestly, and sank down to his knees.
, “and you only had to deal with Ginny, and she already likes you. Mostly. So, how’s that fair?”
“We already moved on with our friendship!” Harry says. “We, er, kissed in sixth year, and he ran away. So he didn’t like me back then, and he doesn’t like me back now.”
“Luna?” Harry leans over to put on his glasses. They’re smudged, for some reason. Of course they are. “Why?”
“She seems alright. I don’t think I’ll mind sharing with Padma, really.”
Malfoy set his trunk on the floor and surveyed the layout of the house loftily. “Well, I am going to be living here for two weeks.”
“Stalking me again, I see,” Malfoy said, voice quivering.
Pansy stared at him, and turned to Blaise. “Is he serious?”
“Er, hello,” Harry said, and had some sudden doubts about this plan.
“What if he says no?” Dean looks at Harry nervously.
“Neville,” says Harry, surprised. “What are you doing here?”
“It does have my name,” Malfoy said smugly, turning to him.
“You can’t manage a proper smirk,” Malfoy explains. “You always look like a twitchy rabbit. It’s funny, really.”
“Why do you live only to disappoint me?” Malfoy asked him sadly.
he, anyway, he never had before.
, Harry thinks to himself, willing his heart rate to slow back down. Malfoy’s drunk. He won’t remember any of this in the morning.
“Well, don’t say all
“Potter,” Malfoy says softly, and then changes his mind and says, “Harry. Do you want this for real?”
“You think that
“Good God, Potter,” Malfoy said, appalled. “You live in this squalor? What have you done to this place?”
Malfoy looked at him and almost smiled. “Trying clothes on is a formality, you idiot. You’re lucky I’m not making you get a tailor.” But he let Harry lead them towards the paying desk. The shop assistant, a dark-skinned girl with two braids and a piercing in her eyebrow, took in their enormous load of clothes with raised eyebrows, and then took Malfoy in with a sudden, shocked smile. To Harry’s amazement, she rushed over to them, and hugged Malfoy, and Malfoy hugged her
If Malfoy’s talking to Pansy, he needs to talk to Hermione.

“I cannot believe
The week before Christmas holidays, they all ended up gathered in the common room, working on homework or playing chess or in Harry’s case, sitting in a chair with Malfoy perched on its arm. He was listening to Malfoy complain about his History of Magic class. His feet were in Harry’s lap and Harry was tracing a circle around his slender ankle, because he wanted to and by some miracle Malfoy wasn’t pushing him away.
They had reached the wooden doors and the statues. Harry said the password and they moved aside. He could have sworn the knight was laughing at him.
Pansy looks vastly entertained at this piece of information.
Malfoy comes even closer, so he’s standing in between Harry’s legs. He’s close enough that Harry could kiss him. Before Harry can gather his courage to do it,
“Oh, fuck you, Potter,” Malfoy snapped, and then he pinched his eyebrows together and let out a long sigh. “So,” said Malfoy now, quieter. “So what? You want to stay up all night and braid each other’s hair? You want to be –
the people to get stuck with!”
That is, thinks Harry, a part of it, but more than that, Camille’s Cakes is pretty much the reason he and Malfoy are together now. He owes Dean, Dean’s sister, and Seamus a whole lot.

“It makes sense to me,” Harry said, hurt.
Malfoy looked startled. “It’s vanilla and jasmine. The face wash my mother gave me.”
The look on Malfoy’s face was priceless and absolutely worth it and Harry had to work hard not to start laughing. “I don’t believe you. Impossible. I will march up to the school and demand to know the truth from the Sorting Hat. You wouldn’t have lasted a
Harry decided to leave it. “No, it’s just,” he said, “I thought wizards would use spells for that sort of thing.” Wizards like the Malfoys, at least; Ginny and Hermione never had.
. Harry muttered something indistinct darkly.
“Try those on,” Malfoy said distractedly an hour later, surveying a mannequin modelling a red jumper with his head tilted to the side.
, Malfoy, I’m not going to sleep with him again, or tell him anything.”
He waited for Malfoy to spit out something nasty about how he wasn’t surprised, but instead, Malfoy said, surprised like he couldn’t help it, “Me too.”
Malfoy groaned, and ate his syrup-drenched pancakes instead of answering. But Harry sent an Owl to Andromeda, and a few hours later, they were standing in front of her cottage and she was opening the door.
for him. He
“You know how you were after the war,” said Hermione. “How you’ve been lately.”
, Malfoy saying he’s wanted to kiss Harry since fifth year, Malfoy telling him not to leave, Malfoy giving him his mother’s ring, Malfoy kissing him back. “Malfoy and I are in love with each other,” Harry says out loud.
“It is distracting,” said Malfoy very sternly. “I am still hungover. In the past few minutes I have been put through the wringer, emotionally speaking. And now you seem to think I’m straight.”
“I can’t,” wheezes Malfoy. His cheeks are pink and his nose is scrunched up and Harry can’t look away from him.
Harry stared at his bed, stolen by a diabolical, merciless, and snoring Slytherin, and then at Malfoy’s, which was really just too big for him, Harry reasoned. He took off his own shoes and socks and then his shirt and jeans, tossing them in a random direction, and walked over to Malfoy’s bed.
“I don’t think it’s a source of shame to you,” Harry said, grinning. “You did say that since fifth year – ”
“How do you people even get in here?” Harry says wearily. “And haven’t you got a Quidditch match, Gin?”
“It’s alright. I have Sirius and Remus.” Sirius and Remus are, technically,
“Yes,” Hermione said hesitantly, “because you were paying so much attention to him that you knew something was wrong.”
“That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard in my life,” says Hermione flatly.
“I understand if you would not,” McGonagall said. “If you do, let me know. And I assume you will be going into the Aurors after school – ”

“I’ve had dreams about you sucking my dick,” Malfoy repeats.
“Well,” Harry said.
“I can
“I know,” Malfoy said. “You said, at the – at the trial.”
fine, because if it was fine then Malfoy would have thrown a fit and been all dramatic and talked about how alone he would be. It was the thought of Malfoy sitting in the common room alone that made Harry blurt out, “You can go with me.”
Malfoy sneers. The expression is so familiar Harry feels something inside him settle. “Have you forgotten already we’re supposed to be a couple? No wonder you have so much trouble finding dates.”
“Because I had to make fun of you, it was my moral duty,” Malfoy informed him virtuously.
, you know, you have to know, you
Malfoy checked the textbook carefully and measured out a phial of powdered root of asphodel. He put it in their potion, stirred, and let it stew for the requisite ten minutes. “Mother’s in France and she has business there. I told her to stay. She wanted me to come there but – ” He hesitated. “I’d rather stay here.”
“You’re just pretending, and now you’ve realised that wish you were actually dating him,” Hermione finishes sympathetically.
Harry looked out at the field in front of them, blinked against sudden sunlight, took a deep breath in and let it out. “Yeah.”
Harry looked for Malfoy, whose white-blond head was always distinctive in every crowd, and found him near the Patil twins, Daphne, and Anthony, with an awful lot of bottles of Firewhiskey beside him. Harry nodded at Dean, who went over to Terry and Susan, and made his way over to Ron and Hermione, even though his feet felt like they wanted to keep walking over to Malfoy.
It was fairly creepy, actually, Harry thought, but Hermione looked fascinated.
There’s a silence. Harry thinks he might have actually shocked Malfoy into not talking, which is a first. They’ve never really talked about what they are, but Harry had thought
Inside was a wide, airy common room with long windows and lanterns that McGonagall lit with a flick of her wand. The flames in the fireplace were dancing merrily, and there were a couple of armchairs around it, as well as couches and tables spread out with high bookshelves. There were two spiral staircases, one on the left and one on the right, both leading up to what must be the dormitories. There were no house colours. The lack of red and gold felt like another loss, even though it didn’t matter.
Harry rolls his eyes the way Remus does when Sirius sleeps in. Malfoy extends his hand – long, pale, slim – and waits for Harry impatiently. Harry hesitates, then entwines his hand with Malfoy’s. It doesn’t mean anything, not really, but Harry feels his heartbeat quicken. He hopes his hand isn’t sweaty. (Malfoy’s isn’t. It’s cool, and soft, probably because of the lotion he applies at night.)
The Slytherin team were finishing up their practice when Harry arrived at the field, chattering with each other as they walked off the field, leaving it empty behind them. He saw Malfoy sitting at the top of the stands, the sunlight gleaming on his hair.
Harry tried not to smile but he didn’t think he quite managed it. There was something odd happening to his chest; it felt like it was about to expand, explode. He thought about how ridiculous it was to be thinking of Malfoy as, well, Malfoy, when he looked like that. He sat up carefully before he and Malfoy banged heads and had to go to Madam Pomfrey again, and sat cross-legged, stretching out his arms and rolling his neck and shoulders.
“What?” Malfoy says, turning around, his words coming out choked and shocked sounding.
looked in a mirror?”
“Oh my God, you did,” Harry said, delighted. “You had a crush on me in fifth year. I thought you hated me.”
“I get on with Blaise.”
“Yeah, you’re not going to get any,” said Harry.
“I’m not using my celebrity for manipulation, though,” Harry said.
Zabini laughed breezily and then in the next moment seemed to become steely-eyed and serious, stopping and turning to Harry with his arms crossed. “No. I came here for Draco.”
,” Malfoy said again, turning pink.

Harry resorted to taking out the Marauder’s Map again, watching Malfoy’s dot and the way it made sure not to be in the same room as Harry for longer than necessary.
didn’t tell you to wake up,” Harry said, but he followed Malfoy up to their room, and fell asleep smiling.
Harry blanched. “Just do a spell,” he said, pointing in the general direction of his face.
in sixth year. I had a crush on Ginny! I have never, ever, had a crush on Malfoy in my life.”
“I’m sorry about whatever I said last night,” Malfoy starts.
It was like a punch to the gut. Harry stared at the door. He thought there was a buzzing in his ears. He did not dare look in Malfoy’s direction.
He’s forgotten to put his glasses on. Everything is more than a little blurry.
shacked up with Gryffindors,” Pansy said. “I digress. The point is, he’s ours. So when he said he wanted to go back to this school, I pointed out that a crazed maniac who had tried to kill him in a girls’ loo was also going back to this school, and when he ignored me, I made Blaise come here to look after him. What are
Sirius starts coughing.

“I can sleep it off,” Harry tried, following Malfoy to the door out of the common room. “Give me a napkin, I think my nose is bleeding.”
“I mean, I know,” Harry amended, “I know I love him, I’m – sorry.”
“Then,” said Harry drowsily, letting his eyes drift closed, “it’s alright.”
“Not really,” says Pansy, unconcerned. “But I’d rather be distracted than have to sit there and think about everything that went wrong.”
and you can’t change that, any of it.”
“He’s a two-year old, Malfoy.”

stupid. They’re not going to believe we’re really engaged, except for Thomas, apparently.” He starts laughing again. “And none of my friends would ever think that.”
“Grimmauld Place,” Malfoy repeated, startled. “The Blacks’ place. That’s right – it was yours, after – I don’t know, Potter.”

“Oh,” says Harry quietly.
. God, maybe he
“I don’t care,” Blaise proclaimed, “I’ve given my heart away. Although I would appreciate some tips.”
“You haven’t sucked my dick yet,” Malfoy says, eyes soft and hands tugging at Harry’s just-been-shagged-hair and eyebrows drawn together.
“My name.” Malfoy blinks owlishly. “My last name, anyhow. You never call me Draco.”
Malfoy tapped his empty glass of Firewhiskey and muttered a spell; it transformed into a pair of glasses that looked identical to Harry’s.
“Morbid curiosity,” said Harry and watched him laugh. He didn’t ask what Malfoy’s nightmare had been about.
. I had to learn all pureblood family genealogy. I can tell you the name of Terry Boot’s third aunt, and Susan Bones’s cousin, and Longbottom’s great-grandfather.”
Harry hadn’t known much about it at all. The Dursleys hadn’t exactly been the type to tell him about things like that. “Wizards have a Potion for that?”
?” Malfoy said skeptically. Harry looked back to see him settling on the long wooden table of the dining room, the one they’d hardly used in the Order, his ankles crossed and his hands braced on the edge of the table.
It was as though Grimmauld Place had been waiting for Malfoy; everything seemed brighter and more alive. The gas lamps lit up by themselves and the chandelier sparkled despite the fine layer of dust hanging over it, the house made anew by Malfoy’s obvious happiness to be here. Still, none of that could hide the disrepair Grimmauld Place had fallen into.
“Oh, I thought you were Parvati from faraway,” Daphne said, disgruntled. “Welcome back, Potter, Weasley.”
.” Snape had sneered, but lacking any sort of real threat.
Students start filing in, chattering and whispering to themselves, ties undone and sleeves rolled up. Harry watches them absently, then notices Neville, now a Herbology professor, pushing past them politely towards Harry. Many of the kids start gazing at him dreamily.
He missed Sirius and Lupin so much that he sat down behind one of the greenhouses and let himself cry like he hadn’t since fifth year, mourn what had been lost and what would never return. And the stupidest thing of all, the thing he’d known all this time, the thing he kept thinking was,
“Uh, Harry?” Ron called out. “We heard shouting. What’s going on?”
“I’m not leaving,” Harry says, then, more quietly, “Not ever. You don’t have to worry about that.”
“Hi, Harry,” she says, “what’s this about, then? Not that I mind seeing you, or having an excuse to leave work, Merlin knows those vultures at the Ministry – ”
“Ah.” Rafael’s expression doesn’t change, but Harry can feel a certain shift in the mood. “Congratulations.”
“What?” Harry said, amused.
Hermione smiled at him. “I only feel bad for Harry. Of
