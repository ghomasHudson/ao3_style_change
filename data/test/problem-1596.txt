Still, he didn't see Draco anywhere during the whole morning. It had been a bit strange not seeing him in one of the few classes they had together, but many things could have happened. He recalled a day when Draco had fallen asleep over his homework in the library and completely missed two classes.
"I know you like him, okay?" His voice was very nasal and sad, almost as if he had wanted to say this to Harry for a while now "But that doesn't make it better and it doesn't change who he is or what he did. Harry, Dumbledore is dead because of him!"
"Recovering quickly, his parents are coming tonight. Please, everyone should act as if nothing had happened"
There was silence, both Slytherins held each other's gazes until Elliot finally nodded, defeated. Harry hadn't thought about the blood -or hair, or skin- the attacker had taken, but it could be useful.
"No, it wasn't" Harry got up from the bed as well, his feet touching the cold floor. It felt almost as cold as the air hitting his damp cheeks. "You hurt people, you think less of others, you were horrible, you never cared! You only switched sides to help yourself!"
Draco didn't seem bothered by that, but was staring intently into his eyes "Am I living up to the expectations?"
Lucius moved back, staring at her with confusion on his face "What do you mean? I have always given him anything he wanted"
"Don't you like surprises? I just..." Harry gave him a brief look "Let's hurry, I can see you are about to freeze"
Neither of them wanted to touch the unfinished bathrooms, so they would either have to wait until magic was available for them or ask the aurors if it was okay to hire someone. Luckily they had the en-suite bathroom and the one in the lower floor that had been remodeled by Harry already. They were simple, but clean and tidy.
The house needed tiding because Draco was going to be living there. Not only that, but the first impression was an important one. What if he felt he made a horrible mistake the minute he got there? Harry didn't want that. He wanted to make him feel welcome, the way he had never felt in his own 'home'.
precisely. Dumbledore had just... not told him things. Important things. He didn't want to talk about it, not when his body felt warm and awake. Not when he was with him. Not while they still had issues to resolve.
"Harry, I didn't want any of it to happen. I-... I know it's hard for you to understand but... For it to be believable, I had to-"
There was a small laugh from the other bed "Yeah, pretty much." Noah had taught him a whole lot about the muggle world, and about gender and sexuality. He had no idea that muggles had words for everything or how... Fluid everything
Once outside, Draco's hands were all over. Almost literally. The slytherin tried to pull up his shirt and try to see his side, clearly distressed.
" Draco sneered, his eyes set over Harry's shoulder, shooting daggers to the other two that waited a few meters away. His friends knew it was better to let him handle the
It was scary how entertaining and well put together it all was. And it was done without magic! The best part wasn't the movie itself, of course, it was cozying up together in the couch they both bought with a blanket and a warm bowl of popcorn.
Harry seemed conflicted, as if he wanted to object but probably saw the truth in his words. Hogwarts' new protections made snow not get inside the Tower but it was still freezing.
"You know we don't mind, right?" Noah was arching an eyebrow at them. "And if... If you have any questions about coming out and stuff, I think I might be of help"
Harry tried to deflect that subject, still unsure as to how he would take seeing the mark on his body. Everything was too raw.
"We're obligated to search his room regularly and with no warning" The man almost seemed sorry about it. "The prisoner might hide something. We've had cases"
"What?" Draco said, feeling his gaze while they took another hallway, the second floor bathroom closer and closer.
People were staring, of course, and doing nothing. It reminded him of himself and how he had stood by many situations without doing anything. The memories of muggles and muggle borns being tortured on his house's floor came to mind. In his memories, sometimes aunt Bella was holding the wand, others it was Voldemort or his father. It was rarely himself.
“this might help” Malfoy walked towards him with what looked like a small vial. When Harry raised his brow in question, Malfoy added “shrinking solution”
Instead of being satisfied with his discovery of the letter, Harry felt like he was intruding. Sometimes he forgot that Malfoy was someone's son – probably because he never had that feeling. He sighed as he put the letter back exactly as it was and closed the bag.
When he woke up, he felt extremely tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. Malfoy was already awake and had apparently just finished showering.
"Come, Potter" Malfoy said as he lowered his hand for Harry to step on. Harry did as bid, and Malfoy had to carry his robes and wand before following Snape out of the door.
Hermione sighed "It'll just be for a while, Harry, and then it'll be over" she tried to reassure him, and he simply nodded. It's never over. He thought.
"I was wondering whether it was necessary to make you Head Boy. I mean the potion will only last a few days, then what? Do you have to be Head Boy till the end of the year?"
"Oh, haha, you're lucky I have fast reflexes," said Harry as he walked on the bed to the further end and sat down.
“who said you’ll drink it? I don’t trust your clumsiness Potter, and you also don’t know the Manor. I’ll know how to move and where to go”
Transfiguration was a complete bore, since it was with the Ravenclaws, and Harry had no one to stare at. However, Ron promised to tell him all about Apparition later, and Harry couldn't wait.
P.S there's a spell with the letter than can transport you here to the dorms. Come at midnight. Ron and I will be waiting.
As soon as they got to Hogwarts, Harry breathed in, closing his eyes. This was his home, he grew up here, and it was the safest place for him. He knew he was very lucky to have been a wizard. He hadn't stopped thinking about what it'd have been like if he weren't, and he'd shuddered every time.
A few minutes later, he felt the blonde slipping under the covers. Harry waited patiently. He muttered a tempus charm to check the time, 23:55. He had to go.
Malfoy got up from the couch, walked over, and sat on the edge of the bed. He was clearly waiting for Harry's reply, but Harry was in shock. He thought he didn't have to deal with any of this anymore, he thought he was going to enjoy his time at Hogwarts and not have to worry about anything except his exams, perhaps.
"Do you love me?" Malfoy asked simply as if he's asking Harry about the weather, and Harry choked and started coughing, his eyes watering slightly.
"Hm" Draco decided it was best not to explain anything further, they were there to enjoy each other... The thought made him blush so he focused on the fireplace.
He was well aware that if Draco had said hurtful things to him, he would be furious and hurt as well. So, yeah. They needed to talk, and they needed to know where the other one stood. Even if it ruined everything. Even if it meant they would never kiss again.
. This wasn't even Noah's house. But if things were as dire as he imagined, perhaps McGonagall had been wise.
Draco knew Harry was waiting for him, it was his free period after all. He had thought about going to meet him at first, but after thinking about it he realized he couldn't. Not without making something right.
you thinking, Potter. Please stop" He whispered, one of his feet touching his knee and pushing it slightly.
"Your son broke the rules of the school, placing himself in danger. We did everything we could to keep everyone safe, Mr. Malfoy. And I
Hermione smiled "They are also betting on what his Patronus will be. Ron thinks it will be a ferret"
There was a brief nod, and Draco knew that was all he could hope for. With a hand on Harry's arm, he pulled very gently. "We should go find Pansy. See you later, mom, father"
Harry opened the doors just barely and slid inside with him. The main hall was barely lit and whispers could be heard from the hallways. The inside of the Castle was a complete opposite from the outside. Teachers were rushing, Aurors talking and probably running to use the fireplace inside the headmistress' office to report back to the ministry.
"He is" She paused "the heir of house Black and house Malfoy" A little smile crept up on her face as she slipped back into the bed "He's everything we hoped for, Lucius..."
Maybe if he hadn't been thinking about Harry, or Charms, he would have avoided what was about to unfold.
"Why does she do it?" Draco asked, staring at the grass underneath his shoes. The garden was one of the few places that felt close to freedom. Sadly, he felt like a bird inside a never-ending cage.
Draco stopped, smiled and started to untie his boots "Now, you are going to do a little spell, Potter"
She nodded, placing her hands on her lap and trying to find the words. "So, something is going on with Malfoy?"
"I did... I just... I thought maybe..." Draco sighed "I guess deep down I knew the Dark Lord was insane. I just... Wanted you to know"
Having insomnia was weird, like trying to put your body to sleep in the middle of a fire. It felt unnatural. Harry found it frustrating, and would much rather talk to Malfoy or just do something instead of trying to fall asleep...
There was a small silence because Harry didn't know if just tease him in front of his friends -he didn't, feeling it would show too much- and his friends didn't know how to handle Malfoy at all.
Slowly, incredibly slowly, it passed. He couldn't pin point the exact moment when he started feeling the air inside his lungs, but when he did, the panic left immediately. His heartbeat was still running but it would go down, it always did. Why was he so scared? He wasn't in danger anymore, he was alright. He was in his house, no one could harm him in there. Right?
all at once, but Harry couldn't just bottle everything down and then snap at him and say those things.
"Who? Ah. Yes, I guess" Elliot didn't want to talk about anything involving Malfoy "How are you feeling?"
in poltergeists or ghosts so they made movies about them, which didn't make them any less scary. "I wasn't scared, I was scandalized"
Unbelievable enough, he still felt that way, that shameless confidence. Even when his father said something venomous, something that should make him feel ashamed or guilty. He couldn't tell what had changed, exactly, but something had.
Sorry for the small delay - I had the worst migraine and a deadline from College so I kind of spent the last two days in bed and dying from stress.
Harry grabbed him by his shirt, pulled him behind a tapestry and kissed him. It was a small peck on the lips but it felt incredible. "Let them know you like I know you"
The map showed Malfoy sitting alone at a corridor. It wasn't odd, but Harry almost hoped to see him with someone after what had happened at the library. Worry was the one thing inside of his chest, worry that maybe the incident hadn't been what Noah described, that it had been worse. What if Draco was truly hurt? Or ashamed, or worse. He had no clue why other people needed to hurt Malfoy like that. Being mad? Yeah, he had been pretty mad before -and he had been pretty bad at Malfoy too- but never enough to be cruel. Not like that.
"It's fine" She gave him a look "I know you can't really play Quidditch this year or anything but would you like to train later this week? I could use the tips"
Harry placed a hand on his arm, trying to help him relax but the slytherin's body was incredibly tense.
Yeah, Draco knew exactly how many letters he had. They arrived on mondays, wednesdays, fridays and twice on the weekends. And he was unable to answer. There were many reasons, but how to put them into words? They were clear to him every time he held his quill and tried to press it against the parchment.
"Granger went to sleep a while ago" Malfoy said, his back still turned to Harry and his body under the covers. Harry knew how strange it was to see him there, in his bed, and still it felt as if it had to be this way.
"People change" Harry whispered, his arms all around him. Merlin, how he wanted to be buried inside his arms forever. Last night when they had been kissing so fiercely he hadn't meant to stop it, but panic rose from his chest. What if Harry didn't like him-his body? What if he saw the Mark and got so repulsed he never spoke to him again? And worst of all: what if they slept together and then broke up? They weren't even properly together, not boyfriends - how could they ever be? - and Draco didn't feel comfortable just.... Even if his body needed it. And it needed it so badly.
"Nice?" They both chuckled, and took a sip from their cups. The kitchen was the most used space, so it was the cleanest but it wasn't anywhere near done. There were too many rooms in that house, too much dust and memories.
. How else could Harry be how he was? But he knew sometimes children have little in common with their parents.
"I never..." His mind was still a mess, there was no reality in which he would ever forget that night. "Draco?"
Harry had no clue what he had to talk about, nothing had happened. They almost died, big deal, that was his life.
Hermione sighed, giving an uneasy stare towards Ginny. Did everyone see her as a child? Draco didn't quite mind having the Weasley girl helping them. Well, he felt
“Why else? Power is power. Oh, how sweet, you think this is the first time I've done this?” He laughed, shaking his head “I wouldn't attempt something so big without practicing first” He shrugged “I could have done this smoothly, but you had to intervene”
Harry sat up when he heard voices coming into the room, and quickly reached for his wand to secure the curtains...
He had no clue if that was a good thing to say, but it got him a small sad chuckle from the blonde so it was worth it.
Why? Why did Harry have such a way to make him feel things? How come he was so good at getting to the core of things, stripping them down, making it easy, simple. Draco turned his face and pressed it against Harry's chest, trying to calm himself. He was unable to hide his true emotions in front of him.
"Alright, my turn before Harry decides to fall in love with me" Harry decided to give Draco a look to reassure him, and the slytherin seemed to relax at that, almost as if saying
He laughed and that made Harry smile a little bit, his arms around Draco. He had started to rub his back a bit, pulling him even closer.
He was Marked, for God's sake, that clearly should be enough for all those pure bloods to still consider him of
"No, Narcissa. He is a man now, let him face whatever he has to on his own. He made that pretty clear, no?"
Harry laughed at how offended he was by that and maybe he should be a little bit angry but he didn't believe Draco actually hated... Well, muggle borns as much. He clearly hated muggles.
from the slytherin. Harry almost expected him to complain or say something mean about house elves. He didn't.
"Where's Ron?" he asked suddenly, they hadn't talked since breakfast and he wasn't sure he had actually listened. Hermione didn't look up from her notes.
"I am not..." Harry frowned but stopped, looking away while Draco took off his vest and shoes. "Maybe a little bit"
Draco stared at him as they walked, the school fading in the background. Hogsmeade wasn't that far away at all, but Draco was starting to feel cold all over.
"What happened?" Hermione looked really worried, opening the curtains and staring at him. It was a bit of an invasion of privacy, but after everything they had been through that didn't quite mean the same anymore.
"Of course" Harry stared at him, a small smile on his lips "I thought you knew how to do it. I mean... I don't know, aren't you always bragging about something?"
Harry took off his shoes slowly and then stepped on the frozen ice. It felt cold, but it didn't make his body cold. Huh,
Laughter shook Elliot as much as Noah. Both of them smiling at the inside jokes and shared memories. They knew each other for so long now. Elliot still remembered how hard it had been for him to express his truest self to the world. The failed Yule Ball was a nice memory. That student dying later that year was a bad memory. Noah crying in his arms because his parents didn't understand him wasn't a good memory. The war that took most of their youth wasn't a good memory.
Ever since the moment they got there, Bell had seemed in complete control of the situation. Right then things seemed to change. Harry knew the moment he needed was approaching, so he readied his body to jump, to run towards his wand.
He could feel Harry's gaze on him, but he didn't feel the other boy stressed or tense or anything like that. Finally, the last pieces of fabric fell away, and the skull and snake were visible.
Harry read the letter again. And again. He could see the places where Draco had pressed the ink harder, or the places where his perfect traces looked insecure. He had shared so much in a small letter... Even the things he didn't say were revealing.
She looked up, looking extremely exhausted. Harry almost got the impression that she was completely spent, unable to get angry or sad or... He could understand that numbness. He sat on a chair next to her bed, where he assumed Noah had been sitting and stared at her. It wasn't easy to talk to someone that had had her wand pointed at both him and Draco, with the intent of possibly hurting them. But, at the same time, he didn't hate her. Not one bit.
"Students, what happened today was terrible but the teachers already have a lead and will be putting a stop to it before it even escalates"
He sat quickly next to Ron and smiled to his friend that gave him a confused look, clearly wanting to know where had he been. "Later" he whispered trying to avoid that conversation, and opened his book with no idea as to what chapter they were on.
He didn't find the words, or the explanation he so sorely needed but it didn't seem to matter. Before he could look up, Harry was right there, arms around his body. It was surprising, being comforted like this even if he was being an absolute jerk.
Harry sighed trying not to get mad, because an argument between them could very easily end up with both of them in the infirmary and he had no intentions of drawing attention to himself.
"Yeah I hate Malfoy like everyone else" Harry could almost hear Ron's shrug "But it was really not cool... Do you think it's true?"
"But not us?" She kept smiling, as if they were speaking of the weather. It wasn't that she was bad, or unattractive -Draco could see the beauty in her- but he felt nothing when she was close. And he knew she didn't feel anything either.
Neither one of them wanted to touch the Room of Requirement again, but... it was in Harry's mind. That room had a history of people plotting inside of it. Of course, he would agree with Draco and go to every other room, trying to avoid that place.
. Not only that, but why were they choosing for him? True, he was only eighteen and sometimes he didn't feel equipped to survive adult life, but that didn't mean they could... Tell him what to do anymore!
Harry wanted to say he wasn't choosing anything, that he hadn't chosen this but he didn't find the words. Because finding the words meant admitting something
"I know you want to be out there with them, and you had no reason to stay behind. I know why you did"
Harry blinked and nodded, looking down at the brown and black wand that the boy was holding. How come he had it after class? Maybe Slughorn had forgotten to ask it back. It wouldn't be weird, that professor was extremely clueless sometimes.
. Elliot sat up and tried to find something to change the subject, he was completely sick of hearing about that stupid girl. He hated her, actually. But saying that would probably create tension between them and he didn't want that. So he just kept his feelings for himself. Like always.
"She told me she was going to the game, but she was still in the common room when I left. If she left after I did maybe she saw something or someone?"
"No" She chuckled before giving him a more serious look "He's a pure blood from an old family. That's... they are definitely not... He could lose that, I think"
"I invited him in, Lucius" Narcissa crossed her arms over her chest, staring at her husband "What did you expect me to do? He was sulking, you told me he had a panic attack"
He got to do that at Hogwarts though. Quidditch, and practice and just... having his friends around. Merlin, he was so alone now. He was so old. He wasn't, but he felt like he was. So incredibly old.
" He could hear the amusement -or curiosity?- in his voice and wanted to scream at him "Is something wrong?"
; he ran his fingertips very carefully, hearing Harry's breath stop from time to time, his small shudders. If Draco looked up and saw his face he would probably lose it, so he focused on his skin. It wasn't difficult to have darker skin than he had, but Harry was perfect against him, a perfect contrast of who they were. Opposites, of the best kind. Draco put his lips to Harry's chest and he heard the boy whimper. Merlin. With his hands on his shoulders he kept kissing, figuring out his skin and the feel of it against his. This was all new, but Draco for once decided to shut down that place in his brain that was filled with logic. If his body knew what had to be done, he was going to follow. Harry would never harm him, and in that safety he could afford the cost of not doing the most reasonable thing.
Another voice said, it was a male voice but Harry couldn't see him. Draco moved a bit next to him. Did he know who it was? Shit he wanted to ask him, but speaking would probably expose them. "
"It all looks the same to me" Draco went back to writing but with a smirk on his face "Your drawings are almost a perfect copy"
Draco knew he could push him away, but he didn't. How could he? He had been wishing for a hug like this ever since they parted.
Neither of them had a real choice of coming back or not. Malfoy's trial had decided he had to finish his school before paying for his crimes during the war and some charity work he really couldn't remember or care.
Harry nodded, giving up, knowing he was probably right. There was another thing that roamed his mind -
Once the kettle boiled, Harry poured two cups of tea trying to keep his mind occupied. Living in Grimmauld Place on his own hadn't been easy, and sadly he hadn't put too much effort on the reforms.
That was Harry, awfully tidy. Sometimes, they would be laying on the bed, both lazy after having breakfast, and Harry would glance towards the night stand and the mugs there. It wasn't like he was going to say anything to him, or complain for
"Huh?" Harry frowned, looking back at the map and trying to see whatever it was that Draco was seeing. "What do you mean?"
Draco had no clue what it was that led her to believe he was happy. He was, of course, but he wasn't someone that showed that on his face. There was nothing different about him. How could she tell? Could everyone tell?
"Yes, I did" Draco nuzzled his neck, pulling back and laying next to him. His hands searched for the sheets and he quickly covered himself up to his waist. Harry found it endearing, but didn't comment.
Suddenly, Harry moved his hand faster, more determined, making Draco's brain completely shut down. He kissed him as well as he could, feeling as if his body were chasing stars, the brightest and warmest of them all. Without thinking, but feeling, he pressed a bit tighter around Harry's erection, hearing him moan and slightly move his hips towards his hand. Fuck.
Was it flirting? Were they flirting? Harry wanted to believe they were, but at the same time he knew how awful he was at flirting and he didn't want to ruin it.
Draco didn't answer, putting his wand away, already tired of trying and failing. Harry was sure he was going to be able to produce a Patronus, but he didn't know how long it would take. A month? Two? Perhaps it wouldn't happen until Draco got a memory that made him feel truly happy.
Harry groaned, slightly ashamed and sat back, releasing him from his hold "It's hard with just one hand!"
Harry seemed to perk up at that, looking at him like he did when he was about to kiss him. Oh, Draco's heart skipped a beat when he saw him staring like that.
Narcissa did her very best to try and not smile "Your son is as stubborn as you are... I know we don't want this life for our child but we cannot lose him, Lucius. Not again"
He remembered Cho, but had he ever held hands with Cho? And that was different too, it's not like he was going to kiss Malfoy.
They made the rest of the way in silence, a nice one, being there for each other without having to say or do anything. It felt good, it felt as if he wasn't alone anymore. Or at least not like before.
"Nah, it's alright. I don't know if I'm any good at it" Oh, but he was. Harry leaned forward and planted a kiss on his cheek, making Draco lean back and turn slightly so they could kiss.
Harry found himself pushing past the students to the front of the crowd, not to stare but to try and help the teachers and Madame Pomfrey. He was so used to people trying to murder him and things going wrong that it almost felt good to see everything fall into place again. Almost. Seeing that kid there... There was so much grief already, and someone was causing more? Harry wasn't sure about his future, but in that moment he wished to be an auror to stop anyone from hurting anybody ever again.
Draco told him to wear the cloak only to sneak inside the common room. Not that anyone would bat an eye at it anymore, they all knew Harry had been in there and he himself had been inside the Tower. Besides, people didn't seem to care about their houses as much as they did before. Yes, it was important, but people wanted to be around those they loved, same house or not.
Less than a minute -or ten minutes? Seconds? Draco couldn't tell- he was also coming with shuddered breaths. Harry collapsed on top of him, incapable of holding himself with his hands, tired and pleased.
The past few days he had had so many aurors on his house he almost didn't expect to see Draco there. He was the first thing he saw, of course. And then he realized his hands were tied behind his back, like a lowly criminal. Harry wanted to complain, to argue, to
Harry couldn't just leave him there alone, so he walked back to the empty space next to Draco and sat down.
"Alright, Malfoy, you win" He untied his shoes and used his wand to cast the spells the other boy was instructing him. One to repel water, another one to keep their feet warm. Where they going to do what he thought?
"clearly" said Malfoy with a snicker as he held Harry up and leveled him with his face. Harry didn't shriek this time as he was becoming used to Malfoy grabbing him like that.
"no, no" Harry raised his hands defensively "I heard a knock on the door and when I came out of the bathroom, I saw him kissing you" he explained "I didn't want to interfere" he continued.
Malfoy gave an exasperated sigh "I won't be late" he said while rubbing his forehead, clearly annoyed. He strode to his bed and grabbed Harry with his right hand. Harry felt like being on a broom. He flew up while the cold air rushed through his hair. Malfoy brought him up to his face and, to Harry's shock, gave a little chuckle "I never thought I'd see the day when famous Harry Potter would depend on me for entertainment."
Malfoy had gone to take a shower. About half an hour later he got out and saw Harry sitting on the bed with a puzzled expression. "What's the matter now?" Malfoy questioned while drying his hair with a towel.
They hurried to the Great Hall, Ron sulking because he has apparition, and Harry teasing both of thembecause they still had classes to attend, while he had finished for the day. However, Hermione didn't seem to mind.
Malfoy immediately turned, looking at Harry with a shocked expression that was soon replaced by a frown.
"You wait here, I'll bring something for you to eat" Malfoy said as he got out of the shower and dried his hair with a white towel. He was wearing black pants, a white button up shirt, and a green tie. He put his robes on and Harry just nodded. As soon as Malfoy went down, Harry tried to open the drawer. It had been on his mind all night, and he knew he wouldn't get many opportunities like this one. It was very difficult to reach, however, and when he eventually did, he remembered that it was locked. Only then did he notice that he didn't have his wand with him. Malfoy must have kept it when he grabbed it along with his robes. Harry climbed down the nightstand and sat back on the bed.
He didn't realize he had fallen asleep on the Slytherin's shoulder until Malfoy woke him up the next morning groggily mumbling "cozying up to me, huh Potter?"
Harry figured Malfoy wanted to hear him say it out loud. He felt embarrassed. He definitely did not want to elaborate on that "no, not like Ron" he said as he looked down at his shoes as if they were the most fascinating things.
It had been three days since Harry finally saw Malfoy again. After their kissing incident, Snape had visited their quarters and granted Harry his approval to go back to his dorms.
"I'm sorry" Nott said quietly and stared at the floor for a moment before he raised his head up to look at the blonde, still unable to say anything else "I thought…I thought I would try" he said then smiled sheepishly and rubbed the back of his head "you're not going to curse me, are you?" he chuckled.
“I don’t want to talk about it” Harry muttered through pursed lips “besides, we have bigger problems to deal with”
"I bet it is, so what happened when you got to their common room?" Harry inquired as he adjusted himself on the edge of his bed. It was early morning, and Harry had made as much noise as he could to wake Ron up.
"missed me, Potter?" Malfoy smirked and without waiting for Harry's answer continued "I had classes and some homework…I also hung around with some of my friends" he paused "I have been stuck here with you for too long…I deserve a little break" he said jokingly.
Harry had no doubt he was going back to school. Even if his job as an auror were ready for him, he wouldn't feel right leaving school without finishing what was necessary. He wondered if the school would be the same or if it'd be ruins, like the last time he saw it. He wondered whether his friends would return as well. How would he feel when he's there without Hermione, Ron, or Neville? Maybe they'd choose to go back as well.
Malfoy must have realized what was going on because, finally, he moved Nott away from him with a gentle push and stared at him.
Malfoy huffed "I finished packing, I'll be back later" he told Harry in passing as he left the room, leaving Harry no time to comment or object.
"Harry" the old wizard whispered gently "Professor Snape won't be giving you any detention. However he does have a few words to say" and as soon as he finished his sentence, Snape came in from the next room – a tiny room filled with shelves and potions.
Harry blushed painfully and shook his head, hoping Malfoy would just drop the subject, but he wasn't letting it go.
He felt somebody nudge him, and he looked over to see Ron staring at him with a questioning gaze on his face. Harry just smiled and nodded, and looked over at the board.
"Not really" Harry hadn't thought about it "I have none of my stuff" He hadn't considered any of this at all. Malfoy sighed and went over to his dresser again. He pulled something Harry couldn't quite see, whispered some spell, before turning and handing Harry what seemed to be a shrunken green pajama.
"I'm not saying not to trust Malfoy…" Hermione said "but just be careful" without waiting for Harry's reply, she went on "I think you should go back before he finds out…take this with you" she handed him a small box.
He used a spell to levitate himself and, upon reaching the door, unlocked and opened it with alohomora. It was much simpler to navigate with the help of magic. He tried to go unnoticed by the students walking in the corridors by levitating close to the ceiling. Once he got near the Great Hall though, he noticed both his friends sitting on a bench near the entrance.
He had replayed last night's scene a million times in his head. What did Malfoy mean that the rest would come when he returned to his normal size? Harry gasped at the memory. There was clearly something the blonde was doing to him. He tossed and turned before deciding to get up. Surprisingly, it was easy to get off of the bed now. He looked down at himself and went to the bathroom. He levitated himself to the sink, and as he looked in the mirror, he noticed that he was now about the size of a small child. He grinned to his own reflection before heading back and sitting on the couch. He was thinking of what he could do now when an owl pecked at the window to his right.
They ate in silence for some time before Narcissa cleared her throat “how are you finding the Manor Harry?” she asked and Lucius looked up from his plate suddenly “Harry?” he asked as he eyed his wife suspiciously.
Malfoy kissed his jaw down to his neck and Harry gasped which spurred Malfoy on even more. He bit on Harry’s shoulder through the fabric of his shirt and let his hands fall to his waist.
Draco had a king-sized bed in the middle of the room with a green and silver canopy draping over it. A nightstand was placed at both sides and at the end of the bed, there was a wooden box with a golden lock and a green cushion on top of it.
"I slept early" he answered, but didn't sit. He wanted to go out and take a walk before they had to head to breakfast. He tried to excuse himself more than once, but Padma kept gossiping. He had no idea how she could talk so much this early in the morning, and he wasn't really paying attention to anything she was saying until "…Malfoy looks?" she sounded as if she was asking him something. And that got his attention. He looked at her, and shook his head.
"Slytherins don't play fair, Potter, I thought you knew that by now" said Malfoy with a twisted smile.
"You could shower with a spell" Malfoy offered, but Harry wasn't a fan of that. So, instead, Malfoy suggested Harry shower in the sink, to which he agreed.
Harry waited for him to get off, but Malfoy didn't move. Instead, he watched Harry for a moment before he crushed their lips together.
"Potter" Malfoy started as he raised his head and rested it on top of both hands "I had a chat with Snape today" he continued. His voice sounded cautious, and a little pitiful, as if Harry was about to receive some bad news.
"How am I supposed to help you? I'm the size of your thumb!" Harry stood, hands on both sides of his waist.
He'd laid on his bed, grinning like an idiot, but couldn't stop himself. He could only hope Ron and Hermione wanted to go back, because it wouldn't be the same without them.
"you know Potter? I never thought I'd say this, but…" Malfoy started, a smirk plastered on his face "you're rather cute."
"n-no…everyone" Harry muttered passing Malfoy and heading for the couch again "so…what else should we know?" he asked as he rubbed the back of his head.
Malfoy chuckled as he made his way to the couch, where he sat squaring his ankle over one knee, still in his towel. Harry squirmed in his spot. It was quite difficult to avert his eyes from the blonde, who was clearly enjoying Harry's uneasiness.
"yeah, Nott sat next to me and when Blaise came in, he glared as he walked past the both of us" he explained "and as if that wasn't enough, he kept looking back from his desk and when Nott decided to move his chair closer, Blaise walked up to him and almost hit him…so I just left" Malfoy finished, and without realizing, Harry just blurted out "I don't know why you're fighting over him, he's not even that good looking" Harry pursed his lips as Malfoy eyed him for a moment before his usual smirk appeared "How about me, Potter? Am I good looking?"
"Well, then I'm not going to answer" Harry bellowed as he got off the couch and stomped to the bed, his hands clenched into tight fists at his sides.
"Thanks" mumbled Harry "what should I do now? Just stay here alone?" He knew he sounded a bit sulky.
"You really do look funny, you know that?" Malfoy laughed "here, fold these" he said, throwing what seemed to be a mountain of shirts on the bed next to Harry, but, in reality, were only two.
As they finished, Lucius excused himself and went to his study while Harry and Malfoy made their way up the stairs.
I read about the potion and I think you'll be normal again within a week! You must be the size of a child by now if I'm right in my calculations.
"Yeah, I'm in here" Harry said as he slid the shower door a little and poked his head out. Malfoy looked at him for a bit "so you don't have to sit in the sink huh?" and gave Harry a faint smile.
As Harry opened his eyes properly, he saw that he was currently lying on Malfoy's arm as the blonde towered over him.
Harry hid his face with his hand. Snape must have called Malfoy because while he sulked, a hand grabbed his middle section and raised him. His immediate reaction was to try to get out of it, of course. But he couldn't even move the thumb. So he bit it. He didn't intend to, but he did.
Ron said something about how Malfoy surely didn't want to get into a fight he couldn't win, but Harry knew that wasn't it. Malfoy maybe couldn't win a fistfight or a magic duel but he was good with words and he could do some damage. No. He had not done that out of self preservation, he had actually... stopped so no one would hear Harry's secrets?
"We have to live, not only survive. Sometimes I think Father would have preferred to... Die. Other times I am sure he is happy, but it's hard to know with him"
"Yeah"  Elliot looked at the rock bench where Bea had been sitting and decided to leave a small mark there. It would be erased by the wind  or some other student but it comforted him.
"The cuts in his arm weren't made with magic... It was personal. Someone did it with a knife or some other object"
"Malfoy" Harry wanted to pull away but instead he buried his face against the blonds' chest, closing his eyes and feeling something squeezing at his insides. He had stopped crying only moments ago, and really, he didn't remember the last time he cried so hard. Was it after the war? Thinking about Lupin and his son? Or was it back when Sirius...?
"Of course it matters! I... I..." Draco bit down on his lip,  and Harry wondered if he was trying not to say something bad. "They should've done something"
Harry was taken aback as the blonde sauntered towards him with a smirk plastered across his face. Harry kept opening and closing his mouth unable to say anything.
There was one small window with faded silver curtains to the left of the room and a huge painting to the right, a writing desk underneath it. Noticing it, Potter asked "who's that in the painting?"
Harry was finding it almost impossible to look away from Malfoy. His eyes traveled from the blonde's exposed chest to his long neck, finally locking on Malfoy's heated gaze.
Saying this while looking at Malfoy's face made Harry feel nervous, so he averted his eyes and blurted out "I like you Malfoy."
"ah yes, Mr. Potter" he examined his son with a swift look "I will not pretend that I approve. But –" he raised one finger "if that's what you want, then I will not stop you" he said curtly.
It was six in the morning, and Harry was much too awake to sleep again. He headed to the bathroom, took a quick shower, brushed his teeth, and went down to the common room. It was empty, and Harry was about to walk out when a girlish voice stopped him.
A knock on their door made Harry jump in surprise. Harry heard Malfoy struggling out of bed and making his way to the door.
Harry had felt like he was being choked by the sheets but endured it nonetheless, till they finally went down to the common room, or so he guessed. He remained in position, just in case.
Harry looked to his left and saw Malfoy still asleep. He cast a Tempus charm and noticed that it was almost seven in the morning. If Malfoy wanted to make it to breakfast, he should wake up right about now. Harry nudged the Slytherin, but being this small wasn't very efficient. He nudged Malfoy again and again "Malfoy, wake up!" and finally Malfoy moved a bit and opened his eyes. "Potter, you are so annoying," he muttered, but got out of bed nonetheless. Harry sat on the bed and tried to think of a way he can have breakfast but still pass unseen by everyone else.
“you’ll keep an eye out, and, when necessary, entertain my parents” Malfoy chuckled at the expression Harry made.
When Malfoy joined him in bed, Harry took a deep breath "Malfoy" he poked the blonde who had laid there with his back to Harry. Malfoy turned his head towards him, and unable to see him clearly, turned the rest of his body.
"Potter..." Snape said with a compassionate tone Harry had never heard from him before "you will not have to suffer for long, I think this will be over in two weeks" he added with a little smile before he raised his eyes to Malfoy, who had been standing behind the desk on which Harry was placed. Malfoy seemed to understand something unspoken between them since he grabbed Harry gently, leaving the office and heading back to their room.
Harry tried to open it soundlessly, and found, to his luck, that it was already opened. He slid his hand inside the envelope and grabbed the letter. It was almost impossible to see what was written in the darkness of the drawer. He moved closer to the opening and tried to read again. He could see the handwriting only vaguely. It was very neat, and Harry could only presume it to be a female.
"Look, I know it's early, I just couldn't sleep last night" Nott started "I lied about Blaise alright? Pansy told me you weren't into me and I wanted to find out for myself. I…" he stuttered "Draco…" he said in a barely audible voice and Harry had to strain to hear what he was saying "it's you…always been you…I…" and before he finished saying anything, Harry just heard silence.
Harry stood gaping for almost a minute before he willed himself to close his mouth. He stared at his Professor, trying to decipher the intentions that may be hidden behind such an outrageous behavior.
Malfoy rested his elbows on his knees and rubbed his temples. Harry, without even noticing, moved his hand and lightly touched Malfoy's forearm. When Malfoy looked up at him, Harry squeezed a little tighter.
He crossed the room, took the box of chocolate and the note, opened his first drawer, and put them in.
"I…erm…don't you have class?" The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them. Malfoy smirked "is that the problem Potter? Worried I'd miss class?" and Harry just lay there looking puzzled and unsure of what to say or do as he watched Malfoy.
"what am I supposed to do there, with Potter of all people? Why would I be going home now? This is all very suspicious" Malfoy frowned
Harry looked at him, and tried to push back the thoughts that were making their way to his mouth. He wanted to ask Malfoy why he was ignoring him, but he knew it didn't sound appropriate.
Harry went under the blankets and closed his eyes. He lay there for what felt like an hour before he heard Malfoy move from the couch to the bathroom.
Harry took off his clothes and grabbed the edge of the sink then went down slowly. It felt refreshing to sit and bathe in the soapy water. He washed and was trying to get out, but he kept sliding back down. He tried again and again but he felt slippery and kept falling back into the now slightly cold water. He called out for Malfoy and he could hear the blonde rushing over.
"I'm going to ask you for advice" Malfoy said, and as Harry was about to speak, Malfoy raised his finger and shushed him "and don't get cocky…I just thought you might have something better to offer than my friends. Their advice has been useless lately, to be honest" Harry nodded and kept quiet.
"Why would you put your wand in my drawer, Goyle?" Malfoy finally said, after a long pause in which Harry thought Malfoy was going to hex him.
They got on the train a minute before it left the station. Ginny was hovering next to them asking Harry all sorts of questions that he didn't want to answer, but he did so nonetheless. Ron found Hermione in a compartment and gestured for both of them to come along. Ginny, however, told them that her friends were waiting for her, and left.
"Potter I'm not that sensitive, I was just teasing before" Malfoy said, and his lips curled in a small smile.
He removed the blanket and laid it back on the bed. He walked slowly and sneaked out of the room unnoticed. As soon as he was outside, he looked around him and seeing an empty corridor, muttered the spell Hermione gave him. Within seconds, he saw himself in the familiar common room.
Malfoy glanced at Harry before he walked to the door and opened it "Granger" he saluted as Hermione came inside their room. Behind her, Ron and Zabini entered, to both Harry and Malfoy's surprise.
"This is the only way" Dumbledore interrupted "The Death Eaters have gotten smarter and more cautious. They leave no trace. If we are to stop them, it can only be through Lucius. He is the loose thread" Harry sighed, looking down in resignation. It seemed to him that there will always be something that only he can take care of and only he can do.
“Nothing much, Potter, I’ll go shower and go to bed, I suggest you do the same” muttered Malfoy nonchalantly.
"Tomorrow at breakfast, Dumbledore will tell the students that the school needs to be evacuated, and he will contact their parents. We'll have a week in the manor to figure this out and try and find something for Dumbledore. We need to come back by next Sunday" Malfoy sighed when he saw Harry's glum expression "this isn't easy for me either, Potter" Harry slumped further on the couch "not only do I have to take you of all people to my house, to my room, I have to introduce you as my boyfriend. My parents would prefer a girl you know…they want little Malfoys running around the manor" Malfoy smirked "and they'd surely prefer most guys over you" he added.
Harry heard the bathroom door open and his eyes darted upwards. He paused when he saw Malfoy coming out of the shower, then shifted again before he looked back at the naked figure in front of him. Malfoy had wrapped the lower part of his body in a towel and was still dripping wet.
"Nice sound, Potter" Malfoy smiled in an irritatingly smug way as he always does, and walked slowly down to the dungeons. On their way, Harry and Malfoy did not utter a single word. Malfoy seemed to be preoccupied with some other matter. And Harry…well Harry was thinking about what Malfoy was thinking. As soon as they reached the dungeons, Harry became aware of his present situation. Malfoy hid Harry in his pocket – which was too tight – and sauntered in as if he were taking a leisurely stroll. Having Harry choking in his pocket did not stop Malfoy from making occasional stops as he trekked to his bedroom, nor did it prevent him from having unhurried and relaxed conversations with Parkinson and Greengrass (or at least whom Harry thought it was based on his hearing of their voices).
They began working together, assigning each task to either one of them, and Harry noticed how smoothly he had been working – he was very proud of himself.
"Er…what?" Potter looked so confused that his mother was probably wondering why on earth Draco would go out with him.
"Are you alright?" the Slytherin sounded worried, but as he noticed his own voice betraying him, his face turned passive again.
Harry's brows furrowed as he eyed the letter. He was glad he could get some information in his current state, since Malfoy didn't seem to care about telling Harry anything. He sighed exasperatedly and continued reading:
"Malfoy" Ron said, uncomfortable. Hermione was awfully quiet, a book under her arm. They both had reasons to hate him, if Harry had any he didn't remember them.
" Draco said, feeling something take over, his heart pounding but not drowning out his thoughts. Adrenaline pumping through his whole body "So you want to talk about our blood and family... Let's" He ignored the way his father was about to speak, probably to stop him. Oh, it was too late "Let's talk about it, mother. How about Andromeda, the sister you don't see anymore because she married the wrong man? True, you kept in touch for longer than anyone would believe, but not long enough. Her child is dead and you still won't-...!" He breathed in, finding all the things he had inside and hadn't known how to say. All the questions, the doubts, the anger "And let's talk, mother, about my cousin. Your niece, murdered by your other sister. The crazy one? Oh, but her blood was pure, of course" He got up, unable to just sit there. He was tired of pretending that everything was alright "Or maybe we should talk about Regulus Black? I know what he truly did, I
"Did you not get any? Offers, I mean" Draco smiled a sad smile and he felt bad for him. "You will, once all of this blows over. I'm sure there are a lot of... pure bloods who still think highly of your family"
Harry sighed, feeling that dark shadow that would never quite go away tug at his core "You murdered someone"
Draco moved a hand to the back of his head, touching his hair. It was such a tender caress Harry almost closed his eyes. Instead, he moved forward, looking down at Draco's lips without realizing the other boy was doing the same. Harry closed his eyes knowing it was now or never, and kissed him, feeling the same soft lips he had met only once before but haunted his dreams ever since.
Harry scoffed, he had gotten a lot of offers from different people but he had no clue what he was going to do with his life. A year ago he thought he was going to die, and suddenly everyone expected him to know what to do for the rest of his... life. The papers kept coming up with stories: auror! quidditch player! philanthropist!.
Draco pulled at his shirt, clearly stressed that they were still in the hallway and could be found. And he was right. Harry nodded to let him know he had realized this.
Sometimes. But he also knew his mind wasn't in the right place when he felt that. There had to be a way to get out of it, there... had to be.
Harry searched around the room, finding the blonde head almost immediately at the back. He was quiet and Harry could see he was trying to hide all of his feelings and reactions. Everything was calculated here.
Her eyes widened for a moment and then she shrugged, looking away "This school needs some better management, if students are getting hurt so often"
He heard a small 'hm' and her mother moved, accommodating herself right next to him, their shoulders bumping very slightly. They stayed in silence for a while, enjoying each other's company. Or perhaps they didn't know what else to say. Perhaps there was nothing else to say. Draco felt exhausted, and this was only the beginning.
Draco had been taught from childhood what his future would look like, so much so he grew up with the idea that the future was set in stone. He was to marry a pure blood woman, have an heir or two, take care of the family fortune. He was to become a small copy of his father -but to never overshadow him, of course. And all through his life he had tried to live up to this idea of himself, failing terribly in the process. He was too emotional, too impulsive, not smart enough, not strong enough. He was always lacking.
His chest was full of scars, and that was no news to Draco. Some were thin and others were not, but they were all awful. Despite that, he had never cared much about those, he had deserved them at the time. He remembered that night, the feeling of the cold water on his back, mixing with the warmth of his blood. He was going to die, alone, inside a bathroom.
Before Ron could chime in to defend his girlfriend, the last two of the unlikely group appeared. They were carrying no books, but they had dark bags under their eyes. Exam season was approaching and it clearly exhausted everyone.
"Well, the more we are... the better. And I am sure he still has connections to... the pure blood families?"
"I-... Kept thinking you would get us out of it" Harry couldn't see it, but he was sure Draco was blushing. "It was foolish"
Draco chuckled and he felt much more relaxed. Thinking that the Room didn't want to murder them also made things easier.
Those days had been filled with uncertainty and dread. His mind went from "what if's" to regret, day and night. And then the trials had happened, and Harry Potter had testified for him and his mother. They only stared at each other during the trial, Draco didn't know what to say.
She smiled, but looked tired. Harry could see bags under her eyes. If it weren't for that, Harry would have thought nothing was amiss.
And then Harry could not believe what was happening. Draco was pressed against him, his hands on his neck and they were kissing. And it was nothing like the kisses he had given Cho or Ginny. This was entirely different. Draco's lips were thin and incredibly soft, sweet tasting. Being this close and personal allowed him to feel his roughness, and all the little differences between a boy and a girl. And oh, yeah, Harry was doomed.
at his age. "Do you, Harry Potter, agree to live in with the prisoner under the supervision of the ministry?"
“I know you do” Harry closed the distance between them, holding his hand and wanting so desperately to kiss him “And I wasn't trying to be difficult before”
As long as he could remember the law of the world was that Potter hated him and he hated Potter. Now it turned out that wasn't true. Draco had figured out a long time ago he didn't
His skin was the fairest he had ever seen, sometimes it felt as if just pressing on it too hard would make it red. And Harry wanted to see that. He kissed on a patch of skin, hearing Draco's breathing stop for a brief moment, his fingers digging on the back of his neck. He was doing something right, so he kept going. He used his tongue and then his teeth, pulling at his skin... Draco moaned and it completely ruined his train of thought, if he had one. It was the most arousing thing he had heard in his life, and
"Yeah, I am exhausted" Ron faked a yawn and Harry smiled, looking over at Draco. The Slytherin had clearly seen what was going on between the trio. He was so perceptive it was slightly scary.
They were about to go into the Great Hall, when a blond head made him stop. Draco was, apparently, going to the same place. It was a happy coincidence -or, well, breakfast time-. Harry tried not to smile too much, but Ron was already groaning and pushing Hermione towards the Hall.
Before Harry could react, something pressed on the back of his neck: a wand. He swallowed, trying to cling onto hope as much as he could. Draco was glaring at whoever stood behind him, but Harry couldn't turn around, so he couldn't see.
That was strange. Draco crossed his arms, it's not that he wanted to be difficult, but it was hard to be open to that sort of conversation.
"Like how you start shivering with the lightest winter's breeze?" He smiled, holding him close to his side.
Draco's voice was calm, and barely audible. Harry wished for them to be alone so he could ask if anything was wrong.
"Thank you" He responded, touching one of Harry's hands and keeping them together over his shoulder for a brief moment.
"Uhm, yes... Curious creature. Will have to ask Hagrid about it... he's a nice fellow, surely he will have an idea"
He had planned on asking her about Malfoy and the unspoken-rules of being a pureblood wizard or something, Herm probably read all about it at some point. Now? No way. If he started asking questions about Malfoy of all people his friends would think he had gone mad. And yeah, maybe he had, but he was damn free to go mad now. He was free to do whatever, right?
"Let's go, Potter" Malfoy started opening the door, his back to all of them and clearly ready to leave. Was he going to go seat alone? Or would he want to go back with him and his friends?
Harry chuckled and shook his head, looking back at the other boy. He had been obsessed enough with him to know how he looked almost from memory. He still wondered where and how he got that shade of white-ish blonde.
"Sure you aren't" Ron smirked but kissed Hermione's cheek, probably to just focus on something else. Or because he was in love. Would Harry ever do these things with Draco? Something hurt inside his chest and for a moment, he resented his friends. He resented how they could hold hands and kiss and smile all lovingly while he... couldn't.
"She's not bad... She has helped me and... Yeah" Draco sighed, looking around the bathroom and wishing not to be there anymore "Sorry, can I leave?"
Harry gave him a look, but slowly let go of his arms, starting to find balance while his feet moved frantically.
Hermione seemed puzzled for a moment and then she relaxed, looking around at the students that were chatting and laughing and running around.
But being around Draco wasn't painful, or hard. It was complicated, but it was also easy, somehow. And he could drift off and think about his future. It made the numbness go away for a while.
Draco didn't know if Elliot had realized that already, but if he had he said nothing. Beatrice, on the other hand, had no idea what  was going on, which made Draco feel slightly guilty of putting someone innocent in danger.
Bell turned away from them, opening a small bag and placing its contents over a simple wooden table. Harry didn't need to be a genius to know those were probably torture tools. It was strange, seeing something like that from a wizard, they usually stuck to the Cruciatus curse.
Harry nodded, his eyes roaming the room, body tense. He wished he could take all of his nervousness away. To carry it all on his own back. Their hands separated when Harry walked away towards a table filled with drinks, Draco had noticed how some of the guests had been throwing glances at them. It was something to be expected, people knew about their relationship but they hadn't seen them together. He just hoped no one would say anything. Words can hurt way too much, and they've hurt too much already.
"I know we agreed but... do we have to?" Harry seemed like a child, wide eyed and scared. Truth be told, he felt the same way. This was the first time they were going to an event that could potentially be damaging. Not only to their public images but to them.
"I think we should go to the Infirmary and read about my attack. I mean I'm sure they wrote down how I was and... maybe there is a clue in there"
he helped me. If he hadn't, if he had been just a little bit more selfish... he would still be alive. He's dead
He had grown more than used to it. His whole childhood and adolescence had been marked by death and chaos, what was one more thing?
Draco felt their eyes on him and wished to disappear. "I-it's not out of interest. I'm not dating Potter just for his money, that's... Horrible"
"He is handsome" Draco shrugged, but starting to feel uncomfortable from all the eyes on him "And I would
"Mother says it's not. I don't think she is being honest" He spoke in a way that showed how much he loved his mother and even if he didn't believe her he wasn't going to get mad at her. "I will be in house arrest once we leave, might as well get used to it"
"Thank me?" he was honestly surprised, Harry wondered if he had failed at concealing that emotion from him or if Malfoy wasn't actively controlling his every move around him. "Why?"
"Oh, Professor Babbling, can I have a moment with one of your students?" Auror Bell asked, he had apparently entered the room while the students tried to leave. Draco hadn't seen him arrive at all.
He left the living room, knowing they would be sitting down for diner in a little while and decided to search the house for Draco.
Going to Myrtle's bathroom had been pointless. They had tested the blood on the floor but hadn't found a magical signature, except for Beatrice's. And Myrtle had been in a foul mood, she had screeched and yelled telling them to leave.
"You should stay out of my way" Draco kept his tone calm, almost boring, but he knew who he was imitating. He felt sick.
Ginny smiled "Hmm, I don't really know you so... What are you going to do once you get out of here?"
decide what's best for me"  He whispered as well, touching his left wrist and barely looking at it. "Alright? If you want it covered for your sake, that's fine. But don't cover it for me. I know who you are" And he grabbed his face, strongly, almost forcing eye contact "I
"Thank you" Ron placed his hands around his cup of tea, giving him a worried look. Harry had no idea how he looked, but he reckoned he was exactly the same? True, he wasn't sleeping or eating much but his mental state was as good as he could remember. "The house looks..."
"Not... Not only in bed" Harry kept himself closer to the boy, feeling their bodies touching in every single place.
They kissed again, Harry pushing him down on the bed and placing himself on top of him. The pressure over his body felt good, fitting.
"Hey, I don't think I can keep going" There was a softness in his tone that made something move inside of him. Draco caressed his cheek and his face turned towards the palm of his hand, following his touch.
There was a brief pause, their fingers still intertwined "Father will be angry, furious even. He will try not to scream but fail. He will let me know I am a disgrace, that no one in the family has ever been...
They weren't the type of family to apologize, at least not like normal people did. Perhaps that needed to change.
He fixed his glasses on his face after cleaning them up with one of the sheets and reached out to touch Draco's shoulder. The blonde boy opened his eyes immediately. A light sleeper? That was also unexpected.
Neville seemed pleased with his answers so he went back to his work. They stayed there for a couple of hours, until both of them were exhausted and Draco's arm ached from copying down the notes. They shared a small "thanks" and got up from the table. Draco was probably going to keep reading once he got to his bed -sleeping wasn't easy anyways.
How was he going to keep Harry interested for a whole year without seeing each other? Draco had thought about it extensively, he would write and Harry would respond until he wouldn't anymore. And then Draco would know, he would know Harry was interested in someone else. Hell, maybe he would go back to the Weasley girl. And Draco couldn't even blame him. Harry deserved better, someone who could give him... More. Just
Lucius stopped immediately as if he hadn't even considered that as one of his son's motives. Realization seemed to hit him, so she took his hand and waited for a couple more moments. It was hard for Lucius to accept this. Many things were difficult for him.
Harry wasn't completely daft, he knew the amount of strength Draco had to have to be in there again after what had happened.
Harry moved, grabbing Draco's face with his hands, to kiss him deeply. It was easy to get lost in a kiss, and forget about his inexperience.
After the winter holidays he was going to be alone. Pansy was leaving and Blaise hadn't returned. Hell, he didn't even write him a letter. His mother was surely making his life miserable and associating with a Malfoy wasn't a good idea at the time. Draco understood that, and knew that he would have done the same thing in his shoes.
"I know, Ron" Harry mumbled and opened his eyes "Can we... You don't have to be friends with him, alright? Just... can we be civil?"
Harry tried to process the information, but it was a lot so he simply nodded and listened carefully.
Shit. Where did he have his wand? He looked around, worried that if he took too long the creature would hurt Draco. Luckily the wand was right there, just in arms reach. Without thinking about his side and not wanting to look if he was truly hurt, he threw his wand to the other boy.
"Oh... oh no, if I'm cold, Malfoy..." Harry said, pulling him by his arm and making him fall. What happened next was something Harry should have seen coming: since Draco's body was falling due to gravity but Draco didn't want to fall face first against the ice, his hands reached out to Harry and Harry of course grabbed him -because he wasn't going to get Draco hurt- which meant one of Draco's knees hit the ice quite loudly, while the other one ended up between Harry's legs.
They both watched him go down the corridor. Draco knew he was going to speak to McGonagall, they had discussed it moments before leaving the bedroom. He would've liked for Harry to go with someone else, Granger or Weasley or even Neville but Harry insisted it was better this way. Draco trusted him.
Hermione rolled her eyes in a way that said 'boys' and Harry felt his heart expand inside his chest. He loved his friends so much. They were the only family he would ever know.
If someone had taken Draco outside of Hogwarts he had no idea where to go next. But whoever was doing this
He closed his eyes when the final layers were about to be removed, before being able to see any of the ink. The Mark had faded slightly after Voldemort had died but it was still there, extremely noticeable on his fair skin.
Harry bit his lip and covered himself with the cloak, he was going to stay until they were done and then he was going to talk to Malfoy again. If things were like he thought they were, Draco could be in trouble. Not for harming someone, but because someone might be wanting to frame him or harm him.
"Potter, I'm truly sorry" McGonagall spoke, and he blinked twice not understanding what was going on. Was everyone being vague and weird to confuse him? "This sort of... Occurrences shouldn't keep happening to you inside the school"
Harry found himself hugging Draco as tightly as he could, digging his fingers into the fabric of his vest, his eyes closed as if to not let a single tear drop. The Slytherin didn't waver, he held him tightly with his arms behind his neck, one hand on his head. Harry realized how much he liked Draco being taller than him, but he didn't say it.
"It's three minutes" Harry smiled at him while the microwave made popping sounds. Those machines were incredible and Draco almost wanted to know
"Just for a moment, alright? Or are you sitting with anyone else?" There was a small pause, tense. Harry felt like he had said something he shouldn't have. Was Draco truly sitting alone? Did he not have
There was only one door opened in the hallway, so he walked towards it in hopes of finding his boyfriend. The party downstairs hadn't died down, he wasn't sure how they were going to survive any longer. At moments, everything felt likely too much, too soon, but he put in a brave face for Draco and simply stood there with a drink in his hand and a supportive expression. Draco had shown nothing on his face other than how accustomed he was to all of this, how part of this world he was. Not everything was as it seemed, though, after their brief -and pleasant- encounter with Pansy, he had disappeared leaving Harry all alone with those people that wanted a piece of him or their relationship. There were some reporters amongst the guests, but Harry was sure there were more than a few pretending to be normal people, waiting for the moment to capture a perfect candid of them both. Or perhaps he was just being paranoid.
It was difficult not feeling stupid dancing slowly -and clumsily- with no music on, but Draco's shoulders were so relaxed he felt at ease.
It was humiliating, of course, and Draco wondered if Harry remembered how he had looked in there. Harry hadn't said a word about it. Maybe it was better this way.
Oh, Merlin. Harry was sure Draco already knew about this -he had his sources of information-, but perhaps that's why he was so jumpy lately?
"I'm sorry" A long pause, neither of them moved "I know what... that feels like. Not exactly, I... Father, he's..."
. It was frightening, feeling like someone would be there for him always. He had always pictured himself living alone, not knowing what love was or what family felt like. Not knowing what it was to have someone to hold him accountable for his actions.
"Look, Draco, he's dead. If he was your big realization that Voldemort's side was evil then congratulations but it's still not worth him dying"
While Harry told him what was what, he couldn't help but feel they were both discovering the world for the first time. After spending so much time with him, he had understood the extent of his abuse, and even though he didn't like talking about it, Draco kept it in the back of his mind.
Elliot was waiting impatiently outside Gryffindor tower, looking as if he hadn't slept at all during the night. It was odd, feeling much older than him. They only had, what? Two years of age difference and yet, Draco felt older. Much, much older.
"I'm here" Draco said, kissing the top of his head. His shirt was wet with his tears and Harry was sure he was annoyed at him. Anyone would be, right?
"We don't trust them" Draco interjected and that made Elliot look a bit more interested in what they were saying. "I don't. They want to find clues to put me in Azkaban, they don't want to find whoever did this to you"
Draco laughed, turning around completely this time to be face to face with him. "Yes, it's new to me too. So... Sex makes you say even more stupid shit, huh?"
" Harry tried not to chuckle, it was always adorable when the Weasleys got in a fight because most of the times it was obvious they loved each other. As far as Harry knew, the fights had only turned sour after the war.
And yes, bad days had come, and he had isolated himself inside their bed. Harry had been a great sport though, kissing his head and letting him sleep all morning until he was ready to come down or take a shower. He gave him space, and Draco accepted it gladly. Surprisingly, in the end, he found himself wanting to be near Harry. It was a bad day, but being near him made it not so bad.
Harry wanted to laugh at that. Or cry. What did they think Draco was? A monster? He only nodded, knowing full well he would never 'ask for help'.
Harry had to do a double take, staring at him with a frown on his face. He had expected Draco to eventually put some sort of condition, he had expected for the world to show him that no one would ever truly love him. Not without leaving him.
"I almost feel like I should make a big announcement or something" Ginny mumbled, staring at the door.
"Potter" His voice was a whisper, but it was enough to make the boy turn around. Neither of them smiled, but Draco suspected Harry wanted to.
Harry felt bad. He hadn't really given much thought to Ginny, not because he didn't care about her just because he was busy with something else that felt more important. And, if he was being honest with himself, Fred's death was something he had no idea how to deal with yet. And seeing her was facing that again and.. it was better if they both worked things out on their own.
Hermione looked clearly concerned and intrigued, giving Harry a look before turning to Draco again. "What happened in there?"
"In... In a way. Is Adam the only other boy that... That you knew that is...? I mean, the only boy that you knew was involved with another boy?" Harry felt ashamed at how hard it was for him to ask a simple question, but being honest he felt insecure about all of this. He still didn't know the wizarding world, not completely. What if it was forbidden? No... Surely he would know such a thing, right?
They could clearly hear the argument starting between Hermione and Ron behind them, and even though Harry didn't want to hear, he knew every single word would do incredible damage in the other boy. How he knew that? He wasn't exactly sure. He wasn't exactly sure how he had come to care about him either, but it had happened and now they were friends and things were shit but... but he had to try to make it all good. Didn't he? What was the point of being alive otherwise?
"You can share it, you know? What you have on your mind" Harry didn't answer, looking away but feeling the slytherin's gaze on him.
Harry stared how Slughorn gave Malfoy his wand at the beginning of class and how the blonde walked to his desk quickly, making eye contact with him very briefly. Some people still snickered and whispered every time Malfoy had to go and get his wand from the teachers, and Harry was half sure most of them had no idea of the damage they were doing.
"It's fine... Kiss me" Draco pulled him closer, kissing him fiercely. He moved one of his hands to his own cock, stroking himself as a way to relax. That was smart, Harry made a mental note to remember that for later.
They should be, after what Voldemort had done, they should be but they weren't. Hm. Maybe that would change now.
“We don't have to do it tonight” Elliot said, giving a sideways glace to Noah who nodded in some sort of encouraging maneuver. Harry had no idea what was going on “We could-”
Well, they were going to talk about it at night and they always managed to fix things, didn't they? It was odd feeling good after coming back. It was odd feeling at home in a place that held so many bad memories.
Draco seemed to stop and look at him "Ask me out? We are already dating, Potter, what do you want?" He seemed impatient, and Harry sighed.
Harry looked at him, and realization hit him. When he first met Draco's parents, he had immediately thought of Draco as a small Lucius. But right now? He could see the truth. Draco was more like his mother than his father. He was cunning, ambitious, misguided -but not evil-, and warm. Harry wondered if Draco realized this. If he realized how much he had in common with Narcissa. Had Lucius noticed it as well? Was that why he was so hard on Draco?
"Wait, hold it still" Harry said, reaching out and placing his hand over Draco's. The touch was soft again, and warm and Harry liked it and it made him pull away immediately.
The common room was warm and quite deserted. Hm. Well, it was their second day back from the holidays so surely everyone was catching up and studying or something.
Draco simply shrugged and Harry was grateful he didn't try and start a fight. Without saying anything else, Draco lay down on the bed looking up at the ceiling.
Harry had decided that he was free to do as he pleased, and he was no one to ask him to leave, but he didn't really like having him in a place that meant so much to everyone
he knew nothing about pretty places to live. Every time he was about to choose a color for a wall, or a pattern for some furniture, a strange fear gripped him and he had to stop. This was something he had never done, something he had never been allowed to do.
It would have been much better if it had stayed as a shapeless mass, but it didn't. Slowly but surely it took form of something they both vaguely remembered.
"I understand" It wasn't the first time they told him, and he could see how Draco was almost smirking at him. Did he realize how annoyed he was with all of them?
Harry groaned, trying not to get angry. He felt bad when stuff like that made him angry towards his friends but
"I have been looking all over for you" Harry gave a step forward but stopped himself, clearly aware of what he was doing and where "Are you avoiding me?"
things, Harry wondered what he meant by that: the star crossed romance, the smuggling letters, the war or simply two boys having feelings for each other?
"Hey... that's not so bad" Harry moved a bit closer, kissing his cheek to try and show affection. He wasn't really good at that. But maybe he was enough for Draco.
“We think it's your blood anyways” Harry sighed “And it has to be done during a waxing crescent, whatever that means”
Well, shit. Draco forced a smile, hand moving away from Harry's arm. It wasn't that he felt ashamed of their relationship, but they had both agreed it would be better to avoid being on the tabloids. The last thing they needed was the front cover of the Prophet showing them kissing. That was a private moment between the two, not something to be shown to the rest of the world. At least not like that.
Harry was about to have lunch when he found out, but when he reached the seventh floor, his stomach was turning from nervousness instead of hunger. He didn't know if he would find a corpse when he opened the door, or if he was walking into a  trap. He didn't know, but he had to help him. He had to do
He thought about going back to his bedroom, still trying to understand everything that had happened that day
. Bell left the Room of Requirement hurrying towards the wing where the aurors had been given accommodations. Of course he had hidden things in 'plain sight' and
?” Harry frowned, trying to buy both of them time. Time to figure out how to get out of this situation, time for their friends to find them, for someone to find them. The School had saved them before... And Harry hadn't survived all those years to die at the hands of a fucking second class Death Eater.
"I wanted to come back" He shifted uncomfortably because everything that came to mind was sad or terrible "I love Quidditch and wish I could play this year. I actually think you are a good enough seeker" There was a snort
"Not now, Lucius" Narcissa closed the gap between them, enveloping him in a tight hug. For a split second Draco didn't know what to do. They weren't a family of huggers, hell, they didn't really touch that much at all. Something must have moved in Lucius because he joined the hug, an arm around his wife and another around him. He was being appropriate, of course, but Draco could see the sentiment in his actions.
"That's good" Elliot bit down his lip, hard. He wanted to say so many things to him, but didn't know if he should. Noah had no feelings for him, and that... That was okay as long as they were friends. Risking their friendship was something Elliot wasn't ready to do.
And then he was gone. And Harry felt sad. And confused. And what the hell had just happened between them? They had shared a wonderful morning, almost half a day, and now they were weird again?
Most of that year had been spent, at least for Draco, confined inside the house. The aurors hadn't checked on him as much as they did when he lived with his parents, which was a good thing but it didn't change how much of a prisoner he was. Harry had been instrumental in him not losing his mind, always finding some activity to do, or making sure Draco could learn something new to do without magic that would keep him entertained.
Harry scanned the Slytherin table, and was met with a fierce gaze. Unfortunately, it wasn't from Malfoy. Zabini was staring at him, and Harry met his gaze. Zabini finally smiled at Harry, and looked away.
"I noti…" Malfoy seemed to rethink his choice of words before he continued "oh yeah? What else do you like, Potter?" and not waiting for Harry's answer, moved his hand down and gently slid it under Harry's shirt.
"Good morning" she said, and Harry turned to see who it was. He was met with a very sleepy Padma. She had her hair tied back, and was wearing what looked like a nightgown. Harry smiled and returned her greeting.
Hermione looked at Harry with worried eyes, and he smiled at her. She managed to smile back, but the worry in her face didn't disappear. Immediately after they sat down, Snape came inside, his robe bellowing behind him.
Harry's hand immediately reached out to stop Malfoy's exploration of his skin. The blonde watched him intently, his hand stilling in place.
"Yes, we still have to write the essay for the DADA class, we should go to the library before dinner" Hermione said, and got up from her place, put the book in her bag, and looked ready to leave. Ron stood as well, and both of them looked at Harry, who decided that he should go with them instead of staying here, wallowing in self-pity.
It was with difficulty that Malfoy was able to release Harry from his pocket. His pants being so tight and all. Harry was gently put on Malfoy's bed, and the first thing Harry did was examine the room. It was very…Slytherin, for lack of a better adjective.
"Yes, Professor" Harry's voice was barely heard. He could not think of any reason why he couldn't tell his friends. It was true that Dumbledore had told them, in his speech at the beginning of the year about some Death Eaters that have not yet been caught, but that was no reason to keep him with Malfoy! His father was a Death Eater himself. And Malfoy was going to take care of him. He would have to live with Malfoy in the Slytherin dungeons! And sleep with Malfoy!
"but now" he warned "you must not let anyone other than Mr Malfoy, and the few Professors, know about this, are we clear?"
Harry tried to pretend like he wasn't hurt to hear the scene repeated again and tried to focus on finding out the rest "and what happened next?" he tried to sound as calm as possible.
"alright alright" Potter raised his hands defensively "I didn't think it through, I'm sorry" Draco just grunted lightly before getting up and helping Potter organize his stuff.
Malfoy got up and moved towards the chest at the foot of the bed. He bent down and opened it slowly, reaching down for something Harry couldn’t see.
Harry was not looking forward to his detention with Snape. It was only the beginning of the year, and he already had detention. Harry made his way to the dungeons, and stood for a whole minute before he dared to open the door. But when he came in, he was met with Professor Dumbledore.
Malfoy must have noticed how anxious Harry had become because he inched closer and grabbed Harry in his hand "I won't let anything happen to you" he said with conviction, and perhaps to lighten the mood, added "maybe this time, I'm the chosen one" he snickered.
"I can't make up everything Potter" Malfoy retorted as he watched Harry gradually become more uncomfortable.
Zabini and Hermione were sitting at either side of the couch and Ron seemed to be squashed in the middle. He was eyeing Harry and gave him a faint smile before he turned to Hermione who began explaining "Dumbledore summoned us to his office yesterday…the three of us" she pointed "and Snape was also there…they explained to us that your father had been seen with some of the Death Eaters that escaped and that Snape was keeping tabs on him" Hermione stopped and only continued after Malfoy nodded "Dumbledore needs our help. They can't get to the Death Eaters because they are being very cautious after everything that has happened" Malfoy cut her short "you want me to help by using my father?" he wasn't angry, to Harry's surprise.
An hour or two passed, and Harry hadn't heard from Malfoy since he went out. He knew he shouldn't have annoyed Malfoy. Now he had to sit alone in the room, having nothing to do or anywhere to go. Zabini had come to the room earlier as Harry was about to climb down the bed, and Harry had to hide under the sheets again.
He inched closer to the tray of food and started chewing on the bread and butter Malfoy had brought him. After he finished eating, he had a wild thought of trying to leave the room and go out for some air. He walked up to the head of the bed, the action becoming easier now, and when reaching the stand near it, he climbed up rather easily and opened the first drawer where he remembered Malfoy had put his wand.
"Yes, Blaise" Malfoy said as they went in. "You've said that a million times. It's not my choice, you know. It's something I have to do. Anyway, you can come visit, as will I" Harry heard and felt Zabini sit down on Malfoy's bed.
The death eaters you told us about are on the loose, and Dumbledore warned all the students. They even canceled Hogsmeade next week!
It was almost ten at night, and Harry had to meet Malfoy. He made his way to their previous dorm, shuffling his feet as he did so. He kept imagining himself in the manor with Malfoy strutting around, sending the family servants to do his errands. Malfoy was no longer like that. A voice in his head reassured.
Harry squirmed and scratched the back of his head. He had to meet Ron and Hermione in an hour, and he couldn't sneak out if Malfoy was there.
Malfoy walked calmly towards his mother and gave her a hug. He shifted awkwardly "Mother, you know Potter" he introduced and Narcissa smiled faintly "yes, of course" moving forward and shaking Harry's hand. Harry smiled back at her.
"Yeah, I heard" Harry started "why did you agree to all this?" Harry questioned. Malfoy didn't have to do this. He was leaving all of his friends to live with his rival. Yes, they had started going along after everything that had happened, but they weren't friends, and Malfoy didn't even argue with Dumbledore. Harry knew there was something going on that they weren't telling him, and he'll surely find out soon enough.
Harry, on the other hand, had mixed feelings about this. First off, Malfoy was NOT gay. Last year he had went out with at least two girls, then the war started and that was that. Also, Malfoy had went to the Yule Ball with a girl, and if he were gay, he wouldn't have. But what seemed to bother Harry the most is that Malfoy, if he were to be gay, would NEVER go out with Nott of all people, and they certainly don't look cute together. So, Harry tried to block out what his two friends were saying, and think about anything that isn't Malfoy-related.
The Manor itself was grand and elegant, with gardens surrounding it on all sides. In the middle of the garden, there was a huge fountain that was decorated with golden crests.
Malfoy grabbed Harry and together, they made their way to the couch Malfoy was previously sitting on.
He eyed him suspiciously. He knew Malfoy, talking about his family was crossing an invisible red line.
Malfoy was sitting on the couch with a book in his hand, which he closed noisily and threw to his side before he leaned forward.
Harry hesitated. He didn't want to mess this up, and he knew this was an important part of brewing the potion. But he also didn't want to seem like he didn't know how to do it. He nodded, and she smiled gently at him.
Malfoy relaxed in his seat, facing Harry as he spoke "I left class after half an hour, I couldn't focus anyway" Malfoy sighed as he looked away "I'll start over…have you had sex before?" He asked making Harry's entire body stiffen "I mean I'm sure you have…the Boy-Who-Lived and all" he continued, not noticing Harry's expression. But when the latter didn't answer him, he tilted his head "what?" he asked, and probably seeing Harry's red face, his brows creased "you…you haven't?"
"Who has changed?" Harry asked intrigued "Seamus, Dean, and Neville are all the same, doubt any of the girls did" Ron nodded in agreement.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. For a split second, Harry thought he was about to make fun of him. But Malfoy just smirked "well…I always thought you stared at me far too much" he seemed happy with Harry's confession and Harry wasn't sure that this was a good idea "so you have a crush on me?" Malfoy added amusedly.
Malfoy huffed as he rubbed his temple "no, I'm not going to curse you" and then raising his head added "yet"
Harry headed to their common room with Ginny and Dean, and was reminded of his detention before reaching the Fat Lady portrait. He huffed in annoyance, and headed down to the Dungeons.
"Mr. Potter" Snape drawled "you will come to my office later to brew another one. Meanwhile, let Ms. Davis finish this one without any further complications" he turned his head and walked back to his desk. Harry couldn't meet anyone's eye. He just sat there until class ended, berating himself for messing up again.
"If you react like that when mother asks you, then you don't really have to answer" Malfoy snickered.
Malfoy had left the room soon after to go to class and came back much later carrying Harry's dinner.
Harry could feel the blush creeping to his cheeks. He looked away immediately, "don't be so full of yourself" stammering under his breath, as he sat down on the bed.
"Then how, Potter? Just spill it out! I don't have all day to wait on you" Malfoy sounded irritated.
"I am not sure I am entitled to be the one to tell you" Snape drawled, sitting down on his chair. Harry was utterly bewildered, and apparently, his expression showed that, because Snape looked at him reassuringly and uttered:
Harry did not like this side of Malfoy at all. He made Harry act like a stupid girl with a crush. Harry pouted again and crossed his arms but said no more on the subject.
"maybe he also likes you?" Granger reasoned with him "if you tell him, you'll know. Either he likes you, then you won't be so miserable, or he doesn't, and –"
"you've always been a child Potter" Malfoy chuckled as he looked at Harry, who couldn't help but chuckle as well.
Harry walked the distance between the foot of the bed, where he was situated, and Malfoy's head, and it took him a while.
Harry chatted with his friends before they decided to go to bed. Tomorrow they would have to wake up early, and have their first lesson in Arithmancy, which was difficult enough, so they had to be focused.
Harry woke up with a start. He had dreamt of being stuck in his current size forever and was terrified. He looked to his right where Malfoy slept and noticed that the blonde was still in bed.
"It's almost 10:30" Malfoy said as he closed the book "and I know you just woke up but I need to tell you something" he continued and Harry, hearing the seriousness in his voice, sat up and perked his ears.
This time, Harry gathered all his strength and looked Malfoy in the face then answered "yes, I like you"
It took him a long time to fall asleep and when he woke up, the same feeling was still lingering there, like he couldn't breathe properly, like something was slightly gripping his heart.
"Do you know what this is all about?" Harry asked him when they'd started walking. Malfoy looked down at his stretched hand, before nodding and muttering "yes" without further explanation.
"why? how?" Draco was searching Potter's face for a hidden joke. Potter just shrugged his shoulders and, smiling, continued munching on what's left in his plate.
"Ron! Hermione" he almost shouted as he landed next to them. As soon as Hermione saw him, she shrieked and both her and Ron jumped up from the bench staring at Harry with wide eyes.
"Why won't you tell me who T is?" Harry asked as they sat down, taking advantage of the Slytherin's good mood.
"Alright alright" Malfoy held his hands up with a smile on his face, "good enough…I'll tell you about the chocolate box"
"yeah Malfoy, I know what you'll say" Potter smiled "finally someone with some sense" he imitated Draco's voice very poorly and Draco couldn't help but smile "or something else about how you also don't like me" Potter said, somewhat sulkily.
"Can I have some chocolate? You don't want them anyway" Harry was just trying to keep the conversation going. He was supposed to live with the blonde. Yes, it was only for a few days, but Harry didn't want to pass them in awkward silence.
"I can't believe this!" Hermione said "Dumbledore lied to us! I knew something sounded fishy about the whole thing! You would never have left without talking to us about it first" Harry nodded.
Malfoy suddenly moved away, his smirk still visible "I think I'll do the rest when you return to your normal size" he said as he winked at Harry "good night Potter" he ended their conversation by turning his back to Harry and covering himself with the blanket.
"after my parents died, I lived with my aunt" Potter said, swallowing the last piece of bread "they didn't like me very much" Draco scoffed
If he told Malfoy the truth that he's been staring because he thought the blonde was up to something then Malfoy would definitely not tell him what Nott was thanking him for. He probably had to play on Malfoy's big ego to get a real answer.
Harry's heart leapt like a teenage girl's. He was aware of every detail that shaped Malfoy's face. The slight redness of his lower lip, the little blonde hairs on his cheeks, and the sparkling of his grey eyes. Harry shook his head to get rid of such nonsense and before he could even come up with a witty comeback, Malfoy had put him back on his bed "many people have only dreamt of being in my bed, Potter" he smirked and left the room, leaving an utterly confused Harry behind.
Harry looked up at him, trying to smile as naturally as possible. He knew he looked uncomfortable because Malfoy's brows furrowed as he waited for Harry's reply.
As they approached the front door, Harry was about to knock but Malfoy stopped him. Instead, the blonde moved in front of the door and it swung inward. Harry had never seen anything like this in his life, and he wasn't sure he liked it.
"I'm not really sure...haven't dated anyone before" Malfoy replied and joined Harry on the couch "oh and Dumbledore suggested we sleep here tonight" said Malfoy suddenly.
"Thank you, Potter" Malfoy had said, and walked away with his family. And Harry could only replay that answer over and over again. He had never heard Malfoy thank him before, and the Slytherin had never said his name like that, with a kind of gratitude. It had baffled Harry, and excited him somehow. He had, of course, dismissed all of those feelings.
"Oh, Harry! Don't be silly! Come on, let's go outside for a while before I have to go to class" she said, and got up to leave, Harry, Ron and Ginny following behind.
Malfoy glanced at him "as soon as his highness gets up" he motioned for Harry to get off the bed. Harry scoffed but got up anyway. He walked to the window and stared at the green grounds outside.
"Er…" said Harry. He remembered the password to the room he shared with Malfoy but couldn't remember this one. He stood there for a while, pondering what it might be.
Their next class passed quickly, and Harry tried to pay as much attention as he could. McGonagall was going on and on about something that sounded very important, but even though they didn't share this class with the Slytherins, Harry was still imagining Malfoy.
Draco wanted to go in and stop this nonsense when he heard Potter say "the closer I get to him, the more I realize he's unaware of people's feelings" he sighed quietly.
Ron and Harry looked at each other, and tried to make sense of what just happened. None of them, however, seemed to know what that was about. They shrugged it off, and made their way to their table.
"you need to go home…take Harry with you" both Harry and Malfoy looked at her incredulously "you heard me" she announced "you can say you're friends now…that you wanted to hang out or something…"
If someone had told Harry he’d be having dinner with the Malfoys in the Manor, he’d have laughed in their faces. Yet, here he was, with Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy seated at their table while Malfoy finished getting dressed.
That, however, was more difficult than Harry thought. And his mind kept throwing images of Malfoy and Nott in an empty alcove, Nott pressed to a wall, while Malfoy kissed up and down his neck. Harry felt rage boil inside him. He had no idea why he felt so angry. He definitely wasn't jealous, and he figured it must be his hatred for Malfoy, yes he was content with such an excuse. He refocused on his friends, hoping that they changed the subject.
Harry didn't really know why he wanted to ask about Malfoy. Perhaps because last year was just all over the place. Narcissa had helped him, and he couldn't watch Lucius go to Azkaban, no matter what he had done before. Malfoy had only talked to him once. Harry had found him after the trial, and had given him his wand back.
"right here" Draco pointed at his bed "next to me" Potter was clearly not expecting that as he opened and closed his mouth in embarrassment.
When Apparition was over, Ron joined Harry and Hermione in their common room. And Ginny joined the three of them.
"You're finally awake" Harry heard as he opened his eyes. Malfoy was lounging on a small couch at the side of the room, a book in his hand.
He berated himself as Malfoy's eyes snapped to him, shock written on his face. A moment later, Malfoy's face relaxed and Harry was met with a rare sight – Malfoy grinning.
He heard a rustle of clothing and shoes and looked outside his curtains. Ron was fumbling his way to the bathroom, and Harry couldn't not laugh at him. Ron threw a shoe at him, but missed. He got up, ready to follow his plan, and have a wonderful day.
After what felt like an eternity, Malfoy finally reached his bedroom. Harry only heard the crack of a door, and Malfoy's hushed voice telling Crabbe and Goyle to leave the room – to which they had no opposition.
"I'm going down to the common room for a bit" he had said, looking somewhat accusingly at Harry "don't make any unnecessary noises" he continued with a raised eyebrow.
Finally, Draco decided it's time to go in "Pot…Harry, here you are" he feigned surprise as he walked towards them. Potter sat straight and cleared his throat "yeah, sorry"
Breakfast was over soon. Harry had sat down, had some bread and butter, talked about Quidditch with Ron and Seamus, and headed to class with his friends walking along.
Harry hurried to his room and wrote two letters – one to Ron, the other to Hermione – asking them if they'd be going back to Hogwarts for their eighth year. He'd love to go back! He wanted one more year with his friends, and with his professors – even Snape! It would be like his first year, when he didn't have to worry so much about Voldemort and the Death Eaters. He still couldn't believe he had gotten rid of him. He'd sometimes sleep thinking this was all a dream, and he'd wake up hearing Dumbledore telling him to be ready for the Dark Lord to strike, or listening to Snape pestering him about his lack of concentration in his Occlumency lessons.
"What on earth are you doing?" Malfoy sounded mad. Harry looked up at him innocently "nothing" he muttered. The note was still in his hands since he had no way of hiding it.
"Well, for one thing, I can fit you right in my pocket, which would have made my life a whole lot easier before" he half chuckled, "I think being small looks good on you" he added, turning away as he gave Harry one of his typical smirks.
"well…" Harry was embarrassed and angry at Malfoy. He turned his eyes towards the small window on the other side of the room.
"Why can't we tell the other students? I can stay in my dorm with Ron!" Harry argued a bit childishly. He definitely didn't want to stay with Malfoy, and didn't know why Malfoy didn't argue on his part, it's not like the Slytherin liked him.
They reached Dumbledore's office, and saw the headmaster sitting on his chair as usual with his hands knotted before him.
Harry and Davis had only just begun when she turned to him and asked "can you shake the peeled Shrivelfig, Potter?"
Harry's friends had come over for a couple hours almost every day, their visits were short and even though he knew it was his fault -and all the Ministry's rules- Harry never complained to him. Which was nice. Living with his father, he always heard about all the things he did wrong, how he was failing and being an utter disappointment. He didn't get that with Harry, not one bit. Harry... liked him, and accepted him for who he was. It was overwhelming at times.
"Not a home," Draco stared at the building. It had been a home, a long, long time ago. "let's go. I'm fine"
It was obvious, and neither of them said a word. "So you and her...?" It was a bit hard for him to imagine Malfoy with anyone other than Pansy. Well... maybe not. Maybe imagining Malfoy and Pansy together was as ludicrous as imagining him and Hermione as a couple.
"Merlin, Draco" She sounded a bit annoyed, tightening the grip on his hands "We are friends. I wouldn't be with Felix if you hadn't... Supported me then"
was probably the worst part of her two best friends dating. "And... What happened to that kid left me a bit worried, alright? It's just that"
"I know. It's one of the many things that are wrong" Draco moved his hand but barely touched Harry's "Sorry about... you know, third year? Scaring you with the whole... Dementor thing"
"Yeah, Harry. I do know what that's like" Ron seemed older at times, speaking like that. "Well, why haven't you visited then? He has visiting hours, surely?"
Harry cleared his throat, a hand suddenly resting on Draco's lower back like a burning iron. Hm. Interesting.
"I know" Draco said with a chuckle "I know it's weird but they were shaping me back then. Mother wanted me to be strong, she knew what being a pure blood meant. She still does..."
Harry sighed and looked around, they were surrounded by snow but it wasn't as deep as it was before the holidays. Spring was looming in the distance, any day now the whiteness would disappear and make way to bright green leaves.
“Ah, silly me” Bell smirked and released him, his muscles moving almost all at the same time. He wanted to get up and punch him, but he was the one with the wand and Draco was still tied up.
And people were having fun. Draco could see, from the outside still, people coming and going through the gardens, talking and laughing while holding glasses filled with colorful drinks.
"Do you want to?" He found himself asking, hands on Draco's waistband. He definitely wanted to have him naked again, but he wasn't sure if the blond wanted to have sex or not.
"Yeah, got her wing all... Messed up because of it and... Ah! Hedwig" He jumped, looking at his fingers. She had a temper but she hadn't bit him in a while.
“We thought it would be nice to... just relax?” Noah said while sitting down on the floor and taking disposable cups out of his bag.
"Draco, I'm fine. Draco... Draco, stop!" That got Malfoy to look at him, his hands still grabbing the shirt but without trying to pull it up. "I'm fine... I'm okay"
"Draco" She sounded alarmed, quickly moving to his side. "Draco... Your father... You'd be burnt from your family tree... And..."
"My plan is fine" She said, clearing her throat and making Harry's gaze fall on her again "If it was used, we will have to find... A lot of evidence to help you"
This was how they worked: his father would hurt him and then Narcissa would try to soothe him and mend his wounds. It could be too much. Draco pressed his face to the pillow, closing his eyes and breathing as slow as possible. He wanted to stop hurting all over, to shut down his emotions... He had done it so many times, why was it hard now?
He had gone upstairs in the hopes of finding Draco but also wishing to have a moment away from all that crazyness. It was much easier when it was only the two of them, alone, away from the World.
"You used to be so happy" She whispered, staring at him but Draco could see her mind was miles away. "You would laugh and run around the house... I-... We used to-... " She shook her head, almost as if forcing the memories away.
Draco liked most of his classes -he actually liked school- but sometimes he wondered if he'd have chosen different subjects given the... freedom to do so. Maybe if he had been more passionate about his electives he would have been top of the class. Maybe.
Not everything had been bad those last few months, Harry having a job meant he was smiling more, talking about his colleagues and sharing fun stories. At first he hadn't told them who he was seeing, only that he was in a relationship. As time went on, he told them about the relationship without asking him first. Draco was a bit glad, he wasn't sure he would've been brave enough to say yes, and his workmates were fine with it. Apparently not everyone cared who they were.
He must have said that with a bit too much anger because his friends shared a look before giving him one. "Alright, Harry. But we have to talk soon. All of us. We need to talk about what happened to you in the Room of Requirement"
Noah was frowning at the paper "I drew it when I woke up, it was the only thing I could remember without having a terrible headache"
to be near him and partly because he had seen how sad he was. He knew he wasn't good with words, or comforting people but he had
Even if he had tried to go back to being the Malfoy heir his father wanted so much, during The Trials everyone had been exposed for who they were. And the Malfoys weren't
Were they going to talk at all? Perhaps she truly wanted to train and didn't care that he had been acting
"He does a thing" Noah interjected "He... likes to put a chalk mark on the places he has been. His bag is filled with it. It's a bit annoying"
"I do know" Draco slump back on the couch, trying not to feel defeated. His reputation was... shit, it truly was. And people knowing he was dating the hero? It would do him no good. People were looking for any excuse to hate him even more, and he was going to hand them one on a silver platter. Hells, he had already seen what other boys his age -and younger- thought of the pairing. Not only that, but being at school meant those boys couldn't actually act like people in the real world would. Yes, they could try and hex them or throw slurs at them, but back at Hogwarts there was a Headmistress, and wards, and people actually concerned with the wellbeing of students. The real world? No one was going to be there to take care of them, or to look after their mental stability. The tabloids would run with the craziest stories, they would try to take pictures of them, they would harass Harry and himself and it would make it all the worse.
"How about we try a little serum? Hm?" He chuckled, shaking a small vial filled with a transparent liquid. They both knew what it was, but Harry didn't understand why he needed it. He didn't understand the need for any of it.
He placed his hands on Draco's cheeks, kissing his lips with such force their lips turned slightly white every time they clashed. There was no rush this time, but Harry had never felt in such a
Elliot frowned, counting in a low voice while his fingers moved next to his body “But... wait, whoever is doing this could have done it much sooner. That particular phase lasts around eight days”
Harry nodded, and went back to kissing him. But not on the lips. He started on his neck, feeling him swallow and hold in a breath. There was something beautiful in the way Draco reacted to being touched, something that made him want to devour him. Harry bit softly at the skin under Draco's collarbone, pulling it in between his teeth. He wasn't sure if that would leave a mark, but he didn't care and the way Draco was undoing both of their pants told him he didn't care either.
Harry tried not to think too much about his former potions' teacher, it was a delicate subject and he had not told everything to his friends yet. He had told them to stop speaking ill of him, but nothing else. Hermione had given him a look that said "it's the trauma talking" when he 'defended' Snape's memory. And maybe she was right, but what was and wasn't a product of trauma in his life?
"Uhm, thanks. I prefer women, but, uh-" Noah blinked, not really knowing what to say. Next to him, Elliot seemed deflated at his words. So this had really backfired on him. Harry felt sorry for him, he really did but he also felt a pang of jealousy and he didn't quite know how to deal with that.
His heart fell right to his feet again, and something inside his head tried to tell himself that he was so susceptible because of... Everything that had happened with the war and his nightmares and NOT because he couldn't be with Draco that night.
It was so dark that even though he closed his eyes, it didn't change anything other than making him feel a bit safer.
A soft squeeze on his arm, Draco's hand. He knew it was his as well as he could feel his presence next to his body. The attacker wasn't Draco. It wasn't and now he had proof. They had just been together, he had been
"It's okay, other people don't like it when people cry but I don't mind" She was sweet, and that made it all worse.
Malfoy lazily closed his book and stood up, trying to clean as much grass as possible from his clothes. Harry had to repress a smile because the blonde boy had terribly failed and had some pieces of grass clinging to his robe.
