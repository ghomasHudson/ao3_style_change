They paced, Harry trailing a finger along the desk to ground himself, Kingsley tucking his hands into his sleeves in a meditative pose.

, the school where
, Harry wanted to say, but no, they were already dead. What use would first aid be?
"This isn't King's Cross Station," Harry said thoughtfully.
He breathed shakily and, when the worst of the trembling subsided, nodded at Hermione.
Sirius glanced away, uncomfortable, and removed his hand from James's shoulder so he could cross his arms. "I dunno. I've never heard of anything like that before, but… he's messed up, right? The way he panics at the smallest things. That— that
. He had never been that small, had he?
Just as he would remember trying desperately to heal Sirius back in their dorm, too afraid of getting caught as unregistered animagi, too afraid of being forced to abandon Remus on full moons, to go to Madam Pomfrey. There had been a lot of blood.
Two and a half years for Regulus Black to go from this epitome of a pureblood heir, a perfect Slytherin, a talented Quidditch player, to a young man disillusioned about his entire life and prepared to die in order to change it.
Sirius's bark of laughter on his other side made Harry jump.
"Say, is that the Prophet?" James asked, catching sight of the abandoned paper in front of Harry's plate. "May I?"
. He and Remus were the only two seventh year Gryffindors not covered in splattered breakfast food. Some of the other years and nearby Houses weren't as lucky, either. "It's— ah— come in handy more than once."
Harry rubbed a weary hand over his face as he gave the Fat Lady the password and let himself into the common room.
He bowed extravagantly to Gertrude's flat, unimpressed stare.
Harry jolted, but luckily, James stood up and headed to the front of the room before anyone noticed.
She tossed her long, dark hair behind her shoulders, a pleased, wicked gleam in her dark eyes.
It all still felt like a dream.
"Padfoot! Get off! What—?"
It took him a moment to realize that, aside from the blood roaring in his ears, the common room was dead silent.
She smiled at him, a cheery, knowing look in her eyes and something fond underneath.
He threw the hat on the table directly in front of Sirius Black.
to be their friend. He wanted to know James as more than just the father who had stood up to Voldemort and died. He wanted to know Sirius in his prime, loyal, happy, wild, before Azkaban had dimmed a part of his light forever.
He couldn't change Wormtail. He couldn't change anything.
Dread slid like ice down his spine. His shoulders slumped as the weight of what he had just said fell on them.
wasn't a good man at this point in his life. There was potential for it, his desire to protect Lily almost noble, but… he only expected Harry to give up another friend to do it for "political" reasons, and then he would save Lily and never think twice about any of the other Muggle-borns…
Harry wished there were some way to force the rat to
"Not bad, Mallory," huffed Bowie, ending the dementor illusion. The whole class breathed a sigh of relief. "Five points to Slytherin for the save. Rosier, looks like you need a bit of practice. Knowing the incantation isn't enough if you can't perform the spell. And Mr. Parker,
Harry and Ron shared a look.
Rosier smirked and rose gracefully to his feet. He sauntered to the front of the room.
He latched onto the physical contact, onto the sound of her voice as she spoke soft encouragements.
James instantly sensed there was a right and a wrong answer, and he tensed, because Sirius would definitely—
They were hiding something, and it had something to do with the Death Eater families, with the Death Eater hopefuls.
But he got the feeling he couldn't— shouldn't— tell them his name.
"What?"
That spell could kill. That spell
apology to Snape as satisfaction. Be sure to have your second send it along as soon as you get cold feet."
Harry held onto Malfoy's sleeve and slowly, agonizingly, started to breathe.
"Wand movement?" James asked carefully. He had no idea how they had gotten on the subject.
He thought of Hermione and swallowed hard.
Harry shook his head, screwing his eyes shut hard, while Potter Senior looked truly baffled.
James stopped in the middle of the corridor. It was deserted except for them and the paintings.
Harry stormed through the hole in the wall into the main shop and cast a shield as a flurry of lights headed straight for him.
Malfoy's teasing expression turned thoughtful, too.
He had been wishing desperately to sink into the floor, to
Remus and dog-Sirius shared a longsuffering look. Then Sirius gave him that tongue-lolling grin.
"Who do you think cast a Killing Curse at him?" whispered Peter. "He's just a kid."
"What I said was far from amusing," sneered Snape. "This reaction is
"My friends and I were just wondering," she said. "Is Harry okay? Is he still in the hospital wing?"
, and, at length, Malfoy raised an eyebrow. He said, “Think you can make me?”
Looking far more distinguished and polished than he has in previous years, Potter exited the shop with Mr Malfoy a mere forty minutes after arrival in dark day suit (sans tie) and burgundy shirt that fit him to perfection. “He’s someone who takes his career and responsibilities seriously. Part of that is feeling that he’s representing the Ministry well, on all fronts,” Ms Greengrass said. “Though we’ll always be grateful for his actions as a seventeen year old, he felt it was time to stop dressing like one. And then there is the matter of his personal life.” Potter, she intimated, may already be involved in a
In the humid calm of Greenhouse Four, Neville could talk for days about plants and what he’d learned overseas, and never seemed to expect anything more from Harry than a nod and a smile; he even seemed surprised by Harry’s offers to help. Harry tilled the potted soil for him without complaint, spent time gathering ingredients from the edge of the forest — knotgrass and the like, simple things he was unlikely to misidentify. If it got late, McGonagall would ready a room for him, and Hagrid always invited him for tea in the mornings, always had rock cakes on the table, and usually something more edible. When Hagrid had to cut things short for an early class and there was a lag before the train arrived, Harry skipped stones over the undisturbed surface of the Great Lake to test how long it took before the Giant Squid got annoyed enough to slap at the water with a tentacle.
“Shut it,” Harry snapped. His hands had curled into fists, a low-level heat rolling behind his ribcage. That Malfoy would even presume that it was okay to dive into his life, after one dinner and a handful of Owls… Malfoy knew nothing about him —
And, well. Harry did actually. They all did, except those who addressed Harry by both title
Minerva blanches, but swiftly composes herself. “Hermione—”
“I know, me too. C’mon. It’s not safe here.” Harry pushes himself up, water sloshing over the lip of the tub. “It’ll get cold soon, anyway.”
in some Ministry circles, and—” Her teeth snapped shut with an audible click and she gave him a startled blink, followed by a helpless shrug.
Evasive truce over, Malfoy was suddenly, constantly underfoot, seeming to, if possible, have even fewer qualms about entertaining himself at Harry’s expense. He knew too many of Harry’s pressure points, could trigger them with minimal effort and devastating accuracy, using nothing more than a well-timed smirk and a lifted brow. Like a virus, he encroached on Harry’s space, swallowing the numb inertia of Harry’s days, transforming it into something else.
, that would have meant missing—” he dipped his tongue into the hollow of Potter’s collarbone “— an opportunity for another first page spread on your bloody heroism, wouldn’t it?”
“Well, you responded appropriately enough upon finding out.” He skimmed his hand down my stomach and rubbed over my erection, which I’d been dutifully ignoring. “You’re responding pretty well now, too.”
"What do you want," he said flatly.
, as much for its gold-leafed panels and dripping chandeliers, as for the constellations chalked over the waxed mahogany floors. They were still smeared, patterned with the powdery soles of dancing shoes, two centuries after its last event.
fucking home, do you see me going through
“No.” It just slips out, but so vehemently, Draco startles himself.
,” Harry said uncharitably. He thought, for one terrifying second, he might sick up onto Draco’s art deco rug, then followed that concern with the petty thought that Draco had it coming. Swallowing several times, Harry tossed his wand back and muttered, “The unicorn tear should prohibit its loyalty from transferring again. Why are you
Malfoy blows out a breath and turns around. He leans against his desk, arms folded, and looks at Harry for a beat. “It means whatever sex means between someone who doesn’t have a lot of options and someone who’s horny enough to take advantage of that fact, I guess.”
“I suppose,” Draco said, uncertain. He didn’t know if it really counted, the way they fucked off to their own beds the past few days when they were done — even if they’d woken each other multiple times in the middle of the night for more. Draco shifted and got the blankets out from under him, pulling them up, and Potter tugged half over to himself, snorting and casting a quick cleaning charm over the bed and his body.
“I don’t care,” he clips out. “Whether it’s bashfulness or hideously disfiguring scars, the clothes have to come off. If it’s the latter, I expect we’ll have to have a longer conversation,” he adds, propping himself against the wall to peel off his wet socks, “but that can wait until we’re warming by the fire, got it?”
“No, he won't. Leave it alone.”
” he said, then again, familiarising himself with it: “
At the far edge of the room, just a few feet from the locked door to the hall, is the loo. The door is cracked half-open, and Harry pushes on it tentatively, wincing when it creaks. But the moans and whispers he can hear from the hallway don’t even pause, so he slides inside and takes a look around. Shower, toilet, sink. A slender cupboard that, when checked, contains an extra set of ugly, grey, standard-issue Unspeakable robes, and a couple of dress shirts and pairs of trousers, their pleats still sharp on the hangers. A small travel bag with Malfoy’s initials on it rests on a stool, and Harry picks that up, too. On the counter, there’s a posh shaving kit and a row of what looks like custom-made hair potions or colognes, little glass bottles with crystal stoppers. Harry’s jaw tightens of its own accord before he forces himself to relax and breathe; there’s no point in resenting Malfoy for spending his money and time on frivolities, not now. In fact, Harry can’t be sure why it bothers him at all — it’s not as if he’d been expecting that Malfoy lived like a pauper to atone for his past.
“Whatever.” Draco lowered himself into his seat again and scowled at the orange stains on his gift. “Can you just go? I’m busy.”
, fuck you, right there,
Impossible to keep his eyes open. Harry closed them, disappointed, certain there was so much more to that thought. A hand gripped his, squeezed it firmly. Draco’s, he thought. Harry wanted to look, wanted the chance to figure out what he was missing, but didn’t have time.
"A honeymoon," Harry said, grimly amused.
“I was sure you hadn’t, until just now,” Minerva says. She steps away, but pauses across the threshold and turns back. “I’ve never heard you speak about an elf in that fashion before. I don’t wish for you to lose yourself.”
Malfoy’s hand fluttered on his hip; his fingers tightened with bruising force. He snapped his hips forward, a brutal, filling slide. It hurt, but the pain acted as its own sort of anesthetic, its own sort of turn-on. Nestled against Harry’s back, Harry could feel the racing speed of Malfoy’s heart during the hesitation that followed, the moment like Time-Turner, looping around in Harry’s mind.
“Malfoy.” Potter stops again and looks at him directly, mouth pressing into a tight line. “How do you propose we find them? Drop the net of a Summoning spell over France? Send a request for help that reaches London? The ones who weren’t killed in the siege are probably without a tether now, their families dead or changed. Elves are…” He grimaces, then bluntly says, “They’re useless when they’re grieving for the family they worked for. Their magic is too unfocussed, even damaging, flaring everywhere when they try the simplest of spells. It takes them a year or more to come to terms with the loss; it’s even worse than when they’re given clothes.”
“He’s just leaving, dear.” Narcissa drew a wand from her dressing gown.
“God.” Harry pulled off his glasses and scrubbed a hand over his face. Even knowing what a bastard Malfoy could be didn’t excuse him. “Look, what I said was—”
“How’s Hermione’s fellow treating you?”
Draco pulled away — but carefully, not removing himself entirely from Potter’s arms. “I said that, before. Is it a problem?”
Stymied, Harry cast about for ideas. Slowly, he said, “What if… What if
“Who did you
“I want all of it,” he says.
“Whatever.” Draco elbowed him away, reaching to pull his trousers up around his hips before twisting to check behind them. Unclenching when he saw they were still alone, he pulled the Cloak off, folded it in quarters, and draped it over the rail of the nearest cloak rack, side-eyeing Harry. “I have no idea how long we’ve been in here, but your absence has almost certainly been noticed by now. Clean us up so I can get back in there. I’ll tell people you had to check something in your department,” he said, shivering a little when Harry cast a wandless
“I got it.” Harry takes a step forward. “Did
Harry raises his eyebrows. “Aren’t we supposed to be telling the truth?”
“How can something that feels this way be temporary?” Harry asked.
“She’s—”
“I want you,” Harry said again, into Draco’s mouth — and again, hard against his jaw — and around the shell of his ear, licking into the outer curl of it — the only thing that came to mind, a babble. “I want you, I’ve
“Fuck— what?” Harry asked, trying to follow his train of thought. The kiss had felt like a good thing, but the temper with which Draco opened the door and pulled Harry out of the cloakroom, and the spiky lift of his shoulders as he dragged Harry along the corridor… didn’t. “Draco, where are we— what’s—?”
It was their last conversation before the day Harry had gone off to fifth year. Sometimes, Harry thought Sirius had known he wouldn’t live through the war, had been trying to prepare him for the inevitability of his absence. His heart so stupidly, recklessly loyal, his losses so close to the surface.
“The Muggle Studies cookbook was written in 1920, Malfoy. The one you have there is famous and it works like a charm,” he said, then paused. “I think. Hey, I’ve got to get going, but the classroom kitchen is free this afternoon. You should try it.”
you.”
And then he splayed his fingers out.
She sees him take it in, the formal address. It’s always been harder for her to use the titles of the people she grew up with in place of their names — there never seemed much point, honestly, if students weren't present — and she’s done her best to foster a relaxed enough atmosphere amongst the staff that they return the favour. She’s always disdained the awkwardness that seemed to permeate their social group when she got promoted, first to deputy Headmistress, then to Headmistress, but she’ll use it now if she has to, to keep from seeing the pity that might tear her to shreds.
And now you’re telling me—”
The sparkle that had caught Harry’s eye from a distance came from a shaft of sunlight touching pretty much the only spot left unrusted, a few inches of shiny metal on the frame. And the rest of the bicycle was in just as bad shape: spokes were missing or bent from each flattened tyre, the handlebars were warped, the rim over the front wheel horribly dented. If the pathetic thing ever had a saddle, it had long been eaten away by the elements or carried off by the Creatures who lived deeper in the woods.
Unfortunately, all of the liquor in Hogwarts, contraband or otherwise, has been transferred to the Hospital wing, upon her own bloody insistence. Healing spells tend to attract them for some reason, and though Hogwarts’ wards are holding for now — though Scotland hasn’t been as entirely overrun as other places have been, yet — it’s safer to do things the Muggle way, whenever they can. Which means holding the alcohol aside for when they run out of sanitising soap, and making whatever other preparations she can for the moment things start to collapse. She’s sitting in a thousand-year-old house of cards, and almost wishes she didn’t know how precarious their position is.
“I jotted them down in descending order of importance,” Draco says. Stupid though it may be, he finds having a tangible outline oddly soothing. Besides which, Weasley is, by all of Harry's accounts, a solid strategist; that nauseating
Draco stares into Harry’s wide, green gaze and licks the slick of Harry’s kiss from his lips. Those tiny creases appear around the corners of Harry’s mouth — and eyes, too; a smile this time, not a smirk — and Draco gathers his wits about him.
To his surprise, he’s wrong on both counts. After only a few seconds, Malfoy strolls in, still fully dressed in smart grey trousers and a white shirt, a slightly puzzled look on his face. He’s missing his ever-present tie, and has folded his sleeves back to the elbow, but if Malfoy was on his way to bed, it’s clear he was only just. Harry opens his mouth to apologise for the hour when Malfoy falters with recognition, but Malfoy recovers too quickly and strides closer, a small frown checked between his eyebrows, and kneels down..
“If you’re really not interested, don’t bother trying to wrap your head around it,” Malfoy said loftily. “That’d take me another month to explain it to you and we don’t have that kind of time. So.” He straightened his shoulders, the tendon above his collarbone going taut. “I want you to be a client of mine.”
His love for Ron has
Does fantasising about seeing Potter in a Slytherin tie count?
“And I’ve no doubt Astoria has some fine escort services in her contacts,” Draco said, squirming. He got a hand between them, pushed on Harry’s chest. With a deep frown that did nothing at all to hide his blush, he said, “For those clients who have certain needs, but want to be discrete.”
make his head fall off) and stares up at his bed hangings to follow the wisp of thought before it disappears.
“You just said—” Harry thought of Theo’s outburst on Christmas and, over the roar in his ears, doggedly said, “I thought you knew how I felt.”
“—what Draco said,” Granger says slowly. Allowing the interruption without quibble, Narcissa relaxes into the sofa as Granger continues, “He said that he and Harry thought blood purity was a factor; that they had
The back of Draco’s hand finds his cheek again. With a vague air of bewilderment, he says, “Not with me.”
“Maybe. So?”
There’s a tug in Draco’s midsection, a wrench of fear that doesn’t belong to him. He's sought out the delicate thread linking their magic a few times since Harry rediscovered it, prodding at it curiously while Harry sleeps, before remembering how much it drained from him to Heal Harry’s wounds — how much it
“No,” Harry lied. He stared at his reflection as Ron held up the set of formal robes in solid black; they were Harry’s favourite, unadorned beyond the single, long row of onyx buttons down the front, and so severely tailored that Draco’s jaw had gone hard as granite when Harry had tried them on. But they were comfortable as well, the split up each side to the hip allowing for movement, and since Draco had taught him to dance, Harry had hopes he’d be able to use the skill on him. If he was able to wear him down. “He likes me,” Harry said, trying to sound confident. “Robards just… I don’t know.” He shook his head, unable to think up an excuse for Draco’s resistance now that Robards had no leverage. “He’ll be there.”
, he wrote, as though Harry might have forgotten the time Draco got so drunk Harry had to had to Side-Along him home.
“I’m not so sure about that.” Harry shook his head. “She was pretty angry. But I suppose there was a witness who told her I’d only stepped in to offer help—”
“Do you honestly think so?” Harry held his breath. Draco’s gaze shifted, slowly, to meet his. He pressed his lips together and shook his head. Harry exhaled, and reached for a towel to wipe off his hands, then a roll of clean gauze. “Me neither,” he said, looping the gauze around Draco’s hand,
“This is what he wants,” Hermione said, a steely undercurrent to her voice. “It should be what you want, too. I can’t believe even you’d be so spiteful to—”
Blood simmering, Harry pushed down the immediate inclination to argue and tried to consider that as if Hermione had been the one to say it. They were in the phase Bill had referred to as marital transition. A honeymoon. Those, as far as he knew, consisted mostly of things they weren’t allowed to do, and the one thing they’d done sixteen times so far.
“Draco?” Harry prompts after a few moments, gentle as the hands he’s running up and down the outside of Draco’s arms.
“Don't,” Draco says again. He closes his eyes.
“You’re sleeping at my house, remember, darling?” she said, glaring up at Harry when he snorted another laugh. “And he’s
“I— have one for you, too. It’s—”
, don’t let anything ha—” The stifled sound of elves shrieking in the background covers up the rest of what she says. The call goes dead.
for it. But it’s perfectly normal otherwise.”
My own hard on was straining, the head jerking wet against my stomach, my trousers and pants down to my hips. I rubbed over my dick with the heel of my palm, then gripped the base and cleared my throat. “Absolutely. So if we could get this over with…?”
. Then Malfoy gave a small, stifled groan, his throat working even when he fell silent, and lifted against him. Harry sank inside, a long, smooth drive forward to encase himself in Malfoy’s heat until his hips were tight against Malfoy’s buttocks, his heart slamming so hard he thought it might break out of his chest.
“I was
A small crowd is assembled: Blaise and Pansy (standing suspiciously close to Ginevra Weasely, who has no reason to even be here); Hannah and Longbottom — her smiling wide, him a bit sheepishly — are next to Weasley and Granger (who also don’t have a reason to be there, except that they’re Potter’s best mates, and since they both look sort of stoic, Draco won’t object); several of Draco’s friendlier coworkers. He doesn’t
“I don’t know,” Hermione says, disturbed she hadn’t considered that. “And I wouldn’t want the elves to be involved. But it might be irrelevant; we’ll cross that hurdle when we come to it, I suppose.”
“How are the children?” Hermione asks belatedly. They tried, for the first few days, to keep things as routine as possible, but as more of the injured and dead arrived to Hogsmeade, as more children began to really fear for their families, the schedule of classes fell to the wayside. They have one or two per week now, all years and every House huddled together in an expanded classroom, trying to absorb whatever lesson is being taught — usually Defence, and often without using magic. Minerva volunteered to hold daily sessions answering any other questions the children may have.
Selfish, he calls himself. It’s not the first time Harry’s heard that from him in the last few days. But Harry doesn't agree with Draco’s assessment of himself, even after his earlier revelation — a revelation of Harry's own. In Harry’s experience, truly selfish people don’t care that they are. Shame and guilt simply aren’t a presence in their lives, whereas Draco harbours an abundance of both.
Harry scowled, bristling automatically.
With great dignity, the lion hopped to the ground. His shaggy, golden head high, he sauntered away from the Slytherin table and straight up to the teachers' table. Remus provided the enchantment to make him purr, deep and rumbling in his fictional chest. And, like James's mother's dearly beloved cat, the lion slinked leisurely up to Professor Dumbledore and butted his massive head into the headmaster's chair, demanding pets and adoration.
The Slytherin Ilvermorny boy, James noticed, had conjured an umbrella and was watching the commotion with the dry interest of a scholar, untouched.
But Dumbledore's warnings rang in Harry's ears, and he ducked his head in silence.
Harry looked away, disquiet prickling, and studied the other players, trying to pick out which ones were regular team members and which were auditioning.
Why, dear God,
closed, not like Diagon Alley. They did some of their best, shadiest business in the dark of night.
His body
But something had just clicked for Harry.
There were three wizards in hooded cloaks making their way furtively toward the backdoor of Everest Wands.
It took a second for the words to compute. And then James saw red.
one of Harry's close friends, though James had his doubts about that— had heard about it, so it must have made some waves in America, but it hadn't traveled any farther than that.
Harry's chest went cold.
"It's nothing," muttered Harry, at the same time Malfoy said,

, Harry. And he chose you. Your compatibility must be—"
Their patch of the tapestry was so small, a negligible portion of a tree that spanned centuries of the line — so many interconnected names, spouses and offspring, and on and on, each with stories of their own. Some of them were terrible, Harry was sure, and others good, the way people tried to be when they weren't taught not to be. And Harry didn’t care about any of them. He felt consumed by those few square inches of space, and the work he knew Draco must have put into filling it.
Potter,” I said, but it came out rough and dazed rather than with the cold disdain I’d intended. This was a— a game. A trick, perhaps. He didn’t hate me, my perfect arse. Sure he didn’t. And I had a rule, anyway, about letting myself become someone’s experiment. Potter needed to
What had
“Darling,” Draco whispered. No. No. Oh, god, please. Not her.
Harry went back to the chair, unable to pinpoint why he even cared. “What are you doing with them?”
“Oh, god.” It’s lace. Draco’s wearing lace knickers, white and delicate, his ashy-blond pubic hair visible through them. Harry can’t see his cock — it’s angled to the side, still hidden by terrycloth — but… “Let me see,” he whispers.
“So it’s entirely unconscious of you, then.”
The story begins like this: The world was nothing once but lonely particles floating in space. The universe formed from their collisions, they were so desperate for contact. Earth had no focus and was chaotic, too hot to create life and too combustible to sustain it, until two motes of magic, small but powerful, were drawn to one another from across the furthest reaches of it though they hated each other. They clashed, and fought when they couldn’t get separate, so they tried to coalesce but couldn’t do that either.
is heavily implied in his expression, a sentiment Hermione secretly agrees with.
, Harry remembered him saying, and hardened his voice, “—have a problem with him?”
A new knot twists itself in Harry’s stomach, his skin breaking out in chills. Company for the cold sweat already slicking the back of his neck. “No, I don’t think so.” He makes himself look casually around the meadow, then takes a few steps away. “What’s happening with— that?”
Well, that was… easier than he’d thought it’d be.
“Kreacher!” Harry barked. He wanted to sink into the floor. “You weren’t even supposed to be in here.” Draco turned to him, the unmarked side of his face decidedly amused, his good eyebrow lifted. Harry shook his head. “And I didn’t cry, or, or call you my love.”
Sighing, Hermione looks around the committee assembled before her, composed of the Unspeakables, about a third of the staff, and the few witches and wizards from the general populace who made it to Hogwarts and who have training in particularly helpful fields. That they can claim a certain level of magical expertise doesn’t make the inevitable answer to her next question any less annoying. “Are there any other issues?”
Then Sirius was on top of him, shoving his face into the table, where James's half-eaten pie smeared across his glasses.
He couldn't
Silence fell like a rock in their midst.
How could he, a Slytherin, a bearer of the Dark Mark, trust and confide in Albus Dumbledore? It was ludicrous. It was…. He was starting to think it was
"That won't be necessary, Miss Evans," said Bowie, with a grin that reminded Harry of Mad-Eye Moody just before a fight. "I already know what I want to teach you lot, and it has nothing to do with exams. How many of you are Muggle-borns or half-bloods? Oh, alright, Slytherins, I know you're not going to answer. My point is… I'm going to teach you to

A slip of parchment poofed into existence above Dumbledore's desk and fluttered down.
He shook her. "Come on, Hermione! Don't do this! What do I do?
"No, James is onto something," said Remus quietly, before James could come up with a defense. He was still looking at the floor with a faraway, pensive gaze. "I think Harry must have some sort of medical issue, maybe even something like— like mine. He's seen Madam Pomfrey before term even started, like I had to my first year. All last night and today, I could… I could smell healing potions on him. And did you notice how stiffly he moved whenever he had to sit down or stand up? It reminded me of last year when— when you broke a couple of my ribs, remember?"
The snake slithered slowly, sinisterly across the Great Hall, hissing lowly.
"James won't do anything to upset Lily," said Marlene matter-of-factly. "He's a fool for her. And Sirius Black knows better than to mess with
Harry didn't know what to say.
"Don't be absurd," said Snape again. "Neither of us needs to practice the Shield Charm. We're not idiots, unlike the rest of these mollycoddled children."
Harry allowed himself to be ushered onto the bench next to James, hardly flinching at all at his touch, and he looked down to find a glimmering golden plate and goblet appear before him.
Behind him, he thought he heard Malfoy mutter something about idiotic Gryffindors before he started after him.
"I'll be taking N.E.W.T.s in Transfiguration, Potions, Charms, Arithmancy, Herbology, and Ancient Runes," Hermione whispered. "I think I'm rather done with Defense. What about you?"
Sirius gave him an odd look.
"I jumped in front of—" Malfoy broke off suddenly and frowned, looking away. He repeated, more to himself than Harry, "I'm not dead. This isn't right."
. That must be it."
"That's not what you said about the mir—"
The smartly dressed children had been bloodied by fierce battle, dead, or both.
She immediately set them up with mirrors and had them work on human-to-animal partial transfigurations.
Harry didn't like Peter at all, and they had no idea why.
Harry looked up into the young, bespectacled face of James Potter, grinning ear to ear and waving like a lunatic.
The older Slytherins seemed to know to leave him alone during that time, but Draco didn't appreciate Potter's little group of Gryffindors throwing insults and a few hexes in the corridors between classes. Potter was never with them those times— he seemed to have been adopted by the Gryffindor girls like a delicate unicorn foal— but Draco couldn't help but feel a little resentful.
"He can be," Lily said. "Anyway, Mallory, I actually wanted to congratulate you on the duel."
If Dumbledore and Malfoy were right, getting back to the future was already within Harry's power. They wouldn't find what they were looking for in the library.
"—And third, Lily goes to Hogsmeade with
"Yes, I believe so," said Draco. "It's not his handwriting, though. He wouldn't be so stupid as to write something like that down, anyway. It was probably his last partner, Watters-or-what-have-you. He'd have been tortured for not being able to keep up the information network in Dolohov's absence."
There was no mistaking that long, pale face, so often twisted in rage or contempt. Here was the man who had cursed Hermione in their fifth year in the battle at the Department of Mysteries, who would have killed her if she had not
Lily didn't look at him right away. She looked at a flower than had fallen onto her empty plate and, with gentle, slender fingertips, picked it up. She cupped it in her hands, transfixed. Her lips twitched and quivered, struggling not to smile.
Hermione had given them coins charmed like she had done in their fifth year for Dumbledore's Army meetings. Dawlins, the erstwhile Head Auror, was supposed to be watching the other coin back at the headquarters.
"What do you mean, Mr. Malfoy?"
" cried Sirius again, lashing out with that fiery orange blast. "
But Harry reminded himself that this wasn't his McGonagall. She hadn't survived Dumbledore's death yet. She hadn't fought Death Eaters roaming the halls of her beloved Hogwarts, and she hadn't turned the school she loved into the last foothold, the last stand of the Light and then watched it be smashed into rumble and bones.
Harry didn't care. He was panting, his anger suddenly white-hot, and looking at Malfoy like he'd never seen him before.
"Look," said Harry once he had gotten control of himself again. He still felt cold and shaken, but he continued firmly, "I'm not going to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey doesn't have anything for me. You just go back to class. I'm gonna… I'm gonna go back to the library for a bit."
"Gee, let's think about that one," said Sirius. "It couldn't be related to him mentioning that
Dying hadn't hurt last time.
And so Draco smiled politely, pretended he didn't notice the first few times they tried to get into his locked and warded possessions, and kept his focus split between Severus and finding a way back to his own time.
Harry blinked furiously and looked at the ceiling, trying to hold back the well of emotions that raged in his suddenly empty, cavernous chest.
"Trudy told me what you did," said the girl, taking Harry by the elbow and leading him to the sofa directly in front of the fire. She pulled him down next to her. It was intimate, Harry found, but there was nothing romantic or playful in her eyes. "I'm her sister, Marlene. Harry…
He wondered what cosmic force had reared its head to make that happen. It was inconceivable….
"Oh," said Draco faintly. He didn't understand precisely how, but he knew… "It was Potter."
Draco sighed and ushered them in.
Fighting the deep, consuming tidal wave of grief and rage, Harry forced himself to pay attention to the duel in front of him.
magic permeating every molecule in the room.
"Yeah," said Harry again. He was pressing his fingers harder into the table, tapping more insistently.
She had never placed her last hope, the lives of her students and friends, into the hands of Harry Potter.
James helpfully bent down before reaching Sirius and picked up one of his shoes, which had been blasted off amongst the various explosion curses. He handed it back to a stunned Sirius and gave him a comforting pat on the shoulder.
You can never fit it into your mouth! Not once have you—"
it was you two who did it! Although how you got into the Slytherin dorms… always sneaking around… you
and caught James's wand in his free hand.
Poor Ron, Harry thought absently. He was no doubt daydreaming about puff pastries.
and the life he could have had. It wasn't just Harry's loss. The wizarding world, Sirius and Remus's generation especially, had lost something truly remarkable with the death of James Potter.
"Our relationship is complicated."
Hermione sighed softly. She peeked again around the corner of her window and catalogued the miniscule changes. No sign of Dolohov.
"Cheers. Third year, those dementors…."
Draco's mind spun.
He watched only half-heartedly, his mind on death, as he had known it would be.
First, he understood he was lying on something hard. Then he understood he had a body, and, as soon as he remembered that, his body
A proportionally sized mammalian ear. Harry thought abruptly of Sirius changing parts of his face into Snuffles over the Christmas holiday at Grimmauld Place to amuse them when Arthur had been in the hospital. He and Tonks had gotten into a competition, which Tonks had inevitably won, having a wider variety in her arsenal, but it had been one of the few fond memories of that dismal time.
He had classes coming up soon, if he hadn't already missed his first period.
It took a moment for the implications to hit him, then he and Malfoy looked up at each other, identical looks of horror on their faces.
"I don't…" he began but had to stop and catch his breath. He tried again, voice hoarse, "I don't
, felt weak and jello-y.
"You know," said Lily, looking between Harry and Malfoy both. "Whenever you need them taken down a peg, you don't have to challenge them to a duel in front of hundreds of witnesses. Just let me and Marlene know. I'm very good at Pilchardo Dispucto, and Marlene is terrifying with a Tentacle Head Curse."
ago, you berk!" Sirius was saying as he and James wrestled over the table. "We let you take the best house, and
"We don't know he's a rule humper," said James, rolling his neck to release some of the tension in his muscles. "He hasn't done anything yet."
"Sorry, Professor," said James, a shifting movement out of the corner of Harry's eye. "I forgot— apparently Madam Pomfrey excused him from practicals for the week."
But Flitwick had just managed to Disarm Bowie with a picture-perfect spell, ricocheting it around Bowie's shield charm like a hook.
"No, Parker, that's exactly why I can't," said Snape. "That's why I'm trying to warn you. The political atmosphere outside these walls is extremely volatile. You can't have ties to both sides."
Ron suddenly looked very interested in the titles of the books on the shelves.
"What scar?" Remus asked.
It would be an early death sentence to any potential friendship with them if they thought he had already befriended the Slytherins, though. Sirius was not the kind of person to let that go, especially as a teenager.
dormmates had tried to torture and maim him in his sleep. He couldn't even fathom them doing something as— as
Lily raised an eyebrow and smirked.
when we egged the Slytherins!"
"You're just a figment of my imagination," Harry told Draco, bracing himself. "Unless, of course, you died at the exact same time as me, and we're both here at the same time… which might explain Knockturn Alley, at least, but is also highly unlikely…."
Harry's fists clenched around his book. His foot tapped rhythmically against the leg of the table.
Dolohov, who was as free as a bird in this timeline, torturing poor Gertrude before he planned to kill her too. Dolohov, with Voldemort, who was still alive and reigning in terror, despite the fact that Harry had
Malfoy glanced away, for all appearances unruffled, but his jaw was clenched and flexing. He still looked strange with his chestnut-brown hair. Instead of slicking it back like his usual platinum blond hair, he allowed it to fall loose, free around his face.
"We're dead. We have to move on. Which direction is the afterlife? I'd hate to accidentally go back and end up a Hogwarts ghost, wouldn't you?"
Sirius had gone less for creativity and more for explosions.
The illusion-man's wand flew from his grasp and into the air, where it vanished with a flick of Bowie's wand.
Mallory got the Keeper position, James noted, ignoring Sirius. He was pretty good. It made him wonder how good he was as a Seeker if Keeper was only his second choice.
"I challenge you, sir," said James imperiously, looking down his nose at Sirius, "to a duel… of
A lump in Draco's throat made it hard to swallow.
Black had the nerve to roll his eyes as if it didn't matter. He said, "If you want contact, we'll need thirds. Our seconds won't get along long enough to pass a message. HEY MOONY, YOU'RE MY THIRD!" He shouted down the table.
in challenging Sirius to defend a friend's honor. It was… it was downright Gryffindor of him. Even Lily approved.
Dumbledore scrutinized him quietly.
The blinded, deafened Slytherins were not prepared to be physically struck by projectiles. They jumped around, screaming and pointing wands, though they had no idea what they were pointing at, because the projectiles turned gooey and slimy after they struck their targets, and what
Harry understood.
Harry waited patiently. Dumbledore had been much more comforting and informative, but perhaps he was busy this time. Or maybe 'his party' wasn't cooperating this time, because it wouldn't give him robes, either.
Yes, Draco knew a jinx when he heard it.
Plates, serving platters, and food went soaring like twin tidal waves on either side of his body.
"So," murmured Malfoy, as they stood at the back of the line and the first years were Sorted. "Do you mind telling me what you know that I don't know?"
Draco knew intimately well how terrible a position that was, and Harry was far more of a righteous, martyring bastard than he was.
Draco got it. And he was starting to regret acting so impulsively.
"At this rate, I won't get my turn to hex Black for another ten minutes."
d him earlier in the duel. Here was the man who had come after them in the Tottenham Court Road café after Bill and Fluer's wedding, who would have taken them out before they even got their feet under them in the new warring world.
Sirius and Remus shared a speaking glance before they released him.
Sirius had been getting frustrated… and then Harry had called out that blasted suggestion. That helpful hint. That traitorous, backstabbing observation.
Draco didn't know what to do. The Marauders had spent six years building up a following in the school, becoming idols, while Draco was the new kid. And Severus had spent six years establishing himself as an oddball outcast. They didn't have a leg to stand on.
Harry couldn't read it without his glasses.
They sobbed with laughter.
team? Harry wasn't on the Gryffindor team. He didn't need to spy on the competition like James and Sirius. Moreover, just the sight of a Snitch at breakfast had made him break out in a cold sweat. He didn't know…. It was stupid, but…. The last time he had been on a broom, Crabbe had died. He had been screaming, shrill and animalistic, as flames devoured him. Harry would remember that sound for the rest of his life. The last time he had been surrounded by his friends on broomsticks had been when he'd left Privet Drive for the final time. Mad-Eye Moody had died, killed by Voldemort as Harry and Hagrid tried to outrun him on that horrible flying motorbike, and Harry had been terrified Hagrid had died, too, plummeting from the sky after
A wild-haired man with an eyepatch and one arm raised his three-fingered hand in the air to accept his applause, which was rather loud and jubilant for a simple professor's return from a vacation.
"You're not— you're not going to kill me?"
Like peas in a pod, Harry thought sardonically, feeling his own ribs ache in sympathy.
As he made his way over to Harry, Harry couldn't help but remember the first time he had visited Ollivander's as a child. Ollivander had remembered James and Lily's wands, sold so long ago.
He had expected to die jumping in front of that curse. He hadn't planned it, of course, but the outcome had registered even as he had moved to do it.
a good person. And you? You do
"Last time," Harry mused, "it was King's Cross Station. I think it was symbolic— a junction between two places, a means of transportation to move on or go back. Why a random street in
They sat down to curious stares from their housemates, who were no doubt wondering what had taken them so long at the Gryffindor table, before some even less tactful morons saw that it was Snape and then pointed and laughed.
"In the best magical library in Britain," said Malfoy, "which is here."
Draco… could reluctantly admit he'd been more of an immature brat with his forays into practical jokes in the past. The Marauders made it into an art. Their skill with magic, even for seventh years, was impressive. Their confidence and camaraderie made it hard not to envy them.
Remus finally separated them.
"Thanks," he said eventually. "For the talk, and for the save back in the duel."
And Harry nodded. He took a deep breath and looked down at the broom in his hands. It was an old model, older than anything he'd seen at his Hogwarts, but it looked to be brand new for this timeline. It was far newer than the usual loaner broomsticks.
While Remus had the fire-eagle swooping, twirling, and soaring like the apex flyer it was, Sirius shot off a spell under the table to ignite the fireworks surrounding Ravenclaw table.
Did Dumbledore know Harry that well already?
"YOU— THEY— WHAT—
Sure, Potter Senior looked like a downright idiot, dumping raw eggs on the whole Slytherin table and getting into a fish-hands slapfest with his equally idiotic friend, but Draco couldn't see why Harry wouldn't like him. Harry was, in Draco's not so humble opinion, just as idiotic.
They fought well together, Harry and Ron. They moved in sync from years of knowing each other, from being able to predict what the other would do without the need for words, even if they didn't know specifics. They didn't need to know specifics. They just needed to know:
Now, he made sure to telegraph his approach, stomping louder than he would normally walk, coughing as if to clear his throat, rustling in his bag and crinkling parchment. Those who surprised Harry tended to get a wand in their face or, in some cases, Disarmed before they could even blink.
points for the Firestorm Spell, which I'll be teaching this year, but I'm not surprised you either don't know it or didn't dare use it in a classroom. Alright, Miss Evans, have a seat. Let's see… Mr. Rosier, you were so enthusiastic earlier. Why don't you come try your hand next?"
to get from Ilvermorny to Hogwarts, James was sure he hadn't actually taken a bite yet.
He held it like a lifeline.
But once someone was in the bubble, they were trapped.
Bowie was silent for a moment, considering his useless spell. Then he just said, "You Ilvermorny boys are fuckin'
He grinned and lifted his face toward the sky, rising higher and higher.
"No," said Draco. "I'll take Po-uh-Parker." To Harry, he said, "You're, ah, sure about this? I mean, I know he's…." He shot a sideways, uncomfortable glance at Black, whom he knew was Harry's godfather.
Peter didn't say anything.
He and Flitwick turned to each other, bowed at the waist, and assumed their stances, wands raised.
With Kettleburn's full-bellied laugh, the lion made his way off the teacher's platform and toward the Gryffindor table.
Where were Ron and the Aurors?
Draco knew what spell he was going to utter before he even opened his mouth. He didn't think, didn't pause to consider what he was doing.
If she absolutely
Harry shoved him again. Fury was giving way to terror, and he hated it.
"What!" squawked Sirius indignantly. He raised himself up and said, "I accept your challenge, Sir Flops-a-lot, because I have…
Lily waved it off. She pulled out her own Potions textbook and a roll of parchment. "It's not your fault. I know it must be difficult moving to a new place without all your old friends and teachers and such. I'm just glad you're finally settling in, even if it does mean flying around with Potter and Black."
He forced the flashbacks away, back in that place with the ferocious, all-devouring blackhole somewhere deep in his chest.
"No? I forget. It was all nonsense, anyway, what does it matter?"
And even though Harry hadn't been able to stand up for Snape in that awful memory in the Pensieve in fifth year, he was standing up for him now.
"We trashed the lily idea
The attention hadn't suited Crabbe. He was the best at performing the Cruciatus Curse in their year, and he made sure all the terrified lower years knew it. He had taken aim at Draco more than once for trying to reign him in, but Draco had spent a whole summer and Christmas break hosting the Dark Lord at Malfoy Manor and was usually quick enough to avoid it.
"Morning…?" said Harry.
But Sirius couldn't see where he was aiming through the smoke, and the curse went wide, missing Malfoy entirely and soaring into the audience of students. The professors were on the wrong side of the stage, Sirius's side, they were too slow—
to thwart Voldemort's plans. And instead of making Kreacher drink that potion in the cave a second time, he had done it himself. He had chosen to sacrifice his own life instead of a house elf's, despite everything he must have been raised to believe. And Sirius— Sirius had died rushing to Harry's rescue. Stupid, reckless… wonderful, brilliant, loyal Sirius.
He wasn't clear on how to exact his revenge just yet, but he trusted his instincts, his cunning, to have something by dawn.
"Right," said James, nodding even as he practically gasped to catch his breath.
Harry didn't know how long he stood in the broom cupboard, but a sense of time passing abruptly seemed important.
Harry didn't feel like smiling. He didn't know if he'd ever be able to play Quidditch again without thinking about the Resurrection Stone inside the Snitch, of walking to his own death.
"You think this is a joke," said Malfoy. He sounded as if he had finally realized the crux of the dispute between them. His lips went thin as he, too, raised his wand. "Parker was right. You're just a kid, Black. And you need to grow up."
Harry knew what it was like to look at Voldemort's face while he uttered those last two words.
"Why does everyone think Mallory is my friend?"
Severus hovered closer and murmured where only Draco could hear, "Regulus Black. He's a sixth year, but he's good. Not quite up to Bellatrix's level, but enough to wipe the floor with Lupin. And he'd enjoy a go at his disgraced brother."
pouring every ounce of his magic, every fiber of his being into it.
Even from the stands where Harry sat alone, he could see Malfoy's grin, sharpened by that familiar edge of competitiveness.
"That little hobgoblin," muttered Malfoy, seething.
And Hermione knows what she's supposed to say — Minerva words are a search for reassurance, for caution; she only wants to be sure Hermione is still the girl her professor half-raised, that she knows what she’s doing. But some truths are too dangerous to impart, and the rest of them… are no longer true.
of having done a— a good job for you. That gets you off.”
“No, I can’t; I’ve got my own mysterious errand to do over there,” Draco says with a sarcastic wave of his hand. Potter snorts softly, his tenuous smile flashing wide and unchecked for a beat, then ducks in through the shattered storefront. He returns in less than a minute and escorts Draco into the shop. It’s dim, and for a moment Draco thinks it’s been pillaged before it occurs to him that many of the clothing displays are
I mean, Potter is—” She made that strangled sound again and growled, shaking her head. “Goddammit!”
” Draco mouths, meeting his eyes.
“Don’t
But that wasn’t it. Harry hadn’t missed the subtle strategy of Draco’s activities; he’d focussed most of his considerable charm to influence those few Harry would ultimately report to, and a wider circle comprised of those more conservative members on the Wizengamot who might one day decide to question Harry’s judgement.
“He asked me about you,” Pansy said. She poked him in the ribs and Draco sighed, stretching out his arm over her pillow. Pansy rested her head on it and curled up against him, wrapping one arm around his midsection, and it really was tiresome of her to make him feel soothed when he didn’t
“So you say, and yet I notice you haven’t started riding my cock yet.”
Draco looked at him for a beat — and then started laughing, a wheezy, helpless sound. He covered his face with his hands, his elbows pressing into his thighs, shoulders rounded and shaking, his head along with them. Laughing, like someone who belonged in the Janus Thickey ward.
“Fuck,” Harry grinds out, swallowing hard. Draco’s toes tighten around his finger and Harry realises he’s been stroking between them harder, faster. He pulls away, balling up his hands. “Yes.”
They were engaged, after all.
Malfoy scoffed. “That’s exactly what I mean; the letter versus the spirit. Constantly trying to get away from each other isn’t what… people in this position
“Are you okay?”
“Well, you were just explaining to me why we should try harder in our marriage…”
He woke up once more before dawn, Draco’s long body curling against his back. Draco’s fingers were already slippery with lube, lightly teasing Harry’s rim. Harry sighed, shifting against him, restless for it already but wanting it to last. He tilted his head on the pillow and Draco dropped an open-mouthed kiss to the hinge of his jaw.
Pansy squeaked, and Draco stepped forward with real concern. “Leave one what empty? What was that light? Pansy, what did you—?
Nott hit the ground. There was a purple flare of fire, and then so did Hermione.
He couldn't think, couldn't remember where he was or which Sirius he was talking to.
"Gertrude McKinnon," said the girl through her stuffy, broken nose. "I'm— I'm Gertrude McKinnon."
"Yes, Professor," they said in unison. They even had the same rehearsed, contrite tone.
Malfoy pushed the broom back at him. "I'm not asking you to play Quidditch. I'm just saying you should get back in the air for a minute. It'll do you some good, you broody, morose arse."
"Fine," said Harry, pretending his voice wasn't trembling. "As long as we get him."
He considered going to Malfoy about it but discarded that idea instantly. Malfoy didn't know about the Hallows or the role they had played in the war. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Dumbledore were the only ones who had chased that particular fairy tale. Even Voldemort had only been interested in the Elder Wand; he might not have ever heard Beetle the Bard's stories, growing up in a Muggle orphanage as he had. He wouldn't have spoken to his Death Eaters about anything other than a particularly powerful wand, the Deathstick.
"If you managed to weasel your way into a relationship under Potter and Lupin's noses, and despite Mallory, I'd be inclined to agree."
Draco sniffed, straightened his shoulders and the arrogant tilt of his jaw, and glided up to the stool. McGonagall placed the hat on his head.
"No," said Harry, flushing. Then, "In primary school. Muggle, I mean. My cousin…" He trailed off.
James nodded, already rummaging through his robes for a spare bit of parchment and a quill, Harry thought. Either that, or he was patting himself down very indecently in public. With him, it was usually a toss-up.
before committing to their cover story. He'd never visited, though, and he had only met one American wizard in his life.
fault."
. Surely the whole magical world would have heard about that, would have been in an absolute uproar. It would have made the front page of every paper worldwide.
"What are you talking about?"
James grinned even brighter. "Thanks! We— me and Sirius, that is— put a lot of time into human-animal transfiguration last year."
Harry stared back defiantly, even with that haunted look in his eyes as if his entire world had shattered around him.
"Yeah," muttered Sirius.
Draco's mind went blank. He had no idea what to say, what to do.
"Mr. Parker, has Ilvermorny perhaps taught the Patronus Charm?"
"If he were… my master… I bet he would have found that— disappointing!"
"I'll send for her at once," said Dumbledore and, true to his word, he murmured something to his phoenix. The bird took off through the open window. Then he knelt in front of McKinnon and, said, regretfully, "I would help you myself, my dear, except I seem to have misplaced my wand recently."
"Do you know what it is?"
"What if their families were enemies of Voldemort from the very beginning? They ran when he first publicly opposed the Ministry… Voldemort found them in America… and so they ran back here to Dumbledore. For all we know, Voldemort is hunting Harry, and maybe Mallory, for something their parents did, or something their parents know."
"It's not bloody hard to spot, Prongs, of course he's—"
— hadn't been working with Dolohov, as he'd suspected in the heat of battle. But considering Malfoy's controvertible actions during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry wasn't quite ready to trust him on that.
And then,
His shabby, perfect professor. Tea and grindylows and werewolves.
James had never gotten the full story about what had happened, only that he and his mother had gotten into an argument— nothing unusual there— but it had escalated until she had reached for her wand. When the usual Stinging Hexes and other minor curses failed to shut him up, it had gotten… bad.
"You think… it was the school itself he attacked?" asked James slowly, tasting the words to see how they felt in his mouth. It didn't sound…
Never mind, Harry absolutely wanted to melt into the floor. His eyes were wide, mortified, as James and Lily both turned expectant looks on him, one filled with dire warning and the other hidden mischief.
"So be it!"
He didn't— he had never even
"The duel goes to Mr. Mallory. However, our instructions on non-lethal parameters were clear. Whatever that spell was, it was too much for a gentleman's duel, kid. You're out. Thirds and fourths, do you wish to continue?"
"Good morning, Evans," he said, only partially sounding suspicious.
He had tortured and killed Muggles and Muggleborns in both wars with glee.
call him by his given name, he supposed he could allow it. His family— and the rest of the Slytherin House, honestly— would have been horrified to hear a Mudbl— a Muggle-born call a pureblood by their first name, but his family didn't need to know. And the Slytherin House could get crushed under the lake for all he cared.
Remus gave Sirius a look that could have scorched paint off a wall, but this his eyes moved to meet James's, and he gave a fraction of a nod.
They were waiting amongst the first years to be Sorted. The younger students eyed them with awe and wariness.
"Your friend is a Kneazle turd, sir, and I accept your challenge!" said Bowie, swiping up Flitwick's hat and brandishing it like a disgraceful, failing term paper. "I name wands as our weapons of competition!"
"Regulus," said Harry, thinking of his bedroom door at Grimmauld Place, of a fake Horcrux and a note signed R.A.B. Of Kreacher's profound loyalty and grief.
"So you're the buggered class," said Professor Bowie, not bothering to stand up from behind his desk or put out his cigarette. Even the door into the corridor was left open. "First class to have a different Defense professor every year, I hear, and you'll be trying to scrape together a passing N.E.W.T. at the end of this."
— but
"But what he did," said Harry, with an edge of desperation, "it was
been?
And the ghost of James Potter would smile at Harry and walk with him to his death.
Why the hell had he volunteered to go with Malfoy when he knew he'd just spend the next couple of hours wrestling with memories of everyone around him dying? What part of that had sounded like a good time?
Draco, who had been reading in his own bed, dropped his book and was on his feet, wand in hand, in an instant.
Lily started to turn red, too, and not in an embarrassed way.
flying, damn it. If you're going to stop now of all times, it had better not be because of—"
"We're gonna fight the good fight, aren't we?" he asked, already knowing the answer.
Sirius rubbed his injured shoulder and gave James a deeply unhappy look. He couldn't hold James's gaze for long, though, and he huffed out a breath and stared at the floor.
Sirius flinched, and James quickly took his hand away.
But he tilted his chin up and continued sneering. "And you know nothing about me, either, do you?"
Remus was perched on the edge of the tub, while Peter sat on the floor between his and James's feet.
It took a moment. He gripped the desk tighter.
After a moment, he said, "I don't know what happened between Voldemort and Harry, but I agree with Moony that we'll have to wait for him to tell us. Whatever it was, if Voldemort was the one who cast the Killing Curse on him, that means he's Voldemort's enemy, and that makes him our friend. Let's give him a chance, alright?" he added in Sirius's direction.
1978.
If Dumbledore was surprised, he didn't show it. He merely clasped his hands upon his desk and looked at Draco through his half-moon spectacles, as benign as a sleeping kneazle.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry's heart felt a little lighter for the rest of the trek. Sure, maybe James was too caught up in Lily to pay him much attention, and yeah, he might have gotten off on the wrong foot with Sirius, but Harry still had Remus. It was enough.
But Bellatrix had killed Sirius— killed Dobby—
died again.
I open at the close—
Whatever that emotion was, he couldn't afford it. He couldn't let it take him over, not when Dolohov had killed Remus and gotten away. Not when Molly Weasley had had to kill Bellatrix, who had killed Sirius and Tonks and would have killed Ginny, because Harry had been so
Where was Ron? Where was Hermione? Something awful was happening and he needed them, dammit.
"I'll tell you what," said Dolohov in his raspy, amused voice. "My master was kind enough to offer you a deal in the end, wasn't he? And you were stupid enough to take it. I think I'll offer you the same. Surrender yourself, Harry Potter, and we'll let your little blood-traitor friend live. What do you say?"
He and Dumbledore retreated to the headmaster's office.
"Ah," said Harry, with a nod. "Well, in that case…. If it were just Mallory and Black, maybe. They, uh, have a little common ground. But not if Snape's involved. Mallory and Snape… they're thick as thieves."
"No, thanks," said Harry, and he passed the scrap of parchment to Hermione. "That's Dolohov's contacts, then? The ones he has regular meetings with?"
Hermione screaming above them, sobbing, her blood spilling onto the hardwood floors just a few dozen feet away.
Malfoy shuddered. "I hated you," he assured Harry. "But my stomach still sinks every time I remember you falling. Merlin, you were so high, and it was so stormy we couldn't even see what had happened until you were halfway to the ground."
They were stuck. They were stuck in 1978, away from the world they knew and instead in an era with a brand new Lord Voldemort rising.
"He was just congratulating me on the duel," said Malfoy, feigning indifference, but Harry could see the slight flush in his cheeks and the way his chin tilted up. "And asking me if I'd like to try out for the House Quidditch team. He's the new captain."
Maybe that hadn't been Draco's best idea, but really, he
Malfoy's eyes flicked to Harry's body as if against his will. He cleared his throat abruptly and looked away, swallowing hard. His face, already pale, had a greenish tint. He clasped his hands as if to keep from fidgeting.
"Eh, if this is your first try, I'd recommend going for a mammal," said James. "That way you don't have to worry about different internal organs and such. And something proportional to the body part. And, while we're at it, choose a body part without a ton of individual bones and muscles. The less you have to account for, the easier it is. Try… your ear."
"The Boy Who Lived," muttered Remus, probably to himself, but sound carried down in the tunnels. "Yes… an odd thing to call someone unless it's something of a title, a moniker. It must be referring to Mallory's remark that Harry survived the Killing Curse. He must have gotten quite a lot of attention for something like that."
By seventh year, he was probably used to it.
, thank you."
James fought them for a few tense moments, but then he pulled himself together with a visible effort. He took a deep, overdramatic breath, closing his eyes, and slowly his color began to fade back to normal. He shook Sirius and Remus off with a quiet, "Alright, it's alright. I'm fine. I'm fine."
It's because I haven't any legs! No legs, great golly! I mean— great Salazar! What happened to my Merlin-loving legs?"
" Malfoy asked, sounding the most baffled yet.
Draco Malfoy didn't know why he was pacing restlessly. Since the Battle of Hogwarts, he'd spent most of his time reading in the sunroom, snacking on biscuits from Addie, and discussing his upcoming trial with his solicitor.
Until a male voice called, "Parker, come sit here!" And then, "Shove over Padfoot, suck it in, Wormtail. Moony, what in the blazes are you doing reading a book at the welcoming feast for? Put that up before I take points. PARKER!"

It was that
And Black nodded, and the two high-fived over the table.

The Aurors had placed Anti-Apparition wards around the block so that Dolohov wouldn't be able to escape and, with Hermione's help, they'd made them one-way, so that wizards could still Apparate in but not out. They hadn't wanted to cut Dolohov off before he arrived, nor had they wanted to prevent their own backup arriving if they needed it.
James took the paper with a thanks and then— impressive even by Harry's standards— started to read with one hand and occasionally swipe the Snitch out of the air with the other.
Harry slapped the ground, wheezing and crying.
yet. He couldn't access his parents' Gringotts vault. The consequences of even finding and speaking to his parents while he had yet to be conceived….
Harry refused to let him off the hook, though. He waited staunchly for an answer.
"I need… I need a healer," said Gertrude, when Harry knelt next to her again. Her breathing was labored. "Lestrange— Rodolphus— used some kind of curse…."
Malfoy wasn't Dolohov. Malfoy had saved Harry once. He hadn't identified Harry in Malfoy Manor, even though he had recognized him. He hadn't turned Harry over, even though he would have been rewarded. His life would have been assured, at least for a while. Malfoy was a scared child, a coward in the face of war, not a real Death Eater. Not a sadist.
, how could anyone's eyes be so bright and beautiful all the time? It just didn't make
“What’d you get?”
"Yeah."
Pansy huffed, crossing her arms. Beside her, voice dry, Blaise said, “I told you.”
It wasn’t often he had literally no idea what to do or say.
They’ve passed a few of them by matter of unspoken accord, so it seems ghoulish to approach one now with the eager hope the wreck has yielded dead bodies to comb over. But he and Draco both speed up and lengthen their strides anyway, and find a dubious sort of luck: two of the four cars contain drivers, and one of those has a passenger as well. Draco hesitates, the high colour from their jog fading on his cheeks.
“That doesn’t count as a turn,” Draco says, pursing his lips. He reclines a bit into the mountain of pillows behind his back, flicking one brow up. “If you’re so determined to play this game. Whatever it is.”
“I like the holes,” Harry said, glaring at his back. He got up and retrieved the shirt from the pile, then started sorting through the rest. It was the biggest pile and, glancing at the others, he deduced all Malfoy was willing to let him keep were his uniforms, a few pairs of boxers, two pairs of jeans that were tight in the crotch, and his dress robes. “We’re not getting rid of all my shirts!”
standing in front of him. In Paris. In his hotel room. Holding him and offering him food.
Harry brushes it off. He grips the wrought-iron railing to test its strength. When it doesn’t jiggle at a few forceful tugs, he climbs onto it, one hand on the wall to keep his balance.
“If only,” Draco says, peeling his shirt from his chest to fan himself.
“For, or to?” Harry let that sit for a moment, a tiny grey magic curse burning hot between them. Robards sat back abruptly, a flat stare replacing the false concern on his face. Harry nodded, relieved to have it out in the open. “What I keep wondering is how you did it. To me, that is. I’ve almost got the rest figured out.”
“They’ll have been cleaned,” Potter says distractedly, but then he stops rifling through the clothing on another table. His mouth drops open, and he turns to Draco very slowly. “Really, Malfoy?
"Sorry," she says. "Really, Draco. They told me to. But they said it's not a demotion, I swear. It's just—" she fiddles with the dark, complicated plait slung over her shoulder for a moment, "—all of the supervisors on this level are Alphas. And after what happened with Harry and the others… They thought it best to give you an office on a different level. To avoid, um. Problems, since, rumour has it, you two didn't..."
“We were in the room to start,” Harry says as he busies himself pouring the porridge and coffee into the empty tins. “Even with the windows open, I didn’t know how good the ventilation would be. I thought it best to stay under the radar. And since we left, I wanted to wait until we’d sufficiently cleared the area, until we hadn’t seen one for awhile.” He hands Malfoy the tin of coffee first, hiding the urge to smile when Malfoy takes it with obvious eagerness. Malfoy raises it to his mouth and blows on it, then drinks deeply with murmured groan. Harry looks away.
everyone lately?
Draco swallows. “Yeah.” He focusses on Harry’s chin for a moment, dark with stubble so thick it borders on a beard. “Yeah, I understand.”
“I’d like it if you didn’t.” Harry glanced away when Draco’s eyes widened, struggling to explain that, mostly to himself. He settled on saying, “I think it’ll be good,” and, fortunately, turned out to be right.
Harry stirred. “I swear, Malfoy—”
feel it now, an instinctive drop of his shoulder in a bid to minimise the weight of the weapon. And no wonder — it's something he's never had to think about with his wand before which, for almost twenty years, has felt like an extension of his hand. Yet, focused, Harry points it out each time Draco does it, tapping him in the elbow or shoulder or, with two fingers, on the wrist, before Draco goes again.
“No, he’s not.” Harry jostles off his touch, antagonised. “He’s— not my elf right now.”
Sirius had cupped Harry’s cheek, patted it, his fingers icy.
Harry’s chest heaves, once, then goes still. After a moment, it returns to the rise-and-fall of normal breathing patterns. In a small, stifled voice that sounds a little mystified, Harry says, “I was talking about her only last night.”
Potter steps in front of him, swinging his arm with a grunt, and a small cry falls from Draco’s lips as her body jerks, then crumples. Potter exhales loudly, bending to wipe the saturated blade of his weapon on her skirt as the world swoops around Draco. He straightens, fixing his gaze on Draco’s face.
He cuts himself off, unsure what the end of that question might be. Potter rolls to his side to face him and he rests a light hand on Draco’s hip.
. The hand holding mine guided my palm to rest on his head; good thing, too, because I might have torn through my bloody sheets, Potter’s mouth working magic over my prick like that. I threaded my fingers through his hair and gripped it, gritting my teeth as he coaxed my foreskin back with his lips and tongued underneath it. I arched, shoving my free hand into my own hair, my thighs tensing and bollocks throbbing with the need to come, forestalled only by the tightening of Potter’s hand. He bobbed his head, saliva dripping down my shaft, his gaze on my face whenever I pried my eyes open long enough to look down.
either already feral or made so through circumstance, sits in a defensive crouch not three paces away, baring its fangs. Harry’s chest hurts. He’s seen several stray cats here and there, but only one other dog — and that one had been injured, probably in a bid to protect its owner. That was how Harry learned that even Healing magic attracts them, and he’d hated the regretting the attempt to save a life as they’d made their way toward him. But this dog is unlikely to look at him with the same gratitude before running off, anyway. Its fur is scruffy with what looks like mange, and what’s left of its pale, shaggy coat is flecked with blood. Harry thinks quickly and reaches into the pocket of his coat to pull out a handful of jerky.
It’s both a temporary retreat and a kindness. Harry nods to acknowledge it and Draco looks at him a moment longer.
, yes, but
“A long-held habit you shouldn’t expect me to stop,” Malfoy says, “just because you happen to be as fucked up as I am.” He scoffs, but not meanly. “I used to get them over you, you know.”
“Saturdays,” Harry said, jaw flexing. It shouldn’t feel like this, not now. There should be a place they could agree to land, a pin set in between where they’d started and how far they’d come. Only there wasn’t; if anything, it felt like they were in entirely new territory. “Once every Saturday.”
“What happened to Lucius?”
Robards took another, deeper sip of his drink. Cleared his throat. “Well, of course that’s something we could consider.”
“Yes, there is,” Harry says, pulling him into another kiss. “I already do.”
Malfoy.
He lands on a middling truth, instead: “I was going to mention it — before the call. But I was hoping I might be able to offer a solution. It’s half of what I do, piecing old information together to make new things work.”
The nature of Draco’s silence changed, and Harry ran his own last words over in his mind, the husky tone of them, but couldn’t really bring himself to care.
It's unnerving, the silence. The soft echo of his footfalls. He knows he's not the only one living in the area but it feels like it. Yesterday, he saw some scavengers roaming the street, covered head-to-foot in leather and quiet as the grave. Muggles, perhaps — none of them seemed to have a wand, or even a wand-holster. It gave him hope and he almost called out to them, but quickly cut off the words gathering in his throat; his magical signature might have put them in more danger. Nothing to be done about it now.
Hermione, where

“Headmistress.” Minerva’s return smile is tired but amused, though her aging fingers have the skirts of her robes in a death grip, the soft folds over the backs of her hands stretching the delicate skin there tight. She takes a seat across from Hermione’s desk, seeming to think nothing of it that it was once her own.
The realisation wasn’t one that should have zipped an anticipatory throb to his own leaking cock, yet it did. That Potter was a mess came with few upsides (namely, that he kissed and fucked like one, too, as Draco was finally able to attest, with a bleeding lower lip and copious amounts of lube dripping down his crack to his bollocks), and a lot of drawbacks (that armoire, for one, and the fact that his parlour looked like a laundry bomb had been detonated in it, for another), and Draco didn’t
“Yes,” Malfoy says, then coughs and adds, “That is, I do Muggle things with Teddy too, I know what animation is.”
“And to me, you told
Harry tried to recapture it; he stubbornly went after Draco’s mouth again, confused when he twisted away. Realising all at once that Draco was
Pansy gawped, her mouth moving like a fish, squeaking noises coming from her throat. Draco frowned and rose. “You really should visit the infirmary. I think you’re losing your voice.”
“I don’t blame Hermione,” he says, moving on. He actually does a little, but it seems disloyal to say so because he knows he’ll get over it; Harry understands her reasoning too well and loves her too much to hold onto his anger for very long. “It’s probably what I would have done, too.”
She hates that Harry’s out there, risking his life for one.
Harry smiled faintly. “So you went looking?” Malfoy nodded. “And found it?”
“You’re a fool,” Draco said under his breath.
“If you like, I can—”

“I don’t need to remind you how fiercely protective I am of my record, do I?” Malfoy says when he doesn’t respond. “I’m not going to let
“Oh?”
"We'd have no time to prepare for it now. Besides, even if I wanted to, it would look… wrong. Robards would step aside, but… He didn't even have to run in the last election five years ago, and and no one's
Robards’ tone cut straight to Harry’s core. He’d never kept secret his feelings on the subject, campaigning hard against the more lenient members of the Ministry and public for longer sentences, and exile for convicted Death Eaters who ever made it out of Azkaban. For harsher punishments against those who had been complicit in support of Voldemort in thought and word if not deed, but whose involvement existed peripherally. Harry understood that. Agreed in many cases. His determination to speak out for Draco, for the people he thought might have a chance to learn and reform — especially when he’d seen the stirrings of evidence that their attitudes might already be shifting during the war — had been one of the only bones of contention between him and Robards, early in his career. Abruptly, Harry recalled the disgust with which Robards used to speak about people like Hermione, who rallied for house arrest and mandatory rehabilitation studies for people like Draco, which had caused more than one row between them until the trials were over and nothing more could be done. Disturbed, Harry realised he’d completely forgotten about that, the increasing pressures of his chosen field leaving him no time or space to do anything but put himself in Robards’ capable hands, to be shaped into the Auror they both knew he could be.
“Thanks,” Malfoy said, pulling out a fairly new, pale blue dress shirt with a look of disdain. He tossed it in the pile with Harry’s joggers. “But you should keep that in a trunk, too. It would allow for more space, and it could wear out, otherwise.”
, yes,” Draco says. “I like hearing you say it.” His head falls forward and he holds their cocks even tighter with swift, gripping pulls between them, back and forth, and when he mutters, “No reason we can’t do both, though,” Harry comes with a low cry, toes curling into the wooden floor. His cock jumps and pulses in Draco’s hand, shooting spunk over the neat curls around Draco’s groin, and after a few more fast jerks, Draco exhales explosively, his cock throbbing too, wetting Harry’s balls slick with stripe after stripe of his climax.
Potter shook his head, expression still caught somewhere between lust and dismay. “Malfoy...” He swallowed a few times, then glanced down between them, brow knitting as he pushed his hip against Draco’s groin again. “Did you—?”
Harry’s heart leapt. “Still haven’t learned how,” he admitted, trying not to smile too broadly.
Draco opens his mouth. Closes it. He studies Harry as he gathers his thoughts, then says, “I hadn’t planned on wandering off.”
"Very," Malfoy all but purrs, a satisfied glint to his eye. "And my flat is fully equipped with… Well, anything we might need to get through what's holding you back."
Another pause, longer. Draco said, “I don’t mean sexual arousal.”
The sun is lower in the sky, and not yet setting. It can't be half four. But Draco doesn’t argue. Doesn’t
be apologising for,” Potter said. Draco bit back a smile, running that through his head a few times so he could avoid the temptation to let his eyes shift to where the Snitch was — several yards off, and centred right between them. He shrugged and idled closer to Potter to keep his attention and gain a few feet.
said, actually, continuing his thoughtful nod until Harry started to feel self-conscious.
Awkwardly thumbing the head of my cock, I hear his name fall from my lips. I'm so close. So wet. I tighten my fist.
Harry held it in — it wouldn’t be well-received. “Well, since our arrangement worked so well last time,” he said, “I thought we could revisit the terms.”
“More than one,” Harry says. He licks at the shine on his upper lip.
“No, I don’t.” Except Draco can feel he does, a little smirk that’s likely both ugly and smug. He schools his expression and wonders what Potter would say if he said,
Heart clenching so tightly at the blush rising over Potter’s cheeks, Draco’d had to bury his face in his pillow and lift his hips in the air to answer, because he didn’t think he could push the words from his throat.
P.S. I will very likely be too busy to meet with you to resolve any lingering debt between us for several weeks, but I will consider your offer at that time.
Ron was still blinking at Harry’s hand. Under the running water, blood gone as soon as it spilled to the surface, the gashes did look pretty terrible — cut clear through the soft layers of muscle in his palm, ragged-edged — and was beginning to feel a lot worse than it looked.
he could say, to make it all go away.
“Why the—” Draco swallowed hard as Potter continued down his stomach, dragging his tongue over the strip of hair that led to Draco’s cock. “—ah, sleepover?” His head came up from the pillow. “Were you going to tell him about—?”
Draco scowled at him, his fingers dancing up and down that line of hair, stroking, stroking. He dropped a kiss onto Harry’s mouth. Pulled back before Harry could respond, the scowl still on his face. “I was seventeen when I was put into the Ministry’s holds; eighteen and one day when I was put under house arrest. If you’re implying that my repertoire isn’t impressive enough—”
“We have the bath.”
Merlin. Draco takes a gulp of air and lengthens his strides for a few paces until he catches up. They’re usually more careful than that, only touching when it’s necessary: a leg up over a dead-ended wall, a full-body press when they’re hiding, checking each other for injuries. Whatever’s happening between them in the tent works well enough as a coping mechanism, but Harry, as it turns out, was smart to establish boundaries, because it’s a fucking distraction, too. An indulgence. One that belongs nowhere near their journey; one that, by definition, seems to work

Harry cuddles him closer and twirls to pin Malfoy with a threatening look. “What did you do!”
“No.”
The world came back to Harry in fragments: the hazy glow of sunlight, the tenderness of his throat, the dig of Draco’s pointy chin on his shoulder. Draco murmured something indistinct, toying with the hair on the nape of Harry’s neck. Harry’s heart flipped, and then Draco turned his face slightly. His lips grazed Harry’s temple, firmed there, moved. Disoriented, Harry leaned into it for a beat before jerking away.
On the third day, Harry’s heading to the lifts when he spots Malfoy stalking towards him from the opposite direction, open robes billowing behind him as if to flaunt the perfect crease in his black trousers against his long legs, the tight fit of his sheened, emerald waistcoat around his lanky torso. Malfoy glances up, falters mid-step, then resumes. They stand side by side and stare at the floor counter ticking, and over the sound of the tide in his ears, Harry hears Malfoy exhale quietly.
“I love you too,” Harry said. It came out hollow, fairly fitting. Malfoy was still talking to Narcissa, rubbing her hands between his own. The graceful clasp of his fingers and rounded slope of his shoulders drew Harry’s eye. “Malfoy,” Harry said, looking away. “We’ve got to—”
Malfoy snorted. He pushed his book aside and shifted, coming to his knees, then down onto his stomach. Head at the foot of the bed near his trunk, he lifted the watch up — held it to his ear and shook it gently. “I needed something to occupy my mind.”
* * *
Just some undefined presence, waiting to make itself known.
“Go away, this didn’t happen.”
Draco inhaled, arms tightening. "Okay," he said. "Okay."
, and on those days, he hated Draco for ever having loved him in the first place. For ever having shown it. On those days Harry hated himself for still loving him, and for ever having begun to think he might be allowed a happily-ever-after.
Draco blew out a breath. “It’s been less than a week since I worked on you. I can’t do much.”
Malfoy quickly recovered, and asked again: “What do you like?”
she be the one to go, if one of them has to? Draco will be leaving soon anyway, if Potter’s luck holds.
“It's important, and— for Granger,” Draco said. "And I'm not fucking him!"
Harry sat up, pushing away another urge to yawn. “And how many of them can tell me both the magical and Muggle things I’ll need to know?”
There's a long silence. Draco opens his eyes again just to make sure Potter is still there and finds Potter staring behind the sofa, Adam's apple bobbing.
“Good for fucking,” Harry said with a short, snapping rut against Draco’s body, their cocks slipping wet together.
“Whose turn is it?” he asks, stroking up and down Draco’s thigh. Draco’s lips are wet and swollen. He licks them, eyes locking with Harry’s in something of a staring contest before dropping them to look at Harry’s stiff, bobbing cock.
"I— don't," you mutter, twisting your finger into his curls. "Keep me here."
Harry smirked. “That sounds fair,” he said, and lingered by the door instead of leaving. His blood felt hot, his interest piqued. He looked Malfoy over, met his eyes briefly. Looked him over again. “I’m going down to the library for a bit,” he said. Malfoy’s breath caught and resumed, shallowly, fast, his expanding pupils the perfect reminder that Harry had a way to expend his surplus of energy before bed. “Are you coming?”
Harry checks his watch, falling into step. “Theoretically we could wait here, but we might as well make some progress. Yeah?”
I have to be in a— I’m about to conduct a…” He looked at Harry’s mouth, and Harry felt a growl well up in his throat, thighs tensing to push into Draco’s space again, but Draco exhaled hard and held up a hand. “Give me a charm, whatever it was you used on yourself yesterday. And then go home, and I’ll come by later.”
— because he wasn’t mad, after all, but
Potter gusted a hot breath against Draco’s mouth. “Okay.”
? We’re allowed to— We don’t have to, to do it every
Draco tips him a small smile, his face smoothing out. “Now who’s being obvious?”
Harry never knows how or what will happen, simply that Malfoy is the only constant. Malfoy will open Harry with slow, twisting fingers, or undo his own flies and order Harry to his knees to suck him off. It should feel lurid, empty perhaps, but it never does. Malfoy sees Harry in a way none of his other lovers have, nor even Harry’s friends. He understands that all of Harry’s lauded accomplishments have been edged with death, has first-hand knowledge of the darkness Harry harbours... he just doesn’t care.
Harry makes a list when he wakes up, then uses his high-clearance access to snoop through the Ministry Directories and find the location of Malfoy’s office. It’s quiet, where they’ve put him; there’s an abandoned feel to the whole maze of a wing. But Malfoy’s scent is there, pulsing hotter than the hints Harry’s had of it over the last few days, lighting his way like a beacon on a dark shore.
, of course — it was useful when necessary — and Draco knew how to, like most Slytherins did. But it wasn’t a common pastime for him or anything. And he’d just never put the skill to practice not expecting to
“You’re
Harry breathed out a growl. “I think you were right—”
* * *
“Draco?” Pansy hovered a hand over his knee. Pulled it back. He forced himself to look at her; her face was anxious. “Do you hate me?”
Malfoy froze, mouth popping open, breath catching on a sharp inhale. With something like panic, he scanned Harry’s eyes, and then, like plaster cracking, an incredulous smile broke over his face. He exhaled a whooping laugh and dropped his head forward, one hand coming up to clutch his stomach. “Oh my
The longer Draco’s breathless pause went on, the more convinced Harry grew over how brilliant the idea was. Years had passed since he’d stopped bothering to deny the extent of his fascination with Draco; if nothing else, the longevity of that fascination boded well. He’d always liked knowing things about Draco and, since they’d become friends, he liked the things he learned.
“Why, Ms Granger.” Narcissa gives her a slow smile. “Are you saying you would cast me out with the Inferi if I can’t think of a way to help?”
Hermione's breath catches, her thoughtless smile falling away. Anthony pushes off from the stones, frowning.
Tonight it's a spatula. Into his hand, against his chest. There's no need for him to even be
Draco rubs a hand over his face and scrapes back the fringe of hair that flops over his forehead. “Yes, well done, you acted very much the hero.” He rolls his eyes at Harry’s snort and says, “Time moves differently here. A full year’s worth of seasons in roughly a month, remember? We’ve been in here for, what, over an  hour?”
?” Harry snaps, voice rising, but then Teddy shifts again and he and Malfoy both have to freeze.
“Mm.” She pursed her lips. “But is that really what he was making you presentable for?” she asked, and laughed at Harry’s surprised blink. She pressed a kiss to his cheek and went to join Ron at the Floo while Harry was distracted, but after Ron had gone through, paused again, sobering. “Harry. I— I know you like him, but,” her gaze flicked past him, then came to rest on his face, “don’t be stupid.”
Draco swallows, resolutely ignoring the feel of Harry’s heat against his body from shoulder to knee. Ignoring the way Harry does nothing to control the shudder that ripples through him as he applies pressure with his hand to plaster them together, nestling his twitching prick against the crevice of Draco’s arse. Ignoring, as well as he can, how his own body responds to the sensation.
“Then the younger ones need to be made aware of the risks,” Hermione says sharply.
Harry swallowed. “Sure,” he said, folding his arms over his chest to keep his hands from shaking. He tried not to smile. “We need more space for all of the plants you keep killing, anyway.”
not planning on Owling in ‘hungover’ tomorrow morning.”
to the chest — not entirely undeserved, after what he did to Ron's face. Harry’s voice comes out funny. Stifled. "Just for the first time. Just for the heat. He wrote me a note. Apologising. He wants to forget about—"
“Less than two hours now,” Harry says.
Draco’s eyes, still bloodshot around the grey, were fixed on his face, and a twist of tousled hair curled against the outside of his brow bone, the tip wisping over his cheek. His lips were downturned, immobile.
“You agreed to follow them,” Harry says through clenched teeth. “You—”
Harry Floo-d over.
, you know me better than that anyway, why are you always
“Just wait,” Draco says softly. “Eras passed and the earth cooled. Life sprang up around them, creatures swam from the seas to grow legs and stand tall, and nature flourished, their skirmishes carrying them over the earth and leaving dazzling energy in their wake. And after a time, tired from their long feud they rested in the new roots of an yew tree.
“Yeah.”
Harry’s cheeks burned, his own penance for the shiver streaking through him at the fall of Malfoy's hands on his hips. For forgetting himself. He muttered, “It’s not like I’m going to waste the effort on someone I can't even consider a sexual convenience, am I?”
“Other than…?” Harry turned incredulous eyes on her, poised on the cusp of amusement and mortification. But after a beat of bleak silence, Ron snickered; amusement won out. Harry started laughing and Ron dissolved as well, Hermione’s blush making a matched set of the three of them. Preciously, she tried for a disapproving frown but couldn’t stop her lips from twitching, and when she finally allowed her smile to break free, the cold stone of pain chiselled next to Harry’s heart turned soft, malleable, the way he’d forgotten it could when they were all together, when he let them in.
“They have,” Draco smiles against his shoulder, “enchanted buttplugs for that sort of thing, Harry.”
“You just
Harry gritted his teeth and applied pressure to the gauze. “And?”
Hermione poked at the lasagna. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“If you can.” Draco’s fingers moved, slower, travelling apart towards Harry’s sides. Harry’s mind immediately returned to a few minutes ago. Draco’s mouth on his, his hands holding Harry’s jaw.
to be up. None of this made any sense, not the least of which was why on earth Potter would be chasing him down all day when they shared a bloody room. And—
Malfoy tilted his head and blinked at him, confusion pinching a groove between his eyebrows. He pulled his trousers up with an inelegant little hop and tucked his cock away, frowning when Harry dropped into a chair. Deftly tightening and tying the laces without even looking down, he said, “Something amusing?”
Lulled by Malfoy’s muttering and still half asleep, Harry considered just sliding sideways and taking a kip as Malfoy got on with it, but then Malfoy tossed a t-shirt in one of the piles — he’d made four — and said, “Burn it,” under his breath, and Harry’s eyes shot open with a burst of adrenaline.
Draco chanced a smirk over his shoulder, keeping his eyes leveled on Potter’s face. “Talk?”
Harry pointed at the mantelpiece, beautiful with its sprigs of holly and flickering candles — no small feat, in Harry’s opinion. Nothing that brought brightness and merriment to Grimmauld Place was. “That was his contribution, actually. Draco and I did the tree on our own.”
Draco went motionless, the play of resentment on his face like the fading ripples on the disturbed surface of a pond, and Harry stilled too. It wasn't something he'd consciously realised until he'd said it. But he could see it so clearly in retrospect, he didn't know quite how to feel about the fact that he hadn't, before. Draco's frequent discouragements felt like a glove striking Harry's cheek, a challenge to respond to. It was a strange sort of power to have, and yet Draco hadn't exercised it unkindly; he'd only used it regarding things Harry had ended up enjoying, and never for his own gain.
“Take two half-days off per week again?” Malfoy asked, arching a brow.
, Harry ordered a third whisky, a fourth, and then insisted everyone join them at their place afterwards for a drink.
Malfoy dusted the mermaid scales from his fingertips and closed the trunk. “No,” he said, taking the question more seriously than Harry likely deserved, after having been such a dick to him downstairs. “There’s no dark magic here, not in this room, I think anyone would be able to feel that. I can see the appeal.”
“Go on, then,” he said roughly, turning his gaze to the ceiling. “Better make use of the spell before I go soft.”
“Yeah.” Harry pushed his glasses up and scrubbed a hand over his face, stifling a manic laugh with his palm. “No. Nothing’s funny about any of it. Do we have to do it again?” Malfoy made a small sound of surprise and Harry uncovered his face, flicking his glasses into place. Malfoy was staring at him, propped once more against the table. Harry took a deep breath and said it flatly, without regard for his own self-consciousness: “We didn’t finish things the way we normally do. Like last night.”
“Come on,” is all Potter says. His face is grim. “We’ve got to set up before it gets dark.” He fumbles his bag off his shoulder and finds a map within one of its pockets, unfolding it and scanning it with a brief nod. He closes it up and stuffs it in the pocket of his worn joggers instead of putting it where it belongs, then hefts his bag once more. “Can you walk?”
she told it, though Gryffindor was preferable to the other. Her cheeks were beginning to hurt from holding her smile in place.
, it feels so good. Only, Malfoy’s still got that look on his face like he thinks he’s scored a point, so Harry covers Malfoy’s hand with his own and increases the pace of Malfoy’s strokes over his prick with a snarl. “Guess it never occurred to you that might be exactly what I was looking for.”
Malfoy had already tucked into his risotto. Without looking up, he said, “It ought to; you’re paying enough for it.” Harry did a double-take at that, but as he was deciding whether he should let it go, Malfoy swallowed his next bite, patted his lips with his napkin, and added, “Eat. You’ve lost weight since I saw you last, and I can only guess what they’d do to me if the Chosen One were to pass out from malnutrition at my feet.”
Regardless of how disturbing they were, Draco convinced himself that his bewildering on-and-off fantasies of Potter were irrelevant. They might have become friends, of a sort, but only at work. On mixer nights, Draco found himself spending most of his time with Hannah (persistently friendly, though Draco was waiting to find out what made her terrible because it felt bizarre to like someone so much who wasn’t), when she showed up at Longbottom’s side, which meant Draco spent a lot of time around him, too. (He was fine. Bit like a puppy.) Draco was never, not at all, disappointed that Potter, buttoned-down and straight from work, only ever smiled and nodded at him before getting called elsewhere in the pub or ambling over to a waiting Weasley.
Harry nodded a thanks and grabbed his bag, pushing further into the trees. The air cooled quickly and the shadows grew dense the deeper he went, their footpath from the previous week already obscured by leaves and newly-grown moss. But Harry found the bicycle again, easily. He hadn’t been able to stop thinking of it, hadn’t been able to stop remembering how it looked — a broken thing, abandoned to the ravages of nature. Clashing with it, despite that.
Harry spared a moment to be grateful for Hermione’s arm — Ron wouldn’t risk any of his hexes injuring her, even through second-degree contact — then pushed it aside. “I’m sorry. I should have Owled you as soon as I had more information.”
"No," he orders, voice so rough you only recognise it on a visceral level. You'll do anything to obey, the plunge of his cock into you everything you didn't know you craved. "Come from my knot, Draco. Come— from my—"
The breadth of his chest rising under the blood-spattered shirt he wore, his heartbeat frantic against her palm as she failed, for the first time since in their long years together, to reach him the way only she ever could. “At the Dark Lord’s behest.”
“No, I wasn’t.” Draco held up a hand to placate her. “I just thought— Perhaps I could should talk to Potter for you. He said that thing after the show you put on....”
Eras pass. Or so it feels.
Even Harry knew that.
, and came, jerking into Malfoy's touch, his muscles contracting with a powerful, rolling shiver as he slicked up Malfoy's grip. His lips throbbed when Malfoy pulled away, and he heard the tortured sound pitching low in Malfoy's throat. A throb of noise, like the loss against Harry's mouth, Malfoy pulling his hips back so he was barely inside and then coming too. Harry squeezed his eyes shut and held on, wishing he could forget. Both of them silent against that devastating wash of heat — something neither of them had planned for in the first place.
A beat passes. Harry says, "We don't know what happened."
Fuuuuck.
“And Granger has you knocking on my door for it?” Malfoy asked. He lifted one incredulous eyebrow and clicked his tongue. Smirked. “I have to admit, I never thought I’d see such a day. Precisely how desperate
He stared at Draco, unmoving, and Draco stared back.
to you?
discussed a hypothetical situation? And you told me how… plausible it was.”
So Draco wasn’t really snooping — Potter was just terrible at keeping secrets. And what was Draco supposed to do, find a scroll under Potter’s mattress and
Relieved, Draco turned his attention back to the Snitch as Pansy began writing again, fast and furious against the parchment. Which reminded him—
Draco loves his father, and therein lies the problem. To love someone you have every reason to loathe and fear, to think of them and remember a deep, booming laugh as they answered your childish questions, before everything changed— It’s something Draco has never been able to reconcile within himself. When Lucius returned from his sentence in Azkaban after the war, Draco thought it might be easier. But he'd been a shell, wasted and haunted and convinced every shadow was a ghost, more concerned with his paranoia than any lessons he ought to have learned. In the last few years, Draco’s shamed himself by coping through avoidance, the only defence left to him in the face of his internal conflict: Set up the vault to pay a caretaker, and then many caretakers; manage the expectations of your disapproving mother by asking after your father in letters; visit every month at first, then every two, every four. With each visit, Draco did his best to ignore his father's hateful rambling, until his skin felt in danger of crawling off his body. The reprieves were never long enough, but love and guilt brought him back time and again.
to say no, and Bill was expected within the hour; the Malfoys two hours later. But then Draco stalked back into the study and stood by the fireplace, arms folded, his pale fingers tapping out a rolling beat on one bicep. Right where Harry would have no choice but to see him and the challenge in every line of his body, the burning need for confrontation.
” Potter burst out, a vein bulging in his temple, his lax expression of astonishment twisting into one of incredulity. Draco shook him off, but Potter grabbed him again, tighter. “You ditched me the other night, wouldn’t meet up with me, and won’t answer my notes. What the bloody hell is going on?”
“Harder.
Robards hesitated. Moved on. “Well, obviously we couldn’t have this department run by someone who showed such a naive amount of faith. You may be finally ready. We’ll discuss it in a year or two.”
Slowly.
Ron reached out and squeezed his arm. Hermione, expression torn between remorse and hope, sat with her fingers laced, her knuckles white. Bill, at her side, simply watched him. He met Harry’s gaze steadily, calmly. He’d pulled his hair back into a low, sloppy bun at his neck, and Harry remembered the look of of Bill’s mouth fitting over Fleur’s, in disguise as him. Thought of Draco saying,
,” he barks, “
“I’ll do whatever,” Potter said, tugging on Draco’s arm even as Draco, aghast, said, “
Harry didn’t have a real objection to Malfoy’s terms — other than he’d have to deal with the press, and that was part of the bargain regardless — but he let Malfoy stand there, awkward in the aisle next to their booth, as he pretended to consider. “What if it doesn’t work and I don’t get the job?”
“Ah, yes,” Draco said, recovering. He checked the simmer on his sauce and re-covered the pot for something to do with his hands, his arms suddenly gangly and awkward at his sides. “My whole life, I’ve wanted to impress Julia. It truly is a Christmas miracle.”
Draco swallows. “I told you so.”
“Just in general, I mean. All of us.” Potter shakes his head. “I was forcefully repressing my magic by the third day, and that helped. You’re doing it too. Aren’t you?”
“His business is failing?” Harry had the sudden urge to bang his head against a wall. No wonder Malfoy’d been so angry about having to turn away clients.
And then he and Draco were alone. Looking at one another, the pause between them strange, new.
Hermione nodded, seizing on the topic as she refilled her mug. “Yes, of course. We also got some Owls looking for comment about how we thought you’d do in the position — congratulations, by the way. That is, assuming the article was accurate.”
if… If...
"I'll race you there," Draco murmured, then turned like a shot to run up the stairs.
It couldn’t possibly be important, anyway.
“Yes,” Hermione says, relaxing a bit. She comes closer, pulls out the note. “Requesting an audience, just as you predicted.”
“It will have to be completed,” the solicitor hesitated, “ah… soon. If you’d prefer not to have to repeat the ceremony tomorrow.”
, ironically enough. Draco’s almost tempted to smile, but Potter presses back against him and inhales sharply, and that’s when Draco hears them. If he’d had time to think about it, Draco might have assumed Potter was referencing two or three people, but the group sounds larger and consists of at least five overlapping voices, talking and laughing — none of them even attempting discretion. They sound… They sound young. Draco swallows. “They’re going to get themselves killed. Don’t they
“Thanks.”
“No,” Pansy said instantly. Draco peeked at her and her lips curled up in an impish little grin. Her voice took on an airy quality. “The extra money would be nice, of course, and you do look good on my arm, but once I come into my own vaults, I plan on making the newspapers with my scandalous behaviour on a weekly basis by shagging every beautiful woman I can find. It’d be harder to do if I had a husband to worry about.”
“That’s a secret you
Vernon had travelled a lot that year, and had made a game of throwing Harry into the deep end of the hotel pools, irritated whenever he had to bring him along on a trip. Harry could still remember Dudley’s screeches of laughter, could remember the grimace on Petunia’s face when she had to wade in to get him. He remembered Vernon’s gruff voice in the background, the very last time:
“So? I’ve always complained about Potter.”
“You would have come home with me. Or taken me to yours,” Draco continues.
Potter studied him, looking a little disturbed. “Well, we
" Groaning, I stop trying to fight. I ride the crest, let it ebb. Push my face back into the mattress when it's over.
Harry pulls the machete. Pulls his wand for good measure. Hermione gave him a task. If Malfoy
“Let’s get through today first,” Potter says. He touches his wand in its holster, then slings his bag onto his back. “Stay close to me when we clear the trees,” he says grimly. “And run, this time, if I tell you to.”
“No.” They’ve no time to engage in pointless ventures. Narcissa has her well and truly cornered now, and knows it. Any leeway that originally existed in the Vow is gone now that Hermione is aware of it — her hate for Narcissa makes all of her motives suspect. She doesn’t need to order Narcissa’s torture or execution; all she needs do is want it, and one wrong word, even spoken inadvertently, to someone who might piece things together and act on her behalf, could cost Rose her life. “I’m sorry.”
Malfoy inclined his head. “Hello.”
“We had a dozen here,” Malfoy says, almost to himself.
It became one of his, too.
Harry’s long got over the pain of watching Ginny marry someone else, has got over his romantic attachment to her. But the memories of both linger, an ache he no longer resents.
“Fine, don’t tell me.” Draco sat back against the headboard. “So, what then. This is— what?”
“You’re a good dancer,” Harry said.
Harry’s gaze moved back to Theo and Draco; Theo was murmuring something in his ear, eliciting a chuckle from Draco, a shake of his head.
He reached for his drink, finishing it off in two swallows. It was smooth, and the scald of it down to his stomach distracted him enough from the direction of his own thoughts until Malfoy chuckled.
Harry couldn’t seem to catch his breath, wanted to send another hex flying about the room, but— that didn’t make any sense. “What does that mean?”
Then he glances back, thunderstruck.
“Yes.”
“Mm hmm,” Draco said, low and reassuring. He walked his fingers down the length of Harry’s back.
“Would you like me to call you ‘your Highness’ while I’m at it?”
Located on the less commonly trafficked Crepuscule Alley sits a small, unassuming and understated shop that appeals to a niche market more suited to Knockturn. In it, our sources say the items available for purchase are not fit for print. While the Prophet was unable to gain access to the shop—patrons need to make an appointment for first-time entry, and we were refused—prior patrons, speaking anonymously, claim that the merchandise is adult in nature. Though this fact was undisputed by Ms Greengrass, Harry Potter, she says, was merely visiting for a fitting with the exclusive tailor who shares space with the shop. Considering Potter’s attire upon leaving, we at the Prophet are inclined to believe her. (Pictures below.)
“Thank whatever magic your mum put in this place,” Harry says. “It’s just what I found in the pantry.”
He looked back down, as speechless as he’d ever been.
Draco shuddered and gripped the outsides of Harry’s arms. He fit his thigh between Harry’s legs, lifted it, groaned when it rubbed over Harry’s erection. Rubbed his own against Harry’s pelvis. He was as stiff as he got right before he came, and Harry rocked his hips with tiny thrusts, trying to provoke it, breathless at the mere idea of stickying him up that way. Draco’s fingers sifted through his hair, jerked his head up.
Harry should have considered that maybe Teddy didn’t like the bath at his place — or he could have just
"Practice your downward dog, Malfoy," Harry says gruffly, heading for the door before he gives in and grabs him. "And I'll see you tonight."
“No, it’s fine.” Draco nodded and Potter moved, their knees hitting one another’s until Potter slid a leg between his two and resettled into a different position.
Obediently, Harry shuts his mouth. Draco draws out an exhale, then gently pushes the tip of Harry’s wand against the wound at his hip. Harry grinds his teeth against the pain of muscle regeneration, his flesh stitching itself back together. He barely has time to acclimatise himself to it when molten pain sears through his hand. He starts to pull away, tries to, but Draco is fast at grabbing his wrist, so Harry pinches his eyes shut and bites down on his tongue to keep from yelling out. His bones pulse with protest, crack and realign, his skin closing around them — yet the heat keeps on, long after a normal Healing spell might have faded.
“Ten days,” Draco said, sitting on the floor beside Harry, rather than standing and walking away: a blatant disregard of their patterns in a way kissing, and lingering to kiss, had not been.  “Not too long.”
” Draco’s voice, like the lash of a whip, then faltering. “Don’t— ever— Not for—”

, but especially when Harry is bleeding. Get my bloody kit and go home. Thank you.”
“Or that.” Lifting one shoulder, Narcissa says, “Though I do think he meant Purebloods, and perhaps even half-bloods, to survive. Perhaps. Lucius—” She makes her voice steady. “—would have been allotted the power to enact on his behalf, but Blood Magics are not as adaptable as others; they require absolute precision.”

“There’s nothing to confess!”
the wards. If they could kill the Inferi, it would be done by now. Hermione would have thought of that.”
It was an urge I had long ago learned to ignore, and quite successfully, too. The one that whispered in my ear when Potter had handed back my wand after my hearing, the one that tingled somewhere beneath my breastbone when he leaned over my back to examine the papers we were discussing. It got relegated to some hidden corner of my mind without thought these days; a footnote, a nuisance I could usually overlook.
“What?” Pansy asked.
Draco’s eyes shuttered. Rigidly, he drew back against the headboard. “If I’d been saying that, I would have said that,” he bit out.
“So you’re still willing to speak,” Granger says. “That is, to someone other than your illustrious son.”
” Harry raised his eyebrows. “Just how differently did Snape treat the students down in the dungeons?” he asked, and Draco’s gaze snapped to his, his cheeks flooding pink.
“Draco—”
“Are you going to… beware of me, now?” Harry asks, instead of answering. “Because if I tell you to do something, I need to know—”
always be a thorn in my damned side. We may have had to work together, but there was no reason he should expect more than that just because we were in each other’s pockets twice a week. It was untenable, and sooner or later someone would pay.
A crash sounded upstairs, followed by the slam of the door and footsteps pounding down the stairs. “I thought I told you I’d be
“I just hope he knows—” Harry stops. “I can’t remember really telling him that he matters to me, let alone how much.”
That one is categorically untrue. Harry hasn’t cared about the rumours in years — he’s done his best over the years to curate the more intimidating aspects of his professional reputation, in fact — but he still knows how to love. He loves and
Once he's steadied himself, Harry digs into his coat for the torch. It's a small one, better designed for making sure someone doesn’t trip over tree roots if they need to have a slash while camping, than for any sort of real recon, but he takes a few seconds to fit the loose batteries in and shines it through the glass door anyhow. The light he could see from the ground seems paler up close, a blue bulb held aloft in the middle of a spartan hotel room.
Harry took in the sharp angles of Draco’s profile. “That’s not why.” He nodded and forced a smile to acknowledge Ron, who was now waving at him like a lunatic with both arms over his head, like he thought Harry hadn’t heard his bellow. Harry swallowed, tired of pretending. “It’s not because it’s Saturday. I’ll want you tomorrow, too,” he said, rending himself stupidly bare, and heard Draco’s breath catch as they went in together to fill the last two seats at the table, one at each end.
He remembered escaping from Malfoy Manor, that horrible night. Bellatrix had already summoned Voldemort, convinced of Harry's identity and defeat. When they had escaped, and she had killed Dobby…
Potter dug in his pockets with the hand not supporting McKinnon and produced a wand Draco found vaguely familiar. He held it out to Dumbledore silently.
"Thanks," said Remus to Harry, turning to ignore the scuffle happening right in front of him. He leaned back to avoid one of James's flailing legs. "You're very good at that shield charm."
" snapped Sirius, loud enough to startle a Victorian witch out of her portrait.
The elf knocked twice on an innocuous door and then vanished with a
But Mallory had been cool and collected under that intense barrage. He had gotten off a few offensive spells of his own, sure, but he'd mainly fought defensively, hiding behind his Shield Charm or reflecting spells back at Sirius.
He raised his wand.
Spending the past few days in the library with Malfoy had been uncomfortable at best. It was so strange to be there without Hermione playing taskmaster, without Ron sitting beside him cracking jokes under his breath.

"Thank you," he said. Without further ado, he started waving his wand and muttering enchantments over McKinnon.
That was useful information to have if they were going to duel.
James almost shuddered, wondering exactly how secretive MACUSA had to be in order to hush that up. He was starting to wish he had paid more attention to his father's political bickering at those fancy dinner parties he had always whined about being forced to attend.
brought him the Prophet. He didn't know how he would react, especially sitting in the Great Hall of Hogwarts where he had spent six years watching for Hedwig with the morning owls, if some other owl started bringing him the paper instead.
Harry stared at him, speechless.
"Right," said Harry, ducking his head to hide his expression. Remus was more understanding of his… camaraderie… with Malfoy, but he didn't want to advertise he meant to see the Slytherin tryouts rather than Gryffindor's. "I'll— uh— just grab my cloak and be off, then."
"Boys," she said, and they froze as one. "Mr. Black, why don't you put your skills to use helping Mr. Lupin? And Mr. Potter, I believe Mr. Parker would appreciate your assistance."
"Alright, let me see where you're at," said Bowie. "I can't think of a better student to start us off than our very own Head Boy. Come up here, Mr. Potter."
— an informant! This is a fucking Death Eater meeting! Run!"
He couldn't believe— what had he been thinking, trying to help Malfoy? Betraying Sirius—
"Oh. Protego Horribilis. I heard Professor Flitwick cast it during… you know, the battle… and Voldemort was trying to break through it with that lightning, but it was taking a long time…" Harry shrugged. "I thought it couldn't hurt. It was the best I had."
"Alright, which direction, do you think?" Harry asked, unperturbed. His energy was better spent wondering how long his legs would hold him when he felt so horribly weak.
"Charmed," said Draco, watching his godfather for a reaction.
Why couldn't it have been anyone else? Literally anyone.
. None of the 'Marauders' can be trusted alone with her except perhaps Pettigrew, but his incompetence makes him useless to me. And then in a few years, when I am in the Dark Lord's inner circle and have ensured her protection myself, I will put in a good word for you, as well. The Dark Lord values competence no matter your blood status. That is why he is interested in
She seemed determined to offer more, to offer everything he could possibly need, but Harry cut her off gently.
I saw you jump between me and that lightning!
"Oh," said Harry, remembering. "Well, you shouldn't have said that about my mother, should you? Or Ron's."
"Yes, sir," said Harry. Now that the dementor's effects were wearing off, he found himself irrationally angry at Malfoy for stepping in. "I know that."
"Don't be absurd," said Snape, noticing what he was doing. He drew his wand and make a complicated little weaving motion, and warm air blasted Harry. In a matter of heartbeats, he was dry and warm again. Snape tucked his wand away and motioned off stage, toward a more deserted corner of the hall. "Please, come this way."
"I was under the Cloak, going to the kitchens for a snack. He was walking by, bragging to his snaky little friends…. He was so proud of himself. Bet Mum's proud, too. Finally got the
A few of the Slytherins chuckled.
The three boys… Harry's eyes darted to their faces, and he felt the already wobbly ground rip itself from under his feet entirely.
The Great Hall fell into darkness without the candles. The moon and stars lined everything in the most fragile silver. The Gryffindor table alone stood out as the fading lilies glowed softly, blanketing them.

The conversation with Regulus had thrown him— and Sirius— for a loop, though.
James marched up to Lily and Harry, his bearing straight and proud. He jabbed a finger at Harry and said, "I have decided to spare your life on three conditions! First, you give up your despicable, underhanded, woman-stealing ways—"
now? After what happened to Crabbe…."
"An incredible power," murmured Dumbledore again, not looking at Draco. "But how could it be possible? There must be a piece we are missing…."
He had been getting comfortable in Hogwarts, too, he realized.

If I had just kept my head down and followed the professors like a good little boy, Vince and Greg never would have thought of doing that. We would have been clear before the fighting started. It was

Harry wouldn't be a problem. He'd have to be more alive to run to a teacher over what they were about to do.
James started, providing the distraction so the others could levitate, toss, or downright run their bundles of fireworks to the proper locations. It had taken forever to figure out the spell used to enchant the floating candles and
"This is a mistake," said Harry, turning toward the doors for the hundredth time that evening. "I already told Hermione I didn't want to return for my N.E.W.T.s. Time would be better spent—"
"Perhaps, but I'm
, Malfoy," snarled Harry. "Just get that through your head right now."
"Here, you've still got some hair in your ear—" said James, raising his own wand toward Harry's face.
They sat in silence for a few moments. Remus decided to pull out his potions essay to get started on, even though it had just been assigned that morning.
He laughed.
"It makes you sneeze out sardines," said Lily matter-of-factly.
. Surely Madam Pomfrey will have something to set you right. What did she give you last time when you were going on about Dumbledore being naked in King's Cross Station?"
He lowered his wand.
Just like it was his fault they were all dead— his parents, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Mad-Eye Moody, Fred…
"I know," she said. "Ron won't go back either. But I know I won't be alone. There will be Ginny, and Luna…."
Harry crossed his arms and waited.
. Now, I think I saw some handcuffs in here before we blew the place to bits…."
"I don't know, sir," said Draco. "Madam Pomfrey survived to my knowledge. She wouldn't meet him in the afterlife."
stopped you from playing before. You
Harry followed with a sense of resignation. It was going to be hard to hate Snape properly as a teenager, knowing what he would grow up to do. And— no, maybe Snape wasn't perfect; he hadn't exactly started off great, only wanting to save Lily from Voldemort's interpretation of the prophecy and forget Harry and James, but… but he had come around. Even knowing Voldemort would kill him if he ever found out, he'd done what he could to save the people he could.
Of course, he was the one Harry Bloody Potter would choose to obsess over next. He could never take a break from being the big bloody hero, could he?
. The seconds, if they are allowed contact, will meet to discuss whether there is common ground for the duelists to start a dialogue and work out the issue nonviolently. If, however, there is no contact, or the seconds determine there is no chance for a peaceful resolution, we move onto the duel itself.
James, Sirius, and Peter thought about that in silence.
"Sorry," he muttered, unable to look Malfoy in the eye. The full understanding of what he'd done hit him, and he wished he could sink into the floor. He had attacked his father in a classroom of children and then clung to Draco Malfoy for protection like a maiden in a bodice-ripper novel. His face felt unbearably hot. "I don't— uh— I don't need the hospital wing. I'm fine now. Uh, sorry."
He wasn't done yet, but the end was in sight. He could do it.
It was late. Past dinner. But it was also a lovely summer night, and surely the shops in Diagon Alley were still open? He could go for a walk, and if he happened to meander into Knockturn Alley, well…
The cold grew worse.
Snape's pale, thin face clouded. He said hissed, "If you want to pick a fight with your idiot housemates, don't use me as an excuse. I don't need your help, and I certainly don't need your
It didn't have all the nicks and bumps it would gain by the time he went hunting for Horcruxes, but it was still his holly and phoenix feather wand. It was still his.
"I only meant," said Kingsley, "it wasn't your fault. Not Remus, nor Tonks, nor any of the others. We all knew the risks, and we chose to stay and fight that day."
