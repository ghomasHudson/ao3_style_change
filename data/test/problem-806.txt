But before Draco could casually mention the normal price or how Garrick always charged every customer for everything Potter had whispered a faint good bye and hurried out of the store as if the Dark Lord himself had been chasing him and Draco had seen The Dark Lord chase Potter, he was sure he had been slower then.
The witch behind the desk looked at him, long and hard, staring at the scar on his forehead, then, as if to sort her thoughts she shook her head a little: “Of course”, she said: “That’s the Department for the improper use of magic, second floor”.
“Only temporarily”, Harry said quickly, but Martha had already chimed in: “Oh we don’t judge, darling, Mortimer and his husband have been together for twentyseven years now”.
“We don’t want to be late, do we?”, Harry asked and put on his shoes: “We have to apparate a good mile away, there are still strong protections around the Burrow”.
“Oh it should be quite apparent that, indeed, you do have wands”, Potter grinned and signed for the boxes.
He woke up late the next morning and cursed silently while brushing his teeth. He had no time for the morning newspaper, barely time for a strong cup of tea before jumping out of the door and walking towards the shop. Draco was very relieved finding Garrick in his usual grumpy mood when he walked into the store. No big day today, he thought, how very pleasant, he could just lean back and enjoy the ride.
Draco studied him then, Harry looked so flustered, he looked almost as if he too had thought about leaning in, had thought about connecting their lips in one sweet little kiss that could last a lifetime, but that couldn’t be, he was in a relationship, with a woman non the less and Draco was sure Harry would never think of him in such a way, no something else must have been the matter, something rational and natural, Draco just couldn’t put his finger on it yet. But what if not, a small voice inside Dracos head asked, what if he also wanted to kiss you? Draco felt the heat rise in his cheeks and busied himself with rearranging his handkerchief. But where was this coming from all of a sudden, this urge to kiss the chosen one? Draco must have a fever or a brain tumor or something to explain it, he didn’t even like Harry until a couple of hours ago, so why this urge to kiss him?
Inside the house it was loud and vibrant, there were kids running around, no space to stand because every centimetre was already occupied, it smelled like sugar and heavy whipping cream.
Harry held him at arms-length, tears streaming down his face too: “She is wonderful, do you want to see a picture?”.
“I’m sure he’s going to show you, if you ask him”, Harry said: “Or if you don’t ask him”, he chuckled.
Draco was taken aback a little, though he didn’t know why exactly until he realised that no one had ever asked him that question before.
“She did, yes”, Lucious said: “But she has not been here for these last three weeks and I am worried about her”.
The day, it turned out wasn’t about to get any bigger, not that Draco was complaining, he had had his proper share of excitement for a day and was not prepared to cater to any more surprises just casually strolling into the shop like Potter had.
Garrick looked up from his hands, a wonky smile wrinkling the skin of his face into an almost unrecognisable sheet of damp parchment: “Stellar, boy”, he said and hopped on his feet.
“The commute is a bit tedious, but other than that I enjoy the work, it’s very quiet mostly”, she said, then she looked at Harry: “By my word, you’re Harry Potter”, she breathed.
Martin held out his hand and Draco shook it: “It’s a pleasure”, Draco said with a smile and Martin nodded.
Draco looked over the railing and into the sea and wished he was back at the Weasleys, back in the field of sunflowers. How could this evening have taken a turn this badly? Not only an hour ago he had kissed Harry, really kissed him, on the mouth! And now he was on his way to Azkaban.
Harry laughed loudly: “No, don’t worry, the bottle cost me three pounds”, Harry chuckled along and took another sip, his lips were already stained red a little.
“Ginny”, Harry yelled again and with one last look at Malfoy he followed her hastily into the house.
Harry looked around and his gaze caught on wide grey eyes from the other side of the platform. Malfoy was dripping wet, a large, grey towel wrapped around his body, blond curls plastered against his forehead and his cheeks were bright pink.
It was freezing on top of the Astronomy Tower. Harry was glad he had taken his big coat under the invisibility cloak.
For a moment Draco considered trying to wake Garrick again but he decided against it, there was nothing that could stir the old man and as long as Draco was in early the next day to warn his boss there was no use in waking him now. Old people needed their sleep, Draco was sure it wouldn’t be healthy, for either Garrick nor Draco himself to attempt another waking, after all what if it worked and Draco had to face the old man. Garrick was quite uncomfortable (evil) if one woke him up and Draco was not prepared to face any more curses shot his way today, no thank you very much.
They apparated from the same spot where they had landed the night previous, behind the sandwich shop and came to a stand in front of the hideous police building with the yellow paint.
Draco liked the workshop, it had taken over two years before he had been allowed inside without supervision and some months more until the old master had deemed him worthy to try his expertise on creating his own wand.
“With your wand I mean”, Draco clarified and blushed a little. Draco didn’t like himself blushing at all, he found it beneath him to so openly show uncertainty in his own words or actions. Also it didn’t suit him, he thought, to look so pink, it was way too alive looking for a proper Malfoy complexion.
He got up silently, Mary Antoinette staying behind under his covers, and went into the bathroom to brush his teeth, he could only hope that Harry and Ginny were deep sleepers. He looked at the clock, half past seven in the morning, very well.
Potter ran his hands through his hair and looked around: “I reckon I need a care kit”, he said then: “For my wand”.
And it didn’t sound like he was just saying it because he wanted to be polite, no, bloody Potter, ever the generous and humble servant of the people actually meant it. Draco rolled his eyes a little, but only a little.
Harry looked to his side, Malfoy was sitting there, slowly chewing on the Baguette he had brought, the lights were dancing over his pale face, glistening in his grey eyes his long lashes caressing his cheeks.
“We caught him”, Harry said passionately: “His name is Martin Gordoff, he’s a low level criminal, he’s a fan of Ginnys that’s how they met”.
“If you behave accordingly, I might consider it”, Harry said and put his wand in his pocket: “But I don’t have high hopes”.
“What do we do if this yields no results?”, Draco asked and together they made their way through the crowd.
“You might do good advertising some non stolen items from time to time, those not associated with the dark arts”, Draco said with a smirk.
“Maybe he figured he could use someone who knows their way around wands”, Potter said and pocketed the wand.
Harry made sure to read the cards first every time, saying thank you even before opening the present. He got a magical cookbook, a mirror that told him what his best outfit would be, a strand of veela hair (Draco really wanted to get his hands on that), a mug that stirred itself, an amulet that protected him from minor spells (Draco highly suspected that that was Ginnys gift), before he got to the small parcel wrapped in newspaper.
The library was stocked horribly, but Draco made do, selecting about half a dozen mediocre textbooks on wandlore to keep him occupied.
“I’m not your dog, you know”, he said, trying to keep up the pace of the other man: “You could wait for me”.
He had not arrived with much so all he had to do was change into the suit he had come here in and take back his wand, it felt comfortable and secure in his hands. He tried a small anti-crinkle charm on his suit and it worked just fine, he let out a relieved sigh.
Ginny Weasley looked exactly like she had the last time Draco had seen her, with her flaming hair and porcelain skin, the freckles and the plump and shiny pink lips. She came into the Hall in a silk pyjama and frowned at Potter, then she looked at Draco and stopped dead in her tracks.
“Are you SURE?”, Narcissa asked this time, looking at her son like he was out of his mind: “Harry Potter?”
“So I’ve heard as well”, Draco said and felt the warm breeze in his face, he turned his wand around to face Harry.
And impressive he was unfortunately. Draco was relieved to see he still remained the taller of them both, he would not have survived the indignity of having to look up to Potters face as if seeing the messiah in the flesh. He was sure a lot of people did that on a daily basis anyhow, he needn’t be one of those.
Malfoy had always wondered what it might have felt like to be looked at like that, he had imagined it quite satisfying, so full of promise and adventure. And even though he hadn’t liked Potter that much (no he hadn’t) he had been discouraged when the glint in his eyes slowly started to fade in those last years at Hogwarts, no longer had he wished to be the one receiving the stare, that would have been too much to ask, no he would have been quite satisfied just seeing it on him again. Maybe when talking to that know it all Granger or the Weasel, or his little girlfriend. What might have happened to her? Draco wondered and took a sip of tea, were they still together? Surely not, it had been a school romance, two teens falling in love for the first time, all messy and sloppy and oh so obvious, even though Potter had always tried to hide his affection.
It wasn’t an easy feat to persuade Mary Antoinette into her traveling cage but after a lot of cooing and a healthy dose of fish fingers she was stored away safely and contently.
“I’m glad we’re getting along now”, Harry said and tried to turn away from Malfoys face, but couldn’t.
Draco stared at the parchment as the realization dawned on him. Ginny was behind this. She was the one who had sent out the man to repair the Elder Wand. He got slightly dizzy. How could that be? Surely she didn’t want the wand for herself, surely she wanted to give it to Harry some way or another, maybe she was scared for him being out there as an Auror and she wanted the best wand possible for him. But the man had attacked Draco, had kidnapped Ollivander, surely she hadn’t approved of it, maybe the man had just made a spur of the moment decision and now she had to deal with it.
“Especially then”, Harry insisted: “You may be angry with them, punish them accordingly but you may never give them the feeling that you don’t love them”.
“How was it where you grew up”, he asked Harry then: “I’ve heard so many different tales, all I know is that you grew up with muggles”.
“We’re done here”, a voice interrupted his thoughts and Draco jumped a little. Harry blinked a couple of times and finally turned around towards the origin of the interruption.
Draco cleared his throat as they went over to the door of 13f and walked into the room. It looked just like it did yesterday, junk everywhere, a truckload of papers and documents strewn about the room, there was a big map on one of the walls showing Diagon Alley and the attached roads leading away from the magical City Centre. Otherwise the room was empty, no sign of the sleeping partner Draco had yet to say a word to.
The sky, for once, was clear and blue on their way over the sea and towards the coast that was visible on the horizon.
“Hello fellas”, a young woman said. She was wearing a thick yellow raincoat and held a lantern in front of her, trying to illuminate the fog.
His father. Of course, Draco should have seen it coming, whenever dark wizards lurked around the surface his father was not far.
Draco just stared at him. Potter had lost his mind, there was no way around it, sometime between the great battle and now the Boy who lived had lost his marbles and Draco was the first to notice. How sad, he thought, just a couple of days ago Draco had been almost proud of Potters functionality in society, but he had been wrong.
13 f, there it was. The door looked just like all the other doors, no sound was coming through it and Draco was unsure for a moment whether the witch downstairs had forgotten to tell him everyone had already gone home. But he had to try at least and if no one was there he was going to shout and complain as long as it took to get someone.
“I’m just scared, you know”, he said quietly: “Scared that people will think we have not changed, that I have not changed”.
Harry coughed a couple of times and dragged his hand through his hair, Draco busied himself with retying his shoelaces.
Harry sighed: “She’s looking at seven years probation for accessory to attempted murder and abduction with false imprisonment”.
What to do now, he wondered as he wiped away blood and glass shards from his forehead. See if Olivander was okay, he thought. He staggered to his feet and went towards the back of the store, first though locking the door in case of any further unwanted guests.
Harry felt Malfoys firm hand at his jaw, cupping his face and he got the courage to put his hand through Malfoys blond curls, he could feel Malfoys lips smiling against his own and he couldn’t help but chuckle.
Draco did not know what to say to that, Harry was right, of course, he was very lucky that both of his parents had survived the terrible war and the stay of the Dark Lord at their Manor, he should not let the fear of societal repercussions hinder his having a relationship with his family.
And then they were gone and it was quiet, the judges were deliberating their scores and Harry was miserable.
‘The reason I am bringing this up with you is that it has since been discovered that the Malfoy family is at the top of the list of the so-called ‘reparations avoiders’, as what they declared to own was little more than their manor, which, by the way, had all valuable assets such as works of art removed before the end of the war. They have been under scrutiny for exploiting a variety of legal instruments, predominantly trusts, owing to which they officially hold no legal title to their assets, to secure continued enjoyment of their wealth. Now, Mr Potter, it so happens that you spoke in the defence of Mrs and Mr Malfoy Jr at their trials after the conviction of the head of the family, Lucius Malfoy.’
‘Thank you, sirs…’ She looked at the two sadly, looking away. Harry noticed the corpse. A thin layer of foil was floating just above it, but it had been left untouched for their arrival.
‘I see. From what I understand, you’ve been working with Rutledges for a long time. Is there anyone who would want to harm Mr Rutledge?’
A man’s voice came through the radio. ‘Welcome back. This is the annual broadcast in memory of the Battle of Hogwarts, and my name is Percival Atkins. Thank you for staying with us after the short break.' He paused. 'Ladies and gentlemen, we have entered the penultimate segment of our broadcast, with Mr Harry Potter joining us for a talk about his recollection of the war. Yet again, I would like to give a warm welcome to Mr Potter.’
‘In that case, would you like to use this opportunity to request both families and people involved in the blatant theft of money righteously owed to the families of the war victims to reconsider their actions?’ Atkins drilled the man mercilessly.
'And are we to believe that you don't have a dozen of lawyers trying to lift that workload off of them this very second?' Ron said amused.
‘Mrs Rutledge.’ Harry started, clearing his throat. ‘Do you know of anyone who would wish death upon your late husband?’
‘I see.’ Atkins said resignedly, changing his strategy immediately. ‘How about the trustees who have been under increasing pressure from the media and the society alike to discontinue their financial arrangements with the family?’
For the first few years of their Auror career, Harry and Ron were mainly hunting down remaining Death Eaters. After the substantial majority was caught, their work became varied, but some of the fugitives remained on the loose. Flint was among them, and his case was special, because he was rather arrogant in his ‘hiding.’ Whereas experience has taught Harry that the unaccounted for Death Eaters usually moved abroad and laid low, Marcus Flint had been resurfacing periodically as if to spite them, and usually in London at that. But after a year of no luck, Ron and Harry were moved on to more pressing cases.
‘Two months ago, then.’ Harry noted. He tried to disregard the bitter tone of the man’s voice. ‘Can you go through what was said during your last meeting for us?’
Mrs Ruttledge pointed towards the centre of the room. Harry noticed shattered glass on the floor by a coffee table, remains of which indicated it was a whisky tumbler. Some of the firewhisky had sunk into the carpet. A barely open bottle of said alcohol stood on the coffee table, its label bearing Ruttledge family insignia. The victim was lying by the glass, and Ron had uncovered the body slightly by now. Mrs Ruttledge gasped, covered her mouth, and Harry could see tears streaming down her face as she was turning her gaze away.
‘Did Mrs Rutledge not want to take over the distilleries?’ Harry asked, suspiciously sounding like Hermione.
‘What would he have gained from it?’ Harry asked. 'It's not like the money comes back to him. He's under fire and basically locked up here for god knows how long.
‘Yes, Potter, that’s what I said.’ Malfoy leaned back in his armchair. ‘That said, we do have plans, so unless you have already managed to name him a suspect in this case too, please indulge me and interview him another time.’
'I only believe what I see Malfoy, and trust me when I say that in no time we will be turning this place upside down for whatever cursed memorabilia you have kept after your precious dad.' Ron hissed.
‘Plenty.’ She looked at them bitterly. ‘My husband had been bombarded with death threats for months prior to his death. But I do not know any names apart form one. Marcus Flint threatened my husband about a month ago.’
The man put his cigarette out on an expensive looking ashtray. 'I couldn't care less about what you believe in, Weasley.'
It has become a frequent occurrence for Hermione to visit their shared office ever since she also got employed by the Ministry, although most of the time it was just the two of them bickering and Harry listening. He found it to be a nostalgia-induced instinct of the two, and so he rarely protested, even though he rarely had anything to add.
‘Flint!’ He raised a fresh issue of the daily prophet from his desk. ‘What is it? Third sighting in the last two weeks? I’ve seen so many photographs of him lately that you could convince me he tips the journalists off whenever he leaves whatever shit hole he’s been living in’
‘Alright.' Atkins sounded dissatisfied with Harry’s answer. ‘I am afraid that we have run out of time for this segment. Thank you for the discussion, Mr Potter. Dear listeners, please be patient with us as we pause the broadcast for a moment before we continue with a live performance by Celestina Warbeck in celebration of the victory at the Battle of Hogwarts.’
‘Mrs Rutledge…’ Ron tried to pick words carefully. ‘Your husband publicly announced that he would cut ties with the Malfoys. Would you agree there was a motive for them to retaliate?’
There was a pause again as the men were likely staring at each other tensely, waiting for the other one to give in.
‘She spent 30 years with the man and gave him a child.’ The old witch pointed out. ‘They might not have said the vows in love, but they have grown fond of each other over time.’
‘That would be my visit to Diagon Alley. I did some shopping for our son’s school supplies.’ She explained. ‘Harold was against me leaving the house, so he insisted that I bring Bethany along.’
‘No, I do not think so.’ The lady continued, but she still seemed a little offended. ‘She has always fulfilled her duties owed to the family gracefully. Not once have I heard her raise voice at her husband.’
'He's a certified potion maker, he passed his final ministry exam not long ago.' Harry answered the undoubtedly rhetorical question.
‘The ‘wearable’ part being argumentative.’ Ron snickered at a small coffee stain on his semi-ironed shirt.
‘Well, you should do this more often.’ Ron said in an overly sarcastic tone whilst putting a copy of the Daily Prophet on Harry’s desk.
‘I will ask Billie to contact the French Ministry and ask for anything they may have on that Clément guy.’ Ron said when they finally returned to their office. ‘I don’t like the ghost-like feel of him.’
‘Draco would never.’ She looked at him straight in the eyes. ‘He is such a sensitive boy, too. The first person to console me when the media started targeting our family. He is a part of it, especially over the past two years with Narcissa away in France. In fact, he has been suffering through the same lynch my husband did for much longer.’
'He had always been civil towards me, but we all have our limits.' He raised his copy of the Daily Prophet. 'What got to his head is the same thing that has poisoned the people who have been camping by my mother's geraniums.'
‘Not much, but Harold told me on that one occasion he called him a blood traitor and promised he would pay for turning away from the cause.’ She shook her head. ‘He said that Flint had escaped before he could do anything, because an employee knocked on the door to his office.’
‘Mr Potter, you have a reputation for rarely making appearances in public, which makes us all the more grateful for you agreeing to join us today.’ The journalist was courteous, although a hint of complaint broke through the politeness.
Ron furrowed his eyebrows. 'Why do you think he prevented you from seeing her? You have been a family friend for years, he had been under fire for arrangements with your father for some time now, what changed?'
‘I don’t see how you hadn’t prepped him before going on air. I mean, it was pretty obvious it would come up, I can’t go an hour without hearing about this mess.’ Ron teased her.
‘Mrs Ruttledge has been very adamant that her husband fell victim to the smear campaign in the media about that trust he held for Draco Malfoy. She also mentioned Marcus Flint.’
‘Very unpleasant, Mr Potter. Unspeakable, anonymous threats.’ She looked at him apologetically as if she was ashamed for their senders.
‘I will try my best, but I have been focused on work, and politics isn’t really my area of interest, so there might not be any point in asking me…’ Harry tried to find his way out of the topic.
‘I fear that such cowardly people as himself have that tendency all the time, Potter.’ Malfoy’s piercing eyes turned straight to Harry’s. But then Harry and Ron looked at themselves, and the man quickly added: ‘Pardon me, I only wanted to suggest that it was the public and the journalists he feared.’
A tall, dark-haired man emerged from the gateway in front of them. He looked immaculate, his robes reminiscent of Malfoy’s. He looked roughly their age, but Harry did not remember him from Hogwarts.
‘Sure, sure.’ Ron replied sadly at the thought they never managed to catch the man, when a voice resonated from a wooden radiophone installed on Harry’s desk:
‘Maybe. About the business though, by disassociating himself from the Malfoys, Rutledge managed to mitigate loss to the distilleries, right?’ Harry rubbed his forehead, trying to make news articles from the past couple of months resurface in his head.
'There he is.' Ron said casually as he looked at Clément Rutledge making his way through Narcissa Malfoy's geraniums.
‘We would like to start straight away if you don’t mind.’ Ron gave the lady a moment to object, but she nodded sadly in agreement.
‘Of course, we have all read the reports, and the trials were broadly covered by the press.’ Atkins paused. ‘In your opinion, do you feel that the Malfoys have abused your trust and goodwill by going to extreme lengths to avoid recompensating the victims of Lucius Malfoy, one of the principal Death Eaters?’
‘He had received numerous threats, which culminated in that statement. It wasn’t just the company losing its revenue, he became paranoid for his safety over some anonymous hate mail.’ Malfoy remarked scornfully.
‘Three days after he issued that statement that any form of association with my name defiles his own.’ Malfoy scoffed.
Harry and Ron had apparated in front of a small chateau, making their way to Draco Malfoy’s the very next morning. Harry realised that the man would be the primary suspect in everyone's eyes. The interview with Atkins was a cherry on top of what he had seen in the media over the past months. Regardless of what Malfoy had or had not done, Harry was in silent agreement with Mrs Rutledge that the man had been lynched constantly over the years. He had considered summoning Malfoy to their office for an initial inquiry, but the man’s appearance in the Auror department the day after the murder would have many implications. To Harry’s surprise, there were protesters outside the property, some had even tents installed. He caught a glimpse of a banner that turned from saying 'Justice for victims' to 'Death to war criminals.'
'And for some unfathomable reason you don't.' Ron countered. ‘Why would people who sent the man hate mail follow through with their threats after he disconnected himself from Malfoy? Had they not achieved what they were going for?’ Ron looked at him funnily. ‘Picture it. He uses the floo network to plant the poison the evening prior and just waits for the poor man to drink it. He knows the family well, he would have known when the housekeeper is off, the victim's drink preferences, their daily routines.’
Garrick had departed into his study to do whatever Garrick did when he was in his study, when the door opened with the beautiful sound of a ringing bell announcing something to do, finally.
Lucious nodded: “I know everything about Toasters and Washing machines now”, he said proudly: “They are quite clever, muggles, I’d never known”.
They walked back into the field of sunflowers again, the night was moist and hot, Draco had taken off his jacket and rolled up the sleeves of his dress shirt.
This morning had started just like any other. He had woken up at precisely 6:45 am, he had taken a shower for 13 minutes and afterwards spent 8 minutes trying (and failing) to detangle and flatten his blond curls, had brewed himself a strong black tea with milk (no sugar) and read the morning newspaper until exactly 7: 34 am at which point he had rolled the newspaper neatly into a tube, squeezed it into his newspaper-holding-barrel (an invention of his own design), fed his cat (yes he had been lonely after prison, there was nothing unusual about having a pet, thank you very much), put on his coat and climbed down the three wonky staircases to step out onto Diagon Alley at exactly 7:45 am.
There was a roll of parchment and a key. Draco took out the key, it looked old and rusty, there was no tag on it. Draco frowned, what might that be to? It could be the key to their Gringotts vault, he realized and put it down quickly. He wanted to put the board back, he really did, but his curiosity got the better of him and he took out the parchment.
Draco hesitated. Harry seemed to be painfully aware of Dracos tentativeness because he immediately said: “Or I could send my partner”.
Now that was offensive, Draco was a lot of things, he could admit to that, but impolite? No no. The Malfoys were nothing if not polite to a threatening degree.
His chest hurt, was he having a heart attack? He couldn’t breathe, there was no oxygen flowing through his veins and into his brain, he would die, right here, between all the people he’d hurt.
When Draco opened the door to his apartment and slipped out of his leather slippers (his cat was lovingly chewing his ankle) he was completely done with this day. He had cleaned the store and reorganised and made tea and thought about mud on Potters head and now he was tired. Drained. Done.
“I only have ten months left, son”, Lucious said: “And you are welcome to visit as often as you’d like”.
He had not seen the stars this clearly in a long time, you couldn’t really see the stars from his flat, the city lights were too bright. He had always watched the stars back at the manor, but he would never go back there again, not only had the state repossessed it, no, he would have never gone there ever again, even if his parents still owned it.
And make a fuss she did. Out came Molly Weasley, levitating a huge cake in front of her in the shape of an Aurors badge. In huge letters there was written: Homicide Department.
“Are you almost done?”, he asked the healers then. One was still trying to fix the knee, the other had addressed Dracos head and Draco could see small shards of glass flying into the tip of the mans wand.
Potter hurried to gather the files and leftovers from the chair and Draco plummeted down onto it rather ungraciously.
“I’m sorry, no”, Draco admitted and studied her face. She was pretty, in a peculiar sort of way, her eyes were big and far apart, her mouth plump but devoid of colour.
“I do not know, Draco”, Harry said and Draco blushed a little from hearing his name so nonchalantly spoken by his companion.
No it was way more comfortable – and familiar – to see Potter as he always had, down the sleek curve of his narrow if a bit pointy nose and although the angle was a bit sharper than he remembered (not that he really remembered at all, Harry Potter never crossed his mind, no Sir) there was still the familiar look of black curls expertly shaped into the form of an exploded birds nest, freckly cheeks (now slightly pink) and thin round glasses slowly but steadily sliding down the bridge of Potters nose until he would reach for them with his index finger and push them up to where they belonged.
“Expelliarmus”, someone shouted and the mans wand flew through the air. Then a second loud bang and the man was gone.
“Fancy much”, Harry teased him and Draco smiled, he could already feel the wine buzzing in his head, he didn’t drink very often.
He went towards his luggage and put on black trousers and a white button down shirt and stole himself over to the door. He grabbed a key from the cabinet in the hallway and stepped outside.
“I’m sure my companion knows the service this spell has done to our nation”, Harry said with a grin at Draco.
Harry and Ginny weren’t stirring when Draco opened the door carefully. He walked into the flat and slipped out of his shoes, tiptoeing towards the living room.
Draco nodded, the Zabinis had played only a small part in the Dark Lords rising but the wizarding world had been fierce and harsh with their judgement.
“Step away from the door, please”, Claire yelled once more and opened the door with the flick of her wand.
On the other half of the table Hermione Granger got up and, nodding once at Harry, left for the garden gate.
“Very interesting”, Mr. Creston said and walked towards a door on their left: “Please come in”, he said and held the door open.
Harry looked at him with raised eyebrows, demanding seriousness and Draco tried his best to stop giggling like a schoolgirl.
“Maybe we would do good to inquire after the wand some more”, Draco suggested: “It was stolen from evidence, maybe the thief tried to sell it somewhere”.
“Yes”, Draco said apologetically: “I need a bottle of your finest Cognac, please”, he said and went over to the counter.
He walked over to where Molly was serving the Badge, he felt curious looks on him but he didn’t care. Harry had kissed him. On the mouth! And it hadn’t been a dare or anything like that. Well it hadn’t exactly been out of love either, sure, but it was better than nothing.
“I don’t think so”, Draco said: “But there’s the Diagon Alley Market every Saturday, I get all my groceries there”.
Potters eyes grew wide and he blushed again. What was it with the blushing today, it seemed everyone just blushed away happily at the mere thought of words.
“Very well”, Draco said: “I’ll take that”, he grabbed for his wallet: “I will also need to exchange about twenty galleons into muggle money”, he said.
“Because someone”, Potter sighed and looked back towards the door: “Is trying to fix the Elder wand”.
“Oh look at the time”, Harry said then: “I better get dressed”, he said and went from the kitchen: “Don’t kill each other”, he said jokingly but Draco swallowed thickly.
Harry took out his wand and Draco flinched away but Harry just cast a Patronus. A moment later there was a knock at the door.
“Don’t you see the hilarity in this?”, Potter asked and wiped a tear from the corner of his eye: “Of course someone wants to kill me, it has been six long years without mortal danger, I should have known it wouldn’t last”.
Draco had since come mostly to terms with it and had only allowed himself the small pleasure of calling it the damn mug every time he thought of it, just to keep some perspective. The damn mug was hideous and on top of being hideous it was also strangely boring, a combination of attributes Draco couldn’t condone. It was huge (so Garrick could fill more nothing into it presumably) and greenish-yellow and there was a goat in the front (or was it the back, who knew, it was just a damn mug) telling whomever was unfortunate enough to be presented with it that “Today is a goat day”.
The cells opened at ten, apparently word about his being here had spread and the other inmates were ogling him as he made his way over to the library.
‘Named a suspect by you or them?’ Malfoy waved an issue of the Daily Prophet lazily, smirking at Ron.
‘With all due respect, I am sure that the Ministry’s lawyers are working hard to solve this matter, and it wouldn’t be helpful for me to berate them over issues that I don’t have a proper understanding of…’ Harry tried to protest against dwelling further into the topic to no avail, as Atkins continued:
‘What can you tell us about Clément Rutledge?’ Harry said a little too vigorously to divert their attention. Draco looked at him tardily and ran his hand through silver blonde hair.
‘I didn’t realise you know about Clément.’ She said. ‘Well, he is welcome whenever he needs accommodation, but he hasn’t been around much. Last time I spoke to him over a month ago he said he had some matters to attend to before returning to France, but I don’t know if he’s still in the country.’
‘Very perceptive of you, Potter, I am glad my taxes were put to good use in your Auror training.’ The blonde chuckled, exhaling smoke into the air. He looked at him with amusement, and Harry sighed in annoyance.
'Those people's lives had been poisoned the moment your garbage father...' Ron's anger did not get a chance to manifest itself in full glory as Harry gripped his forearm, stopping him abruptly.
‘The art of delegating.’ Harry grinned at him, unwrapping letters Mrs Rutledge had handed over, dividing them into two piles, at the sight of which Ron reluctantly took one.
‘She is having tea in the kitchen. We gave Mrs Rutledge a calming potion, but she is still rather shaken, so it might be best to talk to Ms Goldeen first.’ Billie informed. ‘She is about 70 years old.’
‘We understand, but who could it have been? Aside from yourself, Ms Goldeen, your son, Draco Malfoy and Clément, was there anyone else with authorisation to use your fireplace?’
‘For now, we need you to answer some initial questions.’ Harry said. The man nodded slowly, so he continued: ‘When was the last time you talked to Mr Rutledge?’
‘Again, thank you for having me, Mr Atkins.’ A different, softer voice followed the introductions, this one very familiar to the listener.
‘In that case… Have you ever noticed any inclinations that Mrs Rutledge may carry a grudge over being moved away from the family business?’ Harry asked.
‘About the hate mail… Did the threats not stop after his public announcement that he would renounce Malfoys’ assets?’ Harry asked.
‘Gentlemen.’ He greeted them with a nod and passed them on his way to the door. His accent was foreign. Harry and Ron nodded back.
‘Look at him talk. Do you even know where the laundry machine is in our flat?’ Hermione cut him off. ‘Although, in a convoluted way that leads me to the suggestion that perhaps life would be a tad easier if you socialised a bit more and eventually found yourself a partner.’
‘He writes about something Mr Rutledge did after making that statement.’ Harry continued. ‘Your subsequent actions might harm us all.’
‘There’s family and friends, but they haven’t been visiting much, because my husband has been in isolation since Flint threatened him.’ She replied sadly.
‘7 Alford Street, Report of Death.’ A female voice announced in the very same, expressionless manner it announced floor numbers in the Ministry’s elevators.
The house was spacious with warm tapestry draped over its walls, wooden floors and traditionally designed furniture. It would have had a homely feel to it if it was not for the ample number of Ministry law enforcement officials working their way through routine procedures. They entered a spacious kitchen filled with fresh vegetables and spices growing in flowerpots.
‘Sorry, I only have his French address.’ She told them, and then added when she saw their raised eyebrows: ‘When he contacts me from England, I use his owl to write back to him.’
If Harry wasn't looking for it, he would have easily missed a slight tremor in Malfoy's hand. He looked composed as he shook his head. 'Sorry to dissapoint you.'
‘Yes, that’s the one.’ She nodded. ‘There is also Mrs Rutledge’s nephew, Clément, but he lives in France, and we haven’t hosted him for about a month now.’
‘I’ll send a summon to the flat first thing when we’re back at the office.’ Harry suggested, turning his head away from the man’s rather well-built back.
Ron looked at him taken aback. 'No wonder, he's had plenty of practice brewing that god awful poison.'
‘Now, the Ministry has recently issued a special report on war reparations paid over the past two years in connection to numerous convictions along with a forecast of the outstanding amount that is due to the families of the victims that will be paid out in the future. As I am sure we are all aware, the report has caused an uproar given how wealthy families associated with the Death Eaters are and how low low the value of assets they have reported to own is.’
‘In one of my flats in central London.’ Malfoy grabbed a piece of paper and wrote the address down. Harry reached out his hand and noticed that Malfoy looked at it in hesitation, as if he did not want to touch it, but he eventually handed the parchment over. ‘He doesn’t like to stay in one place for too long, but that’s where he stays when he’s in London. Anything else?’
‘What Ron meant to say...' Harry said looking at his friend, trying to calm him down. 'Was that perhaps Howard Rutledge could have, at any point of your last conversation, feel threatened?’ Harry continued, turning away slowly to face Malfoy.
‘Ms Goldeen, Mr Rutledge was found in the house, so it could not have been someone without connections to the family. Could you tell us - to your best knowledge - who has access to the floo network?’ Ron continued.
‘Ron. Listen to this.’ Harry called to his friend, who was also buried in paper. He continued to read the last few sentences of the letter out loud. ‘I regret you did not listen to Cécile’s advice. I am afraid you are not leaving me much choice in the matter. I will see you soon. Clément.’
The elf came to his rescue. She stopped having led them to a spacious, well-lit office with two armchairs facing a large, wooden desk, behind which sat Draco Malfoy. Harry could tell his garments were of high quality, silver embroidery catching eye on dark material. He looked rather relaxed. His face seemed to never had seen a wrinkle, except for the faint line on his forehead Harry had remembered from Hogwarts. He was sitting comfortably, his elbows resting on upholstered armrests. No wonder that to the media he looked nothing but guilty and boasting about it.
‘The stream might have thinned, but they kept coming.’ She shook her head slowly. ‘Harold blocked owl access to the house, but he was still exposed to it whenever he left the house until he stopped leaving at all.’
‘I think their sales have gone up.’ Ron agreed as he was looking through a briefing file Billie had compiled before going home. He caught a glimpse of his watch. ‘Hey, let’s get back to this tomorrow, promised ‘Mione I would be back for dinner.’
‘No. I don’t live in the house, dear. When I came to work at seven, Mrs Rutledge had already found her husband in the living room. She was crying so violently she didn’t even notice me come in. I was the one who summoned the aurors.’
‘Good.’ Agreed Ron. ‘I want to search the house and that flat too; it belongs to the brat after all. Just need to press Wizengamont for a warrant.’
The lady was indeed very old, but she seemed lively. She stood up when they entered the room and bowed slightly greeting them.
‘Good morning, Ms Goldeen.’ Ron greeted her with Harry nodding politely at his side. ‘I am Auror Weasley and this is Auror Potter, we will be conducting the case.’
‘Must be something.’ Ron shrugged. ‘Though a part of me hopes it was Flint instead. We have been after this fucker for long enough. About time we got him.’
‘They cook, too, you know.’ Ron added. He was browsing through the same issue of the Daily Prophet Harry had just discarded, and before Hermione could bite back, Ron exclaimed:
‘Oh.’ Mrs Rutledge gasped, raising hands to her mouth. ‘No, I must have been upstairs. Harold would always read in the sitting room until late at night. Rarely did we ever go to sleep together, I would usually drift away before he made his way to bed.’
‘Shouldn’t you ask a lawyer? I wouldn’t know.’ Draco sighed. ‘I imagine their solicitors having more pressing matters to work on now. And mind you, my father named several trustees for my benefit before the war. Even if I do get cut off from his share, it will have little effect on me.’
‘Mr Rutledge has been very anxious lately because of all the correspondence he has been receiving. I would sometimes hide some of it if I could do so before he saw the mail, because it was very unhealthy for him.’
‘May I offer you a drink?’ He looked suggestively at a cabinet filled to its edges with bottles of amber-like liquid. Many of them bore the Rutledge family insignia.
The elf excused herself, and Harry took a seat, but Ron kept his distance from behind the armchairs.
A sigh followed. ‘As I said, we are not in touch, and it would be out of place for me to tell them anything on the matter.’
May had just started with the summer glimpsing through the chilly air April had left behind. A man sitting in an armchair sipped on firewhisky, sunrays warming his skin. Birds sang cheerfully outside a nearby window to the tune of a violin resonating from a radio box situated on a nearby coffee table. The man smiled lightly whilst bathing in the sun, gesturing with a finger to the rhythm. The song went quiet, and he raised the glass for another sip.
‘My pleasure.’ There was a short, awkward pause. ‘Although it may be unhealthy to dwell in the past, we must remember the sacrifice that secured our future.’ Harry’s voice was stiff, it seemed like he was trying to convince himself that it was a good decision to accept the invitation. He was clearly uncomfortable, yet doing his best to sound politely.
‘Mrs Rutledge, we have no records of who entered your flat through the fireplace that night due to the privacy regulations at the Ministry, but we have the number and timeframe of connections made.’ Harry said while examining the documents Billie had handed over to him. ‘There were two made in morning and afternoon hours.’
‘His wife told me that.’ Malfoy explained. ‘My family has been investing in their distilleries for generations, and that's how he pays off... He would not write me back once he issued the statement, so I covertly met with Cécile instead. He had forbidden her from leaving the house unless it was for necessities 'for her own safety', had the housekeeper follow her around if she did indeed go out. She asked for patience and understanding given the situation, she truly is an angel of a woman.’ He snorted.
‘Friendship.’ Malfoy smiled at him. ‘She made sure I had everything I needed after I returned from France without my mother, offered her advice whenever I could use it.’
‘That’s correct…’ Harry replied shortly but continued when the interviewer waited for further comments. ‘If it wasn’t for them, I would not be sitting here today, and this is precisely what I said in front of the Wizengamont.’
‘Don’t think your witty remarks are helping you.’ Ron warned him, he was losing his patience. Malfoy’s eyes wandered to his stubborn gaze, and he frowned.
‘Thank you, Mrs Rutledge.’ Ron raised from his armchair as the widow was fetching a parcel made up of paper from a nearby stand. She handed it over to Harry. ‘We will contact you when we know more, but don’t hesitate to contact us if you recall any other details that may be helpful.’
‘Mr Rutledge was not well born. The Rutledges might have relaxed their ways and are no longer a part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, but they value their traditions. Mrs Rutledge’s parents arranged the marriage with a promising, albeit half-blood, entrepreneur, hoping for him to continue the legacy of Rutledge distilleries.’
‘Let me ask you this instead, Mr Potter. Have you remained in touch with the Malfoys after the trials?’
‘I wouldn’t. Ever since the war he has been travelling back and forth between England and France. He seems to be very good friends with Master Draco, though, he might be able to tell you more about his current whereabouts.’ She offered.
‘About Mr Rutledge’s behaviour, Ms Goldeen…’ Ron continued as Harry was taking a note of Clément. ‘Could you elaborate on him being anxious? What was he doing? I don’t mean to disturb you, but could it be possible at all that it was a suicide due to the pressure he had been facing for a prolonged period of time?’
They got through a spacious garden and climbed their way up to the door, where they were greeted by a house elf. They did not need to go far to reach their destination, but the corridor they were passing through seemed to extend itself with every step Harry took. He could feel the blood pumping in his veins, its noise deafening their footsteps. Overwhelmed with anticipation, he was startled when he felt Ron's hand on his shoulder.
‘The victim’s name is Harold Rutledge, the cause of death was self-administered poison added to the man’s firewhisky, initial exam indicated he’s been dead for a few hours. His wife, Cécile, had found him in the morning, just before the housekeeper came in to work and called us.’ Billie took a breath to continue. ‘No sign of forceful entry; all wards intact. We ran a quick inquiry with the travel people, the property has been properly registered for restricted access to the floo network. They have five incoming sources in their records utilised in the last 2 months.’
‘Hey, Harry.’ Ron stopped in the door threshold. ‘Meet me in front of Malfoy’s first thing in the morning. The address is in the briefing file, let’s get this over with as soon as we can.’
‘Mrs Rutledge.’ Billie approached a woman in her early fifties. She tried to smile in acknowledgment, but a grimace formed on her face instead. ‘This is Auror Weasley and Auror Potter. They will be conducting this case.’
‘Subsequent actions?’ Ron frowned. ‘Is he talking about the business? He might have some interest seeing how he is family. Oh, maybe he would have inherited the distilleries if it wasn’t for the family picking a husband for their daughter?’
‘We are conducting the Rutledge case and you have been named a suspect.’ Ron informed him bluntly. ‘You are expected to answer to all of our inquiries and possible summons to the Ministry, and you may not leave the country. That includes visits to your mother in France. We also expect you to fully cooperate in the investigation. In the event you do not cooperate, you will be brought in immediately. ’
‘He had a lot to prove, you know. The Malfoy scandal got to his head, but I don’t think he would have harmed himself.’ She told them. ‘And not in such a horrible way…’
‘Your humility has no boundaries, Mr Potter, but I must insist. I doubt that our listeners would forgive me if I didn’t use the opportunity.’ The journalist laughed softly.
‘Potter, Weasley.’ Malfoy raised from behind the desk, nodded in greeting and pointed at the two armchairs in front of him.
Violin sounds filled the room again, and the man raised the glass to his mouth one last time before making his way out with a glimmer of hope in his eyes.
‘I don’t think you understand that our visit is a courtesy.’ Ron looked at him with distaste. ‘It could be easily arranged for you to see us at the Ministry.’
‘Mr Potter, I am happy to answer your questions, but I have served this family for nearly thrice as long as you have been alive.’ The lady looked at him with a sad smile. ‘I would like it to be noted that I am convinced of Mrs Rutledge’s innocence.’
Harry Potter Refuses to Support the Campaign for Recompensating War Victims The heading caught Harry’s eyes immediately along with a picture of him trying to escape the reporters that had gathered in front of the radio studio.
“I never thought of it like that”, Draco said: “I always thought they did exactly what was expected of them, they raised me to be just like them”.
“Come on, I won’t tell anyone”, Draco tried, but to no avail, Harry just smirked and continued walking.
“Oh you heard that, did you?”, Harry said and smiled a sad smile: “Don’t worry about it, she will understand”.
He made a mental note to get to know Teddy, Nymphadora had been his aunt after all, maybe it was time to reach out to his less close family.
The witch that was sitting there seemed stressed and preoccupied, currently talking to a man in his fifties. Harry and Draco got in line and waited.
Fleur came to him and kissed him twice on each cheek, she was saying something, thanking him, but he barely heard her.
But there were instances where Malfoy just couldn’t avoid him. The classes they had together for example.
Draco looked at him and suddenly he looked into the horribly swollen and disfigured face of a boy the Snatchers had captured in some random forest. He felt the fear inside his bones, felt the dark mark burn under his sleeve.
The man rummaged through his register and gave Draco a few paper notes, he knew not what to make of them.
Malfoys lips were warm and soft. He smelled like cool water and moss and lime. Harry couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t think, the tingling in his whole body was all consuming, he closed his eyes.
They set off on the boat mere ten minutes later and were ingulfed in heavy rain once more, Harry conjured two umbrellas and together they stood at the bow of the ship, defying the waves.
“Right”, Draco repeated: “I’m going to make you some tea”, Garrick had – of course – only put boiling water into his cup: “And let you get on with it”.
“If nothing comes of it we take his picture to the Prophet and see if anyone reckognizes him”, Harry said: “There has to be someone out there who knows him”.
“She’ll be very confused and she gets angry when she’s confused, just so you know”, he explained with a knowing frown.
He felt Harrys lips part and breathed him in, Harry tasted like birthday cake and Cognac, he smelled like peace and home and just more.
“Yes”, Lucious said: “I’ve read it in the papers”, Harry nodded: “But how come my son is involved in one of your cases?”.
“Son”, Lucious Malfoy breathed and stood up. He stood there for a couple of moments, unsure of what to do, then he walked over to his son, who was quite surprised by the action and hugged him tightly.
Draco lay on the floor when the wardens finally realised something was wrong and pulled the inmate off him.
“I understand they took away his fortune once his illegal dealings became known?”, Harry half asked, half ascertained.
The march was long and the hot sun burned down on them with verocity but after a couple of minutes Draco could see the Burrow in the distance. He had heard it had been badly damaged a couple of years back but it seemed the Weasleys had built everything back up in time. It looked just like he had imagined it, high and intricate and like it might be toppled by a gust of wind
He leaned across Draco and pressed a little button, Draco held his breath. Potter smelled nice, like lavender and lemon, his hair was slightly damp from the shower.
When Harry sat down this time there was already a piece of paper in front of him. Harry smiled a little and picked the note up, unfolding it carefully. He read it five times.
He walked up the last flight of stairs and into his flat. He was just thinking about what had happened to that partner Potter had taken with him, had he vanished, had they just left him there alone at the crime scene, when the curse hit him.
He twirled around himself, getting stretched and contorted and after a few seconds he stood inside a big Entrance Hall of the Ministry.
They sat there, no one was talking, Draco looked around, Luna Lovegood was dreamily staring at the cake (corpse), Ron Weasley looked furious, Nevil Longbottom was trying hard to supress his laughter. Draco decided to befriend him next.
He leapt to his feet and grabbed his coat, his body doing things before his head could think about them. He put on a scarf and gloves before realising it was the mid of June and the night had come with a gentle, warm breeze. He was out of the door in a matter of seconds and on his way down to the front door he tripped on the stairs and almost ripped his knees into two pieces. He got himself up and only barely realised his bleeding and throbbing knee as he sprinted down towards the the alley.
Alrighty then, Hermione it was. He swam over to her and began slicing at her ropes, when the half man, half shark figured Krum appeared. Harry nodded at him and continued his pursuit, but Krum was faster and had Hermione by his side in an instant. He was about to swim away with her when Harry, in utter confusion, yelled out to him: “No you got the wrong one”, but only bubbles escaped his mouth, he didn’t care: “Malfoys over there”.
Harry nodded and stood up: ”Let me know if you need anything”, he said and walked out the door, Draco hurrying behind him.
“What do you mean?”, Potter asked and raised an eyebrow: “We”, he emphasized the word and motioned between the two of them: “Aren’t doing anything”, he motioned to the unconscious body across from him: “We”, again he emphasized the word: “Are going to investigate”.
Draco huffed: “Because I was a condescending prick”, he said and picked a piece of lettuce out of his box: “And you were a mistrustful drama queen. It’s not like we were a match made in heaven”.
“Oh you should be locked up with a smile like that”, she giggled and Draco felt the heat rise in his cheeks.
“Don’t be daft”, Garrick barked either at Draco or the mug, it was impossible to know for certain and limped out of the workshop.
“Yes”, she beamed and signed over towards the chicken coop: “Those two are mine, the ones with the dark hair”.
Draco took it and looked at it for a long while: “It’s Cedar”, he said then: “With unicorn hair for the core, maybe fifteen years old”.
“Are you quite satisfied?”, Draco asked and rummaged around the small closet underneath the countertop.
“You’re not so bad, you know”, Harry said suddenly and Draco looked at him. Harry wasn’t looking at him, he was watching the pot intently, stirring from time to time.
“Well”, Harry said: “It will be Ginnys parents, Ron and Hermione, Ginnys siblings and of course Fleur, Bills wife”.
Harry hesitated. What if he had? That didn’t mean anything, he was a horny teenager, he used everything to get himself going.
Draco huffed: “There are no more Dementors in Azkaban”, he said confidently but internally he was shivering. He had never managed to produce a corporeal patronus, ever, not even in the safety of his own home or the darkness of Garricks workshop where he had spent more than one evening trying desperately to make something come from the thin silver fog that sprayed out of his wand. It didn’t work. Draco was either too stupid or not talented enough for a patronus and Harry was never to find out and if it was the death of him.
“We have a big day coming”, Garrick exclaimed heavily: “A big, big day”, he resumed staring into his mug.
He turned towards the other three figures and pondered who he should pick. Hermione or Cho? Both he would miss very much, Cho because she was oh so pretty and Hermione because she was one of his best friends.
Draco hesitated: “Maybe it would help you to let it out”, he said tentatively: “Punch me, or yell at me”.
It was five to six and Harry was fidgeting. He was sitting in the common room with Ron and Hermione and they were talking, he just didn’t know what they were talking about.
“Very well”, Mr. Creston said turned around towards Martha: “Martha have you come up with something yet?”.
“Yes”, Harry said: “Somehow I thought that might fix things, but the more time goes by the less sure I get. I think it isn’t meant to be, the Baby and Ginny and me”.
“Hello and welcome to the Ministry, how may I assist you today?”, the witch at the desk asked and Harry put on his brightest smile.
“He’s in St. Mungos but he’s physically unharmed”, Harry reassured him: “Apparently he gave Gordoff quite the hard time”, he smirked.
Draco wondered why his father was not invited, sure it would be his mother who was waiting at the round table. But when he rounded the corner there was Harry Potter sitting there, chewing on his fingernails.
“I am sorry that I could not be of greater help to you”, Lucious said, a pained expression on his face.
And so Draco had stopped correcting and reminding and had accepted Boy and deep down he felt a prickle of fondness toward the man every time he heard it (very deep down, it was still all kinds of insulting).
“Likewise”, she said and smiled: “I never thought I would see the both of you in the same room again”, she said and looked between them.
There was loud applause, loud and long as Molly walked to the middle of the table and let the cake sit down on top of it. The table groaned.
“Well let’s see”, he started, more to himself than to Potter at that point: “Your first wand was holly and phoenix feather, but that might have been only because The Dark Lords was as well”, he rambled on looking at the etiquettes on the boxes: “You’re certainly powerful, so maybe dragon heart string could fit, but you’re also loyal which dragon heart string isn’t so that might be a problem”, he went to the next rack: “Thestral hair could work, since you’ve been known to be quite angsty at times and they value bravery but I’d rather”, he stopped and turned towards Potter, face light up with certainty: “I got it”, he exclaimed.
