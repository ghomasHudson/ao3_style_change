“But I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely,” Dumbledore continued, his tone reassuring as the students slowly calmed down from the state of uproar. Some students still looked almost murderous and Harry wasn't at all surprised to realise that most of them were the seventh year players for whom this would have been their last year playing Quidditch at the school. He felt for them. “I have great pleasure. Announcing that this year at Hogwarts – ”
“Seriously?” he scoffed at himself, glaring down at his crotch for a long moment before throwing off the covers and heading for the bathroom after checking quickly that his roommates were still fast asleep. “You know? What, can't even think the word? Ugh…”

No, Harry definitely wasn't comforted to know that the Ministry was involved somehow.

Some of the schools weren’t listed by name in ‘

His uniform, bought on a trip to Diagon Alley with Mrs Weasley, fit much better than his pyjamas although as was his habit he purposefully left his top button undone and wore his tie as loosely as possibly, the knot small and tight. Running his fingers through his messy hair he regretted not letting Mrs Weasley cut it before school had started, the long strands even more difficult to tame than usual, but Ron was trying a new style and wanted “a bit of support” so he'd let himself be talked into leaving it to grow out a little bit more. First chance he got, however, he'd be having a couple of inches taken off to help tame the mess.
No, not really. Oh, his reasons for entering still stood, but now that the moment was almost upon them he realised that he would be infinitely happier if someone else were selected.
“He's really excited!” Colin announced, loud enough for anyone sitting nearby them to hear. They were halfway down the long table and it was mostly the fourth and fifth years who had all adopted the same half-horrified look as Harry. In fact Colin was the only third year anywhere near them. “I just hope he's in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?”
mother, DeLacour?” Harry enquired, tightening his grip on his best friends elbow in order to stop the volatile redhead launching himself towards the Slytherin’s. Now, how to suitably retaliate… “That expressions she’s always got on his face, like she’s got dung under his nose? Has she always looked like that, or is it just because you were with her?”
“Draco, time to go,” Narcissa called out, opening her arms to pick up her son but Lucius beat her to it. He responded to her frown by gesturing towards her still healing ribs. “I’m fine.”
“Thank you,
His fellow champions looked at him in something akin to horror, the idea of un-excusing themselves from the difficult exams abhorrent, whilst Madame Maxine offered him a smile.
“How this situation arose, we do not know,” Dumbledore continued, his voice back to its usual calm level as he surveyed the people gathered in two distinct groups in the room; teachers and students. “It seems to me, however, that we have no choice but to accept it.”

“I wonder if JJ will ask Madame to swap rooms at some point given that it seems a little unfair that of the only two couples attending this tournament he and Fabian had been split up while Javier and Claude are together,” Draco murmured, placing the last of his textbooks on the shelf before moving on to sorting out the rest of his school supplies. His quills were some of the finest money could buy, at his father’s insistence, and were kept in a protective leather roll up case which had his families crest embossed on the outside. It had been his mother who had insisted that he have a personal set of silver inkwells which he could refill as needed, the delicate design of snakes, peacock feathers and roses showing off the quality craftsmanship of the piece. “I can't imagine Jan or Thierry having a problem with swapping.”
The squib, a caretaker of some sort judging by his clothing, nodded sharply before leaving.

“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.”
Silence had fallen upon the Entrance Hall as everyone listened to what was being said.
Draco smiled fondly before enquiringly of his female friend,
Hermione let out a peel of laughter as Ron spluttered, slipping her arms through theirs and pulling them along the empty corridor as quickly as she could knowing they were now late.
Victor Krum, Cedric Diggory and Draco Malfoy were all stood in front of the truly enormous fireplace, the only source of light in the room, creating a trio of impressive silhouettes; Krum was by far the most muscular but the other two weren’t lacking in the muscles department.
A quick flick of her own wand, paired with a simple summoning spell, and Ramona was soon in possession of a medium sized box of Belgian truffles. The Muggle kind, Draco noticed with silent approval, rather than the Magical equivalent. If there was one thing that Muggles, particularly the Belgians, could do better than Witches and Wizards it was make superior chocolate. She handed them over without a word, Draco accepting them with a small nod.

Hermione shot him a glare before continuing.
“No, it’s a secret,” Draco sighed, turning to meet Ramona’s disapproving frown even as they all sidestepped together so as to get out of the narrow door that would take them out onto the patch of grass that lay between the castle and their carriage. “It’s a test of courage and bravery, though, so it could be just about anything which, you know, isn’t exactly helpful.”

Between one breath and the next Ron’s expression became completely closed off, all traces of his faked smile disappearing as he pushed himself almost violently up onto his knees so that he could jerk his heavy bed-curtains with a passing comment, his voice flat and cold,
Narcissa had known that her visit would most likely end up this way.
“Is Viktor Krum as handsome up close as he is at a distance?”
Leaning down to kiss her mother’s cheek as was expected of her Narcissa offered her father a small smile before squaring her shoulders and taking a step back, removing herself from immediate striking distance whilst her hand curled around the jewelled handle of her wand.
He did know.
Acting solely on instinct Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment.
A hush fell over the crowd as everyone waited with baited breath to see what would happen to the twins and, when nothing obvious seemed to take place, the Hogwarts students broke out into thunderous applause, cheering far too wildly in response to what had taken place.
“What happened?” Lucius demanded, holding onto her chin as she reclined back into his favourite armchair and examining the cuts to her cheek. “Cissa, what happened to you?”
Gritting her teeth the young woman pushed herself up onto her knees, whimpering softly as her bruises body protested, before finally continuing to rise unsteadily to her feet. It wasn’t the first time her mother had physically struck Narcissa, none of the four siblings had been spared the punishment of her stinging blows growing up, but it had

Harry spun around to face his attacker only to find himself gazing at a pure white ferret, suspended in the air by whatever spell Professor Moody who was stood at the foot of the stairs had cast upon it. No, not it,
Why would no one believe him?
Finally, after a seemingly agonising wait, Dumbledore made the important announcement,
He tried to picture Winona Ryder, the actress he had had a crush on for a couple of years after seeing her in ‘Beetlejuice’ and ‘Edward Scissorhands’ without the Dursley's finding out he'd watched them given that they were about “freaks” and were therefore banned, but he couldn't get his mind to focus and her face would melt away inside his mind, transforming into that of Charlie Weasley. Eventually he gave up fighting it, allowing his mind to supply with images both from his dream and from the time spent with the older Weasley, and it wasn't too long after he'd given in that he felt the delicious feeling of his climax building.
Javier shrugged as best he could under the sudden onslaught of his boyfriend who had obviously grown tired of stretching out in front of the fire and had dropped down onto the bed alongside the trio, landing almost entirely on top of his boyfriend and snuggling his face into his neck with a content sigh. If there was one thing Claude loved to do it was snuggle and all three of them had been reduced to acting as his teddy bear on more than one occasion although since they'd begun dating he targeted his boyfriend almost exclusively.
This question came, unsurprisingly, from Josephine.
“Technically I think this is a Scottish castle, rather than an English one,” Harry pointed out, rising from his seat on the bench and shouldering his bag. Pausing he held his hand out to the older boys who rose to stand side by side in front of him, Javier literally towering over him whilst Claude was only a little bit taller than he was. “I suppose I’ll see you around?”

Something jabbed into his side, an elbow, causing him to flinch away and let out a startled,
“Shh!” he hissed once more, nodding towards the door. “Listen.”
“No,” Draco responded, pitching his tone to be reassuring even as he turned to gesture at where Claude was now stretching his arms above his head, his jacket half on. “Claude.”

He was forced to endure the celebration in his honour for an hour, during which his voice grew hoarse from telling people over and over again that he hadn’t entered his name at all.
To the right of the door the long thin room which effectively ran the full length of the magical interior of the carriage was split up into two types of cubicles; the ones nearest the door were the toilets and the ones furthest away were the showers. There were six of each.
– Please be aware that in some places I will be utilising some of the original material, although it has all been adapted and altered to fit with my changes to the overall storyline. None of it is literally copy/pasted as I consider that to be cheating (and borderline plagiarism which is not acceptable in my book.) As the story progresses this will happen less and less but in this first chapter, particularly in the very first section where the “scene is being set”, I struggled not to include some aspects. Just wanted to warn you.
Draco knew who she meant but still tried to feign ignorance.
Harry was understandably impressed, his eyes going almost comically wide with admiration.
As the two Headmasters made a great show of greeting each other the
“Harry Potter!” Dumbledore’s called out stilly. “Harry! Up here, if you please!”
At that Ramona let out an unladylike snort, catching up with him, while Javier and Claude shared a blatantly amused look before sizing up Fleur’s goons who looked ready to attack.
“Hiya, Harry!”

before he was born. As such he had been groomed towards the darker aspects of magic all his life and it was only his friendship with Krum, the talented Quidditch player, that kept him on the side of good.
His neck was starting to turn an alarming shade of red…
“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the Tournament, none of which have been very successful,” Dumbledore continued calmly. “However, our own Departments of International Magical Co-Operation and Magical Games and Sports have decided that the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that, this time no champion shall find himself or herself in mortal danger.”
To say that Professor Snape’s gaze turned icy was an understatement.
Gone were the sun-kissed honey blonde curls, replaced by a mess of jet-black hair which was just a fraction too long. Tanned skin became almost painfully pale. Soft, plump cheeks became hollowed, more angular but not quite as sharp as Draco’s own deadly cheekbones.
First the
Lara giggled, tossing her blonde curls over her shoulder,
“Shut up, DeLacour,” Harry grumbled, taking Ron by the elbow. “C’mon, Ron…”
“Just think of all the positive outcomes that could happen because of this,” Ramona tacked on eagerly, leaning against Draco's side in such a way that he was forced to lean against Javier's free side turning his bed into one big snuggle fest. “You're the only one of us to have ever been to England and you don't even remember it. None of us have seen any magical school but our own. Plus one of us could be selected as the Beauxbatons champion…”
From the other side of the door they heard a loud booming voice call for silence from the students which had previously been causing something of a racket before requesting,
with the hopes that he would be badly injured or possibly even killed.
He unfolded the piece of parchment slowly and carefully.
Draco frowned as a sudden realisation hit him and then he couldn't help but burst out laughing, an action which only seemed to annoy the already irate Slytherin even further.
Everyone watched, waiting to see what would happened next.
“You're going to have an interesting year,” Bill responded, his eyes twinkling even as his words filled Harry with dread. Every year thus far had been an
? My God,
“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” said Professor Karkaroff, moving to stand by Viktor Krum. Harry did not like the way his blue eyes had all but frozen over, a feeling of lead polling in his stomach. “
For a moment he thought they were wearing some of Hermione’s S.P.E.W badges, although he couldn’t fathom why they would have had such a dramatic change of heart regarding the treatment of House Elves, but as he came closer he realised that they were something else.
“Wonder why that was?” Harry muttered, cutting her off as the pair of them sidestepped to allow Cedric Diggory and his ever present gaggle of supporters to pass unchallenged. Most of the group were girls who until the moment they’d spotted Harry had been simpering and sighing over Cedric; once they’d noticed the younger student who threatened their chosen champion’s position they diverted their attention to him in the form of glares and sneers. A bitter sigh escaped him once they’d passed them by. “Honestly, why do people still think that I want all of this? News flash; I don’t. Ah, well, never mind that now; Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon and we both know that that’s going to be an
Harry’s jaw dropped, along with the tin of polish he’d been holding. “Oh. I… did not see that coming.”
“I reckon he means sixth year, ‘Mione.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, wondering what Draco seemed to be hesitating to say.
Patiently waiting in hope that Healer Benson would buy it, Harry pulled a sheepish look in her direction. She sighed and gave what could almost be considered a laugh before dismissing his vitals with a wave of her hand.
“Of course not,” Harry said. “I’m just trying to think of girls who would understand and in the case of Luna, wouldn’t drive you mad within the first hour. Shame about the cousin thing, really.”
Nodding, Albus shovelled a forkful of potato into his mouth, spraying pieces everywhere as he spoke. “Well, he wasn’t supposed to say anything, because they’re not doing the… what’s the thing they have to do? There’s some fancy word for it. Paper stuff.” Waiting for an answer that never came, he shrugged. “They’re gonna do it while he’s home so that there won’t be lots of kids reading about it at school while he’s there. But he told me because we’re friends,” Albus finished, sticking his chest out proudly.
That was the only logical explanation he had for seeing Voldemort standing across the bar.
“That’s hardly the point, Harry.”
Watching as Draco launched into an animated retelling of what Hermione had described to him as absolute hell, Harry grinned at the enthusiastic hand gestures that accompanied his story. There was a lot of tension within both the Ministry and the wizarding banking communities over the current legislation Hermione hoped to pass; the details were a bit hazy to Harry, but he knew they had been motivated by some of her conversations with Griphook all those years ago about wand lore and goblin rights. Entertained as Harry was by the thought of Hermione and Draco in a room together—from what she’d described, Draco was actually responsible for a lot of the financial decisions at Gringotts—he couldn’t help but get distracted by his actions. The way the light cast by street lamps caught his eyes, the stray piece of hair that had slipped loose from his winter hat. How his long spindly fingers moved with each word, telling a story of their own.
“—filthy half breeds, turning the Noble House of Black into a common—“
Shoving both hands into his pockets, Harry mustered up what little energy he had left to follow her and hoped that any discussions could wait until tomorrow. Nightmares be damned, right now he would be the first to admit that he needed to rest before losing the ability to function entirely.
So occupied were his thoughts as he relished in the delight he drew from this park that Harry almost didn’t notice the man standing partly obscured by the giant Christmas tree at first. It wasn’t until he heard an uncertain yet familiar voice calling out his name that his movements halted, turning his head to the right to see a familiar blonde regarding him with guarded curiosity.
Groaning, Harry ran an errant hand through his hair. “Can you not? I don’t want him to think we’re talking about him.”
“Not like that, you idiot.” There was a moment’s pause, during which Harry refused to look back at what Draco was doing for fear of what he might see.
actually, that might be a bit too explicit for them.
Looking away, Draco’s voice was small when he next spoke. “It feels like it might be today.”
Harry’s voice caught on the words, causing Draco to chuckle lightly. Some things never changed.
“It’s still not great, unfortunately. It’s probably worse for Draco than most of them.”
“Sure got a funny way of showing it.”
“I mean, I might.”
Stepping out into the street as the lights changed, Hermione nodded. “It would probably be easier for you to do something anonymous. I’ll have a think on it.”
“Oh, but—er, right. Must have been someone at work who mentioned it.”
“One last thing. I can’t share confidential details with your friends, but I do suggest that you talk to them about what you’re going through.”
“It’s alright. She’s got the best healers, and there’s not much I can really do besides providing moral support as requested.”
Turning back to the mugs in front of her, Ginny shrugged. “Don’t think on it too much, we’re getting divorced now.”
So many words had been left unsaid between them. It had taken every ounce of the self control he possessed not to fall at Draco’s feet—metaphorically speaking, of course—and answer his letter last year with a resounding
Grateful for the distraction, Harry nodded quickly. “We spent a lot of time repairing it after the — after school, and all that. Aside from Walburga out there, everything fixed up quite nicely.”
Groaning, Harry ran a hand through his hair. He wanted to scream at them both that they were being idiots, didn’t they know this was Malfoy? They couldn’t trust him!
Lighthearted as he knew she meant to be, Harry could hear the bitter edge to her words. “I’m sorry, Gin.”
before she took her leave. Turning back to where Draco stood by the fireplace, Harry noticed that Andromeda and Teddy had also left the room. If he strained his ears he could make out muffled voices through Teddy’s bedroom door and he sent a silent thanks to Andromeda for the privacy.
“You don’t know that,” Harry said gently.
Blinking rapidly as he gathered his bearings and watched Pansy step out from where she’d evidently been leaning against the brick wall, Harry raised an awkward hand. “Er, Pansy, hi.”
Panicked for a reason he couldn’t quite place, Harry stammered out something that sounded like
Prongs carved from ice and snow stood shimmering in the low light and Harry smiled as he took in his handiwork, Teddy now talking with Nick in quiet tones as Harry moved closer to Draco.
“The prosecutor calls our first witness to the stand.”
“And you know that I won’t be getting a divorce,” Draco said, his tone almost a challenge.
The next hour was spent dodging glares from Pansy as she stuck by Draco’s side and together they avoided all of his attempts at conversation. He only managed to occupy the same room as them for half a minute at most, and even that was only because Neville had accidentally spelled the kitchen door closed from the inside for a short while. This meant that Harry barely got a word in with Dean either—he was tailing Pansy like a lost puppy, which would have been sweet under any other circumstances—and all in all Harry was not enjoying how this Christmas night was shaping up.
Astoria’s voice came from closer beside him than he previously recalled. “Narcissa likes to decorate. I think it helps keep her focussed, keeps her calm. This will likely be her last year visiting here, so she’s rather outdone herself.”
Harry shifted awkwardly under their gazes and felt just how much sweat he was producing, the crewneck he’d pulled off the floor earlier now uncomfortably stuck to his torso. Sitting up slower this time, Harry rested his back against the pillows and adjusted the wet fabric around his neck while pointedly looking down at his trainers.
With a deafening crack in the small space, his house elf materialised in the doorway.
“Haaaarrrryyyyy!”
“I don’t know,” he said truthfully. “It doesn’t… They don’t matter. It doesn’t matter.”
“—you do deserve it, Draco, don’t you dare—”
Smiling gently, Hermione nodded. “I’m not telling you to decide anything today. In fact, please don’t decide anything today. You’re horrible for making rash decisions. Just think about what I said earlier, and remember that Arthur was just telling stories, okay?"
“—Harry, would you shut up for a moment please? I’m trying to ask you to marry me here.”
“Harry Potter!” The man shouted, sparks coming out of his wand as he flapped his arms around. “Surely you understand that something must be done about this Death Eater.” He spat onto the floor in front of him, seeming to vaguely aim for Malfoy but mostly just covering Harry’s shoes in saliva.
“You’re coming back?” Cursing inwardly at the excitement that had creeped into his voice, Harry sighed. “I mean, that must be nice for her.”
Pansy’s words echoed through his mind again as he stood, watching Malfoy stand vulnerably before him. “No. I meant what I said, it’s just been a long day. Christmas Eve and all. Come inside for a drink?”
“Yes, Chelsea?” Harry turned to see the young assistant looking between him and Seamus, an amused expression on her face.
“Usually you just use your wand,” Harry pointed out. “I didn’t realise you’d be standing to make it.”
Snapped out of his thoughts, Harry blinked rapidly as he tried to make sense of Hermione’s words. “What?”
The fact that he was here tonight, in a set of dress robes he’d let Ginny pick out and making small talk with various heads of department was not lost on him. In taking time to learn what he wanted to do with his life, finding his feet in the new venture and ultimately needing to schmooze the who’s who of the Ministry, Harry had come full circle.
“Alright. Let’s look at those diagnostics again, shall we?”
“The usual,” Draco drawled with a fond roll of his eyes. “Some of us are watching our figures.”
He was still pacing like a caged animal when Ginny came through the front door some time later. Plastering what he hoped was a calm expression on his face he walked to the hallway to greet her and was met by her expectant gaze.
“Sorry to interrupt,” she said, stepping into the room and holding out a Christmas cracker to the two of them. “But I thought you might like to share one of these before Harry leaves for the Burrow.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry!”
“And you didn’t think to tell me?”
“Right now I don’t have to do anything,” he said, cutting Hermione off as he raised his spare hand at her. “If that changes, yeah, maybe, but not now. Narcissa’s really sick and he’s spending more time over there with her every month. I barely see him, and we’re keeping things secret while he’s still with Astoria. Honestly ‘Mione, right now we’re just two friends who have sex sometimes.”

Harry gulped nervously, hating the way she wouldn’t meet his eyes now. He had done this to them. “What do you want to—what should we do?”
“How’s Hestia?”
He was brushing his teeth later that night when the pain struck him again. Harry knew he couldn’t ignore this much longer, with the amount of anxiety and fear that rose in his mind each time he felt the stabbing feeling in his chest. Bracing himself with both hands on the sink in front of him, Harry raised his eyes to look at his reflection in the mirror. His pupils were dilated and where his toothbrush stuck out of his lips pressed tightly together he could see some foam residue from the toothpaste. Trying to focus on the image looking back at him instead of the pain that was eating him from the inside out, his eyes followed the line of stubble-bordering-on-scruffy-beard along his clenched jawline down to his shoulders that were rising and falling far too quickly as he hyperventilated.
They both laughed at that, something Harry didn’t understand passing between their gazes.
“Scorpius did.”
Harry knew what this meant, of course. He should be happy, should be over the moon at the fact that what Astoria said was untrue and there was no more fear of Harry’s presence causing issues. Something didn’t sit right though, and he wondered if Draco was being entirely truthful.
“We’ll have him drinking cocoa before the morning’s out,” Harry said, laughing as he saw Draco sighing and shaking his head across the table. “But bring him the horrible dark drink before he changes his mind and leaves, would you?”
“I’ve heard of them,” said Ron. “Oi! Do you reckon this means—“
“It would hardly be proper, Harry.” Astoria’s voice was soft, her gentle smile seeming almost genuine now. “Though I daresay Draco’s parents already know of his preferences.”
Shaking his head at the barrage of thoughts that threatened to drive him insane, Harry grabbed parchment from the drawer and a self inking quill from atop the desk and began to scrawl a quick congratulatory note.
The git was laughing now, having smacked Draco across the back of his head before leaning on his knees to snicker. “That’s not what I mean and you know it.”
“What do you want me to do about it?” Harry asked in a small voice. It was starting to make sense to him the more he sat with it. The more he thought on it, the more he considered Malfoy in those
“I know why everyone was staring now,” Albus said as he cut into his chicken pie. “When we left for Hogwarts, I mean.”
“I didn’t say that. I deserve more than a man in love with someone else—no, let me finish. I’m not about to let our children grow up unhappy, Harry. Part of that is showing them how love works, and I think we’re going to be better as friends when we figure all of this out. Stop that!”

She seemed rather excited about his low chance of survival.
“Whichever can come at such short notice,” Narcissa murmured in response to his uncharacteristic indecision. “We cannot miss our pre-arranged departure time at the apparation point. You know how strict the Ministry is about international apparation.”

“Sorry,” Harry murmured, pulling himself away from the blushing thirteen year old girl even as the twin’s demands went unanswered and the platform disappeared completely from view. Letting out a huff the twins pulled the window closed with a loud bang and stormed off to find out what their group of friends knew. “Let's go and find a compartment, guys.”
He turned around, his eyes seeking out the pin attached to the other boy’s uniform; judging by the fact that Javier’s badge was a deep blue colour with a dozen silver stars surrounding a crescent moon Harry felt secure in assuming that they weren’t in the same house at school.
Originally he'd intended to lounge about the Gryffindor common room until breakfast but he found himself struck by a need to be outside and so, making his silently through the deserted castle, he slipped out of the nearest entrance into the courtyard. From there his feet took him on a meandering walk around the lake, past the

Harry didn’t have time to gossip with the overly friendly portrait tonight.

Obviously they were something of a big deal amongst the student body.
Currently it was too much of a jumble; fear, anger, anxiety, bitterness…not to mention the unfamiliar yearning sensation he felt whenever he’d been in the presense of Draco Malfoy.
Draco snorted, waving his wand over the circles of parchment and watching as the rose into the air performing odd little spinning motions as they folded like a circular concertina, creating rigid folds and an almost deadly point. The wider part where the outer edge of the circle had ended up gathered was quickly secured with thin ribbons in their house colours.

Out of the corner of his eye Harry registered Draco taking a seemingly involuntary step backwards in response to the teachers sudden appearance, his right hand moving to take hold of his wand where it was tucked into the inside pocket of his smart jacket. His expression was one of concern, of wariness. That was odd… “Your champion can’t go anywhere. He’s got to compete. They’ve all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Bit convenient, eh?”
“5:45.”
“I can certainly see why we're trying to keep them alive,” Fleur sneered, refusing to go anywhere near the creature she'd been given as Dean began making his way back towards the castle in order to visit the Hospital Wing, the burn on his hand rather alarming in both size and severity. “Who wouldn't want pets that can burn, sting and bite all at once?”
A flash of white-blonde hair prompted Harry to hiss sharply, abandoning his attempt to close the door and leaving it open a crack as he hurried to take the seat beside Hermione.
“The first task is designed to test your daring,” the Minister of Magic announced after a couple of false starts. He looked, well, ill if Draco were being bluntly honest; his skin was ashen and wrinkled, his hair was limp and there were large black bags underneath his dull eyes. “So we aren’t going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the unknown quality in any wizard…very important…” He trailed off for a moment, his eyes glistening strangely as he looked at each of the champions in turn. “The first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in front of the other students and the panel of judges. The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the
Harry smiled to himself as he slipped into one the seats left available in the tiered seating along the wall nearest the door, finding himself next to Seamus. He'd been so worried about his friends would react, had put off telling them so many times, and now he could help but wonder why? Why had he been so afraid to tell them when they had reacted precisely the way he had both hope and expected them to; Ron, blustering but understanding, Hermione, relying on her knowledge but also understanding. Why had he been so worried?
Kreacher bowed low once more, locket shaking as he shivered with anticipation. “Master wants Kreacher to be keeping secrets from the Muggle-born,” he muttered as he resumed his standing position. “Kreacher has never been told to do this before, Kreacher will be retrieving the potion now!”
“It was,” Harry said as he laughed at her scrunched up face. “What else are we going to do?”
“I’ll tell you more about it when we get home,” Hermione said as she slipped the pamphlet into her beaded bag. “I might even bring it up in our Ministry meetings tomorrow, if anyone with their head screwed on is around.”
“Ah.” She pursed her lips, hesitating. “I’m not sure that’s my place to say, Potter. It holds a certain… Sentimental value for Draco. You’ll have to ask him for more than that, I’m afraid.”
Ron gave Harry a nervous smile and shrugged, clearly glad that the air around them was moving freer now. He stepped forward to embrace Hermione and mouthed an apology at Harry over her shoulder before gesturing towards the floo exits. “I’ll let you deal with that, then. I’m headed home. Don’t forget lunch tomorrow!”
Harry laughed beside him—he was Harry now, of course he was, though Draco would never say it aloud—as he reclined in the seat and turned to look at the players flying around the pitch, getting in their last flight before the Easter holidays. “Nothing that horrible happened here, did it? Aside from the Dementors, I guess.” Sneaking a sideways look at Draco, Harry elbowed his ribs. “Which I think I have you to blame for.”
With a growl, Harry cut him off. “Merlin, do you know what it’s been like for me? You ignore me for years, keeping communication to the absolute bare minimum, and then out of fucking nowhere,” he said, hands tearing at his hair as he began to pace. “You tell me you’re getting a divorce at some point in the future, but you don’t know when! And you can’t talk to me anyway, and then you finally get your divorce and just… Don’t tell me because you are stupid enough to think that me respecting your wishes to not communicate is me no longer being interested?” Stopping to turn and look at Draco, Harry sighed, shoulders slumping. “I bloody wish I wasn’t interested, Draco, because you’ve been a right piece of work for years now.”
come out of the blonde’s mouth.
The break in her wavering voice was too much for him and he met her gaze, seeing watery eyes full of fear.
It couldn’t be…
As he pulled his legs into a pair of dark jeans Harry caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror and winced slightly, hating that even Wideye couldn’t do anything for the dark circles under his eyes and gaunt hollows of his cheeks. Perhaps he’d try his hand at glamours again; they couldn’t do much for his skeleton-like appearance, but at least he might looked well-rested. He grabbed his wand from where he’d left it on the bed and focused on his reflection in the mirror, whispering the words he’d grown so dependent on these past few weeks.
The war was over. The war was lost, but it was over. And by this point in his life Draco honestly had little emotional energy to spare over the outcome. Yes, he was in a cell. But had his side won he would have continued to live with the Dark Lord and fear for his family, his own future. There was no positive to either of those situations and he was angrier with himself for feeling relieved than he was with the fact that his efforts were for nothing. He had been raised to believe so many truths but after so much time spent being forced to obey, Draco couldn’t bring himself to care about anything more than survival. That’s what this cell was for him. Guaranteed survival. As long as he continued to view it as such, he could pretend he wasn’t happy about the way things had turned. Glad to have seen the downfall of the movement he had fought so desperately to save.
Confused but light spirited he made his way down the hall, collecting his coat and gloves from the rack before stepping out into the frosty air. It seemed the Christmas spirit could melt even the coldest of hearts, he mused. Unable to make heads or tails of the situation but unsure how much he cared, he spent the short walk to his front door with a spring in his step and a smile on his face.
Harry gulped. “I, er, might have told her I would tell her if it happened. I didn’t know you were going to ask her.”
“What’s going on?”
“—and look how you’ve turned out,” Draco muttered as he rolled his eyes. “Oh well, if it gives you some peace of mind and buys us a few more minutes outside, who am I to complain?”
Laughing, Draco shook his head. “Aside from the obvious. We were talking about how it would impact the children. You said you couldn’t see what the fuss was about anyway, it wasn’t like we were eloping or causing a scandal.”
"Merlin. That's not..."
Giving himself another once-over in the mirror, Harry turned and walked back into his bedroom and sat on the edge of his four poster bed while he waited. After another minute or so, another loud noise announced Kreacher’s return.
Leading the way with a backwards glance that screamed
Blue eyes met green in silent challenge as they stood side by side in front of the cloudy mirror in the once-again flooded bathroom.
She stopped when they got to the outer edges of the garden, close enough to the house to feel comforting but far enough away that prying eyes and curious ears wouldn’t trouble them. After casting a quick
“Doing what?”
“This? Are you bloody—Harry, there is no this.” Draco sat back down to lean across the table and whispered his outrage. “There is no this, you understand? You’re having your midlife crisis two decades too early and I’m not about to ruin my life just because you’re determined to ruin yours. You’re, what, basing this off a comment that my wife made many years ago when we were both very different people.”
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t give you a chance sooner, I’m sorry I’ve been a bloody idiot.”
Harry swallowed nervously, words of decades ago ringing in his ears and glass smashing in his minds eye. "Yeah. Yeah, I have."
Turning to look at James, Harry was slightly wary of the mischievous look on his son’s face but could see no reason not to let them go. “Er, sure thing. Head to sleep soon though, alright?”
Malfoy sighed, the moment he gave in apparent across his features. “She’s hardly the mail owl I had in mind.”
“So why a kneazle?”
“Fascinating magic, aren’t they? Quite the spectacle.”
“They care about you. They would want to know. From someone who’s seen too many families breakdown because they had no idea someone was suffering… Just consider it.”
What a strange turn of events, Harry thought. Definitely worth being late back to training.
Once the children were behaving to at least an acceptable degree—“
“What’s wrong? Do you hurt?”
and Harry was finally sitting across from Ron at the Burrow, filling him in on the visit over some Butterbeers.
There was a sigh as he vaguely registered Ginny gathering the last of the dishes in front him. “I can’t help if you don’t tell me how to, you know.”
“Of course,” Harry said as he turned to see James half asleep in her arms. Overwhelmed with emotion, he beamed at her and wiped his eyes before he let any tears fall. “I’ll grab the bags and meet you by the fire.”
With that she was gone, leaving Harry and Draco alone and though they were half a room apart, Harry felt as if the space between them was rapidly narrowing.
“Yes, well. That had never stopped you before.”
Harry let out a sigh which quickly became a yawn and he gave in to it, finally making his way back to where the undersheets were exposed and collapsing once again into his bed. As he pulled the covers back over himself he felt the rage begin to boil under the surface once more—apparently unhappy with his lack of movement that had been keeping it at bay—but refused to do anything more than sleep at this point. He pressed his face into the pillow to muffle a groan as he thought about his early start tomorrow; inevitably Hermione would yet again know that he was up most of the night despite spending the evening in St Mungo’s and lecture him about the importance of proper sleep hygiene.
“I guess what I’m trying to say is… This whole year. This thing with us. I wouldn’t have made it through without you, y’know? Maybe it was all about your pain and my pain, everyone’s pain I guess. We were just holding onto all of it. But now it’s not about the pain any more, is it?” Eyes dropping, Harry bit gently on his lower lip and lowered his voice. He seemed less sure of himself, more like the child Draco had once met. “Is it? It’s not for me.”
“What do you mean?”
Head and heart full of love and longing, Draco did his best to ignore the tainted vines threatening to wind their way inside his happy childhood sanctuary. His body settled slowly as the shaking ceased, breathing finally evening out as he drifted off to sleep once more.
“Still hungry? We could stop on the way back.”
“I do?”
She smiled sadly and her shoulders slumped. “I know. But it’s not every day you testify to save someone’s life for the second time.”
“I thought you’d be the kind to do something sappy, like marry for love.”
“We do?”
“Good.” With that, Malfoy gave Harry a curt nod and an uncertain grimace that could almost have been mistaken for an attempt at a smile, before turning on his heel and disappearing with the rest of the Diagon Alley population.
It was the way Draco trembled slightly in his arms that gave away how important he considered today, a few warm breaths rustling through Harry’s hair at an uneven pace. Feeling Draco slowly relax into him, Harry held him tighter with a proud smile into his chest.
He looked down to the stone floor under his lightly-clad feet and sighed. The sparse rays of light highlighted how filthy it was in less-travelled corners but also how worn down the vast majority was, and he loathed to think of how he would be inevitably pacing within a few weeks. It was a shock to his system to be alone in an unfamiliar place after weeks of supervision prior to being sentenced. He hated it, all of it. The unjustness of his situation, the choices he’d had to make, the fact that he was living in a cell and the fact that he had no escape. What Draco truly hated most was the fact that in a place so full of misery and darkness, he felt lighter than he had in years. And more than anything, he hated admitting that, even just to himself.
“Life’s been much the same as always. Disappointing my parents and wondering why I tolerate you.”
“Shut it,” warned Ginny. “You did the same in your first year.”
Shocked by the raw sincerity behind Draco’s response, Harry paused for a moment as he watched Draco’s eyes meet his briefly before dropping to stare at his feet.
“It doesn’t look fine. Did you do something to hurt it?”
Tonight had started out no different to any other before it. It was a long walk up from the dungeons but Draco relished in the thought of moving his legs these days; staying in one place for too long made him antsy and he didn’t have the patience to deal with himself when he was more often than not his only company. Portraits stirred as he passed—though the final battle was months behind them, the anticipatory tension never seemed to leave their frames—but none seemed to rouse fully until he got closer to where someone seemed to be pacing back and forth at the base of the stairs ahead. Draco paused, hiding in the shadows beside a suit of armour before realising who he was watching. Did Potter really have to occupy every one of his waking hours?
“Bit late now,” Ginny muttered as she fussed about with the sugars. “It would just be nice in future if you could be more concerned for me.”
Because he features,
Taking a deep breath Harry steeled himself, opening his eyes. “Sorry, yeah. Er.” He paused. “Where was I?”
“You’re busy. I know. But you also don’t want to see me.”
“Harry… What if we stayed like this?”
If he was being honest with himself—which he was trying very hard not to be right now—the robes he had been given upon arrival weren’t in a much better state, or the thin underclothes that now covered him. There was a draft coming in from gaps in the stone that were too thin to see but clearly wide enough to chill him to his bones, and with the flimsy pieces of material he was allowed in here he didn’t even know if he’d make it one night without catching a head cold. Draco wondered if they’d administer Pepper-Up for it. It was known that Azkaban had no healers. They’d sooner let everyone rot away to nothing in here than take away the precious resources needed at St Mungo’s and the like.
“Yes, Hermione told me that you spent the last minute talking about how much you simply
Rolling her eyes, Hermione shook her head and then began making her way towards the Atrium exits so they could apparate back to Grimmauld Place. Harry sighed before following her lead, secretly grateful to Hermione’s lapse in judgement because really, nobody made pies quite like Kreacher.
was his eyes lit up when he smiled… Even the fire in his eyes when they argued… Well, bugger.
Taking in the meaning behind Draco’s words, Harry felt the bile rising in his throat at the thought of what the media was likely to say if anyone caught wind of them together. No matter how innocent their intentions… Merlin, even being photographed together tonight would be less than ideal if that were truly the case. Harry knew that no matter how much they might want to take the plunge right now, there was too much weight behind Draco’s train of thought, too much truth in the fear. It would take a lot more than one night in the snow to change his stance, or the world’s for that matter. If it were just the two of them at stake, perhaps, but there was more to consider here. Their children would always come first, he knew that better than anyone.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, you are here today before the Council of Magical Law accused with the crimes of following He Who Must Not Be Named and taking the Dark Mark. You are further accused of housing him and his Death Eaters in the Malfoy Manor, keeping prisoners in the cellars, torturing muggles, allowing Death Eaters into Hogwarts during your time there as a student and fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts, seeking to bring Harry Potter to He Who Must Not Be Named.”
sorry, I’ve forgotten the rest.” Potter looked nervous as he waited, nibbling on his lower lip.
“Nothing isn’t the end of the world,” Harry remarked scornfully. “A lot of people were left with nothing after Voldemort. And I had nothing as a child, didn’t I?”
It should have come as no surprise that after excusing his tardiness with an offhand comment about
“Great, thanks mate! See you next week, yeah?”
“He does not. Now come outside with me, please, before you do something stupid?”
“I feel that you’re insinuating I do nothing of importance with my time, Potter.”
It was a miracle, really, how everything had turned out. He hadn't honestly expected to make it this far. If the war didn't kill him he was sure the Dark Lord would have. Or the angry mobs who wanted every Death Eater’s head on a stake after the losses their side had suffered. He understood completely. It was difficult to admit but by the end of it he was so incredibly hopeful that stupid Potter would make it happen. That he would defeat the Dark Lord and Draco wouldn't have to live under his thumb anymore. He daren't speak these thoughts to anyone, not even his mother, for he knew exactly how awful they were. He had been raised on the side of the pureblood army and it had been drilled into him from such a young age: anyone not of pure wizarding descent is inferior and must be treated as such, or disposed of. He believed it wholeheartedly. He lived, breathed, ate, drank, slept, woke, a servant of this belief.
“Thanks, Kreacher.”
announcement or worse, the box of letters he’d been stupid enough to keep. The sky grew dark outside as he stared into the flames, head stuck on an endless loop of
A familiar laugh sounded behind him before Scorpius broke free of Albus’ arm, running over to wrap his arms around Astoria. “Mother, you’re here!”
Draco’s raised eyebrow was punctuated with a glare, even as his voice trembled. “Forgive me if I’m wrong, Potter, but isn’t this one about me? You did almost kill me, after all.”
Ron snorted to her left, and Harry felt Draco relax slightly, shoulders dropping as he picked up his glass with shaky hands and took a drink.
“Did Scorpius say anything else at all?” Harry asked, trying to sound nonchalant as Ginny stifled a laugh behind her drink.
“Wouldn’t think of missing it,” Harry called over his shoulder as he manoeuvred between the stacked boxes, grinning from ear to ear.
chapter inspired by
“Merry Christmas, Potter.”
“You’re sure?” The words were barely a whisper, Draco hardly daring to believe this was real.
And now he was meant to be happy. He was supposed to be showing up day in and day out at the Ministry to boost public morale and remind the world that it was all over and he was sick of it. He felt like Scrimgeour was running the place again; he was being used as a puppet, and he didn’t even know who was pulling the strings. All Harry knew was that he was burning out really fast, and he wasn’t sure how long he had left before it was all too much.
“Two years ago, if I’m not mistaken. Have you made any contact at all?”
Tuning out conversation
Malfoy’s green coat—while in part to blame for camouflaging him behind the tree moments ago—was a stark contrast to the white snow that covered the ground between them. He wore dark jeans with what appeared to be a Slytherin scarf, looking every bit the prat Harry remembered from school. His features held their familiar angular quality yet were slightly softened around the edges, reminding him of their last encounter. The particularly notable difference seemed to be his expression; while it was cautious, the sneer Harry had seen so frequently seemed to have disappeared replaced with something less repulsive, less judgemental. It was a nice look on him, if Harry were being honest.
Snorting, Harry looked up from where Draco was taking his rook. “
“Are you happy to be back?”
Malfoy groaned, head falling into his hands. “I hate dating.”
“I don’t know what I want.”
“Don’t tell me you wouldn’t do the same if you knew you’d get away with it. You, who even now is suspicious of my motives?”
Locking eyes with the cracked corner of the tile once more, Harry played with the end of his robe sleeve as he thought about how to respond. He had hoped, stupidly, that maybe he could get away without talking about what had happened that morning. She was right of course—Hermione always was—but that didn’t make it any easier to talk about. The truth was Harry hadn’t even had the time to process how he felt or what had even been said in the court room. The past weeks had all been such a blur and though he’d been present for many trials, even spoken at a few, this was the first where Harry had felt the need to really defend the person in the chair.
they! are! finally! talking! about! feelings! (kinda)
He nodded, plastering a smile on his face and shrugging. “Here’s hoping the little Malfoy’s not as much of a prat as his father.”
He nodded, then flinch as he heard a crash from presumably the liquor cabinet in the other room. Stepping out of the way to watch an unopened bottle fly to Ginny’s expectant hand, Harry gave a hollow chuckle.
They’d had a slight argument a few days prior, though Harry still couldn’t entirely understand how it had come about. After a perfectly pleasant afternoon spent with Teddy and Andromeda, Draco had joined Harry for a drink at his home up the street. Two glasses of wine in and suddenly Draco was sullen and tight-lipped, nothing like the man he'd grown to know and everything like the boy Harry had seen immediately after the war. It had come out of nowhere, that was the worst part; try as he might, Harry could not connect his abrupt change in behaviour with anything the conversation had touched on. Work…Quidditch…Their respective friends…Merlin, they’d even managed to laugh about some of the things they’d put each other through in school. It seemed like Draco’s mood had come about when Harry had mentioned his new fiancee, though Astoria had come up many a time during their weekend coffees throughout the year without any mood swings he could recall. He’d only been asking if there was a set date for the wedding yet. He and Ginny had decided on April, with the invitations about to be sent the very next day.
Trying to hide his smile as he heard the familiar words fall from Harry’s mouth once more, Draco simply nodded in response. Somehow in the few months since that fateful meeting by the Astronomy Tower they had fallen into step, and this practice was becoming infinitely easier with a partner.
With a sigh he lay back on his bed once more and rubbed a hand over his eyes. Was it too much to ask for one day that vaguely resembled normalcy? Despite pushing three days without sleep at this point Harry felt sick at the thought of succumbing to his exhaustion; Hermione had finally stopped checking at his door each night or giving him more than a casual glance when he did give in to his nighttime wanderings and he suspected the visit to St. Mungo’s last week was to thank for that. It hadn’t put an end to the nightmares or his aversion to closing his eyes for more than the time it took to blink. Instead it had simply made him fight harder against the needs of his body and when he wasn’t in a perpetual state of exhaustion he was channeling all of his energy into grieving the life he had never known.
“It’s Malfoy!” Harry snapped, irritated that his friends were ignoring his point of view. “You believe me, don’t you, Ron?”
Pulling back lest he get swept away in a lustful haze of avoidance, Harry took a moment to breathe, feeling his restraint waver at the sight of dishevelled Draco that stood before him. Looking equally as out of breath and off-kilter as Harry felt, Draco gave a shaky smile before clearing his throat.
The answering glare he got was enough to have him keeping a cautious eye on Ginny’s wand hand as he grimaced, mouthing an apology as he watched her uncork it and pour without taking her eyes away from his. She was an impressive woman, fierce and unapologetically true to herself in all that she did. His heart ached for her right now, no matter how much she insisted they were equals in their decisions. Of the two of them, he was the oblivious idiot and an absolute prick for this.
The hesitation in his step was so imperceptible Harry wondered if he’d imagined it. “I can’t stay. Cillor will show you out if you’d prefer not to floo.”
“What did you do to Malfoy?” She whispered, waving Molly away from where she was hovering in the hallway as she raised her voice. “You can have him in a minute mum, he’s got some explaining to do right now.”
“I knew.”
Harry
She blinked quickly a few times and Harry could see that her eyes were starting to glisten. “Alright. Well, I’ve done my waiting Harry. I can’t do this anymore. You’re so different than you were and I don’t know if you’re going to get through this and be someone that I don’t recognise at all. You might never want me, and I can’t wait around to find out.”
Teddy wanted to hear stories about the marauders again, of course, and Harry obliged. Moony, Padfoot and Prongs were regular features in the tales he’d told Teddy growing up, and tonight seemed to be bringing about some nostalgia in them all. His eyes met Draco’s every now and then, a depth of emotion in them that had his heart aching. He vowed to do this every year, and said as much in perhaps not so many words.
“Oh! Yeah, Ginny’s great. I’m actually, er… Well, I’m planning on proposing in the New Year.”
“Er, right. It’s just, well, you remember that night at the pub.” At Draco’s nod, he continued. “You left quite suddenly, and seemed a bit… Different, I guess. Afterwards. In your letters.”
“No?” Draco threw his hands up, exasperated. “Then what’s this?”
Straightening up for where he’d been leaning against the stair rail, Malfoy cleared his throat. “Yes? I mean, yes. I came to talk?”
… If he had been speaking Mermish through a straw above water.
Draco looked away, scared of what he might reveal if he stayed the focus of Harry’s eager expression. “Yeah, I guess we can be friends out here.”
Launching into a detailed explanation complete with wild hand gestures and excited-if-slightly-maniacal eyes, Hermione compared Wideye and Dreamless Sleep to muggle drugs that Harry had heard about with their depressant and stimulant qualities.
Draco laughed. “I think we’ve spent a lot of our lives ignoring the consequences, actually. That’s the whole problem.”
, come say hi!
that Percy would have something to say when he noticed the new addition to the dining table.
Catching his movement, Astoria chuckled softly. “He won’t come over here, trust me.”
“This would all be solved if you just told the world you didn’t want a
There was a stunned silence between them as Harry took in what he’d just said. It wasn’t necessarily untrue, just something he didn’t think he would ever find himself discussing with Draco Malfoy in a London cafe. Chancing a glance at where Draco sat across the table he found the other man staring wide eyed into his lap.
“I thought you liked my hair,” Harry said, pouting but not really. Draco flicked his nose in response.
Harry woke in a haze of confusion to someone shaking him. The first thought his brain supplied was
“Well, Mr Potter,” she said, seating herself in a conjured chair beside his bed as if he hadn’t said anything, “I had hoped the Hospital Wing would be seeing less of you, this year.”
“Before the First Years enter for their sorting, I would like everyone to observe a moment of silence in remembrance of the lives that were lost here and around Britain last year, muggle and magical alike.” The Headmistress’ voice was hard, as if daring anyone to argue. No one did, though. Everyone was silent, even the Slytherins.
Harry looked down at his timetable as she walked away. It was, quite frankly, the most packed timetable he had ever seen. He glanced over at Draco’s – it was emptier. He had some time slots free. Pansy’s seemed more similar to Harry’s, packed full from breakfast to dinner, and sometimes after, too.
Harry exchanged a bemused look with Draco, who pulled him closer to lean against his side. It was strange to think of the bonds that had forged, in the Days Before. In another context, perhaps, it could have been comforting – but how many nightmares did these children have? How many scars, how much fear?
“What did he get probation for, Hermione? Torture? Hurting people? Using Unforgivables? We did that too, in case you forgot. Or I did, at the very least. We’re two sides of the same coin, Draco and I.”
“Fine,” groused Draco as he sat back down on the bed. Harry looked at him in concern, he was picking at his sleeve on his left arm – right where the Dark Mark sat on his skin.
Harry was so surprised he sat bolt upright in the bed. “That ended horribly last time,” Harry said. “Are you mad?”
The plan was accepted as the best one they had, although Harry knew it wasn’t, not completely. It wasn’t, because nearby, at the foot of his four-poster bed was his trunk. And inside his trunk was his invisibility cloak.
He felt like crying, suddenly. Harry took a few deep breaths, trying to calm himself, trying to keep his mind in his body and his eyes present on the clean-up he was doing. “They haven’t tried, though,” he said once he had gathered himself. “It took you one day to find me. And listen. They’ve – I mean, we’ve talked a bit. But they haven’t listened. They haven’t sought me out.”
Harry swung Teddy up and into his arms. “Let’s go, Teds. If we spend much more time out here Andy will throw a fit.”
Harry nuzzled his neck. “They don’t know I’m out yet,” he said, revelling in the noise Draco made when he bit the tender skin by his Adam’s apple.
Harry felt another pang of… not sadness, not really – something worse. That feeling as if his heart was breaking despite already being so broken that it couldn’t possibly break anymore. “I’ll still have weekends, yeah?” he said, leaning into Draco slightly.
Food had appeared on their plates as the sorting finished. Harry picked at it, more focussed on Teddy than anything. He let the conversation of the Slytehrins ebb around him, content to just sit and not think for a moment.
“That’ll be Teddy,” she said, releasing him with a look of fond exasperation. “Why don’t you go get him and I’ll make us some tea?”
“They’re probably your Gryffindor’s, anyway,” Blaise said when Harry turned a pleading look on him. Since it was clear that no one else was going to help him, Harry hauled himself up with a sigh, careful not to touch any of his papers strewn over the bed.
The first, that going back to Draco Malfoy’s rooms was probably a terrible, terrible decision.
“You wait,” said Andromeda, prompting another sigh from Harry. “You let them know you’re there for them, then you give them space and you wait.”
Blaise ushered Harry and Pansy out of the door, making them swear they would retell every moment when they were all at dinner. Pansy and Harry walked in silence, at first, which Harry didn’t mind. He imagined Pansy was working out what she would say, and he was always content to be left with his thoughts in the Days After.
His question was vague, but Malfoy seemed to understand. He gestured for Harry’s cigarette, and spoke only after taking a deep drag and handing it back.
They actually made it to lunch without being accosted by a single Slytherin first year. The first years had spent most of the previous day shadowing them, and even Pansy had noted that it felt strange that morning when not a single one approached.
“Thanks,” he rolled his eyes. Tucking the parchment and quill into his pocket, he allowed her to lead him into the Common Room and into the corridor, the entryway grinding closed behind them.
“What’s wrong with liking other girls?” Mar asked, scrunching her face again.
“It was front page,” Harry said. “I only saw the headline. The Wizengamot passed a motion to track former Death Eaters.” He winced, almost, waiting for the exclamation of horror or anger but none came.
Draco’s laughter followed them out of his room and toward the eighth year common room. Harry privately thought he had never heard a better sound.
Perhaps we still have much to discuss before we could ever truly be friends. This I understand, and I hope you will too. Of course, you have no reason to speak to me as a friend and I will not be upset should you even go as far to discard this letter without reading it.
“Alright,” he said gently. “Well, the older students have a lot of studying to do. Would you be able to hunt for fish outside?”
“How’s working with Binns?” Ron asked, finally breaking the tension.
The two Gryffindors scrambled towards the door. In other circumstances, Draco would have laughed at the display, so cowardly for people who were considered so brave, but he just sagged down in relief as they left. Blaise moved, coming to sit beside him on Harry’s bed.
“I couldn’t do anything,” he mumbled into Draco’s lips, hardly aware of his words, burning with lust. “They would send me away, to someone else, who would say the same thing. Until,” he broke off with a hiss as Draco slid forward, straddling his hips again, rocking them carefully, once, against Harry. “Until I ended up at the veil. Bellatrix-” He felt Draco’s hands falter on his body momentarily, before they resumed their movement. “Bellatrix was hurting you and the others, and Ron and Hermione. It was like I had to
“I’m going to put him down and then I might go nap myself, if that’s alright. It’s been a long few weeks,” Ginny said with a yawn.
He felt the cold glass of another Firewhiskey nudging his hand and he gladly took it from her, enjoying the first cold sip. “Mmm. You know what I mean though.”
It wasn’t bending the rules of Transfiguration, per se, it was more of what he liked to call thinking outside of the box. He’d never been much for rules anyway, right? What he had in mind was slightly larger than a novelty snowman to make his daughter laugh, so the fact that it took five minutes worth of attempts was only mildly disheartening and more than worth it when the final product came to life.
“Sounds like another Malfoy child I once knew,” Harry teased. “He’ll be same year at Hogwarts as Albus, actually.”
“What?”
Draco snorted, shaking his head. “She knows who she married. Do you want a signed permission slip or something?
“Er…” Harry took a long drink from his glass before throwing caution to the wind. “Pansy told me to ask you about Secret Santa.”
Snow and cold kisses
“He’s already asleep, there’s not much I can mess up right?”
He thought instead to the roaring fire in the Slytherin common rooms. The times he had spent there unafraid before the Dark Lord’s return. Before the pride in his family name had died out. Back when he could use his status and power to command followers and ensnare friends. How simple it had all seemed.
“Yes, well.” She shot him a glance over her shoulder that he could only interpret as
“Can’t do that,” Harry said with a mouthful of cream and chocolate syrup. “‘M’an Auror.”
Malfoy’s brows disappeared into his hairline for a moment as he blinked rapidly for a moment, before turning to Harry with a furrowed brow. “Isn’t that a bit sudden?”
Two years ago to the day
“No, I just—” Hermione sighed, brushing her spare hand through her messy locks. “The Ministry’s a right piece of work sometimes, that’s all.”
“We can come back tomorrow night if you prefer. I don’t mind.”
Draco pulled back after a few moments, rolling his eyes at what he clearly deemed a sappy expression on Harry’s face. “Let’s get this blasted thing over with then.”
Ron snorted into his ale, setting off in a coughing fit and needing Hermione to slap his back a few times so he could breathe properly. Harry sighed, putting his head in his hands and leaning on the table with his elbows. He knew a lost cause when he saw one. He just hated that it was his friends taking Malfoy’s side.
Ginny simply glared at him from across the hallway as Luna gave him a warm embrace, welcoming him inside. He assumed they had decorated the place in advance as there was no way they could have decked out all of this glorious festivity in the ten minutes since he last saw them leaving the Burrow together.
Hardly daring to breathe, Harry wiped away the tears that threatened to spill and watched as Draco nodded, chewing on his lower lip in thought.
“What does that even mean, not right now?”
He saw the blissful smile and glazed eyes mirrored back to him on Draco’s face for a few precious moments before the other man blinked quickly, seeming to snap back to his thoughts.
“Master Harry does not usually ask Kreacher when he worries. Does Master Harry want Kreacher to find information for him?”
She had heard the nightmares. She should know that he wasn’t going to let himself sleep more than strictly necessary. It was exasperating, honestly, just how much his subconscious seemed determined to make him miserable. What was the point of celebrating the win if it didn’t really feel like a win at all?
“They’re used to us by now. You know it. Besides, they all started to like each other long before we did.”
“Stop defending him! All of you, I’m sick of it. Somethings going to happen at Christmas, just you wait and see.”
“I could ask you the same question.”
“Kreacher thinks that if master wants to be drinking so much of it, he should be keeping his rooms cleaner while he stays awake all night,” Kreacher muttered under his breath.
It did, and that was the problem. Her words were eerily similar to what he’d said to Draco earlier, but hearing it from Ginny made it all the more real for him. It was a lot for his head to take in, and he regarded his wife across the table as he took a sip and spluttered. It tasted like what he imagined muggle petroleum would taste like.
“Well, that went better than expected.”
“Ah,” Draco said, an air of understanding about him. “Yes, they are quite good for anonymity.”
Every fibre in his being wanted to scream
Where you stand out in the frost
“My dad said he killed—”
“You kissed?!” She shouted, quickly covering her mouth with her hands as she realised how loud her voice had been. “You kissed?” She repeated at a whisper. “Last night?”
What constituted a better time, he wondered? He lay there reminiscing on easier days when he was young and naive, determined to rule the world in the same way he’d always thought his father had. The lust and pull he’d felt to his childhood of late seemed to dull with every deeper inspection of the truth. Draco’s thoughts were being coloured anew and he wasn’t entirely certain he liked this process.
There was a contemplative silence for a few moments before they both spoke at once.
chapter inspired by
Unsure how true that statement was anymore, Draco cast his mind back to the months before Christmas. Harry was right. There was nobody left to impress, no barriers left to break.
Hot flames licking your embrace
Even now, laying in his bed at Grimmauld Place staring at the grubby ceiling above him his mind was racing a millions miles an hour. His entire body ached right to the core, with no logical explanation other than pure emotional exhaustion and many sleepless nights. Harry wasn’t entirely sure what he had expected after the war was over; truthfully, he’d never had the chance to think about its possibility. He definitely hadn’t spared a thought to think about all of the public appearances he’d be invited to make. No, if he’d ever actually taken a spare second to fantasise about a world without Voldemort, it seemed a lot more peaceful than the one he was now living in.
He gulped. “Yes?”
“Um.” He kicked himself inwardly. “Just once before. A few days ago. It’s nothing, really—”
“Shut it, Percy,” Ron warned.
In his haste to forget about the event before it had even begun, Harry had barely spared a thought for who would be in attendance. If he’d spared more than a single brain cell, it might have crossed his mind to consider the fact that Draco was employed to advise various Ministry departments—or he was, last Harry’d heard—and therefore chances of crossing paths tonight were high.
“Er…”
It was habit, more than anything, that drew Draco to seek out the Astronomy Tower night after night. That was what he told himself as his stomach dropped every time the final set of stairs came into view. Yet to make it up to the top, most hours of his early mornings were spent curled up on the first step thinking over what had led him to this point in his life.
“Would anybody like some tea? Or there’s some pumpkin juice, or I suppose we could start on the mulled wine you’re—”
Maybe the type of love he had once so struggled to understand was actually the love he’d felt all along.
“Okay, okay, no need to be so defensive. Only, I wouldn’t hate you if you did, you know.”
If nothing else, Harry knew he’d made for a night of prime entertainment for his ex-wife. Ginny was by his side tonight, both technically invited of their own accord but choosing to go together to save the hassle of finding dates or showing up alone; Ginny’s current girlfriend was off in Norway with her husband and their two sons, and Harry was exhausted by the thought of the press seeing him here with anyone else. They were enjoying a child-free night: Albus and Lily were with Molly for the night, with Harry planning to pick them both up before getting James from King’s Cross for the Christmas holidays.
“Cheers, Harry! You’re the best, you know that?”
She held his gaze a moment longer then sighed and looked away, her shoulders lowering slightly.
“You stayed with Ginevra almost two years after that day.” Draco’s voice was quiet, the uncertainty shining through in his tone. “Merlin, you had another bloody kid. I wondered if maybe—”
“Guess that’s something, at any rate.”
She looked him, pressing her lips together in a sad smile. “Malfoy’s probably not about to make any immediate decisions either.”
With a snort, Hermione shook her head. “The way some of the staff there fawned over you was, quite frankly, incredibly unprofessional and off-putting to say the least. It has made me realise the wizarding world severely lacks the support it needs particularly considering what we’ve just been through in recent years.”
Rewarded with a forgiving smile, Draco warmed as he watched Harry settle back against his seat before attempting to prove his point once more.
“Yes, I get your point.” Draco placed his mug back on the table, leaning forward on his elbows. “So you’ve realised it’s not what you had in mind. What’s the problem? It’s not so bad, is it?”
He stared blankly as Andromeda led the way back to the car Harry had driven them in, tuning out most of the chatter coming from beside him as he wondered what had kept the other man. Draco had said he would be there. Obviously he’d let Andromeda know he wasn’t coming or she’d have been more concerned, but that didn’t make Harry feel any better about his absence.
Harry shot her a bitter look. “You say that as if I should have known sooner.”
happy new year everyone! i hope 2021 is wonderful and kind to you all 🥰💖
Maybe he was giving too much thought to the words of a man who paid him no mind at all.
“Oh, that’s fine then.” Her voice was icy and dripping in sarcasm as she uncrossed her arms and began gesturing wildly. “Are you serious? I didn’t tell you to stop for no reason, Harry. I’m not trying to be a—I don’t know, buzzkill? But that will literally kill you. You don’t understand how bad it is to have day after day. You shouldn’t really have it more than five days out of every month and you,” Her eyes were affixed upon him now, intent with concern beneath the angry front, “Have had it at least five days this last week alone. I also know you started taking it shortly after that first night we stayed here.”
“I do,” Harry admitted, taking a tentative step forward and looking down as he gave Draco’s hand a squeeze. “But for some stupid reason, you’re all that I want. So if you can promise not to run away again, Draco, then I think we might be able to give this a try.”
“Harry!”
“I never thought you—”
Raising a curious brow, Draco waited for Harry to continue with the thought.
“Why not?” Draco exclaimed, throwing his hands up in exasperation. “Because we’re starting something we shouldn’t, that’s bloody why not.”
“No, no.” Malfoy brushed off Harry’s comment with a flippant wave of his hand. “The one you’re dating. Ginevra, isn’t it?”
“His decisions are not your fault, Harry.”
They both pulled on three, the resulting firework crackling in the air around them in vibrant blue and green hues. It took Harry a moment to stop watching as the coloured cloud settled. When he dropped his head back to meet Draco’s gaze he found the other man looking down at the torn cardboard in his hand, brow furrowed. Confused, he followed suit and saw that the cracker had somehow ripped into equal halves.
“I get it.” He paused. “Do you… Should I maybe not come over to see Ron for a bit?”
he thought, as chuckles and new names echoed through his mind.
Perhaps he should have had the foresight to realise that as Teddy’s cousin and one of the more prominent adults in his life, Draco was likely to also show up at the station. It wasn’t until Harry had tripped over his own feet at seeing the blonde leaning against the entrance that his brain caught up to the logic however, and he hurried to arrange his expression in such a way that didn’t convey both his shock and absolute thrill at seeing him there. Judging by the raised brow and subtle smirk in response, he had failed miserably.
“You really think that?” Ginny snorted, smacking the back of Harry’s head and causing him to groan. “Are you sure you’re not just projecting your childhood animosity onto what is genuine flirting, Harry?”
Pulling him in for a hug, Hermione rubbed his back as she whispered in his ear. “I’ll love you no matter what. You know that right?”
“So now he feels like he has to pay the price for the faults of his family, even though they’re not his faults entirely.” Hermione turned to him, placing a gentle hand on his forearm. “He doesn’t want Scorpius to have to deal with the same. I think he's scared that if people have anything bad to say about the Malfoy family—more than they already are—Scorpius will bear the brunt of that in school. Which isn't entirely true, but he's projecting his own childhood expectations onto his son.”
“As well as to be expected. Excited to be moving back to England in the Spring.”
“But you and Astoria aren’t, y’know.” He knew it was the wrong thing to say as soon as the words left his mouth.
“Kreacher—“
“We don’t really do that here, I’m afraid.”
“Relax, ‘Mione. It was a joke, you’re allowed to laugh.” Tipping his head back against the wall, he closed his eyes as he let out a long exhale. “You’re right though. I love their big family, I really do, but I can’t imagine raising one that size on my own.”
Particularly with his mind’s current offering - that Potter was the reason he had now twice evaded death this past month. This was definitely going to be a long sentence.
“Honestly, ‘Mione. After the day we’ve had…”
He sighed, ripping through the paper in the hopes that if he could get it over with quickly, maybe he’d be left alone long enough to slip away. As the wrapping fell away there was a gasp from Hermione to his left and he looked down at the silver blade in his hands, unsure of what was so special about it.
Fine.
“You are okay, aren’t you, Harry?” She pleaded, and Harry pressed his lips together, nodding mutely, not meeting her eyes. She pulled him into a fierce hug that ended as quickly as it started, and followed Luna and the others out of the front door. Draco strode out of the kitchen to lock the door behind them, then paused, his head resting against the doorframe, his mind spinning. He just kicked out the only friends he had for Harry Sodding Potter. He hoped that they understood; hell, even he didn’t understand his actions at the moment. Why did he feel so defensive about Harry? The last time Draco had even seen him in person was at the trials, and even then, they barely made eye contact, let alone had a conversation.
“You speak very well.” He blurted out, and Holly paused, looking back at him with a smile.
Three rounds of scones and one left to go, he turned up the muggle radio and began to get into the music. It was easy when he was alone to let go; a talent he learned after he disassociated himself from his parents and their pureblood ideologies. “Children were to be seen and not heard.” Well, Draco liked being heard, and he made sure to sing loudly in his own subtle defiance of his upbringing.
Tomorrow was going to be an interesting day, and with Harry by his side, he knew that no matter what happened, they would get through it together.
Malfoy had rhythm. He moved and swayed with the music; sometimes dipping down, sometimes moving his hands across his chest and legs, and always staring straight into the crowd, seeming to make eye contact with everyone there. There was a moment when, with a jolt, Harry thought Malfoy had caught his eye, but if there was any recognition, he didn’t give anything away. Harry’s heart was hammering in his chest, and the weird stirring in his stomach began moving a little further south as Malfoy continued to dance. The first song had changed to a faster song, and now Malfoy was just standing relatively still and stomping his feet, tossing his head from side to side and letting his long hair sweep across his face.
A moan from the bed caused Hermione to leap to her feet, eyes wide. Draco was beginning to stir, his fingers twitching on the sheet.
When Carl had approached him, stating his dancing was otherworldly and that he would love for Draco to be on his stage, it had given him such a high.
With a sigh, he decided to let Draco sleep. If he had fallen asleep in the short amount of time it took him to make a cup of tea, he obviously needed it. Pulling the sheet up around Draco’s shoulders, Harry tucked him in and left the room, feeling lost.
Ron stumbled in and plonked himself into a chair, muttering a “Thanks, mate,” as he downed his hangover potion. His face cleared as the potion worked it’s magic, and Harry decided to drop the bomb on him.
“That’s because you know me.” The explanation shocked Draco. “I could drop it as soon as I came through the door because that lady left and then it was just you and Luna. I don’t need to hide from you lot.”
“I truly am a master of flavors,” Draco declared, cutting another slice of lamb. “You’re going to need a journal for all of the advice I give you, Pasta. Mark my words.”
“Malfoy’s dancing was too intense.” Harry muttered under his breath, hoping Ginny wouldn’t hear.
In all honesty, Draco had, which was why he was thinking about how to make croissants and eggs at the cafe, but he wasn’t about to admit it to everyone. Admitting it to Harry was hard enough. “What do you mean, you knew?” He asked suspiciously, looking around the table. No one appeared to be surprised, and Draco placed a hand on Harry’s knee under the table and squeezed gently.
The stage.
“But nothing.” Draco interrupted firmly. “We don’t need to compare our traumas. Everyone experiences things differently, and I was forced into dealing with mine… thanks to the Ministry, my probation, and Luna.” Harry hung his head in defeat.
This chapter is a bit longer than the others, but I ended up stuffing a bunch in! I hope you all enjoy Harry and Draco's "Friend Things" in this chapter xD
“And er…” he stumbled, “what if you were to be… um, let go? If you’re given clothes already, then…”
“It’s good to see you, Harry,” she began, “We were beginning to worry that you didn’t…” Harry shook his head vehemently and stepped away from her embrace.
“So, what’s good here?” A strangely familiar voice came from the front of the store, and as Draco rounded the corner of the backroom, he came to a standstill. He took in the baggy muggle jeans paired with a loose hooded pullover, and then his silver eyes found the deep bottle green.
Draco popped the cork out of the bottle and sniffed it cautiously. It still smelled sweet, without any hint of spoiling. “I made this before the cafe even opened,” he said, mostly to himself. “Luna and I were experimenting with syrups, and she had mentioned seeing you, and I wanted to see if I could make something that you’d enjoy, if you ever came to the shop.” Tipping the container, he dripped the liquidy syrup onto his finger and placed it in his mouth. “It’s not bad.” He placed another drop onto his finger and offered it to Harry, who hesitated before darting out his tongue and licking the syrup.
“One month while he was conscious.” Blaise waved a hand. “You starred in his Hogwarts wank fantasies, and now that he has you, he’s going to get you out of his system and then go back to how he was before. Draco isn’t the white picket fence type, Potter. You ought to know that by now.”
“Does anyone have any idea what he got hit with?” She eyed the chart at the foot of Draco’s bed, wanting to look but knowing it was a medical violation. No matter how old she got, Hermione still followed the rules to the best of her abilities. Ron followed her line of sight and snatched the chart again, flipping quickly to the pages filled with his Healer’s chicken scratch.
A loud beeping caused them all to jump, and Draco swore and rushed back into the kitchen, pressing the flashing timer and flipping the mixer off. “Time for mix-ins!” Luna exclaimed, and the three others filed into the kitchen, first depositing their wands like the sign commanded.
“Stop it,” he chided himself, wrapping a towel firmly around his waist and swiping the condensation from the mirror, “Something like this was bound to happen. Draco didn’t make a big deal about it, you did. Stop your shit, get dressed, and go face the day.”
Without raising his eyes, Draco flinched, but nodded slowly. “I… remember that I had to keep it to myself, and I’m not sure of our relationship beyond ‘roommates’, so I just wanted to be clear on everything in case I overstepped my bounds.”
What I do is righteous, but I would never force myself on anyone, no matter what they did to me.
Sure, he and Luna co-owned the restaurant, but this was
“You do think you’re better than most people,” Harry pointed out.
The problem began when my assignment included Draco Malfoy.
“I checked out some books from the library!” Hermione waved her wand and a stack of heavy books landed neatly next to her. “I don’t mind doing some research. It’s been a while since I’ve read a good book.”
Draco sat down primly at the table, brushing invisible crumbs away. “If I was the one marinating the lamb, wouldn’t it make sense that I would be the one to cook it?”
stupid face I remember?”
Laughing, Draco rolled his eyes. “You’ll think it’s foolish. I think it’s foolish, and I’m the one thinking!”
“Yes,” Harry took a long swig of his purple drink, “We shall.”
He groped around for his glasses, only to remember that he had left them in Draco’s room. His stomach clenched as he thought of facing Draco, and tried to shake the feeling away. “It was an accident,” he told himself firmly, “Nothing bad happened, it’s just going to be a little awkward for a bit.”
Draco’s face flashed from surprise, to annoyance, to anger. “So we are dating?” he demanded, standing to face Harry. “Why wouldn’t you just tell me?”
“The things that Blaise was saying…” Draco coughed and flushed, looking away. “About me, and how I used to be… and about the things I used to do...”
Blaise downed his drink before sweeping past Harry to sit back down on the couch, one long leg draped carelessly over the other. “You just like to ruin things.”
The magic exploded out of Harry before he had a chance to reign it in. An antique dresser exploded, showering them with wooden splinters and what appeared to be the remnants of several fur coats. “The whole reason I like Draco is because he’s his own person!” He bit his lip hard enough to draw blood, and struggled with his magic again. “He’s snarky, sassy, and one hundred percent himself. I wouldn’t change that for the world.
His eyes fluttered closed and he shifted in the chair, crossing his long, elegant legs beneath him. I watched hungrily; it had been a long time since I had seen anyone - or anything - so beautiful. His platinum blonde locks had grown, and I longed to push a stray strand behind his ear, but I held back.
“They’re dry baking beans, to keep the crust from puffing up too much.” Draco laughed as he poured the dried beans in an even layer over the bottom of the dish. He slipped the dish into the oven and set a fifteen minute timer before grabbing his food processor and crumbling the toasted bread into it. “Homemade breadcrumbs are far superior,” he explained, raising his voice over the sound of pulverizing bread. “You can control how much or how little moisture is in the crumbs, so you can ensure the finished tart is as thick as you want it to be.” Abandoning the crumbs in the processor, he grabbed a sauce pan and threw it to the stove, lighting the cooktop with a long match.
He couldn’t tear his eyes away. Neither, it seemed, could anyone else.
The one who needs it the most.
“I invited Draco to move in with me.” He felt his face redden and he turned back to the stove, poking at the eggs he had just cracked into the pan. “He, uh, was talking last night about not wanting to go back to the Manor, and it kind of slipped out… but I thought about it and I think it would be good for him to move in here.” Maybe if he spoke fast enough, Ron wouldn’t have time to object.
“So I finally wised up to how bad my father really was,” he muttered, talking to himself.
“I… I don’t know what you mean.” That answered that question - so he would lie. Draco still had a chance.
Someone was screaming, and Draco felt like he was drowning, drowning…
“You’ve done plenty and enough,” a quiet voice made them both jump, and they looked up into Luna’s serene face. “You have nothing to prove to anyone, and anyone who is mean to you is not welcome in the cafe.” She sat down next to Harry, raising a hand to his short-cropped hair. “This doesn’t look comfortable,” she mused, “you should take it off. I can cast a notice-me-not if it makes you feel better.”
Draco found us as he was taking his nightly walk.
A small falter and Draco was back on his game, making a point not to glance towards where the man with green eyes was standing.
I may kill people, but I’m not a barbarian.
Luna didn’t make him feel that way, however. Luna’s friendship had come as a complete surprise. One day, he was window shopping in Hogsmeade, thinking about buying his mother some of the Chocoballs from Honeydukes she liked, and Luna had all but ran headfirst into him, claiming to be “following a Demiguise”. He had caught her arm and helped her regain her balance, and when she saw who he was, she didn’t lurch away in fear or disgust. She simply smiled up at him with her wide, knowing eyes and exclaimed, “Draco! It’s been a while. How are you doing?” Draco had spluttered out some nonsense about being fine and really needing to go, but she had linked her arm with his and proclaimed loudly that she thought his mother would
It’s easy to blend in when you know where the paps all hang around, yeah?
A main factor in most of Draco’s teenage wanking fantasies.
“If I’ve been going by Draco Black, why does my chart say Draco Lucius Malfoy?” He was getting closer to hysteria, and Harry quickly motioned Ron and Hermione to leave. With worried looks, they left Harry alone in the room, shutting the door behind them. Harry took a deep breath and summoned a vial of Draught of Peace, handing it to the panicking Draco. He downed it in one go, and his breathing slowed down. His eyes glossed over, and a small smile tugged on his lips.
“I’m sure our schedules won’t coincide that much,” Harry began plating the fry-up, giving each of them a healthy helping of toast, eggs, sausage, and beans. “We won’t have to see each other all that often…”
We all did. Some of us handled it better than others.
There it was.
“Yes?” Draco turned and raised an eyebrow as he shut the oven off and turned to look back at Harry.
“Blimey, his handwriting hasn’t gotten better, has it,” Ron complained, turning the chart this way and that. “From my reports at the Ministry, he was at the old Crabbe residence and he opened a door and was blasted by an undetected curse. He was knocked out and hasn’t woken since. From Harry’s notes,” he squinted, “He doesn’t appear to be in pain, but there’s something dark that has attached itself to his… something. I can’t read it. Seriously, Harry needs to get a Quick Quotes Quill or something, this is awful.”
PS. there is a POSSIBILITY of an epilogue at some point. Not anytime soon, mind you, but the possibility is there!!
“So, are we shagging then?”
“Allow me to let you in on a little secret.” Blaise lowered his voice. “He’s not going to settle down with you. This whole fling you’ve got going on? That’s all it is. A fling. He’ll come back to us when he’s bored of you, mark my words. It’s been what, a month?”
“If you’re sure…” Harry set the book blindly to his side. “I’ll get out of your hair for now. I’m going to give Draco a bit of time to come home, and if he’s not back soon, I’ll Floo to Blaise’s.”
“In a dream,” Draco finished dryly, peering down at the ostentatious sign that was now pinned to his chest. The dragon really was pretty; its pearlescent scales glowed and the multifaceted eyes seemed to light up mischievously . He sighed and gathered up another basket of scones to put into the display case. “Thanks, Luna. Truly.” He smiled at her, and she smiled back, her face displaying nothing but adoration for her friend.
ferret isn’t Malfoy?”
Harry did, but then pulled back, frowning. “So… I’m your secret?”
I won, and he breathed his last breath.
“Did you know that there’s a coffee that’s brewed from coffee cherries that have been eaten, digested, fermented, and then defecated by the Asian palm civet?” The two men jumped as Luna’s voice drifted into the kitchen. “It’s called Kopi luwak, and it is terribly expensive. I wonder if we could create a habitat for civets here?”
“Draco…” Harry tried again, “You usually ask for me to be your Healer. We live together, for fuck’s sake!” He was quickly losing his professionalism, and he tried to reign it back in as he dropped this newest bombshell on Draco.
There was this gravitational pull, of sorts.
Hermione nodded, biting her lip. “He never says no outright,” she said slowly, making eye contact with Ron before sweeping her gaze to Draco, “but there’s always an excuse to not do something.”
He wore the Glamour.
“You seem to remember me just fine.” Was it Harry’s imagination, or was Blaise’s hand slowly making its way up Draco’s thigh? “That little shiver when I press just…”
No way I would risk passing out while taking a slash in front of Draco.
“We should open a coffee shop.” Luna’s soft voice drifted across the garden as Draco took another round of blueberry scones out of the oven. “Your way with the french press is divine, and if other people could taste your baked goods...” she hummed in delight as she popped another morsel of the flakey pastry with clotted cream into her mouth. Draco let a slow smile cross his face as he maneuvered the tray of hot, fresh scones onto the cooling rack before brushing his hands off on the tea towel tucked into his waistband. He never imagined that he and Luna would become so close, but here they were at Draco’s gardenside flat, enjoying each other’s company and indulging in the fruits of their labor.
“I need a sabbatical,” Harry blurted out before the nerve left him. Coughing, he glanced at Healer Douglas, who was looking at him with a knowing look in his eye.
Draco was not prepared for this.
“We’re together.” He blurted out, then looked down at his lap, his face burning red.
“No sugar or syrup, and just a bit of cream.”
“Did he say if he would be returning?” Trying to look bored, he took another drink of his water and looked over the dance floor, surveying the other club-goers. They all seemed to be having a good time, and were completely oblivious to Draco’s internal struggle. Once he left the Cage or the stage, he was usually left alone and treated as any other attendee.
“You can’t be serious,” he spluttered, turning the button over in his hands, “Not everyone needs to know!”
“Can I buy a drink for Dragon? Is that something people do?” He asked, and Alyce threw her head back and laughed.
Knowing that Ron, at the very least, would be needing a hangover potion and a fry up, Harry got up early and made his way into the kitchen, setting the kettle to boil and summoning two hangover potions from his stash.
It was with sick pleasure that Draco informed each and every person who asked that the artist was dead and that the tattoo on his arm was the last Mark he’d ever make.
Draco nodded, smiling slightly into his cup, and Harry was sure he had made a mistake in telling him. To his surprise, Draco was one of the most supportive people when it came to Harry’s choices, choosing to flirt with him just as much (if not more) than he flirted with Ron.
Harry meandered away from the bar, navigated through a few dancing bodies, and came to a stop closer to the stage area. It was then he noticed a cage suspended above him, and this must have been what the bartender was talking about. Looking around, he noticed a few posters stating, “THE CASTLE PRESENTS DRAGON: GO-GO DANCER. EVERY FRIDAY AT 9PM”. The posters had a close up of bright, grey eyes, and Harry found himself pondering them longer than absolutely necessary. They looked vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t place where he’d seen them before. He didn’t spend a lot of time around Muggles, so he shrugged the thoughts away. No way he could know this ‘Dragon’ character; it was his first time at the club.
“Why didn’t you tell me we were dating?” There was a note of desperation in Draco’s voice. “Why couldn’t you have told me? After I woke up from the coma? After this morning…” He swallowed. “I thought that I had done something wrong, that maybe we had been dating but then you didn’t want me anymore…”
—” Harry began to protest, but was cut off by another squeeze to his leg. Draco looked at him and smirked, shaking his head.
“Hey,” the voice said uncertainly, and Draco turned to see Ethan, shifting from foot to foot, looking like he really didn’t want to be in the cafe.
“Exactly.” She gave a short laugh. “Blaise could be detrimental to his healing. You don’t know what he’ll tell Draco, and we haven’t exactly discussed with him the full aspect of his treatment, even though he is Draco’s emergency contact.”
Draco was, naturally, in charge of the baking and coffee making. The kitchen was his to do with as he pleased, and he stocked it with the latest and greatest muggle technology. He learned quickly in his baking experiments that magic interfered with the careful chemistry that came with baking, so he made a sign that read, “No wands in the kitchen!” as well as procuring a magical damper from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes so that as soon as someone breached the doorway, their magical abilities would be somewhat suppressed. While it didn’t completely take away a person’s magical properties, it subdued them enough so that while they were in the kitchen, their magic wouldn’t hinder the process. An Episkey for a cut would work just fine, but anything higher than a year two spell wouldn’t be able to be performed. Draco preferred it that way; he didn’t mind doing things hands on, and with how precise he had to be with ingredients and measurements, he knew it was necessary to lose his magic for a time while he was focusing on other things.
“Why would my room help you remember?”
“No, of course not,” Draco quickly responded, taking a step back and running a hand through his hair. “This is all new, I got carried away…”
“Yes, you’re describing him very well.” Harry knew his voice sounded deadpan. “What’s his first name?”
That was definitely the better plan.
“He won’t.” He patted the ferret’s head, a bit roughly. “You won’t.” He threatened, before offering Hermione a smile. “See you tonight… at seven?”
Probably was right on Death’s door, when he found me.
Knowing he couldn’t put it off any longer, he squared his shoulders and strode back to the fireplace. He grabbed some Floo powder and threw it into the flames. “Zabini Manor!” He said clearly, and brought his elbows in as he was whisked away.
But in a Muggle club?
“He is, thank you so much for asking.” Ms. Benson took the cup and inhaled the fragrant drink. “Smells heavenly, just like always! Happy birthday, my dear. I’ll see you bright and early on Monday!” She turned to leave, and Draco busied himself with wiping down his counters before grabbing the basket with a lone blueberry scone - the only leftover pastry of the day - and taking it to the back.
His eyes settled on the figure in the bed, and his wand dropped to his side. Harry was thrashing around, tangled in the sheets, mumbling to himself. Draco let out the breath he was holding - Harry was just having a dream. A nightmare, by the looks of it. He carefully walked to the bed and held out a hand, pausing momentarily before placing it on Harry’s shoulder. At once, Harry’s eyes flew open and he looked wildly around, unfocused.
“Oh.” Draco desperately thought around for a way to fix whatever was wrong. Then, he had it. “That’s brilliant!” He exclaimed. “You can finally show me what you’ve done to clean it up.” He walked over to Harry and plucked the rag from his hand, tossing it into the sink. “Ever since we had that talk last week, I’ve been dying to see it.” Draco could see Harry’s mind racing, as though his thoughts were written, plain as day, across his face. He knew he had just invited himself to Harry’s without an actual offer, and he waited to see if it was going to blow up in his face.
I nodded, not trusting my own voice for the moment. I sat up and swung my legs over the edge of the bed, wincing as I put weight on the injured leg. He sat up, startled at my sudden movement.
“Healer Potter!” He exclaimed, when he noticed Harry lingering in the doorway. “To what do I owe this pleasure?” Waving him in, Healer Douglas cast a Silencing charm as Harry closed the door. “Gotta protect any and all confidentiality,” he said with a wink, “And I know you’re one of our most valuable assets. What’s going on in your brain?”
After what I put them through.
“Shut it, you, or you’re not getting any curry.” Harry would pretend to gripe, but he loved their dynamic. He loved it so much that he didn’t realize he had fallen hard for Draco Black, formerly known as Draco Lucius Malfoy.
“Busy with what?” Ron interrupted, “He doesn’t do anything. After that day we waited for him at the Ministry for Auror training and he never showed, he wasn’t interested in going or doing anything with us.”
“That cat yowling outside.” Harry grimaced. “The weird singing fern in your garden. Um…” he tilted his head from side to side, listening. “Breathing.”
“Once you become a coffee connoisseur, like myself, perhaps then you’ll understand the finer nuances between the different types of coffee beans.”
I needed to be more careful next time.
After one too many ruined raids, he stormed into Draco’s office and demanded his assistance. There was a cursed mansion that belonged to one of the old Death Eater families, and Ron wanted him at the forefront to see him in action.
“Like… like this?” Potter began to match Draco’s swaying, their bodies close enough to brush against each other. Taking the hand that was previously running through his own hair, Draco brought it around Potter’s neck and leaned in closer, reveling in the shiver that ran through his body.
Blaise snorted. “Even after being out for a month, you still are the same demanding arsehole. Sure, I’ll get your tea. Preference?”
“I suppose,” her voice drifted out to him from their back garden, “but you have to wear this!” Something large and round was suddenly flying towards Draco, and, though his seeking skills were rusty, he managed to snatch what ended up being a badge out of the air. He examined it and flushed; it was a rather large button featuring an Antipodean Opaleye, breathing fire that rearranged into the letters spelling out, “It’s my birthday!” every few seconds.
“It’s in the fridge, behind the…” Draco faltered, “behind the cabbage.” He stared at Harry, wide-eyed. “How did I know it was there?” He whispered, looking alarmed.
“Dra~co!” The sing-song voice ripped through his concentration and, swearing under his breath, he turned away from the espresso machine to face the blue-haired bane of his existence. It was Saturday, and he had twenty minutes before he could close the cafe, and his favorite espresso machine was on the fritz. He was elbow-deep in maintenance and was not pleased with being interrupted, especially by none other than his apparent stalker, Ethan. To add insult to injury, Harry was late today, and he was doing his best not to worry about what could have possibly happened to him.
He couldn’t not obsess.
The silence was deafening. Usually, he and Harry would talk about the day or discuss plans for after work, but Harry appeared to be brooding and Draco didn’t want to bother him. He knew that sometimes, the silence was necessary to process, and that Harry would speak when he wanted to.
Harry sighed. He knew he didn’t have to disclose everything to her, so he decided to gloss over the morning incident. “We woke up together, cuddling. I ran away, he went to make tea, then got angry with me and said he got a letter from Blaise. After a bit more arguing, he left and Flooed to Blaise’s, and then I called you.”
“The cage,” he muttered, causing Ginny to roll her eyes.
His set felt like it was over faster than usual. The cheers and screams were received with a gracious smile and a small bow, his eyes darting around the crowd, looking for Potter.
He had been dancing for a good couple of months, and had fallen into a great routine. He had specific moves for certain songs, and he could judge the crowd and knew what days would be best as slow and sensual, fast and hot, or somewhere in a delightful medium.
while he had some peace and quiet. As the kettle boiled, he looked out the window at Edington and felt a warm sense of
With an answering squeeze of his hand, Draco pulled Harry closer, arms wrapping around him so tightly Harry thought he may never let go. “Merlin, you’ve no idea how scared I was I’d never hear you say that,” he admitted in a whisper, lips pressed to Harry’s hair. “I’m so sorry. I won’t run away again, I promise.” Pulling back enough to press a quick kiss to his forehead, Draco’s unsteady breath came in hot across his face.
“Malfoy?” He asked before turning to confirm his answer. “You’re late—I mean, you’re usually here earlier… Bugger.” At least having the decency to look sheepish as his words trailed off to a mumble, Potter lifted an arm to run through his atrocious mop of hair before shrugging.
“Please,” Harry whispered, voice breaking as he watched Draco turn on himself and disappear with a loud
“Would you rather the first time you meet everyone be at Christmas? Kids and all?”
Refusing to give in to the bile he felt rising in his throat, Draco took a few more steps towards the far wall. Keeping his gaze on the beige-tan-sand-had-once-been-white wool on his feet, he slowly made his way until he reached the pile of fabric that appeared to be his sleeping arrangements. This fabric also lacked a definitive colour, looking ragged and worn thin in so many places he doubted it would last the entirety of his stay. He had never seen something so clearly in need of replacing, despite his parents’ employing multiple house elves who dressed in rags and attending school with the Weasleys.
“On three?”
Unable to suppress the groan he let out as a sudden stab to the chest had him doubling over, Harry looked up to see if it had managed to go unnoticed. There was a sharp intake of breath as he realised the world was tilting on its axis. He blinked and suddenly noticed that there was an unmistakable fifth person in the room. How had he missed them entering? The panicked thoughts amped up another level at this lack of observation until the room began to right itself and he froze, realising what he was seeing once again.
Draco was probably busy. Childbirth was messy, the days that followed were exhausting and it didn’t leave much time for writing people. Merlin, he’d probably had someone else write up and organise the publishing of the
Raising an eyebrow but not questioning his motives, Draco nodded and called for the boys to keep walking with him. Grinning, Harry thought back to the snowmen he’d learned to make for Lily from inside the house last winter. He had never been much good with traditional ice carving charms, but he had become better at Transfiguration since school and Hermione had shown him some pointers when he’d mentioned what he had in mind.
“I’d best be getting home,” Harry said with a short nod, not wanting to drag this out to the point where Malfoy would regret anything. “See you ‘round, yeah?”

towards it.
“Harry!” Storming off towards the kitchen, Ginny shot daggers at him as she looked back over her shoulder. “Fix it or I swear, I will make your life miserable—and it won’t just be me.”
“…and Draco promised he’d take us next week, Nick’s got a wicked camera—”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Ginny was fine. It’s not like her life starts and ends with me you know. She had training, games away most weekends. It probably worked in her favour.”
“No!”
Opening the door, Harry froze as he saw Hermione standing in the hallway with her arms across her chest. She didn’t look impressed and he groaned inwardly as he realised she had likely heard most of his exchange with Kreacher.
Giving him a weary smile, Ginny nodded and turned towards the bedroom door. “Thanks. I just need a few hours.”
Shaking her head with a fond smile, Hermione paused for a moment before gently squeezing his forearm as she spoke. “Why don’t you try your hand at dating? If you’re really sure you don’t want to reach out.”
She laughed, a short bitter sound that
Laughing, Harry stepped forward and embraced her in a hug. “You’re far too observant, Gin.”
“Merlin, Harry, shut up would you? I’m at least half joking,” she said, a sad breathy laugh escaping her lips. “And clearly of the two of us, I’m handling this better. You know what we’re going to do?”

It looked no different to many of the other colours to Harry—he was pointedly avoiding making eye contact with the gold for comparison—but he wasn’t the trained Healer who presumably knew what each colour signified. His curiosity was certainly piqued, but he didn’t want to draw attention to any possible problems by asking questions, so instead he waited.
His last words were shouted as he turned to leave, filling Harry with a sense of overwhelming despair once more as he realised he couldn’t avoid Ginny forever. Hermione’s all too observant nature seemed to know exactly where his thoughts were and she stepped closer, squeezing one of his hands with hers.
“Kill people. I couldn’t do it,” he admitted, looking to his feet.
Letting out a yawn as he tucked his book under his arm, Harry grabbed the tea he’d just made and walked into the spare room he now thought of as his own. He had planned to read for a few hours before putting the Santa presents under their tree but paused as he heard tapping at the window, curious as to who would be writing so late on Christmas Eve. Placing the tea down on his bedside table, he looked up to see the familiar owl waiting outside, envelope attached tightly to her leg.
Both their heads turned at the clearing throat that sounded. Andromeda stood leaning against the doorway, soft smile on her lips and crinkling lines beside her knowing eyes.
And then there was Ginny.
“Oh.” Hermione’s brow furrowed and Harry could practically hear her thinking from across the room. “But the books…”
None of it made any sense!
“I guess not,” Harry agreed even as he glared, pouting slightly. He studied Draco’s face for a moment as he thought on his words, some of his earlier actions making more sense in the new light. “You really thought I just wanted to experiment?” He laughed, watching Draco grumble as he did so. “There are so many less complicated people I could have done that with, you idiot.”
Harry felt like he had been hit by the Whomping Willow.
Snorting, Draco looked up at Harry from behind his mug. “Still can’t believe you named him Albus Severus. They’d be rolling in their graves if they knew.”
She looked at him disapprovingly and with a slight hint of what appeared to be pity. “Harry, you know I would want to know.” Her voice was gentle and he could tell she was starting to worry about him.
Ron nodded and turned to leave but Hermione hesitated, eyes darting quickly between the healer and Harry. Clearly the urge to speak was too great and felt a pang of familiarity; he might hate being here, but Hermione’s consistency tugged at something warm deep inside him.
“Harry, I am getting you help whether you like it or not. Let me do things my way and research all the options out there, otherwise I am admitting you to
“I just think that us being…”
“You mean you—”
“Harry?” Draco asked, bringing him back into the moment. “You could at least pretend to be listening.”
Daring a glance back at Draco, he was glad to see the blonde looking amused rather than annoyed for his inattention. He smiled, before clearing his throat. “So, France?”
Draco pressed his palms to his forehead and sighed, letting his shoulders slump with his exhale. He was in for a long few years, that was for sure.
Shifting awkwardly between his feet, Draco nodded slowly. “I am. It’ll be better for both of us, and our child.”
Seeing the attention she was drawing around them as nearby healers and visitors looked their way, Hermione closed the difference across the hall and dropped her voice to a whisper. “He’s clearly unwell. This seems hugely unprofessional and I demand that either you get him the help he needs or you point us towards a second opinion immediately.”
“Because the prat is just getting me riled up so I won’t notice what he’s up to.”
Unfortunately, like that practice, this seemed to require a lot more focus than he could command in his current state. He sighed, pulled the blanket up higher and tighter and forced himself to slow his breathing - not too slow that he would speed up the possibility of dying right now, just enough so that his breaths were no longer shallow and he was actually getting enough oxygen into his system.
Harry shook his head. “No, Hermione. That doesn’t matter. If we could make the right choices, so could he.”
There wasn’t much left to get today, a small mercy for which he was thankful. He’d managed to pick up most of the presents ahead of time for once—entirely accidental on his part—in some of the wizarding stores Hermione had shown him in Bristol last weekend. Today's mission was simple: Ginny had mentioned some of the new flying gear stocked by Quality Quidditch Supplies and he was considering stopping in at Eeylops while he was here to see how much work a kneazle would be. James had met the neighbour’s cat and fallen in love at first sight.
“Though last week he was a bit sad because his parents are getting divorced,” Albus added as an afterthought. “But then I told him how cool it is having two houses and he said maybe it wouldn’t be so bad after all.”
Pouting, Harry took a glass of wine from the tray and sent a glare at Ginny. “You make it sound as if I’ve got a laundry list of plans to win Draco back.”
Harry laughed, shaking his head. He took a step closer and upon realising that Draco didn’t seem to be trying to run this time, he took a few more until he had Draco backed up against the wall.
“So what? Who gives a rat’s arse if you’re gay. I sure don’t.”
“We missed you at the pub last night,” Seamus said across the stack of boxes between them. “You getting on alright?”
while i'm not the hugest fan of the epilogue, this IS an epilogue compliant fic - we're only a few chapters away from that year, and i am very excited for you all to read how this develops and plays out 👀
“Oi, voice down,” James interrupted, eyes scanning the platform around them.
“He figured out what to get her then? That’s great,” Harry said with a grin. “Glad I could help.”
“He is not an obsession! You’re being ridiculous, both of you. I’m going to prove—“
“Bet he can’t think of what to get his person,” said Seamus. “What’d you end up with anyway? It’s a Slytherin, ain’t it?”
Taunts about Potter’s family, though effortless, seemed meaningless after all both he and they had sacrificed. After Draco’s family had fallen from grace. In truth, Potter was miserable enough without Draco’s help these days. It didn’t stop the familiar words falling from his mouth—it had become a habit too long ago—but there was no bite, no hatred. Just a dull need for something he knew almost as well as he knew his own name.
“How are you holding up?” Harry asked quietly, watching the other man’s eyes stay fixed on the stag. “You seem a bit lost in thought.”

Confused, Draco turned to see Harry mere inches from his face, green eyes locked on his with a burning intensity that had his heart stop in its tracks. He gulped as he nodded, unable to speak.
“Harry, you remember Draco?”
Harry slumped back against the chair, thinking it over. He couldn’t think of himself as anything but an Auror, truth be told. More than that he couldn’t see Draco turning around and leaving his family just because Harry was stupid enough to care about him.
“Mmm.” Unable to hold her knowing gaze, Harry made a show of taking his robe down from the hook by the door. “Yeah. Okay.”
brief mention of festive drinks
The boys grumbled, offering half hearted apologies as Draco guided them towards the street they’d need to take to the nearest floo point. Harry placed his glasses back on his face, turning to catch Draco’s eye and watching him smile before giving a small nod in response. Grinning so hard his cheeks threatened to split, Harry followed the three of them home filled with renewed hope and anticipation for what was to come.
Freezing like a deer in headlights as Harry felt the eyes of the entire pub turn and stare, he sank down in as chair even as Hermione realised she may have shouted too loudly.
Harry pressed a kiss to her hair before stepping back. “Yeah, I think that’s a good idea.”
To her credit, Hermione only took a minute to recover from the slight shock at being agreed with. “Well then, send him to someone to sort his emotions out.”
Harry sighed, shaking his head. “I don’t know, Gin. One minute things were fine, I thought we were about to kiss for Merlin’s—“
Malfoy barked a hollow laugh as he tipped back the rest of his eggnog. Locking eyes with Harry as he placed his empty glass on the table in front of them, he raised an eyebrow as the corners of his mouth curled up in what wasn’t quite a smirk. “You can’t be serious?”
Trying to piece together Hermione’s logic, Harry frowned. “So, he didn’t get everything he wanted?”
Being central to Voldemort’s defeat had done a lot for all of them as far as connections were concerned; Harry resented this and wished everyone would just leave him be, but Hermione had pounced on the opportunities presented with as much dedication as only she could possess. Hermione had taken it upon herself to challenge a lot of the legislation that had been changed during the past few years and as she did so she was trying to advance older laws that many might be more partial to questioning now that Voldemort’s motives were laid bare for all to see.
While Hermione shot him a glance and changed the subject to their plans for the wedding, Harry nodded along and made noises where it seemed appropriate, relying on Ron to carry most of this conversation. Meanwhile, he vowed to keep a close eye on Malfoy. Starting with his stupid Secret Santa thing. Harry would have to find out who Malfoy had drawn from the hat and protect them from a potentially harmful gift, keeping them safe while also proving that Malfoy hadn’t changed at all since their schooling years.
“Shut up!” Harry stage whispered as he glanced around them, seeing people starting to turn their way. “This is serious.”
Closing his eyes, he allowed himself a moment to simply enjoy the feeling of stillness he felt. It had been far too long since he’d allowed himself to stretch out properly in his bed and despite the bustle of noises and too-stiff sheets beneath him, Harry felt almost at peace for a moment. He took a deep breath which gave way to a yawn and smiled softly as his eyelids grew heavier with every passing moment. Solitude seemed sweeter when he wasn’t battling his tired mind alone in his room at Grimmauld. Here at least Harry knew he was too surrounded to let any sleep come from this.
He noticed that Andromeda took a moment to answer, her eyes looking to where Draco stood first. “They’re magical, Harry. Sometimes they work in mysterious ways.”
“Right,” said Harry, trying not to pay attention to Hermione’s knowing look beside him. “And what if they don’t break? Or if they broke in perfect halves or something?”
Potter.”
Coming back to meet Draco’s steely gaze, Harry felt himself heating up once more as he thought of this man—his friend, he corrected—in a loveless marriage. “How does that even work?”
“Phillips. John Phillips is the name, Mr Potter.”
He frowned, hating the way he could so easily agree with her words now. “This isn’t what I expected.”
“What, because I told you my sob story? Great, I’ll make sure to pull it out earlier next time.” Malfoy’s voice was reminiscent of their younger years: defensive and proud. It was only the slight shake to it that gave away how much his heart wasn’t in the fight. “If that’s all you wanted to discuss, Potter, I think I’d best be off.”
“Not to mention they’ve known each other a few months now,” Ginny said slyly, biting back a grin at Harry’s glare. “Was there something specific you wanted to know, Harry?”
“—you weren’t entirely stupid, Draco, we’ve been over this—”
, Harry took a second to appreciate the holiday decor. There was a miniature Christmas tree on the front counter and strings of multicoloured lights hung from the walls, giving it a festive feel. His feet found their way to the back of the short queue as he smiled to himself while watching the people at each table going about their days. Busy taking in the atmosphere, it wasn’t until he heard the familiar voice ordering in front of him that he snapped out of his people watching and his head turned to the unmistakable white blonde hair just above his natural line of sight.
Albus shrugged, mouth full of potatoes. “Says a lot about his dad,” he said between chews. “He sounds nice. I don’t think Scorp’s ever said anything bad about his dad.”
“Thanks, Harry. Ginny warned me off inviting the nargles in this year so there’s no mistletoe, I’m afraid.”
Shaking his head fondly, Draco smiled. “You know things are never that simple with us.”
Draco laughed, a knowing look on his face. “Who are you to deny the child?”
Draco let out a surprised laugh, looking pointedly at Harry with his eyebrows raised. “Harry, you’re the poster boy for acting on impulse. I know,” he added as Harry made to argue, “we’ve all changed a lot since school. Still, you can’t blame me for wondering.”
“And you can’t do that with someone you love?”
“Draco and I will be coming back, if that’s what has you so worried.”
He stands in the same doorway
There was a stunned pause around the table as Harry’s Butterbeer sprayed the potatoes in front of him, the shock sending it out of his mouth as quickly as it had gone in. “Scorpius Malfoy?”
Wanting nothing more than to sink into the mattress beneath him and disappear, Harry let out a loud sigh and spelled a quick
“Harry, lovely to see you again.”
Clearing his throat, Harry stepped into the firing line and slowly raised the hand that wasn’t wrapped around
“James is a teenager who has issues with everyone, Draco. Not everything is about you.”
Harry turned back to Hermione and brought the conversation back to where they’d left off:
“I’m not accusing you of anything, Harry. Stop getting so riled up. You’re terrible at keeping secrets anyway.” She waved off his protests, rolling her eyes. “You both just had a knack of gravitating towards on another, you know? Like you had your own personal orbit.” With a sad smile, she looked down at the floor. “It was different for us.”
Face breaking out in a grin, Harry ignored the snide remark he heard muttered under Draco’s breath and instead focused on seeking out a table for them. Finding one by the glass storefront he made a beeline over and sat with his back to the street, watching Draco make his way to the unoccupied seat when he finished paying.
“So you just…Want to stay like this?”
Malfoy shrugged, still looking at Harry oddly. “Perhaps.
“It’s not funded, is it.” It was not a question, and Healer Benson didn’t seem to take it as such.
Kreacher stood straighter, if such a thing were even possible. “Master is ill! Master must be going to St Mungos now!”
“Yeah, mate. Wish I could have made it.” Harry gestured to the cluttered space around him with an apologetic smile. “Christmas just seems to be a different breed of beast for the shop, you know?”
The silence around them seemed deafening as Draco refused to look up from where his fingers were tugging at the end of his emerald green scarf. Curse his feelings for encouraging him to talk. What they’d had before now was good. It wasn’t enough for Draco—he wasn’t sure if there would ever be enough of Harry for him, honestly—but it was bearable, and manageable, and Merlin’s beard it was
“Maybe there shouldn’t be an us.” Draco’s voice was low, unrepenting. “You see what I’ve been saying all this time? If two kids who barely saw the war can’t forgive me, how will the rest of the world?”
It had been a long evening at work—Christmas Eve always kept them open late—and Harry was just about ready to collapse when he apparated home. Landing on the top step, he turned left towards the door before doing a double take at what he saw in his peripheral.
Walking through the doors to Andromeda’s house on Christmas morning Harry was immediately enveloped in a warm embrace, closing his eyes as he enjoyed the scent of cinnamon and figs that filled the air. Pulling back after a few moments, Harry met Andromeda’s weary eyes and smiled down at her. Her grey hair was pulled back in a wispy bun, detailing just how much the lines in her face had become more prominent even since he had moved here last year. Lips pulled up in a smile, she stepped out of the way as Teddy came barrelling down the hallway at a dangerously fast speed.
“Oh,” she said slowly. “Do people say mean things to you and Draco because you’re both boys?”
There was silence for a moment, finally broken by Neville. “I’m
It wasn’t gentle, but nothing between them ever had been. Harry’s teeth found his neck and he was biting and sucking, urged on by Draco’s murmurs and moans. He found Draco’s lips again, hands reluctantly detangling from his hair to unbutton his shirt and pull his robes down off his shoulders. They paused in unspoken agrement, Harry leaning back so Draco could pull his shirt off his head
“I did,” Harry responded tiredly. “Boom.”
He felt like crying, suddenly. Harry took a few deep breaths, trying to calm himself, trying to keep his mind in his body and his eyes present on the clean-up he was doing. “They haven’t tried, though,” he said once he had gathered himself. “It took you one day to find me. And listen. They’ve – I mean, we’ve talked a bit. But they haven’t listened. They haven’t sought me out.”
“Who’s your professor for the year?” Pansy asked him, breaking Harry away from his thoughts. The previous day at lunch, Professor McGonagall had asked them to each think at length about where they wanted their future to head, and choose a professor to help guide them. She had explained that they would experience everything from one-on-one mentoring to helping with classes, to extra, more advanced studying. They hadn’t been given much time – they were required to have a foot of parchment writte on which professor they’d like to work with and why to be handed in to McGonagall at dinner. At breakfast today, they were to find out what professor they had been assigned and to meet with them at some point throughout the day.
“What is it?” Harry asked. He took it and swallowed, dimly aware of Madame Pomfrey saying something before fell back into sleep.
When he died, he had seen the tortured part of Voldemort’s soul die along with him, heard Dumbledore tell him that it was past saving, watched the pain it exhibited. Nobody at Hogwarts was past saving, but they all had tortured souls, now. In the Days After, with Andromeda’s help, Harry was able to find that tortured part of his soul. He couldn’t heal it – was unsure if it would ever be healed, but he felt it contract whenever he thought of those who died, whenever he heard a loud noise, whenever someone raised their wand at him. Andromeda had said being aware of it was half the battle of healing it, but Harry didn’t think it could be healed – not really.
“That’s bollocks and you know it,” Harry hissed. He opened his mouth to say more but was interrupted by a squeal.
“I heard it’s under the lake, and it’s always dark,” said another girl nearer to the front of the group.
“I don’t think she can hold a grudge,” Ginny said with a sigh. It was obvious she was talking about Luna. “Now are you going to tell me why you aren’t speaking to my brother?”
“Alright,” said Harry, relaxing slightly. Ron and Hermione were being…incredibly infuriating, of course, but that didn’t mean he wanted to see them hurt – or to have hurt them. “So – what happens now?” he asked, before his thoughts could take him further than he needed to go. “Am I alright now?”
“I am Harry Potter,” he said. A wave of shock went through the group – he did his best to tactfully ignore it. “What’s your name?”
He would miss this. He would miss Andromeda and Teddy, the peace of the cottage. He’d miss visiting Hogwarts and Draco quietly, having tea with McGonagall. He’d miss flying with Charlie, who was going back to Romania, anyways.
“You woudn’t stop screaming,” he said, “Not after you woke up, either.”
“No,” he said, with a rueful shake of his head. “I need help with Arithmancy, though. Maybe we could all study together after classes tomorrow?”
“Mar,” he said as gently as he could. “Do you know what sarcasm is?”
“Common Room,” Blaise said with finality. “We can hunt for some sixth or seventh years to help us with muggle studies.”
“Let me go, then,” Harry responded, giving Draco another small kiss on the forehead. “I’ll be quick.”
“I don’t sound like that,” Harry said, weakly. Hermione glared at him, but she had stopped crying through her angry tirade. “Does it help if I say sorry?” He asked meekly.
It didn’t matter anymore, in the Days After, who liked him, who believed him. There was no one to save anymore,
“I don’t even want to know how you know that,” Draco’s voice said in his ear. Harry shuddered at the proximity.
“That isn’t how it works,” Andromeda said, almost immediately. It wasn’t the response Harry had been expecting, but she went on before he could say anything. “You’re right that Life and Death weren’t balanced when you died. But you’re forgetting the piece of Voldemort that died with you. Something did die and it did restore the balance, Harry. Horcruxes are old magic - I don’t know much about them, but old magic always comes with a price. It is too wild to use lightly.” She took a sip from her tea and gave him a gentle look. “Life and Death always require balance, and it was you who restored that balance after Voldemort disrupted it. I daresay Death owes you a favour.”
Mar gave Harry an eager wave as the four friends scrambled out of the common room to get to the Great Hall on time. Somehow, though, Harry didn’t think this was going to be the last time they were going to discuss the issue.
“Pansy would say something different to that,” Harry couldn’t help pointing out.
“What do I do, then?” He asked. He was aware he sounded like a petulant child. He also didn’t care.
“We don’t need to talk about it,” Zabini said then. “It just sounded – sounded worse than your usual.”
Harry felt himself smile back. “I wouldn’t put it past them.”
Harry gave her a shrug. It wasn’t as though there was much in particular that he could say. It was strange, really, having so many people flock to protect him after a life spent in the Days Before being treated like an adult for so long before he was even near to being one.
Harry watched Pansy and Blaise exchange exasperated looks. “One day,” Harry said, “I’m going to introduce you to a Walkman. Or noise-cancelling headphones.”
Ginny gave him a small smile. “They’ve been through a lot, you know. Not that we all haven’t,” she added at his look. “But when they left for Australia so quickly it made me think that they weren’t able to confront their grief. They couldn’t stay here and handle it. So we,” she gestured broadly around the classroom, “Have been confronting our demons all summer. Trying to make sense of everything. They haven’t.”
Well, I couldn't leave everyone hanging for too long...
Pomfrey insisted on giving Harry one finally check up, which he sat through with an air of annoyance. He really just wanted to leave the Hospital Wing, knew Draco and Blaise and Pansy were waiting for him.
Harry couldn’t help it – he grinned at her, then pulled their wands out of his pocket. “They can’t use their wands, either,” he added cheekily.
the kids, even. You can’t let it happen.”
Minerva says the best way to spit in the face of the Dark Lord is to oppose his ideals – not just on the surface, per formatively, but wholeheartedly. She is right. At my trial I did not necessarily believe that muggles were as good as wizards, I did not believe they were worth as much or as important or worthy of life in the same way.
That was, perhaps, an understatement. But Harry kept that thought to himself, at least. “Did something happen?” He asked instead.
He felt Draco shudder under him. “Point taken. Let me up, then.”
“Knock on your solid stone door? Or is it better to slap your dog portrait until he barks?” Pansy snapped, but she still came around and sat on the foot of the bed. Blaise deposited himself on Draco’s chair.
Harry didn’t respond, couldn’t, could only whimper as Draco bent down again, kissing his chest, rolling a nipple between his teeth, made Harry arch into him with a needy keen. His hands were tangled above him, stuck in his sweater, and he could barely focus as Draco reached above him, hardly recognized that his hands were being tied above his head against the bedframe.
“You’ve got Ginny.”
“Yes, Miss Granger. He will be well taken care of under your watchful eye, I presume?”
“Malfoy, wait.”
“Hmm.” She fell silent for a moment, the backdrop of childish chatter from across the room a familiar music to Harry’s ears as he waited. “Have you considered that perhaps… and I don’t mean to sound insensitive, but is there any chance you’re projecting your feelings onto him because you’re a bit bored? You never did like sitting around doing nothing. And trust me,” she said as she raised her voice slightly, “I’m not one to call raising children nothing. Mine are pains enough. But you always had a thing for following Malfoy around when you needed something to do.”
“You were visiting her?”
Ron had offered to let Harry stay with him last night so he wouldn’t be kept up by the constant scratching of Hermione’s quill and muttering at the disorganisation of documents she was poring over on the kitchen table, but in truth Harry was glad of her distraction. He suspected Hermione knew what he was up to, but she’d given up scolding him weeks ago and had instead settled for sending disappointed glares at him when he stumbled too close to her. Most nights were just exhausting, spent in a half-asleep haze perusing the empty rooms of Grimmauld Place and doing everything he could to keep his mind away from what sleep would bring.
“And for you?”
With a flirtatious giggle, Ginny swung her red curls to one side as she extended a hand. “Ginny, please.”
“No.”
Hermione shot him a pointed look. “Oh yes, sorry, how could I forget. Malfoy is a new obsession that we have never once before heard about.”
“She’s good. Follows me everywhere, even in the Manor.”
Murmuring to herself in the background for a while as she drew out individual colours to inspect, Harry barely noticed Healer Benson until she addressed him again.
Something was missing. And he knew that something was him.
“You heard me.” Draco sighed, meeting his gaze for a quick moment before turning to walk away. “I’m leaving for France tomorrow. We’re both getting married in the new year. There’s nothing more to say.”
“Hey!” Harry shouted, drawing strange looks from some of the people in line. Dropping his voice, he instead opted to glare across the table. “I take offence to that. Dumbledore would have loved it.”
he thought with a grimace.
He sat admiring the unguarded emotions crossing Draco’s face as he continued, attention particularly caught by the light snow that had started to fall. Some fell atop Draco’s hat and Harry felt himself smiling at the scene before him.
“What Nick said tonight,” he began, ignoring the eye roll he got in response. “It doesn’t matter if you killed people, Draco. We all did what we had to do.”
“What the—Ginny?”
His footsteps reached the door again and as he swivelled he glimpsed the time on the grandfather clock in the corner. He knew it was late. It hadn’t seemed like it was 2 o’clock when he’d finally given in to his emotions and peeled the covers back to walk back and forth like a caged animal past his four poster bed, but either he’d been walking a lot longer than he thought he had, or he had underestimated the amount of time he had spent laying in bed trying to ignore the feeling as it built.
“What if it was two wizards?” Harry asked, seeing Arthur frown in response. “Or two witches,” he added hastily.
“I didn’t mean that, Malfoy.” Harry’s voice was quiet when he next spoke, eyes fixed on the ground. “Your mother saved my life. I don’t doubt she would be kind to Hestia.”
“Do you really think so?” Shaking his head, Harry placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders, voice tender. “You don’t think everyone else has had the chance to grow as much as we have?”
“Harry?”
Mouthing Ginny a
“So we agree it’s a good idea then?”
Hermione let out a sharp laugh causing both Harry and Ron to flinch, having heard it many a time before. This was the
“Sorry, what?”
“Yeah. I just, I only wondered…”
“Harry. Stop pretending like you’re the only one who made a choice here. It’s not like I hadn’t started to suspect something and even if I hadn’t, I didn’t go into this marriage under coercion. You didn’t make me do it. We both made decisions, we’re both adults. I still love you, and… while your love might not be what we both hoped it would be for this marriage that doesn’t make what we’ve built any less real.”
“One day you’ll have to stop apologising for a decision that we both made. Give me some credit, would you?”
“Fine.” Harry shrugged, extending a hand to Malfoy in invitation. “Let’s be not-friends, then.”
“I didn’t—”
“Of course! Kitchen’s through this way.”
“We have a similar saying in the Muggle world, I think. What’s mine is yours. Actually no, it’s used in a very different ritual, I guess… I don’t know.”
She offered him a soft smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Sure. Should we grab lunch on the way?”
So that’s how Draco was going to be about it?
“I’m not answering that,” he said even as he heard Hermione’s laughter in response. “He’s made it very clear where he stands.”
Rounding the corner out of Flourish and Blotts in a hurry as he clutched Hermione’s present to his chest, Harry checked the time on Fabian Prewett’s old watch and swore. He was going to be late. Knowing that Robards would forgive him for it didn’t make him feel any better about it either; the special treatment was really wearing on his last nerve, despite it being what got him into the Auror program to begin with. Taking a steeling breath, he soldiered on with the mission of finding a suitable gift for Teddy before sprinting back to the Ministry. Today was his last chance to peruse Diagon before the holiday events kicked off and though he loathed being out in the lunchtime crowds, he knew it would only get worse if he ducked back after training finished later tonight.
“Harry, dear. Do you happen to know a synonym for “in love” that might make it easier for Draco to admit his feelings?”
“Did I?”
It was a series of conflicting emotions that ran through Draco's body as he accepted his fate for the foreseeable future. He knew that Azkaban was a horrible place, one that he shouldn't be happy to be imprisoned in.
This was ridiculous. He needed sleep—there were more events tomorrow, of course there were—and yet all he could think about was how detached he felt from his life right now. Flickers of the past few weeks flew by in his mind but that was all he could grasp; he felt like he was watching a montage of someone else’s life and he was intruding by knowing the few details that he did. Even this anger he felt right now seemed borrowed. And that enraged him even more.
“We both know what happened here. How do you manage, night after night?” Before Draco could retort, Potter dropped his eyes again as his voice cracked on the final syllable. “Please.”
Keeping them closed, Draco relaxed his eyes slightly to take the pressure off and try alleviate the tears that were threatening to flow.
“He’s replied three times now,” Harry said with a sigh. “I don’t get it.”
A shout from a nearby table was the final straw; by now he’d garnered the attention of the entire pub and felt as if he’d been plunged into the icy-cold depths of the Great Lake as all eyes focused on him. Gulping, he turned his pleading stare to Ron and Hermione in turn as he realised that something was amiss.
“You don’t have to—”
“I’m just saying. You’ve never been one to notice these things, have you?”
“Wait, people are—“
“Take all the time you need. I’ll listen out for him until you get up.”
She sighed. “I wish it were that simple.”
Dean groaned into his hands. “Yeah, I reckon you’re right, mate. I just don’t want to do it, that’s all.”
Damn the war. Damn Voldemort, for starting it all. For ending his hopes of a normal life. For painting a target on his head. While he was at it… Damn Trelawney, damn Snape, damn Dumbledore; damn everyone who had been involved in the prophecy. Why him?! Yeah, sure, it had all worked out. He had won the war, right? The saviour. The bloody Chosen One. For what cause?
to stop being blind? Seems hardly fair.”
Chuckling to himself, Harry made his way through the chaos towards the registers and gave a smile at Chelsea, one of the two Hogwarts-age casual staff he’d put on over Christmas hols. “Mind pulling up the purchase history for my friend here? Peter’s shown you how to do that, yeah?”
Taking satisfaction in the subtle smile that crossed Draco’s face, Harry listened along as he talked about all of the child’s antics in recent months. Their interaction was almost how it had been before he’d left for Norway, similar enough that were it anyone else Harry could have ignored the gut feeling that something was amiss. It became too much too quickly though, and he began tuning out Draco’s words while his thoughts spiralled and he instead found himself fixating on the movement of his lips
“You’re a liar.”
merry christmas to those of you who celebrate it! please enjoy this gift of purely self indulgent fluff/a lil bit of feelings
There was silence for a moment before he heard Draco sigh in response, the telltale sound of metal chair legs scraping on the floor as he stood. “Go home to Ginevra, Harry. I don’t mean to sound terribly rude but I cannot talk to you if you’re trying to figure out your marriage. It feels inappropriate for both of us and I…I don’t want to be responsible for breaking apart the golden couple.”
“We’ll see. There’s at least plenty of golden trinkets for the yeplests to enjoy.”
Raising her eyebrow almost imperceptibly, Healer Benson shook her head. “You were expecting anything different?”
“You still might have,” Harry admitted, though the words felt like a lie. “Draco, why didn’t you just talk to me? We could have avoided so much of this.”
“I said, nothing appears to have shifted since your diagnostic a few minutes ago.”
, shmophet. Load of rubbish, that’s what I say. I can see the headline now.
Clearing his throat, Malfoy accepted the proffered glass and clinked it against Harry’s, maintaining steady eye contact as he took the first swallow. Harry felt his cheeks flush as he watched the movement of Malfoy’s throat, his tongue darting out to wet his lips, the glint in his eyes as he reclined in his chair and stretched his legs out before him.
Why? Wasn't Harry allowed friends at his own bloody wedding?
“Zonko’s?” He asked Malfoy, eyes determinedly fixed on where Teddy was playing and not the blonde beside him.
Harry dropped one hand as he brought the other up through his hair absentmindedly. “She, er. She’s the same. You guys might, er, y’know.”
Harry frowned. “Stop what?”
Draco surprised both of them by laughing; a light, unguarded sound that continued to echo beyond the distance between them. Regaining his composure after a moment, he smirked. “Still keeping an eye on me, Potter? Some things never change.”
The echo of a scream dying in his throat as he came to, Harry’s first observation was that everything smelled abnormally clean and the harsh whites of the room around him stung his eyes as they adjusted. His hair was plastered across his forehead and the lenses over his eyes were fogged up from the heat he was radiating. Removing his glasses to rub against where they pressed into the bridge of his nose he berated himself for falling leaving them on as he slept and then it struck him: he hadn’t done it intentionally. No, he hadn’t meant to fall asleep at all.
Harry paused for a moment and Draco’s heart sank into his stomach, wishing he’d simply kept his mouth shut.
Crossing his arms, Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco. “You’re not making a good argument against this. You can’t just kiss me and then tell me it’s a bad idea!”
Is forgiveness possible?
He didn’t have to ask who she was referring to. “No.”
Harry perked up, realising they had the same destination. “Oh! I was going to look at kneazles for James.”
“Yeah, of course.” Seamus shrugged, fiddling with the quill he’d plucked off the top of the stacked boxes. “Just wasn’t sure if he’d popped in here lately. He mentioned wanting one of those new Scrambler kits…”
Andromeda’s words brought Harry back to the room they were in and he gave her a soft smile. “Yeah, I do.” Turning back to where Malfoy stood, he nodded. “Merry Christmas, Malfoy.”
Harry shook his head, looking at Andromeda and Teddy ahead of them before turning his gaze back to Draco. “A lot has changed. Besides, not all of us can stay married when we’d rather be with someone else.”
“Wouldn’t really say he cornered me,” Harry mumbled. “Was just weird, that’s all. Bit out of nowhere really.”
After a moment it clicked, and he quickly raised both hands to cover his face. Voice muffled, he swore into them.
“Well, I did. Does that make me more evil than you?”
keeping it short & sweet with this one 🙃 finally our boy is going through some GROWTH and talking about his FEELINGS! things you love to see: it.
To his children’s credit, they had taken it better than he had anticipated—Ginny told him he was a chronic over-worrier these days—which he was eternally grateful for. That didn’t make it any less nerve-racking, however, as he brought the three of them to Malfoy Manor to meet his boyfriend for the first time.
