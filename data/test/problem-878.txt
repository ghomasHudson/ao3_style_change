, Potter,” huffed Draco, exasperated, “What exactly did you think you were going to do about it? Weep on him?”
I hope I did Hari’s name justice! I saw the idea on that one tumblr post that floated around a few years ago and couldn’t get it out of my head. I did a little research, but I don’t really know what I’m talking about, so if I did something wrong, please let me know so I can fix it!
“You must resent us terribly,” she’d observed out of a quarter hour’s silence as she patted soft peat over the head of a baby mandrake.
“Right, well.” Draco cleared his throat. “Harry, as unfortunate as it is that it falls to me to tell you this, I suppose I must. You’re famous.” When neither Harry nor Amy made a move to do anything but stare at him in disbelief, Draco continued. “Wizards and witches live alongside the Muggle world--that’s what we call your world, the one without magic in it. I suppose I should start with that. We’ve got our own government, schools, even a few all-Wizarding villages.”
“‘Lo, Victoire,” he said to the five-year-old, patting her head as it was the only part of her he could reach without falling over.
“Not to...He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,” said Harry quickly. “Draco made an unexpected appearance on the balcony.”
--he’d take the memory of this hug to his grave. He smelled biscuits on Molly, and the dab of rose oil she wore at her pulse points, and sweat from the heat of the kitchen. She was soft, was Molly Weasley, but firm, her arms wrapped around him solidly and completely and—was she moving?
Amy shook her head. They continued up the stairs. At the top, there was a wooden door, as old and dark as the staircase and its paneled walls. But the room that the door opened upon was
“I was ready,” Harry continued, “to storm into her very kitchen and tell her that, while I very much wanted to be a part of the family”—Draco took in a hissing breath—“you were the most important thing to me, and I would not come back without you,” Harry finished.
“Ah.” Draco seemed surprised, but recovered quickly. “Well, it’s all tied to Wizarding politics, so I suppose you’d have no reason to be aware. Harry is the last of the Potter line, but has not yet had the chance to claim his inheritance, as he was until recently believed to be deceased.”
Wednesday was dinner at Ron and Hermione’s. Since all of relevance were in attendance, both Potter-Malfoy sets decided to announce their intentions toward each other in one fell swoop. After a few congratulations were muttered and Hermione patted Ron’s back till he stopped choking on his wine, a silence fell over the table.
Harry recovers from a hangover, gets the news from Draco, and finesses a tentative truce using his domestic skills.
“Just a mo.” Draco tapped his phone a few times and had a brief conversation. He looked at Harry after hanging up. “It’ll be fifteen minutes,” he said.
the time. It’s more complicated than just catching them red-handed. In this case, the victims are the marginalized, and the criminals have privilege on their side.”
But as he stood on shaky legs to fulfill that resolution--hmm, how long had it been since he’d eaten, then?--Dennis Creevey, the receptionist-slash-aide-slash-office-mascot, poked his head round Harry’s cubicle wall.
Harry was irritated. He was going to have to show up to the restaurant. He needed to make the toff--oh, excuse him, the Earl--take his goddamned money back and rein in his self-righteousness.
happy for you, Dad,” said Lily sweetly. Then she reached across the table and stole the rest of Albus’ cake.
If the discovery that his parents were murdered wizards, followed shortly by an attack on his best friend's apartment by acolytes of the murderer, hadn't been the strangest thing to happen to him tonight, Harry would have expected that the French goblin bank would make the cut.
“I’m, er.” The waiter blinked. “If this isn’t a hallucination, it’s possible that I’m your godfather. Harry?”
“Me and Dolohov,” Pettigrew clarified, gesturing to the driver’s seat, where Tom’s inveterately shady driver surely lurked. “
Draco shrieked. Amy had fallen heavily into his shoulder, now just as deeply asleep as the cat in her lap.
“It would,” Draco agreed, “but at this point I’m not even certain what it is you think you told me.”
Scorpius and his father were about to retire for the night when a silver stag burst through the drawing room wall.
Surprised and a bit miffed at being interrupted, Harry looked up to find Draco Malfoy standing above him. He could not have been more astonished. Of course Harry knew Draco’s office building was only a few doors down from his, but it might as well have been a world away. Draco was the sort to be reminded by his secretary that he had to attend a three-martini lunch with visiting dignitaries, rather than simply popping over to Pret for a sandwich and cuppa after crying in a cubicle all morning, as Harry had. He looked out of place, too, in his Armani, surrounded by plebs like Harry (who wore discount Burberry at his fanciest, and then only when Hermione bought it for him).
“Yes,” said Hermione acidly, “and your presence has always had such a calming effect on their dynamic.”
“Traitor! Fuck, I need to get out of here. And possibly out of town. Do you think Sweden is accepting immigrants? I could be Swedish.”
In point of fact, they both ate their bacon. After a silent stretch of breakfast-induced bliss, Ginny took his plate.
“Scorpius,” said his father admonishingly, “heterosexual boys generally don’t perform wedding ceremonies between their toy Aurors and their toy pirates.”
“Huh.” Ron crooked a Weasley eyebrow, which in its bright orange text carried none of the dry criticism Hermione could convey without a word.
“I know it’s difficult,” Harry said after a moment. “I understand you never expected your Mum and I to split up—neither did we, really—and then to see me not only with someone else, but with another man. It must be difficult. I get that, I really do.”
“I’m honored to be here, Mrs. Weasley,” Draco said. He clasped her hand in both of his, and Harry watched her notice the ring. Her eyes flickered to him before she fixed her attention back on Draco.
“All shades. Well, except that dreadful generic dress shirt shade. You know the one. You wear it most days.”
His father chuckled. “Nothing of the sort. I only wanted to tell you that I’m seeing someone as well.”
It was both a command and a threat. Normally, Harry wouldn’t have responded to such a tone. But these days had been frustrating, and Harry was chomping at the bit to do something.
With a loud belch, the cupboard messily expelled its contents in a pile on the floor. Then it popped out of existence, leaving Arthur a clear view of a stunned Sirius and a dark-haired, brown-skinned, green-eyed young man.
Spurred by the confession, Draco found himself setting down his drink and standing almost automatically, as if compelled to do so. The two men rushed toward each other and met in the middle.
Another uncomfortable silence stretched until a waiter from downstairs knocked on the door with their food. Cutlery was included, but Sirius levitated a bottle of wine and four glasses into the room from the kitchen.
Harry frowned. “Difficult,” he admitted. “There’s this girl, I think she needs to be removed from her home, but her aunt--”
“Too late, I’m afraid,” said Draco. “Arthur flooed while you two were having your heart-to-heart. Potterwatch wants us at Headquarters. Eleven o’clock.”
“Yeah.” Hari stepped away and leaned on the counter again, trying to conceal his tears. Judging by the arm Sirius soon wrapped around his shaking shoulders, it didn’t work.
Harry grinned, and, keeping eye contact, whispered, “Green.” Draco pinned his wrists down and crashed over him, kissing him mercilessly. Harry melted, letting it all in.
“You’ve come to the wrong country, Amy,” said Sirius with a grin, “but at least you’ve come to the right restaurant.” Then he summoned another of those silver creatures, which galloped through the wall as Amy examined Sirius’ raised wand, squinting.
“Why do you care?” asked Harry. “You seemed pretty careless before. Why should I think you did this out of some sort of sense of generosity, or even guilt? Not that I’d be okay with it in either of those cases, either.”
Draco’s pub was the paneled, polished sort of place that had sconces and didn’t carry Seagrams. Harry felt instantly uncomfortable on walking in. Then he reflected that this had probably been Draco’s intention, and decided to spite it. So he held his head high and strolled up to the bar, hands shoved into his pockets, to order an overpriced but admittedly very good scotch.
“Yes,” said Harry again, and Draco wrapped a hand around his wrist as Harry led him down a stunted hall.
Draco waved the concern away. “I have a few million in trust from my mother’s side of the family,” he said. “I haven’t touched it, since I’m saving it for when Father finally cuts me loose.”
“Give me that,” said Harry, snatching the bottle from Draco and taking a few gulps before handing it over to Amy.
Remembering all of that now, Harry cried out, then opened his eyes in surprise. He hadn’t even realized he’d been touching his cock, but now he was so close to coming. And he was getting closer, barely touching himself as he remembered Draco’s nails digging into his thighs as he sucked him, Draco grabbing the base of his cock when he got too close, Draco fucking him into the mattress and eating him out after, waking up to Draco’s mouth on his neck…
“Of a sort,” said Draco with smarmy false modesty. “Anyway, around the time we were all tadpoles, there was a war. A Dark wizard called Voldemort was trying to take over.”
That hadn’t been so long ago--a few years, time in which Draco hadn’t changed much. And he still hadn’t really changed. He still loved Tom. The only difference was, he was beginning to hate him now, too. And that hatred was beginning to chip away at his fear. That was probably Harry’s influence--or maybe Draco had simply had enough. So he let the truth out.
It wasn’t until several seconds later, as he poured his whisky in absolute silence, that Harry realized what he’d said. He poured Draco a measure and doubled his own.
“We’re in the Paris Catacombs,” Draco explained as gently as he could manage. “There’s a back entrance to the French branch of Gringotts through here.” Both Muggles stared at him blankly, so Draco sighed and added, “Wizard bank.”
“Nothing to it, you great tosser.” She got on her tiptoes to kiss his forehead--they were the same height, so it was easy enough--and went out the door.
“Sorry--do clothes get cat hair on them?” Draco’s furrowed brow smoothed as a realization came to him. “Of course. Wizarding clothes come charmed against that sort of thing. It’s a bit more advanced than I am in tailoring, but I’m sure we can eventually find someone who can charm your clothes so that the cat’s hair doesn’t stick to them in the first place.”
Hermione rolled her eyes but didn’t respond. Ron joined them, sliding his plate onto the table and not even pausing to greet them before stuffing his croque monsieur into his mouth.
“Honestly,” said Ginny, sitting back, “this is a lot more thinking than I expected to do on this visit. I won’t tell you to be careful, because you have Hermione for that. But yeah. I think there’s a chance. As long as you’re both willing to admit that you’re idiots.”
“Well, I mean, I just don’t know when I’d have the chance. What with Voldemort and the war and all. Plus I seem to run into a dragon or a troll or something every second Tuesday. I’ve a lot on my plate. Sure I’ve had crushes, but...love? All-consuming, distracting, intoxicating, wanting-to-snog-in-corridors stuff? I’m starting to think it’s not real, or if it is, that it’ll never be for me.”
been a nightmare, in fact, but Harry had a fortunate tendency not to remember his dreams. They couldn’t be pleasant. He often woke with a headache from grinding his teeth.
--I mean, humans mostly--to see. The Patronus charm is designed to frighten Dementors. Wizards and squibs can see magic
“Of course not,” said Draco, appearing genuinely surprised at the accusation. “Why ever would I do that?”
“Sorry,” Harry lied, and let him go. Draco stepped inside, then stopped when met with a wall of unimpressed Granger-Weasleys.
Hermione sighed. “Well,” she said, “I suppose, since we’re not in school any more, you ought to call me Hermione. We’ll work out the rest later.”
Surprise!  New chapter!  I mean, I get that every new chapter is a surprise because the updates are so sporadic...did I mention thanks for sticking with this?
“Ugh,” said Ginny. “I take it back.” She poured them each another teacup of whisky, and the conversation moved on to some of the less Ron-friendly stories from her time away training. When they were tipsy enough that Harry was capable of being good company, they headed out to join the others for dinner.
“Y’know,” said Harry, “looking back, I sort of feel like the ferret incident might have been traumatic for Malfoy? Like maybe it wasn’t as funny as we remember?”
“Cousin,” Draco interjected sharply, “Perhaps we ought to catch up before we begin scheduling play-dates.”
Thanks for stopping in. This is just my casual reminder that our boys are -not- behaving like adults, and that, even though they are being fairly responsible with matters of consent, they are -not- displaying appropriate kink negotiation. Emotional constipation makes for good drama, but don't try it at home, kids!
“Er, let me just check the linen closet, and I’ll be right back with an answer on that.” She let go of the intercom button then turned to Harry with her hands on her hips. “What did he
Sorry about the chapter title. I don’t know how I thought I’d be able to come up with an airtight communist pun every time tbh
“Don’ look like anythin’,” Harry slurred, refusing to open his eyes. Suddenly he felt Ginny’s weight across his stomach, then, before he could finish groaning, there was the feeling of glasses being shoved clumsily onto his face.
“I don’t suppose you’ll apologize to Ron, as well?” Harry asked hopefully. Draco looked over his shoulder at him with a raised eyebrow.
“I’m right here,” said Hari. “You don’t need to talk around me. This Potterwatch— the organization Arthur comes from, yeah? The one you lost touch with, Draco?”
“Oh,” said Amy drily, “is this the part where we learn about the rabid goths that tried to kill us?”
The young woman winced. “Greengrass, actually. Lucius is ready for you any time, so you can go on through. Just knock first.”
“That one’s called a Patronus,” Sirius explained. “We use them to send messages, but the spell was originally designed to create a sort of...er...guardian against Dementors. Which are a type of Dark creature.”
“No I wouldn’t,” Harry agreed. “But then--then he started asking me these questions--” Harry was cut off by the sound of the buzzer.
“Sorry, hold on,” said Draco. He drew his wand, pointed it at the cat, and muttered something, after which Lump promptly leapt off of him and into Amy’s arms. “I had to use a Sticking Charm to carry him and Apparate both of you at the same time.”
Lily made a gagging noise. That drew a genuine, if nervous, laugh out of Scorpius. They only used those nicknames in front of people they wanted to annoy.
“Yeah.” He sighed. “I know it’s not...healthy to be with someone I don’t fully trust right now. And I think it’s the same for him--I mean, last week he was completely caught up in Tom’s bullshit. It’s all going really fast, and it feels like we can’t control it.”
“We slipped them Canary Creams and hid their wands on the other side of a yard mined with dung bombs while they were distracted,” said Arthur, smiling softly at the memory. “Gave them a taste of their own potions.”
It was amazing, given how different Draco and Tom were from each other, that they both took so much after Malfoy Senior. Lord Malfoy and Tom fixed Harry with matching looks of chilly disapproval.
“Excellent.” Pettigrew slurped more coffee. “After all, I’m sure you can imagine how dangerous it would be to have a social worker within spitting distance of our operation. Especially one as high-profile as Potter.”
Harry left Draco--who was possibly his boyfriend, now?--sleeping in his bed, wondering fondly whether the lout had any respect at all for business hours. Survey said no. He briefly considered wearing Draco’s discarded dress shirt to the meeting with Lord Malfoy, but it was a no go: too long in the sleeves, too tight in the chest. Plus, wrinkled. Instead, he dressed in his own clothes, just as he did for a regular work day. Let Lord Malfoy sneer. He probably would, regardless.
I’m sorry. I realize that this is a serious situation and that you are most likely in distress. I am so used to taking advantage of your vulnerable states (which, to be fair, occur with great frequency) that I was unnecessarily harsh. Let me make it up to you. Join me for lunch. I’ll pay, even though you can afford it, as a gesture of goodwill.
If I said "slow burn" at any point in any previous a/n, y'all can feel free to laugh at me.  I'm not patient.  Here's hoping you aren't either, lovelies!
There was a silence as the two stared at each other from their opposite seats, taking in the enormity of what they had just agreed to. No longer could the whole of it be played off as temporary insanity, or as a hazy dream-come-true. It was real now. It was permanent.
His hereditary peerage in the House of Lords, Draco figured, was subject to a vote amongst the other peers, so if he disgraced himself enough by the time his father passed it on, he could conceivably be voted out. That, along with excessive martini consumption and the occasional
“Can you,” said Harry, relishing the heavy sarcasm on his tongue. (The Dursleys hadn’t approved of sarcasm).
“I have to agree with Hermione,” said Harry. “I don’t need any further reminders of how stupid I’ve been, thanks.”
To hide his fashionista's disgust with the whole situation, he leaned in to nibble at Harry’s hip as he slowly pulled the pants down. Not till he felt Harry step out of them entirely did he risk a glance at Harry’s bobbing cock, and then, once that had distracted him thoroughly from all sartorial musings, Harry’s face. Parted lips, glazed eyes. Harry was down. Deep. Almost too deep for the circumstances.
Neither Amy or Harry was entirely sure what was going on, but both were fairly certain Draco was being snobby. Draco calmed their raised hackles by continuing.
They were at Lavender Brown’s graduation party. It was technically for all of them, but since more than half of their year had never returned to school, it wasn’t really about graduation.
“The working theory,” said Draco, “is that whatever accident that led to the Dark Lord’s--er--sabbatical, attacked Harry’s magic, taking it but sparing his life.”
Hermione would probably warn him that it was self-aggrandizing, but Harry couldn’t help but feel that kids--just,
“But how did she find you?” Sirius wondered. “You were hiding in the Muggle world, yeah? I can’t imagine she’d blend in much there.”
If you become too terribly frustrated with my infrequent updates, may I suggest my other ongoing story, 'The Means of Destruction'? In it, Harry is a Squib and I am even more heavy-handed with my class analysis. I'd love to see you there!
“I’ll hold you to it,” Ginny said sternly, and went downstairs. Harry smiled. All the Weasleys were so much like Molly. They had all mastered
Thanks for your continued support!  I've had some lovely comments and I really appreciate all of you.  Really, it means a lot to me.  Things are going well, the next chapter is started, and posting should be a bit more regular going forward.
,” said Draco, “My Harry is a jewel beyond price. You, on the other hand…” Draco looked Vernon up and down. “Well, let’s just say you couldn’t pay
Draco nodded solemnly. “Your dad, James Potter, came from a Pureblood family like mine--well, all right, not like mine, but old and wealthy nonetheless. Your mum was Muggleborn, as I suppose you might have guessed. Those troglodytes were relatives of hers, were they not?”
“Tom,” said Draco, affecting exasperation when all he really felt was mounting nausea, “don’t play stupid. You’re a clever chap. Don’t expect me to believe you’ve been stringing me along all these years without knowing what you were doing. I knew what you were doing, and I was the one being strung.”
“Yeah, we’re not like that,” Harry mumbled, curling up with his nose against Lump’s forehead and reaching for Amy’s hand. “Both bottoms.”
“Boy!” Vernon spluttered, at the same time Petunia--who, Harry faintly registered, was standing nearby--hissed, “Potter!”
“There is a Concern,” Pettigrew announced, followed by another dramatic pause. Draco waved him on carelessly, and he deflated just a bit. “About a Conflict of Interest,” he continued.
Fingers ran through Harry’s hair in a gesture that was both comforting and attention-grabbing. Harry looked up to meet his boyfriend’s eyes.
But when they had fallen onto that bed for the first time, Harry had seen nothing at all, eyes closed as Draco pulled his jumper over his head, then unbuttoned his shirt, kissing his chest as it was exposed.
Harry smiled as he imagined Draco here, imagined his teasing, imagined his silver eyes set off by the gray canopy behind him. This led to him thinking of Draco as he was the previous night, on top of him, fighting for control and just barely keeping it, and then only because Harry wanted him to have it. He thought of how Draco had locked his flat door behind them and then, in a flash, had Harry against some wall, he didn’t know which, kissing and nipping at his neck as he moved them, slowly and dizzily, toward the bedroom. Draco’s bed screamed “wealthy bachelor,” with black satin sheets and a beige-and-cream striped duvet, tastelessly combined but probably quite expensive and trendy. Harry didn’t have a chance to notice this till later, when Draco had stepped away to the loo, and it made him laugh, because Draco probably considered himself the epitome of good taste. And what would Harry know? As if Hermione and Ginny and even Ron and Mrs. Weasley hadn’t more or less coached him on appropriate decorating choices ever since he got his own flat.
“I don’t like that,” said Sirius. “I may have a way to get in touch with...the right people to investigate that.”
“I’m afraid I’ve no idea who you mean,” Draco admitted at last, “but if you inform me, I’m sure the Concern can be addressed.”
Welcome back! The Plot seems to be here to stay, but don't worry; I have determined not to allow it to take over the story of our boys' interpersonal ineptitude, which, after all, is the true star of this show.
And then Draco’s head fell into his hands and his shoulders started shaking. Apparently it was a day for crying.
Draco swallowed against the nausea that rose in him at the sight of Tom’s hurt expression. There was a large part of him that wanted to believe Tom. It would feel so good to hear those words, if they were sincere. “
“I can’t let you--” Harry’s objection was cut off by the appearance of their waiter, who presented Draco with a bottle of wine. He tasted it, then nodded for it to be poured into his and Harry’s glasses. Harry watched in open astonishment.
of us. I wasn’t really worried about my diet, either, aside from getting my hands on something to eat in the first place.” All of Sirius’ attention was on Harry now, the stove ignored.
“No, My Lord,” said Pettigrew hurriedly. “I merely worry that the boy is being irresponsible with your valuable time, My Lord.”
Harry went to calm Amy down, as she was still laughing hysterically, and Draco spoke to Sirius in a low voice.
Lucius curled his lip. “Yes, Draco. Your mother and I, and the entirety of Wizarding Britain, are well aware of your
Harry said nothing, but nodded again, so Draco fell to it, continuing to unbutton Harry’s shirt--and if he was a little rough with the mass-produced monstrosity of a garment, maybe loosening one or two of those buttons, maybe popping a seam as he untucked the shirt from Harry’s trousers--well, who was there to notice it or to blame him? Anyway, he was happy enough to buy a replacement.
“I’ve got us each a chocolate croissant,” Pansy announced, thrusting a paper bag at him. “I thought, if the situation is really as dire as you claimed, we might as well both get fat.”
Kingsley was nearly back to his office before Harry realized he wanted to talk to him, so he ran after him.
Leave it to Al to see how nervous Scorpius was, even in the chaos of a train compartment full of friends.
“No need for that,” said Dumbledore, patting the boy’s back awkwardly and firmly reminding himself that, while there is no appropriate time to notice a student’s attractiveness, it is especially inappropriate to do so when that student is sobbing into one’s arms.
“Good boy,” said Kingsley. Harry ducked his head to conceal his blush at the memories of last night those words conjured.
“Here we are,” said Theo, bringing him around the corner to a heavy, cramped little door straight off Guillermo del Toro’s cutting room floor. When Theo opened the door, Draco was assaulted with a buzzing gray light and a smell of manila.
“I mean it, Draco.” Harry looked pained. “I really don’t want to be here. I don’t--it’s not fun for me, all right? This is not a
“Rather not.” Draco grimaced. “It would be like my father to handle the affair internally as much as is possible, so he may be seeking some assurance of your non-interference.”
“Well, that’s an entirely inappropriate question to be asking at this hour,” said Draco. “Have you got a spare room, Sirius? I think perhaps we should let them sleep while we catch each other up to speed.”
“Squibs can see things Muggles can’t,” Draco informed him distractedly. Then he waved his wand in a complicated pattern and muttered something in what Harry supposed was French. It was kind of hot, Draco muttering in French with his arse on display as he leaned toward the door. Then Draco reached out and opened the door, and Harry wasn’t thinking about anyone’s arse any more.
Draco was surprised--if Tom wasn’t taking the time to equivocate, he must be truly upset. Draco didn’t recall ever having the power to upset Tom like this before.
A smile was creeping onto Harry’s face before he could stop it. “You’ve met him. That just might work. Stun him temporarily, at least.”
And then, almost entirely unaware of his own actions, Harry had slammed Draco against the wall and started kissing him. Draco had made a tiny squeaking sound and fell still for a moment, but soon melted into Harry with a sigh that sounded like relief, wrapping his arms around his neck and giving him everything. And that was the moment everything started making sense. It was the most turned on Harry had ever been, but that wasn’t the whole of it. There was, surprisingly, comfort in touching Draco. It was right. Between the two of them, everything fell together.
“I know you don’t want me to meet with him,” said Harry, a little more gently. “A large, probably more sensible part of me doesn’t want to, either. But why do you think
“Yes, I believe we have established that. However, I believe it would be wisest, at this time, to allow events to unfold. Perhaps attempt to get to know Mr. Malfoy. Challenge yourself to find the good in him.”
“You and Draco are moving too fast,” she said, cringing in anticipation of an indignant response that didn’t come.
“I thought that was because we were all a bunch of mudbloods and blood traitors?” Hermione asked with no small edge of hostility.
“High praise indeed,” said Sirius, a charming smile starting to emerge. “Does he have a bit of kneazle in him? Or is he just a muggle cat with good taste?”
After a long moment, Narcissa cleared her throat. “If you’re both quite finished.” Both men looked at the floor sheepishly. “There is the small matter of how to go on from here.”
“Ah well,” said Luna mildly. “I’ve always been partial to love, but I suppose happiness isn’t for everybody.”
“I mean that affectionately,” Ginny carried on as if Harry hadn’t spoken, “but when it comes to this sort of thing, you and Draco are both morons. I was witness to six of your seven years of inept pigtail-pulling, so I know a thing or two about this. Collectively, you have the emotional intelligence of a rhinoceros with sunstroke. I’m not saying this to discourage you, of course. I just...you two can’t do things the normal way. So don’t try.”
“Don’t be absurd, Scorpius,” said his father, “such a relation would be no impediment. Purebloods, after all, are no strangers to incest.”
Yes, Harry was a criminal, Draco told himself as he knelt to untie Harry’s shoes. So gentle, so pliant he was as Draco pulled off his socks and brought his trousers down, leaving Harry in his shorts, which were
“Mr. Potter,” oozed a voice Harry had, in his heart of hearts, still somehow hoped never to hear again. “So pleased I could get in touch with you. We have matters to discuss.”
So, like any Weasley would, he stayed to observe. Sirius was fighting the results of a neglected Facadio charm. Arthur smiled; he had seen a few of those in his day. Sirius seemed to have forgotten the trick of it, though, judging by the increasingly ridiculous jinxes he was throwing at the animate cupboard.
Voldemort chuckled indulgently. “Patience, Draco,” he said. “Perhaps, in time, as a reward for a well-executed mission.”
For one thing, they were spectacularly in love. To the exclusion, it would become clear, of all else. The passion had been there since they first met. The affection was new, and it was delicious.
“Harry--” he began, but cut himself off when a shout was heard in the doorway and a jet of bright green light zipped over his shoulder, narrowly missing Amy’s head before blasting a hole in the wall.
By this point Draco had approached one of the goblins and was exchanging words with him in smooth, businesslike French. Amy didn’t say anything, but her wide eyes said to Harry,
“No,” Harry agreed. “When I do, everyone always comments on how it brings out my eyes. It’s bloody annoying.”
“I’ve known Harry was alive for less than a month,” Draco added. “I haven’t been able to re-establish contact with the Order in the past year or so, and we were under some pressure to exit the country with haste, so I brought him here.”
The blond raised his eyebrows, but stepped aside and waved the next person on. Harry quickly lost himself in taking orders, giving pleasant smiles, letting his fingers fly over keys they knew by heart. This was the part he didn’t mind so much about his job--when he could go on autopilot and just forget. It wasn’t a happy feeling, exactly, but it was much better than most of the feelings he had experienced in his life.
Molly, still holding Harry at arm’s length, nodded decisively. “Dinner,” she said, “this Sunday. You’ll bring your young man.”
“That’s the problem,” said Harry. “I think he’d tell the world to fuck itself. I think he’d kill half of England himself to keep me.”
Hermione elbowed Ron, who winced. Harry looked at his four friends’ inquisitive faces. He took a moment to flirt with the idea of not telling them, but he’d never get away with that. And, if he was honest with himself, he needed their help.
of me. They like my dramatic sob story. They like my work, some of them. The older ones, they liked my parents, or Uncle Albus. Ain’t me.”
“Ah.” Harry reached over toward Amy to scratch between Lump’s ears. The unflappable cat was half-asleep in her arms, purring lightly. An awkward silence settled as they waited for Silvertooth to return.
“It just makes me wonder. Draco was fucking Tom the whole time, right? I wonder...he couldn’t have been like this with Tom, right? Tom wouldn’t...I mean…”
“I didn’t want to assume,” said Draco. “You know Death Eaters. She could’ve been describing anybody.”
“Indeed,” said Draco. “I’d like you to come to my pub to collect it, as I don’t fancy risking my neck to visit whatever slum you frequent.”
“Hello,” said Arthur cheerfully, though he pointed his wand at Sirius. “What was the first thing you said to me after you were released from Azkaban?”
Pettigrew ignored this. “Anyway, I saw Potter looking at the other boys, especially Weasley. In the unlikely event that he has interest in women, it is not an exclusive interest.”
“You think I—” Ron cut off abruptly, took a deep breath. Instead of yelling, he said, “I don’t see how that’s relevant.”
“Well,” said Dumbledore. “I do have one idea.” The Headmaster was, in fact, proud of himself for thinking of it. It was an excellent rationalization for why he was unable to tear his eyes off the Malfoy boy.
“And remember, please, if you will, that I’m your only son and heir. Just, remember that before you react.”
“Yes, Potter, do try to keep up. Against my better judgment, I have agreed to your preposterous proposal.”
Still. As one of Harry’s most enduring obsessions, Draco didn’t like being supplanted. He needed, at least, to know Harry still had him in mind. Since he wasn’t getting replies to any of his attempts to start banal conversations, he decided to play dirty, as was his wont.
“Yes,” said Draco patiently, “but that doesn’t mean she’s told him. Of course, I suspect she has, but even then, he may not believe it.”
“Well, yes, you see,” said Draco smoothly, “I can use this apparent change of heart to my advantage and worm my way into the inner circle of Gryffindors at school. Within a month, I plan to be fucking Dumbledore’s golden boy. This will establish Dumbledore’s trust, while that trust itself will be my in with Potter. You get a crafty intelligencer established amongst people close to Dumbledore, plus renewed funding, and I get the finest arse in—well, in all of Scotland, at least, I think that’s fair to say.”
“It should have been,” said Draco. “You’ve had a shock, though. I’ll tell you now. I met Harry at a Muggle tea shop. Where he worked.”
“Have I?” Draco was nonplussed. He’d thought this meeting was about Harry, but apparently not. Apparently it was about someone with Competing Interests. Which, on the one hand, could be almost anyone he knew (except Harry). But on the other hand, it depended on what one meant by “associating.” While he spent a lot of time socializing, Draco wasn’t one for close friends, and aside from Tom, he rarely even fucked the same person twice.
Harry didn’t need to be looking at Tom to see his eyes flash, to see the way his lips tightened in warning to Draco. He knew that, if he played it right, he could allow Draco to distract Tom until Harry was able to make his escape. He also knew that he didn’t want to do that to Draco. But what were his other options? Would he even be able to act with this malignant presence looming over him, with his throat choked with rage and fear? Harry had never been a coward. He was Harry Potter. It was known across London that a home visit from Harry Potter meant a child in safe hands and an abusive guardian jailed. A magazine local to his own neighborhood had dubbed Harry the “Defender of London’s Innocent.” Well, Draco was hardly innocent, but that was the thing about Harry. He’d defend pretty much anyone. It was the principle of the thing; abuse wouldn’t be allowed to stand. He couldn’t let it, couldn’t let himself be like his primary school teachers or even Uncle Albus. And so Harry swallowed hard, and tried to convince himself he could handle Tom.
Apparently he hissed it louder than he’d intended, as he looked up to see the whole cafe staring at him, including his manager, Eric, who had been speaking with the tip-revoking woman from earlier.
“You put the only copy of a picture of your sainted parents in a locket you were borrowing from your
“Ah, you know her,” said Harry. “Yeah, she didn’t exactly go out of her way to educate me on my heritage. If she had, I think her husband’s fists would have fallen on
“Nonsense. I’m still an Englishman.” Draco tapped his cigarette over the ashtray, and Tom shook his head.
side, weren’t you?” Harry realized suddenly. “This Voldemort? You talk like a friend of ours, Davy, who used to be a skinhead. He still says really shitty things sometimes when he’s not watching himself.”
Without his permission Harry’s eyes shot to Neville, who looked placid, in his element, with dirt under his nails and fuzzy earmuffs around his neck. Neville only smiled--his tiny postwar smile--and nodded.
“Harry!” Sirius greeted, looking at him with affectionate awe. “You’re up. Good. Loo’s over there, if you want to clean up a bit.”
“Your plan,” said Voldemort thoughtfully, “seems to rely rather heavily on your charms and Potter’s predilections.”
“Make up your mind,” said Draco. “Murderous stalker or caring acquaintance? I need to know if you’re going to stab me or light my cigarette, and the suspense is killing me.”
Ron sat down across from him with two fresh beers, and slid one over to Harry in spite of his full firewhiskey.
“Interesting,” said Draco, following Theo to an out-of-the-way elevator. “Rather the opposite of the arrangement between my father and I.”
Stay strong, all! I hope to hear from you with comments, concerns, or, if you like, completely unrelated tangents. I'm trapped indoors, after all, and my roommate will insist on learning the euphonium.
“Malfoy and Riddle,” she said. Harry thought for a moment, drinking the dregs of his tea-flavored booze.
“Well, it wasn’t a normal murder. There are other families who died by the Dark Lord’s hand, though it was rare enough as he usually sent one of his Death Eaters to do his dirty work.”
Dobby pulled up and let Draco in the car, avoiding eye contact. He snickered, and watched his mobile.
“I understand,” said Draco politely, though inwardly he bristled at Dr. Pince’s attitude, which seemed rather to demand deference than offer it.
because he was there,” Harry pointed out. Then added, “I think. I mean, I don’t know spells, but she
“Have we all dined?” Draco asked, placing his knife and fork next to each other meticulously in what Harry supposed was one of those mysterious upper-class rituals meant to send messages to silent servants. “Good. We have more to discuss.”
“We Slytherins tend to hedge our bets.” They returned to the sitting area to find Arthur had busied himself with preparing a fresh pot of tea. Quietly, the three wizards settled in for a long night.
“Watch and learn,” said Draco, because he and Blaise had just reached the entrance of the Great Hall, and his plan was about to go into action.
“You were right,” said Harry conversationally, “Kensington is quite a trek from my neck of the woods.”
Thank you all so much for reading!  I've been thrilled with the response to this so far.  Your comments make me so happy!  I hope you all continue to enjoy, as it only gets weirder from here.
“And an Oxford toff would know about that, would he?” Tom teased. Draco’s cigarette was nearly gone, and he still hadn’t passed it back.
“What’s going on. Right.” Draco looked at Harry, then shook his head in disbelief. “Merlin’s fucking bollocks. I can’t believe this.”
But if Ron thought their passion had burned so brightly that it had proved unsustainable? Well, all the more entertainment for them.
“...standard abusive behavior,” Hermione was muttering. “Really an elaborate form of gaslighting, getting witnesses to claim he meant no harm when…”
“Drink, dear?” Draco eventually asked. Harry nodded. Then, his Gryffindor courage failed him. He waited until his boyfriend’s back was turned, pouring the Firewhisky, to say it.
“I’m confident you’ll grow accustomed to it,” said Draco, hiding his annoyance with a smirk. Harry wasn’t the first Muggle to react to his name in such a way; he supposed their customs were different.
Quick CW (see also additions to tags): mentions of non-consensual medical testing and general robber-baron skulduggery.
Well, Draco wasn’t one for self-denial, even if he did occasionally partake in it to spite others. But this wasn’t Tom. This was Harry, his sweet, earnest, reckless, beloved nemesis, and Draco didn’t
“Harry,” Kingsley interrupted, “I’ve been a social worker for over twenty years.” He came around the desk then and put a fatherly hand on Harry’s shoulder. “I’m not blind. That man has hurt you. He’ll never be welcome here. Know that we’ll do what we can to keep you safe.”
“I never wanted to stand out,” said Harry. The conversation was making him increasingly uncomfortable. He took a gulp of martini, trying to focus on the burn of it in his throat. But Draco’s poncy vodka was so smooth it wasn’t much distraction. Bastard.
The response was almost immediate, confirming Harry’s suspicion that Draco wasn’t getting any work done today, either. But then, Harry wasn’t quite sure if Draco
“Look,” said Harry, “I get it. I don’t expect anyone to just forgive him overnight. Some days I’m not really sure even I have. I just...I hoped...I dunno. I sound pathetic.”
“Have you heard anything from him?” Ginny asked when they were finished, “Your ferret-in-shining-armor?”
“Right,” said Draco resignedly. “Don’t suppose I can fall back asleep now, anyway. Say hi to Uncle Sev for me.”
Hesitantly, Harry nodded. Sirius approached cautiously, as if Harry were a horse he was afraid to spook, and the moment his arms wrapped around him, Harry found himself returning the embrace, clinging, shaking a little. Being touch-starved his entire childhood had made Harry incredibly fond of physical affection, but this felt different. It was warm and steady in a way he hadn’t ever really experienced.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’ve been busy with--well, you know what with! But we can argue later, if that’s what you want to do. I just wanted to ask if you’d meet me at mine tonight.”
And Draco had to admit to himself that, drama queen though he may be, Tom always knew how to cut him to the quick. Sighing, he stubbed out his cigarette and called Pansy.
Ron sat down, wearing the smug expression he always did when he saw an opportunity to offer romantic advice ‘from the perspective of a married man.’ Luna was nodding serenely, Ginny’s eyes alight with the intent to mock him mercilessly. Hermione, though, had caught on.
“Maybe. I’m really surprised by him. And, weird as it is, I find him kind of comforting. We’ve been through a lot of the same things, even if we experienced them differently. I’ve known him a long time. It’s true that it’s only recently that I started to consider that a good thing, but now I do. I like him, Gin. I’m trying not to think too much about it. But what if we could be good for each other?”
“Charming,” said Draco. “Just when I thought my girlish figure was all I had going for me.” He reached in and took out his croissant, immediately stuffing it into his mouth.
“Both plans achieved,” said the stag. “Will floo over after breakfast. Much to discuss. Potters send love.” Then the creature vanished.
“Well, Sirius,” said Arthur, “I should very much like an explanation of this situation, if you have one to offer.”
“Aye.” Hagrid looked proudly at his dog. “Fang’s nasty in a pinch. ‘E bloodied Trog more’n half to death. Jus’ not all the way.” Hagrid sipped his ale. “Nursed ‘im back myself, I did. Thought ‘e was a goner for a while there. Almos’ gave up. But ‘e found summat in him--summat that kept ‘im fightin’. It wasn’ a nice summat.”
“So who is it? Obviously it’s not Weasley, and not even you would be daft enough to try and split up Thomas and Finnegan.”
,” Harry repeated. “I think it’s part of why no one can forgive him. He protects his own at the cost of everything else. He told me...he hates Voldemort, and he regrets everyone who suffered because of him, but...he wouldn’t change what he did. Said it was to protect his family.” Harry put his head in his hands. “I shouldn’t have understood that as well as I did. Is there something wrong with me?”
, Draco thought gleefully. What he said was, “Thank you, My Lord. Your time and patience are much appreciated. Luckily, the plan is simple enough, so I will be brief.”
“Forgive me, I’m not terribly experienced with these things,” said the blond. “When one works...that workday does
“But how?” Sirius asked, voice cracking. “How can it have been secret? Hogwarts, at least--the Book would have had to register magical activity--how--?”
When they were in the cab, Harry took a moment to send a quick text to Draco (having exchanged numbers with him on his way out the door that morning).
“Right, you lot. I think it’s time for a meeting of the Ex-Hets Club. Clear out. Ron, I’ll bring him to dinner, don’t worry.”
“Get down!” Draco shouted at the other two as he drew his wand and stood. In the doorway was a woman with wild dark curls and a maniacal gleam in her eye.
The jeweler spent Saturday on their rings. He was a busy man, but the Malfoys were his best customers, and Harry and Draco had not asked any elaborate workmanship of him.
As soon as he was there, he buzzed and buzzed, muttering to himself, “Please be home, you smarmy bint, be home, please…” So immersed was he in his muttering that he nearly fell over from surprise when the building’s door opened.
“More tea?” he requested of Sirius, silently begging him for a distraction. And Sirius, bless him, caught on easily enough.
“We all look a little the worse for wear, I think,” Draco mused. “There are a few charms I can use--they freshen clothes, get the wrinkles out, that sort of thing. Would you mind if I used them on you?”
Harry looked down, fighting furious tears, as he walked toward the managers’ shared office. He really didn’t want to see the blond man’s face right now. Or Amy’s, for that matter.
Sorry for the long wait on this one.  It's the magic of depression!  I've had this one for a while, but didn't want to put it up till I knew where I was going next, in case of changes.  Now, with the next chapter almost complete, we are ready to proceed.  This one's a bit short, and the next one's a bit long, but I like to think they're both satisfying in their own way.
“All right,” Harry said. “You want to talk to me, Tom? Let’s step outside. You can talk to me freely then.”
“Yes, well, I was no more forewarned than you were, ta very much. We are, I should say, equally humiliated in this, you and I.”
The bartender did indeed bring their drinks, placing a martini in front of Draco before setting down Harry’s scotch. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“I can’t believe it. Harry. I can’t fucking believe it. You were dead--Dumbledore said so--everybody thought--I mean everybody
“Don’t play dumb!” Harry exclaimed. “You offered to pay me to go on a date with you. What did you think you were doing?”
Hello there! I am not dead, and neither is this fic! In fact, you'll notice I've finished outlining and now officially know how many chapters there are going to be...unless I change my mind.
Bill had said, “Now, Ginny, there’s no need for nasty insinuations like that. Harry is family. Let’s try to be civil.”
“You look grim,” Hermione observed, sitting down next to him with her cuppa and obscenely vegetable-ridden sandwich.
There was a town car outside Draco’s building. Black, very black, with impenetrable tinted windows. There were two people likely to be in that car, neither of whom Draco wanted to see now, as he stumbled out of his apartment in the heavy late-morning light, sex-addled and seeking brunch. But of the two possibilities, his father was by far the worse prospect.
“No. Not really. I mean--yeah, some things about it bother me. Being cheated on bothers me. But it doesn’t feel like something Draco did. When I think about it, I’m almost more bothered at the thought of him being with Tom from his perspective. It makes me...I dunno, worry about him.”
“No,” said Harry with a quirk of his eyebrow, “I rather figured two world wars had been enough for Britain.”
“It’s because I’m contemplating that monstrosity you’re eating,” said Harry. “If that’s the consequences of being vegetarian, count me out.”
“Scorpius,” he said cheerfully, “it’s good to see you as well. Your father tells me you’ve been excelling in classes this term.”
“Still weird as hell,” said Ginny cheerfully. “He’s a nice enough bloke, I like his company, but t’be honest, I’m still not sure I really
Amy was beginning to tear up, so she awkwardly held her cat in front of her face to hide that. Harry looked around. Silvertooth appeared vaguely disgusted with the emotional display, while Draco was staring at him with an odd expression.
“To recap,” Draco said, looking up, “you have been welcomed back into the Weasley family by your bitch of an adoptive mother”—
Arthur look flummoxed. “I--I couldn’t say. Rather beyond me to keep track of that sort of thing, what with seven of them running around.”
“I dunno,” Harry sighed. “I just...I don’t know if I’ll live through the end of the year, I’m never sure, and I’ve been thinking about what I’ve done, and what I still want to do.”
“Why did Tom give you the locket?” Draco asked, leaning in slightly, betraying the intensity of his interest.
“That’s not fair,” Harry growled. “What was I supposed to do, with you standing so close and speaking in my ear? If I short-circuited and blurted something stupid out, you can’t blame me.”
“Says he’s worried I’m working too hard. That I always work too hard when there’s n--when there’s no one to--”
Draco gave a small smile and squeezed Harry’s hand, hard. Garnet, the stone of passionate devotion, was as durable as it was binding.
“Simple, at least from my perspective. To spend what I believed would be an enjoyable evening with a person who interested me, and to remove all obstacles to that goal.”
“That’s the mystery,” Draco said thoughtfully. “I haven’t had much time to think it over myself, but I have a few guesses. You’ve never done magic, have you? Made anything happen that you couldn’t explain?”
For a moment, Draco stilled. Then he reached up and began to stroke Harry’s hair. They were silent for a while.
“Of course you can,” said Sirius. “I was there for your first bout! You were a prodigy, Harry. You got so excited about your first birthday cake that you set fireworks off all around the dining room. Real fire! Singed Moony’s moustache--thanks for that, by the way, you got him to do what I never could, shaved the thing off that very night--Harry, I know who you are. I bought you your first broom!”
She huffed, creating a loud crackle of feedback on the line. “You as good as told Riddle we have something on him.”
, who had set a man on fire and imprisoned a woman without trial. Somehow he didn’t think her capable of such morbid comprehension, even knowing for a fact that she was.
“That can be dangerous, though,” Hermione said to Luna, ignoring Ginny. “Sex can create affectionate feelings that aren’t necessarily warranted. In some cases, that’s why--”
,” said Draco firmly. Sirius sat, taking a sparsely padded seventeenth century armchair across from the settee. With a huff, Amy sank onto the settee next to Draco. Lump, by all appearances just as tired from sleeping in Amy’s arms as she was from carrying him, oozed onto her lap and passed out belly-up. Harry stayed standing.
There was a pause, during which Amy examined the artfully stacked skulls and bones with horrified fascination. Then there was a patter of feet as she caught up with the other two.
Draco couldn’t help but smile when his floo rang. It was the maitre’d of Tricolore, who, though a Muggle, had a witch for a sister and therefore catered to Muggle and Wizarding clientele alike. He smiled at Draco and told him his guest had arrived. After waiting fifteen minutes to make his response time believable to a Muggle, Draco walked into the restaurant, scanning the place as he handed his coat to the hostess.
“And I meant what I said before,” replied Harry, raising his voice again. “I won’t prostitute myself, not for anything. And I won’t
“No matter,” sad Draco. “My point is, you wouldn’t be famous at all if the Dark Lord had survived the encounter with you.”
“Right, the maitre’d who was a good bloke was calling the cops on Vernon and Petunia I think or he was threatening to, and I hid in the loo and Draco went in there to check that I was all right, which was sweet, I mean if it’d been me I think I’d have fucking run--”
“This is no time to joke!” Draco protested. “D’you know how long I’ve been flying confunded on this? I need to know--”
“He will,” said Theo firmly. “Dr. Pince, meet Draco Malfoy. Draco will require all of the files on the D.E.P. collaboration, a notepad, a pen, and a good deal of time. In return, Draco, Dr. Pince will require absolute silence and a great deal of care to be taken not to muss the papers.”
He looked up and couldn’t believe his eyes. For the first time since he had turned eighteen, Harry was looking into the splotchy purple face of his uncle Vernon.
Harry wanted to bang his head on the table. It was a moment before he could bring himself to speak again.
It is incredible how quickly one can shop for engagement rings in a world that contains the Re-Sizing Charm. On Thursday, Harry and Draco buried themselves in books, choosing gemstones for each other’s rings at guess-whose insistence. Draco, of course, was well versed in the symbolism of every stone imaginable, but seemed to enjoy re-reading legends, and pointing out the meanings of difference cuts and the histories of famous jewels to Harry.
“Harry, love,” he said, stroking Harry’s cheek, “you with me?” Harry nodded. “All right then. Color?” Harry blinked. “Harry, I need a color or we can’t go on.”
Harry returned to his apartment, sitting down in his creaky armchair and opening the envelope. There was a single sheet of paper inside, written on in impeccable calligraphy. Harry scoffed, then read:
Draco was interrupted by Amy’s slowly rising hysterical laughter. Harry simply sat back, looking gobsmacked.
Her attention was probably the only reason he hadn’t had any sort of mental breakdown (born of fear or frustration) amidst his research. He had a distressing inkling that something criminal was afoot, but unfortunately, the style of the project notes was utterly incomprehensible to anyone without a Ph.D. in chemistry.
. With a suction-cup noise, a door popped into existence--a squat cupboard-door that made Harry shudder. The door opened, and the flying objects were sucked into its dark depths. Once everything was inside, the cupboard sealed itself and disappeared.
The boys are back in town, and by "the boys" I mean me. Welcome to another chapter of rapidly escalating socialist nonsense. So glad you could be here for it.
Looking into the hate-filled faces of the man and woman who had supposedly 'raised' him, Harry forgot all the pithy remarks he’d stored up during sleepless nights, the stinging and witty things he’d have liked to say if he ever saw them again. Now that he was in their presence, he couldn’t say a word.
“Oh.” Draco straightened, revealing that his arms had been wrapped around the cat in question. “Appropriate name. He’s deuced heavy.”
“Er,” said Harry, “None that I’m aware of, so I really have no idea what heinous sin you think I’ve committed.”
Ginny never needed it explained. As much as he wallowed in earth, she spat fire. Soon, all that was left of them was smoke.
The wall melted away into a high, open archway, revealing a gorgeous entrance hall, all columns and arches in white stone. It was fairly empty, except for a few short men in immaculate suits. Harry supposed these men--guards, were they?--were the goblins Draco had mentioned, what with their pointy ears and such. They were certainly intimidating, height aside.
“Did you.” Draco looked up conspicuously, taking in the winter sun as it limned the city rooftops. “Lovely day. Crisp.”
. I--I just froze, Amy, I didn’t know what to do. I felt like I was five years old again, like he was going to lock me in my cupboard. Sorry, I mean, I was just scared of him.”
So Draco did. He told Harry about meeting up with Pettigrew--a name that made Harry hiss, having inherited an unexplained hatred for his godfather’s ex-friend--and about the suspicions it stirred. Then he described his journey to the Malfoy Corporation labs for research.
“Of course, yes,” said Draco lazily. “You would, of course, know better about people’s uses than I. You being a Lord and all, or rather,
“What if my parents had stopped inviting me to Christmas when I told them I didn’t want to be a dentist?”
“I’m a loose cannon,” he muttered, earning a disapproving look from the dignified elderly waiter who was at that moment bringing his food. He merely nodded to his empty glass and dug in.
Draco looked askance at Harry. If he himself were in Harry’s position, he knew he’d have clung to any excuse to be near Tom, even if it were just to lurk on his balcony. Not that Draco would ever lurk. He was far too well bred for that.
“I was in my office, doing paperwork, when in comes Tom. Holding a cup of coffee. Which he hands over to me. Claims he just wanted to say hello.”
Except that things were irrevocably changed, because this was real, and Draco didn’t want to deny Harry anything. He wasn’t sure he was capable of it any more. So he gave in to Harry’s desires, and his own, cupping Harry’s face in his hand and stroking the cheekbone with his thumb.
“Lads,” said Amy. “D’you think you can geek out later? Maybe wizards live differently, but me and Harry need to eat sometime tonight.”
“This is my only one, so Harry, if you want to take my room--” but Harry and Amy were already climbing into bed together.
“Look, I know you’re not going to—abandon me or anything.” Harry furrowed his brow. That had come out sounding like an accusation. “Really, I do, I mean, that wasn’t a jab at you or anything—”
“Shame,” said a posh voice, practically in his ear. “That poor child has been corrupted for life by a single overheard word, and all while it’s still in the larval stage. You must be mortified.”
“It’s all right,” he said lightly. “The curiosity will kill me if I don’t humor him. Watch my sandwich carefully, will you? That woman with the salad looks peckish, I don’t want her getting ideas.” With that Harry got up to follow Draco out of the restaurant, imagining how Ron would grin at his comment and Hermione would don her usual fondly exasperated look.
“Sorry,” he said, “thoughtless of me. You wanted jam and Devonshire cream with that?” The irate woman nodded. Harry slapped processed packages of jam and cream onto the plate with the greasy scone and said, “There you are. Your latte will be right out.”
“Fuck,” said Draco when he saw the room, “if I’d known you were sleeping in this wet dream of a bed every night, I’d’ve locked us both in here weeks ago.”
He stumbled to the toilet, then took a painkiller and went back into his room. Finding his phone was dead, he set it to charge before pulling on a shirt and heading downstairs.
“Will he?” wondered a raspy Scottish voice from the shadows. There were footsteps, and a face emerged. Draco barely restrained his shock. With her tight bun, tweed suit, rigid posture, and strong accent, this woman could be Professor McGonagall’s maiden aunt.
Harry turned to find what he assumed was an escaped character from an E.M. Forster novel leaning over the counter. The man was about Harry’s age, but that was where their similarity ended. He was tall, angular, and coiffed, with pale blond hair and cutting grey eyes. His clothes looked expensive, but there were no designer labels on him, no lavish wristwatch or anything else to announce his wealth, other than his voice and his posture. He was classy, this bloke, but there was not an ounce of modesty in him. Harry wanted him at once.
“You stopped what you were doing in the middle of a fight to secure a cat to your person?” Amy asked.
Cautiously, Harry took another bite and tried not to make any sound at all. Judging by the look on Draco’s face, he hadn’t succeeded.
“Then thank your little Gryffindor gods I wasn’t there,” Draco had said. “If I’d heard heard the lout speak that way about you, I’m fairly certain I’d have hexed his balls off. Still might, come to think of it.”
They stared at each other. It was a battle of wills. After a long moment, Scorpius’ father inclined his head slightly, conceding. Then he lifted an elegant hand, directing the decanter to refill both their snifters.
A heavy sigh, and Harry girded his loins. He’d have to face these strangers, and this strange world, again at some point. Might as well be now.
“Obviously,” Lucius scoffed, apparently feeling that Harry’s lack of grace excused him from his own usually cool manners.
“Don’t tell Hermione about the rats,” said Harry. “She’ll have you in an animal rights suit faster than you can say ‘
“Harry was raised in the Muggle world,” Draco informed the goblin. “As far as we can tell, he is a squib--he was able to see the back door, but has never shown any signs of having magic of his own. Until recently, he was entirely ignorant to the existence of the Wizarding world and, therefore, to the existence of his inheritance.”
“I want to talk to them,” Hari said firmly. “I don’t doubt Amy will want to be with us for that. And neither of us is going anywhere without Lump. So, it’s looking like a family outing, yeah?”
“Look,” said Harry, dunking his hobnob aggressively into his tea, “You can make fun of me later, God knows I’d do the same in your position, but for now will you lot help me figure out what the
I now know better than to promise another chapter soon, but the next one is already in the works and I'm pretty excited about it.  Boozy lunch is gonna be ~spicy~.  Your attention feeds me.  Thanks for reading, lovelies!
“I just! URGH!” Albus gave the bedframe a tiny kick to let out his impotent rage. “I! Had! Something! To! Tell! You! Too!”
“I mean, I’m not. Obviously. Or maybe not obviously? I suppose it could have been a complete mistake, just a fluke, and we could have ignored it, only now I’ve given myself away, and--” Harry interrupted himself by taking a gulp of whisky. “Please stop me from saying anything else.”
“Yeah,” Harry choked out, and followed him in a daze. Amy warily joined the parade, with Draco bringing up the rear.
“I wonder,” said Lucius, bringing Draco’s attention back to the matter at hand. “You mentioned a failsafe for the plan. Two failsafes, as a matter of fact. What are they?”
“How do you know?” asked the blond. There was a line forming behind him now. Though somewhat aroused, Harry was also annoyed at the man’s attitude, as well as confused about his apparent interest in Harry. So he pointedly looked over the man’s shoulder.
Harry, however. He was coming up on his second Christmas without the Weasleys, and it just didn’t seem like a good idea any more. There was only so much a bloke could give up. He’d thought he’d drawn the line at his life. Apparently there was more to lose. Either way, there was so much to lose.
mushrooms, which meant, of course, that Harry had become quite fond of them. It sounded like a good meal. And Harry wasn’t a person who had had a lot of good meals in his life.
Harry’s jaw dropped a bit. He didn’t know what to do, except to reply that he had work to do and hadn’t the time to faff about on a boozy lunch. Draco pointed out that Harry was probably not getting anything done in his current emotional state. Harry had to admit that he was right. So he agreed to meet Draco at an outrageously expensive place nearby.
“Let me handle it,” said Draco. Harry fixed him with a piercing look. He’d been told by many that he had a good one, learned from Uncle Albus and later, he supposed, from Moody, the grizzled old caseworker who had been his mentor.
“It’s possible,” said Draco with his best posh drawl, his best indifferent expression. “Can you be more specific?”
After his shower, and a quick Google search to find out what the fuck 'apertifs' were supposed to be, Harry found himself able to arrange the dinner with astonishing speed. Hermione demanded to see the notes that very evening, and Draco agreed that he probably wouldn’t sleep again till they’d talked. Harry dressed himself, went shopping, and set to.
Victoire nodded and ran out of the room. Harry gave a small smile. Since the war, Errol had considered himself to be in well-earned retirement, and spent a majority of his days and nights asleep. He was difficult to awaken even for a treat, and therefore of great help in entertaining the youngest Weasleys.
Draco huffed and muttered, clear as a bell, that Harry was uncivilized to keep him standing out of doors like this. Then he said, “I have taken pity on a poor orphan boy. I have the photo.”
“I’ll have a chat with Dr. Pince,” Theo announced, seemingly immune to the oppressive miasma. “We’ll get the proposals, prospectus, all of that. Even the data, such as it is.” He gave Draco a sympathetic look. “You’ll have a pass to stay as late as you need.”
“There you are, you great pillock,” said Ginny. Harry groaned again, remembering suddenly and with a stab of pain that Ginny was a
“I want to know what’s going on!” protested Harry, but it sounded weak even to his own ears. He was so tired.
And, much to the shock of the entire Weasley family and of Harry himself, Harry had socked Bill in the face.
“At your convenience, Lord Malfoy,” he responded with the transparent sarcasm Draco said marked him as incapable of true refinement.
Draco looked shocked and a bit disapproving. With a sigh, Harry pushed his plate away, but Draco shook his head.
“Admit it,” said Harry with a laugh, “you just want to mark your territory in front of Molly and the rest of the Weasleys.”
“Arthur went back to headquarters. Lump is over there.” With a fond smile, Sirius pointed at the settee, where Lump was sprawled over a sleeping Draco. They looked cute together, the sloppy cat and the elegant man, who was so handsome in his sleep, almost delicate…
Harry watched as Amy inched toward the drawer where she kept her pepper spray. But at that moment, Draco muttered some mumbo jumbo and a bunch of birds popped into existence out of thin air. Both stared in shock for a good thirty seconds before Amy pursed her lips.
“Here,” said Ginny firmly, slamming down a mug of hangover potion in front of him. Harry grimaced, but drank, knowing that the sludge (basically a banana milkshake with too much protein powder) actually
“Better to keep a clear head, don’t you think?” Tom said, and began to slide the drink away from Harry. Harry let his hand fall out from under Tom’s, quickly moving it out of his reach when he could.
“I didn’t know what I would have done without you. I still don’t. When you got up, I was so relieved." He finished his pint. "I’ve
“Luna? Lovegood? Are they courting?” Arthur considered it, then shrugged. “I had no idea. But Luna’s always around, so I suppose they must still be an item.”
“Of course I see why it’s hard on them,” said Neville. “I won’t say it was easy on me, either. You know that, mate. But it’s love. It’s not about choosing, and it’s not about who deserves it.”
“Ye know from experience that Fang’s a bloody coward,” Hagrid conceded, “bu’ that’s the thing abou’ cowards. Ye know what ‘appens when ye corner ‘em.”
“Oh yes,” said Pansy tartly, “I’ll just pass on loving greetings to my boss from his godson. Very professional.”
They shushed. When the kettle whistled, Harry made tea. Hermione sipped hers without ever looking up. Harry put both his hands on his mug, trying to keep himself from touching Draco, which would not be helpful at the moment. Neither of them could afford to be distracted.

Ron tried to follow his wife’s directions, squinting and staring at Harry and Draco as if trying to see through them. But before he noticed, Ginny gasped.
