They were in Charms when he found out. Laney was maniacally giggling and having a bit to much fun learning the fire charm, Vince and Greg dutifully pulling books out of the radius as she experimented happily. Draco was watching with no little amount of awe and a healthy dose of fear when Hadrian felt a tap on his shoulder.
The young boy didn’t look much like Snape would have expected at all if he were honest. Alex was the James’ clone he’d hated to see, but his supposed Squib twin looked similar but not the same. He looked more like Lily’s father, with those haunting green eyes. Hair neater than any Potter he’d ever seen. Female Dragma’s hair was wilder than his, bright red hair that looked like a more groomed rat’s nest. A handful, and he just seemed quiet.
“Biologically? No clue. Mama and Mother are aware of magic, Mama has none. Mother might, but she was never schooled and I don’t think she’s ever been interested in pursuing it more than she has already for herself. But both of them worked really hard to work both the wizarding world and the muggle world into our home. Especially when this moron was adopted.” Laney jerked a thumb at him. Hadrian picked up the que.
“Stay still, I need to fix your tie.” Draco was in his space, long and thin pale fingers working at the tie around his neck. Basically sharing the same breath, but Hadrian didn’t want to pull away. It felt warm and comfortable.
Hadrian was shaking back in the back, not as bad as he could of, he had trained restraint and silence in the whirl of hectic emotions. That didn’t mean that he was unaffected internally as his mind spun.
“I’m sure he didn’t mean that. I’m Lily, Alex said that your name is Laney correct?” The curly red head just glared at the older woman quietly, obviously still peeved and unwilling to engage. She shifted her attention to her ex-son before a kind smile blossomed on her face.
“If so why do you always speak for him! He’s got a mouth, but you are always putting words in it for him. Leave him alone!” Obviously the wrong thing to say as Laney became enraged. Eyes burning like a raging fire as she spit out vitrol like it was going out of style.
And there he’d been. Admitting to assaulting James and apperating through the wards.
It couldn’t be happening.
“Ah, Miss Dragma. This is Mr. and Mrs. Potter, and I’m sure you’ve met Alex.” Laney flicked her hair over her shoulder when Alex reached out a hand to shake.
Because they were scared children.
“Oh my dearest brother. My knight in shining armor comes to sweep me off my feet.”
“I can’t believe your whole family’s been Slytherins! That’s pretty cool, if either of our moms went to Hogwarts I probably would want to follow their footsteps too I guess. Is it rare for families to stick to the same houses?” Hadrian politely pressed himself into the conversation as he tuned back in, Draco looked affronted for half a second that someone was interrupting his discussion until he realized who it was. Hadrian idly contemplated the theory that curiosity usually beats annoyance.
-I won’t starve to death waiting
Irregardless of the name loss, accio was an intent spell. And Hadrian could feel it fighting him. Trying to pull him towards James open hand. No! Nononononononono. He was so close. HE WAS TOO FUCKING CLOSE!
Hey guys! I said I wanted your opinion and here I'm asking for it!
That event had some other consequences as well. Laney was perfect one because of her lack of fucks to give and two,
“I gotta use the restroom first.” Mama looked around the hall, it was beginning to wind down, and everything looked safe enough.
“For the goddesses.” Hadrian took the potion like a shot, letting it burn down his throat without really tasting it. He shuddered as he felt it crawl through him, it stung. His fathers were quick to sit him down, Dad was at his back supporting him, while Papa flitted around checking his temperature and smoothing his bangs over. Hadrian curled into his Dad’s arms, it felt so weird, like his skin was vibrating out of his body, but he still held on. It would be over soon, just like his Papa kept whispering into his hair.
Though, with how the day was going. She had little hope for him, she’d thought by the end of the day she’d get her boys to work out their problems and things could go back to how they were once. Peaceful, with Harry and Alex living and balancing each other out. James could have two sons to spoil rotten, losing Harry had been a hard hit. James hadn’t meant to be so hard on the boy Lily was sure. But he had gotten into the bad habit of resenting his brother like Albus had warned them about. That he might be a squib only seemed to heighten the animosity.
were carved in fine cursive across the latch. It took a considerable amount of self-restraint to not burn the thing where it was. Instead, he decided to make the disgusting thing useful and haul it in front of the door. It was light. Empty. Hadrian held back a snarl. At least they hadn’t gotten their grubby hands on his actual trunk, though this certainly was the exact model his parents had bought him.
The circle folded itself to create a small path that Hadrian stumbled out of. The wards were buzzing curiously at him, still recognizing him as well as not really remembering the taste of his individual magic without the family blood. They poked and prodded at him. But as he’d been here so long and still tasted of Lady Magic’s influence, they ultimately left him alone. The raven grinned, bloody and victorious.
Lily’s grasp tightened on her ladle. How was she supposed to have known that her sister abandoned her son? She never called or sent post anymore and Albus had said they were family and Harry was sure to be safe there. Not in danger from wizards there, in danger of being Alex’s twin brother.
“Sounds about right! It’s a pleasure to meet you Mr. Malfoy.”
“He did the thing, didn’t he? I swear, he could say the most mundane things. But how he says them you think he was Dane Cook or something.” Another flat glare was fixed at her as Hadrian fell silent again. Though this time Draco didn’t feel that stab of coldness, so he assumed Harry was a bit more comfortable in his skin now and just choosing not to respond.
It was hilarious to watch a python herding a snack sized calico kitten.
Intent was paramount.
“Of course it is, I have magic too you know. We’re letting the adults work over whatever issue they bumped into, and besides. You promised me an explanation. Not that I’m not delighted to house your relatives, you know I love guests and hosting. Even if my ‘other’ needs fall to the wayside.” Hadrian’s nails dragged down his boyfriend’s chest, he grinned at the shudder his actions elicited. “So. Talk.”
“Sweetie, you are home.”
The relief was like getting dumped with a bucket of ice water in the summer heat as Hadrian jotted down the answers swiftly and passed it to Laney who squinted and bit her lip.
With that, James grabbed the dishes and disappeared into the kitchen whistling a soft tune as he left.
Draco hummed, “Do you think Laney’s awake?”
The box fell open, revealing the shimmering platinum band with small diamond crusting and the ruby that was traditional for Dician weddings. It was in that second, Hadrian knew he’d been blessed. This caring, sweet man that was looking at him like he was the reason the world turned. Hadrian grinned.
“Piers and Esmerelda it is when you two are together and not in the common room. I will not be made a fool calling a shared name. It would do well to answer to those names if it is amenable to you?” Hadrian glanced to his ‘sister’ and she seemed to look him up and down. Sizing him up, it was oddly amusing to see a child act so tough.
Turning half way around, the raven glowered at the sight of his biological brother smiling at him. Hadrian wand was still in front of him, a small flame licking at the tip. He wondered if he’d get in trouble for ‘accidently’ lighting the little prick on fire. Alex seemed expectant, waiting until his smile faded and he frowned.
“Draco? Something to share with the class?” All the adults looked at him. He took a breath.
“Twin?”
“Immediate dismissal! Custody stays with Hadrian Potter-Dragma’s mothers! Potter I want to see you up front
They won the courts, they won’t get away with this. He just had to be patient. Patient. Patient. Patient.
With a blink of Draco’s eye, Hadrian had whipped out his wand. A rather plain, but efficient weapon as with a flick of his wrist and a murmur all the candles in the house flickered to life. An impressive show of magic, Draco had half a mind to swoon. Especially as the tension seemed to relax and dissipate almost immediately once Hadrian’s wand rested innocently on the table. His mother smiled brightly.
“I am fine. Suni is a brat.”
In the end, there was little she could’ve done, besides what she was doing now. Getting her son his twin brother back.
as Severus and Draco rounded the corner. Right on time to see the older Potter twin staring at his god daughter lying on the ground, face swollen and wand nearly ten feet away from where she was moaning in (exaggerated pain).
“Are we counting when I thought we were courting or when you got your head out of your ass?”
“Basil.”
It was kidnapping at least, line theft at worst.
Tom gently pulled the papers from Hadrian’s, his
“Harry? Are you awake? Lunch is nearly ready! I’m calling your brother and father in from flying, it’s a shame you couldn’t join them.” The doorknob bent and stopped with the lock, jiggling and the door shuddered as it was tugged on. “Harry? Harry are you there? It’s Mum.”
“He got away, what do we do?”
Severus ignored it.
“Zabini.”
“Mine! Off!”
“Now, I hate to say this. However in the event of your untimely death do you know where your children would go?” Sara patted her wife’s knee.
And she despaired.
And he was left in the ashes. A grown man going to face another grown man, one who’d changed for the worst. One had thrown one of his children away and allowed him to suffer and be hurt in ways no child should. The other had begged for that child, unable to have his own, and now could only avenge the child and all the time that was lost from him.
With that, Severus drew his wand and felt the familiar tug of being pulled into someone else’s mind. A blink later and Severus was in a snowy forest, it wasn’t warm, but the cold was comforting. The dark-haired man looked through the trees and saw a large ice rink, a figure was gliding easily on the ice as he approached. He could feel content, calmness, level-headedness. Severus waited along the edge as the boy skidded to a stop in front of him, a wide grin on his lips.
his brother.
“Oh, you know.” It was dead. Tom had never heard the boy anything but buoyant and cheery. Always first with a welcoming embrace and a wide grin stretched across his tan cheeks and the bright green eyes. Caused by Tom’s curse, (how could he have disfigured his child.  sparkling with warmth and light. Severus’ thumb grazed their child’s neck again.
“I wouldn’t worry about me ma’am.” Severus could see the shorter man’s hand squeeze Draco’s thigh under the table and held back a spit take. Internally he was cackling, Hadrian was still smiling like a church boy as the hand squeezed again when Draco wheezed quietly. The young man would’ve made a good Slytherin, Severus mused.
No, he left here free, or in a body bag.
Where Alex giggled madly and wrecked havoc on his broom, Harry had always looked up with those carbon copy eyes and happily sat in her lap. Listening to music or letting her read aloud to him from her charms book.
“Okay. Draco wanted me to try something. If you know it, it’s called Legilimens. This is going to hurt unless you are aware and accepting of me going into your psyche. Would you like me to do so?” The brunet brushed his hair over his shoulder and relaxed against the table with a gentle smile.
“Sirius, how could you?”
First, he gently sawed off a chunk from the ends of his hair and fashioned it into a decent brush head. Using his ponytail, his hair hung limply down and around his head as he hyper focused on wrapping it around his broken wand and the tip of his new brush. Useless for magic, but perfect for painting precious lines.
“We can only avoid him for so long, why is he being so persistent? Didn’t he get the hint before we got sorted?”
James had been indifferent, more focused on Alex. Alex had been distraught and angry that his brother had disappeared when they had promised he’d get to see him. Lily had been equally distressed. Searching all over Wizarding Britain and finding nothing. Until her baby showed up to the sorting. With a sister according to Albus.
Draco gave a large grin. “That’s my godfather Severus Snape. He’s the head of our house actually so you’ll get to meet him in just a minute when he joins us in the Slytherin common room. He can be a bit grumpy, but he’s cool once you get to know him. I think you’ll like him.”
She’d left them alone to use the bathroom. She thought it’d be safe, they had just won the court case and it was usually a busy space at the ministry. Laney didn’t think anything would happen in five minutes. Yet, when she’d returned Annabee was screeching on the ground, clutching the Slytherin scarf Draco had wrapped around Hadrian’s neck and bleeding from a cut on her forehead. Her twin nowhere in sight.
“Is this seat open? Or should I leave?” He was confident, but who wouldn’t be with the two bulky shadows who stood guard behind him like bulldogs. Laney grinned and waved him in, definitely Mama’s daughter as she welcomed them with open arms, letting go of Harry’s hand to help them settle in.
The dark-haired man gave a swift nod. He knew what it was like to worry, even if it might be nothing. Following gut feelings were very important and it wasn’t like it was difficult to check as long as the boy consented. “Have you talked to him about this?”
In Potter Manor.
“Oh! The Italian!” Lucius smiled indulgently as they recollected themselves, Hadrian looked a great deal calmer, legs down on the floor again. The red head had splayed herself practically across the sofa in the patent ‘take up as much room as possible’ way of sitting. One of her legs hooked over her brothers lap.
A sudden fear gripped Sirius. He knew what a horocrux was. If it was ever released. If Albus or James ever released it out of spite or to try and gain control of Hadrian it would be over. The press would call for his blood and the Ministry would stop at nothing until his little boy was thrown through the veil or kissed. They wouldn’t look for a solution. They would be like James and think only of themselves, rather than a little boy who deserved to live. A victim.
, said he would work on brewing a memory potion immediately. Though it wasn’t likely to work on Hadrian, it was fine. He didn’t want to remember school if he was the Potter that Draco had whined about and cursed constantly. His fathers were desperate to remember though.
“Of course Lucius, I’d be delighted to do dinner with you and your wife. I have a toddler if that’s okay?”
Draco assessed the situation.
Then he had to witness Hadrian popping into existence, collapsing from blood loss from a hex James shot at his own son and hemorrhaging from his core because he had to rip the family magic from his soul and blood to escape a household he’d already fought tooth and nail to escape. Magically exhausted from apperating at his young age. Images of him dropping, passing out in Mrs. Anderson’s arms, skin paper white and blood covering his gaunt frame. Hair long and gritty with grease and grime. Limp. Like a puppet without strings.
“You can’t be so light when you tell people your parents are dead. They’re going to think your nuts.”
Certainly one his easier custody interviews. Lucius hummed, shuffling his paperwork around again and sorting it neatly into relevant folders. Waiting patiently until the two mothers and Severus filed back in. Lucius straightened his back and greeted them with a nod.
He tugged on Hadrian’s ponytail softly, lips pressed to his beloved’s crown. Who knew he would find his Veela mate so early in life and fall so deeply in love with him before even the bond kicked in. Draco’s fingers twitched, it was nearing the end of summer and he hadn’t even gotten to introduce his parents to Hadrian.
“Hadrian Dragma-Potter!” Hadrian winced as all the eyes turned to him. Shocked and confused, including the angry eyes that had been previously trained on his blood brother. He chanced a glance at the man. Onyx eyes met his and just stared. Not softly like his parent’s, but also not bitterly or angrily. More as if Hadrian were a puzzle.
“As I stated earlier, they only requested your brother’s attendance, however as you are family and I his head of house. I deemed it prudent to drag all of us up here. I fear the havoc you and Draco could wreak if Hadrian nor I were there to witness and fix it.” Snape sighed despondently to which Laney giggled brightly. Hadrian blinked as Snape caught his eyes, but quirked his lips up into the best half smile he could. As their professor gently grabbed both their shoulders Hadrian knew he understood.
“It’s Hadrian Piers Dragma.”
“Severus! You could have been so adorable! Look at those cheeks! I keep telling you two, once the wars over you should have a child. Mix your devastating good looks and you’d have a drop dead gorgeous son or daughter.” Lucius smiled at his wife’s teasing, but the adults quickly went quiet as both of the men in question stopped smiling. Only Severus managed a softening in his gaze.
Bloodline.
“Stop calling me out.”
“Ah, you’re right. My platonic knight in shining armor. The brotherly prince to my damsel in distress.”
“I haven’t laughed like that in ages, thanks.”
Suddenly Professor Snape was upon them, merely glancing at the five snakes before he looked to the lion on the floor as the youngest Weasley boy was working on getting him up. “Twenty points from Gryffindor for lazing on the ground and blocking the entrance to the class.”
“What’s your home then, if not Britain?” Hadrian gave a radiant smile.
. Suni would have bit her for her selfishness and the thought was enough to make Hadrian smiled.
Fault.
-Watch James get arrested by coworkers
Hadrian shrieked, his back arching to an extreme angle. There was no fight in him left when James manhandled him and yanked his wand out of his wrist holster. Snapping it in half right in front of the younger boy’s eyes. Hadrian felt like his rib cage had cracked. Watching his wand fall to pieces before him. It hurt more than any beating James could dole out.
His Papa swept in to shield his other side, looking him up and down as well with a proud smirk.
“A what?” Hadrian rolled his eyes, getting up and flanking Draco as Laney tried to describe their mother’s job with the international bioterrorism group as a high ranking soldier in wizarding terms that Draco could possibly understand. However, that conversation was interrupted as they were stopped by two lions standing in front of the Potions Labs.
Unless, that's not really what happens
“No.”
Pushing open the door, no elves bothered him at all. Either they were gone, or they were hiding away from the turbulent family magic. The dark haired man paused, voices were carrying down the stairs. Probably from the study. That was always where James went when he needed to brood or was stressed. It was where he hid the fire whiskey too. Sirius drew his wand and crept up the stairs, easily drifting through the halls like a silent breeze until he was peeking into the study.
“I think I graduated last year seeing as the old coot never showed up to get me for school. Which means I can finally work full time and get the house ready. Actually build up savings for us. No, using your parent’s money is not going to be included in my mind. I need to meet them by the way. We’ve been dating for five years and mates for a year, when will I not be your side hoe?” Draco chuckled into his love’s hair, letting him ramble on and on in the sweet sunlight.
Dumbledore.
“Assuming you mean Potter.” Laney flicked a strand of hair over her shoulder as an answer. Snape allowed that to be his answer as he sighed softly. “Regardless, the snake pit has a few more members than expected and we’re short a bed until I can get another one. Any ideas on what you’d like to be done for the night?”
There was a certain humiliation in being trained in defense from the age of six and getting curb stomped by your ‘squib’ brother who decided silent casting the entire time sounded like a great time.
Sweet like candy.
“Anytime.”
Stuffing the letter in his robes. Severus escaped down to the dungeons, whistling to call his post raven down to his chambers he sat down at his desk and grabbed a quill and parchment as swiftly as he could.
Draco shrugged, “I mentioned it. I didn’t want to press my luck. Especially since I’m going to be wrangling him into a heritage test at Gringotts soon for my parents.”
Odd, but boys were reckless, and if he were Harry Potter… Harry Potter. Why hadn’t Hadrian recognized them in his home? Severus had been his professor for years, Voldemort had even seen the boy during Albus’ set up in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Harry Potter. Oh god, Tom had almost killed his baby. That’s why Harry had lived. The Boy-Who-Lived. Magic was more than intent, it would know if he were unsound. Even under compulsion upon compulsion and induced madness, his magic knew he’d never hurt his blood. His magic had probably recognized Hadrian and had backfired to prevent him from killing his son. Thank Merlin.
“Go to sleep love, we take it step by step in the morning.”
“I’m Alex, and that’s
“He’s also a Metamorphagus to give you a heads up.” The Lord sighed, a hand on his forehead as he leaned against his Uncle Severus’ frame. A smile was on his lips though, betraying the exasperation he tried to put forward.
Like a well performed play, it was absolutely stunning to watch in practice.
“Let’s refrain from telling that story if it comes to trial.”
“Why thank you, my mother’s a soldier.”
Hadrian doodled a tiny bumblebee with a snake at the bottom underneath his name and folded it up to seal it with a wax stamp. Looking up to where Laney was folding up her own reply to their parents, he raised a brow and his sister grinned.
“Play nice Leandra.” The girl looked at him with utter betrayal, as if he’d just insulted her entire family. It was a rather funny expression to see on a child before she pouted and slouched into her brother, looking up at his through her hair.
“Homework?”
“I’ve always liked emerald.”
they were so casually talking about. Sirius had had enough.
With how their evening went, it was a surprise when an irate Potions Master stopped them before breakfast the next day. A sneer firmly in place on his lips as he handed them a note with a candy name on it. Laney looked at it confusedly while Hadrian raised an eyebrow at him.
“Making sure I’m not horrifying our new godfather, that my grades are fine. Oh, and that that little pleb isn’t bothering you too much.
His longing for home was near painful after a week like this.
Eleven and performing a ritual, especially this ritual. Hadrian wondered if he was breaking some sort of record as he bled and darkened a couple of the symbols. It would be difficult to scrub off the blood if it didn’t work and he’d be set back another week at least if he needed to sneak into the library and see what he’d gotten wrong.
“How about friends, do you have any friends in school, or from your old muggle school?” Laney frowned and hummed.
“Do him next please. I’d pay a handsome sum to see Severus in his younger years again.”
She wanted her baby back. The one who had such a sweet smile and was so patient and good. Who kept her company while she read her charms work, or brewed potions, or even just cooked. Not the one who glared at her and regarded them with such fear and
The temptation to speak back up under those eyes was so clear and so there. But the words died in his throat and he just slumped back. Making Laney sigh discontentedly. “Hadrian’s hit his word limit for now. He’s the strong silent type you see?” With a cheeky wink and a smirk, she got Draco’s furrowed brows to lighten up with at least a fond eye roll.
“What’s your middle name. Both of you.” Hadrian looked vaguely curious and Leandra looked startled. Draco just smirked.
“Thought not.”
As I've stated before, questions, ideas, comments welcome down below! We're nearing the end folks!
“Doesn’t need help with that. I taught him well. Someone tried grabbing Annabelle at a park. Homophobe that didn’t like that Sara was married to me. Hadrian sprinted after him and broke his arm. That time
“And, when did you get that?”
Plopping himself at the desk he labeled two papers with pros and cons.
“I wasn’t going to, I was going to make myself, what did you call it? Melt your dick off chicken, but I went for a safer option again. Tatertot hot dish is more of an American dish… but most people like it just fine.” Severus leaned forward a little bit.
Hadrian gently shut the book and pushed it away from him. It disappeared with a pop, back to wherever Tippy had pulled it from for him along with the empty plate. The raven tugged nervously at his misshapen ponytail and got up. Limping back to his room and resecuring the tie against his calf. Making sure he left no mark of his night wonderings. Hadrian sat down, regathering the pieces of his shattered wand, he held them against his chest as he let his thoughts gently circulate.
“I have that to give back by the way. And a sink faucet.”
, and wake up on May 30
“He can’t be gone, he can’t be gone he was just there! I was only gone for a couple minutes. I was only gone for a minute.” Mama was freaking out, speaking frantically to herself and clutching Hadrian scarf that had fallen off when Anna had tried to use it to grapple onto their brother. Narcissa was beside her, holding their grieving mother upright.
The dark-haired man gasped and stepped back, Hadrian looked at him, slightly haunted and pale. But the boy still looked into his eyes and stepped closer to him.
He’d gone hungry in this house before, he didn’t care about going hungry again.
Alexander Potter.
“It’s not that bad Hadrian.”
His heart
The magic of the place whisked away the time all through the female professor’s speech until she left them to prepare for their sorting. Hadrian was peacefully listening to Laney questioning Crabbe and Goyle with Draco’s help when he heard a voice that made his heart pound in his ears. Blood rushing and loud. It made him angry. It made him feel powerless. It made him feel vicious. Hadrian snatched Laney’s hand as Draco immediately picked up his new friend’s worsening mood and saw exactly the cause.
Albus had been… concerned, with Harry’s attitude. He was still her sweet boy, but he seemed to resent James. Lashing out at him every time James even got close to him. Distancing himself from everyone. Even his brother. Then, when Harry had left Alex slowly began missing his brother, clammering for stories and wanting to see him again. Losing all his animosity. Just as Albus hoped Harry had.
Severus, Sirius, and a man named Remus were also here, arguing at the grill and taking turns working on dinner. Tippy popping in and out to assist them and sending him glances as if to make certain he were still there. Tippy was familiar and deeply loved by him. Remus and Sirius were too, though he’d only met the last two recently. Sirius it turned out was his godfather from the Potters, and when they abandoned him; he rejected the Potters and disappeared with his husband Remus to France. He was also the man that arrested Albus and killed James to protect his honor and his life in a duel supposedly. Though, Sirius refused to say what it was that had set him off so badly and never told him anything about it. Never said anything about why Sirius had seen fit to kill James rather than let him live. Only that it was in Hadrian’s best interest.
“You didn’t.”
“I’m Sara Anderson, please just call me Sara. This is my wife Erin Dragma. We’re pleased to meet you! You’re Severus Snape, our children’s head of house, right? Minerva was talking to us along the way. I’m glad to see you in person however! As long as we’re not here because certain people,” An amused glance towards the twins was sent. Only Laney grinned bashfully as Hadrian was too busy cooing over his little sister to care. “Decided to blow up a sink again.”
“I’m from Britain and I’m probably English by blood. But my home culture is from a small desert island named Dicai. Blistering sun and spice is our life, though I grew up here and only have been to the homeland a few times, my mentor made sure I was taught all our traditions and immersed in the culture from the second she took me in.” Hadrian paused. “You don’t have to hide your wands or magic by the way. I know and I am.”
The ex-Potter started slow, it didn’t matter what you did it mattered how you were seen after all. Laney was seen as a holy terror with good intentions. He was the quiet scope of control and grace. Forever he would be the good quiet kid.
“Oh Harry, Slytherin? That’s a surprise, Alex had mentioned he was a bit upset that you weren’t his house mate too. Most of us Potters end up in Gryffindor. But how do you like it?” His chest clutched tighter, but he forced himself to choke out at least a few words. He couldn’t look weak and he couldn’t let them disrespect his house like that.
Laney was uncharacteristically quiet; she knew it was worrying everyone. But she couldn’t bring herself to do anything other than stare blankly at the squirming toddler in front of her or the strands of red hair that were slipping into her line of sight. Annabee was being nearly impossible to settle. Incoherent and inconsolable as her little limbs failed and sobbed in absolute hysterics. Hadn’t stopped crying since she’d fallen and Hadrian had disappeared before her eyes.
She looked so perfect, with brown near black curls and the biggest grey eyes looking up at him. Her face was scrunched up in confusion, until a tiny hand grabbed his nose with a loud giggle and a smile across both chubby cheeks.
. But he cleared his throat in an attempt to save face and not look like a love-sick fool.
“I hope you have all your things of value brother. You’re coming home now.” He shrugged his shoulders, he never had anything. Harry glanced down, he could see the glittering of glass in his skin, Docile and dazed. He didn’t fight her as they weaved their way through the crowds and the people until they were at her home. Their home. Dragging him up the fire escape on the side of the building to their apartment on top, Laney went running into the house yelling and dragging a petit woman with soft brown hair and honey brown eyes holding a baby.
“The pet snake?” Sara grinned. Suni had been her idea.
parents wouldn’t care as long as he tried his best and worked hard. It was a deep hidden fear he never realized still lingered in his chest until it released. Leaving only a gasp of fresh air in his lungs. It left him high and joyful as his smile spread into a grin.
“Albus! Don’t play coy or stupid with me! We both know you represented the Potters, they lose and suddenly Hadrian goes missing? Where are the Potters and Hadrian?!” Snape snarled at his employer. His godson was missing and the snake inside him was all venom and fangs, ready to dig in. Albus just smiled calmly.
“Ah, none of this ma’am business. If you must call me something, you can call me Cissa for right now. Maybe something more familiar later though, hmm dear?” Draco blushed bright red at the implication, but didn’t fight it. In fact, his hand seemed to hover over the pocket furthest away from Hadrian where Severus could see a small bulge. His eyebrow raised again, he knew Draco had mentioned the heritage test, was he so confident he’d bought the ring before introducing his parent’s even?
“She can be a loud terror when she wants professor, we know. No need to sugar coat it, there’s a reason Hadrian’s the voice of reason.” Snape needed to stop being blindsided by how much
His waiting game will continue.
Mama and Mother were sitting on the edge of the outdoor pool. Nuzzling each other lovingly as their feet dipped underneath the water’s surface. Mama hadn’t let him out of her sight for weeks after his escape, watching like a hawk from his bed side. Reading while he slept and making sure he was comfortable as he weathered the healing of his injuries and bouncing back from tearing himself out of the Potter Family Magic. Coddling him perhaps a bit too much out of love. Mother was just as overprotective if not more so. Hadrian had woken up in the middle of the night more than once to Mother slumped over in front of the door. One foot on it so if it opened she’d wake up. Handgun held tightly in her grasp.
Instantly the waterworks started again full force. “T-they want to ta-take my son. My son! They want to take him away! I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…” Severus was prepared for it when the woman collapsed. Grabbing her and holding her up as she sobbed incoherently, rage began licking at his heels like a loyal lap dog.
Or the thing… Draco thought back to the ring safely hidden in his bag.
With a cruel snarl, James threw a cutting hex from the safety of the wards. Hadrian gritted his teeth and held back a scream. Why did that man fucking love destroying his leg so much. Luckily, Hadrian had practice ignoring pain. So he kept running.
“You know you’re going to have to talk to me eventually. You’re coming home for Christmas!”
Immediately those pink lips split into a grin and Hadrian was pressed into his side. Draco’s face burrowed into the crown of the smaller’s head. Squeezing him tight until he let go. An arm still wound around his beloved’s shoulders as Hadrian’s nimble fingers gently traced the small of his back, unseen to their guests. Draco could feel the blush on his cheeks as he introduced them.
. His brother was sitting there looking nervous but still animatedly speaking to anyone who would listen. Lily was beautiful as ever, dark and rich red hair flowing smoothly as she quietly chatted with the headmaster, one hand absently stroking her son’s hair.
“Harry, it’s breakfast!” The sweet tone Lily used belied the aggressive banging at the door. “James! Calm down, give him a chance to wake up.”
“I figured your guests might prefer it, seeing as the first time I made you tea from my home you sputtered like a nun at a strip club.” Draco was surprised to see him mother muffle a laugh at the raunchy joke, but the amusement was quick to fade. Uncle Severus was the first to speak.
Lucius has also shown him ritual magic and allowed him to hone the craft himself, impressed with his skill in performing the difficult magic he had to escape his prison. Hadrian could honestly save he’d never been happier or more fascinated practicing a branch of magic, each successful ritual was an elation, an adrenaline high.
“Yes.”
Draco wishes the summer had stayed forever. His body ached from running, his mother and father were on either side of him. Their lord and his Uncle Severus were running close behind, shouting defensive spells and shields until they were able to get out of the Hogwarts wards to apparate with a loud crack.
“Five years.” His mother looked nearly affronted.
Sirius snarled, “Expelliarmus.”
“I always wanted a sibling, but my mother said I was blessing enough. I really think she just can’t have more children and didn’t want to think about it. Having a kinda twin must be cool. I never caught your name however?” Hadrian blinked. Oh right. He just assumed Laney introduced him.
“The judge signed custody to my mothers and a restraining order against
“I’m looking into that now.” Mother was ice cold fury as she spoke in low tones with Lucius, hands twitching as if looking for her magnum. Lucius was rifling through different law books and sending owl after owl out to various connections at the Ministry and other powerful Lords.
with more affection than he’d looked at her with.
“No, he’s ours.”
The dour man bit back a grimace, Sirius Black. Hadrian original godfather, who was enraged enough at the Potter’s actions to actually break a centuries old alliance and leave for France. Fucking over quite a few of Albus’ plans in the process. For all his faults he knew Sirius adored Hadrian and would do anything if he knew Hadrian was back. Longbottom had quietly mentioned to him while he was interrogating the Lords and Ladies that she’d overheard Sirius screaming that if Hadrian was a squib he’d forsake his magic and raise him muggle himself with Lupin.
A shrug, “Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. Suni’s been his longer than Hogwarts has.”
“Nothing.”
“Hadrian is much scarier than you, if Potter weren’t so obsessed with him we could probably get Hadrian to cow him into submission with a glare.”
“Essentially.”
” Sara glared venomously at the red-haired woman who paled considerably. “To my knowledge, no one’s dared to threaten taking away any child from the Weasley’s yet, with the only difference being you undoubtedly making more money and only raising three children, adopting your children, and you being gay. I wonder what the media would make of this threat, I’m sure Rita would make quite the spectacle of an article about it.”
The castle loomed in the night sky like a fairy tale. Grand and so beautiful it was like a light house, beckoning them home. Hadrian’s lips pulled into a smile that his sister quickly mirrored, giddiness welling up in his chest.
“It’s our home Draco, you don’t need permission to bring guests over. Though, I am making dinner, so a headcount might be nice? I hope we have enough chairs…” Draco didn’t even try to stop himself from smiling like a loon. Our home. If he weren’t afraid of getting murdered by the Order the pure domesticity he was feeling might tear him apart. His Uncle Severus looked at him curiously and sharply as he hung up the phone.
Harry was his brother. Yet he was looking at him like dirt in favor of this imposter.
“No, conflict of interest. Albus is a well known family friend, especially when we let him become Alex’s godfather. Any court case with us bars him from voting or having anything to do with the jury or hearing.”
James was in a room, barren of many books and filled with Quidditch memorabilia bent over in conversation with an old man with white hair. Albus. Sirius pressed himself further into the wall and held his breath. James shoulder’s shook, revealing his agitation in his nightrobes.
“Yes, that’s true.”
“Can I pet Suni?” Hadrian gave him a gentle smile and sat still as Draco hopped on the bed with him and reached out. Hand hovering in front of the large snake patiently letting her scent him before going to gently run his hand down her long body. “She’s gorgeous.”
Even Dumblefuck couldn’t steal things from the school or the Malfoy Manor it seemed.
-As a Potter, Potter wards hold little effect
“Do you know what I find hilarious though Sara?”
Laney was soon in front of him, but he firmly held the smaller girl to his chest when Laney tried to relieve him. Hadrian looked up at his friend with a bright smile that she’d never seen on him, eyes more alive than any fire and misty as his voice cracked and rasped.
The boy didn’t reply and the two disappeared from the doorway.
It felt like coming home, looking into his own eyes. How they should’ve looked from the start.
“We share a room at home so a night with my brother isn’t a punishment. I call the right side! Is it okay for me to room with my brother for a night?” Snape surveyed them critically.
Apparently, Laney had not stolen a sink. But she had gotten away with taking a faucet by Halloween. Uncaught by everyone except the Weasley twins, who were in the midst of stealing a toilet seat.
Another smaller chapter, but if it makes you feel better! The next chapter was so big that I had to split it into two separate chapters lol! So you're in for a treat once I upload that!
Cons- Underage Magic (might get the Ministry here quicker if they have to arrest me and everyone here. Not a bad idea).
, unless you want to see me differently?” The very air around him blurred as his dark hair lightened to a smoother honey brown, eyes turning blood red and looking to his lord with a smug smile. His hair was pin straight but still swept down to just above the small of his back.
Now she was still the same, but it was obvious to him that he’d scared her. More often than not when they walked Mother would have a hand on the back of his head, covering his old injury. Double checking the straps when he had to wear a leg brace and carrying him when he couldn’t walk anymore.
Draco had never expected this when they’d met.
Two classes and an evening of tutoring later, and Laney still sucked at potions, but not quite as bad. Professor Snape had spent the time stopping her from killing the three of them while teaching Hadrian the flower language that apparently Lily had taught him so long ago. It was… odd, to think of the woman who abandoned him being an innocent child once. Not unpleasant however, Lily made horrible decisions, but she didn’t cause the pain that her husband had to him.
outing with his closest confidants and his husband had the man trudging out. Cracking his first smile when Hadrian decided to mimic his glamour with rich blond hair and bright brown eyes and mockingly sulk around the man. Draco and his mother was nearly in stitches, almost falling over when they apparated into Diagon Alley.
“Final questions children. Do you wish to stay with Sara and Erin?” Hadrian nodded so quick that Lucius thought his head might fall off. Laney looked affronted and deeply offended, protesting the idea vehemently. “Do you wish for visitation with the Potters and Alexander Potter?”
“We have house elves do the chores really. Alex and his father fly in the backyard however, Alex is quite excited to join the Quidditch team for Gryffindor like his father.”
This year was going to be exhilarating, magical, and a huge head-ache in one school.
Draco was sitting beside him as Laney sat across from him. Crabbe and Goyle sandwiching her protectively. The lunch table was crowded, pressing the blonde tight against his side in a way that made Hadrian hold back a blush as he enjoyed the warmth. The blonde was chewing slowly as his eyes wandered speculatively across the hall.
Harry had even looked at
“Never call my sssister that ever again. Unlesss you’d like me to wring your neck until you are a lifelessss puddle on the floor.” Alexander paled until he was paper white and Hadrian released him, letting the lion slide to the floor as he returned to his friend’s sides. His arm shooting out to grab Laney as she giggled and swooned dramatically.
Wait for Ministry Assistance
With a start, Laney was the one to notice Alex creeping closer to her brother’s free left side. A small tap got Anna’s attention as Laney flicked her head to the intruder. It was easy once Anna connected the dots and jealously moved to Hadrian’s left side and held her arms up. Bless his heart, the long haired brunet caved thoughtlessly, ignoring Alex and easily hoisting the tiny girl onto his hip and holding her with both arms. Alex gaped.
The morning rose softly, Hadrian’s eyes blinking as the glow pried his eyes open. Draco’s blond head was burrowed into his hair and his arms were squashing Hadrian’s face into his neck. The raven haired man laughed softly, kissing a hickey on Draco’s neck before rolling out of his grasp. Hissing a good morning to Nagini and wandering downstairs to start the coffee maker.
So, this is the part where I tell you last night I basically got possessed and wrote the entirety of the fic. There is four chapters left and I'm debating to publish chapters and wait for a moment between each or if I'm just going to hail mary it and post them at one a day and wrap this up swiftly.
It probably didn’t help that their parents weren’t calm either.
“This, will it purge out the blood adoption? How much change should I expect then?” Tom, Dad, looked him up and down curiously, Papa was more matter of fact as he tapped the vial in Hadrian’s hands.
family. A name to be known and respected.”
, home safe and sound with more school supplies and completed homework from the year before. I brushed it off, but Draco’s worried that I can’t even remember the name of the school. The only thing I know is that I’m forced into one morph the whole time and it makes my skin burn.” Severus blinked, studying him carefully. Blackouts were one thing but losing a specific portion of time every year was odd.
A firmer nod.
“That’s… interesting.” Hadrian glared at the paper.
Snape rolled his eyes, “Basil is hatred. The original meaning was, before it became love. However I favor sticking to what flowers meant before people tried to beautify their meanings with false pleasantry.”
Sirius had been important to the arrest and the trial, damning Albus with a closed confession of what went down that night and nailed the old man with compliancy to child neglect, abuse, and attempted murder. He would die in Azkaban and Severus had taken his place as Headmaster. McGonagall was seen as too entrenched in Albus’ ideas to be suitable. Lily Potter escaped charges, but with the fall of Albus, the ‘Boy Who Lived’ worship fell. Criticism and hate came from all sides to a mother who abandoned her child and ignored abuse. Alex was let off as he was only a child.
Sitting perfectly straight in their seats like a normal family was
They were supposed to go to him and welcome him back home, but all they had found was her sister sneering at them and slamming the door in her face. The words bounced around her head and made every blood cell in her body turn to ice.
“There will be time for pleasantries later, so let us get down to business. Is there anything the Potters might use against you?” Erin curled a hand behind her ear, clearing her face of any stray strands, Sara was relaxed underneath her wife’s arm.
Hadrian hadn’t been kidding when he said he was going to use the end of school to spruce up the place.
“But Harry, we named you after-“ Laney interrupted as her brother’s hand nearly broke her fingers.
Laney squeezed his hand. Draco took his other side, caging him in and Laney was more than happy to glare at the Potters and hide him from view. Hadrian squeezed her hand back just as the gavel banged and the case started. Albus stood up and motioned to the Potters who were making obviously glances to Hadrian.
“This school year is going to be hell. That insufferable headmaster is still in charge even though he’s been bedridden. I want to stay here.” Hadrian nuzzled into his arms, making Draco sigh. The warm sun was kissing his skin comfortably as they sat on the beach’s bench.
“SLYTHERIN!”
Not a good start
“She’s a banana ball python, and a big girl. She’s getting close to five feet long, which is the normal average size for a full grown python. She’s a good girl, she’ll love you.” Draco gave a childish grin, finally looking like a kid rather than a haughty old man.
“Harry was always more sensitive than Alex, but he was also very forgiving. If he apologizes for hurting Harry and we show him how much we care he should come back around. We’re his parents.” Resolutely she continued eating. She gave birth to him. Raised him for most of his childhood. She knew him better than those women, he would forgive them. It would just time and some effort, and they would have lots of time if she homeschooled him for the rest of first year. Wait to send him back to Hogwarts until Albus got rid of that girl, resorted her son, and he settled into his rightful place in their family.
--OR--
“You’re the other Potter twin! I thought you went missing? People said you were…” Hadrian gave a bitter smile.
.” They hesitated, especially Hadrian, but Draco the more tactful of the bunch grabbed both his friends and dragged them away. Visibly down the stairs as if to prove they weren’t eavesdropping.
Hadrian cocked his head to the side, sitting on the bed that had his trunk in front of it. Laney was kneeled in front of it, rifling in it for nightclothes. “I prefer showers, wonder where they put my trunk. Oh! Suni, hi! Go to your daddy I need his clothes.” The three purebloods watched with wide eyes as a large yellow snake flopped out and quickly slithered up to the boy on the bed which made him smile. Looking so calm and so… powerful. Draco drank in the sight as Hadrian leaned back, all lean muscle and gentle motions as he stroked the large snake’s scales, contented hissing erupting every now and again. “Marissa! My cuddly baby.”
“Well Sara, Erin. You’ve raised a well mannered and charming young man. He is visibly quite happy with you in your home, and well taken care of in it. Safe to say if legal action is attempted, we can be swift and thorough in shutting it down. That said, please do keep in touch. My wife and I would be happy to invite you to dinner, and Draco is already bugging me to invite you over to visit during the Yule break.” Sara took his hand firmly and gave a massive grin.
“Sirius! What are you doing?! Release him, that’s Albus!” Sirius continued walking forward.
Pros-Quick
“Grand castle, soft and warm yellow lights and a night sky with a lake? This is basically Mama’s photography wet dream.” All five of the eleven-year-olds stumbled out of the boat. Crabbe and Goyle talking between the two of themselves as they helped out the three distracted students out of the boats, gaining grateful smiles in return.
“Erin works in a dangerous job, we have all her ducks in a row. I admit though, there’s a bit of lack of plan if both of us were to pass anyway… We want the kids to stay together and have all of our assets going into a trust for their care. However the only back up plan we have are my parents and they are getting quite old.”
“I’m Hadrian Dragma-Potter. Minstery wouldn’t let me drop my birth name until I can legally drop my heir title.” Draco’s jaw dropped.
In all his years he’d always looked forward to the day he’d go to Hogwarts, and it was finally sinking in that he was
“How did you raise them, they’re obviously magic and you’re…” Not was the unspoken word, as least Lily was semi-polite about it.
“Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one.” Her nasally voice was the nails on the chalkboard. Making him bristle and any contentedness in his chest die quickly, both at the interruption and the high and loud tone of voice. Draco basically growled at her.
He was supposed to be brought back home when he went to Hogwarts. Hogwarts was the safest place on earth, and keeping two preteens safe when they could listen and understand the things at stake as easier than trying to keep two children safe. James hadn’t been so optimistic. He just didn’t understand. Alex was his son. Harry was
All when he had parents, biological, living parents. Who, by the way Severus was clinging to him, would have loved and cherished him deeply his whole life. All those children he was jealous of growing up, the ones with doting parents. Who grew up, even if they were poor and just as raggedy as Harry had been in his hand me downs, loved. He could have been loved. The man’s long and thin hands curled into Hadrian’s scalp, renewing the tears that burned on his cheeks. Hadrian barely heard it when the doors to the private office at Gringotts’s burst open.
Severus gave a deep sigh. It would be a long year if this was anything to go by.
Usually he locked the door as soon as he heard her footsteps.
Yule break started on the right note, they were to take the train to Draco’s house, where their parents and them would be staying until after the court case and the holidays. The snow was falling like a winter wonderland, sandwiched between his best friend and his sister and coming home to a large manor where a toddler flung herself into his arms.
“Are we taking it to court?” Lily questioned softly.
Now, vote time! Are we doing some legal shenanigans, or do you want to me to find another plotline!
“Yeah! Dad told me you were coming home for Christmas. You won’t have to go back to those women’s house, you’ll get to come home again! Dad was saying that your adoption wasn’t real so we got custody of you again!”
“No. He hasn’t spoken to me since we sent Harry to his relatives. He’s in France with Moony, I don’t even know their address to send him a letter. There’s also the chance he’d be pissed at me enough to grab Harry and run. As the legal and blood-adopted godfather we gave him, he would be harder to fight than the lesbians.”
Draco gave another barking laugh. “Your presence this year is going to be scandal enough. I’m almost disappointed I won’t get a front row seat to the show you’re going to make when they call your name. I want to see that stupid headmaster’s face when you’re sorted.”
“Yes, after my twelfth birthday. Amazing we’re seventeen now love. So, over five years?” Draco smiled indulgently.
“No incest.”
“That’s an understatement. We started with wanting a heritage test for me to see my bloodline and we ended up uncovering that I’m both the Boy-Who-Lived, stupid name, was mind raped and manipulated by an old creep, and taken from two loving fathers who were alive and grieving unaware while I was being beaten and starved. It’s… been a day.” Hadrian hadn’t meant to sound so bitter, but the soft smile Draco gave him soothed any worry he had. Letting his lover give him a chaste and soft kiss. Rubbing his shoulders over the loose tank top that Hadrian slept in.
This chapter was inspired by one of you commenters! (Harris you know who you are, did I get the name right?)
All the students stepped into the beautiful hall and as a ratty hat started to sing, Hadrian glanced at his companions. Laney had a dreamy smile full of wonder and excitement as she held his hand. Draco caught his eye and gave a confident smirk with Crabbe and Goyle gave him firm nods. It bolstered Hadrian immediately as he looked up at the head table with determination.
“See? It’s ugly.” Severus looked at him with such sorrow and Tom’s arms squeezed tighter against his waist. But both were overshadowed by Draco finally butting in and stomping over. Grabbing his mate’s face and slamming his lips over the other’s forcefully until he yielded, melting against his long time boyfriend’s grasp. Draco pulling back with a sharp gasp.
“What would be quicker? Waiting for a warrant as is or filing all the paperwork to destroy Potter legally and then gaining the warrant?”
He remembered quite a bit from before he was abandoned and then was adopted. He remembered getting ignored by them all Mother and Father fawning over his brother. Sirius playing with his brother, Remus reading to him. Dumbledore showing him magic and teaching him theory. While he sat and watched. No one coming to play with him, or read to him, or teach him. Eventually even watching was above him and he was locked in his room for
“Maybe he’s sitting with the Slytherins because he is one?” Alexander glared at him agitatedly.
. The sharp pieces of his broken wand parting his flesh easily as it had his hair, as if it were a hot knife through butter. Blood was flowing easily, but not overflowing as to drip and ruin the circle. He looked out his window. Night was still young. He got to work. Jabbing the homemade brush into his arm and careful drawing the symbols.
Said mentor was relaxing on the patio next to the tree, enjoying a shady spot under the veranda with his wife. Sipping at what was either a fire whiskey or an iced tea. Narcissa sipping at a glass of water beside him.
“Oh Harry, look at you. You’ve gotten so big, and look at your hair. I was so worried about you when you…” Hadrian didn’t blink. The green eyes that matched her own showed little concern or interest. Just watched silently, judging. He was so still that if his hands didn’t shift within the other little girl’s she’d think her son’s twin dead. It was unnerving to see an almost copy of James act so cold to her.
-If I’m caught. He will kill me and Lily won’t protect me
“She was fine love.”
No matter how mature or brave they were, they were still kids. He was the adult here.
“Now, you’ve met us, who are your parents? What are they like?” Hadrian hummed, sipping his coffee.
"Incendio.” Alex squealed as his book was set alight and Hadrian turned back around without a second glance. Draco gave a startled glance to the book and back at Hadrian, grabbing his arm in a gentle but firm grip. “No one will believe him. He’s sitting next to Seamus.”
“Hadrian! Oh my baby, my baby, my baby.” The raven sighed, hands digging into his Mama’s back. It wasn’t a dream this time. He was here, he made it. Nuzzling into her shoulder, he let out a hysterical sobbing laugh. He used his arms to haul himself when his legs proved useless, trying to get closer to where he felt safe. Squirm closer into his Mama’s safe arms.
“Please be reasonab-“
“Am I not?” The silence was telling enough. Hadrian smiled apologetically. “He has a point though. I’m sorry. I think it’s a good ice breaker before anyone steps on it thinking it’s an issue. They died when I was a baby, lived with my muggle aunt and uncle until I was… nine? My mentor took me in when… circumstances made living with my relatives difficult. She gave me this house and let me work at her restaurant to maintain a life. I still work there and go to the homeland with her occasionally.”
Not only did his brother attack him seeming unprovoked in the Great Hall (a public space). He got
“My son doesn’t have to talk to anyone he doesn’t want to.” Sara turned to look at Snape, “I do want to let you know that he sometimes gets overwhelmed and let’s Laney talk for him. He’s quiet and quite sensitive despite his matureness, he doesn’t mean to be rude.”
“We have a good chance to remember yes. But Hadrian was exposed to compulsions and memory charms so early and so young that his memories of being Harry at Hogwarts are gone forever, and he was a baby so any memories with us are either faded to nothing or gone. When we get home, I want to make a blood purging potion. I want any remnant of that old bastard’s magic and blood adoption out of our baby.” Tom nodded placatingly, magic still lashing dangerously around them. Slowly, he stretched them out onto the bed, still holding tightly to his husband.
Hadrian dropped the shell shocked boy and shot to his feet just as James stopped at the corner. Seeing Alexander bleeding on the ground and Hadrian bleeding while standing over him, however Hadrian was still in an adrenaline rush and not just waking up. So he grabbed a vase from the table and hurled it right at James’ face before taking off.
If Hadrian wasn’t a man of passivity, he might already be in Azkaban by now.
“We’re going to get him back Anna. We won the court hearing, the ministry can’t ignore his kidnapping. Even if they did, Hadrian’s smart, he’ll figure a way out and then he’ll be sitting on the patio smirking at us with that quiet smugness asking why we’re freaking out so bad and don’t we trust him? Then, we’ll make a plan to
“The Potters are friends with the Weasley’s. A family who are widely considered blood traitors with no inheritance to speak of and one average income from the father. With
The house was quite ever since their son went to school, she hummed and gently stirred the stew that would serve to be their dinner. She still hadn’t adjusted the recipe to feed less mouths, so there would be a lot of leftovers. Though, if the number of mouths to feed would soon go up again. She hoped.
She was next up, the court hearing apparently was scheduled before Yule, so she was on a timeline. If Laney was anything at all, she was good under pressure. Hadrian watched from the library as Alex bumped into her in the hall. Obviously, he couldn’t resist spitting vitrol blaming her for Hadrian’s desertion. He was waving her wand around.
A soft touch on his shoulder jolted him out of his spiral and he looked into Draco’s silver eyes. Concern was evident in his eyes, but Hadrian just gently shrugged it off. Ignoring his food to drape his head onto the blonde’s shoulder. Ignoring everyone else and letting the idle chatter of the other Slytherins wash over him.
“Wait here alright?” Hadrian nodded easily, Annabee waved from his arm’s happily and Laney gave them a grin. There was a large skip in her step as she practically danced to the bathroom, Hadrian chuckling and watching her antics as Lords and Ladies alike exited the hall leaving it mostly empty as he waited.
“Protego!” His first visit to Diagon Alley.
“How long have you and my son been together?” Hadrian peeked at him, a hand squeezing his knee under the table.
Sara waved her off, “We didn’t know owls were like magic post. We got Laney a kitten for her birthday and a Hogwarts send off. But Hadrian got Suni his ball python for his… oh, was it his ninth birthday?” Erin played with her wife’s fingers idly.
Padfoot had been distraught when Harry had gone missing, he’d only visited a few times compared to his near daily visits with Uncle Moony when Harry had been there. Dad had said he was just working through his emotions, throwing himself into the Order. Now, Uncle Sirius didn’t have to grieve anymore! Harry was right there and now once he penned Mom and Dad, they could bring him back home.
They were saved from further small talk as the door opened again behind them and three women walked in. One holding a squirming and familiar bundle of dark black waves. Hadrian’s heart melted as he immediately abandoned his twin who just rolled her eyes as he collected his baby sister from his mother and returned to her without a word. His entire face was now open, eyes soft and adoring as the girl, maybe five grinned in absolute delight.
“Don’t we have to get sorted now? Oh! They’re calling names! Boys let’s roll!” Leaning out of her brother’s arms, neither boy had time to react as Laney grabbed Hadrian and Draco by their robes and shoved them forward merrily. A skip in her step as she separated her brother and friends from the massive prick. “Vincent! Gregory! Let’s go boys, we’re holding up the line!”
Tonight was the night.
“Would you say you make a proficient amount of money for raising three children?” Sara nodded resolutely.
Soon the brunet was moving back into the room, grinning past the snake vying for his attention as he placed down the big dish in the center of the table. Draco almost drooled, but stuck to look at Hadrian with utter admiration.
Sara turned on Lily immediately, smile sly and dangerously sweet, “How did you raise your son? Hadrian loves baking with me in the kitchen and gardening.” Lily balked.
“Their birthdays are eight days apart and Laney declared that that made them pseudo-twins. Hadrian never argues or disagrees with anything really, so he just accepted it and so did we. It helps that when we throw joint parties they seem more pleased then jealous at sharing a birthday. Annabee was very little when we adopted Hadrian so she’d never known anything different I guess.” Sara swatted her wife.
Annabee cheered with Laney and Draco raised his hand excitedly. Mama ruffled the blonde’s hair and smiled at Lucius as they all began migrating to the hall. “I’ll use the floo to give a quick call to Severus to come join us. You don’t think he’s busy do you?”
“Alex is doing wonderfully, the Weasley boys and him have been thick as thieves, the loud and rambunctious lot they are.” Snape figured this was his turn now as he kept a vigil on the two mothers’ side.
“We wanted a chat with Harry, seeing as he doesn’t seem to have the, affluence or comforts he was born into. I’m concerned as his rightful father as to his treatment. It goes to show that he went missing just days before you two adopted him…” Hadrian glanced up, but Laney frowned and Annabee soon commanded all his attention easily by grabbing his jaw. Erin clenched her jaw with a venomous glare.
Laney took that as a challenge.
“She will be when I sic Marissa and Suni on her.”
“No one has seen the Potters since Hadrian went missing, Madame Bones is already starting a search, but it will take some time. They haven’t been stripped of their most Noble title because the court case wasn’t even an hour ago.”
“Baby, are you home? Something’s up and I promise I’ll explain once I get there and we’re safe, but I really need to take some, associates, of mine to a place we can lay low and not worry about getting blown up.” Draco could feel Hadrian sober up with little to no words, though he kept his upbeat tone.
But not bad enough.
New chapter!
Narcissa smiled, “We should do a heritage test at Gringotts today! We all could use a nice rest, we can explore Diagon Alley and make a fun day out of it. What do you think? Draco?”
“What?”
“Mrs. Anderson, may I offer some assistance?” The smaller woman looked at him near desperately, looking at her kids with the most heartbroken eyes. She moved closer to kneel in front of the children cautiously.
Draco and Hadrian glanced at each other and hid a smile.
.” Sara smirked. “Besides, I wonder who would also win this fight if it’s all about money. I own my own business and Erin here is extremely affluential in an international military task-force. You are the equivalent of a stay at home wife and a police officer. Noble, but not very lucrative, all your money was made by your ancestors. We’re self-sufficient and though we have a lower net-worth than you, we didn’t see fit to
Laney grinned dopily between Crabbe and Goyle a few steps ahead of them, “A true edge-lord. I am so down. Tea!”
“Narcissa would be disappointed if you didn’t bring the child. She’s rather smitten with them, our biggest regret is not being able to have more of our own children. Although even just one child was a bit of a handful to raise with accidental magic.”
“Dining tables in the kitchen, gimme your coats.” His father almost abolished him for his rude abruptness, until their lord laughed. Long and deep, it rumbled in the air.
“Blaise is nice.”
And it was all her fault.
And felt satisfied.
“You took my brother!”
When times seem the darkest, look for the light.
Draco looked satisfied and his companions were too busy with treats from their bags to care for the conversation. “So, not twins because your adopted with different birth parents. How close in age are you to be the same year?” Laney giggled as Hadrian slumped onto her head, his boney chin digging into her crown.
A loud crack startled Hadrian. The raven whipped around only for something hard to smash into the back of his skull. Dropping like a rock, he hit the ground with a loud smack, Annabee falling from his arms. Distantly, he could hear her screaming and crying, but he couldn’t reach her. Moaning in pain as his head spun and pounded, he blindly groped the floor. Trying to blink the blood out of his eyes and find his baby sister as she continued to cry. Before he shrieked as a foot crushed his leg underneath its weight and a wand fell into his squinted view.
Spoiler alert. They weren’t.
Perhaps tutoring wouldn’t remiss with those three… A small explosion sounded and the two laughed softly, grinning like children with an inside joke, or a secret. Snape snarling and yelling at Gryffindors while subtly trying to shape up his house’s side of the classroom.
Is that why he never remembered his school years, because he’d been twisted so beyond recognition from his gorgeous and loving Hadrian to arrogant and self-righteous Gryffindor Potter that he couldn’t bear to remember himself? How many times had Draco lashed out at ‘Potter’ because his green eyes had looked too much like Hadrian’s? Hurt his love when he’d been lost in what was probably a memory charm or something. And that headmaster, Dumbledore, was the old principal that Hadrian always called creepy. All the times that Draco had seen Potter stumbling out of the headmaster’s office in a daze made so much more sense now. Why hadn’t he seen it?
“You have the adoption papers?” Sara handed over her file of copies. “Perfect, and what can you tell me about your professions?”
“Incareous.” Immediately ropes bound Albus helpless and Sirius stepped up from behind the two of them, wand drawn. James jumped back, wand at the ready. The man snarled at him, his forehead was still bleeding. Obviously from where Hadrian had chucked a vase at his head. Sirius gave a proud smirk. Go Haddy, he hadn’t seen that from the doorway.
Dumbledore, motioned to two chairs in front of him. “Sit, Mrs. Dragma and Mrs. Anderson will be here as soon as Minerva has gotten them both. Lemon drop anyone?” Alex grabbed one happily, but hesitated as the two students opposite of him said nothing. Unanimously staying silent and united. Alex swallowed the bitter feeling in the back of his throat.
James frowned again, “Alex said he went up to greet Harry before the sorting ceremony and he got ignored all the way to when Harry was sorted into Slytherin rather than our family house. He was distraught that after five years the first thing his twin did was snub him.”
“Once the order goes into effect, he won’t be able to get sixty feet of you and as for revenge, we can do interview with the paper and absolutely ruin his day that way.” All the papers were swiftly signed and immediately Mama was sweeping him into her arms and planting kisses and whatever skin she could reach. Mother watching fondly and squeezing his shoulder with a proud smirk. Lucius was packing away his brief case with an equally triumphant and proud look, “I say we celebrate with dinner before we go back home. What do you kids think?”
The absence of both of his babies stung like knife embedded in his chest.
This is the man who took his godson. The man he couldn’t recognize anymore. This was his enemy. He mourned for his godson and each spell was his fury at everything he missed due to James keeping him away from him and then sending him away.
“Ah, Sara Anderson and Erin Dragma yes? I’m Lucius Malfoy, Draco’s father and now your barrister in Wizarding Britain. It’s a deep pleasure to meet the mothers of Draco’s closest friends, he speaks quite fondly of Hadrian and seems to be baffled and intrigued by your daughter.” Lucius extended his hand as Erin nodded and Sara grinned. Greeting both of them warmly.
Not once did anyone try to heal him or ask him to eat his plate.
the man smiled into the kiss before pulling away. Draco grabbed his hand. Kissing each knuckle before slipping the ring onto Hadrian’s ring finger, letting the small thrill, the ember, that lit up in his chest burn as he got to admire the ring on his hand. He grinned up at his groom, grabbing the front of the man’s shirt and shoving him back inside and onto the bed. Wandlessly and wordlessly throwing up a silencing charm and straddling his future husband with a wicked grin.
His mind ticked at him again, his Occlumency shields scratching at each other.
Yes. This was coming home.
Weeks passed with school work, the world's most interesting Halloween feast, and cramming as many politics lessons into his head as possible. Hadrian was exhausted and more than content to simply exist. It was another one of those meetings the Headmaster had to arrange with his mothers and the Potters, where more arguing and useless bantering happened. Severus was escorting the children, Draco tagging along like a lost puppy with Hadrian (the crush his godson had was disgustingly cute). Severus was quick to grab the children and place himself in front of them as Sara slammed open the portrait door gasping for breath.
Hadrian’s laugh was a guttural hiss.
their son mentally and socially.
“I don’t know where young Mr. Potter is. Alexander is finishing up the semester at home, you know how family problems go. I’d assume Lily and James took some time off to console and teach their son.” Severus rounded on his employer.
If you have any opinions about how you want this posting schedule to go, lmk and I hope you enjoy this little angst fest!
“Laney wanted to play and those two are attached at the hip so naturally Hadrian joined to be with his twin.” James’ smile fell, turning into a scowl.
, he’s July 31
“I thought… I didn’t know what was going to happen and I only had precious few months with him in the summer. Things kept getting in the way after fourth year, but I promise I had a plan to tell you once we turned sixteen and I found out…” Draco trailed off thoughtfully, looking at Hadrian with pure awe and reverence when his love pet the dangerous snake with absolutely no fear. His mother eyed him curiously before his unspoken words hit her and she gasped.
He tried to use that time to nap a bit as he’d stay in his room, James too busy with Alex to remember that Hadrian wasn’t there to eat dinner or lunch. Lily often drifted towards his room, holding one of her books and asking if he’d like to read with her.
He was going to
“Nothing.”
brother Harry.” Laney gave a confused head tilt.
She’d sat there with Annabee wailing, unresponsive to anything until her mother was frantically shaking her. She’d remained in the fog as her family panicked and rushed them back to the Manor and firmly stayed lost.
Draco was sitting across from her, being the one to hold her baby sister. He was like her, quietly distraught as he tried his best to soothe the five year old. Dodging floundering limbs with impressive grace and pressing Annabee’s face to snuffle into his robes pathetically. Vince and Greg were on either side of her, caging her in and keeping her propped up when she felt like a marionette with no strings. Suni laid on her lap limply, sulking with her eyes closed in despair at the loss of her speaker. Laney didn’t know what she was thinking, and she couldn’t ask how to make her feel better.
It’d taken effort and destroying the beautiful tie that Draco had given him. But his leg was clogged up enough to not give him away was he limped to the Potter library and immediately beelined to the Family Grimoire. The raven smiling when he found the book conveniently lying on a table next to a plate that had popped into existence before his eyes.
All his life he'd known nothing but to bend and break his own spine for the sake of others. Now forced into a marriage he never wanted, with a man who hated him beyond belief. Harry could really only see one way out, and that was throwing himself at his enemies feet and letting Death soothe away the humiliation and the pain.
Severus left his godson to his thoughts, chuckling softly as he wandered into the kitchen. His mate was there already, practiced hands using the muggle coffee pot like it was as easy as breathing. His hair was down in slightly messy waves, a baggy tank top hanging off his shoulders. The man gave him a smile.
Just… a day at a time.
Severus still dug around, finding nothing incriminating anywhere in the office. Or any papers unrelated to school and students except a single letter from the French Aurors that made him pause. There was only one man in France aside from the congress that Albus would attempt to speak with after the trial. Digging his hands into the envelope he wrenched the letter apart desperately.
“Harry did soccer?” Erin nodded.
“Hello Harry, how’d you sleep?” He didn’t speak. Only glaring at her. His chest was wound like a spring. Lungs held in a dizzying vice grip that left him light headed and impossible to speak clearly. “Are you ready for breakfast?”
“Come on. Let’s move quickly, the address is 320 St. Dineral Ave.” Immediately, Draco stepped back and let his mother hold his shoulder and apparate them to the spot just outside the property. The street was dark in the night, but the soft glow of fireflies and the occasional street light made Draco smile again as he hopped up the porch with no hesitation. Keys clinking as he hurriedly opened the door and let his family and the dark lord inside.
The train rumbled in the station holding, his head was lulled onto the window watching the crowds while his sister was happily spinning a quarter between her knuckles. He could tell she was more nervous than she let on as she held his hand with her free hand tightly. But he didn’t comment on it. This was going to be the longest they’d separated from their parents and baby sister since they’d become a family and Hadrian would be lying if the anxiety for his baby sister Annabee wasn’t a pit in his stomach. He was glad that Laney was at least here with him.
Draco huddled between his own parents lost in his own thoughts as his parents murmured above him. Anxiously, Draco fingered the box in his pocket with a mix of relief and fear. His plans were a little ruined, but hopefully for the better. This also meant instead of praying to his partner’s dead parents he was going to have to not get ripped to pieces by two men who just found out they were fathers that had their little boy ripped away from them and obliviated.
“Great, we’ll actually be on time for a weekend breakfast. What did you want to do after?”
” Laney replied with a croak, voice hoarse and cracking.
“I’ve heard so much about you Lady Malfoy that I feel like I already know you. Please, all of you, come in and make yourselves comfortable. I’ll make some tea and we can chat while I finish dinner. I’m sure a warm meal and a safe roof is a priceless thing.” His green eyes sparkled when Hadrian leaned back towards him. Going on his tiptoes to give Draco a kiss and a pat on the chest.
