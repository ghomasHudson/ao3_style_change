“Don’t use words, you stupid boy!” A sharp shock jabbed Draco in the arm as she punished him for his mistake.
“You,” she said to Blaise, “Need to work on predicting where I will fire. Trust your instinct, not your brain.”
She made a ‘hmph’ sound, then after another extended silence seemed to settle on something. “Perhaps… Well- perhaps- I should try it...” The genuine expression on her face surprise Draco. He would never have thought she would want to do anything that resembled exercise apart from her morning walks.
Then he would remember he was bound by blood, and his mother would suffer far more if he rebelled. He could do nothing.
After almost falling asleep in History of Magic, thankful for his ability to take notes even when incredibly bored, Draco made his way to potions and grinned when he saw the potion sitting at the front of the class. They would be making the Draught of Peace which he was already proficiently good at, thanks to Snape's gift from the previous year.
” he heard Theo whisper just before he heard the sound of a door opening, then footsteps climbing stairs, and then suddenly-
Feeling sick, he realised he needed fresh air. He hurried out, cursing the long walk from the dungeons to the doors leading to the courtyard, as his chest got tighter and tighter.
He had let it go, and the consequence was an overwhelming flood of hatred- so strong that it was trying to overwhelm everything he held dear-
They reached the lookout after a ten-minute walk, and stood there, watching the sky, which was currently filled with swirling clouds that made Draco feel very small. Blaise pointed to one of the mountains which was being obscured the clouds.
They made their way into the great hall, Draco’s belly grumbled, he hadn't been eating that much lately, but suddenly he had an appetite. They made his way over to the Slytherin table where Pansy immediately made space for him and shot Blaise a dirty look. Blaise was forced to sit a couple of seats down from him as there wasn’t room. Why the hell would Pansy act like that? Draco had thought she liked Blaise.
Draco wondered what exactly he was considering when he felt it in his mind, a small assault. It drew back, surprised at the defence it found. It stood up higher and
Later that night as he made his way to the library to find a book to get lost in, he heard raised voices echoing from the dining room.
he was at the Ministry at the time. Draco had assumed it was just someone watching the Manor, but it was just someone watching
He looked towards the sky and found a thousand stars staring back at him. Was Harry up there now? A hundred tales and stories said it must be so.
He had watched... and done nothing. He had mastered his ability to put on a face, to meet Pansy in Diagon Alley and pretend that he was okay with all of this, as she was.
It was ruined as the broom suddenly pitched downwards. Draco opened his eyes to see Potter reaching out a hand towards the flames. Reaching for something as he had reached for Draco not long ago.
“Oh Draco,” she said as she swept him into a tight hug. For a moment Draco felt better, as the familiar smell of his mother’s favourite perfume surrounded him.
After dragging himself out of his hot shower he found Blaise already waiting for him, reading a book, their breakfast sitting on the small table at the end of Draco’s bed.
In reality Draco just needed some air as he could feel the constricting hole opening in his chest again.
He shook himself and turned to Pansy, trying to get Potter out of his head “We should finish the badges tonight.”
“Not now Pansy” he interrupted her and began piling some eggs onto his plate. He didn’t want to deal with her mothering right this moment.
The redhead scowled back at Draco, and Draco almost burst out laughing. Pansy had no such control, and her laughter filled the carriage.
It powered out of him, blanketing the room, a pulsating blackness that seemed like it was...sickness. It swirled around him, and as the last of it left, a strange emptiness settled within him.
It was only after the waitress had left that Draco’s Mother broke the strained pretence of politeness “Draco, you didn’t have to be so rude.”
“Give and take points?” Draco could hear the shock in Blaise’s voice. Draco himself was shocked- Even prefects couldn’t do that.
“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a very flat voice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.”
“Do not speak of such things to me,” she harshly interrupted him, her expression having transformed from anger to horror, “-things that can be pulled from my mind. Already you are already suspected of helping them escape.”
Draco couldn't turn around, he couldn't breathe. He made eye contact with his mother. Her eyes reflected the fear in his own. He started to build his walls. Slowly, but surely they began to rise. Faster- he forced them up. This could be life or death. His most recent memory was Snape talking to Dumbledore and Draco being told to save his mother. Voldemort could not see them.
“He’s coming!” whispered Pansy as they waited outside the potions classroom- and indeed he was. Once again, Potter was walking solemnly behind the Weasel and the Mudblood, his head hanging low and he shoulders slumped. What a pathetic sight.
“And that’s- how I felt. As if I were floating about the world, because I couldn’t think…I wasn’t- well- here. I was watching it all play out and I wasn’t there. I killed him but I swear I wasn’t there,” he breathed in, the sadness had returned to him, Draco felt it dampening his chest too. "That’s why I came out here. To test if I could still cast a Patronus. I just- feel so distant and empty... I was worried, y'know?” Harry had a distant look in his eyes, he was still experiencing it.
But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy smiled unpleasantly, and Draco clutched his wand tighter, the only thing stopping him was the knowledge of what would happen it
He sighed, looked around at the silent common room, empty due to the holidays. He missed his friends.
He sighed and tried not to think about Luna as he continued to read the text Snape had set him for arithmancy. He glanced out the window in front of his desk and then frowned when a white peacock came into his view. It trotted across the grounds- so
While she was considerably younger than his mother, they had bonded over their love for their sons and mutual love of fashion and anything expensive.
They made their way to a compartment and Draco floated his suitcase up onto the rack, then sat down by the window and watched as the train slowly took off, and worried parents waved goodbye to their children. He tuned out and began to focus on the thoughts swirling around his head.
So almost all of the stuff in this chapter is freshly written- hence why it's taken me a bit to upload.
She looked at him, a tired and hopeless look in her eyes, and he found he immediately wanted to hug her.
“Yes I could make that happen, it will take some time, but it will happen.” She gave him one of the hideous smiles again. His Father had been right, this woman did have power. Too much of it.
As if called by his thoughts, Crabbe and Goyle burst through the door behind him. He could tell it was them by the oafy laughs and the loudness of their steps.
“Come in,” Snape’s response came from behind the thick door and Draco shouldered it open. He looked around the office for the second time that day.
Draco knew they were all still staring at him. “Nope.” He didn’t even bother to glance up. Goyle decided this meant he could speak.
“I expect two rolls of parchment describing the properties of Dittany to be submitted to me by Monday morning. Those who fail to complete this task shall face detention. Dismissed.”  After Snape left the room groans filled the air- punctuated by the grumbles of various students.
Draco quickly packed his homework away. As he zipped up his bag he saw Dumbledore get up and made his way out of the stands. Draco followed, ignoring Pansy’s cries of annoyance.
Draco felt his face heat in shame. He struggled to control his expression. “Well, I technically am a death eater.”
“And I’m first in potions.” Draco went on as if he hadn’t been interrupted. While Snape was a family friend, this was not favouritism, Draco was very good at potions.
Draco stared as Dumbledore rushed off, Draco having been forgotten by him. Something wasn't right. He could now see that Harry was sobbing and Cedric was still...
Harry slowly walked over. His eyes focused on Draco “Why am I here Draco?” He was very close. Draco didn't really know what was going on. “Why am I here?” This time Harry whispered the question. Draco shook his head.
Mood lightened, he made his way into the potions stockroom and began gathering the required ingredients.
The wind was racing through his hair and that in combination with the sun on his face set something free in him. Draco was grinning as he sped around the pitch. He increased his speed, pushing the broom to its limits as a laugh slipped from his mouth, he hadn’t realised how much he missed being on his broom.
His tournament training had obviously benefited him physically and in addition to that, his normally messy hair was slicked back from his face. Draco found himself thinking the messier hair suited him better. More...Potter-ish.
“Yeah” Draco agreed, promising himself he would stop thinking about asses and think of a revenge plan for the Boy who Lived instead.
“I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let me just…” She grabbed his arm with the Dark Mark on it.
and forcing you to be self-detrimental. Trust me.” Blaise's hand was still on his shoulder, and it began rubbing in small circles.
They were nearing the Prefects carriage so Draco plastered a sneer on his face, opening the sliding door, preparing for the face that had been haunting half of his dreams in the holidays and found-
The large concrete room had not been subjected to the same cleaning charms his living room had been given when father had been tortured- the walls and floor were splattered with blood. The smell of it filled his nose, along with the smell of piss and shit.
“I’ll decide that,” Draco growled, but then smiled. “Well, I’d better be off.” he paused then gestured to the Hand of Glory which he had also purchased, but as it could not be shrunk by magic and did
Draco stepped back, alarmed by the face on the boy. Weasley and Potter grabbed Longbottom and held him back while he desperately tried to get at Draco.
Draco felt like he was floating as he made his way to the common room- but not in a good way. He felt disconnected, disorientated. He only found his way back because he had walked the path so many times.
“He's a good man” Draco said, perhaps a little coldly. He cleared his throat, attempting to sound a little friendlier. “Despite it all… and I know there's a lot... he's actually not a bad man.”
Draco stared at him, incredulous. He had just thrown away Draco saying the Death Eater were torturers, and his angry tone when mentioning The Dark Lord- But-
Knowing all eyes were on her, she forced herself to continue. She had a wand to find. She leaned over him and heard his very quiet breathing… it did not matter. She did not care for this war anymore, nor its martyrs. She just wanted to escape it with her son.
Five days later, after essentially spending the entirety of that time locked in his room recovering, Draco returned to Hogwarts.
“It is not an unbreakable vow, I am not stupid enough to do such things, but if you break your vow I will know.” Draco nodded. He needed to process all of this shit.
So, Draco waited for the battle to re-commence. He had his 17th birthday present on the floor next to him. It was a beautiful thing, made of gold- with intricate peacocks and their little jeweled tail feathers gracing the front. Inside, a little watch innocently counted down the time until the battle started again.
“Boys, you do remember that you are not alone, correct?” Snape said, making Draco blush and Aries chuckle.
“Tell Snape. Ginny is the spy. She has Harry. I have to go!” Draco said and took off running again. He ran as fast as he could to the outside of the wards and apperated.
Snape stood up and walked to Harry, finally letting the tears fall. He stood in front of the boy he had grown to care about, hugged him close to his chest and whispered, “And you are the best son I could ask for. I hate how you came to me, but will never hate that you did. I am happy I was able to help you when you needed it. You are the only thing in my life that matters anymore.”
Aries waved his hand again and Draco felt a cool sensation of lube run through him. Aries immediately went about preparing Draco. By the time he had three fingers in use, Draco was a writhing mess.
“My Lord, if-if you don’t mind me asking, who is the spy? I may need help getting Harry or the child out of Hogwarts. It would be helpful to know who I am looking for.”
“Only if you call me Draco.” He said with a smile. They shook hands and Hermione faced Harry. “Am I allowed to hug you now?” Harry just smiled and nodded.
Draco Malfoy turned around at the words with terror coating his tear-streaked face. Harry, ignoring the words, took five steps to Draco with no emotion on his face.
“Fine. Snape gave birth to me. He is married to my father. You might know him actually. His birth name is Tom Riddle, but you might know him better by his alias. Voldemort.”
When they arrived Harry said the password and the portrait swung open. They quietly entered and sat in the living area while Draco got them each a spoon and different kind of ice cream. Harry got his chocolate, Draco got french vanilla, and Hermione got cookie dough.
“I have taught you well, young padawan. Goodnight son, Lily.” Snape then turned to leave when he heard Harry say, “I should never have let you watch Star Wars.”
“After you left, mommy said to pretend you never existed. I didn’t like it. Everything was ok until I got my letter. She called me a freak. She put me in your cupboard. Mr. Hagrid came and got me soon after that. Mommy told me if I left I couldn’t come back. I knew if I stayed they would hurt me. I can’t go home Harry! What am I going to do?” Fresh tears rolled down the angel’s face.
Snape pushed past him and walked to the living room, pulling out his wand. “Here is how this is going to go. I am going to give you a paper that signs Dani’s guardianship over to me. You both are going to sign it. You are not going to argue. You are not going to complain. Break any of these rules and you get hexed.” Snape was calm and focused.
“Dear young Draco. I have heard an interesting rumour. I would like you to clear the matter up.” Tom hissed.
The last of whom remained calm and quiet through the whole argument. When Dumbledore decided to berate Snape from removing Harry from a safe home with a loving family, Harry who had been eavesdropping had snapped. He quietly walked up to Dumbledore, looked the old man in the eyes and calmly said, “He helped me when no one else did. At that place I was alone, scared, scarred, beaten, starved, locked in a cupboard for eleven years, and raped. I will never physically recover from them. With him I am fed, clean, allowed necessities that I called luxuries, I am happy and loved. You know, before Hogwarts I was never once given presents for birthdays or holidays? I never expected to get them from Snape of all people, but this past year for those things he has more than made up for the lack of them. He bought me the first pair of newly bought clothes that I had ever owned. So, you can yell and scream about him not telling you. You can yell and scream about what they did to me. However you are not allowed to say one bad word about the man who saved my life. About MY father.”
Snape walked into the room. “Draco, I wanted to introduce you to someone. As you know my son died just two months after he was born.”
Just as Hermione ran into the room out of breath with that look on her face, Draco’s arm burned. His heart fell.
Ginny left out of the big door and Draco turned to Harry. “I don’t trust her. Why is she just now approaching you? I don’t like her.”
“Well, I woke up and left to go shower because let’s face it cleaning charms are not for long term use. After my shower, I realized I hadn’t brought clothes with me and started to walk back into the dorm.” Harry paused. Draco reached out to hold Harry’s hand. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand as a thank you. “As I was walking back I saw the mirror and my tadpole bump.” Snape’s eyebrow raised. “I don’t really think it had clicked in my head yet that I am pregnant until then. That’s when Draco came in and calmed me down for a few moments. He went to shower and went back to the dorm to get dressed. I sat on my bed and that’s when reality came crashing down on me, I guess. Draco came back and just held me while I cried. I kept thinking in my head that I didn’t know what to do when I just said it out loud.” Harry had his free hand on his stomach, keeping his eyes down the whole time. Draco squeezed his hand letting Harry know he was still there. Harry glanced up and gave Draco a small smile, which Draco returned.
“Hello, Draco. I am Aries. It is a pleasure to meet you.” He reached his hand across the empty space.
“I can stay with Harry?” Snape smiled and nodded. “Ok. I don’t want to go back. Does this mean I call you Father, too?” Her little blue eyes sparkled.
“I- m- am Draco. I mean I am Draco. The pleasure is all mine, Aries.” Aries smiled at the stuttering it made Draco’s heart flutter.
"How about we don’t make that choice. You will both get out of here. We have back up coming. Right now we need to get Lily out.”
“If Aries is actually gone nothing will happen since we never had more children. If he is, a trail of green smoke will appear next to him. I have to know.”
It was a year almost to the day that they decided to tell the order he was no longer at the Dursley’s and why. At first there was silence. Then there was rage. Rage at the Dursleys. Rage at Dumbledore. Rage at Snape.
Aries got a scary look in his eye. “I dare you to kiss the person in the entire common room you want more than anything. I don’t mean a cute little peck, I mean a full on, tongue in mouth, moaning kis-”
“Gee, thanks. I’ll remember that when you have kids.” They went out of the room and headed to the port keys to take them all back to the castle. Eager to see what the school year could bring.
Draco was terrified of being called again. They had made up a lie about why he was with Harry, but he was still worried. As they walked to the tower his heart fell when his arm burned. The look on Harry’s face hurt him as he walked away. He had never been a religious man, but prayed that would not be the last look he saw on Harry’s beautiful face.
Even Draco didn’t believe it. He had been there every time after the Dark Lord was done with Harry for the day. The first time made him vomit. The next few after that just made him pissed. How could anyone want to hurt Harry? He never understood why it was necessary to visit everyday, until the day the Dark Lord announced his heir was to be born. Then everything made sense.
“Wait, what?” Draco had just finished asking when Aries turned to face him, then fell backwards. Draco gasped and Snape smiled. They waited a few seconds. Draco waited for the impacting thud. Snape waited for the smart ass comment.
Slytherin stood in applause for their new member. Aries sat next to Draco and Pansy when he got to the table. He paused briefly to look at his mother. Snape looked at him with his trademark scowl. However, Aries noticed the corners turned up slightly as Snape raised his glass in a mock toast. Aries returned the gesture and went back to his meal.
Draco forward. They looked deep into each other's eyes for just a second and came to a silent agreement. Draco turned slightly and planted his butt right on Aries’ lap.
“Hey, Aries. You are with Blaise, Greg, Vincent, and myself. Come on.” Draco said as he saw him enter. He followed Draco and was introduced to Greg and Vincent. They all got ready for bed and Aries fell asleep thinking about what tomorrow would hold.
He had invited the Weasley’s excluding Ron, but they never showed. It broke Harry a little inside. He understood though. After Ginny was Kissed, their relationship was kind of strained.
He stood and walked to the window. Upon opening the window his sitting room was a flurry of white feathers.
With that Aries left and went straight to his mother’s room to explain the situation. His mother laughed when Aries said Dumbbells believed Snape wouldn’t check about his son being alive and just immediately believed it. When he was done, he bid his mother a goodnight and went back to his dorm set on a nice hot bath.
He flopped his head back a little too hard. The blackness pulled at his vision. The door opened and black clad feet appeared just before the darkness took over.
“Mother has been hoarding her. I’ll go get them.” Harry nodded and Draco left only to return with his smiling mother a minute later. She handed Lily to Harry and sat down next to them in a chair. Draco sat propped up on the bed next to Harry looking at their gorgeous daughter waiting for Harry’s reaction.
“It seems you failed, Slave. You-” Tom froze then screamed until his entire body turned to dust where he stood.
He didn’t even bother to look up and hid behind his book to hide the laughter that was trying to escape.
Ron was still being a prat, but when wasn’t he. Aries had thought back over their friendship and was surprised he had never noticed before. There had always been signs. The biggest one being after Harry Potter’s name came out of the goblet of fire. Hermione had always gone out of her way to prove she was smarter than everyone else. She tried to be better than everyone. Aries was kicking himself after thinking about his past life.
“You did.” A weak croaking voice sounded. "Do you know how many times I could have died without you?”
Aries nodded and pulled back until he was almost out. He pushed back in roughly. He brushed Draco’s prostate on every brush taking Draco back to the writhing mess he had been. Aries felt the orgasm building. “Come for me Dragon. Come now!” Draco came quickly with a shout. Aries felt the muscles around him clamp down, drawing out his own orgasm.
“Ginny. This is my daughter. Tom wasn’t even the father. Draco is. You are not taking my baby.” Harry replied in a soothing tone.
They walked into the potion’s classroom and sat together. Students filtered in slowly and finally the bell sounded.
“Well, well, well. What do we have here? A freak wondering around?” Harry is suddenly flipped to his back. His view was filled with red hair and freckles. “You are not welcome here. No one wants you around.” Ron kicked him hard in the ribs. He heard a crack.
YEAR 9:SUICIDE ATTEMPT(CUT WRIST), SEVERELY LACERATED SKIN(BACK), MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
“Well, I grew up with an Uncle, or rather a person I thought was my Uncle. He was a paranoid sort of person. I was never sent to school. He taught me at home, so I do know how to use magic. He never told me anything about my parents. About a week ago, I got curious and went looking in the attic for clues. I found an old journal of his saying he had stolen me from ‘monsters’ and went one to say who they were. I tracked down where my mother lived and ran away from my Uncle. He didn’t believe me at first but I showed him my birthmark on my knee. He apperated us here and showed my father. They ran a test that showed I was their son.” Aries responded.
Draco groans but says okay. They fall asleep in each other's arms, like they have every night for years.
“They are living at my house and Sev is my godfather. It would be kind of hard not to notice.” He chuckled.
“Only if you rest.” Harry nodded and scooted over. He fell asleep in Draco’s arms listening to the breaths from his love.
Draco knew exactly what memory it was. He prayed Harry didn’t finish it. He wouldn’t be able to breathe if Harry did then said no.
“Harry, if you need anything, remember that you have a room in my quarters. Even if you just need to take a break. I know you love Granger and Draco, but anything at all and I’m there. I got this for you.” He pulled out a silver bracelet. It looked like two twigs intertwined with three emeralds in a line. “Just hit the middle gem three times quickly and it tells me your location. It would just make me feel better if you wore it. It has been charmed so only you can operate it or take it off. You are welcome in our quarters any time day or night. Okay?”
“Draco, I was going to tell you, I just didn’t know how. Okay, let me start at the beginning. Granger sent me a letter from her and the Weasleys basically saying how they no longer want anything to do with me. That everything that happened at the Ministry was my fault. I already know it was, I just hoped they hadn’t thought the same way. On the train, Weasley kept going on and on about his best mate Harry Potter and it pissed me off. You don’t know this, but the hat wanted to put me in Slytherin first year, I had just asked it not to. I honestly can’t believe more people haven’t caught on to the voice thing. You have had a crush on me for that long? I sort of have too. One night this summer, my uncle was pissed off. When he gets that way, I am his favorite way to take out anger. I knew it wasn’t going to be pretty, so I sent Headwig to Snape hoping he would help. And he did. I was near dead when he found me. He took me to your manor where he started healing me. Tom found out, but for some reason or another helped Mom. They were taking off my clothes to have better access for healing me when they saw it. I have a birthmark on my leg in the shape of a ram. Hence, Aries. Mom saw it and did a parental test. It showed I really am Aries. Harry Potter was never real. I am not scheming or planning anything, except to Bumblefuck. He tore me apart from my family and made us all suffer. If you go out there and tell Mom that I am Harry Potter, he will laugh. He already knows. I am sorry that I didn’t tell you, but how could I? If you heard that, would you have believed it?” Aries finished.
He spun the bottle and the game continued.  It lasted about another hour before everyone got tired and headed to bed.
“You are right. I’m sorry. You are still just a little girl to me. Yes, Ron hurt me, but we are both fine. Just a little sore.”
“No. You two are just so cute and it makes me happy. I finally have a family. Now we just need a mom. Father you better get on that.”
“Harry please tell this ferret he will not be incharge of your baby shower. I’m the baby's aunt. I get to do it.” Hermione tattled.
“Well it was when the Dark Lord told you about Tadpole. You had screamed at him when he came in, then he told you. You looked at your stomach. You were about three months along, so I don’t know why we hadn’t connected the dots before. You sat down and didn’t speak again until this morning. Even when you tried, you couldn’t.” Draco told him.
“Unfortunately, there isn’t much I can do. According to the rules in place his punishment will have to be minor. He-”
He used his wand to cut a long line across Harry’s stomach. Blood ran down the large bump. Harry could still feel it but it was very diluted. More like a pushing against him.
“I call you a ferret, because in fourth year not Moody transfigured you into one. Also it just fits.” Ron snarked back, making Harry giggle.
Aries nodded and off they went. After a few minutes, they found the room in the space behind Slytherin’s stone head where Sally had come from. They entered a cozy looking room. It looked like a library, but with better furniture. Aries set off to look at the rows upon rows of books. Draco looked at the potion ingredients. I did have to ask Aries one question.
Aries was still hidden behind his book, smirked a little and decided to play with Draco a bit. He looked up at both of the newcomers and immediately looked back down.
The twins do not agree with the writing of this letter, but still stay away from them. You do nothing but bring pain to people. Please don’t write back. The owl will stay until you have read this and you tell him to go. He has been told not to accept any letters in return to us.
Draco calmly walked to the basement doors. When he got to the bottom he heard the scream. He ran to Harry.
By the time they arrive at the dungeons Aries is completely lost. Good thing he still had the Marauder’s Map. They all enter and stay in the common room waiting for Snape to come and greet the first years. It honestly didn’t take that long before a snap of his black cape caught their attention.
“Oh Merlin. Ok. I am just going to say it. Harry I am completely head over boots in love with you. When we talked in the infirmary and I told you that you weren’t alone, I meant that. I want to consider Lily as my child. I don’t want to be Uncle Draco. I want to be Father or Dad or Papa or whatever she wants to call me. I want to be with you. I want to be with you in every way that matters. I want to wake up in five years with Lily jumping on the bed yelling at her dads to get up. I want everything that you can give.” Draco finished and looked at Harry.
Hermione was the first to recover. “Harry, are you sure about this? He has been terrible to you from the moment you walked into his class first year.”
“I am Severus Snape. A potions professor at Hogwarts. I am the man that got your nephew away from this hell hole. I am the man who adopted him. I am the man who is lucky enough for him to call his father. Now, I am telling you one final time, SIGN THE PAPERS!”
She looked up to find him staring directly at her. Red eyes, piercing into her mind. She resisted the urge to whimper.
Both Draco's and Potter's eyes snapped up to Pansy, who had uttered the words rather loudly. The Mudblood and Weasley whirled around, their faces red and their eyes narrowed.
“He’s dead,” said Weasley harshly. But Draco had already known that. He felt tears well up in his eyes and felt his body curl up and he began rocking back and forward. Something about the movement soothed him and stopped him from screaming.
Amycus Carrow isn't happy about this when Draco says he doesn't like to share, they duel. Draco wins. Alecto warns Draco that her brother will not forget this.
“Mother.” Narcissa looked up sharply at him, obviously disliking the interruption. “I can order for myself.” He turned to the waitress who maintained an impassive face- he could feel his own burning. “I’ll have the Salmon please, but only if its fresh. If not I’ll have the risotto”
“I used to pretend this was my dragon breath,” said Draco, sighing again and watching the swirl of cloudy breath rise into the air.
He sighed as he spotted his Mother hurrying down the street towards him a very angry look on her face.
“It didn’t go away now that he's dead?” Draco just raised his eyebrows, and Potter’s face reddened as he realised the stupidity of his question. Draco felt his face redden slightly in response as the pure oddity of the situation hit him- then something in him panicked and he resorted to old ways.
Then came the hissing of the Dark Lord himself, Draco blanched, not having known He was there “Do not question me so boldly Yaxley.” A silence filled with anticipatory fear followed his words. “The enemy has already sent someone to persuade the giants. I have heard whispers from certain agents that they have already sent the half-giant fool Hagrid and Madame Maxime from Beauxbatons to talk to them. We have to act now, and we have to act quickly… Yaxely, you will be in charge of this” Draco heard a strangled cough coming from who he assumed was Yaxely. He knew enough from studying the Giant Wars in History of Magic that the massive beasts were very difficult to work with, and had alarmingly short attention spans and quick tempers, and were harder to subdue than dragons. Yaxely was right to be afraid.
“...Was it really that funny?” Draco asked, and despite himself, he couldn’t stop a smile coming to his face.
“Must mean?” Crabbe turned on Draco with the vicious look on his face again. “Who cares what you think? I don’t take your orders no more, Draco. You and your dad are finished!”
And the final clue- Draco closed his eyes in pain. Blaise had been one of the two only witnesses to Draco’s words on the night he had gotten drunk.
Madame Malkin frantically tried to cool the situation, but was making no difference. “Really, you shouldn’t accuse… dangerous thing to say… wands away, please!”
“Fuck off Crabbe” He pushed the brute away from him, but couldn't help a smile as Crabbe ran down the stairs looking giddy as a child. He forced himself to get up.
They reached the library, puffing from the stairs and sank gratefully into the large comfy chairs they always occupied. They practically owned the spot, tucked neatly away in the corner of the library, away from prying eyes and ears. Despite that, Pansy put up the usual privacy charms.
“But he’s there!” Draco heard Pansy’s shrill tones interrupt the moment. “Potter’s there! Someone grab him!” Draco raised his eyes to the roof in embarrassment.
“What’s Potter coming into Hogwarts for then?” Crabbe broke the silence. Thrusting them all back into considering their present and not Voldemorts.
He began to suspect something was very wrong when Snape appeared and hurriedly spoke to Dumbledore, his normal pasty skin now white as a sheet. Draco rushed to follow them as they walked away from the crowd. He rounded a corner and saw Snape thrusting his sleeve up to show Dumbledore a blackened Dark Mark- which Draco could tell, even from the distance, was moving. Snape’s face was a picture of fear.
His Father loved them. He saw the blonde hair of the man as he walked among them, a small peace in his collapsed world.
Minutes later they were running in comfortable silence and Draco discovered the benefits of running with a partner. He pushed himself, a subconscious part of him wanting to impress Blaise. Sure, it made his lungs and legs burn… but it was fun. Towards the end, they both began to sprint, wanting to beat each other.
He was startled as there was a tapping on his door, accompanied by the muffled voice of the house elf “
Snape looked up and saw Draco standing there, obviously stunned. He rushed over and gripped Draco’s shoulder. “I am being called. Which means he is back. Hide, do not be around when the word gets out. You will be a target.” Snape strode away, his robes billowing behind him. Draco stayed where he was, stuck. The thoughts crashing through his head.
Blaise smiled warmly “It’s fine. Anytime…” Then his expression changed to that of concern “Did you take my other advice? Have you talked to anyone?” Blaise sounded sincere and Draco felt guilty that he couldn’t talk to him. They began to walk back toward the castle.
She barely held back her laugh, and let out a squeak instead as Theo scared her from behind. Theo had finally decided to make an appearance, and was dressed in badly fitting dress robes.
He glanced around, marvelling at the quietness of the street as he strode down it. It did make it easier to get where he wanted to go, but something… didn’t feel right.
Draco and Blaise had gotten closer over the holidays, as Blaise was also living in the Malfoy manor now, due to his mother’s involvement. He didn’t seem to mind the death eaters being in the house, but kept Draco company as he was the only one of the same age around. It only made Dracl feel more confused about how he felt about the American.
It was as if he could not reach them… as if he wasn’t experiencing them the way he knew he should. His frown deepened, but he shook his head and and climbed onto the train after Pansy, who had given him a long hug a few minutes before. Even that had seemed subdued. Shouldn't he have felt something?
Draco froze. For a second, his head struggled to catch up with what he already knew what his father was alluding to. Everything stopped, his stomach and chest began to riot.
“I shan’t be selling it to you, Borgin. It shan't be moving from its location. But I would like some advice... It’s broken you see- if someone enters it, it deposits them in a random place.” Borgin nodded thoughtfully, which gave Draco hope. “Would you know how to fix it?”
And just like that, his face became serious. In a more confident voice he began to explain, “You just have to let your mind go into that really peaceful place like you do in occlumency...you know occlumency right?” He paused, and when greeted with stubborn Draco’s silence, just kept on going, “Right. And then, once you feel that silence, the feeling that nothing else can get in the way of that space, you summon either a memory, or a thought-” he closed his eyes “...or even just a fact that makes you not just happy... but
“What’s the plan then?” It came from Goyle, ever the follower, to dumb to see there was no plan. They didn’t know their enemies' movements. Draco was about to tell him as much when they heard the door of the common room open, followed by the soft mutterings of someone.
He had tried to convince them to remain behind, to let him go alone as he could go unnoticed because of Bellatrix's training. But they shocked him as they gleefully showed off their newly learned dissolusion charms that they had mastered too.
for your bloody cause- and I- I did barely anything of use at all!” He kicked at a large piece of rubble, wincing as it sent pain shooting through his foot.
“When creating the Dark Mark, The Dark Lord creates a fake, magical- kind of... blood connection, which means he can communicate to his followers-
Sometime later, snow began to fall, and Draco felt himself come back. He withdrew from the safe little space of nothingness in his mind. With it came the quiet realisations of lies he had shoved away long ago.
“The Slytherin quidditch team will be approved for training and playing, won’t it?” He deliberately made it sound more like an order than a question. Umbridge and Draco stared at each other, each with a fake smile on their face, two wolves having a fucking pissing contest.
He decided to focus on his upcoming exams and 15th birthday instead, wondering what Pansy had gotten for him. As he found out a few days later, she had organised a lunch for her, Crabbe, Goyle, Theo and Draco at his favourite restaurant in Hogsmeade. It was a lovely day full of laughter and good food, and Draco relished the opportunity to escape from his reality for a while. Afterwards, he found Snape's present on his bed, which was a Draught of Peace potion along with the note “
Draco hated the overly sweet tart. “No thank you,” He looked over to the cauldron with the blue steam still rising from it “...but I’ll gladly have some of the potion” Barely a second went by before an enchanted book slapped the back of his head.
“Narcissa, I adopted Harry three years ago. This girl here is Dani. His cousin, now sister. My new daughter.”
Sir, I am very sorry to bother you, but I need help. I think I am going to die. If not by the time you get this letter I will have been incredibly injured. Please help me. I know you don’t like me, but do it for my mom. Please sir, I will never ask anything from you again.
Snape raised his wand and did some intricate spell work. After about ten minutes Harry glowed bright white. It was so bright the three adults had to look away. When they looked back a completely different boy laid on the bed.
YEAR 12: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS AND FACE), MAGICAL EXHAUSTION, BROKEN FOREARM(RIGHT), VANISHED BONE( RIGHT FOREARM), BIT BY BASILISK, POISONED(BASILISK), BRUISED ESOPHAGUS, MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
“No, Narcissa. You didn’t. I really do appreciate it. It means a lot that you care for Draco that much.”
“Even though her father is one of the worst living creatures on the planet, she is mine too. She is half of me. I really do hope you are okay with this. After all she is going to need her Grandfather.” Harry had a small smile on his face.
Snape knew many things, one of those being, he had to help Harry. Even if only for Lily. In that moment he looked to the sky to ask Lily for her guidance. He felt a sudden warmth course through his body and then knew what he had to do.
“Blaise, hello dear, and Draco- my darling,” Draco’s mother looked considerably better now that Draco was home and she had befriended Anna, Blaise's mother- who carried the Italian Zambini name. The woman was drop-dead gorgeous and was a known widower. She had given Blaise his angular features and his eyes,
Draco relished the moment and then caught Potters attention, “Like them, Potter?” Potter’s eyes snapped to him and narrowed, malice and hatred within them. Draco smirked and continued “And this isn't all they do, look!" He put his wand on the badge, knowing its words were twisting into ‘Potter Stinks!’
Draco had long ago realised that he was gay. But he could never be attracted to Harry Potter. Being appreciative of a nice ass was one thing. And the only reason he stared at Potter so much was because he fucking hated him. But being attracted to him wasn’t acceptable. His father already hated gays. When his father had found the memory of Draco kissing Cassius Warrington last summer, he had beat him so much Draco had not risen from bed for a week. The crowd faded from Draco as his mind was taken back to the fists and curses that had rained down upon him. He felt his mind begin to retreat. Draco shuddered to think what would happen if his father got any hint of this new realisation, the Draco found Pott-
Turning red and looking around to see if anyone had seen, Draco made eye contact with Blaise, who had a small smile on those stupid lips. He had seen it Draco smiled back, turned to Goyle, desperate to look anywhere else. "So Goyle, tell me about your summer?"
He was glad when their plates floated over, as it gave them something to do other than sit in silence, with so much sitting between them.
The last paragraph where Mother had asked him to come home was torturing him. He knew he couldn't go home, his occlumency hadn't improved enough to face Father yet. And his Mother had hinted that his father wanted to “check his progress” that alone caused enough fear to stop him from caving and going home.
Everything in Draco’s head came to a standstill. He choked and gathered his mother up. They held each other as if their lives depended on it.
Draco’s point was proved as the pair proceeded to dance in the most awkward way he had ever seen. He suppressed a smile. Potter looked adorable-
Draco looked around, hoping to spot the male parts of the trio, as he was surprised Weasley hadn’t taken Granger. He saw how he looked at her-
He decided to refuse to feel anything and instead began digging his nails into his palms, looking for a way out of his thoughts.
The boy’s eyes were already closed as his body took the sharp blow from the killing curse. He had curved inwards, and crumpled silently to the ground. She had expected him to fight- he hadn't even raised his wand…
“Enter.” The call came from the inside of Snape’s office, and Draco was already pushing the heavy door open. It had only been a couple of months since he had entered the musty room which was filled with bottles of strange looking things and the jars of stranger looking things, but it felt like it had been so much longer.
forgot about you and your little call.” Draco actively suppressed the shudder Voldemort’s voice caused. “I almost- didn’t care. But I can’t ignore it now. Not after what happened with Arthur Weasley”
“Who said anything about yelling?” Draco pulled his arm from Blaise’s hand and walked away, Breathing deeply a few times and putting his mind into the familiar calculating state.
“I beg your pardon?” Snape was making him speak loud enough for the rest of the class to hear. Draco was beginning to feel uncomfortable.
Diagon Alley was practically deserted. The normally packed street that was usually filled with the colours of various people and their things was now empty and exposed to the elements- the empty cobblestone seeming completely wrong. The street was far too quiet, as not only were the people gone, but many of the shops too. Boards filled the windows of too many shopfronts, and the most prevalent sound was that the footsteps of the few couples that hurried along the street, dodging the eyes and attention of anyone they came across. Draco and his mother quickly became one of these couples as they made their way to the various stores still selling the supplies he would need for school.
Finally, two days later, Draco received a response from his Mother. It was in her handwriting, but was not written in her usual style. His stomach twisted itself into a rather large not upon that realisation. The writing was far too cold and simply informed him that she was ‘well’. He requested a meeting with her for lunch, hoping that he could see her face to face and have his worries put to rest, only to receive a reply a day later saying she was ‘too busy’ with the guests in her home. Draco knew then, with no doubts, that she was not writing the letters, or was being forced to.
and tortured. He began to question every thought he had ever had about muggle-borns as their screams echoed from the dungeons and into Draco’s dreams. He had been ignorant to call people mudbloods. He realised this, when their blood, which was the same crimson colour as his, covered the robes of death eaters that walked the halls of his house.
The students were all incredibly stupid to believe the prophet, but it was just a tactic his father had engineered to alienate Potter and Dumbledore from their peers. Father had already orchestrated the removal of Dumbledore from Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards. Seeing Potter’s distressed and angry face, Draco allowed himself to feel some pity for the boy who lived.
It was only after he was bandaged up and was trying to sleep that Draco’s brain fought through the shock and realised his father hasn't made a comment on the memory of him cheering for Harry at the first task, nor had he seen the memory of Harry calling him disgusting and Draco's reaction to it...or the memory of him dancing with Draco in his dreams. He had not heard Draco’s traitorous words which he had spoken to his Mother just that afternoon. Draco had buried those ones well enough not to be found.
Underneath the tree, the massive pile of presents spread quite far, with narrow paths leading to the centre. Pureblood families tended to spoil their children, and as many had returned for the Yule ball, they would receive their gifts at Hogwarts.
Draco walked into the great hall, chin high and shoulders straight. He had been too obvious the day before. He was
He reached out just as the screaming from the crowd reached it’s crescendo and placed the wand back in Harry's shirt, just above his hand which rested loosely on his chest. He leaned in, his voice as soft as his mothers had been. “Take it... it’s yours by right.” Just as Draco let go of the wand, he felt something change. The warmth somehow left him.
Snape only gave him his signature raised eyebrow before gesturing towards the door, “Come, I will escort you to your dormitory.”
It wasn’t until the end of the trip when they were taking their luggage down that Draco received solid proof that Potter was there and it hadn’t been his imagination.
“No!” He wrenched his hands from Blaise’s. “No- There’s a potion in my trunk that can heal me.” Draco used his wand to summon the small bottle from his trunk and saw Blaise looking at him with worry in his eyes.
Draco waited a minute for the medication to take effect- sighing as it did- and then left the room. Only to almost scream in fright as he came face to face with his mother.

“No. I- I can’t.” At his sceptical look, Draco apologised “I’m not being dramatic, I would like to… but- I really can’t.”
“Also," Harry's eyes dropped to focus of his hands, his tone was quiet and far more serious, "Snape wasn’t a death eater- and neither are you.”
Despite the empty room, Draco noticed Blaise casting a privacy charm as he took a seat after greeting all of them. After the smiles faded Draco realised how tense they all looked.
They hadn’t succeeded in staying hidden, but they had somehow stopped themselves from getting killed. Creatures and men alike chased them, cornered them, and got distracted or killed by other, more dangerous predators.
this is so stupid…” He exhaled and then moved to touch the ball with his wand. “You have to behave- okay?”
Dumbledore stood up and all the students turned to look at him, and were immediately quiet. Draco remained looking at Potter, who looked very tired and content. Draco couldn't remember the last time he had felt that way. Content. Happy. He sighed to himself and turned to finally pay attention to the headmaster.
Books and scrolls absolutely covered the walls, (Draco knew there was a secret door behind at least one of the panels) and the one wall the books didn’t fill was home to a large window overlooking the gardens which held a painting on each side of it. One was of the French countryside, where Lucious had spent much of his time in his youth, while the other was of Draco’s great grandfather, Septimus Malfoy, whom his father used as an advisor.
“You may rise.” Draco did so on shaky legs, hoping nobody could see that it were as if he were under a jelly legs jinx.
He knew how angry he would feel if he was in Potter’s position. Most of the wizard community didn't believe him because of the stupid newspapers, yet they were telling the absolute truth.
Eventually they returned and Draco retired to his rooms. He didn't want to come across his father, the fucking monster. He loved his mother more than anything. He started to pace, wondering how he could get them out of this mess. Nothing came to mind. Hitting Draco was one thing, but his
Harry Potter had died quickly, for Voldemort had not made his usual show of killing- he was obviously apprehensive of the boy who had continued to evade him time and time again.
His mother was crying in earnest now and Draco found he was too, but her shaky words had awoken a fear in him.
He coughed and watched as some snakes made of fire began striking at him, burning him, searing him, making him scream in pain. He felt his head descending into a manic state.
He felt even worse when on Monday Harry gave him a vile look as they walked towards Care of Magical Creatures. He couldn't imagine how he would feel if someone banned him from the sport, he knew Harry must get a similar amount of joy as Draco from flying.
He wandered out, the ingredients whizzing by him to find their place on his table, which was now accompanied by… Blaise.
“Shut up and eat” said Blaise, grinning and raising an eyebrow. Draco sighed and did as he was told with a smirk of his own.
He searched for an answer in his head before slowly asking the question “Why... would you ever meet my Father?”
Draco knew he had said it just to hurt him. Probably because he wanted to make Draco feel what he felt. Draco understood that, but it didn't stop Crabbe from getting what he wanted. Draco felt his chest constrict and his anger rise in reaction to the pain.
Sniggering, Draco gave Potter a last glance, noticing Potter still looked fairly rattled. Draco felt like shit for having caused that. They left, and heard the compartment door slam shut behind them.
“We will need the giants on our side for the coming war, Yaxley. They are stupid creatures and that makes them easier to control. Do not fail me.”
Draco had found he always felt worse if he didn’t start his day with a run. While all the days in Malfoy Manor were terrible, the worst ones were spent cooped up in his room, when the weather was too bad to run. Unfortunately, Draco often forgot how good running was for him, as waking up early wasn’t exactly his strong suit. So, to counter this, Blaise had stopped waiting for him and had started coming in before he was awake to force him to go running. Something which Draco both loved and hated him for.
The next couple of weeks he avoided Potter, hating having to interact with him at all. He was doing well enough at avoiding Potter, just making snide remarks in the occasional classes they shared together.
Draco pulled himself from his bed, groggy, yet knowing exactly what he had to do. He groaned as he looked down at his left arm, which was in a sling- It was going to make getting changed difficult.
“Hey, Blaise!” Draco called down the table, causing the boy to look up, halfway through a mouthful of food. Draco snorted at the sight. “How close are you to finishing breakfast?”
He reprimanded his brain, cringing at the thought of the boy who the Prophet and other papers had now labelled as ‘the Chosen One’ after denouncing him for the entirety of the previous year.
He shrugged, deciding it wasn’t worth it, then reached for his wand and flicked it, settling into his cloak as it wrapped itself around him. One more flick and his slippers were on his feet, and he was ready. He snuck out of the hospital wing, flinching at every creak and noise he made.
He was well into his breakfast and was chatting happily with Crabbe and Goyle about quidditch when he spotted his father’s owl swoop in, which he could recognise due to its signature grey shine. Draco’s stomach dropped, his father had never sent him an owl before, not at Hogwarts. What was so important that his father would send his own owl? Had he discovered that Mother had sent an owl?
He could not stop it from occasionally rearing it’s head, speaking truths in loud whispers at the back of his mind, reminding him of his cruelty and hypocrisy.
“Father,” Draco called, remembering, but discarding Blaise’s worry. His father paused and turned, looking annoyed.
The Professors lip curled at Draco’s cursing, but he made no move to reprimand Draco. He nodded, then flicked his wand at the door, opening it.
Draco shrugged, unable to answer that one. He had too much to think about just now, he really didn't have the energy to argue.
“And then,” She closed her eyes, her face holding a pained expression at the memories she was reliving. “He joined them
again. In came the fear, and the anger, the desperation- but also a warmth he had not realised was gone. The ball began to move into his mind, separating itself from the physical world. He guided it carefully into its box, and breathed a sigh of relief as it settled in.
He had watched as media outlets nationwide had discredited everything Potter and Dumbledore had said, and watched as the Minister for Magic went bat-shit crazy in his attempt to consolidate power.
They met up with their friends an hour later and spent most of the day in Gambol and Japes, as well as in Sugarplum's Sweets Shop. He found his mother at some point, and she informed him that she and Mrs Zabini were staying in Diagon Alley for dinner while he and Blaise were to go home at sundown.
The logical thing at that point might have been to accept his death and just let the fire take him, yet he began hauling Goyle up a pile of junk beside him, trying to outrun the fire.
“Draco, this is all happening too fast.” The usually gentle voice was rougher and full of panic “You must get yourself and your mother to safety. We can keep you safe. Tell her to come-” The second sound of a portkey snapped through the air, interrupting Dumbledore.
Blaise just looked at him, a confused expression on his face “My mother doesn't have an owl, he lets her use his.”
Going a little faster in pace here, going from the end of Christmas all the way to the beginning of the next chapter which shall be the Easter holidays, so be mindful of that.
Draco let a smile creep onto his face. “Yes, I do expect he will react rather nicely, we should show them to him tomorrow when we have potions... Snape shouldn’t mind too much.”
The third task had finally arrived. The quidditch stands were full of fans holding various coloured banners and cheering for their chosen champion, the sounds of which mixed together in a cacophony of ear piercing cries. Draco had placed a silencing charm around himself and been in relative peace, only to get hit by Pansy when she had realised after five minutes of talking to him that he couldn't hear her. He was no longer allowed to use the charm.
“Yeah,” said Blaise, “She said they’ve become good friends, and she’s managed to get close to her- apparently they have tea together most afternoons”
“Hello Harry” It felt odd to call him Harry, but Harry had just used Dracos given name so he did the same.
She ushered them in, seemingly excited by the possibility of work. As she bustled around, holding up various dark coloured fabrics to Draco and his mother, Draco felt something warm spreading in his chest-
“Are we safe?” Goyle's voice was quiet and had lost all character. They both were thinking of Crabbe.
that he had received when growing up had been all about social manipulation. His Father had seen it as a necessary part of growing into a broadly skilled young man.
Potters face changed once again, this time turning red accompanied by the expression of seething anger. Draco smiled.
She sighed and untangled herself from his arms. “Okay. Well- make sure you write me back, I’m going to be sending a lot of letters.”
Right as they had exited the room. They had rounded the corner and watched as Harry and the other two had come out of the room of hidden things. His timing could not have been worse.
“He’s an asshole, plain and simple.” Draco sneered at a painting who looked shocked at his language. “-He doesn't like how much influence Umbridge has here by herself. He knows people high up in the Ministry but doesn't have as much power over her as he’d like… so he wants someone to keep an eye on her… And that fell to me. Also- I figured that telling her I was showing you around the school would be a good enough excuse to come in early before class starts.”
. Too still. Suspicion filtered through the link between them and Draco felt panic begin to cut through him. Voldemort’s laugh echoed through his head and the panic increased tenfold. He felt his body begin to scream. Voldemort knew it was fake.
“You’re going to… use me?” Blaise shook his head then seemed to accept it. “Right. - Also, why does your father want with-”
A spell that looked like a full Body-bind narrowly missed a distracted Crabbe. Draco was not surprised to find that Weasley had shot it. Granger would not have missed.
So this year they had begun to create the fake memories in his mind. He gave her flowers, chocolates and (brief) kisses to convince his father that his gayness wasn't real anymore, that it had been a mistake. The next time Father looked into his mind he would see these memories. Draco hoped they would be enough.
Potter's broken into Gringotts and stolen something (AND GOTTEN OUT!) Seems impossible! But knowing Potter…
After a few quick scans of the various texts to refresh himself, he relaxed his mind through breathing exercises and then dove in.
Narcissa Black, for that was what she thought of herself now, was frightened. Her entire world was wrong. Draco was not with her.
Potter's eyes changed direction and he caught Draco staring. The champions face changed from uncomfortable to surprised. Draco knew the look came from his surprise at Draco's attire. All he ever saw Draco wearing were his baggy school robes. As Potter continued to stare in obvious shock, Draco took the chance to sneer at him. He turned away to find Pansy, who was helping herself to some of Theo’s drink and put a hand on her arm “Come on, let's dance” Pansy took a gulp of Theo's drink and coughed before looking at him and dismissing him with a wave of her hand “We can't, we have to wait for the champions to lead the dance.”
He began to search Draco’s mind for memories of Blaise, and Draco stood in shock as he flicked through the memories of them running, talking and eating together and finally found the one Draco had made that day of Blaise holding his hand and dragging him through the crowd in Diagon Alley. He had not buried it yet.
Pansy giggled. The necklace and earrings he had bought her sat on her neck and in her ears. They sparkled just like her eyes.
He finally rounded the corner and entered the courtyard, breathing in the fresh breeze. He stood there for a second, until a Ravenclaw pushed past him, muttering about blocking the walkway.
“You will need strength in the coming months.” Lucious was still eating calmly “Something is coming” His father's words were too similar to Snape's. A pang of worry appeared in Draco’s chest. He ignored it and continued to build his walls. He had almost finished when-
Hello! Sorry its been a while, I had a music festival I was attending and had no laptop, plus when I got back I realised there were some plot inconsistencies ect.
He pulled himself out of his bed, feeling like pure dragon shit and made his way down the stairs. All of them looked smart in their travelling robes.
As he was watching them all, he almost missed the skinny body that slipped out of the hall, not dressed in a dressing gown as most of the students were, but a weird sweater and torn pants that were made of an odd blue looking material.
He had come out to Pansy fairly quickly after realising he was gay, and she hadn't been surprised. She had simply stated that his “sense of fashion was far to good for a straight man”
all the time. And people who are good and kind hate me for it. What-” He knew the next sentence was very risky but could not stop it from tumbling out of his mouth, just as his other words had “What if
I know its not very nice that Draco still feels love for his father, however its quite common that victims of abuse, especially those that are victims of their parents, still feel attached.
Draco’s eyes immediately drifted from boredom and were drawn to the most out of place thing in the room.
“Mum, what did you think when father found the memory of Cassius?” It tumbled out- but once he had said it Draco felt as if he could finally breathe.
“He was on the first page that many times, you’d think the prophet would get tired of the witch hunt,” said Pansy “Also, he’s not even a celebrity anymore...more like an
“I mean,' said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, “if it's a question of influence with the Ministry, I don't think they've got much chance... from what my father says, they've been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years” Weasely shot him a very dirty look, but Granger’s hand was holding the redhead back.
Then he paused. Mother was still in that hellhole. He pulled the smile off his face, and felt his chest began to tighten, suddenly breathing was difficult. She was alone, with all those fucking deatheat-
As he crawled over to the waking form of Goyle, some distant part of him registered the fact that he had succeeded at stopping Crabbe and Goyle from killing Potter.
“This piece of paper declares you to be in charge of the family’s fortune when you reach your 17th birthday, and that you shall become the master of the house should something happen. You also cannot pass the position onto anyone else unless death, serious injury or incarceration occurs. Sign here” Draco paused, considering the implications. He sighed, realising once again, he had no choice. He raised his wand to the paper and his magical imprint was singed into the paper. The smell of smoke mixed with the smell of blood. His father nodded and tucked it away before stepping towards the doorway.
He breathed in the fresh air surrounding him and let a little of the constant tension go. It was difficult, as all he could think of was his mother, yet he knew he had to do it to survive. He couldn’t afford to punch any holes in any walls to release his rage, especially if they were the stone walls that the castle happened to be made of. Nor could he throw vases or photos across rooms. Or scream, or cry, or breakdown… no one could see him like that. He had to learn how to control his emotions in case he blew up and caused more trouble than he could handle.
Aries finally met Cissy and they hit it off immediately. Draco was always mad at his mother for ‘stealing’ Aries from him. He had pouted all the way to the train.
After a few minutes after Draco collected himself, both he and Snape helped Harry back to his bed. Snape then left letting Harry know he would return later. Draco grabbed a chair and sat next to Harry.
Several voices rose claiming to be with Harry. A smile grew on his face. Ron’s face on the other hand grew several shades of red.
They only had a little while longer before the rest of the students arrived. Harry had a ball of nerves sitting like a rock in his stomach. Not only for the new school year, but for the memory he had last night.
“Draco, it is very obvious. Not to him, but to everyone else. He likes you too. He just doesn’t think you like him. He is afraid that because of Lily you or anyone else won’t want to be with him. While I am not sure how I feel about you yet, I can tell he likes you. I have been practically his sister since we were eleven and he saved my life.”
“She was in minor distress for a while, but she will be ok. Your magic protected her. I am going to get Pomfrey.” Harry nodded and Draco left.
“Oh, that’s new. Cat got your tongue?” the man laughed. “Well, Potter, no issue, I’ll just send in the healer to check tadpole for you.”
“Well sir, I have to ask you something. You see, I have a secret crush on someone and don’t know how to tell them. I was wondering if I could practice with you. I just know you would be honest with me if it isn’t good.” Pansy reasoned.
“You really think I don’t know that? Me? I feel I would know more than anyone. You try marrying the asshole and get him to talk about anything else. Yes, he will be pissed, but he will have to get over it.”
“Ok, rules. Someone will spin the bottle, whoever it lands on has to pick truth or dare. You cannot refuse. When done, that person spins, etc. Who goes first?” Pansy explained.
It took a few minutes before they could resume the game. Pansy spun the bottle. It spun around and around. Circle after circle until it landed on Aries.
Harry gasps and grabs Draco’s hair. Draco hollows out his cheeks making Harry thrust his hips up. He pushes another finger in and starts scissoring them, stretching out the tight ring of muscles.
Hermione knelt down and said, “don’t worry Harry we will get you to Madame Pomfrey. Neville has Ron.” She released him from the body bind.
“Please, Professor. Mister Snape is my Father. Call me Aries.” He replied with a smirk causing several giggles filled the room.
Draco nodded and pulled up Harry’s shirt, exposing his stomach. He fired the numbing spells as best as he could. Draco was not trained medically. The only reason he worked as one for Tom was because he was smart and read a lot of medical books. He was the best trained in the room and they couldn’t wait for Poppy to get here.
Snape had him learn Occlumency correctly this time. They had found out the glamour covering Harry from Aries had also hidden different abilities. He was actually very good at potions and wandless magic. He and his father did have a running joke to speak only in parseltongue around Snape. It irritated the man to no end, but the other had found it hilarious.
“That’s what Tom called her. I didn’t know what he was talking about at the time, but it kinda stuck. I think I’m going to name her Lily. After my mother. Father would like that. He adopted me because he loved her so much. It is one way to pay him back I guess.” Harry said.
Snape ignored him and pulled a couple hairs from his head. He uncorked the vial he had run to get. He threw them both into the potion. Closed it and shook.
Aries replied, not paying enough attention. “I had the sword of Gryf-Wait, What? What did you just call me?”
Aries smiled and pounced. Draco chuckled as his face was attacked with Aries lips. It was cute until Aries grabbed a handful of Darco’s arse.
Severus Snape loved his summers. No brats to teach. No grading papers. No Albus Dumbledore. No Harry Potter.
Sorry about how long it has taken me to get this chapter to you, but I am finally back into the swing of work after COVID. I hope you guys liked this one.
While Hermione was gone Draco and Harry just sat in the Gryffindor common room in silence. Both knowing that their bubble of happiness was about to pop.
“Could you dim the lights? Okay, Harry the lights are lower. Can you open your eyes? I need to check you over.”
Draco just stood there, mouth open, staring. Snape came to his side while smirking. He used one finger to close Draco’s mouth.
Harry started to cry when talking about the rapes his uncle had inflicted upon him. That was when Snape knew Harry was not lying. He knew Harry hated the attention he received from his fame, so he would never make this up to get attention.
“I ran a spell diagnostic over after I found out. I hadn’t before because a muggle caused the injuries. I didn’t need to. I showed a very powerful glamour. I can either leave it on or remove it. I didn’t want to until you told me to.” Snape said.
“Now, my boy, I don’t know where you came up with that, but it certainly is not true. However, I will get to the point of your visit. I want to ask how you are settling in. So, how is everything?”
For one of the first times in his teaching career he had gone and hugged a student. He had soothed students before, sure. First years who were home sick. Older students who had family die, but he had never physically interacted with one before. Especially one from a house other than his own.
Draco made quick work of their clothes. He kissed Harry until he was hard and panting. Draco kissed and licked his way down Harry’s torso, pausing to pay attention to Harry’s nipples then continued. When he reached his target, He accioed the lube they kept in the side table.
“All I can tell you is, I did everything I could. Severus told me about the baby, do you know what you are going to do about it?” Draco asked trying to keep the emotion out of his voice.
He closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the pillow. Harry had never given thoughts to a family. He expected to die when he faces Tom. He immediately knew what to do. He had never had a family to love him, but now he would. He finally had something to live for. He planned to die while trying to kill the now father of his child. Now he had the perfect weapon. Tom wouldn’t fight Harry while he was pregnant with his only heir. He could face Tom before he gave birth and the man would not try to kill him. He knew why Tom had chosen him. He was Harry Potter. One of the most powerful wizards in the world.
“Of course he didn’t. Dumbledore probably took him straight to the castle to keep you from trying to hex him.”
Harry led Dani over to his friends. “Dani, this is Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, and Draco Malfoy. If you ever need something, these are the people to ask. Guys, this is my cousin Danica, but she likes Dani.”
“My name is Harry Potter. I am not going to hurt her. Plus, carrying this little one would make that hard to do.”
Harry cut her off. “Don’t bother. I knew I was going to lose him because of this. I just hoped I was wrong. Draco, can we go back home now? I want to lay down. I’m tired.”
“Well if it is anything other than Slytherin, I will be surprised. Mother and Father were both in Slytherin.”
Tom just grabbed his hand and pulled him over. He pointed to Harry’s knee. There was a spot there that was darker than the rest of the skin surrounding it.
Aries started kissing his way down to Draco’s chest. He licked one of the nipples in front of him and pinched the other.  A soft moan escaped his lips as Aries ran his tongue down his torso until he was on his knees in front of him, his thickening cock inches from his face.  Aries took his dick into his hand and began to massage it as his other hand fondled Draco’s sack.
They all took their seats. Pansy asked about Aries and he told them the story he told Draco. He also told them about what they told Dumbledore.
“Alright, maybe you should tell me what happened.” Snape said as he waved his wand bringing over the kettle.
He still hung out in Gryffindor with Hermione, Neville, and Ginny. While Ginny had been absent for the first part of school, she had definitely made up for it. They had charmed the ring, so only those who knew about it could see it. Outside of those who were present, only Hermione knew. They still didn’t know who the spy was, so they didn’t trust anyone one hundred percent. They had tested Hermione under Veritaserum at her insistence. She didn’t want anyone to doubt her. They had also found out she had started dating Luna.
Aries nodded and followed his mother to his room. As soon as the door shut Aries was wrapped in his mother’s arms.
Im sorry Im sorry Im sorry Im sorry This story isn't up to me. It is up to my fingers and keyboard. I control neither...
They drew back and looked into each other's eyes. Neither wanted to break the silence of the perfect moment.
“We are doing potions that require partners for the first section. I have chosen them. As I call them out, move to them. Granger, Parkinson. Weasley, Goyle. Longbottom, Bulstrode. Greengrass, Finnegan. Malfoy, Snape.”
“My throat hurts, but I’m used to it. Please explain to me what you just said? How am I your son? You and who else? You said you were my mother, so who is my father? Who are Lily and James then? I just have a lot of questions, but start with why Malfoy is here and who that is.”
“Love, you can call me whatever you want. Within reason. You can just call me Severus if you wish. Whatever you are comfortable with. Just make sure it is Professor Snape in lessons. I don’t need students thinking I’m going soft or playing favorites.”
“We can talk about it tomorrow. Snape needs to talk to you and Dani, as well. I finally convinced him to leave and go to bed. He got back right as Hermione brought you in. He has been a mess. Really though, Potter? I leave you alone for a few hours and you almost get yourself killed. What am I going to do with you?”
They are almost asleep when Harry whispers, “Don’t forget, you told Lily you would take to get a pet tomorrow. I vote for a snake. Or a crup. Or a kneazle.”
Draco released an almost inaudible moan which caused Aries to smirk in his direction. The sinks moved to reveal the entrance.
“As it happens he is not dead. He was stolen from us. We found him again only a few days ago. We thought it would be good for you two to meet, seeing as you are only two months difference in age. He will be going to Hogwarts this year and it would be good for him to know someone in his year.”
“Wait. Harry’s alive? You lied to me? All I have ever wanted to do is apologise for how I used to treat him, but you told me he died. I could have apologised? Mother, Father you are going to sign those papers. You are going to do it now. I am going to stay with Piers for a few days. I am just glad Dani got out while she still could. I will never forgive you. Please tell Harry how sorry I am. For everything.” With that Dudley turned and left, slamming the door behind him.
“Draco! Sit down and shut up! I can handle this. She did not hurt me. It was her brother. We are going to at least hear her out.” Harry interrupted and motioned for Ginny to talk.
“Well, I think what happened was due to the...trauma you suffered, your brain simply wouldn’t allow you to speak. When you wanted to speak badly enough, it let you.” Snape replied.
“Severus, who could this possibly be to get this kind of reaction out of you? The only child I have ever seen you care for is your godson.” Lucius said from the doorway.
“Alright, listen because I will not say this more than once. First years, These are the rules. Learn them, live them. First, Do not wander around the castle with any less than three to a group. Slytherins are targets for older students and I don’t want to have to be in the hospital wing more than necessary. Second, don’t get caught. I don’t care what you do, but if you get caught, any punishment you get will be doubled by me. You are supposed to be cunning. Use it. Finally, If you are having any problems, you are to come to a prefect, head of house, or me. My door is always open, however, if I do not answer, I am brewing something that cannot be disrupted or is dangerous. Now all dorm placements are on the board. You are now free to do whatever until curfew. Aries, come with me please.”
Snape saw it and froze. Lucius who was still in the room got curious and went to look. He looked at the birthmark causing the problems. He froze as well. It was in the shape of a ram. Lucius had only ever seen that birthmark in that place once. Only on, “Aries?”
“Push past me. If you want to help her, push past me and threaten them. I love Dani. I can’t see her hurt.” Dudley whispered.
“Fine! I will go, but if this is just a ploy for attention, I will have an owl for dinner.” He glared at the bird and grabbed his wand.
“Young Draco, since you have done well, You will not suffer for the doubt you just displayed. Only this once. My spy will come to you when the time is right. I cannot risk him being found out quite yet. You are dismissed.”
Well I got my Covid test results back and I have it so I’m stuck in the house for the next two weeks at least. So I’ll be updating this as often as I can.
“I am guessing there is some kind of preservation charm on the chamber or some such. It should be decayed, yet it looks like it died minutes ago. I’m sorry you died, Sally.” Aries said as he put his hand on the snake's face between the eyes.
They all flowed back into the conversation they were having before and talked until the train ground to a halt.
“That is a good point. I don’t know that he hates you exactly, but he doesn’t know Aries. He is here actually. Just a few doors down. He was at Blaise Zabini’s the night I brought you here but returned the next day. He doesn’t know about you yet. We warded your room so he nor Cissy would come here. The house elves were told to not mention you or that this room was in use at all. Let me go ask Tom what he thinks.”
“That is what I like to hear, my boy. Now, my spy within the walls of the school has told me you are protecting my slave. That you have grown close to him and he trusts you. That you may be involved with him. Is this true? Remember, I like honesty.”
Aries went to the cupboard for the ingredients and was almost done when he was suddenly knocked into, pushing two vials to the floor. They broke on impact and mixed together. Aries pushed whoever knocked into him into the corner and put a shield around the spill. Not a second later it exploded. Snape rushed in.
Draco exhaled and leaned back in his chair. Something big was happening. He didn’t know what, but the fact that the Dark Lord had panicked in such a way made him almost certain something was big going to happen in Hogsmede or Hogwarts.
The smell of her perfume wasn't there. He frowned. She grasped his back weakly, seeming to need the contact, “How are you?” Draco asked, head still in her hair.
His fathers magic grabbed his arm, and dragged him back. “Don’t you dare walk away from me you little-” His father exhaled. “I don’t have time for this. Come.” His father released him and turned away and gestured to the door next to him- the basement.
Draco heard Crabbe’s squeak of delight as the Chosen One appeared in front of them, but the noise was covered by the sounds of the battle commencing.
Eventually, Snape seemed to realised Draco could go no further. “Enough”  Snape handed him the potion that would help with the headache. Draco nodded and thankfully took the potion, knowing that meant their lesson was over.
His Mother’s whisper in his ear was so quiet it might not have happened. His hairs raised themselves off him, and he felt a shiver of thunder ripple across his skin. The odd sensation of blood returning to his face.
They quickly went into the Ally and started shopping. By the time they needed to meet Ron and Hermione they were finished and Harry was exhausted.
“Mr. Snape, you are to come with me to sort you into a house. Follow me. You are to be sorted after the first years.”
“Draco, stop. I know. I know you would do everything you could for me. Do you remember how I told you every night I get a new memory from my time there?” Draco nodded. His worry sky rocketed. “Well last night, it was actually a good one. I don’t remember Tom leaving or being there, but I remember you coming in. You sat down next to me after healing me. I started to cry. You just held my hand and told me it would be ok. Then you hugged me, promised to get me out.”
“So, how exactly did you kill Sally, Harry?” He said as smoothly as if he asked what kind of ice cream Aries liked.
“Draco is not a death eater and this baby is not ‘death eater spawn’. This is MY baby not anyone else’s. MY baby. Lily is MY baby. I am seven months along. She is about ten inches long. She is getting eyelids. She has taste buds, eyelashes, eyebrows, hair, a mouth, fingers, and toes. She is a human being. Don’t act like she is rubbish that needs to get thrown out.” Harry was crying now, but not backing down.
“Lily. I like that. You can stick to the frog theme and call her Lily pad.” Harry laughed at that. “Come on, let’s go talk to your father.” Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and led them out of Gryffindor Tower towards the dungeons.
“Talk first. Then and only if he wants to can you hug him. Harry we will be right outside the door. Shout if we are needed.” Snape opened the door and left. Draco was about to follow when Harry stopped him. “Dray, could you stay actually?” He simply nodded and shut the door.
After everything that happened at the Ministry, we can no longer be around you. We are sorry you lost Sirius, but if you had just listened to me about rushing , it wouldn’t have happened. A lot wouldn’t have happened. No one would have been hurt. Luna would still be able to walk. Ginny wouldn’t have broken her wand arm. Ron wouldn’t have had a concussion so bad he stutters now. You would still have us. As I said a lot wouldn’t have happened. Neville and I are the only ones who didn’t get physical injuries. Just mental ones. I haven’t been able to sleep without nightmares.
“Harry? Harry? Are you here?” Silence was his only reply. He ran to the door and out. Directly to Snape’s room. He pounded on the door. After five minutes of no answer, his heart paused again. That could only mean one thing.
They reached the top of the stairs when another contraction hit. Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and covered his mouth to stop the screaming.
“What’s wrong Dray? Are you Hurt” Dani asked. She had taken to calling him that since she decided Draco was too weird.
Finally after another month of planning, Hermione and Draco finalized the baby shower. It was happening in just a few hours. They were worried it would be too late to have as Harry was almost at nine months. For male pregnancy, anywhere after month eight was a due date.
“You know what? I am done. I am not leaving. I am not going back to the Dursleys. I am NOT getting rid of MY daughter! You can go fuck yourself with your wand if you think that is going to happen!” Harry knew he was shouting, but he didn’t care. “You have been a manipulative son of a bitch from day one and I am done listening to your bullshit.”
Harry said nothing as always and went to work. He worked on dinner for an hour and a half before he was done.
Harry was unable to apparate due to Lily, so they all portkeyed to the Leaky Cauldron. Even though Harry’s bump was hidden by thick cloaks and glamours, he still felt like everyone could see it.
“I want you to know, no matter what, I am here for you. Night or day. You say the word and I drop everything to be there. I-”
“Wait. Your son that you thought was dead is here? Like, right now? Merlin, Sev. I am so happy you have him back. I know how much that was hurting you even all these years later. So, when can I meet him?” Draco asked excitedly.
“That is exactly what I was hoping to hear. You have gone above and beyond, young Draco. I only meant for you to protect the child while it was here. Given that is no longer the situation, you took it upon yourself to continue my orders beyond necessary. I do believe that is the best thing you could have done. Then, beyond that you still have managed a bond with that traitor. Oh, with you, as well as my spy, things are going even better than I had planned. Tell me, how is my child?”
“Then I hope you won’t be mad when I do this.” Draco said. He walked around the bed to stand next to Harry. He dug in his pocket and pulled out a little black box. He knelt down to the ground and opened the box. Narcissa, Snape, Dani, and Harry all gasped. The silver ring was beautiful. It had one emerald and one diamond sitting next to one another on two entwined silver bands. I wasn’t too girly or too manly. I was the perfect ring.
“Hmm-” his Father interrupted him again “Is that who has been teaching you occlumency? Snape? He was always rather good at it.”
“Don’t interrupt me.” He ignored her reaction “I don’t want you involved. They know what Borgin sells- and we’ve already had multiple things taken from the Manor. We can’t give them an excuse... It
Draco grabbed the body of stunned Goyle and began dragging him along, thankful for his workouts once again.
been suppressing a lot of his emotions- primarily his anger... for a long time- perhaps this was similar.
Please feel free to leave comments (constructive only) on what I could have done better- for example- I believe Snape and Draco's relationship was really important to his character development and I should have explored it way more. Or, "Your portrayal of x was great!" Hows my combat? Hows my intense physical stuff?
Ever since Potter had failed to dispute the rumors that he was Bi, Draco had found himself watching the star of the school more and more. He was curious and was trying to see if Potter displayed any characteristics that might identify him as gay.
“Draco, wake up” Blaise came into focus as Draco attempted to wake up, cursing the occlumency headache. He had still been practising defending his mind, despite the apparent futility of it. Voldemort would always be more powerful than him.
She, like the rest of the death eaters, held her breath up until the moment Voldemort let out a strangled cry and collapsed shortly after killing Potter.
Draco panicked, and it focused his mind enough that for a second, he felt in control. “Ouch!” He yelled and shoved Malkin’s hand away. “Watch where you’re putting your pins,
Are you guys getting the switching perspectives? Also, how do you like Evil Draco? Borgin and Bourkes is probably the longest scene he gets... but if you like him ill put in more fleshed out scenes.
“Ready?” said the oaf, looking around at the class, his beady looking eyes looking more excited than Draco had seen them in a while. “Right, well, I've bin savin' a trip inter the Forest fer yer fifth year. Thought we'd go an' see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what we're studyin' today is pretty rare, I reckon I'm probably the on'y person in Britain who's managed ter train 'em.”
Pomfrey rushed over, her face pinched and focused. She kneeled over him- and then they were both obscured from sight by Krum’s fellow Durmstrang students crowding around. Within a couple of minutes, he was rushed to the medical ward. Draco watched as several galleons changed hands in response to the first casualty- and as he followed the money he noticed the Weasley twins seemed to be the centre of the gambling.
The only solace he found was with the piano, and the escape it offered from his mind. He lost himself in his practice, to the point where his fingers and wrists would ache after each session.
“Well, it was lovely to make your acquaintance boys, but class is beginning now, so if you would please make your way to your seats.”
Potter, who had shoved Draco into this fucking mess by forcing his father to go to prison, who didn’t have the Dark Lord breathing down his neck, didn’t have a mark he despised
It was only after getting up and hitting his boxing bag for ten minutes that his brain could focus enough to see the last two letters which lay unopened on the table.
Draco frowned, disgusted “Mother... why are we still with him?” The angry words came out before he could stop them. His mother inhaled the scent of another flower, her hand still shaking and little blue lights rose from it in response to her touch. He could sense another prepared answer coming.
"Maybe he's been messing with stuff that's too big for him, if you get my drift." Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who looked pale.
“A drink for the teachers and guests above seventeen to drink at the ball” Without looking, Snape slid a fist-sized box across the table. Draco had none of Snape’s careful reserves and ripped the wrapping off. Snape raised an eyebrow to his grin.
He stepped back as he realised why. He had momentarily forgotten in the midst of their silly conversation.
He checked the piece of parchment he always kept with him. It was charmed with the Protean charm and allowed him to talk to Pansy. He had sent it’s sister to her shortly after being imprisoned- he knew after spending time with Luna that talking with someone often made him feel better. This was as close as he could get.
Crabbe had raised his wand too, so Draco continued speaking. “That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter,” he pointed his Mother’s through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle, getting ready to cast a shield charm. But still he held his cover, hoping Granger and Weasley would come from wherever they had fucked off to so he wouldn't have to give himself away.
“You,” she turned to Draco “Never cast a protego too early. It will simply allow me to fire a spell that cannot be blocked by a protego, as I just did- and it is a drain on your magic. I’m getting some water. We will go again after lunch.” She swept from the room.
“You have no idea.” Aries pushed his lips against Draco’s, causing another moan. Aries seized the opportunity to push his tongue into the mouth held against his. He lowered his body onto Draco’s and felt a hardness against his own.
“I apologise, My Lord. If I take the baby out down there it could easily get sick and die. I am only thinking of your heir.” He replied.
Getting a three year old on a sugar high to bed was a challenge. Wedding cake had that effect. Singing had become Lily’s favorite thing to fall asleep to. Harry wasn’t the greatest, but don’t ask Lily. She would stand up for her mum with her entire being. She had definitely inherited her dad’s stubbornness.
“Hermione, calm down. It is ok. I knew he might do this when I told you. We just have to get through it.” Harry smiled at her. He stood up from the table to look at the group that had gathered around him. Several gasps were heard as they took in his appearance.
“Aries Snape.” Murmurs went up all around them. He walked up and sat on the stool. The hat was then placed on his head.
I finally got to go back to work, so no more a new chapter every day sadly. I will post as often as I can.
Snape turned and saw a cloud of green smoke next to the boy on the bed. Tom sat down in shock. Lucius just stood there staring. Snape fell to his knees in disbelief.
Aries chuckled, but scooted over. Draco jumped into his bed. They laid side by side, facing each other.
After dropping a immensely cheered up little girl off at Gryffindor Tower, the boys went back to the dungeons. They were at Harry’s new room when Harry asked Draco, “can you stay? I don’t want to be alone.”
Harry rode the train to Kings Cross like normal. Instead of meeting Uncle Vernon, he would catch the Knight bus to the Leaky Cauldron. There he would meet Snape. They went straight to the Ministry of Magic. Three hours, three arrests, and forty signed documents later, Harry Potter was officially Harry Prince. They decide to keep it completely on the down low as to not arouse suspicion of Snape’s double crossing duties.
His glasses had been smashed into his face causing blood to flow. He had blood running from his nose and mouth as well. Snape didn’t even stop to think about what other injuries the child might have and apperated them to the one place he knew no one would look for them.
Aries picked up his book and waved his hand. A big gust of wind pushed the redhead onto his arse in the corridor and the compartment door shut and locked.
He neared the large doors and slowed to a stand still. Closing his eyes, he prepared himself for what lay on the other side. He pushed and was greeted by more silence.
“Ah, Weasley. Did you finally decide to ditch the blood traitors and join us?” Draco said with obvious disdain.
“Harry, she is in the girl’s dorm refusing to come out. I can try to get her, but can’t-” Hermione started.
“Now, I know why I couldn’t hug you before you told me. You are huge.” She said out loud this time letting go of him.
He had just sat down with a good book and glass of fire whiskey in hand. He wore flannel pajama bottoms and a black tee-shirt. His hair was tied back in a very elegant way.
Dumbledore had spoken to Harry the day before. He had decided it was too dangerous for Harry to be in the Tower, so he had set aside a private room. It was down the hall from his father’s room, but he really didn’t look forward to sleeping alone. He had begged to just sleep in his room in his father’s chambers, but Dumbledore had refused.
