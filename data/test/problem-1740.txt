The balding redhead shook his head and gave his own version of a weak smile. "Yes, but nothing too detailed yet," he said in a placating tone. "It might please you to know, though, that Healer Rosewood informed the other members of her team that you are to be treated as Ginny's next of kin alongside us, despite your not officially being married to her."
"Blimey, I forgot about that detail," Ron grumbled, but Ella stood up with a smile.
Draco sighed. It was one of those times when he felt he was becoming more liberal-minded than he desired. Had he really been neglecting his duties as a husband while fulfilling those as a father?
"Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy," a smiling witch greeted with a French accent. She was very pretty, but Draco automatically decided that her face would have easily been eclipsed in a crowd by Astoria's understated beauty. It was just the difference in the way they held themselves - this welcoming witch tried too hard, while Astoria was just comfortable in her own skin. And that, for Draco, made her stand out all the more.
Potter - Harry, dammit! - cast a Tempus. "Quarter past seven."
Harry sighed, not bothering to hide how much heavier he felt now. "Like I said before, I do love you and I want you to be happy. I see you with James and I know that you mean it, and you do like being around him but... I don't think you're truly happy unless you're competing."
"Exactly, and I was hoping to get much more, you imbecile."
She looked back at him. "I plan to stay."
Harry couldn't help but ask himself for the seventh time. In front of him, Malfoy seemed to shrink into himself. Not physically, of course, but Harry felt like he knew his old nemesis at a level so profound that every little gesture of nerves that the blond showed was enough for Harry to imagine what he might be feeling. It was so very rare to see Malfoy shrinking metaphorically, when all he had ever done was to make sure that everyone knew he was larger than life. The sight went against all he believed Malfoy should be, which made him take a different tactic.
Draco couldn't help but roll his eyes. "Perhaps it might be because of the threat to our lives? Or is that too trivial to be taken seriously?"
be adding that memory of Harry trying to 'boogie down like a unicorn' to his private Pensieve.
If anyone had told his Hogwarts self that he would ever willingly subject himself to extended periods of exposure to the Golden Trio, Draco would have sent them a hex or three. Maybe up the arse, for good measure.
"Well..." How could he explain it when even he couldn't understand how and why he felt this way? "You do remember that S
"I know," the blond whispered. "And I've always been just Draco."
Harry nodded in agreement. "I dunno, I reckon I realized just how much closer we've gotten, and I doubt the others are really aware, you know?"
Something in the blonde's expression shifted, but there was only silence, which made Harry think he made the right conclusions.
Harry insisted that Draco come through that night when Ginny and the kids were already asleep. "I'm sorry," he blurted out. "I know it can't have been easy for you lately…"
"Bloody hell!"
"Yeah, Ron's told me as much, when we were, you know, still deciding how to...with the baby..."
Earlier last year, Andromeda had sat with her long-estranged sister and nephew, and encouraged them to foster their familial connection to Teddy. At that time, Astoria had still been expecting Scorpius, and Draco had informed his aunt that he had no experience in handling children of Teddy's age. Having heard Harry's stories had given him a rough idea of what it meant to have one's hands full of noisy, messy Metamorphmagus.
"Insecure?!" Draco repeated in disbelief. "Me? Insecure?"
"Yeah, but having James in the picture... it's just... I'm sorry Harry, I just can't help but be a bit sad for Jamie, and he's still so young and impressionable."
"Was it an exercise in futility, then?" Malfoy asked defensively.
"Did you get to name your son?" Malfoy's question took him out of his wandering thoughts.
"I swear to Merlin, you will regret even coming into my life and ruining it. I don't care if what you say is true, if Astoria was behind this then you will both suffer!
"Might I remind you that I am no longer a Malfoy," said Narcissa haughtily, but with her eyes twinkling. "I am Lady Black after all, and I will shower my only son with as much affection as I desire, especially since he had decided to come home unannounced after half a year abroad!"
were to remain hidden indefinitely. I don't even need you to tell me that neither your mother nor your wife would be amenable to that option."
As they walked in companionable silence towards the waiting area nearest Ginny's room, Harry fell once again into his tumultuous thoughts.
, Harry thought somewhat sadly. It was like the time someone commented offhandedly that Harry had done something worthy of Slytherin, and Ron had quickly blanched and said that Harry was as much a Slytherin as Ron was a Malfoy. Some stupid comment like that.
"I've requested for an indefinite leave of absence," she said. "It's not like I'm retiring or whatever. But priorities are priorities, and you two are at the top of mine."
He turned around at the sound of his wife's voice. "It's hardly a crime," he countered, though somewhat sheepishly. "And besides, I'm completely under his thrall now."
"How thoughtful of you," Harry said wryly. "Now, what's this about, that it called for some decency, as you so nicely put it?"
"It was just an idea," Ginny said lightly. "We should check in with Hermione more, if Ron's still full time at the Ministry and Mum and Dad are in France, she'll need all the help she can get."
"Er… I just meant… you're here, and Scorp is here, and it's late and you told me earlier that no one at the Manor will mind… er, I mean… Teddy would love if -"
"Fine, fine, so we're quits," he offered, raising an eyebrow at Draco.
Apart from Potter, that is. Draco had forgotten about that.
The probation itself was not very constricting. He was not allowed to leave the country, or use any spells that could be used as offensive or hurtful to others. He was even allowed to continue brewing potions, for as long as he worked within a prescribed list of legal potions. He could come and go as he pleased around Wizarding Britain, even though he had almost no intention of going out unless needed.
"What was in the memories?" he asked Potter. He fixed him with his trademark stare. "Why didn't you want to tell me?"
When he got there, Narcissa immediately flicked her wand towards the double doors, sealing them within her suite.
: It's how I defeated Voldemort.
As he had promised, Malfoy's session wasn't anything memorable, though he hadn't been present to oversee it personally as he was assigned to a couple of witches from the Muggle Liaison office. He was able to bid him goodbye, though, when Malfoy had tapped on his door and said he was done and leaving.
Harry and Ginny had taken Healer Rosewood's precautions seriously, but both of them were still quite shocked when Ginny had to be rushed immediately to St. Mungo's just shy of seven months into her pregnancy, face scrunched in pain and hand grasping painfully at Harry's arm. The sudden burst of adrenaline did absolutely nothing for Harry's nerves when she was levitated into one of the warded rooms, so he sat outside, trying and failing to pretend that he was in control of himself. Because he pretty much wasn't.
been used in active duty. Malfoy had the security clearance, and he was becoming desperate. He thought it was for the best, even if it was still strictly experimental. He requested it specifically."
"Is it true?"
Narcissa looked at him with a calculating look. "Yes, but not everyone would drop everything to help a Malfoy, much less my son."
Draco remained silent but stared pointedly at the Minister.
The boy pouted, but obediently did as Harry said, after saying goodbye to his grandmother. When he disappeared into one of the doors in the hall, Andromeda bade goodbye to Harry, obviously in a rush to leave. She even gave a hesitant tod towards Draco, who respectfully bade her goodbye as well.
Harry gritted his teeth and prepared for a biting remark, but then he saw Malfoy's expression change for a second and he immediately decided not to let their schoolyard immaturity get the better of him tonight. "Why did you call?" he asked, trying to keep the impatience from his voice.
And what was the big deal anyway? It wasn't a crime to invite a friend to stay the night, was it? Ron always stayed after too many beers.
"Well, we know that it's really difficult to work on so much conjecture" Potter added, "and it's asking a lot from you. None of our resident potion experts were able to crack it. You're at the top of the list of Potions Masters in the entire continent now, and if you can't solve it, I don't think anyone else can."
Ron answered with a chuckle. "Nah, mate, you're trapped here just like the rest of us, at least until after midnight."
"None of your business, Malfoy," the brunet said in a low voice. "You were saying?"
"See here," Harry said, pointing at a particular parchment filled with various tables and lists. "He told me that these particular apothecaries are the most sought after for higher quality botanical ingredients."
Ginny shook her head. "Maybe for now, sure, but… what about in the future? What if… well, I'm sure we'll have to reassess our living arrangements when we'll both need to have our own space again."
Astoria seemed to consider her answer first before finally speaking, eyes never leaving Draco. "Yes."
"It's one of the more difficult things about loving someone," Harry said nonchalantly. His thoughts strayed to Albus Dumbledore and his mutterings about the greatest power.
Harry gave out an exaggerated sigh, but motioned upstairs anyway. "Alright, and I'll change the nappies," he said, laughing.
: Thank you. Speaking of Ms. Weasley, how is your relationship? What is it really like for someone quite ordinary to be dating a person of immense fame and celebrity?
"He's still mine."
"Nothing, it's just… you sounded like Aragorn when he said that line."
"Oh, er," Potter seemed to be a little less forthcoming now. "Well, Sirius Black was the last heir," he said slowly.
"Well, I, ah..."
"So who else, then?" the brunet demanded to his desk, fist slamming hard on it in frustration.
"You're not him, Draco. You're more than Lucius could have ever been. Much more. And for what it's worth, I really do believe you'd make a great dad," she added matter-of-factly.
"How's that been for you?" Harry asked, curious. "I mean, I never had either of my parents around, but you actually got to know yours before he passed away. Er, not sure exactly how well you two got along…"
"You're talking about the woman who insisted on a wedding on the eve of Voldemort's take-over of the Minsitry. I think her priorities might be a little muddled."
And then Potter had had the decency to smile at him, emerald eyes blurred with unnoticed tears, and he'd fallen haphazardly into the dreamless sleep that Draco had sincerely wished him after such a stressful night.
Harry got up from his seat and started pacing again. He was pretty sure he'd worn down a sizeable chunk of his office carpet, but he couldn't really give a damn right now because his best mate was in trouble. This wasn't just about his duty. This shit just became
Anyway, here's what's written in my plot notes: "Harry and Ginny were actively using contraceptive spells but failed to cast them one night when they were already in the heat of the moment. On the other hand, Ron and Hermione, were using the same contraceptive spells, and didn't fail to cast them properly (coz they're actually responsible), but Hermione's fluctuating magic messed it up (but she has no idea even now).
Harry choked on his drink as Malfoy sputtered in indignation.
"Oh," Draco said. "No, that was everything I'd figured out."
"That's pretty careless of you to let your guard down in front of me then, big time Auror that you are," Draco said haughtily, annoyed at the fact that Potter had dropped this bomb on him and then treating it as if it were nothing of importance. Then he realized what it meant, that he hadn't even told his best mates. Draco suddenly felt ashamed.
Potter's face, Draco had noticed, was pale and lifeless (if that could be an appropriate word), and the tone of his voice brought about the same amount of excitement as Professor Binns. Neither Potter nor Weasley had mentioned anything other than the case brief, so Draco had been torn between wanting to broach the subject, and staying politely silent but desperately wanting to smack him upside his head. Wisely (or maybe not), he elected to remain oblivious to whatever problems Potter had, so now he was stuck in a conversation about murders and arrests. He still wanted to hit him, though.
As Harry thrust hard into her, again and again, and as she moaned and cried and showered him with kisses, hot and wet, he lost all sense of thought. All he knew was that they were alone, together, in their own world, closed off from everything else. He barely paid attention to the building pressure inside him, or the way that Ginny was clutching him hard while in the throes of pleasure. When he came, hard, he couldn't have remembered his own name as he pushed all of himself into her, letting go of every single thought and feeling the thrum of passion in his ears as he finally fell into her waiting arms, and sleep took hold.
"I think... I think I was afraid to marry you," Ginny suddenly said softly, as if afraid to voice it out. "It's only recently that I've realized, I don't really like being tied down, to one person, or one place, or... I don't know. I feel... grounded. I didn't realize that until two days ago, when I found out..."
"Yes, we already know that," Hermione interrupted. "The bindings are focused on Harry's magical core but also feeds on those that he places the wards on. There are no practical limitations on the number of the individuals or the distance of these individuals from the focus. Meaning that Ron and I could go to Australia for a year and Harry's privacy wards on us would still be as strong as the first day."
Draco shrugged. "I'd keep it that way, if possible. I mean, I wouldn't want Weasley or Granger to be privy to all the embarrassing things I've already admitted to you. Unless you want them to know about all that shit you ranted last time…"
"Yes, I see how all of that ties into your... predicament." Rosewood twirled her wand one last time against Ginny's abdomen. "There," she said gently, indicating to Ginny that she could go back to her seat.
"They hate me," Hermione interrupted. "They always make excuses for why I'm not qualified for legislation, how I couldn't ever be as good as the others...
Seriously, it's not a big deal," Potter said stubbornly. "Just agree already."
: Yes, exactly. The previous system was seriously lacking. It all just focused on material evidence, and we all know how that can easily be tampered with. There was so much bias. I saw it happen many times when I was young. I-In my fourth year, the man who had Polyjuiced into Alastor Moody, he tricked me and almost got me killed. We heard his entire plan under Veritaserum, and there was so much information there. He'd had this entirely shocking history, he had so many plans going on that no one even knew about. He could have provided helpful info to the Ministry even in prison, we could have used it to fill in missing blanks about the rise of Voldemort, and the Death Eaters. But Fudge just brought in a Dementor, there wasn't even a trial, and he was Kissed. Just like that.
?" he asked. "Don't the elves usually take care of such tasks?"
"See here, Malfoy," he said with a menacing undertone, "we've already established fact from fiction, right? All of this," he gestured arbitrarily around him, "was a perfectly executed heist. Everything went according to plan! Well…except for the brat, that wasn't according to the plan, was it, darling?"
It was Harry's turn to laugh. "So did Gin. Maybe that's what drew me to her, come to think of it. Never really had a lot of people say things straight to my face. Even Ron and Hermione are sometimes careful of what they say to me. Ginny was just up in my face if she wanted."
Not that the entire situation had been solved in the blink of an eye, of course. The entire family was still at odds at how Harry and Ginny would be able to handle their now family of four while not being together. It was something that Arthur had reminded everyone was between Harry and Ginny, and that it was no one else's business. Add to that the fact that it had to be kept from the public again.
"It's appalling!" she exclaimed. "Elves, take care of your children!"
"Astoria? Darling, are you alright? Astoria, please wake up!"
"It'll be quick," Potter reassured, though with a frown. "It won't be my full process, so it'll just be a light incantation and then a record of your simplified mind map will be kept in the secure archives."
He was mistaken, however. "Apparently, my gratitude should be given instead," she said, voice low and smooth like dark chocolate. "You seem to have a copy of the book that I've been meaning to look for."
"Which means more evidence," Rogers said.
Hermione let out a breathy sigh. "I need to be on top of my game, Harry. All the time. In the Council, I'm constantly surrounded by older, more experienced wizards who never seem to lose their doubts about my credentials. I need to prove that I'm more than my blood, that I'm more than just that."
As usual, Teddy had not remained in his room as promised, and Harry sometimes had a feeling that his godson might have extra strong hearing abilities to have heard Draco from upstairs. His cousin didn't seem to mind, though.
"I couldn't have said all of that and expect them to believe me. After everything Skeeter wrote about me, I doubt they'd take my word for it."
The joking tone and teasing smirk contrasted completely with the sudden and horrific shock to Draco's system. He was an intelligent lad. He knew to piece clues together, and…
Pansy hadn't been kidding about the mood swings and cravings. Just the last week, Astoria had Draco running all over the place to get her what she wanted, and he happily obliged. He had grown up watching his father treat his mother like a queen, and now he knew what it felt like. He wanted to shower her with his affection, wanted to make sure she got everything that she every needed. He supposed part of it was his own excitement at becoming a father, and he made sure to show her everyday how much it meant to him. Their alliance had still gone strong, even after three years, and he felt that their relationship was definitely a step up from the usual Pureblood marriages. Now that they were going to have an heir of their own, well, he felt like he had everything he had ever wanted, and so focused on making sure that his wife had hers, too. It was a small price to pay.
: That's what you're here for anyway.
handsomely over the last few years."
Harry sighed into his pillow. This was the first time in years that he had felt truly vulnerable, and it scared him, but there was obviously just something left of the old rivalry between him and Malfoy that left him feeling odd. He turned over in bed, feeling restless. The best thing to do was just to treat Malfoy as normally as possible, as if nothing strange had happened.
His mother had been awarded the same stipulations. She could visit others, or have her friends visit her. Her magic was limited, but since she barely used magic outside the mansion, that stipulation only affected her minutely. Their possessions, purchases and interactions were to be closely monitored. They had a curfew, which was even more lenient than the curfew at Hogwarts.
Stiff as a Petrificus, Draco watched as Potter sent him one last warning gaze, and before reverting almost immediately into the happy host he had been just a few minutes earlier. Promising himself that he would hash it out with the stubborn brunette another time, he went to the empty place set for him next to Teddy and went through the motions of breakfast.
Harry let out a shaky breath and turned to face her. His expression was cool. "Ginny. Honestly. I am fucking sick of being Fate's plaything. I am absolutely tired of having to just accept whatever the fuck is thrown at me, I hate that my major life decisions are never true choices, but are just whatever is left over. This is NOT how I expected the rest of my life to be, and goddamnit I want it to just be fucking normal for once and not have some twist of fate turn everything upside down every time I think it's all fine!"
Draco went out again into the hall, this time looking around the place with the goal of identifying it from his childhood memories. That was when his beer-laden mind came to the question.
Their eyes met, and via silent communication borne from years of being in trouble together, they agreed never to mention this conversation, ever.
Draco, as always, tucked his lovely wife into bed and went to back to his son's bedside, where he just sat and watched, Scorpius' gentle breathing becoming a lullaby that effortlessly sent him to a dreamless slumber.
Malfoy nodded politely at their acknowledgment and tentatively approached their booth. "What brings you law enforcers here?" he asked, all small talk and none of the venom that may have been exchanged only years ago. "I didn't think your crowd would appreciate small haunts like this."
Ginny took his hand. "I'm really, truly happy for you."
"Ah, that's half the fun, Draco," Harry hinted mischievously. "Because we'll be making the cake from scratch."
"What, with the temperature?" Draco scoffed. "Just a minor rise causes my son to feel discomfort, so I've dealt with it proactively since I found out. It's been difficult since Astoria prefers warmer climes, so we have Scorpius' rooms on a different setting from the rest of the Manor."
"We've got a pretty good theory on how," he suddenly said, trying to keep his voice calm. It wouldn't do to get Ginny riled up. With everything going on, he just couldn’t risk her becoming even more upset now that he finally knew… not when her emotions were already taking a toll on both of them.
"Anything for you."
"Yeah," Ron said in agreement, "we think Pince is the same thing. Pettigrew had been more of a footman or a mere servant, but he held the key to the Dark ritual that brought Voldemort a new body. We at the MMI think that Pince has been kept out of the loop, but may have highly significant information, despite the fact that he himself might not be aware."
He was currently sitting with the Savior and the Weasel in one of the more private booths in the back. At 6 o'clock, Viridian's patrons were currently transitioning between the people who came for after-work drinks, and those who were coming to have dinner, so the three of them could enjoy the advantage of less distraction and more privacy during the awkward hours.
Then more seriously, he looked her straight in the eye. "So...What now?"
" Draco gasped. That was a lot of people.
"It scares me."
It was then that Draco put together both sides of what he heard from Weasley and Hermione. "You know, Hermione," he began in a slow, soothing voice, "in the Wizarding world, children are cherished. Dare I say it, the tradition was to start as early as possible, and have as many offspring that a couple could manage to raise. The Weasleys are a very good example, actually."
"I've already done it plenty of times," the Auror offered, shrugging. "If that's what makes you so nervous. It won't be the first time I do this."
"Because I'm so sick of being told that I can't do it!"
"I'm guessing you haven't seen the paper, then?" Hermione said, looking slightly nervous. "Do you have the Prophet with you?'
his son.
Hermione practically lit up, beaming at him now. "You know... Just hearing you lecture me about wizarding history... it's obvious that your son or daughter will be very much loved and cherished."
s wards is the direct result of its running on one's magical core. For as long as the focus desires the existence of wards, the magical intent behind it will automatically power the wards no matter how many or how far, or even how long in terms of time."
"You can help me take care of him, if that's what you mean," he suggested.
"Apparently, the mood swings get much worse over time," he said with a slight grimace, "So you should, in fact, be asking
The blond matriarch shook her head, though her eyes remained focused on the tome in her hands. "There is none that is as all-encompassing in physical and magical protection as this one. The only known ward that is superior to this is the
Draco watched warily as Potter walked over to him, arms crossed over his chest. Weasley and Granger were busy in the kitchen, so he figured they had a few minutes to themselves.
"Oh, you'd be surprised," Potter said. "The Ministry underestimated Pettigrew," he said. "Even I made the mistake of letting him go once, and we all know how that got out of hand." He looked Draco in the eye, and held his gaze. "I won't make the same mistake. I'm sure that Pince holds the key to unravelling this series of murders. "And right now, as much as I'd hate to admit it, you're the key to our investigation."
Draco relented. "Yes, the items were transliterated from an archaic labelling system from old Scandinavia."
Malfoy snickered. "Are you saying you surrender first?"
Harry stifled a laugh. He felt better, having this talk. "Well, as much as I love George, I thought I saw him poking his wand around randomly in our sitting room, so I think we should go and make sure he doesn't set off any fireworks inside the flat."
It had only come to Harry the previous night to owl Malfoy. If he were being honest with himself, he was surprised that he hadn't come up with the idea earlier, considering that the blonde was considered one of the brightest Potions experts. Obviously, since his consultancy for the Department of Mysteries was highly confidential, as was the nature of the case, Harry had had to word his desperate letter in such a way that would not draw attention. He had sent it off first thing in the morning, hoping to hear back from the man by the evening. Thank Merlin that Malfoy had picked up the severity of his (kind of stupid) message. Now that Harry knew Malfoy was willing to help them, he had felt much better and was able to greet Andromeda and Teddy without the usual burden on his back.
The question he kept avoiding was
Astoria was absent, as Draco hadn't wanted her around for Hermione's big reveal. Instead, he had advised her to rest in their private suite before lying halfheartedly about where he would be. Her pallor as of late was a cause of concern for him, and he wanted to do anything to lessen the anxiety plaguing his poor wife.
Once his best friend had gone, Harry dropped his head into his hands. So many things were happening now, but all he could think of was how Draco looked, half-asleep on his couch in the middle of
Draco sniffled, which Harry thought was kind of adorable. "It makes me look weak," he grumbled. "I mean, look at me, all curled up on the Savior's couch, desperately waiting for an update."
have much more than the family name to back him up. Which is why he all but snarled to his captor.
Harry suddenly felt as if his insides had been cleanly cut out from him - just empty and hollow. And that was not what he expected feeling upon hearing that he was to have another child. This was not the way a happy couple was meant to react to the news that they were expecting. Perhaps that was a pretty clear sign that something was definitely wrong here.
"Your standards."
"Draco!" Narcissa's voice called in between all the frantic knocking.
Harry let out a shaky breath. "Neither do I."
"Astoria has been waiting for you," Narcissa announced when Draco appeared in her side of the Manor. "Something to do with Scorpius, I believe."
"I said, we should check in on Hermione."
Draco shook his head in laughter. "You flatterer, you!" he accused her.
"I'd love that," he finally answered, glad when Harry's expression brightened even more. "I do have an idea for later, actually."
The silence that came between them brought no calm.
Astounded as he was that his wife was able to secure the required international Portkey permits in only two days, Draco still felt odd about coming back home to British soil. After much thinking, he realized that it had been one of the few times he had spent that many days in the presence of both his son and his wife, the three of them together. Something about it had made him feel more light-hearted, and he wondered if there was any truth to the rubbish about falling for someone again and again.
"It's-" Harry took another deep breath and let it out, before attempting to continue again. "It's not what you think."
"I'm very sorry to hear that," Harry finally offered in his most polite but sincere voice.
He had realized after the war that he more than anyone else would have to fight for his name and honor every single day. He already knew that very few would take him seriously, or even give him their attention. He therefore promised to do everything in his power to regain the respect he deserved. Focusing on his appearance may have sounded mere vanity by others, but Draco was a calculating soul, and he made it clear that he was doing the very opposite of languishing in the shame and shadow of his family's history. No, none of that. He would, in fact, do everything in his power to show the world that he would stand up and fight to redeem the Malfoy family honor, and do it all while still looking good.
Still, he refused to wallow. He knew that his and Ginny's situation was difficult, but they had had that routine for years, and only James had called for cause to change it up. Harry remembered Dumbledore's words, how it is one's choices that make them who they truly are. He had made promises to Ginny, and she to him, and both of them to James, and they had agreed to do everything they could to work it out without having to sacrifice so much of themselves in the process. It was more difficult than, say, Ron and Hermione. They had two children between them, but they managed because of some help from Molly and Arthur. Harry had too much pride to ask for Molly's help too often, and he took pride in knowing that he himself was caring for his son. It didn't make him any less lonely, though.
Ginny's tears became even worse, and she started sobbing and buried her face in his chest. He placed his arms gently around her, soothing her.
Draco scrunched his face when he lifted his head from the couch. He saw Harry trying to sit up but failing.
Ginny's voice was full of doubt and uncertainty, which made Harry feel guilty, which was stupid because there wasn't any reason for him to feel guilty.
Ron shrugged. "You see, Malfoy, very few Muggles follow the concept of arranged marriages. Hermione tells me that most of them marry for love."
"I told you," Harry insisted, "the names of the stuff were really obscure, so we think it's written either in code, which is unlikely for the bloke we got the memory from, or in a sort of potioneer's shorthand. We only know it's a recipe because of the quantities written before the names."
"Well?"
"And need for control in the kitchen," Hermione added with a smile.
"He's my godson," Harry supplied quietly. "He's a metamorphmagus, just like his mother. She was your cousin," he said pointedly to Malfoy, who merely nodded."
She didn't speak for a while, which alarmed Draco somewhat, but he stayed the entire time that she was silent. Finally though, she seemed to realize his presence again after several minutes. "I'm sorry, Draco," she sighed. "I didn't mean to bother you so late at night-"
"Potter?!"
Ron laughed. "It's been working out fine, really. It's not so big a difference when you think about it, I mean in the end, it's two people who agree to be bonded for the rest of their lives, right? Stipulations or no, you both decide to be together anyway."
When he felt that she had let out most of her excitement to the sky, he sat down on one of the lounges he had there, and beckoned her.
Harry turned to her, recalling that it had been done in utmost secrecy. "It's one of the newer ones developed by the Unspeakables. I completely forgot because it wasn't routine; I don't even think it's
"Auror Potter?" A Healer had come out from the room.
"No, I was the one who told her to go ahead and leave for Montreal."
"I love you, Hermione. I want what's best for you. It's always different for everyone. For Ginny, being on a broom chasing a Quaffle 16 hours a day brings her so much joy that she brings it home and shares it with me and James. What do you take home with you to share with your family?
"Yes, yes, to ensure that the readings are accurate. But what-"
There was a slight movement from out of the corner of his eye, which Harry instinctively knew to be Draco waving his wand. "What was that for?" he demanded suspiciously.
Harry chuckled. "Learned all my lessons from experience as well. I eventually figured out that all those times that I couldn't get James to settle were just caused by his discomfort. To think that I kept flipping him over and peeking at his nappies and trying to feed him. Wouldn't stop wailing like a banshee."
She quirked up an eyebrow at his defense of his old enemy. "You know I still can't believe how close you blokes have gotten in such a short time. Considering all your history."
With that, she turned away and marched back towards the Manor, and Draco was left speechless. Was this just so she could gloat at him about being right? But it had to be more serious than that, or she wouldn't have cut his morning walk short.
After another hour of shuffling papers and scribbling quick notes, Harry heard a sharp tap on his window. In no time, he had a rather regal-looking Eagle owl swoop into the room. He took the crisp envelope clasped in its beak before he gave the beautiful bird a few owl treats. He already knew who wrote him, as he had been waiting all day for a favorable reply. An elegant script flowed on the parchment, while the contents of the letter were short and succinct.
Harry tried to ignore them.
"Are you free to go to him?" she asked bluntly. "It's just... we know Harry and he won't be open or direct about it, but he really does need someone around when he's under stress like this...but I have to wait for approval to leave early and so does Ron."
So far, Harry's predictable lack of luck was on a roll. Unfortunately. At this point, he knew to expect the worst of anything with a sort of sad resignation.
"What's he shouting about, Potter?" Draco complained irritably.
"Not a morning person?" Malfoy inquired, his voice closer.
"And what?" he asked, still not sure how this had anything to do with her fainting.
"Potter, I'm sorry- I didn't-I know it's late but-" he stammered, about to cut the connection.
Harry stood up instantly, as did Ron, Hermione, and the entire Weasley clan, who had pretty much set up camp in St. Mungo's. The Healer held out his hand to the redheads, and they slumped back down on their chairs. He beckoned to Harry, and led him into the room.
"I wouldn't have minded," Draco said somewhat more seriously than he had intended. He hoped to Merlin he didn't sound wounded. Malfoy egos were not supposed to be easily bruised after all. Not that his was, of course. He was just annoyed. That was it. "Anyway, you digress."
Potter scrunched his face in thought. "Does that mean anything for the Aurors?"
"Is there no alternative ward, Narcissa?" Astoria asked, siphoning off the dust from the book she was reading using her wand. "Perhaps this one is too much trouble, we might be wasting precious time when there might be another, better one."
On the long walk up the lifts to Shacklebolt's wing, Draco thought about how much more interesting Potter had become since he called up the
"Don't tell anyone, first," he said seriously. He knew his two best friends would respect his privacy anyway. "Not even the family," he told Ron. "It's something that has to come straight from me and Ginny."
Harry could only bite his lip to contain his nerves.
There was only a month left until the birth of their son, and Draco had yet to discover the extent of his patience. So far, he had gone above and beyond the call of duty, obliging Astoria and providing anything and everything she asked for with no question. He felt smug about it, of course, and wasted no chance of flaunting his perfect self to his new friends. Because that's what Potter and Weasley had become to him. In actuality, the two blokes were very helpful when it came to preparing for his imminent fatherhood, and Draco was very grateful for things to have turned out the way they had.
But Harry had known instantly, deep within him, that he was happy with the news. He was shocked, of course! He had been stunned for a few seconds,and then became more ecstatic as he realized that
"No, they won't let me," Ginny acknowledged resignedly, "but I can't have myself missing the rest. Just because I can't fly doesn't mean I can't learn the moves and study the formations with the others. Six months is a long time to miss training, Harry."
"Why is this necessary?" Draco couldn't help but ask. "Isn't our blood what's more important here?"
"You seem to have a clear idea of what to do from this point on," she said gently.
"Anyway, he thought it was unfair that you were going to have an open hearing. He thought it was only an excuse for officials to humiliate you and get you to react in such a way as to incriminate yourself in public."
"Harry..."
"Why would you compare her to a horse?!" Ron cried. Harry chuckled despite the seriousness of the situation.
"Of course," Potter replied nonchalantly, as if the conversation hadn't just confirmed to Draco the extent of magical power he might be hiding in his very average-looking self. "I'd do anything to make sure that they were all safe. They mean too much to me."
Of course it was Malfoy. Who else could it be?
"What've we got so far? Remind me."
Ginny bit her lip but made her way towards the couch opposite Harry. It was one of those rare days when she didn't stay at the training grounds with the rest of the Harpies, so Harry knew that he had to seize the moment.
bindings. He knew it had been devised millennia ago by the precedents of the Wizengamot, as a way to protect certain individuals with stations so high that their celebrity constantly put them in danger. He knew enough about magical theory to understand that the invocation was a combination of warding and good old magical law. The magical bindings on Harry would act as personal wards, shielding Harry himself from the outside world. People who wanted to share personal information about him, without his express permission, found that they couldn't. If he so wished, he could go around warding himself so that people wouldn't notice or recognize him unless he wished it. He could even push the bindings outwards to shield other people to an extent. In effect, it was as if Potter was wrapped with a Fidelius Charm around the clock.
Ginny squeezed his hand with both of hers. "Look, I don't mean to say that what we had, or maybe even still have, isn't significant. It is. You have been such a big part of my life and I'm happy that we have two beautiful boys as a testament to our love. That's not something you can just regret, you know. It's just more obvious to me now that our love just isn't the romantic kind, and we will probably find that in other people. Someday."
Harry let him have the silence needed to gather his thoughts. The fact that the man had actually agreed to step into his Floo in his sleepwear was kind of a hint of how serious his desperation was.
"How does she feel?"
"Well," she said, imperiously waving him over to enter her private sitting room. "Why don't you settle yourself comfortably, as this happens to be one of my favorite topics to talk about."
At that moment, Weasley chose to emit a particularly loud snort, which seemed to bring back Draco's perspective despite the echoes of the hangover. His thoughts lingered on Pott - Harr -
Draco snorted. "Wow, that explained everything," he said sarcastically, rolling his eyes.
She halted, turning her blue eyes, so striking in their sharpness, on her son. "My concern grows for every day that this… matter… remains unsolved." She held up her hand imperiously when Draco moved to defend his friends. "Yes, my dragon, I know that Potter's little team has been providing us with their assistance. However, there is much about our situation that worries me, as they are so closely intertwined with the ancient magicks of our family."
The last few months had not been easy for any of them, he reflected somewhat bitterly.
As the four of them settled into the sitting room, Harry and Ron fell into Quidditch talk while Malfoy and Hermione joined Teddy on the floor (well, Hermione settled into the armchair closest to them). It was all so typical, that it made Harry want to laugh out loud at the absurdity that his life was finally looking to be as regular as it could be.
Harry smiled and returned the same level of excitement. "That's right, they should come through within the hour, so you'd best get dressed up!"
Unfortunately, the happy ambience didn't last. "Er, Harry?" Ron asked hesitantly. "Have you heard from Malfoy yet?"
Draco took a deep breath. "I'll contact Andy myself. I'm sure she wouldn't mind. We are all willing to do anything just to find out what might be blocking Scorpius' magic."
Malfoy gave Harry a look of confusion. "But-"
"He doesn't know, does he? He can't sense him?"
, he thought ruefully. Despite all the hassles of being Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, Hero of the Wizarding World and Vanquisher of Voldemort, he had wanted to be a part of the rehabilitation of the magical realm he had grown into. When the dust of the Second Wizard War had settled, Harry found himself needing to be of service, to ensure that the Ministry wouldn't fall back into its corrupt history for as long as he was alive and kicking. It was who he was, and it was what he wanted. His decision, of course, spread like wildfire and countless owls peppered him with notes that promised full support of his noble cause.
"Your family has been threatened, Malfoy," the man deadpanned. "There's no higher security that we can provide. We don't even know who or what exactly might be 'taken' from you, we have no idea when or where the possible attack might happen. We cannot take this lightly because there are too many unidentified factors for us to be sure of your safety."
"Harry, there's nothing wrong about having a child first," Hermione reminded him. "Even the wizarding world is understanding of that, and there isn't any nonsense about children being born out of wedlock. Besides, you and Gin are engaged anyway."
The more he thought about it, the more Draco remembered blurred memories of Narcissa sneaking in a little squeeze of his shoulder, or a quick kiss to his forehead. Kind words and warm touches in a sea of punishments and high expectations. She had always appeared haughty and indifferent to others, but never, never to Draco. And after that long and emotional conversation. Draco vowed to always show his mother how very special he thought her to be, and how much he actually loved her.
He was surprised when Hermione's eyes shone with tears but her smile seemed to become even bigger and warmer. "Thank you, Draco, oh thank you, we'll owe you for this!"
Weasley, turning 20, is obviously the youngest player in the entire 2001 roster, but has nevertheless impressed even her most hateful hecklers with an amazing record of 26 successful goals out of the 29 that the Harpies scored in all, and in her first professional match at that. Interviews with the team confirm that she has put in the same amount of hard-work and commitment in her training. O'Finnicks was quick to add, "This has absolutely nothing to do with her private relationships. Weasley has always been a marvelous Chaser, and her record speaks for itself. Don't even attempt to mention anything about Harry Potter pulling strings, unless you want a noseful of bats in your face."
Ron pursed his lips, probably trying to think of the right thing to say. He was in a difficult position, Harry realized, stuck between his best mate and his sister.
"You misunderstand me," Hermione answered. "I just need to take the same samples from your sister, Andromeda, and her grandson."
"I'll be fine, darling," she said, waving his worry away with her arm. "Eventually I'll get used to having more time on my hands. There are people I need to Floo anyway, so tonight would be a good time for me to do so. I'm afraid I miss travelling to the continent, but I've been advised to stay in one country for now."
, he thought bitterly). He surveyed the banquet hall they were in, silently thanking Merlin that no one had been close enough to notice him drifting off.
He was surprised at the simple envelope that was set on the round circular table in the hall. There was no name or address indicated. It was sealed. "It does not bear any of our family seals," he noted to the small figure cowering beside him.
"We'll look into it," Ron ensured, going into his Auror-on-the-job role.
It took a full month to herd all the Aurors into and out of the MMI, and Harry was
When Draco nodded, Harry caught his attention. "We'll be able to record where you've been. We'd be able to pinpoint your location if necessary. Are you sure?" He knew how fussy Draco was with his privacy.
Harry laughed to himself. He thought it was amusing that Draco always insisted on calling her by her full name. Probably some pureblood thing. "We're… doing what we can," he answered shortly. "It's not perfect yet, but we’re dealing with it."
Potter trusted him.
"I'll be back right after the six weeks, Harry," Ginny finally said, as they felt the first few rays of the sun slowly break into their room. "We can owl each other, I'll find some way of communicating as often as possible from there. I'll fight the coaches if I have to, I promise, Harry, I just - I don't want you thinking that this doesn't mean anything to me. You- you and James are everything to me, Harry. Believe me when I say that."
Harry cracked one eye open in the bright sunlight and groaned. He sort of had an idea where he was, but a part of him was now burning in equal parts of embarrassment and guilt.
wards can add to your already formidable layers of protection."
Macmillan nodded, patting Draco on the back before rushing out the room.
Most times, Harry felt his flat was his only true sanctuary. His rooftop brought him solace and comfort. Now it felt like there was no space that could ever allow him to escape, not even for a little peace of mind. It was as if his thoughts buzzed in his ear all the time, preventing him from even thinking to himself. There was so much white noise that it had ruined even the quiet that he once found in this space. He kicked an errant pebble in front of him, and watched it fall from the enchanted height.
Hermione laughed delightedly. "Oh yes, there is that," she mused. "Ron and Harry confessed to me that they'd had to resort to hitting the pubs more often just to offset what they claimed was me and Ginny 'going barmy'."
"Any idea what your mum might name him then?" Harry asked, after deftly catching the flying biscuit and stuffing it into his mouth. Malfoy shook his head. Harry shrugged. "I guess it's not the same for you then if you can shrug your shoulders like that. It does take away a lot of pressure, you lucky bastard. I had Arthur, Molly and Ginny to please while I spent months deciding on a name."
"Up north," Harry supplied, remembering the old man's enthusiastic retelling of his adventures. "Somewhere in Sweden, I think. Luna's boyfriend, Rolf, he was the one who told me that Xeno was actually telling the truth."
"Harry," she greeted, and they hugged briefly before she leaned away, still gripping Harry by the shoulders. "Thank you so much for doing this. I know you've been busy with James, and Molly is up all night tending to Hugo..."
Harry groaned. The man had no heart, he was sure of it. "What've we got to do this time?" he asked, already admitting defeat. No one had warned him of all the parchment work he'd have to live with.
It was Narcissa's turn to be under the spotlight, and Draco could see that she loathed his decision to turn the tables on her. "I was merely working from conjecture, dear," she said softly.
"Malfoy," Weasley greeted, getting straight to the point. "Auror Philius Stone needs you to er, reconfirm, for the nth time, that you and Macmillan were willing witnesses. Just sign and put your magical signature on the three copies. Shouldn't take too long."
"Harry, please don't talk like that," Ginny said, tears in her eyes. She scooted as close to Harry as he would allow. "I'm sorry," she whispered, "I'm really sorry, Harry. Please. I love you so much, and I never want you to forget that. I've loved you through every little up and down that we've had, through all the shite we've been through, I love you and James so much... so, so much..."
Draco tipped the last of his butterbeer into his mouth delicately, before continuing the conversation. The kids were mostly asleep (with Potter forcing a sleepy Teddy into the bedroom down the hall) and all the pleasantries had run dry, so it was now time for the more serious topics.
Then Ginny pulled him close and said no.
"Ginny's back in her element," Harry said matter-of-factly. "She was all out of sorts when she was here. She didn't complain about it in the few months she stayed home with me, but... she just wasn't herself."
"I knew that already," Harry said, unable to hide the tone of pride in his voice. Who would've imagined that his girl would be playing for the country in the upcoming World Cup?!
"If I'm to be honest, that actually makes me feel better," Draco admitted. He carefully ran his fingers through his hair. Harry could not help but stare at the action, though he still tried to hang onto the blond's words.
"But - " She looked down into the red hair of her son. ”Did it really make a difference?"
: No, of course, not. It wasn't like it was a favor. I presented him with all the facts, made the proposal and everything. I just made him see the need for such a department.
"I meant that figuratively
Having James had been a complete life changer for her, who had never had to be responsible for anyone else but herself. Harry of course, had
"Yes, addressed to me. No traceable magical signature. But the odd thing is that it made it through with our mail, so it somehow bypassed the security wards in our estate."
In the unerring way only to be expected from a Slytherin, Draco knew at once that something else was on Potter's mind that day. And it was something bad.
Hermione gave him her patented stink eye before turning back to Harry. "I'm sure that a good talk between the two of you will be able to at least clear up the unspoken issues. Perhaps..."
As if on cue, the awkward air between them was interrupted by the sudden reappearance of little Teddy, who had a grumbling but smiling Weasley following close behind. Neither of the two noticed anything out of the ordinary, settling themselves in their respective seats around the table.
Andromeda looked at the blond man as if he were something she couldn't identify. "That is quite a feat, young man, given the bad blood between."
"Mother, please," he begged, now sounding frantic in the face of ignorance. "Tell me!"
Harry liked that he could cause Draco to snort whenever he quoted his favorite lines along with the characters on the screen. He didn't care though, and he mostly kept on doing it because it seemed to amuse the blond so much.
"I told you, we've tried, time and again, but it just didn't work anymore," the brunet said evenly, though with a slight hitch in his voice that the other two failed to notice, or just pretended not to. "We both looked closely at where we are now, what we used to want together, and where we want to be eventually. Looks like the way our relationship developed over the last couple years has helped us to grow and find our way, but we have ended up on different paths, I guess. That's the best way I can kind of explain it."
"She had come to take Ron home, but when she saw that he was alright, she invited herself over as well."
Ginny remained silent for a long time that Harry felt concerned. He took her hand and waited patiently.
Harry sighed. It was going to be a long day if he was punctuating every thought with a memory of the blond prat while trying to keep his attention on his fiancée.
Kingsley gave Harry a long piercing gaze. There was a palpable tension in his expression, and Harry imagined that he was probably weighing the pros and cons, as well as the possible consequences for himself, Harry, the Ministry and the entire wizarding community. It was at times like this that he could see why the former Auror was perfectly suited to be the Minister. Harry also knew that his shocking request would be seriously considered by the man and not just taken lightly.
"-if that's what you think about our friendship, then fuck if I've been fooling myself by believing we had something, and I really thought we did and it just fucking annoys the hell out of me how you just can't comprehend that I value whatever the hell we've got going on and it seems like you don't see it the same way-"
"I'm sorry, Mother," he apologized, now realizing how foolish he must have sounded. "Where is Astoria? Has something happened to her?"
Harry chuckled. "You're going to have to help me put your cousin to bed first. Then we'll have that talk."
Draco had tried to keep his mouth closed, like a proper Malfoy should. But his jaw had dropped, and it didn't even matter to him that he was in front of the fucking Minister. He was allowed to be in shock!
It took Harry and Ginny another couple months to settle into their new routine as a long distance couple (Ginny always stayed over on weekends but had to remain with the team for the rest of the week, due to the intense training regimen).
"Bedroom?" Ginny asked breathily, once again making Harry wonder if she could read his mind. She'd only said one word, but her voice was hoarse and throaty, full of heat.
, he thought.
Harry positively beamed at him. "How's it feel to actually be the one to name your first born?"
Malfoy laughed. "I think most everyone did. The wizarding folk do not adapt so well or so quickly with any type of change, and apparently you and Weasley just turned everything upside down in the Auror Corps."
"I was more of a father to Scorpius that you have ever been! Or ever will be!" Draco's cries took on a desperate tone. "I
Draco couldn't help it. There was something about Potter's beaming smile that made his own lip quirk up in response. "Yes," he whispered, "you did."
Astoria quickly shook her head. "No, no, darling, that won't be necessary," she said in a rush, causing Draco to raise an eyebrow in curiosity. "I don't want you worrying so much about me, Draco." she insisted.
Of course, he knew the possible repercussions of a successful blood ward because Harry had once told him about the one Dumbledore had invoked so many years ago. If Voldemort couldn't harm Harry back then because of the family blood ward, then Scorpius would be shielded from their as yet unknown enemy.
Draco was speechless, though amused. His drunken head conjured an image of Potter breaking down walls like a crazed Muggle, which made him giggle. That alone told him that he had had a lot to drink already.
, his inner voice supplied bitingly.
"No, he needs the best of the best," Draco agreed, moving to embrace Astoria. She allowed it for a few seconds, melting into his arms, then she stood up and went towards their wing.
"Force of habit," she said. "I'm used to being up at the crack of dawn, remember?"
"D'you reckon... d'you reckon we're ready now?"
"Har-"
"It's-"
Ron gulped some more before talking again. "She said- she said we weren't ready, that she wasn't ready at all, and that she had this whole future planned out and stuff..."
It was almost midnight, Harry was sure. "Unfortunately, yes, we do," he said, groaning. "Remind me again why we let all these people into our home at all?"
"Is he alright? Is Ginevra...?" Draco asked concernedly. Surely she wasn't due for another month or two?
When Draco heard the doorknob click into place, he turned stiffly towards his remaining companion. The Auror was looking at him oddly, as if wondering what else they had to talk about.
"I hardly think I would be one to resort to drowning my sorrows in alcohol."
"Maybe, I don't know. It's too early to tell," he admitted. "It's not really something I'm prioritizing at the moment."
Apparently, being touted as heroes had perks, and since Harry had an Order of Merlin, First Class, and Ron and Hermione had Second Class, they were presented with the privilege of furthering their career immediately. It meant that they could bypass the necessary requirements such as N.E.W.T.s and years of experience. The trio, of course, could sense the underhanded attempt of the Ministry to keep them under its influence, as well as bolstering its own popularity with the association.
: (laughs) We would've been lost without Hermione telling us what to do all these years.
Harry pulled him closer so he could tickle him. Teddy let out squeal after squeal, and Harry was thankful that Teddy was still young enough to enjoy those.
"I don't want you to feel like you need to be around me all the time as an obligation. I'll be perfectly fine on my own," she assured him, before laying back down and closing her eyes.
just take it for what it is. I care about you and want to help you. It's not because of some stupid concept of debt or anything. I just… want to protect you."
"Oh well, that's what our weird friendship is for," Harry said with a grin.
"Gin?" he asked softly, edging closer until he was by her side in front of the hearth. "What's up?"
Harry understood exactly how that felt. Every additional second it took was a delay in finding Draco. He knew he had to wait for the accurate coordinates. But that didn't mean he had to like it. Why did it have to take so bloody long?!
" He narrowed his eyes. "And he wouldn't ever endanger his own family. That's why I know this is different. Someone out there was able to bypass my security system and I want to make sure my family will be safe from... whoever this is."
"If you're sure," he said uncertainly, before giving her one more kiss on the cheek. "Just promise you'll use the charm on our wedding bands if you need me at a moment's notice, alright?"
Harry stood and turned to face her, before gently embracing her and kissing her deeply. "I'm scared too, Gin," he said. "and I'm a fucking Auror. But, I think of this as something that will change our lives for the better. I mean, sure, we'll have to make some sacrifices, and it'll definitely derail us for a while. But c'mon, you're already pro, the team loves you, your fans adore you, and I'm pretty fucking confident that you'll be back on the pitch, right as rain, as soon as you pop out our kid."
"Neither did I," Harry answered, though quietly as if only to himself. He wondered the same thing in his head. What had prompted Malfoy to talk to him via Floo, on a whim? He hadn't exactly given a reason, but it had made sense to Harry at the moment. He didn't question why Malfoy needed him, but it did feel right. He himself was having a pretty shit day, but all of it had gone out the window when he found that he had to comfort the blond git somehow.
"Weasley? Potter?"
They had been in the middle of a Quidditch discussion when the Floo suddenly flared to life, its color indicating an incoming visit. Malfoy was merely surprised, but Harry was confused. He hadn't been expecting anyone to drop by tonight. Unless-
"We did figure out that there really is something blocking the magic around Scorpius, using his blood as some sort of focus. Narcissa and I are sorting through books."
Harry was immediately concerned, if he were to judge by the vacant stare and the restlessness of her hands.
"Say mine, then," Malfoy demanded.
"Relax!" Harry laughed. "I appreciate that you opened up like that, though."
Groaning in exasperation, Harry finally shoved Draco into the hearth. "Just go already!"
"Malfoy has changed," was all that Harry could say, since he felt something in his throat catch after hearing Ginny's words. He swallowed and cleared his throat, before finally having a go at all the flaws he saw in her sudden outburst. "Malfoy's changed, and he went against all our expectations. You, on the other hand, were as predictable as ever, and despite your surprise arrival, we all expected you to be home late, and we decided that there was nothing wrong with having a perfectly normal family day.
She was beautiful in an offhanded way, as if she woke up not knowing how she looked and just went about her day not caring about it. She looked familiar, but he couldn't place her features. She had a graceful and lithe form, which was why she had been able to smoothly pick up Draco's books and deposit them in a fluid motion.
Ginny looked imploringly at the woman discreetly casting her diagnostic spells. "How do you think it happened?" she asked.
: In the future-
Like last time, the walk into the birthing area seemed like a hazy dream, Harry's eyes trained only on fiery red hair. When he approached the bedside and saw her smiling radiantly, his heart felt like it had been released into the sky. He shifted James in his arms.
At last, the frizzy brunette blew out a breath and wrote something down on her notes. "Just two more tests," she said softly. She turned nervous eyes at Narcissa, and Draco understood immediately that she was hoping the older woman wouldn't mind.
Of course, everybody was fretting. Hermione had been perfectly healthy just yesterday, up until she had suddenly passed out earlier that day, and in the middle of a conversation with Ron. Of course they'd all panicked. They couldn't think of a reason for her to have lost consciousness without warning.
This felt too surreal for Harry. "At this point in time, you're supposed to try the Cruciatus, and I'm supposed to accidentally almost-kill you." The fact had been repeated so much that Harry was used to the order of things, even in his sleep, apparently.
Hermione, who obviously trusted in this system, nodded reassuringly at all of them.
Was it a good thing that his wingman was a boisterous eight year old Metamorphmagus? Probably not, but Harry couldn't care less. Because it was Reading Time and both of them looked forward to it, as they always did.
and you never knew a thing about what really happened. Never even
It was to their immense surprise, therefore, when a nervous-looking mediwitch came in to announce the arrival of several visitors.
"Draco, if three of you can't find anything new -"
"Leave it," Harry said firmly. "I needed the break anyway."
, as well as a nappy change in Harry's case, the rest of the marathon had to be postponed just so they could catch some sleep.
He only had to sit for a few more minutes before the telltale flashing of his Floo indicated the arrival of his regular visitors.
"This'll spread around like Fiendfyre, you know that right?" she eyed him skeptically.
"Yeah, but see? That's the crux of our problem, Mione."
"What sort of complaints?" Draco inquired brusquely as if ignoring his bruised ego casually.
Draco didn't miss the teasing tone, which he oddly appreciated. "At least it's not as dreadfully common and plebeian as yours," he said with an upturned lip. "But I'm sure my sophisticated tongue will eventually get used to pronouncing your first name. But for now, I'll stick with Potter."
"So you really
(See the end of the chapter for
"I hate to say it, but what Malfoy said makes a hell of a lot of sense, considering everything that's happened. Based on the rumors so far, I mean."
"You did ask!" Draco said defensively. "I didn't mean to -"
'," he muttered. "That doesn't make much sense if they mean your mother or Astoria..."
It had been the Weasel's idea to go someplace else, and neither Draco nor Potter had any objection, given their current state. In no time at all, they had all Floo'd to Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, which was supposedly Potter's home (they admitted that Apparating in their mental state would have been disastrous and irresponsible).
Draco moved back and straightened his posture. "As for your suggestion, it's your lucky day, since I've an appointment at the Ministry with a couple of Aurors later today."
"Yeah, I wanna take care of him. That's what big brothers do."
"Harryyyyyy, can I come with you an' Jamie?"
Harry thought about that. It was true. He and Malfoy had had almost the same circumstances thrown to them by a cruel twist of fate. They had both been instrumental pawns in the war, and they had the same losses and sacrifices. They had suffered different situations, but in essence they had lived almost the same life. Like two sides of the same coin.
"I bet you aren't even listening anymore, are you?" a sarcastic voice whined, bringing Harry's attention back to the prat in front of him. "Dear Merlin, Potter, I thought caffeine was supposed to make your senses sharper."
Ron looked at his discovery. "Wow. Malfoy. Not a bad mind. But… I dunno, not what I expected."
"This big secret of yours is a big deal, isn't it?" Malfoy said, more of a statement than a question. "I apologize, I sounded like a spoilt brat. I know it isn't any of my business at all."
"Nah, Helen told her she's too magically unstable to go through any means of magical transportation regularly. And she can fly, but she can't be expected to fly cross country every day. So, she'll stay in Montreal for the remaining weeks then come back and stay full time training in the Harpies stadium." When Ron raised an eyebrow, Harry just shrugged. "What?" he asked, "It'll be like when we were still just dating and she would come over once or twice a month just to hang out with me."
Hermione went into her 'thoughtful' mode. "Hmmm, well I have read about a few masters who were really guarded about their own discoveries that they would use nicknames or abbreviations, or even obscure references. You're right though, using an actual code isn't practical even for the most secretive potioneer, because of the increased margin of error if even one letter were misinterpreted. I'm guessing that just the right amount of obscurity, like maybe using names from another language, would be enough to at least discourage even the nosiest of people."
"It's our turn, Mother," Draco whispered softly to the wispy woman next to him. Narcissa Malfoy still looked as regal as her Black blood would allow, but no one could miss the uncharacteristic weakness that had seemed to plague her recently.   Truth be told, she looked quite forlorn, and some people even forgot for a second that she had been the wife and mother of Death Eaters. They always remembered this fact when their eyes fell back on Draco. He would always be judged by that.
"Viridian, it is then."
"Yes, we have, Narcissa, and we have agreed that it is not yet time for us to have a child."
She nodded sleepily and gave him a tentative smile. She shook her ring finger exaggeratedly. "Yes, yes, I'll activate it in case of an emergency. Happy now?"
"Are you taking about getting married again?" Ginny asked shyly. "Because-"
The slightly sparring tone seemed to have encouraged the blond more, since he actually smiled. "Good to know," Malfoy said before turning on his heel and walking towards the door. Right before he stepped out, he turned back to Harry.
Harry turned and met her gaze, head on. "Will you marry me, Ginny?"
He also, most definitely, hadn't realized how much better he now felt with the new company he had by his side.
Harry's tone of voice took on an abrupt change, which caught Ron's attention. "What?"
Again, neither of them spoke.
"That's right," he nodded. "You know the funny thing? We were totally fine by it. To be honest, I'm not sure if I should be happy that it didn't blow up, or just pathetic because neither of us even wanted to fight for our relationship anymore."
When the wizard stepped into his sitting room, Draco immediately sent him a glass of amber liquid.
Being here, now, in his element, he knew he was right where he was meant to be, and he hoped that his parents were proud of him.
"Potter!" the blond exclaimed breathlessly. "I-I-" He moved closer, full of awe, and reached out to touch one of the tiny little hands, which enthusiastically grabbed at him and playfully tugged. The child's ringing laughter echoed around the hallway.
Finally reminding himself that it was not something to lose sleep over, given all his other serious problems, Harry finally allowed himself to drift off. His dreams that night were a blurry mix of baby James and Malfoy, and of the two of them playing together in the park, but all of that was forgotten by the time Harry awoke the next morning.
Thank Merlin it was a Saturday. Draco usually slept in after late Friday nights, so Astoria wouldn't make a big deal out of his coming home the next morning. Given his state last night, it was much better that they had all ended up at Potter's - Harry's!!! - place.
"I don't think house elves are meant to understand rhetoric questions or sarcasm," a voice drawled from the doorway. "Dilly, thank you for telling me he was awake. Please prepare the usual breakfast in the smaller dining room for the both of us." The house elf nodded, bowed, and popped away, leaving the two men to stare at each other.
"Yeah, but why do we have to work harder at this than everyone else?" he said, finally voicing out one of his greater sources of doubt. "I can't help but think that this life isn't really the one you want. That I'm not the one you thought you wanted..."
Harry felt elated as he sat back in comfort, looking around at the bright faces of his best friends, listening quietly to Ginny and Hermione nagging Malfoy about more baby stuff while Ron shook his head in sympathy.
"Are you reneging your marriage to Father?' he asked quietly. Narcissa nodded. Draco took a deep breath, taking a while before letting it out again.
"Soon, you'll be changing much more just like your Mum," Harry said encouragingly. "So, now that we've properly received our surprise guest into our home, why don't we invite him to join our story time, eh?"
"Is there anything I can help you with?" he offered sincerely. Hermione looked at him as if laying eyes on him for the first time. "What?" he said, "I'm going to be a father, Potter agrees that I may as well collect as much experience as I can."
"Oh Merlin!" Ron lamented. "Just the irony of it will drive mum and dad mental! '
This mindset explained why the Auror seemed to greet Draco's sudden Floo call to his office with a grim set to his expression.
"I have no idea what I'm doing here," Draco grumbled to himself. Unfortunately, Potter had heard him.
Draco kept his mind clear after that.
"Thank you for telling us, darling," he said softly, whispering in her ear. "I'll get right on it and tell the MMI. You should go and rest. We can spend time with Scorpius later, perhaps that will help to think of other, happier things in the meantime."
Harry closed his eyes and shook his head in a valiant effort to clear it. "Draco and Astoria didn't have a rush wedding," he said thoughtfully. "A case of forced or blackmailed marriage is usually indicated by a lack of any decent prep time - the perpetrator is likely to arrange a quick bonding so their victim can't get away. Magical bindings are pretty much Unbreakable."
"Scorp?!" Malfoy cried out in horror. "You've met my son once and you've already given him a horrible nickname!"
Harry let out a nervous breath. "And Draco?" he asked worriedly. "I've got this weird feeling in my gut. Can't explain, but it just feels like something's terribly wrong."
"I thought so, too," Malfoy nodded frantically.
"Sorry, but duty calls," she said. "I'll call you when I have more time again, I've got the feeling that you'll need my help just to keep your head straight throughout this thing-"
That shade of viridian never did leave his mind's eye. His near-perfect memory catalogued that rare flash of emerald, the pure driving force behind the power of the Boy Who Lived, and he could never, ever forget it.
: Basically, we focus on the more on the psychological side of crime-"
"Look at us," Draco suddenly said. "Chosen One and Death Eater Spawn, baking cakes and exchanging baby stories." He used a finger to poke James repeatedly, causing the boy to giggle and squeal out 'Day-co staaaaahp'.
Astoria's owl perched itself on the edge of Draco's desk, holding out the crisp envelope still attached to its leg. Draco stood unmoving, slightly apprehensive at the possible contents of the letter. Of course, he had been confident that his actions would capture Astoria's attention favorably, but he could not help but feel vulnerable due to the bit of insecurity he had developed from failing both his father and the Dark Lord. At the last moment, he finally steeled his resolve, took the letter and scanned it quickly, his smile growing wider as he read.
Ginny nodded, using her hand to wipe at her face, but Harry steadied her with his arms so she had to look in his eyes.
"-we can't just base this on Draco's theory-"
Kingsley cleared his throat to pull the audience back from their guilty thoughts. "Harry Potter has been deemed as a Hero of the Wizarding World, and awarded with the Order of Merlin, First Class. He is a hero in every sense of the word, as well as in our history books, and his name has been marked with distinction equal to the greatest heroes of the Wizarding World. He is, therefore, within his right to invoke
"Look at it!" Harry ordered, staring intently at the mind map in front of them. "Can you see it?"
"Are they here yet?" Ginny walked in from the kitchen holding a sleeping Albus. "Oh, hi, Draco!" she greeted warmly, moving closer to give him a peck on the cheek. "And you've brought Scorpius again! Perfect! The others will be here today, too, so be prepared for a full house."
Silence had never been so deafening, thought Draco. So much white noise reverberated in his head from his attacker's words.
Malfoy smirked. "Proper mates," he repeated with a bit of a laugh. "My father'd kill me if he knew."
"Yeah, but I would. So c'mon already!" Harry took his training bag and stashed it in his locker. "I'll wait for you outside."
Kingsley smiled, a warm and genuine one that broke Draco's lapse in judgment, and he finally closed his mouth. "Is this really - I mean - really?!" he asked inarticulately.
"He's still asleep," he said. "But he'll be joining us soon. Though Teddy usually wakes up first, around eight."
"Alright. I'm glad you've at least made some sense of that mess."
"Redirecting your call to Number Twelve Grimmauld Place."
"You're sure it's alright?" Draco managed to ask weakly. "It's just, after everything that's happened…"
Harry sighed dramatically. "Ah, you purebloods and your rigid ideas…"
"What?" Draco asked.
Astoria rose gracefully and brushed off imaginary specks of dust from her elegant dress robes. "In that case, I shall be off. I do need to be there hours before in order to welcome the delegates. Time difference does change things up a lot."
Harry agreed with Ron's ramblings, brows scrunched together in thought. "How, indeed?"
"I'm worried as fuck, Harry," he replied, voice shaking. "It isn't like her. She's always been up and about, you know, always this ball of energy. I mean, sure she had a hard time with Hugo last year, but she'd recovered quickly."
Weasley turned red and gaped like a fish, while Hermione gave an audible gasp of horror.
Ginny stared at him, and he knew the unspoken topic.
Harry quirked up an eyebrow in curiosity. "How do Slytherins ever survive through the concept of friendship with the way you lot handle things? It's like all of you are straight laced and just... aloof. Like, no hugs and kisses, no friendly banter, just always watching out for yourself, even from your so-called friends..."
Harry shook his head. "No, and I'm not sure if I want him to find out.. but I don't know how to deal with this situation right now."
"But we've already gone through all the material that Narcissa brought out from both the Malfoy and Black collections, and still nothing new!" Astoria cried, looking forlorn. "It will take us forever and result in close to nothing…"
After all, it had only been two months since he, Potter and Weasley had finally cracked the Pince case, and yet it seemed that Draco's life had already taken an irrevocable change of course because of it.
, Harry thought fondly,
"B-b-but-" Draco's mind floundered. He was overwhelmed with the sudden proposition. Merlin, he had spent an inordinately large amount of time learning about the bindings from front to back. And he knew how intimate it was to be invited under someone's protection.
Draco was in the uncomfortable position of having been privy to the so-called break down of the great Harry Potter. His old self would have rejoiced in the opportunity and catalogued the memory to sell to the highest bidder, but now... now he just understood that Potter felt like shit and he needed something, anything, anyone to bring him out of his downward spiral.
Teddy appeared to think it over in his head, then nodded enthusiastically. Harry did notice that his godson always loved involving himself in everything concerning James. With a pang, he knew it was because he considered Jamie to be his little brother, and Harry had no problem with that.
Malfoy's eye-roll was clear even amidst the glow of the fire, and so was his snarky tone. "Only you would immediately ask if I were alright. Really got that saving-people-thing that Hermione keeps mentioning, eh?"
"We'll get 'em, Ron," he assured his best friend. "In the meantime, let's hope that Malfoy clears up the rest of the list and finds out what they're for." He didn't say all of his thoughts out loud. How else would Ron have reacted if Harry admitted that he was looking forward to hearing from Malfoy? The man always had new information for the case, and Harry couldn't help but share his enthusiasm at getting to the bottom of the murder case. For the first time, Harry realized that he and Malfoy might have much more in common than just Quidditch and the war. What unnerved him more was his urge to find out.
Narcissa pinched the bridge of her nose and closed her eyes. Draco was sure that she was trying to control her temper.
The blonde's face flashed with obvious surprise at being invited. "Oh, er, thank you, yes I think I'll join you," he said, seating himself next to, but slightly away from Harry. The brunet drained the rest of his drink, waved to the barman for another round, and worried about how to make small talk while they waited. Thankfully, Malfoy seemed much better at handling awkward situations, socialite that he was.
Harry cleared his throat a little awkwardly, which made Draco turn to look at him with curiosity. "What?" the blonde couldn't help but asking.
If there was anything Draco despised most, it was being mocked for his lack of intelligence when he had worked so hard for years to prove that he
"It's her potions," a soft voice whispered from behind him, and Draco turned to his mother, anxiety clear in his stormy eyes.
As Draco signed the three forms, he stole a glance through the fire at Potter, who was partly hidden from Draco's point of view. "No snarky comebacks today, Scarhead?" he asked flippantly.
, just…" Draco watched curiously as Harry tried to think of an explanation, then gave up and just rubbed at his face sleepily before trying again. "I don't really celebrate my birthdays, that's all. The others do, but if I'm by myself I usually forget."
His well-touted patience, however, was wearing thin these days, and he often found himself collapsing into his favorite armchair by the fire nursing a glass of Ogden's Finest. He felt oddly at peace whenever he did so, though he couldn't for the life of him figure out why.
Despite the obvious tear tracks on his face and the likelihood of a splotchy complexion from his bout of sobbing into his hands, Harry felt the corners of his lips turn slightly upwards. Hermione was right, Malfoy's presence was a pretty big distraction, and it was a welcome bit of amusement in the midst of a potential medical crisis.
Malfoy nodded, understanding their silent question. "It's not exactly general information. After all, I'm more of an invisible investor here, and I leave the actual management and operations to others."
Finishing at the bottom, to the surprise of everyone, were NOT the Chudley Cannons, but the Falmouth Falcons, who had lived up to their team's brawling history by losing most of their matches via unprovoked physical attacks. Unfortunately, this warranted an even greater financial loss across the country as it has been a national habit to bet on the Cannons bottoming out for the last forty years or so.
Andromeda, however, had confronted him and said that all the experience he ever needed was to spend time with the boy. And that was that.
The next morning found the two wizards passed out in front of the TV. Having had to cater to two crying babies halfway through
"You remember those days," he said bitterly, looking straight into Harry's eyes. "I was torn between what I thought my Father wanted, and what I thought was right. I was so confused. It was when I found myself alone, without friends, and without my family with me, that I realized I didn't want to dig myself into a deeper grave like - like Father did. You asked how it was when he - when he died. Well, Mother received an owl from the Ministry that he had passed away in his sleep. He just never woke up. I expected to feel angry or furious, or hell, even relieved, you know? But… I looked at Mother and she looked at me and there was just this… this deep sadness for what happened to the great Lucius Malfoy. It's been almost two years, and still… still I ask myself if I still hold the same ideals that he once ingrained into me. I've worked so hard to come out of his shadow, but every day I fear that I might hold myself against the same strict standards he had for me. I know I'm a grown wizard, and a successful one at that. But sometimes… I don't know… I ask myself if what I've done will ever be good enough for him. Even when he's gone."
"Draco! Will you come over here, to where your son actually is?"
All thoughts of the potion formula forgotten, Draco waved away his wards from the library doors and met the pale face of Narcissa. She had obviously come running to him instead of sending an elf, which was also cause for his concern.
"Well, it
It also meant that it was the easy way up, and Harry didn't want that. He wanted to work for it, and he wanted to see how far he could take himself without his Savior persona pulling the strings. He had enough pride in him to want to become an Auror in his own right.
Hermione glanced at him warily, as if she was having a hard time deciding how to explain. "Er, I'm not sure exactly what kind of curse we're dealing with, but this definitely means that something
Harry was now curious. He had never given much thought to the actual customs of the old families, since he didn't much spend time with any who considered themselves 'Pureblood', and the Weasleys could hardly count. All this time, he had assumed that Malfoy's marriage had been much the same as everyone else that he knew.
Draco merely nodded, afraid that his voice might betray his panic if he had spoken his answer. He cleared his throat, then bowed once again to their guests. "If I may," he said as politely as he could while hiding his sneer, "I would like to retire to my suite, as my international Portkey has left me feeling exhausted."
Something inside Harry was stirring, and it made him feel uncomfortable. So what if Draco was going to have a kid? Why did he have to single him out with his letter? He knew that Draco was still outside of the wards around James, so he couldn't know that Harry was actually a father to a one year old. He wondered, therefore, why Draco would think he could understand the need to prioritize family.
"It's not like anyone rally talks about it, though," Harry pointed out, "I mean, Peterson and Roche are technically Pureblood aren’t they? But when they got married, none of this business deal stuff went down."
Letting out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding, Harry once again relaxed onto his chair. A lot had really changed since the war. He felt much better now that he knew he would get the right kind of help he needed to move this case along, even if that help came from Draco Malfoy.
She rushed out, leaving him in her dust. Draco, however, now had a small smile on his face. If anything terrible occurred, at least he could guarantee the safety of his only child.
"-have to check on historical accounts-"
"So, the guy lives in Vienna?"
The first gala that required the Malfoy couple's attendance was surprisingly enjoyable. Astoria had agreed to the idea of bringing along Scorpius in her arms upon arrival, in order to introduce him to the who's who of international wizarding diplomacy. Of course, they had a house elf bring their son home after the initial introductions because dragging him along for the entire night would have been an unnecessary inconvenience for them.
"Would you like to have lunch here?" Harry asked them all. Ron and Hermione nodded enthusiastically, wanting to spend as much time with Ginny again. Harry called to Kreacher, instructing him on what to prepare for their meal. He didn't want to waste time cooking everything himself when he could spend it catching up with Ginny and his best mates. In a wink, they all settled themselves around the fire, now talking more intimately now that Malfoy had gone.
"I know the feeling, Potter," the blond said with a smirk. "If you'll recall, I woke up at your place once before under the same circumstances. Perhaps it's high time that I returned the favor."
"Harry," she whispered, bringing him out of his thoughts. "I was contacted by Ted's remaining family again earlier today." Harry knew that Ted's Muggle family had been in turmoil since they found out about Ted's disappearance, and even worse after the abrupt announcement of his death. They had no inkling of the War, nor did they understand the circumstances of Ted's demise, which meant that Andromeda had to deal with their family issues over the years. Over the last five years, she'd needed to coordinate with the Muggle Liaison Office in order to corroborate the stories that she was inclined to tell the Tonkses. It seemed that she still had a lot to do.
Harry nodded in agreement. "We appreciate your input, ma'am," he said, bowing his head slightly in the way he had observed Draco and Astoria whenever they deferred to the Malfoy matriarch. "We'll put more focus on the limitations of the wards and the... weakness... that you have pointed out."
Malfoy rubbed frustratingly at his eyes, which signaled to Harry just how bothered he was. "No, I haven't had any real enemies in the last few years, let alone anyone who would have the bollocks to threaten me directly."
"Exactly. 'Mione probably has this list of things that she wants to achieve first. It's not that she doesn't want to marry you, mate, I think she's just doesn't want to now."
There was no avoiding the completely besotted look from appearing on Draco Malfoy's face as he privately celebrated his son's increasing verbal prowess. Okay, perhaps he was being slightly biased, but he couldn't help but feel pride that Scorpius was already playing around with his vowels. Pretty soon, he would surely master the most basic of witty, sarcastic jibes just like his father.
Hi, readers!
Arthur gently patted him on the back. "They say that she and the baby are stable for now, they're sure of that, at least."
"No, Draco," Hermione breathed, "it means we've narrowed down the root of it-the reason the magic won't latch onto your son! According to these results, Scorpius' blood doesn't match up with any Black blood at all. If there truly is a hex on him, it's targeting his blood connection to you, which is why his magic isn't working with the Black wards." At Draco's startled expression, she gently took his shaking hand. "We'll find a way to counter it."
This was the moment, Harry knew. This would decide if he would finally,
"So I can still attend training, just not fly, after I come back from Montreal?"
The change in his expression was not lost on Narcissa. The look of absolute joy on her only son’s face had shocked her, because she had never seen him so happy before. And now, she felt her heart break a little, seeing the happiness fade into nonexistence as he walked away.
Their courtship had been a success, and Draco had felt the same stirrings of admiration and affection for his then-fiancée. She reciprocated, and they found that they had very similar outlooks in life, and thus were able to create a satisfying contract for their marriage. He was no blood mania fanatic, and she was not an air-headed bimbo. They were a power couple in every sense, and they knew how to use it to their advantage. Not for nothing was the Malfoy family name reborn with the high respect that it now enjoyed.
The afternoon found Teddy taking a nap and the two wizards settled in front of the television, now watching
"Would you like me to stay with you for your calls?" he asked, wondering if he should also provide his supportive presence in such situations.
"I've waited so long for this," the man muttered audibly to himself, "and you haven't even figured anything out. What a pity. What a
"The train?" Malfoy asked in confusion.
"I'm sorry," she whispered. "I know how it must feel. It's just...I don't mean to be stubborn, I swear. I guess being on the pitch has always been so important to me, and even with this-" she gestured to her almost imperceptible baby bump, "it sounds stupid but I'm kind of scared that I'll never get back on and live my dream."
"Which was why you sent me to France." Draco was beginning to see her logic, but that didn't mean that he agreed with it.
"I can cook a much better curry than that place we went to."
"To be honest," Hermione said suddenly, "I am somewhat curious as to what
Harry gave an angry huff. "Bring up the rest of the team. Be discreet. I want this case solved by the end of the week, or so help me, I will hunt down Howe myself if he harms the Malfoys in any way."
"Why shouldn't he?" Hermione demanded. "We all made sure to look it up and go through every possible consequence. It had no reason to suddenly fail now."
Ambition was important to him. The way he went at it now was very different from his father's teachings, but his way had yielded more favorable results. The family name had almost completely been cleared socially. Draco and Astoria's engagement was publicly praised and anticipated. Narcissa was accepted as Lady Black, and had once again become the respected hostess who threw the best galas. He himself was on the way to an honorable career. He had so many more plans, so much more in his repertoire, and he didn't intend to slow down in the near future. He knew what he wanted, and he was going to take it.
He wasn't too surprised, of course. All pureblood children (or at least those from their circle) had been raised to expect such negotiations. However, he had been hoping for a much better pairing than with someone like Daphne. He cringed when he realized he would even rather marry Pansy, who was like a sister to him, than the girl in front of him. Sure, she was quite beautiful, but Draco didn't feel a single spark of interest, which made him dread what was surely coming next.
"-when I can entertain myself much more effectively in our own home," Draco finished. Scorpius clapped his tiny, chubby hands together. "Besides, how can you expect me to say no this adorable baby?" he quipped with a smile (which he had meant as a smirk, of course, but one glance at Scorpius made the corner of his lips turn up more).
"I'm not so keen on leaving them alone for too long," she said flippantly, but Harry heard an undertone of a growl. "I mean, sure he's changed for the better and all, but he's still a Slytherin, and probably has a lot of hidden motives or something."
With a bounce in his step, Draco took the shortcut to the library, intent on showing his mother the proof of his success.
"Just say it."
"Have you heard from her yet?"
Harry stared at her and bit his lip, trying to find the right words. "Did you read the article?"
Draco couldn't help but laugh. He really did want to watch the rest, and now that Harry mentioned it, he did understand the need to lay back and just forgo the unnecessary fanfare. More often nowadays, he and Astoria tended to disagree about having those extra lavish birthday soirees. If he were being honest, that kind of stuff could be a little exhausting unless you kept it within the immediate family and friends (which Astoria did not, of course.) Silently, he agreed with Harry - it was his birthday, so he could spend it however he wanted, no matter how simple.
Finally, she took a deep breath. "It sounds stupid, but it's only clearer now that this really wasn't the right decision for either of us."
He thought about what Potter had said last night, how he somehow just wanted to tell Draco his secrets. He thought about the ease with which he had related his personal history to Potter. He realized he was within Potter's
That was probably when Harry's feelings became so very complicated.
Draco couldn't help but smirk. "Oh, I'll bet the entire staff couldn't resist waiting hand and foot on their bloody savior, could they?"
has an infinite range when invoked, meaning that the focus of the ancient invocation, meaning you," he paused, pointing at Potter, "is the basis for the wards."
"Healer Lows!" Draco cried, now panicking. "Why ever would he have called you at such a time!"
Draco couldn't help himself. "No arguments there," he added teasingly.
Ron huffed as he took a bunch of crumpled parchment from his desk. "We've tailed him, used a remote searching charm in his flat for suspicious items, checked in with friends and acquaintances… There's no discernible pattern. There's no evidence against him. It's odd."
"Oh shut up," Potter huffed, but Draco knew he was merely embarrassed. And he shouldn't be.
the same thing.)
"That-that was you?!" Malfoy sputtered, his turn to be incredulous. "Ha! I thought those were stupid rumors you spread around."
Not everyone in my story is perfect, and it just so happens that Ginny here has the hardest time dealing with things maturely. I swear, when I write out these kinds of chapters, I really want to slap her hahahha. But she and Harry are trying, aren't they? :D Next chapter opens up to 2006, so stay tuned! Thank you again for all the comments, both positive and negative!
Ginny hadn't expected such an outburst, and stared at him in shock. "But - but we can still -"
"Go ahead, Potter," the mad said noncommittally. "It might be something important for them to need to visit at midnight."
"Sounds brilliant," said Ron, scooting over and making space again for Hermione. "So Mum and Dad are alright with you spending summer on training then?"
"I know," was all Harry could say. "I do still love you, you know. How could I not? You're such an amazing woman, and I know you've done your utmost best to be a great mother to James, too."
: Yes?
Harry had never imagined such a day to come, but there they were, Potty, Weasel and Ferret putting their heads together (though metaphorically for Malfoy, who still could not be seen to be working with them). Malfoy's decision to return only after a fortnight had much to do with the discovery of an old wizard's corpse. Once again, the diagnosis was consistent with the other murders that were piling up under this mysterious potions case, and Kingsley himself had told Harry that most of the Ministry had grown dependent on the skills of his department, that they were awaiting for the day that Harry's team would finally get the arsehole who was causing so much trouble. As if the pressure hadn't been enough yet.
"Er - may we come in?"
"I'm surprised you can joke about it, especially since we've found how… dedicated… this person is proving to be." Harry couldn't avoid lacing his statement with the worry that had been plaguing him since this all started. "I hope Narcissa has at least calmed down. I haven't heard from her since that random Floo call, so I guess that's a good sign."
And for once, Harry didn't give a damn.
: Actually, it's me most of the time. Mum and Dad have been living in France for a bit, you know, helping out my brother and his wife, helping to raise the children. There's two, there's Victoire and Louis.
Flourish & Blotts always held the promise of fresh new Potions manuals for Draco, so he usually went there when he needed a distraction from his thoughts. Having been back for only a couple of months was enough time to give him a headache, and he decided that a quick visit to the book shop was in order.
!' What a memorable moment that family meeting will be!"
The Golden Trio, or so they have been fondly called by the Wizarding world, have been up and about, forging their own paths after their less-than-normal school days. It has been almost four years since the Battle of Hogwarts, and it pleases this reporter to share news of a much brighter and happier nature about our favorite heroes. After being given clearance for a very short interview (which Mr. Potter has been so generous to provide), and armed with the new and improved Quick-Qualifiable-Quotes Quill, the Daily Prophet now brings you a much-awaited glimpse into their highly private lives.
"Nah," he shook his head. "I love me a game of schoolyard Quidditch, fighting for the Cup, but it's not something I'd want to do for a career. I really want to-"
After those tension-filled months, however, it was pretty much just a waiting game till their little boy's birth.
Harry could tell that he, Ron and Malfoy would have wanted to extend their earlier discussion, but having Ginny back after her six weeks away warranted some familial privacy. Even Ron could pick up on such subtleties. They politely led Malfoy to the Floo, Harry handing over the jar of powder he kept nearby.
Of course, Malfoy couldn't be fooled, and Harry braced himself for the onslaught of jeers and taunts.
"You mean because I've spent all my time here in the Manor, keeping myself safe within the wards?" Draco said, rather scathingly. It was an obvious fact, and he wondered why his mother would bring it up when she had just recently insisted that they remain within the safety of the Malfoy estate.
"You think the wards failing are a sign?" she asked suddenly. When Harry shrugged, she looked back down at the carpet and stared at it. She was no longer crying, but her eyes were red. "It makes sense when you look at it from a larger perspective," she mused. "If our... emotional connection isn't even in sync anymore, our relationship must be under tremendous stress. Our magic must be trying to satisfy the engagement bonds and failing miserably because we haven't been satisfying the unspoken rules of old magic..."
Another biscuit flew his way, but when he looked, there was definitely a hint of amusement in the blonde's eyes. Somehow, the absurdity of biscuit-throwing between two grown men was accepted.
came.
I am ever thankful that you go out of your way to remind me that it really is the way it is, with no strings attached and no price to pay."
Hermione gave out a snigger, nudging her husband in the ribs with her elbow. "Well in that case, I reckon I can forgive you," she said teasingly, lips quirked up. "Anything else interesting happen?"
"No, same old Slytherin git," Harry said with a shaky laugh. "So that means he didn't get dosed too recently, right? I mean, theoretically, if whoever had given him the potion had lost their supply since we got the Eilert brothers, it would've caused a severe behavioral change. Total withdrawal."
is supposedly the most powerful privacy ward there is, and its strength shouldn't be limited by either distance, or how thinly it's spread among individuals. The only reason I can think of such an ancient more of magic failing is if the magic itself has gone wrong."
"A special case, you say?" Astoria couldn't hide her surprise upon hearing that Draco had been requested by Potter to help him. She turned away from her reflection in the dresser to look at her husband. His face was serious, somber, and she knew that he was telling her the truth.
"Well," Draco finally said. "I don't usually talk about any of this, you know, but once again you've proven to be the exception."
"I'm honored," Harry grinned. "I shall keep this scandalous and rebellious secret to my grave."
"About you and Astoria," she clarified, though Draco still had no idea what it meant. "I made several conclusions, which was why I was convinced that spending time away from home, with just her and Scorpius, would help."
"What do you mean?" Ron asked, perplexed. "How could this ever be a good thing?!"
"Of course not," Ron answered. "It was a quiet affair, you know, simple. Mione's family were there, too, so there wasn't much of the old tradition. It was sort of just a ceremony for us to finally be husband and wife."
The man simply joined in his laughter. "For now," he agreed. "Not for long, I wager. We never seem to run out of problems to complain about, so it's only a matter of time."
At the tender exchange, which Molly had inadvertently witnessed from the kitchen door, the matriarch had broken into tearful sobs. "Oh, those just won't do!" she lamented, "The baby will need much more than just a cap and socks!"
Molly and Arthur, of course, were already on their way as they had been personally contacted by Harry through the emergency Floo at St. Mungo's, which left Harry just a few minutes to himself, feeling even more nervous as each second ticked by.
He had the ghost of a smile on his lips, and he had to admit that he was feeling much lighter, but that immediately Vanished when he saw the grim look etched on Arthur's face, and the lines of worry around Molly's eyes.
"Good news?" asked Rogers (
"Of course you have a choice, darling," Narcissa cooed. "But I would really rather insist that you go."
"What about you, Gin?" Harry asked sincerely. "Now that I have most of what I want, I really am interested to hear your side."
"Mr. Potter," she began with no preamble.
Potter's face darkened. "I swear, I don't know if I'm supposed to be happy that the Ministry officials now 'believe' in the MMI's mind mapping system, or insulted that they'd think of using it against us with such a blatant disregard for personal privacy."
As soon as she'd gone, Harry ignored the presence of both Ron and Apollo and just banged his head down onto his desk in frustration. "I can't believe we'd been putting all our effort in the wrong direction," he groaned.
Draco thought for a moment. "Would you like me to adjust the temperature within our wing? Would it make you more comfortable?"
"I've just informed the MMI of our latest… development. They're already fixing up a tracking team and hope to apprehend this William Howe from Vienna."
"I will publicly denounce my connection to Lucius. I will revert back to Black. But also, I will take sole responsibility for the estates should you not take up the mantle as the Malfoy Heir.
"So..." Ron cocked his head, deep in thought. "You guys are going through the same motions for this pregnancy? I mean, her going to training during the day and coming back here?"
Ginny looked around from where she was standing. Harry had finally decided on the flat he wanted, after tormenting her, Ron and Hermione with his indecision. It had taken him numerous visits and house calls, until he had owled her with a short note that merely said, 'Found it'. As he had expected, her curiosity had been piqued, so she immediately agreed to meet with him for the rest of the afternoon and see the new house for herself.
"It happens," Apollo shrugged. "At least we can actually trace him as soon as Ella gets those permits. It was a good call, using that experimental tracker."
Draco Malfoy was standing a few meters from them, as if he was wary of approaching. He didn't seem like a hallucination brought on by stress, and the realization made Harry suddenly break out of his haze.
"'Fraternizing with the enemy! Mingling with Mudbloods! A taint upon the Noble House of our Forebears!"
Harry thought that over in his head and smirked. The first thing that came to mind was Malfoy, who, to Harry at least, was the mental epitome of 'Pureblood'. No doubt he was already flaunting his 'assets' and shopping for a wife like Ginny had said. "I'm lucky then," he mused, "it's good that your folks aren't actually considering my assets as a requirement for my courtship."
Malfoy nodded in understanding. He knew that Weasley took his job seriously, especially now that Hermione had been ordered by the Healers to stay at home. Draco wondered if her earlier flash of anxiety had anything to do with that.
"No, Daphne told me that the ladies will only be able to visit again after tomorrow."
When Draco threw a doubtful look at him, he shrugged. "Sure, I used to gag at the idea when he'd mention it. I was really young, what do you expect? But after…" he gulped. "After I dueled with Voldemort… I dunno, I realized that I had to admit to myself… I was scared - I was afraid. I had to fucking die, if you'll recall. That walk into the Forbidden Forest was one of my most fucked up moments in life, and that's saying something."
"Oh, get that wand out of your arse for a second, mate," Weasley said. "We heard your news, we wanted to visit, and we're here. Now can we properly celebrate?" He gave another clap on Draco's back until there was a ghost of a smile on the man's lips.
"Sorry, sorry, I completely forgot all about it. Don't even know how he remembered," Harry said grumpily from behind the pillow.
PS: For all of you who commented that the previous chapters were all perfect and fluffy, you should have known better what that might have meant for future chapters hahaha. :) Enjoy! ~Idishi
"Bloody hell!" he cried. "I didn't realize the time!"
Once again, Harry nodded his agreement, and gave one last squeeze to Ginny's shoulders before stepping away. "I'll see you soon, Ginny," he said. Goodbye seemed too finite to say in this situation, he thought.
It had been an accident of sorts, and he remembered one particular weekend when Ginny had surprised him by coming home and literally seducing him out of his pants. It had been a wild and passionate night, and they had completely overlooked the usual contraceptive charms in lieu of surprise sex.
There was something deep down in his gut, or perhaps his heart, that told him it was the ugly truth.
"And the Malf-"
Ron appeared to think about it, then nodded. "Then we'll eventually have to meet up privately, then." He looked quickly at Harry, knowing that despite all the civility, it was too much to have to ask them to meet up too often in private. "Not often, maybe just enough to discourage other people's suspicions or curiosity."
"In our sixth and seventh year, Father was bordering on madness, and Mother was beginning to fear for our safety. It was around that time when she would tell me that she felt her husband had gone. I didn't understand what she meant back then, of course, but now I do. He had become a shadow of himself, and he was bringing me down with him.
"Oh, Potter," Draco lamented, "only you could invoke such a major ancient magic such as
With that last thought, he settled into his pillow, the smile on his face only fading slightly as he finally slipped into dreams.
Malfoy's owl came soaring into the window, landing on the desk with practiced ease. Harry handed it some owl treats before taking the letter from its leg. Upon reading, he couldn't help but let out a guffaw.
Draco's words echoed in the chamber, cutting off the conversation between his so-called wife and her lover. They both stared at him oddly, and Gerard seemed amused.
To his surprise, the blond let out a snort.
"That’s… not really a picture I want painted in my head," Draco said, face scrunched.
"Congratulations, mate!" he said with a lopsided grin. "Welcome to the club!"
"Yes, I think we've established that," Narcissa drawled.
is the highest level of personal protection that Magic itself can offer. If I can extend to my family and friends, there's no reason I can't include you."
"And anyway," Gerard said teasingly, "he isn't even yours to begin with. So why should you care?"
"Oh, Harry..." Hermione moved to hug him, but he remained stiff in her arms. "We'll deal with all of this together, and once Ginny calls..."          "She'd better," Ron mumbled.
Malfoy shrugged nonchalantly, an action that was now so familiar that Harry found himself somewhat grounded. "Hermione seemed to think you needed my, and I quote,
"Your cousin's going to wake soon," Potter said brightly. "He'll definitely keep you here, so I hope you're open to some breakfast. Since Ron's pretty much useless...how good are
Despite Sirius' endless complaints about the house, Harry felt quite at home within its walls. It had, after all, been the first 'real' home he had that was his own, and despite the ghosts of the war and the darker memories of the Order of the Phoenix, he found that he preferred to link it instead to his godfather, and the fond memories he had of their short but significant time together. It made him feel like her were truly coming home to someone, just being here. Having James with him this time filled him with an odd mixture of joy and sadness, unable to help but imagine that it would be like this if he and Sirius had had a normal life together in this very house.
Harry thought about how it may have sounded too accusing, or too blunt, but this really was something they had to discuss before things became okay again. Also, his temper was a bit short today, what with all the complications in Draco's case as well as the fact that Teddy had begun his early phases of rebellion by refusing to do what the adults told him.
Harry had learned over the last year to cherish this special bonding time he had with his godson. While his own two children were still very young, Teddy provided him the semblance of a human being that he could hold conversations with, and without the black humour, occasional cynicism or sarcasm he had associated with other people. Teddy Lupin was pure and unadulterated, his vibrant childlike perspective more interesting and engaging to Harry than all the boring old farts in the Ministry.
"You know what that means, right?" she asked him, trying to break his sudden silence.
are... dictated by the limitations of the stability and interaction of the magical cores involved..."
Harry snorted. "And weren't you just telling me that it was alright for Ginny to be away?"
"Oh." It was then that Draco remembered another chunk of their surreal conversation last night. "Right."
"Isn't any relationship the same way?" Malfoy asked. "The difference is that in Pureblood traditions, both parties go into the marriage with a clear idea of what to expect. Everything is also clarified in the contract to ensure the happiness of both persons."
It had been silly of him to ask her again, since they were already engaged. Neither had minded the long engagement, but now! With a child on the way, surely the wedding was the right way to go. He felt it in his bones that everything was perfect.
They were sort of a celebrated couple now due to his somewhat successful rehabilitation of the Malfoy name. Little by little, over the last year, he had made sure to put himself in a good light wherever he went. When his apprenticeship in France became known, the wizarding public seemed to respect him more until he was no longer the ex-Death Eater, but a soon-to-be Potions Master. With Astoria in tow, they graced many parties and balls, showing a united front as if to make a statement. Which, of course they were.
For some reason, Harry felt warmer. He adjusted his position and felt the need to change the subject. "So anyway, er… with all the drama, have you been able to keep in contact with your friends?" he asked.
"Well, he did react quite negatively to the DNA test, he's gone and locked himself up in one of his enormous rooms somewhere."
"I saw him murder so many people," Potter continued as he sat back down, not looking at anything in particular. "It didn't matter to him whether they were Muggle, or his enemies, or his followers." Draco stiffened when he felt Potter's gaze on him. "I saw how he treated you. I saw the kind of things he made you do to torture you. I saw what his madness did to your family. I could almost understand how his insanity could have warped your father into the man he became. It was something I had to tell someone. After what you and your mother did to save me during the war... it was the right thing to do."
Draco chose his words carefully. "If you hadn't been relieved of the stress you were exposing yourself to, your magic would have weakened... and stopped supporting Hugo... and yourself."
"Oh." Harry noted there was a sort of disappointment coloring Draco's voice, but he didn't have any idea why he would have imagined that. Draco cleared his throat. "Well… I promised Blaise I'd talk to him once this was all over. He tends to travel a lot for work anyway, so it isn't a big change from our habits. I've been in contact with Pansy once or twice since the threat began, but nothing out of the ordinary there. Less visits, but then that's somewhat of a good thing to be honest. She's patient. She's a Slytherin. She understands."
"Oh, yeah, I forgot," Harry gestured to the intern. "Thanks. You can probably just put them over on the conference table, we'll take care of the rest."
"I happen to think you still need coffee," Draco countered. He didn't explain that it was he who really needed the kick of caffeine to make sure that none of this was a dream.
"It is a big deal," Harry nodded solemnly. "I would die first before giving it out, but-" He looked straight at Malfoy, emerald eyes burning into silver. "I want you to know."
"What's so funny?" Draco asked confusedly.
Upon hearing Draco's words, Narcissa seemed to contemplate many things in her head that Draco felt that he could hear her the machinery working behind her blue eyes.
"It's Harry's birthday! We get cake! We get cake!"
"He's found three more," Harry replied, quietly Summoning the last letter that the blond had sent him. "Here you go. He says he's found the first non-botanical ingredient, but that it's too common and can't be easily tracked down like the first ingredients he gave us."
"No offence, Malfoy, but you're not exactly someone I'd want to see me broken apart in uncontrollable tears."
Weasley nodded in approval, noting it down. "Ernie, you go over to Lucas, he's still got pull within the International Magical Transportation office. Tell him to ask for the list of British wizards or witches who went in and out of France within two weeks before and after the Malfoys were there."
"Those dreams I told you about," Potter said suddenly, getting up from his chair and Summoning a bottle of Firewhiskey. "They were real. They were happening, even as I thought that I was having some sort of nightmare on steroids."
: Well, it was a bit of a shock at first-
Hermione's eyes started filling with tears. "I need to be good enough, Harry," she whispered shakily. "I was never good enough. In the Muggle world, sure, I was the weird nerd with the perfect record. But then at Hogwarts, I became the Muggleborn, the Mudblood… it's like no matter how much I achieve, just being me takes me back a hundred steps behind everyone else."
"Has Astoria been informed?"
"...but?"
Harry could feel just a little bit of pressure in his chest melt away at Ron's words. "So Draco isn't in immediate danger of OD-ing, right? That's a good thing?"
It was one of the reasons Harry wasn't cursing everything in sight yet - every witch and wizard had now made it a habit to second guess the Daily Prophet after the terrible yellow journalism during the War. Harry was grateful that people were at least starting to think for themselves for once.
Harry pretended to look affronted as he turned Ginny, his mouth still full of scrambled eggs as he tried to swallow quickly. "Hey!" he said, "you're supposed to be on my side and not call me crazy!"
"Nothing, really," Harry said, shrugging, taking the used cups and glasses and Banishing them into the kitchen. "He just Firecalled out of the blue and said he'd wanted to talk."
He sighed. He had known Hermione well enough to understand her personal drive, her motivations. But now that it seemed to affect so many people around her, he had no clue how to go about it. Looking back to their Hogwarts days, it became blindingly obvious to Harry just how negative she could become when she pushed herself too hard. How she had once prioritized education over life (he and Ron would never let her forget that! When is being expelled EVER going to be worse than getting killed?!) They way she had suspected Harry's Firebolt and gone about it underhandedly, ruining his and Ron's moods (despite being right about it). How even Dumbledore had admitted (albeit in the afterlife) that he had relied on Hermione's logical pessimism to hold Harry back from the Deathly Hallows, because she was just that predictable. And now she was going way overboard.
require an unnatural amount of patience. "What does she think of this entire thing anyway?"
: And yet you still accepted the position as a Legal Consultant at the Minister's Office, in addition to your current rank within the Legislative Council of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
"I'm not going to kill you," he heard himself say.
Not that he missed Potter, per se. But Draco had only corresponded regularly and intimately with Blaise and Pansy throughout most of his adult life. Adding Potter to the very short list was unexpectedly pleasant. Something about the Chosen One resonated with him, and it was so very easy to fall into unfiltered conversations and casual banter. If he were being truly honest with himself, Draco would admit that he sorely missed the interaction.
