Hermione smiled as she pulled a piece of parchment out of her pocket.  “Don’t worry, Harry.  We’ve got this all figured out.”
“Whoa, wait, back up a moment.  You, Draco Lucius Malfoy, want to take a ride on a muggle bicycle?  Who are you, and what have you done with my husband?!”
Harry hummed, as the warmth of Draco seeped into his skin, and he started getting groggy.  “I guess this means we really have to start the planning, huh?”
~*~*~
“Ha! I knew it!  He smiled as he leaned over and kissed Draco.  “I love them!”
Harry just gave him a smile, saying, “You know, you look really good with a baby in your arms.”
“He was helping with the renovations.  That was it.”
“Do what?” Harry cast for his clothes, putting them on and walking to stand in front of Draco, who was still avoiding looking at Harry.  “Do what, Draco?”
Harry smiled as he stood and gave them both hugs.  “Thanks.”
“Why would I do that?”
“Harry, please—”
“You know, I think you’re right.”  With that, he pulled Draco back in.
“He had to run some errands for his mother, but he should be here any minute.  Okay, so as you remember, this was Sirius’s old room…”
“This is still how you get up to the attic.”  He tapped his wand on the wall, making the door that went up, appear.  “I put up all of the furniture that I didn’t want in it, and Narcissa has been taking pieces.  She is also going to help me get rid of the rest.”
Harry couldn’t keep his hands still, brushing up and down Draco’s torso as he rubbed his covered cock against Draco’s.  Draco grabbed Harry’s hands, pulling them to grip his arse.  Getting the idea, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, hooking his fingers together at the cleft of Draco’s arse.
“I love you.”
“Salazar! You gave me a fright!”  He turned in Harry’s arms.  “What am I doing? What are
They only had to wait a bit longer, as Mr Jewell soon walked out, carrying a small box.  He lifted a black piece of velvet from under the counter, placing a beautiful pendant and chain on it.
“Wonderful! It's a date!” Hermione beamed at them all.
The leant back into each other, lips finally touching in a searing kiss.  Harry’s left arm clutched at Draco’s hip, while his right hand wrapped around the back of Draco’s head, tugging lightly on the blond strands of hair on his nape.  Harry opened his mouth in a moan, letting Draco slide his tongue in.
Harry took a stuttered breath.  He honestly hadn't even considered it, he admitted. He couldn't even imagine replacing Hedwig.  She had truly been his first friend.  She was his rock during the long summers when he was stuck at the Dursley’s. She was his proof that he hadn't just imagined Hogwarts and his friends.  Losing her felt like he had lost a part of himself.  He told his friends as such.
Harry woke with a start, his heart pounding. He paused a moment, blinking at the ceiling, as the bright sunlight poured into his room. He wondered for a brief moment as to what had caused him to startle awake, when…. He sat up quickly as he heard loud banging coming from somewhere in the house.
“You really don’t need to explain anything to me.”  He picked up his glass and finished it in one large swig.  He was definitely going to be getting drunk tonight.
“Nana has told me stories of my daddy and your daddy, and how he could turn into a deer to help my daddy with his change.”
Harry skimmed his hand farther down, lightly scratching Draco’s abs as he continued slowly moving south.  They both knew as soon as Harry touched him, Draco would come, so Harry picked up his pace again, letting his pleasure build up until he was almost there.
Draco, always keen for gifts, leant his head up to look at Harry.  “Really?”
“It doesn’t matter.  All you need to know is that we were, and now we aren’t.  No one else needs to know it ever happened.”
As they reached the atrium level, Draco’s grip on Harry’s hand was causing his fingers to go numb.  Before they stepped out, he pulled his hand up and kissed his knuckles, whispering a quiet, “Everything will be okay.”
“Okay.”  He walked over to the closet in the hallway, pulling on his coat, hat, and gloves, and handed Draco his traveling cloak.
Harry gripped Draco’s hand, swinging it back and forth.
Draco was looking straight at Ron.  “Excuse me?”
After supper, the children were give hot cocoa, and the adults passed around firewhiskey, and they opened presents.
Harry stood up and put the cups in the sink.  As he turned back around, he noticed Malf—
“Thank you, Minerva.  And thank you, Harry, for hosting us all.  I am still so incredibly impressed with what you have done with this house.”  She looked around the room, taking in all of the small details that Harry had added.
“And you’re Draco Malfoy.  I’m glad we know each other’s names.  What’s your point?”
“Merlin, that’s a lot of stuff.”
He paused as he walked back past the bathroom door, contemplating on whether or not to say something to Harry, but then decided against it; he didn’t have time to deal with all that needed to be dealt with at the moment.  So, he just made his way back downstairs to the floo, calling out for the Ministry.
“Only one way to find out, I reckon.”
“All the mischief you’ll cause,” Draco added.
He ripped the paper off, and gasped. “How…?” He looked up at Harry, confused look on his face.
“Yeah!  I’m going to do that wall, as well as those,” pointing to the ones on the left of the room.  “I am hoping to open up the space between this room and the room next to it, in order to make a master suite.  That way, I can have a large walk-in closet, and a bathroom.”  Harry picked up his notebook, and showed it to Draco.  “See?  This is my design.  Take those walls, open it up, put the bath there.  I think it will work, don’t you?”
He was interrupted by Harry pulling him into a deep kiss.
~*~*~*~*~
“Good morning, Master.  Breakfast for you and your young guest are on the warming tray.”
“Shhh!  Not so loud!  But, yes.  His plan is to ask her out after her next game.”
“Want to have some fun with Mother Weasley?”
McGonagall and Harry started walking side by side down the corridor.  “So, renovations are going well?”
“Well, we could have one of those now,” Draco said, picking at the top button of Harry’s cloak.
“Happy Birthday, Harry.”
Harry stiffened at the mention of that day. He knew he would for the rest of time. If he could go back, and know what he knew now…
Harry gave him a wan smile, saying, “Come on, let’s get this finished.  Your mum should be calling us to bring the food up soon.”
. He hadn’t told Ron and Hermione what was going on.  “Er, well…I’ll tell you when we meet Ron for lunch, okay?  It’ll be easier for me to tell you both at the same time.”  Receiving a curious look from Hermione, Harry was quick to add, “It’s nothing bad, I promise.  It’s just…lengthy and confusing.”
Harry smiled as Kingsley stepped back, hand still shaking his.  “Thank you.  Yeah, we’re both very excited.”  He ran his hand through his hair, eyes going soft as he thought of Draco.
Molly returned the smile, patting Harry on the cheek.  “I’ll just head down to the kitchen, then.”
With the thought of Draco, he thought back to their day together as he turned on the water.  Stepping into the shower, he moaned as the hot water cascaded down his back and at the thought that he and Draco had had…sex?  He didn’t see any skin, of course, but they both had come, so he figured it counted.
“I checked my list once more,” Draco said quietly.
Harry was lapping at Draco’s left nipple as he started unbuttoning his own shirt.  He glanced up at Draco’s face, but couldn’t really see it, as Draco had pushed his chest towards Harry’s mouth, and had his head pressed back against the door.  A hand had reached up and was carding through Harry’s hair.
By the time they had finished their shopping, it was getting darker and Harry realized how hungry he was becoming.  Feeling another rumble in his stomach, Harry turned to Draco.  “Er, so do you have dinner plans with your mum?  Or would you want to get some take-away and, um, go back to mine?”
“Yes,” he breathed.  “Yes.  I want that, too.  All of it.”
Harry smiled at the angry look on her face.  “Thank you, Bev.”
Thank you for all the reviews and Kudos!  It makes me really happy getting those notifications!  :)
“And that would be a bad thing, why?”  Draco tried to pull Harry back down.
“Thank you for your wonderful hospitality, Harry.  I hope that when you are finished with your renovations, I will be invited back to see your progress.”
“What? I'm not allowed to joke about it?” Harry winked at his friends, which caused Hermione to reach over and smack his leg.
Teddy seemed to sense Harry’s unease because he started whimpering, clutching onto Harry’s shirt.
It had taken him a few times (and a bit of magic) but once he saw how elegant it was, and knowing that he had done it with his own two hands, he decided then and there that he would never wrap a package with magic, again.
“Har—“
Draco walked with Harry over to his desk, where he sat his bag in the chair.
He couldn’t help but wonder what had gotten into Draco, though.  Draco coming in during the middle of the night, Narcissa calling, and then Draco’s bizarre mood swing.  None of it made any sense.
“Keep out of trouble while it’s just you 8
“I still can’t believe that you know how to cook.”
Draco flopped himself onto the couch in the sitting room.  He could hear Harry down in the kitchen, but didn’t have the energy to go down there.
“Unca Hawwy!”
“Hmmm, that does sound good,” Dean said with a chuckle.  Seamus nudged him in the ribs, causing their friends to laugh.
“Beautiful bird, is he not?” asked the shopkeeper, walking up to Harry. “Wicked smart, too.  He’s about 12 weeks old.  Won't get but just a bit bigger.”
Draco just looked at Harry like he had two heads, and rolled his eyes.  “You’re taking this a bit far reached, don’t you think?”
“Draco, please.  Tell me what’s wrong.”
“Huh.  I don’t know.”
They stepped over to a beautiful sleigh, fitted with a blanket that had a warming charm worked into the fibers, and waited for the wizard to magic the animal to pull the sleigh.
“Oh my gods,” Harry said, out of breath and in a state of pure euphoria.
Draco twitched.  “Well… this may have been… you see, I—” He cleared his throat and mumbled, “Noonehaseverhitmyprostatebefore.”
“Oh. Sure. Wouldn’t hurt to get started on it.”
Harry couldn't help the laugh that emitted from his lungs.  “You hardly said anything the whole night! How could you be tired?”
“Draco, do you think if I still hated you, we would be sitting at my kitchen table, talking like this?  Don’t be daft.  No, I don’t hate you.  I don’t think I have for a while now, if I’m being honest.  I also forgive you.  Completely.  Alright?”
It doesn't help that I have written and re-written and re-written AND RE-WRITTEN this chapter too many times to count.  I finally got to a point where I could actually deem it decent enough to post, so I hope you all like it!
They only had eyes for each other until the heard a small cough behind them, and realized they weren’t alone.
As Draco’s pants were finally removed, Harry sat stunned for a moment as he took in the gorgeous cock before him.  If there was still any lingering doubt as to if he was gay, this moment absolutely confirmed it.  Draco was long and thick, with just a sprinkling of pale hair.  It was standing full at attention, bright pink head dripping with pre-come.  The veins were pulsing, and Harry couldn’t wait any longer; he leant in and licked up, from bollocks to the head.  Draco howled, gripping the blanket with white knuckles.
“Just thought we could play catch.”
Draco sat on the edge of the bed, watching Harry pull on his uniform.  Harry clipped his cloak on, turning to look at Draco.
“Well, we assumed sometime in November.  You two had been spending a lot of time together.”
“Oh, you know, just your everyday flipindo.”
Harry smiled as he opened the boxes of ornaments and other decorations.  He gave a wave of his wand and all of the baubles, balls, and trinkets lifted out of the boxes and floated towards the tree.  Draco watched as everything landed perfectly, evenly spaced on the branches.  He could see the colourful wreath ornament that had a bow with the letters H & D on it, which Hermione and Ron had given them two Christmas’s ago.  There were the little brooms that chased after each other around and around the tree.
Receiving a ‘thank you’ Harry nodded to Draco and went back down the stairs to the landing.  He walked into his bedroom, picking up his tea cup and the notebook that had his floorplan on it.  He sat on the floor, and started sketching again, talking quietly to himself.  Coming up with a plan that he could live with, he decided first that he needed to pull up the carpet.  Walking over to a corner, he pulled out his wand and cast a spell that lifted the edge.  Getting it pulled up enough that he could grab it, he started manually rolling it up.
Harry gave him a confused look, causing Draco to smile and pull him back towards the stairs, making him sit. He rolled his eyes and cast an accio, causing a sweater to come flying down the stairs, after Harry shivered as he sat on the stair.
“Yeah.  I was bored one afternoon, and so I was looking up random things, and came across a site that had recipes for drinks.  Some of the names are hilarious!”
He pressed himself closer to Harry, and for the first time in a long time, felt an answering pressure in Harry’s pants.  He sighed in Harry’s mouth, scooting over to straddle him, when they both heard a noise downstairs.
“We had one until we were so rudely interrupted,” Draco said, turning his head to look at the doorway.  His eyes widened when he realized it wasn’t just Ron who was watching them.
Draco gave him a scathing look, taking another deep breath.  If he wasn’t careful, he might become a widower tonight.
He sat up further in his chair.  He quickly thought about flooing to Grimmauld, and asking Harry to join him, but quickly dismissed the idea; Harry hadn’t directly said anything, but Draco liked to think that he had indeed learned a bit about Harry in the past few months, and knew with absolute certainty, that the Manor was still full of horrible memories for Harry.  It was, too, for Draco, but he was trying to erase those by replacing them with new, happier memories with his mother.
Harry pulled back a moment.  He had a rush of hesitation as he thought about the fact that he had yet to go farther than just kissing with a man.  Looking into Draco’s eyes, he saw that they were dilated with lust.  He had never before seen that look on Draco’s face, but thought he had never seen anything so beautiful.  To think that it was for
.  It’s just about you two, nobody else.  So, what’s the hurt in actually making it about you?”
He served them each some spaghetti, and put a piece of bread on each of their plates.
He wasn’t about to tell Draco that he could sense when he stepped into a room, because Harry was sure he would never live it down, so he just said, “Magic,” with a small shrug.
“Mum, please.  I know you have something to say, so just, out with it!”
“Can we decorate the house?”
“The next one pulled me off the bed, and kicked me in the stomach.  The pain was... I guess I blacked out, because I don’t remember anything else until I woke up just a few minutes ago.”  He grimaced as he turned back to Professor McGonagall.
He looked at himself in the mirror, seeing the stress lines lessening with each breath; after being on a secret Auror mission for the past 20 weeks, he was so glad to be home.  He had gotten to Grimmauld late the night before, and even though he had just wanted to fall onto his bed and sleep for a week, he forced himself to send an owl to Draco:
Harry was happy to see the wide smile on George’s face, and as he looked around the table, he thought everyone else was, too.
“Sorry, didn’t mean to disturb.  Just wanted to send this letter,” Harry said, looking around for Orion.
Harry and Draco go to the Burrow to alleviate Molly's fears.
“There were candles and bows, little boxes, and lots of different nuts!”
Draco took it, and after reading it, smiled too.  “Thank you, Ms Baylee, aged 5.”
“I went and spoke to Mr Ollivander about what had happened, and he said that it sounded as if we had created a bond between our wands.  He said that Draco could most likely use mine completely, and I, his.  To be honest, we haven’t tried it, though.”
“Oh, I’m so happy!  I had a feeling it was coming, and had hoped I was right.  Oh, this is just wonderful!”
They all turned to look at Harry.
that was calling for peace?
“Oi!  Have you two kissed and made up, yet?  There’s only twenty minutes until midnight and we need to get to the champagne out of the fidgermarator!”
Draco pulled back after a few moments, resting his head back on Harry’s chest. They lay there for awhile, silently looking out the windows as tiny flecks of snow fell to the ground.
That Thursday, glasses were poured and passed around to everyone.  Ginny and Luna had joined them, too.  Before long, everyone was getting tipsy, and tongues were loosened.  Harry was sitting there, talking with Hannah, when he heard a voice rising above the others.
Draco could hear Harry mumbling curse words behind the closed door as Harry changed out of his pyjamas.  Draco was still sitting on the edge of the bed when Harry came hopping out of the closet, putting his shoes on.
Blaise and Ron walked back up to the table carrying trays of drinks and chips between them.  They placed them in the middle of the table, and there was a flurry of hands grabbing their orders and hollering for someone to pass the vinegar.
“Yes! Yes, please!”
“Is this about Christmas,” Hermione asked.
“I was not expecting that, not that I’m complaining,” Harry said, placing one more chaste kiss on Draco’s lips.
His thrusts grew in speed, and Harry’s insides started getting tighter as he prepared for his release.  Draco reaches between them and took Harry’s cock in his hand, squeezing and twisting it as he pummeled his prostate.
Narcissa was surprised and please to find that she was presented with a knitted lap blanket, in the palest blue Draco had ever seen.  “Something to keep you warm while you read,” Molly said with a small smile.
“Harry, love, we’re already engaged.  You don’t have to propose again.”
“Impressive.” Draco gave him a slight smile, and turned back to his bed.
“And, I’m even more glad that I could call you my boyfriend, if even for just a couple weeks.  When you kissed me back…I felt like I was flying higher than I could ever get on a broom.  I felt as if I had finally found my place in this world.  But, I don’t want to be the only one in this.”
Harry saw Ron and Hermione share a look, but was distracted from inquiring about it when Draco came over, showing Harry his ideas.  Draco discreetly put the pencil back in Harry’s back pocket, brushing his hand across Harry’s arse, before reaching back up and pointing at his design.
Harry didn't know why, but he suddenly felt a deep sense of loss.  What was Draco going to say?  And why did he revert back to calling him Potter?  They had been getting on so well.  Sighing to himself, he turned back around and waited for his friends to catch him up.
Hopefully it won't be another 10 months before I post again, but I'm not making any promises.
Walking down the stairs, he made a mental note to ask Hermione and maybe Ginny if they would accompany him to Diagon soon.
He pulled open the door to the closet, and revealed the extension charm that had been placed on the space, with empty shelves and drawers and cabinets.
Harry nodded to each of the women, saying, “Good morning, Narcissa.  Professor.”  As he sat down, he said, “I’m so sorry for keeping you waiting.  Draco was filling me in.  I’m glad to see Kreacher was able to scrounge up some tea.  I’m in the middle of renovating the kitchen, you see.”
Teddy was still fussing, though, so thinking fast, Harry started walking towards the door.  Draco moved aside as Harry walked past him.  He didn’t say anything to Draco, but as he ascended the stairs, he knew the other man was following.
“Hmm, let’s see…you’re in hospital because your ribs are broken, Madam Pomfrey is just around the corner, it’s already past curfew… Do I need to go on?
Draco called for Kreacher.
“Harry?”
Harry laid down the sniffling Teddy, casting accio on a nappy.  After Teddy was clean, Harry sat him up.  He stood there playing with his Godson, mind still going mental with thoughts of Draco and their conversation.  Glancing down at his watch, Harry decided on something, and said, “Sod it.  We’re going on a little trip, is that okay with you?  Let’s see, what do you need for a few hours at the Burrow?”
“Nothing, nothing.  Don’t know why he cancelled though.  Do you know why?  Have you talked to him lately?”
“Everything okay?”  Hermione asked them as they walked into the house.
“We were hoping you could tell us.  No, don't try to move.  You broke several ribs.  Madam Pomfrey gave you Skele-Gro, but there’s still not a lot that can be done for ribs.”
Stepping into his bedroom, he heard light music coming from the en suite.  He paused a moment to pull off his clothes and send them to the hamper.  He pushed the door open and stepped into the bath.
That caused Harry to pause for just a moment.  “It’s not?  You promise?”
Harry smiled as he thought of Draco complaining to Narcissa about his absence.  “I still don’t understand why you didn’t just stay at mine.”
Prompt:
“Harry?  You’re starting to scare me.”
Draco was nodding and looking around the hallway as Harry finished talking.  “I’ll write her tomorrow.  She has a few pieces, but if nothing, she might be able to help move them on.”
Harry physically flinched as Draco read off the ridiculous titles.
~*~*~*~*~
They both leaned in, eyes gently closing, lips a hair-breadth away from each other, when there was a loud bang on the door.
Harry sat up in the bed, tucking his feet underneath him.  How did he explain his childhood?  His brain was flooded with memories of being locked in his cupboard, water soup being shoved through the door flap, burning his fingers on the pans while cooking.  He shuddered.
“No, I don’t really want the details, but would you rather talk to me or Hermione?”  He stood waiting on Harry to look up at him, and once Harry did with a furious look, Ron said, “It will make things much easier on all of us if you just tell me.”
“Er, I hadn’t really gotten farther than getting the idea to having everyone over.  What do people usually bring?”  He looked over at Hermione for help.
Prompt:
They kissed once again, before Harry pulled back and smiled at him.  “Are you ready for that dessert, now?”
Harry gave Ron a questioning look, asking, “Malfoy?  What's he got to do with anything?”  Harry’s chest tightened a bit as he said the name.
“I may have owl-ordered it from that naughty store in Knockturn Alley.”
Hermione walked up to him and gave him a side hug, looking down at her Headmaster.  “Goodbye, Professor,” she whispered.
Harry smiled softly and nodded.  He stepped up to the fireplace and grabbed a handful of powder.
Kreacher bowed again, popping out of the room.  Harry didn’t have to wait for too long before his owl swooped onto the window sill.
Draco moved back beside Harry.  He again moved a piece of hair off of Harry’s forehead, finding his scar.  He lightly brushed his thumb over it.  They were silent for a few minutes before Draco, looking up into Harry’s eyes, said quietly, “What was your childhood like?”
“Remember?  At the apparition point, just outside of the Hogwarts gates?”
“Professor, where are the reporters?”
He wandered the rest of the house, thinking of the changes he would like to make.  Finally making it back up to his room, he realized that it was nearly 11:00.  He went over to his bedside table, and pulled open the drawer.  Inside laid the wand that he had used to kill Voldemort, wrapped up in a piece of red silk.  Undoing the cloth, he picked up the wand and felt the warmth resonate from it.  If he was honest with himself, he was kind of nervous about giving it back.
Day 5 Prompt:
Draco had the sudden feeling that Harry and he had been thinking the same thing.  He felt a rush of something, as he said, “I believe what Harry is trying to say is, will we have to inform the ministry about our bond?  Will it come into play when we have to testify before the Wizengamot?”
“I love you, my gorgeous husband.”
“Because you’re Harry Potter!”
“Not possible,” Harry said, pecking small kisses on his chest.
He heard a small “hmm” coming from Malfoy, who was still practicing using his wand.  He was throwing around non-verbal spells, too.  Harry felt himself becoming more and more impressed with the blond in front of him.  Coming back to himself, though, he glanced down at his watch and found that no more than 15 minutes had come and gone since Malfoy had arrived.
“So, come one.  Tell me what you are thinking for the kitchen.”
“Name?” the teenaged hostess asked, not even looking up from the book.
“About 33 hours, mate,” Ron responded.  “We knew you needed it, so we just let you be.  Well, Hermione went and checked to make sure you were still breathing a few times,” he lightly laughed.
The creature hopped onto the inside sill and pushed his foot out at Harry.  He had barely gotten the letter off, before it was once again flying off into the distance.
“I honestly think that was the most fun day I have ever had.  He’s been practicing keeping his features static, so he decided he wanted to spend the day as a muggle.  At first I was terrified, but then I realized that we go out so often, I wouldn’t have a problem.  It was keeping your six-year-old godson occupied, that would be the most difficult.”
Draco sighed into Harry’s chest.  “It’s a date.”
“You can cook?  I had no idea.”
“Yes, he was on the wrong side of this whole thing, but he was the same age that we were.  Could you have done all the things that he was forced to do?”
father,” he replied with a growl.
Harry walked through the atrium, smiling, nodding, and waving at various people as he made his way to the lifts.  Once safely inside the cubicle, he sighed and sank back against the wall.  He didn’t know if he would ever get used to being the center of attention.
“I just feel like I’m forgetting something.  Do you have all your potions?  Your journal?  Your—”
Ginny leaned over and kissed Neville, and then stood and said, “Yeah, let’s go!”
He felt the pleasure pooling in his sides, and decided to slow down and make this last a bit longer.
Draco internally cringed.  So, it wasn’t just affecting the adults.
“Harry, don’t even think it,” Ron growled.
Draco gaped at her, but she again just rolled her eyes and said, “Dear, you’ve been staying here nearly every night for about a year.  You just haven’t brought any of your belongings.”
They gathered the gifts that were meant to go to the Burrow, and once everyone was ready, the floo’d over.
“No, sir, those are not the Canary Creams.  Those are Jumping Snakes.  The Creams are on the third shelf.”
Harry gave her his most winning smile.  “My project, Hermione! What else?”
After they had paid, they decided what would be the best plan of action.
There was the plaster hand print that was painted an array of colours, which Teddy had given Harry last year.  Harry watched as they all settled on the tree, taking in everything that meant so much to him.
“So, you said to Weasley that you needed to go furniture shopping?” Draco asked as they crossed the street.
“Draco, while we still have a lot to talk about, especially as to what happened last week, no more apologizing. I forgave you as soon as you actually said you were sorry. Let’s move on, okay?” Receiving a small nod from Draco, Harry smiled, clapped his hands, and said, “Now, presents!”
Narcissa got to Harry first, and pulled him into a bone-crushing hug.  She let go of him after a moment, and he could see Molly giving Draco the same treatment, before they switched places and Harry was pulled into another hug by Molly, who was crying.
Draco leaned out of the kitchen door and yelled up the stairs, “Down here!”
Draco grinned as he leaned over to peck Harry on his lips.  “You know me so well.”
“What now,” he mumbled to himself as he reached for the memo’s she handed him.  Stepping into his office, he was surprised to see Ron sitting on the couch.
What in the world is going through Draco's head?!  We'll find out more next chapter, I promise!
“Yeah.  I had help with the majority of the rest of the house, but I put this room together.”
“Well! That’s new!”
It had taken them the better part of three months of working tirelessly, but by the beginning of October, Harry’s dream home was complete.  And this bathtub was his pride and joy.  When he was younger, he was always made to take showers; quick, cold showers, as Dudley had used all of the hot water with his baths.
“Are we done?”
Draco stood there for a beat, and then said, “Don’t worry.  I’ve got an idea.” Draco gave Harry a wicked smile.
“That would be fun!  I’ve never done it, but it’d be an adventure, don’t you think?”
“You never said, though, what is today?”
Harry stood up, flicking his wrist and wrapping the last two packages.
“Okay, I concede,” Ron sighed.  “You have a point.”
“Wait; Pansy came back?”
Harry moved up onto his knees so it would be easier to talk and continue to let Draco hold his hand.  “It was because of our first day of class, fifth year, actually. She didn't like that I said that Voldemort was back.”  Harry was pleased that he only heard a couple of gasps from his classmates when he said the name.  “She said that was false information, to which I basically exploded with rage, and called her on it.”
Walking into the Charms classroom, Harry chose a seat towards the back of the classroom.  Ron moved to sit next to Harry, but Hermione grabbed his hand and dragged him to sit at the front.  Harry smiled, quietly chuckling and shaking his head.
Waiting for them in the entryway was none other than Kreacher, who bowed to Harry and requested his cloak.  Harry took it off, handing it to the elf, who then took the other four’s, as well.
“No, It’s my turn to talk,” Harry said, standing up.  Draco’s eyes followed Harry as he stepped around the table to stand beside Draco’s chair.  Draco’s stomach clenched as he saw the determination in Harry’s eyes.  He sighed as he nodded for Harry to continue.
“Had many men wake you up from sleep with kisses?  Do I have reason to be jealous?”
Harry decided that he should probably shower and shave.  Soon, he was drying himself off and standing in front of his new clothes.  What should he wear?  Deciding on a pair of form fitting dark jeans, and a deep green jumper, he slid on his new dragon hide shoes and headed for the floo.
When Harry came back down from the attic, dust in his hair and on his jumper, Draco was just stepping out of the floo.
“Bev?”
“Fascinating,” Kingsley said.  “So, the story of you disappearing in a bright, white light is true?”
Draco nodded slightly, still looking at Harry.
Ron and Neville had come in at some point to change, but Harry worked on his paper for about an hour before he decided to go get a drink and have some fun.
Draco just leaned in and kissed his temple before pulling back and sliding back up the bed.  He picked up the journal that Harry had handed him and placed it on the bedside table, before moving over and patting the space beside him.
Harry handed Draco two small boxes, each wrapped in red paper, with green bows.
“Okay, big words now, too?  Who is this new
He slid forward and wrapped his arms tightly around Draco, who clutched tightly to the back of Harry’s shirt.  He sobbed; this was the first time Harry had hugged him in months.
“Shhh. We’ll talk about it later. It’s sleep time.”  Draco slipped off of Harry and down the bed, making Harry do the same, before turning over and reaching for Harry’s arm, wrapping it around Draco’s torso.  “I love you,” he whispered.
Draco’s own muscles had gotten tighter and tighter as Harry told his tale.  He hated hearing about Harry getting hurt, or worse, seeing it happen.  He took a deep breath as Harry relaxed back against him, trying to keep calm and not cry.
“Oh, darling!  Are you alright?”
“It’s nothing.  I’m sorry.”
“Good morning,” Harry said with a small smile.
~*~*~*~*~
Harry and Draco looked at each other and then both wrapped Teddy up in a large hug.
It didn’t take long for them to find the rug that Harry had wanted, along with quite a few accent pieces to put around the room.  Draco did the Confundus charm yet again, shrunk the purchases, and put them in his pocket.
“Where in Merlin’s name did you get that?”  Harry had walked up to him, and gently caressed the ‘nose’ of the reindeer, causing Draco to shudder.
Draco stood, leaning back against the table.  He desperately wanted to touch Harry, but he knew Harry needed to be the one to make the first move towards touching.  He gripped the table as Harry continued.
They turned to see everyone looking at them.  Harry could see Ginny grinning and rolling her eyes, so he knew that it was her that had spoken.  He felt warmth fill him at the thought of her support.
Harry rolled his eyes.  “It’s Harry, if you don't mind.  And I burned my old clothes.”
“He’s tucked in with his Auntie Angie,” Hermione smiled, looking over to where Hugo was indeed tucked into Angelina’s arms, staring up at her chocolate brown eyes in awe.
“You could have stayed at mine.  You know that.”
“What are you on about, now?”
I AM SO SORRY THAT IT'S BEEN SO LONG! RL has been...yeah.  New job, quick promotion, lots more duties with said promotion.  It's been a wild ride!
Pulling back, his aunt placed a palm on his cheek.  “It is an absolute pleasure to finally meet you.  I’m sorry I wasn’t around during your childhood.”
He had married the love of his life, too.  It had taken a lot of atonement, but he had become friends first with Hermione.  Once he started spending more time with her, though, Ron and Harry started being around more and more, and eventually, things just fell into place.
He stood back up and looked at Hermione, who was watching him.  He could tell she was trying to analyze his face, and Harry’s absence, but seemed to think better of it as she suddenly said, “come on,” with a toss of her head.  “Let’s get you a drink.”
Harry waited until everyone had settled back against their seats, and started talking amongst themselves again before he reached for the glass of firewhiskey Ron had gotten him.  He swiped a couple of chips out of Seamus’ basket, and idly flicked his eyes toward the door.
“Good,” Harry smiled.  “Glad we’re on the same page.  So, finish your breakfast, and decide where you want to go.”
“Yeah, I’m happy for them, ecstatic even, but sometimes they just make me sick.”  Harry smiled at Draco, then finished pulling out his book.
“She wrote to me this morning, asking if it would be alright if Nott and Goyle came to the party.”
It was as if a light bulb went off.  Harry’s eyes widened as he rolled the idea around in his head.  “Elope.  Huh.  Why didn’t we think of that?”
Bracing himself for the large crowd that was no-doubt inside the store, Harry followed Hermione inside.  Sure enough, they were assaulted by noise as they walked in.  They walked towards the front desk, where a red-faced Ron was trying to help four people at the same time.
at least every third day.  He had been very relieved when he didn’t see anything about him and Draco in the morning’s paper.  He could only imagine what would have happened if their families had found out about their engagement via the newspaper.
Well, that's it!  Thank you for sticking with me everyday!  This is the first time I've ever done a chapter-a-day fic, and it was rough going a few days there, but in the end, I got it done!
He reached into the box and pulled out something, cupping it in his hands.  “Just after you left, Bill and I were in France for a few days, working at the Palace of Versailles.  They had found several artefacts deep in a tunnel under the palace, and the French Ministry had called in backup.
“A, er, present that I had bought you for our anniversary, and never gave you…?”
“We are out shopping, and thought we’d come here and get some things.  Didn’t expect to see you, though!”  Harry smiled at his best mate.
“So, what are you going to do with all of your old clothes?” Ginny asked as she opened his closet door.
After getting checked in, the made their way towards their suite; Harry had managed to get the same room that they had when they were on their honeymoon.  As soon as they walked in, Draco couldn’t stop smiling.
Harry looked confused.  “Huh?”
Draco perked up at this information; he and Harry had discussed it briefly the night before.
Hermione turned to him and asked, “However did you find this?”
“Um, yeah.  Well, er…”  Harry looked down at the floor.  “Draco Malfoy has helped with most of the house.”
Draco crawled back into the bed, straddling Harry’s hips.  “You know me so well.”
“No comment,” Draco said.
year, Harry had decided to completely remodel Grimmauld.  He wanted it to be liveable, and he wanted it to be something that Sirius would have been pleased with (AKA: Completely redoing the entire house so that only the outside was the same.)  So, that summer, Harry, Ron, George, Draco, and Blaise Zabini had come in and completely gutted the place.  Once every dark object had been successfully cleansed of magic, it was obliterated and banished.
Standing in front of the mirror, he thought about the last few months and how much his life had changed in such a short time.
Teddy giggled again but didn’t say anything as he wrapped his own arms around Harry’s bicep.  Harry turned back, scooting forward some, and wrapped his own arm over Teddy, laying his hand on Draco’s upper arm.
Harry didn’t even finish reading the text, as he was too busy calling Draco.
Stepping into the sitting room, he glanced around and saw that there were only a couple people in the room.  They paid his appearance no mind as they continued to snog, so he stepped quietly out of the room.
“Are you okay?”  He patted Draco down, checking for injuries.  He paused when Draco started to pull up his trouser leg.
“What?”
“You amaze me, you know that?”
“Harry, I—”  Draco felt his insides twist as Harry continued.
“I hope you don’t expect me to wear it!”
“Seriously.  I can’t believe it took them this long,” Seamus said.
“Why?  I thought you wanted dessert.”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat.  “Harry, I would never leave you.”
By the time they reached it, both men were laughing madly.  They passed through the gate, and made their way to the closest apparition point.  Harry extended his arm, and Draco curled his hand around Harry’s bicep.  Turning on the spot, they vanished.
As always, Kudos and Comments give me life!
“Ooooohhhh!”  Draco wailed, causing Harry to lurch, which in turn caused him to rub his own cock against Draco’s.  Harry rubbed the head of Draco’s manhood, collecting the pre-come that had gathered, spreading it along the shaft.  Doing the same to his own, he grasped both of their cocks in his hand, stroking them together.  After several strokes, he pulled his hand from between them and started furiously frotting against Draco.  Arching into each other’s crotch, the two men were getting louder and louder.
Harry looked up from his place on the couch in front of the fireplace, biscuit half-way to his mouth.
“While that sounds incredibly enticing,” Harry said while kissing and licking Draco’s jaw and throat, “I think it’s best we go over there first, because now that I know neither of us have anywhere to go tomorrow, once we start, I’m not planning on leaving the bed for awhile.”
“You were badly injured.  The Aurors need to be told what happened.  I’m afraid you may be questioned.  Both of you.”  She looked at them both.  They nodded their acknowledgement.
“Not possible,” Harry said in between kisses.
Harry angled his hips just right, pummelling Draco’s prostate and tugging on his cock.
Draco looked at him like he was mad, telling him so. “It’s gorgeous! I love our birthstones, and the diamond is perfect!”
“Yeah, sorry.”  He took a deep breath, letting it out slowly.  “The thing is, my childhood, well…I didn’t know it to be any different.”
“Awww!  But I wan—”
Draco watched Harry walk away.  Forgetting his mother was still sitting beside him, he started when she lightly coughed to get his attention.
“All I ask in return is your support when the roles are reversed,” Harry smiled at Ginny.
Draco started attending pub nights with their classmates, and then started spending time with just the ‘golden trio,’ to his astonishment.  This caused him and Harry to get closer, as it seemed everyone was paired up except for them, so it was the next logical step.
Draco sat up, scratching the back of his neck, cheeks growing pink.  “I—I have to tell you something.”
Draco caught her eye and smiled, nodding his head.  He could see the happiness for him in her eyes; she had been worried, too.
“On holiday, my father would freeze the pond behind the Manor, and I would get to skate.  I spent a lot of time on the ice.”
Harry didn’t answer, and tried to move around them, but they followed right behind them, continuing to ask questions and take pictures of them.  They managed to lose them when they walked into the dark and dank store.
Hermione was supposed to be coming over in a few minutes to go shopping, so he forced himself to put the blond and his flagging cock in the back of his mind and went to take a quick shower and get dressed.
This chapter is a little bit longer than the previous ones.  I'm trying, promise!
“Thank you, Bev.”
“Oi! What do these do?”  Ron looked up at his older brother, lifting up one box.
“I asked, what shall we do today?”  He turned slightly on the bench to face Draco more directly.  “Draco,  I like you.  I’m pretty sure you like me.  We’ve been doing… ‘stuff’ for awhile now.  We’ve officially slept together, now, even if it wasn’t exactly the way I had been hoping.”
“’Morning, Professor,” Harry said, as she came up to them.
—sat next to Draco, across from Harry.  She still couldn’t look him in the eye.
“Not that I’m complaining, but are you going to tell me why you’re in my bed?”
Draco Malfoy
“Well, actually…”  Harry paused.
Draco was correct in that he knew that once Andromeda asked Narcissa to go with them, she would break and agree to go.  She tried only briefly to say that Molly wouldn’t need another mouth to feed, when Draco told her that there would still be plenty of leftovers, and it would help alleviate Molly forcing them to take it home, if only by one plate.
“Merlin, that’s gorgeous.”
It startled Harry to suddenly feel a tingling sensation in his pants.  “Show off,” he muttered with a smirk.
“I know, but what am I supposed to do with my time, sit around and knit?”
They tried to apparate away, but there were too many people that were touching them, and they knew someone would be splinched if they attempted it.  They had nothing they could do but to try and run back towards the house, but not before Draco got hit with a stinging hex, and fell into the snow.  Harry helped him up and they staggered up the walkway and through the wards.
“More the merrier,” Ginny exclaimed, moving so that the circle could be widened.
“How many have you had, Finnegan?”
“We don’t need to worry about that right now.”
Draco nodded, and Harry noticed him try and swallow what he knew was a lump in his throat.  Harry wished there was something else he could do for him, but at that moment Mcgonagall ushered them forward toward the security desk.  They each placed their wands on the desk, and waited for the guard to scan them and weigh their wands.  Not much in that system had changed since the end of the war, except that the guard kept looking between Harry and Draco with a look of curiosity, awe, and disgust as he eyes swept back and forth.
“Yes, I did.  But, the waking up thing was much better.”  He paused a moment as the words left his mouth, and then it suddenly hit him why they sounded so familiar.
Harry pretended to mull it over.  “Well, maybe not uncle Ron.  He’s part troll.  I lived with him for several years, I’d know.  Just don’t tell him I said that.”
Teddy’s eyes lit up as he took in the small present that Harry was holding out to him.
“Harry!  What are you doing here?”  Molly, Harry noted, was once again standing in front of the sink.
“Who said anything about a quickie?  I know you want to change into something more comfortable, and I like watching you,” he smirked.  “Besides, I promised you a surprise, and I plan on fulfilling it this evening.”
“I don’t understand.”
Harry sighed.  “Well, can you at least tell me how we are going to get there?  It’s not like we can walk out the front door, looking this this.”  He gestured to himself.  “Reporters have been staked outside for weeks now.”
“Ron!  Wake up!”
He turned to fork up some food, but was caught unawares when Draco gripped his chin and pulled him into a deep kiss.
“What?  You had to have known that.  I’m much too pretty to be going after birds.”  He batted his long lashes at Harry, which made the man blush and laugh.
Thanks, again!
Harry walked down the stairs and into the bathroom.  Taking off his clothes, he realized he was already half hard.  Who knew when the next time he would be able to have a nice, long, languid wank in the shower?  It was always near impossible to find time to himself in the dorm, so he decided to take advantage of the opportunity.  Stepping into the tub, hot water pouring down his front, he grabbed himself, bringing his cock to fullness.  He lent up against the back wall, letting his mind wander.
After about half an hour, everyone had been able to do all four charms, multiple times.  Harry was starting to get bored.  He looked around the room at his classmates, seeing them continue to cast at their feathers.  Neville and Blaise were sitting next to each other, and instead of casting on their feathers, were whispering about something.
“Yeah, well, not anymore.”  Harry scowled to himself.  They sat in silence for a few moments, but then Harry asked, “So, where’s George?  I haven’t seen him in awhile.  How’s he doing?”  Harry added the last question after a quiet pause.
She glanced up at them, giving Teddy a questioning look.  “Oh, is he pestering you, too?  Edward Lupin, I told you no.”
“Of course.  How can I help?”
She flipped around in her seat, aiming her wand at Harry, who instinctively threw his hands up in the air.  She realized what she had done, and immediately tossed her wand onto the desk.
“No, I’m making us
Everyone turned to look at them as Molly unwrapped the frame.  As she took in the photo, her eyes filled with tears.  She looked up at Harry, smiling softly at him, just as a tear fell down her cheek.  She looked back at the frame in her hands, before turning it for the rest of the room to see it.  It was a wizarding photo of Ron, Fred, George, and Ginny from a D.A. meeting.  The four of them were standing in a line, laughing, smiling and waving at the camera.  Harry, Hermione, and Luna were talking in the background, too.  George said something to Fred at the same time Ginny appeared to turn away to say something to the group behind them.  Ron laughed as Fred punched George in the arm and Ginny flipped back around and smacked George on the back of the head, causing everyone to laugh even harder.  The photo loop stopped and started again.
“What’s in it for you, Potter? I already owe you a life debt.  What else could you possibly want from me?”
Draco wiped his face, nodding at Harry said, “Good.  Now, let’s finish our dinner before it gets too cold.”
He stepped through the back door and was assaulted by a jumping Teddy.
Draco smiled at his Godson, before letting a squirming Rosie slide down his leg to the ground.
“She’ll come around.  Neville is brilliant.”
Harry started laughing, pushing Draco as they continued walking towards the front gate.
He wrapped he legs around Harry’s waist, pulling his hips toward him, causing Harry to graze against his prostate.
“Okay, so, for our anniversary, I had considered taking you on holiday, but then we had that big undercover raid in Bristol in May, you couldn’t get away from work during the summer, and then… I got sick.  So, I just hid the travel itinerary, and pushed it off.
Harry hummed as he set the stocking to the side.  He had to adjust his trousers in order to bed down and pick up a couple of bags with little bobs and bits in them.
“Some boyfriend, I’ve got,” he mumbled to himself, as he closed his eyes and carefully turned on his side to try and get some sleep.
“Of course you didn't. It doesn't matter to you. Saint Potter. Anyway, I will be at your house at 11:00 on Friday, and then I'll be on my way.  What is your address?”
“No!  I mean, yes, ah, that would be great.  I think we have all had enough fighting to last us a lifetime.  It would be great if we could all get along.”  He thought about it a couple of seconds, and then said, “Truce, Draco?”  With that, he stuck his hand out to Malfoy.
“Yes, please,” Draco moaned, pressing his lips to Harry’s, and pulling his shirt tails out of his pants.  “I like presents.”  He scratched his nails against Harry’s back, causing him to moan.
Harry nodded, and they disappeared out the door of the sitting room.
“Whichever way you want.”
“Oh, well in that case, speaking of scars: Harry?”
He gave her a look, but did as he was told.  He heard them shuffling off, and wanted to turn around, but he heard another set of footsteps join them, and held his breath.
Harry jogged down the stairs to find Kreacher taking the coats of Blaise, Pansy, and Nott.
They stood in the doorway for a couple minutes, watching him.  Once they knew he was asleep, they stepped back down to the lounge.  “Best send Dromeda an owl letting her know he’s in for the night, so she doesn’t worry.”
“Is he… is he cheating on me?”  The last words came out strangled as Draco, for the first time, really let himself think about such a thing.  Hermione was beside him in an instant though, taking his glass out of his hand and setting it on the ground, before taking his hands.
Stepping through the doors, Harry was greeted by a middle-aged woman with a kindly face that reminded Harry of Molly.
“Good.  So, what do you have planned for today?  Do you have to go to…the healer?”
“Oh, okay.  So, this couch… what else were you thinking?”
All four nodded.
“I’m sure you will find something,” Hermione said.  “So, Harry, what are you going to do with the rest of your day before dinner at the Burrow tonight?”
“Why do you not have trousers on?! Draco. Please, love. In the name of all that is good in this world, put on some clothes and let's go!"
Yay!  Another chapter!  FINALLY!  Don't give up on me, people!  I know, I'm terrible, but I promise I will not abandon this.  It has been months since I've updated, but it's my Birthday week, so I figured I would share in the celebrating by posting a new chapter!
“It is, indeed,” Draco smiled, moving his foot to rub against Harry’s ankle.  They looked at each other and smiled.
“Hmmm.  That sounds lovely.  Or, we can just lay in bed all day.  I’m sure we can find something to do in here.”  He gave Draco a smirk.
Everyone laughed, except for one.
Soon they were walking down a street in Diagon, on their way to a new clothing store Draco had discovered, called Brantly’s Break.
“Thanks, mate.”  Ron nodded at Harry, before looking at Hermione.
“Harry, let me explain, please.”  Draco had stepped into the room, raising his hands into what Harry could instantly see as a begging stance.
“I talked with my mother, and she agreed that her aunt Walburga deserves to be with her family. My mother has portraits at the Manor of her parents and grand-parents, which are her,” he nodded toward the painting, “brother-in-law and mother- and father-in-law.
Harry smiled as he thought about how adamant Molly was about him coming over for dinner for his Birthday.  He had been petrified that the Weasley’s would no longer wish to have him be a part of their family once he and Ginny didn’t get back together, and even more so after he told her why they wouldn’t be, but much to his surprise (and absolute delight) Molly had seemed to be even more insistent on the fact that he was her son, and there was nothing he could do that would ever change that.
“Follow my lead.”
“I noticed them holding hands at my birthday party, but didn’t think much of it.”
Once they had made a list, they went back upstairs to see if the two women were still in the sitting room.  Sure enough, when they peeked their heads in, the two sisters were sitting on the couch.
Draco grinned.  “No promises, but I can try.”
As Nott sat the drinks down, Harry saw Draco nod his head in thanks, and then pretend to take a sip.  He glanced over and noticed how stiff Draco’s shoulders were, and he realised that maybe this really wasn’t how Draco had envisioned the evening going, either.  He watched for several long minutes as Draco talked with Ron and Blaise, completely ignoring Nott.  He saw the rigid line of Draco’s neck and shoulders twitch when he noticed Nott prod a finger into Draco’s knee and lean over to tell him something.  He smiled robotically, answering in short sentences.   Harry automatically found himself leaning farther into Draco’s space, and finally decided he couldn’t let himself not do something about this sudden road block on his hopeful evening.
Draco didn’t realize how close the rink was to Hogwarts.  He had overseen the vendors, so this was the first time he had been to this side of the market.  It was as if the castle had risen out of the depths, shining brightly in the distance.  There were dozens of lamps lit up around the rink, making it looked ethereal.  There was a tent set up next to it that was where the skates were located.  Draco pointed towards it, and the three set off.
He followed the scar with his finger, feeling Draco tense underneath him.  He wondered for a moment how Draco had gotten such a scar, when it suddenly hit him:
“Yeah, Teddy Bear, I can’t decide if I want to leave this here at home, or if I want to take it to work, and make everyone jealous of how awesome it is!”
“That you won’t freak out.”  Draco’s brow creased even more.  “I’m serious.  I’m going to tell you some things that I wish I could obliviate out of my brain.  I need to know that I can trust you with this.”
“Actually, I have some that I’d like to put up as well.  You go get the ones out of the attic, while I go get mine, okay?”
Harry cut him off.  “Let’s not do this, okay?” Harry said, turning so they were facing each other.  “Let’s just pretend this is a normal case.”
“When we woke, and Kreacher came in and said my mother was in the fireplace, I knew right then that there was response from my father.  Of bloody course, as soon as I got downstairs, she handed me the letter and then closed the connection.”
“Come on.  I bet mum’s got dinner ready by now.  I’m starved!”
“When your name came out of the Goblet of Fire, I nearly came unhinged.  How in the hell you managed to get into the tournament was beyond me.”
They walked back upstairs, hand in hand, and put on their boots and heavy coats.  They stepped onto the stoop, and Draco apparated them to the front entrance of the market.
Kreacher mumbled something to himself as Harry and Draco started taking out the packages from their pockets and expanding them.  He took all of the things that belonged in the kitchen and popped away without another word.
Harry chuckled as Draco swiftly swung the blanket back, quickly walking across the room to the en suite.  It wasn’t too long before he was walking back into the room.
He could get used to this, he thought.
His breathing shuddered as the silent crying turned into sobs.  He curled himself up into a ball on the couch, putting a pillow on his face to try and muffle his crying, before succumbing to his mental and physical exhaustion and falling asleep.
“Shhh, love.  Please.”
Thank you to everyone for the Kudos and reviews!  Sorry it took so long to post this chapter; I had the cliche writer's block.  It's here, though, and I will try and get the next one up much quicker.  Promise!  Thanks, again!
He was so glad that Hermione was able to quickly find her parents.  Ron had gone with her; they left towards the end of May to go to Australia to find them.  It apparently hadn’t taken them too long to locate them.
The pair walked in a comfortable silence up the slight hill.  Harry could see the gates just ahead, and see a few people walking inside the grounds.  He couldn’t tell exactly who it was, so he didn’t try and get their attention.
“That’s cause your Uncle Harry is a softy and spoils you rotten,” Draco mumbled as he turned back towards the hob, out of ear shot of Harry, or so he thought.  He jumped and squeaked when Harry shot him a light stinging jinx.
Harry just stood there, hoping that his face did not give him away entirely.  Was Molly saying what he thought she was saying?  No, she couldn’t be.  It wouldn’t matter, anyway, he told himself.  “Er, no.  I’m sure they already have plans.”
Harry could not even dream of understanding all that had gone on in Draco’s life that year.  He recalled crouching under his invisibility cloak, seeing the terror etched on his face as he stood before Dumbledore.  He mentally shook himself as Draco continued.
Harry tugged as he remembered the moans and gasps of ecstasy.  His breath hitched as he touched the tip, wondering again what it would be like for Draco to touch it; lick it.
“He asked me some questions, and when I said that I really wanted to get Hermione something special, he started asking me things about her, and our relationship.  While we were talking, he started drawing, and came up with the most amazing design.  We talked a little bit more, and I used that square thing you made me get from Gringott’s to…”
“Biscuits?  Sausages?  Butter?  The possibilities are endless!  It’s better than whatever this…thing is.”  He pointed towards the muggle toaster that Harry decided to pick up as they were leaving the first store.
“No, no, nothing like that.  I… uh, I had a…  Actually, you know what?  It’s not important.  How was Arithmancy?”
Shaking his head, he stepped back into his room, walking over to his closet.  He knew that not only were he and Harry going to work more in the kitchen, but he figured if they got far enough along, they would go shopping for appliances and accessories.  Taking all of this into consideration, Draco pulled out a pair of dark jeans and a form fitting long-sleeved, grey tee-shirt that he had purchased on one of his and Harry’s traverses into the muggle world.
Harry received the famous Malfoy smirk.  “You apparently think too highly of me if you don't understand how hard I work to not spout off something at Weasley.  He says something that leaves it wide open for an insult or a barb!  I’m trying, for you, you know, to not start a fight.  But, over seven years of the fighting mentality doesn't just go away over-night.”
He sighed as his sight cleared.  He mentally picked out his outfit, before throwing off the comforter and going into the en suite.  He showered quickly, before brushing his teeth and then going to get dressed.
Ron and Hermione shared a quick look, but just nodded and walked up to the sitting room, Harry and Draco following.
The alarm was what woke Harry up next.  Groggily, he turned over.  He didn’t hear much noise in the dorm, so he figured he was the last one up, and everyone else had already gone down to breakfast.
“Is this really necessary?”
Draco smiled against his lips.  “I love you, too.  So much.”
Hermione looked up at Harry, and grabbed his shoulders, turning him to face her.
She patted him on one cheek, and kissed the other, and then went over and did the same to Harry.  Harry kissed her back, shook hands with Arthur as he let go of Draco’s hand, and then they floo’d to Grimmauld.
“I think I’m going to try to sleep.  We’ve got a long day ahead of us before the train arrives.”
“I think I’m not sure I can wait until Wednesday to leave!  That sounds like perfection.”  He leant in again, kissing Harry, who immediately pulled him in for a deeper kiss.
“What?” Harry got a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach from the look on her face and tone of voice.  This was not going to be pleasant, he had a suspicion.
Teddy’s eyes lit up with curiosity, and once they walked up to the edge and he saw what it was, he got a look of determination in his eyes.
Harry leaned against the wall beside the door so he could still look in on Teddy.  Crossing his arms, he said gruffly, “Fine, talk.”
They lay like that for several more minutes, enjoying the silence and comfort of each other.  Finally, when Harry knew he couldn’t lay about any longer, he stood up and pulled Draco into the shower with him, the two cleaning each other and pausing for long bouts of snogging.
“Yes, thank you.”
“Hmmm, definitely.  Let’s go.”
Draco stood at the sink, shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows, hips swaying back and forth as he hummed along to a tune in his head, cleaning Harry’s China dishes.
“What do you think?  We can do it whenever, wherever we want.  We’ll just need someone to do the ceremony, and a couple of witnesses.”
“Harry! Yes! Yes! YES!”
Draco looked up as they walked down into the kitchen.  Harry set Teddy down in a chair, and went to get them something to drink.
“I don’t know.  You just looked…weird.  You were both smiling really big.”
“Harry, you did all of this?”  Katie Bell and Alicia Spinnet were staring around the lounge in awe.
“Piss off,” Harry whispered, receiving a wide grin from his boyfriend.
Draco.  And the party was the perfect opportunity to declare his feelings.  He just had to summon that famous Gryffindor courage, and then figure out when to do it.
It had occurred to him a couple of months before that his feelings for Draco had moved beyond just a ‘friend’ capacity.  He had had an epiphany in the middle of the night that spring, when he awoke from a very erotic dream starring Draco.  It suddenly all clicked in his head.  He
Together, they again read the article.
Years as they moved fully into the room.  “I’m serious.  Draco and I have called a truce.  I hope you all will join in.  Please.  No more fighting.”  He walked over to Zabini and stuck out his hand.  “Truce?”
Grumbling, he turned over and flicked it off.  Laying on his back, he stared at the ceiling and sighed; he had been in the middle of another dream starring Draco.
“Molly?”
“We had one up until 10 seconds ago, mate,” Harry said as Draco and he sat up on the couch.
“Greg was really the only other one that caught me losing control. He found me in the Slytherin fommon room one night. It was the night after the incident with Madam Rosmerta and Bell.”
Harry went and sat back down next to Draco.  They waited a moment, and then Draco said, “Well, don’t dally mother.  It doesn’t look good on you.”
Harry carded his fingers through Draco’s hair as he knelt on the floor.  “Draco?”
Harry looked up at him with a small smile.  “That’s how I feel, too, and I don’t know why, either.  This is ridiculous.”
Draco flushed as Harry gripped his hand and said without hesitation, “Yes.”
“Thank you, Kreacher.  You can just leave it there.”
Draco, having been smart enough to have grabbed the paint palette and picture of the rug, pulled them out and laid them on the seat in between them.  “It would go with your plans, too.  Put some colour accents on it that match the rug, and it will be perfect.  I think you should get this one.”
“Works for me.  We can go over the guest list and details tonight?”  He looked up at Draco.  “Curry for dinner?”
Harry rolled his eyes at Ron, subtly winking at his boyfriend.
Draco snapped out of his reverie.  “Nothing, sorry.  Just admiring how great you are with him.  So, this is my cousin, I suppose?”
“I agree.  I love their marinara sauce.”  He wiped the last bit of sauce on his plate with a chunk of bread, popping it into his mouth.  He copied Draco, wiping his mouth and then placing the napkin on his plate.
“What?”
Harry had gone down into the kitchen to refill platters and drinks.  He had pulled out a few more bottles of wine, and was walking back toward the refrigerator, when he realised he wasn’t alone.  He turned around to see Draco standing in the doorway, looking at him.
Draco?”  He whispered the name, sitting back and looking up at his boyfriend.
“Well, it is a big deal,” Harry said, sliding his foot up Draco’s calf.  Draco smirked up at him.
“Now, as we only have a few minutes to midnight, everyone grab a glass of champagne and follow me!”
Narcissa was the first to speak.  “What was in your pocket that could possibly glow like that?”
“Potter.”  She nodded at him.  “What brings you down to this part of the castle?”
deserve to be in Azkaban because I used Unforgivables?  Is that your bases for being sent there?  I killed a man; he didn’t.  Should I be sent there?  I did everything in my power to make sure that the people I loved and cared for would be okay, just like he did.  Are you honestly telling me that if the roles had been reversed, you wouldn’t have done all of those things if someone told you that if you didn’t, he would kill your mother, and you knew it would happen?  Or your little sisters, Dean?  Can you seriously look me in the eye, and tell me that you wouldn’t do whatever it took to keep them safe?
“You weren’t supposed to be home, yet,” Ron said, rubbing the back of his neck.
Harry cast a quick look over at the clock on his bedside table and found that it was only 7:30.  Harry groaned and turned back over, curling into his pillow, deciding he deserved a couple more hours sleep.
Harry chuckled as he rolled his eyes.  “Is that all I’m good for? My cock, culinary skills, and good looks?”
“Too late,” Harry said, crawling onto the bed and leaning over to kiss Draco.
“Yes.  And, well, the fact that I like the company of
“Fine, fine.  Come over tomorrow for dinner.  Depending on how much we can get done, maybe I'll even cook.”
“No you don’t,” Draco said, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck, and leaning in for a kiss.  “You just don’t like being the person that gets surprised.  But, it’s good for you every once in awhile, love.”
“Mione,” Harry called.  She looked over and her face lit up at the sight of her best friend.  “Give me my godson, and you go follow your husband a daughter, and get some warm clothes on.”  He held his hands out to her.
“Thanks.  It’s been slow, since we’ve only been able to work on the weekends, but the main rooms are finished.  I’m hoping to have a few more rooms done by the time we go back to Hogwarts.  Feel free to look around.  There’s a tree in there,” he said pointing across the hall, “that has all of the presents, if you have any to add.  Molly is down in the kitchen, of course.  I need to go finish wrapping some gifts, so just make yourself at home!”
“That was the plan.  I have an idea of the pieces of furniture I want, too, but I saw a rug in a magazine that I think would be perfect.  Here is the picture.”
Harry smirked, shaking his head. “You’re ridiculous,” he muttered softly.
Walking into Teddy’s room, he pulled multiple things out of his pocket.  The store that they had gone into to look at the appliances was also a furniture store.  Harry decided to go ahead and get a few more pieces for Teddy’s room.  Unshrinking them, he levitated a changing table onto the wall beside the door, and a beautiful dark coloured wooden rocking chair into the corner.
.  It is just…
Both men chocked on the sips of tea they had both just taken.
“Well, are you ready?  I think there is a store about 5 blocks over, and another close by it that might have the rug I was looking at.  Do you mind walking?  I am not sure if there is an apparition point over there.”
Harry sighed, grinning.  “How about we come back tomorrow, eat something a little smaller, go shopping, and maybe ride a ride?”
“You are still going to come to the New Year’s Eve party, aren’t you?  Everyone will be there.”
Narcissa seemed to look between the concerned look on Harry’s face and the furious one on Draco’s face, before she said, “Very well.  I will not say anything more at this time.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it, but now that you mention it, I’m tired, as well.  Think I’m going to take a shower, and then go to bed.”
“Don’t you worry about it, mate.  Those bastards will get what’s comin’ to them, and you’ll be back before dinner, I just know it.”
As he sat there listening to Neville talk about Ginny, Harry something.  Maybe, just maybe, Draco fancied him, too.  He supposed only time would tell.
“However, I believe it is just your wand.  I know you were worried about the Elder Wand, but I don’t believe it is about ‘masters’, so to speak.  You were holding your wand in your wand hand, you say?  Well, I think it is because you were still holding it, that this happened.  A wizard’s magic is inside themself, and the wand is the tool that releases it.  Holding both wands caused a release of your magic into the Hawthorne, sealing the fate that the two of you can exchange impartially.”
It took him a couple of seconds to find the blond hair again, but when he did, he ran after him.  He didn’t want to make a scene, so as he came up closer, he said a quick “Malfoy” to get the man’s attention.
Ron’s cheeks got even redder as he realized what Harry was trying to say.  He just gulped, nodding slowly.
Harry, who was standing on a conjured ladder, fixing patches on the ceiling, looked behind him at Draco.  “Huh?”
He moaned, causing Draco to thrust again as the vibrations caused sparks of pleasure to spread throughout his body.  His breath hitched as he felt his orgasm build up.  Harry pulled off, licking up the vein and taking him back in, sucking him in deep.
the small box from under the tree, he glanced over at Harry, who just smiled wide and winked at his best mate.
“Good morning,” Draco said, rubbing Harry’s cheek again.
Suddenly a very stern voice rang from the top of the stairs.  “Edward Remus Lupin!”
Harry sighed, shaking his head.  He reached for the powder, stepped into the hearth and said “I love you,” before tossing the powder and calling out for the Ministry.
Hermione looked between the two men before her, and said, “I can’t wait to see it.  Well, everything, actually! How about that tour?  We really didn’t get to see much last time, before, you know…” she said with a pursed smile.
Draco moved to sit on his knees.  “I
He was going to go to Diagon Alley that morning to see how it was coming along.  He was hoping that it would be ready by the weekend, so he could pick it up on his way back to Hogwarts.
He closed his eyes, not turning around to look at him.  “Harry, I can’t do this for much longer.  I love you, more than anything in the world, but I…”  He took another deep breath, shaking his head.  “I’ve got to go.”  He stepped out onto the front stoop, twisting away.
He no more got the words out, that the floo flared up in the sitting room.
He thought back to his dream, of Draco’s grey eyes locked on his, his warm mouth kissing him.
Harry came back up with a tray of nibbles and two piping hot mugs of cocoa.
Questions were thrown at them as if they were confetti, but Harry resolutely ignored them all, pulling Draco even closer and pushing through the the doors.
“Draco, I—”
Ron was already there, saving a table for them towards the back.  As soon as Harry and Hermione had sat down, a waitress came over, took their order, and then disappeared.
“I have been your boyfriend for just two weeks.  In that time, I have learned more about myself than I ever thought possible.”
The next few minutes were spent coming up with a statement that Harry could read to the press.  They decided that he would mention a few details of what the trio had been doing the last few months before the end of the war, and also a bit about the Elder wand.
Harry didn't know how he felt about that.  Gryffindor tower was his home.  Not being there for his last year was going to be strange.
Harry stood panting at the foot of the bed, watching the gorgeous blond that lay before him.  With a flick of his wand, both of their clothes were stripped from their bodies, landing gracefully folded onto the chair in the corner of the room.
Before he could really start thinking how he wanted to set things up, Harry heard the floo flare up.  He stepped out into the hall and saw Hermione, Ron, and Ginny step out of the fire.
~*~*~
he thought.
Thank you for reading!
“Goodnight,” Draco sighed, leaning back against his chest.
They all walked through the double doors, and upon hearing noises, went into the Great Hall.  There they saw several more people from their year sitting at a table that was just below the staff tables, sitting horizontal in front of the four house tables.  As Harry walked forwards, he could finally see who all was returning for their final year at Hogwarts.  He saw Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Ernie Macmillan from Hufflepuff; Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, and Millicent Bulstrode from Slytherin; Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan from Gryffindor; and Michael Corner from Ravenclaw.  In total, there were just fifteen people from their class returning to take their N.E.W.T.S.
“Hmmm, yes.”  Draco hummed as Harry gripped his hips, pulling their torsos together.
Once he got to Hogwarts, he was able to take a few baths, but never really got to fully enjoy them.  So, when it came time to remodel his bedroom and en-suite, Harry insisted he have both a shower and a large tub.  He had gone shopping in the wizarding shops, but hadn’t found what he was looking for.  He convinced Ron to go with him to a muggle shop, and that’s where he found paradise.  It was so large that Ron could almost nearly lay down completely in it.  With two people in it, it was big enough that they both could completely stretch out, and only have to share leg space, even as tall as Draco was.
“Really? That’s it?”
They turned up the walk towards the stoop.  Harry unlocked the door, and Ron, Hermione, and Harry stepped inside.  Harry noticed Draco wasn’t behind them and turned around the see Draco still standing on the sidewalk.  Harry went back and stood at Draco’s side.
Ron laughed bitterly.  “No big deal? Mate, this is Malfoy we are talking about.  Once a slimy git, always a slimy git.”
Harry stared at him for a few seconds before shrugging his shoulders and saying with a smile, “Eh, that’s a hell of a lot better than what I’ve been used for, previously.  I mean, I get pleasure out of it, too.”
“Well, I was just thinking that our tour of Grimmauld and dinner plans got a bit side-tracked, last time.  Maybe we could do it tonight?”  She looked over at Ron, who just shrugged and nodded, and then looked over at Harry and Draco.
When he looked back up a second later, however, it was to see a strange look of part anger, part relief, and part understanding all rolled into one on her face.  She lifted her hand by her side, discretely, sending him a small wave and then pointed down with her index finger.
Draco stood there staring at Harry.  “We promised we’d be there, Harry.  You promised, on Sunday.  You told ‘Mione you would be.”
“There’s more,” Ron said with a smirk, nodding back to him.
Harry let his mind wander as he thought about his ‘new and improved’ self.  He was absolutely determined to have a great year at school.  He felt he deserved it after nearly seventeen years of hell; first, life with the Dursley’s and then, life fighting Voldemort.  This was the beginning of the rest of his life, and he was going to enjoy every minute of it.
“Not guilty, Minister.”
“Yes.”
“Well, as normal as ‘The Golden Trio’ can get,” came Ron’s response as he walked up next to Hermione.  “Ugh.  Stupid Prophet and their phrases.  My brothers will never let me live that one down.”
“Okay!”  Teddy jumped up and down, and Harry pulled out a few more strands of lights.  They walked back outside, and Harry showed Teddy how to hang them up.  With the thick snow, it was hard work, but once they were around the building, it was worth it to see the look on Teddy’s face.
“Thank you,” he said as he lightly traced Harry’s lips with his tongue.
“Thanks.  We worked really hard on it.”
“Thank you,” he said as he kissed Harry’s right cheek.
He took a piece of paper out of his pocket as well, quickly looking over the instructions.  Waving his wand and chanting the incantation on the page, he was pleased to see the tree grow back to its normal size, snow and fairy lights included.  He cast another charm over it to make sure the snow didn’t melt.
“Great!” Draco sat down in the chair.  ”So, what did Weasley do?”  Draco asked, pulling his supplies out of his bag, spreading them before him.  Harry started to do the same, but suddenly became distracted by Draco’s hands.
“I also sent your father a letter, telling him what happened,” she added, quietly.
Harry took a moment to collect his thoughts.  Did he really want to tell them
“You better not be eating candy for breakfast, young man,” Andromeda said, as she and Narcissa joined them in the room.
“Sorry, Hagrid.  I was in the library every night trying to get all of my work finished before reviews for exams.  I promise I'll come by Tuesday, at our regular time.” Draco smiled up at the half-giant.
“Ah, the last weekend!”
“She then said something about how it wasn’t just my magic that could have caused it, and I automatically thought about the possible, well, probable, link between our wands.  I decided that you should be a part of the conversation, and so we came here.”
“Yeah.  He doesn’t know it, but I finished all the hard work on the sitting room a few weeks ago.  I just need to paint, which I will do tomorrow, but I’ve also been working on my bedroom.  I have cleared out most of the furniture in all of the rooms, putting it all in the attic, so now I need to go shopping for things.
“Yes, what ever do you mean?” Harry asked in faux innocence.  He too smiled as he glanced over at Nott.
“Oh, Harry! I’m…so…aaaahhh!!”
“Because, our Godchildren are having their birthday party.”
Pulling Draco towards him, again, Harry let out a moan as both of their engorged organs brushed against each other.  Harry didn’t even mind that there were layers of clothing separating them when he began pushing Draco to lean up against the wall that he had been previously working on.
“But, you’re doing it together.”
Harry understood, and they both turned to walk into the house.
“Y-you don't want to marry me?” Draco’s eyes widened.
Draco gasped as Harry nipped the skin just under his ear.  “Okay, yeah, let’s go.”  They stood there for several more minutes snogging, though, until finally Draco pushed Harry back.  “Really, let’s go.”  He walked out of the room, fixing his clothes as he made his way up the stairs towards the floo.  Harry followed behind him, doing the same, and chanting
A few minutes later, Harry and Draco heard noise.  Slowly breaking apart, they saw Kreacher standing behind them.
Stepping up to the shop, Harry took a deep breath and entered.  He was hesitant to talk to the man, because he wasn’t sure if he wanted to know the answers to his questions.  They had both felt something very strange that day.
Harry walked over to the table, pouring the tea out.  Turning to ask how he took his, Malfoy said, “Two sugars,” and then took the cup from Harry, sitting down.  “Thanks, Potter.”
“Grea’! I'll make sure to have it ready fer yeh!”
“Err…”
Draco seemed to flinch as he looked at the ground.  He took a breath, slowly looking up at Harry’s face.  “Can we talk?”
He jumped up, quickly pulling on some clothes.  He ran back into the en suite, brushing his teeth and running a comb through his hair.  He stared at his reflection for a moment, smiling at how well his not shaving for the last four days, since Christmas, was producing a very fine beard.
Walking into the common room, they all veered off into their rooms to pack for the weekend.  Harry was pulling some things out of his wardrobe when he heard a tapping noise.  Looking up, he saw his owl sitting on the sill of the window.
The stag shot off, and Harry started off towards the castle.  Harry didn’t even realize until that moment that it was snowing.  He cast a warming charm over them as he walked up the path.  McGonagall met him at the bottom of the steps.
“Okay, now we can finish eating,” he said with a smirk, and turned back to his food, leaving Harry gobsmacked and just this side of horny.
“You’re not so bad, yourself,” Harry said as he carefully slid himself out of Draco.  They both winced, as they were both sensitive.
“That’s very true.  Come here.”
“Are you sure?  It is your wedding night, after all.”  She raised her eyebrows.
Harry leaned over and kissed Draco. “Damn, you look beautiful.”
Draco sat his chin the back of his hand on Harry’s chest and reached up with his other to caress Harry’s cheek, rubbing his thumb over his dimple.  “Oh, love, I wish you had just told me.  I don’t know what, or how, but I could have done something.”
He had had sex.  With Draco Malfoy.
“What the—”
“Do you want to get lunch now, or get room service again?”
Thanks to all that have been reading since the beginning, and hello to all the new!
Waiting until everyone had gathered in the dusty attic, Harry finally released Draco’s hand in order to stand up on a crate to address the group.
.  I know it’s a lot to take in, but it’s true.”
“You’re still so tight! Don’t—don’t move. Give it a second.”
Teddy sighed as he looked between them both.  “I love you.”
“Mmmm, a cannoli sounds amazing,” Draco said.  “Go take your shower, and get dressed, and we can go.”
Seeing the way his face broke as he said that last sentence, Harry knew he was lying.  “Draco, whatever is going on, we can deal with it.  Together.  I know you.  This isn’t how you really feel.”  He again tried to reach for Draco.
She nodded as she stepped out to her desk, picking up her jumper and cloak.
Harry sighed, vanishing the portkey.  “Alright, what first?”  He looked over at Draco, who sighed too.
Hermione grinned at him as they stepped into the floo, yelling out ‘Leaky Cauldron’ as they swirled away in green flames.
His mother gave him a questioning look, but he just shook his head.  Narcissa reached out, lightly petting Teddy’s cheek.  He reached for her hand, causing Narcissa to smile.
I'm back!  Sorry it's taken me so long!
birthday, when Harry decided to throw him a surprise party.  That night, everything between them changed.
They walked out into the crisp October morning, seeing Hagrid off in the distance checking on his ginormous pumpkins, getting them ready for the feast next week.
he thought.
“What is it, Potter? Come expecting a thank you from me?”  The Malfoy scowl was prominent on his face after he spoke.  Harry had to suppress his eye roll.
“With marshmallows?” Harry asked with a grin.
“What about…um…Draco?”  Hermione cautiously asked.
“Harry?  Oh, mate.  Oh, god.  That was terrible.”  Ron pulled his legs up and rubbed his face.  “I knew coming back to school was going to be difficult, but I didn’t realize how much so.”  He sighed and looked up at Harry.
Thanks again for reading!
Hermione’s smile faded slightly.  “Mum wasn’t feeling well, so they just decided to stay at home.”  She sighed.
“Happy belated, to you, mate!”  Harry grinned as he walked to the head of the table and sat down.
“How do you feel about having so many people in your house?”
“You get set up, and I’ll go make the cocoa and a bite to eat, okay?”
Harry took in the look on Draco’s face, suddenly feeling awe at the beautiful man he was now betrothed to.  Looking to his right, he walked quickly towards Draco and took his hand as he said, “Well, we can start by getting onto the sidewalk before we get hit by a car, and our engagement become irrelevant!”
“Talk.”
Harry snuggled further into the bed, pulling Draco towards him so that his front was wrapped around Draco’s back.  He pressed a kiss under Draco’s ear before he whispered, “Nah, you won’t.”
The trio had barely gotten to the door, though, when the fire flared up.  They all three turned to see who was coming through.
“What are you talking about?”
Ron stepped forward to see it, as did Harry.  What Harry saw made him gasp lightly.
“See you.”
They sat there for several moments, snogging.
“Yeah, but he was a Death Eater.”
Harry, feeling the light touch, got goose pimples down his arm.  Letting out the breath he didn’t realize he was holding, he started walking down the street, Draco falling in step beside him.
“What a coincidence!  So did I!” Ron exclaimed from the top of the stairs.  Teddy giggled as he turned back to Harry, clutching his leg.
When’s Draco’s feet finally fell to the ground, they released their kiss.  Hands still in Harry’s hair, Draco bent and laid his forehead on Harry’s.
There were mumbled greetings around the table, and a few glances between Nott, Draco, and Harry.
“Ron—”
By the time the said their goodbye’s to Kinglsey, kissed Narcissa goodbye as she floo’d out of the Atrium, and they had made their way back up the visitor’s phone booth and apparated to Hogwarts, (all while still avoiding any lingering journalists and cameras, somehow) classes were letting out for the day.  They left McGonagall in the front hall, and made their way to their common room.
Then, barely two years in, Harry popped the question while on a winter holiday in the south of France, against a beautiful backdrop of a wintry garden filled with bushes of red holly berries.  Draco had no qualms about instantly screaming yes.
“I bought that a while back, and thought maybe we’d put that up for Teddy, since he’s so ornery, like his godfather, but then, I thought I’d do something different with it for his godfather.”  He gave Harry a smirk.
because we are friends?”
He didn't get a chance to finish his sentence, though, because his lips were suddenly being smashed against Harry’s.  It took a split second for Draco to realize what was happening, but once he did, Harry felt a jolt of pleasure as the kiss was reciprocated.  Harry’s gloved hands made their way up to cup Draco’s head, whilst Draco’s wrapped themselves around Harry’s waist.  As they continued to kiss, a warmth exploded in both of them, weaving its way up their bodies, and then exploding out of their lips.  They both jumped back as if they had been burned.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry rolled his eyes, pushing his shoulder into Draco’s.  He reached across the table and pulled his plate towards him.  They finished their meal sitting side by side.
Harry sat down another plate, and then seated himself into a chair.  Ron walked around and sat across from him.
After beckoning Orion down out of the rafters, attaching the letter to his foot, and sending him flying, Harry turned back to the three men and said, “Yes?”
“Harry James Potter!  What in the here do you think you’re doing?”
“Let’s just say Tony wasn’t the
here, and we
“I’ll be here, whenever she wants to come over.  But, if she’s not going to come over until after 10, I might just have a   lie-in.”
As they walked towards the apparition point, Harry unclasped his hand from Draco’s and wrapped it around Draco’s back.  He stuck his thumb in the belt loop on Draco’s hip.
They three of them enjoyed their tea, chatting amiably about their classes and being back at Hogwarts.  All mentions of the war and the final battle were nonexistent, which Harry was very glad for.  Finally, Narcissa prepared to leave, telling Draco to come along.
With that, Draco had turned and went into their dorm room.
Harry called for Kreacher, who popped into the room, and upon receiving a request for tea, popped back out.  Harry went up to his bedroom to start figuring out measurements.  He had only been upstairs for around 30 minutes, drawing a floor plan of what he thought would work, when he heard a “Potter!” coming from the floo.
“No! Get off of me!  You’re too heavy!”
“It’s just, we’ve been engaged for not even three weeks, and my mother is making me want to just call it all off!”  He saw the look on Harry’s face, and waved him off.  “No, not really, but I just wish that we could get it into her head that we are going to do it our way.”
“Draco and I had a conversation, and we’ve decided to call a truce.”
“Of course! You've had just as much to do with the renovations as Harry has, from what I've heard,” she said with a smile.  “So, tomorrow at 7?  Great!  See you then!”  And with that, Ron grabbed her hand and twisted away.
Draco walked up to the table, his shadow right behind him, and gave a small wave to the table.  “Evening, everyone.  I’m sure you all remember Theo,” he said.  Theo Nott nodded his head at the table.
“I’ll try my best, but only for the sake of—what was in McGonagall said?  Oh, yeah:
New chapter! FINALLY!
“I don’t know how much more of this I can take.”
Ron looked between them both before saying, “I’m just going to head out! I’ll see you Sunday for lunch?  Great!  Bye!” And walked quickly out the door, not waiting for an answer.
“It took me a few times to get the dragon right, but I just thought of you, and it practically formed itself.  I love you.”
“When Granger and Weasel come over.”
He was about to ask Hermione a question when the fire flared up, again.  They turned to see who it was and was shocked to see Goyle hesitantly step out.
“Could you please ask him to come over to this window?”
“Hey. Hey.  Let’s not do this, okay?  I don't to fight about this, alright?”
Draco pulled back enough to lean in for a kiss and whispered, “I’m ready for the entire world to know that I, Draco Malfoy, am in love with you, Harry Potter, and we are going to live happily ever after.”
“I’ll floo over as soon as I get the paperwork done, promise,” he said with a smile.  “Maybe I can convince Draco to go with me.”
When Draco looked up into Harry’s eyes, he nodded.  “Good.  Let’s see if we can’t get rid of him together then, yeah?”
