. HE bumped into ME! He’s rude, arrogant, and completely at fault here. He startled me okay,” Lyra huffed childishly, crossing her arms defensively.
“Harry,” Lily called from down one of the halls, Harry did an about face and rushed toward his Mother, hugging her tightly, “MUM!”
Leo hummed at his breathless answer leaning in closer until nearly every line of their bodies were pressed together and he began sucking harshly at the base of his neck connecting to his shoulder. Draco couldn’t fight the loud groan he released, panting loudly as he gripped Leo’s waist tightly.
Draco sat reading over the letter repeatedly, it was short but the information it held was endless. Draco could read between the lines. Leo had a very hard childhood, which was clear in his need for control and respect. Leo was definitely going to be a hard nut to crack.
So sorry I've been MIA all year. I had to take some time away. I no it's not really much of an excuse, but I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and My Therapist Suggested I stay away for a while until I was sure I could handle being back. I took the time to heal even took the time away from writing to just focus on healing. I'm hoping I can get back into the swing of things and if anyone's still with the story I thank you for the loyalty. I have every intention of continuing both of my stories, i'm just trying to fight through the block I've encountered after being gone for so long. I have to remember where I wanted these stories to go and i'm trying to see if I can incorporate any of the idea's that have sprung up after rereading my works. Thank you for your loyalty and understanding. I Hope you continue to support my stories to the very end, if I've already lost you thank you for your support thus far.
“Expecting someone else Kitten?” Draco asked looking amused, though there was an almost imperceptible edge to his voice that gave him away.
Chuckie scoffed, “Ignore him, he’s a petty little bitch. He’s not fond of Harry because Harry ‘ruined’ coming out for him. Apparently he had this elaborate overly dramatic ‘I’m Gay speech’ planned and Harry beat him to it. The Drama Queens just being a vindictive little Bitch.”
Blaise and Draco traded guarded looks, before Draco shook his head, “We don’t have any House Elves. The Malfoy’s, I mean my parents specifically, employee Human Butlers and Maids. House Elves creep Mum out. Something about a House Elf named Kreature being obsessive.”
"But, so my names not Harry?" 'Harry' asked looking helplessly lost, this was all too much. First he discovers a long lost Aunt, now he’s not even Harry Potter?
"Dreaming about boss Malfoy?" Theo chuckled, a mocking edge to his tone. He hadn’t been pleased to learn the brunette was spending more time with his future lover than Draco himself was.
Hermione’s chin trembled as she lost her battle against her tears. The sound of her door opening startled her, causing her to wipe her face hurriedly, “Mum?” she turned to see her mother unloading clothes into her dresser  and closet. Hermione watched her quietly for a few minutes before looking back at her book and biting her lip hesitantly, “Mum?”
“He doesn’t agree with his parents views, he feels trapped at home, he just wants to be free!” Harry was desperate for his godfather to see that Draco wasn’t just another Malfoy.
A hand grabbed her arm to steady her, “Now Signorina(1) is that anyway to act, I was always taught to apologize for such rozzo(2) behavior, how rude of you.”
“Tell me how exactly wanting to protect you makes me a coward?” He demanded through clenched teeth. Draco glanced a put upon expression at him before renewing his attempts at throwing off the charm. “You and I both know I’m more than capable of defending myself, and before you say a thing Smith was your bloody fault I was dodging that git well enough before you buggered it all up. Now could you
Julian followed lazily glancing over his shoulder spotting Ginny stewing in the corner an ugly sneer aimed at him. Chuckling he raised his brows mockingly at her, causing the girl to crumple her homework in a fit of anger. Fred and George turned to look at him curiously. Julian waved them off gesturing for them to enter the room first. Fred and George open the door immediately kicking out the only other occupant in the room, before waving him in. Strolling in lazily the younger boy glanced around, really not much to look forward to in seventh year was there.
Leo shivered before looking away quickly to focus on toasting more dragonfly thoraxes. “Add until it turns silver.”
Blaise raised an unimpressed brow, “And if I did?” Draco knew Blaise didn’t like being questioned, what with being the future Don he felt as if his authority was being called into question.
Draco scowled at the boy, dropping his unshaken hand, “I hardly find that funny.” He tightened his hold on Harry’s waist.
The Headmaster stood from his seat taking charge, “Miss Chang, please report to my Office after Supper. It seems our previous talk about acceptance has yet to sick in… Mr. Koshkov, I believe it best if you join Miss Black at Gryffindor for the rest of this Supper you shall join your House mates another time. We shall continue sorting Mr. Malfoy, after we’ll sit down for our Meal, Professor?”
Harry breathed deep for a few moments before reiterating, “My Aunt, Uncle, and Cousin are coming to celebrate my Birthday… Grandma Isabel insisted, so now they’re coming over.”
“Woah kiddo!” Sirius and Remus hurried in after exiting the Den (Where the Floo was located) and witnessing the attack. It took them a moment but the four men managed to pull him off the fat man.
Daphne did her best to distance herself from the angry Slytherins. She stuck close to Draco who’d long ago distanced himself from the group. He’d throw concerned glances at Tracy, who’d been ordered to work with someone from their group in classes, and angry glares at Leo. He smoothly ignored the boy, by focusing on whoever he was working with.
Leo glanced at him, he wasn’t in the mood for this shit, "Walk with me Nott, I'm sure we have much to discuss."
Draco looked back at him, feeling offended, “I didn’t do anything, how in the name of Merlin was I seducing you?”
Leo sat in front of the fire sipping his glass of fire whiskey, pointedly ignoring Julian and the twins who sat quietly at the table behind him. He gritted his teeth, clenching his glass when the door slowly opened Bulstrode and Nott quietly entering. He waited until they’d settled, before emptying his glass and slamming it down onto the table next to his chair, before standing abruptly. The others flinched behind him, growing more nervous by the second.
Draco frowned, as if he’d expected Harry to already know why, “Now I know you’re not a Muggleborn, you had to have heard of my Parents?”
“Malfoy,” Leo called stopping the blonde who had attempted to turn around and sneak away before Leo saw him. The blonde sagged and slowly turned back around to face him.
Harry panted heavily after releasing the other boy smiling sheepishly, “Sorry, I thought you might’ve been having me on when you said that.”
Leo’s friends turned back to look at him all looking unimpressed. “That was pathetic Boss,” Millicent told him bluntly.
Leo glanced at the blonde to see him covertly watching him. He sneered in disgust and flicked him off. The blonde bristled before smirked and blowing him a kiss.
“What is going on here?” Lily asked warily, staring at the blonde in confusion, she didn’t recognize him though he looked familiar.
Lyra huffed, her hot breath seeping through his slacks. Causing him to squirm in discomfort, this girl was going to bloody well kill him. Julian sighed tugging lightly at her messy bun. She obviously got the message as she sat up.
Harry froze, a horrified expression taking over. He glanced up into Draco’s pained eyes, blindly reaching for the older boy’s hand, to squeeze in comfort. His Grandparents were here. Despite all Harry’s confidence that they’d accept Draco, he was still nervous about their initial reaction. After all, his Father must have got his quick temper from someone. The question was which of his Grandparents was it?
"Oh come on you'd look hot and you know it." Lyra begged, shooting him an exasperated look, she obviously wasn’t feeling shy around them anymore. In fact she’d gotten quite bold in the two days they’d known her.
Carina sighed for the millionth time, as she flipped through the files in the public records building, a tiny smile pulling at her lips. "No you won't Uncle Sirius. They raised me okay I'm happy and healthy that's all that matters."
“Master is being too kind again,” Tinsel scolded lightly, wiping her eyes on the silk fabric she wore as clothes. Draco couldn’t convince her to wear anything else so he’d made sure she had two and ordered her to wash whichever one she wore that day. So she was always clean and well taken care of. Not that he’d explained it that way, as she would have a fit if she knew Draco was trying to take care of her.
“NO of course not, you’re just confusing me is all.” Harry defended himself hotly crossing his arms and looking away sulkily.
Leo’s other brow shot up in surprise, clearly he thought Draco would put up more of a fight. He rolled off the blonde and waved his hand, the invisible force pinning him in place lifted allowing the blonde a much needed stretch while pulling his pants and trousers up once more, before he rolled onto his knees his hands planting themselves on Leo’s thighs the rough muggle material under his hands an absent observation. He hesitated lowering his face toward what he could now see was a very
"Aw Honey don't be like that." Ginny cooed, forcing herself into his lap, and wrapping his arms around her. She wrapped her other arm around his neck attempting to kiss him. “You’ll like being my man.”
“Dammit let me spoil my favorite Grandson! I’m old and now that I’m gonna be alone I won’t have anyone to spend money on let me have this!” Jonathan grouched, but it was obvious by the slight smile on his face he wasn’t too angry at their protest. “You and James don’t ask for anything and Harry’s a great kid, I’m glad to spoil him a bit. You were talking to James about teaching him to drive here soon. Now he’ll have something to drive after he gets his license. It’s not like I can’t afford it Lil.”
Harry wasn’t sure if it was the words, or the use of Draco's given name, but Harry felt him pull away before a hand was on the small of his back and he felt something much larger brushing against him. Harry didn’t have to ask again before Draco slowly began pushing into him, his moan going directly into Harry’s ear as he draped himself over Harry’s back.
However, even with the magic mattresses it was around eleven at night and Harry was just lying in the dark staring at the ceiling, most definitely
Seemingly forgetting that they were in a room full of people, Malfoy felt Potter tangle his fingers in his hair and gently tug him towards his neck. Kissing down his jawline Malfoy gently sucked on Potter’s neck before doing something that, depending how you look at it, was either a really bad idea, or a fantastic one. He had paused when Harry let out a shaky breath, his lips brushing the skin of his pulse point before he harshly bit down on the soft skin. With the reaction Potter had Malfoy is pretty sure that he didn’t mean to do it, but he let out a soft moan and arched his body up.
Snorting at Draco's tactfulness Harry said, "I know I like it when I do it to myself, but I don't know how I'd feel about someone else doing it. Plus, I had a feeling that this was something that if I asked you to do, you would do it, but you wouldn't be fully comfortable doing it. And I don't want you doing something like that just because I want it."
Draco laughed and half heartedly fought off Harry’s attack, eventually winning by pushing Harry onto his back with an undignified yelp, and laying on top of him. For a moment all was silent, before Draco whispered in an almost shocked tone, “I really- wow. You look like you were mauled by a very horny vampire.”
Malfoy sat up with a frown and went to tell Weasley off, but he hadn’t uttered a single syllable before Potter snapped at his best friend, “how fucking
The ravenette was quickly coming undone by Draco's actions and he knew if they kept going at this rate he was going to be cumming in his pants like a teenager, but he didn't care. He needed Draco's body on him like a drowning man needs oxygen. He
As he took in Draco’s appearance, Harry realized had no idea when Draco had removed his own clothes or, judging by the state of his soft cock, when he had cum. But Harry was too sated to care, “enjoy the show?”
For several minutes the only noise was the sound of the pair eating. Neither boy said a word as Harry carefully watched Draco’s expression as he looked over the papers. He was unusually nervous at how Draco would react to all of this because part of him was still unsure. There was this nagging voice in the back of his head whispering that Draco didn’t actually want any of this and that he was just biding his time until something- someone better came along. Harry knew these thoughts were ridiculous and that that wasn’t the case, but after spending over a month second-guessing everything Draco did, thoughts like that were hard to get rid of.
The sudden pleasure in that small amount of pain lit something in the pit of Harry’s stomach and he wanted Draco to get rough. He wanted Draco to bite him, to pull his hair, to tell him what to do. To not treat him like some fragile little doll. What Harry hadn’t realized is that he had voiced these thoughts aloud, and Draco was more than willing to make them a reality.
Chuckling at his boyfriends neediness Draco placed a quick kiss on his forehead, “I’m just getting us something to sleep in.”
Awkwardly coming over the ravenette sat down next to Malfoy, their bare shoulders brushing lightly at the action, “Why am I over here?”
The room fell into darkness and Draco shifted to get comfortable, his fingers idly tracing circles on Harry’s back as the night caught up with him, “Harry?” Harry made a noise of acknowledgement, “how do you feel about Italian food?”
Potter’s eyes fluttered shut as he let out a soft whine, moving to take Malfoy’s whole finger in his mouth with a desperate suck. It was all Malfoy could do to not have his way with him right there, “I’d cover him in bites and bruises to mark him as mine. And perhaps, if I was feeling generous, I would let him fuck me into the mattress in return.”
“Yeah, now that that talk is done,” wrapping his legs around Draco's waist, Harry pulled their hips flush together, broken moans escaping both boys at the glorious friction, “shut up and fuck me.”
Grinning Draco leaned back and pulled out so just the tip was inside Harry, before slamming back in, a punched moan escaping the boy beneath him. Draco had a bruising grip on Harry’s hips and the words Harry so desperately wanted to hear started flowing out of his mouth like water, “fuck Harry, you feel so good.
Draco a handjob would probably be enough to get him off, but he didn't want to. He was lusting after his boyfriend like crazy yes, but said boyfriend was working his ass off and came home every night exhausted. Harry knew that doing something like that, whilst enjoyable for both of them, would only tire Draco out more and could cause his mind to wander, distracting him from what he needed to be focused on. And that was the last thing Harry wanted.
Thankfully Draco had the brainpower to cast a cleaning charm to vanish the mess on the bed, and their bodies, before collapsing next to Harry.
about it. Even with everything that had happened because of it, Harry was proud of Draco and he was going to let the whole damn world know.
Reaching over to grab his wand Draco casted some spell that made a loud popping noise outside their door, before there were hushed whispers and footsteps walking away, “that should keep them away for a while.”
Harry managed to mumble in agreement through the fog of arousal clouding his mind. His movements began faltering as his climax began climbing, “I want- I’m gonna
Malfoy stood up so he wouldn’t wack Pansy in the face and pulled his sweatshirt over his head, instantly everyone in the room gasped as they realized what they were looking at, at the scars. Malfoy was fairly certain it took Potter a moment to put two and two together, and when he did Malfoy honestly thought that the golden boy was going to throw up. Merlin, if his bastard of a “friend” had just changed the dare then it wouldn't have been an issue, but two can play at that game. Malfoy is a Slytherin after all.
Faster than any tipsy person should be able to move, Potter pushed Malfoy back into a sitting position before swinging a leg over to straddle his lap and pulling him into a bruising kiss. Ripping a strangled noise out of Malfoy as he dropped his weight down.
Draco ignored the group as he grabbed Harry’s hand and took them back up to their room, quickly throwing up a locking and silencing charm to give them the privacy they deserved. For a moment the two just looked at each other, not saying anything. Then the next they were both moving and their bodies collided with a sudden need that hadn’t been there before.
They converted an old classroom on the sixth floor for all of the returning eighth years to stay in, and it was probably big enough that everyone could've all had their own rooms, but is that what happened? Ha, no. She put Luna, Hermione, and Pansy in a room together; Ron, Dean and Theodore together; Neville, Blaise, and Seamus in another; which meant that the last room was for the two people who shouldn't be anywhere near each other. What could possibly go wrong with Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter sleeping in the same room?
“Meade, Blake, Conant, Armstrong, Archibald, Carrington, Elverson, Macon, Devereaux, and even Smith, Smith was actually only his study partner for Ancient Ruins by the way. Smith was hitting on Malfoy and he wasn’t interested.” Theo listed off smirking, his leader turned friend really needed to just get over it and shag Malfoy senseless already. He wasn’t about to tell him that Malfoy was still dreaming about him. The blonde may put up silencing spell at night but he couldn’t exactly hide the embarrassed and nervous flush he’d try to hide from Theo in the morning.
“Draco wait!” Smith called out turning the corner and stopping in front of the suit of armor to catch his breath. “Where…?”
Sirius blinked, looking dazed for a second before grinning, "Oh yeah, Lettie, real firecracker that one, how is she?"
Draco let out a shocked laugh and smiled for the first time in a long time, “Kid you don’t know what you’re saying.”
"Rae stop he hates that, and no we’re quite serious." Carina sighed, using the nickname Sirius gave her sister.
Lyra, Carina, and Julian looked horrified, while a stunned silence fell over the rest of the students.
Draco flipped them before Harry had time to really process that he’d moved, “Don’t make me any promises love, I’ll hold you to them.”
forgotten. Draco sighed as she lectured him on hygiene as she shuffled through the filthy clothes piled in the corner of his room.
"I know," Sirius deadpanned, looking annoyed that Remus was repeating himself, and frustrated with the clinging clothes, "We just said that."
“Rion… Orion’s here as well?” Draco almost gapped as the familiar blonde rounded their dark hair friend the smirk at him impishly.
Theo cleared his throat attempting to steer the conversation to safer grounds, “I have to admit we had an ulterior reason to inviting you both here other than to talk to Draco.”
He couldn’t believe it. His crush, even if it had only been for his appearance, had said he liked him too. He didn’t care if it was just a physical attraction, he was a teenage boy he had hormones like anyone else. Plus dating was all about getting to know each other, and he was really interested in getting to know the sexy bloke in front of him. Both physically and otherwise, he wouldn’t mind as long as it was good. And… bloody hell!
Rolling his eyes and adopting a put upon expression Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, “Merlin, do you Slytherins know nothing, I’d expect this sort of ignorance from that cow Parkinson but I’d had higher hopes for you two fools.”
"The Adoption agency, they told me the place in case I wanted to find my real parents one day." Hermione replied feeling just as choked up. They’d actually told her so she could ‘go back to her devil worshipping family’ as they’d called them.
Julian sighed as he loosened his already loose tie a bit more, his casually worn uniform showing his clear disregard for the Headmasters rules, as he strolled lazily down the hall to lunch. The twins matched down to the button if Leo and Julian hadn’t known the girls as they did they’d have to really look for to figure out which twin was which. Both girls wore their shirts out and ties loose, mid-thigh length plaid skirts in Gryffindor colors with black kitten heels and sheer knee high socks. Their piercings removed as was school policy during class hours. Leo had opted out of his school robes and rolled the sleeves of his school shirt to his elbows, leaving his shirt out with his tie hanging loose and a few buttons undone. The four had been called out plenty of times but the rules only said they had to wear the uniform not how they had to wear it.
“Merlin Kitten, I thought you were hurt or something,… Haven’t you figured it out yet?” The easy grin on Leo’s face nearly had him melting from the warmth alone. Slowly he shook his head, curious to what the boy meant.
Orion quirked a brow fighting a smile while Mikhail shook his head sympathetically, glancing around him at the two.
Draco quickly reached up and pulled him down, meeting him halfway in a burning kiss. Leo couldn’t move, a fire had started in his stomach the second Draco’s soft warm lips had met his. He was kissing him, and Leo was pretty sure he was kissing back. Leo braced his hand firmly on the wall behind Draco’s head, trying to hold himself up and grab onto some element of control as he found himself forcing the blonde back against the wall, as the fire spread to his chest. He couldn’t breathe reaching up with his free hand he tangled it in Draco’s hair, and pulled back just barely long enough to take a breath before he was back and forcing the blonde’s mouth open to taste him. Vanilla and Cinnamon overwhelming him, the taste the smell, it was spellbinding. His brain was a scattered mess as he tried to make sense of what was happening but he brushed it off too busy tasting every part of the other boy’s mouth.
“I hold an interest in him,” Draco retorted defensively, tugging on his arm, he wouldn’t admit that Leo was making him nervous. He glared at the wall in front of him and tried to yank his arm free, while demanding forcefully, “Let go!”
“Leo has had enough meddling from the old fool, our sources have uncovered Intel stating that the old man had been planning to kill him and steal his magic in the final battle, claim that Leo was going Dark due to all the loss’ he’d suffered. Next he’d stage Carina’s Death to look like a suicide (Greif from losing her friend) and steal her magic. Then he’d hunt down Lyra and he’d officially have stolen all of the old Evans and Potter Family Magics.” Theo explained lacing his fingers with Carina’s in an attempt to calm her.
Draco chuckled, pulling the slightly resistant boy closer, “Well I’m going to teach you how to be a proper bed partner,” Harry scowled at the older boy’s smug smirk, “and you’re going to teach me how to be a boyfriend.”
Harry chuckled watching him shuffle around looking for his clothes. Harry snatched his boxers away when he found them. “I’m keeping these.” He smirked at Draco’s shocked face.
“Don’t come to Pomfrey, if anything dire comes up you’ll only wind up in Saint Mungos anyway. See Tracy before even contemplating coming here. Malfoy,” Prewett nodded sharply at the blonde, before smirking at the Potions Master, “Professor,” he drawled mockingly, with a cheeky little grin.
"Prewett, I insist." Julian interrupted boldly, he didn’t care who Dumbledore thought he was he would address them appropriately.
“They’ll kill you,” Leo stated factually, never letting his thoughts show, she was more desperate than he originally believed. Her situation was a dangerous one, it could also jeopardize his mission if he allowed her to join and she became compromised. He had to word this carefully, had to pull her in, in such a way that she remained loyal.
“Our bedrooms are upstairs. The perk to living underground is that we have plenty of unused space down here to do as we please. My Mum was a Ravenclaw, her house was in one of the towers. Apparently they stuff five students into a room, strange that, you’d think magic would grant them a few liberties. Guess not.” Blaise murmured as he looked around.
Theo nodded, “Yeah, they miss you. You’ve been acting crazy since this whole thing with Draco started. Maybe it’s time you spent some time with Julian and the Twins that wasn’t ruined by the masks you’re all putting up for the rest of the school.”
"Wrong, my parents were neutral, as were Sirius and Remus, Dumbledore messed with they're memories. I spoke with them recently. That night two years ago Sirius wasn't after Pettigrew or me. He went after Dumbledore only for him to Alter his memories too. The Old Man's trying to control me. But I won't let him." Leo growled the last sentence, the dark threat heavy in his tone.
Harry cheered, before dragging an incredibly confused Draco over to the car, and began explaining what if was and what it was for. The intrigued look on the blondes face made Lily smile. She’d been so worried that Harry’s Birthday would end in disaster, but Draco had actually managed to save the day in an admittedly unusual way, but here you have it. She hugged herself loosely, wishing not for the first time that James was here, unharmed and open minded so he could see just how
Leo snorted, eyes narrowing cruelly as he glared at the center of the table. “Lord Zabini… I don’t merely plan on killing the old Fool.”
Leo flushed looking away from the others, had he really gotten angry at the other blokes over Malfoy. Was he really that agitated about being ignored? Because obviously it wasn’t jealousy, he couldn’t be gay… he just couldn’t.
Leo’s hands were everywhere! Draco groaned arching in to the raven above him when the boy squeezed his ass. He’d no idea it would be such a turn on.
“Uh huh,” Draco interrupted, sounding amused, “We both know you can’t resist my sexy good looks, everything I do is irresistible… remember.”
“I’m sorry alright,” Leo gritted out between his teeth. “I didn’t mean to hurt your pride. I just don’t understand why you were being nice, and you can’t really blame me because you’ve never been before! I’m sorry.”
What do you think? I won't post them right away I want to focus on the two stories I have going right now but I'd like to start the outline for them if you all think I should. Working on them will in no way effect these two stories! I promise!
Leo scowled, rubbing his chest as if remembering something unpleasant “That part wasn’t faked. Riddle (Or Voldemort as you know him) tried to possess me after Quirrell’s body failed. Due to an ancient blood ritual performed by my Grandparents when I was born, as is tradition for all Potter’s on their first birthday, he was ejected immediately. And the seal hiding the brand of protection was broken.”
“I didn’t mention that?” Draco blinked at the annoyed look Harry sent him, before insisting, “I could have sworn I mentioned that.”
“About you and Hogwarts resident ‘Mob Boss’ Leo Potter,” Blaise clarified smirking at his own private joke. He seemed to think it was ‘cute’ that the students began calling Potter and his group that. Though if Draco were honest, it seemed to fit, Leo and his group seemed to behave like they were part of the Mob. ‘Don Leo’… that was a frightening thought.
Draco’s eyebrows shot to his hairline in surprise, well wasn’t this interesting, he responded casually as a slow smirk curled his own lips, “And you go in pieces, asshole…”
Draco yelped in surprise, as Harry practically knocked him over, catching his mouth in a surprise kiss. He mentally shook it off returning the smaller boys kiss.
Leo raised a brow, before pulling a piece of parchment, ink, and a quill from his bag, “Show me. I’m going to send this note to the twins to meet us here, you cast the Charm and we’ll see how well it works.”
Leo scowled feeling even more on edge. He quickly reached over and closed Malfoy’s notebook firmly. Malfoy pulled his hands back quickly so they wouldn’t get caught and looked at Leo questioningly.
Harry sighed in annoyance, catching the tennis ball he’d been tossing against the wall. It was junked at the start of summer, along with the rest of the sports equipment the Dursley’s had bought Dudley, in an attempt to get him to exercise. Harry had rescued a few things to keep himself entertained until Dumbledore deemed it ‘safe’ to ‘rescue’ him.
Draco nods frowning slightly, “Tinsel I order you to join me at Hogwarts this Year. I’ll need my personal Elf while at school. Should Lucius or Narcissa Malfoy call for you, you are not to heed them. I’ll send word once we arrive at Hogwarts. After dropping me off you are to go to Hogwarts and check in with the Headmaster inform him that you have my permission to help there in any way possible but that I am your main priority.”
Blaise nodded calmly, as if he understood exactly what he meant, and he probably did. “Logical decision, though if you ever change your mind, I can ‘fix’ him anytime you want.”
Draco sucked roughly at the new love-bite he’d left on Harry’s shoulder before carefully removing himself and began to clean them both up.
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
“I didn’t mean to make you feel that way,” Harry whispered, staring at the comforter, and trying to clear the lump forming in his throat.
"Believe you, I don't even trust you. Look what happened with Leo." Julian scoffed, smirking inwardly, Dumbledore walked right into that one, this might be a bit easier than he thought.
Leo’s eyes flashed with interest causing Theo to pale even more, “No, mate are you crazy,” Theo hissed quietly panic cause his voice to rise a bit.
Sirius, in an effort to calm the storm before it happened, opened his mouth to defend the boy when. “HEEEEEEE HAAAAAWWWW!”
Paul shrugged grinning like a cat that got the cream, “Well at least we know he’s not taking a tumble with some random bloke in the park.”
He reached his hand under the small arch Harry made in his pain rubbing circles into his lower back to try to relax him.
“Never mind,” Draco chuckled, tongue sweeping his top lip again. Harry’s eyes followed the movement, his breathing was still ragged. Draco didn’t seem to realize that he’d just initiated the first REAL kiss they’d shared in… weeks! Feeling a bit cheated Harry scowled at his boyfriends back thinking quickly, Draco would NOT get away with teasing him. Snatching his hand away the raven made a beeline for the park. He had the perfect idea.
Leo glared, "Not funny at all." He seethed glancing over his shoulder at the blonde, "He grabbed my ass in Charms. I didn't even know he was behind me."
“I want you to talk to him,” Leo ignored his cousin, looking at Theo pointedly, “Tell him I’d like to speak with him.”
Draco sighed in relief, “I just turned sixteen last week, June 5th.” Draco informed him returning to his neck.
Well this defiantly killed any denial he made to being Gay. He was pretty sure kissing a guy and liking it meant he was. Or was Lyra right? Was it just Draco? Did he care? Did he want this? Did he really just leave the boy there after kissing him senseless? Leo skidded to a halt in the middle of the hall looking back down the Hall.
Harry glanced over at Orion and Mikhail who seemed to be eyeing the red head suspiciously, and if the glance they shared meant anything they were determined to find out what Ron was leaving out. Harry just hoped when they found out that it wasn’t as bad as he suspected. After all… Professor Whinsaw kind of scared him sometimes.
Harry sighed brushing his hand against the blondes on the table shooting him a helpless smile. Draco nodded minutely without really looking at him, before engaging Mikhail in a conversation about their Arithmancy homework. With the blonde distracted Harry looked over at Orion who seemed to be watching him in concern. If he was honest, the raven was feeling a bit depressed, He hadn’t had a moment alone with Draco outside of classes or meals in two weeks. And the blonde seemed to be drifting farther and farther out of reach. He understood the blonde had to keep up appearances and that things wouldn’t be easy for them, but some of the things he was hearing concerned him a bit. And the heated looks Parkinson was constantly giving the blonde didn’t help sooth his nerves any either.
Malfoy slowly shook his head, “I’m not mad at you.” Malfoy picked up his bag leaving the mountain of books on the table, only grabbing the one he’d been reading.
“In any case,” Leo turned to Julian and Lyra, “Keep an eye on Bulstrode and Nott. If we can’t trust them at all we’ll turn them away. If we can… well we’ll have some solid Allies.”
“What the Bloody hell?” Harry demanded before realizing who it was. The blonde stood up brushing himself off and glancing at the bat looking unimpressed.
Carina chuckled as she slid onto the desk in front of Lyra allowing the girl to lay her head in her lap in exhaustion, "You guy did so well you wore us out," Carina laughed.
"Try Black, Regulus was they're father," Sirius supplied excitedly, he almost grinned at Harry's shock.
A mask settled firmly over his expression as he nodded tightly at the red head before stalking quickly away. “100 points from Gryffindor for conspiring to skip Detention, and Filch will see you at eight tonight sharp Mr. Prewett.”
“I don’t recall giving you permission to use my name so comfortably,” Daphne hissed in outrage, red hair flaring slightly with her magic.
Lyra lifted a hand to rub her neck before grinning at him, "Your passion for the truth gave me chills."
“You all seem to forget that I’M in charge here,” Leo looked at each of them sharply, “We’re going to focus on our goal from now on. No more of this pointless crap about Malfoy!”
Blaise raised a skeptical brow appearing amused, but nodded in acceptance, “The common rooms are this way. Slytherin has the whole of the Dungeons so each Year has their own section off the main commons and then it’s three to a Suite, all with our own rooms of course. Suppose I wouldn’t mind if we shared a suite with you.”
Leo hitched the blondes leg higher driving into him desperately, he’d wanted this for so long and all sense of control had slipped from his grasp the second he’d pulled Draco’s pretty pink lips from his prick, he gripped the blondes leg higher with one hand, cradling his head with the other, he dipped his head to steal a desperate kiss. The blondes cries were getting more and more, desperate, getting louder and louder with every thrust.
Draco rolled his eyes impatiently before grabbing himself and helping Harry line himself up, “Sit.” He demanded.
Amelia laced here arm with his, “Come Draco Mein Kind, I wanted to run an idea by you to get your opinion.”
“Don’t get it wrong,” Blaise warned harshly, the foreboding look on the Italian’s face wiped the sardonic smirk right off the blondes face.
Professor McGonagall faltered, watching Mikhail stalk angrily over to the Gryffindor table, and drop stiffly into the space Hermione and Ginny offered between them. Ginny patted his back hesitantly, earning her a stiff but grateful smile from the boy.
“You’re dry down there! It’ll hurt!” Draco panted in frustration, “Do something! Use that spell to… wet your naughty bits!”
A loud crack had several of the girls releasing startled shrieks, Draco would’ve sworn one came from Davis who was still passed out on the ground.
“You’re a virgin, you wouldn’t have lasted to long if I’d taken you right away, it takes a while to build up stamina.” Draco explained only sounding slightly breathless.
Julian chuckled as Lyra flopped huffily onto the couch beside him, shoving his book to the floor and dropping her head into his lap. He sat for a moment staring at the wall, asking himself what he could’ve possibly done to deserve such difficulties in life, before giving up and running a hand over her hair soothingly, “What happened?”
Julian scoffed raking a hand through his hair roughly, “Poor bastard doesn’t realize the kind of man Dumbledore is.”
Finally he pulled out the old Album, looking it over Harry could barely make out the worn gold script on the shabby old brown cover. He frowned in confusion at the words it looked like a woman had written it, though admittedly his Grandfather could have paid to have it done professionally.
“I thought I’d just said.” Draco sank a bit deeper into the tub trying not to get too excited about Leo’s proximity.
Millie shrugged, ignoring the tiny redhead (strawberry blonde- Daphne would correct indignantly) “I haven’t heard anything either.”
Julian waved him off, “Calm down Boss you should be use to the accusations by now, and besides, Julius Archibald is STILL in the hospital growing Fungus. If you weren’t jealous of him dating Malfoy go slip him the antidote and free the poor bastard when the Nurse is in the store room doing inventory.”
“Impatient,” Draco snorted before ripping the condom open with his teeth and rolling it on pinching the top. He quickly slicked himself up noting that Harry was slowly becoming hard again.
Lyra swallowed and took a step back before straightening herself and staring him down boldly, “And I was always taught it was polite to introduce myself before assuming anything. You may misread a situation and make an ass out of yourself.”
Blaise sighed deeply, a mock look of disappointment on his face, “Unfortunately Draco disapproves of fun so he’s not dead. He’s been admitted to Saint Mungos without a name, they’ll figure it out when he wakes in a month or so, but he won’t be able to speak of our little… ‘talk’”
"Relax they aren't here to yell at us," Leo soothed, neglecting to mention the LONG lecture they’d probably be getting later over these little outings of theirs, "They're on our side remember."
Harry watched Vernon’s hands twitch with a raised brow and an amused twitch of his lip, “Careful Vernon, wouldn’t want you to hurt yourself again.”
Millicent nodded and stood to follow. Ignoring the shocked expressions on their fellow classmates faces, the six students swept out of the room.
“So Ms Black, how was your night in the Tower?” Draco asked mildly as he led her down to the end of the table gesturing for Blaise and Adrian to take the seats across from them.
“What did you just say?” Draco asked coldly. Let know one say he’d inherited nothing from Lucius Malfoy, when he was Angry… you could
Leo rounded on him with a cold look, bracing his hands on the table, “Is that going to be a problem?”
Ron looked up at him, appearing interested again, "Makes since, but why, if your parents were on the light you would be as well right?"
Draco was awoken twenty minutes after his head hit the pillow by a horrible bone chilling scream. Moving quickly he threw off the plush white comforter and darted out into the hall wand at the ready.
“Ms Davis, we’re very busy and while I appreciate your interest I find it hard to believe you can be of any use to me that Theo or Millie can’t.” Leo drawled his eyes ran up and down her body thoughtfully before he raised a cool brow, “No nothing useful.”
don’t expect me to extend the same courtesy,” the blonde huffed, and attempting to ignore the uneasy feeling the look in his eyes gave her, before storming into her room. It was while passing her full length mirror that she finally realized.
Tracy nodded quickly fighting the urge to hug the boy, she responded breathless with relief, “Completely, you won’t regret it, I promise.”
Sirius sat heavily in the Chair next to the fire, listening to the softly murmured conversation in the kitchen. This was not what he’d been expecting when he’d decided to come and check on Harry again today. His godson had been distracted as of late and he’d been worried. He took a sip of tea and watched the flames dance, trying to decide on what to do.
Malfoy nodded slowly his eyes never leaving Leo’s, “Alright, that sounds fair. I haven’t been pulling my weight on that end and for that I apologize. I promise that when the time comes tomorrow no matter what Professor Snape decides, I let him know that I’ll be testing the potion tomorrow.”
Leo didn't finish the letter choosing to burn the letter in his anger and disgust. Not only was Malfoy assuming he was gay but he was also trying to take a choice out of his hands and Leo would NOT stand for it.
Lyra and Leo looked up from the Map, the Marauders Map truly was useful, annoyance flashing across their faces. Theo who’d obviously chased her the whole way back leaned against the wall trying to catch his breath.
“I don’t know,” Harry sniffed trying to hold back tears, he’d obviously hurt the other boy without meaning to. He felt like a horrible boyfriend, “I guess I just couldn’t control myself. I thought you were trying to seduce me so we didn’t have to do anything else.”
Julian frowned looking her over with a frustrated calculating gaze, “I’ve always prided myself on being able to read people. To be honest the fact that I can’t read you is rather, troublesome, but somehow incredibly …. Sexy. I won’t push you too tell me, after all I do love a challenge, though I thought it only fair to warn you.”
“You both must swear an oath that you won’t reveal anything we tell you, an oath of Silence.” Leo warned the two. Both girls nodded moving forward to make the oath.
Leo quickly measured them out and handed them over. Malfoy nodded his thanks as he slowly stirred them in, before adjusting the temperature. The potion slowly bubbled into a blue color causing Malfoy to nod firmly.
The others stared at him in disbelief while Draco dropped his napkin to rub the bridge of his nose with his thumb as he usually did when he thought Harry did or said something particularly stupid or foolish.
“Julian, why don’t you and the girls show the other to their rooms… I’ll show Draco to his in a moment.” Draco swallowed thickly at the promises laced in that simple statement.
He knew nothing was happening, he trusted his boyfriend, but he didn’t like not being able to talk to Draco about it.
“So, will you and Millie join us in Hogsmeade or did you both have previous engagements?” Leo inquired wrapping an arm around Lyra who’d attached herself to his side in a tight hug.
Draco clenched his jaw and fist, doing his best to remain calm, he can’t have failed already. Even if he did, at least he had Harry. He could survive being Homeless and poor if he still had Harry. Though his pride would definitely take a hit, and Mr Potter would undoubtedly not be pleased with his son’s choice in life partners. A knutless, failure with no place to call home.
Harry craned his head around to shot a bewildered look at the newest Gryffindor. Orion was perched on Ron’s bed looking for all the world like she belonged there. The  Blonde shrugged tilting her head in concern. Sighing Harry flopped back down as he felt Seamus and Ron lay/sit down on either side of him.
Umbridge's speech though caused a bit of a stir. It was uncomfortably clear Dumbledores' trouble made her happy.
“Truthfully? Your Hot, I’m selfish, and I don’t know there is just something really sexy about a Hot bloke spilling his life story out on my bed. But seriously, I want to get to know you. Yeah it’s really a physical attraction now but that’s honestly how most couples start. They see someone attractive and decide they want to get to know them.”
“She speaks ill of a friend for the way he was born, I’m uncomfortable around such prejudice, and ignorance so I should really move.” He explained tightly, expression darkening as the girl scoffed.
Leo frowned of course Snape was going to attempt to trip him up. They were discussing the Girding Potion.
“Mr Malfoy, do you know why I’m hard on you and your peers?” The man asked pointedly after waving his wand and allowing the doors to slam shut on Blaise and Adrian’s confused faces. Draco felt tension shoot up his spine. This wasn’t looking good.
“No, no he didn’t,” Ron chuckled darkly, he glanced up at Harry, looking between him, Orion, and Mikhail, “He just tried to apologize, the Bastard wouldn’t let him, he… just forget it. Draco has it under control.”
“Unfortunately, we don’t get on well,” The blonde admitted cautiously, he still wasn’t sure if he trusted the Italian, but there wasn’t much he could do with any of the Information he had obtained, at least not without running the risk of being wrong. He had nothing solid on Draco, and if he could help it, he wouldn’t until it was determined whether the other boy was trustworthy or not.
Sirius shot Leo sour looks every few minutes, huffing childishly, and sticking his nose in the air. Leo didn’t seem to mind, or even notice really, sipping his tea calmly while reading the morning post.
Draco frowned eyes trailing ‘Leo Potter’s’ every move. He hadn’t expected this when he’d boarded the train this morning. It will definitely prove for an interesting year, and called a lot into question. Did he really want to pursue Leo now that he knew he was Potter? Yes, he had an amazing Ass. But was he willing to do it publicly? The Golden Gryffindor would obviously want everyone to know. Because who wouldn’t want to brag about Draco?...
Glancing up, Harry grinned at the sight of his ever patient boyfriend, he was too good to him. He strode quickly over to the taller boy, and launched himself into the blonde’s arms, immediately placing an eager kiss on his lips. Yes, he’d wait to tell his Father, maybe he’d tell him after he graduated… when he can properly hide Draco… in America, or Australia…. Somewhere he can’t find them. That sounded lovely.
The two men crawled out of the bush looking embarrassed. Giving the boy a pointed look, that clearly told him, to NOT ask. He asked anyway.
Draco sat up in shock to see his very annoyed housemates staring at him, some with mild amusement, others just plain annoyed.
Leo froze as his own words caught up to him. His hand paused halfway to his mouth as if to cover it in horror at his thoughtless insults.
The blonde kicked at a balled up scrap of paper a student had left behind, frowning deeply, he refused to admit he was sulking.
“My apologies, may I ask who you are, and why you sent me this mirror in the first place?” Draco asked hesitantly, the man looked somewhat familiar actually.
"Yeah we went to the adoption agency and everything. Carina Black, well they had it as Evans but you know." Leo grinned at their flustered expressions.
Julian shrugged, schooling his features to a blank mask, and never pausing in his pace, “The ‘Dumb Bitch’ assigned me detention for calling her a toad who wouldn’t know real Defense if it bit her in the ass. You’re better suited for the position, you should be teaching the subject. She didn’t like my revelation very much, needless to say. Unfortunately, I don’t have time to sit around and torture myself with a blood-quill… I’d thought those were illegal… Professor,” Julian smirked back at the stunned man, nodding politely, “Regardless of your personal feelings I’m sure as an educator yourself you wouldn’t allow your students to be violated in such a way.”
“I’m not too broken up about it, I’ll just skip it anyway,” He drawled lazily, internally cringing at the arrogant tone in his voice, but it had to be done for his plan to work.
“So now that we’ve had time to relax and have a bit of fun, I must insist we discuss at the very least our two possible recruits.” Julian threw in lazily, but a conflicted frown tugged at his lips.
Carina frowned as he cut her off with a forceful kiss, she blinked at the frustrated chuckle the curly haired boy huffed out.
Leo hummed resting his chin on the blondes shoulder. “I wanted to share this with you. You are the only one I’ve brought to this place. Julian, Carina, Lyra… I haven’t even told them about the clearing. This is my place, I come here to think, and find peace.”
“Well it doesn’t matter, you’re wrong I don’t like Potter any longer, so you’re wasting time.” Draco snapped in annoyance. Potter was just a big ugly git anyway. Who needed those chiseled abs, broad shoulders and rugged good looks. Bad! I mean ugly horrible looks!
“Huh? What do you mean?” Harry asked he had no idea what the boy was talking about. As far as he was aware the boy had climbed through his window.
Harry and Draco dressed slowly before walking slowly down to the Kitchen. Sirius was at the counter making tea. “Sit,” He instructed firmly, without turning to look at them.
Harry laughed humorlessly, “Gran is always trying to resolve the tension between Mum and Aunt Petunia. It’ll never happen though… not after what they did.”
“Carina, Lyra, Julian, this is Tracy, we’ll be keeping an eye on her,” Leo drawled, as if merely introducing the girl was a chore. The others nodded murmuring their greeting, before returning to their previous actions. Julian flirting shamelessly with a sixth year girl causing her friends to giggle girlishly, Lyra turned to engage Millicent and Leo in conversation, while Theo and Carina made eyes at each other.
Harry was watching Draco worriedly the boy had fallen back on his bed hands folded beneath his head as his eyes scanned the posters on his ceiling. The boy looked so angry.
“Good man,” Sirius cheered, turning his attention back to the teens. He opened his mouth to speak only for a loud squealing to erupt from behind him. Carina darted past him, seemingly appearing from nowhere, and threw herself into Theo’s arms. Theo yelped as he stumbled back, holding her tightly in an effort not to fall.
“Do you Understand Draco?” Lucius asked silkily, clearly under the impression that Draco had been listening “Are we clear?”
Leo tilted his head thoughtfully eyeing said ‘couple’ critically. “It’s settled then, congratulations on your new relationship you two, you’re officially in a committed relationship.”
He reached down catching the end of Harry’s shirt and dragging it over his head, “This... this I can do.” Draco breathed before attaching his mouth to Harry’s throat. Harry groaned exposing more of his throat.
Harry trembled lightly memories of last night drifting lazily through his mind, “Upstairs.” He decided.
Carina launched herself out of Leo's lap and into Sirius' to hug him. She had an Uncle. Maybe the loving Parent fantasy was out of her reach, but a loving Uncle was just as good right? She hoped he couldn’t sense how desperately she wanted this. A loving family… that wasn’t too selfish of her right? She just wanted to feel loved.
Draco smirked slightly as he swallowed it all sucking or Harry’s rapidly softening member lightly cleaning him up as he pulled off.
Leo scoffed and walked around the big tub so he could look in Draco’s face, “That’s not going to happen Malfoy.”
Leo shrugged, before attempting to change the subject "I'm going to write to Sirius, want me to say anything for you?"
Leo chuckled smirking in amusement. “They call it the Lost Room, because it moves around the seventh floor, occasionally disappearing entirely. In all honesty, I stumbled upon this room in second year. Carina, Julian, and I later discovered it was the Lost RoR. We studied late into the night in the restricted section on how to summon it. It’s one of Hogwarts many Dark secrets.”
Hermione looked surprised, but nodded none the less. She was nervous, she hadn’t told either of her friends about her ‘home’ situation yet and she was beginning to worry. How would she get to Kings Cross? She could probably hide out in one of the bathrooms for the night. But she’d have to walk there, she was quickly running out of money.
Ten minutes later the door jerked open and a confused Carina peeked in before entering with Lyra, and Millie following after, both frowning curiously.
Leo chuckled lightly, pulling back to raise a brow at him, “Remus is Sirius’ Boyfriend, as well as an old friend of my Parents, he’s like a second Godfather to me. And this is Sirius’ Home so I really don’t have much of a say in who lives here. Not that I’d make him leave if I did.”
Lyra shot him a reproachful look, "Oh don't get all cheesed off boss, and I was only having a bit of fun."
Draco rolled his eyes, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and dropping his chin on top of the shorter teens head, “Next time mate, I promised Harry a trip to the Cinema.”
“He heard us talking, he knows Lucius is trying to protect me, and save me from becoming a Death Eater. He knows I don’t support the Dark Lord. Smith doesn’t seem to understand how deadly that information could be.” Draco sighed in relief when Blaise released him. Unfortunately, now Blaise knew the truth, which meant nothing good could come next. Smith’s future was looking very grim.
“Would you believe me if I said it was debating between Gryffindor and Slytherin. It argued both points, then made me give a detailed reason for why I should be a Slytherin. I felt like I was talking to a more reasonable version of my Father, it was… Odd.” Draco decided before placing a soft kiss below Harry’s ear.
Blaise rolled his eyes, slouching casually in the comfortable looking armchair, “They just want to talk to us Draco… Relax.”
The Gryffindor's gasped, while the Slytherins smirked at the Gryffindor's audacity, the other two Houses were too stunned to do anything.
“I woke once after arriving, to hear the Headmaster insisting to check me over. He kept saying the sigil on my chest, if it was there, could ruin all his plans. I guess my magic really wanted to hide it. Because after poking and prodding at my chest for a while he declared it wasn’t there. That my parents must not have believed in the old ritual. After changing for the first time after the accident… Julian walked in and saw it. We found Carina and hurried off to the Library. We found the answer in an old Journal. It was a book titled ‘Seals and Enochians’ it belonged to an ancestor of mine… actually it had been his personal research Journal so…”
“Alright… What is it?” Harry pressed tilting his head slightly, and tugging lightly on the taller boy’s shirt.
Harry sighed as McGonagall finished her speech, and made a quick beeline for the Boy’s Dorm. The quick shuffling of feet told him his friends were right behind him.
“It’s fine, you don’t have to return my feelings just yet, but I don’t want you to have any doubt in how I feel about you… it’s important to me that you know.”
Draco and the others started before hurrying in as Sirius turned to the Dwarf, the large doors slowly closing behind them, all on their own.
“Well find an interest because as of now, you’re dating. End of discussion.” Leo snapped, slamming into his fist onto the table to emphasis his point.
“For now your mission is to gather information, the more you know the better. Keep your ears to the ground and do your best to be subtle. I don’t care what house they’re in you hear something you think we need to know make a mental note and keep an ear out for more, understood?” Julian ordered crossing his arms as he gazed at them seriously.
Padfoot chuckled, “Maybe not, but I know you still like Leo. And I’m the only one who knows the Potter’s stubborn streak and Leo’s reactions well enough to help you pull his head out of his ass.”
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
"Wow so you all found out you weren't who you thought you were too?" Lyra asked shocked, this was too weird, what sort of dysfunctional Family did she come from?
“I’m still interested yes, but I’ve stopped chasing him,” Draco sighed, twirling the spoon in his morning tea.
“A few days then… Julian,” Fred murmured, feeling a bit guilty as he gestured for the younger boy to leave. He and George had a lot to figure out. And Molly and Arthur had a lot to answer for. He was how ever sure of one thing… they would all regret hiding the truth, he was sure Julian and his friends would see to that. Whether Fred and George aided in their quest was yet to be seen.
“Yeah, but he’s more like an older brother,” Draco sighed, pulling Harry closer, “My best friend’s are Mikhail Koshkov and Orion Black.”
Harry smacks his chest looking affronted, “I don’t talk about him that much. But they’re my friends they’re bound to come up eventually. If anyone has a right to be jealous it’s me! You talk about Orin and Mikhail about as much as I talk about my friends!”
“You don’t think Snape told the Headmaster?” Draco asked solemnly, honestly the blonde doubted it himself. Being the man’s godson, he knew first hand just how bad Severus Snape was with Teens and Children. Draco still had a few scars from his less then reasonable outbursts over the years. To him crumbling walls wouldn’t be that high on his priority list, unless you were a Potion or a Potions Master you didn’t even make the list.
“Stay away from him,” Leo hissed shoving the boy back against the wall and storming away down the hall. Muttering curses under his breath.
Every muscle in Harry’s body locked up for a moment before his back arched off the bed and he came with a hoarse cry of Draco’s name. That sight. Seeing Harry’s brows furrow and jaw fall slack, his whole body tensing and trembling with pleasure as he painted his chest white was enough to send Draco careening over the edge after him.
Even after being together for a few years, seeing Draco completely relaxed was a rare sight that Harry reveled in every chance he got. Shifting as to not jostle the bed much Harry reached up and moved strands of blonde hair out of Draco's peaceful face. Harry couldn’t help but think how beautiful he looked, damn near angelic with the rays of the morning sun. A canvas of pale skin painted with scars and sins of the past, but breathtaking all the same.
Harry let out a whine he rarely let Draco hear as he sat back his heels, adding another finger. Trying to feel more full, to feel it deeper. It was at this whine that Draco finally spoke, his voice deep and raspy, almost sounding restrained, “you’re starting to look frustrated Harry.”
Tangling his fingers in Draco’s hair Harry gripped the locks tightly, a little too suddenly because it startled Draco into biting down on Harry’s lip hard enough to draw blood. But the brief flash of regret and “oh my god I made him bleed” was washed away by the loud moan that Harry let out.
you are really good at that.” Draco smirked at him before it faded into an all out frown, “what’s the face for?”
At this point they were both babbling between moans. Praise and compliments never stopped falling from Draco’s lips, and all Harry was saying were various forms of “I want you to cum inside me Draco” all of which egged them both on.
This seemed to catch him off guard but Hermione eagerly cut in, “now, in general, everything in between.”
At first Draco was tentative, not even going in far enough to make it hard for Harry to breathe. So in true impatient brat fashion, Harry grabbed Draco's ass and shoved forward until his face was against a tuft of blonde curls and he was gagging around Draco’s cock. Draco tried to pull back but Harry held him firm where he was for a few seconds, before putting his hands back on Draco’s thighs, allowing him to set the pace once more.
Sitting up as well Draco chuckled, “that’s true, I wouldn’t have made the mistake of asking that poor woman if her ass was on the dessert menu and if I could have a bite.”
Standing up Malfoy pulled on a hoodie and pushed past Potter, “Touch me and the only thing that will be dragged out of here is your body.”
The moment Draco's eyebrows furrowed and he began mumbling something, Harry hollowed his cheeks and sunk down until he felt Draco's cock hitting the back of his throat, and swallowed. Draco choked on a breath as his back arched off the bed with a wanton moan.
fucking hot. So, I don't know. It's something I'd be open to trying sometime, if you want to of course."
Because of everything Draco had told him, Harry was more understanding as to why he couldn’t attend the Battle of Hogwarts memorial get-together and dinner. And that night when Harry went alone, and people asked where Draco was, Harry was glad not to lie. He had felt so guilty before when he would lie to his friends about Draco’s work, but now he was
so good, so good for me,” Harry let out a high pitched noise before moaning Draco’s name like a prayer, “you take me so well. Like you were made for me, just for me. Fuck Harry.”
wrong he was. Harry soon came to the conclusion that McGonagall had gone completely insane. That woman must be batshit crazy if she thinks that the sleeping arrangements she set up wouldn’t end in bloodshed.
Potter rested his forehead on Malfoy’s, panting slightly, and not looking away as he said, “I would let him fuck me right here if he asked.”
Harry’s breath hitched at the words, his eyes scanning Draco’s face in search of any sign of deceit or teasing humor, an equally beautiful smile appeared on his face as he looked up at Draco, “not as beautiful as you though.”
Grimmauld Place was, while not in shambles anymore, almost as dark and dingy as Harry had remembered. Part of him was saddened at the state of the house, but after the war, he could barely step foot inside let alone actually work to maintain the house. Yes, Kreacher did come here on occasion to clean, more than he ever had before Harry might add, but it just wasn’t all that it could be. This was home of the noble house of black and had been for generations, and yet it didn’t look it in the slightest.
Harry was half delirious, but he felt when Draco’s movements started to falter and something akin to panic washed over him, “I- wait,” a particularly hard thrust had Harry stumbling over his words, “Draco,
If Harry hadn’t been on his stomach on his bed pushing a finger into his ass, slowly working himself open, he would have heard Draco come home. If he hadn’t been moaning into the pillows he would have also heard the choked noise Draco let out at seeing Harry face down ass up in their bed.
“Position yourself like you were before,” Harry took a shaky breath as he rolled back onto his stomach and rose to his knees, keeping his eyes trained on the headboard he spread his legs, presenting himself to the man behind him, “fuck, you look perfect.”
“I’m sure I want this, want you.” A light blush painted Harry’s cheeks as he continued, “and as long as you treat me to a nice dinner after this, I’ll have no regrets.”
Draco had a dark glint in his eyes as he responded, “maybe I could really tie you down and make you cum so many times you’ll be begging me to stop. It’s bound to happen again like that.”
Pulling out his lists Harry passed them to Draco as he explained, “I was serious when I said I was going to have a whole damn binder full of things we’re gonna do once you’re certified, and that we were checking everything off our bucket lists, no matter how crazy or mundane they are.”
After throwing a pair of boxers on, and helping Harry into some pajama pants, Draco fell into bed beside him. In no time at all Harry was curled up against him like a koala and had fallen fast asleep, leaving Draco to run his fingers through those unruly locks until unconsciousness overtook him.
One of Draco's hands pushed Harry’s hair back, allowing him a clear view of Harry; the flush painting his cheeks, the drool dripping down his chin, the tears rolling down his cheeks. Draco saw it all, “you look, fuck- Harry you’re perfect, so good. So good at this, so fucking-” Draco cut off with another pitched moan as his hips bucked up into Harry’s mouth, “so good for me.”
” Harry was cut off yet again with a long moan, his next words coming out nearly intelligble to his own ears, “please Draco, I want you inside me.”
While Draco was working to get his breathing normal again, Harry simply watched him, after all there’s not much he could do whilst bound. And Harry couldn’t help but think how
Lightly hitting Draco's shoulder Harry sat up, “hey! I didn’t know what I was saying okay, you're the one who's good with languages, not me.”
at her. Or,” Granger paused with a conflicted look on her face, “or you and Harry together because I'd sell my soul to the devil to see you two get it on.”
“You’re going to keep touching yourself,” using wandless magic Draco ripped the blankets away from Harry, leaving him totally exposed to those critical eyes, “and I’m going to watch.”
Harry’s eyes rolled to the back of his head as he groaned and gagged around Draco’s cock, not waiting a moment his hand started flying over his own cock, desperately working himself to yet another orgasm.
“Well then, we have a long day ahead of us,” chuckling darkly Draco pulled at the unruly strands in his grasp, “Potter.”
With sluggish movements Draco retrieved his and Harry’s underwear, not bothering with the pants, so they could put them on and get under the blankets of Draco’s bed. The magic mattress a true godsend for their sore and tired bodies.
It was during the dinner that night that Harry was reminded of the actual bucket lists he and Draco had made for an assignment one night when they were both delirious with sleep deprivation and alcohol. And the next morning when Draco went to work, that was the first thing Harry went in search of.
The second Draco got up Harry forgave the jab and whined, nearly falling off the bed as he tried to grab his arm to pull him back, “come back.”
That same smooth skin blushed pink, glistening with a sheen of sweat. That blonde hair sticking to his damp forehead, going in every direction from being pulled and grabbed and brushed through. That voice hoarse from moaning and begging, from crying out Harry’s name.
Potter took the bottle from Malfoy and finished it off before dropping it to the floor and turning to face Malfoy, both of whom looked rather scared to do this. It's not everyday that you do seven minutes in heaven with your childhood rival afterall. Not to mention the fact that they were making out in front of a group of people, of their
Lightly kicking Harry in the shin Draco sat back up, throwing a noodle directly at Harry’s face, “shut up.”
Potter looked at him wide eyed and whispered for only them to hear, “oh my god, you liked that didn’t you? That’s-” he paused and let out a shaky breath “that has no right to be so hot.”
As soon as Harry said those words it was like a switch flipped in Draco. The blonde leaned down and pressed their lips together in a passionate kiss. It was almost nothing like before. Before there had been uncertain nerves of not knowing what the other truly wanted, but now. Now Harry didn’t hold back the moan he let out when Draco’s tongue slipped into his mouth, teasing and brushing against his own.
“What are you doing awake at this hour?” Harry would have been more than happy to talk to Draco about everything he had been doing, if his stomach hadn’t roared like a starved lion at the smell of Chinese food, “Harry, don’t tell me you didn’t eat dinner.”
For a moment everything seemed to still as he turned bright red and covered his face with his hands, “Sorry…”
Using a small lubricating charm Harry reached back to slowly sink a finger inside himself, a low moan escaping him at the intrusion. But having already prepped himself some only a few minutes ago, Harry could easily add another finger. Only this time he wasn’t alone. This time he was being watched. And he wanted to give something worth watching.
Nipping at Harry’s ear Draco whispered, “what if I feel like riding you until the only thing you know is my name and how it feels to have your cock in my ass?”
Harry glared at the blonde, giving him a once over and seeing the only marks from their activities on his pale body were the crescent marks on his chest. Which Harry thought just simply wouldn’t do.
Draco paused once he was fully inside Harry which, even though he had begged for this, Harry silently thanked him for. It had been a hot minute since he had something that large in his ass, but holy hell he loved it. He was so
So in between picking places to travel to, and finding other fun activities for them to do, Harry became reacquainted with his right hand. After years of pleasuring himself, and all the exploration of his body he did with Draco, Harry knew how to get himself off almost as good as Draco did. It wasn’t nearly as satisfying, but it was still damn good. Each time he got the urge, he just reminded himself of how long it would be until Draco would be certified, and when he could feel that slim body on his.
This is my first time really trying my hand at writing smut for other people to read so I'm not sure how well that turned out. Feel free to leave tips or whatever in the comments.
With already having cum three times it took less than a minute before Harry was whining around Draco's cock and squeezing his thigh to let him know he was close to cumming. The smile on Draco’s face as he realized what Harry was doing was downright sadistic, “oh, what a good boy you are,” his words cut off with a low groan as Harry moaned wantonly around his cock, “waiting for me to give you permission to cum.”
“You’re taking-”Harry crooked his finger in a very familiar fashion to brush against that spot that made his toes curl, a long moan escaping him as Draco followed his action, “too long.”
For the first time in a long time Malfoy was speechless. He had no idea what to say. He could have just lied immediately and said no, but that brief pause showed his hesitation, and that was an answer in itself.
Harry hissed as Draco gently pressed at one of the numerous marks that painted his neck, “I wonder whose fault that is.”
Preparing to apparate, since McGonagall somehow made it so they could apparate in their new rooms, Harry smirked, “You'll see.”
For all the bravado Malfoy had been showing these past five or so minutes, even with everything that both he and Potter had said, there was still uncertainty on his face as he asked, “do you want to head up to our room?”
Draco put his fork down and rifled through more of the papers, his face growing confused yet bright as he looked through everything laid out in front of them, “what is all this?”
It was Malfoy’s turn to let out a low noise when Harry bucked his hips up, allowing both of them to feel just how hard the other was. At this, Potter opened his eyes and gazed up at Malfoy with a look that set his blood on fire. They were both only vaguely aware of the sudden chatter that erupted in the room as they looked at one another, at least until a voice yelled that it wasn’t right to
Harry stared at Draco, his mouth going dry as he realized this wasn’t a teasing joke. Draco actually wanted to watch him touch himself. This wasn’t something they had ever done before, and he knew Draco would understand if he refused, but… the idea of Draco doing nothing to him, to just
With hips raised and cock hanging between his spread thighs, hard and dripping with precum, Harry pushed a finger in beside the other. He let his mouth fall open with a low moan as a rush of burning desire shot through his veins, not caring how he would soon be drooling onto the sheets.
warmed his blood more than the alcohol flowing through his veins did. It was as he spoke that Harry became acutely aware of Draco's ankles pressed against his under the table, and the way his fingers were tracing circles over his hand in an almost mindless fashion.
When the pair stood up they both swayed slightly as the world tiled, until they felt the cold heat of a sobering charm wash over them. Harry was silently grateful that Hermione was the one who had performed the charm, because when she did it it didn’t feel like a bucket of ice water was dumped over your head, killing whatever warm buzz you were feeling. It just felt like getting a breath of fresh air on a crisp autumn day. If anyone else had done the charm it would have most likely smothered the hot need coursing through Harry and Draco’s veins, making the atmosphere more awkward than, well, horny.
Malfoy didn’t get off Potter as he looked over at Pansy, who was fanning herself by the way, and said in a slightly raspy voice that he almost didn't recognize, “is that good enough?”
Harry felt more than heard Draco cast the spell, his magic washing over his tired body like a comforting breeze, "thank you."
Bringing his hands up Draco's thighs Harry hummed at the way that smooth skin and damn near silky hair felt under his palms. Harry often thought that the legs on this man should be illegal. They had no right to be so attractive and Harry has told Draco as much on several occasions. How he wished he could spend hours here pouring over Draco’s body. He loved the times when Draco allowed Harry to worship every inch of his body, and voice all the thoughts he had… Harry reached down to adjust himself at the mere thought.
Harry thought that maybe all the eight years living together could be fun. They’d stay up all night being idiots with each other and maybe sneak out every once in a while. How so
Harry’s mind was lost in his masturbation haze as changed to rolling his hips against the toy, doing something he had not only never told Draco he liked but actually had lied about to him before. He dropped his head back and slowly dragged his free hand up his body, overlooking his weeping cock, and toyed with his nipples briefly, before bringing his hand higher. He rested it just under his jaw for a moment, his breath catching at the feeling of his racing pulse beneath his fingers, and all he heard was a shocked curse as he pressed down.
This mix; Draco’s eyes on him, the intense vibrations against his prostate, and the euphoria from the rush of blood and endorphins at releasing his throat, caused his body to seize up before he let out a broken cry and came all over his chest and bed.
Harry threw his head back with a loud moan when Draco began jerking his cock in time with his movements, and soon his moans started pitching higher. He was chanting Draco’s name like a prayer to god before his whole body locked up for a second, then shook violently as he came with a hoarse cry of Draco's name.
“Considering I can feel my cum leaking out of you, I can’t say that I did.” Harry turned a brilliant red as he became acutely aware of the feeling of Draco’s cum slowly leaking out of him, “I only asked cause that last one was… intense doesn’t seem like a strong enough word.”
Draco loosened his grip on Harry’s curls so he could pull off and take some very needed gulps of air. Only to pull him into a crushing kiss a moment later, a muffled noise escaping him as he tasted himself on Harry’s tongue.
Draco’s voice suddenly cracked and he arched off the mattress, “fuck- I’m gonna-” his head dropped back, Harry’s name falling from his mouth in a pitched whisper, before he let out the most beautiful moan Harry had ever heard and came. It was as he felt Draco’s cum filling him up that the pressure in Harry’s stomach exploded and a wave of burning pleasure shot through him, his magic making the ground beneath them shake almost as much as he was as he lost control and fell forward.
Blowing on the wet trails of saliva, Harry shivered as Draco moved back to his mouth, pulling violently at his restraints when Draco hovered just out of his reach, “oh what’s this, do you want to touch me,
His arm trembled as he lifted himself off the now silent toy. Narrowly avoiding falling onto the floor as he fell forward with an exhausted huff. His whole body shaking with aftershocks as he forced himself to look up at Draco, who looked nearly as wrecked as Harry felt.
you insinuate that Malfoy would do anything to me without my consent. He might be a right foul git sometimes, no offense, but he would never do something like that and frankly, I’m appalled that you think he would.”
Harry’s mind began drifting to all the possibilities on what he and Draco could do, his cock giving a half hearted twitch just thinking about it. That twitch didn’t get past Draco either, “merlin Harry, I have never known of someone with the stamina you seem to possess. Maybe we could make it a whole scientific study that we could publish in the prophet,
Harry moaned around Draco’s cock at the words. And Draco noticed, like he had before. Only this time it wasn’t praise falling from his lips. It was almost the complete opposite this time, and Harry loved it. He loved being called a slut or cheap whore just as much as he loved being called a good boy and that he was perfect.
He knew what was inside the box before he even opened the flap, he was the one who had labeled the damn thing, but he opened and dumped the contents out nonetheless. For a minute all he could do was stare. Stare at the colorful pairs of mismatched and disproportionately sized socks; stare at the too-bright box of prototype puking pastilles; stare at the remnants of a magic switchblade that had been so badly damaged on that fateful night in the department of mysteries. When his gaze landed on the fading words of a map that no longer hummed with magic Harry whispered a packing charm and rushed out of the room, unshed tears burning his eyes as he stumbled out onto the street.
Harry felt the slight blush cover his cheeks at Draco's words, confessions like this really were far and few between, and Harry wasn’t used to it. It was almost weird to hear Draco say those things, but fuck if he didn’t love it. It was things like this that made them who they were and Harry wouldn’t change it for the world.
Nervously glancing around the room, silver eyes locked with sparkling green for a moment, before he sighed and complied, “fine.”
Malfoy wasn’t the only one looking at Weasley with a surprised and confused expression, “You don't want me to do that.”
Harry ran his hands down the smooth expanse of his boyfriend's back, giving his plump ass a good squeeze before moving to grasp their erections in his hand. Draco's hips stuttered with a loud moan when Harry brushed his finger along the tip of his weeping cock, spreading precum up and down the shaft, making them slick as he started to jerk them both in earnest.
Finally looking up Harry was both disappointed and pleased to find Draco already at half-mast. Disappointed because Harry loved the way it felt to take Draco’s cock into his mouth when it was totally soft and feel it fill out and get hard against his tongue. But he was also pleased that his small touches got Draco going like this.
That was all the warning Harry got before Draco gripped his hair and tugged him flush against his pelvis, cumming down Harry’s throat with one of the most beautiful moans he had ever heard from the blonde. The taste of Draco and the feeling of him spilling into Harry’s mouth brought him to climax, his entire body shaking as his orgasm washed over him.
Burying his face in his hands in embarrassment Harry bemoaned, “I thought I had a few hours before you’d be back.”
Draco helped Harry sluggishly maneuver himself under the crisp sheets before crawling in with him, pulling Harry against his chest a beat later. Who then shifted back against Draco a moment later with a content sigh.
Nuzzling into Draco's shoulder Harry mumbled, “we should probably let them know we didn’t kill each other.”
Draco hummed and pulled Harry against his chest, “after you lost control of your magic during that third orgasm, those drunk morons have been trying to get in here.”
he must have been feeling towards Draco when he had written this. The first ten alone were variations of licking and eating various things off Draco’s body, and the rest were vague depictions of wanting to bend Malfoy over various surfaces and fuck him senseless
After he finished reassuring Draco of the tap system, Harry let his jaw fall open and tongue loll out in invitation. Putting one hand next to Harry’s head, Draco used his other to push Harry’s hair back, before slowly pushing his cock into the mouth that had once thrown insults at him.
After they began kissing Malfoy couldn’t help but think that if he had known Potter was this good of a kisser, then he would've done this years ago. It was just “tame” kissing but wow, Malfoy wondered what other hidden talents the golden boy had.
Neville paused for a moment as his eyes wandered the crowd, hesitating on two people, “I would say that I do yeah. Okay, my turn,” pausing he looked around the room until his eyes landed on Pansy, “Pansy, truth or dare?”
Harry winced at the soreness in his throat as he responded embarrassingly hoarse, “you know you are too Malfoy, don’t deny it.”
“Harry,” tilting his head up from where it had been resting against Draco’s chest, Harry looked up at the blonde “do you want to go out for dinner?”
For a few minutes all Harry could do was sit there and tremble in Draco's arms. It was only when he felt Draco slip out of him that Harry felt any sense of reality return to him once again, “wow. That- wow.”
Draco suddenly grabbed Harry’s wrists and pinned them above his head, soft silk wrapping around his wrists and binding him to the headboard.
Luna sitting in his lap; Theodore also made out with Blaise, and virtually everyone was shirtless. It was really turning into the kind of party Malfoy loved.
Humming lowly Harry sloppily kissed Draco's neck, harshly sucking on his pulse point, heat rushing his veins once more as he felt it jump beneath his lips. Sucking another mark just above Draco's collarbone, Harry’s voice was hoarse as responded, “mornin.”
Harry shivered as he felt the older boys magic wash over them and their remaining clothes vanished, raspy moans escaping the pair as their bare cocks came into contact.
Soon the shock of Granger's confession wore off and Malfoy was back to his drinking and had tuned out pretty much everything that everyone was saying, which wasn’t all that much. No huge secrets were revealed and no super dirty thoughts were shared. Although, as time pased and more alcohol was consumed, the dares were finally getting more scandalous with each turn; Granger and Pansy had a hardcore make out session (which left Weasley looking shell shocked), Seamus gave Dean a lapdance, Longbottom had made out with Blaise
Gripping the hair on the back of Draco's head Harry pulled him down and attached his lips to the pale column of Draco's throat, sucking until he knew there would be a dark bruise for everyone to see. But he didn’t stop there. Harry covered one side of Draco's neck in marks before shimmying down the bed, leaving a trail of marks down his chest. A smug smirk crossing his face after he left a near purple mark just by Draco’s hip, and saw the state of Draco’s cock, “you were saying about my stamina?”
Harry turned to face Draco, before lubing up the toy and placing the base against the bed, magic keeping it in place as he let himself sink down onto it. Not even trying to quiet the loud moan he let out as the toy got deeper and stretched him more than his fingers ever could. Staying on his knees Harry leaned back to grab an ankle to better balance himself and began to shallowly ride the toy, no longer able to keep his eyes focused on Draco.
After a few seconds Harry was coming back to his senses, a jolt of concern passing through him when he saw Draco sitting up and coughing, “oh shit, are you okay?”
The last chapter was smut, so I think it's only fair this next one has some light hurt/comfort angst don't you?
“Do you-” swallowing the lump in his throat Harry asked, “should I do exactly what I was doing before?”
Harry swallowed the food in his mouth before speaking, “okay, I’ll admit things got away from me a bit.”
Shaking his head Draco turned one of the papers that covered the table towards himself and raised a brow, “394 easy steps to bake a spicy six-tier birthday cake.”
Draco looked at that moment. His face was flushed and there was cum running down his chin… it was enough to get Harry’s blood thrumming again.
The past few weeks had been tolerable with everyone living in one large shared space as they finished their new dorm. Except McGonagall seemed to have this delusion that she can somehow make all of them into people who will braid each other's hair and make friendship bracelets; not threaten to rip one anothers spine out and choke them with it. But hey, Harry thought that if Malfoy and he didn't kill each other in the first week then color him impressed.
Laughing Harry took the noodle and obnoxiously slurped it into his mouth, laughing as he said, “I love you too.”
From then on it turned into more of Harry rambling that he should let himself do the things that made him happy, and not just do the things that people expected him to do. It only took him five years, but he’s finally listening to his own advice. Harry was finally ready to start living his life for
Draco collapsed on Harry’s chest, not caring that they were both covered in a thin sheen of sweat, or that he was laying in a puddle of their mixed cum.
Harry pushed the image of stripping down wallpaper and ripping up the floorboards out of his mind and headed to one of the bedrooms he used for storage, having been too scared to open the door to the attic with the eerie sounds of whispering he heard behind it. Harry might have battled numerous dark wizards and witches in his time but that didn’t mean he lacked all common sense.
Draco just chuckled at Harry’s “misfortune” as he got up to get ready for bed. Harry found himself close to drifting off as he listened to Draco move around the room, not caring that he was lying in a puddle of drying cum, or that the sweat sticking to his skin was rapidly cooling. He felt relaxed in a way he hadn't in weeks.
Once he was no longer coughing Draco glared at Harry, “a little warning would have been nice Potter.”
He kept this pace up. Rolling his hips hard and fast enough that the toy roughly dragged against his prostate with every jerk of his body. Tightening and releasing the grip on his neck. This was nothing like the other times he touched himself. It felt like small zaps of magic were crawling over his skin with every movement, making that delicious heat pool in his stomach faster than it ever had when he was alone.
Harry felt Draco’s hands pause before they continued slowly moving up and down Harry’s back, “wow indeed.”
Running his fingers up those glorious thighs Draco leaned forward and slowly dragged his tongue along the underside of Harry’s cock, his own cock twitching at the moan the ravenette let out. Taking Harry’s cock in his hand Draco jerked it a few times before leaning in again and swirling his tongue around the head, lapping up the beads of precum that leaked out.
Harry continued his path downward, his own breath catching as his lips met the soft hair at the start of Draco's treasure trail just beneath his navel. Which, similar to Draco's scars, was another thing Harry loved and thought was ridiculously sexy, and something Draco was never all that confident about.
Harry shuddered at the praise, his cock now rapidly hardening between his thighs once more, “turn a little so I can see your profile, not too much.” Harry shifted so he could see Draco out of the corner of his eye, the smirk on his face sending a rush of heat through his body, “begin.”
“You can cum, if-” Harry’s lungs were on fire and his eyes were burning with unshed tears as he looked up at Draco, who was frantically thrusting into Harry’s mouth, “if you swallow every drop.”
Luna simply shrugged and leaned over to peck Granger on the lips. Which Malfoy didn't care much for, so he was soon zoning out whilst drinking out of the bottle of firewhiskey he held in his hands.
And he loved those moments. The moments when Draco fell into bed next to him, mumbling hello and goodnight into his neck. The moments when Harry would still be in the living area when Draco would stumble in nearly dead on his feet, all but throwing himself onto the nearest surface which in turn had Harry carrying him to bed. He even loved the moments when he helped Draco go through his nightly routine because the blonde was too exhausted to do it all by himself.
Pushing himself up slightly Harry rose up to his hand, desperately chasing that glorious pressure his fingers gave him. His head was swimming from the touch and eyes on him, but- fuck it wasn’t
In no time at all Draco had pushed Harry onto his back, Draco couldn’t help but stare at the way his disastrous raven hair framed his head on the pillow like a beautifully sinful halo, his voice a hush whisper as he said as much, “you’re beautiful.”
in the feeling of hot breath against his ear, of the painful yanks on his hair, of the rough drag of hips against his cock.
Turning to face Harry Draco laughed, nothing but teasing humor in his voice as he said, “you really are a kinky fuck Potter.”
Not giving anyone time to comment on the thin lines that covered his torso Malfoy grinned, “Granger, truth or dare?”
, or how he thinks they’re beautiful, but he doesn’t stop Harry from worshipping them like they are his religion and Draco’s body is his temple. And even though Draco has never outright said it, Harry is convinced that sometimes Draco enjoys the special attention he pays to his scars.
Pulling painfully at those raven locks Draco said in a tone that left no room for argument, “I want you to touch yourself, I want you to get off while I use you like a good fuck toy.”
After building up a rhythm, moaning at each drag of the toy against his prostate, Harry flicked the wrist of his free hand. Nearly falling over a second later when a low hum filled the quiet between his moans and vibrations wracked his body. He was moving and moaning with a fervor that was rare even when he was with Draco.
Placing kisses down Harry’s neck Draco brought his lips to one of the rosy buds on his chest, swirling his tongue around the sensitive skin before sucking softly. His labored breathing turned into an outright moan when Draco took it between his teeth and pulled away. And all Harry could do was watch as Draco did the same to the other side, a free hand toying with his abused nipple.
For the next two weeks as Draco worked to get certified Harry did his own research on places to go and things to do, and he called Hermione to get some ideas from what she and Ron had been up to. It was fun, both to find these things himself and to finally have a proper catch-up with one of his oldest friends and find out what she had been up to traversing the globe.
Plus they were all getting very drunk; they had already gone through about half of the alcohol Potter had bought earlier. Although he refused to admit it, Malfoy was actually having a pretty good time, until he nearly choked to death on his drink when he heard what Pansy and Hermione dared both him and Potter to do.
Adjusting how he was sitting, Malfoy just sat there and waited for Potter to finish bitching to Granger about how he didn't want to do this. And by the looks on the girls faces, Malfoy knew damn well that if they didn't do the dare soon, then they were going to change it to something much worse. The strangest thing about all this to Malfoy wasn't even what they would be doing, it was that he didn't have a problem with doing it. Hell, he kinda wanted to do it. Well Potter isn't exactly someone Malfoy would normally go for, that boy had grown in all the right places since they were children.
“As long as you promise not to try and speak Italian, I don’t think either of us wants you to offend our server… again.”
“Yeah,” putting his hands on Draco's thighs Harry continued, “I’ll hit your leg… three times, if I need you to back off, so if I gag or choke or whatever don’t freak out and pull away. I’m okay with that. I want to do this for you.”
Along with planning his and Draco’s getaway, Harry let himself go out to meet up with his friends more, now without feeling guilty about enjoying himself or having to lie yet again for Draco. Not only that, but Harry more often than not found himself working into the early morning hours in hopes that he could catch a few minutes with Draco before they went to sleep.
Taking a swig of whatever Pansy was drinking she rolled her eyes with a nod, “Weak question lover boy, Luna, truth or dare?”
With how slow he was working him open, it was clear to Harry that Draco was holding himself back for the sake of not hurting him, but dammit Harry wanted a little pain with his pleasure and he wanted to please Draco even more. Bringing his hand to his mouth Harry coated his fingers in spit before he summoned all his Gryffindor courage and reached around, sinking a slick into himself alongside Draco's. Harry’s lust addled brain not registering the moan Draco let out at seeing him finger himself with him.
As Draco was walking over to the dresser he heard Harry tiredly mumble something about how great his ass was, and he couldn’t help but smile over his shoulder at his drowsy boyfriend.
“So many things I could ask,” Smirking Malfoy sat back down, “Like if Weasley can last more than twenty seconds when you're getting down and dirty, or what your darkest secrets are… how about this. If you could have sex with someone in this group, excluding Weasley, who would they be and why?”
Placing his hands on Draco’s scared chest Harry slowly lifted himself until only the tip of Draco’s cock was inside him, before dropping back down. And just like that, he began riding him with the same amount of fervor he had when he was on a broom chasing the snitch.
Malfoy didn’t know how, but it seemed like Potter was thinking the same thing as him. One second they were just sitting across from each other while kissing, then the next Potter was on his back with Malfoy laying between his legs and his tongue in his mouth.
Harry was moaning with every lick of Draco's tongue, his head falling back when Draco finally took him in his mouth. He wanted to watch that mess of blonde hair move up and down on his cock, but he couldn’t focus long enough to keep his eyes trained on him. The pleasure he was in was overwhelming him in a way it never had before. He was so lost in a lust filled haze that he didn’t notice his orgasm building until he was cumming down Draco’s throat with a guttural moan.
Resting his head in his palm Harry slowly trailed his fingers down Draco's face and neck, gently brushing his fingertips along Draco's collarbone before pausing. Idly grazing over the raised silver line of a scar as he gazed at the rest of Draco's bare chest. Harry remembered the first time Draco allowed his shirt to be taken off, and the overwhelming guilt he had felt when Draco admitted that yes they were scars from what happened in sixth year and that yes, he thought they made him look disgusting. Harry spent hours that night tracing every inch of Draco's skin with his tongue and touch, whispering praises and reassurances as he mapped his body out like a new world explorer. Running his tongue and fingers along those silver scars has been one of Harry’s favorite things to do since then, and will most likely remain so until the end of time.
Without taking his lips away from Draco's neck Harry summoned his wand, performing a quick cleaning charm on the mess in his boxers, before casting the tempus charm, “early enough that we have time for you to fuck me into the mattress and then get a few more hours of sleep.”
Draco laughed as he stood up, pulling Harry to his feet as well, “we could always order in and go out for drinks if you want, I think it’d be good for us to go out somewhere, even if for a bit.”
Crooking his fingers to just barely reach that small bundle of nerves Harry rocked back onto his fingers, moaning Draco's name like a raunchy pornstar. At this action, any resistance or tension Harry had been feeling about doing this in front of Draco melted away and he just let himself
Following the silver line, Harry ran his fingers up and down Draco's skin, simply basking in his boyfriend’s beauty. At least, until he scratched over rosy nipples and heard the slight hitch in Draco's breath. Feeling Draco's chest skip under his touch allowed Harry’s focus to switch to something he only recently realized he missed dearly, desire.
Draco leaned away to run his hands down Harry’s bare chest, making his breath hitch with every touch, Harry had no idea that being touched so little could affect him so much, “what’re you doing?”
“Oh, yeah uh, it was kind of terrifying if I’m being honest, only because that’s never happened to me before. It’s definitely something I wanna try and do again though cause it was fucking
There was one almost unfortunate drawback Harry was dealing with because of all the soft moments and brief touches. The nights when Draco came to bed and curled up against him like a house cat trying to become one with his warmth, or when Harry would blearily wake in the morning and Draco would hush him back to sleep. Those times Harry would find himself zoning out throughout the day as he tried to work, thinking about nothing more than Draco in bed with him. His smooth skin washed out in the morning light or illuminated by pale rays of the moon. His blonde locks tousled from sleep, gently framing his face as he slept. His voice groggy and crackling from waking up.
“It's the start of the weekend and I'm bored out of my fucking mind because I can't sleep. So I'm going out to get something that’s going to help change all that.”
Leaning down Harry placed brief kisses on Draco's neck, wishing for a moment he could mark Draco's neck to show the world he was his, but that would wake him up and Harry didn’t want that just yet. He trailed kisses lower, pausing to gently suck on his partner’s rosy nipples, loving the small noises Draco was making, and the little twitches he was doing as a result of Harry's ministrations.
“Three times,” using one hand at a time Harry tapped each of Draco’s legs three times, “just like that.”
Malfoy knew that Potter thought that this would be fun, but with all of these Gryffindor goody two shoes it was dull as hell. It was kind of like going to a rock festival only to learn that it was for actual geological specimens and not fantastic music. Though it wasn't that surprising Malfoy mused, perfect little Potter with his perfect little posse. Oh how the Slytherin would love to show them the ways of Draco Malfoy…
The old door swung open with a loud squeak as Harry entered the bedroom. It was just as he left it; labeled boxes covering the bare framed bed, piles of miscellaneous junk strewn across the dark oak floors. Several times when Harry had been looking through his things he found himself distracted by memories still too painful for him to reminisce about. One box in particular forced him to leave Grimmauld Place altogether for a while.
“Hang on, you said he doesn't,” Luna got this very odd expression on her face as she looked at the flustered boys, “Does that mean that you do?”
Harry fell back onto the sheets, a broken moan escaping him from the feeling of Draco falling between his legs, his cock rapidly hardening with each passing second. The blonde began kissing and sucking down Harry’s neck, groaning against his skin as Harry began frantically pulling at his shirt, and pushing his hips up against his in search of glorious friction.
His mouth dropped open with a muffled noise as a dull roar filled his ears. Harry loved the feeling of his mind lulling into grey noise and the pressure that slowly built up in the back of his head. He loved the moment just before he released his grasp; the burning pressure in his chest and head. But nothing compared to the
Even with his whole body shaking, and the oversensitivity bordering painful at this point, Harry didn’t stop moving. Looking directly into Draco’s eyes Harry clenched and rolled his hips, his own nails digging into Draco’s chest at the drag of cock against his prostate. Forcing himself to ignore the odd pressure in the pit of his stomach as he kept moving.
Those words the only warning he got before Draco was cumming down his throat with a low groan. Harry nearly panicked as the salty fluid filled his mouth and he struggled to both breathe and swallow, but Draco pulled back almost fully, giving Harry what he needed to swallow around his cock. No sooner had the words “good boy” left Draco’s mouth, was Harry cumming for the fourth time.
Malfoy dropped his head with a frustrated groan, “there's no point Pans, it's not like you or Granger would be watching us.”
Draco looked at Harry with something akin to awe as he answered, “that was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen holy
Walking into the common room the blonde headed straight towards the numerous bottles of who knows what and grabbed one before sitting on the sofa next to Pansy. They all ended up in a circle as Potter announced, “If you intend on drinking then you're playing truth or dare. And from what Rons told me, you’re magically bound to answer honestly or do whatever you're told to do, unless the group unanimously agrees that you don't have to do said task. So, I guess I'll go first, um… Neville, truth or dare?”
Rolling his eyes at the cheesy response Draco moved to hover over the shorter boy, “I know you defended me back there, and said some other things, but I would never want to do something you didn’t want or enjoy. So I guess- I just want to make sure you're sure about this and that you’re not going to regret it.”
Putting aside the crumpled piece of paper, Harry took out another and unfolded it, thanking the stars that after he made his bullshit one for the assignment that brought the lists about, he had actually decided to spend time to make a real bucket list. Back then, and even now, there were so many things that Harry had never done before and so many more that he wanted to do.
Draco replaced the loss of Harry’s digit with something that most definitely wasn’t a finger, making Harry all but sob into the sheets as that glorious tongue slipped into him along Draco’s sleek fingers. Any semblance of shame left Harry as he began begging Draco to fuck him, “please I want
Turning the chair to face the bed Draco leaned back into it, placing his arms on the soft fabric, “you seemed to be having a nice time while I was gone.”
Harry placed kissing over each of Draco's knuckles, "sure, but we can talk more about it later. I'm barely hanging on here Dray."
Harry didn’t even let Draco finish before he removed his fingers and reached out, a sleek black toy flying into his hand. He could hear Draco spluttering behind him at the fact that he had a sex toy, but he didn’t care. He needed something more than fingers and if it wasn’t Draco’s cock, then this would have to do.
When Draco's eyes opened a crack Harry began bobbing his head up and down in the way he knew Draco loved, and he watched as the blonde unraveled. Merlin, Harry could never get enough of the unrestrained moans and babble that fell from Draco's lips in moments like this.
With slightly shaky arms Harry pushed himself back to look at Draco with an incredulous expression, “did you miss the multiple orgasms?”
When Harry settled down at the kitchen table he nearly spat out the coffee he was still nursing as he started reading one of the bucket lists
Harry didn’t even know he wasn’t alone until more lights flickered on, causing him to let out a very undignified yelp and flip over, rushing to pull a blanket over himself as he did so. His face on fire as he looked at the man standing stock still in the doorway, “Bloody hell Draco! Why are you back already?!”
Harry silently thanked every deity out there that Draco was usually a rather heavy sleeper, giving him the chance to play uninterrupted.
It took less then five minutes until Malfoy heard Potter apparate into the common room and begin barging into bedrooms yelling at everyone to get out there. Malfoy was silently praying that Harry would just leave him alone so he wouldn't have to socialize with people, but of course his prayers were never answered.
Violently throwing the blankets off his bed, Harry got up to put on a sweatshirt and began searching through his trunk to find some money, “Potter what the hell are you doing?”
The Weasley twins didn’t look particularly surprised by their arrival and had proceeded to inform them of everything they had learned. After all despite the glaring differences, not only in age but personalities as well, they were all brothers and they stuck together. Ginny, Ginny had made herself the outsider in their little circle, constantly using her gender and status as the ‘baby’ to turn their parents in their favor. While most families seemed to subtly favor one child over the other, their parents would admit whole heartedly that as the only girl they ‘might’ spoil Ginny a bit more than their boys. Despite this, it had always been quite apparent that after Percy, their parents had become far harsher with their younger brothers and had closed ranks in the hopes of shielding the three boys from a majority of their parents wrath. The twins however could apparently sense the disapproval and chose the more obvious road of rebellion, Pranks.
Harry sighed, rubbing the back of his neck tiredly, "He likes little boys and his eyes twinkle, that just screams pedo right there. Enough said."
Five students filed into the compartment taking seats around them, Draco raised an amused brow as the all eyed him warily, so he’d have to start then.
“With me,” He seethed eyes so dark with fury Theo would almost call them black. Carina had truly done it this time, he just hoped Leo wasn’t too hard on her for it she was very fragile when it came to family after all.
“I’ll relax when you put your wand away,” Draco snapped, eyeing the arm Zabini had settled casually under the table.
“That’s what you basically just said,” Draco drawled dropping his chin in his hand and raising a bored brow at them.
Blaise finally stopped in front of an oddly smooth patch of wall, knocking pointedly twice so Draco would understand, the Italian waited until the wall bubbled slightly before appearing to melt. Draco flinched slightly as a genderless figure seemed to stretch out of the wall, mouth gapping wide as it lurched toward them before rasping out a scratchy “Password?”
Carina clung to Theo’s arm anxiously, trying to fight the tears being ignored brought on. It reminded her of her time at the Granger’s, she wouldn’t say anything though, deciding she would take the punishment she deserved.
Blaise blinked, glancing back at Adrian, before looking back at Draco frowning uncertainly, “What, no.”
Draco shot him a bland look rubbing his cold hands together. “It’s December Potter, and snowing, maybe you could have warned me about our little date, before dragging me out into the snow?”
Harry rolled his eyes sighing heavily before giving Draco a hard look. Studying the boys face, he had to look again. Harry took a calculated step forward eyes never leaving the blondes face. Draco cleared his throat and looked away shoving his hands in his pockets. Harry blinked in shock and tried to catch the blonde’s eyes.
Chuckie shrugged helplessly, before eyeing Draco, “So you’re him, huh? You’re the bloke who caught Harry’s attention.”
“I’m sorry, I need to think,” Leo gasped waving his hand to put it back in place only partially to cover Draco from sight. For both their benefit, he wouldn’t want Draco in trouble because of him. Leo turned and dashed down the hall toward the common room.
“Let go,” he begged breathlessly, even to his own ears it didn’t sound like he meant it, yet he held onto those two simple words like a security blanket for his pride. Leo’s too hot breath danced across the skin of his neck, Draco released a strangled cry as Leo’s teeth sank into the muscle between his neck and shoulder, not hard enough the hurt of course, but hard enough for Draco to tense arching into the hard body poised above him.
Malfoy's always got what they wanted. It was practically a rule of life. So why wouldn't Leo just give up? Dammit all.
"Come on Leo," Ron frowned looking disappointed in his friend, he understood being overprotective. He had been of Ginny before she’d started sleeping her way through his year, now he could hardly stand the sight of her. It was rumored she’d pressured most of the males in Hufflepuff into sleeping with her… he honestly wouldn’t be surprised anymore.
Draco blinked at the door in surprise did Leo seriously plant a sphinx fur blanket in Black’s room because he interrupted them? Rolling his eyes as the grown man surged to his feet and stomped over to Leo’s room to bang on the door, ‘Vowing his revenge’. It was nearly half past eleven and he’d been awake before the sun had finished rising, it had long since set, and now he was exhausted.
Carina closed her eyes as if that would change what was happening, she knew it would be a while before she spoke in an open unguarded manner with her cousin, Leo did not forgive very easily. Especially in the case of, forgiving those closest to him, when they have hurt him.
I'M SOOOOO SORRY! This chapter took ALOT longer than I thought, there are still a few parts i'm torn on, but I wanted to put something up.
Orion merely laughed, “Come on you dodgy tosser, or did you forget we have classes tomorrow and Draco and Mikhail have no idea where their dormitories are?”
“Your loyalty to your friend is intriguing,” Leo admitted he was surprised she was pushing so firmly, especially with how worried she was about losing their ‘protection’. He obviously wasn’t going to let anything happen to the girl, unless she betrayed them. But he knew desperation could make people do things you wouldn’t expect. He wouldn’t trust her completely just yet.
"Anyway! We need to tell you something important," Sirius interrupted uncomfortably, glaring at his amused friend.
Leo rolled his eyes hooking an arm around Carina’s neck ignoring the scowl on her face, “Relax Car, and quit frowning, you’ll get wrinkles.” He chuckled pressing a kiss to her brow.
Julian shook his head moving to rub comforting circles on his friends back, “She’s been yelled at enough.” He was surprised at Lyra’s quick tempered behavior. She was usually a lot more understanding and forgiving when it came to her Twin. Whatever happened earlier was affecting her judgment now, and that made him nervous.
“Back off Paul,” Harry sniped, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck. A smile flirting with the corners of his lips as Draco dragged them both to their feet, kissing his jaw again.
The Blonde squirmed for a moment before the penetrating stare became too much and he gave in, “We kissed.” He admitted quickly, hoping against hope that Blaise would let it go.
Leo released his wrists, the spell keeping them pinned in place, trailing his hands down Draco’s arms. Passed his chest, his ribs, his waist, his hips, stopping just a moment to squeeze his bum with a lustful growl, before continuing done his thighs until they hooked beneath his knees hitching them up around his waist. Draco released a whimpering cry as Leo rolled his hips roughly against his own.
Lyra frowned shifting awkwardly, she had a feeling her life would be a lot more complicated from now on, "Sorry."
“If you don’t hurry up I’ll finish myself and kick you out.” Harry commented lightly as if asking what time it was.
Draco shivered as they both sat up wincing in pain, “Ow,” the blonde pouted, rubbing the back of his head as he shoved the heavier boy off.
To be honest I had quite a few interruptions in my writing, the first being... my sewer line collapsed and my house flooded ruining my floors so I was forced from the house for a little more than two Months while they replaced the damaged pipes, and cleaned, sanatized, and replaced the floors in my house. So again, I'm sooooo sorry!
“So Prongslet, any hunky young blokes catch your eye? Have you shagged any of them yet? Which do you prefer top or bottom? I heard some blokes prefer both, do you?”
Draco hid a smile at the suspicious light in the other boy’s eyes and reached up pulling him down by the neck into a soft distracting kiss. He’d keep their dirty little secrets from him… for now.
Daphne huffed cheeks puffing up in annoyance, “Ever since you got here things haven’t made any sense in Slytherin, now you’ve got Zabini and Pucey tagging along with you like trained Crups. You’re associating with Gryffindor’s and Ravenclaw’s on an almost daily basis. I want answers Malfoy.”
Daphne hesitated before pulling out her wand, “I just mastered the Cave Inimicum charm, but my Caterwauling Charm is still stronger would you like me to show you one of them?”
"Julian then," Carina soothed, she liked it better anyway, Ronald was too… annoying for her taste. Julian fit her strategic friend quite nicely.
Leo sat up, abs flexing temptingly, as he reach up pulling what looked like a thin metal headband from his head the black strings hanging from it. He fiddled with the weird muggle contraption in his lap before turning to glare at Lyra.
“There are other more legitimate reasons as well, but I’d rather talk about those later.” Harry pleaded, no need to get into his first few ‘adventures’ at school just yet.
“I think you’d both better get dressed and come down to the kitchen… Now,” Sirius insisted, face grim and foreboding.
Tracy flushed even darker at the slight, but lowered her eyes in submissive gratitude, she needed to prove she could be of use. It was her only chance, if she messed this up, she could very well be killed during Christmas break.
Millicent wandered away looking amused, as she returned to her table, ignoring her classmates probing questions as she filled her plate.
Harry groaned pitifully, “Draco I don’t know about this on-AH,” He cried out whining again as Draco forced his tongue deeper this time and left it there.
Draco smiled gratefully and nodded, he’d come to like Harry’s family so far, he was still very nervous about Harry’s father. Harry’s Mum and Uncle Remus were kind and warm everything he wished his Mum was, and Sirius was Strong, and supportive and Caring the way his father never could be. In short he loved Harry’s family and was quite a bit jealous.
Leo shook his head, “No, the room Eadric used was destroyed by his family, following his disgrace in getting caught. In a journal written by Zahra Slytherin in parseltongue, his Great Granddaughter wrote of a Room that functioned as her ancestors ‘secret room’ had. It provides the same services as the other room for its summoner. Her study of the room revealed that it was a carbon copy of the original only much younger. It wasn’t the same room, but a new one.”
Draco ignored Nott’s struggles as he continued staring up at the doors, only turning when a solid thump followed by the hissing of the blanket interrupted his nervous thoughts. Nott, looking disheveled and horrified was being held up by Greengrass and Davis while Bulstrode was fending off the Sphinx blanket with the Dwarfs staff. The Dwarf in question was wrestling with the other blanket growling in annoyance. Blaise stood off to the side brow raised in amusement, while Pansy flounced frantically around the struggling Dwarf. Draco slumped the overwhelming feeling of embarrassment seeping into his bones, with a sigh Draco slipped his wand into his hand and waved it at the blankets, mumbling a Revulsion Jinx to get the Blankets to release them. The Blankets fell limp before folding themselves up neatly for their next use. Blaise shot him a sullen look that Draco would never mention to him ever, he quiet enjoyed breathing thank you.
Lyra shrugged innocently, “Nothing really, we just find it funny that every boy Malfoy shows an interest in seems to somehow wind up offending you. People are starting to notice, pretty soon poor Malfoy won’t have anyone but you left. Funny how that works isn’t it?”
Leo blinked before frowning, feeling mildly uncomfortable. Ok this was… different. Obviously the blonde didn’t recognize him. Did he really look that different? He’d gotten a haircut, sort of, it wasn’t shorter exactly just styled better. He had new clothes and Rae had insisted he wear his contacts until he’d grown use to them. It was convenient not having to worry about them falling down or getting knocked off during Quidditch.
Leo paused frowning at the boy, he didn’t know why. He just didn’t want the boy near Draco he was supposed to like Leo… When did he start thinking of Malfoy as Draco? Malfoy Dammit!
Sirius’ expression quickly soured, growing colder then the weather outside. A feat that actually made Draco a bit nervous, he almost pitied Nott for it.
Julian smirked after him relaxing against the railing with one the crups sitting beside him tails wagging happily. The boy was wearing muggle clothes as well. Worn light wash jeans, with a grey t-shirt, and a jean jacket/ hoodie combo.
Draco’s fist clenched in frustration, it was just his luck the first Slytherin he’d run into could see through his mask, though he’d no idea how. Even Lucius and Narcissa didn’t know the depth of his hatred for them, now he’d have to shut this bastard up, with a flick of his wrist his wand was in his hand. The other boys’ eyes followed the movement with an amused chuckle.
Yes, Pansy had learned from a young age that beauty was her curse and that she was too suffer for it. Perhaps if she truly looked the way her classmates saw her, she wouldn’t be in this mess.
It's been a long time since I posted on here, and my only excuse is fear. I was afraid of the reaction I would get posting chapters after disappearing for so long. I was afraid no one would be reading this after so long, that everyone had abandoned this story and didn't care about it anymore. After I while I felt I had waited too long to even try. Now after a recent comment, i'm wondering if maybe I had been too concerned with how long the chapters were taking... I still have a rough draft of the next chapter, and now after two years of not posting my life is very different and It might take me a bit longer to update then it use to. But I do love this story and I still have an idea of where I want it to go. Please comment and let me know, if I get enough people telling me they still want to read this story, then i'll edit and upload the next chapter and begin the following chapter.
Lily jumped in surprise glancing at the humiliated looking Black before laughing joyfully, “Sirius you sound like an Ass!”
“I promise you that won’t bother me,” He smiled warily, best to say this now, “I’m not my parents’ biggest fan either. If anything I’d say I probably resent them just as much, if not more, than everyone else. I’m not blood prejudice and I think their arrogant bastards for thinking they’re any better than any other family. And their feud with your family is ridiculous, just because Cassiopeia Malfoy fell in love with Jeremiah Weasley over a century ago? That’s got nothing to do with us and I refuse to be bothered by it. They were in love, we should let the matter rest.”
The Dwarf pulled the sleigh to a halt, barking a call out to the pups. The playing stopped as a much larger Hippogriff wandered over to the baby dripping its head to nuzzle its neck. One of the pups gave a parting bark before the three of them charged the sleigh. The Dwarf knocked his staff against the side of his seat causing a long carpet to unravel magically forming stairs for the three, now identifiable Crup, puppies to climb. The Dwarf grumbled in annoyance as the pups yipped excitedly, dual tails wagging, bouncing around him. Batting the Crups into the seat beside him, as the carpet magically rolled itself back up, he mumbled curses adjusting himself in his seat. With a loud crack of the reigns, the Reindeer were off again.
Leo had worked himself up again. He was so tired of everyone giving him the cold shoulder for ‘hurting Malfoy’s feelings’. He was SICK of it. Leo was DONE. “I bet you’re laughing your ass off in your room at night, because they’re all angry at me! Or is this some kind of sick twisted scheme to make me feel bad and come grovel at your feet? Or into your bed?”
Petunia nodded laughing softly, "One of the brightest witches of her time, like your mother. Nasty temper though and strict on rules she was a Prefect I believe, though Lily made Head Girl."
Draco nearly swallowed his tongue. At this point he didn’t know who he was more frightened for. Blaise pissing Leo off, and winding up brutally murdered. Or Leo pissing Blaise off and ‘Disappearing’, two of the most dangerous people Draco knew personally were facing off right in front of him. This kind of stress couldn’t be good for him.
“What did they do Harry,” Draco asked, spine stiffening at the sinister underlying meaning to those words.
Leo strolled casually down the hall, it was near curfew but he didn’t care, he’d skip any detention he received anyway. He just needed to think. All these new revelations were making his head spin. Did he like Malfoy? Did he like blokes? Could he really be gay? He didn’t think so. But everything was pointing at that being the case. Could he be gay and not even realize it?
Draco choked face reddening embarrassingly. It was natural to worry about curfew, not to mention Professor Snape was bloody well brutal in his punishments. He may not scold them publically but in the privacy of the dormitory he really tore you up.
Julian was leaning casually against the wall beside the Slytherin common room, waiting for Theo and Millie to come out. The Slytherins he had sent in to get them had seemed suspicious about him knowing where the common room was. He had told them he and Leo found it back in second year, but hadn’t cared enough to figure out the password. It was true, if they were going to win over Slytherins they couldn’t start by fooling them completely. They couldn’t start by being completely honest though either. Julian really hated waiting. The wall shifted and Draco Malfoy stepped out straightening his robes as he came.
Carina’s wild dark blonde curls framed a happily smiling face as she bent to kiss the boy breathless. Her clothes were more relaxed and casual then any of them had seen her in before. A skin tight Brown t-shirt, with a beige knitted scarf around her neck, worn blue jeans, and brown knee high boots. The girl looked good.
Draco’s expression immediately darkened and he reached out quickly dragging Harry up the last two steps by his shirt. Harry winced as his ankle connected sharply with the edge of the step. “I told you, this is mine, you don’t even touch it unless I tell you too.” Draco growled gripping Harry’s ass near painfully.
“Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, OH GOD!” Harry cried struggling to breathe and brace himself for every thrust.
Harry groaned still panting heavily. Draco didn’t give him to long before he pounced again this time his tongue teasing a ‘new’ part of his body. “H-hey! Didn’t lick there! Draco that’s Gross.” He squealed, when he felt the tip press against the tight untouched ring of muscles.
Arriving at the Doors Ron turned to him one last time, “I really think you should tell a Professor at the very least… I won’t say anything to Hermione or Harry or anyone else… but I really think you should.”
“Scoot over I want to lean against you,” Harry ordered, raising a challenging brow at the older boy.
The Brunette felt her breath catch, “I thought you said I wasn’t sneaky,” She challenged slowly arching a perfectly plucked brow, the boy would see the frizzy caterpillar eyes her mum had spelled however.
“Why do you like me? I mean everything about my life is depressing. My Parents were killed when I was a year and a half. My innocent Godfather was arrested for their murder. My second Godfather was refused custody because he’s a Werewolf, despite being harmless. My Cousin’s were separated and taken from me so that our Schools Headmaster can kill us for our families’ magic. My Mum’s family despise me for that very magic. I’m planning to kill the Headmaster so I’m obviously not very balanced… Why do you like me?” Draco stared at the Boy for a long time. Leo looked nothing but calm and quietly curious. The boy really didn’t know, he did want to know though.
Theo and Millie deflated exchanging blank looks, “What?” How would undermining authority help them? Did they really know what they were doing here? Maybe they’d made a mistake.
Rolling his eyes Julian stood, “I was joking, will the commons suffice or should we adjourn to somewhere more private?”
Leo glared before standing and dropping her gracelessly to the floor. "Listen and listen closely. You will not touch me again, you will not speak to me again. I’m Leo ‘Fucking’ Potter you ugly shrew! I’m a human being no matter what the Ministry, the Prophet, or that Old Goat claim. Attempt to force yourself on me again and I won’t be held responsible for the messy end you find instead.”
The raven didn’t respond, merely panted his head resting on the blonds chest. Draco cracked a half smile, “That was… something” Draco panted breathlessly. He allowed himself to smile as the raven shook with his light laughter.
“Calm down, let me explain the method of the madness,” Julian smirked, amused by the confusion in the Slytherins eyes, “What very few people know about the school, is that Hogwarts hasn’t expelled or suspended a student in over four centuries. Since Dumbledore is viewed as the leader of the light, the symbol of justice, or whatever. The Headmaster will do whatever it takes, to avoid it. He’s not going to want to look like he can’t handle a few rebellious students. Now his pride will be his downfall. ”
“I need time to calm down, don’t speak to me before then,” Leo demanded, before storming out passed the frozen and speechless Slytherin girls of their group.

Both Pairs will be the main pairings of the story. it will focus on a budding sibling relationship between StilesXScottXJacob they'll see each other as brothers and nothing more. It'll also focus on a growing romance between our favorite spazz and resident sourwolf. Jacob's romance will show up later in the story.
Harry gave a whiney groan in response trying his best to do as instructed, but he couldn’t help himself when he felt Draco’s thumb messaging the skin above his hole. He kicked at Draco’s shoulder forcing him away.
"Malfoy I presume?" He smirked, expecting a sharply spoken insult, or a scathing comment about his friends. His nerves were getting the best of him and he needed a good row right now. It never came.
“Of course I’m right,” Orion scoffed looking as though she were offended he’d thought otherwise, “I’m a Black.”
Padfoot smirked, looking amused, “And I’ve heard you can be a little bitch half the time. You’re a perfect match.”
Amelia and Charles exchanged mildly amused looks, “Yes, seems a bit shy though, he hasn’t said much. Though I assume he’s your boyfriend.”
"How dare that floozy try to touch me. I’ve no idea where she’s been. Disgusting," Leo hissed. He hated acting like this but he was still wary of the two Slytherins and he was angry at Ginny. She thought she could force him into something he didn’t want, she had another thing coming.
Leo glanced at Millie pointedly, no one noticed the quick drop of her eyes, “Millie join us, we’ll take pity on the poor girl, I’ve nothing of importance at the moment and this may be good for a laugh or two later.”
“Draco!” Harry cried, as Charles and Jonathan Evan’s attempted to pull the Teenager off the rapidly suffocating man. Draco had him by the throat… maybe, probably, he wasn’t exactly positive through all the chin rolls.
Leo shook his head slowly, “Malfoy…” But what was he going to say, that he didn’t mean it? That would be a lie, and he didn’t think ‘I didn’t mean to say it OUT LOUD’ would help much.
“Or drive you mad,” Lyra through in, looking concerned, “You’re losing yourself in the mask, it’s frightening.”
Harry threw his head back chin trembling as he made whining noises at the foreign feeling. He squealed again when Draco jabbed his tongue against the trembling rosebud before forcing it in slightly and pulling out just as quickly.
Harry sighed and looked away from her piercing gaze, he wasn’t ready to tell her yet, he was too nervous. "I thought we were here to cheer you up?"
Julian rolled his eyes, though he had to agree with the Floozy part. "Of course she is Boss, a real tart."
"Oh it is, but it's 'Leo Harry-James Potter. Two middle names in honor of your paternal and maternal grandfathers." Remus explained sympathetically.
“More please, more,” Harry choked, nearly delirious with the steady shocks of pleasure shooting through his body.
I want you to know that no matter what the circumstances I will always be on your side. You are my brother and I will always care for you.
“Lose the slacks first,” He panted out, he wasn’t going to be naked while Draco still had his slacks on.
Lyra hadn’t changed too much, or so she claimed. She still wore her hair long, at the moment it was pulled in a high ponytail. Her makeup like her sisters was light and natural. Unlike her sister Lyra had decided to get ad industrial in her left ear and pierce her navel and her tongue. Sirius and Leo had been less than thrilled when they’d been told. Another difference with the twins was that Lyra wore her uniform a little more casually. She still wore a mid-thigh length skirt and a fitted shirt. But she let her tie (Black until her sorting) hang loose, and wore gray flat knee high boots. She had also found one of her father’s old gray cashmere vests and tailored it to her liking. It hung loosely on her slender frame and the two remaining buttons met just below her navel.
Draco squirmed still trying to process how he’d wound up straddling the taller boys lap in the small narrow… tunnel? Draco reached out blindly for a wall feeling nothing but air. What was this? How had Leo known about it? He shifted moodily annoyed at the unanswered questions building up in his head.
Blaise rolled his eyes in irritation, before strapping his wand back into its holster, “Fine, but be on your guard.”
“Dark?” Draco, and surprisingly Blaise, asked in disbelief. Though Zabini’s expression was more guarded then curious, Draco tilted his head like a fascinated child leaning forward in his chair beside Blaise. Leo was seated at the opposite end of the Table from the head with his back to the door, subtly showing his trust in the two intruders.
“It’s very comfortable,” Draco agreed softly, eyes locked on a metal ring hanging around the raven’s neck.
Leo sighed rubbing his temples. He was getting tired of all the crap his fight with Malfoy was bringing down on him. It was seriously taking a toll on his revenge plans as well. No one was focusing on the plan at all!
Carina smirked at the stunned look on Malfoy’s face, and the jealous scowl on her boyfriends face. “Lovely, now if I may… when did you meet my sister?”
Looking at the girl in front of him, his heart ached, he knew nothing about her and yet she was family. She was his Aunt’s daughter. The girl looked like her sister, but was so different. The eyes, the cupids bow lips, the perfect cheekbones. Everything a pureblood should be copied perfectly on each girls face. The other girl beside him, his sister in nearly every way, shifted slowly before launching herself into the younger girl's arms. "Lyra!" "Carina!" the sisters clutched each other tightly as if the other would be ripped away at any given moment. He couldn’t help it as he reached out dragging both girls into his arms without separating them. He clutched them tightly to his chest unwilling to let go, not that they seemed to mind. The smaller of the two tucked her head under his chin and sighed contently. “Is this what being home feels like?” she asked quietly. Neither of them answered, they merely stood there embracing and just soaking up the much needed comfort.
"I'll kill those bloody muggles." Sirius snarled, he’d been cross since he’d discovered just WHERE Carina had been sleeping at night. He’d been all for murdering the Grangers in cold blood and leaving them for the rats. Carina had cried and pleaded with him to not tell Ron and Leo. Remus, who’d been with Sirius at the time, had argued against harming the muggles. Remus had obvious been attempting to convince himself as well if his foreboding expression meant anything. Together the two men had collected her things from the park bench (She’d arrived too late to sleep at the shelter), and taken her back to Grimmauld Place. After more tears and an explanation from Carina, the two men agreed to let her tell the boys. For now her living with them was a secret.
Leo nodded, he needed advice, the kind of advice only a mature adult could give… maybe he'd write Remus instead.
“Maybe it’s because EVERY time you ‘apologize’, if you can even call it that. It’s because it’s OBVIOUS you don’t really mean it. I understand that you don’t like me Potter. Hell I wouldn’t like me if I was in your position. I meant it when I said you had nothing to be sorry for, I can’t really hold the truth against you, can I? I had only thought that MAYBE if I was nice to you I could make up for that, I’ll admit it was a stretch and more than a bit presumptuous but I figured it was worth a shot. Why? Because I LIKED you Potter. I REALLY liked you. Now I’ll admit I went about it wrong, but I don’t really have much experience with that sort of thing. So I’m SORRY if everyone is picking on you about this, and I’m SORRY if this makes things worse but FUCK YOU Potter! This is NOT my fault, this is on YOU! And you are NOT going to bully me into feeling bad about something YOU did! I WILL NOT let you! So you can just go to HELL Potter!” Malfoy was nearly shouting by the end, his face red with fury.
Blaise nodded with and exasperated frown, “Draco then, is Black-” he frowned as the girl cut him off insisting he call her Orion. “Is Orion going to be joining us every day.”
Carina finally let the tears spill over, allowing Theo to gently lead her over to one of the overstuffed arm chairs in the room. “I made a mistake.” She explained quietly, hand shaking over her mouth.
Harry shook his head, "We didn't even know her name. We've been looking, but we don't have a last name other then Evans to look under."
The others nodded pushing away their own plates and standing. They walked out of the Hall passing the Slytherins as they went. Leo ordered Tracy not to look back. He wanted to see how loyal Daphne was to her friend.
Malfoy tilted his head curiously searching Leo’s face carefully before nodding, “Alright, you’re absolutely right.” He set down his quill and moved his notebook off to the side before turning to look Leo straight in the face, “You were saying?”
Draco studied his angry friend one last time before, nodding at Orion and moving resolutely to the stool.
“Malfoy,” Theo called, glancing between him and then Zabini quickly, who’d been looking his way as well, “Could I have a word with you later?”
Sirius looked startled, "What!? Why? Remmy, you’re not making sense," obviously he hadn’t figured it all out. Remus almost wished he’d left him to the possessed (Unwashed) laundry.
Sirius waved off the formality confidently, “We’ll all be spending Christmas together, call me Sirius Lord Zabini.”
Vernon Dursley, the woman’s… Husband(?), Was a very large man. Make no mistake the man was definitely
“Dick!” Lyra snapped whacking him in the head with his book, but that sincere, yet playful smile of hers was once again aimed at him. A bloke could only dream.
Lily sighed eyeing the car guiltily as well as the cautiously hope look in her son’s face. “Oh, alright! But you can’t have it until you get your license!”
"You've been harassing me about this for weeks," Potter chuckled, looking amused as he shrugged off his brown leather jacket (Authentic leather, Draco noted in approval).
“A… friend is a fan of terrible old movies, Drives his family crazy,” Draco nearly smiled thinking of the argument Sirius caused the night before James was to return. Lily and Remus had chased him around the house after he’d stolen the remote leaving poor Draco and Harry to watch the shockingly awful movie. Harry had been unsurprised and had seemed relieved when Draco had confessed to being less than impressed. Harry had admitted he and his Mother had debated whether or not terrible movie preferences were a pureblood thing or just a James and Sirius thing.
Sort of? How can you ‘sort of’ have a date? Who was this bastard? How dare he go after Malfoy when the boy CLEARLY still wanted Leo… right? Why was this even a question right now!? What did that little bastard think he was DOING ignoring Leo like this? This was Unacceptable!
“Seamus! Dean! Didn’t know you’d be here.” Harry grinned hopping of his bike to hug his two friends. Dean rolled his eyes.
“We’ll be talking to her later,” Leo drawled absently, eyeing his lunch distastefully. The elves must be on strike the food was defiantly not as good as usual.
Harry sighed staring out at the setting sun, it looked beautiful, as if the clouds themselves were on fire. He didn’t startle when he felt a body press into his back, still intimately familiar with his boyfriends embrace. Draco rested his hands comfortably on either side of Harry’s on the low brick wall. They were out in the court yard on the bridge, where Harry had asked him to meet him after the Welcome Feast.
“I’m not just your Master Tinsel, you are my friend,” Draco corrected quietly, reaching down to hug the tiny creature. He felt her small body tremble slightly before she pushed him away.
“I was taking you to the Cinema,” Draco confessed, smiling indulgently at the petulant look his boyfriend gave him.
“Why did you bother leaving it down if you were just going to tie it back?” Millie asked in amusement, as they walked to class. She never understood the constant need in girls to change their hairstyle nearly every day. It’s one of the reasons she kept her dark brown hair in an admittedly messy ponytail most days. She sneered at a group of Ravenclaw boys eyeing Lyra and Daphne as they passed. She didn’t mind hanging out with the girls, she didn’t even mind that she was overlooked in their presence. Daphne and Lyra spent time on themselves in the morning. Millicent didn’t see a point to it, if the only reason a boy spoke to her was based on her appearance and, not on who Millicent herself was she wanted nothing to do with him. Now don’t get the wrong impression she was by no means ugly. Her heart shaped face, button nose, and slender frame was a constant source of pride for her mother. The woman was always lamenting that her daughter wasted her good looks, and that she would never be a beautiful as she was now… You can why she resents shallow people no?
“What do you mean, is something wrong, Harry what’s going on?” Draco felt so confused, was something happening he needed to know about? Were his Aunt and Uncle trying to take him away and make him their Son? WHAT WAS HAPPENING?
Draco quickly and deftly undid Harry’s belt and ripped it out of the loops probably ripping Harry’s jeans as well but that was besides the point really. before flicking open the button and yanking down his jeans. He pushed Harry’s legs off his to allow the boy to pull his jeans off and they’d barely hit the floor before Draco grabbed his ankle and dragged him back over. Harry panted wildly not one hundred percent on how he felt about how quickly this was moving but he was sure of one thing. He LOVED being manhandled like this. Draco yanked at the elastic of Harry’s boxer briefs frowning warningly when Harry caught his wrists stopping him.
Carina screamed, Theo held her protectively to his chest shielding her from the glass. (As their roles demanded)
"Weasley," Julian deadpanned, not even turning to look at the girl. The tone of the group took a dark turn.
Finally after what seemed like an eternity later Harry told him in a trembling voice to move. Draco groaned in gratitude, “I swear I’ve never felt anything tighter love.”
The blonde paused glancing warily at the door before looking confidently back at Harry, “He’s not here. And if I remember correctly, neither is your Mum.”
Leo sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose nearly dislodging his glasses, "If he breaks your heart I'll break his neck." He warned, sounding frighteningly serious.
"She's not lying mate," Julian chuckled, still getting over the shock of meeting someone so similar in appearance to Carina. They were twins after all.
"Leo." He gave a single nod before sweeping back to his compartment, ignoring the nagging notion that Draco may still be watching him. He didn’t feel like fighting anymore, he just wanted to rejoin his family in their compartment.
Draco flushed even more, ducking his head. He didn’t know how to react to that information, but the amused look everyone was giving him was horrifying.
Sirius sighed, feeling guilty about upsetting the girl, "I'm sorry Cari it just gets me so angry knowing I could have taken care of the three of you."
“Abraxas would rant about it. I heard the story a lot as a child, every time he encountered your family actually. It got really annoying after a while. You’d have thought it’d only just happened.” Draco grumbled sullenly, before smiling at her, “Anyway it’s a pleasure to meet you Ginny.”
“Oh MERLIN I love this place,” Lyra laughed looking threw her purchases. She had bought something at almost every place they’d visited.
Leo sighed looking at Julian and the Twins they wouldn’t look at him. He couldn’t believe he let things get this out of control, his cousins feared him his best mate couldn’t look at him, Theo was right they needed a break. He sighed feeling decades older then he was. Dragging himself away from the table he walked over to the twins kneeling down in front of them. Carina looked like she hadn’t been sleeping and her eyes were puffy and red from crying. Lyra was about the same but her bottom lip was puffy and bleeding slightly from being bitten and chewed on often. They looked a mess, and it was all his fault. Folding his arms across their thighs he buried his face there and allowed himself to do something he hadn’t done since last year. He cried, no sound, no shaking shoulders, just tears. Carina seemed to notice first as she began running her fingers soothingly through his hair. Lyra sighed rubbing his shoulder, and muttering something he didn’t hear to Julian.
Carina shook her head to clear it, “He kissed him, but that’s not why he was upset. After kissing Malfoy, Leo panicked and ran off knocking over a suit of armor. Zacharias Smith was nearby and cornered Draco demanding he become his boyfriend. Malfoy had no choice, I’m not sure why, but he agreed. That’s why he was angry. I completely misread the situation and assumed he was sulking about being wrong about liking Malfoy. So I yelled at him, humiliating him in front of the other Gryffindors.” Carina burst into tears after finishing, crying into Theo’s shoulder.
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
“Call him dad?” Draco sighed walking over to sit on a corner of Harry’s bed, Harry hurried to follow, “Well he’s not really a dad, well he doesn’t act like it anyway. I use to do everything I could to be like him or make him proud. Finally one of my classmates at Drumstrang pulled me aside and asked me what I was doing. I told him to mind his own business like the little bastard I was pretending to be, and he told me to grow the fuck up and really LOOK at who I was trying to become. I had no idea what he meant. But I watched my parents more closely after that, I was twelve so of course I thought they were the best parents in the world, but after about a year I began realizing that I was more of an accessory then an actual person in their eyes. Status is the only thing they care about. My Parents would sacrifice anything for the sake of status. Me, our relationship, each other, Nothing is sacred to those two. If they ever found out I was bisexual they’d disown me faster than you could say Quidditch. They wouldn’t care who I wound up with, bird or bloke, they would rather die than have my sort of ‘filth’ taint their precious ‘status’. So he’s Lucius, and my Mothers Narcissa. They know I no longer respect them. They already warned me not to stand against them in the public eye. If I had somewhere to go I’d tell them.”
Orion Black… the boy was friends with Reggie’s kid. He hadn’t seen his younger brother in a little over eleven years, Blonde hair and Brown eye’s flashed across his mind, the kid had been good looking. Maybe he should give Reggie a fire call, they had made up hadn’t they. Maybe Reggie could tell him a bit about this Malfoy boy as well.
Harry bit his lip eyeing the slick length nervously before holding himself above it awkwardly, “Um, do I just sit on it?” He panted nervously.
Theo nodded smiling down at her. He dropped a kiss to her forehead, “Very, and believe it or not… Draco respects you. He won’t let Zabini hurt us.”
Leo grabbed his hips roughly and pressed him forcefully back against the wall as he attacked the boys neck with his teeth and tongue. He moaned as the already steaming hot shower became unbearable.
“SEE, Merlin, you still haven’t forgiven me! How many times do I have to say SORRY?” Leo demanded, running a hand roughly through his hair.
"And what about my cousins Lyra and Carina." Leo scoffed, rolling his eyes "Why did you lie about that, or the fact that my mother was a twin?”
Leo paused turning to look at her with a detached careless expression as if her desire held no importance to him, “And?”
Mikhail rolled his eyes as Ginny, Seamus, and Dean roared with laughter and Ron turned green. “Knock it off Rion. You’re being a menace and the school year hasn’t even started yet.” The boy scolded.
Harry flushed slightly knowing Draco had probably gotten that one from him watching American TV at his house. Draco grunted rolling his eyes and moving back to his seat, knowing Mikhail and Orion would be joining them.
Harry gasped when he felt Draco’s hand close around his slightly hard length and begin to pull. “Draco.”
Theo sighed leaning back in his chair watching his friends working quietly around the distraught girl and wondering how this became his life.
Draco caught his shoulder driving into the boy as hard as he could, chest heaving with the wonderful mix of pleasure and need.
Harry grinned widely and flopped back on the bed to watch Draco clean himself up before dressing he quickly cleaned Harry up despite his protests before reaching into the nightstand to steal all his condoms, (Seriously? Your actually taking them?) before leaning over the boy to devour his mouth one last time. “See you tonight. Hopefully with good news.”
The Gryffindors stared at him skeptically, and Mikhail was sort of relieved they didn’t shout their surprise as he half expected them to. He’d have to give them more credit next time.
Theo snorted, leaning casually against the book shelf, with his hands in his pockets, “We think you know why.”
And then he was gone. Draco leaned heavily against the wall attempting to quell his temper. He was in no way the tease in this situation. That title went to Leo Fucking Potter. Merlin help that boy if Draco found him before his temper calmed.
Julian shrugged nonchalantly reaching into his pouch again and pulling out four more sheets of parchment. He handed them over, clearing his throat to ease his nerves. He wasn’t sure he should be telling them this. The Twins had always paid more attention to him then Percy or Ginny. He’d understood Charlie and Bill’s need to escape their overly controlling Mother but the Twins had always treated him more like family then anyone.
“Draco tried to apologize, work some sort of understanding out you know,” Ron hedged frowning, his hand tightening slightly around Hermione’s as his temper rose.
Ginny smiled brightly nudging a red haired boy beside her. The boy rolled his eyes before extending a hand, “I’m Ron Weasley, Ginny’s older brother and Harry’s best mate.”
“Draco,” Narcissa drawled coolly, as he sat down at their ornately carved dining room table for breakfast.
The man nodded, “I am S.B. but you will refer to me as Padfoot. I sent you this mirror because Leo is being a typical Potter. Stubborn and unmovable. Now I’m quite aware that your initial attraction was his appearance. But I must insist you continue to pursue the boy.”
The young man raised both brows in surprise, "Oh so that's how you got in. Thought for a moment I'd have to call campus security."
Leo handed over three measures of flying seahorses, “Heat until it turns green then we let it sit overnight.”
"It’s so stupid, like a bloody Soap Opera, I'm not even a Weasley. None of us are who we always believed we were? It’s so stupid! My name's not even Ron for Merlin's sake, I mean come on really? How lame can you get? Merlin, my names Julian Prewett, MOLLY’S older brother is my Father." Ron's laugh was slightly manic, as he spat out the Weasley Matriarch’s name, he slammed his hands flat on the table looking down at it. "Bloody hell.”
Now Draco was dragging his shorter boyfriend down the street rushing along so they wouldn’t be ‘late’. Harry was sure to point out that if they did happen to be late it’d be his own fault. Draco slowed to a stop raising a brow at him. He turned, keeping his hand in a firm grip. Draco tugged the smaller teen closer, the space between them almost nonexistent, mercury boring into jade. Harry blushed suddenly feeling shy as Draco dipped his head breath caressing Harry’s lips. His breathing stuttered before Draco gently took his lips in a soft sweet kiss. Right there… in the middle of the road… for anyone and everyone to see. Harry’s heart fluttered at the path his thoughts were taking. Wrapping his free hand around the blonde and threading his fingers in the hair at the nap of his neck. The older teen hooked a finger in the belt loop of his younger boyfriend’s jeans pulling him closer as he deepened the kiss. Harry’s breath stuttered as Draco pulled away licking his lips.
“It’s Leo! MERLIN, just call me Leo, dammit!” Leo shouted, clutching his hair as if he wanted to just rip it out of his head.

The room froze and Harry shifted nervously standing in front of the blonde defensively, “Um… Mum, Your home, is Dad with you?”
Professor Whinsaw’s face twitched in anger, as he snatched up the scroll, and whipped out his horn rimmed glasses so he could read it. Perching the lenses on the end of his nose the man shook out the scroll and raised a brow as his eyes scrolled carefully over the blondes’ answers, the students around them held their breath in anticipation, his scowl growing more prominent with every line. Reaching the end the Professor pulled out his obnoxious ostrich feather quill, and he made a quick mark on the scroll. “Outstanding,” he drawled grudgingly, “And Mr Malfoy… see Professor Filch for your Detention later tonight six-thirty sharp.”
"But why would Dumbledore change my name?" Harry asked angrily, “Who the bleeding hell Lies about a NAME!?”
Harry’s breath hitched as he attempted to force himself to calm down, “My Aunt and Uncle… and their… Son.” He forced out, frowning as he took deep even breaths, it seemed to be helping a bit.
“You, Carina, and Julian will receive one as well, as I said… it’s a family tradition.” Leo agreed, nodding stiffly. Draco frowned he planned to brand his family? Though he had to admit the perks of the sigil more than made up for the pain it would cause.
In the Library Zabini and Malfoy were sitting in a secluded corner. Draco sat stiffly in the seat next to his tall olive-skinned friend, while Zabini sat relaxed with his back to the wall in a chair he conjured.
Harry shrugged smiling contently, “I wanted to be alone with you, and what you had planned sounded like it was going to be crowded.”
"You asked," Sirius chuckled, nervously. He really didn’t want to piss off Lettie’s Nephew, he had her temper after all.
Draco rolled his eyes before taking the lead again, “I wanted to go to the Cinema, it was your idea to take a tumble in the sandbox.”
“In time Domina, in time,” Draco smirked filling his plate with a cruel glance over his shoulder at the unaware Gryffindors, “They’ll learn soon enough. A Malfoy never forgets, and never forgives.”
An annoyed grunt sounded from behind the Italian, “Are you really starting a pissing match with one of Potter’s Cousins Blaise?” Draco stepped around him into the room, curious eyes taking everything in.
Lyra and Carina squealed jumping around happily, Millie laughed joyously as they each grabbed one of her arms and dragged her off.
The three Slytherins made their way down the Hall toward the dorms, only to come face to face with Pansy and two unfamiliar Slytherin girls.
Leo huffed, shuffling his feet, “I usually bath at this time.” He let a threatening edge tinge his words.
Harry shrugged self-consciously, “We just always seem to wind up here, having sex, its all we seem to do.”
Leo frowned at the two Slytherins, they were sitting far too close for his liking. It was just his luck, Smith disappears before Leo could get his hands on him, now this fool steps in and thinks he can take Malfoy away from him. The boy was far too popular for Leo’s liking he was going to have to do something about that.
Draco pushed firmly at the boy’s chest, “Leo! Our old Defense Teacher just walked in!” He complained as the boy barely budged. Leo groaned pressing his forehead into Draco’s shoulder, “So?”
Harry frowned, breathing heavily as he tried to work out what to do. Draco didn’t seem to want him to do anything though. He was basically attacking Harry’s neck so he could ask. Draco grabbed the loops if his jeans dragging him up and into his lap wrapping Harry’s legs around his waist as he did. “I’m in charge do only as I say,” He demanded before claiming Harry’s mouth again.
“Fantastic,” his cousin smirked, rubbing his hands together mischievously “Here’s what I want you to do…”
“Fine then Weasley,” Draco scoffed coldly, turning his attention back to his plate. Harry and his friends started in surprise at the tension emanating between the two as Ron returned the cold retort with one of his own. “Do what you want Malfoy.”
A sharp bang had the furiously blushing blonde jumping in his seat and whipping around to look at his stone faced boyfriend. Leo had slammed his fist on the table and was now glowering at Julian who merely arched an unimpressed brow.
Blaise frowned looking thoughtful, “What are you doing to reach your goal? So far I’ve only seen pathetic little pranks and sad little outbursts in class, nothing note worthy or overly impressive. A childish tantrum if you ask me.”
Percy dropped into the nearest chair, shooting the twins a disparaging look when he had to dig a muggle whoopee cushion out from under himself, pointedly ignoring their weak snickers of amusement. “I can,… it makes quite a bit of sense actually. Not long ago, when I was interning in the legal department of the department of birth and registration, I was interning with fathers old friend Ferguson Togglebuff… I came across a few discrepancies I found… odd. For example a file had been wiped completely clean, with nothing on it. Another had pages missing, I suspected a theft or something, so I mentioned it to Ferg, he asked if I’d looked at anything from Mum’s side and of course I hadn’t. Instead of reporting it as I thought he might, he brushed it off and sent me home on a ‘good days work’ said I’d been working too hard anyway. I was transferred to another department the next day.”
“Oh,” Leo scoffed dropping his head onto the blondes shoulder weakly, “Oh he says. Merlin it’s not like you haven’t seen a House elf before. Just sit still.”
“Is that a threat?” Lyra asked quietly, glaring at the boy, or man. No one could call this man a boy. He may have only been fifteen, but the bloke was just as broad and chiseled as her cousin if not more so. He was tall at six foot and looked more dangerous than any man she’d ever met (and her Uncle had supposedly been to Azkaban… (Note to self: Ask about that!))
“E-excuse me?” Harry flushed in embarrassment. Was he here to humiliate him? He’d always hear his Dad cursing the cocky, arrogant, sneaky, slimy, jerk Malfoy’s but he’d never thought the blonde was like that. He seemed so gentle and peaceful flying gracefully through the air. Could he have been wrong?
Harry didn’t know why Draco’s words embarrassed him, but touching himself in front of Draco seemed very personal, and he wasn’t ready to share that yet.
Leo looked down at the blonde who was covering his mouth to muffle his ragged breathing and peering nervously around Leo at the boy out in the hall. He shifted awkwardly causing Draco to start and look up in surprise. He hadn’t realized how much shorter Draco was then him now. Leo was at least a head taller than the boy. He was also much broader then the boy, Draco was thin and toned. Leo was broad and built, not obnoxiously so but enough to make a difference, definitely enough to pin the boy effortlessly to the wall.
“We’re Slytherins Leo, and we spend most of our time with you, we were bound to figure it out.” Millicent explained, smiling sheepishly.
Don't worry about Mother. I'd always believed you were too good for this family. She's just petty about losing a son. She doesn't realize she'd already lost you.
“Blaise, maybe we should go?” Draco decided nervously, the longer he sat there, the more uneasy he became. This just seemed like such a bad idea.
Leo paused, “I don’t like you Malfoy, that’s not going to change just because you find me attractive.” He continued on his way back to the castle, much to Draco’s annoyance. He hoped S.B. could help him. Because it seemed he may need more than Leo’s friends were willing to give.
"You say you keep me with the Dursley's for my protection," Leo seethed, the old goat had an excuse for everything didn’t he.
Harry’s eyes widened at the stressed note in the other boys voice, “I’m sorry, I guess I … I don’t know, maybe I am this needy. I think I thought you’d stop me if you didn’t want to. That would be okay you know.”
Draco and Harry sat in silence watching a random comedy show, Draco glanced at Harry every once in a while feeling anxious.
“I’ve never been to the cinema… I wanted the first time to be with you,” Draco admitted resting his chin on the boys’ chest as he settled comfortably between his legs.
The Potions Master sneered watching the red head whip around, and quickly exit the Medical Wing, “Mr. Malfoy, what on
“Because I can make your toes curl, and light every nerve in your body on fire. I can make you scream louder, beg harder, and need so much more… do you still want me to stop?”
Blaise glanced at him out of the corner of his eye, “He’s not dead.” Blaise raised a brow as if to say ‘Yet.’
Lily looked at Sirius, “I’m going to be staying here at the Hospital Sirius, I’d appreciate it if you and Rem stay at the House with Harry.”
“Harry, you know Draco would never do anything to hurt you,” Dean reminded him seriously, catching his arm to gain his attention.
“His own damned fault, Father always said he was a Daft fool.” Draco shrugged carelessly, though he did miss his late Uncle, the man had brought it on himself when he went against Lady Elena’s advice and proceeded unguarded on a deal. Lady Elena was devastated. She’d really loved Draco’s Uncle.
Thank you all for your support! You're all amazing! I truly hope no one was disappointed by the length of this chapter. I promise the next one will be longer!
"Fine then, we let Leo drive his self and eventually the rest of us, barmy." Julian sighed, "Look he's either going to shag Malfoy or beat the pulp out of him, I just want this Shit to end."
"I thought Lily was your only sister Pet?" Vernon grunted, actually setting his fork down to pay attention, it was defiantly a first.
Tracy paled and floundered for a moment, “I could help, please, give me a moment of your time and I can tell you how, please I-”
“Do you not want to date me?” he blurted out thoughtlessly, Draco yanked the boxers back out of his hands frowning in confusion and disbelief.
“I know exactly who you are, Blaise Zabini, I know who your Grandfather is and what his plans for you are. I did my research before returning this year. I know who I want on my side, and I know who I’ll need to step on to reach my goals. What I don’t know is if I’ll need to crush you or not…” Leo smirked at the amused twitch of Blaise’s lips, he laced his fingers leaning his mouth against them with a murmured, “So… do we have a deal?”
“Right,” Harry mumbled, looking amused at his boyfriend’s giddy behavior at getting one over on his parents. Draco had been more then interested when Sirius had offered him the clothes. Going through everything and feeling every article commenting on the different fabrics. Harry had to threaten the boy to get him to pick a damned outfit so they could go. Sirius had to promise him full access to his clothes for their dates to finally get him out of the house. Though Harry couldn’t exactly complain, Draco looked sexy as hell in Muggle clothes, especially his ass.
