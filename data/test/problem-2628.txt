Last year’s Trimagus Tournament fairs had allowed the Weasleys and Teddy to sell their products to a larger audience outside of the school, but they had managed to segment themselves to the students of Hogwarts as well. Their hair color changing pills had become their most popular product, followed by one which made the person’s nails change color and keep on changing in all the colors of the rainbow. The first was called Tricolor Hair, and the second Rainbow Nails. Some had taken to use their joke products as a fashionable statement, while others begrudgingly started to wear hats or gloves indoors.
“A dead relative who doesn’t need them anymore.”
“This is my friend, Colin Creevy, a photographer.” Harry showed towards Colin.
“Now that’s rather cheap…” Draco commented as he studied the ring. “Rather than get one her size, he chose one with an enchantment which would adjust itself.”
Harry almost gaped at the Potions Master as the cold yet burning claws of panic ripped into his chest. He forced his expression to remain calm but his heart raced wildly in his chest. All his life he had been a vocal supporter for werewolves and their medical predicament, as well as the struggles and discrimination which faced them on an everyday basis. He was proud to have a werewolf dad, and he was proud to be the son of a werewolf.
Remus sighed as he rubbed his neck, remaining unfocused and unable to look at the man who was most correct in all of his statements.
“If there was so much evidence, why were you never arrested, sir?” Harry sat up a little better in the armchair, focusing on the man who was dearly beloved by his dad.
“Mr. Lupin, you should have your father teach you the Cooling Charm. It is a most handy charm for when you wish to be fashionable without suffering from the layers.” Professor Dumbledore chuckled and nodded towards Remus, still smiling.
“My dear son, a man does not simply put his arm around you out of sympathy, no, I am quite certain that he fancies you. That, and the fact that he claimed to have taken care of you and being taken care of in return. A lot of men would have a hard time admitting such a thing, and he did so in front of me. Clearly, he is trying to get your attention.” Her eyes suddenly turned black, and she looked at her son with fierce determination. “You must be careful though, seeing as he is the son of Sirius Black,” Narcissa had completely forgotten that Harry Potter was, in fact, James Potter’s son, not Sirius’s. “Back during school days, he would jump into bed with anything with legs, is Potter the same? How were the rumors about him back in school?” The last was a demand.
“Fifty points from Gryffindor.” The woman turned around and walked back to her desk, leaving Harry, Neville and Draco staring after her as if she had become mad. She stopped in front of the blackboard and spun around, clipboard still in hand. “Of all my classes so far, this one is by far the unruliest. I have grown quite so tired of you interrupting and derailing it. One more word from anyone who wasn’t given the word by me and I will remove a hundred points from their House. Sit down, Mr. Lupin. I will finish the attendance now.”
Harry stared at her, trying to understand what she had just said. None of the words made sense to him as he struggled to comprehend what she could possibly mean by her statement, and the woman continued to speak.
Narcissa accepted the body of her cousin, as well as the duties which came with arranging a funeral. While she would normally have placed her duties before anything else, her son had been mortally wounded in battle. Nothing had a higher priority than Draco within his mother’s heart. Thus, Sirius’ funeral could not be arranged for almost a month after his death, yet his body was preserved as well as it could be by the use of magic as he rested within the Malfoy Manor chapel, waiting to be buried.
“Who is this mysterious relative?”
, as he had yet to finish the very long book. He was still enjoying it from time to time but he was considering finding something a little shorter to read in between sessions with the Count.
--- Facts & Headcanons ---
“You’re supposed to have two of them, as this terrarium does. One colder side, and one warmer, so you will have to check the temperature regularly.” He pointed at two thermometers, and then at another round thermometer looking object. “This here is a hydrometer, which measures moisture in the air. You are supposed to keep an eye on it to maintain the right moisture level, thus keep your snake healthy. She will suffer if the moisture isn’t right. Luckily, you also have some houses for her to hide in, they are not as big as the ones at her home at the manor, but it will go fine for her.” Draco smiled at Harry. “Not to mention, you can actually ask her what she needs, so you have an advantage there.”
George and Bill were both still grieving for the loss of their shared friend, Sirius Potter. George could not help but think of the fact that if he had been alone, completely alone without any friends or family to help him, it was possible that he would have found comfort in a bottle. He was admittedly a little worried about drinking in the first place, but the presence of Bill made him feel calm in that he wouldn’t be allowed to go too far.
“Potter’s not going to be allowed to stay for long,” Pat continued, attempting to sound nonchalant and bored. “and Draco doesn’t seem about to wake up anytime soon. We were going to check on him, and so we have. I’ve already made up my mind to replace him, so in my opinion, he’s just a classmate rather than my Quidditch subordinate and I have done my duty in checking that he is alive.” She stopped speaking and then added with some effect, “it stinks in here.” She hoped that was enough to make the point clear that she wanted to leave.
“So, are you all settled in?” Bill leaned in through the open train window, inserting himself into the compartment while pushing some hair behind his ear as he spoke. “I don’t really have time to stick around.”
Bill had been back for about two months, and had found out the hard way that he was no longer used to the British weather, when he had encountered the new bank receptionist. The receptionist was a blonde, pale person from France, who most people referred to as the Beauxbatons champion, but Bill had missed why that was, as he didn’t usually read the newspapers.
“That saying doesn’t apply to this situation at all…” Ron commented as he stood up as well, nodding a greeting towards Draco who was busy folding his sleeves up.
This is why we've removed any romanticised idea of Ron talking about his supposed actual love in his sleep and being held accountable for sleep-talk without anyone questioning it, and instead chose to have him be that startled by the impressions of what happened to Draco before he passed out.
The Dark witch descended the stairs dragging Draco with her. He should have been too heavy for her, but perhaps adrenaline or madness made her forget that fact as she struggled towards her goal with the limping teenager at wand point.
Harry studied his friend as he put his hair clip into his bag, shrugging without certainty. “It’s not that I don’t trust you. It’s Professor Slughorn I don’t quite know how to deal with.”
The longer he waited, the harder it had become, and now he was here, having to confess to the woman who had been rejected by her parents, the boy who hadn’t had parents since he was a baby, as well as the young man who had always feared that his own dad might kill him, that the seemingly happy Weasley family was to go through a divorce. All of his friends were, in one way or another, at least slightly dependent on the Weasley home. All of them did know Molly Weasley, and they had lived under the same roof for extended periods of time. To give them all the news that everything was about to change was nowhere near easy.
Albus played with his hair in a rather flustered manner as he continued to look anywhere but at the young man. To Harry’s surprise and slight amusement, the old wizard’s cheeks began to slowly turn red with embarrassment.
Almost a full year of being someone I’m not.
“Rude,” responded Greyback. “I’m right here.”
“I don’t quite… I mean to say I…” Severus continued to mumble through his hand. “I do not think that an actual marriage would be arranged for the moment, or anytime soon… Perhaps there will never be an opportune time to...”
“I have to leave now, or I will be late,” Draco had previously said as he gathered his father’s cane from the side of Harry’s bed and pulled himself up using its assistance.
After her haircut Ginny felt less overwhelmed to explore Malfoy Manor. She appreciated her hair, as Professor Lupin generally let her choose everything she wanted without worrying about style or beauty, which wasn’t what Ginny personally desired. Thus, she was allowed a wilder style, compared to the straight cuts which her mum found more agreeable for her.
“One more objection from you and I will give you detention, Mr. Malfoy!” The woman barked at him now, her eyes flaring with something resembling deep rage. “If Potter so badly wants to be referred to by the name of a dangerous half-breed which will taint his legacy, then I will allow him his wish!” She more or less spit the words out, having found that her assumed prey had in fact been one who refused to be consumed.
She nodded to herself, as if that would help her feel less frightened by the prospect of telling one of her closest friends that his girlfriend was accusing her of a collection of malicious actions which she wasn’t performing. What if Ron knew already, and he chose to do nothing about it? What if he, too, would blame Hermione for what Lavender was doing? Like the movies. Like the children back in Muggle school did to one another. It was too frightening to think about, too awful to consider.
“At first, I assumed that the nightmares had to do with what I witnessed in that graveyard.” Harry tried hard to simply speak and not allow himself to think about what he was saying, to avoid the dreams or the memories becoming too vivid. “But when I told dad about it, he began to worry that there might be something more to it. I have these dreams about… feeling the resurrection. Experiencing it. I feel it like it happened to me, not from the perspective of watching it, but I see myself captured by that statue, with Pettigrew beside me, and then… I’m reborn. When I wake up, I feel feverish, I feel ache and pain, I feel muscles I’ve never had before…”
I realise the only reason as to why that is. I understand, but I cannot comprehend it fully.
The world shrank, shifted, expanded. It twisted, turned and realigned. Scents came and disappeared, changed into something other than scents but still remained functionally the same. Harry looked up at his boyfriend with eyes which could not blink, all his limbs gone, leaving a powerful but cumbersome body which he still had left to figure out. His tongue moved in and out of his mouth without Harry thinking about it, telling him things which his human senses never could.
I laugh at him as I allow my far larger hands to close around the child’s. “My name is Albus. Albus Dumbledore.”
“I will come to your home tomorrow, so that we can visit the boy.” Draco confirmed towards Harry Potter, as he took his mother’s hand. He could feel from her grip that she had quite a lot to say to him when they were in private. He smiled just a little nervously at the other man, and waved his hand in a more than awkward gesture. “...See you, Potter.”
“Just let me take you to the infirmary, please?” Arthur sighed as he realised that they were about to run around in yet another circle of not getting anywhere. “I’m tired of this, the sooner you agree the faster you’ll be free of my Muggle-brain.”
Although the group of friends would not learn of it later, the incident made Goyle very insecure, seeing as he was taking Divination, and was also being given kisses as a form of greeting after assisting Hagrid in saving the centaur’s leg as well as possibly life. The blatant efforts in attempting to remove teachers using flimsy reasoning and unclear logic was beginning to become obvious even to Goyle, who did not consider himself a particularly observant person.
“I’m sorry… I’m so sorry!” Percy whimpered. “You will be fine… You will be restored. I’ll donate money too, just… just wait. I will give you your life back… Somehow… somehow, I will.” He hugged the other mage closer to himself, clinging to him as he made his promises. “You didn’t deserve this. You didn’t.”
“Ah,” Andromeda drank a too large gulp of wine to hide her embarrassment, considering if she would be welcomed into the revolutionary group of people who wanted to tear down the wall.
“So let’s.” Andromeda giggled. “Let’s talk. Let’s talk for hours, minutes or even seconds. Let’s just talk. Like normal people.”
Luna was generally busy with her OWLs, and she spent her time around Ginny and her friends, which had recently become Luna’s friends as well. Harry had yet to have the time to speak to her properly as they were rather busy, but they had been able to chat a little during Muggle Studies. He looked forward to speaking to her when she had time, as her stuttering had already improved since last term, and her general behavior was a lot less dreamlike and absentminded. It appeared to Harry that Luna was recovering rather well, just as she had wanted to. Of course, he couldn’t know without speaking to her, but what he did see and hear of her made her out to be healthy.
At the time, it felt impossible for most of them to imagine that quite the number of mages, especially young ones, did want to leave. It was only later, when the classrooms and the halls became noticeably emptier, and the House tables began to feature stretches of empty seats that it became reality. Students were leaving Hogwarts as they no longer felt safe. Not even the Heir of Slytherin or the mass murderer from Azkaban had managed to chase so many away. It wasn't anymore an isolated incident, but a society which was slowly falling apart around them, making all the more reason to fear for the future.
Sirius hesitated as he stared into his wretched reflection within the glass. “I got this letter, from Reg, and-” as he spoke, he remembered something a lot more important than his own relationship to his brother. He remembered the horcruxes, and that Reg had begged him to bring one to Albus Dumbledore.
“How are you feeling?” Hermione stood on the opposite side of the bed, playing with her hair as she studied his face.
"He learnt when to push and when not to push."
“I should think that you are placing them in more danger by refusing to allow me to help them, as well as yourself.” The voice was soft as it spoke up, without anger, without any real emotion yet still gently scolding. The Dark Lord raised a pale hand and reached over, softly brushing his fingers over the necklace which Remus had given to Severus.
“Tell you all about it in a bit.” Creevy carefully maneuvered the wheelchair inside with the assistance of Neville, who was the closest. “Just finishing up what I need to do before then. Thanks, Longbottom.”
“Thank you either way,” Harry removed his hairpin as they stepped inside to shake his hair free of snow in case some hadn’t melted yet. “I suppose all I can do is keep on trying.” As he spoke, his glasses fogged up from the heat of the entrance hall and his own breathing.
He laughs merrily and I suddenly feel the need to hug him again. I don’t, because it doesn’t feel like the right thing to do in this situation. He has just managed to calm down after he feared that I would assault him. If I touch him now, I might frighten him again. Thus, I don’t hug him, because I don’t feel like I can.
“Are you sure…?” Luna mumbled her words once more.
Harry and Draco exchanged surprised looks as they heard Dobby stop speaking about himself in third person and instead spoke like most other people with agency would speak like.
“Sir?”
“They investigated you? But you’ve worked for Hogwarts for, at least ten years, haven’t you?” Harry couldn’t hide neither his shock nor disbelief as he looked to his favorite teacher.
Even as a pale speck of black and green clad against the white snow upon the arena, Draco didn’t look healthy. While most other fliers were able to get up on their broom and to focus on getting into the air, Draco remained upon the ground for a few moments, even when the game itself had started. Ginny was already chasing after a golden speck as Draco finally appeared to remember that he was supposed to be airborne, and so he slowly stepped up on his broom, and sailed away to the side like a bumblebee drunk on honey.
“Yeah, yeah… I got it,” Colin nodded and kept on writing.
“I was hoping that you would not object to me calling you by your name in private then, si-, I mean… Severus?” Harry found that it was odd to speak the name out loud, almost incomprehensible to fathom while it had been easy to accept within his mind. That somehow, they were actually that close.
“I suppose I should be working on that too.” Draco stepped back from Harry and began taking his jacket off, which he placed on top of the sofa. He then walked over to the people practicing and joined the lineup.
Time marched on, and George hadn’t changed despite his vow that he would.
“I am… I am not quite myself…” Severus attempted to excuse himself as his red tea soaked into the corner of the assignments he had yet to correct. “I… I cannot… There is simply too much… I…”
Invisible House Elves were positioned outside all common rooms, that was to say that Dumbledore had convinced some of the elves working at Hogwarts to protect the students in secret, since they could go completely undetected and were more powerful than mages in general. Their aim was to keep the students safe within their chambers, and stop the Death Eaters should they try to enter. House Elves were also positioned within the Great Hall, where they would be able to observe the Death Eaters and possibly move to stop or stun them if the time limit of their retreat passed. Dobby was in charge of picking the most suitable ones for the task, and he himself had volunteered for the Great Hall guard. Dobby truly was nothing like the thing which had shown up in Remus’ and Harry’s home four years ago.
“Say, I arrived earlier as stated to assist Mr. Potter in the writing of his will.” Albus’s pleasant voice inquired about Sirius as he petted both of the dogs, whose long faces rested upon one knee each in the hopes of those possible and illusive licorice candies being in need of eating.
“I imagine it’s much the same as you do with anyone else,” Neville placed his hands on his hips, giving Ron somewhat of a stern look.
“Well… With all of Umbridge’s regulations and evident dislike of Muggle-borns, I guess I was expecting to just be, you know, normal? Insignificant? Unnoticed?” Colin was joking yet it was evident upon his expressions and unfocused gaze that he was uncomfortable with the idea of being less than the rest of the mages. Less of a mage than the rest of Hogwarts.
“It’s not really that anything has happened to him, but Draco is stuck in bed with a cold,” Blaise spoke up first, meeting Harry’s gaze as he spoke. “It should pass soon enough, he says that he has been to Madam Pomfrey and asked for help. She apparently suggested rest and water, with a moderate reliance on medicine so as to not overdose.”
she asked in her old voice which Harry had once found to sound cruel.
“I would like to formally request that this object be destroyed by the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, as her venom has thus far been successful in destroying the diary, which was presumably a horcrux.” The Headmaster presented the box to Harry with an apprehensive look on his face. “I cannot destroy it on my own, and while I do not enjoy asking for assistance, this is the most achievable solution which I have been able to reach.”
Missy threw her body against the glass once more, trying and failing to make the gesture look collected or controlled.
Draco hesitated, staring down at the ground as he tried to keep himself from remembering the experience of nearly dying. His hand moved up, placing it over his stomach, which had gotten the worst of the impact from the spell, thus being the place where he was scarred the worst. In the end, he moved his other hand, and carefully placed it on top of the former Gryffindor’s cold fingers, finally deciding that he actually wanted to touch the other back. “It’s alright.” He confirmed in a small voice.
“You’re right, how could I have been so wrong?” Draco trailed his fingers upwards, following Harry’s spine up to his shoulders, where he squeezed the back of his neck softly. As if Harry needed more reasons to shudder with delight and excitement. “I have a birthday present for you, if you will allow me to collect it for you?”
Remus smiled and nodded. “I have a call scheduled with her tomorrow night, we will be sure to plan that out then.”
Malfoy Manor rose up before them like a beast without chains, cold, threatening and uncaring. The windows may be lit but it did not assist the house in appearing less threatening. If anything, the many windows transformed into a myriad of eyes which focused on her and upon her family, as the creature of a building threatened to swallow them up and crush them.
,” Harry spoke the title out loud. “You kept it all these years?”
The venture of speaking began with Lavender. Even if Ron would rather have chosen to delay that conversation for perhaps ten years, he also feared ending up like his mum and dad if he simply continued the way things were. While it was slightly paranoid to think that he’d end up in a ragged old house with seven children and a wife whom he couldn’t make happy, Ron still felt the pressing need to do something, rather than nothing. Nothing might have been good for a while, but it was no longer good enough.
“Sheesh…” Harry mumbled as he leaned back against Draco, feeling his cheeks heat yet again. He solved the problem of heating cheeks by burying his nose in Draco’s familiar scent. “Well, he didn’t exactly give me a golden snake ring for my birthday.” Harry chuckled into his boyfriend’s shoulder. “You’re still a more accomplished man of, uh, flirt.”
“Quite done there,” Draco let go of his creation which was usually referred to as ‘Hermione’s hair’ and handed her a mirror through which she might admire his work. “What do you think?”
“I’ll go find Nessie,” Andromeda announced as he began to feel awkward surrounded by Pink Floyd fans.
“A vampire,” Colin didn’t miss a beat.
The Dark Lord continued to smile, studying Severus while making no attempt to hide that he enjoyed the pain which his words caused.
“I think that there are people far worse than you,” Pat objected. “People who kill and hurt others, who beat their partners or neglect their children. I think that there are monsters out there who are beyond anything that you and I could ever be, and there is no divine retribution coming for them. You are allowed things even if you think horrible or mean things, even if you do perform actions that hurt others. I don’t think people should hurt one another, of course!” She quickly added.
The truth was evident, there was little to deny the fact that the experimental resurrection magic had somehow connected the Dark Lord and the blood donor: Harry Potter. The boy-who-lived and the boy who should have died at the Riddle graveyard as an eye witness to his secret return, yet who escaped because Pettigrew, for all that he was capable of, was not actually loyal.
Pat held back from asking about her blood status, as she would otherwise have done before she even considered answering the other. She turned away from the other woman and opened the locker where she kept her uniform before slipping the key back into her sock where she knew it was safe. They were all alone, she could at the very least listen, she supposed…
“Uh, ah, me?” Ron mumbled as his cheeks slowly turned redder. He licked his lips before quickly averting his gaze out the window as the group of friends focused on him.
“You don’t think that… he will hate me for this…?” She took a deep breath to steady herself as she dried her eyes with Harry’s tissue.
“Then are you afraid of him not listening to you?” Ngo-Kwang tried again. Her voice was calm and patient, never demanding and never loud.
Professor Slughorn appeared uncertain once more. Harry made him uncomfortable, that much was evident, but Neville had no idea as to why that was. As he studied the nervous man opposite of him, who was carefully sipping his tea, Neville realised that he could simply ask the Potions Professor. All he needed to do was gather the courage to do so.
The following day, Draco assured himself of the fact that Harry was no longer under the influence of the truth serum before they headed to the Great Hall with Teddy, who had accepted Goyle’s apology with relieved joy. Teddy still refused to forgive Crabbe, and he told both Harry and Draco that he wasn’t going to take his outburst back in any manner. The two boyfriends found that to be completely fair as Crabbe truly had overstepped his boundaries to a rather extreme degree.
The two mages smiled at one another, both of them feeling as if they could breathe for the first time in years.
Harry’s smile was weak, but nonetheless there as he gave the old hat a thankful look. “So he won’t be… upset with me if I don’t react calmly about matters?”
“We wanted to protect you,” Sirius quietly spoke up. “All of us. We did not do right by you, yet none of us wanted to harm you with our actions.”
Not to mention, Harry didn’t want to leave his dad or the rest of his friends behind and leave to a foreign country with a language he didn’t know. Draco at the very least knew French, which meant that he would be able to communicate with people, while Harry would simply lock himself away from the world to be with his best friend.
“No, see, not when combined with this…” he pointed in return.
The two teams went to shower after their game, allowing the three observers to happily scurry inside as well, where they waited for Draco and Ron in the entrance hall. They positioned themselves closer to the Great Hall, as more warmth came from those closed doors than the entrance doors to Hogwarts. Thus, Harry had proved to himself that he could attend an at least sort of Quidditch game without anything bad happening.
Ron Weasley had grown taller since Harry saw him last, as well as stronger. It was hard to see through his clothes, but when he moved, there was a control and strength to his movements, revealing that he must have been working out during the summer. He had cut his hair short, opting for almost shaved sides with a more ruffled top. Ron appeared serious about getting into the Quidditch team this year, almost everything about him loudly spoke for that he was an athlete. However, there was a slight awkwardness to all that he was, as if Ron himself still hadn’t quite grown into the person he wanted or was trying to become.
“Team there-goes-more-House-points,” Hermione chuckled as she smiled softly at Ron. “I’m so happy that you are awake. I missed you,” she confessed in a quiet voice.
“By that logic, they might also approach friends and other family who might have kept their wands for them,” Harry followed up on his boyfriend’s reasoning.
“Do you think I… Did I say something that hurt her? Lavender isn’t her secret bully or anything?” Ron nervously fumbled with his scarred fingertips as he spoke.
“Oh yes, vampires too,” Sirius grinned, leaning his head to the side. “Werewolves are generally seen as a blood sickness, even if people still discriminate against them, while vampires are basically categorised as magical creatures.”
George felt his expression twist into one of despair, and he quickly lowered his head, hoping that his hair would hide his emotions. It was too late, the expression had already been noticed by the janitor.
No sound came from the upper floors.
“Speaking of Fred and George though,” Teddy separated from Ron after he was defeated by an arm lock. “I wanted to ask them something this morning, but didn’t have the time to. Do you guys mind if I just go chat with them real quick?”
Perhaps the answer wasn’t to choose between the icon and the person, but instead make certain that the icon was not a different part of the person. Rather than attempting to be Harry Potter, perhaps Harry Lupin could become the icon instead.
Nonetheless, the Dark Lord loathed the man and most of his actions, as many of them made him feel disgusted and repulsed to his very core. Not even Bellatrix would force herself upon another in such scarring, horrifying and forcefully intimate manners. Because Greyback had no such qualms, the Lycan became somebody which The Dark Lord could neither feel pity nor respect for, as his very being disgusted him. Not because he was a werewolf, but because he was a predator towards those in his surroundings.
Soon enough, he found himself seated in the armchair which had previously been in Severus' other office, curled together with a slightly too warm cup of tea. Harry took in the view of the office which had yet again changed with its new inhabitant as Severus sat down by his desk with a cup of his own.
Colin grabbed Harry’s arm and pulled slightly on it as Hermione yanked Neville awake from his feeling of disbelief. Harry was struggling to hear over the noises of the mass hysteria which was spreading like fiendfyre.
Molly usually never asked things of Arthur, since she knew that work was hard and that he was not happy to be stuck as an overworked pet of the British Ministry of Magic. For all of their years together, she hadn’t asked a lot of him except for a few small favors in shopping or removing magical infestations in the garden. Then, all of a sudden, Molly had asked him to come to Lucius Malfoy’s home. As if she wanted to be friends with those stuck up Purebloods and their values! Arthur was angry with her, as he could not help but feel betrayed because Lucius Malfoy would definitely flaunt all his wealth and his stupid hair and mansion and everything else he had that Arthur could never, ever give Molly. Lucius loved doing things like that, things which filled no purpose but to hurt Arthur.
While his clothes were impeccable as always, there were tiny imperfections which Arthur would never have noticed unless Lucius had spent years hiding them through careful maintenance of his items and clothing, as well as pointed every one of those faults in Arthur’s appearance. There were creases in his shoes, a button was almost undone, and the collar did not lay perfectly lined with the other layers of clothing. Not to mention that he had forgotten to add his cufflinks that morning, which was something the man had always remembered until then, at least to Arthur’s knowledge.
The woman ceased her speaking, leaving Molly with her thoughts and considerations, one of which was becoming too prominent for her to hold back. “Do you love your husband?”
"Ever since childhood, Regulus had enjoyed learning about different matters of the world. He knew he couldn’t, and indeed shouldn’t, question what an authority in his life was telling him, and for the longest of time he wholeheartedly believed in the views and opinions his mother told him to believe in. However, there were times and incidents where the information didn’t quite make sense to him, and Regulus had a particularly nasty habit of catching up on those inconsistencies.
He was considering asking Bill Weasley to help him with that problem, but then he would have to show him the pictures, as well as his old room. Sirius liked Bill well enough to want him to visit again, but he wasn’t sure he wanted it to be for such a reason as to remove Sirius’ old soft pornography off the walls of his teenage bedroom.
It's rather alarming to read the Harry Potter books and find that the Slytherin children, especially the children of Death Eaters, all generally react the same and have the same, often outright evil, opinions about matters, as if their different circumstances would not matter; as if they're not people.
“Yeah, shut up about Harry, you don’t know anything!” Teddy yelled, which was the last thing Harry could remember hearing about the argument.
“I’m sure he could.” Harry glanced at his dogfather, trying to not read too much into the way the man was behaving. He knew that Sirius was still depressed, but he didn’t want to project how depressed Sirius actually was onto him.
He was already changing who he was, modelling himself after something, someone, he was not. He was already telling himself that his own feelings didn’t matter in times of war. He was already tricking those around him that he was fine when he wasn’t. He was already accepting an identity who wasn’t him, and he was letting the expectations of Harry Potter the icon shape him.
Together, they walked to the rest of the gathering of people, all of which had come to bid a final farewell to Sirius Potter before he was placed in the earth to rest.
“What’s wrong?” I do not mean to sound so hostile, but I’m too frightened to be polite, or even decent.
“I like the sound of that.” Harry agreed. “But I want to try to transform one more time, if neither of you mind?”
Pat smiled weakly as she dried her face off with her sleeve. It sounded beyond wonderful for her to escape the Slytherin House and all the people within it who had become frightening to her. It felt too easy, yet so wonderfully freeing to know that she wasn’t locked to her House, and that she was allowed to switch to blue clothes if she wanted to.
The three had collectively decided to steal the blanket which they had been using during the game, with the shared promise to make sure the blanket was returned tomorrow. The blanket was invaluable as they stood gathered within it, waiting for their friends.
Inside the picture within the frame sat a family: a mother, a father and two children. Harry recognised the woman from the portrait which was currently yelling at Bill Weasley. She held her head high, barely even moving as she stared out at the world, her body was thin and her corset tight. Next to the standing wife was the seated husband. He sat upon an expensive velvet armchair which Harry recalled seeing in what he thought was the living room. He was a very squarish man, with a sturdy body and a stone like face, his mouth almost hidden by his mustache. However, upon his lap, on one leg each sat two children. Harry recognised Sirius by his smile, and he recognised Regulus by the green eyes which appeared to be unique to only him out of the Black family.
“But he’s asleep…” Colin shifted uncomfortably where he stood. “She wouldn’t blame him for speaking Malfoy’s name in his sleep, right? The last thing he probably remembers is trying to save him, how could she be pissed about that?”
“Do I look like I’ve been able to play for the past three or so years?” He asked sharply, glaring at the other man. In a vain attempt to restore himself into something resembling proper, he reached up to readjust his hair.
“I’m not the Dark Lord,” Harry insisted, his gaze resting upon the Potions Master. “I admit that there are similarities, but I can assure you that he’s just the next person on the list of people who I resemble. I’ve been hearing that I look like such and such many times throughout my life. Frankly, and most respectfully, sir, Tom Riddle is just another resemblance to add to the list.”
Of course, Christian based traditions and wedding vows are not a standard and would have been strange in a community not influenced by such tradition to that big a degree. Thus, the traditions remind of regional wedding traditions while also incorporating their own cultural touches.
“Yeah, right…” Ron mumbled.
Professor Snape glanced at the collection of documents and notes before he turned his full attention to Harry. “It is customary that I begin to ask you if there are any particular jobs, or types of education which you would like to pursue. If you find yourself at a loss, I will suggest some lines of work which might be suitable for you. Or we can start with what subjects you enjoy and what types of careers may be pursued connected to those.”
“I want answers,” Harry agreed. “In fact, I have a lot of questions and I have been writing them down to remember them. There are plenty of things I feel like you should explain to me in detail. That being said,” Harry stopped to take a deep breath before he continued. “You helped my dad when nobody would. You allowed him to attend Hogwarts, you assisted him in being allowed care of me. You saved Hagrid, you hired Filch, you allowed Firenze to remain at Hogwarts. You took Dobby in as well, and you’ve been a support to me when I have been reckless or faulty. A few months ago, you even saved Draco by healing him, despite being drained from the duel. I know that you’ve always cared about people, even if you haven’t always managed to express it or handle the complex situations around other people. If you tell me that you are running out of options, I will believe you and offer my assistance. I don’t want another war, and your path is the only one I could even remotely support in comparison to the Death Eaters and the Ministry.”
“Oh no, not at all!” Ngo-Kwang hurriedly informed her. “You’re my friend and I like you. Having you attempt to pronounce my name is rather… sweet, really.”
There was a knock on the door to their compartment, which interrupted most of the conversations which were taking place within it. The group of friends turned towards the door, watching it slide open to reveal Colin Creevy.
“Oh,” against better judgement, I feel myself leaning forward as I listen to him. “Would you tell me more?”
“Please do not tell me that you make jam for a li-”
Mrs. Weasley blinked at the young man, who was about her own height. “He left yesterday night, but he allowed me to stay since there was quite the snowstorm in this part of the country.” When she realised that she had no real reason to be there, she hesitated but then continued in a weak voice. “I was sent here by Arthur to deliver a highly time sensitive report to the Professor. He left right away.” Perhaps she only did so because Remus and Harry were both, technically, members of the Order of the Phoenix as well.
Fred turned his head away with an angry huff, which led him to notice that Harry and Draco had entered the room. He shifted uncomfortably, causing George to notice that they were there as well. The latter twin bit his lower lip hard, glanced back at his brother and then pushed himself past the two boyfriends. The door opened and closed with a harsh slam, leaving the room almost echoing with the emptiness which followed.
--- Facts & Headcanons ---
Thus, Bellatrix attacking and almost causing him to bleed to death was the last thing which they needed as a group.
A soft mewling came from the luggage shelf. Harry looked up to see Crookshanks, Hermione’s cat, sleepily climb on top of Neville’s bag and make himself comfortable.
Arthur had never been like this before. He was like a completely different man. So very unlike the failed, absent father who had continued to leave his children and wife behind until they had enough. So very unlike the man who Percy was ashamed to share surname with. Percy reasoned that something must have happened to Arthur, or that he had been taken over by an impostor who was doing a most terrible job appearing like the former Head of the Muggle centered department.
“Nevermind that,” Andromeda hurried to speak over the other woman in an attempt to bring her attention back to Sirius. “My cousin is innocent? Was he not a mass murderer?”
“Not a problem.” Ron did as requested off him, lifting the snake off the jar.
Sirius had been so many things to Peter, things he likely did realise but also didn’t care about. He had been an idol, an inspiration and a comfort, yet he had also been cruel, a source of insecurity and a constant reminder that Peter was not actually good enough for them. Peter was a charity case, one which his friends were stuck with as they were too good people to simply abandon him, even if they may have wanted to.
Harry hesitated to continue speaking, but he managed to gather enough courage to vocalise his fears. “I think… I’m experiencing what it is like to be resurrected through such a ritual as the one I witnessed. I’m not just imagining what it could be like, it’s too… real. Far too real. My dreams have never been very detailed, and even when they have some details I do recall, I can’t remember them with this clarity. Especially not physically.”
“It’s so hot…” Harry whined, shaking his head. “It’s just morning and I’m already not looking forward to the day.”
A note on circuits is that unlike certain other various fantasy lore using them as actual sigils which are concrete, can be replaced and removed etc, this is merely a name for whichever part of the nervous system connects to the ability to wield magic.
“Thank you,” Neville nodded and smiled once more before he returned to his own seat next to Victor. On the way there, he locked eyes with Harry and smiled, confirming to Harry that he truly had known that it was them all along.
The Bulgarian wizard frowned, “no, I’m one of the best-mages.”
“You might wanna jump into the water as well,” Chang turned towards Pat and helped her up to her feet. “You look like you could use a good soak.”
Hermione repeated the sentiment to Victor and so they sat off towards the altar and the seats surrounding it. All the while, Hermione rambled at Victor about all that she wanted to tell him but which a short letter didn’t really allow. There proved to be a lot of things to say in the span of two years which she had not managed to write about. Neville, Ron and Teddy followed them, engaged into a conversation which Hermione didn’t hear over her own retelling of her own vices and, some would say, adventures. Victor appeared to relax the more she talked as he didn’t take his eyes off her lips, perhaps trying to read that which he could not hear. Yet Hermione had no trouble with his gaze upon her face. After all, Victor had, with the exception of Neville, been the first to know what she had been ashamed to share, and he hadn’t let her down once in the time in which they had known one another. Thus, she relaxed as well, and simply allowed herself to speak.
The man accepted Harry’s words with a nod, as he continued to study his work. Harry found it oddly relaxing to be in the same room as someone who was working despite his presence, and he allowed himself to breathe in the scents of the familiar and unchanged office until the smell of roses had fully left his system.
Severus scoffed at the idea, but he did not turn.
“I need you to try and call in every mage we can get, even those who are asleep or about to go home,” Arthur looked up at her, his gaze must have been rather wild since she almost flinched back from him. “But I immediately need Dedalus Diggle to come to my office, please fetch them.”
We have long since struggled with that part of our relationship. Every time I attempt to motivate myself to hug him, I find reasons and excuses not to. It might have been that I have frightened him away from touching me altogether, but at this point, I do not know how to mend it. The awareness that my own son cannot find it within him to touch me without my permission, even when I need it the most, makes my panic worse. I push my face against the floorboards, struggling to breathe as I push the newspaper towards my almost adult son. I can’t look at it again.
“I think it has more to do with the company than the alcohol, dad.” Harry pulled on a plate which Remus had simply been holding for a while.
“He’s marrying Professor Snape?” Colin leaned his head to the side and grinned as Harry nodded enthusiastically at him. “You will have two dads? That’s really cool, I hope the Professors are happy together.”
“Oh yeah… I thought you were just crazy,” the sister mocked her brother with a crooked smirk.
Severus opened the door with an emotionless expression on his face. Yet as soon as he spotted Harry, his expression appeared to soften and he stepped aside, showing for Harry to come inside. As soon as Severus had closed the door, Harry overstepped his boundaries and more of less fell into the older man’s arms, hugging him tightly. He hadn’t truly planned for what happened next, but before he knew it, he was crying against his future step-dad’s chest.
“Share what with me, Horace?” Al stood up from his desk and walked around it, stopping in the middle of the room. “Is there a reason you are keeping my students from meeting with me?”
“I try,” Harry sighed. He was quiet for a second and then continued to speak, “how is Albus doing?”
Luna had run from the battle.
“Harry, before you leave, I have every ability to bring you back to your father over the weekend, should you wish to see him after your detention.” The lover of a werewolf continued to address said werewolf’s son.
Pat felt stressed.
Harry frowned, “why would that be cruel?”
Slughorn noticed that Harry was looking at the frames, and he eagerly leaned forward as his House Elf placed a tray of tea and biscuits upon the short but elegant mahogany table in front of Harry and Albus.
At the mention of his beloved, Sirius turned away from the other man before hiding his face in his hands, shaking his head as grief threatened to tear him apart. It was sudden and it was unforgiving. “I’m sorry… I couldn’t protect him… It’s my fault…” he whispered, his voice breaking repeatedly throughout the sentences.
Sirius glanced at him through his fingers, hoping that his long hair was covering up most of his expression. Sirius had no idea what he might look like, or what expression he was currently making, but he hoped that it was nothing like any smug or demeaning expression he had shown Snape when he was a teenager. Somehow, it felt really obvious that Snape would not have been like him, not actually.
Unaware of me, the Headmaster tells me an address which likely belongs to an orphanage, as well as a name.
His desire causes my heart to throb with pain.
“Hey, sorry to bother you?” Ron whispered.
It felt relieving to laugh, Pat felt like she really needed it.
The two of them were stopped outside of Harry’s room by Remus’ voice, coming from the office which was more or less located in the attic. “Harry? Did Draco arrive yet?”
“Comes from someone as handsome as you, what can I do but blush?” Harry quickly retorted as the two of them came to a halt on top of a landing.
Harry nodded along with the descriptions. He would have been upset about the rejection had it not been for the fact that Mr. Filch’s cheeks had become slightly red, and Mrs. Norris was lazily stroking herself against Harry’s legs to show her appreciation. If she had been a normal cat and not a possible long since transformed and never transformed back animagus, Harry would have petted her. Yet as the possibility was there, he kept his hands to himself.
Harry shook his head.
“Well…” Umbridge looked around the students as if she was expecting them to join her in speaking down to the man who was dating a werewolf.
In the end, the lunch was much appreciated, even if it was simple. Professor Snape had brought raspberries and strawberries, which prompted the question if he could actually read minds from a distance as well. Harry didn’t think he could, but it was fun to joke about it.
The Dark Lord heard stray whispers from the crowd below, many of whom expressed concern about being at Malfoy Manor when Lucius Malfoy had betrayed them, or at the very least failed to show loyalty when he should have. It appeared that many were worried and distrusting of the Malfoys, and with rather good reasons. As their leader, it was his duty to ease their hearts and minds.
“No, it’s about far more than that.” Molly agreed with a collection of small nods. She then settled on a slightly more serious expression, “however, I’m not sure that we can separate right now. I want to be able to leave and allow you to do what you want, but… This household cannot remain and-”
Yet Harry wasn’t that snake.
Harry blinked before he smiled, patting Neville on the arm to show that he wasn’t upset. “It’s not your fault. I’m simply glad that it didn’t get to me as well. Or Al. It was probably good that he wasn’t there.”
On top of that, there has always been, and will always be, people who are exceptions. It's simply that in great numbers of people, and through mutation and evolution being entirely random, somebody will develop in a manner which others do not.
The Slytherin and Gryffindor game was scheduled on a weekend in October, but Harry had no intentions of attending. Instead, he decided to remain in the Room of Requirement, which had become their hideaway from the rest of Hogwarts and its students. That way, Harry had to deal with the students, rumors and discomforts as little as possible. Thus, after wishing both Draco and Ron good luck during breakfast, Harry and Lovegood both returned to the Room of Requirements.
Fred licked his lips, “does that mean you don’t want to open a joke shop anymore?”
Potter waved his hand and closed the door, leaving just as the House Elf returned with their tea. The white and golden flower cups were placed around the table, accompanied by their saucers and with tissues. A plate of biscuits was added to the table before the House Elf left once more, accompanied by thankful voices. Ginny was relieved to learn that whatever tea Teddy had chosen smelled good at the very least. It was too hot to drink right away, but the first sensory impression had been good for Ginny.
The memories had answered a lot of questions which Harry had in regards to Tom. No, the Dark Lord. Tom wasn’t actually his name anymore and Harry had never known him by that name in the first place. However, for all that he currently knew, and all that he had learned, Harry still had questions. He wanted to ask those questions rather than ponder about what he had experienced. It was simply too much and a little too complex to detangle alone, even if Harry was to think about it now.
“Indeed, very good for your health.” Professor Dumbledore agreed as he appeared to float into the dining hall, disappearing out of sight and leaving the two sisters alone.
“If the bar and music is good, maybe you could bring your father with you sometime later? I’m sure it is a break which Arthur needs, since his new duties at the Ministry are keeping him busy.”
Harry sighed happily with relief as he looked down upon his own hands. It felt incredibly good to return to being himself, so much so that Harry gave himself a hug without thinking, smiling happily as he sat down upon Percy Weasley’s old and Hermione’s current bed. “Body sweet body,” Harry cooed.
Draco would be coming over that Monday, as the full moon would pass the next few days. Remus was worried that he might transform two nights in a row this month, and did not expect to be able to host another teenager afterwards. The two lovers had already discussed the possibility of a second full moon the next night, and Severus had already planned on returning with one more bottle of the Lycanthropy Potion. He had ideally wanted to brew it today, and return with it tomorrow as he joined Albus Dumbledore during Harry’s check up, but his plans had to be adjusted.
Pat simply pouted at her. She didn’t know what else to do. “Can we talk about something else? I don’t want to have another breakdown.”
Remus had believed all those things about the werewolf when he was younger, how could he not, seeing as he was one of those child victims which the community was speaking of?
“I just wanted you to know that if you need to talk,”
“No.”
“Imagine if the people with all the weapons were to learn of us. They would not want us to be. So we have to hide to protect ourselves from people who would want to throw us into madhouses or worse.” I try to explain it to him in a direct manner which won’t leave him frightened or confused as I leave. “You won’t have to hide at Hogwarts. There, you are allowed to be yourself with people like you.”
The Order was out of options, that much Remus knew. Professor Dumbledore had tried many ways in which to find a way to destroy the Dark Lord before the supposed assault and threat to the Malfoy family, and they were out of options. They couldn’t prolong it longer either, as Severus had witnessed that the Dark Lord had rushed Draco and decided upon a date sooner. It all felt crushingly hopeless, and beyond uncomfortable.
Harry saw Sirius fall and the rescue of his body after he was hit by the green flash of the killing curse. He heard various voices cry the name of the fallen man, and he saw his dad abandon the battle to run to the side of his best friend. More than that, Harry saw who had cast the killing curse, and he knew that Draco had seen it too, seeing as he had not hesitated to follow the person out through the tunnel in an attempt to chase her down and very probably attempt to enact vengeance upon her.
Albus smiled softly as he called a chair to him and sat down opposite of Harry but with no desk between them. The lack of the obstacle felt significant to Harry, as if he and the old wizard were truly friends, two people on the same level, rather than anything close to what they had been when they first met.
“She did let Sirius in,” George commented without any real investment in his voice.
Harry tried not to stare, as he didn’t want to discourage the other from doing what he wanted. “Would you want to come with me to the library? I want to look over the books.” Spending time with Kreacher allowed Harry something to busy himself with, as the silence of the large house made it far too easy to get lost in memories. “Unless you have work, that is.”
He wasn’t even the same color.
“As do I…” Narcissa admitted.
Percy had been one of few constants in George’s life, something he could always rely on being there, and someone who acted as if following a script.
“It appears that our dear detested cousin was actually innocent of his supposed crimes, why Bella… She is indeed guilty, even if I do doubt the guilt of that young man and Rabastan. I did not know the former, but Rabastan was never a violent or particularly magically inclined man. Good head, but not a particularly outstanding mage.”
Remus simply laughed in response.
As they all spread out to one mat each, Harry ended up between Hermione and Neville, staring at the X marked location before him. He decided that it would be suspicious if he was that accomplished in something he should know nothing about, and thus he opted to pretend to fail a few times as the rest of his year struggled to even begin to spread their magic evenly over their bodies.
Thus, Hermione began to carefully instruct her friend in how he should go about manipulating his magic and make it take shape over him, rather than simply having it drift away to join the general magic of the atmosphere. Ron listened to her every word, nodding or shaking his head when he did or did not understand what she was attempting to say. It took a little bit of time, but when Hermione was finished, Ron appeared less clueless.
“Oh, all the time. Me thi, I thinks, no, think, that the previous Master enjoyed watching me struggle.” Dobby struggled through another sentence, actively trying to break his speech pattern as they walked towards the Forbidden Forest upon the path which was free of ice. “But that is in the past!” Dobby declared hastily when he noticed that the blonde wizard appeared troubled. “I shall not be burdened by that when I am currently having fun walking with the two mast… I mean, friends?” He looked hopeful as he spoke the word.
“I never thought about it like that,” I agree, “but more than anything, they were killing us too with those actions. It wasn’t simply to protect the Muggle women, but to protect us as well. Not to mention, they weren’t only burning and hanging women, but other genders too.”
Thus, the Dark Lord turned towards the animagus, who had been given ample time to regain his dignity. “Since when does my supposed plan entertain the incarceration of children?”
For the first time in the history of the school, every common room was open to anyone and everyone without any password needed as the safety and comfort of the students was prioritised. As the Headmaster himself phrased it, “you have all suffered from your forced separation for too long. Go where you wish and speak to whoever you want, be unrestrained in the fact that at Hogwarts, we are indeed not only our labels, but united through magic and comradery.”
“He was similar when I met him,” Severus’ smiled weakly. “After our, well… argument, we were apart for a while. I was mostly judging him to try and conclude if he had any ulterior motives. When I realised that he did not, I approached him once more and asked to speak. I won’t share what we talked about, but we talked for hours until…” His voice trailed off. “Well, until I dared trusting his intentions. Thus, I gained my first and only partner in life. That is not to say that I haven’t been with other people, but I never had a committed relationship with anyone else. How… silly it sounds when I say it out loud. It was not that I was waiting for him but… But I suppose Remus truly is the only person to ever make me feel… Safe, loved, use whatever description you will. I do not know how he does it, but he does.” Severus concluded in a small, emotional voice.
Unbeknownst to Harry, Ron had made an effort of calling Colin and telling him about the situation with Draco. That meant that Colin knew not to speak of the fact that Harry’s best friend was missing from their group, while also understanding the rough reasons as to why that was. In conclusion, it meant that Colin didn’t speak of Draco, or asked about him, but focused on other things. Amusing, distracting, things. With Luna Lovegood spending time with Ginny and her friends, and Draco being absent, Colin was able to sit with them throughout the entire journey.
Harry breathed in through his nose, then out through his mouth. “I’m quite ready.”
Bill simply looked surprised but then nodded as a smile formed on his lips, “that doesn’t sound so bad. I’m curious to know if he has changed like you say he has.”
Together, Harry and Colin walked outside of the castle, and began exploring the grounds for photo locations. The winter air was just as fresh, but slightly more cold than Harry had imagined yesterday. Like he decided, he had allowed his hair to be released from all hair ornaments and hairbands. He also allowed the homemade, hand knitted hat to cover up his forehead and scar.
“How come you cannot cite a friend to inherit money or, uh, things from you?” Harry asked Sirius, frowning to himself.
“Ah, yes indeed,” Albus agreed. “I know that now. I spoke carelessly. You are correct.”
Suddenly, something hit Harry and his smile faded. “Hey, Draco, how much do you know about the Felix Felicis potion?” He hadn’t had a chance to see Hermione for a few days, and he realised something the other day that he had really wanted to talk to someone more competent in magic about.
After adding his plate and fork to the self washing dishes, Kreacher turned towards Harry. As their eyes met, Harry noticed hesitation in the large, brown orbs which were Kreacher’s eyes. “Kreacher should mention to Master that he will bring him to the former Mistress’ abode, will that be acceptable?”
“I don’t know about… Well, I suppose that…. Yes, I agree but…” Molly stumbled through her sentences until she came to an end.
George preferred to pretend that the conversation never happened.
“It was so strange without you!” Teddy agreed.
Harry considered the request for a few moments before he smiled and nodded. “Of course, if that is what makes you feel the best. May I speak to the Sorting Hat about it?”
The instructors noticed now, and the two of them got a small scolding before being left alone once more. Somehow, Hermione didn’t feel terrible about it, but instead felt rather excited about having fun for what felt like the first time in a long while.
“There is but one thing which can cause me to betray you, and that would be if my partner or his son came to harm. Any other action, I can forgive, and I can continue my work. Yet if my partner is harmed, I will not remain by your side.” Severus was not quite certain what prompted him to speak in that manner to the Dark Lord himself. By all means, it was foolish, and he should not make ultimatums, yet it was too late. The words had left his mouth, and the Dark Lord was studying him with an amused look upon his face.
I guide El to the Aurors I know personally, the ones who will take care of him and assure that he is sent to a safe cell far away from his extreme followers in America. I do not wish to let go of his arm, but El is taken from my grasp. He turns to look at me, grinning cheekily as he is removed from my life. He is smiling in the manner I always pictured him to smile at the altar, his heavenly eyes sparking with mischief and love as he sneers back at me.
“Huh?” George found himself blinking at the question before he shrugged and then licked his lips while avoiding the gaze of his twin. “Nothing, I was just thinking.”
Harry picked up a letter from Hermione and opened it, before he leaned back in his chair and started to read it. It was a rather recently received letter after Hermione had been allowed to attend something the Muggles called a Pride Parade together with Arthur, Neville, Ron and Teddy. The letter itself was very long and detailed, which really was just making Harry rather happy, as it meant Hermione had a great time, and wanted to share it with him in its entirety.
Once the broken envelope was complete, Sirius opened it. There was more than one letter inside of it, but they were all written in Regulus’ handwriting. At least there was nothing from his mother. Sirius thought of Harry’s expression as he had given him the letter, and decided to only read the first lines before actually setting it on fire, despite the heat outside the window.
“That’s… Huh…” Sirius sniffed before he reached out to have some more wine. After he had allowed the alcoholic beverage to run down his throat and poison his brain with some more bravery, he spoke, “to me, she always looked kind of pissed. I always felt kind of secure in the fact that she didn’t like him, or us. It was a surprise to everyone when she suddenly decided that she liked James. Yet afterwards, James changed. He never became quite… fun, again. It sounds childish when I say it out loud, but… It’s what I thought.”
“They don’t necessarily have to have gone anywhere together. They could have spread out or gone their separate ways.” Draco calmly pointed out.
“It won’t be that way… America doesn’t have a gathering of mages. We’d become lambs for the slaughter, deaths in waiting. It’s too impossible… You cannot overthrow Muggles who are already fighting a brutal war for freedom and justice and all those beautiful, ignorant things.” I pull away from El’s grasp, shaking my head as I flee from the reckless ideas which he is attempting to convince me of.
“So it… can’t be helped?” Arthur frowned as he absentmindedly chewed on his lower lip.
The other man was cleanly shaved, and his skin was as dark as the other was pale. He was dressed in beautiful, expensive but altogether shapeless robes of clothing, complete with a matching hat. His neck was long and covered in heavy, intricately decorated necklaces which stacked to make his neck even longer than it might have appeared naturally. His hands and his wrists were equally covered with gold, and his eyes had a golden sheen to them. His hair was braided into something distinctly traditional, at least somewhere. Harry got the strong impression that the man was Persian, which was in fact correct, only he was not just any man.
“What? Well, I suppose so, but that really isn’t important in the situation at hand with the risk of war and oppression,” Hermione shook her head before she looked down at the book once more. “We could all use the notes. It doesn’t matter who gets close enough to Professor Slughorn and convinces him to cooperate with Professor Dumbledore. Besides, if we put all that pressure on Harry, we have no back up plan in case he would fail for whatever reason. Thus, we should all try and learn what we can from these notes, and all strive to get close enough to Professor Slughorn. Whoever manages doesn’t matter, as we all want the same thing in the end.”
“Did Draco style it today?” Hermione asked as she inspected Harry’s half put up hair, which had been gathered away from his face in a ponytail but which didn’t collect all the hair but let some hang down around his neck.
Harry turned back towards Albus, speaking in but a weak whisper, “did the snake appear anything like this?”
“I thought that it would be cleared out legally,” he continues as pain seeps into every crevice and wrinkle in his face. “As I had done nothing wrong, but I was tricked by the court system, and they locked me away. My followers managed to save me about a year ago, I think, and I have been on the run since then. For a while, we managed to gather more followers, but… Not all of them were loyal. I was almost stabbed… It’s fuzzy, I tried to… and then the person lay before me, neck broken from the fall. She was so young, Al… I promise you I never wanted to hurt her…” The story becomes less coherent as he recollects how he killed a person, more by accident than intention.
Overall, Colin had a very great time at the Slug Club Yule party.
Under the covers within Draco’s bed, within Draco’s room, his and Harry’s lips met shyly yet shameless and without guilt. It was early morning, they had yet to be called down to breakfast, and in the absence of other duties, they two had elected to engage in breathless exploration of the other. They both knew what the other looked like without clothes to some extent, as they had lived with one another for the good part of almost five year, and longer due to their regular visits to the other’s home. Further, they had shared beds for so many years that they both struggled to sleep alone. Yet despite their honest desire to be close and to generally touch the other, there were aspects of the other’s body which they did not know, and wanted to know. That desire was somewhat different from their day to day life spent with one another, and not always present when they were physically close with one another, yet this morning was a day when it was.
“I really don’t know that,” Neville’s voice was patient and gentle as he spoke to her in a tone which he only used when they were alone. “Granted, I’m not an expert, but if somebody acts like Lavender does, I feel rather confident in saying that something isn’t right in the relationship.”
Severus nodded, agreeing with Remus’ statement. “Not to discuss the work which would go into formulating a new curriculum for teaching seven different years in three months or less, seeing as that would be around the time a new teacher would be given to prepare for their new position.”
“Oh. Yes. Of course.” Ron joined in with the chuckling before he reached out to grab some food for his plate.
Narcissa Malfoy led her husband up the stairs to the second floor, then to their gathering. Everyone looked towards the two of them as the disheveled and starved Lucius Malfoy dared glance towards the Dark Lord. What an awfully pathetic thing he had become. He almost pitied the traitor with the patience of a parent.
Remus returned the hug, but then changed his mind and lifted Sirius up, bringing him with him to the table and let Sirius cling to him while he was sitting down. He could already feel the smaller man shake as tears and choked sobs escaped from him. This wasn’t the first time Remus had held his friend when he cried, and it probably wouldn’t be the last. He didn’t mind so much, even though part of him felt like maybe he should.
“Is it true that there have been physical punishments delivered to the students in the past?” Draco appeared to have recalled something from his past as well, thus directing the question towards Hagrid as the opportunity arose.
The door isn't simply different for looks, but is an advanced direct teleportation unit between the Department of Mysteries and the Ministry of Magic. The department itself is located far from London, deep underground, where any accident with horrifying, unpredictable magic could not threaten the cities ad people. It would rather be madness to keep all of its contents locked away in a regular department in such a central place as the Ministry.
Professor Slughorn nodded, concluding that Pat hadn’t wanted anything either since she didn’t speak up about it. “It is my belief that an outside source may be just as useful as the one who experienced the hurt, as long as the affected does not mind being spoken up for. Seeing as she is currently this shaken, forcing information out of her simply wouldn't be fair.” The man shook his head as he focused on Ngo-Kwang once more. “Go ahead dear, tell me what I may help you with.”
Narcissa sat down on one bench, prompting Andromeda to hesitantly sit down on the other end of the aisle. The two sat silent for a few minutes before Andromeda chuckled to hide her confusion over the likely heavy and emotional conversation which they were about to engage in.
“Hello,” Harry leaned over to hug Luna in a greeting. “Congratulations!”
Albus couldn’t belong to the Hufflepuff House.
Goyle was silent in return as he thought about her inquiry. “I don’t know, but… I don’t really like the way he has been acting recently.” With simply the two of them, the dog, and the forest, Goyle opted to be truthful. “I don’t like what he is doing to Draco. There have been times when Draco hasn’t come back to the dormitory all night, simply stays out and then comes back around class, seemingly without eating breakfast. Vince says it’s fine, but it doesn’t seem fine to me.”
Harry nodded once more, smiling at them both. He did not trust his voice to carry his feelings, so he trusted his face to communicate for him.
To help understand the historical political situations in this chapter, as it is a reflection of real history, here's some interesting bits of information.
“Oh, so it’s the difference between drinking water and soda?” Colin spoke up with excitement as he had understood something. “Soda can technically help you function, and even give you energy, but at the end of the day, your body still needs water. Pure water without additions, or it will be unable to take care of itself.”
--- Facts & Headcanons ---
Hermione had grabbed the man and managed to pull him over the smooth stone floor with little trouble as adrenaline and stress overpowered her physical abilities. She dragged the man towards the black door and managed to get him inside. The blood from his wound rattled many of the creatures inside the jars upon the shelves, yet she did not notice as she went about her work, attempting desperately to remember how to perform first aid, both magical and through her self taught studies by Muggle means.
“There are still some things I’d like to know, if I may ask?”
As her friend began to retell the story of what had happened to her, Pat realised something about Professor Slughorn’s actions which surprised her.
While Neville didn’t dislike Professor Slughorn as much as he had feared Professor Snape when he was a child, he was not very comfortable around the man. Unlike most plants, herbs and greenery, Professor Slughorn expected things from Neville. Things which made his vision sway with anxiety and nervousness. However, people had always expected things from Neville, both things he wanted to or even could fulfill, as well as rather impossible things, those things had nonetheless always been there, especially from his grandmother.
Thus, Harry and Hermione had been the only ones of their immediate friend group who had applied at all, and upon walking past the Defense against the Dark Arts Professor’s office, they found that neither of them had been accepted. However, Harry noted that Blaise, Crabbe, Parkinson and Goyle had all been accepted. There appeared to be some manner of bias towards Slytherin students, as Harry noticed that many more Slytherin students had been accepted than almost all other students combined.
“I want to thank you, Albus, for letting me experience that… this… Well, everything. It was interesting to experience a different time and a different setting. It was similar and it felt similar, even if there were noticeable differences in language, surroundings and the few other people but El which I saw. It’s so personal and so intimate and I feel oddly guilty having seen it, but I am thankful. Thank you so much for telling me about him.” Harry knew that he had said it before, and he knew that he was repeating himself. Yet a lifetime of hurt, fear and rejection reflected within his friend’s eyes, and Albus deserves the reassurance which Harry was capable of giving right there and then.
“I miss you.”
Harry turned towards the sofas and found them empty, which was highly confusing, seeing as Luna had just been in one of them. Harry carefully walked back into the room and searched for the Ravenclaw student. He found her hiding behind the sofa, holding on to something around her neck and through her shirt so hard that her knuckles whitened.
“You did?” Draco’s expression dared to reveal a hint of hope as Harry let go of his hand and helped him pull the sleeve back down. “That is relieving… Immensely so. I am glad that you have been busy.”
Percy groaned and hid his face against his hands, wishing that he could squeeze hatred out of his mind and do something productive with it. Like hating… Which generally couldn’t be considered productive. He sighed deeply.
If she hadn’t been a previous member of the Disciplinary Committee, if she hadn’t been on the Slytherin Quidditch team, if she hadn’t been the captain of the Slytherin team, if she hadn’t been a member of the Slug Club… If she hadn’t been Vince’s girlfriend.
“I just… Can’t…” Hermione muttered through gritted teeth before she managed to stop herself from announciating to the world how much frustration she felt from her inability to cast the charm. “More information might help, I just need to focus more, and to try harder and then I will…”
Professor Slughorn sat still as he stared into Harry’s wet eyes, as tears began to run down his cheeks. Harry hastily searched for a handkerchief in his clothing, but the one which was given to him was offered by Professor Slughorn himself.
“What I’m about to tell you is no secret, and it should not generally be capable of being used to harm the people involved. I cannot sense anyone around us either.” The old wizard did not appear particularly worried.
George and Bill liked the same type of music, and Bill had been spending time educating George in a few different Muggle activities since his return to Britain. Sometimes they would attend some event or go visit some building, but a lot of the time, the two of them would just talk. About music, about life, about loss. While it was still rather impossible for either of them to feel as if they were brothers, they were beginning to feel like they could be. With more time, George thought that it might even become easy to remember that Percy was not the eldest brother within the Weasley collective.
Arthur spoke with conviction, clearly and articulately expressing his desire to petition the Ministry to support the Albus Ward, rather than seeking legal actions against the two patients within it. He spoke about logic, purpose and the benefits of the ward, as well as how it would benefit the Ministry of Magic politically to support it through finances and donations. The science, Arthur pointed out, was cutting edge, and exactly the kind of fail-safe which the Ministry needed since it started throwing people into Azkaban without care or concern for the number of prisoners exposed to unpredictable dementors and their inhuman whims. Even the two members at the ward were the perfect candidates, as as it happened not by choice, but rather neglect. The two men at the Albus Ward had not yet faced their trials, and although publicly declared guilty, father and son Crouch could not be legally claimed guilty at the time they had been kissed. Thus, the Ministry had no rights to prevent them from being healed, as that was what was needed for their trial to happen in the first place.
“We could ask Colin to take some pictures of the snake, that would make this venture a whole lot easier.” Harry said out loud.
She smiled in return, shaking her head in positive disbelief, “you’re so very kind… Thank you.”
The group of Slytherin students approached them like a massive creature of primarily black and slightly green. Harry felt as if he could feel the ill intention upon them as if they were a hot fire, threatening to scald him as well as Colin. He quickly glanced around for a carriage, which naturally was taken as weakness by the rest of his fellow Slytherin students. Draco was moved forward alongside the rest of the group as he settled into a look of disapproval which he aimed towards Colin. It was the kind of look which Draco’s eleven year old self would have employed, but not the kind of face which the current Draco would show and mean it.
Luna let out a weak squeak as she turned to look up at him, much in the same manner Agrippa looked at Harry whenever he had accidentally startled the bird. Harry saw tears within her big eyes, which Luna quickly attempted to rub away with her sleeve, but to no avail. A package of tissues appeared by her foot without any celebrations or noise, allowing her to regain some dignity as she sniffed into one of the tissues.
“W-what?” Harry heard himself asking as he sat up more properly, giving the Ravenclaw student his full attention.
Neville experienced himself drawing a shaky breath, his mind barely capable of understanding that they might have achieved the goal they had worked so hard for during half a year. That he might have achieved it.
Harry was holding something out to him. Sirius shifted and focused on it, finding an envelope which was being offered to him. He didn’t accept it right away, instead, he studied it with a displeased frown upon his face. He recognised the handwriting upon it.
“Is it really safe to speak about that, well… here?” Harry looked around in the surprisingly clean alley. He wondered where the trash cans were, seeing as an alley generally should have some manner of trash disposal, or so Harry thought. Maybe it was different in small villages.
“Harry, would you knock on Sirius’ door? Severus needs to be let out.” Remus summarised, not wanting to dwell on the cat outside, as it made him feel bad for scaring the poor animal.
“Yeah, I was against it too first but think of it!” she hurried on, still keeping her voice low. “He’s too important, it just isn’t right. I want to listen to him and find him infallible but this is madness.”
About an hour later, the three students left Hagrid’s hut having learned everything there was to know about basilisks. While Colin hadn’t come around to love neither basilisks nor snakes, it was evident upon his person that he felt less frightened by what had truly been an animal who never intended to harm him specifically. That did not mean that Colin would have gladly become Secrets’ dinner, but at the very least, some of his worries were soothed, especially after Hagrid assured them all that the old snake had gone blind and her gaze could no longer kill.
Pat and Vince turned to find Ngo-Kwang in the entrance hall, her wand raised and pointed towards the wizard, her expression a mask of barely held back anger. Pat felt herself shiver, as more tears streamed from her face and her heart beat faster at the thought of being saved.
The thought horrified Peter, because his mother had always done the same thing to the people who had hurt him. And there Peter was, having sweets made for him in a desperate plea by a victim to be left alone. There he was, being the ‘Sirius’ he had always wanted to me, while ‘Peter’ pleaded for him to not even stop, but maybe just be a little nicer. If he could. If it wasn’t an inconvenience.
“Do not allow your confused emotions to blame him for being reasonable,” Al softly scolded him. “Mr. Creevy did what most people wouldn’t have the bravery to even think of doing. You should not blame him for that.”
Harry spotted Ginny’s red hair in the crowd, where she was accompanied by both her girlfriends, one on each arm. Somewhere to the left stood Neville, deeply engrossed in a conversation with an older witch whose hat was decorated with real plants which bloomed and retracted themselves as she spoke. Harry looked around for Hermione, but he couldn’t see her. Thus, in turn, he looked around for Slughorn as Colin carefully guided them between unfamiliar and slightly frightening adults. To his surprise, Harry spotted Cho Chang amidst the crowd, as she stood talking to Pansy Parkinson. Chang’s arms were bare, making no secret of how hard she trained. As she stood next to the more than strong Parkinsson, the two appeared like Amazons amongst a crowd of physically weak mortals. Although they were both a little too short to be fully Amazonian.
Sirius ate the food as he focused on his dad, sitting rather undignified in the chair, yet neither of them cared about that as long as he didn’t get dirt upon the leather.
“So, uh, you didn’t pick up the phone a lot this summer,” Colin led them outside of the train where he helped Harry off by offering his hand. “Not that I mind, but I did call your house a few times.”
“I think that he already has, but you might need some time apart from one another to heal. In the meantime, you should eat. If you don’t eat properly, it will be far easier to end up blaming yourself even more, and remain miserable.” Al made a gesture, magically pushing Harry’s plate closer to him, accompanied by the cup of hot cocoa.
“Can you take it out?” Harry asked Dobby as he finished admiring it. He didn’t feel particularly attracted to it, so he concluded that there was a possibility that the circlet was not a horcrux, and that if it was, it had not been hexed or charmed into making the viewer love it. Yet he was nonetheless cautious as he knew that there was a possibility that the spell might only activate once he was looking directly at the item itself, or perhaps even touching it.
Umbridge spoke some more about how she was a servant of the British mage community and was proud and humbled to have been made Headmistress. Then she finally sat down and allowed the feast to begin. It was odd for the three of them to be alone with one another, rather than to have their friends gather with them. It felt wrong and uncomfortable, and the two groups would sometimes look at one another from across the room, feeling as if the Hufflepuff table was a large chasm which separated them.
The room was very much the same room, but as it was smaller that Severus’ previous accommodation, a lot more had to be fit into a smaller space. The bookshelves were plenty and their shelves were full. Harry noticed some bottles, jars and the like which he had come to recognise, and even some titles which he had seen enough times to note their existence. The beams above them were no longer supporters for dried herbs, but a few things had been hung from them, amongst those, some faintly luminescent jars which contained crude shapes.
“Bill and Mx. Delacour arrived while you were asleep.” Remus informed him in a more formal tone than he had intended. “Although you might want to eat before you spend time with them. They are in the green parlour together with Harry and Draco, I believe George joined them as well.”
“I don’t have anything to say to you…” George muttered as he dropped the used tissue upon the ground, knowing that a House Elf could clean it up during the night.
“Pat, tell her.”
“The Divination teacher,” Lucius stated simply with a shrug. “She has attempted to replace the Magic History teacher with one Professor Grubblyplank. She will begin her years of teaching when the second term begins. Yet because of this, Umbridge has been granted the ability to fire another teacher and implement a new one. By coincidence, a centaur who happens to be a Seer is currently under the protection of Hogwarts and has been granted the position of Divination teacher until a more suitable one can be located. You know what it is like finding a Seer, yet one who is foolish enough to think that the subject can be taught.” Lucius all but rolled his eyes as he spoke of Seers. It was evident what he thought of the supposed ability to be able to see the future through the means of supposed experimental magic.
When Harry followed him with his gaze, he realised that two Aurors were standing close by, likely waiting to apprehend Mr. Malfoy as soon as they were certain that Draco was saved.
Colin laughed happily and shook his head. Colin was rather small for his age with hair in the color of either pale brown or blonde, depending on the light. His facial expressions were generally inviting and his mouth enjoyed laughing, yet his friendly and open expressions hid a loyal and sometimes frightfully determined personality with a quick witted mind. Had anyone asked Colin to describe himself, he would have said something along the lines of ‘lazy, small and gay as they come.’ At least that was what Colin had said upon finding that his patronus was a lion. However, most mages would presume his ‘gay’ statement to refer to the old meaning of the word and concluded it to mean happy, rather than that he was attracted to men. Yet Colin didn’t mind as he considered himself generally cheerful as well.
Teddy pointed at his face as Ron’s head rolled over and he continued to sleep. “Told you.”
Harry recalled the monstrous man speaking into his ear as his broken wand pressed against his neck. There was still a faint line after the scratch, but one which Harry couldn’t see unless he stared closely in the mirror towards the spot. Perhaps the Dark Lord didn’t like killing or hurting children, or as Harry preferred to see himself, teenagers. It didn’t make him good, it didn’t make him any less of a monster, but maybe it really was true that Tom Riddle had not been a monster at the time when he had first killed a person, mostly by accident.
“So this is where you’ve been…” Draco looked around in the small room, passively interested in what he was seeing. His trembling legs gave him away as tired however, and thus Harry insisted upon him sitting down on the bed, rather than remain standing in an effort to appear dignified. “It’s funny, I can see quite the number of traces of other people here, yet it is recognisably yours.” Draco laughed weakly as he studied the desk in front of him.
Harry raised his wand up high, letting the light from the tip of it fall over rows of desks which were in turn also covered in paper and folders, alongside other objects and items needed to work in a department, as well as many empty coffee mugs and teacups. The area was still and mostly silent with the exception of the teenager’s movements and whispers. With every person, another light was added to the larger room outside the office, slowly lighting up more and more of the bleak working space. The space should have been full of movement, noise and the presence of people, yet it was not. Without those impressions, the normal working environment was transformed into a threatening, empty landscape.
Albus collected himself before he slowly turned to face the reflective surface of a mirror. He looked within the surface of it, and spotted himself, as would be expected of a mirror, but the man inside it was not old and his hair and beard were a dirty blonde which sometimes appeared to almost be brown in some lighting. The man was dressed in less formless clothes where he stood by two people in a brightly lit kitchen, where the three of them lived together, far away from the world of magic and the world of the mundane.
He felt his skin burn and chill at the same time, the hair rising on his arms as a fire cracked within his stomach. He was not making the same mistake as Al. He was not becoming that type of person. He was never becoming an icon for the sake of others, never again would he accept ‘Harry Potter.’ If he was to, by some coincidence, become an icon in the future, then it would be through his own name and his own achievements. He was also never willingly losing the people he loved, and he was not going to turn away from Draco.
Harry imagined that the doors could be enchanted or cursed with any form of magic. This thought made him very hesitant to reach out and touch the shining handles on the door, inside which Harry could vaguely see his own reflection. Still, Kreacher was waiting for Harry to open the doors. Harry considered the idea that Kreacher might want him to suffer some manner of curse or hex, but once he realised just how much the reasoning sounded like Sirius’, Harry forced it out of his head. He drew a deep breath and pushed the doors open.
Harry could see Draco freeze up as he became possessed. He noticed his fingers twitching around the head of the cane. Then Draco relaxed into the act of being possessed, resigning and adapting in a manner which made him appear powerful to others, but frightened to Harry.
The witch realised what he was doing, and thus she smiled, collecting her book as she placed the teacup down. “Well,” she began, and then proceeded to tell him everything. Since he had offered to listen, she held nothing back in her reflections and thoughts. Neville came to relax for a few minutes before he returned to his work with restoring the plants through magic, while listening to her book report.
The two of them locked eyes and Victor did smile as he recognised her. He held out his muscular arms in a greeting and she happily jumped into his embrace, laughing with joy.
“Yeah, but don’t worry, Ron appears to be handling it rather well. I knew he was a good choice of Prefect.” Hermione got slightly distracted at the end of her ramble.
“We’ll inform the Headmaster.” Draco assured the Gamekeeper as he put the leash which had been hanging by the door into Fang’s collar. The dog didn’t quite look impressed with the leash, but he didn’t fight against it, nor did he object when Draco carefully pulled him along towards the door.
Some people thought that Harry had killed, or played an active part in Diggory’s death. They also suspected him to be a Death Eater, either through associations with the Malfoy family, due to being a Slytherin, or due to the way he had chosen to dress this year, or his ability to speak to snakes, or maybe even because some people considered his werewolf dad to be someone who would support the Dark Lord’s ideals. It didn’t matter what had caused it, there was enough there that Harry was considered a Death Eater by some students.
“I’m sure you do, boy-who-lived.” It didn’t sound so horrible when Draco said it like that. “If that is all, would you like me to show you around?”
Narcissa bit her lower lip as she attempted to remain dignified. Her gaze did not meet Andromeda’s, yet it was not quite averted from her. “Why have you changed your nickname for me? Are you attempting something petty by relating me to a famous Muggle monster of a lake?”
Peter felt his face heat with embarrassment and shame yet again, and he quickly glanced to the side as he bit his lower lip. “I don’t know if I…”
Harry was rather certain that he knew that to be the truth after seeing Al’s memories of the child, compared to the person in the diary, who might have been the scared teenager’s ideal version of himself, rather than what he was really like. Of course, it could also be the complete opposite, with Tom lying to everyone, and his true self being the version within the diary.
“Anyone aims anything towards me and my traitorous nephew gets it!” Bellatrix hollered as she began heading towards the door.
“Your conclusion is that with Harry as your legal godson, you would be more comfortable listing him in your will as you know that will allow your fortune to go to someone you trust?” Remus helped conclude his old friend’s fumbling speech.
Just like that, he had a date scheduled for the weekend with Fleur Delacour, or as they were known around the bank: the champion.
“You are right,” Draco sighed weakly with relief as he shrunk back upon the pillows.
Professor Dumbledore made his way around the table and reached the podium where he stopped and smiled at the students. “Everyone gathered, welcome to another year at Hogwarts, to our first years, welcome to your first year at Hogwarts, we are all very pleased to have you. Welcome here, welcome home.”
At the very least, the werewolf hadn’t gotten out through the door, but not for lack of trying. Remus could see deep scratch marks on the door, but it wasn’t the only place which had been scratched. The floor was covered in them as well, although it was mostly centered around the entrance to the room. Remus felt like he had to ask Sirius to stay with him the next full moon, as it was beginning to feel like that might be the only thing which would help the beast remain calm in a new and unfamiliar place.
Harry found that his mind didn’t work, that nothing worked.
“Get out of here, Potter,” Crabbe signalled with his head. “We’re checking on our friend and we don’t want you snivelling all over him like some lovesick dog. You were dumped, when are you going to get that?” He didn’t speak in a loud voice so as to not be thrown out, but his words might as well have been thunder with how loud they vibrated within Harry’s head.
“I’m lucky like that,” Harry smiled back.
“I… I’m…” Pat turned toward her actual friend. The witch who was kind, understanding and pleasant to speak to. The person she had fun with, and the person who actually saw her as a friend rather than a subject to rule over. She felt herself tremble worse, her legs threatening to give in.
For their greater good.
I’m sorry.
The room was dark, and neither of them could see the other very well, yet that made it easier to explore. Harry’s fingers carefully explored Draco’s naked chest, careful not to scratch him by accident while Draco’s longer reach allowed him to explore Harry’s bare back. Their shirts had been pushed aside, yet they were not naked on their lower bodies. The exploration was sometimes interrupted by a careful yet honest request for the other to not touch this or that place, to which the other adjusted themselves to.
“I technically did fall…” Harry stifled another laughter of relief with his hand. “So you weren’t wrong about that.”
“But then, if there are Death Eaters coming to Hogwarts,” Daelalus Dinkle said, “shouldn’t we focus on capturing them? The most prominent danger to our community is those religious zealots of Death Eaters. Surely the Dark Lord will send at least Bellatrix Lestrange as well as other notorious members of his inner circle to do something as important as try to assassinate Albus Dumbledore himself? If we capture them, then Dumbledore won’t have to die, and we will have ensured that the Dark Lord is weakened in the future?”
Harry Potter’s eyes reflected something which Draco didn’t quite understand, it was some manner of emotion, but overall, the other man was giving him an empty look. That look made him feel as if his insides had frozen to ice, and he quickly avoided the other’s piercing green eyes. He wanted to say something more, wanted to object, but he found himself far too frightened to speak up before the other man. A few months of unwilling service to the most powerful of wizards tended to cause a person to hesitate to object. Potter wasn’t in any way like the Dark Lord, but the blonde man knew that his only chance lay with his old classmate. Without his help… If Potter refused to help him… Draco’s lower lip quivered as he thought of it.
“Hello!” Harry cheerfully greeted Kreacher. He was a little too excited to have learned that the call had actually summoned the other to remain dignified. “I can’t believe you heard me all the way from the grim old place. How have you been?”
Hermione felt her cheeks heat, and she was relieved that her skin was dark enough to hide most of it. “I… think that I did know that. Logically, I knew that, but it is so hard to remember things like that when all the things I’ve seen on TV and in books has only been those examples of people acting out. Muggles rather act as if it is the norm which can’t be helped, and they would rather wave it away as ‘typical,’ rather than work to change it. I know that she is denying reality and accusing me of things I haven't done, but it almost feels like people around us will expect me to have done it by default, because I'm the 'other girl.'”
Whatever Ron had expected the problem to be, it had not been that Teddy had actually witnessed his supposed father beat his mother to death. The revelation was so shocking that Ron didn’t quite know what to say to it, yet it turned out that he didn’t quite need to say anything, as Teddy needed to be listened to more than he needed to be talked to. Thus, Ron learned the reason as to why Teddy hated his old man and refused to call him by any parental title, while also learning why he hated to be called Ted, as that was what Nott Senior called him.
Unbeknownst to the group of friends, Narcissa Malfoy had arranged for people to stay during different amounts of time at the manor. Remus, Professor Snape, Harry, Sirius and Kreacher would come by the 18th of December and stay until the 26th. The Weasleys and friends were invited to stay from the 23rd to the 26th. Andromeda Tonks and her husband and daughter were invited to come on the 25th and leave the next day. Albus Dumbledore was invited to stay for the same amount of time as the Tonks family.
“Understood.” Kreacher appeared to appreciate the direct orders, or maybe he only found them easier to understand compared to Harry’s polite requests. “Kreacher shall see it done.”
“Not at all,” Sirius hurriedly shook his head. “I would in fact feel more comfortable if you are generally comfortable when I speak.” He nervously drummed his fingers against the table, but quickly realised that he was doing it and stopped. “Alright… so I’ve asked Remus to ask Professor Dumbledore to come to the holiday feast so that I can have him help draft my will.”
Pat shook her head, trying to remember a time when she had ever thought that Hermione Granger behaved creepily.
Ginny raised her head from speaking to the younger man next to her, realigned herself and then smiled at the man. “I am indeed. I play in the position of Seeker, unlike the Slytherin captain.”
Harry nodded as he stood up. “I would like that as well, but we should find Luna first and bring her with us to avoid her repeating my mistake.” He gestured towards the closed pathway behind them.
For the moment, Pat didn’t regret asking Chang with her to the Slughorn Yule party. For the moment, she was honestly excited about the prospect of going with someone who appeared capable of being a genuine friend. She rather needed one of those.
A battle was occurring all around Harry as the Death Eaters, the Order of the Phoenix and a collection of students clashed in a brutal battle within the Department of Mysteries.
Some students had already gathered around the table, which had Professor Slughorn himself on the end, with no other chair to match him on the other short side. He appeared like a regal mage, overlooking his subjects with willingness and mercy, although not without criticism.
Other people couldn’t love like her and Arthur. Other people’s love was not as pure as hers, not as true as hers. They were perfect together, and perfect they had to stay. All the struggles came from the fact that she was failing him and her family in not being happy enough. She was not the mother, the woman, she was supposed to be.
A soft stroking all but jolted Harry awake as he sat up so quickly that he almost fell off his chair. His butt ached from the pain of having fallen asleep upon a wooden chair, and his back and arms were not quite fine after his uncomfortable sleeping position against the hospital bed, but all of that was forgotten as he spotted Draco’s pale face as he was sitting up in his bed.
In the middle of my objection, El closes the gap between our bodies and rests his head upon my shoulder, allowing his chest to press against my back in a display of affection which makes my head spin.
“Hey, Neville, you can’t bring Slytherins into the common room like that.”
she had said.
Harry lightly bit his beloved’s neck to keep him from finishing that sentence. “No!” he whispered back, sounding slightly offended. “It’s not that I would never want that from him, but I wanted it with you for… for… Ugh… I feel creepy…” Harry stopped speaking as he hid his face against his best friend’s shoulder, thankful for the darkness of his skin and the cloud which kept the moonlight out of their secluded space.
Teddy simply shrugged in response. “I heard what I heard.”
“You got it,” Mundungus confirmed as he continued to glance around. “I know that my loyalty might seem fickle to you people. Especially Aurors, but I’m as enamoured with Dumbledore as the rest of the British mage community. I have to say that he doesn’t seem to understand just how important he is. It might make me seem a bit of an arse, but we can’t actually be meaning to sit down and wait while Death Eaters walk through Hogwarts, kill him, and then leave again? Surely, we both agree that we can’t let the old man do that to himself and to us?”
“You can ask whatever you want of me, because I say you can. Tomorrow, I’m telling Astoria that I’m keeping you company. She’s really nice, she will understand.”
Bill was a number of years older than George. When they were little, that number had felt giant, but the older they got, the less large the number appeared. He was dressing like the type of person who traditionally liked rock as a genre, with leather pants and a patterned dark purple shirt which hung off his body to allow some breathing room in the warm summer. He generally wore a collection of rings, bracelets and necklaces in his preferred color of gold, but in the heat, he had instead elected to only wear a golden earring depicting the eye of Horus. George expected his brother to put on some more jewellery before they left, as he preferred to dress like he wanted when he wasn’t on the clock.
“I do not… It is not my book…” I hastily begin to excuse myself. “I… I was hoping that… that is to say that it was recommended to me and I… I borrowed this copy from an acquaintance… and…”
“Sounds like you’re a department sympathising with the Death Eaters…” A dark, annoyed voice mumbled somewhere within the room.
Harry forced his eyes shut and began to breathe deeply and slowly. He recalled what Albus had said about the memories and feelings not being his own, Harry did attempt to hold on to that understanding of reality. However, that didn’t quite make it any easier when he knew the feelings in questions due to his own experiences.
The scene shifted as if Harry had been yanked back, out through the door as he could still see Remus’ body in the dark beyond the door. Said door slowly fell shut in front of Harry’s eyes as he struggled to move and call out to his dad. The steel door fell shut with a quiet yet vibrating noise, Harry noticed the handle as appearing particularly cruel, like it had been designed to hurt whoever attempted to open the steel door.
“Are they beginning to gather yet? For the ceremony, I mean.” Neville asked politely from behind Hermione. The question was addressed to Victor.
Severus hid his mouth behind one of his hands, yet not before Remus noticed the unwilling smile upon his lips. Upon his neck shimmered the necklace which Remus had given him last year, almost exactly a year ago. The necklace which he wore proudly for the world to see, displaying it without bragging to anyone who happened to gaze at him.
She turned towards Ron and leaned in to whisper, “so can you do the thing?”
“Better not in the first place,” Harry sighed, “Slughorn tends to put alcohol in things which shouldn’t have it.”
Rabastan became engaged to his Rodolphus and the marriage occurred less than a year after that, granting him the honorable name of Lestrange. Rabastan sometimes agonised over the fact that he was not a Pureblood, although he had pretended to be since he realised that every other Death Eater appeared to be doing the same thing. He feared that if Rodolphus knew, then he would be divorced without a single knut to his name, after dishonoring the name of the noble house of Lestrange. Thus, he kept his bloodline a secret from his husband and prayed that nobody would ever learn that he had lied.
Sirius was dead, and Peter visiting his grave would likely make Sirius hate him even more. He would never be able to say goodbye. Sirius wouldn’t let him, even from beyond the grave. Peter could never have imagined that the knowledge would hurt as much as it did.
Harry couldn’t help but feel happy for Goyle, as he understood what the position in the Disciplinary Committee meant to him. He truly hoped that Umbridge would give all the members the recommendation which she had promised them during the welcome feast in the Great Hall.
“The possibilities of blinding a basilisk without hurting the animal itself, sir.” Tom answers flawlessly, as he always does.
“They are all people… Even if we probably shouldn’t have made our family quite this big, I swore everlasting love to my children, and I don’t regret bringing them into this world.” Molly stated with absolute certainty. She might have been very unhappy, and to alleviate that unhappiness, she had birthed many children. However, it was not their fault, and she would never blame them for what she and Arthur failed to realise about themselves.
“What is Azkaban?” Tom appears even closer now, his voice sounding less strained and far less frightened.
“I’ll stop the extraction. We cannot risk the damage we might cause.” Al felt guilt throb through his chest as he elected to break his promise to Harry in saving Draco and Narcissa Malfoy from the influence of the Dark Lord. He hoped that his young friend might be able to find it in his heart to forgive him as he prioritised their, and everyone else's, lives over desperate attempts to save them. “Rubeus, please wake Severus, tell him he must go to Malfoy Manor without delay but take care that nobody is listening. Mrs. Weasley, you may stay for as long as you need, call for an elf by the name of Dobby and he will assist you without asking questions. My home is behind those doors, anything you need is yours, even access to my bed should you need rest.”
“It might not be… The future is uncertain… There is very likely a second war coming…” Severus’ words ended up unconnected, almost shy as he struggled to keep his gaze away from Remus, yet struggled to look upon him. “The Dark Lord might call me back to his side at any time and I couldn’t refuse it and risk his wrath upon the people around me…”
If he only could force himself to think fully of someone else, Harry could make the hurt inside him go away, at the very least momentarily.
Despite not wanting to, Harry couldn’t help but to doubt the words of the other two mages. Teddy had just confessed to keeping information from him for the sake of not worrying him, as if that would be worse than finding out later. Harry wanted to know everything. He needed to know, and the idea that his friend would keep secrets from him made him feel rather sick. He did get that it was well meant, and kind, but he couldn’t help but to feel betrayed.
Draco chuckled as he put an arm around Harry, pulling him closer before kissing him on the head. “That one is getting quite accomplished in flirting. Do you believe me that he is crushing on you yet?”
Harry returned the smile as he leaned his head against Draco’s fingers, feeling the warmth of the teacup upon the otherwise cold limbs. “It won’t happen to us. I refuse to let it happen.” He whispered the words which felt too important to be said with all the force he had used back at Al’s office. It was a promise, one so delicate and important that it couldn’t be vocalised too forcefully, yet it might be broken.
“Good to see you too,” Harry bit back the ‘sir’ which threatened to escape him as he stepped to the side.
Bellatrix barked an order at the animagus who had just stepped inside the parlour with a tray of biscuits for the Death Eater after they, well, ate all of the previous ones. She threw her shoe at him shortly after, which Pettigrew barely managed to avoid without dropping the tray or the biscuits. He had rather good reflexes and was becoming used to her assaults.
“Everyone!” Ginny announced as she entered the Room of Requirements, grinning from ear to ear as her cheeks heated with excitement and her eyes were aflame with happiness. “Allow me to introduce my new and second girlfriend,” she turned around and spread her arms, showing towards the person behind her. “Luna Lovegood! Ba-baaam!”
“Professor?” Tonks spoke up by Remus’ elbow, whispering to him in a quiet voice which startled the werewolf more than he wanted to admit. She looked highly uncomfortable with having unsettled him.
“Neville, my hero!” Ginny spun around and was suddenly clinging to Neville at the other end of the room, grinning wildly. “You’re my new best honorary friend!” she cheered.
“Nevermind. Thanks for the help, the shirt feels great against my skin.” Colin concluded with a smile, his cheeks slightly red from emotions.
The werewolf groaned weakly as he understood what was about to follow. He felt the need to apologise, but a stern glance from Severus caused him to close his mouth again. Nonetheless, Remus experienced guilt and worry, as he yet again blamed himself for being something which he could not help being. He knew that Severus disagreed with him, but the feeling of shame was so ingrained in his mind that it was almost impossible to not feel guilt and shame in connection to his condition.
