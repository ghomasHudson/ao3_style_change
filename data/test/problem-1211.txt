“Goodnight, Potter.”
Harry frowned at him.
Harry got into the taxi and closed his eyes. The world span pleasantly, and he wished he had the nerve to ask Draco out. Properly this time. Without interruption. This was his chance. No interruption in here. Draco climbed in the other side and did up his seat belt.
This surprised Harry.
She sighed and shook her head then dropped the subject as Ron arrived.
Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry winced. “You still could be making the whole thing up.”
“No,” Hermione and Ron said in unison.
“You don’t look okay, Harry.”
“Just because I’m not a violent, vindictive, sadistic...”
“Lets show them all how hard your prick is for me, shall we?” Potter shoved down Draco’s trousers and boxers, letting Draco’s hard cock bob free in the air in front of the audience that were now unashamedly watching. Draco’s cheeks burnt. It wasn’t them watching him, god knows he’d done that enough times before. He enjoyed it. It was that Potter was the one standing behind him this time.
Harry whimpered as he pushed down another inch, catching his breath, wondering how the hell he managed to take it all last night.
Draco chuckled.
Draco groaned underneath him.
Harry tensed and Draco laughed.
He gave Draco an apologetic look and went to the door.
Harry grinned and pushed forward slowly, groaning at the feel of Draco stretching around him.
“Of course they are. Okay.” He trusted Major’s opinion. “Yeah. I’ll go.”
“Thank you.”
“Stop, get on your front.”
“Left the cooker on?”
Dumbledore nodded.
“You’re soaked in sweat,” he told Harry.
Harry whimpered as Draco stroked his prostate, teasingly light and gentle. Harry held his breath as Draco pulled out his fingers, still a little nervous, even after last night. He groaned at the feel if Draco’s hot cock pushing against his arse hole. He pushed back, gently at first, his mouth dropping open at the pleasure, the stretch, of feeling so full.
“No, they’re being swapped, they won’t be harmed...much. They could be though, Potter, if I wanted them to be, so don’t fuck me around.”
Harry froze. He couldn’t breathe. He realised now it was very obvious where this was headed. But he really wasn’t sure whether Draco wanted to snog him or punch him in the face. He still wasn’t certain.
Draco let out a silent scream, sure if Potter held him there any longer he was going to pass out or break through the spell. If that was even possible.
“No, Malfoy,” Harry sighed.
Draco flicked too fingers up at him as he scanned the file.
Harry flushed deepest red and Draco knelt in between his legs and ran his thumbs up the inside of his thighs, holding his cheeks apart. Harry’s cock throbbed painfully between his legs.
Harry grabbed Draco and pushed him against the shower wall, curling one hand tight in his hair. Draco groaned and spread his legs expectantly.
Draco moved faster, his face still inches from Harry’s, eyes still locked. Harry stared up at him, at his flushing face, contorting with pleasure, mouth open and grinning as he pounded Harry’s arse hard and just how he wanted. Harry groaned, shaking underneath Draco, his cock jumping every time Draco’s stomach brushed it.
“Malfoy!” one of the Ravenclaw’s Harry didn’t recognise said as it landed on him. “You have to…” she picked up the card from the deck. ‘Kiss for five minutes…”
“Alohamora” he whispered and the lock clicked open.
“Now come on, let’s put these books back and get to class.”
Harry laughed.
“Sure. It’s not like I can go walking around outside, is it. You made sure of that
She leant closer to him.
“Malfoy family secret.”
“I will.”
“You’re so…”
“Yess Potter.”
Harry complied with a shaking hand, knowing exactly what Draco was going to do next.
“What do you mean? I’m an expert at deflowering virgins.”
Harry’s chest tightened. He cast his eyes round the library to check for any lurking students. It was empty, everyone was at dinner.
Draco shuffled his ankles apart.
“No, you’re right,” Harry conceded, “that’s ridiculous.”
Draco shook his head.
The second Death Eater trained his wand on Harry and came towards him. Harry kept his hands up, watching the wand to Malfoy’s temple closely.
“How did it feel this morning? Sore?”
“Thank you.”
He pulled on his dressing gown and gave Draco a shove, remembering that he was supposed to be watching him.
“Honestly, Potter, if you wanted to get closer you could have just said so...” Malfoy raked a hand through Harry’s hair and pulled him up against him hard.
Potter chuckled in his ear.
“Oh. Yes. A bit unconventional. Rescued him from a Death Eater trial.”
“Do what?”
“Fuck yeah. That’s...” he moaned again as Malfoy slid his lips back down. Drawing him oh so close, again and again, the present pushing, fucking him slowly, the sweetest pressure. Harry legs were beginning to shake, sheer need exhausting his body, when Malfoy stood back up.
Draco looked up at him with tired eyes and Harry kissed him softly on the lips. Draco smiled.
“Six crates.”
Harry jumped as the clock struck 4pm. It caught him by surprise every time. Draco gave him an amused smile.
“Shh!” Draco hissed as Harry’s sleeping bag rustled. “Get the camera.”
“Relax. Try again.”
“I don’t hate it when you fuck me...I hate that I want you to.”
“I have been wanting to take a little ride on this, Potter.” He stroked Harry’s cock slowly.
“A quick death?”
They both cried out loud as Draco guided Harry’s cock inside him.
“God help me if you’re opposite me in the war,” he muttered under his breath. “I’d be toast.”
Draco nodded. He didn’t trust himself to speak.
It pushed, stretched, and brushed against his prostate. Harry gasped.
“You like the spell?”
“I can’t. Draco, please...”
“Yes?”
“How do you even know how to clean, didn’t you have house elves for that?”
“The only way I can see of reversing it is if you find out what he’s giving you.”
Harry walked over silently and put them on.
Even with his poker face Harry could still tell Draco was holding his breath.
Draco turned his head over his shoulder and grinned at him.
The bell rang again. Harry was losing count of the number of classes they were missing.
“Dumbledore thinks I can.”
“Try and see him.”
Harry gasped his breath back.
“Are we trusting him then?”
“Up here, Captain.”
He was trying to make his way over to the blonde, but every few steps someone caught his arm, desperate to speak to him. There had been too many galas lately, too many hours spent with his politely interested expression plastered on his face. He accepted another champagne. And another. Still trying to get across to the hall towards Draco. He excused himself for what felt like the tenth time to get to Draco. This time he ignored the voice calling him back.
“Great plan, Potter. You know the rest of the Death Eaters can be back here in a second?”
“I’m not saying I trust you.” Harry thought he should probably say something to him, hoping to god it was something sensible and not the array of filthy thoughts that seemed to be flooding through his mind.
They danced quietly for the rest of the class. Harry knew it was coming to an end and anticipation rose that everything might be okay and Draco might pull him away to the room of requirement and they could be themselves again.
“This is really nice, Hermione, thank you,” Malfoy said, smiling at her.
“Are you okay?” Hermione asked him quietly.
Harry felt his muscles turn to jelly as Draco poured the other oil on his skin and it seeped in.
“Fuck.”
“I know,” Harry said. “It’s too big for me really. I know it’s nice, but I don’t see why it can’t be given to one of the employees with a family, who might actually use the three bedrooms, and I can have a single bedroom flat.”
“I knew it. I knew you were helping him.”
“Demanding brat,” Harry slapped his arse and Draco shuddered. “I think we’ll take this nice and slow.”
“Fuck Draco. That’s so hot.”
“Thanks.” Malfoy caught it and kept it out as he walked past Harry to see what was in the room beyond.
Harry grinned continuing to fuck him as hard as he could, Draco’s every cry and every contraction of his muscles sending him closer.
Draco grinned as Harry started to scream and wrapped his hand round his cock, biting down hard on his shoulder. Harry screamed as he came even harder than before, trembling as he felt Draco satisfy himself. He went limp and let the wall take his weight for a moment.
“Oh, you’re so tight. Look at that. We’re going to have to do something about that.”
“Enjoy that?”
“Why didn’t we know about this?”
The coffee machine purred at the compliment.
“You know Draco...when I said distract him...this wasn’t exactly what I had in mind.”
“Can you start on Monday?”
The field was empty of all but two other tents. Harry was surprised that they weren’t the only ones crazy enough to be camping in this weather. A man eventually came out of the small brick building in the middle of the field that Harry guessed was the toilet block. He carried a mop and bucket under his arm.
It was one of the things he liked about Major. He wasn’t into gossiping, grudges and internal politics. He was always polite to Draco.
She gave him a sceptical look, like Harry couldn’t even manage to make a cup of coffee on a bad day.
“You feel so good.”
“Don’t look so scared, I told you, I can’t have murdering the Minister of Magic on my ledger when I’ve just skirted round a trip to Azkaban.”
Malfoy laughed at his reaction.
He could tell Draco was grinning behind him.
“Missed me?”
Harry let Draco fuck his mouth in a post orgasm daze, only vaguely aware of Draco’s hands tight in his hair, of his throat gagging in mild protest. Draco didn’t seem to pay it any mind.
“Shit. I’m sorry.”
“Like your ego needs inflating.”
“You want to fuck or what?”
Draco touched his wand and Harry felt the spell finally release. Harry gasped his breath back.
Harry looked at him warily. Draco looked him up and down.
Harry had a horrid flashback to Ginny leaving. It wasn’t a horrid breakup, as such. Just a painful memory. She’d been too kind. Too understanding. It made him feel even worse.
Dumbledore didn’t even blink.
“No. I checked.”
Harry knew he didn’t really care and just thought Harry’s annoyance amusing. He’d seen Draco when he was truly enraged and wrathful, and this wasn’t it.
Harry flopped back onto the floorboards, his head smacking of the wood.
“Oh yeah, Potter, my good little cock slut, you take it. Like you’re gonna take it up your arse for me reeeal soon.”
Harry stepped out of his trousers and did as he was told.
“Yeah. Oh my god. Draco. So good. Don’t ever stop.”
Harry tuned out as Hermione tried to explain the rules of Rugby to Ron. Harry’s attention was fixed on the streak of platinum bobbing along in the crowd ahead of them.
“It’s not like that.”
“Oh.” He sighed. “Poor creatures. It’s alright,” Harry heard him cooing through the door at one of them. “Shhh.”
Hermione caught his eye and Harry shook his head. She gave an exasperated sigh. Harry waited until they were walking out together to talk to her privately. He’d pulled her to the side in one of the annexes but he hadn’t even opened his mouth before she shot him down.
Now he was in control Draco felt himself get there almost instantly, burying himself balls deep in the poor boy and hard, making him shriek, in what..? He didn’t know, or care really.
Harry whimpered. Desperation overcoming all else.
“Reckless...you could have ended up locked in here with us and burnt to death,” Hermione said, staring at him hard.
It took Harry a moment to catch his meaning, then he laughed, wondering how Draco knew what his Patronus was.
“Well come on then!” Malfoy shook his hand waiting in the air for Harry’s. “You do know how to dance don’t you?”
“Yeah, yeah.”
He gasped and spluttered his pleas but nothing comprehensible passed his lips.
Harry yelped as the toy started to buzz inside him.
“Hermione, we couldn’t do any of this without Draco’s help,” Tonks started.
Draco whimpered.
Draco look up and grinned at him.
“Draco get up. That will have triggered the wards. We need to go.”
“I brought you a present.”
The door creaked and Harry tensed.
Malfoy groaned.
Harry didn’t dare think what Draco had been up to in the room of requirement.
“Don’t try and get out by the way, it won’t work.”
Draco pulled his head over and guided his cock in between his lips, pushing his head down. Harry let Draco hold his head as he slowly fucked his mouth. Every few strokes he pushed at the back of Harry’s throat, keeping eye contact, watching him struggling, retching, the spit running down his face.
“Yes. That’s what I said,” Draco drawled.
“Yes,” Harry said.
“Sorry darling, what was that? I can’t hear you.”
“Are you… controlling that?”
Harry’s skin prickled and his cock hardened.
“Virgin?” Harry offered.
“Ah!” Harry gasped at the added girth of Draco’s finger still inside him.
“Like that do we? Pervert. I could serve you up to Voldemort like this. The boy who lived with his dick out, gagging for a Malfoy.”
“Got you a present for our weekend getaway.”
A cool breeze passed over Harry’s skin and Harry found himself clean. He ran a hand through his hair and found it not only clean, but decidedly softer than usual. Harry frowned.
“I’m not! I just…”
“Relax. Let me take you.” The words turned Draco into putty and he felt Potter’s fourth finger slide inside him.
Malfoy shook his head.
Draco put his other hand on Harry’s hip and began to move him.
Potter stroked his finger from Draco’s temple, down his cheek bone. He undid the gag. It fell to the floor with a clack and Draco smacked his lips together. He wished Potter had left it in, it had been serving as a very good excuse as to why he hadn’t said anything incredibly clever and cutting yet.
Harry let Draco take his weight and run his hand through his hair. Draco guided him back up and pulled him astride his lap. Harry rested his head on Draco shoulder and closed his eyes.
“Draco...” Harry had to ask him something.
“Ah! Potter please. Fuck me.”
“There is a lot to trouble our dreams at present.”
Harry allowed himself to feel smug that she’d also thought it was a bullshit mission.
Another twenty minutes passed and Hermione tapped her pen against the page.
“Potter. Potter…please.” It came out as a rasp under Potter’s fingers.
“Damage?” he asked Molly.
Harry got up, stretched, then grabbed his half of the tent and took it off the train. The bitter wind nearly knocked him sideways. Malfoy hopped down beside him and they looked around at the empty train platform. The one bathroom had a padlock on it. The shutters on what Harry assumed usually was the café were down, without any signage about when they might possibly be open again. The night was already drawing in. They walked out onto a mostly empty ‘main road’ with no shops except a petrol station across the street.
“Potter.” Draco paused and Harry gasped back his breath.
“Draco.” She nodded to him, then paused. “I told you this was all going to end badly.”
He closed his eyes, but the image of Malfoy flashed up again. He snapped them open and stared at the curtains some more. Malfoy’s scent was everywhere, lingering. He couldn’t quite place it. A certain aftershave he’d not smelled before combined with a washing powder that Aunt Petunia wished she could afford.
Draco was trying to catch his eye but Harry refused, determined not to give him the satisfaction, at least for a little while. As he wiped off the last of the dust from his cheek Draco tilted his head, placing several small kisses down his wrist, looking up at Harry with a glint in his eye before nipping down slightly on his skin with his teeth, smirking at him.
“God…”
“I don’t know...what if it gets intercepted? Then they’ll know where Harry is...the Burrow isn’t all that secure...” Hermione mused, frowning.
Draco took out the beans and a handful spilt out onto the work surface where Harry had ripped the bag opening it the first time. Draco turned round to give Harry another condescending look.
“He’s a human being!”
“Report at 9am Monday for debrief.”
Harry ignored him and dug out their binoculars. He wrestled with the hedge until he got a good line of sight.
“Needed some air.” He said weakly.
Harry just glared at him.
“I’m sure when we’ve won the war that the ministry will be able to afford the best shrink going for him.”
“Sounds like you’re more worried about missing breakfast.”
“It’s not a crush.”
Harry spluttered.
“Well, I just don’t know what to tie you to first...”
The spell released him and Draco pumped Harry’s cock hard. Harry screamed, the intensity of his orgasm took his breath and his whole body spasmed.
“Yes darling, this looks perfect. I do love our weekend getaways from City life.”
Draco pushed harder on the back of his head, his neck. Harry couldn’t breathe. He didn’t care. He was on the edge. It was inexplicable, Draco hadn’t even touched him properly yet. He knew when he did he was gonna last a second before he exploded. He gagged. Draco pushed harder.
“Now, if I put you back to normal again, are you going to behave?”
He slowly slid down under the covers and started playing with Harry’s cock.
Draco grabbed a cloth from the kitchen and the coffee machine purred at him. Harry rolled his eyes. Draco was still managing to look smarter than Harry did in his ministry robes in basic dark green chinos and a black polo shirt. If he was in any way hungover, he was hiding it well.
“Minister? Minister!”
Harry was too shocked to even think of untangling himself from Malfoy. He had a tight grip on Harry’s waist anyway, so he was pretty sure he wasn’t going to be going anywhere anytime soon.
Harry nodded, now he’d got up the idea of Draco being in his bed was unthinkably stupid. Draco finished the pastry, pulled his clothes back on and walked to the door.
“Fuck!” That he had not been expecting. Doms did not tend to rim. At least not the ones he was used to.
“We do also have a swimming pool.”
Draco slid his thumbs inside.
“Has it worked?”
Draco pushed hard where he wanted it and Harry cried out.
“What’s the plan?”
“Oh yeah.” Draco grinned. “Lie down.”
“I think you should tell Dumbledore.”
Harry tried to do as he was told, struggling in the awkward position they were in.
“Oh jesus. You’re in love with him.”
“That’s two words.”
“Keep your eyes closed.”
“I can do more than that, you know.”
“Of course I do!”
“What do you mean it’s just bleeding?” Draco shrieked staring at the blood gushing from his artery.
“Like I’d need one,” Draco said.
“I want to be the one to kill my father.”
“Spread your legs.”
“Aren’t you going to try them on?” Draco put on a mock offended look.
He lay his head back on the arm of the sofa, looking at Draco upside down, wondering quite when he’d started to find the man so attractive.
“It’s the giants.”
Molly sighed.
“And you don’t feel like such a traitor?”
“Fuck!” he yelled one final time and collapsed on top of Harry’s back. Harry’s arms gave way and he went face first onto the floor. He couldn’t bring himself to care.
Harry frowned.
Harry rolled his eyes at his elusive answer and turned to the others.
“Does it hurt?” Harry asked.
He knew Draco was just screwing around with his head, he’d never before shown any sign of affection or wanting to treat him like this, he’d never wanted to share a bed, cuddle and have real conversations before. Either that, or being locked up in his father’s house, had truly made him crazy. Or changed him, a very small voice said in Harry’s head.
Harry thought he might be dead. Fucked to death by the son of a death eater turned masseuse. What a legacy.
“No, I wanna wank over you. I’m gonna come all over that face.” Draco ran his finger from the top of Harry’s forehead, down his nose, over his lips.
“I know what it is he’s been asked to do Harry.”
“I don’t know about you, Potter,” Malfoy whispered in his ear. “But I rather liked that. What about you?”
He flicked it and the lamps burst into light.
“No. The only time I have a proper meal is if Hermione or Mrs Weasley cooks it for me. Hermione came to see me the other week and saw all I had was microwave meals. An owl turned up the next day with boxes and boxes of frozen meals she’d made.”
“There must be something we can-”
“Don’t touch it. It needs to heal.”
Harry leaned over and wretched, heaved and coughed.
“The other night, I heard you crying.”
“I’m not really alone with him, am I?”
Draco bit down on Harry’s hip and released the spell. Harry wailed loud enough for the whole school to hear.
He groaned, disgusted with himself and the white sticky liquid now floating in the bathwater.
“I think I’d rather like to have a go on this,” Malfoy palmed Harry’s hard cock through his robes.
“No more children, no matter their future or their connection to us, or I’ll go crazy, you hear?” Draco one night declared when he finally got to bed, kissing Harry only briefly, from which Harry could guess he was too tired for anything other than sleeping. “We wanted this, but at age four, Severus could talk and almost read, and Edwin-“
Harry sighed, and wished, for a hundredth time that the Order’s members were no longer be allowed to live there since the war was over, but he didn’t want to revoke the invitation Sirius himself gave to the organization, plus he didn’t have the heart to throw anyone out, despite the inconvinience they were causing.
A bit of a domestical chapter, if you will, not really much happening, but I felt like it was necessary for things to come to have come from here, so there you have it! (Random mentioning of Snape BTW kinda made me miss him.)
“Ah, so you’re with him this time, why am I not surprised?” she asked without even saying hello. “Well then, it only means you also have to go.”
“Is this why you have broken up with the redhead girl? She didn’t like it up in the ass, Potter?”
She seemed almost ready to curse Harry out of the house, but then she dove into his mind again, with a speed that left Harry wincing.
“I thought you didn’t care.”
agreed,” Draco was eyeing him as if he wasn’t sure whether to believe him or not.
“So how do we go back then?” Harry tried to consider their options.
Then went back to the Library half listening to what Severus was studying with Draco, half revising his research on Time magic.
“He’s still missing,” Hermione lied so easily, that Harry began to think if she was so used to lying, it must be true. Fayre was Malfoy. And she also just saved Ron’s life while Harry and Hermione did everything to stop her, insulting her.
“I guess… losing someone you care about can be extremely scary, Severus,” Harry decided he won’t be like Dumbledore, after all. He may not go into the details of war, but he won’t lie either.
Harry tried not to think he was sold to the idea because he found a Draco Malfoy who would share meals with him voluntarily a curious thing, but failed.
“All along, you could manipulate which memory we watch and knew who I was. You are my Fayre.”
He didn’t matter.
“Here, arrange whatever you need,” Harry gave Draco his rightful property back, feeling still defeated.
“So that you can attack me while I’m in his memories? I’m not stupid, you might have Severus now, but legally he still belongs to my family. You might just want to-“
“Draco Malfoy is everywhere around here! Can’t go two steps without meeting another one! But as for Fayre… that’s my name, it’s real pretty, that’s why I chose it for myself!”
, Harry,” Malfoy never really called him by his first name without Severus being present, and Harry knew it was to make him accept something he wasn’t willing to accept. “And I would rescue this other child as well, but not if we put Severus in danger in return.”
“Harry! It’s Ron…”
Warning: this chapter displays Eileen and Tobias as horrible parents, so if you think that could be triggering for you, please don't read.
“Now isn’t this just
Which didn’t stop Draco from giving him a very irritated glare, before he explained to Severus how Side-Apparation works and they were gone.
“You’re right, I should get breakfast… and leave you to it,” it seemed like ages until Potter announced, turned, and left the room.
And very soon, it was possibly Edwin who thought it would be fun to levitate the blanket under them, so Harry just found himself in the middle of the blanket with everyone on the top of him, since their combined weight wasn’t evenly distributed for the flight.
However, the younger blond was nowhere to be found since months.
“If it was me, I’d divide a piece of a larger piece for maximizing profit, and one that already traveled quite much in time and space, and has existed for some time now as we know it.”
So he pulled out a chair next to the Library table, sitting down a few chairs up from the kid. So much for a bit quiet reading, after he had spent two hours in the attic, cleaning up centuries-old dust and curses (not to mention Pixie "dust"), it seemed.
Except almost getting hurt when a spell bounced back, as if all the room was sealed off, so Harry had to throw up a shield, keeping them both safe.
Ginny should be able to date anyone without anyone making a fuss about it, sending curses to her. Why couldn’t she? Because she was connected to Harry, and people were terrible beings, enjoying the drama.
“Look, I know we’ve been fighting each other, but we’ve both lost. I regret everything, and I have no doubt you would love to have your husband back, as well as Severus.”
And even when he did, the poor wizard seemed hesitant.
“My god,” Harry thought for a moment he felt his head spin.
It was one of those times. When Draco regretted not dating Harry. It would have been so easy to imagine it would be perfect when Harry was doing so great with Severus like this.
He originally planned to set up a Potions laboratory letting Severus choose a Cauldron and simple ingredients for himself, but until Draco hadn’t gained his trust a little bit better so that he could support Severus to ease into the crowded, noisy street of Diagon Alley, Draco decided to wait.
“I have been thinking for a while,” Draco sent Severus ahead for lunch, coming up to Harry. “About what kind of crystal would fit time travel magic best and such.”
Plus, Fayre was a liability, making all this her fault.
“I’d do it right now if it wasn’t for your rule of not even suggesting it.”
“An established wizarding family before their last member married your great-grandfather. We could re-establish it as a dynasty, claiming you were a distant and lost relative of Fleamont Potter, because even if they tested his magic - as the only living descendant - they’d find you two are truly related,” Draco finished his thought, surprising Harry. “Seriously, Potter, you imagine Purebloods care about the family name so much, but we don’t learn their histories? I could even name all the great-grandparents of the Weasleys, I just rather not.”
“Among other things,” Draco almost toppled over, when Harry caught him, and had to made sure he was okay, but the blond just shook his head that it was alright. “But if you saw the future you, you should know you can do it.”
“Severus called me… mentally with magic. He could sense how upset you were sometimes… and noticed how fighting a common enemy always got you and your husband closer… and he wanted to keep you together… because he feared if you end up fighting, you’d get rid of him… just as I did.”
shows up telling me he would offer me and Severus sanctuary from my own husband, and the next morning my son disappears when I refuse?”
“Admittedly, I did hate him. Just as he hated me,” Harry quickly explained, terrified she won’t hear him out. “But all that has changed, you can check. I wouldn’t be here otherwise. Please don’t throw me out before you know the whole story.”
“Maybe you could take Severus out to eat something,” Harry had to navigate a relatively thin line between Eileen and Draco. “But only if he didn’t have a big breakfast yet.”
Yes, she did have a huge crush on Potter probably ever since she didn’t even know what that meant, only felt it. And Potter cursing her, almost taking her life, then Potter saving her life (just to surprise her more because of the Sectumsempra first) didn’t help her head forget that either.
“We shouldn’t ruin years of self-restraint,” he told Draco, but his pupils were blown, and he conveniently forgot to mention they’d have to do something big to get out.
He wasn’t going to decide how to face Eileen on his own. Even if it was just a technicality, they were married now, so he needed to update Malfoy quickly about the details.
“No, that’s all. And I give you my word, Severus will be always my top priority…” Harry quickly explained, making Draco nod.
“That you needed a chaperone not to get in trouble at all time? No, but I have much more respect for Granger who must have been the one to look after you before,” Draco wondered out loud when Potter only spread the rolled-up Prophet in front of him.
If Harry went about the issue as a Gryffindor and told Draco he wanted his husband to have some fun with shopping for him now that the kids were too old for it, it would have never worked.
“Just so you know, when I was a kid, and Severus was taking care of me, that’s
“Water…” and both Hermione and Harry jumped to get some water, but then when Ron drank, he seemed so okay that he asked. “Why were you talking about Malfoy?”
“No, but I have two eyes.”
“That sounds oddly specific,” Potter said, but he with a teasing smile. “And I could always reappear to be your 36-year-younger husband in the future once again so they’d just have shut up.”
“I’ve noticed,” Harry said, but his thoughts were elsewhere. At twelve? That was the year of the Chamber of the Secrets. Draco couldn’t even leave the school for that year, for it was their third year they were officially let to Hogsmeade regularly. How did Draco sneak out to have sex with a stranger in their second year? And whom was it that—
Harry often just picked up the most practical clothes, and let Draco choose for Sev and Ed, but as the kids grew, they needed less and less consultation about fashion from their Dad.
Then, when the Griffindork didn’t get lucky at all, she somehow felt sorry for him instead of laughing.
It was such a perfect plan Lucius couldn’t help but love himself more than the adoration he already did carry for himself. Well, Narcissa had no taste in men that she didn’t value him nearly enough.
Pictures of a worn out and tired Harry coming home from work who would be too tired to even talk with Severus flashed before Draco’s eyes.
“Is there something else you would like to read, Severus? Some fiction about witches and wizards?” Draco noticed when Severus was tired of studying, a good story always made him energetic again, even if Draco didn’t think much about novels.
He had better shields than most, but there were too many of them. Even Apparating away only got rid of the attackers for seconds, until most could follow.
Potter went so red it was just pure exquisite entertainment. He also did shout at Lucius and that told him he was going somewhere with the guessing.
“Great,” she said curtly, no humor in her voice.
But he also realized something when he let his anger go. His almost panic-like fear of making a decision that could ruin his future came from the fact that - uncharacteristically - he had a
Then, to Draco's shock, Tobias gestured at the curtains and they moved as if the wind was moving them, except they were indoors, without any windows open.
Draco was in his study when Potter stormed through, with an expression as if someone died.
“No, I’ll only change his hair color to match mine, it should add to our cover,” Draco said. “But you know this all still might not be enough? They could use several rituals to find someone who is related by blood to them. Even if some take a lot of time to prepare, and some key ingredients cost a lot of money.”
“Don’t worry, Harry,” she told him. “I’m sure he’s just hiding. Assholes tend to be Merlinly lucky, after all.”
“Anyway, I could spend a lot of money, and never look like you.”
“Are you seriously picking a fight, Potter?” he questioned because part of him couldn't believe the idiot.
“No. It’s… I would like to continue studying with Draco, if I could,” Severus stated clearly and politely. “And my mom is okay but… She’s sent me away.”
Harry wanted to tell Malfoy he won’t take any money from him if he didn’t work for it at least, but Severus got so excited hearing they’d spend some time together he didn’t want to revert to their usual banter in front of the child.
Showcasing to Draco what he was missing out on, reminding him it was his decision.
“Draco has already told me. I’m not allowed to interfere in adult business I do not fully understand,” the kid recited. “Please don’t be mad.”
“You could punish me if not.”
When Harry was promoted, he used the opportunity to celebrate with Draco first. They had a great date, a dinner and altogether a very nice night…
He went to the war expecting to survive because he always did. He went to Voldemort because at that point he felt like he had no other choice. When it came to the end of the war, he was relieved.
Was it bad that Harry would have loved to see Draco even in clothes that didn’t fit him so well?
“Good plan, except I lost contact with Eileen months ago, and we can’t marry,” Draco noted.
“Severus is right, you can surely take a break from things I didn't even ask you to do,” Draco unexpectedly chimed in. “The elves might soon rebel if you leave them without any work.”
He wasn't expecting a reply, but Draco must have been high on some regeneration potion ingredient because Harry heard him say.
“No, you’re not!” Fayre did a non-verbal spell and both of Harry’s and Hermione’s wands were gone. “I’m treating him for Krashkalwiat!”
Maybe he was so worried about the possible threat of Eileen just coming back to snatch her son away again, and getting up every time he heard Severus having a nightmare in the next room to comfort him, that Draco could really use the sleep.
It could have been funny if Malfoy didn’t automatically distance himself from Harry, and now the boy who lived couldn’t see everything from Malfoy’s body, even some things he might not intend to see.
He kinda hoped he’ll meet the girl again, in the same bar, so he kept going back, but no such luck.
Thank you all very very much for reading! <3
Only, both brooms were full-size and battered as they were, they still flew quite fast for a complete beginner, and Harry didn’t think about that. He only saw a broom at age 11, and being a natural, never had any concerns...
Eileen worded it differently, saying that if they kept fighting, Severus would think they’d get rid of him, but what Harry asked was also true.
“Then we’ll wait a couple of days. I’m not risking facing Tobias and her with you hurt,” Harry kissed Draco, but only softly, as if a simple kiss could also break him until full recovery.
“I’m not worried about her. Not right now, at least,” Draco shrugged. “It’s more what it does to Severus. A girl gave him her doll the other day, and he threw it back at her. Not to mention, he’s doing unbelievably well academically, but is he happy?”
“My name is Eileen Snape, who are you?” she asked.
Draco, who was already jealous once, when Harry’s heartbeat wasn’t beating as loudly as it was now. Not to mention, if Harry managed and declined any advances from their new friend, he didn't want Matt to start flirting with Draco either.
“You. Figured. Time-travel. Out.”
In exchange to get out before Eileen could show up again, they needed to do this. And they both knew it.
“Severus, you should let Harry read,” Draco said, making Potter smile. They always referred to each other by their first names in the presence of Severus now, but
“If you do that, I would like to be the one to check on the future now, if that’s alright with you.”
Edwin took another sip of his wine when he knew he already had too much.
And he wasn’t attempting to travel forward for now, but back at first, experimenting only with 24 hours difference.
“I know.”
“You’re joking, again.”
“Actually, Draco is now a Black from Narcissa’s side,” Hermione eyed the body of the witch on the floor wearily. “I wasn’t going to tell you, but—”
They ended up on the floor, and with Malfoy under him, struggling. Every time Harry had daydreamed about this happening, he never imagined this, but even before he could finish that line of thought, the crystal in Malfoy’s hands suddenly emitted a blinding light and a deafening noise, pushing them both back into the air.
Harry didn’t know how strong Eileen really was, and how much of it was just bluffing, but it wasn’t something he was willing to risk.
There was completely no need to encourage Draco’s unnatural obsession with Potter any further by observing him taking baths just because it didn’t even seem to occur to Potter they might need some separation sometimes.
“This is going to hurt,” he warned, when Harry was already dripping on the front, as well as somewhat prepared on the back, lubricated with all the charms Draco used after making Harry come a second time. “But it’s not like I care, so you should brace yourself.”
“Because I couldn’t find you earlier. Up until the moment your magical signature just resurfaced, which no doubt drew the Death Eaters to you as well. What were you thinking, going to a public place just like that, anyway?”
“You sure?” He smiled at his expression, a mix of fear and panic with a tiny bit of determination.
“The way he looks at you.”
“What do you want,” he tried to ask, taking a step closer.
“You really don’t. I think Blaise has a girlfriend now, if that helps."
“Because you needed to hear it. Listen, I don’t know if we will ever become friends, but I don’t hate you, I actually think you are a brilliant wizard and an amazing teacher. If I can help you, I will. We share a lot, might as well help each other, talk things through, let go of the past like you told me to do.”
“Go back to therapist.”
“Did you just come because I told you I love you?” Draco asked, amused, still stroking him slowly and milking the last of his orgasm.
“Harry. I wasn’t sure you were going to come.” McGonagall smiled at him from behind her desk. Nothing had changed inside from the last time he had been in that office. He immediately turned his head and caught a glimpse of Dumbledore winking at him.
“Didn’t you say you can cook?”
“Well at least now you get why I’m so worried about your job.” He pinched his side, then kissed him quickly to make up for it.
“Of course, especially if you asked her. Yesterday night as she was leaving, she told me she liked how you are with me, and that she is happy for us.”
“This, definitely this,” he said, his voice already raspy.
“Not really, no. I’ve felt... as if someone was watching me though, when I go to Hagrid's. I could feel something lurking, but I always thought it was some of the usual animals.”
“Just bear with me.”
“I’m sorry it took me so long.”
“I don't have the time to unpack all of this," he said, half shocked. “I was thinking about following you maybe? Trying to see from far away if I can spot anything.”
“I know this place better than you.”
“Woah, optimistic.”
“They already have a Defence teacher, why not him?” Malfoy was clearly not pleased with the request. Whether it was because of him or the subject, Harry didn’t know.
“McGonagall asked me, well us really, to keep going with the Duelling club after Christmas. One night a week, whoever wants can come, and I’m allowed to sleep here.”
“How many victims are we talking about?” he asked, now concerned. That did sound like a very peculiar case.
“Mostly quills and ink. But I wanted to start looking for Christmas presents.”
“A kitten?”
“Are you okay?” Draco put his hand on the small of his back and stepped closer.
“Potter, my saviour,” he said dramatically, bringing a hand to his chest.
“So, how is work going, boys?” Narcissa asked, trying to break the tense silence.
“I wanted to become a healer,” he said, almost in a whisper. “Then I realised that no one would have wanted a Death Eater as a healer, and that I probably wouldn’t have been able to deal with death anyway.”
“I should have known you were a sap,” he said, faking annoyance, clearly not used to hearing those things and thus at a loss of what to say.
“Okay you are going a bit too far, mate. I might find him attractive but that doesn’t mean I wanna marry him. He is hot sure, and we get along, but that's it. Besides, I don’t think he likes me.”
“Day one and he's already back to his old habits.”
Harry took off the cloak and got closer to the desk. “I didn’t want to listen to that, I just couldn’t leave.”
“I know, Saint Potter can’t even sit on his arse for two seconds without finding himself a mission where the whole future of the wizarding world rests upon his shoulders,” he said. “But I’d be happy to grow old with you in all glorious boredom if we finally could arrange for Severus to be safe. And Edwin.”
“I’d like to think, but then explain why someone gave Severus the impression I’d be proud of him if only he could care about his brother a little more.”
dated a 17-year-old, who is 18 years younger than him, the Ministry will get rid of him.“
So he kept his shields up, and in the meanwhile, he tried and failed to come up with a plan. However, his dumb-Potter-luck didn’t seem to completely run out, at least not yet, because as he was trying to put some distance between him and Malfoy, he palmed something soft and sturdy on the ground.
Harry would be lying if he couldn’t see a connection between these new sleeping arrangements, and how well he was doing with his research.
“If you go on and kiss random Malfoys, the next one better be me, Potter.” Damn, that sounded territorial. Kinda hot.
“Well, I’m sorry I wanted him to get some fresh air when you keep him glued to books the whole day!” the sentence was out on Harry’s mouth before he could rethink it.
Wizarding media was all over him. Hermione working at the ministry made him appear on all sorts of functions he didn’t want to go.
“And if we did?” Harry waited for this objection clearly, because he already knew what he was going to say.
“You’re saying I should give my son up to a stranger.”
“No, no, that’s not what I—”
“I might have talked with him, and said something like that.”
“And I made sure he wouldn't burn down the kitchen,” Harry added, while Mindy bought in a tray with a plate that was covered.
Harry kept telling everyone stupid stories about how they were a perfect couple, almost daring anyone to question it.
“Gods, yes. Please, I’m ready.”
“Yes, that's what I thought until I saw this,” Potter just tossed a Prophet at Draco, but while he was distracted, the thug in the background cornered him, and even before Draco could warn Potter about it, hit the Saviour of the Wizarding World so hard that Potter fell to the floor.
Harry got up first. To say that he was surprised was an understatement when he woke up with the very naked Draco Malfoy snuggled close to Harry, his expression completely different from the Draco Malfoy he was when awake.
Draco checked a hundred times, and there was still no way he saw for escape. Yet, he was so furious he still kept trying out spells, testing the magic’s force and searching for any weaknesses in it.
Thank you guys for reading! XOXO
. Maybe mustard-yellow, or—”
That’s why that woman was able to get in and make Harry uncomfortable every day.
“We’ve met,” Draco nodded curtly.
“I assume you must have learned modern warding charms on the run. This building has a security system that’s at least 50 years old and could kill anyone nastily for a wrong move, but let intruders just walk in easily if they approached the house a Muggle way, as far as I can tell. You could fix that, as a start,” Malfoy announced.
He wanted it so much a simple Malfoy-like sentence like that already rattled him. Draco almost wanted to see how much more undone Harry could become if he were to push him, but he couldn’t.
Ed just drowned some more wine thinking he’d have to do this twice now, but he also needed to talk about reestablishing certain exchange student programs with Carlos.
“You’re a teacher?” Harry asked, and Edwin shrugged.
“I didn’t even know it was possible," he said, taken aback. “Come, let’s get you settled.” He got up and went to his bed, which had been made that morning by some house elves. “Do you want to borrow a pyjamas?”
“I thought it was going to take longer to get used to this.”
“I just don't think you’d like the answer."
“Nothing would give me more pleasure than seeing Malfoy frustrated,” he said, while he was still trying to type. “Merlin, took me long enough.” He closed the phone and left it on the table. “Hermione gave me your number, I wanted to send you a text but I figured an owl would take less time.”
“I never thought you’d give me a special treatment. But please, do go on.” He smiled at him, a fake and sugar-coated smile that he was sure was going to piss Malfoy off even more.
“Well, good thing we are wizards.”
“Fuck,” he muttered, staring at a point over his shoulder as to not meet his eyes. “What else did she say?” he asked, clearly scared she might have revealed too much.
“I don’t know what happened,” he admitted. “I don’t even know if you were hurt or if I was.”
“I have nothing to compare it to.”
“Your father is in the library, could you please go and tell him dinner is ready?”
“Aren’t you two together?” he asked, confused, finally turning his head to look him in the eyes.
“Sneaky. I like it.”
“Well I can, I’ll see you tomorrow, gentleman.” McGonagall got up and left, leaving them very red and embarrassed. How could they have forgotten that she was there?
“True. Okay, stop it, now
“Well, get all your hopes up ‘cause that’s not gonna happen,” he said, hoping Draco could hear just how honest he was being, how much he really wanted it.
“I’ll come," Draco said, sounding very resolute. Harry did not like it, not one bit. “Don’t look at me like that. If you don’t think it's dangerous enough to ask for help then I can come too.”
“And that would be me?” He looked so shocked it was almost funny. Serious and stoic Malfoy openly staring at him with his mouth slightly open.
He spent his afternoon going around London, looking at all the restaurants Hermione had recommended, and he eventually settled on
“Alright?” he said, almost like a question. He got up and they both said bye to Hagrid, who was just looking at them in a very weird way. He couldn’t blame him.
Suddenly they were back in the room. Malfoy was panting next to him, his hand still in his.
“Oh," was all he managed to say. He leaned back against the headboard, looking over Draco's shoulder because he was too afraid to look him in the eyes. He was one hundred percent sure that he would have been able to see his panic.
“Or we could do half-half” Draco suggested, petting their furry kitten. “I wouldn’t mind it, at least he can get used to your house as well.”
“We are working on that, yes. We, well, we kissed yesterday.” He blushed even more at the thought of their first kiss.
“If you keep this up, they will stop worshipping you soon enough. How long has it been since the last time you’ve eaten?” he asked, with his nose still wrinkled up in disgust.
“Yeah?” he said, his lips once again pressed against his head and his nose buried in his hair.
He dived in immediately, ignoring Malfoy's disgusted grimace. He was still better than Hagrid. Maybe. Hopefully.
Harry squeezed his leg once, meaning yes, and in less than five seconds Draco was coming inside his mouth, shouting his name and pulling on his hair, harder than Harry would have liked, but he wasn’t going to complain when he boyfriend looked so good.
“I’ve done it." Malfoy entered the room shouting and jumping, holding the Map against his chest as if it was his most prized possession.
“I wouldn’t do it if I were you,” the shop assistant told him. “Forgive me for my language, but that little thing is a piece of shit. He keeps biting everyone, consider yourself lucky you still have your hand.”
“I will.” Whether he wanted to or not, he knew he was going to think about it anyway. What if Ron was right? What if Malfoy liked him? He had the feeling he would have to be the one to bring it up if that was the case, because it seemed that Malfoy still felt unworthy of love.
“Mmh, I’ll ask Hermione.” He took out a cell phone from his jeans, and Harry almost started choking. “She insisted on me having this, especially if we have a kid. I still don’t get how it works. These tiny buttons are horrible.” He flipped the phone open and started pressing buttons as if it were a writing machine.
“Draco, what are you doing?” he asked, clearly confused.
“It's just over the corner,” the other girl said, “turn right and then go to the end of the street, you can’t miss it.”
“Babe?” He sat down next to him, on his side of the bed. Draco was already under the blanket, cuddled on himself. “Draco, I know It's hard, but you have to trust me.” He settled down next to him, hugging him until there was no space between them.
“Fuck,” the wizard said, but before he could move Harry stopped him with a simple charm.
“Okay then, if you are sure.”
“I’m here.”
“Hagrid.” He smiled at him and entered the hut as soon as Hagrid moved to give him space. “How are you doing?” he asked, sitting on a chair like it was his own home. Fang immediately plopped at his feet, and he started rubbing his tummy with his foot.
“Can I have a hint?” he shouted after him while he was leaving the room.
“Don’t worry, no reception at Hogwarts so I didn’t bring my phone.”
“Oh, sure. Alright, I can start if you want.”
“See, he already likes you. Feel free to come and visit him whenever you want. Just make sure you bring him some food, he likes to be wooed.”
“But I do.”
“It has to happen sooner or later. When we get married, they will all be there.”
“You know I respect both of you and I appreciate both of your work, but don’t think I forgot how things were between you two. I don’t want to see you in that infirmary ever again, not while I’m in this school.”
And that was the reason he never became a teacher.
“Life," he said, with a voice that sounded like nails on a blackboard.
In that moment Theodore decided he needed their full attention, and they spent the rest of the day holed up in Draco’s room playing with him, asking the elves to bring them food so they wouldn’t have to leave even for their meals.
“You did? And how did it go?” He sounded curious, but not in a nosy way, which was something Harry really appreciated in that moment.
“It's the pyjamas, it sets the mood. The rattier and older, the more I want to cuddle with you.”
“I know.” Without thinking too much about it he lowered his head next to Hermione's.
“Yeah, I always do when I sleep with you.” He had discovered pretty soon that not only was Draco Malfoy a cuddly person, he was also a huge sap first thing in the morning.
“So, how come you have never seen one of the bodies before?”
working.”
“Okay, thank you.”
“That's the problem. I have a lot of power over them, I want to use it as best as I can.”
“Did you really?” His smile was so big and pretty that Harry just had to kiss him. “Thank you, I love it.” He quickly hugged him and then he took the pyjamas out of the box to touch it. “I have a confession to make, though.”
“Ehm, Draco's, if that’s okay.” He could feel himself blush, and seriously, how old was he again? He was a man, he was allowed to be in a relationship without feeling embarrassed. That was, however, someone who had seen him as a baby and then during puberty. That poor woman.
“I don’t understand why you like me so much.”
“But do you like him? You’ve always had a weird obsession for him.”
“Oh, so we are dating, uh?”
“But-“ Harry tried to protest.
“I make no promises, but you may try.”
“I’m confused, but physically I’m fine.”
“There you go.” Draco settled the plates on the counter and held one up for Harry to fill with the risotto. It was all so domestic, Harry felt like screaming.
“I’m not doing anything. Let them be, they’ll get tired soon.”
“Sir.” Harry offered Draco his arm, and he immediately put his hand on the crease of his elbow. “Ready?”
“Are you staying there full time? I thought you might be going home from time to time.”
“Could it be his ghost?” Hermione asked. The Map showed ghosts after all, maybe something happened that had made him into one.
“Shall we go?” he asked while getting up. He checked one last time that Theodore had enough water and food and that all the surfaces were clean in case he wanted to snoop around.
“Hi, can you please lower your voice?” He pointed to Draco, who hugged him closer in his sleep. “Fuck,” he whispered, not able to hide his huge smile. He reached out for a blanket and threw it over his shoulders.
“Uh, as Mal- Professor Malfoy was saying, these lessons are just a precaution, but you really shouldn’t have to use any of these spells if you are smart enough to stay away from the forest. What we are gonna do is show you a normal and simple duel, then we want you to get into pairs or groups of three and work on disarming each other. Everything's clear?” No one answered, so Harry took it as a yes and turned to Malfoy. “Ready?” he asked.
“Harry,” Draco said, scandalised.
“We don’t know yet. Dead animals were found in the forest, no organs, just skin and bones but no evidence of an attack, and I think I saw something the first night we went there, but I have no idea what it could be.”
“I can’t believe you just said that,” he said, not able to contain his laughter. “Remember that I can’t speak with snakes anymore, don’t throw one at me.”
“Okay, good. I’m really relieved.” He hugged him from behind, kissing his neck.
“Thank you, my love.” He smiled at him, and finally moved the blanket away. Draco was in his boxers, because Harry was set on the house always being very hot, so he wasted no time and leaned down to mouth at his dick, gently dragging his teeth over the cloth.
“What are you going to call him?” he asked, finally leaving the aisle to go pay.
The students started mingling, and in a couple of minutes they were scattered around the hall.
“Malfoy, please, slow down.” He caught his arm and stopped him. “What happened?” he asked again, letting go of him immediately.
“It’s a big responsibility.” He reached out to touch his side, looking for some physical contact.
“He entered school the night-" he stopped, and Harry immediately put his hand on his. He remembered Draco that night. How scared and vulnerable he had looked. He wasn’t Draco Malfoy the death eater, he was just a frightened teen.
“Don’t let this get to your head, Potter.”
“It's-" He stopped, kicked the ground in anger and just spun around. “It's you, yes.”
“Harry, please,” he begged, having had enough of the teasing.
“You mean that you me to cook for you.”
“Will you ever be? You love these animals, maybe you just need to get another one.”
“You are really pretty when you cook,” he said softly, nuzzling against his neck. “So concentrated and precise. It’s almost sexy.”
“I’m proud of you for telling me and being open to the idea of seeking help.” He held him closer when he felt Draco getting uncomfortable.
“Thanks.” He blushed the prettiest shade of pink, and lowered his head on the Map. “It's gonna take a while to find out who everyone is. I know a couple of centaurs and I think Hagrid can help us with a lot of other creatures, but it might take a couple of days to find what we need.”
“Eh? Oh, right.” He quickly changed to muggle clothes, and together they left the shop to wander around and look for a coffee shop.
“Their blood was... drained. No cuts, no blood on the ground, it just disappeared.”
“I’m glad. I won’t lie and say I’m not finding it incredibly amusing how uncomfortable he is, but he is alright.”
“Well he seems very friendly, that’s for sure,” she said, raising both of her eyebrows suggestively.
“Sounds good.”
“They said that Harry Potter didn’t fight for us to still walk around this school, that he must hate us all and that we should just leave.”
“That sounds nice,” she tried to say, still not fully convinced.
“Fuck, this is good,” he groaned, and Harry knew he was close by the way he was trashing on the bed, how he could barely hold his legs still and how his hips kept lifting up even with Harry pinning him down. “Can I come?” he asked, desperate.
“I just want to be left alone for at least another ten years. I lived and risked my life enough times, now I want to enjoy the small things. I want to enjoy my friends, my family, and my relationship. I have time to live, I just want to find the right person to do it with.”
“I guess? Why?” he asked, confused by the sudden change of topic.
“Did you actually manage to make him speak?” she asked, impressed.
“I don’t have time to cook and my elf sucks at it, I eat like this only when I visit the Weasleys.”
“We chat a lot. She's been really great these couple of years, she encouraged me on multiple occasions to find a partner.”
“That’s not how you eat it,” he teased, looking at him as if he had gone mad.
To his relief but also somewhat disappoint, they made it out of the forest without stumbling upon any weird and dangerous creature.
“You succeeded.” He sat up, looking down at Harry. “I’m sorry, it must be frustrating for you.”
“Just because it's you and you were nice tonight, I won't make you carry me to the castle. You’re welcome.”
“What do I get if I stop?” It was so unfair the fact that he could look innocent even when he was being such a pain in the ass. And not only innocent, he looked so adorable, so happy that he could get a rise out of him without being mean.
“Good. Take care, Malfoy.”
“Babe, can you pass me the bell peppers?” he asked, and now he was calling Draco ‘babe’ casually, just because he could and because it made him blush slightly. Turns out he wasn’t that against pet names.
“I know, but their intentions are different, and they still respect and follow their owners. If this thing is out of control, we might be able to detect its intentions, desires, all that stuff that makes us more human.”
“If it's not a problem.”
“I want to do things right, and you deserve the best.”
“Do you think it could be a sort of ritual?” Malfoy asked McGonagall. He had gone very pale, and it looked like he was sweating more than usual.
Thankfully for him, Draco was a very heavy sleeper and he liked his beauty rest, so when he was finally done with breakfast he was still sleeping, now cuddled to Harry’s pillow.
“Thank you so much.” He smiled at them, then quietly murmured a Confundus and took the necklaces from them. “Have a good day.”
“Alright, sounds like a good idea.”
“You sneaky little shit," he muttered. “You get a piggy back ride from the gate to the front door.”
He simply nodded and walked away, leaving Harry to admire his back and the way his trousers covered his arse. Okay, maybe he liked him a bit, so what? Malfoy was fit, big deal.
“Of course, dear.” He kept holding him, sneaking his hands under his sweater.
“It's more for the school than for you, Merlin knows I can’t stand a whole year of Draco complaining about missing you.”
“How is it going with Draco? You two seem really close now, there were bets going around the school that at least once a week one of you was going to be in the infirmary.”
“It is, " he agreed. Which, wow. Hermione would have been proud of him. Never in a million years would he have thought to agree on something with Malfoy.
“Why? We always got along so well,” he said, his sarcasm clear from there all the way to London.
“I’d let you take a nap but then you wouldn’t be able to sleep tonight.”
“Okay, then what’s the problem? Do you not like teaching with me? Because I can do it alone and then come here to spend time with you. Or have my own room if you need space. Is that the problem? I’m not imposing my presence too much, am I?”
Draco stirred, then wrapped his arms around him and tried to go back to sleep.
“I don’t know if I can do it. Harry, I’m not good with kids, kids hate me,” he said, looking very much desperate and on the verge of a breakdown.
“Yes, Potter for two.”
“Go with them, I got this,” Ron told him, not that he really needed his authorisation considering he had already decided he was not going to leave Draco's side until he was fine.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean-“
“Not creepy at all,” Draco muttered when they were almost out of the door.
“Be careful, please,” Draco whispered in his ear, grabbing his arm with way too much strength.
“They don’t, you are just awkward around them. Teddy took a while but eventually he warmed up to you. You’re gonna be an amazing father, I promise you.”
“Alright. I just have to get used to the idea that no one will ever replace Hedwig, you know? I might never have that same connection, but I like the company of a pet, I like taking care of it.”
“What are you doing here?”
He stayed there for a couple more minutes, just looking at the birds and touching the ones who would let him, then he finally left and went back to his room to prepare their next lesson.
“What a fucked up family.”
“You know I don’t have it in me to wake you up more than twice.” It was true. Just a couple of days earlier they had ended up falling asleep again because Harry felt bad waking him up when he looked so peaceful. “We need to eat breakfast. If you get up now, we could even have some time to play with Theodore.”
“Yes. They smell like you and they are very soft.”
“You probably do” he agreed. It was true after all. Even with Ron he got bored after a whole day spent together, and yet here he was, spending most of his waking time with Draco and not getting tired for even a second.
They went back inside, everyone had moved to the living room to talk, while Ron and Hermione were waiting for them at the kitchen table.
“Of course. Did something happen?” he asked, immediately concerned.
“I like the way you taste, this is my Christmas gift.”
“Idiot.” He barely contained his laughter, then he opted to finish his appetiser.
“We will play before leaving,” he said, reaching our and picking up their new toy.
“I'm spiralling,” he told Draco. Their therapist – yes it was the same after all, they had talked about her – would have been so proud to know he was opening up and sharing his discomfort instead of hiding it.
“Did I miss something?” Ron asked after a couple of seconds of incredibly tense and awkward silence.
“You do realise that the whole meaning of something spontaneous is to do it out of the blue, right?”
“Probably around Christmas, so a couple of weeks. I’d need to plan our port keys and it takes time.”
“Good then. I’ll see you around.” He smiled at him and started walking up the stairs.
“Mmh?”
“Yeah. I wanted to have the chance to apologise, which I of course never did because I got scared.”
“It's not a problem. Also, I think we should start discussing about these lessons we have to do. Would you like me to collect some information about what they have done so far in each year?”
He quickly changed his hair to auburn and hid his scar, then he went inside.
“I’ll always have faith in you,” he said, and it sounded way softer that he had intended it to sound. He let go of him to look into his eyes, but he kept close enough.
“Lucky you.” He kissed his should and rubbed his nose against it. “I know we wanted to spend the night together, but I'm about to fall asleep.”
He looked at his boyfriend to make sure it was okay to talk about it, and when he got his aapproval, he went back to facing his parents. “Well, there really isn’t much to say. We managed to find the witch who had turned Rowle into an inferius, she told us she simply wanted to try, but she probably turned him too quickly after his death or messed something up, so he managed to save a bit of his conscience and after a while he stopped obeying her. When he got dangerous she somehow managed to bring him into the forest and just left him there, where he started killing animals to try and come back to life, I guess? It would never have worked, he just had this notion that unicorn blood helps, and so he tried.”
“Well, first thing first I need someone who’s good at transfiguration and charms, to understand how the map works. I’m not sure how they made this happen.”
“Thanks for telling me.” He smiled at him and quickly leaned forward to kiss him. “I won’t let you run away, don’t worry about that.”
“I feel very wooed right now.”
“I really want to come.”
“Of course," said the smaller one who had done most of the talking earlier.
“How many are necessary. I can talk with your boss if you want.”
“Ours.” He finally opened his eyes and smiled at him. It was quite possibly the best sight in the world. Harry only wanted to wake up next to him from now on.
“Uh, well, we have a date on Saturday,” he said, feeling his cheeks heat up.
“It does. I was worried it was going to be weird at first, like how it always is at the beginning of a relationship, but I just wanna cuddle you as much as I can.”
“I guess. Although I don’t know how things are with them. They don’t talk much, he said they all tried to move on after the war and being friends reminded them too much of what had happened, so we will see. I’m also not particularly excited to meet Blaise.”
“So. This must be really weird for you,” Narcissa Malfoy started, leading him into the dining room. The table was right in the middle of the room, with only four places all very far away from each other. It was simply stunning, all white with crystal glasses and beautiful flowers in two twin vases.
They fell into a heavy silence, broken only by the noises of little animals running around the forest. “I don’t like how close it was to the castle.” He started walking again, going back to the safety of the grounds.
“See, we have something in common. If you want to tie me up then I'll never leave you and I’ll do whatever you want me to.”
“Thanks, mate.” They hugged quickly, then Ron left and Harry took care of paying.
“I can’t believe we had the same idea,” he said, amused, and he reached out to touch his knee.
Draco started stirring next to him, completely stealing all his attention.
“Alright.”
“Yeah, guess so.” He tried to ignore Draco's hand clasping around his arm. He was going to miss spending all his time with him.
“Next time I’ll wake you up,” he promised, not falling for Draco’s attempt at changing the subject. “Anything else I should know about you? I want to help you, not out of pity or because I have a hero complex, I just really care about you, and I want you to feel safe, around me and even when I’m not there.”
“You big sap, you scared me for a moment.” He hugged him immediately, hiding his face against his neck and smelling him, his shower gel and just the unmistakable scent of Draco. “We will see each other more often, and yes we will have to say bye twice but the time in between will be so short you won't even notice it.”
“I'll be careful,” he said, for the first time ever using a very gentle and careful tone with him. “Shall we see what we can find?”
“I see," he said, trying to sound as understanding as possible, because he did, he understood. “You know, it took me some time as well when I started working. Sometimes you see dead people, it's part of the job, and the first couple times I just had to leave.”
“I don’t think it's a good idea.”
“Oh God no, why would I like him?”
He rolled his eyes but didn’t push it further. “I need to send an owl, do you want to come?”
“And how would that help you?”
“What do you have so far?” Ron asked, curious.
“Well I just wanted to remind you that I don’t hate any of you. You weren’t even here when it happened, you have nothing to be embarrassed about. Your house is a strong one, and yes, a lot of dark wizards came from here, but also many great ones. And I want you to be the next good ones. Do you want to know a secret?”
“Like father, like son.”
“To where? I would have died and killed for my family, and you would have done the same. We are not so different.”
“You don’t have to pretend it’s a pleasure,” he said, smiling despite himself. He didn’t hate him, not anymore, probably he never really had, but it was uncomfortable. The last time they’d seen each other had been at Draco's trial, six years before.
“This is when you are supposed to say something nice to me.” He batted his eyelashes at him, patiently waiting for an insult. He knew his boy. Well that was new, his boy.
“Please do.”
“Is mother okay?” Draco asked his father.
“More than okayq.” He smiled to himself, feeling so incredibly happy and warm inside. He knew it was not like saying they were together, but knowing that Draco was at least willing to be seen with him made him feel really hopeful for their future.
“They like you, you know? I had a dream of my mum hugging you, and my dad smiling, I think that’s a good sign.” He was looking straight ahead, smiling absentmindedly.
“Ron took him to the Ministry, so that they can keep him away from people and also analyse him. The biggest mystery right now is how he killed his victims.”
died it became useless. Just a reminder of my mistakes.” He smiled sadly and diverted Harry’s eyes.
“Thanks. It's really important to me.”
“Yeah, I’m ready.”
“Thank you. Not for this.” He held up the pyjamas, relatively disgusted but fond at the same time.
“Yes, but I deserved it. I’m not angry at you, okay? I don’t think you even knew what it was."
“It's okay, it’s in the past. We’ve all done things we regret, haven’t we?” He absentmindedly started to touch his left forearm, right where the mark was.
There was a big pause. “Are you really worried my parents won’t like you?” He was most definitely trying not to laugh at him.
“Potter, you useless idiot,” he said, clearly too loudly, because some heads turned to stare at them and suddenly a group of girls were giggling. They were fucking giggling because of them bickering. “Fucking hell," Malfoy muttered. “What are we gonna do?”
They reached Harry’s room in silence, still holding hands and exchanging sappy smiles all the way there. Ron was going to hate this so much, Harry couldn’t wait.
“Sounds reasonable.” He was blushing, and Harry was dying on the inside. What the fuck was going on. They had made it official a week prior and they were talking about adopting a kitten. The scary part was that it was not scary at all. It felt natural, right, it all made so much sense in his head.
“For sure.” He smiled at him, a genuine smile Harry had never seen before, at least not directed at him. “I was asked to bring you to the headmistress’ office, if you’d like to follow me.”
Draco stiffened in his arms, then slowly lift his head to look him in the eyes.
“Still. I was a dick.” Yes, he still had no filer, all was well in the world.
“I will not confirm nor deny.”
“Too bad.”
“Oh. I didn't know that was a problem. We can use mine then, no big deal," she said, smiling gently at Malfoy.
“I’ll deal with him myself, see if I can get someone else involved to investigate the deaths.” If McGonagall was so worried, he just couldn’t find it in himself to decline.
“Of course. Do you want me to disguise myself?”
As dessert two
“Sorry. I’m going to empty my stomach all over the floor.”
“I mean, okay. Thanks,” the guy said.
“Thanks.”
“You spend too much time watching TV. Still surprised Hermione let you keep it.”
If he wasn’t sure about it before, he sure as hell was now. Malfoy was a completely different person. He truly regretted what he had done, and he was trying to make things better, not just to protect his conscience, but because he knew it was the right thing to do. He was no saint, far from it, and things between them were probably never going to change, but now he knew he could somewhat trust him.
“Okay, now the bad part.” He tried to smile encouragingly at him, knowing very well that at times it took Ron a little push to open up.
“You took me here to tell me this?”
“I’ll come with you,” Ron said. “Just to be sure. Maybe I could get the new boys to come as well.”
“I see. Did you use it in school?”
“Okay, I believe you.”
“Are we adopting a cat together?” Suddenly it hit him. What the actual fuck. They had talked about it two days before.
“I just- it felt right. I want you to know, just like I want you to know everything about me. You are part of my family now, and I hope one day I can give you what you’ve been missing your whole life.”
“The standards were very low,” Draco muttered, falling more into him. “How are you doing?” he whispered.
All the students stopped working and immediately grouped up like they had been instructed to, to go to their dormitories.
“I bet I could make you stay forever if I spoke to you in French.”
“You told me a couple weeks ago. You said there is this guy you’ve liked for years that you can't get out of your head.”
Harry didn’t answer and kept walking, or running more like.
“Of course, we will talk more next week.” He smiled happily at them and left, joining his wife on the sofa.
“This was a perfect date, thank you.”
“We think it could be a ritual. You know how Voldemort used unicorn blood to get his powers back?”
“No, she gave me a couple of names. We will try them all out, don’t worry,” he added, noticing how he had perked up at the mention of several fancy restaurants.
“Thanks, Ron, say hi to Hermione for me.”
“Okay, just don’t go over the top, it would be hard for me to beat you.”
“What can I say, I like doing dumb things.”
“Hermione and I decided to have a kid," he said, and even though he sounded happy, his eyes were wild and scared.
“Alright, but I want you to check my food. I don’t trust the one with the joke shop.”
“Hey, I’m the host, and the cook, be nice to me.” He was pouting, so what.
Draco rolled his eyes, but obeyed anyway and cuddled between his arms. “Thank you for being so patient and understanding.”
“Of course.” He looked at him quickly, to make sure he was ok. “Your mum was there as well, do you think that’s going to help?”
“I do not. I just like to show some love to the ones who are important to me.”
“I better go, I’m pretty sure Draco is going to need a break from Theodore very soon.”
Malfoy pointed his wand toward the map to see better, and they started looking at the edges, trying to see if they could make out anything from the forest. “It looks like it stops too soon.”
“I’m worried you won't enjoy it,” he said, not able to take his eyes away from Draco buttoning up his cuffs for him. That was so domestic and exactly what he wanted.
“He was related to you, right?”
“Do you think-"
“Rest, and call if you need anything.” Hermione leaned down over him to kiss his cheek, then she moved to pet Theodore. “He's really cute. Crookshanks would love to meet him next time you come visit.”
“I really need you to open this gift,” was all he said, and he gave him an equally small package, wrapped in green and with a tiny white bow on it.
“I just wanted some cuddles,” Draco said, embarrassed. It had taken him some time to get used to affection in public, and not even real public, just around Harry's friends, so he couldn’t imagine what it felt like to be in front of his parents.
“Really? I didn’t know that."
“I’m not, I’m just sad, I guess. I can’t even imagine what you went through, I just want to make you happy. You only deserve the best.”
He opened his eyes, and was met by his boyfriend's beautiful smile. “They are your parents.”
“How do you feel when you are there?” he asked, genuinely curious. If he still felt like he was being watched around school, he couldn’t imagine he felt safe in the house where Voldemort has spent time and killed people.
“It’s okay, really, it’s just because we’ve just finished dinner.” He cuddled closer to him and closed his eyes. He didn’t even care about the view on the Thames and the whole city below them, he just wanted to enjoy Draco’s company.
If it wasn’t that he had been trained to keep calm and collected, he would have jumped at the sudden intrusion.
“Of course it is, love.” He shimmied down to be able to rest his head on his shoulder. “And thank you for staying with me the whole time.”
“Not really, McGonagall just said I’m not on the case anymore.”
“You could have run away.”
“Yeah, I know. I’m not worried, it’s as you said, you two have a history. I guess I’m jealous of what you had with her, because it could have been me all along.”
“Look at you, you are fucking beaming.”
She smiled at him, her soft smile she still reserved just for him. “You two make a very bizarre but extremely balanced couple. Very weird if you ask me.”
“In the kitchen,” he shouted back, moving away from his boyfriend as to not be tempted to send his friends away and spend the night snogging him senseless. That was a really good idea, actually. No, he was mature and a good host.
“I never got the chance to say thank you,” Malfoy said, forcing his voice to be steady but refusing to look at him.
“Remind me to thank Hermione.”
“You can go rest in a proper bed, you know?” Draco said softly, moving his hair away from his face. “I’ll be fine on my own.”
“Maybe at first, but he seems smart enough, he will get used to it in no time.”
“I love you, ” he blurted, unable to just keep it to himself anymore.
“You think they heard a word I said?” Malfoy asked him in a whisper, sounding way less pissed that Harry would have expected.
“Okay, yeah that would be great.” He was holding on to the pensive, his knuckles white. “Are you scared?”
“Well, I haven’t eaten anything cooked by you, bust based on my past experiences I’d say yes.”
“I’m fine," he said, and the fact that he had snapped like that meant that he was anything but fine. He decided it wasn’t his job to push Malfoy, and that he was old enough to decide for himself.
“It's okay. Are you good to go?” he cut him off.
They got to his room, and immediately started setting up the things they had gotten for Theodore, while he sniffed around and took a tour of the place. Not that there was much to see. A small bedroom with just a bed, a closet and a desk, the bathroom, and a small living room with a sofa and a table.
Draco just turned around and stared into his eyes for the longest moment. “Will you ever start doing something for yourself?”
“Alright.” He got up and stepped over Fang, who was looking expectantly at Hagrid.
“She really is.”
“Well, I want to go on a walk with my lovely boyfriend, and I want to cuddle him until we have to go back to school.”
“I do.” He stared at him for a couple of seconds, then he sat up. “Wait here, I’ll go call Madame Pomfrey.” He got up quickly and left to find the school matron. He found her in her office, reading an old book. “Draco woke up,” he said as soon as he had her attention.
“Can I say something without you getting pissed at me?”
“Don’t be so dramatic, the fire is going and I asked for another blanket.” Still, he got closer again and hugged him, caressing his arm to make sure he was warm.
“So, is it like PTSD?” he asked carefully, ignoring what he had just said. He knew way too much about psychology for his liking, but his therapist had wanted to make sure he could recognise various symptoms for himself, and it was also part of his Auror training to know when someone was in a state if mental distress. He couldn’t diagnose someone, but he was pretty sure he could relate to Malfoy quite a lot.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked, even though he was leaning into him and hugging him back fiercely.
“What was this all about?” Ron asked, confused.
“Babe,” he called him, gently.
“Do you want to sleep in my room?” he asked, only then realising that it might have sounded a bit odd. “Like really sleep, I’m not trying to sleep with you.”
“Can I blow you?” he asked, as if he was asking about the weather. Draco had not been joking when he had told him about liking to please and give up control, and while he had told him he was okay with Harry waking him up by touching him, he always wanted to make sure Draco was in the right mood.
“I guess not, we haven’t even had our first date yet. I’m going too fast, aren’t I?”
“Of course love, you have a reputation.” He rolled his eyes, amused, and he turned around in his arms to face him. “What do you say we play a bit with Theo and then we start getting ready?”
Draco just laughed at him, not even one bit embarrassed, and he kept eating, looking very pleased with his choice.
“That’s a pity, you were really good at potions.”
“Sounds like a plan.” He opened his arms, and Draco immediately fell into him. “I’m proud of you,” he said softly, his mouth almost pressed against Draco’s soft hair.
“If that’s okay.”
“Really?” He took the Map from his hand while Draco dramatically fell on his bed, and he quickly read the names in the paper attached to it. There were so many names, but thankfully the list of creatures Hagrid didn't know was made up by less than twenty names. “I’ll send this to Ron and see what he can tell me.” He quickly wrote a letter for Ron, explaining briefly what he needed, and then he put it in an envelope with the list. “This is great, good job.” He turned around and found Draco still on his bed, his eyes closed and his chest heaving way too fast. “Tomorrow morning at seven I want you awake, you are working out with me.”
“Love, he can eat on his own," he said, unable to stop his huge smile.
“I know, and I get it. I just don’t want to see you like this, ever.” He let Theodore go, since he had started moving around as soon as he had seen the charmed mouse toy, and he moved closer to Draco to hold his hand. “This is my job, you have to accept it. There is a programme at the Ministry for partners of Aurors on a mission, or you could talk with Hermione, she’d understand.”
“Don't try and order snails.”
“Why thank you, love.”
“You have my word.”
“Yes, still able to eat. Come back here.”
“Okay.”
“I don’t think it's a great idea,” he said, thinking back to Malfoy's reaction to Voldemort’s name. “There is a lot of him in my memories.”
“Thanks.” He sounded almost relieved, and Harry couldn’t blame him. Their history was horrible, with an almost accidental murder, a year of following him around and several others of just being mean to each other. They were older now, and the war had shaped them. He didn’t think it was possible, he thought his life had already been quite traumatic, but the war had changed his perspective and how he went about in life. Now he knew what it really meant to lose so many people, to lose your home and all you had built in years of struggles. He knew he would never be the same, so really, holding a grudge against Malfoy because they had behaved like stupid kids didn’t make any sense.
“First year, first day of school. I wanted to be your friend so bad. Harry Potter, the boy who lived. I thought we could become friends and just win over the whole school.” He shook his head at that, clearly embarrassed. “What an idiot I was.”
They finally reached their table and Harry sat next to Malfoy, at the left edge. He leaned forward to wave at Hagrid, and then sat back to look at the Great Hall. He immediately regretted it when he saw all those eyes on him. It wasn't exactly new, but it didn’t make it any less weird or uncomfortable.
“Love, are you sure about this?” he asked, tying to sound as nice as possible.
Malfoy smiled at that, and finally got rid of his cigarette. “It seems like I keep having breakdowns whenever I’m around you.”
“Then be careful.”
“Of course.” He forced himself to smile, a bit disappointed about the prospect of being just friends. How could he get out of it now? He had a crush on Malfoy, his ex nemesis and newfound friend. And maybe he was being dramatic but why was it that his life was so difficult? He was pretty sure he deserved a break after what had happened but no, he had to go and fall for Draco fucking Malfoy.
“I’m surprised you even own these,” Harry grins, holding the sweats up. “Not really your style.”
“Yes, sir,” Harry responds cheekily, before stripping down to his boxers. Draco runs his hands over Harry’s pectoral muscles, then starts stripping himself.
“Eight o’clock tonight.”
Harry shrugs, drinks some wine. “I didn’t like it, when I first realized my feelings. Tried to forget about you. I moved, burned everything I had on you. Worked, for a few months. But I started seeing you everywhere. Blonde hair in Diagon Alley. The date Mione set me up on had grey eyes. I got used to it. Accepted it, for the most part, and hoped it would go away.”
“I was very obsessed with you after the war; I saved every magazine and newspaper clipping mentioning you. Gin and I had this fight after we broke up. I wanted to get back together, thought I could make her see reason, but she told me she was sick of my obsession with you. One of the last things she yelled at me before storming away was ‘Since you love Draco Malfoy so much, maybe you should go propose to him.’ It took me a while, but I finally figured out why that comment nagged at me so much.”
, Harry. It’s not impossible for you to kiss a witch or wizard. Remember, Hermione said there are a few wix you won't repel, you just need to find them. And to do that, you need to put yourself out there,” scolded Ron.
“Well, I’ll, uh, see you tomorrow, then.”
Draco waved his wand, bathing the foyer in the warm yellow light of the lumos.
Harry laughs, and the rest of their date sails on smoothly. They make small talk, about Harry's job, their respective friends, and Draco's mother. Finally, they finish their food and prepare to leave.
Draco stews over what Pansy said while filling out the forms. He doesn't need anybody to feel complete. He never has. It’s always been enough to just have his friends. But what if Pansy was right?
Harry coughs as they pull away. “So...Ron and Hermione’s wedding is in three months.”
Draco takes a deep breath, then casts the final spell, which works a little bit like Felix Felicis, influencing the ones under the spell to do whatever needed to be done. He feels the charm settle around him like a warm blanket, and knows somewhere else in London, the same spell settles over Potter.
Draco swallows his bite, and gives voice to the question gnawing on him all day. “Why did you ask
Draco groans. “I just said I
About a week later, Harry runs into Malfoy while jogging. Quite literally. Harry rounds a corner, lost in the music pumping through his earbuds and
Sighing to himself, Draco flipped through the file, examining the contents. The first page listed all of Potter’s vital information: his physical appearances, job description, former relationships, etc.
Draco huffs. “Of course you can stay! I don’t put out on the first date for just anyone, you know.”
“Romantically?” Draco furrows his brow in confusion.
Things die down a little near the end of his shift, half an hour before it ends, and there’s only one customer in the cafe. The customer in question had ordered something simple, iced coffee and a donut, despite being a teenager. Teenagers, Harry had come to find, love to order ridiculously complicated drinks that never fail to confuse him. Why does it matter that their coffees have to have so many fancy syrups in them? What’s wrong with good old fashioned cream and sugar?
They made their way to the small bathroom, and Draco started stripping Harry of his clothes. Once he was fully naked, Draco helped him into the shower.
Surprisingly, it’s Harry who makes the first move, just three days after their encounter in the park.
Draco smirks and flicks his wand, concealed inside a sleeve, drying Harry out. “Cleaning charms, Po - Harry. Ever heard of them?”
Draco moves his mouth from Harry’s latching onto his neck. Harry moans happily, pushing him harder into the door. Pretty soon, a decently sized hickey blooms.
“Can I ask you a question?”
Harry had groaned. “I know that, Ron! You think I don’t know that?” Harry had begun pacing and raking his hand through this hair, attacking it over and over. “I would if I bloody could! But I can’t even kiss wizards or witches! And I’m sure you remember the bloody nightmare my last relationship with a Muggle was,” ranted Harry.
It’s not like Harry doesn’t
“Draco?”
The kiss is hungry and desperate, all of their longing and want poured into the action. Harry pushes Draco against the door and Draco pulls him in, grabbing and touching. Fingers tug at hair and trail over skin, dipping below shirts. Tongues battle in their mouths, licking and biting, exploring each other.
It’s strange. Draco hasn’t cast a single diagnostic spell, and yet Potter’s signature has revealed so much to him already. None of the countless signatures he’s worked with before did that. Maybe it’s because he knows Potter intimately? No, that can’t be it. Draco remembers working with Theodore Nott’s signature, but it had never revealed this much to him, even though they were pretty good friends. Draco had read a book about the theory of magical signatures when he first started out, and could recall a passage about signatures revealing more to those they most trusted.
Malfoy turns pinker and nods once, weakly, then again, stronger. Harry blushes as well, and tells him, “Well, I’ll, uh, see you tomorrow, then.”
“Don’t get too cocky, now,” smirks Draco. “I said I’ve never met someone I was interested in, so I didn’t date. I’ve still had my fair share of one-night stands.”
Draco Apparates back to his office, clutching the bottle of Potter’s magical signature. He unstoppers it and pours the contents into a small Pensieve. Draco leans back and stares at it for a few minutes. A person’s magical signature is very unique, but Draco’s never seen one like Potter’s. It radiates caring and bravery and absolutely pulses with so much love it’s almost blinding. And he can tell all this from just glancing at it.
Given the size of his inheritance, Harry has no real need to have a job, but working keeps him occupied, and he found a pleasant job as a Muggle barista. The cafe had been one of his favorite places to cool down after his fights with Ginny, and when he saw the “help wanted” sign hanging on the door one day, he hadn’t hesitated and applied immediately. There’s just something strangely calming about mixing drinks and interacting with customers. Even rude customers are a welcome change from the fawning he receives from every single witch and wizard he meets.
“No, don’t do that, Harry!” says Hermione, and she actually looks a bit distraught. “You should bring an actual date.”
. I run at this time every day, no matter the weather.”
“Welcome to Hydrangea! I’ll be right with you.” The voice sounds familiar, and when the barista turns around, Draco realizes why. Because, of course, it’s Harry Potter.
“They’re thinking about hyphenating. Hermione says she’s fine with taking Ron’s name, but he wants her to keep hers.”
What?
“Morning,” Draco returns fondly. The hand previously stroking Harry’s hair moves down to his face, cupping his cheek. Draco runs his thumb over Harry’s freckles, then leans in to kiss him.
“Okay?” he asks.
Harry had taken to it like a fish to water. It doesn’t take his mind off things quite as easily as flying did, but it’s close enough. And so Harry had started running every day, and every time he needs to forget. It works wonders for his brain.
“What if I want you to take advantage of me?”
“Of course I’m listening. What I mean is, it sounds like you’re lonely
Draco’s stupidly grateful for the subject change. He hates having to talk about his complicated feelings. “Really? I haven’t heard of it.”
Still, he opened the file to check, just in case.
Wtf, Potter
Harry grins. “Well, if you insist.” He adds a third finger, then a fourth, and begins finger-fucking him in earnest, in, out, in, out. Draco moans and wraps a hand around his own dick.
Draco blushes at the thought. The picture Pansy paints does sound tempting, but it’s impossible. “Pansy, I can’t have a boyfriend, I told you that when I accepted the job at the Ministry.”
Draco shrugs. “I’m gay. I’ve known since I was five. My father wasn’t very accepting of it back then, though he’s mellowed out a bit under Mother’s influence, but I still wasn’t allowed to see other boys.” Draco swallows another sip of wine.
Draco mingles with the other guest as they wait for the wedding to begin. Harry is in the house, helping Ron get ready. Pansy sidles up, rescuing him from having to make conversation with Ron’s great-aunt Muriel.
But, Merlin, Draco had forgotten how many
“Ron! Hermione!” calls Harry.
“Yes, that-” Harry adds another finger, twisting slightly. Draco gasps at the sensation. “That feels good.” Harry scissors his fingers slowly, stretching Draco open. But it’s not enough. “Come on, Harry, I’m not going to break. Give me more.”
“So bossy,” smirks Harry, dipping in for a kiss. “I should’ve expected it.” He removes his fingers suddenly, leaving Draco feeling empty, but Harry thrust himself in with one fluid motion, and he forgets the meaning of empty.
“Are you okay? I’m so sorry, I didn’t see you and I really wasn’t paying attention, but I should have been, and really I’m sorry - ” Harry rambles on.
Draco hisses and swats at him. “No! Don’t stop now, I was enjoying myself!"
After that brief encounter, Malfoy shows up at the cafe every day. They don’t talk much, aside from the good mornings, but Harry falls a little bit in love each day.
“It’s me,” Draco says out loud, wonder coloring his voice. “
“No, you said you can’t have a soulmate. That’s different than a boyfriend. Plenty of witches and wizards don’t have soulmates.” She sips her tea, judging him with her eyebrows. Draco wrinkles his nose at her.
After lunch with Pansy, Draco heads back to the Ministry, where he has the paperwork from his last client to finish. It was a fairly easy case this time; the witches in question had already been tiptoeing around each other for months, his spell only opened their eyes to the other’s feelings.
Draco swats at him. “I don’t have time! I’m a very busy man with more important things to do, alright?”
, the Savior shows up again!”
As soon as he shakes his pants off, Harry pushes him onto the bed, crawling over him. He grips Draco’s ass savagely, kneading and caressing in equal measure. “Lube?” he grunts out.
His Floo fires up shortly, and Pansy steps through, dusting herself off. “This urgent matter better be important, Draco, I was in the middle of something. I swear to Merlin, if you called me here to complain about Potter, I’m leaving.”
. He can remember the signs from after the war, when Father was in Azkaban and Mother fell apart at home. She stayed in her room for
Potter turns around and gets to work making Draco’s coffee, while Draco studiously avoids ogling Potter’s ass. Obviously, he fails, because Potter turns back around and Draco ends up staring at his crotch instead. Ripping his gaze away from Potter’s goods, he pays for the drink and moves to take it. Potter’s fingers brush against his when Draco takes the drink, and he almost shivers at the touch. Draco heads for the door and is almost out when Potter’s voice stops him.
Harry might be going into shock, because a: it’s
“From what I heard,
Draco, in turn, brings Harry to the Manor a week later. His Mother takes to Harry immediately, and Harry likes her as well. His father, on the other hand, didn’t stay much longer than the introduction and a brief, perfunctory handshake. Draco had expected this, but it still prickles around old wounds.
(Personally, that’s something Harry would never get used to. He had grown accustomed to seeing an under-developed body whenever he looks, and it’s a bit surreal to have a body that isn’t just healthy, but thriving as well.)
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco pushes his way out of Greg’s bakery, his customary breakfast of cranberry scones clutched in his hand. He starts towards the alleyway that he usually Apparates to work from, but pauses halfway there. He had gotten up unusually early this morning, which means he has at least another hour before he has to be at the Ministry, and the weather is excellent. It wouldn’t hurt to walk there, Draco decides, and sets off toward the Ministry.
“Oh - uh - good morning, Malfoy,” stammers Harry, who immediately kicks himself mentally, because that was horrible. Was he twelve again? One word from his crush and he’s reduced to a stuttering mess.
“You don’t look too bad yourself,” Draco replies, blushing furiously as well.
Slowing his jog, Harry walks over to where his best mates are standing. Hermione looks harried, pulling a face not unlike the ones she used to make the months nearing finals, and Ron looks like he’s attempting to placate her.
Draco walks around a bit, trying to look around for Potter without looking too suspicious. He must succeed because no one shoots him any weird looks. He eventually spots Potter standing under a tree, chatting with Granger and Weasley. (Or is it Weasley and Weasley? Draco doesn’t know if they’re married yet, but from the way they’re standing, it’s clear they’re still together.)
Harry laughs lowly, kissing him. “Do you want to take a shower?”
Harry looked around the room blearily, eyes latching onto the lamp. “Are you the sun? Cuz you light up my life.”
But Harry only works four hours a day, even if he does work all week. There's only so much he can do, and whenever he gets bored, properly bored, that’s when he misses the Wizarding World the most. Well, one thing in particular: flying. It had always taken his mind off of whatever problem he was worrying about. Hermione, exasperated with his whining, had finally suggested running.
“Yeah, I was out for a run.” Both of them know what that means.
“Malfoy, wait!” Draco turns around, butterflies in his stomach. Potter scratches at his head. “Will I see you tomorrow?” he blurts out.
, in the cafe Harry works at, the decidedly
Draco makes pancakes and scrambled eggs, and watches with satisfaction as Harry scarfs it all down. Harry declares it “the best food I’ve had since Molly’s cooking.”
Because the customer is Draco Malfoy.
They collapse on their sides, facing each other, Draco tracing patterns in the come on Harry’s chest, Harry stroking Draco’s hair out of his face.
Draco sighed, shaking his head. “NO, Harry, do NOT flirt with the lamp.” Harry pouted, and Draco shook his head again. “Come on, let’s get you clean.”
Draco glances over at the owl. “Athena,” he muses. The owl hoots at the sound of her name, nuzzling his finger in reply. “It suits you.” He sends her off with his own response.
Draco has a good job. He works for the Ministry, which isn’t surprising, but he always thought that he would end up in Magical Law Enforcement or International Magical Cooperation. He never expected to be working for the Department of Mysteries. And certainly not with the Department of Love (aka Cupid’s Arrow).
“Oh I know it will, but weddings are always a hassle, and I still have so much to do!” frets Hermione.

“Top drawer. Condoms, too,” breathes Draco. Harry grabs the small bottle of lube and a silvery packet of condoms. He rolls one onto himself with shaky fingers, then uncaps the lube. Pouring some onto his fingers, he slowly inserts one into Draco.
Feeling just a tiny bit intrusive, Draco quickly casts the spell to gather a sample of Potter’s magical signature and watches it float towards him, invisible to everyone else. To his surprise, it isn’t an obnoxious Gryffindor red, but instead a soft green that Draco instinctively knows matches Potter’s eyes, tinged with red and yellow. Bottling it up in a vial he procures from a pocket, Draco Disapparates back to his office.

Draco smirked, focusing on cleaning the drunk man. “I am not taking advantage of you when you’re drunk.”
“Not the most agreeable weather for a walk though,” Harry comments, glancing up at the overcast sky.
How do you get ready for a date with the most famous wizard in all of England, no, the world? The Boy-Who-Lived-Twice, the Chosen One, the guy you’ve been crushing on since you were a teenager? The guy who, also, happens to be your soulmate?
Harry pulls in a breath, exhaling with a huff. “But then you showed up, two weeks ago. Like you stepped out of a dream.” He smiles, and Draco’s heart goes
A pleased smile steals over Draco’s face. “I’d love to have dinner sometime. With you.”
He can’t blame her for being so self-satisfied; she did do an excellent job with him. He’s dressed in black, skin-tight pants that Pansy declared “hugs his ass, and frames it perfectly,” and a soft, navy blue shirt that accentuates his eyes and “really makes them pop.” His hair is up in a messy bun that he knows Harry loves.
“Who the hell do you think you are?”
, reads the letter,
Just to clarify, Harry's owl isn't actually small, it's a breed called little owl.
“But…” Harry teases.
If Potter was engaged to Weasley, why does he have a file? Why was Draco assigned the file? Draco frowned. Maybe the file was a mistake. Maybe the file belonged to some other department. Draco knew he was grasping at straws even as the thought crossed his mind. He might not know how the other departments worked, but he was pretty sure Love was the only one that wrote the name on the outside of the file in
Malfoy shifts, and Harry realizes that he’d been spacing out. “Um, what would you like to order?” asks Harry, kicking himself for not speaking earlier. Now he looks like an even bigger dork.
“Oh I know, but weddings are always a hassle, and I still have so much to do!” Granger frets.
Draco gazes into Harry's eyes, smiling. “Only one way to find out,” he murmurs softly. Feeling strangely brave, he wraps his arms around Harry’s waist, pulling him in, their mouths colliding in a kiss.
Draco laughs. “If someone had told me six years ago that I would be dating Harry Potter, I’d have punched them in the face and threw a party afterward.”
Harry offers his arm to Draco. “Shall we?” Smiling, Draco takes the arm and they Apparate away.
by the time he got to Hogwarts, but the hot, prickly feelings that followed Potter’s appearance pretty much confirmed it.
“You’re drunk, sweaty, and you reek of booze, Potter.”
Hermione’s face immediately puckers up. She opens her mouth to say something, but Ron interjects. “Great! We have
“Good morning,” Harry rumbles softly, voice still raspy with sleep.
“So, I’m your first date,” Harry says slowly. Draco nods, and Harry bites his lip. “I can’t say I’m too disappointed about that. I like knowing I’m your first.”
Harry had told him to dress casually, which Draco’s a little grateful for, because he definitely would’ve thrown on a suit or something else of that nature. But even with a dress code, he has a hard time choosing an outfit. Finally, desperate, he sends an owl to Pansy.
one, and c: it looks like he’s wearing Muggle clothes, jeans and a polo shirt, under his robes.
Potter doesn’t seem to notice that it’s Draco that just walked into his cafe, instead handing the other customer his drink and waving him goodbye. Draco takes a moment to steel himself, and walks forward. “Good morning, Potter.”
The following pages described, in detail, Potter’s relationships. Draco wasn’t surprised to see Cho Chang and Ginny Weasley on Potter’s list, but he was taken aback when he saw Cedric Diggory. He scanned the pages until he found Diggory’s, which was only half a page long. Apparently, Potter had a brief fling with the Hufflepuff during his fourth year.
Draco directs his wand at the Pensieve and fires off the first spell, which tracts for all compatible signatures. He murmurs another spell that will mark all of Potter’s potential soulmates on his map, then another one that highlights the best match (his soulmate, essentially). Draco looks up at the map, expecting to see at least a dozen people, because it would only make sense for the great Harry Potter to have loads of soulmates. But there’s only one name on it.
“Wednesday.”
She tugs him in the direction of his bedroom. “Come on. Let’s get you ready for your date with the Golden Boy.”
“I haven’t thought about it since I started at the Ministry,” Draco says uncomfortably. This, of course, is a lie. Draco had thought about it far too much when he first began working at the Department of Love. It did seem a little unfair that he wasn’t able to have a soulmate, but he could date.
, he tells himself.
“I’ll have a coffee. Two creams and four sugars,” Malfoy informs him. He licks his lips, as if he can tell exactly what it does to Harry, who turns around to avoid doing something embarrassing, like lunging across the counter and kissing the hell out of him.
Harry had deflated. “I know you’re right, Ron, but I don’t think I could take the disappointment every time I’m not able to touch someone.”
Harry clears his throat. “Would you like to be?”
See, sometimes a person’s magical signature can change under certain circumstances. However, the circumstances are vastly different from changes in a Patronus. Patronus changes are widely influenced by feelings or a change in a person’s relationships. Changes in magical signature often had to do with a life-changing event (often traumatic), or drastic changes in personality.
“I was out for a run,” Harry answers. “You?”
“Ugh. As if I’d go out with any of them.” Despite his words, Harry can’t fight the smile creeping on his face.
Draco blushes and nods, first hesitantly, then more firmly. Potter, Draco’s pleased to note, blushes as well.
“I didn’t know Potter liked men,” Draco murmured to himself. “Figures he would.” After all, Potter had been the reason Draco started questioning his own sexuality. Well, no, Draco pretty much
Draco spots a quaint little cafe named Hydrangea Coffee Shop not even five minutes after finishing his breakfast, and it strikes him suddenly that he forgot to order a coffee at Greg’s. One glance at his watch tells him that he still has plenty of time before he’s late, so he crosses the road and pushes into the cafe.
“Smartass. Anyway, why do you work in a Muggle cafe? Surely Wizarding businesses would hire you.” Draco doesn’t sound condescending, instead genuinely curious, and Harry shrugs.
<><><><><>
I’m all the way across London, Potter. What do you want me to do?
Harry gazed at his boyfriend through half-lidded eyes, trying, and failing, to look seductive. “Wanna join me?”
“I suppose you’re right,” hums Harry.
Later that afternoon Harry sends an owl, a beautiful tawny little owl with a regal air.
“Harry’s right, Mione. It’ll be fine. Besides, I’ll be right here beside you the whole time,” adds Weasley, lightly squeezing her hand.
“Mmm, yes, I do know. I like the thought of my body fluids on you. Marks you as mine,” Draco responds.
Malfoy stares at him for a bit, then smiles faintly. “Only if you call me Draco.”
“I want you to fuck me,” Draco replies breathlessly.
kissed his boyfriend.
Harry hesitates, and Draco quickly backtracks. “What’s wrong? Did I overstep? You don’t have to, I just-” Harry stops him.
They dance with each other at the reception, whirling around with the other guests. “That’ll be us soon enough,” Harry murmurs, looking towards his best mates. The newly wedded Mr. and Mrs. Granger-Weasley twirls on the dance floor, oblivious to the rest of the people, eyes only for each other.
“Go to sleep love, it’s almost two o’clock.”
didn’t know he knew that, and it did serve another purpose: letting Harry know he was interested.
“Relax, Mione,” Harry placates. “Your wedding isn’t for another three months. Besides, it’ll be amazing.” This, he’s sure of. How can it not be? Not only are Ron and Hermione planning it, but Molly and Luna are helping as well. As a professional wedding planner, Luna has great (if a little unusual) ideas and Harry has never known Molly to organize anything and fail.
Draco falters, glancing up at Harry. “You are staying?” He sounds far too vulnerable for his liking.
Draco leaves the cafe feeling much happier than he has in a while.
Draco absentmindedly smiles to himself as he feeds Harry’s owl. He fetches some parchment and a quill, and starts penning a reply.
Harry pauses mid-bite and sets his fork down. “I don’t not like you. I just don’t like the facade of a cruel boy you put up in school. I know you aren’t that boy. You’ve changed, and so have I.”
The pair look up at the sound of their names, and Ron breaks into a smile. “Harry! Fancy seeing you here.” Harry accepts the hair ruffle Ron gives him with a grin and leans down to hug Hermione.
They do eventually make it onto the papers, after a date in Diagon Alley. Rumors fly, and they have a good laugh over some of the more absurd details. The Daily Prophet claims Draco to be Veela and Harry his mate. It’s widely known that Veelas require constant contact with their mates, and the Prophet says Harry’s too noble to let someone die, so he agreed to date Draco. Witch Weekly are notably distraught over the reveal of Draco’s sexuality, and claims Harry to be a vampire using his allure on Draco.
Draco sniffs. “Those were a gag gift from Blaise. I’ve been meaning to throw them out, but…” But they’re comfortable, he didn’t add. There’s really no need for Harry to know he sometimes lazed about the house in those sweats.
“Out for a walk,” Draco replies.
They trade letters like this for the rest of the week. Draco begins to look forward to seeing Athena’s regal form swooping out his window, and takes to leaving it open. No point in closing it just to open it back up twenty minutes later.
“No, not yet,” says Harry, kissing him, “but someday.”
The kiss is soft and languid. Slow. They have all the time in the world right now, and they use it to get to know each other. Harry’s tongue laps at his, and Draco bites his lip, tugging softly.
“Do you want breakfast?” Draco asks, murmuring into Harry’s mouth. He feels rather than sees the nod in response. Lips curving into a smile, he pulls Harry up. “Come on, then. Shower first, then get dressed.”
“Good morning, Potter,” says Malfoy. He looks calm, almost comfortable, as if he visits Muggle cafes all the time. Hell, maybe he does. Muggle places come with the convenience of nobody knowing who you are.
Potter looks good, though. Really good, and it almost takes Draco’s breath away. Potter had always had a darker skin tone, but while it made him look like he’d spent too much time under the sun in school, now it suits him. Makes him look like one of those models on Witch Weekly, with their gleaming skin and toned muscles. And the slightly too-small t-shirt he is wearing accentuateds his abs very nicely as well.
“Is that a proposal?” Draco returns, half teasing, but half hopeful as well.
When did Draco doze off, he didn’t know, but he woke up only hours later, in his bed.
forward to it.”
Since then, Hermione and Fayre were best friends, researching magic together, and having conversations Harry didn’t understand the half of. However, he learned a lot in the past - almost - two months.
There it was, a fully formed Patronus right before their eyes. It was a magical creature alright, which meant Harry was right. It might be why Draco Malfoy was incapable of producing it before.
Fayre wondered - for she didn’t really have anything else to do - what he needed a hostage for, and asked, but he didn’t tell.
“I was never born. Apparently, without Severus attending to Hogwarts, Lily and James Potter never even looked at each other twice,” Harry grinned. “Your parents, however, only started to ignore your existence when you sorted into Gryffindor.”
“Harry, you don’t have to leave just yet, stay!”
If not giving him ideas about some activities that weren’t connected to the research at all...
“I made six, but I also gave Mindy, Pinky, and Harry one,” Severus supplied, proudly smiling.
“NO!”
“Look, I’m sorry for yesterday—” Harry started but didn’t get to finish.
Therefore, newspapers. It even had the date on, easy to use.
Still, he might have almost jumped when he opened his eyes in the future, and Severus - a grown-up version - was standing beside his bed.
“Well then, where is my child?!” she demanded. “Where else could he have taken him? Or do you think it’s a coincidence your
“Merlin, you’re in no condition to walk around,” he couldn’t help but took a step towards her, but that only made her flinch as if he was about to hurt her too, until she schooled her expression back to neutral, noticeably Occluding.
Hope you guys don't hate it! XOXO
Although, trying to fight off the Death Eaters and healing Eileen at the same time was already an impossible task.
“Oh, so it’s ‘us’ now? One second ago, you were just about to kill me,” Harry still kept his wand trained at Malfoy, but couldn’t help to feel relief. A couple of minutes more of that attack, and he might have been a goner.
“He still had to grow up way too early, fearing how his parents’ relationship went because if it went poorly, he’d be punished. And although he’s doing well academically, he doesn’t have a single friend, even if it’s because of the constant moving around. And he was killed… way too early considering how wizarding lifetimes tend to be much longer. And the Goblins might have weakened Voldemort, but finally, we created another Dark Lord who was even more powerful.”
“Do you want me in your bed every morning now, Potter?” he asked in a sarcastic voice, not really waiting for an answer. He charmed his only suitcase for going and was about to leave right there.
“He has his own language?”
She did manage to otherwise look unshaken, but when they were no longer in front of Fayre, Hermione did hit Harry on the shoulders, quite hard too.
“You’re killing him because you always hated him! You might think you’re actually helping, but deep down you wanna punish him for all the things you didn’t have and he did!”
“But also: no books, no owls, no investment newspapers for you on this trip,” Harry counted on his fingers. “Meditation, walking, spending time with Severus without trying to parent him is allowed.”
“He can’t even be Obliviated,” she then wiped her eyes and looked at Harry with a new determination. “If I leave him, he might tell others, or try to hunt us all down.”
“I can’t. My husband was the only one who ever noticed me and stood by me even when my own family cursed me out. Everything we own, he worked for it, and I just…”
“Bad dreams?” Harry also seemed to fancy a nightcap, sitting down across the table.
“If I die before we could do this, find my other self in the past, and show her your memories,” she told Draco.
Harry decided he can just about to Apparate out from the bed, so he won’t wake the blond sleeping.
Harry felt a bit jealous of Fayre. Yet…
“The attraction?”
“I want to hear,” Severus, however, didn’t seem to care. “What was your scariest adventure?”
“Sorry Harry, I guess I shouldn’t talk about you at the Ministry,” now Ron apologized with a small smile. “Apparently, even the walls have ears.”
In the 1960s Britain, according to the internet, there could have been places without running water, and if a household/inn had one, it might have been just one tap, so I was hesitant to write they could have showers (in case you're wondering).
I would like to thank everyone for reading and all your kind support!
But it made Draco react before he could stop himself, enveloping Harry to an all-too sentimental hug, that wasn’t even heated.
Harry breaks out in a grin. “Alright then, Draco.” Maybe it’s a bit cliched, but he likes the way the name fits in his mouth.
“Yeah, mate. I know hundreds of people who’d kill for a  chance to be your date,” teases Ron.
Harry makes a face. “I...might have had a crush on you since sixth year,” he says reluctantly.
It’s not loneliness; Draco has company. Pansy meets him for lunch every Tuesday at that nice outdoor cafe place, and Blaise drops in every other week with his newest boy toy. He even stops by Greg’s bakery every morning on the way to work to see Greg and grab some breakfast. Not to mention pub night every Friday with his coworkers and whoever else joins them.
Malfoy seems amused by it, though, if the little lip quirk he makes is any indication. Harry is immediately mesmerized by those lips. They’re deliciously plump and moist, and Harry can picture them swollen from kisses, and,
When Draco wakes up, the first thing he notices is Harry’s arm wrapped around him and their legs tangled together. He blinks confusedly, before the events of last night hit him like a hammer.
“Of course,” Draco muttered to himself. “I thought I was done with Potter, but,
Draco picks up a slight hesitation. “That’s not all, is it?” he prompts.
reason, he can’t seem to touch anyone. Well, except for Muggles. Harry doesn’t have anything against dating Muggles, but it just isn’t the same as dating a wizard. For one, Harry constantly has to hide his magic from them, and he’s rubbish at lying. That’s why his last relationship failed so miserably. Harry constantly forgot to hide his magic and only just managed to catch himself every time he was about to draw his wand out and cast a spell. Simon had caught on to the fact that Harry was hiding something from him pretty quickly. Unfortunately, the Muggle had jumped to conclusions and assumed Harry was cheating on him and had broken up with him quite dramatically two months into the relationship.
Pansy’s jaw drops and her arms fall to her sides. “Did he really? When?”
Hermione starts suddenly. “Oh!” she cries. “I almost forgot. Harry, are you going to bring a date to the wedding? I want to get the seating arrangement done soon.”
Draco raises his brow. “Yes.”
“I think about it,” sighs Harry. “No promises, though.”
out, Harry? Not that I’m not enjoying this, or thrilled at your request, but I rather thought you didn’t like me.”
“Maybe,” Draco concedes doubtfully.
kissed
Harry takes him out on more dates; movies, dinner, even a stroll in a botanical garden. That date was cut short by a sudden onslaught of rain, but they made it back to Harry’s place and spent the evening in bed, so it wasn’t completely ruined.
Draco smiled softly. “I love you too.”
“Someday,” echoes Draco. Someday he and Harry will get a proper house together, maybe somewhere in the country. They’ll get married, settle down, and maybe even adopt some kids. But while Draco looks forward to all this, he’s pretty damn happy right where he is now, dancing with his boyfriend, surrounded by laughter and friends.
Draco smiles and turns to the waiter. “I suppose I’ll have the oysters, then. Thank you.”
After his break-up with Ginny, Harry had pretty much ignored most of the Wizarding World and retreated to the Muggle one. He bought a flat in Muggle London, because he couldn’t bear to live with all of the memories Grimmauld Place was riddled with, and had Hermione help him charm his new space so the Muggle appliances would still work with all his wards and magic.
Draco pocketed his phone and slid up to the bar, where Harry and a greasy blond man was sitting. Draco put a protective arm around Harry and squeezed. “Hey.”
top secret, and not to be discussed outside the department, ever, but aside from that, nothing seems different from say, DMLE or DIMC.)
Harry visibly brightens, looking like a child promised candy. “Ok!”
Satisfied, Draco rolls the letter up and ties it to the owl’s leg, watching her take off, soaring in the direction of Harry’s house. She returns with a reply soon after.
“Oh, yes,” Harry confirms wryly. “Hermione’s
But sometimes he’ll come home from the Ministry, or from visiting Pansy or Greg, and he’ll feel this strange, almost lonely feeling, but it’s not loneliness. It’s something else, but not anything Draco can put a name to.
“Great! That’s - that’s really good.”
Draco wants to smirk at Potter’s speechlessness, especially since Draco is the source of it, but refrains himself. If he’s being honest, Draco can’t really blame him; he’s having trouble remembering how to speak as well. Because while Potter looked good soaked with sweat yesterday, he looks even better cleaned up and in an apron. “I’ll have a coffee. Two creams and four sugars.”
In his defense, Malfoy looks incredible. All of his clothes are tight, clinging to his body in a way that leaves no room for imagination. His hair is longer now, hanging past his shoulders, half of it swept up in a neat little bun. Harry can instantly see himself stroking his fingers through that white-blond hair, taking the bun apart, tugging on a strand of hair while Malfoy kisses him, moaning as-
It’s not boredom; Draco has an interesting job that he actually enjoys, working with Cupid’s Arrow. (It’s actually astonishing how normal the Department of Mysteries is. Draco always imagined everything shrouded in darkness and secrecy, but the Unspeakables act just like any other Ministry workers. Of course, everything
to date, it’s just like he told Ron: the disappointment would crush him if he goes on a date and it ends badly. Where is that infamous Gryffindor courage when he needs it? “I need to clear my head,” Harry growls to himself. “I think I’ll go out for a run.”
Harry grins. “Yeah, their food is spectacular. Ron found this place, actually, and I’ve been dying to share it with someone.”
Draco tosses his hair back. “Well, I needed to get out of the house. Join me?”
Harry smiles. Pulling the blanket over them both, he tucks Draco in close. “Go to sleep, Draco,” he murmurs, pressing a kiss to his forehead. It feels nice in a way he hasn’t felt in a long time,  and Draco drifts off, content.
A smile tugs on Harry’s lips. “What about the Muggles?” he asks, choosing to ignore it, “Aren’t you afraid of being seen?”
Harry lifted his head and gazed confusedly at Draco. “Boyfriend?”
, he really needs to stop thinking these thoughts if he wants to avoid an erection. That would only make the situation more embarrassing and awkward then it already is.
Of all the people in Wizarding England, why Harry Potter? Last time Draco checked, Potter had been dating the Weasley girl. In fact, he distinctly remembered an article in the Daily Prophet featuring their engagement.
“I had a lot on my mind!” Draco protests. “Besides, I’m telling you now, aren’t I?”
Speaking of friends, Harry introduces Draco to his a few days after their first date. Granger accepts his stiff apology with good grace, forgiving him immediately, but Weasley is a harder nut to crack. Finally, after an hour’s worth of observation, he sighs and tells Draco the only reason he forgives him is because he can tell how happy Draco makes Harry. Draco lets go of a breath he didn’t even realize he was holding. But, surprisingly, Weasley’s approval is important to him.
Draco wrinkles his nose and starts walking, Harry following him. “No one is looking. Even if they were, who would they tell? Nobody would believe them.”
Harry grins. “Yeah, but this run is part of my
“No - no, we broke up. I’m not seeing anyone,” he chokes out.
“Yeah. but nothing’s very traditional about their relationship,” jokes Harry.
“You’re just trying to butter me up,” Draco accuses. But despite his words, he leans across the table to kiss him anyway.
“Yes, I’ve heard of that. I’ve also heard rumors she plans to run for Minister next year. Is that true?”
Harry looks soft, and strangely vulnerable, his face relaxed in sleep. His mouth is open slightly, but no drool, and he snores softly. His hair looks floppy and sleep-tousled, and so, so soft. Draco reaches out a hand and strokes it, not quite believing that this is his. That this wonderful, perfect man who’s stolen Draco’s heart returns his feelings. He closes his eyes and smiles to himself. When he opens them again, Harry’s eyes watch his own.
Draco seems to shift, and bites his lip. “I work for the Department of Mysteries. I can’t say anything beyond that. I’m sure you understand.”
“Yes, romantically. You want somebody to come home to. Someone who cooks you breakfast in the mornings and has supper waiting for you on the table when you come home. A boyfriend, or a doting husband type.”
“You know, if someone had told me six years ago that I’d be attending the wedding of a Muggleborn and a Weasley, I’d have laughed and hexed their face off,” Pansy comments. She lays her head on his shoulder as they watch the other guests.
Draco shoves those thoughts out of his head. They were ridiculous anyways. No man nursing a crush on his rival would propose to his longtime girlfriend. Instead of thinking about it, Draco concentrates on getting his job done. He crosses the tiny office to where a large map of England hangs on the wall. It was enchanted to show where his current client would be, and right now, a small golden dot labeled “Harry Potter'' was shown in a Muggle park Draco visited often. Well, Draco thinks to himself, better sooner than later. And the quicker I find Potter’s soulmate, the quicker I can forget about him. Draco makes a quick pit stop at his house to change into a Muggle outfit and Apparates to the park.
Draco takes the day off, which he really should not have done, because all it does is give himself more time to stress over the date. He spends the hours leading up to it pacing the living room and changing his outfit every ten minutes.
Yes, you idiot. I’m at the bar, where are you
<><><><><>
“This really is amazing,” says Draco, savoring the taste. “I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed oysters so much.”
(Draco’s new employment had been what kept him out of Azkaban. The Wizengamot had agreed to let him walk free of all charges provided he found a stable job within a week. Privately, Draco thought they were certain he wouldn’t be able to find anyone willing to hire him, and could then chuck him in Azkaban. Unfortunately for them, the Department of Love sent him a letter of employment just a day after. It had been so satisfying to present that letter to the Wizengamot, and watch their faces crumple in disappointment.)
“At least try, Harry,” Ron says, suddenly serious.
Harry pouted, and Draco relented. “Maybe in the morning, when you’re sober.”
When Harry turns back around, Malfoy starts a little bit, and quickly snaps his gaze upward. Harry blinks and holds back a smile. Was Malfoy staring at his ass?
“Say, Draco, are you seeing anyone?” Harry tries to sound casual, but his nervous shifting gives it away.
“Do you - do you want to come in?” Draco pants, his mouth finding its way back to Harry’s.
The wine arrives and they order. “I’ll have chicken parmesan,” Harry tells the waiter. He leans toward Draco. “You should try the oysters with garlic sauce. I think you’ll really like it.”
Harry gasps, and Draco slides his tongue in immediately. Harry responds enthusiastically, his fingers tangling into Draco’s hair and pulling his bun apart. Soft, blond locks of hair tumble down Draco’s shoulders, followed by Harry’s caressing hands. In return, Draco pulls Harry’s beanie off, sliding his hands through the coarse black hair.
They share a kiss, sweet and unhurried, before Harry leaves for work, Draco promising to drop by later.
He leads Harry to the bathroom, and they take turns showering. Harry suggests showering together, but stops once he sees how small Draco’s shower is. When they finish, Draco lends Harry a shirt and a pair of sweatpants.
“You like that, don’t you,” Harry murmurs, driving into him harder and harder. Draco winds an arm around his head and pulls him down into a kiss, hot and filthy. Draco comes immediately, Harry's skillful tongue and unrelenting pace his undoing. He moans into Harry’s mouth, spurting hot ropes of come all over Harry’s chest. Harry comes not long after, shuddering in his release.
Harry lights up, dropping the casual act. “Really?” It’s adorable how much he sounds like a hopeful child. Harry seems to realize this and flushes, clearing his throat in an attempt to recover. “I mean, that’s great! I’ll owl you the details.”
, that Harry wasn’t seeing anyone. He strolls home, whistling happily, smiling wide despite the abysmal weather.
Draco hums. “I suppose you are correct.” They continue ambling along the path in a comfortable silence, broken only by the chirping birds.
Draco prods at the glowing fluid with his wand and is instantly bombarded with more of Potter’s personality traits, the below the surface ones. Recklessness, pigheadedness, loyalty, humbleness, protectiveness. His love for Quidditch and flying, his fierce devotion to his friends, his fondness towards treacle tarts. All the things make him
You have a boyfriend
Satisfied with the way he looks, Draco retreats to the living room to wait for Harry.
Draco reaches for his wand and swiftly cleans them up, come-covered bodies, lube-stained sheets, and all. “Bleh. We can shower in the morning.”
Yeah, nope. This file was definitely supposed to be there. The file had everything it was supposed to: the name of the client, the name of the Cupid, that stupid bow and arrow logo at the top right-hand corner of the paper. (Remember when Draco said he liked his job? There are a few things he
Harry is lonely. He admits it! He’s lonely, and he wants a boyfriend, but for some stupid,
Draco puts it out of his mind and tries to enjoy lunch with his mother and boyfriend.
“Of course you are. You’re an independent young man who just wants some company.” She pats his hand condescendingly as she says this. “But still, think about it. If you want, I’m sure I could find someone you’d like.”
. She has so many things to do already I’m surprised she hasn’t collapsed yet, what with that and wedding planning on top of her already stressful job.”
“What are you doing here, Harry?” (He also likes the sound of his in Draco’s mouth.)
“Relax, Mione,” Potter is saying. “Your wedding isn’t for another three months. Besides, it’ll be amazing.” Hm. That answers Draco’s question from earlier, then.
Draco met the glare thrown his way with a cool stare. “The boyfriend of the guy you’re trying to hit on.”
What if? Maybe he does need someone to love him. Someone to take care of him. Someone to take care of. Draco can see it all in his head: coming home from work and being greeted by a handsome man, who kisses him on the cheek and asks how his day was. They’d eat dinner, and maybe afterward-
Harry laughs and starts moving again. “Well, as long as you’re having fun.” He picks up the pace and starts fucking Draco in earnest. Sweat rolls down his face and onto his chest as he proceeds to spear Draco over and over. He shifts, finding an angle he likes, and continues to tear Draco apart.
They spend the next few minutes just eating. Draco can’t help the pleased sounds that escape him with every bite, but the way Harry responds, blushing deeper each time, is worth it.
“You just did, but sure,” shrugs Harry. “Ask away.”
Turns out Potter is one of those unlucky souls that found themselves suddenly unable to touch anyone. Despite this, he decided that he loved Weasley so much, he was willing to stay with her and eventually proposed to her a year later. But apparently, Weasley wasn’t as willing and broke it off barely a week after the proposal. A part of Draco that wasn’t a complete prick winces at this harsh behavior, but the small part of him that always thrilled at catching Potter’s attention throws a small party in his head. Potter only has one other relationship listed, a Muggle man, but that had ended just over a year ago. Which means Potter is now single. Draco’s mind wanders, fantasizing about Harry Potter, as it’s wont to do. Maybe their schoolboy rivalry had been a front for their burning passion for each other. It certainly had been on Draco’s side. Maybe it was the same for Potter.
Harry yanks his pajama top off and pulls on a random t-shirt he grabs from his wardrobe and frowns. The shirt is a bit too small, but Harry can’t be bothered to change. Yanking on his joggers, Harry crosses to the door and breaks into a light jog, heading towards the nearest Muggle park.
Draco nods again. “Tomorrow, Potter.” Draco ducks out of the cafe with a smile on his face and sips his coffee. It tastes like happiness, which Draco didn’t even know had a taste. Nevertheless, Draco thinks of Potter the entire day, and even though all he does is paperwork, he can’t help but smile the whole time.
absolutely sober.” Draco looked down at Harry, who had started making little puffing sounds, like he was falling asleep, then back up at the man. “You better be glad I have to take him home; otherwise I'd hex you into oblivion for touching him." Not bothering to wait for a response, Draco takes Harry and Apparates away.

One glance at Pansy’s face and Draco knows she doesn’t believe him. But she doesn’t say anything. “If you say so, darling. Anyways, did Millie tell you she’s moving back to back to England?”
Harry laughs. “Yeah, I just might!” He spots a shock of white-blond hair in the distance, but it disappears before he can get a close look. Hermione’s right - he really will give himself a headache if he doesn’t stop seeing things.  “How have the wedding preparations been going?” asks Harry, determined to put Malfoy out of his mind.
“Yes, Harry. Three months is plenty of time to meet someone,” Hermione tells him gently.
Harry is the first to speak. “What about you? Where do you work?”
“Merlin, you’re huge,” Draco pants. Harry stops as he bottoms out.
He smirks in an attempt to lighten the mood. “So sentimental, Harry,” he teases. “I hope you don’t expect me to pour out my epic tale of pining.”
There’s only one thing to do now. Normally, Draco would have to go find the soulmate, gather their signature, and cast another volley of spells, but since the soulmate is him, that cuts his work down considerably. Draco murmurs the spell and pulls out a second Pensieve, directing his silvery signature into the basin. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco acknowledges the irony of his and Potter’s signatures forming the Slytherin colors.
Draco lifts a brow, acting nonchalant, but inside, he can’t stop himself from squealing. “Maybe. Depends on what you mean.”
Harry bites his lip. “ Do you want to go out for dinner sometime? With me?”
Harry knows her well enough to know the question is for another purpose. What she really wants to know if Harry’s going to bring anyone, full stop. He scratches his head. “I don’t know, Mione. Who would I bring?” For a second, Harry remembers the pale blond head he saw earlier and thinks about Malfoy. But it’s a ridiculous thought. What would he even say? “Hey, I know we hate each other, except it turns out I don’t, I’ve actually had a subconscious crush on you since sixth year, wanna be my date to my best friends’ wedding (who you also hate)?” Harry snorts internally. Yeah, it is ridiculous. “I guess I can always ask someone to go with as friends.”
“It sounds like you’re lonely,” Pansy remarks after he tells her during his lunch break.
Draco sees? Because while Potter’s hair still looks like he just rolled out of bed, it now gives off a sexy, I-just-got-shagged-and-Merlin-it-was-great vibe.
Merlin. This has to be too good to be true. If Draco isn’t, in fact, just dreaming, then this means he actually has a chance with Potter. More than just a chance, considering they were practically made for each other.
“Morning?”
Draco has so many questions right now.
Harry wears a dark green shirt, skinny jeans, and a beanie, pulled over his head so that only the floppy part of his hair is showing. He somehow manages to look absolutely adorable and breathtakingly gorgeous at the same time. They just stand there, staring at each other for a minute.
“You’ll find someone, Harry. It’ll just take some time,” Ron had reassured him.
, like he knows Harry isn’t doing anything about it. Luckily for Harry, Ron’s so caught up in wedding planning, he never has time to have another heart to heart.
Draco smirked, rolling his eyes. “Harry, love, we’ve been dating for three years now.”
Harry arrives eight o’clock on the dot, and Draco opens the door, slightly breathless with anticipation. He isn’t disappointed
Potter visibly starts before stuttering out a reply. “Oh - uh - good morning, Malfoy.” His eyes are wider than saucers and he clearly doesn't expect Draco to be there.  “Um, what would you like to order?” he asks after a minute.
afterward, only coming out for meals, and some days not even that. She was withdrawn even after Father returned from Azkaban, though she did get better.
“Three years? Boyfriend? The fuck, mate? You let me kiss you when you already had a boyfriend?” The blonde looked panicked, but Draco couldn’t be sympathetic. The guy
“I expected you to be more of a beer guy,” Draco remarks.
While Severus was just a kid, he already knew a lot about the topics he was interested in and had a very active imagination to theorize about the things he didn’t.
First, he came in pretending to be sick and told every other nurse at the Mungo he was fine, waiting for Fayre to come to him.
“I’m… Harry,” Harry deliberately omitted his last name, trying not to stare at the witch. Now that she said who she was, he could see some likeness to a certain Professor.
Draco fell asleep somehow, only to wake up in Potter’s arms in the narrow bed that wasn’t meant for two.
“Knowing how to use electricity, for instance, isn't that bad,” Potter argued, and Draco let it slide. Why would he use anything other than magic, when it gave you all the tools you needed for life? “Plus, we could fake the papers. It’s not about the curriculum anyway, it’s about spending time with not just adults. Us and the elves to be exact.”
Damn, Fayre was a good Healer. She knew solutions to curses, Harry and Hermione, searching over 3 libraries, couldn’t find. Maybe this was what it was like to be a Pure-Blood, hearing of magic since a younger age, and knowing stuff the Muggle-Borns never heard of?
He cared about Severus too much to pursue a relationship with Potter, yet when Harry was hurting, it was also just as upsetting to him as if Severus was.
Harry tried to speak to both the first year himself and Draco, hell, even Ron, but he was completely ignored.
“You have no degree in either field!” Harry exclaimed because although he respected Fayre, and her knowledge, when it came to Ron, his mind was so panicked, he just told her the exact opposite without a thought.
“If you tell us Tobias changed since he has Edwin’s magic than we’ll adopt him without it,” he stated, making Draco now stare at him. “And if not, we shouldn’t only rescue Severus and Edwin. We should also help rescue you.”
It felt like everything he wanted to achieve was crumbled because he only arrived in 1964, not 1960.
And who would have thought that Saint Potter would want someone like Draco willingly, almost eager to try it out?
