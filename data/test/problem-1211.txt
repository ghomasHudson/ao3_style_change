He wanted to say more, to speak his mind but it was clear she was busy and would not hear him. Had he not been clear? There was a threat, and McGonagall was aware that there was... how come she wasn't asking for help?
Draco sighed and shrugged "He just knows something about me that I would very much like him not to know"
Harry chuckled, shushing that annoying voice that told him he wasn't good enough to maintain this level of happiness in his life. "Of course you would want a bigger bed. Silk sheets too?"
Draco didn't know what he was feeling, but he tried to remain calm. Harry was in his living room, and he could only hope he wasn't there with his father. Nothing good could come up from that.
"It's just marriage, Draco" She gave him a look that allowed no room for objections. Her eyes went from him to Potter but eventually, she shrugged. "An arrangement"
That clearly struck a nerve, and Draco got up almost immediately. He was quickly pulling at the curtains and opening them, he was leaving. Harry had fucked up, but he was still hurt and angry and confused and kind of wanted Draco to hurt him.
"I'll give you something to eat, the night is lovely... I'm sure you'll find a nice place to eat darlings"
Harry couldn't get that phrase out of his mind. His friends hadn't seen him in the room -thanks to his cloak- and he knew he should've said something and let them know he was listening in their conversation but... he couldn't. Not when he realized they were talking about them. How would his friends take the idea of him
"She came across this room back when we were prefects. Stole the key and kind of... Fixed the interior" he sighed "So if there's anything pink in here, it's hers"
"Of course, you should be in class" The auror moved away from the door and watched as they poured out of the room. Damn. They would have to go to class -or roam the hallways for a while- before getting another chance to get to the bathroom.
Harry couldn't believe it. Draco asking for help was weird but asking someone to talk about his feelings was...
Harry opened his eyes and, gathering all of his strength, looked down at the other boy. The image alone almost threw him over the edge, but he dug his fingers harder against the sheets trying not to be 'too quick'. Draco had his eyes closed but he seemed to be enjoying it almost as much as he was.
"For a moment I thought we weren't getting out, Potter" He admitted when the rows of books were behind them.
"I couldn't sleep" Draco tried not to look surprised... Or interested. So he simply nodded with a small
"Great honor, yeah, yeah, I know. I'll think about it" He wasn't going to think about it. Or maybe he was, but it didn't need to be a public matter "I'm here to... I wish to visit one of your, uh, prisoners?"
Who could blame him? They had gone through enough as it was. A little voice inside Harry's head told him he didn't want to be involved in something dangerous either, but he shushed it.
The room they were in was common, nothing fancy, but suddenly it seemed more than perfect. They could have offered Draco a palace with silk sheets and he would have rejected it, just to stay one more minute with Harry in there.
"Hey, can we talk?" He whispered, pulling at one of Draco's arms while catching him in a hallway. Harry had waited until Draco left the Great Hall to follow him, because surely that was what the boy wanted. Being seen together in front of everyone was more attention than... any of them wanted. Or maybe not. Harry wasn't really sure of what he wanted.
"What are you working on?" Harry tried peeking over Draco's shoulder, the Slytherin was working hard on a piece of parchment. His handwriting was perfect and he had made drawings of old runes, they were a perfect copy of the ones in the book. "Runes?"
Draco's arms hugged his waist so he rested his hands behind his neck, unable to move away from him. He wanted to do this out in the open, but he didn't want Draco to lose his family. Even if his family was horrible.
Shit. Harry wasn't sure what to do or to say or how to act in those types of scenarios. No one had taught him.
Harry's heart started beating way too fast, and he opened his curtains startling the three boys in front of him. It was a little bit surprising the fact that Neville came back for another year. Well, it wasn't like he had parents waiting with hot cocoa back home, was it?
"Yeah" He cleared his throat trying to look relaxed "Yes. I am. How are you all? I know I've been... off."
“Something like that, yes. You would be regulating the... flow of magic from the room into his body” Draco frowned “It would be foolish to try and take the magic from the whole school” He said louder, hoping Bell heard him.
Something passed through Harry's face, and he couldn't quite read what it was, but it almost felt like betrayal. Was he angry? Of course he was, who wouldn't be? But Draco couldn't just... play along as if he didn't know their relationship was doomed. He had to be the one in control, or how would he end up?
"Missed you too. Uhm, all of you" Harry looked away, scanning the room. He could see Draco on the other side, eating quietly. His manners were impeccable and Harry felt a bit self conscious of his own etiquette. He pictured himself trying to eat in the same table as Draco and Narcissa and had to stop himself from laughing.
Harry nodded, not sure about it "Yeah, one day" He could see Draco was staring as if he wanted to say something, his brow slightly furrowed. "What?"
Harry felt a rush of adrenaline coursing through his veins and he really tried not to feel good about it, but he couldn't. Alright. Seventh floor it was.
She made a face, shifting uncomfortably in her seat. She had every reason to despise Malfoy, but Harry was almost sure she didn't. "Fine. But he has a better chance with us, obviously"
His father arched an eyebrow "Narcissa told me she wants him to dine with us. I hope you know that's a terrible idea"
That was a brilliant idea, he would have time to prepare something special and he could tell Draco about it earlier to not look like a horrible boyfriend.
Finding Hermione wasn't always easy, sometimes she would hide herself up in the library -and it was a
Draco wanted to say so many things, but before he could open his mouth, the office's door opened and the Headmistress strode in, a frown on her face. He imagined it couldn't be easy to be polite to a bunch of Death Eaters, even if he felt like she thought a bit better of him.
The words caught her by surprise, so much so she could barely hide it. Hermione stared at him, wide eyed. "What?"
With a sigh, he opened one of his books trying to focus on the black letters without going back to how he kissed his cheek. No, Draco couldn't think about that closeness or he would go mad.
Harry turned around quickly. Malfoy was right there at the stairs, giving him an expression he had never seen before. The boy quickly closed the gigantic distance between them and placed a hand on his shoulder. Harry jumped at the touch by instinct, and Malfoy moved his hand away.
The "head" of the skrewt turned around trying to follow the sound -did it have ears? Harry didn't want to know- and its razor like legs moved quickly over the wooden floor. It was definitely trying to kill them.
"Connections? Perhaps. Some people respect us, but they are very few. And I would be inclined to believe those people are afraid of us. Once they realize there is nothing to fear... they will be of no use"
“Fine by me” Draco seized the bottle and slumped down on the floor, smiling "How did you even get the fire whiskey?" He poured some into a cup Noah had just given him and then gave the bottle back to Elliot.
Draco left the bathroom with an uneasy feeling all over his body. It was probably from Myrtle's crying. It had to be that. He convinced himself nothing else was wrong.
Draco's eyes widened so much Harry almost worried. Was that too much, too soon? Was he overstepping? Merlin, Draco probably didn't even want to live with him. After all, he was a mess. The nightmares were still there, and the panic attacks, and the subtle yet persistent desire to disappear. They were all there inside his head. But he... He wanted to get better. And he didn't mind Draco's nightmares, or his baggage. Perhaps Draco didn't mind his?
He tried to be composed for Harry, but he was a nervous wreck on the inside. They had been living together for a year and five months or so, things settling down around them bit by bit. Grimmauld Place had come beautifully together, almost none of its dark past remained. The rooms were all repainted, with new furniture to ensure an aura of comfort. There was no point in living in a place that made them feel unwelcomed.
The room's door opened again and everyone turned, finding the younger Weasley with a small smile on her face. Harry smiled back, trying not to feel the look Draco was most certainly giving him. He had invited Ginny, because he trusted her and wanted her to know he considered her valuable. Of course he didn't want her to get hurt and he wouldn't put her in any harm, but there was no harm in sharing information, right?
Elliot knew they only had a few moments to get something out of her before she put some excuse and decided to leave.
"I know. And... I don't think anything of our kiss" Harry wasn't sure she was being honest, he could see her hurting. But what could he do? He could like and kiss her, but that would be horrible of him. She deserved better. "So, don't feel like you owe me anything, alright?"
"No, those feel weird" Harry couldn't quite see his face but he knew Draco was scrunching his nose. "I do want a fireplace in our room"
Since no one came to say hello, he left his bag over one of the sofas and started looking for his parents. He didn't want to see them, but he was going to be living with them for a whole year. Draco knew he wouldn't be able to avoid them forever, so it was best to get it over with. Ever since they found out, Draco's nights had been plagued with anxiety. He had worried about what they would say when they were alone, what they would want him to do. He had run almost every scenario in his mind, pictured every single insult they could throw at him. What would he do if he was disowned immediately? What would the ministry do? Would they leave him in the same house or would they make him go live somewhere else? He didn't want to think about it, but some days it was the only thing on his mind.
"You would be justified if you did" He answered, his eyes finally meeting hers "I have been horrible to you. With no reason"
Harry still had trouble picking things for himself, most of the time delegating those responsibilities to Draco which, in turn, caused some friction between them. Nothing that a cup of tea and a long night in front of the fireplace couldn't fix.
"I can't do that, Potter. You see, I still need you two. How come the Dark lord couldn't kill you? It seems pretty easy"
“Nothing” Draco tilted his head very lightly and gave him a soft kiss “Alright, why are they so late? Did you do the spell correctly?”
Ron rolled his eyes, amusing him. Was he jealous? Draco almost wanted to place an arm around Harry's shoulders
It was odd finding another boy attractive, and a small part of himself wondered if it was because maybe Draco's features were a bit more feminine. No, it really wasn't that. He could see Draco was a boy, from his jaw line to his shoulders and his chest and...
Noah nodded, thoughtful. “Coming out is never easy, but it wasn't so bad, right? I mean... I'm totally fine with it, Elliot doesn't care and Ginny seemed cool”
"Let me show you" Draco finally spoke, closing the distance between their bodies and pressing their lips together. It was something Harry wasn't expecting, but it was extremely well received. He needed that. He had needed to touch his lips since that morning and now it was finally happening again. Of course his mind stopped working with the first touches, only focused on kissing him. Draco had an arm resting behind his neck and the other between their bodies... Harry kissed him. And kissed him. And kissed him. And kissed him even more.
Harry looked over to Noah and Elliot, both of them with curiosity in their eyes "A couple nights ago, Malfoy and I... we were talking and we... We eavesdropped on a conversation"
"Then I'll shut you up myself" His words died over Draco's lips, and then they were kissing and Draco couldn't quite remember why he had been so distraught moments before. How could something so good end? He wanted to press himself against Harry so much so they would become one person. He had wanted to feel that ever since they had had sex. But they couldn't do it, not in there and not with him in house arrest.
Narcissa made a sound with her tongue and slightly turned to him "There's still the matter of the heir to discuss"
They entered the Infirmary without a worry, really, since Pomfrey and McGonagall were deep in conversation behind closed doors. It was risky to uncover themselves while they were still in there, but Harry trusted it would take them a while to sort things out.
What would he say? There was nothing to say. Nothing bad, at least. He still felt as if someone had grabbed his chest and squeezed incredibly hard, but it was getting better. And their “friends” hadn't said a word to anyone either. Actually they hadn't said anything to them either. Maybe that's how it would be, people knowing they were together but avoiding the subject all together. Draco tried not to think much about it, or it would give him another head ache. He had already spent the previous night tossing and turning in his bed, trying to shake off the feeling of shame.
“Like a what, a coffee filter?” Harry frowned, his eyes moving to the floor where the immense chalk drawing was displayed.
Harry decided to sit far, far away from Malfoy, almost six meters away. He heard a snort from the shadows but decided not to give in and he said nothing.
"We are not... We are not a good family" He frowned, finding strength from somewhere deep within. The memories of Harry kissing him and telling him how good he was fueling his confidence. "Father, you are a murderer and a torturer. I know this, and you know this"
"I think every single move I make ahead of time" Malfoy crossed his legs under his body "I fancy Pansy" He smirked at his own rhyme "Being here is not so bad"
"I've heard you are a good teacher" Draco didn't want to go back and say goodbye, because he knew he had to. He had classes to attend to, homework to finish and... a common room to visit. He couldn't just keep following Harry around or hiding himself at Gryffindor's Tower. Merlin, if Salazar Slytherin could see him fraternizing with
There was no point in having that conversation. No point at all. Without saying another word, Draco walked out of the kitchen. The hallways were dark but he knew how to find his way back.
"Yeah, yeah, stop being so sorry" Draco finally moved away, giving in and sitting next to him. A shiver ran through him and he moved closer to his side. "I'm not mad"
Draco shrugged, wanting to sit down but unable to do so. "You have things to do, and a life to live. I'm stuck in here, what's the point of dragging your down as well?"
"Come on, Potter, we don't have all day" He said, a bit loudly so people would hear as they walked towards Elliot's room.
"Harry... " Draco was still there, he hadn't left and he was speaking in the same soothing voice he knew so well. Why? Why not leave him? Harry moved backwards until he hit the wall and that was enough for his knees to give up. He allowed himself to sit on the floor, knees immediately going up to his chest. In the worst moments of his life, deep down, he wished to be under the stairs again. It had been a horrible place to live, but it was small and
Harry decided to be bold, so he moved a bit closer and pulled Draco in for a hug. "No matter what happens, you won't be alone"
After switching the tea cups from one cupboard to another, he chewed down on his lower lip, looking around the room for
Harry took off his glasses, pressing a couple fingers to the side of his head and trying not to feel too stressed about what was going on. He failed.
Another pause, Harry could see how nervous he was, how insecure. He wanted to reach out, hug him and let him know it was fine. Questioning everything is just a part of life... Harry tried to imagine young Draco trying to go against Lucius' ideals. Even inside his mind it didn't end well.
He sighed and looked at one of his hands. Did he also run out of good things to say? Nah, he could probably talk about all his money and friends and family and his hate for muggle borns.
"Yeah..." Harry looked at their shoes at the edge of the lake, would they ever have another morning like this one?
) so he vanished it to the bottoms of his heart, for later. For a moment in time when he felt ready.
Draco didn't know what to say. Or do. He wanted to hug her but her dress was new and he didn't want to wrinkle it.
He looked over to Draco, who seemed incredibly tense while staring at his cauldron. They hadn't even started and the Slytherin was already inside his own head. Harry wanted to reach out and say something, but he knew that that would only piss him off, or perhaps make his nervousness worse, so he kept quiet. He hoped it would go good for Draco. He really did.
Draco started kissing his neck and he pressed both his hands to his waist, pulling their bodies closer, wanting more, needing more. He allowed himself to moan, feeling safe in there with him. The sound that came from Draco in response was all the reward he needed.
It was difficult, speaking of these things. It was no secret Harry hated his father, and with good reason. Hearing him say things like that, supportive things, made him love Harry even more. Any other guy would have wanted for him to cut ties completely with his family. Harry was way too good to ask something like that of him.
There was an urge to cover the mirror, to not look at himself but he didn't give in. A lot had happened and, perhaps, if someone found him attractive -
"Why do you have a plant in here?" Draco said, arching an eyebrow. He sat across from Neville, and pulled out his books, placing them carefully over the table. It had been pure luck to find him in there.
The news had been taken quite differently by his friends. Ron seemed amused and had made a couple comments about how Grimmauld would now be a snake's den, while Hermione had been oddly quiet about it. She had told Harry, in private, how she had been a bit wary of his relationship at first, but if this was what he wanted she would support him. And Harry didn't really need anything else.
Harry moved towards him without even noticing, it was all like before and it didn't feel as wrong as he hoped it would.
"Yes" Draco's hand pulled his hair back, while they stared into each other's eyes. "Think you can open my trousers this time?"
Draco threw a couple glances to his fisted hands, and crossed his arms again. Damn. He tried to relax his hands, he would never hurt him. Draco had to know that, right?
Elliot frowned "It's probably all gone, and I've probably been around there since then. We are not going to find anything"
him the bedroom. He had taken the room that wasn't tied to any horrible memories and it was actually
Harry chuckled, what would they say if they knew Malfoy was only sleeping in a different place with him? Woah, when had he decided to spend the night there?
Ron nodded "She keeps nagging me about getting a job" He looked down at his tea. Harry knew Ron had been trying to help his mother and father around the house, he was the only one that could. Ginny was leaving to play for an important Quidditch team -she hadn't told him which one yet- and the older boys were... well, with their families. The only ones left at the Burrow were George and Ron, and he knew George wasn't coping well after the war. It wouldn't surprise him to know that Ron was trying to help his brother get back to his feet before focusing on his own future. That was the type of person Ron was. The type of friend, of brother.
Trying not to pay attention to the knot on his belly -and knowing he had already been seen- he walked towards the table, taking one of the two empty seats. His father closed the newspaper, placing it on the table, before turning towards him.
This wasn't the mother he loved, the one who had a rose garden and barely knew how to maintain it, the one who preferred duels to baking or knitting. This mother was the one who giggled at silly jokes and sweet talked politicians and businessmen. It was almost as if they hadn't learned anything, as if they were back to their old tricks and games. Draco felt his heartbeat accelerate and didn't know if it was from disliking the situation or missing the social games.
There was no doubt in Harry's mind: they had seen them hugging, foreheads touching... Anyone would see that friends don't touch each other like that. Harry didn't want Draco to have to face whatever he had to face in there alone, but at the same time some things had to be a certain way.
It took him longer than he expected, but he eventually found them, out in the garden. They had a lovely table ready with brunch. Nothing seemed touched.
"I'm sorry, Headmistress but I can't leave the school and I can't stop what we started. The students must be protected by us, unless we are given different orders"
"Thank you" He said, with the same tone he used to turn down interviews or when someone thanked him for his 'service' "I'll need time to think about this"
"20 points from Gryffindor and Slytherin" Was the first thing she said to them. And, alright, yeah, they deserved that.
Draco was really fast sometimes. Sometimes he moved and Harry had no idea what had happened until after it had happened. Or maybe Harry was slow. But in a blink of an eye, Draco had moved and kissed his cheek very softly and very briefly.
The silence that followed was telling. Draco didn't mean to keep quiet, but he found himself unable to lie. It had been much easier to pretend that everything was alright before his parents knew about this small detail about himself. What was the point of pretending anymore? It's not like he had that many secrets. Draco could still feel his father's gaze when he reached for the teapot.
When Draco saw him stare, he winked. There was something odd about that, and Harry mouthed a simple:
Harry kicked the wall once, twice, three times without even stopping to breathe, each time harder and with more intention. His foot hurt, and maybe it was broken or maybe he had just broken a toenail. Why should he care? He had had a broken bone before Hogwarts and the Dursleys took two days before sending him to the Hospital... He could live with a stupid broken toe.
count- and even though he wasn't going to just get naked to get changed, he appreciated Draco giving him some room.
And some enormous choices were the simplest ones. Harry pulled both of them inside the room, and caught Draco throwing some glances around. No doubt this wasn't what he was used too, but he didn't quite seem to mind. Instead, the slytherin started kissing his neck, hands pulling his shirt completely off as they stood a few feet away from the bed.
"If it makes you feel better" Harry knew he hadn't upset Draco, because he was chuckling with him. They hadn't had enormous fights anymore. Yes, some things were complicated and brought up uncomfortable discussions, but they hadn't tried to hurt each other in months. That was... Perfect, really.
"Professor, would you give us a moment?" Harry heard Draco but he didn't quite register it. He even heard McGonagall whisper a resigned 'five minutes'. In any other circumstance he would be shocked but his mind was somewhere far away.
"Care to explain?" Harry blurted out, standing up and letting the blanket they had placed on his shoulders fall to the floor. He didn't mean to be dramatic, but he didn't understand what had happened and it felt as if everyone was lying and hiding stuff.
"A little bit more to the left" Draco frowned at the sofa, while his boyfriend pushed it. They had started the renovations a couple days ago, and even though Harry was the only one that could go out and
"I wouldn't have wanted that, son" He sighed, a hand rubbing his forehead "I cannot understand this. It will bring shame to our name and end our line... But... "
She laughed "Maybe. I don't mean right now, but... when you both feel ready. Your father will be your father, and I'll be me" That wasn't reassuring, but he didn't say so. "But it... we'll try"
Draco sighed and took one of Harry's hands, pulling it towards his skin "It's not so bad. It's okay" He didn't like the anguished face Harry had now, it was almost as if he were guilty of something. He wasn't. Draco remembered how he had almost used the cruciatus curse on him that night. Yes, Harry could have killed him, but it would have been in self defense.
"It's just..." He started but trailed off, having no idea how to explain all of this to Malfoy of all people.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Yeah? If you are all going to keep asking me about Malfoy I am going to go to bed"
No one had tried to hit them or anything like that, but they had had a couple nasty fights. It wasn't easy to hear slurs directed at him -and somehow it was worse when they were aimed at Draco-, but they had found that not everyone was against them or their relationship. And the papers had no clue,
The coldness that had run through his veins at the thought of taking off his shirt was replaced by his kisses, one by one it filled him with warmth. Harry pressed his forehead to his chest, his hair tickling him a bit.
Bell sighed and kneeled behind one couch, pulling at one of the loose floorboards where he had stashed some of the most delicate elements he needed.
It would have been really easy to move forward, to just tilt his head and kiss him. Harry didn't want to dwell on why he was having those ideas, but he knew what he wanted to do. Hell, maybe he should just be a Gryffindor about it and forget about everything else. He was having an internal argument about it when Draco slowly moved away, breaking all contact. He wasn't even holding his hand anymore.
"Your tried to cheat!" he said, his chest rising and falling fast. They were both drenched from head to toes, and Harry imagined he was incredibly cold, even if his cheeks were still pink from all the running.
He quickly picked up all of his things the minute the class finished but stayed behind to watch Draco return his wand. Without it, he probably had to do everything like a muggle and that could not sit well with the blonde. It gave Harry a twisted satisfaction... He felt guilty right away.
He moved closer to the other boy, spooning him when Draco turned his back to him. "Hi there" Harry whispered, hearing a small chuckle. "Thank you for... Letting me be the one who... You know"
"Yeah, I'm fine. Noah is... He's wrecked. He was so bad last night. Said things that made no sense..."
What was better? To have people whispering about what a fag he was or have people whispering about what a cruel, evil Death Eater he was? Apparently he had chosen the latter, but he didn't feel any better about it. Ever since the Battle of Hogwarts, he had wanted to distance himself from all that cruelty. He wanted to be a new man, he wanted to be good. For Merlin's beard he wanted to make the right choices, but he kept fucking up!
They moved in silence amongst the guests, Draco's light touch never leaving Harry's arm. It wasn't to guide him, but to find some solace amongst that sea of people. He could tell Harry wanted to talk to him, from the way he kept throwing glances or looking around the room, but Draco didn't feel like it. The whole night was too much and he only wanted it to stop.
"Well let's change that. I have been in your common room, so... let's make it even" Harry got up and covered his body with the cloak, waiting for Draco.
What did that have to do with anything? Harry tried to focus on the conversation and not in the strong urge to disappear to the bathroom for a little while.
This time the light wasn't turned off and they were over the covers, but Harry didn't know if it would stay that way. Truth be told, he had a lot of questions about it, he was acting solely on impulse and instinct.
. Perhaps he would have liked that, before. Before Harry, and his stupid green eyes, and his messy hair, and his soft moans, and the way he got really cuddly after fooling around.
Harry noticed his mind drifting back to unpleasant memories, so he focused on the task at hand. There were lists of pure-blooded families dating back centuries, he recognized some and never heard of others. Most of them probably died out while he was still a baby, hell, while his parents were babies.
"Yeah, I didn't mean to be... Ugh. I'm sorry" Elliot wasn't looking at Draco when he said it, but at Harry.
"Are you okay?" he whispered, hands around Harry, feeling his back, the blankets protecting both. He nodded without moving away. "Me too"
"Quiet" Harry barely raised his wand, just in case, as they stepped closer to the room. The door wasn't completely shut which made Harry believe the reunion couldn't be all that important. Alright, maybe he was exaggerating?
Not only that, but he wasn't talking much to his parents. It was better to avoid confrontation, he already had enough of those for a lifetime. Besides, his mind kept going back to the pile of unanswered letters on his desk.
"It-..." He sighed "I don't... That's not what I was taught, I guess. I don't like being vulnerable"
Draco read while he wrote, which made him a bit nervous and his handwriting became more shaky at the end, but he knew this would be worth it.
"Shut up" Draco pulled him by the collar, kissing his lips slowly, deeply. The popping in the microwave slowly slowing down. "You offered to make more popcorn because the movie was about to make you cry, don't lie"
Because being cut off from the family meant more than just losing money, it meant losing any chance at a decent job, or a good reputation or... anything.
"Yeah" Draco moved his face towards his hand, his movement was almost scared. Harry took it as a clear invitation and moved closer, caressing his cheek without any doubts now.
Harry chuckled and opened the door with a key, taking Draco's hand and pulling him inside. There was a long hallway that ended on a closed door and a staircase to their right. Harry guided him upstairs, where a long row of doors with numbers appeared.
He was going to say that he looked beautiful, with all the paint stains on his shirt. They had gone for dark blue for the library, letting it contrast with the wood paneling.
"That's one theory" Draco was speaking as if he was bored and Harry hated it. He hated it because he sounded like his father and Harry knew he was
Of course this little change in their sleeping habits hadn't gotten in the way of their 'sexual awakening'. Harry was quite sure it only made him want to touch Draco more. They were as careful as they could, pulling each other into empty classrooms during free periods, or broom closets, or bathroom stalls... They hadn't gone all the way yet, neither wanting to have sex in a dusty room or in a bathroom where more than once they would be in an extremely uncomfortable position or hurrying not to get caught.
The auror made a small "hm" noise and let go of him, still smiling. Draco was glad it was him and not some other auror. He couldn't afford any mistakes.
"Don't you remember how he was? So happy... And one day he started... He... Lucius, we almost lost him forever" She looked up, without tears and without fear. Resolve written all over her. "I won't lose my child... And if that means I have to support
His hand started to shake and the phrase couldn't be finished. Closing his eyes, he felt Draco's hand on his leg, pressing softly and looking worriedly at him. Fuck. The silence and the company only made him feel like crying again. He
"You need to leave" A girl with her hair on a ponytail said, her hand was hidden away inside her left pocket and Draco suspected she was clutching her wand for dear life.
Apparently, housing a Ministry's prisoner wasn't as simple as he thought. The aurors had checked the whole house, taking everything magical with them. Cauldrons, wands, even some old artifacts Harry had no idea what they were for. He had had to fill out a form that said he
So Harry lowered his wand, and at that Draco reacted. "Don't-"  He tried, but Bell pulled tightly at his blond hair making him shut up.
his hand. Harry had to swallow and look at him to know this was okay. By all means, it seemed to be okay. Draco was relaxed, almost about to break a small smile, and his hand was
He turned once he left the great hall and found himself face to face with Neville. Harry wanted to cry from frustration.
and make more" He groaned, following Harry into the kitchen as he picked up a bag of popcorn and placed it inside the microwave. With magic, it would have been a simple flick of the wrist and they wouldn't have had to abandon the cozy spot on the couch. Draco couldn't wait to get his wand again. The days had become shorter with Harry around, always finding something to do. The house was nowhere near done, but they had painted most of the walls and bought enough furniture to have a nice view inside every room.
Harry groaned, pressing his face to the space in between his neck and shoulder. Zippers were fine, but buttons and belt buckles? They were impossible to undo with one hand!
Instead, there was a disheveled girl on one of the beds. Her eyes were red and puffy from crying, and her hair was loose. She was wearing a hospital gown, and Harry didn't want to know why. Usually students got to keep their clothes inside the infirmary, unless they were really ill or if they clothes got burnt off -it had happened once or twice before.
Malfoy pursed his lips and crossed his arms over his chest. Merlin. Did Draco truly think that was a bad thing? It was a great thing.
Even if that was true -and he knew it was- the other slytherins seemed to be more scared or respectful around Draco. Surely that was something that the blonde boy wanted or even hoped for. Well, Harry wanted to be mad at him for enjoying that kind of attention but how could he? If something good was to come out of a kid being hospitalized then... sure.
Lucius seemed paler than usual, but extremely focused as well. That was never a good sign. He played with one of his rings, and Draco could tell it was the family' signet ring. He didn't wear his own anymore, not since he took the mark.
"And what you did is not unforgivable, Draco" He whispered trying not to draw any unwanted attention to their table.
Draco groaned at his own thoughts, wishing the shame to go away, to leave him alone. It didn't seem to want to leave. Would it ever?
Myrtle sat next to him, her body not really touching the stone floor or the wall. She was there and she was not there. Always in an in between. Draco had wondered many nights if he would die inside the castle and roam the hallways forever. He had nightmares about it.
"Malfoy?" He asked, his voice but a whisper. The other boy heard him but didn't look at him. "Did you know him?"
Draco looked at him and briefly nodded, looking around as if to check if anyone was around, before making a small gesture to another hallway. Harry followed him, not very sure as to where they were going but not really caring that much. His stomach was turning from anxiety and his heart tried to pound his way out of his chest. Fucking hell.
Harry felt completely spent by the time Draco was done, and he could feel every single one of his muscles. His body gave up, laying on top of Draco, trying to get his heart and breathing controlled again. They were both sticky with sweat and extremely warm, but it was the greatest feeling of them all, somehow.
"I had class, you know? Some of us like to attend?" He smiled, slowly ignoring the people walking in and out of the Great Hall.
"No. We... We have to study and..." Harry cleared his throat, a bit more composed by the subtle change of topic "And we have to follow our plan, remember?"
Not right now, of course. He felt shocked with electricity, moving like a storm through his own living room. Hermione had visited that morning, drank some tea and smiled at his futile attempts. "You don't need to worry, Harry" she had said with that motherly tone he wondered how she got.
They walked though some trees and Harry was about to ask where the hell were they headed when he saw it.
"Fine" Harry wasn't fine with it "but you know you can trust me, right? I know it's odd but... I won't tell"
"You are so going to have a headache tomorrow" Ginny said, taking the cup off his hand and placing it away from him. He almost wanted to protest but he could feel the alcohol inside his body already.
That was impossible, for several reasons. For someone to see him, they had to request it and he had to accept and he had rejected Harry's. Yeah, it hadn't been his bravest moment, but bringing Potter to his house where his parents were living was... a bad call. And he was sure Harry could understand that.
"Draco, the press hasn't said anything yet. We are sitting on a ticking bomb, you should be able to be honest with us"
"I didn't. I... Almost... Lost... My footing..." he said, breathing in between his words, hands going to his knees as he leaned forward just a bit.
People stared an unfair amount, but that had been the bulk of it. He wondered if they were scared of facing Harry Potter, who was undoubtedly a powerful wizard.
There was silence, everyone reading and passing papers when Harry noticed something strange in the report.
It had been a while since he had sneaked inside Slytherin and... it was shocking to see the small amount of students in there. Many had died, others had been sent to who knows where and... the House didn't have much popularity at the moment. Surely new students had begged the Sorting Hat like he did years ago.
"You know what I can do. It's more fun to hurt someone when you know their names, don't you think so?"
They had been ushered to the Headmistress' office, unable to see the end of the fight. Harry was still dizzy, trying not to feel as if his mind had gone through a blender.
"I panicked" Draco admitted, sitting on the sofa next to Harry. They were as close as they could be, holding hands over one of Draco's legs. The raw emotions had passed and both of them felt calmer, trying to make sense of it all.
"You are going to get sick" Draco whispered, sitting next to him. The boy-who-lived, Hero of the People, Golden Boy, and all of that was a little ball on the floor, his glasses falling from his nose. They weren't friends, but if they had been Draco would have laughed and maybe run a hand through his perfect mess of hair.
Even if Draco wasn't like them, the idea of seeing the mark on his arm was something he... wasn't ready for.
would mean he'd have to explain his feelings. Instead he simply told Harry they could have a fun morning. Yeah, sure. A morning were he would feel at the edge of a precipice.
She looked at them with a completely bored expression, clearly not interested. It was weird to find her alone, too, so this must have been their lucky day.
The nights were the worst part of their new routine. Draco had told him they couldn't keep sleeping with each other or people would start to suspect. Harry knew it wasn't exactly
Hermione didn't seem upset about it, yeah, probably because she was going to be safe inside the girl's room while he was going to be right next to Malfoy. Merlin. Was Harry going to
"Nothing" Draco pinched a grape between his fingers and brought it to his lips. He saw Harry's eyes follow his movements.
"I fucking hate you sometimes, you know?" Draco gave him an ugly look, pulling the cloak off his body and moving away from Harry. He was having none of it.
There was a brief smile on her face, that didn't quite reach her eyes and she nodded. There was almost no doubt in Draco's mind that he wouldn't be seeing her again. At least not like the friends they were, or could have been. Perhaps they would pass by Diagon Alley and she would nod courtly, a hand on her pure blood husband and a stern expression. A good pure blood witch wouldn't associate herself with someone like him.
Draco had touched his knee before leaving, a strong squeeze that they both knew what it meant: 'meet me later'
"You and Ron should go find out what happened, talk to the victim if you can and Myrtle" Hermione said, almost giving the orders.
"I should have done more to protect you during your formative years, Potter. I am truly sorry" She placed a hand on his shoulder "And I understand that... It is difficult for everyone to relax after a war. I should have known you were involved in solving this... But I'm afraid it was already solved, and you just endangered yourself. Both of you did" Draco seemed to slump next to him, his brow furrowed. Was he thinking about the ministry or about his sentence? Harry wouldn't allow him to be expelled, even if he had to be expelled himself.
The other students were growing impatient, angry and clearly upset. Draco didn't hate them. Actually he was sure they had good reason to hate him, and that only made him more angry at himself. Oh, Merlin, would he see himself if he saw a boggart?
The weekend arrived sooner than anyone expected, it was almost as if in the rush of the exams the week had flown by and they had all lost a few good days of sleep. Hermione was extremely calm, more than he had ever seen her in years during those periods. He felt the same. How could he be stressed about something as mundane as a grade on a piece of paper? He had seen people die. If everyone was alive by the end of the week, it was a victory.
Draco only nodded,  not quite sure what he should or shouldn't say. For some strange reason, though, he felt like he could trust Bell.
Harry didn't move, but something ran through his chest when he felt a kiss on the top of his head. "I didn't know you were like this"
The part that scared him the most was not wanting to pull Harry away from his friends and family, he wanted him to have all that. But he was sure they wouldn't accept him. How could they? After everything that had happened.
Harry didn't answer. Was something going on with Malfoy? They had been... talking and spending nights in the same room but that was it. Maybe thinking they were friends was too much, acquaintances was a better term for it but it felt way too cold. 'Getting to know one another' sounded better, but way more serious.
It was odd, but it felt right to see Draco there. Harry wondered why he hadn't closed the curtains, but he didn't mind. The slytherin had his back to them, laying under the blankets and most people would have thought he was sleeping. Not Harry, he knew him to well.
"Fuck that, Draco. You don't believe that" Harry took another step towards him "I know I fucked up. You are not your Father, and you were right... I don't know your reasons, I am not in your head. But I want to understand, to know you"
"There are some things I have been thinking about... and others I have noticed" Harry decided it was better not to explain further, it's not that he didn't trust her but she was still a headmistress and he really didn't want to do detention for this. "I know it's not my place, professor, but is everything okay?"
I hope you like it, it's shorter than I hoped it would be because I didn't want to keep you all waiting. I'm planning on one more chapter (perhaps it will be longer to compensate hehe) and the epilogue.
"The Room of Requirement is not working correctly. I think it was trying to help us, maybe guide us but it... malfunctioned"
Bell laughed at his words, something in his demeanor reminded him more of Bellatrix than Voldemort. He was enjoying this: the torture, inflicting pain on others and watching them squirm.
Harry felt his heart beat loudly inside his chest, pounding at his ribs as if trying to get out while his throat became tighter and tighter. He felt dizzy and had to close his eyes for a moment, the hand holding his wand shaking softly.
He had expected Noah to be asleep, or worse but the boy was sitting with a tired expression. His hair was a mess and he looked pale, as if someone had given him a huge scare.
It was different too. When they got mad at his grades or his manners he could work and change, improve. But he couldn't change this.
"I wouldn't dare" Draco got up, using their joined hands to pull the other boy up. Without really thinking, almost as if he had done this a million times, he put a hand on Harry's back to keep him in place. Harry was a bit overwhelmed by the closeness and his hand and... everything.
"I'm just tired, Harry" Draco moved to his other side to face him "Today was... well, the morning was nice"
Harry placed his books and quill next to Draco's organized pile. It was incredible how neat he was, everything had a perfect order, a place. It was a bit nerve wracking, really. Harry knew he was organized as well, living with the Dursley's had given him a weird discipline, he hated it sometimes.
"He did nothing" Elliot said, maintaining eye contact with him. Draco had to commend him on that, not everyone stood up to the hero of the Wizarding world these days.
The future. It was strange how he had never thought much about the future. He had, once. The memory was too painful (
"Maybe she doesn't know how to talk to you about it" Draco seemed unconvinced by that. Harry knew Narcissa loved his child enough to lie to Voldemort, so this should be... a walk in the park. Right? Oh, Harry hoped so.
"Want me to name them?" Draco lowered his voice but didn't walk away, one arm reaching, touching Harry's shoulder for a brief moment and then falling again at his side "Alright. We'll never leave my mark behind, or Sirius' death, or your friend's torture at the hands of my aunt. Or-"
"You aren't ruining anything..." Harry decided that this wouldn't be fixed with words, so he simply pulled the blond in for a hug. The boy quickly hugged his waist, hiding his face against his shoulder, slumping a bit. It was good to be like this, and even better to realize they weren't exactly worried about someone coming up the stairs and finding them like that. It was liberating, somehow.
He ran his thumb over the back of Draco's hand for a moment or two, before helping him unwrap everything and place the food on some little paper plates. It wasn't fancy but Draco didn't comment.
Draco gazed down at his glass and tried to have a couple sips of water, his throat was dry but now it felt closed. Slightly afraid, perhaps.
"We'll try then...? Being boyfriends?" their lips were brushing with each word now, and it made the electricity in his chest fly to different parts of his body.
"Things could be better" She sat next to him on his bed, looking at the other beds to make sure they were alone "I wish to discuss our engagement"
This was the first time in months that he woke feeling calm and not tired. It was refreshing, really. So he placed a hand on Draco's back, rubbing it softly and keeping him in place.
Potter would know where his loyalties were. He wasn't exactly sure that was a good thing, but it was the only way to do the
"We couldn't talk to Elliot before his parents took him home, but Pomfrey said he had no memories of the attack"
"Great" Harry took his own wand, and gave him a look. What if the wand had been used? Would that make things worse between them? Would Draco not believe Harry trusted him? Would they spend nights together again?
"I wouldn't be allowed to think this, Father. Or did you forget how it was with him in our home?" Draco would never forget "We might not like muggles, Father, but... All that pain, and death and for what?" his father did not respond.
"Yes..." Harry looked over to where the auror had gone but decided Ron was right. They should go speak with the girl, and then with Myrtle and be done with it.
Him being distant made it easier. Easier to fight, easier to hurt him so he would feel as hurt as Harry was.
He covered himself with the sheets and pulled the blankets over both of them, knowing Draco would wake up freezing without them.
Truth was the future had never been set in stone, nothing was. It was liberating to discover. A lot of things had been liberating after getting marked and living through pure hell. What could be worse than hearing women scream in your living room? What was worse than having blood on your hands?
he wished for the most. At first, he hadn't expected to end up with him, obviously. He hadn't even expected to be alive after the war, or Harry to be alive. But they were. And somehow the universe had conspired for them to find each other.
Harry moved his head to the side, finding Draco's shape away from both of them. Bell was too distracted to pay attention to them, and Draco seemed to know it because he was talking to Bea. He could see his tone was desperate and his gaze intense. She was giving him worried looks.
Harry gave him a brief look and then focused on walking towards the main doors. They were closed, so they would be loud when opened... A silencing charm should do the trick.
"Good boy" He ran a hand through his blond hair and Harry thrashed against his restraints without realizing it. Of course, it only amused the auror. "You know what I'm going to ask you, don't you?"
Harry rolled his eyes, pressing his back to the wall and pulling part of the blankets Malfoy had monopolized. The slytherin gave him a look that said 'no' but Harry didn't give in, pulling the blankets until at least their legs were covered.
Draco didn't dare say anything else and they both lingered behind the tapestry more than they should've. When they finally resumed their walk, both of them felt much more relaxed and a small smile curved their lips. The dungeons weren't far, and Draco wished for Harry to have the invisibility cloak but of course he had forgotten it.
Anything could've happened and Harry almost expected Draco to snap at him and scream or just say something venomous. There was silence instead.
He knew no one at school that liked boys, all of his friends were straight. How could this have happened to him? And liking
Draco's room was empty when they got in, which apparently wasn't strange since only two other boys slept there. The slytherin explained very briefly that his roommates came in late, but didn't bothered him. They were still energized from the discovery and the thought of finally getting over with whatever was going on. Truth was Draco hadn't been eager to investigate and get drawn into something dangerous, so Harry could understand why he was so pleased now.
Harry tried to push pass his own pain at those words but felt a strong pang of guilt. He should go back to his best friend to try and comfort him but talking about Fred wasn't easy. Not yet. How could he go make it better when he felt so guilty?
He reached for the letter and the owl gave it without much of a fuss. It was an elegant little thing, it reminded him of her.
"Being back home... having to defend our relationship in front of my parents... I guess it made it all feel quite real" Harry didn't interrupt, he was a great listener "And... their reaction wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, you know? But it wasn't great either, and I was here all by myself and... I kept thinking and thinking-..."
“Oh, um…” Harry tried bravely to think of anything he’d seen on the news lately, but he’d spent the summer playing Quidditch with Draco. “Not much.”
Draco didn’t bother to ask what those were. He pulled his coat on, pulling it tighter around him as he looked around. He was trying to be inconspicuous, but his eyes were wide. With a twinge, Harry recognized his expression— it was the same one that Sirius had worn, right after being released from Azkaban. Muggle field trip or not, this was freedom, and he wasn’t going to let Draco waste it.
He stood carefully, Draco releasing him, and avoided eye contact as he found his wand on the floor and Summoned his sweatpants and a tee. The sweats tangled on the stairwell, and he had to wobble over to retrieve them, dressing quickly while Draco was distracted cleaning up and tucking his dick away. He felt sore and shy and heartsick, and it didn’t sit comfortably. He wanted to  sit back down, to curl against Draco’s chest or hold Draco against his, press their full bodies together for a dose of nonspeaking comfort. He wasn’t sure how sex fit into the relationship between them now, or how to talk about it now that it was happening. It was good, so good, but this pain between his legs was new to him, and Harry felt vulnerable all over again in a way he hadn’t realized Draco may have as well, when it had been his body making way for Harry. If that had even been Draco’s first time — he didn’t even know.
“I wish you would,” Harry muttered, crossing his arms and giving the now-sheepish Savage another look. He hated to feel like a petulant child when dealing with Aurors, but he’d never been able to help it.
“It’s an all-House party,” Hermione protested, picking up one weakly-yodeling garland before dropping it back into the box.
He ripped the next tapestry down, losing concern for the house. He tapped the walls all the way through the first floor, lighting up dark corners and pulling book after book down from the shelves in the library. Surely one of them would open some hatch, or at least trigger a haunting.
“First off, she’s not just your girlfriend, she’s also my best friend, so shut the fuck up.” The washing-up clattered into the sink behind them as Molly retreated to the far side of the house, and the suds splashed Harry’s jumper. He flicked the bubbles at Ron. “And so are you, this isn’t about that.”
“Rude,” Draco mumbled, as though he weren’t the one who had started it, and they wound up with a bizarre but delicious pizza cobbled together from what was left — purple kale and crushed walnuts and apple slices and some dark cured meat that Draco said was elk.
“Well, Plan B was temporary housing of some sort.” Ron knocked the scone stack off-balance and sighed, then grabbed a fork to eat the resulting mess. “Like when Durmstrang stayed on their ship. But again, perimeter… something something.”
“Do you want to go in?” He wasn’t sure what made him say it, but he didn’t expect to see Draco’s eyes widen in horror. “What?” Draco was still staring past him, so Harry turned to see what he was looking at.
“I’d be happy to help,” she agreed, and slid upward to sit on the counter. Neville leaned against her thigh unselfconsciously, and she carded the fingers of her free hand through his hair, the other hand balancing her beer on one paint-splattered knee of her faded jeans. “Last I talked to him, you had just kissed him, I believe. He seemed afraid that you hadn’t meant it, but I presume things have progressed there as well?”
“No,” Harry groused, at the same time Draco said “As I’ll ever be.” They glanced at each other, but Harry could only shrug, and then Draco and Hermione were going over their plan one more time.
“No one’s saying you have to, Harry,” Hermione said in her most reasonable tone. “But it would be nice to have some path to go down. You can always use your Auror training to go into politics. Or you can study something you didn’t have time for in school, maybe Transfigurations?”
It was hours before they got sick of flying, weaving back through the trees to the concrete benches where Harry had been completing his morning trips. Draco touched down first. Harry followed after, noting as he descended that Draco had picked up some leaves in his hair.
“Just what I said.” Harry bristled. He was dying for her to leave already, to get out and leave Draco just to him again, for however long they had before his trap was unsprung. “Look, it’s a good thing that I found him and got my friends involved, okay? Ron said you would be cool—”
“Used to have,” Harry allowed, and sloshed forward to show Draco the rest. “This one’s from a cursed necklace.” He pointed to the ugly burn that the Horcrux had left on his sternum. “This arm caught some damage from Quidditch,” he tilted it, showing the white nicks across his elbows from shoving back Bludgers. Next he lifted the side of his lip, showing the hasty repair across some of his gums, scar tissue from the day that Hedwig died that he still ran his tongue across daily. “Knocked some teeth out falling off a flying motorbike, here.” He caught sight of his own hand when he pulled it away, and twisted his wrist to show Draco the
Draco twitched and swore and came, and Harry slipped over the edge behind him. Harry shifted and let Draco move, cleaning them both with another spell before he tugged Harry down alongside him. Side by side and face to face now, Draco blinked and Harry felt his whole heart seize up. The urge to possess hadn’t left him with orgasm, it had just solidified into something larger and stronger and somehow more obsessive.
Somewhere between there and the seeking press of Draco’s hand against him, Harry came, the orgasm hitting so hard that he got blindsided, like he’d forgotten what was coming in the frenzied rush to get there. His mouth slipped away from their gasping, biting kiss as he tilted his forehead into Draco’s neck, which was somehow still cool against the heated sweat across his forehead. He reached down between them, but Draco’s hand was already there, moving as fast as it could with his wrist trapped between them.
More than anything, Draco reminded him of a cat. There was a bit of Crookshanks about him, in the way he pretended to ignore Harry until something caught his interest. It was there in the twitch of his foot like the twitch of a tail, there in the way he pushed an egg off the counter when Harry got too absorbed in baking.
Harry paused. It sounded like there was a compliment on there somewhere, albeit unintentionally. “So not only can I stay now, you need my help?”
“If you’re not cheating, you’re not trying hard enough,” Draco advised in a perfect imitation of Lucius, before jumping out the window.
“I don’t mean magically, Merlin, Potter.” Malfoy set the bottle down, a little harder than he had to. “I’m better than you in lots of ways that don’t involve my father’s outdated ideas about blood purity.”
Draco scoffed. “You don’t know what you want.” And that hurt to the core. Because as confused as Harry was, as surprised as he would have been a year ago to have given up Ginny, to reject Auror training, he
“Oh, that’s not good at all,” she said, biting her lip. “Okay, well, I’ll go look it up. But I think you really should stay, then. I
“Muggles aren’t dangerous!” Harry threw his hands up, confusion warring with the sweet spark that the word
“It’s a question of ownership,” the other voice agreed, and there was a hum of agreement from the first voice. Harry knew one of the portrait subjects was an old Malfoy wandmaker, but wasn’t sure who else had come to visit with him.”Father said…”
“I told you to shut up,” he said, his voice more strained now. “I know. I thought you weren’t coming back, Harry.”
“The powers that be asked us to check in with you. Recruitment sign-ups open this weekend. Weasley has been dropping by for weeks already.”
“Me? Oh.” Harry frowned at his own expression. “I suppose.” He cast a vision spell and plucked off his glasses, dropping them on the console table. Now Draco was the one looking too long, and Harry flushed. He knew most people didn’t see him without his glasses, and it wasn’t that he felt he looked bad without them, it was just a little like losing a security blanket. “How’s that?”
“Draco?” Harry went upstairs, calling for his former enemy as if he was a lost cat. He’d finally accepted that he was being haunted, and now his ghost had disappeared.
he heard, a hand on his forehead, before he was sucked back into that fucking cupboard, that freezing lake, that horrible cave.
“You should see how muggles open wine,” Harry said wistfully, laying back on the tiles with his plate on his chest. The sun was creeping down slowly, transforming the sky around it into orange and purple bruises. “It’s barbaric.”
Hermione hesitated. Hary tensed up: the answer wasn’t good. “Well, of course the aurors might be able to get you in. They did before! And you still have the best legal claim, of course, it’s just… sometimes…”
“This place is really something,” Hannah put in, and fuck, she seemed buzzing to be seeing Harry again. That sobered him. If he got any drunker he might find himself doing something that would lead her on out of sadness or revenge.
“Oh, black, I suppose.” Draco innocently widened his eyes, and Harry got up to shove him. “Oi, watch it!”
“Shh, no,” he whispered, tugging Draco down into a seat with him. The theater was near-empty, and onscreen a woman was selling her diamonds at Rick's Cafe Americain. “This is old. It’s before they figured out how to use color and it takes place during World War 2. In Morocco.”
“Good, good,” the blond repeated. Williamson stepped inside with him, giving Harry an apologetic half-smile.
The house liked it. As the energy between them sat humming somewhere between fever-lust and the crackle of bone-deep magic, as Harry seized the sharp curve of Draco’s shoulder and backed him down into the cushions, the manor made its approval known. Later Draco could explain the merging of its dual owners’ magic, but now he just gasped quietly as Harry sank down his body and the candelabras all burst into flame.
“Is that where we landed?” Harry felt like he’d swallowed something rotten, something that scratched at his throat from the inside like his memories of the night before, Draco’s fears laid out and Harry’s love all but admitted. It seemed impossible to breathe through, no matter how far away he went now.
Harry had never felt that way before, like a caretaker. He thought he finally understood Hagrid’s need to care for dangerous and exotic creatures: it made him feel less rudderless, having Draco to worry about in lieu of himself. It made him feel warm and proud and special, seeing Draco drip grease on the table and swipe Harry’s fries without any insults or fear.
He banged through the sitting room, the kitchens, the downstairs bathroom. No one answered him, and he as he started up the stairs, he was filled with a horrible sense of deja vu. It had been a couple months now since one day had brought so much stomach-clenching panic.
“You also?” Harry tugged, pulled Draco stumbling against him, enfolded every bone of Draco’s body against him like they were slow dancing. The thing that was rotten inside of him had gone, replaced with a perfect lightness he’d only ever glimpsed before. It felt like flying or magic or getting wet fingers into Draco.
The living room looked just as it had before Harry and Draco’s ill-fate trip into London, the blankets a mess from their movie-watching. Draco’s mug was still on the table, and Harry was relieved that they had shared it, not leaving evidence of two mugs side-by-side. Two days ago they’d been sharing a cuppa, and now the house was as silent as a tomb. He knew without checking that all Draco’s favorite rooms would be closed off. That he was probably already listening.
“Harry never questions his gut,” Hermione said gently, and Harry didn’t argue, because it was true. “He’s usually right, but ah, his judgement may not be entirely… let’s say objective.”
“I know. I know. I know that now. You don’t understand.” He turned to Harry, and Harry saw fear in his eyes, now of what Harry would think. “I’m sorry, I know I can’t defend it. But I was taught the same way I was taught to read and to write that we were better. That we were special, and that there were people who hated us for being special, and that we had to protect ourselves. That muggleborn wizards just opened the door to more and more people who would hate us if they knew us. The Malfoy family has a long history, you know that. Some of us
“Yeah, of course.” Harry nodded at the bus stop on the corner where they’d paused, its bench plastered in rain-damaged gig posters. “Here, it’s where the bus picks you up. Like the Knight Bus. But you can’t call these from anywhere so they stop here. On a schedule.”
They had a secret now, for the least of things. And it was probably illegal in some way — either Harry was squatting, or Draco was. He longed to call Ron and Hermione, but he wasn’t convinced they wouldn’t just say he was seeing things. He was inclined to believe he’d finally cracked, himself, but then there was the handshake, and the solid feeling of everything having shifted.
He woke up in the middle of the night to the warm cramp of a body beside his. “Draco?” he whispered blearily, patting around. Someone had removed his glasses in his sleep, and he patted the sheets until he found Draco’s shoulder. “Draco?”
“Hey,” Harry said softly, turning his chin so he was peering right into Draco’s face, their mouths so close that he had to ignore the pointed perfection of Draco’s teeth. Draco licked his lips, as if he saw where Harry’s eyes were drifting, as if he was anticipating something — a kiss, a telling-off for their shared space. “Wasn’t it your birthday before I got here?”
“Harry.” Hermione looked up at him - he had jumped to his feet without realizing, his heart in his throat.
Draco misread his nervous energy, squinting at him before he ventured to ask “Are you thinking of going back to Grimmauld now?”
“Quite,” Ron said, nodding with a faux-seriousness that lightened Harry’s heart, although it sent Draco scowling. “Congratulations, Malfoy.”
It was startling to be awake again. Being on the ground was strange, and it took Harry a moment to remember where he was. He was cushioned in a bed, but he wasn’t in a bedroom, and he wasn’t alone.
“Apparently I am.” Harry scrambled up and rolled his eyes at Malfoy, but it was just to cover his relief. Draco ducked the eaves above the window they’d climbed out of and disappeared. Harry picked up the near-empty  bottle and glanced back out at the sky. It was dark now, the warmth of the day leeching into a preview of the autumn to come.
he was presumed dead,” Savage corrected, his good looks twisted with an unpleasant excitement. “This may well be the last great Death Eater capture, and I won’t have that treated lightly.”
“Hmm.” Harry studied him. He certainly wasn’t trustworthy, but if Malfoy believed the house would be fine, Harry was inclined to believe him. No one knew the manor better. But if he left and Draco somehow altered the wards...
He fell asleep on the couch, and woke up to Dirty Dancing. Sleepily, he was pleased that the Manor had started playing films for him, and dragged himself to bed, only waking once to overhear the ambient cheers of The Karate Kid.
“And you’re a homewrecking room stealer. Literally a homewrecker. The wood from those floors you Vanished came from an extinct forest, you know.”
“Or you could come back to Grimmauld,” Ron put in, cheerfully. “We had Gin and Dean over last night, it was a right laugh. She made this whiskey lemonade that makes you glow in the dark, you have to try it next time.”
.” Pansy dropped Harry’s arm and hugged herself, staring straight into his eyes so he couldn’t avoid the weight of her gaze. “I’ve been working my tail off to stay distracted, joining the do-gooder team so I could finally be useful somewhere, missing him every day. You have no idea what it’s like to have someone like Draco ripped away from you, but you’ve been hanging out with him in secret and I want to know
“What, according to the Ministry?” Draco snorted, sounding much more like his normal self. “They’re stupider than you are.”
“Hilarious.” Draco’s eyes finally met Harry’s again — they were cool with anger, in that very Malfoy way that always reminded Harry of white fire. Draco was better at it than Lucius. Lucius’ rage was usually hotter, but Draco had just as much of his mother’s ice. The result was so cold it burned, and Harry couldn’t help the smug feeling that rose up at having caused it. It was the most life that Draco had shown since his appearance.
Harry stared at her hard. Pansy was wan and sincere, and he wondered for the first time how hard it had been for her to declare for the Aurors, to earn a spot despite all the scrutiny that she and her family must be under. To lose two of her friends in the same month, only for one to turn up mysteriously, half-feral and keeping company with Harry Potter.
Draco stood up and approached him. For a moment they were standing a foot apart, studying each other steadily. Harry remembered, suddenly, the first moment he’d seen Draco across from him in the manor, how it felt like a ghost dream. It didn’t feel any more real now.
“That was a different movie. He was a teen wolf in the other one, in this one he’s just got a friend with a time machine. It’s the car though, not a necklace.”
Draco’s shoulders shot up to his ears, but then he relaxed, recognizing the joke. “They’re a strange breed.”
“So you do want to come back to school? McGonagall will help you sort out a new path, I’m sure. Maybe you could teach Defense.” Hermione perked up. “We could all share the flat!”
“Draco?” Harry sighed and approached the empty space. He could feel tomorrow’s hangover sliding into place already, regret close behind. He’d said goodbye to Ginny, sure, but why punish Draco with a party to do it? What kind of a punishment was it anyway, blessing a girlfriend’s goodbye to make room for another romantic rejection? Thank Merlin for Ron and Hermione, who seemed to be the only ones who would accept any part of the love Harry had waited his whole life to offer.
He sat on the front steps of the manor, bowl nestled in his lap and bottle at his side. It was getting dark, but strange little lights were starting to dance along the garden, and statues and follies in the distance were beginning to glow as the sun disappeared. It was like some fanciful park ground, everything timed to turn on and off. He wondered if the lights had been going on and off, the pantry replacing old food, all without anyone there to oversee it. If the Manor had been left to fall down, could someone come back in a hundred years to its ruins, and still see lights coming on in the gardens at sundown?
He waited on Ron’s desk, playing with a small figure of the Chudley Cannons beater that wanted to attack his fingers and the quills on the desk. A desk over, Pansy was reluctantly collaborating with Hermione on their report, both girls nodding and pointing in turn.
Harry returned to the manor calmer than he’d left it. He stumbled from the Floo with a package of leftovers clutched against his chest, wrapped neatly but unknowingly for Draco by Molly. Harry had felt a pang of guilt when she’d handed it to him to bring back, but he knew she wouldn’t mind feeding Draco, whatever her prejudices, if she saw how thin he was.
“I have everything I need,” he said muzzily. Her hair smelled amazing, like clementines and shea butter. She pinched him.
He took out an enormous pork shoulder, and another one popped up to replace it. He picked a tomato off a picture-perfect vine, and another one bloomed in its place. Harry had one bitter moment of thinking how much he could have used a pantry like this at the Dursleys, and then went to work.
But the lights were off. Harry peered into each room upstairs, banging the doors shut to flush out any intruders. Nothing.
And if he let Draco run ahead to see more of the way those pants were fitting, he didn’t say anything either.
Harry, tipsy now and still sipping beer from the bottle, lit all the candles and played You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me on repeat. He closed his eyes, and between the music and the food and the lights, he no longer felt alone. Maybe he could do this. Maybe he could wake the house back up, make it listen to him. Live here, even. There was a savage beauty to it that he couldn’t help but appreciate, as if Hogwarts had an evil twin.
It was still early afternoon, so they ate more than they drank, and Harry’s stomach was pleasantly full by the time they spilled back out onto the street.
“I know,” He’d seen her go over even the simplest of plans a thousand times, worrying her lip bloody as she thought loud enough to hear. She’d pulled off some incredible ones over the years, but the more complex they were, the more time she spent stressing. It was weird to be in her place, this time. “I feel like I’m fucking everything up though.”
“If you hate it so much, you may as well leave,” Draco said, voice turning cold. “You have that option, but it’s the only place I can still be a Malfoy. I can’t pick and choose like you. The supermarket is cute and all, but I’m not a fucking muggle and our own world doesn’t want me to be alive.”
Harry agreed. He did hate being recognized, but more so, he wanted Draco to feel comfortably anonymous, especially if being seen with Harry Potter wasn’t a part of that. Draco’s wand felt warm on his scalp, and when it was drawn away, he had to try not to shiver. “Okay?”
One corner of Draco’s mouth picked up into a half-smile before dropping back down. He looked wistful, sad. But he didn’t say anything of the sort, just nodded to the gargoyle that lived beneath the eaves, the one that had tormented a young Draco, yet resisted destruction. It glowered at them from afar, its heavy brow reminiscent of Dudley. “Except that ugly fucker.”
“Harry knows all about that,” Luna said, elbowing Harry, who bore it good-naturedly. “I do, too. I always thought
“You could try telling me. Or wait, you did that. Safety. Safety, at the cost of your entire life, at the cost of the whole fucking world.”
It took a moment until they were settled, mugs in hand, but then she gave him her full attention, intense as that always was. “How, specifically, are you fucking things up?”
It turned out that Draco, though a solid player, was nowhere near as adept as Ron at the game. For once, Harry stood a chance, and echoes of a familiar rivalry sprung up between them as they played. Harry even kept his face stony and began to cheat, setting up a two-dimensional feint as good as any Wronksi. It took Draco the loss of two pawns and a knight to catch on, and the dawning indignance on his face was worth every bit of effort.
“I agree.” Pansy blinked, and Harry felt momentarily smug. Then he sighed. “Look, we both want the same thing, right? Leave it alone and we can work together just fine.”
She clasped his hand back. “None of us are,” she whispered back, a touch of wry, horribly adult humor in her voice.
They’d arrived ten minutes into a nostalgic showing of Casablanca, but Harry talked the ticket-taker into letting them in anyway. They slipped past the snack booth and a series of posters and cut-outs advertising upcoming films, Draco looking around more openly now that he’d had a couple of pints.
But he simply couldn’t be dead. For whatever reason, some instinct Harry couldn’t explain, he would have bet his magic on it.
They’d told a dozen people, and let Ginny invite the rest: it was officially her and Dean’s party, although Harry was sure that people were equally coming to see the house. It put a knot in his stomach, opening it up, but there was a savage, immature satisfaction in knowing that Draco would be fretting and hiding and feeling the same way.
In his arms, the stack of newspapers twitched with moving photos. Harry’s own face stared up from the top, and he shoved them all into his bag so fast that he saw his black-and-white doppleganger wrinkle.
He responded immediately, as though he’d been waiting since their last one, waiting for weeks or months or years for the chance. Draco’s lips were a soft press of sweetness, opening in a slip of cool sparks that was a slow motion revelation.
“Okay, weirdo,” Ron said, after a minute of silence. “It can be your comfort zone. Let’s just go get dinner, Mom says she’s making trifle.”
Draco snorted. “No, of course not. Enchanted horses, magical breeds. But he kept some here. I used to feed them.”
“I’ve been feeding him her leftovers,” Harry assured him, but felt guilty at Ron’s concern. Draco looked much better than he had initially, and he looked lovely to Harry, but if Ron was worried about his health, then Harry probably should have done more than bring home pain potions and flapjacks. “Once he’s safe, he can go to St Mungo’s.”
He stopped babbling and Draco sat without responding. The bench seats were stiff and uncomfortable, but the lean-to gave them a modicum of privacy. Harry cast a quick wandless muffliato, and Draco’s eyes darted over to him. “Isn’t that dangerous?”
“You have been working toward this for a long time, Harry,” Hermione interjected. She was leaning on the farthest wall now, apparently reluctant to come back in any further. “Remember all the extra classes you took? McGonagall really did a lot of work to help you.”
“I’ll keep it in mind goodbye,” he managed to say, waving like an idiot until they took the cue and popped into nothingness. “
“Why haven’t you already?” Draco shot at him. “I thought I could trust you, but you clearly can’t wait to be rid of me.”
Ron and Hermione came exactly on time, wearing matching Weasley sweaters despite the heat. Harry, cleaner now and slightly calmer, was waiting in the kitchen.
Underneath their feet, fish flitted back and forth, chasing each other from the coffee table to the squashy armchair. “Do you want to watch something else?” Harry asked. He was curious, suddenly, about what Draco would pick.
Harry spent the rest of the afternoon working on the pond, but he barely deepened it, with no wand to focus his magical effort, and he gave up in a fit of annoyance a few hours later. He stormed back into the house, annoyed at the pond and the weird way the magic here only half-accepted him, the way he was being forced into things by his friends and the weird feeling of not
“Bring whiskey next time and I’ll be more careful,” Ron grumbled in response, and Dean laughed, his eyes squinting into slits. Dean was so handsome, really, so comparatively uncomplicated, and Harry didn’t — couldn’t — blame Ginny one bit.
“Cheers, Hermione.” He signed off and stared at the sweater in his hands for a moment before dropping it to go back outside.
When Hermione left, Harry considered asking Draco what they’d been up to, or if he could see the shut-down rooms that had become Draco’s secret apartment. Instead he suggested a game of Quidditch, and Draco seemed relieved to accept.
“It’s been good for me,” Harry said politely, meaning it with his entire heart. “You’ll hear from me soon.”
“Sorry, I know it’s a secret,” Neville amended, and Luna nodded solemnly beside him. “I haven’t told anyone.”
They sat. The water was fresh and cool and it came up higher than Harry had expected, so it leached into the fabric of his jeans, darkening them up to his knees. From the ground, the manor rose up all the higher, its towers and tiles gleaming in the bright light.
Ron and Harry glanced at each other. Hermione supported Harry’s going to the Manor, but she sure as hell wasn’t going with him. Not with MUDBLOOD carved in silver on her skin.
“Standard, I assure you,” Legalwizard Shafiq said, nodding at him. Young, small, and solidly-built, she was incredibly professional: not only had she allowed Harry to introduce himself without fawning all over him, but she had yet to blink an eye about the strangeness of the circumstances. “Common in all familial claims, distant or not.”
The master bedroom was rich and red, draperies dripping in black and gold. It was almost Gryffindor-like, save for the extravagance and malicious aura. Lucius’ snake cane was propped up in a corner, and seeing it, Harry’s throat felt like it was closing. He opened Narcissa’s cupboard on a whim: beautiful robes and woven gowns crowded against one another. Harry touched one, suddenly sad. He wouldn’t miss Narcissa, exactly, but the war had taken as many of the wrong people as it had taken the right ones.
Harry’s anger spiked into place, coming easily as ever. He bit some down with effort. “Well, as the Ministry knows, I inherited this
It took two spells to warm the Florentine room he’d put his things in, but the beer helped him fall asleep right away.
,” Harry murmured, his heart sore, and he ran his palm across Draco’s jaw, thumb catching. The kiss was slow and sweet, Draco’s lashes brushing against Harry’s  cheek until Harry drew back to see his eyes flutter open, his expression uncertain but rapidly becoming sure.
“I forgot.” Harry remembered the vision, Voldemort forcing Draco’s shaking hand. “Sorry about that.”
sounded ridiculous. They wouldn’t have gone on a date, in the world. There was only the manor, and something too precious to take outside of it.
He was exhausted. Nothing like Draco looked — Draco looked how Harry ought to have expected, what with being dead. Harry looked him over, noting the bruises under his eyes, the strange sluggishness of his movement. It was like he was sick more than dead, really. Maybe a sickness had killed him.
“Yeah. Does this block look familiar?” They were getting closer with each step they took, approaching the corner store that Harry and Ron bought their booze in, the businesses turning into apartment buildings around every corner. “Like from when you were a kid?”
A few days later was his birthday. Harry had stocked Grimmauld proper with Carlsberg and Ogden’s, invited everyone he knew. Luna showed up three hours early to help set up without being asked, and Harry didn’t notice until later that she’d put out a lopsided cake with a lightning bolt iced onto it. Dean and Ginny came together, Dean a little abashed but Ginny stopping by to give Harry a kiss on the cheek before running to save Dean from Ron. The Patil twins came, Parvati clutching Lavender’s hand. Lavender was newly scarred, but she wasn’t the only one who’d changed in appearance. They all had some new scars, and Padma had shaved her head, and Lee Jordan showed up with golden tattoos that covered him from wrist to throat.
“I don’t think he’s ever hated you, Harry,” Hermione said, squeezing his hand one more time before letting it go as the doors opened.
“Me too,” Draco said glumly, and toed the carpet under their feet until it bunched up. “I really don’t want to lose the Manor.”
Now that Draco wasn’t looking at him, Harry felt free to lay back. It felt a little strange to lay in Draco’s bed with him there, but it had been a long day. “Ron’s brother tried to kill himself. And- I stayed longer than I thought.”
“Us,” Draco muses. Both of his hands slid up and down Harry’s thighs now, back and forth from his hips in a motion that no longer seems unconscious. “How curious.”
And then there was a new warmth between them, and Draco’s hand slowed and stopped. They panted into each other for a moment, the weight of limbs suddenly coming to the surface.
He’d just have to do it. Because he did love Draco, whether or not Pansy believed it. And Harry had spent too much of his life locked up under the guise of protection to do it to anybody else. That wasn’t love. Being trapped, whether in cupboards or mansions, was the opposite of love. And so he’d go along with the plan, even if it killed him.
“What, so I could kill Dumbledore in peace?” Draco shook his head, the motion rustling Harry’s hair, and Harry sighed, took his glasses off, set them on the rim of the tub.
Harry pushed Draco’s legs wider, sitting up now to rub his thumb against and into Draco, spit-soaked and straining as he worked. Harry fumbled his own fly open, watching as Draco reached for his own abandoned cock.
“Let me eat my sandwich then,” he suggested, but his voice was too warm and teasing for Harry to take him seriously.
Ron wasn’t speaking much by the end, but he bobbed in place, remaining upright at the kitchen table. Harry and Hermione and Hannah Abbott were the only ones still talking, everyone else having crept off or gone home or passed out right in the sitting room. Grimmauld was nowhere near as finished and polished as the Malfoy Manor, but it felt a thousand times homier, packed with friends as it was now.
Together they creaked down the hall and stepped outside the grand doors, leaving them ajar, light following them onto the wide marble porch. Draco reached out with one hand and snagged the narcissus as they passed, the flowers tumbling through his curled fingers and before springing free.
“Nothing,” Harry said quickly, grasping her wrist to keep her from looking. He kept his eyes focused elsewhere, deliberately ignoring the flash of blond that had sent a shock through his stomach. “Just the birds. I’ll come next week. I promise.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Honestly, Harry, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you liked it here so much. But you still can’t stay forever!”
She took a drag, watching him again, and then began coughing. Harry rolled his eyes and plucked the cigarette out of her hand, Summoning a glass and filling it with water. “I told you.”
Draco and Pansy started talking over each other, rapid-fast, and Hermione hovered as close as she dared, interjecting here and there when Draco got to the plan. Pansy had gone from
“Ugh,” Harry told him, and refilled his water glass. The kitchen was spinning a little, but he thought that he wouldn’t throw up if he focused.  “You’re disgusting. How are you not drunk? You drank more than me.”
“I just feel like I’ve abandoned both of them lately. I’ve been lying to them ever since I knew you were here, and they’re both going through a lot. Her parents, and now his brothers.”
“Like you’re so much better, hiding along with me.” A couple passed by on the far side of the water, and both of them quieted for a minute, staring at each other until they were alone again. Draco’s eyes were huge, and Harry felt somehow out of breath. He was hurt, though he didn’t know why. He
“You said you didn’t want to leave before,” Draco challenged. “You practically promised. But you clearly can’t wait to pack up.”
“Exactly.” Malfoy brushed his hands against each other smartly. “Now, I believe you mentioned more War Stars.”
Draco had watched without speaking, not reacting to the floors or the fishes’ sudden appearance. The entire first floor looked down on them now. Harry had looked between his feet at the eerie, beautiful lights, the ancient fish, and sat down right on the floor.
“Dean left them here!” she defended herself, shoving him over on the windowseat where he’d been watching out for food, “he thinks they’re artsy or some shit. Anyway, open the window.”
“Well, I can’t speak to the dining rooms,” she said, finally putting her quill down. “I didn’t get the full tour.”
It was strange to step through the fireplace, Ron behind him, both carrying a battered cardboard box. The place felt like no time had passed, like Bellatrix was just around the corner. Harry shivered: who knew what was left in this haunted place?
“Us who?” Harry rounded the door to find Draco sitting at the desk. His broom was on the desk in front of him, surrounded by the brushes and polishes of a full sportsman’s set. The air smelled oily and rich, pungent in a way that never failed to make Harry’s mouth water. Draco’s hair was pushed back, the fine blond strands a tangled swoop. It put Harry strongly in mind of a pony’s fetlock, and he bit back a smile that was mostly relief.
“I’ll definitely go to the Burrow,” Harry promised, thinking with a twinge about how much harder Ginny laughed with Dean, the months they’d been together while Harry was sleeping in a tent somewhere. Ron shrugged and got up to buy another round. Hermione rolled her eyes after him, but her expression softened a bit as Harry watched.
Harry shrugged. “I can always eat. One of the few benefits of my childhood.” The air was starting to smell good, like meat and sweet apple, and Harry put together an egg wash before leaving for the lavatory. He lingered for a moment, so that when he came back in, Draco was spooning the cooked mixture into the dough-filled ramekins.
“Don’t do anything crazy,” Hermione said into his ear. Her bristly hair tickled. Ron wrapped his long arms around them both.
“Of course. Of course, Ron, I’m sorry that I won’t be beside you.” Harry shuffled forward, and Ron closed their distance with a bear-sized hug. Harry’s next words were lost in Ron’s Cannons sweater. “You’re going to do great, though. Everyone will see that.”
“I do,” Harry said immediately, and for a moment it felt like the room had stopped repressurising. He ran his hands through his hair, surely messing it up beyond any approximatoin of sex-tousled and well into something tangled and chaotic. “I do want you to be free. But you said you wanted to be safe.”
“Yeah, mate, war’s over. You’re off the clock. Sleep, go ‘round mine, I won’t even be around to get all weird about you and Gin.” Ron clapped him on the back in an encouraging sort of way.
to him, to stalk and shadow him year after year. Hermione’s words about obsession echoed in Harry’s head, just hours old, and here was the proof. Harry ran his fingertips along the jagged, pale lines that looked like something had ripped out from inside of Draco, cutting him open in a way that even Snape hadn’t been able to heal.
“I doubt it. My property is in your name right now, the Gringotts accounts may as well be, too. If they aren’t already.”
Harry took the morning plunge toward the ground in a cannonball, whipping the broom down and around just in time to shoot up from the air above the long grass below. He couldn’t help the shout that escaped him, the joy that the adrenaline of flying always brought his way.
“Now that you know I’m here,” Draco said after a very hungover breakfast toast-and-tea, which Harry had assembled, groaning, as Draco watched from the counter again, silent and grey-faced, “we need to make some changes.”
how he wanted to ask her more about that, with how warm it made him feel, but he had to make her understand. “We’ve been talking, and hanging out, and you already know how amazing he is, how difficult and strange and special, but you don’t know me. So maybe it doesn’t make sense to you, but it doesn’t have to. I love him. I always will now, no matter what happens, even when this is all over.”
“Can’t wait to get rid of me, eh?” Harry joked weakly, but Malfoy just waited. Harry sighed. “No. I mean, I was thinking of it, but I don’t know if I should. When I got there today they were happy to see me, but no one had called me. I think… I just feel like I’m in the way of them now. Like they need time to be a couple and not be on another mad Harry adventure. It’s like everything’s over now and they don’t need me. I almost wonder if it’s better they’re not around me to heal.”
Harry looked down at his chest, surprised. He’d been so comfortable the last day or so, he’d never bothered to dress properly. He threw a sweater on now, though, and went out to the grounds, trailed by peacocks.
Draco picked up his broom again and turned away from Harry. His shoulders were stiff, but he continued buffing out a grass stain without saying anything else, so Harry took that as his invitation to continue.
“I know.” Draco brushed a hand through his hair, found the leaves, and scowled at him. Harry pressed his lips together to keep from laughing. “Now who’s the fucker?”
“Do you want some more stuff, then?” Ron looked to Hermione, who nodded and disappeared again. Harry was starting to feel like he was watching some sort of puppet show.
Nothing. Although the house wasn’t exactly cooperating. He could feel a resistance in the air, like the magic in the house had been polite so far, but wasn’t about to let his spells reach their full power now. Light started reflecting into his face from the windows, and dust flew into his nose in the owlery, though he knew it had been clean that morning. Determined to force a reaction, Harry took a deep breath and then sprang around a corner to the hallway, wand drawn to cast a Revelio again, battle-quick.
“Thanks,” he told her, and set the cider he’d been holding down on the mantle. “I’m really glad it dropped into my lap.” And if that wasn’t the understatement of his lifetime.
“It would have been too crowded, though, and the stonework wasn’t taking well to expansion charms what with the extensive rebuilding. It was hard enough re-establishing all the perimeter fortifications.” Ron had sliced two scones into halves and stacked them into a wobbling clotted-cream tower. Now it was too big to fit into his mouth, and he was trying to mash the mess down with a jam knife.
Draco’s face went through a dozen more pinched emotions that Harry wouldn’t have been able to read a month ago. Anger, at the implication that Harry would defend the manor better. Shame, at returning to hiding. And back to fear, above all a worn-in look of fear. “Okay. Harry- okay.”
“She yells at you, too?” Harry was surprised. “I thought she just didn’t like me for being muggleborn.”
“Why didn’t you take your room?” Harry broke the silence on purpose. Draco seemed uncharacteristically predisposed toward silence now, and he’d been hogging the bottle, as well.
He put it down to opportunity: he knew from years of hassling Ron in the dorms that Draco was at the perfect stage for truth-telling. Harry pushed his advantage. “Do you like cooking?”
“You could come here,” Ron suggested warily, instead. He was still clutching his trousers at the button, holding them upright. Harry had just started to take in the fact that Ron was very underdressed when Hermione interjected, shouting from somewhere he couldn’t see.
Harry followed Ron out to the hallway, where Ron had become fascinated by a landscape painting of Hippogriffs cavorting with racehorses. “Well?”
Ron directed the garlands up around the kitchen and main living room, tucking some around the movie screen while Dean loaded up Dazed and Confused. Ginny poured another round, Hermione corrected Ron’s garland placement, and Harry opened up the Floo.
“Give us a moment, Harry,” Shacklebolt added, more quietly now that it was just the three of them. “I’d like to speak to young Malfoy.”
“And a trophy,” Ron groused, leaning all the way back until his chair squealed in protest. “A bloody huge one.”
They made it back to the waterway and down into the canal. Once they were alone again, surrounded by cool cement walls and quiet water, Draco spun around. “We have to go back.”
Harry could smell the bait, but he took it. “No one’s said. Probably fucked off to France or something, I should ask Kingsley if they’ve got him.”
Onscreen, Rick and Renault were wrapping up their lines. In the theater, Harry reached for Draco’s hand again.
It didn’t feel like enough to be the remains of a whole person. Especially one who, for better or for worse, had loomed so large in Harry’s life.
Fucking Malfoy. “I think you’re strong,” Harry told him, still not sure if he was speaking. He wanted to kiss Draco’s squinting smile, suddenly, and he did, natural as anything. It made sense the way spinning in nothingness made sense - after all, they were magic, him and Draco and the huge home that encircled them in its arms. “You’ve survived so much.”
Hermione’s small assigned flat was on the outskirts of the small village, closest to the path to Hogwarts but situated at the end of the main cobblestoned street. It sat above a magical milliner’s, just a block away from the Madam Puddifoot. Strange to think an awkward date with Cho had once been the ultimate difficulty in Harry’s love life.
hit. “I thought I’d practice with a bludger and when it got me I realized there was no point running Quidditch drills without Ron, anyway. Plus you could have saved my nose.”
So the next day, when he saw Ron and Hermione off, it was a shock to see the day’s headlines. The Apparition point was a newsstand on the corner of Canon Row and Bridge Street, charmed to mask the sight of anyone slipping inside from those passing back and forth to Westminster Station. Hermione let herself in, and then Ron, and they peered out at Harry from a frame of glamour magazines and tabloids.
“Oh, that’s reassuring, thanks,” Harry nodded. He twisted round — it had sounded like a window had closed somewhere upstairs. Maybe he’d left one open.
They Flooed over in two groups, Harry hand-in-hand with the girls, then Ron and Dean with their arms loaded up with the decorations and, yes, some whiskey.
“Quidditch, is it?” Draco sounded indifferent to the suggestion, but they both started heading upstairs without further discussion. Harry glanced over as they neared the door to the Quidditch room and found Draco looking back, both of them anticipating an attack from the other. They laughed, and then, feeling awkward, Harry let Draco enter first.
“Enough?” Harry’s heart was beating very fast, the whorls of unbalanced magic from the Ministry stirring up in his chest.
“For fuck’s sake,” Draco swore, turning now to pinch at him. He wound up half on Harry, and Harry wrapped one arm around him to ruffle his hair, dropping it down once Draco was distracted in fixing it and tugging Draco up against his side.
Harry stumbled into the bathroom and splashed his face with water, taking advantage of the quiet moment to push his magic into the walls and try to feel around. He could tell the house was torn between sulking alongside Draco and being pleased at having people over — no doors were slamming, but the fridge wasn’t supplying any beer. He couldn’t sense Draco anywhere, and he pressed his cheek into the cool wallpaper. Where were the warrens and trapdoors that Draco had never shared? Were there more than he’d imagined, entire rooms or wings of secrets still closed away? He missed Draco desperately after two days apart. Everything was worse without him now, even through Harry’s well-worn anger.
“It’s not the muggles,” Draco admitted. Harry stepped up onto the bridge with him, and Draco took a step back to keep their distance. “It’s just too careless. You brought me to your house, where people who could recognize me live. Why? Do you want us out of the manor so badly? Do you hate being trapped with me? Because you can leave anytime.” Harry cursed himself internally. He just hadn’t thought about it. He’d wanted to share something of himself with Draco, the way Draco had reluctantly ended up opening his home to him.
“Is everyone ready?” Hermione fretted, looking around at them. It was a Sunday night, with an early-morning Portkey waiting to  take Ginny and Dean to New York in the morning. Hermione’s bags were packed as well, for her new commute to and from Hogwarts.
If Draco wanted to steal his friends and let them into his secret hiding places, where Harry still hadn’t been allowed, that was progress, he supposed —although it did sting a bit.
“The Man,” he tried to tell his reflection, half-blurred by an unwashed window. “Who Has His Shit Together.”
“Less than nothing, but I lived in fear of my father hearing it.” Draco sighed and kicked his feet in the water. It splashed Harry a little, and he splashed back, but Draco didn’t rise to the challenge. Instead he seemed to be miles away.
“Harry Potter!” Two Aurors stood in the arched doorframe. They wore matching scarlet robes, but couldn’t have looked more different: he recognized Williamson, an ancient man with a riot of dreadlocks that were barely contained by his ponytail. The other was sandy blonde and tan, looking like an off-brand Australian Malfoy. He’d been the one to shout Harry’s name, and he followed it up with a wave of genial overfamiliarity, stepping over the door frame and clapping Harry on the back in the same gesture. It wasn’t an attack, but it didn’t help Harry relax any. “Good to see you, mate, good to see you.”
“I can’t tell, honestly.” Harry hovered awkwardly behind Draco, not sure if he should sit. He hated hanging out in cupboards. “Can I help?”
After a few hours he’d stewed himself into a right strop. Besides, he was sweating again, a sticky level of grime forming on top of his already-cooled sweat. He started stripping down in the middle of the doorway, sick of feeling gross and trapped and prodded at, kicking his trainers into the decorative panels of rich wood in the hallway. He slammed the door shut, delighting in the alarming noise the glass inserts made from the impact.
“Was it following my lead to take me to muggle London? Some fucking lunch date?” Draco shook his head, looking regretful. “I shouldn’t have agreed. I’m not safe here.”
“Hmm.” The shopkeeper looked thoughtful, but shrugged reluctantly as he met Harry at the cash register. “Not much in any of the papers, to be honest, past the bodies being discovered and that short series about the boy going missing.”
Harry glanced over, expecting Draco to object to being called a boy, but he kept his head down. It was strange to see Draco so far out of his element. Usually he was the brightest thing in the room, but now he was washed out, colorless. He was barely blinking, and Harry knew how terrified he must be.
“Go and find some wine,” Draco suggested. He turned back around and began cutting the sandwich, putting both halves in the same plate before he wrinkled his nose and reached for a second plate to better separate his meal from Harry’s saucy mess. “You mongrel.”
“Not so bad.” Harry shredded the last piece of scone with his thumb, ignoring the look Hermione was now giving him.
were worried? I thought I was locked in my tomb by the world’s most feted hero, and you thought I didn’t trot out fast enough when master came home.” Draco dipped a rag in the varnish, a little more violently than necessary.
Finally he’d searched the Manor to the top tower, the sun going down around him from the uppermost window. He paused for a minute, trying to breathe deeply and take it in. The manicured grounds stretched on into forest, paths leading to little structures, the flowers he’d planted already in magical bloom. Snow or Betty White was by the tiny koi pond, drinking with graceful dips of their long, elegant neck. In the distance, clouds were gathering, collecting the sunset’s colors in smudges and strips. He took another breath, willing himself to relax, to go make some tea and turn in, to stop worrying about ghosts and stop going insane and stop
“Your owl?” Harry nodded, his throat closing up, as it always did when he thought of her. She’d been a good girl. Draco hesitated, then reached out, giving his forearm an awkward pat. Because his arms were crossed, Draco’s hand caught for a moment before sliding off. It helped.
Ron tipped his glass and said, tightly, “Fred.” Hermione said “Tonks and Remus.” Dean, thoughtfully, said “Snape,” and almost no-one booed. “Dumbledore,” Ginny added, and Transfigured everyone’s drinks into a Sherbet Lemondrop for that sip.
“Do you have any of those little ceramic baking things?” Harry asked, sniffing the sage before laying it next to the thyme on the cutting board.
“I’m getting paranoid,” he mumbled to himself, rubbing his eyes. Draco’s room was last, and he sat on the bed to let his heart calm down. It was comfortable, almost warm in this tomb of a place. He was tempted to lay down and fall asleep right there… and because he was exhausted, and because it was his house, he did.
, it’s the most at home I’ve ever felt. I want to fly in the morning and drink at night and argue about what to eat for dinner. I want your stupid tantrums and your magic fish and I want to fight with you and watch you watch movies and I would
“My mom would braid their hair,” Draco added, perhaps sensing Harry’s momentary slip into malaise. “She had a way with hair, she would always braid my dad’s, too. I think she wanted me to grow mine out, too. She used to play with it a lot when I was a kid.”
Harry’s stomach twisted. He hadn’t known. It made sense, though: Ron’s face came to mind, bright and excited every time he mentioned training. “Er, well, I don’t have the NEWTs.”
“What’s my cats name?” Hermione demanded, not relenting. A spark tumbled out of her wand and skittered across the old carpet.
“The propaganda stops in mid-May,” he said, marking the date with a red-inked quill. “It will be obvious in the
“Oh, no, I… no.” Draco sat up, and Harry, upset with himself now for losing his warm body pillow, sat up with him. “I don’t look nice.”
Ron took his hesitation as an answer. His face softened. “You know we’re still brothers, right mate?”
“Look at how they stock this. They have to store everything in one place! No Summoning or replenishing. The cost to operate these places must be phenomenal. What do you know about the muggle economy?”
“It’s still weird to hear you call him that,” she sighed, shaking her head. “He’s fine, he’s looking something else up. I think we may have something, but it will take time to check.”
“I thought it would be fun to hang out in here,” Harry shrugged, and turned to face him. Draco still had his shirt on, but Harry didn’t, and he could feel Draco’s eyes flit across his chest before looking away. From the walls, and in the passion of their morning, he probably hadn’t seen just how many scars Harry had apart from the one that everyone defined him by. He looked back, seemingly unable to help it, and Harry beckoned him all the way into the room.
Harry blew them a kiss, and they popped into nothingness. The summer air rushed to fill the space they’d been, a hot gust brushing past Harry’s cheek like the touch of someone’s fingers.
Draco was leaning on the kitchen island, uncertain, when Harry came in. His hand was wrapped around a bottle of Firewhiskey, and he still held himself in that proud, prickly way that signaled fear, though his shoulders had come down from their catlike hunch.
They went back inside, and Harry tried his best to be distracting from the buzzing, humming thoughts that he could see through Draco’s pale eyes. It worked, for a while, and their bodies moved together in a way that had begun to feel familiar. While their fingers brushed and while Draco’s mouth opened on Harry’s neck and while Harry felt his balls tighten and twitch, everything disappeared but sensation and skin. He even drifted off in a tangle with Draco, all sore muscles and warm blankets, but when he blinked his eyes open again, Draco was at his desk, his nose in a law book and his back to Harry.
“Perish the thought,” was Draco’s instant reply, but there was no heat in it.. He bit his lips as Harry came closer, shut his eyes when Harry’s wand brushed his cheek. “Just...make me look different.”
Draco laughed out loud at that. Harry was surprised that it hurt his feelings, and he pulled an elaborate frown at Draco when he stopped. “Sorry,” Draco said, smiling again now. He seemed genuinely amused. “I do.”
“Maybe.” Harry worried his lip, thinking. “I went out to the edge of the property the other day. I’ll try it out and let you know. There’s something I’ve been wanting to do outside anyway.”
He called Luna next. “I think I’m going insane,” he told her, as soon as she popped her head into the fireplace.
Williamson nodded, but Savage didn’t know when to shut up. “I’ve heard tale of criminal mischief and attacking other students-“
“Hmmm,” Hermione added, sounding thoughtful. Harry kept his eyes shut to avoid whatever look she was giving him.
,” Draco replied, but the insult was delivered automatically and without heat, he was peering at his knuckles, focused on the Bowtruckle.
Draco watched, leaning against the counter without saying a word, just out of arm’s reach. He just watched as Harry started chopping, grating, peeling, and eventually sat on the countertop. Harry didn’t look at him directly, afraid of scaring Draco away before he’d had a proper meal. For someone like Harry, cooking came naturally, but he suspected the blond had been scavenging just cold, uncooked foods – bread and honey and apples, bits of jerky and assorted nuts. The new foods that had showed up with the appearance of Draco’s wand must be his favorites, but he looked like he’d been starving for most of the time he’d been alone here. And if anyone knew anything about keeping quiet and hungry in closed-off rooms, it was Harry.
But Draco seemed encouraged somehow, and he licked his lips before reaching for his shirt. Harry scooted forward, splashing some water over the rim of the tub to put his arms up on its edge. He wasn’t ready for what he saw underneath the soft cotton — scars, and lots of them.
MALFOY HEIR MISSING, the Prophet said, above a pixelated photo of Draco, his face cropped out from some gala shot with his father. Lucius’ shoulder still remained half in-frame, looming up and over to the side, casting a shadow on Draco’s elegant, blinking face. Elegant? Pointy, he meant.
“You didn’t know he was even alive then, did you?” Neville museed. Luna leaped from grass to platform, collecting spinning coins.
Draco turned to the hall, and Harry went to answer the door. Someone knocked a second time, and the gargoyle closest to the door started a low warning yowl. How had anyone gotten past the Malfoy wards? Who could do that, and then choose to knock? He glanced back over his shoulder to ensure that Draco was out of sight, and caught a glimpse of him disappearing into one of the tapestries down the hallway, where Harry knew for a fact the wall was solid stone.
They set it out at the kitchen table. Draco took his side, the lighter pieces, and Harry lined up the dark ones for a pre-game pep talk.
Draco found the back of Harry’s neck and gripped him tight, apparently unaware of how rough his hold was, but Harry didn’t mind. He ran his cheek across the soft skin and the dark hair he’d dreamed of on Draco’s lower stomach, feeling the muscles there tensing underneath.
It was almost like he was flirting. The swoop in his stomach was the same as teasing Ginny, as the adrenaline joy of jumping out the window. But that was impossible. He’d just always had a strange way with Malfoy, a methodical madness borne of parallel experience.
And then there was nothing for it but to walk the entire home, tapping walls with his wand along the way. He considered calling Ron over, but he couldn’t be sure that he’d really seen anything. “Revelio,” he called, over and over. “Aparecium. Finite incantatem.”
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked in the dream, but he was floating, wet white hair all around his face.
“Great, they helped everyone keep an eye out for me,” Harry groused, wiping crumbs from his mouth, while Draco laughed at the headline
“Shh,” Harry repeated, and squeezed Draco’s hand to shut him up. Draco swallowed his words and jerked his head around, eyes wide on Harry before the screen darkened again. Half-embarrassed, Harry let his hand go.
Harry knew Ron hadn’t intended to enter Auror office politics by defending Draco. “Thank you. I’ll get you a million medals.”
Ron walked over and bumped shoulders with Harry, looking tense. “She didn’t believe me,” he murmured, “but I promised her lunch, so you’d better have food.”
sorry, you know,” he told the wall, his cheek on his forearm as he faced the fresh stretch of paneling. “I shouldn’t have had a party. I shouldn’t have disappeared all weekend. I shouldn’t have forced you to go to London if you didn’t want to, and I shouldn’t have brought you where Hermione could see you. Maybe I shouldn’t have moved into your house and stayed.” He rolled onto his back. The ceiling was light, warm wood, with celestial lights embedded into it that seemed to shift with the seasons. He got lost in watching them, tracing constellations that he couldn’t name, even after months sleeping under the sky.
I'm so sorry that this chapter isn't fun! I wanted to show how Harry isn't the only one dealing with tragedy and loss, and the different ways people are reacting and how that shapes them in the months after the war. It's my way of indicating why and how Harry is able to disappear right now: everyone else is putting themselves back together, as well, and not always successfully.
For a moment Harry’s heart stopped, and then Draco rose slowly back into view, grinning from atop his broom. He looked brilliant and untethered, free from the walls of the manor and all of its expectations, at least in that moment. Harry glanced below Draco’s dangling feet: the grounds were far below.
“Potter,” he rumbled, “Glad to see you as well. Didn’t see you after the battle. Shacklebolt snatched you right up for the debrief. Have you met Savage?”
“We go every week, he can come next week,” Ron said to her, lowering his voice as though Harry couldn’t hear.
When they went back inside, Harry found that he was drunker than anticipated. He tripped over the windowsill coming in, and had to catch himself against the wall. “Fuck.”
“So, as you can imagine, we’ll have to take a drop of your blood and perform a standard inspection of your wand.”
She squinted at him, then nodded. “Okay. And you’re right, we don’t know what it’s like to be or lose a twin. I just hope he doesn’t do anything like that again. It’s good that they’re circling the wagons, it will help remind him of all the brothers he does have.”
“I think you’d turn into a fish,” Draco said dubiously, peering into the water. It was koi-free, but still swirling with some of the magic that had kept them fed and temperate. Harry laughed, then stopped when he saw Draco’s serious expression.
and I have every right to be here. As for the wand, it’s also in my possession. It’s linked to the magic of the house, so it’s been helpful to use. Hermione Granger can attest to that, if you doubt me.”
The wand helped, Harry thought, but in weird ways. For one thing the food supply had changed, shifting to a collection of fanciful sweets, French breads, and exotic fruits that Harry wasn’t going to argue with, although he wondered at their appearance. When he used the wand to freshen up the warming spells that had been failing hourly, they sank into every cushion and comforter with ferocity, making his butt sweat every time he sat down until he could adjust the temperature.
When the credits rolled, the other people in the theater left, one by one abandoning Harry and Draco to a silent darkness. It felt like Harry held his breath until Draco let go of his hand. He sighed, a long and ragged breath that matched the way Harry was feeling — no film needed.
“Come here,” Harry whispered, and Draco came to the side of the tub, letting Harry run his hands up and down his torso, tugging down to rid him of his pants. “Let me see.”
“And what do you think?” Harry challenged, finding words at the back of the knot in his throat. He knew he was more oblivious than most, but he never grew used to the way people tended to know more than him, even about his own life.
“He looks like shit,” Ron said in a hushed voice, turning to Harry while rubbing his jaw. “He needs to see a Mediwizard, my mum would have kittens over how thin he’s gotten.”
“My — I switched wands recently,” he said carefully, thinking of the pieces of the Elder Wand, of Malfoy’s in his underwear drawer at Grimmauld. “Will that be a problem?”
Draco kissed him. Harry’s breath was whiskey-stale and Draco was practically vibrating with anxiety, pressing his lips to Harry’s like he was determining the right way to do it. His fingers flitted up to Harry’s cheek, pressing in to hold him in place, as though there was anywhere in the world that Harry would rather be.
The whisper turned into a buzz, but Harry tuned it all out. All he could feel was the cool press of fingers under his, and he didn’t let go until they stepped through the flames.
“What ugly fucker?” Harry asked, the picture of nonchalance, as the gargoyle shattered into a million stone pieces.
,” Ginny grumbled, but came close enough to touch his face. She did kiss him now, gently, and Harry brushed the dirt from her forehead as she stayed close, watching him. The touch of her lips was comforting, but so was the thought that she was leaving, making a choice without his having to torture himself about whether he wanted her. He’d thought he had.
It felt good to touch. He pushed his hair back in time to feel his nose crunch under the base of Draco’s palm, to see the split lip that he’d somehow already caused. He swore, and Draco smiled, his savage grin dripping blood.
Draco allowed it, his body folding forward toward Harry so they  were linked, floor to chair, in front of the fire. The carpet was plush under Harry’s knees, and he was tempted to stay down there, but Draco wound a hand into his hair, kissed his forehead, and tugged him up painfully.
“I know.” She squeezed again and let him go, her eyes sweeping quickly over his in that way she had of seeing everything. “I’m glad you found him.”
The morning of the meeting with Pansy came too soon, in Harry’s opinion. Draco spent the time fretting and then denying that he was fretting, acting like a cat with its back up whenever Harry tried to bring up the topic. Instead he let Draco and Hermione whisper at each other through the Floo, escaped to the living room or Grimmauld to watch telly with Ron, and only talked to Draco about dinner or Betty White or the wonky portrait on the second floor that had been hiccuping for a week.
“Mmm,” she nodded, and followed Harry’s nod to the plate cabinet, setting them out on the table while she thought, her focus shifted off of Harry now. Harry was relieved to have been released, and he set to serving everyone. Draco and Hermione sat down together, pointing at one thing or another as they rumbled over each other, bent inward, and Harry set to eating in silence. He didn’t mind — it was strange, to see the two of them, their hair nearly white and nearly black, brushing as they bickered. He thought he liked it.
Maybe. Fuck.” Draco looked terrified. It was a familiar look on his face, one that sent pain and regret singing through Harry in complicated patterns.
The problem with magic was that it could be hard to know what you were looking at. He popped up and wandered over, brushing his hands off on his pants. The panelled wall outside the kitchen looked as though it had twitched, or flexed, or something. It triggered a memory of the Room of Requirement, maybe, and he ran his hand along the wall. It seemed normal. He tapped it: normal.
“Fucking Merlin,” Draco said to the ceiling, before he forced a charming smile in Ron’s direction. “I mean, thanks ever so.”
He aimed his blush at the screen and waited for the moment to pass, which it did easily, as Draco was engrossed in the scene at Rick’s right away. Ilsa. Victor Laszlo. As Time Goes By, and Rick’s secret pain. The black and white and grey of the screen flickered over Draco’s altered face, casting it in monochromatic and dramatic lines. As much as Draco was sucked into the film, Harry was sucked into watching Draco watch it, glancing over as often as he watched the screen. Confessions of love, a train station in Paris, a daring escape.
“She’s my best friend.” Draco’s fingers tapped a beat on Harry’s thigh, but his face was far away. “She thought I was dead.”
Harry cleared his throat. He had to stop thinking such maudlin thoughts or he’d never survive the week. It was basically a week alone in a luxury hotel, keyed only to let him in — even if he couldn’t quite bring himself to treat the place with disrespect, it was important that he keep filling it with things like vindaloo instead of things like Unspeakables.
After that the Manor seemed more in tune with Harry’s lifestyle, and didn’t trip him anymore. It let Harry tug back portrait coverings that had been stuck, giving each painting a chance to move again. None did, but the Manor didn’t cover them back up, either.
“Hit up Ginny,” Ron suggested. “Seriously, Harry, try to enjoy yourself. The war is over, and we’re the ones still alive. Maybe try to do some living.” He wrapped his arm around Hermione, and she tucked herself in tight to his neck. Brilliant freckles and nut-brown skin, his two best friends.
“Ron. Ticket salesperson. Pounds,” Harry corrected quietly, reaching for Draco’s flailing wrists again. Draco stilled, letting him take them, turning his body toward Harry’s. Their toes bumped together, and Draco’s breath was still sour with stale fear, but near-invisible freckles from a summer of Quidditch spread across his nose and his hair in this light was more gold than silver.
Most of the desks were empty, but they could hear voices right away. A cluster of the desk workers were gathered near the back of the room talking to each other, parallel to one of the rooms. It was clear they were waiting to hear what was happening inside, and Ron wasn’t among them, which meant…
“What do you think happened to him?” Harry asked as casually as he could, his heart thumping into his ribs as he counted out his galleons.
He kicked his shoes off instead, leaving them sideways and nowhere near his mismatched socks, which sank into the mud when he stepped on them. Draco puffed out a sigh of exasperation and twitched his wand, sending Harry’s things into a neat line next to his own.
“Very good.” Williamson stuck his hand out and Harry shook it. “This place looks better than before, by the way. Good, friendly magical energy on the scan apart from the Malfoy wand. Seems like you’ve been good for the place.”
Harry let him come back slowly. He knew when they went back inside, they’d have to change, face the rest of the day. He’d have to start thinking about Ron and Hermione and what he was going to do with his life, about Ginny’s departure, about how his friends were going to disappear into new jobs and relationships and cities.
“Call yourself a bloody Gryffindor,” Draco huffed. He looked as though he was on the verge of pushing all the pieces to the floor, spoilt only child that he was.
Harry laughed at that and tilted his face to the side, where Draco was smirking. “Don’t act like I’m the weird one for taking my clothes off when I thought I was alone, but you’re not the weird one for spying on me.”
“Hey, I would have told you,” Harry pointed out, offended. “I’m not trying to steal from you. You’re the one who doesn’t want anyone to know they’re alive.”
They watched The Craft after dinner and Draco laughed himself sick at every scene with magic in it. His laugh sounded a little stale, but soon the girls were playing Light As A Feather, Stiff As A Board, and Harry laughed, too.
“I’m undead right now. No one is bothering to hate me. But to get anything back, I’d have to face everyone. The Ministry. Azkaban, probably. Everyone who hated my family, or who owed my dad revenge. Death Eaters who blame us for failing the Dark Lord. The fucking Gryffindor cartel, judging me every day of the rest of my life, poisoning any career or family I try to build.”
Then there was a gap between them, and the fear of scaring Draco off became the fear of missing his chance, and Harry chased Draco’s lips down the distance. He caught them roughly, too-fast, and the press between them shifted into something impossibly urgent.
“Sometimes the House Unplots itself,” Ron supplied reluctantly. “Goes missing. Whole Wizarding colonies have done it before, you know. Roanoke, Atlantis, even Brigadoon had a variation of it for a while. Think of it like Grimmauld to the Muggles. But no worries, mate, right? You gave it a try, you can’t be locked up in here forever. How many places do you even need?”
“I think it looks better this way,” Ron said helpfully, and ran away when Harry tried to smack him. He gave chase, and cornered Ron in the sitting room, grabbing for the drumstick in a brotherly fight that felt a world away from the one he’d just finished. “Don’t you dare,” Ron laughed, cradling his prize to his chest like an infant. “I’ll poke you in the nose.”
— but then Draco was digging his elbow into Harry’s ribs and they were trying to shove each other off the roof and then they had to rescue the wine bottle from sliding off the side and things calmed back down.
Hermione brought out two mugs: they were from Grimmauld Place, he noticed, and he found it absurdly comforting that she was treating this place like an extension of Grimmauld, rather than a totally new chapter of life without it. He liked to think of Ron and Hermione being at Grimmauld, with or without him. Hermione glanced at him now, taking in his face, and went back into the cupboard for some biscuits. She came to sit, the kettle screaming as soon as she was halfway over the couch, and Harry stood to grab the packet from her so she could turn back around.
“Death looks like the Hogwarts Express,” he put in, trying for helpful. Draco just blinked at him.”Is that why you came out now? Because you were going mad?”
“Stick to your disgusting half,” Draco advised, and smacked Harry’s hand when he reached for the ham. “You’re such a mongrel.”
In the meantime he was alone, and Malfoy had never been found. Wizarding law usually wouldn’t presume him dead for a year and a day, but the Manor was deemed a safety risk, standing unclaimed. Harry had seen Malfoy’s face top the Prophet over and over, as the Ministry called emergency meetings, sent out Aurors, and overall did little to squash the rampant speculation. Gringotts claimed no one had been to the family vaults, but many thought Malfoy had fucked off with a fortune anyway. More thought he was dead. And now the Ministry had decided that, something having to be done, they’d declare Malfoy missing.
Ron, Pansy, Williamson, Savage, Robards, and Kingsley looked up at once, but behind them, the only one sitting down, was Draco with his head tipped down. He looked like shit. Pale, colorless hair covered his eyes, and Harry longed to run to him, but he jerked himself together and assessed everyone’s expressions.
They put lunch on the table in silence and Draco came down twenty minutes later, his nose still in a book.
.” Harry poked Draco, who turned back to him with a smile. He seemed relaxed now, more excited about the discoveries there were to be made now that they were snack-related and not Voldemort-related.
“Am I going crazy?” he whispered to himself, jeans soaking through, waters rushing like the blood in his ears.
“Okay,” she said, voice back to normal. “But let me know if you need any help to figure something out. I hate to see you alone in that house, wasting your life.”
Harry went straight to the kitchen for water and a slice of leftover pizza to gnaw on. Draco followed, though he acted like it was a coincidence that they had both wound up in the same room. He dug an oily-looking dessert liqueur out of the freezer and tipped it back.
hi I just meant for the sexin' to happen and then they got into another fight. but then they made up! ah, drarry.
“Look at the projector!” Ginny crowed on the way, and Harry glanced back to see Ron checking in on Hermione. He left them for the moment, showing Dean and Ginny where to slide bottles into the fridge and twitching his wand out of his pocket to turn the lights up and set some wards to keep people from sneaking upstairs.
,” Draco snapped, his eyes opening up again so he could glare at Harry. His hand, stopped despite his words, stretched across his stomach just above the leaking tip of his flushed cock. It was all Harry could do to stop from diving down to taste it again. Instead he shifted his weight and nudged forward, shoving his pants down enough to replace his thumb with the tip of his dick, rubbing and grinding and inching himself forward until Draco whispered a spell and suddenly Harry was home.
For better or for worse, he was protecting this strange place and its secrets, Draco most of all. Harry opened the door.
“Thanks,” Harry said, wondering suddenly if there was a television anywhere in the house. “I’ll come over for the Cannons game tomorrow?”
He turned the floors into thick glass, dropped balls of illumination into the the dark water underneath them. He’d let the pent-up magic in his wand unfold for a moment, before screwing up his face and bringing the koi inside. They popped up in the waters, one after another like spots of blooming color, streaking quickly and then settling, more sedately, into a rhythm.
Harry glanced over his shoulder, searching for something to say. The little plant on Draco’s desk that usually had a rain cloud covering it had cleared, an itty-bitty sun hovering in its place now. What could he say? That his nightmares had gone from dying in a forest to finding Draco dead in the walls of the manor? That his dreams had become lurid and haunting, starring the backs of Draco’s knees and the taste of his tongue? He couldn’t promise much on behalf of the wizarding world. He couldn’t make promises for Ron and Hermione, even, as he’d hidden Draco from them too. He could offer to fight for Draco, and he knew he would, but he’d just turned down the one job in which he could protect him. In the end, there was nothing to say, except “I’m lucky you were here.”
“Why’d you take both wands?” Harry asked, to distract Draco as much as himself. He’d squeezed a lemon over some chopped chicken and veg, following with oregano, pepper, salt, garlic, and olive oil. He wasn’t sure what vitamins you gave someone who had been hiding in a walled-off room, so he’d mixed red onion, some peppers, and a courgette in. There was feta in the fridge: he set it aside to add once everything was done roasting. Everything went on one pan and into the oven at the same temperature: he’d kept it easy, just in case Draco was paying attention.
Harry steered them toward the water. Draco already seemed overwhelmed, keeping his hands in his pockets as they walked, his eyes on every stranger. They moved through a few blocks of shops and past the Row gardens, people being replaced slowly by a quiet peace. They slipped down the stairs to the waterway, the stillness of the cool waters reflecting the green of the trees above. A few small boats were pulled up to the cobblestoned shores, and a couple of people were walking their dogs, but they were mostly alone. Draco’s hands hadn’t left his pockets: Harry guessed he was touching his wand.
“They would have kicked out Voldemort and started family counseling? Draco, you did what you could. I think they were probably scared, too. None of you wanted to lose each other, and I don’t blame you for that.”
He still didn’t know what had made her say it, and Draco was dodgy about the details of their conversation when he asked. But the next day he half-woke to Draco’s chaste, early-morning kiss, fell back asleep to the sound of puttering about in the walls, and woke up for good to the sound of the Floo and Hermione’s familiar footsteps coming up the stairs. He turned his head on the pillow to see her come in, smile at whatever she saw on his sleep-addled face, and then knock on the wall.
“He wasn't a real Death Eater, he was a minor,” Ron added, looking as surprised as Pansy beside him that he’d spoken up. There was a small couch in the corner, and Ron and Pansy were squashed uncomfortably together, clearly trying not to touch.
Harry slept in Draco’s room after that. It just felt friendlier, more lived-in somehow, less cramped and formal then the other one. He only had a couple more nights, anyway, so he thought it didn’t matter much.
Harry could feel the disbelief in the air and knew they were seconds away from being approached. He always was, these days, and he longed to be back to the peace of the manor too.
“You bring me whatever I want. But I want more than you can bring me.” Draco put his cheek on his knees, and Harry scooted closer. He wanted so badly to touch Draco’s hair again, to fix the mess he’d made there. When Draco let out a long, ragged sigh, Harry let himself.
They raided the wine closet and watched Toy Story, socked feet tangled in one squashy chair, and Luna cried. Then she wanted to make popcorn garlands, and somehow there was popcorn in the cabinet.
“Oh, he’s dead,” the man said, sounding certain. “Foolish to think everyone will leave an easy-to-find body behind, isn’t it? Probably got fed to You-Know-Who’s snake or something.”
“No,” Harry tried, but it was too late: Draco had kicked his foot against the manor and pushed off, folding himself down into a stripe of speed.
Hermione sighed. “People can’t Floo call from the street, which is why you need a mobile phone for emergencies.”
“That’s something,” Ron said dubiously. He was laying on his back at Grimmauld, facing Harry upside-down through the flames. “Reckon you can leave yet? We’re going down the pub with everyone.”
Like anything between them, it became contentious immediately, hard and furious like a hardscrabble Quidditch match, both of them diving recklessly down through the sky after the same shining object.
Around him the bickering had moved on from mobiles onto the emotional labor involved in buying Arthur’s father’s day gift, which had clearly been kicking around the argument bank since June.
“Hey.” He dropped over the back of the couch, sliding down so that he bumped into Draco before settling into place. Draco turned his lingering smile over to him.
Harry nodded. “I think I could leave soon. It even played music when I was, uh, upset last night,” he offered.
That was enough mental complimenting of Malfoy - Harry kept talking, if only to process his own feelings. “It was awful. We - me and Hermione - we took Ron home. To the Burrow, that’s their house. It’s weird not to go too. Hermione and I always spend a part of the summer there. They always say I’m family, but it’s weird, with Ginny.”
With every surge of the magic that poured out of him, loose and sloppy with no wand but endless emotion, he remembered. He remembered the Muggle bodies that had bent and broken, the diary of Tom Riddle stashed between family photo albums upstairs. He thought of Luna down there, not crying, but humming, and about her laying on the couch, stringing popcorn garlands. He thought about Ollivander and finally Draco again, Draco trying to sleep as Voldemort sat below. He’d grown to pity Malfoy in the last few years, but now he thought maybe he respected him too. Harry had thought he’d known everything about growing up in a house of horrors. But what good were loving parent, if they led you into darkness? What was the love of a parent, if they died and left you to fend for yourself amidst every evil in the fucking world?
Now that he was alone, he set off to investigate. First the tapestry. He approached it carefully, pulling one corner as carefully as if it were a monster book of monsters. Nothing there. He checked the cupboards; nothing but stashes of cauldrons, jumbled sets of fireplace tools, a leather case filled with Quaffles whose spells had worn down.
It opened reluctantly. Harry raced upstairs, wand at the ready. His heart was thumping against his throat, the adrenaline rush of months past racing through his blood.
“Ready?” Draco was matching the smile Harry could feel on his own face. They hovered beside the wall of the house, facing each other.
“It’s not that stupid,” Harry argued, mostly out of habit this time. Hermione and Ron had returned with the Grangers a couple weeks back, and had stayed with them for a week before spending another week with the Weasleys. They were finally settling in at Grimmauld, though, and Hermione’s last few boxes had been brought over that morning.
Ron waved his hand at the teapot, which floated over to pour her another cuppa. “On-campus? You don’t mean she went with Plan C?”
“What’s next?” Draco asked, looking around. Someone brushed by him: Harry reached out and tugged Draco by the arm. They collided softly, bounced apart, and then Draco pressed more deliberately into him. Harry nudged back, and their elbows bumped, their hands tangling and separating in the ghost of an embrace.
“Wait, you’re moving to Hogsmeade? What about Grimmauld Place?” Harry brushed his hands off in his lap. Since when did his best friends plan their lives without him?
Ron and Hermione were arguing lightly as they packed up Hermione’s notes and books about the correct way to do so, the background squabbling that Harry could barely hear anymore. Draco had run upstairs to see if he could find a particular deed, and Harry was trying to slip up after him when Pansy caught him.
Draco looked sick — wan and pale and wilting, like some exotic plant that had been kept indoors and away from the sun. But Harry supposed ghosts looked like that.
Draco blinked at their surroundings. Harry had Side-Alonged him to the telephone booths outside Angel Station, and they were squashed in close. Behind Draco’s head, a red bus rattled down Islington High Street. He followed Harry onto the pavement, brushing against him without comment, then stopped to look around. Harry wondered how it looked to him, a pharmacy and a Pret and an HSBC. But all he asked was “where are we?”
“I bet that family tapestry would be a good place to put a screen instead,” Harry was musing, to Draco’s horror, when they reached the right stretch of homes. Grimmauld Place untucked itself from its neighbors and wrenched into view, popping up where nothing had been a few steps ago.
“So you wouldn’t say you were born to quibble?” he asked, and Neville laughed, but Luna cocked her head to the side.
Draco’s hands on him tightened, and Harry felt the power shifting and crackling between them as Draco leaned in to bite his collarbone, his grip on Harry becoming insistent. A blush was climbing up Harry’s throat alongside the press of Draco’s mouth: he had never been grabbed and pushed and ground on this way, and it did something satisfying to him that he would never have predicted.
Harry tried to look friendly. “Well if I want to sign up then I know where to find you. Thanks for coming by.”
She shook her head. “Even more of a reason not to go looking for him. You got his house, isn’t that good enough? Like, I’ll take a house, if people are handing them out.”
“Newspapers. We’ll find newspapers.” Draco was moving down each aisle with a speed that Harry had to hurry to keep up with. “Muggles have those, right?”
After dinner he went back to the library, looking for something to do. He found a wizarding phonograph and rifled through the ancient records stored underneath. It was mostly Mozart and goblin jazz, with one lone Celestina Warbeck hidden away, sending that same singing regret through Harry when he imagined Narcissa swaying to it.
Immediately Harry tensed, stale adrenaline picking up where it had left off in his body. A million possibilities sped through his mind as he went up the stairs, pulling his wand out without taking his eyes off what was above him as he climbed. He passed a book on the floor, and then another. A hole in the wall he hadn’t seen before.
“The house likes you,” Luna said, hours later, when they had decorated the hallway with garlands and eaten a quick stir-fry. “It’s giving you popcorn, and it didn’t move this room back after you changed things.”
“Just stay here,” Ron continued, as though Harry hadn’t argued. “Mate. Just go over there to work on the place or whatever — or hire professionals, honestly — and sleep here. This is your real house, come on. ”
“Salazar, no.” Draco’s nose wrinkled, and something satisfying spiked in Harry’s belly. “Their names are Valkoinen, Garuda, and Spalva. What on earth is a Betty White?”
. He’d had a cruel closet and some scraps. A temporary school where he fought and fought and died. A best mate’s place where he barely fit at the table, an inherited heap that hated him, nothing like
“That’s it, everyone out.” The Minister pointed to the door. “Weasley, Parkinson, write a report. Miss Granger, you may go with them. Savage and Williamson, you get out too. Make damn sure there’s a charge you can lay on the boy, as you should have done before hauling him in.”
“Oi, yeah!” Ron poked his head into the hall. “Get back in here, weirdos. Let me tell you what she said.”
Harry gave up and crouched down, meeting Draco where he was at on the floor. “I’m not going anywhere, Draco. If I even consider it, you’ll be the first to know. I promise.”
He’d shoved all the tables and chairs to one side, losing track of hours and days in the sweat-inducing labor. It felt good to use his muscles, to scrape priceless furniture across priceless floors. He scuffed the wood in one place and kicked a rug over it, not bothering with a Mending charm.
“Okay,” she said, reluctant, and gave him another hug. “Okay, bye then. If this is about having pets, Harry, you can always bring the birds to the garden at Grimmauld, you know.”
He didn’t know how to feel. Draco had put it all out there, laid his fear alongside the knowledge of Harry’s heart, and..what? Left it all to rot? Their conversation rolled heavy through his head, every remembered word making Harry hate himself a little bit more.
“I wouldn’t have believed it could get worse if I hadn’t tried myself,” Draco agreed, and gave the hovering tangles one last pat. “Now make some food please.”
Draco’s hand wiggled free, and he murmured a spell under his breath in the way that pureblood wizards had discrete little spells for everything, while Harry had to go looking for his wand. He launched himself up, head spinning and body screaming at the loss of contact. Now what?
Ginny snorted. There was dirt on her face, rubbed there from her wrist. He thought about wiping it away, about kissing her, but didn’t.
Harry frowned and quickened his pace, walking too fast now to appreciate the verdant grounds. A few lamps were definitely on upstairs — unless it was a trick of the light. He didn’t know the house well enough to swear either way.
“You’ll find out if he’s dead soon anyway,” Hermione assured him in the matter-of-fact way she had talked about school, peering into her pint glass. “What with the M- the Manor and all. Saves them a trial.”
“I just don’t feel the need to cheat.” Harry hefted the broom in his hand, weighing the urge to huck it at Malfoy. “Unlike some people.”
They hit a set of stairs, and Harry let Draco lead the way back up to the street. He hesitated, then went right, and Harry followed without complaint.
“You good?” she asked, and shifted Harry over to help, taking over the pan where he’d been babysitting a cooking roti. She flipped over the one that was sizzling into solidity, adjusted it, started forming another. Harry nodded and relaxed, though he hadn’t realized he was tense, the cool buzz of her magic familiar beside him.
A few desperate minutes of all-out war broke out, each of them scuffling for an upper ground that didn’t exist in the world of food fights. There was something incredibly satisfying about flinging a handful of sliced pepperoni right into Malfoy’s bright, stupid face, and an exhilaration in the way he had to duck Malfoy’s reach after that, in the sharp bank of pain that came when he slammed his elbow into the counter while evading.
“I have time.” Harry stirred, tasted again. The spice had cooled to the level he liked it, still hot but not hot-hot-hot. “I have nothing but time.”
Back on his belly, Harry sighed. Okay. So maybe the house wasn’t accepting him as its owner as easily as he had thought. He’d been living out of his boxes, anticipating that he’d be back at Grimmauld with Ron and Hermione in a matter of days. But if he left before mastering Malfoy Manor there was a real chance he could be locked out by its wards for good.
“You’ll squash them,” Draco hissed, and reached out to the ground where Harry had been about to kneel. There was nothing there, just a mass of leaves and vines, and then one stalk of green detached itself and climbed onto his pale fingers.
Harry had gone to bed early, exhausted by all the magic and sweat and catharsis. Somehow in the fixing of things, he’d forgotten about what was broken — who had just died, how
He couldn’t stand to sit still with his thoughts. He showered and dressed as quickly as possible before pausing by the stretch of wall in the bedroom where Draco seemed to appear and disappear the most.
“Guys?” He made it to the door, feeling a little uneasy at interjecting himself. But Ron looked up, eyes red, and opened his arms. Hermione watched as he climbed in, shifting herself so he could sit between them in the giant claw-footed tub. Water sloshed out onto the floor behind him, and he could feel the warmth of it soaking through his robes, then his sweater, then his shirt and jeans. The three of them sunk into each other in the way they always had, like when they were eleven years old and huddled together underneath the Invisibility Cloak. Hermione looked like she’d been crying, too, and Ron’s knuckles were raw.
The last time Harry had seen Draco, he’d been fleeing the battle with his parents. At the time Harry had been enraged. The Malfoys were cowards, he’d thought, all of them unwilling to stand and fight even for the Lord they claimed to love. Maybe he’d been staring after them angrily moments before the other Death Eater had killed Lucius — it couldn’t have been long after. In the clashing, confused timeline of that final day, everything tended to get mixed up in his head. Fighting. Dying. Returning. Voldemort, dead on the ground. Hagrid, weeping tears the size of marbles. Malfoy’s white-blond head, disappearing against the tides of that mass of evil.
“Well, everything’s fine, mate, no active Dark magic. I’d sage the place though. I’ll send some from mum’s garden, she harvests it at full moon.”
“I always wanted a pet growing up.” Harry settled on keeping his arms crossed. “I was so happy to have Hedwig over the summers.”
“Oh no.” Draco’s black shirt was twisted and stretched from Harry’s hand. It was getting dark outside now, twilight coloring everything differently than they had looked a few charmed hours ago. It was a colder light, matched by the cooling air, the ice cold flint of Draco’s most Malfoyesque expression. “It’s hilarious.”
His voice seemed croaky and thin, but relief poured through Harry suddenly, reviving him a little with something buttery-warm. “You’ve been here the whole time, haven’t you? Since you died.”
Draco nodded. “Far be it from me to cast aspersions on the three-headed dog you’ve always been, but you’re worse off for not being in the couple of the group. They have each other to lean on. I’m sure it’s nothing against you deliberately. My parents were the same way.”
“You don’t have to eat it,” Harry said mildly. Draco watched him set the cakes to baking, being good until there was an empty bowl to steal and stick his fingers in. “Put the kettle on, won’t you?” To his surprise, Draco actually licked his fingers clean and hopped down to obey.
Harry had to laugh, low, hunching down a bit to rest his elbows on his knees. He looked up at her, anchoring himself to the universe through her familiar know-it-all expression, as though she were going to take notes on what he said in order to ace whatever test came with it.
A little embarrassed now, but glad no one had caught his strip show-slash-tantrum, Harry gathered up his clothes and went up to take a bath.
“I could see a lot of what Voldemort did, by the end,” Harry admitted, ignoring Draco’s flinch at the name. It was hard to believe he’d recently walked the halls below them, holding court where they now watched Star Wars. “It’s why I did Occlumency with Snape, we thought he might have been able to see me.”
“I highly doubt you can.” Draco gave Harry a once-over, and the dismissive ice of his gaze convinced Harry that he was upset. “Do you have an eye for luxury? No. Can you help me price out my wardrobe? No. Would anyone believe you were selling your own clothing? No. Can you get me access to a Gringotts account? No. Ah.” He found a Sickle in the pocket of another jacket, this one shifting colors softly from green to blue.
“He’s out. We’re working to get his house back, and all that. Pansy’s in on it too. He might need character witnesses, actually, Luna.”
Harry tried not to laugh. After all, he’d been behind on childhood films, as well, hence the movie theater he’d made — to fulfill that childhood fantasy built on peeking into Dudley’s room at cartoons just out of reach. Plus purebloods were weirdly ignorant about Muggle things — and you didn’t get much more pureblooded than the Malfoys. Still, he had to bite his cheek before he could answer.
And they sat down together, Hermione gathering tea while Ron placed an army of leftovers in front of Harry. He loved them so much. Ron spun the story of Hannah’s casual question into a twenty-minute adventure, Hermione laughing at all the right parts, her hair bouncing against her head. Their laughter was everything to him, more precious than gold. They always accepted any shit he dumped on them, worrying for Harry at each step. He owed them the truth, but he wasn’t sure what that was yet. He thought about Draco’s pale face, saying
Harry couldn’t stop laughing, now that he’d been found out. Tears were leaking from the corners of his eyes as he wheezed for breath, even as Draco’s foot lashed out and found his shin under the table. “If you’re not… cheating… you’re not…. oh my god.” He kicked back, and then the board did get knocked over as they were drawn into an entirely immature battle.
“Come off it,” Harry whispered back. “The Aurors that came over this morning would have detected something.”
“Debatable,” he lied, and because he didn’t want to give her the space to list examples, he kept talking. “I’ll be out of there soon, anyway.”
“I’m the coolest,” Pansy informed him. “Ron may be a blithering Gryffindor, but he was right — he actually may be smarter without you.”
They camped out in front of the screen. Harry Accioed down a mattress and every pillow in the house, and they claimed different sides. A fluffy stack of pillows at the foot of the bed held Draco’s bottle and Harry’s empty glass, tipped on its side. A pair of statues  from the hallway had hopped in to watch, stone lion and unicorn alike curled up in front of a low-burning fire. It wasn’t anything like the bonfire that the fireplace had room for, but the overall effect was nice and cozy after being out on the roof.
“Oh Harry, no,” Hermione said, her faraway stare focusing back on him. Ron sagged a little behind her, relieved. “Please don’t get all wrapped up in following Draco Malfoy around again.”
, I’m so sorry.” He was too tired, to stunned by their proximity and the need to apologize to think of anything else to say. “I wouldn’t leave you, I don’t ever want to.”
There was a beat. Savage glanced down the hall, clearly expecting to be invited further in. Harry stayed quiet. He was ready to hear what they had come about, and wasn’t willing to let them stumble upon the two teacups on the counter.
“Looks like you’ve been brawling with Malfoy,” Ron added, popping in with what looked like an entire turkey leg in his hand. “Cor, do you ever wish that fucker was still alive just so you could punch him again?”
“Mm.” Draco seemed to be falling asleep now, his chin tucked into his chest as he blinked at the scenes of spacecraft shooting across the wall. “Mhm.” His voice had gone low and sleepy, and it sent a thrill through Harry that startled him.
Hermione and Molly were edging out of the kitchen now, both seeming to feel that they ought to give Ron and Harry space. Ron wheeled on them. “‘Mione! Stay and tell Harry how fucking stupid he’s being.”
“Draco?” He lit up the hallway with another wave of his wand, but nothing was illuminated beside the dusty old carpet and the faces in the paintings along the walls, horses and ancient Malfoys blinking in the new light.
“I get it,” he offered, and tried to smile. He thought he’d pulled it off, but Ginny’s face was sad.
“Hmm.” Hermione looked at him again, sideways. “And that’s what you want? To wait and see what happens?”
Draco shook his head, blond strands moving and then sticking to his cheek where a shine belied his sweat. “I hate potions.”
In an echo of their initial kiss, Draco tipped his head forward and caught Harry again. It was sweeter, slower, and Harry felt like a hundred years had passed in between now and the one they’d shared upon his return home.
been feeding them, come to that? The house was still hiding its mysteries, and Harry didn’t want to risk missing the chance to discover them. “What happens if I can’t get back in, anyway?”
“Coming!” Harry shouted, then turned back to Draco at the door and kissed him again, as quick as before. “I promise, it’s okay. I would have died without their help a hundred times.”
Harry felt slow and tired and stupid. He reached up and carefully began setting Draco’s hair back to rights, moving slowly. Draco bowed his head and shut his eyes. Their voices had gotten quieter as they’d gotten closer together, and the peace of the night emerged from the silent minutes between them.
Luna set her beer down on the counter and tilted her head to pay attention to Neville, and Harry crossed his arms tightly. Ron and Hermione had kicked up a fuss about Draco, but they had been worried about Harry mostly, and were already — as always — on his side. He didn’t think he could expect such grace from his other friends, let alone the rest of the wizarding world, and Neville’s answer seemed significant.
Harry hid his thoughtful frown in his cup. He was sick of not knowing the shape of his future. But Draco… Draco was suddenly, definitely where he wanted his future to start. It seemed too much to ask for, but if Hermione thought it was possible...“Am I really all that stubborn?”
“We talked about this, I’m very persuasive.” From now on? Harry’s heart hurt with fondness. He was still convinced that Draco would turn cold on him — truly cold, and not the prickly wariness he’d grown used to. But despite his ranting, Draco still let him get up and approach him, walking forward until he had his chest pressed up against Draco’s back, their reflections utterly unmatched in the mirror. It was becoming second nature to do this, to form himself against Draco’s body, to marvel at the fit.
The blue of a dream washed over him, the warmth of the blankets mingling with the yawning, ancient air between the lines of the floor and the arcs of the beams. Harry was hot, cold, floating, spinning.
He tried to school his thoughts into some semblance of order. As usual, Draco had him confused about how he felt and what he thought and what they were really fighting about. He was sorry, he was angry, he was upset, and he didn’t know who to aim it at. “I’m not saying I wasn’t. But we can’t hide forever. Eventually you have to make some kind of life, and I have to go back to mine.”
“That’s rotten luck, mate,” Ron said, coming back into view. “I guess I could pop round, then, as you’re staying.”
“I don’t want to be an Auror,” Harry said automatically, before parsing the rest of Draco’s statement. “Wait, that almost sounded like a compliment.”
Harry’s throat burned as the sweet taste of lemons turned back into firewhiskey in his mouth. He didn’t know what had made him say it, except that in the grand scheme of things, Draco had been as young as them. It just didn’t seem right not to acknowledge someone who had disappeared right under everyone’s nose and gone forever unburied.
Harry’s dreams were hazy and hallowed. A door opened where there wasn’t a door, but there was, because it was magic magic magic. He was floating, he was flying, he was tucked into a bed made up of the wings of sleeping griffins. There was a hand on his forehead again, like the night he had nightmares, but this time the hand was attached to an arm and a shoulder, a neck, a shadowy face. Something beautiful as a statue, only warmer and warm against him now.
But when he reached the flight with the bathroom, he could tell from down the hall that he wasn’t interrupting anything like the giggly bubbles he had assumed. Ron and Hermione were in the tub, alright, and together. But they hadn’t shut the door or even taken their clothes off. They were holding each other, clothes soaked through, like one had climbed in after the other in whatever explosion Harry had missed.
“I’m as happy as I can be right now, I think,” he assured her, knowing she’d understand that a hundred percent was still impossible. “But I love you for asking.”
“How?” Harry wondered when Draco had been replaced by Arthur Weasley, but he definitely hadn’t thought Arthur’s curiosity was this cute.
“God, no, what a horrible concept. Can you imagine the old magic that would soak into the water? Death soup, I imagine. Besides, if the day ever comes where I see your Weasley in just trunks and freckles, I’ll Avada myself.”
The awkward silence that ensued made Harry want to laugh, although he scrubbed his hands over the face and fought the urge. “Right. So. Thank you for coming over, and as you can see, Draco is alive.”
“What do you think?” he asked quietly, not wanting anyone to overhear as they passed. A family squeezed by them, and then they were alone again.
“I’m still a Malfoy. You can’t have forgotten.” Draco glared at him, his eyes alive with a healthy fury that made Harry oddly proud of him, even as he took two steps back, away from the warmth of the  fire. Draco’s voice got lower, quieter. “You said you wanted me to be free.”
“No small feat for any of us,” Hermione pointed out, and Draco swung his head over to her, his gaze going serious.
The shopkeeper had returned the list too, and when Harry scanned it now he saw one more thing on the bottom.
Finally, they disappeared between two hedges at the end of the garden, and Harry let all the breath he’d been holding out at once. “Draco?”
Draco just shut his eyes, letting Harry carefully put the strands back into place. Harry couldn’t stop watching his rough fingertips and bitten nails sliding through its softness, the way Draco’s ears and his closed eyelids looked like transparent, beautiful shells. “What do you want?”
“You can’t?” Harry glanced at him, but Draco was rubbing at something on the counter beside him, furiously avoiding his gaze. He understood why: months of living like a Muggle, like a rat in the wall, like a prisoner. Not even magic to keep warm, to feed himself, to wash his clothes. Draco seemed like he’d done alright, but it was hard to know how much he’d struggled to be this bedraggled version of his normal, impeccable self.
“You fucker!” He caught up, finally, and tugged Draco’s broom. Draco kicked backwards at him, the fucker, and it went on like that, cheap and dirty and dangerous.
“Where’d this come from? Are there secret hidey holes still?” he asked, taking the bottle to peer at the faded label. Draco actually laughed at him.
“No you won’t,” Harry challenged, slamming down the kettle he’d been refilling. Water splashed his face and arms as they glared at each other, and Draco’s mouth twitched just a bit.
“It’s only right,” Ginny agreed, detaching herself from Dean’s arm to come in and hug Hermione properly. She hugged Ron next, accepting the kiss he dropped onto her head, and then she hugged Harry. The quick scent he caught of her hair was shockingly familiar, but she just squeezed him and let go. “Time to de-Slytherin this house for good.”
“None taken,” Harry allowed, smiling a little despite the tenseness in his body. “But I think Draco and I…
