"Good." Draco traces his fingers over his face before flipping them over, Potter landing with a gasp. He grinned devilishly. "But do you have experience taking it?"
“We should get a coffee sometime, Potter.”
Draco leaned towards him, and Harry watched as he put his hand over his. “Last night…”
-----
He hadn’t moved, but he was flustered, and half-hard, and more than a little bit confused. He needed to calm down, cool down. He needed a cold shower. But how could he move? He didn’t want to wake Draco, deal with his questions. He could barely remember pulling him into bed, yet alone why he did it. Oh that’s right, he was too busy dreaming about kissing him. Fuck! What was he gonna do?
“Useless, yes. But how do you know Potter is straight?” Pansy asked.
Harry twisted his neck to look behind him, spotting the mass of buzzing and wings. He laughed. “Are you scared of bees, Draco?”
“Was a mistake.” Harry said quietly, trying to convince himself more than anything else.
"It's taller than I thought." Harry looked up at the Eiffel Tower, childlike awe on his face. Draco couldn't bring himself to look up at it, preferring to look at Harry instead. They stood beneath the enormous structure, surrounded by couples and young families. Harry looked perfect, dark curls and wide eyes; a lovely contrast against his tough guy beard.
“No problem, Harry.”
“You. You’ve changed.”
He stood up, offering a small wave. Why did he wave? Did he look stupid? He probably looked stupid. Malfoy smiled at him, and Harry’s heart jumped. Shit. He was so fucked. He needed to know whether this was a date before he fell completely into the pit of gay despair.
Harry nodded, looking around the pub. He knew not to argue with Hermione. She deserved an apology for all the horrible things Malfoy had said and done in school. But he knew Malfoy had changed. Or at least stopped being as much of a prick.
“I’m heading in now, anything I need to know?” Harry asked, pulling an apron over his head.
Harry turned to him thoughtfully. "No, I don't think so. I like feeling small. Makes a change."
Harry grimaced. No, he wouldn't have. He would have told her to fuck off.
“Well, I never claimed to be the best. I work with the owls rather than the customers, and one of them has become really unwell.” The darker man explained, crossing his arms over his chest.
Draco snorted and pushed him away. He pulled his toiletry bag out of his suitcase and headed to the bathroom. "I'm just gonna freshen up."
Later that afternoon, after a wonderfully nightmare-free nap, Harry meandered down Diagon Alley. Wrapped up in a scarf, with his nose covered against harassment, not many people recognised him. He spied a new addition to the shops, nestled at the end of the row, fresh green paint around the windows, and a sign reading Grotte aux Remèdes in navy blue. The window display sported a large arrangement of plants and a wooden coffee table scattered with dried herbs and potion bottles. A small dragon sat in the centre of the table, seemingly looking down at it’s horde of medicines. Warm orange light leaked through the glass in the door, and when Harry pushed it open, wind charms jingled above his head.
“Thanks, Harry.”
“No, no...Luna, um, sent me.” Potter dropped his gaze, fiddling with his scarf.
Draco looked up from where he had been studying the coffee stains on the table to find Harry watching him intensely, something flashing in his eyes that he couldn’t work out. "You haven't really given me the chance." The blond rebutted, frowning into his coffee. Since when had Potter ever shown any interest in their reconnection?
"What are we talking? Sickness?  A secret injury?" Rita gasped. "Did you spend time in an institution?" She whispered.
"Well, thank you for coming here to tell me this, Mr Potter."
“What do you reckon?” He murmured to Ron.
Potter did as he was told, pulling his fingers out as Draco stood up. He took the lube and spread it over his cock, his heart hammering as he realised what was about to happen. He was about to fuck Harry Potter.
The slytherin tried to smile back, but his mind was racing; so it came out more like a wince. “Edward is a metamorphmagus?”
That night, as Harry slept, he dreamed of Bill and Fleur’s wedding. Music poured around him, laughter flowed freely, smiles beamed on almost everyone’s faces.
“How the fuck did you get ma petite fille?” Malfoy exclaimed. Harry looked over to see Draco staring wide-eyed at the cat on his chest.
"I'll think about it."
Pansy eyed him up, an eyebrow raised. “Merlin, when is it not?” She sighed, grabbing two wine glasses from the cabinet. She kicked her heels off, curling up on the sofa as she held out the glasses for Draco to pour the drinks. He had owled her half an hour ago, unable to stop replaying the day in his head. Pansy had been his best friend since he could remember, and their families had often holidayed in France together. She would be able to talk some sense into him, he was sure.
The rage she had felt 6 years ago still boiled in her veins, this time accompanied by the justice she was about to deliver.
"I'm not, am I?" Ron asked, avoiding his gaze as he poured his beer into his glass.
“Messy ex?”
"Mm-hmm."
Draco climbed off his lap and pulled him up until they were both standing, kissing Potter again as he undid the buttons on his shorts. They fell to the floor and Draco palmed his cock through his boxers, feeling it harden further under his touch as Potter panted into his mouth.
“You can say it, Harry. You saw my meltdown.” The blond let go of his hand, his voice soft.
“Come on.” Harry looped his arm through the blond’s and tugged him down the street. They walked in silence for a minute, the darker man completely oblivious to Draco’s frantic thoughts. “Do you wanna stay at mine?”
The two men ordered their drinks, thanking the waitress. Harry’s stomach bubbled with nerves.
“Right, of course.”
"Oi!"
When the Medi Witches and Wizards arrived, they found Harry Potter sobbing over the lifeless body in his arms, covered in blood.
ENEMIES IN MUTUAL BENEFACTION: A HARRY POTTER EXCLUSIVE
Draco didn't know how much time had passed when he finally got up off the floor, not looking as he flushed the loo. He turned on the shower, stripping off and stepping under the water; allowing it to wash him of the makeup, the sick, the blood, the tears. He felt numb as he scrubbed his skin, not bothering to dry off before he climbed into bed and succumbing to the exhaustion.
Draco grabbed Potter's chin and made him look at him. "The past is the past, Potter. Focus on where we are right now."
Draco grinned and pulled him into a sweet, tender kiss. They broke apart after a moment, resting their foreheads together. “You taste like chocolate.” Draco giggled.
"Shut your mouth. You know nothing about me." Malfoy seethed, his pale skin was tinged red with anger, and the look he was giving Harry probably should have killed him on the spot.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I may not be as smart as you, Malfoy. But I’m not stupid.” He slid the coins across the counter as the cat gave his hand a lick.
“Alright, okay.” Harry looked over Draco’s shoulder to see students starting to pour out of the Great Hall. He grabbed his hand and gave it a squeeze. “Owl me the details.”
The two men leant in at the same time, their lips coming together gently, cautiously, as if each were afraid of scaring off the other. It was sweet and warm, full of memories and possibilities. It was just as it needed to be, just as it was always meant to be. It felt like new beginnings and nostalgia all at once. Their warm, wet bodies pressed together, Harry hummed contentedly into Draco’s mouth. It was perfect.
Draco held his hands up in surrender. "I didn't mean anything about it, oh Mr Saviour," his voice dropped with mockery.
Draco sat at his breakfast counter, a thoroughly chewed quill between his lips and a steaming mug of tea beside him. He stared at the parchment in front of him, his stomach twisting.
He smiled at Andy as she passed him a cup of tea. “How have you been?”
After taking a minute to cool down, trying to remind himself of all the reasons that punching a brick wall would be bad, Harry returned to the coffee shop and waited to collect the food to go. Malfoy had always had a talent for riling him up, and a flare for the dramatic. And yet; Harry still always found himself drawn to him in this uncontrollable way. Bloody posh git, he thought.
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy laughed. “Well, now I understand.”
He marched through the crowd, narrowly avoiding drinks in his determination. He approached the two steadily, coming up beside them and slinking his arm around Draco’s waist. The broad looked over at him, confused, as Harry pecked the blond's cheek. "Everything alright?"
“This better be life or death, Potter.” The blond pulled the glasses from his nose.
“Shut up.” Harry whined, turning to Ron and Hermione. “Thoughts?”
The slytherin took another sip of his scotch as he let his gaze drift around the room. The annual gala was held to raise money for orphaned wizard children, but many just used it as a way to show off their wealth by out-donating each other. At least the children would get something nice out of it, Draco thought. He stole another canapé from a waiter.
“Summery…” Harry muttered, mentally going through his wardrobe. He groaned “Can’t you guys come too?”
She had been his rock all these years, always drying his tears and straightening his robes after Lucius had struck him. She always knew what he was thinking, and was the only person in the world who cared for him.
The blond contemplated this for a moment. “What do you wish for?” He lifted his hand to his eyes, shading them from the sun. He took in the man before him, eyes cast with a far away look, freckles dancing in the sunlight. He was beautiful. And here he was, sat beside him, in a quiet garden in the gently aching sunlight. He wouldn’t need any muggle money. His wish had already come true.
Harry nodded, glad at having the decision made for him. He took a deep breath, willing himself to just say it. What's the worst that could happen?
Regardless of what his friends said, Harry couldn’t even look Malfoy in the eye. That didn’t mean that he didn’t watch him constantly, though. He spent the week staring at Malfoy’s back in classes, hallways, the Great Hall, and it certainly didn’t help that he now knew what lay under his clothes, the sharp edges of Malfoy’s body. With each day that passed, he was more and more sure of his feelings.
“What about us?” Harry’s voice seemed rather jarring in the gentle quiet of the room.
Draco feels as though his heart is going to explode. It really is quite rude how someone could be so fit and so cute at the same time.
He flooed to Andromeda’s doorstep, hoping Teddy could cheer him up a bit. He didn’t want the questions that would come from Ron and Hermione, and Andy was very good at keeping to herself. He rang the doorbell, and after several strangely long minutes, the middle Black sister opened the door.
"So, Harry Potter is gay…"
"What's your problem, Malfoy?" Ron spat back, standing up.
"Good Afternoon, Mr Malfoy. I hope you are well?"
"He didn't kill anyone!" Harry burst out, barely keeping his voice below a shout. "He didn't kill anyone. He even saved my life." He couldn't help himself from saying it. For some reason, Harry found himself caring about what people thought about Malfoy.
“Ah, Harry.” She offered him a smile. “What can I do for you?”
Harry lifted Teddy onto the sofa, pulling him out of his coat and shoes. “Sonus initium.” He muttered, letting the muggle music flow gently through the large room. The toddler let him, his eyes drooping. “Oh dear, are we ready for nap time?” Harry whispered to the little boy, brushing his salt and pepper hair out of his eyes. The contrasting strands almost suited him.
Why did Malfoy need to clear his head? It couldn't be… the same reason as Harry, surely?
“Let them.” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “At least my face would brighten the absolute drivel that they’re putting out these days.” He drawled.
Draco looked away, breaking the moment, and clearing his throat.
Now, as Draco holds the best thing in his life, his chest aches. “Baby, why are you crying?”
“Woah, I thought he became a recluse or something, You know, after he was so quiet in eighth year.” Ron added, shaking his head.
“Well, you certainly seem to be just as passionate about each other as before.” Pansy raised her eyebrows in a we-both-know-you’re-both-a-mess kind of way.
"How about the first day we met?"
Draco had made the seven other pieces last him a whole year, not wanting to waste them.
“Mate, where are you going?” Ron called after him.
Harry turned away from Dracos kisses, laughing. The slytherin had him pinned against the wall of the gryffindor dorms, and was now kissing any skin he could, since Harry’s lips were pulled up in a smile.
“Don’t bring my father into this, Potter.”
When he came in a few minutes later with the cups of tea, the tears were dry, and she smiled gratefully at him. "Do you wanna talk about it?"
“Holy shit! He knows how to apologize!” Potter threw his hands up in mock disbelief.
So he had noticed. "Yes," Draco says warmly, struggling to keep the affection out of his voice.
He led them slowly in time to the music, the two not doing much more than swaying. He'd been dancing at events like these since he was young, and was moderately skilled. Potter on the other hand, kept narrowly avoiding stepping on his feet. Their bodies were pressed tightly together and the heat gave Draco tingles all over, the warmth spreading all over his body and leaking slowly downwards towards his groin.
As they neared the gates, they opened, revealing Pansy Parkinson, champagne flute in hand. “Bienvenue (Welcome).” She greeted, seemingly unsurprised at their presence. “Let’s get you something to drink.”
As he left the portrait, Draco saw Harry turning the corner up ahead. The eighth year common room was located on the third floor, above the DADA classroom and library. There weren’t many students in this part of the castle, usually only eighth years or the occasional Ravenclaw wanting to speak to the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw.
“Good thing I’m staying then. No one will dare to hurt you if I’m here.” Harry gave him a small smile, thankful to have Malfoy back on his side. Merlin, he never thought he’d think that.
"I know I do. I'm trying to be better." Draco gently tugged at Harry’s hand, but it didn't move from where it was folded against his chest. "Try to be better with me, together."
Draco gave a small smile again, as if embarrassed, and Harry found he liked the unfamilair look on him. “I actually frequent muggle bars these days, if you can believe it.”
"Kiss me, Draco." More than the request itself, the vulnerable need in Potter's voice shocked him.
Barely a moment later, the doorbell rang. Deciding to let Kreacher deal with it, Harry continued fussing Lucy.
Well, he wasn't wrong. Draco was wearing long denim shorts, canvas shoes, and a white short sleeved button up with his shades tucked into the top. He felt weirdly free without his suits and robes, but he would never admit it.
“I’m making enchilada’s tonight mate. Sound good?” Ron’s voice carried to Harry from the kitchen as he kicked off his shoes. He was back around Hermione and Ron’s again tonight - he should really host the next meal. Their flat was one of Harry’s favourite places, decorated in blues and golds and filled with things that were just so them.
Rita squinted, pursing her lips tightly as she weighed her options. Finally, after a long moment, she put the quill down, pulling out a regular one. "Please continue." She said tightly.
------
“Help.”
A chorus of “To Draco.” Echoed around. Narcissa lowered her glass again. “And I would also like to thank Mr Potter for his help in garnering the well deserved attention to my son’s shop.” This time, the cheers were much lesser. It made such a change that Harry almost laughed. Cameras flashed from the crowd, but he pushed down the spike of anxiety in his stomach. This was too good of a moment to ruin.
As they reached the end of the year, Draco Malfoy could be seen pulling childish pranks on his friends - tipping water on their heads, ice cubes down their shirts, casting sticking charms on their shoes. Teachers would only half-heartedly reprimand him for talking in class. His fellow slytherin friends would throw insulting names at him, and he would throw more creative, more absurd ones back, and they would all laugh together. He was back to himself, posh and snarky, but he was happier, his shoulders lifted, his words no longer holding the malice they once did.
“I do.”
"Me neither." He whispered.
“No worries, hun. Good luck.”
“Okay.” He didn’t know what else to say.
It still amazed him how this shop could feel so much at home, perhaps even more so than his own apartment. La chambre cozy was where he could relax, his own private space, unseen by anyone except himself. It had a small kitchen in the back corner, and he had filled the rest of the space with a fraying green velvet loveseat, stained oak wood coffee table, one of Sylvia’s many beds and scratching posts, and a rather large pile of cushions and blankets. All of them had been an impulse buy from a muggle charity shop that Luna had dragged him into in search of ‘something filled with love’. He had been browsing wizard magazines for weeks in search of furniture, and could never find anything that felt right.
Most of Harry’s time was spent cleaning, poo picking, and feeding. Every few days Harry would test the younger owls by sending them out to another emporium the shop was partnered with thirty miles away. If they returned with the note signed, then they were ready. Owls used their own kind of magic, meaning that they could find someone even if their whereabouts were unknown. The magic had a wizard repellant, meaning that they couldn’t be tracked or followed.
He’d suddenly lost all of his Gryffindor cockiness, and would look away immediately when caught staring, his heart racing. Exactly one week after their meeting in the locker room, Malfoy pulled him aside after class, into the same alcove that Harry had pinned him in a few weeks ago. He had him up against the wall, a hand on either side of his head.
“Just wear a button up shirt and jeans, always works for me.” Ron shrugged, looking at Hermione for approval.
"Yes! It's like a bloody miracle - I know you said the potion was relatively easy, but I didn't quite believe you until now." Harry chuckled.
Potter smirked. “Are you speaking from personal experience, Malfoy?”
"Oi, watch out. She's my best mate."
“And Hagrid doesn’t even know what to do?”
The waitress walked off and Draco sat down, watching as Pansy thoroughly surveyed the room.
Draco chuckled and leant his forehead against Harry's. "Shut up and let me fuck you."
His nights were filled with Malfoy too, dreams of arguments and steam filled showers, soft touches and creamy skin. He felt utterly fucked.
Potter let out a startled shriek and spun around, clutching his chest. Draco had never laughed so hard. "The saviour of the wizarding world folks, acclaimed war veteran," he said between gasps.
“My house is only around the corner, do you want to come in for a drink?” Thank Merlin for Gryffindor bravery.
He reached into a cabinet and pulled out some treats. The rustling was all that was needed for his gorgeous black owl to swoop in from Merlin knows where. She landed on his shoulder and nudged his ear. He reached up and fed her a treat.
“Not looking like that, you can’t.”
"Give me your wallet, Malfoy."
"Draco?"
Harry walked through the lounge and into the kitchen, giving Hermione a hug. “Sounds great.”
"True. But I shouldn’t have to come knocking on your door with a bouquet of flowers in order for you to talk to me." The darker man's eyebrows knitted together and Draco’s stomach dropped. It almost sounded as if he missed him. That couldn’t be right. After all, when had they ever been close?
“I know you won’t believe me, but it really isn’t your fault. No one could have done better.” Draco said quietly, firmly.
"No! I mean, um, no, I'd love to.” They smile at each other.
He looked away with a gulp. “Nothing good.”
"Hermione got me the shirt, as a Christmas present," he pointed down at his chest. "We have matching ones," he chuckled.
“Don’t go losing them.”
Maybe it was the excitement? Harry nodded to himself as he walked down the street, his mind racing. Yes, that must be it.
Git. A term Harry had long associated with a certain blonde Slytherin. Ginormous Irritating Twat, as one could interpret. Pillock, if one were so inclined. Pompous, almost always. Posh, indubitably. Stuck up his own arse, without a doubt.
“I know. Thank you.” Just then, the doorbell rang. The two of them looked over, and Draco put Teddy down.  “I’ll see you later.” He kissed his aunt on the cheek and ruffled Teddy’s hair. “Au revoir, nounours (Goodbye, teddy bear).” He didn’t want to intrude too long, and his heart was already threatening to beat out of his chest. He offered a wave before apparating away.
“Master, I have brought your tea, along with a second pot and cup in case Mr Malfoy hopes to enjoy some.” Kreacher said, bowing low to Malfoy as he walked in with the tray.
“Okay, I didn’t send it to Blaise.”
“Look, Potter. We don’t have to make this bigger than it needs to be. Let’s just agree to forget about it.”
"I just meant-" Harry started, trying to back track.
“What do you remember of last night, love?”
Draco laughed and smacked her with a pillow. "Says you! You've got mascara all over your face!"
Harry could’ve sworn his heart stopped for a moment. He didn’t know what would happen if he kissed Draco, what would happen to their friendship. Hell, he didn’t even know where all these new feelings had come from. All he knew was that it felt right. And if he wanted this, Draco was giving him the opportunity to take it.
"Sorry I'm late!" Harry panted, running over to Luna. They had agreed to meet outside her and Ginny's flat before the party.
Pansy smiled and grabbed his hand, pulling him back down onto the sofa. She lay her head on his lap, and his fingers immediately began braiding her hair. She sighed.
“Oh Merlin, Pansy. Please tell me you burnt it. Please, Please.”
"Exactly!" Ron slammed his glass on the table. "This man. This man, Hermione. He gets me."
"Well if you want to get technical, I'm queer." They were both quiet for a moment.
Draco’s eyes widened, the minute movement the only break in his perfectly schooled stance. He watched Potter walk into the ballroom, as did everyone else, the whole room pausing for a moment to take in the Auror’s entrance. He was dressed well, the deep blue velvet blazer fitted perfectly to his torso, accompanied by matching black shirt and trousers. He looked incredible, as he always did in Draco’s opinion, a little nervous too, but his Gryffindor confidence shone through. Potter smiled politely at the waiter and took a flute of champagne off of the offered tray.
"No, it's alright. I'll be done in a minute."
Potter laughed and dropped his ice cream, wrapping his hands around Draco's wrists. Draco tried to pull away but Potter just tightened his grip, and really, his shorts shouldn't be this tight. He stopped struggling and as Potter was about to say something, he pushed him back, knocking the two over with Draco sprawled across him. Potter kept his grip and leaned up to whisper in his ear. "You're dead, Malfoy."
“Okay.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why are you really here?” Harry asked, though he was sure he already knew the answer.
“Yes?”
“Pardon?”
Harry laughed again. “Was I really that bad?”
“I’d love to, Draco, I really would. It’s just…” She paused, looking uncharacteristically nervous. “I mean, I was drunk too.”
“That’s good.” Draco raised his eyebrow at him, waiting for him to continue.
“You never elaborated the other day, about what you meant when you spoke about not being perfect. You were very angry about it.” Draco explained, crossing his ankles. His knuckles were a tight white.
“Yes, master.” Kreacher’s voice called out from the corner. Harry slipped on his shoes and coat.
“Friends OK?”
The Slytherin’s jaw tensed.  “If you came here to make fun of my cat naming skills, Potter, I do have more important things to attend to.”
A lot of my feelings are unnecessary, some unscrupulous, some unwanted, unfounded, but most of them unreturned. For when have you ever looked into my eyes the way I do yours? When have you lain in the dark, retracing our encounters? Or remembering the colour of your eyes, or the pattern of your freckles, or the way you thin your lips in rage, or lick them with anxiety or when, perhaps, have you thought of me at all? Outside of your obligation to that is? Your obligation to hate me, despise me, distrust me. Please tell me that’s what it is; an obligation. Or at least tell me that you don’t anymore, don’t resent me, loathe me. That’s what I need to believe.
“My thoughts exactly.”
Harry cursed under his breath as he crumpled the piece of parchment into a ball. It should be simple, right? But it wasn’t.
Harry emerged from the toilets, wiping his damp hands on his jeans. The music thumped loudly around him, shaking the floor as the strobe lights added to the disorientating, heady vibe of the club. He searched the mass of bodies for the last of his friends standing. Hermione, Ron, and Pansy had all retired for the night. Or should he say morning?
"A new potion? From St Mungo’s? A Harry Potter exclusive to help repay you?" The witch actually leaned forward in her seat.
But also you may cry oops
The gryffindor bristled, shooting him an annoyed look. “Don’t start with that, Malfoy. Just let me say my piece.” Draco held his hands up in surrender. “The owl’s magic has gone all loopy, and has been affecting other nearby owls’ ability to fly. I was wondering if perhaps a potion could help, as even Hagrid doesn’t know what to do.”
Draco offered him a polite smile. “It’s quite alright.”
"Why does everything have to be a drama with you?” Harry balled his hands into fists, nearly shaking with the urge to go up to the other man and shake him, or better yet, slap him round the face. “Surely you don't need anymore attention, you got enough of that when you were younger, tugging at Daddy's sleeve constantly." Harry bit back, letting his anger take control of his words. It felt good to do this again, to argue. This was the strongest, rawrest emotion he’d felt in fuck knows how long.
Harry turned and locked eyes with Nagini, not ten feet away. The snake squinted at him, almost mockingly, rising to its full height.
Draco nodded. "The one with the freckles?"
Potter huffed, crossing his arms. He couldn’t look Malfoy in the eye, couldn’t hide how he felt to be forgotten, no, hidden, purposely missed out of his boyfriend’s life.
Narcissa gave a small smile at that. “Right, well, I’ll let you continue with your day.” She kissed Draco on the cheek again. “Remember to write to me.”
“Of course.”
Draco let out a breath he didn't realise he'd been holding. Thank Merlin for Harry being impulsive. Harry closed the distance and cupped Draco's cheeks, giving him a sweet kiss. "Let me go pack."
Harry hiccups, wiping his nose on the back of his hand as he looks up at Draco. “I’m sorry.”
He didn't even have a good reason, he knew full well that the two had broken up not long after the war, and now Luna was dating Weasley. Their monthly catch-ups were one of his favourite things, and a very useful source of information on the Golden Trio. Draco was very fond of Luna, and when she had spoken for him at his trial to reveal how he had snuck her food and checked on her whilst she was being held captive at the Manor, their friendship had only bloomed further. She had often asked him along to evenings with them all, but he had assured her that he wanted nothing of the inevitable distrust and awkward interactions that would ensue.
"As if you've never been a condescending prick before," he chuckled and clasped Draco on the shoulder. "Come on, pick up your drink. Let's have a walk."
The toddler didn't respond, his gaze fixed on a barking dog over the slytherin's shoulder.
“Malfoy?” Harry furrowed his brows, taking in the sight of Draco Malfoy in a heavily stained apron, standing behind the counter as he dropped several coins from his hand into the till. He could see that he was wearing a grey button up shirt and trousers with his sleeves rolled up. Malfoy looked relaxed, strands of his white blond hair slipping from around his glasses to frame his face.
"Fucking hell." Draco whispered, realising his mistake a moment too late.
“What did you do to his hair?!” Harry asked, eyes wide in alarm. Surely it was bad to bleach a toddler’s hair?
“Yes.” Potter straightened up, giving Draco a look up and down. “See you around, Malfoy.”
“That you say you love me back, you oaf.”
“What are you doing?” Draco hissed.
Harry read, and re-read the letter at least five times, barely even tasting his coffee. Was it true? Did Malfoy really care for him? He couldn’t deny that the slytherin had been his thoughts since the end of their eighth year, but to think he had been in his? That was insane, unbelievable. And yet, here he sat, holding the letter.
The blond had to stop himself from rolling his eyes at her dramatic words. “Indeed.” They had both bumped into Potter at work before, so it wasn’t as if he’d ever disappeared. The Gryffindor was simply more out of the spotlight these days. Draco flicked his eyes back to him. He had already been swarmed by nosy housewives and their adoring daughters. Poor bastard.
"She’s got a point." Potter raised his glass towards her.
"To the future."
“You haven’t, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that.” Harry could feel his resolve melting already at the sight of Draco’s trembling mouth.
“Yeah.” Pansy picked up her own mug. “I’m glad you’re awake though.”
He gave Potter a slow look up and down, his cool facade both a protective strategy and a way to mess with the poor man. Who said he wasn’t allowed some fun? “A thank you?”
“What has happened to you?” Harry shook his head jokingly. “Where’s the shy boy I grew up with?”
“I love you, Draco Malfoy.”
“Was it Luna in disguise?” Ron interrupted, snickering as he cooked the chicken.
Dracl turned to his father and held out the package. "Father?" Lucius simply sniffed in response and turned back to his paper.
"How have you been keeping? Apart from your nightmares getting better?" Malfoy started, trying to work out how to talk like a normal person, when in fact he was sitting across from his former enemy, which was anything but a normal encounter.
“Harry.” Dream-Draco mumbled against his lips. The Gryffindor took it as an invitation, diving right back in, pulling him as close as he could.
“Then it’s settled.” Malfoy said, motioning for Harry to take the lead.
“Merlin’s tits!” Draco’s hand flew to his hair, running them through nervously as he began pacing. “Merlin’s fucking tits!”
How about Galvin La Chapelle at 7pm tomorrow? It’s a muggle restaurant, but I think it's right up your street.
Neville’s cheeks bloomed red, taking in the sight of all of his friends' faces staring at him. “Umm…”
Harry’s deep green eyes search Draco’s grey ones with earnest. “You really love me?”
Draco looked up at him from where he had been watching his latte swirl around his cup. “If you’d like it to be.”
The pale boy took a steadying breath. “I know I shouldn’t care what she thinks, because you make me happy, but I do.” Deep breath. “It’s not that I’m ashamed of you, Harry. I’m just scared. She doesn’t know that I’m gay. I’m a Malfoy, I have to carry on my family line.”
Malfoy tilted his head, something Harry was starting to notice he did more and more. "To clear your head?" He looked back towards the shower. "That's why I'm here."
Draco took his seat quietly. "You’ve studied the blood samples?"
Harry nodded, taking a swig of his drink. “Yeah, it’s kinda crazy actually. She told me to try this potion from the new shop on Diagon Alley. And you’ll never guess who owns it-”
Potter fumbled with Draco's buttons, practically ripping them off as he tore away his shirt. His hands were so hot on Draco's skin, blazing a trail along his torso. Draco felt his fingers graze over the scars on his chest before Potter pulled away. He looked down at the scars under his hands and cursed.
He scooped the money up. “Is that everything?”
“No, uh-” Draco cleared his throat. “It’s okay.” He brushed his hands through his hair, gesturing for Harry to come over to the counter. “It really worked?”
“So you really haven’t noticed?” Andy said as she returned, passing him his tea.
-------
"My, my. Such amorous flirtation. One would think you'd been doing this for say, a few weeks now." Pansy smiled devilishly. "Or at least that's what I told Balveer when he asked."
“How did you get my address?” Harry asked, finally relenting and sitting up. He eyed Draco with distrust, but could hear Lucy's purrs from across the room.
“And you don’t need to be so up-your-own-arse.”
“Of course not! You’re so good with him, Harry.” She smiled down at him. “Either way, you make up for it by bringing random sandwiches.” She joked, raising the paper package at him.
Pansy nudged his leg with her glass. “What’s up?”
Pansy leant on the stone archway to the water garden, sipping her champagne, Luna next to her, both watching with smiles on their faces.
“Don’t try and be coy.” He said, leaning in closer. They sat at the dimly lit bar, the golden boy-turned-man and his unwanted admirer - his much-bigger admirer. He was a muggle, in a muggle bar, unknowing of Harry’s fame, just simply looking for a hookup.
Draco lifted himself onto his hands, his glasses falling off of his nose and landing beside Potter's head with a clatter. The two men looked at each other, green eyes blazing into grey ones as they caught their breath. Draco's heart hammered in his ears, the heat radiating off of Harry only adding to the blush in his cheeks and making him want to press his chest against the other man’s. Potter looked at him with wide eyes, mirroring his own flustered expression.
"Oui, I should think so." She huffed at him, turning and walking back out of the room.
“What the fuck is going on, Malfoy? Why the sudden change?”
Malfoy’s living room was modern and chic, all greys and blacks with forest green accents. It had dark wash wooden flooring, with a black wooden bookshelf, cabinets and matching coffee table, a forest green rug underneath the latter, the main portion of the room filled with a plush grey corner sofa overhung by a dazzling silver chandelier. A large picture of a woodland hung over the fireplace, and in the far corner stood a tall forest green lamp, casting a warm light across the room; which had been sitting empty all evening, the tall Slytherin owner only occasionally pacing through on his way to the kitchen, biting his nails. Suddenly, Pansy Parkinson appeared in the fireplace with a roar of the flames, still in her fitted suit from her day at work, eyes wide, handbag clutched tight in hand. Sylvia padded into the room, offering her a meow in greeting.
“I’m not saying we sit him down and tell him he’s gay, Granger.” Pansy flicked her eyes over to Lovegood, who was staring dreamily out the window at the rainbow. “All I’m saying is that we encourage him to figure it out himself. And if, at the same time, my ridiculous best friend finally plucks up the courage to confess his feelings, then all the better.”
As he spoke, the other ministry employees, many of them senior aurors, turned to watch the pair with interest.
“We argued and he stormed off. Thats one. Then I followed him home and we talked it out. That’s a half.” He explained.
Here was his enemy, topless and warm and kind, and Harry just couldn't make sense of it all. His rapid heart, the butterflies in his stomach, the utter want he felt to touch Malfoy. He hadn’t felt this way since, well, since he kissed Cho. His face was hot, and he was beyond confused and… Oh Merlin. Was Ginny right?
"True. But that doesn't mean I don't care." Draco said, recalling the nights in eighth year when he had come down to the common room to find Potter curled up on the sofa. After the first few times, Draco had begun draping a blanket over him. He wonders if Potter knows that it was him.
"Oh?"
Finally, after a minute or two, his gaze landed on a flash of white-silver hair pressed against the wall in the far corner. A broad figure loomed over Draco, speaking into his ear as the Slytherin locked eyes with Harry, flashing them wide in a helpless manner. Harry gritted his teeth, peeved at the amount of self-entitled twats that had ground their desperate bodies against his unwilling friend. Couldn't they take a hint?
Harry stood up, chasing after him and wrestling him to the ground as Sirius screamed in delight. "He's down! Come and get him!"
"That's all. Merci, Potter." Draco tried his best at a genuine smile, but it came out awkward. It was hard when he was most practiced at polite indifference or a mocking smirk.
Harry growled, turning away. Why did Malfoy always have to take the piss? He stormed off down the hallway, determined to find his friends.
Draco scowled at her. “More often than you think.” Maybe he was being a little bit childish, but he couldn’t go around hoping Potter was gay. Even if he was, why in Merlin’s name would he be interested in him? No, hope was not an option. He would only end up being hurt.
Harry snorted, looking around until he spotted Hermione talking to Lupin. Ron joined them, and Harry made his way over. “Your brothers are trying their best with a couple of Beauxbatons' girls.” He chuckled.
“And wake the beast? No, thank you.” She motioned towards where a mug of steaming tea sat under a stasis charm. “Cuppa?”
“For what was right? If I had been better, they wouldn’t have had to die at all!” Harry sniffed. “You said it yourself, you didn't know them, Malfoy." He stood up, crossing his arms as tears began to fall. "You don't understand.” He sneered. “You were on the other side!"
“Malfoy-” Potter murmured, his eyes searching Draco’s face. The paler man sucked in a breath, pulling away, but Harry grabbed his wrists. “Draco, I -”
-----
“Oh, okay.” Harry said, unsure of what to say.
-----
"Obvious?! I only just realised! How in Merlin’s name did you know?" Harry looked between the two, aghast.
“Saving you.” Potter whispered back. “That was him, right? Your ex?”
“Teaching suits you.”
She could still remember the day they died, the way tears had brimmed in her family housekeeper's eyes as she asked her to sit down. At 12 years old she had known what that look meant; her parents would not return home ever again. She swallowed thickly.
"I felt what I had to say could help a lot of people."  He watched as she retrieved the quill with a quiet "ah-hah!"
What the actual fuck? Firstly, this was Potter. He hated him, or at least only politely tolerated him, right? And even if he didn't despise him, since when was Potter gay?! Or bisexual, or just interested in men. Or interested in him?!
You would be hard pressed to find a wizard or witch alive who hadn’t heard of Harry James Potter, or how he had survived The Dark Lord at only a year old. It is nearly two years now since he vanquished Lord Voldemort once and for all, and in the time since has completed his NEWTs - achieving an Outstanding in Defence Against the Dark Arts, as well as Exceeding Expectations in Potions and Charms and Acceptable in Transfiguration and Care of Magical Creatures - and has all but disappeared from society. This comes as a shock to all of us that are close to him, as he has always been such a bright face in a gloomy crowd.
Draco’s eyes lit up, before drawing together again. “I’m not in the mood for jokes, Potter.”
“Ladies.” They greeted in unison.
"I must say, your call was most unexpected." She said, one of her blonde curls falling into her face. Her hair was just a little more unkempt than Harry remembered, her magenta robes just a little bit more faded, her under eyes just a little bit darker. He knew many people were refusing interviews with her after the war, and he had even heard that Xenophilius had banned her from the Quibbler after an especially volatile argument between the two of them. It all seemed to be taking its toll.
“With your studies, yes, I know.” She cleared her throat. “How are you keeping otherwise?”
A minute or so passed before Ginny came down the stairs, followed by Luna. "Harry?"
“Hawwy!” He said.
“Ah, Harry. Thank Merlin you’re here.” Paeson marched up to him, grabbing his arm and dragging him through to the back. He had received an owl from her not ten minutes ago, asking if he could come to the emporium ASAP.
Draco didn’t know whether to laugh or scowl. Who was the dramatic one now? “Don’t interrupt me. I was just trying to-”
He had never said it so explicitly before, so bluntly. But the thoughts had been plaguing him for so long, it should have been a relief to finally let them out. All he felt was anger.
“What? Your aunt and uncle?” Draco’s face had contorted in horror. He had known that they had been nasty, but hadn’t realised that they had been cruel too.
Draco Malfoy stood before her, a polite smile etched on his face. Now a young man, he held himself well, with a palpable aura of sophistication. The apothecary knew otherwise of course, having handmade his anxiety medication for the past few months.
Draco suddenly screamed as a singular bee strayed from the group, moving a whole half a foot closer. He pulled on Harry’s trousers tighter, and the Gryffindor stumbled, pulled dangerously close. He grabbed Draco’s shoulders for stability but since Draco was pulling so tightly, it just pushed them both over. They fell into the fountain, water cascading over them, Harry landing on top, his knee between the Slytherin’s legs. They spluttered and splashed, and Potter instinctively grabbed the front of the other man’s shirt to pull him above the water, sitting back on his ankles.
The Gryffindor wove through the tables to the back corner, where he dropped his jacket in an empty chair at a table for two. Draco followed suit, sitting opposite him and plucking up the menu. The whole place was decorated in rustic pastels, and fairy lights were strung across the walls, offering an intimate atmosphere. Draco put on his reading glasses. The menu offered the standard offerings; sandwiches, paninis, jacket potatoes, cold drinks and hot beverages.
“Oh, excuse me for wanting a bit of peace and quiet from your yapping this year so I can focus on my NEWTs.” Draco replied with just as much venom.
Harry looked over to see the witch trying not to intrude as she waited to be served. “Right, of course. Thanks again, Malfoy.” He nodded, trying to gain composure as he strode out of the shop.
“You could be a bit more enthusiastic.” Harry mock-pouted.
Prologue
"I'm… I'm… sorry." Draco's voice was cut off with a gurgling noise as more blood poured from his mouth.
"Yeah but that's different, Malfoy. I did that to you!" Draco smacked him lightly on the back of the head and held up his left arm.
The blond rolled his eyes, dismissing the paper into the bin. Was there really nothing better to be published? Who cared about bloody Potter and him doing fuck-all? Draco certainly didn’t. Or at least that’s what he repeated to himself as he pushed through the door to the stockroom. It was nearing nine months since he had finished his education, and he’d heard not a peep from the golden trio outside of his friend’s gossip. And that was how he liked it. Peaceful, no anxiety about past misdeeds (outside of his 24/7 inner turmoil), no awkward conversations. No bloody perfect, golden, pretty-boy Potter taking up any of his time, or any of his thoughts. Well, not as many of them anyway. No, he was past his school boy crush, and the petulant behaviour that he (without-meaning-to) brought with it. He would waste no more time thinking about someone who was no longer part of his life.
The slytherin crouched instinctively, cursing at himself for being so jumpy. Fate was a cruel bastard. It was like it could read his mind.
“You will?” Draco’s voice was small.
"And I have the mark of the guy who did that," he traced his fingers over Potter's scar again, "to you."
“How can you see someone half a time?”
“At Hogwarts?!” The blond slammed his cup down on the coffee table, standing over his friend.
“Can’t you see out the window?” Luna asked, quirking her head before turning around to point outside. There, a small queue of about eight or nine people was forming, many of the witches and wizards clutching a newspaper.
{This chapter contains explicit smut, but also some key things. I have highlighted the beginning and end of the explicit content with this >>> _-_-_-_ -_-_-_-_}
-Dear Mr Potter,
“It doesn’t matter. I didn’t really fancy him anyway.” The blond took in Harry’s expression. “I was doing it as a favour to Pansy, that’s all Potter.”
The two men headed out of the Great Hall together. Harry was so distracted he almost didn’t recognise the head of white blond hair standing just outside the doors.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, taking a step towards him.
“Shut up. Potter’s not gay. And he’s definitely not gay for moi.” Draco scowled at Sylvia as she purred in Pansy’s lap. Bloody two-faced cat.
"Those bastards!" Draco stood up in anger. "Tell me who they are Pansy, and I'll make them regret ever hurting you."
Harry stared, gobsmacked, at the real Draco Malfoy. “Umm…”
“My thoughts exactly.” Draco smiled, and they looked at each other for a moment, before bursting out laughing.
"Do you want to eat?"
"That is a load of bollocks and you know it! You're a flirty drunk and a stupidly good dancer. Plus, who else would I go with?" She batted her eyelashes at him. Draco snorted.
"Why not?"
"Dating?" Harry asked, eyes wide.
Draco smoothed his jacket down, following the mass of curls into the crowds of the London lunch hour. They walked for a few minutes before Potter looked back, signalling for him to follow him down an alley. The blond frowned, slightly perturbed at following his ex-enemy down a small, secluded spot, but his nervous curiosity was soon sated by Potter opening a baby blue door ahead of them. Behind him, Draco could see a counter with cakes and coffee cups, and when he stepped into the small café, the smell of freshly brewed coffee greeted him pleasantly.
“That wouldn’t solve anything.” Harry’s voice is muffled against his chest.
-------
Harry did a double take, squinting at the cat as he undid his scarf. It looked identical to Lucy, apart from it’s snowy fur being interrupted by a grey patch around it’s left eye. He could almost convince himself that Lucy had managed to get herself covered in dust, except for the fact that the cat was watching him with such boredom. Had it been his feline, she would surely have ran right over to him.
"What about?"
Snake-Draco raised his head higher to look at Draco better. “He’s not even as good looking as me.”
"Good." Harry whispered back, before leaning close to his ear. "Come and fuck me then."
Draco Malfoy spun around, meeting Harry’s gaze with a look he couldn’t decipher.
He grabbed a box of tissues and pushed it towards her, kissing the top of her head as he got up to make some tea. He didn't want to make her talk if she didn't want to.
“I thought that was the new sexy.” He joked.
"Fuck." Draco pulled his hands away, running them through his hair. "Just forget I said anything, okay?" He looked around for his bag, finding it a few feet away, and picking it up. "We should get to class."
“Go fuck yourself, Malfoy. I knew you were a selfish bastard, but I didn’t know you could be this horrific.” As Harry spat the words, the candles in the shop all blew out at once. His magic coursed around him, his hands in fists as he stormed from the shop.
He placed some treats on his desk next to his parchment and she happily hopped over to eat them.
Two weeks. Nine days. Five days left. An estimate. His head was throbbing and his lungs ached, and he finally stopped, collapsing against a wall. He wanted to cry, he wanted to scream, he wanted to… Fuck knows what.
"I thought you already were-" Draco cut him off with a hard thrust and they both moaned. His pace quickened and became more erratic.
“Potter,” Draco called out. “I’ll meet you at yours.”
“Well I certainly feel ancient with how quickly this one is growing.” She nodded at Teddy. “When are you at work?”
“Yes, Mother.”
“Shit. Sorry, Malfoy.”
“No!” Harry pulled at one of the perfect inky ringlets. “I just assumed someone in the family had black hair. That maybe he got it from your side.” Harry ran his hands through the soft curls on Teddy’s head.
“That won’t be needed, Potter.” Draco cleared his throat, looking Harry in the eyes, trying and failing to quash the waves of anxiety in his stomach. He had something to ask.  "However, I would be immensely grateful if you would do me a favour.”
Draco watched the green flames disappear and sighed, reaching down to untie his laces. All of a sudden, his stomach jolted. Hand over his mouth, he rushed to the toilet, falling to his knees as he threw up into the bowl. It seemed to never end, and his stomach ached as he dry heaved over and over. He leant his head on his arms, breathing heavily as snot ran down his face. He wiped his mouth on the back of his hand and did a double take at the blood smeared on it. He looked into the bowl and saw much of the same.
“Merlin. Are we really bringing out the dad jokes?” Draco whines, shaking his head in mock pain. Harry reaches up, placing a hand on his cheek, and Draco opens his eyes to the touch.
Draco shook his head, shaking his hips suggestively. "I am not! These eyes," he pointed to his face, "and this body," he trailed his hand down his chest, "have seen things every wizard and witch can only dream of." He nodded proudly to himself.
Draco took a large swig of his wine, swilling it around his mouth as he thought over Pansy’s idea. The two had already finished their second bottle and were now well into their third. The blond was laying languidly on his best friend's sofa, the raven-haired witch in question haphazardly strewn across the neighbouring armchair.
That’s what she had said, and even now, Draco didn’t understand what she meant. Either way, they had become the most unlikely of friends. They still met frequently to hang out.
"Of course." Draco whispered.
The restaurant opens up to reveal high ceilings and white stone walls, with draping fabrics and low lighting. It's reasonably quiet, and the waitress shows them to a corner table with a large potted plant, giving the illusion of being alone. The whole atmosphere is intimate and luxurious, and Draco has to admit he is impressed.
Draco chuckled. “A bit presumptuous, Potter.” He said sarcastically.
Pansy sighed and rubbed her face. "Remember how I told you that I was seeing that girl?"
Harry Potter with dark hollows under his eyes, standing to speak for Draco at his trial. The awkward thank you, Potter, afterwards, as the two boys took it in turns to briefly glance at each other before looking away.
"Oh fuck, indeed." Malfoy hissed, narrowing his eyes. "Shall I read you an extract, Monsieur Potter?" His voice dripping with sarcasm.
“So feisty, mon Jolie garçon (pretty boy).” Draco murmured, narrowing his eyes at him. Bloody Potter, always so moody around him.
“This is about Harry and Draco, isn’t it?” Hermione sighed. “Ron and I had agreed not to get involved, to let Harry figure it out himself.”
"Listen to her, Harry! You should've died! If you did, none of this would've happened!"
“Nothing other than the usual, stupid crap he usually pulls-”
“Mmm, but soon you’re gonna be more coffee and wideye potion than you are man.” She raised her eyebrows at him as she licked her lips.
-----
Draco appeared home with a crack. He rushed to his room, pulling his suitcase down from on top of his wardrobe and throwing clothes into it. He went to the bathroom and grabbed his toothbrush and toiletries, as well as his anxiety pills. He zipped up the case and dragged it to the living room.
The Gryffindor was sound asleep, or so Draco thought. Just as he was about to retreat, the other man let out a loud breath, followed by a word: “Draco.”
“Harry?”
“Different how?” Hermione leant towards Harry, intrigued.
"Still, it had to be hard. Always having the spotlight on you."
Harry tilted his head. “It’s fine, it was my fault anyway.” He looked down at Draco’s empty glass. “Let me get you a drink to say sorry.”
“Still bloody here.” Neville chuckled. “Just a bit more comfortable now.”
Harry huffed and shooed him away. "Okay, okay. Give me a moment."
"You could've at least tried."
“Mmm-hmm. Sure. We all know if Hermione wasn’t in the picture, I’d be the apple of your eye.”
“Don’t even try it.” Harry smirked. “You can’t just throw water on The Saviour of The Wizarding World.”
-----
"Latte with an extra shot, please." Draco smiled politely at the barista as he offered her a muggle note with a 50 on it. She looked at him quizically and took it.
He kissed Potter's chest, then his shoulders, then his neck, and finally his mouth. He looked into his bright green eyes as he lined his cock up. "Are you ready?" Potter held his gaze and nodded.
“A truce?” Ron asked.
Draco looked away, more than a tad uncomfortable. He didn’t care about Potter, not anymore. The golden boy was a childish fantasy that he had put aside a long time ago. So why did he want to ask more?
"Fuck Malfoy, yes."
Draco was faintly aware of a vibrating next to his thigh, and it seemed to be getting louder by the second. He pulled away as Potter sighed and pulled his vibrating wand from his Pocket. He tapped it to his palm.
Goodbye, Draco Malfoy, she thought, I'll read about your death in the Prophet within the month, and then I will truly be happy.
Draco snorted. “Good idea, Potter. The hallway is about to flood with students.” The Slytherin didn’t look away though, his silver eyes holding Harry's with a hopeful look.
Harry pulled on a smile. “All good. You alright?”
And then Harry heard a hiss in his ear, so close it made him sick, and he turned to see the blood red eyes of Voldemort as Nagini's fangs pierced him. Instead of the usual darkness, he opened his eyes to meet a pair of chocolate ones.
The jingle of the bells above the front door told her that her destiny was finally here. She spun around quickly, a dazzling smile on her face.
Draco picked Teddy up under the arms, holding him in front of him like a shield. “He’s got bloody black hair!” But as he said this, he watched with wide eyes as his hair turned silver. “Merlin’s tits!”
“You’re catching on.”
“Is that a compliment, Mr Potter?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
“You take it before bed, and after about thirty minutes you will be pulled into a deep sleep.” Draco leant forward, resting his elbows on the counter. “The first few nights, your nightmares may continue, but this time have some differences. For example, if you were having nightmares about your friends arguing, a new person may appear and interrupt the argument. Or if someone were chasing you through Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall might appear and give the person chasing you a detention.”
Harry sat on the bar stool next to her, pulling a couple of beers out of the carrier bag he’d brought with him. He opened the first, sliding it over to Ron, before cracking open his own.
Please let me know what your favourite part(s) were!
“Wow. I wonder what it feels like to be interrupted!” The darker man said, scowling. Draco couldn’t help but wonder if he looked that good whilst scowling too.
Mr Potter had called me in urgency, requesting not only my reporting skills, but my companionship. Having been in acquaintance with Mr Potter for nearly five years, it is safe to say that our relationship is one that is tight-knit and very personal.
“Don’t. I - I didn’t say no.”
I'll meet you there, Potter.
“Can be easily cleaned.” Draco finishes, pushing the curls that had stuck to Harry’s wet eyes away from his face. “Talk to me.” He whispers the words, letting his voice fill with sincerity.
"Let's go to Paris." No use beating around the bush.
Draco and Balveer both stared down at their linked arms, both as equally shocked. What on earth was Potter doing? The heat radiating from his was delicious and zapped any sense Draco had to pull away. In fact, he practically leaned into it.
Harry looked over to Draco as he sat back down on the sofa, the Slytherin on the other end. “Is that so?”
The morning had gone better than expected.
“Merlin, you did not just call him ‘Snako’.” Harry rubbed his hands over his face. He wished his coffee would hurry up.
“Homophobic?” Malfoy asked, somehow shocked. “I’m not homophobic!” He laughed, making Harry’s anger only deepen.
“Work is rarely exciting for anyone.” Harry replied. He smiled and nodded to the emporium owner, picking up his bag with his spare arm and slinging it over his shoulder. He turned around, locking eyes with a familiar pair of silver ones.
The club was lavish: chandeliers and sofas, draping fabrics and secluded booths, all topped off with neon lights and thumping music. Pansy sashayed her way into one of the seating areas and sat down, waving to a waitress. "Four shots of firewhisky please and…" she looked around at the other witches and wizards and pointed to a large pitcher of glowing liquid with smoke coming off it, "two of whatever they're having."
“Come here, Bear.” Draco held out his arms for Teddy, and Harry reluctantly passed him over. The toddler immediately started pulling at his earlobes as Draco let out a chuckle. He pulled back to look at his hair again and frowned. “Dammit. I thought it would work.”
“I do hope that’s my cousin and not your secret illegitimate child, Potter.” The drawling aristocratic tone of Draco Malfoy called behind the bench. He had dropped off the potion the week before, but Harry hadn’t seen him since.
"Well Draco?" his father asked. "Is it? Is it Harry Potter?"
“Dwaco!”
Sirius pointed at him. "Picture, Daddy take picture!"
Harry gaped at him. “Why in Merlin’s name would you say that?”
Pansy propped up a very drunk Draco against the doorway. "Alohamora." The door swung open and she nudged him in, pushing him onto the sofa.
“So, really-fucking-early.”
"I feel that I no longer suit this role," and I'd cut my testicles off with a butter knife before I spend my last months working for you.
“Very romantic.” He drawled.
"I can't believe I used to hate you." Harry giggled, his arm linked through Draco’s.
Pansy raised her eyebrows. “Who knew muggles could be so useful?” She joked.
“You kissed me!” Draco whisper-shouted.
Draco took a step back, afraid to let him get closer. He was already too vulnerable. “But that doesn’t change -”
So there you have it, an unlikely reunion of long-time enemies, and a new saviour of The Saviour.
They walked side by side silently in the dying light of the evening. After several minutes, Harry finally spoke up.
Draco watched as Harry Potter shook hands with members of the Wizengamot, and felt his heart swell. If it hadn't been for Potter's testimony, his mother would surely be rotting alongside his father in Azkaban.
“Uh-huh. That’s what I thought.”
“What did he say to you, Harry?” Hermione asked.
“Luna invited me.” Merlin, why did he feel so awkward?
He knew he wanted to spend his last few days with her, spending some quality time together before he left this world. Draco could taste salt and touched his cheeks to realise he was crying. He frowned and wiped them away. That wouldn't do, if he started crying now, Merlin knows he wouldn't be able to stop.
"If I remember correctly, Malfoy, you volunteered to be interviewed by her during fourth year, and were more than eager to spread lies about me! At least I didn’t lie!”
-----
"How on Earth have you fucked it up?"
“What are you doing here?” Why was his heart beating so fast?
He lead them out of the alley and into the bright sunlight, muttering a skin protection spell as he went because he knew how easily he burnt. They turned the corner to see a stream of clear water, children splashing in it as parents and dogs sat on the grassy banks, eating ice cream and laughing. It looked heavenly.
Pansy’s gaze drifted to the window, as a light haze of rain drifted down over the spring sun. “Oh, look. You were right, Lovegood.”
“Hi, Bear!” He called, taking Teddy from Andromeda’s arms and ruffling his white hair. “How are you?” Teddy pulled at his earlobes, a favourite habit of his. “I can’t stay long, Andy. Je suis désolé (I’m sorry). I need to get back to the shop.” Draco’s heart was racing, and he felt like he might explode - he was certainly not going to do that in front of his Aunt, Potter be damned.
"What do you mean?" Draco crossed his arms, and Harry could see his walls going up.
This story started out as a way for me you try writing longer fics that weren't just pure smut, and ended up meaning a lot to me.
"He's always known how to do that." Replied Potter.
"Well, I’m definitely enjoying the view." Harry gave him a cheeky smile and Draco blushed, looking out at the streets, the Eiffel Tower in the background.
"What were you going to say?" Harry’s eyebrows drew together.
5th March 2000
“Well, that’s good at least.” Ron said distractedly. He was always so impressed with television. “Sometimes I wish I could tell my dad about this stuff, but he’d go mental, never leave me or you alone.” He added, nodding at the TV.
At this point in the conversation, Harry Potter was on the brink of tears, and thanked me again for hearing him out as he had been so weighed down with the conflicting emotions of consorting with his ex-enemy. We paused our discussion for him to regain his composure. When we began again, Mr Potter told me how Mr Malfoy had been successful in his treatment, and has since opened his own potion shop in the wake of his success. As repayment, Mr Potter had agreed to this interview.
Harry wiped his hands on his apron, pulling his best friends in for a hug. "Sorry I'm running a bit late."
"Yeah, it's good, great." He winced. "Well not great, like fantastically great, just good. It’s a normal amount of good, not like really good, like it's good that you're friends. Friends with Malfoy. Nothing more, nothing less. Like those bears, do you remember those bears and the porridge? You and Malfoy are like some perfect porridge." Ron's skin bloomed as red as his hair as the words continued to pour from his mouth.
Before Draco could say anything, Harry stormed out of the room, through the portrait hole.
“What in Merlin's tits is wrong with you?”
"Oh fuck." Potter whispered, eyes wide.
Draco leaned in close, taking Potter's hand and giving into the absurdity of the situation and the butterflies in his stomach. "Let me lead." He said lowly in his ear. The brunette nodded with a shiver, and Draco placed his hand on his hip.
“Why would they have sex on your bed? They have their own beds that are perfectly fine for such things.”
Draco gave him a shy smile. "Let's get a drink."
“Well, we can’t back out now! Let’s just get it over with.” Potter took his hand, and Draco lost all sense. His whole body felt like it was on fire. Ignoring the fact that his insanely hot crush was now holding his hand, he was about to go dance with him!
Pansy made a choking sound beside him, and he turned to see her staring down someone across the room. He followed her gaze, nearly choking himself.
"You've never been?"
"No, in fact he had almost the exact same reaction." Andy frowned thoughtfully.
“Potter?” The familiar aristocratic voice of Draco Malfoy called out, unexpectedly loud.
The Dark Mark was no longer black, instead looking itself like scar tissue, pink skin winding intricately over Draco's otherwise pale arm.
Harry clenched his fists, scowling as he made his way across the platform to Ron and Hermione. The pair were ready with consoling comments and cruel remarks.
"Touch yourself."
“You know, you’ve been calling me that a lot recently.” Harry says, emerging in a cloud of steam, burgundy boxers clinging sinfully to him.
Draco sat up and stared incredulously at Harry. “I don’t want to talk about this right now.”
“Cocky much?”
“Everyone is a little bit gay.”
“Yes, but it’s been playing on my mind ever since. Is it really so far-fetched to think that maybe he wants to do well?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Alright what is it? Have I got something on m-” He was interrupted as the two nodded to each other, their expressions morphing into slick smiles before striding towards him. Harry took a step back, sure that they were going to knock him over, but the two barely missed him, skirting around. When he looked back, the two young men were chatting to two of Fleur’s school friends.
“I don’t want to go back.” Draco matched her tone.
He slapped his cheeks, trying to get some colour in them. He plastered on his smile in the mirror, and turned around.
“Who said I was stressed?” Draco huffed, straightening his cloak as they stood outside the owl emporium in the mid morning sunshine. They were here to collect the owl’s (Potter had informed him that his name was Alfie) healer’s notes. Draco needed to know what had been diagnosed about the owl in the past.
Draco huffs. “Maybe not. But tell me you don’t enjoy the image of his huge arse crammed into that cupboard.”
Tears fell down his cheeks. He had no future. He should owl Potter and tell him that he couldn't see him. Didn't want to see him. All it would do is cause more suffering in the long term.
“Not even you?”
“Don’t start that again.” Draco thought back to their failed lunch date. “I’m asking now.”
“I’ll bloody take the offer back if you’re not careful.”
The barn owl flew up to him, landing on his shoulder with an affectionate peck on the ear. “Hey, Alfie.” Harry said softly, giving him a treat. “You okay?” The bird nudged him, and he took that as a yes. “Glad to hear it, I’ll come see you later, okay? I need to sort all the mess out first.”
“‘Course he can! He’s Dumbledore!”
"So were you really hitting on me?" Draco asked.
"You're doing so well," he whispered and Potter let out a little whimper. Draco watched as he began pumping his fingers a bit faster, panting heavily.
"Don't you ever wonder what would’ve happened if we had been friends?" Harry couldn't stop the words from pouring out of his mouth, his heart desperate to speak now he finally had Malfoy sitting across from him. He’d always felt drawn to the Slytherin. When he was younger, it was easier to hate him; and boy, had Draco given him plenty of reason to. Even though they had never spent much time together, the other was always there, in the background. Granted, they hadn’t talked much since Harry spoke at Draco’s trial, but it didn’t mean that he hadn’t watched him closely the entirety of eighth year. But there wasn’t a marauder’s map for the entirety of London, and his friends rarely spoke of Malfoy. It was like he’d vanished from Harry’s life over the past nine months.
Harry woke with a start, drenched in sweat. For a second he raised his hand to grasp at his bed curtains, eager to see the reassurance of his best friend's face, but he only reached into thin air. His legs were tangled in his bed sheets, and a ticklish roughness licked at his feet. He reached out a shaky hand to grab for his glasses and slid them on. The white mound at his feet took the form of his feline companion. “I’m sorry, Lucy.” The words shook with his breath as he spoke. “Did I wake you up?
“Do an interview. With whom, I don’t mind. Offer your testament that coming to my shop helped you. Coming from you, business would really pick up.” Malfoy crossed his legs, reclining in a manner that Harry was soon learning was faux-nonchalance.
“Thanks, ‘Mione.”
"So what happens now?" His voice came out barely above a whisper.
“Don’t make fun of me, Malfoy.” He said, tears welling in his eyes.
Harry takes it and frowns down at it. "Um, what reds would you recommend?" He turns to Draco. "It is red that you like, right?"
“Shut up.” Harry whines, hiding his face again.
“Yes! And so should you be! Bloody things want to kill me!” He hissed, peeking around Harry’s legs.
“Malfoy?”
“Yes you are." Luna turned to the Gryffindor. "Harry. You shouldn’t have been so naïve and taken the easy route of speaking to Rita Skeeter. Even you sounded bad in that article.” Her words held no malice, just fact. She then turned her attention to Draco. “Yes, the words weren’t the kindest. But they worked, Draco.” She looked down at Sylvia, making soft kissy noises at her as she scratched under her chin, seemingly unaware as to the need for an explanation.
"He looks like your type," she shouted over the music.
Draco smiled, and Harry wondered if this is what people meant when they said they might swoon.
"I don't suffer from them anymore. That's what I'm here to talk about." Harry swigged the last of his tea. "I took a new potion. It's got rid of my nightmares, and I'm extremely grateful for it."
Harry Potter asking what Draco was doing at the ministry a few months later. "I'm training to be a curse-breaker, Potter. Let me guess, you're already Head Auror?" he had drawled in return. To his surprise, he had laughed, actually laughed.
Pansy held her hand up with a snort. "You don't even know the half of it. I was upset, but then I thought about it and I realised I would be happy to try a polyamorous relationship - except…" she paused for emotional effect.
Harry looked at him strangely for a minute before shrugging. "Okay, but I'm blaming you for missing dinner at Ron's tonight."
“Doggy!” He squealed and Harry smiled, taking it from him to entice him onto his lap.
Draco pouts, opening the second drawer in the wardrobe and tossing him his favourite navy sweater. “Is not.”
Old enough never came. Draco had returned home with his parents, and they hadn't travelled back to Egypt again. Instead, holidays were spent with arguments or icy silence. His mother often took trips to southern France, but Draco was rarely permitted to do so.
Harry turned the channel to put it on. “He’s alright yeah, says the potion shouldn’t be too hard to make. He said it probably already exists somewhere obscure.”
“You bitch. Why didn’t you make me one?”
“Incredible.”
“Guys. I love you so much, but please, for the love of Merlin. Shut up and let me speak.” Hermione made a zipping motion and Ron held his hands up in surrender. “Okay, so as I was saying. Malfoy owns this shop, and it’s really nice inside actually, but anyway. I asked about the potion and he said he developed it himself. He said-”
Draco took a deep breath. “I’m sorry if I took it too far-”
“She always comes back having had a good time.” Ginny added, kissing her girlfriend on the cheek from where she sat with her arm thrown around the Ravenclaw. “I’m not his biggest fan, but Luna likes him and that’s enough for me.”
The darker man huffed, scooping up some chocolate mousse for himself. Teddy whined loudly and he immediately offered him some. “I suppose you should come back to mine for a cuppa then.”
"No worries." Harry smiled back, and it met his eyes. Draco’s heart fluttered and he silently berated it.
"It's called snorkeling, sweetheart. Wizards don't use muggle technology -it's far too dangerous." She tucked a stray piece of silver hair behind his ear.
He sat down on the sofa, folding his cloak over his lap. Not a moment later, Potter appeared, out of breath and a little bit frazzled. “You didn’t have to run, you silly git.” He took the glass that he offered. “Thanks.” Just the sight of the other man seemed to calm him down a bit.
The bodies of his friends lay in the dust and rubble of Hogwarts, lifeless, as Harry looked desperately for his wand, any wand. A loud hissing made him look up, and there was Nagini slithering towards him, baring its fangs. He stepped backwards, and as soon as his foot hit the ground, Hermione’s screams started. The smartest, bravest witch he knew, was crying, begging for help as Bellatrix sent Crucio after Crucio at her. And as Nagini got closer, Harry’s own death imminent, Ron started shouting.
A loud scream echoed out, penetrating the howls of the wind, the agony in Hermione’s voice permeating the air with urgency. He looked towards the sound, searching the clouds of dust desperately.
“Pansy!”
"That's correct, sir." Draco kept his face neutral.
She would end the Malfoy line once and for all, and soon the world would have one less evil in it. Her parent's faces flashed before her eyes, and she took a steadying breath.
"Of course, master."
Draco on the other hand, wasn’t just happy, he was ecstatic. All these years of confusion, of crushing, pining, and Harry Fucking Potter liked him back. They were sat, soaked to the bone in a water fountain, having just had their first kiss. Pigs must be flying.
“Hello, Mother. What brings you to Hogwarts?”
“I’ve been working on it.” Potter had the audacity to smirk, and Malfoy’s heart nearly exploded. Merlin, he had a good mind to wipe that look off of his face.
“Oh, good.” Luna smiled brightly. “We’ll get a rainbow.”
It wasn’t long until he did see it with his own eyes. Malfoy was working quickly, and with every friend Harry lost to an apology, his confusion and anger only grew.
“Love. It seems to be a new favourite pet name of yours.” Harry flashes him a dazzling smile, though far too care-free to be serious.
“You are going to listen to me, Harry, because I swear to Merlin I have not been planning tomorrow for weeks just for your Gryffindor pride to ruin it.” Draco looked down at Harry and took a calming breath when he realised he wasn’t looking back at him. “Baby, look at me.” Draco tilted Harry’s chin up, until green eyes shone into his grey ones.
She let out her breath in a whoosh and couldn't help but smile devilishly. She had been so patient, making sure to not give him the poison until he was confident in taking the pills, and the past 90 days had been the slowest of her life. When he had rang to request a refill, she knew this was her chance.
“Yeah, it really has.”
Harry stared at Draco dizzily for a moment as his mind raced and the butterflies in his stomach hurtled round and round, lost in his silver eyes. The slytherin smiled knowingly, seemingly encouraged by Harry’s reaction.
“I’m sorry to barge in, Andy. I’ve just had a rough day and wondered if you fancied a BLT?” He held up the paper bag sheepishly, and Andy smiled before letting him in. Merlin, he was thankful for her constant hospitality. He walked in, taking off his shoes before he walked into the lounge. He settled himself on the rug, leaning back against the floral print sofa.
Draco wanted to laugh, but this was the perfect opportunity to tell him. I'm dying. The words were on the tip of his tongue - but if he said them out loud, that would make them real.
"Fineeee."
“Draco, est-ce que ça va (are you okay)?” His aunt’s shocked face morphed into worry, her brows pinched together.
“Me too, Harry.”
“For the love of all that is good, don’t bring me along. You two need to get a room.”  Snake-Draco hissed.
Harry ran his hand through his hair, only messing up his curls further. “So do you. I’ve never seen you look so-”
And so, when Harry woke up exactly three weeks after first visiting Malfoy’s shop, he decided that he was going to visit again. After his morning shift, he apparated to Diagon Alley, pulling his scarf up over his face. He stood outside the shop, trying to peak discreetly through the window in the door. Malfoy stood inside, glasses on as he pointed at different potions behind the counter. The middle aged woman in front of him nodded, pointing at the same bottle that Malfoy was. Harry pushed open the door, letting the wind chimes signal his entrance.
The broad shot them both an annoyed look and ambled back into the crowd. Harry dropped his arm as Draco leaned into his ear. "Thanks!" He shouted. Potter shot him a lopsided smile, taking his hand and leading them back out to the dance floor.
Harry pulled the packet out of his pocket. “I’ll give you some if you tell me where we’re going tomorrow.”
Draco pushed his hair out of his eyes, a bit bashful. "Yeah, I mean, it's just a very rare ailment."
Harry thought it over. At least he wouldn't be harassed by anyone, plus it would be interesting to see Malfoy in a muggle environment.
"Potter. It's nearly curfew." Snape's drawling voice called out, and Harry turned to see him standing a few feet away. The professor's eyebrows drew together. "Are you alright?"
“Fuck knows mate. I’ll believe it when I see it with my own eyes.”
“You’re staying?”
"Everyone and no one," Pansy cackled. "Whoever can tame me."
“What were you doing in a muggle bar?”
When Harry laughed, it was like music to his ears, and he found himself joining in too. How were their lives always so absurd?
And so Harry sat down against the wall, letting his head hang as he tried to calm his racing heart.
"Give her some credit, Harry. She is in Ravenclaw for a reason." Ginny said, rolling her eyes.
His hand was so warm, all of Potter was. It was like he was fire personified, warming you up, all blazing looks and passion. Draco ached to know whether he brought that fire to the bedroom.
I certainly did you. I hated you, it's true. For many reasons. For stealing the limelight, for bettering me, for dismissing me. But I also admired you, envied you. Resented you, and myself, for my cowardice, for my choices, for having the family that I did, that I do.
“Shit.”
He walked into the living room, clicking his teeth. "Lady? Where are you girl?"
“I suppose it’s worth a shot.” He nodded, offering her a small smile.
Draco thought it over quickly. “Five and a half.”
The other man groaned, opening his eyes blearily. “Draco?” He held his hand out and the blond walked forwards to take it. He pulled him in, lifting up the duvet with his other hand. Draco crawled in beside him. “Turn.” Harry grumbled, and he did as he was told, putting his back to him. Apparently, Harry wanted to be big spoon. “Better.” He mumbled, before his breaths quickly fell into a more rhythmic pace.
“First step: rights for house elves. Second step: Minister for Magic.”
"Fuck off, Malfoy."
“No it's not.”
“Merlin, I could kiss you!” Harry lunged at him, pulling him in for a bone-crushing hug. The blond let out an uncharacteristic squeak, arms limp by his side in shock. The darker man let go, the smile still plastered on his face. “You’ve bloody done it! You’ve cured Alfie!” His heart beat rapidly, the whole front of his body tingling from the heat of the hug, and he blinked at Malfoy. His skin was flushed, his hair sticking up a little. “Oh. Sorry. I guess.. Er, I guess I got a little carried away.”
Draco frowned, unsettled by the sudden change in conversation. Was Potter really holding a grudge over something that happened over eight years ago?  "Don’t be so rude. As if you're the same person you were when you were eleven, Potter." He snapped.
He turned to his mother to see her raise her head from where it had been bowed, and Draco fell into her arms as tears swelled in his eyes.
Mr Malfoy,
“Well, whatever it was. I hope the scotch helps.” Potter chuckled and Draco found himself giving in to a small smile.
Draco shook his firm hand with his own clammy one and followed him as he took them into a small office. "What is this about?" his voice shook.
“Uh-huh. Just let me know when the wedding is.” Seamus said, sitting on Dean’s lap.
“I know this isn’t the kind of luxury you’re used to Alfie, but this will have to be where you stay until I can get you better.” Harry threw him a treat. “I’ll come and see you later for dinner.”
"It's Michelin Star," Potter comments as they sit down.
Draco pretended to think about it. "I think I've found someone better."
“You’re telling me!” Draco groaned. They both took a swig of their wine at the same time.
No.1 Take Pansy to Felix Felicis
Draco sniffled into Harry’s curls. “I’m sorry for making you feel unwanted.” He leant back to kiss Harry’s forehead. “I do want you.”
"Well...yeah." Potter ran a hand through his curls nervously, only helping to add to the chaos on top of his head.
Draco woke with a hangover that was nowhere near as bad as he expected. With a groan he lifted himself out of bed, stretching with a yawn as memories of the night before came back to him. Potter's green eyes, Potter's freckles, Potter's flirting.
Hermione shook her head at him. "He's just stressed with work, aren't you?"
Draco looked into his eyes, the bright green awash with tears. He was dying, right now. Perhaps there were worse ways to go.
Narcissa chuckled and wrapped her arms around Draco, scooping him up. "I know they're pretty Draco, but you can't lean that far over! What would I do if you fell in?"
Harry rubbed at his forehead as he spoke. “He said some bullshit about a truce. As if I’d ever think that he wasn’t a dick.” He snorted. “He almost sounded genuine, you know? Then I remembered that this is Malfoy and there’s not an honest bone in his body.”
He passed her the BLT in return. “No, does that make me a bad godfather?”
"No thank you, dear. I bought them for you!"
“There. I’ll keep it forever.”
Please come to St Mungos as a matter of urgency.
Malfoy frowned, throwing Harry a dirty look. “Are you using one of my closest friends to manipulate me?”
"I need you to take a letter for me."
"And you’re a prick who is so used to having people brown nosing him that he can’t stand someone who refuses to!” Malfoy stepped forwards, squaring his shoulders as he seethed.
Harry lets out a small laugh. “You’re awful.”
“I might just take you up on that, Potter. After all, I did have to shut the shop early for your Gryffindor pride.” The blond smirked back.
“Nope. But just like when I said that to you, we have an argument to sort out.” Harry pulled off his scarf and crossed his arms.
“Of course, come in. It’s in the kitchen.” She smiled at him and moved out the way, not calling him out on his obvious lie.
“What, no hug?” Harry teased, walking up behind him and squeezing him tightly. Ron wheezed dramatically, flicking water at him over his shoulder.
"Bloody buggering balls." Harry muttered, searching the fridge desperately for the mozzarella. "Be thankful you don't have opposable thumbs, Luce, or I'd be blaming you for this." He shook his head at her as she sat on the kitchen counter beside him, head tilted as if she could understand him. He could've sworn he had bought some the other night. How was he supposed to make his legendary pizza now? Ron and Hermione were due in ten minutes, and all he'd done was turn the oven on.
“Hmm. Very well then.” She turned to Harry. “I don’t care who he is, no one comes in the back of my shop.”
Potter chuckled. “Yes I did. No one is perfect.”
“You know I’m always here for you, mon fils (my son).”
"Scum and mudbloods." Lucius corrected under his breath, frowning at the two from behind his scotch glass. Draco hadn't heard him.
"Oh dear, Potter. That won't do.I won’t have any kind of half-arsedness," Draco said playfully.
Harry squinted at him, not in the mood for his attitude. “Just make it to that effect.”
"Shhh my sweetling, all will be well." His mother shushed him as she stroked his hair. He should have cared that people could see him crying in his mother's arms, but he didn't.
"Fucker."
"Absolutely bloody brilliant."
He knelt next to the fireplace, sticking his head in. "Harry Potter's house," he called and felt the horrible sensation of having only his head tumbling through the network.
“That’s what I mean!”
Harry stopped in his tracks, resting a hand on Malfoy’s arm to stop him. “What?”
"If you keep doing things like asking me on random trips to Paris, you'll be well on your way to never getting rid of me."
Luna walked forward and grabbed Harry’s hand. “You should at least try it.” She gave it a firm squeeze before dropping it.
Draco had been slacking with his visits recently, only fire calling his mother over Easter, and last seeing her back at Christmas.
Draco kicked off his shoes as he walked into his apartment, unbuttoning the top of his shirt. He allowed himself a moment of weakness; leaning against the wall to catch his breath and slow his heart after the four flights of stairs up to his apartment. They had never winded him before - but he supposed that’s what dying did to you. It was a warm, sunny, spring afternoon and he was eager to spend it reading on his balcony.
"Don't tell me you're regretting your decision."
Just then, a person popped up from behind the counter, wearing a medical mask and glasses, and Harry jumped twenty feet in the air. “Bloody hell!” He shrieked, clutching at his chest. Maybe he was more relaxed these days after all.
"Harry, stop it."
The slytherin pulled himself from the other man's grasp, shoving him away. "What the fuck were you thinking, jolie garçon (pretty boy)?!" He thought back to the article, grinding his teeth. Bloody stupid Potter, he just had to come and ruin all his hard work, didnt he?
Draco offered an exhausted chuckle. “Some of it.” He tried to think back. “We finished the third bottle of merlot, right? Or was it the fourth? And your dancing, that was great.” He snorted. “Merlin. You do squeal when you’re drunk Pans, I thought my eardrums- OH FUCK!”
21st May 2001
He barely noticed as Luna appeared through the portrait hole, greeting her girlfriend with a kiss on the cheek. She was a regular in the common room, despite having her own to retreat to. The Ravenclaw took Ginny's hand as the two stood, heading up to the girls’ dormitories. As they passed, Ginny leaned down to whisper in Harry’s ear.
The moment the Slytherin set foot outside the classroom, Harry had him by the front of his shirt and was dragging him into a nearby alcove. He shoved him against the wall. “What the fuck, Malfoy?”
Balveer was the latest of Draco’s romantic escapades, and held a striking resemblance to a certain navy-clad wizard across the room. He was sinfully gorgeous and sweet and kind - and did absolutely nothing to Draco’s heart. They had broken up a few weeks prior, and despite their relationship only lasting a few months it had been more than messy. It was safe to say that the man did not return Draco’s feelings of ‘only friends’.
"Merlin's beard, Malfoy. I thought I was supposed to be the dim one! I spoke at your trial, remember?"
"No, as he is the reason for my betterment. I'm very thankful that he could help me with this. Malfoy has recently opened his own potion shop, Grotte aux Remèdes. I hope someone might hear my story and go there, and that they might find the help they need." He said, his hands shaking.
"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
“Get off me!”
"Are we really doing this, Potter?" Draco tugged gently at his hair to pull him up so he could see his face.
He met Draco’s lips slowly, almost cautiously. He felt so right, and so warm, that Harry let out a little moan, and that’s all it took for Draco to crawl onto his lap, deepening the kiss. Harry wrapped his arms around his waist, their lips crashing together hotly. It felt so good.
"Miss, I don't think you need to hear how it happened…"
“Well, change it!” Malfoy said with wide eyes, looking the most nervous Harry had ever seen him.
Draco snorted. "You're gonna act innocent? You-" he jabbed his finger into Harry’s chest, "-were just as guilty as me."
At the sound of her name, the young snowy cat ceased her licking and trotted up to him, her soft purring joining the sound of Harry’s ragged breathing. She butted her head against his hand and he let himself relax against his pillows as she crawled onto his chest, her purring becoming louder by the second. Merlin, he was glad to have her. The nightmares, although less frequent these days, had cursed Harry with a new intensity since the battle. He had somehow managed to trudge through eighth year, but the terrors still persisted more nights than not. Images of mangled corpses, blood stained uniforms and splintered wands flashed across his mind, and he couldn’t stop the shiver that wrenched its way up his spine.
“It’s gonna be a bloody scene in a minute when the two of us show up, uncoordinated and gay!” He hissed back.
"How have I been keeping?" Potter snorted, dropping three sugar cubes into his drink. "This is probably the longest conversation we've had since the trials." Draco thought back to the months following the battle, how Potter had spoken at his and his mother’s trials. He didn’t know what was more mortifying, the dubious looks on the wizengamot’s faces or when he thanked Harry afterwards.
“See you later, Luce.” He gave her a singular stroke as she gobbled her food. Grabbing his flask and the paper bag, he closed his eyes and, with the familiar jerk of apparating, he opened them to the still dark sky, the wind nipping at his cheeks.
"I promise, Draco."
This was far too serious for a first conversation over lunch. Draco tried to push down the anxiety in his stomach, fighting the urge to run away.
Harry laughed, catching his hands. “It kind of is.”
“You own.. This is your shop?” Harry stuttered, trying to wrap his head around the whole situation. He hadn’t seen Draco since they were all taking their NEWTs and that was nearing a year ago. He hadn’t changed much of course, except the shadows under his eyes were almost completely gone, and he looked like he had filled out more, or maybe he was just standing taller. His white-blond hair had grown a little longer, the soft waves pushed haf-hazardly behind his glasses to keep them out of his eyes. He seemed more confident, actually confident, not a fake cockiness - he seemed comfortable and at home in the shop.
"And dim." He laughed and ducked out of the way of another smack. Malfoy couldn't help but laugh too. They continued walking.
“Promise?”
"I mean slightly, Potter, yes." Draco paused, taking a deep breath. "I'm more surprised that you like death eater cock, though."
“Oi.”
Pansy waved dismissively as she took a gulp of her tea and walked into the fireplace. "Half an hour!"
“Oh no, please tell me you didn’t send it to Blaise!”
Pansy gave a dry, humourless laugh. "It’s really rather stupid, Draco."
“Aw, you’re so cute, baby.” Harry pinched his cheeks and Draco swatted him away in mock-annoyance.
“That’s the first time you’ve ever said that, Malfoy.” He came in close, enjoying the pink tinge in the Slytherin’s cheeks.
“No you didn’t. But you almost barrelled me over, so you must have been quite determined to get here.”
"Right, that's it, I'm coming in." Ron's voice carried from outside the door, and a second later it flung open, the red head staring in shock at the sight before him; papers scattered around the room, and in the middle of the chaos, Draco Malfoy lying on top of Harry Potter, hands either side of his head, pale skin flushed, white-blonde hair falling into his face. "What the fuck, Malfoy?"
“You never know-”
Potter smiled at him and winked. "Not a chance." There was a loud crack, and he was gone.
This was it. This was the time to back out. But Harry had never been one to back down, and certainly not now, with his stomach full of butterflies for the first time in a long time.
He landed on his aunt’s doorstep, not daring to go back to the shop in case Potter followed him. He knocked quickly, and she answered not a moment later.
------
“Today we weren’t fighting. For the first time, since this whole reunion thing. Or at least, this afternoon, we weren’t.” He paused, taking another sip of his wine. “But this morning we were, and we always do. And it’s always at least half my fault, if not more. I antagonise him, stuck on this schoolboy fantasy of passion.” He looked away, feeling ashamed. “He just makes me feel so many things, and I don’t know what to do with them all. Then I end up lashing out.”
Harry stroked Lucy as he caught his breath, casting a quick tempus; 05:32. He was too awake now to go back to sleep, but he could go and see one of the only people awake this early - Ginny. There was a good chance she’d be getting in some early practice at the quidditch pitch. He climbed out of bed, pulling on some jeans and a tshirt, and grabbing his coat from where he had discarded it at the base of the bed. “Come on, Luce. Do you want some breakfast?”
Caring for owls wasn’t a particularly exciting job, but that was more than fine with Harry. He enjoyed the quiet, or at least the lack of talking. Working with them made him feel like his soul was being soothed, though it was hard to come in every day, not knowing which ones had been bought.
I have highlighted the smut  with -_-_-_-_-_-  so that you can skip if you're not comfortable.
If he was going to die, Draco decided that he wanted to eat that chocolate when he did.
The aviary was large, magically extended to the size of a small field, it didn’t have any trees, but there were two dozen perches bordering the outside. The whole enclosure was bordered with mesh wire, extending up ten metres up to allow for flying room. Each perch had three walls to keep out any rain , and the floor below them was wooden bark to make cleaning easier. The majority of the aviary was covered in grass, with longer patches scattered around. It was there that Harry would scatter their food. Right in the centre was a small pond for drinking.
“Fine.” Draco sighed. “I can’t be long. A sandwich and a coffee is all you’re getting.”
She gestured to the seating area, but Draco couldn't bring himself to sit down. He watched her head off down the corridor, pacing back and forth as he bit his nails. Thankfully, she was back quickly, followed by a tall, balding man in a lab coat.
Harry held up his hands. “No worries. I’ll take the healer’s notes back to mine. That okay?”
Potter scowled. “Don’t be pedantic. Do you want me to buy you lunch or not?”
“Come on, Lucy.” Harry called, walking up the once-again grand staircase and into the living room. He drew back the curtains, letting the afternoon light pour in through the large windows, the dust dancing in the sunlight. He flopped onto the sofa, putting an arm over his face as his feline companion jumped onto his chest. It was only just past three and he already felt exhausted. And angry. He was always bloody angry; at least around Malfoy that was. The feeling was becoming so familiar to him that it was almost welcome.
“And what do you think about that?” Paeson crossed her arms.
“You’re the most reliable thing in my life, Luce. As long as I feed you, you’ll love me forever.” He gave a sad laugh, stroking her snowy fur. She meowed back, seemingly agreeing.
“Yeah, how nice.” He agreed, nodding.
"I've always wanted to visit the Eiffel Tower."
“Harry! Language!” Andy tutted, resting her free hand on her hip. Harry ignored her, standing Teddy on his thighs and looking at him in wonder. He giggled, grabbing onto Harry’s shirt with his tiny fists.
“Oh mon Dieu (Oh my God).” He screeched, hands instinctively balling in the front of Harry’s trousers. He yanked him in front of him, using him as a shield from the bees.
Harry apparated home, shaking with anger. Anger towards Malfoy for being such a god-awful prick, but also anger at himself for going back to him again. It was like he was intoxicated on the way the slytherin held himself, the way he smirked, his arrogant manner, and by Merlin, his bloody french... It sparked a fire in Harry that he couldn’t describe. “Fucking hell!” He cursed, kicking the bannister in the entrance hall and grabbing at his toes as they throbbed in pain. He yanked off his shoes as a light jingle alerted him to Lucy’s arrival.
“No, it’s just…”
Harry wanted to laugh. Whatever she thought she understood, it probably wasn't right.  "I'm very thankful that he could help me with this too. Malfoy has recently opened his own potion shop, Grotte aux Remèdes. I hope someone might hear my story and go there, and that they might find the help they need."
“He touched my cheek today.”
“Nope. I’m using her as insurance.” Harry held his gaze, refusing to look away.
Draco backed away. “Yeah, of course.” He cleared his throat. “Can I have a glass of water, please?”
"What?" Draco's eyebrows drew together.
Harry pulled his hand away, suddenly embarrassed. “Thank you.” His cheek was still tingling pleasantly from the kiss.
Draco frowned. He knew it was only small, but he hadn’t been able to get that moment out of his head. When had Potter ever been that close to him? Okay, so he had, but Draco doubted teenage violence could be put in the same category as this kind of tender touch. Harry’s skin had been so rough, but his touch was so gentle. And Merlin, his eyes, those ridiculously charismatic green eyes that were so vivid against his dark skin. They had been looking at Draco with such earnest kindness. He was so utterly fucked.
“No!” Harry cleared his throat, “I mean, no, I’d...I’d like you to.” Was it hot? He felt hot. “It’s only down the road.”
The blond stood too, stuffing his hands in his pockets as he watched the lion’s movements. “I suppose it seems that way, to you.” He took a deep breath, as if readying himself. “The truth is, I’ve been feeling this way for a long time.”
Potter let go of his wrists, looking around. "Are we…?"
Draco stood again and pushed Potter back until the back of his knees hit the bed. He reached into his side drawer and pulled out a pot of lube as Potter crawled backwards onto the bed. He tossed it to him with a wink.
They shared a smile, enjoying the banter.
"Ask me nicely." Draco used his other hand to pull Potter's hair.
“It’s Alfie. Poor little man, I’ve had to isolate him away from the others.” She gestured to where Alfie was in his cage in the back room. “Something is wrong with his magic. All the birds within a twenty foot radius of him start going loopy, flying in circles or struggling to fly at all.” The older woman frowned, her face etched with worry. It was the most emotional Harry had seen her. “I just can’t figure it out. In all my 30 something years of working with magical creatures, I've never seen much like it. The last bird I did was put to sleep.” Pearson turned to him fiercely. “And that is not an option.”
“Or we could at least arrange another date.”
"What?” He almost shouted, “How-"
“Yes! He’s back with Paeson now, and she’s so happy, Merlin, I’ve never seen her so happy.” Harry reached forward to clasp Draco’s hand without thinking. “Thank you, Draco.”
He stepped closer, staring at Draco intently. "It really is, the moon… it makes it glow." He reached up to run his fingers through it. Draco's breath hitched and he closed his eyes to the touch. It felt so nice. Before he could open them again, he felt the warmth of Potter come closer, and then his lips pressed against his own.
“Yes it is.”
"Oh, Merlin...I…" He trailed off, running his hand through his hair as he stared at Harry, his pink cheeks illuminated by the street light.
"Stop what? Being right? Being mad at you? You should be used to it by now."
“This afternoon.” Ha muttered a quick tempus: 13:17. “Sh- I mean oh no! I didn’t realise the time Andy, I’m sorry.” He lifted Teddy onto her lap, narrowly avoiding swearing.
"I need to speak to you."
“No, Potter. Not until you let me explain.” Draco’s voice was surprisingly calm.
"Shut up." Was he being petulant? A bit. Did he care? Not at all.
Harry had stopped breathing, his eyes closed to the feeling of Malfoy so close. Pure panic seized him. Was Malfoy taking the piss? Oh merlin, he was! He knew Harry was into men and into him and now he was making fun of him. Tears threatened to spill over, and Harry blinked them away, filled once again with the anger that he was so familair with. He shoved Malfoy hard in the chest, satisfied at watching him stumble back.
"I want to, do you?" He looked down at him.
Draco strode in a moment later, two steaming mugs in hand. Harry made a shushing motion, pointing to the pile of blankets on the arm chair. Draco put the mugs on the coffee table and moved them out of the way as Harry lifted Teddy over to the seat, tucking him in. He cast a quick muffliato.
“Yeah, I get it, I’m dead to you.” Pansy waved her hand nonchalantly, as if she was already over the mess she'd created. “Just go and sort yourself out.”
"Malfoy?" Potter's voice came from behind Draco, filled with confusion.
"Then you shouldn't have!" Draco pushed him with just as much force, their argument growing more aggressive. This time, Potter slipped, falling backwards. He grasped at Malfoy's cuffs in desperation, his eyes wide with panic, but all he managed to do was bring him down with him, the two taking down a tower of boxes as they went. The paler man landed on him  with a grunt as a flurry of paper cascaded around them.
Draco hadn't realised he'd been staring until then, and he hurriedly picked up his drink and followed Potter out of the coffee shop.
"This is your fault in the first place." Harry grumbled back.
Draco actually choked on his drink this time. Potter patted his back with a laugh.
The Slytherin’s lips parted wordlessly, and he gave them a lick. Harry watched the movement before flicking his eyes back up to Malfoy’s. The Gryffindor stood, the sudden movement almost knocking the other boy over. He began pacing, running his hands through his curls.
“What? What’re you doing?!” The darker man looked at him with wide eyes.
“I came here once, when I was younger." Draco commented, taking in the room with a look of mild interest. "It looks a lot nicer now.” Potter had definitely been renovating, and it was a lot more homely now; nowhere near as terrifying and cold as he remembered. He wondered what Potter had done with the house elf heads.
-------
Harry smiled “He’s good, bigger everytime I see him.” His smile turned sad. “I wish Remus and Tonks could see him, I wish he could see them.”
“Maybe he WAS being genuine.” Hermione offered.
“You might as well. It’s closer.”
Harry returned it with a wry smile. “Ha. Ha.”
"Fuck, Harry!" he shouted, his cum shooting out. Apparently that was all the permission Potter needed, as his own cum spurted between their chests.
"Oh please. Pansy knows everything." Draco huffed, crossing his arms. His best friend may have worked several floors above, managing the Ministry's public appearance, but she knew every ounce of gossip in the colossal building. "Now tell me where he is, so I can knock his teeth out."
"I knew I never should have trusted you." Malfoy spat, pushing the darker man back, harder, making him stumble back as the two grappled with childish violence. His words were cold and harsh, and some part of him knew he was going too far, but he couldn’t stop the anger and anxiety from taking control.
He decided to leave his robes in favour of a much more muggle coat, a long dark one that went down to the floor. He was as ready as he'd ever be.
Draco looked away abashedly. “Oh, I was, er, meeting someone for a date.”
The boy blinked nervously back at him. "Yes."
“I’m meeting Mcgonagall for a tour.” Malfoy wasn’t quite meeting his eyes. He looked good, his hair falling softly over his forehead, no longer slicked back. He was dressed in an all black suit, one hand tucked into his trouser pocket. He looked handsome and confident… except for his other hand, which was tensing and untensing over and over again.
Which means Draco Malfoy did not intend for Harry to see this.
Draco unlocked the door to their room, opening it to reveal a quaint space with wicker furniture and orange accents. The plan was to stay for three blissful days with Harry and then he would go and spend the rest of his time at his mother's chateau. He walked in and turned round to see Harry slam the door shut, rushing up to him and pulling him into a rough kiss. Draco kissed him back and when they pulled apart to catch their breath, Harry pressed his forehead against his. "Shit, Malfoy. You're so hot when you speak French."
“Dwaco!” He said.
Draco looked up at Harry, water dripping from his curls, the sun shining behind his head. Merlin, if this wasn’t a wish come true, a dream come true, then what was? The moment was perfect, the cold water sending a buzz through his body. If fate, or destiny, or whoever,, wanted something to happen, then this was the time to act. He had spent too much of his life hating Potter, ridiculing him, bullying him, avoiding him, hiding himself from him. Enough was enough.
"Except that wasn't what they wanted, they just wanted a threesome." Pansy's eyebrows drew together and she swallowed thickly. "But they didn't tell me that until after… after I'd slept with them." Her voice quivered and she looked away.
“Enjoying a lovely cup of tea with my dear friend, Luna, here.” She sipped at her cup. “Why, what does it look like?”
Harry nearly choked at the sight. He cleared his throat. “Don’t make this more difficult, Malfoy. It’s mortifying enough as it is.”
“Yes, absolutely.” Draco ducked his head, his heart racing. This had been a bad idea.
The voice boomed from the tip and Potter sighed. Draco looked up from his wand to his face. He looked thoroughly fucked, and they hadn't even had sex. His lips were slightly swollen, his face flushed and his hair sticking out even more than usual. Draco wanted to find out what he actually looked like after sex.
Malfoy withdrew his hand, tucking it tightly into his trouser pocket. He rolled his eyes. “I should’ve known you’d be too immature, Potter. I doubt you even know what the word ‘truce’ means.” He snorted. “Shall I go and fetch Granger to define it for you?”
Draco put Sylvia down, relaxing against the shelves behind him in a haughty manner which he knew rubbed the other man the wrong way. “The saviour work continues.” He said with a smirk. Okay, so maybe he was allowing his schoolboy fantasy of Potter pushing him against a wall get the better of him. But really, life could be so dull sometimes; wasn’t he allowed to have some fun?
-----
It's not everyday that one is invited for a cup of tea with Harry Potter; The Boy Who Lived (now the Young Man Who Lived Twice).
What the fuck? Draco was one of his best friends. He hadn’t thought they’d crossed a boundary last night, but his racing heart begged to differ. Harry had never thought of the Slytherin as anything but his friend, though he wasn’t blind to his attributes. Draco was gorgeous, and kind, and made Harry laugh. He even enjoyed their bickering. But why had he pulled him in to bed? Why had he had dreams about them making out? Draco was his friend.  Seeing him as something more? He’d never really thought about it.
“Draco! Language!” Andy tutted, resting her free hand on her hip. Draco ignored her, standing Teddy on his thighs and looking at him in wonder. He giggled, pulling on Draco’s ears with his tiny fists.
But there was the voice in the back of his mind. You only have two months. You should spend it how you want, the rest be damned. He couldn't do that though, could he? That was selfish of him. Who cares about selfish? These are your last days.
“Sure, when you just practically already told me you want to sleep with me.”
“Why are you here? I mean - I didn’t expect you to be here.”
Hi! I hope you enjoyed! (And by enjoyed I mean you cried a little bit)
“It is?” Harry’s heart felt like it might explode out of his chest. What was Malfoy saying? It couldn’t be...that he returned Harry’s feelings? Surely not.
Draco raised an eyebrow, knowing full well that Potter probably wouldn’t follow along. “Ashwinder egg, bezoar, bubotuber pus, ginger root, jobberknoll feather, lavender and powdered dragon’s claw.” He pretended to dust something off the counter, not wanting to spend too long looking into Potter’s stupidly gorgeous eyes. “Don’t worry, you can tell Mr Weasley that the latter was ethically sourced.” The older redhead’s name had cropped up in his search for the right ingredients, but he had decided it best to stay away from working with a Weasley so soon after the war.
Draco looked at him with wide eyes. “Yes, are you sure though?”
Draco watched as Potter held up his hands in surrender. He had spent the past several months working hard to make this shop something to be proud of, a place people would feel welcome in. That had been made especially difficult by his family name, but with each happy customer, Draco slowly rebuilt his reputation. Now, Potter stood in the centre of it, not unwelcome, just.. a surprise. His unruly black curls were threatened to spill into his eyes, and he held a scarf in his hand. Bright green eyes lit up against his deep skin tone, and chapped lips pulled into a nervous frown. He looked good enough to eat, good enough to ravage, and yet here he was after so many months, questioning Draco’s cat naming skills. Oh, how he had missed the absolute twattery that followed the golden boy everywhere he went.
He didn’t move, deciding not to dignify Malfoy with him standing up. A moment later, Malfoy appeared in the doorway, his coat thrown over his arm.
“You said you didn’t care who I spoke to!” Harry exclaimed, though he knew he was right. At that moment he didn’t care, the adrenaline of the argument heating him up. He had tried so hard to get the interview right, and in his naivety he had expected it to work. Why couldn’t Malfoy see that he’d tried? His breaths came out in huffs, the other man’s face looking far too punch-able right now. He grabbed Malfoy by the front of his shirt, both men leaning over the counter towards each other until their faces were only inches apart. Malfoy’s pale skin held a slight blush, his pink lips wet with spit, and Harry’s green eyes blazed so fiercely they looked otherworldly. He'd only been in the shop less than two minutes and he already wanted to shove Malfoy against a wall.
"Draco? What is it?" Harry could feel his own tears on his cheeks.
"Come on Pans, I'm already on the edge of my seat."
Potter groaned and placed his lips against Draco's neck, grazing his teeth against his sensitive skin. Merlin, 15 year old Draco would have burst a blood vessel knowing what was about to happen, after spending so many nights in his bed at Hogwarts, fist tight around his cock over the thought of Harry Potter.
“That’s a bit bloody rich coming from that bigoted prick.”
“You’re being too nice.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, running a hand over his curls, “I think I’m just gonna go home.”
Draco smirked, he was more than happy to have his turn at teasing her. He suddenly remembered what else he wanted to talk to her about, and his smile faltered, his stomach dropping. “Merlin, Pansy. I feel like I’m out of control.” He rubbed at his head.
"You don't even have my address!" Draco called, but he was already out of earshot. He couldn't help the smile that creeped over his face. He was going on a date. With Harry Potter. Merlin’s tits.
Harry finally let go of his hands, but neither man stepped away. “Take me to dinner then.”
Harry slept okay that night, the potion once again thwarting his nightmares.
It was a little over a week later when Harry was left in disbelief once again. He looked up as Neville walked towards him, then continued to stare as he walked straight past, leaning over Malfoy’s desk. He said something and Harry watched as the Slytherin gave a small smile and nodded. Harry felt the rage boil in his chest, and he gripped his quill so tight in his hand it almost snapped.
“Look, I’m sorry, okay? It might go well, you never know. I do sometimes have good ideas, and honesty is always the best pol-”
“Why? No offence, but you weren’t the best at magical creatures..” Draco interrupted, unable to help himself to a snide comment, despite the hypocrisy in his statement. It really was bad how much he enjoyed seeing Potter riled up.
“And I have done, for a while.”
The words hung in the air between them, and Harry realised his mistake. Draco straightened in his chair, knuckles white around his mug as his face fell into a perfect mask of nonchalance; walls up. "Why would I spend time fretting over things like that? How does it help me now?"
The two boys whipped their heads round at the sound of the Headmistress’ voice and watched as she appeared through the portrait-hole. A flash of pale skin and white hair peaked out from behind her and Draco was up in an instant, scrambling to his feet and straightening his clothes.
The two had been friends for well over a year now, and it was comfortable as they lifted their joined hands above their heads, throwing their heads back and singing along to the music. The two danced the hours away, until the club closed and they found themselves stood on the street, drunken smiles on their faces as they stumbled down the road.
They stared down at their joined hands, both unaware of each other’s racing hearts and stomachs full of butterflies. Malfoy pulled away first, his pale skin even pinker than before. He cleared his throat again. “Yes, I can imagine she’s not one for eager expressions.” He joked. He stepped away, eager to get some space between them before his heart exploded. “His magic is fixed? The other owls are okay?"
"Says you, saviour boy."
Draco pulled out a paper package and unwrapped it to reveal a half eaten cake. He cut two slices and passed one over. "It's French, my mother sent it over."
"I'm sorry to bother you, but could you please go and grab some grated mozzarella from the shop for me?"
Draco watched as Potter gulped, his eyes following the long line of his neck.
“Don’t pout like that. It’s my mother-” Draco started, but was cut off by Harry holding up his hand and standing up.
“Draco? Really?” Ron chimed in with a disgusted look.
“This is Lucy. She’s my cat. And yes, she looks like Sylvia.” Harry mumbled, throwing his arm back over his face.
He didn't have to tell Harry twice. The Gryffindor took off again at a jog, back up to the common room. He needed to talk to someone, get these feelings out in the open, or he wouldn't sleep. When he entered the empty common room, he went over to the base of the girl's staircase.
“You won’t look at me, except you do, all the time.”
Harry stood up abruptly, making his way over to the portrait hole.
Pansy looked at him with concern. “What’s wrong, love?”
“Hit a soft spot, did I?” Harry let out a dry chuckle. “How am I supposed to trust you, Malfoy?” He hissed.
"Fuck, more, Malfoy, more."
“Ah. There’s that self-indulgent honesty.”
Harry raised his eyebrow at her and she chuckled. "Notice I said 'we' and not 'I'."
Harry picked Teddy up under the arms, holding him in front of him like a shield. “He’s bloody blond!” But as he said this, he watched with wide eyes as his hair turned raven black. “What in Merlin’s tits!”
Harry searched his face for any kind of humour. “Really?”
“How’ve you been over the past few days, Harry? I bumped into Luna and she mentioned something about a possible solution for your nightmares?”
“I’ve tried loads of potions, they don’t work.”
Both young men turned back to their food, Harry reaching for the pot of coffee he’d asked for. The noise in the hall rose, and he looked up just in time to catch the post before it hit his plate. Being a Hogwarts alumni and a seeker definitely helped during breakfast.
“I won’t lie to either of them.” Luna finally spoke up. “But I’m happy to help. Draco and Harry will be really great together.”
Draco smiled ruefully. At least she would be getting what she wanted.
"IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I'LL KILL YOU HARRY!" Weasley's voice screamed over the roar of the fiendfyre, but Draco couldn't take his eyes away from the dirt-covered boy diving towards him, one hand outstretched.
“I’ll only be a-” The gryffindor started, but Draco was already out the door. He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think.
Just when all hope seemed lost, an angel appeared, white halo glowing from the light outside. Well, maybe angel was an exaggeration, especially when it came to this particular Slytherin. Harry locked eyes with Malfoy across the bar, shock flashing across his face. What in Merlin’s name was he doing here?
Draco pulled back at that, snorting. "Since when did you care about getting in trouble?"
"Real men don't waste time on things that take them away from their role at home," his father had once said. Mother took him anyway a few times, before he started Hogwarts.
“Yeah, yeah. Of course.”
It was like siren call, the sound of Harry Potter begging him to fuck him. He pushed his cock in further and further until he finally bottomed out. He stilled for a second as he tried to catch his breath. Potter was so tight, and so warm, and fuck, he felt so good.
Potter's eyes flew open and he laughed. "Did you just call me Harry?"
"Not as much as I should be." The darker man leaned in close and Draco got another whiff of his intoxicating scent. "I had too much fun."
“Nah. Not much has happened recently. We need something interesting to talk about.” Ron said, slapping him on the back. Harry was jolted from his thoughts, his positively, absolutely, absurd thoughts. That lager must have been stronger than he realised. “Who wants another?” Ginny and Seamus shot their hands up.
“Shut up, you silly sod. You’re allowed to cry.”
"But you only finished training last year. You've barely been in the postition 6 months."
“Make me.” Harry whispered, holding on tighter. If you had told him two hours ago that he would be flirting with Malfoy outside the Great Hall, he would have told you to go and get your head checked for wrackspurts. He felt almost giddy with excitement and disbelief, and most of all, anxiety. He was just riding on the wave of adrenaline at this point.
"Later," Potter murmured and Draco shivered. Cheeky bastard. He grabbed Draco's arm. "Where to?"
“What can I say, I have a certain charm.”
“No, I did not.” There was no way he did, Draco thought, he was always in control.
Draco grimaced. “Oui, malheureusement (yes, unfortunately). She was wearing this horrible cherry lip gloss that I couldn’t get off of my face all day.”
“Draco? What’s so urgent?” Pansy called.
Harry dropped his teaspoon with a clatter. “What?”
"Let's just say it's not exactly a shock."
Harry chewed on the inside of his cheek, trying to not let his annoyance show. "If you'd let me finish, I could tell you." He sighed. "I suffered from nightmares. More often than not, I was scared to sleep and have to face the monsters I thought I'd killed."
Narcissa searched his face for a moment, before nodding silently. She walked away, collecting a fresh glass of champagne. “If I may have everyone’s attention.” She called loudly. The crowd quieted. “I would like to express how proud I am of my son.” She turned towards them. “My dearest Draco, through your hard work and dedication, you have built yourself a thriving business. You should be proud of what you have earned.” She raised her glass.
Draco laughed, a loud, hearty laugh. "Fucking hell, you don't have to ask me twice."
“If you ask me nicely, I can give you a black eye.” Potter quipped back.
Draco smirked, wrapping his arms around Potter's neck. It was his turn to lean into his ear. "Just wait until you see what else is impressive."
“Morning, Harry. Didn’t expect to see you today.” Paeson’s voice was more feminine than her appearance.
"Next time, when you're ordering just the one drink, try paying with one of these." Draco looked down to where Potter was waving a note with a 5 on it. Draco sniffed and grabbed the money and wallet back from him.
-----
Harry looked down at the child on his lap, his usual raven curls now interrupted by streaks of white blond hair. “Oh for Merlin’s sake." He cursed quietly, before casting a stubborn scowl at Malfoy. "Of course he likes you so much.” He sighed. Flashbacks of the day he realised Teddy could morphe flashed through his mind, specifically the silky white blond strands on his head. It suddenly all made sense.
"Impressive accuracy, Malfoy."
The sound of raucous laughter drew Draco's attention to the furthest corner of the bar, where a group of young people sat squished into a booth, cheering and toasting. Squinting his eyes, Draco could make out the all-too-familiar mop of curls belonging to Harry Potter. And yes, next to him sat Weasley and Granger, and on his other side sat the younger Weasley and Luna. Dragging his eyes back to Potter, Draco felt his stomach flip in a way that certainly wasn't the alcohol. Potter had filled out since school, and his dark hair had grown out, slipping over his eyes every time he laughed too hard. He now sported a trimmed beard, and as much as Draco wanted to think he looked like a vagabond, he had to admit that he actually looked rather handsome, and far too sexy for his liking. His brown skin held a pleasant flush, and as Draco watched, he spilled a drop of his beer on his tatty blue t-shirt, earning him a playful punch from the younger Weasley. They exchanged smiles and Draco felt his heart tighten.
“Speaking of, how’s little Teddy?”
Minute amounts of Foxglove in each of the pills would kill him slowly, and no one would know why.
And this is not healthy, it can’t be. Progress is healthy, moving on is healthy. And perhaps just imagining you reading this will contribute towards that.
Malfoy looked back down at him, seemingly only now taking in Harry’s sprawled form. He offered a hand and Harry took it without thinking. His hand was warm, and somehow familiar. He lifted him up, and Harry immediately looked away.
"I could say the same about you." He flipped them over. He didn't know what was better, Potter leaning over him or Potter underneath him. They crashed their lips together again, a delicious battle of dominance ensuing.
"Oh, um, would you like to go on a date, Malfoy?"
Draco released his grip like his hands had been scorched and ran them through his hair. “Potter.” He cleared his throat. “Please accept my apologies. I should have been watching where I was going.”
The blond spun on the spot, narrowing his eyes at the man before him. “Watch your mouth, jolie garçon. Nice, is that what you call insulting someone?” Merlin, there was nothing quite like the feeling of antagonising Harry James Potter.
"Bourton-on-the-water, I came here once as a child and was mesmerised by how clear the water was."
Harry had been hoping for Hermione, or maybe Ron, but as his gaze settled on Ginny sitting next to the common room fireplace, he realised that maybe she could help too. The younger Gryffindor glanced up from her copy of Quidditch Weekly, looking Harry up and down.
Draco laughed, letting his son tickle him before scooping him up. "I surrender!" He kissed his forehead.
“I told you I’m honest.” He shrugged, a devilish glint in his eye. “Just don’t go telling that snake of yours. If he really is like me, he won’t stop telling you he told you so.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He squeezed her hand. "So? It still upset you."
They walk into the entrance and Potter gives his name, which is given no exceptional notice as is the normal response. Muggles, Draco thinks, so blissfully unaware. Potter follows the waitress to the table and Draco happily stares at his pert arse.
