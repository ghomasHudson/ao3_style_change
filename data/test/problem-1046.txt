"They argued," she says at last. "Draco always adored his father, and used to listen to every word. I think it was very difficult for Lucius, to have Draco suddenly withdraw. I think Lucius expected everything to be the same after the war...but after the battle, Draco wouldn't talk to us. There was just so much distance, and it felt like Draco was so close to just leaving completely...Lucius took it badly. He told Draco to pull himself together. I'm afraid he became quite angry with Draco. But the angrier he became, the more Draco retreated..."
"Stay," Draco repeats, letting go of Harry's hand and stepping away. He holds up the keycard. "You were going to leave, weren't you?"
He gets into the car and drives all the way out to Godric's Hollow, a three-hour journey. He doesn't mind. Time and distance is all relative now. He looks at some of the properties for sale. There's a cottage on the outskirts of the village, but he's not immediately drawn to it. He'll know home when he sees it, he thinks.
But all he can think about how close he came to never looking back. To never flicking his eyes up to the rear-vision mirror.
He wakes up once, just before dawn. There's a faint grey light filtering through the windows, casting weak shadows through the room. The sun is only just beginning to rise, he thinks.
"Anyway, it's true, isn't it?" Ron says shamelessly. "Ginny's been unbelievably busy, really throwing herself into Quidditch lately..."
He takes his leave then. He'll visit again, and bring up her previous marriage then. Speaking of it now won't get him anywhere, he senses; Astoria has withdrawn from her initial welcome.
"Was it stress?" Hermione asks. "I know they've offered you that promotion to Head Auror, and — oh, Harry," she adds with sudden misery. "Your supervisor has spent the last three weeks frantically trying to contact you. I...I don't think you'll get the Head Auror position now."
These days he felt something new, trembling in the wind like a gold autumn leaf. Like a red paper heart.
It's taken her this long — nearly three months — to completely search the manor, investigating every item, every room, to make sure no possible time-turner hid within. If the time-turner had gone with Draco, rather than being left behind, surely Draco would have hidden it at the manor.
"Oh, thank Merlin," Astoria says, sinking into the chair beside Harry. "Oh, thank Merlin. All this time..." She looks around the room, as if expecting to find Draco there, smiling at her. "Where is he?"
“I'm worried about him,” Draco cut in urgently. “He's never left like this before, without a word or warning, and I'm worried about where he'll go — ”
"In any case," Narcissa says, drawing a long thread of red through the eye of a needle, "I assure you that all of Draco's possessions are in those boxes."
"And yet here I am." She speaks politely, evenly, without a trace of coldness or resentment in her voice, and Harry is hit by the similarity between her tone and that of Draco in the owlery. Both of them have had something struck from their voices since the war, Harry thinks. That polite deference that seems heavy as silence, blank as white walls, like one person in an empty room.
“A clean cauldron is the key to success,” Slughorn said briskly, strolling around the room and peering into various cauldrons. “Though a few specks of grime or dirt may not matter in minor potions, the Panacis demands a completely clean cauldron.”
"You've got a scar," Draco observes and Harry, surprised, follows Draco's gaze. The streetlight faintly shines silver on Harry's skin, picking out the thread of letters.
The easy thing about being an Auror, Harry thinks, is that if he looks at a picture and doesn’t see what he wants, he changes the picture. He can start new surveillance, or interrogate a different suspect, or use other informants.
It feels strange to be back in the apartment again. It takes him ages to find his keys, and longer yet to open the door. The air has a faintly dusty scent to it, Harry thinks as he flicks on the light switch, illuminating the white walls, the empty shelves, the kitchen counters without clutter. The curtains are all open and beyond the river, the city lights twinkle. Harry slowly sets his keys upon the empty counter.
"Very funny, Potter." Draco turns onto the coastal walking track. "My father was quite masterful at appearing cold and aloof, discouraging anybody approaching. I rather hoped to have a similar effect on people."
He turns the pages slowly. The photograph of Draco smiles up at him. He doesn't ever remember Draco smiling in the picture — he always looked so serious and solemn — but he smiles at Harry now, a faint but present smile.
July melts into August. Harry stands at the steps of the Ministry building, chin tilted upwards, gaze forward as ever. His feet ache. The high noon sun beats down upon him, creating a bead of sweat upon his brow. To his left, Ron is equally silent and still. Some distance away, the protestors roil and rage. The economy isn't going so well, and within the Ministry there have been talks of raising the tax-free threshold. A wizard in front of Harry angrily waves a sign about.
Astoria frowns, looking confused. "No. Why, is it important? He took an anti-pain potion sometimes, when he had a headache, but that's all."
Footsteps on the stairs. Harry glances up. Narcissa walks towards him, one hand trailing along the banister.
Somewhere, a clock chimes noon. Harry takes a breath, straightens up, and looks ahead. He pauses a moment, then knocks sharply three times on the door. There's a long pause, and then —
Blood spattered across his face and he woke, his wand clutched in one hand, the wand of someone long gone in the other. He was shaking and pale but he dressed with weak and trembling fingers. When he ate breakfast, his spoon clinked gently against his bowl as his hands shook.
apartments. But if I make the English National Team, who knows? At our next game, it might be — oh, I'm talking about work again." She laughs.
On Sunday morning, when Harry wakes, he reaches for his glasses and then his wand. His glasses are exactly where he left them; his wand isn't.
They explore the cliffs the next day. The lighthouse, Harry learns, is called the South Foreland Lighthouse. The lighthouse went out of service in 1988 and has been converted to a small museum, manned by an elderly guide. Draco lingers over a wall-mounted diagram of the electric light and is accosted by the guide, who latches with enthusiasm onto Draco's apparent interest and proceeds to deliver a fifteen-minute lecture on carbon arc lamps. Harry, though greatly amused, takes pity on Draco and rescues him.
"Then stay," Draco says, and Harry — gaze dropping to Draco's mouth — takes a moment to catch up to the words.
"Oh, I forget. You still have at least seven pages of Quidditch Weekly left to pore over," Draco retorts, but there's no malice to his words and Harry just laughs.
He almost smiled but the Shadow stayed. He sat, silent and alone, and not a sound could be heard except for the clink-clink-clink of a spoon against a bowl.
When he returns to the room, Draco is dressed and looking out the window, watching the raindrops race each other along the glass pane. Harry is strongly reminded of that day in the apartment, when Draco first spoke to him.
“Quiet,” Hermione says distractedly, and Harry, unable to stand still, jumps to his feet and begins pacing endlessly. For the next few minutes, all he can hear is his own footsteps and the occasional turn of a page. “I remember now,” Hermione murmurs. “Let’s see...it really represents a form of phase space, that’s the key...the three rules...do not interfere with the nature of causality...” She looks up at Harry, her eyes bright.
Harry doesn't want to think about the price he'll have to pay. So it's self-preservation that makes him shake his head, refusing to look at Draco, keeping his eyes locked on the kitchen counter as he replies. "I think you were right, actually. We couldn't be friends." He doesn't dare look up, opting instead to carefully stir a teaspoon of sugar into his tea. He watches the tiny grains slowly dissolve. The silence stretches on for a long time before Draco speaks.
He walks up the narrow path to the front door, ducking beneath a trellis of roses coloured a soft pink, as if summer has faded them, and knocks twice on the door.
"I'll never get parallel parking right," Harry mutters. Sometimes he's been tempted to use space-squeezing charms, but so far he's resisted the urge.
“Just don’t say the words ‘Death Eater’, ‘Dad’, ‘ferret’, or ‘battle’ around him,” Seamus said, slapping a card down.
He takes his key from his pocket. Every noise is amplified in the empty corridor: the faint jangle of the keys, the scrape of metal in the deadlock. The door swings open and he steps inside, noting the apartment is the same way he left it. The curtains are wide open, the setting sun casting the apartment in a gentle amber glow. He walks from room to empty room. The spare bedroom still has a glass of water on the bedside table, half empty.
Astoria pours the tea. "I often said that to him, in a roundabout way. I'd joke that he was driving everywhere to try and find a place that didn't exist."
“Ignore them," Narcissa said, smiling, but it was a thin smile that trembled and slipped. "Focus on your education. People...people will forget..."
She steps inside. The wards shimmer for a moment, then accept her as someone who means no harm. She looks around, eyes flicking once around the room, but Harry doubts she's prying. She seems to be looking for a chair instead, but there are no overstuffed armchairs or cosy sofas in this sparse apartment. There's only the row of stools by the island bench, and a glass-topped dining table with two dining chairs on each side of it.
"Maybe he was getting it resized because of recent weight loss," Hermione says, and Harry wishes he'd thought of that.
When he Floos back to the apartment, he sees the Renault Mégane keycard sitting on the counter. Well, Draco has to come back for that, at least.
They leave their little cottage behind and head into the fields and woods. Through the little wooden gate, along the meandering paths, over the little brook. Draco likes to stride through the tall grass, letting the raindrops catch on his sleeves. Harry ambles along at a much slower rate, though sometimes he abruptly leaps into action and chases Draco until both of them are soaked, and when he catches him, Draco puts his nose in the air and says loftily, “I wasn’t playing, Potter,” and stalks away. Later, he hides near the grove of hazel trees and waits for Harry to walk beneath them. Then, with a flick of his wand, all the water drops from the trees. It happens every time, but Harry still walks under the trees and acts outraged by the treacherous ambush, and Draco smiles the exact same way he did the very first time he did it.
They come home in the same way they draw breath, or take a step, or glance up at the stars when they're beneath the night sky. Coming home is a journey learned by rote, committed to the memory of their heart. Take a turn here, a corner there, ten steps to the front door — and they're home.
Harry never held much with speaking to the unconscious or the dead. His final experience with death — when he held the Resurrection Stone — taught him the finality of death. Speaking to someone who clearly isn't there is pointless.
Harry doesn't want to talk about Draco Malfoy. He stares at the condensation on the butterbeer bottle and waits a long moment before speaking.
In Landewednack, he finds a boutique guesthouse close to the coastal walking track. It appears to be of a markedly higher quality than the other places they've stayed. The receptionist chatters brightly to Harry about the weather and gives him the key for the room.
"Yes," Harry says, but truth be told he's hardly paying attention to the conversation now. He doesn't think he's ever been this close to Draco and he wonders how he never noticed the faint flecks of slate-blue hiding in his grey irises.
Hermione reappears with three mugs of tea, handing one to Harry. “How do you know he’s not coming back?” she asks gently.
A footstep behind him. He turns. A young child — no more than one and a half years old, he'd guess — is clutching a half-eaten strawberry and staring at him.
"Rite of passage. Everyone's first licence looks awful. At least you can legally drive now," he adds. Harry's graduated from the driveway to actual roads, as the country lanes surrounding Astoria's home are generally bereft of traffic.
The wandlight casts a gentle glow over the Hogwarts textbooks, the bottle of aged whiskey, the origami rose the colour of a faded pink heart. Harry reaches for the first textbook. He hadn't looked at this book last time, on account of it being very firmly tied shut with a length of rope.
"Forget your obligations," Harry repeats. "You're not going back because you need to attend whatever social affairs Narcissa has organised or because Astoria's made appointments. I remember what you said to me once: 'What's the point, sitting in a box going only where other people take you?'. It's the reason you left, and it will be the reason you leave again."
When he was seventeen and thought he'd feel that way forever. That he'd always want to be an Auror, because being an Auror was just like dodging spells and chasing people and spending cosy nights arguing over strategies with his two best friends. And he'd come home, exhausted but happy at the end of each day, stepping through the door of a little cottage somewhere in the countryside — something ramshackle, like the Burrow, or ancient like Hogwarts — and Ginny would be there, smiling, forever young. In his dreams, he was seventeen forever. Funny, that. He forgot to age himself, or Ginny. He forgot about Ginny's own ambitions and choices, and he forgot about the practicalities of a London apartment, and he'd forgotten how Aurors weren't needed much when there wasn't a war. He'd forgotten all the little details, the cold whispers of reality.
“That one, sir?” the shopkeeper asks Malfoy. Harry glances up and watches Malfoy nod at the plain-looking barn owl.
“I’m going to propose to you, spend six months planning an elaborate wedding, pay ludicrous amounts for a caterer and live music, go on a honeymoon to Italy, have an amazing time, and
A car passes them, headlights ghosting across the Renault Mégane, illuminating Draco for a moment. Then the car continues on and they are cast into darkness once more.
He follows the signs until he's slowly crawling along a narrow road toward the Lizard Lighthouse. He can hear the distant rush of waves, breaking in a ceaseless rhythm against the cliffs. Harry parks the car and pauses for a moment. It's in the heart of winter, and he's in the middle of nowhere at two a.m, listening for the sound of a wave breaking, listening for the sound of another human voice. Listening to the wind blow southerly, southerly, from the edge of mainland Britain, listening to it whistle through the cracks in the rocks and the secret hollows and coves along the coast.
He's hoping Draco will be standing by the apartment door. But he knows it won't happen. And as long as he's not there yet, still standing in his office, he doesn't know. Draco might be there, or he might not. Schrödinger's Draco, Harry thinks with a very wry smile.
, Ron had said once, and Harry had laughed. Seeing Draco Malfoy apologise, they had agreed, would be one of the most victorious moments in their lives.
Some time after sunrise, it begins to rain. Even the warmth of summer cannot deter the low clouds rolling in across the grey horizon. Harry goes for an early morning run, a habit leftover from his Auror training. He comes back, slicked with mud and sweat, and takes a hot shower. Draco is still asleep, he thinks, and he goes downstairs to breakfast. Typical that after Draco's returned, it rains. All this nice weather and all he did was walk moodily along cliffs and think of Draco, and now he's finally happy, it's pouring.
They drive on the next day, but not far — they stop somewhere between Poole and Exmouth, spending three days in the small parish of Salmouth-on-Sea. Harry doesn't mind. Sometimes they walk together along the beaches — so empty and windswept after Brighton's busy bustle — and other times Draco disappears by himself, to look at the shops or follow the coastal walks or visit the old lighthouse.
"Better," Ginny says, her eyes bright with excitement. "Harry...I've done it. I've made the English National Team."
Out here, in East Devon, the signs are more subtle. The smell of mince pies and gingerbread waft from the local bakeries, and the sweet shops are lined with bon-bons and pastel-coloured sugar mice. As Harry drives along the main road of a village, he sees the strings of fairy lights decorating homes and, every now and again, a carefully-decorated Christmas scene in a shop window.
"You're not wearing your wedding ring," Narcissa observes, and Harry glances at Malfoy's hand. Narcissa doesn't miss a thing, he thinks wryly.
Winter slowly melts to spring. Ginny sends Harry a postcard from France, where she’s visiting the French National Team to gauge their performance. A letter follows soon after: she’s purchased a studio apartment closer to central London.
"This is a dream, another dream," Harry says, more to convince himself than actually respond to Draco.
Astoria's eyes flicker to his, and Harry's startled by her expression. Surprise, he thinks, and...caution? Perhaps even a tinge of suspicion...
Several expressions shift over Narcissa's face, difficult to observe in the flickering firelight. She drops her hand from the necklace and changes topics. "Well, seeing as you're so interested in portraits, you'll be sitting for your next one in a few months. I thought the conservatory would make a nice backdrop."
Or maybe he's not driving, maybe he's searching. For Draco, for a memory, for a state of mind, for home, for anywhere and everywhere.
“Draco...Draco never had a time-turner,” she says, one hand reaching for her necklace. “But...Lucius did.”
"Kind of makes me wish I'd grown up in Wiltshire," Harry comments. Draco looks at him, then glances back across the field, to that crisp horizon of gold meeting blue.
"Narcissa and Draco were both acquitted. The past doesn't matter to my parents, anyway. They just wanted to see me happy, and they adored Draco. During our courtship, he became my closest friend."
Harry leans back slightly as the waiter places another glass of rum in front of him, waiting until he's gone away again before lifting the glass and taking a long sip. They receive a reprieve when their meals arrive, at least, and can occupy themselves with eating. Ginny orders another glass of wine and Harry tries a twelve-year whiskey, then follows it with Scottish single malt. The waiter probably considers him an alcoholic, Harry thinks, and by the end of the meal he's delightfully fuzzy-headed and only half-listening to Ginny's Quidditch strategies. Having had too much to drink to trust his Disapparating skills, Harry flags a passing taxi to take him and Ginny home. Ginny seems to enjoy the trip, finding it rather amusing when Harry has to run to the apartment and frantically search for his cache of Muggle money to pay the driver.
could refer to Malfoy feeling resentful of the way his family naturally led him to the Dark Arts, or the way Voldemort forced his hand, or it could have nothing to do with the war at all. Maybe it's his marriage, Harry thinks critically. Maybe Astoria wanted a divorce and Malfoy didn't, but either way he'd end up having to concede. It would explain the absence of Malfoy's wedding ring.
He should go home, he thinks. Buy a new apartment. Buy a hundred apartments, it doesn't matter. They all look the same. Go and return to his Auror job. Arrest Dark magic users. Greedy criminals, pureblood zealots, desperate teenagers, people needing quick money. It doesn't matter. They all look the same.
He pauses. "I...I just want to say I understand now. What you meant when you said that solving cases isn't a game of Quidditch, and people aren't snitches."
“Running on air. You said being in Draco’s head was like running on air.” She pauses. “The first person who ever used time-travel — a witch in the seventeenth century — said that travelling through time was like running on air.”
Draco had porridge. His hands were shaking again, and Harry gently took the spoon from his hands, moved the bowl away from him. He looked at the letters engraved into Draco’s left hand.
He was good at that part. Very good in the field. But, as his supervisors explained cautiously, he was not good at the investigative side of it.
He recognised it immediately. His wand. Not the one in his hand now, that Ollivander had so grudgingly made him. No. His faithful wand that had been taken from him so many months ago.
Or maybe it's not funny, maybe it's just depressing and makes Harry feel like going back to the Renault Mégane and driving, driving, driving, until Draco comes back again and then everything will be all right.
"It doesn't look like a car key," Harry says defensively. Perhaps it's new technology? He wishes he'd kept up with the Muggle world. "I mean, how do you open the car door with this?"
And he feels nothing inside, like the war has cut away everything that used to make him human and and left nothing but a paper cut-out.
"Just dropped one of the junior Auror trainees off at St Mungo's — he'd been practising duels and accidentally replaced his own fingers with carrots. Thought I'd ask about Malfoy while I was there."
To his surprise, Ron came down the stairs, looking at Draco searchingly. His clear blue eyes seemed to scan Draco's face, a search for emotion. Draco felt nothing but fear and worry and something worse, something shadowy and ominous.
Astoria's worry is quickly turning to fury. Harry listens to her rant about the injustice of it all; he went through the exact same cycle of emotion and so he simply nods along sympathetically until Astoria has stalked away to furiously accost Healers. Harry also went through that particular phase. In fifteen or twenty minutes, he thinks, she'll reappear and collapse, defeated, into the chair again.
“I'm sorry, I know it's late, and I didn't know who else to turn to — ” Draco began, his throat painful with suppressed fear.
It's nighttime. The stars are high and clear above him, crisply white like winter's first snow. He's standing on the edge of a cliff, staring out at waves rolling in like low thunder, breaking against the cliff face and sending sea foam whirling around the darkly gleaming rocks.
Harry frowns slightly. "Having problems sleeping?" He takes a few steps closer and Draco stares at him for a moment. There's something distant in Draco's eyes, Harry thinks, and it worries him. "Is everything all right?"
He returns to Landewednack, driving through the narrow streets. Past the church with the kissing gate, the small cottages, the bridge crossing a small inlet. The guesthouse — a restored country estate — sits at the end of a meandering lane, set against the backdrop of the Cornish coast. Although the night is still young, most of the windows are dark. The other guests will already be asleep, preparing for early beach walks and trips to the nearby coves.
Hermione is very cautious around Astoria and stiffly introduces herself, but Astoria's frankness soon wins Hermione over.
When Harry was very small, he used to think cars were like spaceships and they could take him anywhere. He would race along the milky way, slip along the curve of the moon, run along the exploding stars and come to rest among the cold, glittering nebulas.
Astoria's mouth looks like a bruised petal, Harry thinks. She shakes her head. "I can't go back in there. I can't
older. Our son is twenty-two years old, Lucius. Not some disobedient child to be lectured and sent away."
Harry paused, absently eating another crust that Draco suspected he had saved specifically for flicking purposes.
"That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that I trust you to tell the difference between a normal dream and...a different one."
But before they know it, Malfoy has finished the sale and left. Hermione gives Harry an apologetic look.
Before he leaves, Harry carves the coordinates for Landewednack into a fence post, hoping that if Draco returns to the spot he will be able to locate Harry. Still, it's a long and lingering departure. Harry keeps thinking, I'll wait just another minute. And then, when the minute passes without sign of Draco, he thinks just another minute. At long last he leaves. But even as he starts the engine and turns the indicator on, he's vainly hoping for Draco to reappear.
“No,” Harry said. “You couldn’t be dark.” He drew his wand across the graffiti as though rubbing it out and sure enough the words slowly evaporated. “Maybe you were meant to be light.”
Harry didn’t seem scared of anything though. He was Harry. Draco could not imagine him crying or sobbing into a little mess or curling up in a ball or holding a wand to his head and screaming that he was going to end it all. He was just Harry. He played Quidditch very well and handed in all his essays on time and had two best friends and was nice to people, even the really rude ones. Draco wanted to be like that. He wanted to smile at people or hand in his essays and have teachers smile at him or just get out of his stupid little mind. Sometimes it felt like he was suffocating sometimes. Like he was walking underwater, going nowhere, frozen in an Impedimenta curse. Moving towards something that he could never reach or at least could not reach in time.
"There wasn't much speculation about who cast it," Ron says. "I mean, there was nobody there when we arrived. Just Lucius Malfoy, of course, and nobody else. To be honest, we all assumed Lucius cast it himself in a moment of doubt. Probably got sick of hiding for so long. Course, he probably regretted it the second we all showed up."
If Harry went missing, who would comb through the possessions of his life, and what would they think? He has nothing in this apartment. Most of his possessions are kept in his Gringotts vault.
At first, he's still angry and begins mentally preparing the long rant he plans to deliver upon Draco's return.
it. I hated him, and I hated Aunt Bellatrix, and the Carrows, and Rowle, and all the rest of them. Every last one. I couldn't stand speaking to my own father, and I was afraid of Greyback — and even more afraid of Nagini. Every moment, I hated it." Draco starts to laugh. "I hated it," he repeats one last time, still laughing, and Harry looks at him with concern.
Her brow creases, if only for a moment. Then she glances at the file and remembers. "Oh, Harry," she says, looking exasperated. "They didn't assign you
Except maybe in a Renault Mégane, burning down the M27 at midnight, tracing the lines of relationships across the land.
It will take two hours to drive to the manor, but Harry doesn't feel particularly concerned about this. He'll just be two hours late, that's all.
“I know it's strange, but this feels a little like first year,” Harry said. Like it was their first trip on the train all over again...
Half an hour later, they're slowly walking back to the Renault together. Harry can feel his pulse slowing, like a car engine cooling, and his breathing becoming slow and even again.
Harry studies the photograph. If he looks closely enough, he can see a faint smile on Draco's face. He looks younger than he should, Harry thinks. Or perhaps it's just the first time he's seen Draco smiling since he began this case.
" — know him?" Astoria shakes her head. "Like the officer first on the case. He thought he knew Draco too. 'Oh, I know the Malfoys,' he said. 'We'll find whatever overpriced villa your husband is holidaying at and drag him back home.' Like Draco was a spoiled child — "
"No! Well — just a couple of glasses. Would you like something to drink? Oh, don't worry, I know how you like your alcohol. There's a bottle of oak-aged whiskey in the cellar."
"To anywhere, to everywhere," Draco says. "Why'd you fix my Renault? Learn to drive? Come with me on this trip? To Dover, to Brighton, to anywhere?"
Narcissa gazes at him for a long moment, then clears her throat. As if responding to an unspoken command, the anxious-looking house-elf reappears by her side.
"Oh, is that how you approached this matter? Just wandered past him and said — with a mouthful of sandwich, I imagine — 'having problems with Ginny, then'?"
And Merlin, it feels so close to being perfect — they're sitting here, bickering like they used to be, but there's a faint familiarity that was never there before — and Harry just wants to stay here for a little while longer. Just a little while, until he can forget everything else in his life.
Luna however seemed eather unaffected by the depression like fog that seemed to be seeping over everyone. She went about her way, eating breakfast and chattering about some species she discovered while camping last summer. Her little ray of pure sunshine brightened everyones mood considerably, but they were still rather quiet.
"Bloody Hell Potter, watch where you are going next time!" Draco snapped, knowing that it was entirely his own fault. Not even he could have stopped fast enough to not crash into someone like that. But, no way he'd ever fess up. Potter just smirked.
Four honestly couldn't come fast enough. Harry was just waiting in excitement to see if Malfoy had changed his mind. He had to win this. He wasn't sure why. For pride? No Harry didn't really care that much about "pride". Maybe it was just so he could shove it in that gits face that Harry beat him at another thing? No.. He did that plenty at quidditch. Harry wasn't really a thrill seeker. It found him. Minus quidditch of course. But everyone has their hobbies, his just happened to be life threatening and exhilarating.
Draco was honestly grateful for the jacket. He was actually quite cold and Potter's jacket was warm and cozy. He didn't even mind the faint scent of cologne that clung to the jacket, surrounding him. Draco quickly zipped the jacket up and glared at Potter.
When Draco fought through his shock and finally pulled away, Harry was just as flushed as Draco felt.
Crookshanks was sleeping peacefully on Harry's bed while his humans were out eating dinner. He figured he'd keep the bed warm while they were out and he and Harry could share later. Provided Harry kept to his own inch of the bed this time.
Ron frowned. It had been almost four weeks since the war. He understood that everyone worked differently but he thought that he'd waited AGES to try to get help.
By the time that Draco finished talking they had arrived at Hogsmead. They both stopped, trying to decide where to go. They looked at each other as if asking the other their opinion.
"I'm fine, just a headache. I've been sleeping for that long? Tell me I at least made it to breakfast?" He joked, unsuprised when Hermione pointed her wand and muttered a spell. Feeling greatly relieved that the headache was gone, he waited smiling for a response. She avoided his gaze and shifted awkwardly.
Sighing, Harry accepted the offered hand and stood up. Brushing the pastries off, he realized Malfoy was watching him, that small smirk still plastered on his face.
He flicked his tail towards the astronomy tower and watched Draco find Harry's splattered remains. The horror on Draco's face made Crookshanks want to feel bad for him.. but. He just didn't really... care?
He could take Harry up this very tower, at night. Stars shining above them. They could lay down and look at the formations and talk about the shapes and constellations in the sky. Harry could comment on how beautiful the stars were. Draco would say his view was much better. Maybe he could hold Potters stupid hand and look into his eyes. He could lean closer and he wou-
In the Gryffindor dormitories, Hermione slowly levitated Harry into his bed and walked quietly downstairs. It was time to wait. And then the lies begin.
If he were being perfectly honest, Draco would be ok with never coming out. Staying hidden forever in the dark. He wasn't a Gryffindor. He wasn't brave. He wasn't fearless. Draco was terrified.
"I support your decision?" He said when Draco started to look rather crestfallen. Draco watched him for a moment longer and then his face split open in a large grin.
When Harry woke up, there was a crowd of boys around him. Neville, Dean, Seamus, and Ron. They all had faces that said they were trying really hard not to laugh, he looked at them, Thoroughly confused. "What's so funny?" He asked , honestly oblivious to their source of amusement. They all stared at him, then looked at each other.
Harry wrinkled his nose and nodded his head, not really putting much thought into what it might be. He was more flattered by the arm Draco was trying to snake around his waist to pull him closer. But then again, he was drunk.
Classes were cancelled today for some reason. The teachers hadn't told them anything except that there would be no class today and there would be another day to go to Hogsmead except all students were required to. Which was odd. But then, immediately afterwards they had all left. Ron was eventually done eating so they went to the Gryffindor common room and just goofed off.
He proudly strutted back to the castle and went to find his favorite male. Harry had always treated him well and Crookshanks was excited to share a meal with him.
They walked in silence for a moment, Ron just admiring the ease of transition in his day. He then realized he should say something.
The summer before their last year at Hogwarts, after the Great Battle, Ginny and Harry tried out a relationship. But it just fell apart. Neither was quite sure why, it just didn't work. Ginny thought it was because one side wanted it more than the other. But the truth was, after years of yearning after Harry, when she finally got him? She was disappointed. In her mind, she built him up to be someone else entirely but, the more time she spent with him, the more she loved him, as a brother. There was still some romantic feelings between the two, just not enough on other end to go through it again.
"Ron! Yeah it's been ages hasn't it? You kind of disappeared after Hogwarts. It's nice to crash into you." Luna laughed lightly at her own pun as she finished mopping the coffee off her own shirt and gathered all the tissues they used. He watched, transfixed as she put them all on the sidewalk and set them on fire with a flick of her wand.
"There once was a kindly old wizard-" he cuts off as Harry whips his head around to stare at him in complete shock.
Breakfast at Hogwarts was never dull or unappetizing.  Everything was simply cooked perfectly. It was refreshing to be able to have as much food as he wanted. He often thought back to his time at the Dursleys. He knew exactly WHERE they were, it was just a matter of him not caring at the moment. They were terrible to him and for the moment he was enjoying their absence.
Turns out Harry did. He was holding the gaze one moment and then was overcome with the desire to kiss Draco. Just a light peck. He was still hesitant. Didn't want to break this new thing between them. But regardless, the need to be close to Draco was a little overwhelming. He kinda just wanted to be around him all the time. Which was a ridiculous idea, but still a fun one.
Harry shook off the errant train of thought as he saw Mal- Draco approaching. The poor boy looked wretched. It was obvious that his firewhiskey didn't agree with him. Draco walked over and plopped down in the seat beside Harry, not thinking twice about which table he was at, the lack of Blaise being at the table, or his extremely messy clothes and hair. He just. Continued eating.
Harry was shocked that Malfoy said yes to him, again. He supposed he was trying to win as much as Harry was. So Harry did as he promised and took off his jacket and draped it over Malfoys shoulders. who then put his arms through the sleeves and zipped it up.
"Harry, what happened? Before I share what I have figured out I would like to hear what you remember." She looked back to where Blaise sat, watching the both of them, his brow furrowed in worry. Harry shook his head and explained what had happened, how he couldn't remember a fight that had happened or breakfast this morning, just left over feelings of Rage with no source and the snakey feeling. Hermione nodded sympathetically and picked up where he left off.
"I don't remember, but I sure am hungry!" Harry said, grabbing Draco's hand and skipping into the great hall.
Brushing his thumb over Harry's knuckles, Draco looked up and froze, they were already in the Great Hall and Draco hadn't even noticed. He was too busy being transfixed by the little scar on Harry's knuckle.
"Great, uh, yeah, cool. We can do this. However slow you need. Just make sure to let me know as we go." Harry stuttered.
Eating his sandwich slowly, he walked out of the house and made his way towards the edge of the protective wards. He'd forgotten how bright the sun was, how fresh the air could be. All of a sudden he felt a bit like a starving man. He stopped walking and took a moment to just gulp down fresh air and look around. Nothing had changed. On the outside everything looked the same. But all of the people were beyond destroyed.
When she observed Draco Malfoy and Mr. Zabinni begin to sit at her houses table, she immediately knew what was going on. As did Horace. When it became more evident that Zabinni and Granger had become a couple, Horace had immediately suggested a bet to see who Draco might end up with. The most obvious choice was Harry Potter but was it too much to hope for?
Purring, Crookshanks nuzzled Harry's face and allowed the male to resituate them. The only problem was Harry was taking up like. Half the space. This was against the rules. The male KNEW he was only allowed 25%. The twin sized bed was MORE than enough for them to both sleep comfortably in the space they needed.
"Hey uh Harry? Your boyfriend is asking after you downstairs. I told 'em I'd fetch you." Dean said, startling the poor guy. Harry turned red and ran past him muttering "He is not my boyfriend" and Dean just smiled. Soon enough maybe.
He heard a small yelp as a blonde bundle crashed into him at warp speed. He felt two tiny hands brace themselves against his chest. He also felt a hot liquid being poured down his chest and pants.
Dean was next, his laughter was deep and loud, his knees buckled and he was rolling on the floor, holding his stomach and kicking his legs in the air.
"Hello, you're Ron yes? I am Dr. Meznoa. Do you want to share a little bit about why you're here?" Her voice was clear and so was her smile. Ron felt himself slowly relaxing into his chair. Then, Ron started to talk.
Draco jumped a little, taken aback. Then his vision narrowed as he realized what exactly must have happened last night while he was drinking. Draco hit on his formerly sworn enemy.
Draco pursed his lips and thought on it. He stared out at the view from the astronomy tower. If his father were still around, this would never have been an option. If Voldemort were still around, Draco would be a stain on the wall.
Harry exclaimed, clutching his head. He had fallen like a dumb oaf. The fall itself would've been fine if he hadn't hit his bloody head.
He was good-looking. Sure. But what did good looks have on a personality? On wild, kind, brave, charming, selfless, green eyes.. Wild hair.. Potter. . . Draco shook himself as his thoughts drifted off to Harry, he must be tired as hell and worrying about the dance that he damned himself to. Honestly, why did he even agree? He just looked into Potter's eyes and next thing you know, he was going to a dance.
Crookshanks stepped out from behind the pillar where he had been hiding. Waiting for Harry to finally be alone. It was time. Time to take revenge. Grabbing Draco's severed hand, Crookshanks flung it at the back of Harry's head as hard as he could.
Weeks passed and Ron slowly improved every day. A combination of therapy and seeing Luna twice to three times a week did wonders for his soul. He didn't especially like counseling. It was hard sometimes and Dr. Meznoa really got to a soul deep level with him. But he did love spending time with Luna. It was never forced and he never had to pretend around her.
"What type of low-life numbskull would want Harry Potter as their date to a ball? All he'd do is step on their feet!" Harry rolled his eyes -this was becoming a common occurence as an idea formed.
"No classes?.. Again?! What in the bloody hell are they doing?" Harry smiled and patted her back then walked to the Great Hall for breakfast. Already at the Gryffindor table were Blaise and Draco. Malfoy was a little flushed and Blaise was smiling and laughing. Harry walked over and sat down by Blaise, but far enough away that Hermione, who was right behind him, could sit as well. After greeting Blaise with a kiss that made Harry feel really good for his friend yet slightly awkward about watching. She seemed extremely happy.
Draco leaned in so close that his hot breath tickled Harry's ear and made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He was so close to him, close enough that if Harry turned his head, theyd be kissing
Harry's inner thoughts consisted of shitshitshitshitshit bloody hell what do I do now? Shitshitshit. He's never going to talk to me again.
Things just felt better. Ron felt more alive and honestly he owed it to the tiny little blonde he was currently hugging.
To an outsider, it seemed as though the two were coupling up. Admitting their feelings and going for it and such. Which was honestly quite shocking but it's not like strange things never happened. The professors who were watching were all whispering together, making bets about the two boys and when they would actually get together. Dumbledore just smiled knowingly from his portrait because in reality, they just started one big game of Chicken.
Groaning, he finally got up and walked downstairs. Hermione was curled up on the couch reading and to no ones suprise, Blaise was curled around her. He however, was sleeping. Harry took a moment to admire the irony of the picture. His rivals best friend was literally sleeping with his bestfriend. They were completely at ease with one another and created an absolutely perfect picture.
Draco was an absolute disaster. His father would NEVER have this. The poor man was probably rolling in his grave. His mother? She was so fragile these days he didn't know how she would take the news. That's only if he actually told her anyway.
"Alright. You?" He replied, watching Blaise shift in towards Hermione, almost like he was trying to protect her. But what je was trying to protect her from was beyond Harry.
When the boys were done belly-rolling, Harry walked down to go to breakfast and found Hermione groaning in the common room.
Pulling his hand out, he instead used it to smooth the curls back from Potters face. His scar was almost faded and added a bit of a rogue look to his face.
Potter slams Draco's door behind him and strides forward. For a second, Draco thinks Harry is going to attack him. But, before Draco had an inkling of what was going to happen, Potter was sitting cross legged on the bed beside him, his arms folded stubbornly on his chest. "I am not a slow reader." He insists "but if you are going to be such a pain in the arse about it, then i guess that you can read it to me."
Harry was completely unable to comprehend a world with out Draco Malfoy. It was much too much to bear. Kissing Draco's lips once, Harry ran out the doors of the dormitory and flung himself off the astronomy tower, flipping off Crookshanks with both hands all the way down. He had landed with a rather impressive splat when Draco sat up.
"So, about last night. Did you mean it?  Harry's voice was hesitant, unsure of what path he was headed down.
Harry frowned as he tried to get a read on the situation. If he were being honest, Malfoy looked super nervous. He was picking at one of the pastries and casting worried glances at Harry pretty often. Harry sighed, it was going to be up to him to start a conversation, wasn't it?
The relief was instantaneous. He wasn't sure why he'd been nervous at all about it. They'd already been dating for several weeks but for some reason he still felt a little nervous around her. The butterflies never truly settled. Nor would they ever. He had mentioned that to Luna once, and she jokingly said that those were the Nargles. He'd rolled his eyes and smiled.
After Harry's declaration and show of support, there was a lot of awkward silence at the table. Ron, who was all but forgotten, continued to be completely oblivious to the matter. Harry wasn't even sure if Ron knew Draco was THERE.
Draco was honestly shocked. Potter was an excellent story teller! And the fact that the bushy haired mudbl.. know-it-all saved his friend didn't really shock him. She did so enjoy trying to be better than everyone at everything. Draco was however, barely two points behind her. He was JUST as smart as she was. He just didn't flaunt it and the two points were only because he had to skip because his family pulled him out of school.
After breakfast, everyone else parted ways, Ron off to coordinate with Luna, Draco went to owl his mom and Harry? Harry went to go re-watch those dance shows so he could teach himself to dance.
Of course there were still nightmares. There would be for years. But they were easier now. He just had to remind himself it was over and it wasn't his fault.
The small blonde smiled back at him, she hadn't changed much. Albeit she now sported a messy bob but it very much so suited her.
"Oh. I'll get what she's getting." He said hurriedly. The man behind the counter smiled and totaled their costs. Ron pulled out his coin purse and payed, making sure to leave money for a decent tip. Being a hero payed well. Enough that he wanted to share.
Draco grit his teeth. Potter would give in. He knew it. You can't outbluff a Malfoy. So he simply took a deep breath and put on his charming smile.
"So, Harry, what did you and Malfoy do for your visit?" She asked, her head cocked to the side. She could feel Blaise tense around her, but she realized he was trying not to laugh. Harry looked at Draco and smirked, obviously about to try to embarrass the poor boy. But Draco spoke first, his words rushed because he wanted to get it out before Harry spread rumors.
Running his hands through his hair, he pulled the ends and tried to think. How exactly could he find out for sure if he was gay without telling anyone? Or much of anyone. He could go see Potter? That would probably end with Draco either pissing him off or earning a good round of confused doe-eyes and really not helping anything anyway.
Shrugging, he took a bite of his chicken and tuned back in to what his girlfriend was saying. Luna was by far the most entertaining storyteller he knew. One of the many reasons he adored the quirky blonde.
In Harry's opinion however, they were doing great, for another reason. He wasn't dancing for show right now. He was dancing for fun. And whether he liked to admit it or not, dancing with the flying ferret was fun. He made comments every time he made a mistake and practically dragged Harry across the dance floor. Everything he said was about 5x louder and with an echo here. So When he shouted "bloody hell", Harry almost fell down because he was laughing so hard. Malfoys offended look just made ever more so entertaining.
Butterworth shrugs. “Been a slow month. You can leave if you want. I’ll collect the sample and Glassbrook here will finish photographing the scene. Rest of the team will be along soon.”
Harry drops the clasp onto the middle of Hermione and Ron's dining table. Hermione stares at it, her eyes wide.
He walks to the bedroom and sets his messenger bag — stuffed full of files — on the floor. His heart slowly sinks again. Ginny is flurrying around the room, her red hair splaying around her in a vibrant splash of colour. She turns and grins at him, her freckles scrunching up like handfuls of sand.
Harry opens the car door, walking around the bonnet to join Draco on the other side. For a moment they stand together, gazing out across the fields of sunshine-yellow. A starling settles atop a fence-post, its wings fluttering in the warm afternoon sun; nearby, a grasshopper leaps from stalk to stalk. Harry studies the canola flowers, watching the petals sway slightly in a faint breeze. Draco leans back against the warm car and Harry can hear the engine ticking as it cools.
. The Cornish coastline rises like a ghost to greet Harry, and he can hear the winds blowing southerly through craggy cliffs, rushing along endless highways, whistling through the chains of empty swings in empty playgrounds.
"...and becomes disillusioned with imperialism after witnessing the cruelty and corruption of the greedy European colonialists, eventually becoming terrified of the darkness and the challenge to his world order that it represents."
And then, the second realisation rolls in like thunder when Ginny smiles and asks Harry what his big announcement is.
The silver bell chimes gently as Harry enters the shop, and he's struck by a profound sense of déjà vu. By the counter, the grey-haired shopkeeper glances up.
. People trying to come home, because coming home can sometimes be the hardest journey they'll ever make.
Harry shifts from one foot to another. The hair at the nape of his neck is curling damply as perspiration beads across his skin.
"I'm doing this for you and him, Narcissa. Draco may be angry now, but he will thank me when he's older."
Draco remained for a few minutes longer, rifling through his parcels from Hogsmeade and readjusting the weight. As he got up to leave, he realised his hands had not trembled once.
"You don't look very well," Butterworth says. "I hope you haven't come to work with a cold," he adds disapprovingly. There have been a number of highly contagious colds going around the Ministry.
"Thank you, Potter, for that literary criticism. Why don't you run along and finish reading the 'Top Ten Female Players' article in Quidditch Weekly?"
It was just the three of them in the early morning. They had started off as three dark smudges in the snow, wandering round in their frozen blue and white world. Now it was lighter, the snow glowing a soft pinky-orange under the rising sun and they were sharply-defined silhouettes, walking back towards the castle.
“Yes,” he said, his voice taut with barely-masked emotion. Hermione must have seen it in his eyes, in the way he was holding himself. He hated being so readable, so predictable. He managed a tight smile, feeling his hair curling at the nape of his neck, the rain making it damp and untamed.
"That's not too far away," Harry says, eyeing the overnight bag. Ginny pauses halfway through wrapping up her shinguards and looks apologetic.
"Wait," Harry says, and Draco pauses. Harry reaches into his pocket and throws the wand to Draco; he catches it deftly, staring at it. "There you go," Harry says, trying to make his voice sound light and casual. "Couldn't give you a time-turner, but I gave you back your wand."
He turns away from the window, moving closer to the middle of the back seat, and looks at the rear-vision mirror. Draco is gazing ahead, his mouth small and serious, his grey eyes seeming to search the road ahead.
Draco sat in it to see if he’d feel any different. He looked down and saw the words carved deep into the desk.
On this particular occasion, however, they are interrupted long before the cosy fireplace and little glances. Just as Harry’s meandering into the hazel grove with a carefully manufactured expression of casual blandness, a voice carries clear across the field.
Harry's first driving lesson is on Wednesday, at 4pm. He arrives at Astoria's punctually; Matthew arrives late from work and barrels through the front door with arms full of blueprints.
"I'll give you the memory," she says at last. "If only because, for a moment, I thought it was Draco returning tonight, when I saw that car. And you gave me that one moment, if nothing else, so I'll give you the memory."
"You are being very ungrateful, Draco," Lucius is saying angrily. "I have spent quite an amount of money preparing the estate in Crete — "
He tries, unsuccessfully, to wake Draco again, but Draco seems completely unresponsive. Almost comatose.
He could question the shopkeeper, but it's unlikely he could give any further details. Besides, it's been five years, and Draco Malfoy was simply another customer.
They lapse into silence again, but twenty minutes later, as they're halfway across a bridge over the River Ouse, Draco speaks again, not lifting his gaze from the window.
Harry waits a long moment, wand held high, his heart hammering, then crosses over to the sliding door, staring at it carefully. There's nothing there. No crack in the glass, no mark, not even a fingerprint.
He pours himself a glass of Irish whiskey and stands on the balcony, looking over the London skyline. He remembers how Ginny's eyes had lit up, the city lights reflected in her pupils, when they first stood at this window and looked at the view.
Draco still hasn't woken, a Healer's assistant tells Harry as she fusses about the charts at the end of Draco's bed. There's not much he can do.
“It’s all right,” Harry says quickly. “Narcissa, if you know anything about this, you need to tell me right now. I think Draco’s used a time-turner and something’s gone terribly wrong.”
"Refreshments," Narcissa says, and the house-elf bows low before vanishing again. Narcissa sweeps away, leaving Harry to follow until they enter a formal sitting room. Harry looks around the room: there's plenty of places to sit, but he opts to walk over to the window. Narcissa is silent, but Harry doesn't feel the need to speak. He waits, staring out over the manor grounds until the house-elf appears again. He doesn't turn from the view, waiting as he hears the clink of glasses and the fading footsteps of the house-elf.
He turns the page. There is the photograph Narcissa gave him, and Harry's breath catches for a moment. Two long weeks since he last saw that face. Draco stares up at him, his eyes the colour of a sky just before a storm, his mouth small and serious. Harry reaches out and traces his fingertips across the photograph. A motion he'd never dare make to Draco in person. But the Draco in the picture just gazes at him, not moving as Harry's fingers trail across his cheekbones.
“I think my arm’s going to drop off from all the stirring,” Ron moaned, poking it gingerly. “It’s completely dead.”
There's a slight pause in conversation between Malfoy and the shopkeeper. Harry, aware of the unusual silence, frowns and lifts his gaze.
"You do know," Harry retorts, "that you're systematically destroying everything I used to enjoy about food? Insects in chocolate, now this..."
And as he finished, as he reeled in his memories like kites from a stormy sky, he noted the Hufflepuffs skimming rocks across the lake, pausing to pull their cloaks tight and return to the castle. A storm was coming. He decided to return to the castle himself, just as the heavens opened and the rain fell so hard and fast it felt like he was in the middle of a waterfall, walking through a thick sheet of water.
The fifth of June...the day Draco arrived on his doorstep, tossed his cloak casually across the kitchen counter, and said
He wakes early, before sunrise. He stands on the balcony and looks out across the dark line of the Cornish coast. The predawn air is crisp with a salted ocean breeze, but soon it will be tempered by a warm summer day. It's the seventeenth of June, Harry remembers.
Harry pauses a moment, listening to the whistling in the streets below, then steps inside and snaps the door shut.
Somewhere, in the streets below, someone is whistling a familiar tune. Harry tilts his head, listening for a long moment before the words come to him. An old English folk song, he remembers.
The Healer assistant is right, as much as Harry hates to admit it. Draco is still asleep when he goes into the room, and the assistant returns to tell Harry that Draco will remain asleep for at least the next twelve hours.
But he's always, always elsewhere. His mind is ghosting along highways and winding roads; it's drifting around corners and hearing the roar of the sea and the song of winter's chill. He wakes at three a.m every night, dreaming of crumbling cliffs and a voice crying out. He sits in the Renault Mégane and stares at nothing for hours.
Narcissa says nothing for a long moment, pushing the needle through the cloth. "I don't wish for his possessions to be lost or destroyed," she says at last.
, and your selfish — “ Harry cuts himself off, hating Draco, hating himself. He tries laughing bitterly but he can’t even do that, and he reaches for the door handle, feeling claustrophobic suddenly, needing to escape.
Draco pulls him closer, just a little, and Harry wonders — his pulse suddenly picking up and rushing along like a crashing wave — if Draco will kiss him.
Draco wavered for a moment, uncertain, wanting to appear cold and uncaring. But worry and love won over and he hurried to the front door, opening it.
“ — and Lucius seemed to become obsessed with returning in time to alter certain choices. But Draco was
He returns to the testing centre forty minutes later. Matthew — apparently deeply absorbed in a very ancient-looking copy of
." He shoves his hands in his pockets, studying Narcissa's reflection in the window. The stars are coming out now, cold and white against the dark January sky. "I remember that night, the night of the battle. I walked to my death but I wasn't alone. I remember the spirit of my mother walking alongside me." He turns around, leaning his back against the cold glass of the window. "Do you think Draco ever felt he walked alone?"
So instead, he goes and prepares himself for the real reason for his absence from the game: his practical driving test.
Draco was too scared to ask why, though in his heart he knew. Harry didn’t want to sit where murderers sat. He didn’t want to get too close.
“You left people behind, Draco. God, do you ever think about other people? Your wife, Astoria — and your mother, she never stopped searching — damn it! Damn
"Let's go to the Shrieking Shack — I heard it's haunted!" a student says to their friend as they pass by.
Harry sat at the Slytherin table where Draco used to sit with Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. He didn’t know who sat there now, long after Draco had finished breakfast and retreated to examine his scars.
"Fourth floor. They won't let anyone in," Harry says, and the anger he initially felt bubbles to the surface again. "Those bloody Healers, they're treating him like an experiment. Their eyes lit up like Christmas trees when they learned he'd been splinched in two time eras. They're running every test under the sun, and they wanted to bring in a team of Healers from the Research Division."
“Well…it’s such a fantastic potion, I wouldn’t mind getting stuck into it right away,” Hermione admitted and Ron raised his hands in victory.
But the first three cartons are lined with neatly-folded clothes. Well-made robes and quality cloaks, but hardly opulent or extravagant clothing. There's a small selection of ties for formalwear, and three tiny boxes that Harry first mistakes for ring boxes. But no; each one has a set of cufflinks inside. The next carton is filled with documents: tax files and the like. Draco's finances were kept in good order, Harry sees with a brief skim of the documents. No apparent investments, but his spending seemed quite limited.
But Harry doesn't say any of that. He smiles instead, and nods his way through dinner, and waits until they've Apparated home. And just as they're standing in the bedroom, with Ginny folding her robes and Harry sitting on the edge of the bed, he says "I didn't even notice."
“But you didn’t think that was the purpose of the meeting,” Harry says, watching Narcissa closely. Narcissa shakes her head.
There are two double beds; he chooses the bed closest to the window, trailing a hand along the crisp linen. There's very little to unpack — a few sets of clothing he bought in Hopper's Crossing, his washbag with a toothbrush, razor and comb. Still, Harry spends a long time rearranging the items. When he's exhausted that activity, he roams the small room. There's a little balcony. An armchair in the corner of the room, a small writing desk in the other corner.
"The furniture was sold with the house." Narcissa hesitates. "There's a set of stables on the manor grounds, when there used to be horses and carriages kept here. The stables were converted to a storage area for the gardener's equipment. Draco's car is kept there too."
"No." He looks away, watching the starling. "I lived with Muggle relatives. They didn't like taking me places." He can feel Draco's gaze on him and waits in the long silence.
"Oh, there's no need for stuffy introductions," Astoria says irritably. "You're Hermione Granger, who
And, as he’s learned from this division, a story can be found in the smallest details: a stitch in a robe, a smile across a room, the faint tremble of a hand. He can pick a story out from the bruise dancing across Ron's knuckles, from the droplets of blood on his collar, from the way his knee jitters as he spins his tale.
“And this is of consequence because…?” Hermione asked but Harry looked. Yes, on the second floor, in a lonely and dusty classroom. His face was a blur, his hands against the window like pale butterflies flickering behind dusty glass.
Harry went home with his own darkness those nights, as though Draco had broken off a piece of shadow for Harry. Harry never slept those nights. He dreamed instead. About that day.
The Gryffindor met his eyes and turned away; Draco knew it would not happen again. Blood trickled from his hand onto the parchment, hot like the wind from a wildfire, and still he did not move.
"You've been made captain?" Harry says with surprise. Ginny's always had a lot of ambition, but Gwen loves her job and has no plans to resign, as far as Harry knows.
"Those are for interviewees," Harry says. It's an old joke between them. Ron grins and unwraps the toffee.
Harry frowns, carefully scanning Malfoy for any clues to his disappearance. This is the last anyone saw of him, after all. And it’s the first Harry has seen of Malfoy since the Battle of Hogwarts. The description in the file was right, at least, but Harry supposes they took the details direct from this memory. The weak sunlight, filtering through the narrow windows, catches on the tiny clasp of Malfoy’s black travelling cloak. A silver snitch, Harry thinks with closer inspection, no bigger than the fingernail of Harry’s index finger.
they’ve been arguing about names forever, it took them so long to finally agree on a couple of names. Even Draco kept his mouth shut.”
The notes — same as all of Draco's other ones throughout the years — seem to focus on practical techniques and applications rather than theoretical knowledge. He seemed to have had an obsession with documenting each step perfectly, making sure there was no room for error. Harry turns a page.
"Hi," Harry says weakly. "Er...I just thought...I might..." He holds out the papers. "My application."
Harry feels the cold first, and then the rest of his senses filter through. He’s sitting in the driver’s seat of the Renault, but he’s him again. In his own head. It’s night-time, and he’s parked beside a playground in a small village in Hampshire. He glances into the rearview mirror, just to look at his own reflection, just to make sure he’s himself.
He looks beside him, to the passenger seat. Draco sits there, but he looks exhausted, insubstantial as smoke, and Harry realises he’s already fading.
The whispers followed him but more reluctantly now. Draco kept walking, forcing himself not to slink against the wall like a mouse skulking from a predator, a fox waiting for the hunting rifle.
“I think I know what happened,” Harry says quietly, and both Astoria and Narcissa turn to look at him. “I think you’re right, Narcissa. Draco left voluntarily for three months, but he decided to return and report Lucius’s whereabouts. On the morning of Lucius’s capture, an anonymous tip-off told us his location. But I think perhaps Lucius realised what Draco was going to do, and tried to take both of them back into the past. And it went terribly wrong.” He can imagine the struggle all too well. Perhaps the time-turner broke, or slipped, but either way — only Draco was taken into the past, while Lucius remained behind. In the ensuing chaos as Aurors arrived, Lucius didn’t have the chance to tell anyone what had happened before he was killed.
Harry switches the indicator on and overtakes a car in front. "Hermione and Ron will tell her they got the letter. She'll know you're all right."
he picked up from the stationery shop in Hopper's Crossing. He's read nearly every article twice. There's a page devoted to Ginny in the 'Top Ten Female Players' section. The page is peppered with photographs of her and references to 'Harry Potter's ex-fiancee'. That annoys Harry. Ginny's struggled for years to carve a name for herself, but at countless sports interviews and Quidditch articles, Harry's name has always been dragged in by enthusiastic interviewers. Now it seems even though they're no longer in a relationship, she's still having the same problems.
They pay for their items — or at least, Draco pays with his card. Harry feels a little uncomfortable about Draco paying for everything so far, but Draco doesn't seem to care and he hasn't made Harry feel like he owes him anything.
The walls are lined with colourful pictures: bright crayon drawings sent in by families grateful for news of long-lost spouses and parents, and a framed picture of the Chudley Cannons on one wall (a joke gift from Ron). Harry, aware that many friends and family of missing people will sit in the office and look around it, has made a concerted effort to hide anything upsetting. Unlike the Auror offices — often with enlarged mugshots on the walls or mind-maps that track motives and suspects — Harry is far more discreet with his file information. It was one of the first thing Holdsworth taught him about being in the Investigative Division.
Draco finally looks up, glancing at Harry before tapping his wand against the owl clasp on his cloak. It immediately curls in on itself, smaller and smaller, until it resembles a tiny marble. It fades to silver a moment later, and small wings form along it.
feel better about it. It had happened, and that was that. Yes, of course there were nightmares, but everybody has nightmares. Falling from heights or being chased or dying in unpleasant ways, it's all the same. Everyone fears something.
"Can you tell me how you disappeared?" Harry asks. There's a sharp splintering noise, as if the air around Draco is cracking like glass, and Harry takes a step backwards.
"Give the bloke a break," Ron cuts in, rubbing tiredly at the circles under his eyes. "Malfoy's been dragging him halfway across the country. You look awful," he adds, addressing Harry.
"He's in a magically-induced sleep," she says brightly. "Just to make sure everything recovers completely. Minchin's nervous system was completely shot when
She glances up at him. "Well, truthfully...I'm rather surprised. I always assumed Malfoy disappeared to some luxurious holiday destination, just to escape his old life. But this..."
Maybe, a few months ago, Harry would have nodded and smiled and convinced himself he was happy, or at least that it was selfish to be unhappy. But his conversation with Draco circles his mind like a flurry of snow:
"Is that what you told Draco?" Harry asks, wasting no time in going over to the Renault Mégane and pulling the cover away. It feels like greeting an old friend. He smiles faintly and runs a hand across the polished metal.
Harry walks along the south-west coastal track. Maybe he'll just keep walking and one day he'll find himself back here again. Making circles, making meaningless patterns.
Harry tilts his head, frowning. The shop seems a little brighter somehow. Did someone light a candle? A lantern?
Harry stands on the balcony, watching the people hurry below. Earlier in the day, the streets were eerily empty, but now — in the last remaining hour of daylight — people are beginning to trickle home from their trips.
"Draco would be furious to hear me speak of it," Narcissa says. The sun is nearly set and he can see her reflection in the dark window. She's looking at him with an expression of sadness and he thinks that if she knew he could see her expression, she would quickly hide it. "But there is something about you that I see in him too."
"I didn't finish the question," Hermione says, narrowing her eyes. "When was the last time you spoke to Ginny...about something other than work?"
Every now and again, he looks up, but there's no sign of Draco. Maybe he dreamed it last time. Maybe Hermione's right about her Legilimency theory, but maybe she's not. Maybe he's slowly going mad, constructing illusions, trying to conjure something that doesn't exist.
"So have you," Harry says, disentangling his hand slightly to brush a fingertip over the faded curve of a serpent's tail.
Not five minutes arriving in the apartment, he receives a firecall from Butterworth. Unusual, as his colleagues know only to use personal firecalls in urgent situations.
He drives around a bend in the road. Harry watches the way he grips the steering wheel, flexing the tendons in his wrist. There's a mesmerising confidence in Draco's hands, in the way he effortlessly steers, the way he drives without really thinking about it.
Narcissa studies her husband. "Unfortunately," she says, "Draco is his own person. We no longer control his choices."
A wedding ring, Harry realises. As he steps closer, he realises she's crying. Did she have a fight with Malfoy? He waits restlessly for Malfoy to step through the door and say something acerbic.
Ron dropped his coffee cup, the delicately shaded liquid spilling in beaded droplets. Draco's finest Guatamelan roast all over the kitchen tiles.
On Christmas Eve they drive, drive, drive, and it’s quiet and dark and the long roads are endless, but this is their time.
Draco doesn't seem too enthusiastic, but he doesn't outright argue as Harry finds his way to the pier. The beachfront area is filled with confused tourists, irritated locals, and cafés with loud music. The beach itself is crowded with families. School holidays, Harry remembers. There's far too many children shrieking and kicking sand about.
Draco doesn't deign to reply to that, but when Harry glances at him five minutes later, he can see Draco smiling.
The car responds immediately, the low thrum of the engine filling the room. For a long moment, Harry grips the steering wheel tightly and can't trust himself to speak. He doesn't know why, but this moment is heavy with something intangible.
He snapped around, distracted by the sight of the students scuttling away and sneering over their shoulders at him.
The high summer sun has long set, it seems. He's standing on the crumbling stone steps of a small chapel. There's a brisk wind stirring dead leaves along the gravestones. Overhead, the sky is bruised with unshed rain. Someone is standing at a grave, setting a small handful of wilting bluebells upon it, but Harry doesn't recognise them.
The concrete box in the sky. Is this where it all ends? The flat sandy beaches of Sutton-on-Sea, the bright bustle of Brighton, the soaring and windswept cliffs of the Cornish coastline, the canola meadows of Wiltshire, the star-filled sky of Snowdonia —
Draco just gives him a smug look and closes the door. A few seconds later, the hum of the shower begins.
To Harry, it's a weary journey that he must think about, and he's painfully, consciously aware of the exact measurements of the home to which he's going. A two-bedroom apartment in Westminster, polished and sleek, commanding a modest view over the skyline of south-west London. It had cost an uncomfortable amount of money but it was in an ideal location. Perfect as a home base for Ginny, who had to frequently travel across the United Kingdom for her Quidditch matches. And, as she had said when she first booked an inspection for the apartment, the perfect place for Harry, so close to the Ministry.
Harry laughed. The noise jolted the Hufflepuffs awake. One of them half-heartedly ate a spoonful of porridge, the others adjusting their textbooks to make better pillows. Draco was silent. As they ate and chattered however, the Hufflepuffs managed to rise and finish their breakfast. As they left, more students began to drift in until the Hall was roughly a quarter full.
he murmured and the quill mended, the two halves coming together instantly. He set it down carefully upon a desk. He went over to another fallen desk, repairing a splintered chair with a wave of his wand. As he pulled the desk upright something clinked gently across its surface, then rolled across the floor with the smallest of noises.
Harry was at breakfast the next day. He sat at the Slytherin table and Draco went to sit at the Ravenclaw table when Harry called out his name. Draco returned, sitting this time not across from Harry but next to him.
He tosses and turns, trying to wrap his head around the fact that Draco is here. In this same apartment, just a few steps along the hallway. Some part of him is saying it's a dream. Nothing but a dream, and when he wakes in the morning, Draco will be gone.
People had come running. Good people, decent people. But they were too late. A thousand candles would never bring light to the whispering darkness that filled Draco's head. He was gone, somewhere Harry couldn't follow.
It's a Saturday. Summer is still hanging in the air like a familiar friend, reluctant to leave. Harry stands on the balcony and looks up at the azuline sky.
He went back for everyone else, during the war. At least, that's what he likes to think. He did it for them, the faceless thousands, the Muggleborns crushed beneath the cruel hand of Voldemort's regime. The witches and wizards whom so desperately hoped for a better future. His fellow Hogwarts students, filling the halls of Hogwarts with their screams as the Carrows tortured them.
He steps into the corridor. The apartments are half-floor, and thus there are only two doors in the corridor: on the left side, Harry's apartment. On the right, his neighbour's.
He made a critical mistake with the Panacis potion. He felt like crying for the first time and it would be a bloody potion that did it. He wanted to smash his cauldron like a child. The saving grace was that at least Slughorn wasn’t around; he’d left to deal with some urgent student matter.
It's one thing he and Draco have in common: a lonely childhood. The only time Harry ever got close to playing games like tag was when he found himself running for his life as a jeering Dudley waddled after him, or Aunt Marge's bulldogs snapped at his heels. It's a very different experience to be racing through a field, the night sky clear and crisp above him, listening to the sound of light footsteps behind him. Draco's voice cuts across the field.
Astoria dumps an armful of cutlery into the sink. “Harry, don’t be ridiculous. We’re all Draco’s friends,” she says absently.
They never really saw each other alone, Harry realises. Most of the time they were surrounded by people when they encountered each other in the halls of Hogwarts. In classrooms where their friends stood behind them, stony-faced, like rows of soldiers. He can count on one hand the number of times they encountered each other completely alone.
Harry takes another sip of tea, wanting to interrupt and ask questions, but knowing he must let Astoria tell her story.
"If you speak the truth," she says, "I will give any information you require, any assistance you need to find my son."
“No thanks.” Harry gazes into the flames of fire. It’s burned low in the grate and the flames are small, wavering gently over glowing coals. “Draco’s gone.”
Harry shakes his head. He doesn't know if Narcissa would want Astoria to know. "It doesn't matter. But in it, Malfoy mentioned he never wears his wedding ring."
As soon as Harry enters his office, he goes straight for the file in his desk and opens it up. The photograph of Draco that Narcissa gave Harry so many months ago. Draco stares at Harry, his mouth small and serious, his eyes unblinking. The silver snitch clasp is neatly pinned to his robes.
It makes Harry feel guilty again. Draco — judging by the letters written in the back of the calendar diary — had never forgotten his original wand and had agonised over the obstacle of asking for its return. But for Harry, the wand hadn't even deserved a second thought. He'd made vague plans to return it, but had been too busy with stupid things, smiling and busy with his friends, his life, and he'd thrown it into a box of other forgotten items and left it to gather dust in a Gringotts vault.
"You are." Ron takes a leisurely swig of the butterbeer. "You're afraid that if you take this Investigative job, it'll mean you were wrong about always being an Auror. And you wasted seven years doing it. But that's a bloody stupid way to look at it. We had some great times during those seven years, didn't we? You were happy during those seven years, weren't you? Not a waste of time, then." Ron shakes his head. "It's like losing a game of Quidditch, then saying you wish you hadn't played at all."
"My parents were desperate to procure a good marriage for me. They arranged for me to meet with the Malfoys. Draco was perfectly civil, but I saw something in him that was also a part of me. We were both acting the roles we had been assigned, wearing masks given to us by others. After we became friends and then best friends, I told Draco I could never truly love him and I intended to marry just to please my parents." Astoria pauses to take a long sip of tea; when she sets the mug back down, she begins tracing patterns on the table. Drawing circles, Harry notices, and wonders if she realises.
, Draco had said, and Harry's just grateful Draco's here. It's enough, and he tells Draco that. "You've done enough. Go and get some rest."
Harry thinks he won't, just to spite Draco, but despite his best efforts he falls asleep somewhere west of Shrewsbury.
Draco is silent for a long time again. Harry, at last, chances a glance at him. Draco's not looking at him, he thinks with relief. He's staring at the view from the balcony door, staring at the city lights, the trains slowly crawling along the tracks.
"I caught the last one three years ago," Harry says sharply. "Lucius Malfoy, who died in custody. That doesn't feel like a victory, strangely enough."
“The longer they’ve been dead, the less accurate the spells are. I can’t give you anything better than that.”
Harry subsides into — if he's honest with himself — a sulk. Draco pays for two rooms and makes the fatal mistake of inquiring about the east-coastal walking track; the woman immediately launches into an enthusiastic (if one-sided) conversation about the local flora and fauna. Draco manages to politely extract himself fifteen minutes later and they make their escape to their rooms.
Harry leaves early the next morning, before Ginny wakes; he has an 8:30am meeting with the family solicitor who, he discovers, is a tall, broad-shouldered witch who reminds him somehow of Madame Maxime. She ushers Harry into her office — a small room clearly designed by a fan of minimalism. He'd been expecting something extravagant for a solicitor worthy of the Malfoys, but there's little more than a set of filing cabinets, a glass table, and two chairs.
The next afternoon, as Harry's halfway through revising the latest case, Ron strides into the office.
He clutched onto him tightly as they nearly fell, slipping and putting back a hand to catch himself, feeling the wet earth cling to his palm as his other hand grabbed a handful of Harry’s robes again. He managed to haul himself upright with great effort. The two of them ran, stumbling, grimly holding their robes above their heads. The rain pelted their faces, soaking first the front of Draco’s open robes until his thighs were chilled to the bone, then stinging his hands till they burned with cold. He could not even feel his face anymore. It was nearly impossible to see with evening setting in over the storm but at last they were up the castle steps and inside. Harry shook his hair out of his eyes and departed immediately, setting off towards the Gryffindor tower without bothering for words of farewell.
"Speed is less important than accuracy," Harry repeats, murmuring it to himself, trying to trigger something. Anything.
"Draco," Harry says quietly, recognising the signs. The abstract way Draco speaks, the way he stares closely at objects.
Astoria glances down, towards her cup of tea. People look downwards when they're upset, Holdsworth once told Harry, or trying to hide emotion. But it's difficult to read Astoria's face, although she twists her lips slightly as if considering something.
"The River Medway," Draco says, one hand resting lightly on the atlas. "It joins with the Thames and, eventually, the North Sea."
It's a long walk back to the car alone, and a longer drive back to London, but Harry thinks he could get used to long trips.
Draco won't say anything, Harry thinks, glancing at him. Always compartmentalising, always in perfect control...the only time he ever let Harry inside his head and heart was when he thought he'd be stuck in the past forever. Harry will need to choose his words carefully, or he has the feeling this moment between them could shatter like glass and send Draco away forever.
Harry is silent for a long time. It's something he's learned from Draco, from all those endless nights spent in the memories of Draco driving, driving through dark streets and long highways. It lends Harry patience and contemplation.
The restaurant itself is a small and cheerful establishment with a fire crackling merrily and wreaths of holly twined around the windows. It reminds Harry of the Three Broomsticks. They're ushered to a discreet corner, where Harry won't be bothered with stares and Ginny won't be badgered by ardent Quidditch fans. Harry orders a spiced mead and Ginny spends some time perusing a list of festive cocktails before she orders something called a Peppermint Dragon.
"I know lots of things about you." Draco grins and Harry's heart seems to stutter for a second. It's an...interesting angle, he thinks — him standing by the bed, Draco lying across it grinning up at him — and he's caught between disappointment and relief when Draco sits up and reaches for the book, setting it onto the bedside table.
He goes to a nearby pub for dinner but he returns just an hour later, unable to enjoy himself despite the pleasant meal and scenic walk back to the guesthouse. The receptionist seems to guess at his question before he says a word.
Only three months in. Three months left to go. And he’d completely ruined everything, like usual. He knew he would not attend the next lesson.
“Astoria,” Matthew says quietly. She glances at him but doesn’t respond. Narcissa looks at Astoria, then stares at Harry.
Harry wakes early. This is a routine and it grounds him like a lightning conductor. Wake early, go for a run. Shower, dress. Breakfast.
They’re sitting around Astoria and Matthew’s old oak table, drinks in hand, content and mildly sleepy after the usual Sunday roast. Sophie is eyeing off the pudding, considering the possibility of coaxing a second serving out of her parents. Ginny is still in her Quidditch robes and manages to look quite comfortable anyway. Ron and Hermione are sitting together, picking over the remains of the roast duck.
"Look, I know it can't have been fun for him — stuck in the past for three years — but you're not responsible for his recovery, Harry. You did your job, you located him, that's all you needed to do."
Narcissa glances away, a hand still resting on the sapphire pendant. "You can look at it, if you think it will help. It's one of Draco's most prized possessions."
Harry opens his mouth, then remembers Hermione and Ron excitedly kissing while a war waged around them. "Neville," Harry mutters instead, glaring at Draco. "Neville wasn't self-absorbed."
So there's really no reason for human contact anymore, Harry thinks dully. He pushes Draco's cup of tea across the counter, resisting the urge to let their fingers brush. Seems to be a common theme to his thoughts tonight, he thinks. Hands, reaching for each other. Wouldn't that look strange, Draco's Dark Mark next to
Draco departed just ahead of Ron, Harry and Hermione; he turned left as they went straight ahead, returning to their bright tower before going to class.
"Did she? How fascinating." Draco takes the glass tumblers from Harry's hands, his fingers brushing fleetingly along Harry's.
It's a strange thing to think, because Draco wasn't ever sick, Harry thinks. There were never any symptoms, never any illness. But he's getting better somehow.
"Yeah, well..." Harry tries to focus on the cup of tea before him, making sure every last grain of sugar melts away to nothing. "I just don't think we could've been friends."
Harry glanced up. Draco had returned and though his face was flushed, he held out his hand demandingly. A flicker of courage seemed to leap hopefully through the air between them.
"Well, some people think he was a hero." Harry looks at the sign. "One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, as they say."
The car rolls forward, finally leaving its prison of the past three years, finally doing what it was built to do: move. There's the quiet crunch of gravel beneath the tyres. He turns slowly along the wide path until it sweeps around the manor and joins the wide driveway.
Harry slows down as a cat runs across the road, thinking of Godric's Hollow and all the lights twinkling in the snow. The only Christmas he ever truly spent at home, and suddenly he misses it more than anything.
"Well, best of luck. I mean, it's been three years anyway, and — watch out, you're coasting to the left a little — let's face it, not much of chance of finding new clues."
"Old enough to show some responsibility for your own actions, Draco. Your decision to accept the Dark Mark was yours alone, as I recall. Your mother advised against it, and I did not comment on the matter."
Hermione's gaze softens. "Well, at least it's legal," she says, returning to her book. "Ron wanted to know if I knew anything about Essence of Insanity last week. Well, really."
Work is the same. He went missing for three weeks — three weeks — no notice given, no warning — and anyone else would be fired, dismissed, sent away without references. While his supervisors lecture him —
Well, he won't apologise, he thinks stubbornly. Draco hadn't been reasonable either, after all. Harry might take a little blame, but only, for example, a quarter.
They wander out to the car, a white sedan, and Harry tries to discuss monetary payment, feeling rather like Matthew should be compensated for all the inevitable moments of frustration and despair. Matthew quickly quashes that notion and instead demands Harry pays him with stories of the wizarding world.
Now, the land is bright and green, the sea sparkling beneath the light of summer. The abandoned holiday houses are filled once more with sunburned faces and laughing voices. As Harry follows the meandering track, he passes by at least three couples, a young family, and an elderly man with an equally elderly terrier.
"Where did you learn that about chocolate, anyway?" Harry asks later on, when they're wandering past the Royal Pavilion.
Narcissa nods. "I assume he sold his broom. Both Astoria and myself removed all his possessions when I was granted the rights to sell his house. We collected every item."
"Can I keep working in the Investigative Division?" Harry asks suddenly, and Williamson pauses mid-sentence to give him a startled look.
“In two of the cases, the person placed the time-turner somewhere safe, where it could be found and used by the rescuers in the future.”
"Hullo," he says cheerfully, holding out a hand. Harry shakes it. "Nice to meet you. Had much luck finding Astoria's mysterious ex-husband, then?"
"I'm afraid we destroy records of sale after twelve months." The shopkeeper gives Harry a peculiar look and he realises his hair is slowly darkening to black again; he fumbles for the flask of polyjuice potion and takes another swig. The shopkeeper gives the flask a very suspicious look. "Are you drinking on the job?" he demands. "What's your name? I'll report you, you know."
The ocean vanishes into a desolate horizon. The sand is wet and dark with rain. The sky is white with winter.
And the Minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt, had told them that the days of the Fudge ministry were over (and Scrimgeour — but he had happened so quickly, people just tended to push him aside) and that this wasn’t the sort of government that went around locking up people and all that now.
“If nobody tells me what a Niffler is, I’ll pour custard into the fireplace and ruin your stupid Floo thing,” Matthew says.
"Quit chatting and get in the car already," Astoria says impatiently. "I want to see how badly Harry screws up."
"Just thinking about one of my cases," he mutters at last, and Matthew doesn't press further. Harry slows down to turn into the driveway, listening to the tyres crunch over wet gravel.
If he died alone in the cold and unforgiving tide of the Celtic Sea, the worst part is that Harry hadn't even noticed for three years.
He nearly forgets that the memory belongs to Narcissa, but then Narcissa is stepping through the doorway and staring at Lucius. The room sharpens into view: a study, with an oak desk in one corner and two armchairs by a marble fireplace.
"I can see you're still worried about him, Harry," she says accusingly. "You look awful. Promise me you'll do your best to relax and take a break, all right? Look after yourself. Go for a drive, you've been enjoying that lately. And I know it's very unmanly and everything, heaven forbid, but please
"We could just Disapparate to visit your mother, you know," Astoria says sleepily. "It's a two-hour drive, for Merlin's sake."
But now, six months into his assignment, he still doesn’t understand the lesson he’s supposed to be learning.
And somewhere between here and the southernmost point of Great Britain — somewhere between now and the past — somewhere between
“I gave you mine,” Slughorn said. “It’s alright. Just make sure it does not happen again, Mr Malfoy, or I’ll have to fail you.”
"He went back to the manor." Astoria's quiet again for another moment. "Merlin, it was awful. Narcissa and I had the biggest row. We wouldn't have argued, normally, but I suppose emotions were running high. I'd promised myself I'd be calm, but I couldn't help but feel angry. I know, it's terrible, but honestly. Three years, and
"Perhaps so," she allows, "but my son has been missing for three long years now, and this seems to be his last chance. Should I gamble it for the sake of keeping secrets, guarding memories?"
Yes. Harry remembers that quiet moment, buried in the depths of December. Draco, standing alone, illuminated by the faint glow of the Christmas lights. Harry had reached for him and he had faded like a ghost. Before their hands even had the chance to touch. Harry looks down at his own hand for a moment, at the way his wrist flexes as he picks up the kettle and pours the water.
He takes off his shoes and lets the waves wash over his feet. Further out, the waves curl until they crest and crash, rushing inland until nothing more than a rippled tide reaches Harry.
Harry's breath catches. He doesn't know what he should say, what he should feel. He wants to be angry, snap questions, demand answers; he wants to ask Draco
Ron frowns and swaps a look with Hermione. "But...you said you didn't like your Auror work. I thought..."
“Oh, yeah. I remember you told us about that.” Ron frowns. “To be honest, I thought you were just...”
"You told me last night, Astoria, that you wanted to be the one standing there delivering your father's eulogy." Malfoy's expression hasn't changed a bit, Harry thinks. He's standing there looking intently at Astoria.
Harry can't help but grin. It's quite funny, really. Adding to the amusement is a small drawing Draco did, presumably of Planet Harry: he's drawn a Saturn-esque planet wearing a pair of spectacles. Harry laughs and turns the page, half-hoping to find another amusing drawing, but instead finds more writing. The letter continues, apparently.
They arrive in a dizzying rush of magic, and Harry stumbles forwards into deep snow. He notices the darkness first — this is a place untouched by the lights of nearby cities. Above, the stars are so clear they seem to clutter the sky.
Just over a month since Malfoy went missing. He turns to gaze at Astoria. She's still sitting on the edge of the bed, her wedding ring in one hand, crying silently. He feels slightly uncomfortable with the memory and wonders why Astoria gave him such a personal scene. Then she speaks, and for a moment Harry thinks she's speaking to him. But she seems to be addressing nothing more than air.
He reads it again and again. It's nothing. A polite thank you, a polite goodbye. A commendation, like Harry did all this for a pat on the head and a compliment. He feels nauseous, but after the queasiness recedes he begins to feel angry. Angry that nobody's told him anything, angry that Narcissa so clearly considers him to be of such little personal importance. She hadn't even mentioned Draco, where he was or if he was all right.
Well, of course this is how it will end. This was borrowed time, this trip. A journey stolen, moments that weren't supposed to happen, memories that were never supposed to be given. And now Draco will go back to the manor, to his fussing mother and doting house-elves, and Harry will go back to his blank white apartment and stand on the balcony and drink scotch, and maybe if he listens closely enough he might hear someone whistling blow the wind southerly, southerly, southerly...
Astoria nods. "While we were arguing, he went and changed into his clothes. As soon as he reappeared, Narcissa took him down to reception to sign out — just
"Total madness," Harry agrees. "We used to hold competitions to see who ended up the most sleep deprived, remember? Atkinson still holds the record, I think — four days straight on the job."
Narcissa takes a long sip of the gin and tonic, and she seems inclined to rebuke Harry for speaking of such personal matters. However, she catches sight of the Renault keycard in Harry's hand and seems to change her mind.
The familiar ache settles into Harry's heart. He knows that nostalgia well. Back when his biggest obstacles were homework and detentions. Back when the cruelest thing Draco ever did was throw a Remembrall across the sky.
She leaves. Harry can appreciate how blunt Holdsworth is; she speaks when she has something to say, and goes away when she doesn’t.
“See if you can find another timeturner, then,” Draco says, still smiling, his hands jammed in his pockets to keep them warm.
It was a warning, a promise to the students who remained and sure enough the winds brought the chilly drizzle with them, a sunshower from half-hearted clouds. The remaining students shrieked and tumbled across the grounds, holding textbooks over heads, laughing and exclaiming, streaming across the grounds like ants, disappearing into their solid castle. And the rain deepened and sent splashes across the lake, dapples across the window. Draco liked the rain right then, at that moment. It was deep and slow and relentless, the heartbeat of nature, the lifeblood of the skies.
When Harry arrives home from work, he makes a beeline for the guest room and dumps his cloak there, then returns and sits at the dining table, looking at Hermione. She's enjoying a cup of tea and seems deeply absorbed in a book, but when she notices him there she slowly looks up.
"Right," Harry says. "Just wondering, that's all." If Draco had been taking something for depression, surely Astoria would know. He changes the subject quickly. "I'm visiting the Malfoy family solicitor tomorrow. Draco had an appointment with him."
“Yes,” Harry said quietly. “Yeah, it does.” It was true. He’d had time over summer to mourn, to feel the losses — though he had told nobody about the Resurrection Stone, he thought about it all the time. Sirius, his parents, rising up and telling him
Ginny arrives at the apartment just after five o'clock in the evening. Harry is standing on the balcony, staring out over the Thames, watching the trains. The wards suddenly shimmer, wavering across his view, and the next moment Ginny has tumbled into the middle of the kitchen, a portkey clutched in one hand. Her cheeks are flushed, her eyes bright with victory. She kisses him before rushing away again; the team captain has organised a celebratory dinner for the team.
"Gladly," he says, striding to the door. "Thanks for all your help." He leaves, slamming the door behind him and knowing it's childish, but he can't stop himself. He's so angry. Draco's been missing three years, three
"Well, it's no use blaming anyone," Hermione says suddenly. "You said Malfoy was sick, didn't you? What happened?"
They stop in Huntingdon to refill the fuel tank and have a break. Draco leans on the side of the car and looks up at the sky; Harry reads a nearby sign declaring Huntingdon the birthplace of Oliver Cromwell.
There's another long silence. Harry, desperately wanting to see Draco's face, moves closer to the door and peers into the room. But as Narcissa herself never witnessed the scene, the room is nothing but a beige-coloured blur.
That night, he stands on the little balcony and rests his hands on the wrought-iron railing, just to feel something solid. As if he's trying to ground himself, as if electricity is pouring through him.
Then he turns and leaves, stepping out the door and closing it behind him. Harry listens to the quiet snick of the door, followed by fading footsteps.
"You said I'd changed." There's something in his voice that Harry hasn't heard before, but he still doesn't look up.
After all, he'd thought the same when the investigation first started. And even further back, when he first heard Draco had disappeared. He had been twenty-three then and his whole life seemed lit up like summer sky. Friends and drinks at the pub and Ginny, beautiful, bright Ginny, and they'd only just bought the apartment and there was so much energy in them. And Draco's disappearance had been nothing but a footnote in his life, a brief read of a newspaper headline, a small snort of contempt as he imagined Draco gloating in an expensive retreat somewhere. Then he'd effortlessly moved on, never sparing the incident another thought until the file landed on his desk three years later.
On the last day of summer, when the sapphire-coloured sky has given way to a pale blue and the blazing sunlight has gentled, Holdsworth tells Harry there's a vacancy in the Investigative Division.
"Did you? Brilliant." Ginny grabs her bag. "Ticket on the table if you can make it to the game. Love you." Then she reaches for the portkey on the bed — an empty Jammie Dodgers packet — and whirls away in the blink of an eye.
In the deep and pristine wilderness of Snowdonia, it had felt like the moon had balanced on his heart, light and clear as the sky itself. Here, in London, it seems to weigh on him, heavy as lead, making it hard to breathe. The weight only grows heavier as they leave the highway and follow increasingly familiar roads. At last, they've reached the apartment block; Draco parks the Renault with the same easy grace he always has, whether he's standing on the edge of a cliff in Cornwall or taking Harry's hand to show him a lake full of stars. For a moment, Harry's heart lifts as Draco walks with him to the stairwell, but then he remembers he's been driving for hours. A cup of coffee before he leaves again would be a basic courtesy, at least.
Harry glances up, wondering if Narcissa somehow read his mind. But she's not looking at him; she's gazing at the photograph, and although there seems to be the faintest trace of a smile on her lips, sadness lines her face. She looks far older than Harry remembers. The fine lines around her eyes seem deeper and she seems thinner. Harry wonders if all the Malfoys became thinner and smaller after the war. Taking up less space, or trying to vanish themselves somehow.
"You're afraid." Ron points his butterbeer at Harry, then sets it upright again and untwists the cap. "Pathetic, really."
. Sophie giggles as Harry sweeps her off her feet and dances around the room with her. Matthew and Astoria laugh helplessly as they absolutely butcher a foxtrot. Draco watches over the proceedings like royalty holding court, Hermione by his side and chatting about the latest Ministry news.
And maybe, he realises, that's exactly why Draco chose to turn up at Harry's apartment rather than anywhere else.
Harry flinches, although Narcissa spoke without anger. Her face is calm, like a deep lake, but Harry's experienced firsthand the dangers that lurk beneath still waters.
Harry says his farewells to Astoria and Matthew, flooing to the apartment. Ginny's put a small Christmas tree — no bigger than an owl — on the end of the kitchen counter. Harry stares at it for a moment, remembering the lush pine needles buried beneath the snow drifts of Godric's Hollow. The cheerful pub, decorated with lights, and the distant sound of carols being sung. He could have grown up there. Built snowmen as a child, and when he was older he could've had his first drink in that pub.
By the end of the hour, Harry has managed to successfully drive to the end of the driveway without giving either himself or Matthew whiplash. That, Matthew declares, deserves a butterbeer.
"Come in, come in, have a seat," he says, ushering Harry into his office. Mr Weasley has come a long way since his pokey little office so many years ago: as the newly-appointed Head of the Muggle Liaison Office, his new office is very roomy and well-appointed. "What can I do for you, Harry?" he asks, offering a tin of toffees. Harry accepts one and sits down in a chair opposite Mr Weasley's desk.
It's odd to remember, Harry thinks, how he used to be infuriated by Draco's arrogance at Hogwarts. That sheer refusal to apologise, or admit wrong, or do anything vaguely resembling moral responsibility.
They walk to the Renault together. Harry waits for Draco to choose the passenger or driver seat; to his surprise, Draco takes the passenger side and opens the glovebox, retrieving the road atlas. Harry takes the driver's seat.
“Oh, Merlin. Oh, no,” Astoria says, looking pale and wretched. “No, no. All this time, and Draco’s been stuck in the past somewhere...” She begins to cry. It’s strange to see her cry — bright, breezy Astoria, always smiling — and Harry looks away uncomfortably as Matthew soothes her.
He tilts his head back, staring at the sky. That cloudless blue, so pristine and perfect. Maybe he can stay here forever. In an endless summer. Here, in his mind.
The car is parked. He blinks and looks around. They're in the middle of nowhere, it seems. Darkness stretches away in every direction. Harry fumbles with seatbelt, unbuckling it before reaching for the handle of the car door.
"You're impulsive, you never stop to think about things, you can't compartmentalise — the worst person for detective work."
Harry turns a corner and says nothing, wondering whether or not he should tell Matthew or Astoria. No; it would be unprofessional. He shouldn't say anything until he's gotten the results back.
When Harry goes home that night, he stands on the balcony and drinks his scotch and watches the trains arrive and leave.
Later, they push the table back and play the worst records Matthew manages to find in Astoria’s notoriously terrible collection. They begin with
“Month?” Harry asks, wishing he could leave already, retreat back to the soothingly cool halls of the Ministry. Butterworth flicks his wand.
He looks so tired, Harry thinks, studying Draco, and then he realises that if Draco's not planning on contacting his mother or ex-wife yet, he's probably planning on staying the night here.
“Had another lover's tiff, hey, mate,” Ron said at last, coming to stand by Hermione. “Do you want to come inside, have a cup of tea?” Hermione nudged him with a sharp elbow, apparently displeased with the offer.
"I gathered as much." Harry picks up the folder and flips it open. A group of international scam artists are using love potions and romance charms to swindle elderly wizards and witches out of their savings. There are locations, dates, photographs of suspects, and pages of bank statements. Harry frowns and turns the pages, skimming over the rows of dates and locations.
"Yes, quite," Draco says casually, though there's a hint of gratitude in his voice, and he politely nods at the guide before retreating hastily. Once they're safely out of earshot, Harry starts laughing and Draco frowns.
Yes, Harry thinks. He was part of the initial sweep team. He listens to Ron’s story, wondering how much is exaggeration and how much is outright fabrication.
When he was walking down the corridor, they attacked him. Not with wands or fists but with words, which were worse.
"You spoke to Narcissa," Astoria says as she makes him a cup of tea. She hadn't seemed surprised to see him so soon after sending the owl.
Harry drops his gaze to the steering wheel. There's two slightly faded patches on it, where Draco must have rested his hands constantly. Harry lifts his hands and places them over the same patches.
Five o'clock. Harry can hardly wait to leave, rushing to the atrium so he can Disapparate directly to St Mungo's. Visiting hours finish at five-thirty.
They stop at a level crossing, the gates swinging closed, the red warning bell blinking like a beacon in the night. As they wait for the train to come though, Draco's eyes flick to the rear-vision mirror.
Draco nods. Harry pauses for a moment, then shuts the door and turns off the kitchen lights before going to bed.
And perhaps Harry's not doing anything right. He's not organising things and owling people and telling them Draco's back. He's not doing any of the things he should be doing — he realises Draco hasn't even got a change of clothes, Harry didn't even think about that — and he didn't even prepare a meal for Draco until tonight, if tea and toast could be called a meal — and he's not doing anything that people normally do to help.
Narcissa covers the car with the canvas again, and Harry watches the sleek lines disappear beneath the folds of dusty cloth.
It was a strange sort of day. It was a day when he could taste the darkness in the air, smell the thunderstorm rising through the air like a ghost. People were oddly raucous, noisy; their countenances strange blurs as wind-whipped hair shot across their faces like spells, their cloaks rising to greet the shadowed skies like strange wings. The Three Broomsticks’ sign swung and crashed loudly in the gale and a group standing nearby screamed and skittered like shying horses. At three o’clock in the afternoon it felt as though it was on the brink of nightfall. Yes, the whole day had a bruised, brooding feel to it.
"I don't know." Draco glances away from the mirror, his gaze locking onto Harry instead. "I have...difficulties sometimes, telling the difference between dreams and memories and reality."
Across the empty stretch of sunlit floorboards, the endless expanse of white wall seems to mock him. That sad little photograph, right in the centre. Hermione and Ron's faces are nothing but pale blurs.
She inclines her head slightly, towards the drawing room. Harry wonders if the motion is conscious or not.
Harry reddens even further. "I was just...I thought it'd be...unfriendly, that's all, so I thought I might try and cast a spell...I mean, it should have changed allegiances...you haven't had any resistance from it, have you?"
"I assure you, it is the key," Narcissa says, her voice a little chilly. "I would not have assumed that you knew even less about the Muggle world than me."
“I’ll hold you to that. Oh, speaking of Italy, Neville’s returned. Got some new specimens he wants to show you.”
The house-elf frowns, then nods and disappears. It's gone for so long that Harry begins to wonder if it died on the way. He turns and surveys the hallway, with the uncomfortable chaise and spindly hall-tables lined with photographs, and picks up one of the framed pictures. Draco smiles up at him and Harry returns the smile.
"That's the whole point, Molly said what better time than your seven year anniversary? Seven is considered a
“And Professor Flitwick had a look at my essay draft and said it was quite outstanding — what?” Hermione noticed their lack of attention.
Draco inched longingly towards a small gap of corridor, looking caught between the two groups. Harry frowned at him before returning his attention to Zacharias.
Williamson says nothing for a long moment. "This is a serious decision, best not rushed. Perhaps you should take a few days to consider our offer."
They walk into the centre and sit in the waiting area. Harry had spent the entire morning wondering if he should just call off the test. Why did he start learning to drive, anyway? He's fully qualified at Apparating and has portkeys, he can use the Floo network and the Ministry can even provide him with driverless cars.
And he saw it in the dungeons when he came down to Potions early to escape the hissing. Foot-high letters slashed into the walls, the flames burning bright and unmissable.
Harry drops his gaze from the sky and looks west, to the Celtic Sea. Somewhere across the horizon, across the ceaseless tides and winding currents, it will meet the North Atlantic Ocean. And all the oceans meet each other, and all the land becomes a never-ending constellation circling the world.
The sound of the sea grows ever closer. The wind is unrelenting now, catching ahold of Harry's clothes and yanking like a demanding child; it reddens his face with sharp slaps of sea air. At last, Harry's reached the edge of a cliff. The dark waves churn around the rocks below, the sea-foam the same colour as a stormy December sky. Somewhere out there, in the inky black horizon, the light of a ship winks as it cuts through the ocean. Harry edges closer to the cliff.
Harry looks down at Draco’s hand. A little portkey, in the shape of a Christmas bauble, rests on his palm.
In the rear-vision mirror, he can see Narcissa watching him. How many times did she watch her son drive away, disappearing into the distance? He applies just a little more acceleration. The car quickens its pace down the long driveway and then, finally, he slows slightly to turn onto the open road. It's a thin and winding country road. The same type of road on which Harry spent so many hours practising his own driving.
Nevertheless, it doesn't deter Draco, who — after a leisurely breakfast — insists on a coastal walk.
When he's back at his office, Harry pours the memory into the pensieve and wonders whether he should leave it until tomorrow. It's nearing five o'clock now, and he should be going home soon. But the temptation proves too much, and he enters the pensieve.
The next letter is from Astoria and is uncomfortable to read; it's full of heartfelt gratitude for 'bringing Draco home' and tells Harry that he's always welcome to visit her and Matthew, even though the case is closed.
Hermione is looking at him, her eyes still narrowed and expression unchanged. Ron is shaking his head and giving Harry a pitying expression.
Harry looks around the memory, but he can't see Malfoy anywhere. The shopkeeper — a portly man in robes of red, with receding grey hair — is handing a bag of something to a young witch.
“The worst thing,” Draco says, each word weighted with exhaustion, “is that even now, I’m not sure I want to come back. I ran away, just like my father. It’s all pointless now, isn’t it?”
It's a mild summer's day. The domes and onion-shaped minarets of the Royal Pavilion open into the sky, shining white in the light of the noon sun, and gardens stretch away from the buildings in lush sprawls of verdant green.
The owls — their letters finally delivered — perch along the hatstand, all of them looking prepared to briefly nap. Harry looks down at his desk, then opens the drawer and slowly removes the latest case — a young Staffordshire witch, with known mental health issues, has gone missing after she was supposed to attend an appointment with a Mind Healer. Harry writes a note for the Muggle Liaisons team to check local hospitals and homeless shelters, but after that he has problems concentrating. He feels like he should do something, but what? Draco needs Healers, not a...friend.
Draco drives on and on, the river and sky and road melting into a field of stars as the memory slowly disintegrates.
"The Auror division has certainly been downsized, now that the war is over. However, that doesn't mean your work is any less important," Williamson says firmly. Harry could almost smile, if he wasn't so bitter about it.
Harry gives her a wry smile and steps into the room, setting the file down on the kitchen table. He may as well get to the point, he thinks. They know each other too well to spend time dancing about a topic.
Harry is silent for a long time. He glances at the playground, staring at the empty swings, the worn tracks from where people made shortcuts across the grass. Desire paths, he thinks they’re called. When people create their own paths as opposed to using the set footpaths.
The sunrise is little more than a finger-smudge of pale blue, glimmering in the dark sky, but then it slowly brightens into a wide beacon of gold, like a snitch hovering on the horizon. And at last, it casts the first rays of brilliant light over the waves, outlining Draco sharply against the sky.
Narcissa doesn’t cry. She stares into the heart of the fireplace, at the bright flames flickering behind the grate, and her eyes are dry. All she ever wanted was her family to be complete, together again, and Harry’s heart suddenly aches for her.
Harry had been expecting a triumphant I-told-you-so. Something smug, something irritating. But that smug Draco was long ago washed away by war and weariness.
"These Muggles," she says, "will not be anywhere near the manor. They will be here. That's why I requested your presence. You can deal with them."
He's sitting in the passenger seat and gazing out the window, forehead pressed against the glass. Harry wonders if he's been there the whole time and he studies Draco's face. Is he unhappy that Harry is driving his car? Does he hate seeing someone else in the driver's seat?
been three years since you last drove, though, maybe you should — there's a car in front of us, it's slowing down for that red light, I hope you know — " He can't help the feeling of panic.
"You're good at investigating, too," Hermione retorts, frowning. "You've solved ten cases in eighteen months!"
“Congratulations on closing the Fenwick case,” Holdsworth says. She doesn’t smile. Only the faint warmth in her voice indicates any praise. “This is your latest assignation.”
They paused for a moment and then it became apparent. Draco Malfoy slunk around the corner, almost glued to a wall as if he wished it would swallow him. Behind him, a group of Ravenclaws and Gryffindors sniggered and whispered amongst them.
They take quite a meandering route to Dover, leaving the M2 to weave around the coastline, and the relatively short trip soon becomes a lengthy journey. They reach Margate at midnight — Dover is still about an hour away, Harry calculates. He's beginning to feel tired. Draco seems to notice, for he tells Harry to pull over and they switch seats.
Looking for himself, or maybe a memory. Maybe, after all this time, he's just looking for a state of mind.
"All right, so, you've checked your mirrors, adjusted your seat, put your seatbelt on, got your foot on the brake...turn the ignition, then."
, she had breathed. She always had the ambition and drive to own a place like this. Strong lines, clean forms and bold features. She'd been enchanted with London since she was a little girl, accompanying her father on trips to the Ministry and loving the rush of the city.
He wonders where they're going. He was supposed to be navigating, but he fell asleep somewhere in Devon and Draco's clearly got a destination in mind. Harry glances at his watch: eight o'clock. Surely they'll stop for the night soon?
As morning rolls across the sky, Draco suggests to driving to Brighton but Harry pleads exhaustion and they check in at a local bed-and-breakfast. The receptionist — an elderly woman who types with only one finger, one painful letter at a time — can't seem to stop staring at them. Harry is suddenly aware of his rumpled robes.
"Well...I shouldn't have insulted you," Harry mutters, distracted by the intensity of Draco's voice.
"I suppose we have something in common then." Draco lifts one shoulder in a careless shrug. "Fetch some glasses."
Harry has responsibilities. Things he left behind. People waiting for him. He doesn't want Hermione or Ron to worry, of course, and he wants to send them another owl, let them know he's all right. But he finds himself caring very little about everything else.
Harry says nothing. Draco seems to be a little slower than usual, as if he's still exhausted from the journey yesterday. They shouldn't have gone, Harry thinks.
"I'll be leaving tonight though, so we can practice all tomorrow on the Margate pitch." She grabs a practice Quaffle and shoves it into the bag. "Oh, how'd your case go?"
Harry visits his Investigative Division office before he leaves for the day. No, he thinks for a moment before wincing and shaking his head. No; not his office anymore.
, and everyone involved in the case — besides Astoria and Narcissa — has treated Draco's disappearance like it's a joke. The first case officer's notes are laughable.
It takes the best part an hour to leave London, but soon they're speeding along the M2. Draco speaks only to give directions, and Harry follows them wordlessly. They follow the lines of the land, curving along the wide highways and then breaking away to the smaller roads, the narrow and winding arteries that span the countryside and converge briefly upon a small parish before, once again, dividing and unravelling. They drive alongside a river for a long time. Harry asks for its name.
Harry puts his hands in his pockets. The Renault's keycard nudges against his fingers and there's something reassuring about the cool, smooth plastic.
If he listens carefully, he's certain he can hear someone whistling again, sending the notes into the gentle August sky.
Draco tried to measure out dried Gnargle hearts. His hand shook and the next moment the hearts had scattered all over the floor.
"Draco would just open the door," Narcissa says. "As long as the key was in his pocket or in his hand, the door would open."
A new scene forms, and for a moment Harry is disoriented. Then he remembers Astoria said she gave him memories, plural.
Harry had reacted so slowly, taken so much time to realise what was happening. He had fallen, landed on his knees, he knew it must have hurt but it was nothing, nothing compared to the pain of Draco Malfoy, screaming and twisting far above him in the sky, a sick mockery.
, she left a note on the fridge because she came home late after work last night and was really tired and...and yesterday! Yesterday — or maybe the day before — she asked if I could renew her Quidditch Weekly subscription..."
Draco pauses. "I'm alone," he says. Then he hesitates again. The air seems to shimmer around him and his body tenses. Harry realises what's about to happen and shakes his head.
They lapse into a natural silence. Harry starts the car again, his route decided, and merges onto the road. He hopes Draco will stay there, just watching the world pass by, but after a few minutes Draco speaks again.
"Going driving today?" Harry asks, deciding to make his presence known. He half-expects Draco to jump, but he just turns and glances at Harry as if he knew Harry was there all along.
Afterwards, when they’ve returned to their home, they peel off their water-heavy cloaks and damp clothes, and Harry lounges about invitingly by the warmth of the fire and pretends he’s got no idea what Draco’s little glances mean, until Draco gets fed up and drags him to the bedroom.
"Oh, he promised Molly he'd help clear out the broomshed, so — oh! That's another reason I'm here! Ginny mentioned she'd forgotten to grab her old Quidditch stuff and I said I could pick it up for her." Hermione's set her mug on the counter and is heading towards the spare room before Harry can utter a single response.
Later on, in the deep darkness of the night, Harry dreams of the long highways and dark fields, the endless roads all leading into a dawn the colour of canola fields, the colour of autumn leaves, the colour of a lazy summer afternoon. He gazes into the bright blaze of the cloudless sky, then steps forward.
Harry doesn't remember falling asleep, but when he wakes up the lights of Margate have long disappeared. Inky black fields surround them, and there's not another car in sight.
Harry slips the licence into his pocket, although he doesn't know why. It's unlikely to give new information no matter how much he studies it. He places the rest of the items back in the glovebox, then leans back and stares through the windscreen and at the timber walls of the stables.
It's a terrifying feeling. It's easy to lust after someone, to match their face to a missed heartbeat or a sharp intake of breath. It's easy to say,
"Well, you see, Potter, there was this marvelous Muggle invention in the 1960s, called a 'bank card' — "
"Well, we're not," Harry says, slightly embarrassed but trying to cover his error. "I've got some Muggle money on me — "
Harry hunts around the steering wheel, looking for the ignition. There's a button with 'Start' on it, and he presses it doubtfully.
"Got my wand?" he says, and Draco looks bewildered for a moment before he glances at the wand beside the sink.
He turns another corner. The bright summer memories fade, but it's all right. He's going home now. Straight ahead. No more corners, just a long stretch of road that rolls on and on.
“No, it’s true! He can’t even tell those tiny second years to leave off, he has to wait for somebody else to speak up for him — his worst enemy, in fact. He must really hate himself.”
Then he remembers Draco wearing precisely the sort of cold expression Harry is imagining as he told Astoria to go deliver her father's eulogy. Yes, Draco hides his thoughts and feelings well, cloaking them beneath apathy and arrogance.
"Don't start," she laughs. "I hear that all the time from Ron when he needs help tracing a Dark artefact or potion."
He's expecting to notice a change. The wand has switched allegiances again, of course, and there will be some resistance. But the wand seems to greet him like an old friend.
You’ll get your chance on Christmas Day, anyway, you and Dad will ramble about Muggle and magical stuff like usual. You’re
“What’s wrong with that?” Harry had retorted, feeling rather defensive, and Holdsworth’s mouth had thinned. She had set him a cold case as his first project — an ancient file from 1949 — and Harry had considered that a calculated insult. Not even something new and interesting, just old files regarding people long gone. He’d made a half-hearted attempt on it before delegating it to the bottom of his desk drawer. At least the Fenwick case was actually within the current decade; Harry regarded it as a slight upgrade.
"I never told you," she says, her voice low and hoarse. "I never said how grateful I was, that day you made me go and say my father's eulogy."
He's not really sure he wants to be an Auror anymore. He always wanted to, back when he was sixteen and coded the world according to simple dualities. Good or bad, black or white, better or worse.
Harry opens his mouth to protest, spots Hermione narrowing her eyes at him, and quickly changes tack. "All right," he says instead. "I'm going away for the weekend, anyway."
"What's the point in that?" Malfoy says, and there's a strange edge to his voice that Harry's never heard before. "Sitting in a box, only going where someone else takes you."
Nevertheless, he arrives at the manor at the expected time. It's still protected by wards, he finds, and he has to walk up the rather long driveway. He's half-expecting a house-elf or servant to greet him at the door, but it's Narcissa herself.
“Two drops a day, and your owl should be perfectly fine by the end of the week,” the man says kindly. The witch nods and gives him a handful of knuts, then turns and leaves.
Harry stares at the note for a second, then sets it aside. He stands for a long moment, thinking, then slowly turns to the two boxes stacked next to his bedside table and removes the disillusionment charm.
The car rumbles to life. Harry feels terrified and wonders how much the car cost and how mad Matthew might be if Harry, too, drove into the pond.
Harry finds his room with little difficulty. Draco would like it, he thinks. There's an expansive view over the emerald-green fields, leading to the dramatic drop of the cliffs. The ocean, bright in the setting sun of midsummer, looks tranquil and gentle, a far cry from the lashing waves of winter that last greeted Harry on this coast.
Malfoy crosses the room in a short number of strides and leaves, his footsteps fading down the hallway, and the memory dissolves to nothing.
He grins, though he’s careful to keep his voice casual. “She’ll never find out. She only stays there in the summer. There’ll be nobody there except us.”
“I can perform the spell,” Harry says at last, “but it won’t work very well. They told me to practise it for my role as Head Auror, and...” he trails off. “I hate it,” he says at last, staring at the swings slowly swaying. Then he turns to Draco and lifts his wand. “But I’ll try.”
"Definitely not. The team needs someone reliable, I heard them saying." Ron catches Hermione's expression. "What? Just telling the truth."
"Look," he says, reaching for Draco's hand. Draco looks startled, but doesn't pull away when Harry wraps his hand around Draco's. "When you were trapped in time, we couldn't make contact, could we? So this must be real."
Harry had been surprised when he first disarmed Draco, seizing the wand and fleeing with it. He'd expected the wand to be resistant and somehow unfriendly (though he'd absolutely dreaded using Bellatrix's wand). But the wand had been no different than using, for example, Hermione's, and had proved itself an excellent wand in lieu of Harry's own.
Something is baking, Harry thinks, inhaling the sweet aroma of sugary pastry. He steps over a rag doll and frowns. He didn't realise Astoria had a child.
Harry goes out onto the balcony again. The sun is setting over London, silhouetting the buildings starkly against the pale blue sky.
“We didn’t even do any practice, just read all about the potion and its properties!” complained Ron bitterly.
But Ron opened the third drawer down and pulled out something. Harry's favourite shirt. Dark green, Slytherin green.
"Think Malfoy'd prefer to be alive than to keep a promise," Ron says, and Harry turns away, knowing Ron's right and hating the choice he must make.
But there's a sound like glass exploding, like someone's thrown a mirror across the room, and pure agony flashes across Draco's face just a second before he suddenly vanishes into thin air.
"Sounds stressful," Harry says, taking off his robes and hanging them behind the door. "You know, we should do something relaxing next week. Just us, together."
"This is an early yield," Draco says at last, nodding at the field. "We should come back in August, when most of the spring-sown crops will be harvested." He puts his hands in his pockets and leans back, looking overhead at the cloudless blue sky. "When I was a child, I knew summer was coming to an end when the canola fields turned from bright yellow to dull brown." He smiled faintly, still gazing up into the endless blue. "And the hay meadows would be cut, and overrun with wildflowers. That's when I knew summer was ending."
"This doesn't make sense. All signs point to a forced disappearance," Harry says, frustrated. "Draco didn't just run away."
"Yeah, well," Ron says, glancing over at Hermione and lowering his voice, "friendship can do a lot of things, but it can't get you a shag."
The fifteenth lists the sex as male, the age 18-25. Hair and eye colour unknown. Found on the twenty-first of January 2004, washed up near Rosenithon Point, Cornwall.
And with that single word, Harry had been assigned to work with the Investigative Division for the next eighteen months. He hadn’t been very pleased about it and there had been considerable mutterings about ‘missed fieldwork’. His supervisors had been suitably soothing, telling Harry he already outclassed every Auror as far as practical wandwork was concerned and there was no need to worry about his skills growing rusty.
"Doesn't matter. Mum's got visions of weddings and grandchildren." Ron takes a swig of his firewhiskey. "I know a bloke up Norfolk way, does fake passports quite cheap. I'll give you his details."
Matthew frowns. "She's just putting Sophie to bed. Listen, is this about her ex-husband? She's been very upset lately. Maybe you should talk about it tomorrow."
"Not at all. Tea or coffee?" he asks, hoping Narcissa will refuse both. The only tea available is builder's tea, and the coffee is a cheap instant powder kept only for Arthur Weasley's infrequent visits.
Draco glances at him, still smiling faintly. "Of course. It was my home, wasn't it? All those days I spent running through the wheat-fields and climbing trees...I used to catch frogs by the creek, and make little sailboats from old copies of the Daily Prophet...I always thought those little boats would eventually find their way to the ocean. They might leave England, but I never would."
“Each one required a time-turner to rescue the trapped person,” she says quietly. “And not just any time-turner, but the same one the person used to travel to the other time.”
Another long pause. Then Draco speaks quietly. "I dream of the other time, the one I was trapped in. Sometimes, when I wake up, it's...confusing." His grip tightens on the potion vial. "I'd rather not lose my mind, so..."
He looks up. It's a half-moon tonight. The same lunar phase as when he first dreamed of the Cornish coast.
He waits for Matthew to gape at him, or at least stare at his scar. But not a trace of recognition seems to cross Matthew's face.
They're standing in the middle of the sky, he thinks for a moment, his heart missing a beat. For a moment, he feels dizzy. Stars below and above, and any moment Draco will step into the air, lead Harry to the constellations, to the fine dust and star-scattered clouds of the night. He reflexively grips Draco's hand tightly for a moment, as if afraid that he'll fall if he lets go.
"You're seriously still sulking over that?" Draco demands. "Unbelievable, Potter. Yes, I was slightly annoyed at the time, but I was well over it by the time we checked out. Unlike you, I don't hold grudges."
He reached out and touched Draco’s wrist. Draco was holding his spoon; he clenched it suddenly, his hand flexing.
He wishes they were angry with him. It'd be easier if they were angry. They'd speak crossly with him, and Harry would nod and agree that yes, he's clearly had a lapse in judgement...
He really doesn't feel like company tonight, but he promised Ron and Hermione. Harry removes his work robes and hangs them up, then stares blankly at his wardrobe for a long time before closing the door. He's gotten used to not wearing robes, especially during the last three weeks. He'd bought jeans and t-shirts during the impromptu road trip; Draco had purchased far more formal clothes and kept them neatly pressed regardless of what godforsaken time of the night they were driving. The observation had made Harry smile at the time.
“Yes.” Draco smiled in relief. Harry nodded and smiled, the first time he had done so directed at Draco. He stood up and left. Draco presumed Hermione had banished him to the library for missed homework.
, he sees. He sets it aside and peers into the glovebox. There's an auto-inking quill but nothing else.
"Does it take a lot of effort to stay here?" Harry asks, wondering if Draco will suddenly vanish again. "Are you going to leave again?"
Harry stands outside the office door. He's been pacing the hallway for a good twenty minutes, a stack of papers in one hand. Thrice, in his restless pacing, he's nearly run into ruffled-looking secretaries.
"The day the war ended," Draco says at last, "I promised myself I would never take orders from anyone again."
Harry leans across the bed and pulls Draco's notebook towards him. It's a 2003 calendar and diary, filled with neatly written but mundane dates. Weekly withdrawals from Gringotts, scheduled in like clockwork; a reminder to renew his car registration. The final note was written on the day Draco disappeared.
Hermione glances up at him as he paces around her kitchen. Then she returns her doubtful gaze to the cup of tea sitting before her on the table.
my possessions, I said. And if I recall correctly, you used to carry my driver's licence around sometimes. And my car keycard was frequently in your pocket."
"That was nice," Ginny says afterwards when they're both preparing for bed. "Did you enjoy it, Harry?"
He smiles to himself. Hagrid — busy pacing about and muttering to himself — pauses and glances at him before pointing at the ground near his feet.
The file is quite slim, and Harry would guess there's only fifteen or so cases. He dismisses the first twelve cases; the bodies were all found prior to 2003. The thirteenth case consists of nothing more than a partial jawbone found in woodland in Devon, and Harry dismisses that one. The fourteenth sets the age at 50-70.
A footstep. Harry opens his eyes; he hadn't realised he'd closed them. The mechanics are long gone. Narcissa stands in the doorway of the tack room, observing him silently.
Harry nods and leaves, and finally — in the privacy of his bedroom — he can bite his lip hard enough to taste blood, and sit on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands, his palms pressed against his eyes until he sees sparks. The anger's still there, but now a rush of sorrow is coursing through him, and there's confusion too, and worry and almost panic, and hidden in all of that is a hint of happiness and relief. He takes a slow, deep breath, and stands, taking another moment to compose himself before returning to the kitchen. Draco's made himself a cup of tea, Harry sees, and somehow it's reassuring.
No matter which way he looks at it, he has to admit his presumptions are wrong. Draco Malfoy certainly did not ‘disappear’ to a luxury estate somewhere. All the circumstances are leading to the most probable scenario: Malfoy was forcibly taken away. He had been dressed warmly for the autumn weather but otherwise travelled light, with no sign of luggage. He’d mentioned running other errands and hadn’t wanted to carry the owl around with him while he completed them.
Harry's heart belongs to the rambling houses of stone and wood, the homes that first captured his heart: Hogwarts, a ramshackle and ancient beast of stone and magic and, later on, the Burrow with its cosy rooms and meandering gardens.
Harry, taught well by now to look at every detail, catches the look of brief surprise that flashes across her face. She's wearing a casual sundress, printed with roses, and her sun-streaked hair is pulled back into a half-hearted ponytail. Not the way she'd present herself usually, Harry guesses, and he smiles apologetically.
"Your latest case is a missing horse, then?" Ginny nods at the boxes Harry had set down beside the front door. "Oh, I meant to tell you — we're playing the Stratford Skylarks on Saturday, there's going to be an International Quidditch scout there!"
He was in that kind of mood today, when the day felt bright and new and he thought maybe he could be better.
No reply. Draco feels very warm, though, and Harry, after some hesitation, places a hand against Draco's forehead.
Draco's gaze suddenly refocuses and Harry realises that Draco's staring at him in the reflection of the window. Watching Harry watching him.
Narcissa considers that. "I'll accept those terms," she says, then stands up. "Would you like to see the car?"
“Come on, then,” Draco says to Harry, looking irritated. But as they turn and walk to the door, his expression softens. “My Harry,” he repeats.
Harry groans and sets his cup of tea aside, burying his head in his hands. "It's not about that, either! It's not about obligation or a sense of duty."
If Draco took Harry's wand, surely it was for a good reason. Draco hasn't got a wand, Harry remembers. He'd borrowed his mother's, Harry knows, but he left it behind when he vanished and, Harry realises, he's been wandless since. Maybe he needed to perform a spell, for some reason, and he didn't want to wake Harry so...
He watches the memory again. Eleven times in total, and it's going nowhere. This is the hardest part of solving cases, Harry thinks. Getting started. Looking for something, but nobody knows what it is. It's like trying to find a book without knowing the title or author.
"I wasn't thinking at all, really," Harry admits. "I just...it wasn't because of work. I left because..."
He doesn't know what to do. And it's ridiculous, but he's terrified of saying the wrong thing, of sending Draco straight back out that door. He wants to demand explanations and answers, yes, but now isn't the time. Draco looks so exhausted, like he's been through hell and back, and so Harry simply remains silent and waits.
supposed to mean? He simply doesn't like jewellery, or perhaps found the ring too bothersome — always losing it or something — or some deeper meaning Harry's failed to grasp?
He stocked up on toast, yawning hugely, and retreated. It occurred to Draco that Ron had woken early and come down just to tell him that.
Or the Renault Mégane, but then Harry remembers it might not exist in whatever time era Draco is caught in. Regardless, he searches the Renault and finds nothing. The time-turner would need to be hidden extremely well to prevent it from being stolen or found by the wrong sort of person, but surely Draco would have left clues...
He drives the long and winding country roads, past fields still tipped with sunlight in the late sunset of summer. The coast disappears behind him, the windblown cliffs giving way to open grassland. Harry can see the bright light of the sun in his rearview mirror, a brilliant and final spark of defiance streaming across the horizon. Soon, the bright sunset has faded to little more than a fingerprint of pale purple, a soft bruise across the sky. In the south, the moon is a pale ghost in the faint light of dusk, and the first stars appear. That's what Harry always missed, when he lived in London. The smog-thick night never gave him a sky full of stars.
, she had told her father once, and on the day they bought the apartment, she had laughed with the joy of achieving a long-lost childhood dream.
He opens the driver’s door and sits down, glancing into the rearview mirror. He can see himself, but at the same time it’s not him. For a moment, his green eyes fade to grey.
"I should return," he says. "I have obligations. My mother has organised several social functions for me to attend, and Astoria wants to meet with the solicitor — "
that!" Astoria says as Malfoy takes the wheel again. "Merlin, how do the Muggles do this? It's — watch out for that car!"
The car jerks forward violently and Harry, horrorstruck, slams the brake on and comes to an equally violent stop. Matthew starts laughing.
She hugs him briefly and then steps into the fireplace, Flooing away. Harry stands alone in the empty apartment, the silence seeming to ring out around him like ripples.
Harry bites back an angry retort. He didn't realise he'd been invited here solely to act as some sort of Muggle interpreter.
— but then he thinks of the apartment, the concrete box in the sky, with its dusty countertops and empty rooms, the silence that weighs heavy on his sleepless nights.
"Make me!" Harry laughs and picks up speed; behind him, the footsteps quicken. Harry takes a sharp left, feeling the thin stalks of the canola plants feather through his fingers. He zig-zags his way across the field, running faster and faster until all he can hear is the blood thumping in his ears, the effort of breathing in his throat, and then he pauses. He can't hear footsteps behind him anymore.
Fields of wheat wash up on each side of the road like a tide of gold. It's high summer, Harry thinks, staring into the cloudless blue sky. For a moment, he wonders where Malfoy's driving. Maybe he's going nowhere. Maybe one day, he just got into his car and drove and drove and never stopped.
"I suppose you're wondering why I want to fix it," Harry says, needing a little bit of courage to say it. He'd been hoping Narcissa wouldn't ask, and she hasn't so far, but he's certain she wants to know.
“I'll just go then,” he said, his voice barely audible above the rain. “Please tell me if Harry turns up. I just want to know he's okay. That we're okay.”
Harry Disapparates to the location where Lucius was captured and tries to Accio the time-turner, to no avail. Perhaps Draco left it behind; perhaps he dropped it just before vanishing. It could be a possibility, Hermione tells Harry, but her voice is doubtful.
He's always shied away from the media, and he's notoriously difficult to pin to paper. Hermione and Ron will cover for him, but his work colleagues will no doubt notice his unexplained absence and whisper among themselves. And soon, the whispering will reach the ever-alert antennae of Rita Skeeter.
“Yes — it might be best if you go, Draco,” Shacklebolt had said quietly, and Draco stormed from the room. He listened on the other side for ages but all he heard was indistinct voices and then his mother had ushered the Minister out politely and told Draco “Everything is alright now.” But it wasn’t, with these voices hissing at him, the faces melting into shadows…they sounded like snakes…
"He liked circles." Narcissa turns the photograph over and glances about the table; Harry wordlessly hands her the quill and she accepts it, writing a sentence on the back of the photograph. "In incepto finis est," she says. "In the beginning is the end. When Draco first found out what I did during the battle — the lie I told to the Dark Lord — he said that to me. In incepto finis est."
“Doesn’t that take ages?” Theo demanded. Harry glanced at him; he half-expected Draco to chime in too, sneering something derogatory about the lesson. But Draco was evidently engrossed in trying to read some graffiti someone had scrawled on his desk, nearly jumping when Slughorn resumed speaking again.
A 2002 Renault Mégane coupé. Harry remembers the first time he saw it, the canvas falling away in swathes, the dust dancing through the air. It isn't a luxury car; it isn't anything spectacular. But it's Draco's car, and Harry misses it as much as he misses Draco. As much as he misses a clear night sky, and highways and Christmas tree lights and windswept cliffs and canola fields and the way Draco's eyes would flick to the rear-vision mirror.
Harry lets the shopkeeper chatter on as he leads Harry over to the back corner of the shop. The owls are roosting along the wooden beams, blinking sleepily as Harry walks beneath them.
"If you want to protect your family, Father, I suggest investing in a time-turner and reconsidering some key choices you made twelve years ago."
But to his surprise, she shakes her head. "Astoria says you received your car licence. Much like an Apparation licence, I suppose." She doesn't look at Harry; instead, she stares at the car. "You want to drive it. And I think Draco would like to see it driven again." She glances at Harry. "Sometimes, it seems you genuinely want to find my son."
Draco looks at him. He looks terrible, Harry thinks. Thin and exhausted. Shadows beneath his eyes. Clearly, these efforts to appear are taking their toll.
he’d said, and then Narcissa had murmured something about Lucius that Draco couldn’t quite catch, and then she’d told him to leave the room.
The words roll across Harry's mind like waves breaking. He blinks, his smile fading, and begins reading again.
He knocks on the bedroom door at six, then again at eight, thinking Draco might want a meal. When there's still no reply, he begins to worry.
"My arrival is ill-timed," Narcissa comments, and Harry quickly shakes his head. Narcissa is already beginning to look doubtful and the last thing he wants is for her to flee, taking any useful information with her.
He sits on a tussock of coastal grass instead, a long piece of driftwood resting against his leg like a rifle. He gazes up into the bleak sky, then drops his gaze to the ocean. The waves crest over and over. Rain speckles the sand. Draco is a lone figure searching amongst the coarse grasses.
"I know," Ginny says apologetically. "I only got back from practice twenty minutes ago. Gwen reckons me and Pearson are the best players, and we're the ones the scout might be taking notes on. She must've made me practice the dives a dozen times."
"Longbottom also enjoyed watering plants and wore argyle jumpers. Let's face it, he was never a teenager."
Holdsworth looks at him, tilting her head as she does whenever she finds something particularly interesting. "Disappearing people are our specialty," she says, then turns and leaves.
"They most certainly are not. We use lacewings and beetle eyes — they use..." Draco tilts his head, staring at the label, "...Dextromethorphan."
He arrives at the manor just as the sun is setting. An anxious-looking house-elf answers the door and stares at him.
"Had a chat to Malfoy's solicitor?" Ron asks shrewdly. His time as an Auror has cultivated a surprising amount of cunning.
Harry stops. In the distance, he can still hear the children laughing. Closer to him is the soft sound of the waves breaking over the rocks.
, because then the whole story can unravel: Matthew, who's married to Astoria. Astoria, who Harry met through working Draco's case and speaking to Narcissa. Narcissa, who gave Harry the Renault Mégane, which is right now parked at their apartment. The Renault Mégane, which is so important because Draco loved to drive it everywhere. Draco, who appears in memories to help Harry, who has observed him for months, who's changed his mind about Harry in the same way Harry changed his mind about Draco. Draco, who once said
They finish their tea in silence, then Ginny says she's meeting up with Wanda, the team's seeker and her best friend.
The old Draco would have darkened with anger, he thinks, or sputtered with indignation, immediately retorting that he had loads of friends, thank you very much, and a very expensive house and house-elves and was never left wanting for anything.
“See you all on Christmas Day, then?” Ron asks, settling his cloak around his shoulders. “Fair warning, Mum’s gone overboard this year and made matching scarves and hats for everyone.”
Then he slowly turns and walks across the field. The wheat rolls away in every direction, an ocean of gold. In the distance, there’s a thin black road cutting across the land like a scar, a Renault Mégane parked along it.
“Oh,” he says, and he tries to pick up the ring but drops it; his hands are trembling a little. Draco will no doubt be amused, he thinks, but Draco doesn’t laugh. He comes over to Harry and leans down to pick up the ring, brushing the snow from it, and hands it to Harry.
They do. Harry thanks them for the meal, and promises to see them at the Burrow on Christmas Day, and says Sophie might have perhaps too many presents this year, and Astoria admonishes him for spoiling her. Draco was the one who bought all the presents, but Harry — in penance for his earlier jokes with Matthew — takes the blame. They linger by the front door, full of farewells, and then step into the cold night, drawing their cloaks around themselves —
Harry wonders if he might have seen Draco's constellation tonight, the polar stars shining bright over the mountains and valleys.
"You could've been a lot more supportive," Harry mutters, sitting down beside Ron and opening the butterbeer. "I'm your oldest friend."
Draco glanced up. Ron held it out, the material soft in his hand, Harry's scent embedded permanently in the soft cotton.
He looks up. Draco stands across the room, facing away from Harry, looking out across the London skyline, one hand resting on the cool glass.
She shakes her head. “I’ll need to research it. Perhaps talk to some Unspeakables — they know about this sort of magic. But Harry, you must know that there’s only three recorded cases of this happening. It’s so rare to diagnose because nobody ever knows — someone’s usually secretly using a time-turner, and one day they just vanish and that’s it. But of the three recorded cases...”
"Oh, very funny! Hey — where are you going?" Harry asks as Draco drops his arms and turns, poised to flee.
"It's a nice view," Draco continues, as if he hadn't spoken moments before. "But this isn't you, is it, Potter? This is nothing. A concrete box in the sky." He leans so close to the glass, Harry can see his breath mist over it. "You need something grounded. Something real."
The Renault is recovering very well from its three-year abandonment, and the engine purrs smoothly when Harry starts the car. He pauses for a moment, then reaches for the maps kept in the glovebox. Why not take a scenic route to Wiltshire? He'll be two hours late anyway; what's another hour matter? Draco has drawn a line along the coastal roads. Draco likes the coast, Harry thinks. Liminal places. People are drawn to those sorts of areas, where lines are blurred and dualities are drawn. Land and water but not quite both, not quite either.
"Oh." Harry suddenly remembers another question. "Listen — if this is Legilimency, is it you doing it, or someone else? Is someone there with you?"
, he'd said, but that had been three years ago when he first proposed to Ginny. And he somehow never got round to unpacking.
“Just hurry up, would you, or we’ll be late. To our first potions class!” added Hermione, and clearly this crime rated up there along with ‘playing Quidditch instead of studying’, ‘daydreaming in class’, and ‘writing in huge loopy letters to fill up the last four inches of a Charms essay’ (this hadn’t worked; Professor Flitwick had made Ron re-submit it).
Malfoy looks in need of a good meal, but Harry had expected the thinness from the file information. He looks a little tired, Harry thinks, noting the faint shadows beneath Malfoy’s eyes. Still, nothing particularly notable; nothing more than Harry would look after a long day at the office. He spoke without his usual arrogance, affecting a politely bland tone, but Harry can’t detect anything else unusual about Malfoy. He watches as the shopkeeper makes his recommendations and Malfoy selects a very ordinary looking barn owl.
"I thought I'd be trapped forever. She kept going on about the native plants along the coastal tracks."
The surroundings construct themselves around Harry. He's standing in a hallway — most likely in the manor. Narcissa is beside him, listening intently — eavesdropping, he realises. The raised voices are drifting from a room just across from them, the door slightly ajar.
Harry looks around, but there's no lighthouse. There's nothing. Not even a window of light from a house, or distant headlights. Only the half-moon overhead illuminates the scene, casting a faint glow over the ocean.
Harry sits silently in the room for a long time, watching the sun slowly diminish in the sky. The sun won't set for another hour or so. Summer is slowly unfurling across the country. Distantly, he can hear the faint chimes of Big Ben, marking half-five. Someone will no doubt be along shortly to usher Harry out. Footsteps echo along the corridor and Harry exhales slowly, then looks at Draco.
"No," Draco says at once, and hurt blossoms like a bruise in Harry's heart. Draco glances in the rear-vision mirror before he changes lanes, overtaking a slow car. When he speaks next, his voice is softer. "For that to happen, we'd have to reverse eight years of assumptions and change our beliefs, our values." Draco shakes his head. "Impossible."
"He's not like that anymore, he's changed. He wouldn't have run away. You don't understand, you haven't seen the memories." He taps his knuckles impatiently against the table. "If he was forcibly taken away, it doesn't make sense that he'd just show up a few months later with Lucius Malfoy, have him arrested, then Disapparate again. And it wouldn't explain why he's still missing now." Harry pauses, aware of Hermione and Ron both observing him carefully.
The third letter is from Hermione and consists of an envelope full of clippings and notes from books, detailing side-effects of time-splinching.
Malfoy turns and takes a step closer to the owls, nearly walking into Harry; Harry instinctively ducks away.
"May I help you?" he asks blandly. Harry's taken a polyjuice potion — selected randomly from the wide stock of Ministry potions — for the sake of avoiding recognition. It's easier this way, when he's investigating witnesses.
Harry nods, then changes the topic. "Those boxes at the manor...are they truly all of Draco's possessions?"
Draco is directly across the hallway, Harry notes as he unlocks his own door to reveal a spacious and neatly-presented room. There's an excellent ocean view but he's too tired to appreciate it. "I'm having a nap," he tells Draco, half-expecting him to say he's going for a walk. But Draco just nods and unlocks his own room, disappearing inside.
Draco looks at him. He looks like he did when they last met — all formal robes and impeccable appearance — and Harry's still waiting for that coolness, that raised eyebrow and faint sneer, but Draco walks straight in as if he owns the place, unclasps his cloak, and tosses it on the kitchen counter. And there's something reassuring about the way he does it, as if he's casting aside a mask that he wears for everyone else except Harry.
There was another long silence. Ron waited patiently, his heart suddenly catching as he realised Hermione's shoulders were shaking.
He accompanies her to the door, wondering what he should ask about Malfoy. What information could possibly prove useful? He doesn't know where to start.
"Never wanted to. When you're a child...the world is as big as your bedroom, isn't it? The universe is a three-mile diameter around your childhood home. Knowing every river, every field, seems like an impossible task. Let alone conquering the counties beyond Wiltshire."
"Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll try to be more predictable," Harry teases, refusing to be drawn into an argument. This is what happened last time, he reminds himself. Both of them taking everything far too seriously and getting defensive over nothing. "Let me guess, now's the part where I storm off and you sulk for hours?"
, until Harry wants to beat his head against the wall or just go to the cellar and Avada Kedavra them all just to put them out of their damn misery —
“What’s a Niffler?” Matthew demands, hoisting Sophie onto the kitchen counter. She eyes the leftover pudding with a calculating expression.
“Could be Fenwick,” he says. “He went missing March 2001. Found his broom not far from here. Might be a match.” He doesn’t get his hopes up, though; too many failed matches have taught him caution.
And maybe he views it as a failure — running away three years ago — but he came back, and then he ran away again after their argument — but he came back. Four days, but he came back and apologised.
"Don't be daft, go and have fun," Harry says, and Ginny smiles as she kisses him again in farewell, rushing out the door again. A moment later, there's a brief pop as she Disapparates.
Zeisel gives his badge another considered look, and for a moment he thinks she's about to say something sharp about client confidentiality.
The headlights cut through the dark night, the road lined with ancient Welsh oaks, their branches arching over the sky.
He took out the wand. If Harry had seen him in the room, he must have seen him pick up the wand. He held it now and his fingers shook only ever so slightly. He stood up and Harry met him in between the Slytherin and Ravenclaw tables. When he held the wand out his hand shook badly but Harry simply wrapped his hand around the wand too, helping hold it steady.
"You're on the second floor, on the eastern side," she says cheerfully. "Breakfast is served from seven to nine, and we have maps and brochures available for your perusal. Enjoy your stay."
The familiar rolling motion hits him and he knows immediately he's in a car again. Draco's car. The Renault Mégane. It feels strange now that he's physically been in the car. Like two versions of him are intersecting. There's an odd duality about it.
know your name?" She pauses, then sighs. "Sorry, I've been stuck here all day waiting for a Healer to give us some news, any news — Sophie, don't touch people's hair, it isn't polite — and it's just been a nightmare."
He doesn't have to guess. Judging by the amount of Quidditch gear she's shoving into her bag, and looking at the little washbag sitting on her bedside table, her team won their first match of the season.
He could pretend. That if he turns around, it will be December. All dark inside the apartment, only the glow of tiny lights illuminating the room. Draco will be standing by the tree.
important, he reminds himself irritably. Elderly people, losing their life savings to greedy criminals...of course it's important. Far more important than, for example, bringing someone home.
Five minutes later, Harry watches a hawk-owl fly out from the owlery, its wings spread against the blue sky, the faint outline of a letter upon its leg as it disappears into the distance.
Of course, there would no doubt be far more outrageous reports if anyone found out he'd gone missing suddenly.
"Maybe you should have asked Malfoy where he is, then," Hermione says, and Harry's not sure whether she's teasing him or not.
"She told you that?" He frowns, wondering if it matters if the two regularly keep each other updated.
"Narcissa and I got into an argument. Draco still looked terrible and I said he should at least stay for another day. But Narcissa was insistent that he return to the manor and kept going on about quality of care." Astoria exhales sharply. "Honestly, she can be so
Harry stands in the middle of his empty apartment. The sun has nearly set now, eclipsing the apartment in cold shadows. He slowly, methodically pours a neat scotch and goes out to the balcony, listening. But nobody's whistling songs about southerly winds tonight, and the lights of the trains seem even more distant.
Harry thinks he should give Astoria a moment alone. Narcissa should be here soon; he'd expected her to rush into St Mungo's very shortly after sending the owl, but it's possible she's been out all day and is yet to receive the message.
He lifts Draco's hand, bringing his wrist higher, and kisses the soft skin just beneath the inky tail of the Dark Mark.
He looks across the room, to the dining table. A quill and inkwell in one corner, the edges of the table already gathering dust again since his last Scourgify. The white walls gleam, untouched by pictures or photographs.
Hermione nods. “Trying to break the rules of causality...it would be like trying to Disapparate to two different places at once.”
“Not again!” Harry snapped and the whispering paused. He looked amongst the faces for familiar ones but found most of them to be around second or third year. Finally he noted an eighth year. “Zacharias — what’s going on?”
He departs with a handful of Floo powder before Matthew can retort. Hermione follows in a more dignified manner, kissing Astoria’s cheek and thanking her for dinner before stepping into the green flames. Then Ginny, giving a cheerful wave as she goes.
"And perhaps a quote, carved into the frame? You'll have to give it some careful thought. Your father selected a Seneca quote about power, if I recall correctly. Perhaps you'll choose something similar?"
But towards the end, he kept thinking it would be nice. Pleasant, even, to simply let go. He'd be with his parents again, and Sirius, and — as the battle raged on — Remus. All of them smiling, welcoming him.
"Or books that other people have left lying around and you've picked them up, skimmed a few paragraphs, and put them back down again."
He goes downstairs at seven and takes an hour to eat breakfast. His appetite seems to have vanished. He wonders if he should go back home, but there is no home. The apartment is nothing more than a box in the sky. Hogwarts — his first home, his real childhood home — is forever gone, accessible only by memory. It's home to a thousand other children now, and it's a bittersweet thought. And everywhere else in his life he's merely been a visitor, a stranger. He may have lived with the Dursleys for seventeen years, but it was never home; he may have considered The Burrow his home too, but the people have long gone — Ginny always travelling, the rest all moved out or married — and the rooms are empty.
There's a brief and childish tussle over the bathroom. Draco wins after clocking Harry over the head with his toothbrush.
"You trust easily." The words are uttered more from surprise than anything else; the Narcissa Malfoy he remembers certainly wouldn't trust him with her son's precious memories or secrets.
"What, not wearing his ring? I don't know. Could mean anything. Maybe his marriage was falling apart; maybe he lost the ring; maybe he just doesn't like wearing it."
"You are being very obstinate," Lucius snaps. "This is an opportunity, Draco. Stay here if you wish — hiding in the manor, where those who will seek revenge cannot harm you — and when you are tired of that caged existence, I will contact the appropriate people and organise your journey to Crete. I am doing this to protect you and your mother — "
Draco's frown deepens. Harry, guessing at his concerns, adds, "I won't mention you at all." He shoves the letter toward Draco; he's kept it short and succinct, telling Hermione and Ron that he felt like a short break, he's gone away for a short trip, he's completely fine, and he looks forward to seeing them again soon.
“Draco isn't feeling well,” he said, and although Slughorn made a great show of saying 'hmm' and 'we'll see', he agreed to help. Harry dropped copious hints about how he considered Slughorn to be one of his favourite professors. Slughorn cheered up a lot after that and was a lot more amiable about giving Draco his Panacis potion.
"It's not that bad," Harry says. "I mean, Ginny's not devastated or anything, it was really quite mutual —"
Astoria looks at him then, and anger seems to overtake her grief. "You don't even care, do you?" She steps to the door, resting her hand on the wrought-iron handle. "Sometimes I wonder why I married someone so selfish and unkind."
not going. Yesterday, when I asked the receptionist if I could book in, she gave me a thirty-minute dissertation on the local walking trails."
Harry sits at the dining table. Neither he nor Ginny use it particularly often, although there's an inkwell and quill in the corner for letter-writing. There's a faint patina of dust over the table. He mutters a discreet Scourgify.
He was never particularly fond of the apartment before — it simply existed, like gravity, and he had to tolerate it. However, now he finds himself actively tormented by it every evening. The empty kitchen, the white walls that make him feel like he's in an office instead of a house. Normal people have photographs of their family and friends, he reminds himself, and he tries sticking a picture of him, Hermione, and Ron to the wall, but it looks strange. A small photograph in the centre of a vast expanse of white emptiness. It just makes him feel immeasurably sad.
“I’ll perform the spells, then we’ll be out of your way,” he says tersely. The woman waits, hand hovering impatiently over the shutter release button.
Even Astoria didn't bother to contact Harry. But why would she or Narcissa have bothered, after all?
Harry feels absolutely terrible about lying, and he knows he's been behaving so distant lately, and he's been dreadfully on edge this week... He waits for Ginny to say something about it, but she kisses him and wishes him luck with the case before portkeying to Swindon.
They stand in silence for a long time, standing together, stars reflected above and below, and Harry feels like he's running on air.
Harry wishes he could fix the car himself. It seems important, somehow, that he's the one to fix it all. But when he started going through the list with Matthew, it became apparent that the car needed a lot more than a new battery. Brakes, calipers, disks, cylinders, pads, steering joints and track rods...everything would need to be checked and possibly replaced, depending on how well Draco had kept his car and how it had been treated after his disappearance. Then the petrol would need to be properly drained, the engine would need to be flushed...
It's a bedroom. There's a bed in the corner, with hunter-green covers, although its hard to tell from the layer of dust over it. A bedside table, a dresser, and a neat stack of boxes in the corner. Harry turns to look at Narcissa, but she sees the question in his face without him uttering a word.
The fourth carton is filled with personal possessions, items of which Harry can only guess the history. A set of photographs of picturesque countryside, several books (a well-thumbed car manual and a set of Hogwarts textbooks), a notebook, an origami rose, a bottle of aged whiskey, and a school tie. When Harry picks up the tie, it unravels and sends a prefect's badge spinning across the floor.
Harry has no doubt that Draco — in a pique of frustration after trying to pen a suitably formal letter — wrote this particular message with the intention that it would never be read by anyone, ever, let alone Harry himself. There's a strange honesty and directness in the letter and Harry finds it difficult to imagine Draco — with his cold expressions and inability to express himself beyond childish insults — wrote it.
The first signs of autumn are beginning to chill the lingering touch of summer. The soil is damp with early rain and, as Astoria greets Harry and takes him to the kitchen, he sees the little reminders of autumn: a small woodpile by the hearth, a vase of marigolds — the last of a late summer bloom — on the table. The kitchen hearth burns a gentle fire, consisting mostly of glowing coals. The weather is still too warm to justify a roaring blaze.
"Back in a minute," Harry says. He just needs a moment to collect himself, without Draco observing him.
It's a rushed letter from Narcissa. She had been visiting a friend's country estate in the Highlands and has only just returned. The letter is short and consists of little more than a brief reason for her absence and a sentence stating she will be along to St Mungo's directly.
"Just remember, they're only words. They can't hurt you," Draco says conversationally, dropping his wet jacket onto Harry's bed.
Hermione looks around the owlery. She'd agreed to visit the pensieve memory with him, if only for Harry to demonstrate his success.
"That's not right. I don't think you should mess with people's heads like that. It's not good for them, surely."
“Three years,” she says. “Three years. Merlin, I just want it to be over. You never really stop searching...”
”We’re not there yet.” Draco holds out his hand. “I’m afraid the trip is too long, even for us. Magic will take us the rest of the way.”
In his hands the stillness waited; his lips waiting for song, his body keen and strung for any wind to play.
He snapped his eyes back to the teacher in front, who looked familiar. Perhaps he saw him briefly in the Battle.
"These are his things," Narcissa says, tilting her head towards the boxes stacked in the corner. It's a very small pile, Harry thinks critically. Is it really the contents of a whole house?
"They reckon we don't need to. Set up surveillance and some tracing charms, should be able to take the scammers down within a week."
In the afternoon, they’ll visit Narcissa, who will be perfectly cordial to Harry and greet him with a perfunctory kiss on the cheek, and it might be easy to mistake her cool composure for a hidden chilliness. But Harry knows better, and later on Draco will most certainly notice that Narcissa’s gift to Harry is slightly more expensive than her one to Draco, and will accuse her of blatant favouritism, and Narcissa will laugh and say nothing. Later on, in the evening, they’ll go to the drawing room, and Narcissa will drag out all the childhood photographs of Draco, much to Harry’s delight and Draco’s dismay.
"Those fields," Harry says, awestruck. Fields of bright yellow line the narrow road, stretching away until the brilliant yellow meets the azure sky.
He did it for his friends. Hermione and Ron, always there no matter what. Luna, kidnapped and left to languish in the dark cellars beneath Malfoy Manor. Neville, shouting he'd never, never give up. Ginny, bright and beautiful, always battling on.
“And he and Draco used the time-turner?” Harry says quietly, and Narcissa glances sharply at him, her gaze refocussing.
But only Draco’s followed him around in a real form. The Shadow stalked not only his mind, but his body. It became solid, real, in the forms of those who had lost too much and needed to blame someone. The first years and second years, who had not been there, who had not suffered, but had heard stories. They followed him around, his personal shadows, whispering and pointing.
"You have to deliver the eulogy," Malfoy says. Astoria looks at him, a strange mix of desperation and disbelief on her face.
"Well, you probably noticed it subconsciously and your dream planted the information there for you."
"I know, but it's just...I don't know." Harry feels terrible. "I don't know," he repeats. "Anyone in their right mind would have told Narcissa and Astoria, and taken Draco to St Mungo's, and — "
Hermione tells Harry she's finalised the details of an extraction. That's what it's called, she explains. Rescuing someone from the past. An extraction. The process sounds complicated and involves some very difficult magic, but she's written it all up neatly, like a recipe, and says that at any moment, a team of Unspeakables can carry it out.
“I’ll answer it, this is my house,” Astoria protests, but Matthew shakes his head and Astoria falls back, allowing Harry to disappear down the hallway.
He traces a hand over the kitchen counter. It's immaculately clean, as ever. There's a fruitbowl on one end of the counter, although it doesn't contain any fruit. Just some receipts and a handful of knuts and sickles.
Harry checks his watch. The game would have already started, he thinks, and Ginny knows, anyway, that his work always comes first, same as her Quidditch does for her.
"I haven't got a problem," Harry says, "but Holdsworth might. Confidentiality and all that. Long as you don't tell anyone you saw the memory, I'll be fine."
"It gets worse," Hermione says ominously. "I caught her making a list of possible grandchild names."
And they found a deserted playground, a set of swings. And they threw themselves into the sky, wanting to be swallowed up by the whole glorious night, to remain in the moment forever, preserved in stars and joy. And Draco swung high into the sky and let go, and for one stupid moment Harry thought he was actually flying.
It's a very long week waiting for the test results. When Harry's not working his other cases, he's in the Muggle Liaisons office, badgering people about making arrangements. When he finally receives news, on Thursday, that a DNA sample has been successfully retrieved, he begins badgering Butterworth instead.
