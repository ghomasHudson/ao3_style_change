Long minutes passed. He could hear Lee’s gentle sobs and sniffs as her breathing settled. Finally, Draco opened his eyes.
Irritated, the agent sucks his teeth, and Draco sighs. “Oh, go on then, I’ll see it. Quickly, though.” All at once, he turns back to Harry, abandoning all pretence of unfamiliarity. “You, wait.
Draco took pity on him. “Lee, isn’t that Pepper-Up on the brew? Best keep an eye, hmm?” She reluctantly retreated to the lab, grumbling under her breath.
“Calm the fuck down, Potter,” said Malfoy, spinning round with a smirk and an exaggerated wink. Behind his back his companion was glaring daggers at Harry. “Never heard of hyperbole,
encouraged him to relentlessly pursue his desires, but it often favoured short-term gratification, its methods were not subtle, and it definitely lacked a conscience. And the real Draco unquestionably had one of those: it was what had made him such a useless Death Eater, after all.
Who would want to act as an assistant to a twenty-one-year-old ex-Death Eater? Draco dreaded to think. Even
“I know he won’t. It’s just – he’s been through so much rubbish, and this was supposed to make him feel
“I just don’t fancy standing around lying to my friends and assorted Weasleys all evening when I’ve got things I could be getting on with.”
“Here they come,” murmured Draco, tone almost awed. Harry shook his head, completely baffled. But sure enough, a few seconds later a motorbike shot past, and by the time they’d reached the edge of the hill, the evening air was alive with the hum of engines, backfiring exhausts, and loud, excited voices.
that he understood. “This isn’t about wanting a better view. Up here, we’re part of the game. It’s exhilarating. It’s almost as though we’re―”
And suddenly Draco found he was itching to go inside and get started – to work out if this idea had any real merit. He needed to check his inventory, make lists of suppliers to contact and look in the
Lightning scores across the sky as he spits that last word; night becoming day for a bare moment. And you’re almost back there too, so many hexes flashing before your eyes: red, white and green, green, green; mouth gritty with dust and scorched earth; the low rumble of falling walls ringing in your ears.
“And when I came round in the afternoon. That’s why you were so cranky. I figured it was the pain, but – I’m right, aren’t I? That afternoon?”
“Glad to see you’re alive, Malfoy!” Potter replied sarcastically, shouting over the wind which was whipping around the narrow streets. Draco noticed some movement opposite, and glanced up to see old Mrs Gibson, frowning down at Potter through her net curtains.
Harry sat up, expression shifting from hurt to concerned. Draco’s words tripped over one another through chattering teeth as he rushed to explain. “Look, I’m exhausted, and a bit terrified, and… and happy, Harry, I’m
“Right, that’s settled then. No more moping, no more pining.” She raised her tumbler. “To Draco, and his successful pursuit of the Boy-Who-Sucks-Cock!”
But Harry – hands on the balcony railing, getting wetter by the second – has long since stopped listening. It’s noisy out here,
Neville looked uncomfortable. “I can’t really – well, I suppose it’s not going to be a secret for much – no, I shouldn’t really…”
“All right.” Harry took a flannel from the sink and ran it under the tap. Draco opened his mouth to protest but recognised the futility of even attempting and closed it again after a few seconds. He caught sight of Harry watching him as he wrung the excess liquid out.
“I want that too,” he mumbled, softly, speaking to the bathwater. “I do. I want that too, Draco. It’s only that―”
thing – although Draco knew from the ache in his chest that he did miss her, and although he could list the things he liked about her – her sense of humour, the way she got along with all the customers, her strange Muggle habits – the bizarre thing was, whenever he tried to picture her face, he just couldn’t bring it to mind. Likewise, when he tried to recall conversations they’d had, he found that there were specifics he couldn’t quite place. Everything was fragmented, piecemeal, with no clear timeline.
Harry, meanwhile, was groaning in ecstasy with every careful movement of Malfoy’s wand, as Malfoy’s clever magic fizzed over him, leaving the muscles beneath tingling and so, so relaxed. The tension from a full day’s flying seemed to bleed away as Malfoy traced patterns across Harry’s chest, drawing the wood in precise lines down his stomach and then pressing deeply into the tight mass of his quads, leaving Harry boneless and writhing uncontrollably under his touch.
Draco leant forward and moved away from the pillar. A smile stole across his face as he stood at full height, facing Potter.
“Honestly, Draco, I’m beginning to think my life was easier when you were just spending your time trying to trip me up or hex me. It’s been one thing after another since we’ve actually been friends.”
Everybody whispering, tense and anxious; his mother weeping, quietly, at night. Nothing going according to plan – and the realisation that maybe he wasn’t
, almost, the look was that intense. Potter was so distracted, in fact, that as he leant over to pour them both a top-up, red wine splashed out of his glass, seeping into the tablecloth below. Draco, transfixed by Potter’s heated gaze, hardly noticed; those gorgeous eyes always
They take their glasses and the rest of the bottle out onto the balcony, squish their legs between the cast iron railings and drink. The laughter of passers-by and the hiss of buses braking drifts up to fill the comfortable silence, as they take turns pointing out the tiny shapes of people walking up and down Parliament Hill. Eventually the sky begins to darken, and the smell from the chippie becomes too tempting to resist, so Harry wanders down there, grinning up at Draco as he emerges with piled Styrofoam boxes of cod and chips. He looks at the front door –
Things had been at their best here, that much was for sure. No matter what else they’d disagreed on, the sex was incredible; had been from that first heated embrace. No-one since had ever compared, at least for Harry. But it was more than that. If Harry was honest, he still missed the nights; the way Draco would purposefully wind himself around him, fitting their bodies together so soft and easy. Harry had slept alone since childhood, and he’d always been restless. No matter whether in a cupboard, a dorm, or a tent, he’d always woken sweaty and nauseous from nightmare after nightmare. The gentle pressure of Draco’s head against his chest and the way he tucked his feet beneath Harry’s ankles had changed all that; had made things
Harry ushered him over towards the wall, leaning in close, his voice low and gentle. “Look, Draco, it’s okay. No one’s forcing you to do this. Let’s just get out of here, alright?”
! “Oh Merlin, don’t stop. Oh god, that’s bloody incredible.” He tilted his neck from side to side, then clenched his knees to hold the broom while he rotated his clicking shoulders. “Ohhhhhh…”
“It’s alright,” says Draco, awkwardly. “It was a long time ago. We were kids. Lord knows I’ve made my fair share of mistakes too.”
barely registers as you leave her sitting at the table. You can barely keep to a walk, and you slam the library doors behind you, locking spells tripping off your tongue in haste as your other hand fumbles with the latch on the cupboard for what will definitely be the
“Oh, absolutely. I mean, they knew about the Noseless Wonder, obviously, and they’d all heard of the Boy Who Just Wouldn’t Quit, but – well, the whole war thing just wasn’t a big deal there, y’know? I think there was some major Quodpot tournament going on in ‘98 or something. So for most people the details were pretty… hazy. Lucky for me, huh?”
He indicated the chair, not five yards in front of them: when he looked at it, he could still feel the icy bite of the chains digging into the welts on his arms; could hear the vicious whispering from the highest benches; could see the flash of the cameras, leaving him half-blind and vulnerable, blinking away tears.
Draco nodded slowly. “I wasn’t on it then. Not that afternoon. Not when we almost…” He watched, satisfied, as Harry’s eyes widened in realisation. After a few seconds, Harry took a deep, shaky breath, collecting himself.
, he’d avoided her gaze, terrified that she would be able to read it all over his face – the lies, his shame. He’d held his breath as he’d stepped out of the Floo, taking in – for the first time – the slightly faded wallpaper, and the way the gilding flaked off the edge of the cornices. But before he could open his mouth, his mother had taken him straight into her arms, long fingers combing through the stubble of his hair, murmuring
to, I couldn’t help it. I’ve been sick the last few days; guilty and ashamed to think of all the things you told me over the years. The way you trusted me, the way I let you believe you’d finally found someone who understood you. That’s what you deserve, Harry. Him. The man you thought I was. Merlin, I can’t fucking
It was obviously the horse. There was nothing there except the horse. But Harry knew better than to disagree with Draco when he was in one of his introspective moods, so he stayed quiet. Waiting.
Malfoy’s sharp gaze was boring into Harry, the heat searing against his icy, wind-burned cheek. Harry flicked his eyes away, facing down the line of his broom as he replied. “Malfoy, are you flirting with me?”
“I don’t normally do things that way, not if I can help it. Draws far too much attention. Although, of course, my wandless magic has improved loads, all the time I was spending around you…”
With profits increasing, Draco quickly gave Lee a pay rise. She was saving for her own flat – somewhere in Muggle London near her relatives, but where she could get a Floo connection installed. She was looking forward to a lie-in, and Draco was looking forward to not having to hear her rants about the ‘stinking bloody Tube’ every single morning.
The breakthrough, when it did arrive, was from a wholly unexpected source. It was late one Friday afternoon, the weak October sun already hidden behind the buildings opposite, when she arrived. Draco was out back, busy putting the finishing touches to a batch of Strengthening Solution, breathing a sigh of relief that the end of another long week was in sight. He heard the door to the shop open and shut, the sharp clacking of stiletto heels on wood, but he paid it no mind, until―
“The lab’s a complete tip, but judging by the ingredients I’d say we’re looking at Euphoria, Daydream Solution, a modified Amortentia, and something else. Strengthening Solution, perhaps.”
Harry’s face turns serious, and his muscles tense, and Draco realises his mistake even before his mouth opens. “Oh, believe me, I’m tired, Draco. I’m really tired. In fact….” He pauses, taking a deep breath. Draco squeezes his eyes shut, pressing a single finger against those treacherous lips.
Snitch – appeared once more, directly in front of his face. He waved his hand through it once, twice, his digits melting straight through the golden ball without resistance.
“You can’t, not really,” she said, plainly. “Only time will tell. I do trust Harry’s judgement though, and he seems pretty sure about you. And I suppose taking on Leonie must be a step in the right direction.” She smiled at him, gesturing towards the door. “Now, I have to get back to the Ministry, but Harry said that you could do with a hand to set up Leonie’s pay? We can drop into Gringotts together, if you like.”
. Potter backing him up against the wall, hands on either side of his head. Potter bent forward over a workbench, turned back towards him with a smirk. Potter on his knees, looking up through heavy eyelids. Potter with Draco’s hand wrapped around his cock, head thrown back, the cords of his neck exposed.
They both watched, silently, as Hannah dashed back over the lawn, wobbling on tiptoes to avoid her heels getting stuck.
looked at him; let his gaze travel down – over those heavy-lidded eyes, the elegant cheekbones, the lips pressed tightly together, the guarded tilt of Malfoy’s chin. His expression was one of carefully fashioned indifference, and it made Harry’s heart leap into his throat.
anything. Even exhausted, even stupid with drink, he couldn’t ignore the fact that getting involved with Potter would be a monumentally idiotic decision. Potter was naïve if he didn’t understand that.
“Course, most people – Muggles, I mean – they want to see all your papers and such, before they take you on…” Bryn continued, oblivious. Harry was right behind Bryn now, opening his mouth to speak, but Draco shook his head urgently, nodding towards Professor Sprout. To Draco’s amusement, Harry did a mildly horrified double take at the sight of her. He threw one last hesitant look at Draco, before stepping away and vanishing into the crowd.
“You know, to get back to it.” Harry waved his hands, expansively. “Real life, I mean. The shop. Everything. I know that Hannah said your thoughts were still jumbled at times. That your mood could be – well―”
“Oh, I could do Sprout, McGonagall, Trelawney – the lot of them. I reckon you’d particularly appreciate my Snape.” He cleared his throat, looked down his nose and drawled. “What now? Blown up the cauldron
“Now, given the extended nature of this match, there are a couple of rule changes,” said Kingsley, raising a finger. “First, you’ll be allowed a comfort break every six hours. Second, if a player touches the ground at any other time – deliberately or otherwise – their team will be immediately disqualified. And Seekers?” Harry looked up. Two rows in front, so did Malfoy. “You’ll be re-releasing the Snitch after each catch, and there’s a ten-minute lockout between catches.”
Once his Saturdays were no longer spent lazing around in a fog of self-loathing, Draco was able to start working on more experimental potions; ideas which he’d been absent-mindedly considering for years. He raced about his lab, adding ingredients and stirring cauldrons, Quick Quotes Quill scratching away in his notebooks as he worked. For a short while he felt productive and positive. But slowly, slowly, things started to come apart.
you, somehow. Help you, even. And… and other things. I really don’t want to go into it right now, but I’ll just say that I thought about you more than I probably should have.” Harry shrugged, looking uncomfortable. “When Neville visited you at the Manor, he told me how you were getting on, and then when I saw an opportunity to help you out, I took it. And I enjoyed coming into your shop, seeing you again. Doing so well. I’m not going to lie and say it was completely altruistic. I’m only human, and yes, I wanted something from you, too. I didn’t know quite what that was, but I couldn’t help it.”
And what a picture Harry made, Draco thought, greedily taking in the way he looked kneeling half over the shimmering puddle of Draco’s best dress robes: eyes sparkling with laughter, come shining across his pecs, hair completely dishevelled and lips bitten scarlet.
“If you can, please let Potter know he has my sympathy. It was always a big fear of mine, being outed publicly. Of course, a major reason for that was what my father would say, so I suppose at least that’s not an issue anymore…”
Harry smiles. “Doubt it. I don’t remember, actually. Why, do you want your half? I would have – I kind of figured, when you –”
“Trust me, you can’t miss Lee.” Draco replied, drinking his lemonade and peering through the dense crowds. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted Hermione, and opposite her – was that Harry? He willed the people in the way to move, as he leaned closer to get a better look…
His voice was trembling, almost accusatory. “You really think I only like you because you looked after me?”
As the cheers faded, Harry opened his fist. The Snitch gave itself a little shake, its tiny wings uncrumpling, before it whizzed off into the air. As he watched it disappear across the pitch, Harry spotted Malfoy – to Harry’s surprise, still in the exact same spot as earlier. He caught Harry’s eye, shooting him a playful smile and a quick thumbs up.
would, of course, delight in exposing him as a cheat, a liar, a fraud. And then, he realised with alarm, there was his mother. Such public shame would no doubt ruin her prospects; in fact, the shock might prove too much for her altogether.
Draco looked up, appealing desperately to the Aurors behind Crowson. Three of them stared straight ahead, avoiding his gaze. The fourth one though – a middle-aged, balding man – was glaring directly at the back of Crowson’s head, fists clenched. Something about his expression was familiar, but Draco couldn’t place it, and he leant forward, trying to to get a closer look, before –
“Oh, don’t worry about that,” she interrupted, picking up the second, half-empty bottle of wine, and slipping her shoes back on, her lips tightly pressed together. “I have no intention of staying a moment longer in your… home.”
“Under Veritaserum.” He produced a tiny vial, which grew in his palm the same way the pasta had. The mere sight of it made Draco’s heart jump into his mouth. He sat forwards, glancing desperately at the door, sweaty hands curling involuntarily into fists.
So Draco spent the days pottering around his flat, listening to the wireless, reading what he could until his head started to ache, and practicing his speech. Hannah and Neville had left him some food and supplies in the cupboard, and Draco made a valiant attempt each day to concoct something edible from whatever he could find. And Merlin, who knew making a decent cup of tea took so much
“So long as at least one of them is –” But the rest of Draco’s words were lost as Harry moved into him once more, capturing his mouth in another deep kiss. Draco stumbled back, bracing himself against the carved wooden banister post, Harry’s body pressed up against him, his lips hungry, relentless. As Draco moved to kiss down Harry’s jaw, the ornamental braids of the aiguillette caught on the clasp of Draco’s own robe. Draco paused, momentarily disorientated, a sudden flashback distorting his surroundings. He blinked, willing it away, and Harry looked at him curiously, keeping a firm grip on Draco’s arm. When Draco had composed himself, he nodded minutely, and Harry kissed him on the cheek before leaning back and making a complicated flicking gesture at the front of his robes. The clasp flipped open, the robes flying off to the side, as he repeated the gesture and sent Draco’s sailing after it. The thrill of Harry’s careful magic running over him again made Draco gasp and shiver a little, as their robes settled neatly over the stair rail.
“’Course,” said Draco, “it wasn’t great the time he caught me. Shouted at me in front of the whole House, wrote to my father, and gave me a week’s worth of detention to boot. It was so terrifying that – did you notice? – two years after the man’s death, I’m still checking that he’s not behind me before I do an impression of him.”
Harry’s voice was dangerously quiet. Draco was suddenly reminded of the day he’d discovered the Occamy eggs, all those years ago, when the attic wall had collapsed from underneath him and he’d tumbled forwards into darkness. He found himself at a loss, completely unable to synchronise brain with voice.
had forced Draco to dramatically cut his mother’s salary. He’d half expected an argument, or tears, but to his great relief she’d accepted his explanation without comment, and things had been remarkably comfortable between them – until today.
Confirmation of his O grade had arrived back in the summer, affording him a few rare days of excitement and optimism. He’d received Owls from his friends – the last he’d heard from any of them, in fact – with news of their marks and confirmation of their plans for the future. Draco was, of course, well aware that with a year left of his house arrest, he wouldn’t be starting the potions apprenticeship he’d always dreamed of. But something about their success buoyed him enough to send off a few speculative Owls to well-respected potioneers around the country, mentioning his grades, the extra-credit work he’d undertaken and that he would be looking for a position from July 2000.
it.” She slammed her hands down, but Draco could hear desperation, not anger, behind her words. “That’s exactly what they did to my mother before she died. They made her… they made her… your arsehole
“What’s going on?” he asked, voice scratchy with sleep. He opened his eyes one at a time, squinting up at Draco. “You’re dressed.”
Draco nodded. Pansy hummed and leant forwards, bringing her fingers together in front of her. She glanced quickly between him and Lee, and something familiar stirred in the back of Draco’s mind. He knew that look. That was a Slytherin brain, hard at work.
, though?” he howled, even louder this time. Harry winced. Across the room, a baby started wailing, his mother looking over at Draco with a face like thunder. He appeared not to notice. “Selling
. He brushed his tongue over the slit, dipping inside just barely, and then down to ring the sensitive skin underneath the crown. Encouraged by Harry’s gasps, he ran his mouth back up Harry’s cock to gently lap up the fresh bead of moisture which had gathered, glistening, at the tip.
Soon, Draco realised, Harry must have been ready, because he lifted himself up, opening his legs a little wider and wrapping a sure hand around Draco’s aching cock. He sank down onto it then, impossibly tight heat moving steadily – and God, so
A response was probably warranted here, thought Draco, blinking stupidly. He felt faint with the implications of Harry’s words. All those visits, all those conversations, over all those years?
“Wha―” Harry spun round just in time to see the charm make contact with Ron, reaching him bare milliseconds before his sleeping form slipped completely off the side of the broom. He woke with a gasp, hands reflexively clasping the handle for dear life.
, that he barely had time to eat or sleep – much less make idle conversation – as he drifted around his shop, watching things unfold as though from afar. How strange it was to have been given this gift to see
Draco’s breathing quickened as he found himself sitting on the floor of the Ministry holding cells, leaning against an invisible wall, his mother weeping quietly beside him. Anti-magic barriers shimmered all around them, and a cold voice spoke from outside the cell.
“I’ve never had to work at it, either, like you hear some people do. Just… from the very first time, I could see what Moody wanted me to do, but I never felt
It was a Bludger that woke him in the end, a strange whooping noise ending with a gentle knock against Harry’s shoulder. He cracked open one eye to see Malfoy’s waning
And they’d spent plenty of long lazy weekends in this room too, with the balcony door part-open and a gentle breeze blowing through the flat. Harry would listen to the wireless, cheering for the players in his fantasy Quidditch league, while Draco hummed, and frowned, and sucked his quill, scanning through textbook after textbook. Some afternoons he’d rest his head in Harry’s lap for a quick nap. Others he’d rest his head in Harry’s lap for another reason altogether.
Neville shrugged. “Don’t ask me, mate. I’m no expert. I reckon the two of you are as bad as each other. I just don’t want to see him hurt again. Or you, of course.”
Draco stepped out onto the street and watched Potter stroll away, hands in his pockets. His feet were growing cold from the cobblestones, and he was distantly worried that Mrs Gibson might have been watching the whole thing from her flat, but he felt frozen to the spot, unable to do anything except stare in the direction of Potter’s retreating form. His entire body was aflame, despite the summer storm soaking him to the skin. Potter had smiled
“Mmm?” Harry slowed only slightly, continuing the maddening slide of his lips over Draco’s cock. Draco bit his lip, hard.
Unbidden, his treacherous brain brought forth a memory he’d long managed to suppress. He tried to push it away, but he didn’t have the willpower.
As that last, agonising not-quite-smile replays in his mind, Harry’s chest constricts, and he finds he can’t get out of the flat quickly enough. His little spontaneous journey into the past hasn’t painted him in a flattering light; in fact, it’s only revealed what he’s long refused to accept: teenage Harry had been selfish, greedy and quite unkind. He makes for the door, reaches for the handle with a grimace, the agent still asking questions somewhere off in the distance. But Harry’s already out in the dark corridor, taking the stairs two at a time, not looking back.
He stepped out of the Floo into his bedroom gracefully, every nerve in his body alight, high on excitement and total disbelief. Was it possible that this was finally happening? What an idiot he’d been, wasting so much time fighting against the
“When he told me that we were both as bad as each…” Draco stopped, abruptly, horribly embarrassed. “You know what, never mind.” He felt Harry’s toes curling against his under the table and looked down, uselessly, his face now almost certainly bright scarlet.
writes about it – I mean, wasn’t there literally an article about him having a cold last week? The girl must have known it was a risk. It was only a first date, they’ll write about it and they’ll move on – probably to his latest hair disaster, or something like that. What’s the problem?”
? “I mean, why did you come back here? You always make it sound like you were having so much fun in New York.”
, he reminded himself, clamping his trembling hand around the wand in his pocket, running his fingers over the ridges and trying to focus, the way his Mind Healer had taught him.
“Don’t you tease me, Draco Malfoy.” He flinched neatly away from her attempt to jab him with her elbow. She lost her balance completely, skidding on the stones and very nearly pulling the both of them to the ground. They wobbled sideways, forcing the shopkeeper outside Eeylops to jump backwards, the pile of cages he’d been levitating falling to the floor with a loud crash. When they’d finally righted themselves, both apologising breathlessly to the tutting proprietor, Lee looked over at Draco.
– so when he bought the place, he just went ahead and ripped the lot out. Lovely job he’s done too, as you can see – granite worktops, double oven…”
sometimes let his eyes linger over Potter’s gorgeous arse a little longer than was polite – well, what harm was there in looking? Potter never seemed to notice, although Draco found the
to see. Nowadays, they could go entire weeks without speaking. The shadowy figure Draco hardly saw, who slipped in and out of rooms with eyes downcast, who hardly seemed to know where she was most of the time – well, he could probably have moved his entire laboratory to her chambers without being noticed.
Worse was to come – poor Vince, hapless to the last; Voldemort defeated, and his father, half-crazed, muttering under his breath:
“Mmm. So anyway,” Harry says, biting his lip, “I reckon that it makes most sense if I’m the one who arrives first…”
. Scary, really.” As they watched, the blond bent forwards to speak to the barman, tight trousers clinging to the curve of his bum. His companion didn’t bother to hide his ogling, eyes roving blatantly over the blond’s lithe frame as he ran an idle hand through his mop of black hair.
mean? – and the silence stretched out to fill his flat. Draco could hear his heartbeat in his ears, the mechanical thrill of augmented blood rushing to aid his malfunctioning brain. Time bent and warped again before his eyes; seconds becoming hours as a hundred different scenarios ran simultaneously through his mind.
“Agreed,” said Harry, sipping his lukewarm squash. It was far too strong and near-impossible to force down. He aimed an
Draco merely snorted loudly and continued walking. “Put it away, Potter. Honestly, anyone would think you hadn’t been raised by Muggles.”
“I know what everyone thinks of me, Potter. That’s why I don’t usually go out,” Draco said quietly, shaking his left arm, which was now tingling as though trapped in a vice.
Harry made a small, pained noise. “Oh, God. Forget what I said the other night, I wasn’t…” He broke off, sighing. “Look, Draco, I spoke to Neville, I feel awful…”
, but there was no venom behind it; it was more like slipping on an old, comfortable pair of shoes. Potter seemed to feel the same, his face opening up into a wide smile where he stood, his warm palm still pressed against Draco’s.
“Anyway, this term I’ve started teaching the first years. Merlin, some of them are obnoxious. I feel sorry for everyone who ever tried to teach us.”
was screaming at him to say yes, the noise drowning out all rational thought. Draco took a deep breath, willing his treacherous mind to behave, and only when he’d convinced his brain that the best course of action really
“Hmm. D’you know,” said Neville, through a mouthful of salmon sandwich, “it almost sounded like you were complimenting me then.”
“It’s all right for you, mate! You’re – well―” Seamus tailed off, waggling his eyebrows in an exaggerated manner.
There were tears prickling behind Draco’s eyes. Tears of anger, of humiliation. They’d come for him that morning, the whole group of Aurors, Crowson at their head. The door had flown open at the same time the restraints binding his hands had activated and begun dragging him inexorably towards them, his feet scrabbling to keep up. He’d pleaded for them to take his mother first, tried to explain that she might not survive another night without sleep, but no one had said a word. His desperate cries had echoed down the Ministry halls. And Harry had been there for that?
in seemed to mock him from above the sink – a metre away, perhaps, but an impossible distance. He held out his hand, and tried to concentrate on the
But this was a critical time; the shop was opening tomorrow. It was so important that these first couple of weeks went well; that he established himself as a reputable businessman, someone who’d turned his life around. He needed the press to be positive, and the only possible way to ensure that was to take the
Although, Draco thought, perhaps some background music wouldn’t go amiss. No sooner had it crossed his mind than he heard a faint

“Oh yeah,” Malfoy continued, brightly, “trust me, I’m well acquainted with the tattoo. It was stalking around your navel all year―” he indicated the air in front of him “―just… right above my desk.”
.” He gestures at Draco with his free hand, suddenly self-conscious. “Sorry. I don’t know why I said that.”
“Oh, goodness, no. I’m staying at the Sheraton. I was just looking for flats in the local paper when I spotted this one, and –” he shrugs, “well. I suppose I’m here for the same reason you are.”
Harry nodded, thinking of Malfoy at work – always nipping in and out of Harry’s office, spinning around on Lofts’ chair, rifling through paperwork with no regard for closed drawers – or locks, for that matter. He pictured the way Malfoy would hop onto a table in the canteen to act out some dramatic chase, or stride through the Atrium, gesturing emphatically as he talked.
. And there is no way it could dissolve your leg, I promise. If it works, you can have it free for life.”
“Don’t thank me yet.” Harry leant forwards, his muscles visible under the tight shirt. He looked every inch the powerful Auror, and even beneath layers of confusion and fear, Draco swallowed tightly, shifting in his seat as he remembered the heat of that hard body pressed against his. “I’m not messing around, Draco. If I don’t like what I hear, you’ll be taking the Veritaserum, at the Ministry if necessary.”
“Do you…?” Harry spun around, indignant. “You’re the one who numbed my muscles with your cowboy superpowers and then practically massaged me into a coma. We’ve been flying for nearly nineteen hours now – I’d like to see
“Oh, it’s not that bad,” says Draco carelessly, his first language suddenly a stranger to his own ears. “Besides, I can usually find some nubile young shepherd boy to share body heat with.”
Draco sipped his water, listening to Harry’s footsteps as they receded into the distance. His remaining anxiety was fading fast, and he smiled faintly to himself – distraction
“Call me Pomona, please. I understand that Charity’s daughter – that little firecracker – she’s working with you now?” Draco nodded. “Merlin, she was wonderful today. Known her since she was a wee thing. Her parents used to bring her round for dinner sometimes. I always knew she was a special one.”
As the evening continued, Draco found he was rejecting the amorous advances of witches and wizards at an alarming rate. He felt absolutely invincible, like he could do anything, have anyone he wanted. But he didn’t want anyone else – there was only one man in the room that he desired right now. His whole body physically ached to stride over to Potter, grab him, and pin him up against something. But
to get through to anyone on the Floo, and then she basically told me that they didn’t deal with Squibs, they didn’t have any records of me anyway, didn’t I know there was a war on, and I’d be best to contact any Muggle relatives I had.”
Draco turns his head, eyes half-closed, captures Harry’s mouth with his own. Harry tastes the salt tang of tears on Draco’s lips as he returns the kiss. It’s deep, aching; Harry still trying to pour every last inch of himself into the heated touch of their tongues. Draco, too, is all over him; hands tangled in Harry’s hair, face buried in his neck, hips tightly pressed together.
the best he could remember – and he’d been seconds away from falling asleep in his lover’s arms. And not just any lover: Harry, who he’d spent years wanting,
“Obviously,” repeated Harry, less than convinced. It wasn’t just that part either: Malfoy’s whole answer had seemed a little… off, somehow. Almost as though he was trotting out a jokey, sanitised version of events to avoid giving an honest answer. But before Harry could probe any further, they were both distracted by the sudden appearance of the Snitch, which was hovering mere feet away from them. Its golden body jiggled about impatiently, as if to remind them they were supposed to be competing, and Malfoy waved his hand in its direction.
Somewhere nearby, a door banged open. Heavy footsteps approached and Draco groaned, pressing his face against his knees, wishing he’d had the foresight to think of casting a Disillusionment.
“Don’t thank me. Show me that you were worth the effort.” Harry’s mouth curled up in an exhausted attempt at a smile. He was
“Well,” said Draco thoughtfully, “you said you’d wanted to wait a year.” He sucked his bottom lip in between his teeth, tasting salt in place of Harry’s fingers, watching Harry’s eyes darken as they tracked the movement.
Before Pansy could even open her mouth, Draco had grabbed hold of Harry’s arm urgently, hauling open the nearest door – to a broom cupboard, by the looks of things – and tugging him through it. The door slammed behind them, and Pansy glanced back at Ginny. Her face was blotchy, wisps of hair falling loose from the clasp. Pansy reached over and deftly fixed it, as Ginny smiled.
“I talked to Kingsley, before you went in front of the Wizengamot. I couldn’t stop you from being put under house arrest – and besides, I thought it might not be the worst thing – you weren’t there for those early days, there were people literally baying for your blood.”
The only sound in the room was the gentle clink of cutlery. Slowly, he uncovered his eyes, wincing in the low winter sun. Neville and Hannah’s faces were arranged into an unsettling jumble of pity and concern. Draco aimed for levity, affecting a shaky smile.
Hermione shook the memory lightly from her head. “This isn’t… I’ve never seen anything quite like it. He’s not
what the last few weeks have been like for me? I turn up for work one Monday morning, and Harry’s here, and suddenly I’m hearing all this shit, how you’ve been on… on
But no sooner had he flopped back down on his bed and closed his eyes than his peace was shattered by yet another racket from outside the window.
“Did you? Merlin, Harry, how on earth did he keep it up?” came yet another familiar voice. This one sounded like long summer days in the Manor gardens. Summer days, and a gentle breeze, and the sweet smell of Moly flowers. He smiled at the thought, turning his face to try and catch some sun. The sound of his mother’s singing was drifting through his mind; the refrain of an old lullaby, maybe, over and over…
“It’s… it’s, er, Daphne Greengrass. I guess you remember her? I… well, it’s not been long, but I really like her. Always have.” He fiddled with the edge of the duvet nervously. “Honestly, I have no idea what came over me, but, er, it’d be great if you didn’t say anything to anyone.”
Draco felt the start of a blush creeping up his neck and attempted to hide it behind his mug. “I’m beginning to see what Neville meant, to be honest,” he muttered.
“Fine!” Draco slammed the window shut with his good arm. The sound reverberated around the flat, and he saw Mrs Gibson glare at him before he turned away.
and let Theo push him down against his pillows. Draco rolled his hips as Theo straddled him and began biting his way up Draco’s neck. He licked the shell of Draco’s ear, letting out a soft moan.
Draco hasn’t turned back around, but Harry feels his body stiffen; notices the way his voice has turned quiet and strained. “Ah, no. I wasn’t going to.” Harry huffs in disappointment, and Draco throws his hands up. “It’s just that I’ve got so much on, and –”
wandless; my healing spells are shit at the best of times, and by the time I got to St Mungo’s, all they could do was patch me up. Told me it’s going to take two weeks to heal properly, and I’m off field work until it’s sorted. It’s all right, that’ll give them time to find me a new bloody partner, at least that’s what I said to Robards…” His frown deepened as he caught sight of Draco’s face. “What?”
Draco snorted. “Where do I start? You might not have noticed, Neville, but I have a slight Death Eater problem. Even leaving that aside, I’ll only just have finished my Diploma, and no one’s going to take me seriously without a UK apprenticeship. I don’t have any ingredients…” Okay, that one wasn’t entirely true, but Draco definitely wasn’t planning to mention his storeroom “…I’d need established relationships with suppliers…”
“Don’t worry, I’m the pretty one anyway,” she muttered, patting his back consolingly as they cleaned up the mess.
, Draco, all the other eighth years were invited. Pansy and Theo will be there, it’ll be just like old times!”
Draco had been, the owner of Twilfitt and Tattings had trilled, practically vibrating with excitement. Last-minute cancellations were simply
He thought of Neville and Hannah, of Dean Thomas, of Ron, and all his old Slytherin friends. What would each of them say, when they found out about him? Would they be surprised? Would they miss his company? Or would they just shake their heads, saying
“Like this. God, Draco, just like this.” Harry reeled off the now-familiar spells in a single breath, before shifting forwards over Draco, knees either side of his waist. “Can you…?”
“You should leave.” Smoke curls past Draco’s lips, his bloodshot eyes flickering warily over Potter. “This place, it’s not for –”
Lee rolled her eyes, but grabbed his arm as he rounded the counter, pulling him into a short, furious hug. He buried his head in her curls and sighed. How was he ever supposed to make things right?
Thus began the peculiar and tentative friendship between Draco and Potter, if you could call it a friendship – Draco wasn’t exactly sure
“Draco, I hope you’re not upset because I got angry at you yesterday. It’s not just about the business. It’s – look,” she called, her voice rising in both pitch and volume. “It’s because I
Draco snorts. “Hardly. I’m married to the job, I guess. At least that’s what I tell people. Can’t manage to make anything last. I couldn’t find – no-one ever seemed quite the right –”
“Right, of course,” Potter continued, with a nervous laugh. “So when I started, just after the war trials, one of my first tasks was to help reform the way we question suspects – to make it fairer, and more humane. Muggles have this principle, you know, innocent until proven guilty? Anyway, as you might remember, Max enjoyed getting a little… heavy handed, shall we say, with his interrogation.”
Increasingly, too, letters would arrive from customers or suppliers that didn’t sit quite right with Draco – things which made him wonder if he was being paranoid, or if
… But now definitely wasn’t the time. Besides, Harry’s face had turned suddenly serious again, that playful smile disappearing as quickly as it had arrived.
to me. I don’t know what else you wanted. A marriage proposal? A hand job right there in the stands? Or maybe he could make you a badge, like those ones you made for him in fourth year?”
had printed Harry’s own statement, which Draco realised, to his dismay, was far too sensible and measured to counter the hideously prejudiced hyperbole surrounding it. He sighed. For the first time in his life, he actually felt sympathy for Potter. He’d always assumed that – despite his numerous and oh-so-virtuous protestations – Potter secretly enjoyed his celebrity reputation. The coverage of him had always been so overwhelmingly positive that Draco could only look on with jealousy as article after article continued to refer to
, doesn’t there? The fridge is almost empty; he frowns, vaguely considering two different types of blue cheese, parma ham, and an avocado, before shutting the door again. Bloody Draco and his bloody Waitrose addiction. Where’s the comfort food?
“Mmm. Hey, Draco,” Harry said softly, “tell me something. Do you remember the day I came round and you took me into your lab, right after that curse had taken a bloody great chunk out of my thigh?”
She was right – over the next few days, Draco’s lucid intervals lengthened. He was able to keep food down, to stand up without feeling dizzy, and even to sit out in his armchair for short periods. Hannah stayed with him, always there, making food and walking beside him to the toilet.
A shadow fell on Draco, but still, he couldn’t look up. He relaxed his fingers, unwinding the feather, attempting to keep his voice steady. “I really care about you, and I’m only sorry it took me so long to realise that. To understand. So I wonder…” Draco finally looked up at Harry, warmth pooling in his gut as their eyes met “…could we go back to being friends? I’d like that. Turns out I… I’ve really missed you.”
“I… I don’t know, exactly,” Draco admitted. “There are some gaps. Details, mostly. My Mind Healer… she helps me… it’s hard to recall specifics…”
. And certainly don’t worry about what I think.” He tugged affectionately at the strands. “I’ll still feel exactly the same whether your hair’s short, or long, or―” he grinned “―if you go bald…”
“No, idiot, at the bachelor auctions. Those―” he cleared his throat, “―posh rich boys. None of them do it for you?”
sparkle behind his eyelids, riding a wave of pleasure. Saliva ran out of the sides of his mouth and his jaw ached sweetly as Harry continued to fuck his face. He could feel his own cock leaking through his underwear, and he slid his fingers under his waistband, finally taking himself in hand.
“Hi, Draco. I’m glad you’re awake. How do you feel?” Hannah’s smile was gentle but tired, as she helped him to tip his head back. The cool liquid stung his throat as Draco tried, with difficulty, to formulate an answer. His brain was sluggish, and he couldn’t seem to shape the words with his mouth.
– as he presses fevered kisses against Draco’s cheeks, trying desperately to soothe him, maybe even make him forget. As if, if Harry only holds him close enough – kisses him hard enough – Draco might change his mind, call it all a horrible mistake. Even as he’s thinking it, though, Harry understands the futility. Somewhere deep inside, he realises, a part of him agrees with Draco.
“I remember,” Draco interrupted quickly. “What you said back then, that is. Most of it, I think. Isn’t that what Lee was telling you?” Exposed by his impatience, Draco stared down at his feet.
that at times she hardly stirred from her bed. Draco understood. Some days, it was all he could do to leave his own room.
Draco nodded, grateful for the distraction that making tea afforded him. He had no idea what was going on right now, but he definitely wasn’t up to small talk. He could feel Harry’s eyes on him as he filled up the kettle, and his cheeks grew hot.
way to answer things anymore.” Draco opened his eyes, met Harry’s piercing gaze for just a second, and continued, wiping the sweat from his brow.
that morning, how it had taken exactly three and a half years to finish all the repairs. That was the week that your old Quidditch coach had ordered that enormous batch of Sleekeazy’s, do you remember? We were joking that we’d be able to pick her out straight away in the pictures, because…”
On the last day of Draco’s house arrest, after Collins had grudgingly taken down the Ministry wards, and removed the spell restrictions from Draco’s wand, he Apparated directly to the shop front to pay his landlord and collect the keys. The refurbished flat upstairs was nice and spacious with two bedrooms, thanks to an Extension Charm. It was already connected to the Floo network, so Draco could begin the long-awaited task of moving his personal belongings and all of his equipment out of the Manor. His desperate desire to sell the bastarding place would have to wait a little longer – his mother had found a new lease of life tending the gardens, and around half of his stock of potions ingredients had been harvested directly from the plants there – but Draco himself wasn’t going to spend another night under that roof, not if he could be literally
It takes longer than it should do to right themselves, grubby hands braced against the freshly painted walls of the tiny entrance hall, as the rich notes of their laughter echo through the empty space. It’s late September – trees clinging desperately to their leaves, evenings drawing in apace – and the air feels cool as they stare at each other. Draco’s eyes are wide, almost disbelieving, but still tinged with mirth, and overwhelming fondness rises in Harry’s chest as he winds an arm around his waist. They turn and take it in together: magnolia walls, paper lampshades, sheer curtains; the sun casting a faint rectangle of light on the living room floor. Harry wanders over to it, sits cross-legged on the faded patch of blue carpet, turns his face towards the balcony doors and closes his eyes. A smile steals over his face as he inhales the twin scents of fresh paint and horizonless freedom.
He turns, pleading. The words die on his lips. You watch the way his eyes widen, his back straightens, hear the familiar short, sharp inhale.
“It wasn’t a fling,” Draco echoes, sitting forwards to tug his top over his head, helping Harry to do the same. They undress each other piece by piece, deliberately: Harry’s belt, threaded back through the loops; his socks, peeled off one by one; his fingers shaking, fumbling over the knot of Draco’s baggy hospital trousers. Finally, they’re both naked, hands sliding over familiar puckered scars, pressing into the soft flesh of hips and thighs, tracing down the curve of a spine. Mapping out the contours of each other’s body. Memorising.
Since their arrival, Draco had been entirely distracted with worrying about Leonie, trying to avoid being recognised, and remembering directions. It was only as they walked past the Improper Use of Magic Office – alarming bangs and crashes emanating from within – and an imposing stone archway came into view, that he even began to put the pieces together.
. He’d tossed and turned half the night worrying, and he was desperate to feel the way he had the day before. It worked a treat – the second the glittering liquid hit the back of his throat, Draco smiled. His bright future as the successful proprietor of an apothecary off Diagon Alley was assured once more.
no escape. Through the false window opposite him, London was choking under a thick blanket of fog – it seemed to seep into Draco’s own body too, now, his vision blurring at the edges. He slid down the wall to sit at the bottom, bringing his legs up to his chest, willing himself to stay calm.
For instance, following the Neville/Potter incident, she quickly apologised and conceded that outright insulting him in company wasn’t fair or polite. On the other hand, she laughed outright at his gentle suggestion that she could call him Mr Malfoy, refusing on the grounds that he was only four years older than her – ‘we could have been at
can think of better places than the Leaky! What about that Italian place down the end of our road? They certainly seem popular, and I’m pretty sure most of their regulars manage to wash, so there’s that.” Draco folded his arms around himself.
“Merlin, how awful for him,” agreed Draco. “You’re right, they’ll be writing about this for weeks. I’m sure he won’t blame you, though,” he added, spotting the hangdog look on his friend’s face.
“Come on then. I’m sorry, Draco, I didn’t realise any of that would happen. I must say,” she muttered quietly, as they walked quickly through the courtyard, curious faces turning as they passed, “I rather underestimated
Self-conscious, he looked at Potter, who was staring down at him with a glazed look, lips slightly parted. Draco cleared his throat.
Occamy eggs. A single egg could keep someone supplied with the potion for over a month (not that anyone would be daft enough to use
Abruptly, unexpectedly, it worked! Draco gasped as his legs came free, feet scrabbling desperately at the damp covers as he attempted to propel himself forwards off the bed.
“No, you absolute pillock. Are you getting in or not?” He lifts the pile of blankets so Harry can slide in, fit their bodies together perfectly. Icy hands slip under the back of Draco’s jumper even before their lips meet.
He pulled on his shirt, shaking fingers struggling with the buttons, and looked up. Harry was spread out across the bed, wrapped snugly in the grey woollen blanket, half-smiling in his sleep. Draco’s chest tightened. No, he couldn’t leave. If Harry woke and Draco was gone – had snuck out as though this had been some cheap one-night-stand – it made Draco’s heart hurt a little, even just to consider it. No, there was nothing for it – he had to say something. To let Harry see him as he really was.
Harry sighed. He must have moved closer now; Draco could feel the gentle caress of his breath on the back of his neck.
“Give it up, Harry. C’mon, move, let me spell it open.” Long fingers press insistently against the small of Harry’s back, a bony chin poking over his shoulder. None of it exactly helps matters, and Harry wants to do this the proper way.
knew, of course, but Potter had this wary, confused look on his face, and it was making him uncomfortable. After a second Potter shook his head as if to clear it. “Anyway, do you want me to?”
Crowson leant forward, faking a loud yawn. “Did I ask for your life story? I stopped listening, I’m afraid, so I didn’t catch all of that. I’m just going to put down―” he started writing “―
, always besting him at everything – and for the first time, Draco’s certainty had begun to waver. But he consoled himself with thoughts of everything he had that Potter lacked: parents who adored him, an enormous family home (
By the time Draco returned, sipping lemonade from a champagne glass, Lee was engaged in a giggly conversation with several young witches, and so he opted instead to join Neville, Dean, and Seamus over by the fireplace. The three of them were staring shamelessly across the room to where Ginny Weasley was sat along with a few of her Harpies teammates, who were clearly already half-cut, lounging around a table full of empty glasses and playing a noisy drinking version of Exploding Snap. Dean and Seamus were arguing half-heartedly amongst themselves as they tried to work up the courage to approach the group.
“As a matter of fact, I didn’t. Like I said before, I know what everyone thinks of me. Believe me, I heard it loud and clear back when I was on house arrest. Who’s to say that the minute I landed in Mungo’s I wouldn’t get hexed by some poor sod who lost someone in the war and wants to take it out on me? Besides,” said Draco, gentling his voice, “you know I have all the stuff to deal with it here.”
. I know. C’mon, let’s go back out there. Nat was looking for you, anyway. Let me explain something…”
“How fascinating, Luna. Please, do go on.” Draco winked at Lee, who glowered at him and slowly ground her stiletto heel into the side of his shoe. But Draco didn’t care – truth be told, listening to Luna Lovegood expounding on her crazy but harmless theories was vastly preferable to running the risk of bumping into someone who took offence to his presence.
Harry slanted a brief, curious look towards him, before sinking down on the old stepping stool. Draco stared at him, mind conjuring flickering images of times long past, hazy memories of afternoons spent together layered one over another.
A quiet huff of laughter. Harry brings their joined hands to his mouth, kissing the tips of Draco’s fingers one by one. “To be fair, it took me three months. And the Ministry don’t quite share my level of… motivation. It was a trace – barely even that – of your magic at the Portkey station in Naples. That was all I could find.”
“Close your mouth, darling,” Pansy admonished, digging a sharp elbow into Ginny’s ribs. Ginny complied, scowling, not taking her eyes off the couple for a second.
Entering the courtroom was another matter. As soon as the door swung open to reveal the enormous steel chair in the centre of the floor, Draco’s entire body went cold. Teeth clenched, he stared resolutely at the ground as he slipped quietly onto the bench next to Lee.
Harry turns his hand slowly; lets it rest, palm up, against Draco’s own. “So now we’re both back here. Just a couple of nostalgic fools.”
“Watch your mouth! Bald, honestly,” said Draco, faking outrage, as he nudged his shoulder fondly against Harry’s. He was so tired, and it was much too late. But Harry’s words –
“Oh, I’m sure. It’s not―” He took a deep breath, which hissed past his clenched teeth as he chose his next words “―not something I ever thought I’d have to relive.”
It was strange, thought Draco, lying like this, after everything. Close enough that every shift of Harry’s body moved the quilt against Draco’s side; that when Draco inhaled deeply, he could just catch the edge of Harry’s scent: sandalwood, sweat, and spring rain together. It could only have been a couple of weeks since the last time the two of them had lain atop the bed, not an inch between them, mouths and hands so hungry for each other. There was more than just the quilt dividing them now, thought Draco, ruefully. Harry’s breathing was steady and even, his eyes almost closed, but Draco felt strangely wary, sneaking glances at him every few seconds. Just as he’d begun to wonder if Harry had fallen asleep, Harry turned his head towards Draco.
Behind it stood Harry, deadly still. He wore that same expression that Draco had seen when he’d loomed over Crowson, arm raised, magic crackling all around him. A calm, careful madness. A snake, poised to strike.
, that was all. And Harry never had any of his mates round either – they’d thought he still lived at Grimmauld, and the state of the place had been a convenient enough excuse. They’d always just ended up at some bar or club instead.
of blowing hot and cold you slept with him, let him think you finally liked him back, and then, only minutes later…” He slammed his hand against the marble countertop. Draco jumped, and a stack of plates wobbled precariously in the air.
Draco shifted, quite uncomfortable. Time and again, he’d asked himself that question, only to come up with the same inadequate answer he’d given Neville and Hannah – he’d sought Harry out because it had felt
“I’m surprised that you’d come by. I’ve seen Harry and Ron lately, I’ve walked by your shop, and I got your letter, of course. I guess I just – well, it’s thoughtful of you to visit Garrick, after everything. You heard about his illness, I suppose?”
“Oh Merlin,” said Draco with a sigh, “you’re probably right. I’m really going to have to do this, aren’t I?”
“Oh yeah. I’m meeting Ron.” Harry grinned. “Merlin, he’ll be glad when it’s over. The amount Hermione’s been stressing about all this, I’d be surprised if she wasn’t freaking out somewhere around here right now too. Why, d’you want to walk there together?”
A camera? Draco vaguely recalled something of the sort, but no names sprang to mind. Bile rose in his throat, and he began inching along the wall. His shaky fingers slipped into his pocket, closed around the handle of his wand.
“Bloody awful. There was this one Saturday, right before we played you in third year, he had us flying for seven hours straight.” Harry chuckled. “God, I was so sore afterwards, I could barely…” Harry paused, a nasty realisation washing over him. “Oh. Oh shit.”
“Mmm.” Harry’s eyes were on Ginny as he answered. “Sometimes I do. I don’t bring them up here.” He looked embarrassed. “I… we can get tickets for anywhere.”
Draco couldn’t remember how he’d arrived at the Ministry last time. He did, however, recall his dramatic entrance; the giddy excitement he’d felt when every pair of eyes in the place had turned towards him. How things had changed, he reflected, as he found himself once more standing alone outside the huge golden doors to the Ministry receiving room; this time, of course, with nothing but adrenaline pulsing through his veins. His mind was clouded with that strange, now-familiar déjà vu, and he longed for just a tiny drop of the confidence he’d had last time; wished he could once again stride in without worrying, the world at his feet. Tonight, the best that he could hope for was that he might escape significant harm.
It was purely the shock of finding out Potter was interested in men, Draco decided. It wasn’t that he had never thought about Potter in that way before – in fact, Potter had featured prominently in his wanking fantasies since their days at Hogwarts. But he’d been chock full of self-loathing back then, and the theme of those little daydreams had always been more ‘fuck his stupid speccy face’ than ‘gaze at him lovingly across a dinner table’. Draco was quite used to the former; he wasn’t sure he was at all comfortable with the latter. It must have been all this time spent with only his right hand for company, turning his brain all weird and sappy.
“Because,” Draco continued, words soft but sure, feeling the flex of tendons beneath his lips as his mouth drifted down to Harry’s wrist. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I don’t think it’s a good idea. Not tonight.”
“Well, what can I say, Draco? You made bad choices. I didn’t make them for you, and frankly, I was a little bored of hearing about them, over and over. It was all getting a bit pathetic. Some of us had lives to get on with.”
“My score,” said Harry, abstractedly, forcing a whole host of – frankly ridiculous – images out of his brain. “Well… as much as it pains me to say it―” as he watched, Malfoy’s grin widened once more “―it’s going to have to be a ten.”
Neville, for his part, had passed his apprenticeship, chosen to stay on at Hogwarts, and now shared all Herbology teaching responsibilities. His Potions abilities had definitely improved, he told Draco, but he was very happy to leave the more complicated stuff to Professor Sprout, preferring to spend his free time working on novel techniques for grafting and budding together different species. Several times, he’d offered to show Draco his work if he wanted to Floo over on a weekend, but Draco always declined.
He kissed the top of Harry’s head next, smiled again as he rubbed his face into the mess of curls. “You―” he poked Harry in the chest, his words muffled against Harry’s scalp “―
Yes, Harry had been caught out like that so many times he’d lost count, all in the name of whatever strange philanthropic venture the Ministry had cooked up that month. So when Robards had leant over Harry’s desk to grab a case folder and cheerfully declared through a mouthful of biscuits that he was taking Harry off the Eeylops Owl-Napping case so he could play a charity Quidditch match on Saturday, alarm bells should have rung. Harry should have asked questions. But instead he’d agreed straight away, same as he always did. Just as Robards had known he would. After all, for all that he grumbled, Harry Potter really was a sucker for a good cause.
There were a noisy group of young wix clustered nearby, and Draco could see several wizards glancing over at the pair. One of the younger Flint boys was amongst them, a jealous scowl smeared across his greasy face. As Draco watched him, he recalled a party, many years ago, where rumours had spread that Owen Bletchley had been spotted getting off with a half-blood Ravenclaw after the end-of-term feast. He could still see the spittle flying from old Mr Flint’s lips, and the horror on the children’s faces, as he lectured them for hours about the shame of being associated with non-purebloods. And yet here was his son, staring at Lee with naked want. The irony was delicious.
The fire had been a turning point between them; a focal point for heated discussions from then on, but the kitchen had, of course, seen better times too. At first, Draco – house-elf free for the first time in his life – had developed an addiction of sorts to Muggle cooking shows. He’d loved surprising Harry with his favourite meals, even while he grumbled affectionately about Harry’s simple tastes. Harry glances over at the hob, picturing Draco standing there, wooden spoon in hand, licking sauce off his fingers, turning around with a smile as Harry saunters in…
“Well, for starters, my knees are getting sore. Not to mention the fact that we should probably move off the dress robes which cost more than my rent – and which are now
Harry made a sharp noise through his teeth, leaning in to press a sleepy kiss to Draco’s temple. “Well, you should grow it then, if you want. Or don’t. But for heaven’s sake don’t worry about
Harry’s broom jolted unpleasantly as something – someone – collided with the back of it, knocking him sideways once more. It took a good few seconds for him to right himself, distracted as he’d been. As he straightened up, a set of black robes whizzed overhead, laughing.
In the end he settled on light-hearted and fond, the words thick in his throat as he nudged Harry with his elbow. “So you thought about me for years, huh?”
’s influence extended further than he could even imagine. There was the time that he realised he was running out of dragon liver, only to receive an Owl from Romania two days later informing him that one of the Longhorns had died unexpectedly and that he should expect a large shipment of supplies. Then there was the day that Lee discovered she’d accidentally put in for a double order of Wiggentree bark – and just half an hour later, a Patronus arrived from St Mungo’s with news of a freak accident in the Department of Mysteries requiring as much Wiggenweld Potion as they could brew.
“Draco?” he tries appeasingly, gently pushing the door. It opens slowly, revealing a sight so unexpected that Harry clutches at the doorframe, afraid his legs might buckle. Kneeling on the rug, two large suitcases open before him, is Draco. He doesn’t acknowledge Harry, only raises his wand, sending a pair of trousers flying neatly from the wardrobe into the nearest case.
, the small part of himself that had remained unaffected felt exactly the same way about Harry. What a fool he’d been then, acting on instinct and chasing Harry around with no plan and no idea about the depth of Harry’s – or his own – feelings. Why on earth had he never realised? Why had no one explained it to him before?
He had to admit that he was nervous, but reasoned it was the perfect opportunity to test a second sample of his
to smooth the edges, it was raw and messy, with a little too much tooth and not enough finesse. But Harry didn’t seem to mind – in fact, he gave as much as he got, eyes crinkling affectionately when Draco’s overenthusiasm eventually forced him to pull away, clumsily gasping for air. As Harry leant in, chasing Draco’s lips once more, he grabbed at the sofa for balance, accidentally pulling off the covering sheet. A thick cloud of dust rose from beneath it, and they broke apart once more, coughing.
: since the first day we ‘met’, you’ve been a fantastic friend and so supportive of me and my work. Thank you for all your guidance, for reading this so sensitively, and of course for Britpicking this Brit!
Afterwards, Harry slumped forwards, resting his cheek against Draco’s chest, damp hair tickling at Draco’s chin. Harry’s come was still tacky on Draco’s stomach, and that crazy urge to laugh resurfaced once more, but he swallowed it down, settled for trailing his fingers along the curve of Harry’s spine, enjoying the slow, languorous shift of Harry’s muscles as he stretched contentedly underneath Draco’s palm.
He looked up and cleared his throat. “I know what I said before, but I am grateful to you for today. Truly. But my arm is still sore, I’m half a bottle of Firewhisky down, and I should really get some rest.”
Neville nodded, slowly. “Er, I got an apprenticeship with Pomona – Professor Sprout, I mean – so I’m living at Hogwarts. Working in the greenhouses.”
And right now, there was only one thing he wanted. And it was mere seconds away from stepping out of his Floo.
He scanned through the article, which, to his disgust, filled not just the front page, but the following six; with speculation whether Potter had unfairly hidden his sexual preferences from ‘Harpies star Ginevra Weasley’ and a revolting opinion piece by Skeeter herself debating whether Potter should still be held up as a role model for the wizarding community given his ‘unusual proclivities’.
and some other healing charms. They both watched as it turned from livid purple back to its normal milky white.
“There.” Satisfied, he turned to Draco, an embarrassed smile playing on his lips. Draco regarded him for a second, cast as he was in the dim orange glow of the fire. Harry was dressed in his full work uniform, minus the dragonhide boots. His movements were slow, his posture stooped, and his breathing heavy: even under such low light, his exhaustion was palpable. His hair looked especially dishevelled, as though he’d been running his hands through it all night. Draco’s heart ached to reach out to him.
. He’d always envisaged that he would begin making the most of his good fortune by reapplying for the apprenticeship jobs; so it was with some surprise that instead of reaching for a blank piece of parchment, he found himself rummaging through the very back of the top desk drawer and pulling out a pile of forgotten half-finished letters.
. His stomach was growling, but the very idea of licking sauce off his fingers in front of Harry made him shudder, and so he bought the most inoffensive thing he could find – an enormous pretzel – stuffing far too many Sickles into the vendor’s hand before making for the stairs.
“Yes, yes, congratulations Unspeakables,” said Kingsley over the hubbub. “And well done everybody for this fantastic show of sportsmanship. I’m delighted to announce that your efforts here today have raised over a thousand Galleons!” There was a smattering of polite applause, and a few camera lenses reluctantly turned away from the celebrating Unspeakables, as Kingsley continued. “Such a fantastic total, and I’m absolutely
He sat up instinctively, groaning as every joint in his body protested against the movement. He cracked his eyes open, blinking hard against the daylight, relieved when the familiar sight of his bedroom began to swim into view. Through blurry eyes, he could see an outline in the armchair beginning to stir. He tried to swallow against the gritty sensation in his throat, but he couldn’t, instead taking a rasping in-breath before coughing ineffectually. When he opened his eyes again, Hannah Abbott was perched on the side of his bed, holding a glass up to his lips.
It had seemed the most incredible windfall, at the time. It was only years later, as he crouched, frightened and sick, on his bathroom floor, waiting for Harry to return with the Auror force in tow, that Draco began to rue the day he’d ever ventured into that attic.
“Fuck off yourself, Malfoy. See what thanks I get for making sure you’re all right.” But Potter was smiling back at him. Potter’s eyes were so
Now it’s Draco’s turn to look away, embarrassed, as Harry grins, a mixture of disbelief and genuine pleasure at the thought.
“I thought he wanted to shag me! Repeatedly, maybe! I don’t know, I don’t remember, do I?! I didn’t get that far! All I knew is that I missed him. That I wanted to spend time with him.” Thoughtfully. “That being around him made me feel…” His voice faltered, a sickening realisation slowly dawning.
“Do you know,” said Pansy, talking to Lee, but waving the bottle towards Draco, “a couple of years ago, I did read about Draco taking on a… well, you know…
Harry sat back, looking thoughtful. But Draco had no time to waste. His mouth felt dry, his words beginning to slur together. He needed an answer, and he needed it
Potter kept on coming into Draco’s shop, with his stupid hair and his stupid smiling face, and his stupid big Auror boots stomping all over Draco’s heart, all charming and friendly and right bloody
“You’re not so bad yourself,” breathed Draco with a grin, turning his head to capture Potter’s mouth with his own. Potter groaned, moving into the kiss, just as the first few notes of a rousing Viennese waltz filled the room. Draco pulled back with a wink, clasping Potter’s hand once more, and steered him swiftly into a practiced spin. They moved together with liquid grace, through turn after turn, whirling around the room as the tempo increased. Could anything be more perfect, Draco wondered wildly, than this? The two of them bathed in warm light, the melody surging all around them as the music reached its crescendo, and Potter’s face radiant, eyes shining with joy. Draco beamed back at him, taking another step forward, and –
As Draco half-listened to her chattering away – his headache returning with a vengeance – he found himself growing more and more irritated by her blatant self-centredness. She’d ignored him for over a year, off swanning around Europe with her new friends, knowing that he was miserable at home, and now she wanted to pretend that nothing had changed? Blathering on as though he was desperate to hear about her passionate tryst with a minor Swedish royal, or how she was landscaping the roof garden at her Chelsea townhouse?
It was the first words Malfoy had spoken out loud for hours, and his voice was low and endearingly croaky. Harry’s arms screamed in pain as he angled his broom over to where Malfoy sat, face shining in the light of the crescent moon.
was especially complex and unstable, and perfection was by no means expected. In fact, as it took six months to stew and they only started brewing it in the spring term, they had been judged purely on the appearance and characteristics of the initial mixture. Draco’s had seemed fine, but he knew that didn’t mean much.
“I know. Maybe I like the idea of you owing me a favour.” Potter grinned, crookedly. “After all, who knows when I might need some potions expertise?”
To his amazement, Pansy looked up at him sheepishly – but he gave her a reassuring grin, and it wasn’t long before she returned it, her beautiful, familiar face breaking into a wide smile.
A frustrating week, so, come five o’clock, when Draco catches up to Harry in the endless queue for the Floo, puts his hand on Harry’s shoulder, and speaks – the longest sentence either of them has said all week, no less – Harry wastes no time in swivelling on his heel and making straight for the stairs.
Draco tried, with only partial success, to string together a response. “No, it’s not that. It’s, uh, great. Yes! Walking home. Would be great.”
Eventually they land on the pier. Draco’s brought them back to Southend, Harry realises, but he’s strangely shy about it. Harry rustles up enough coins to buy a single ice cream – mint chocolate chip, Draco's choice – so they share, feet dangling over the edge as the waves crash loudly against the metal below. The sun dips low, the sky’s peach blush spreading across Harry’s cheeks when Draco slides close to rest a careful head on his shoulder.
was talking for you for a long time – it’ll probably take a few weeks before you get your speech back properly. And the patients Hannah read about – they all described their thoughts being a complete mess for the first week too.”
, Potter would find out, Draco would be locked up in Azkaban, the press would go crazy, his mother would never recover.
When he’s sure that Draco’s ready, when he’s loose and pliant beneath him, Harry lines up his cock. Draco’s body is warm and solid against Harry’s own; overcome, he squeezes his eyes shut.
“No. No, no – I – I can change. Let me try, you’ll see.” Harry’s plea hangs in the air between them, and Draco looks over at him now. His eyes are softer, but no less resolute.
Malfoy’s laugh was cold and jarring. “One too many Crucios, it seems. Aunt Bella could be awfully heavy handed at times.”
Draco brought his hand up to wrap around the shaft, gently drawing Harry’s foreskin back and pursing his lips to suck lightly at the glans, before pulling off with a loud
Embarrassingly, Draco felt his face fall. He tried valiantly to recover, to conceal his disappointment with a casual, “Oh? Off anywhere nice?”
She had a point, Hermione supposed, watching, mesmerised, as the shadowy figure floated closer into view. His eyes were wide, two pools of molten silver fixed on her own, and his face was consumed by utter panic. Here, then, was the
’s influence? Of course not. As dawn broke, after a fretful, guilty night, Draco Owled Gringotts to make an anonymous donation to
Pansy stared up at him, taken aback, before waving her hand dismissively. “Whatever. What’s wrong with you anyway, Draco? Is something hitting a little close to home? Or can’t you take a joke anymore?”
Harry swallowed hard against the lump in his throat. He’d fancied an early evening ride to clear his head; had planned to fly over to Hogsmeade and grab a Butterbeer. The last thing he’d expected was to find Malfoy here, slumped against the back of the broom shed, eyes bloodshot, his old Nimbus clutched tightly in trembling hands.
The realisation hit him like a fist to the face. He tried to cry out, to scream, to call for help – Merlin, anything! – but for all his effort, the noise that escaped from his useless throat could barely be called a whimper. Alone and defenceless, he could only stare in horror as the hideous form of Nagini turned her enormous head towards him. Her keen yellow eyes moved over his limp body, considering. For a second, she appeared poised to strike, and he readied himself for the blow… But the next second, she’d turned back to slither down his bedroom wall, her tail sliding slowly out of his line of sight.
As Draco knelt on the tiles, pressing his head against the porcelain, tears welled up behind his eyes. He felt incredibly sick: sick, and dizzy, and
Halfway across the garden, Harry stopped. He turned slowly on the spot. When Draco saw the expression on his face, his voice falter and died abruptly. Whatever reaction he had expected, it certainly wasn’t this – blind, unadulterated rage. Draco’s breath caught in his throat, and he stumbled backwards as Harry marched back up the lawn towards him, eyes blazing. Waves of anger radiated off him, forcing Draco to press himself up against the greenhouse, out of sight of the partygoers. Harry kept coming and coming, leaning in so close that Draco could feel his breath panting fast and harsh against his cheek.
“No,” said Draco, firmly. “That’s not what I mean. It was never meant to be like this. When I started, it was going to be a temporary thing. Everyone hated me back then. They hated me so much, and I just needed a break.” She raised her head, looking at him incredulously. “Look, there are no excuses. I was always planning to come off it, but I couldn’t. I tried, I really did, but it all just got out of control. I know, I’m an arsehole – you’re not wrong about that. But I wasn’t
than everyone else. He was the centre of everything, on a different plane of existence, the world seeming to bend around him.
There was a knot behind Draco’s breastbone, pressing down deep inside. It was making his breath catch in his throat, leaving him gasping for air like a drowning man. He rubbed at his chest desperately with the heel of his hand, trying to make sense of the situation.
“People had been ignoring it for years, because they were scared of him. I… we, Robards and I, could see how dangerous he was, but so far as we could tell he hadn’t done anything strictly
Draco ignored the barb. “Fine, thanks. Good. It’s – I’ve been really busy. I’m surprised, actually, how well things have gone. I’m even thinking of hiring an assistant – can you imagine?” he said, with a half-laugh, trying to diffuse the tension.
He rather regretted raising the subject in the end, as he found himself embroiled in a tedious discussion about the minutiae of the Manor gardens with Professor Sprout and an awkwardly grateful Bryn, which went on for what felt like hours before he finally managed to extricate himself and catch up with Lee. She was deep in conversation with Luna Lovegood and a group of other Wizarding-Adjacents, and she looked at him desperately as he slotted in next to her, giving her arm a squeeze.
“I don’t think so.” Harry thought for a second. “She said something about a boy running through an airport? I reckon there was also a school play, and someone who spoke Portuguese? I’d sort of tuned out by that point, if I’m honest.”
The Manor had two enormous attics. Although Draco hadn’t been up there in years, he remembered them well from childhood as huge rooms filled with treasure, everything half-concealed by sackcloth. He’d dragged his friends up there any moment he could for games of hide-and-seek amongst the old furniture, or to rifle through boxes filled with papers, searching for hidden gems. His parents were less keen, always trying to dissuade him from exploring the chests and drawers for fear of uncovering hidden Dark items. He felt a sudden jolt of nostalgia as he remembered huddling with Pansy in an old wardrobe, the two of them giggling madly as all his mother’s house-elves searched for them outside.

Lee leant towards Draco as a reverent hush fell over the courtroom. “Hey,” she whispered, voice trembling. “You’ve not got any of that
, he drew his finger in a line straight down Draco’s throat and chest. Draco could only stand stock still, heart pounding, as he felt his robes peel open from the top down, the shimmering fabric split in two. Harry’s eyes widened like he was unwrapping a Christmas gift as Draco’s body was finally uncovered.
“No, Potter,” said Malfoy, his eyes fixed intently on the grass below them. Harry followed his gaze down to the score: Aurors 2420 : Unspeakables 2470.
If only things were that simple though, thought Draco, watching as Harry’s head swivelled around for the fourth or fifth time. For all his teasing, Harry was clearly tense – his spine a little too rigid, his shoulders slightly too high – and he was sat forwards, instinctively holding himself just a fingers-breadth apart from Draco. Draco knew all too well where Harry’s mind was going, as another heavy sigh echoed through the room. Draco had removed the bathroom cabinet soon after he’d gotten sober, replacing it with a plain mirror – he, too, had been unable to bear looking at it. Had he known Harry would be bathing in here, Draco thought, regretfully, he’d have torn out the whole damn lot.
To an outside observer, Draco’s life must have looked pretty perfect. And sure, it was nice to be able to afford the clothes he wanted, not to have to worry about his mother all the time, and to have some standing in society again. Draco himself – now a supplier to St Mungo’s – had even received an invitation to their charity ball, one of the most prestigious events on the wizarding social calendar. He’d declined, of course, but still: a Malfoy, just under four years after the war’s end, a guest at a Ministry event once more! It was truly incredible.
It had taken until the end of the first match, every gust of wind causing the old wooden beams to creak and groan alarmingly, for Draco to realise exactly why Harry had chosen seats all the way up here. He pressed his point, needing Harry to
Potter tensed, his knuckles turning white where they gripped the seat beneath him. Not blind then, thought Draco, with a thrill of excitement.
Potter obliged, handing over a single dark strand. Draco placed it in a cauldron, where it made a loud crackling sound and emitted a spicy-sweet smell, like gingerbread fresh from the oven. He stirred it five times clockwise, tipped the thick, sky-blue potion out into a vial and cooled it rapidly with a modified
“She’s not wrong, Malfoy,” said Potter, watching her with a broad smile. “Robards just about lost his mind when I came back to work two days after practically cutting my leg off. Said he’d never seen anything like it. You’ll have to speak to Mungo’s now – have a word with Hannah, she’ll get you an in. I’ll write a reference, or whatever you need.”
Ginny’s mouth had fallen open again, and Pansy slipped a comforting arm around her waist. “Trust me, Gin, this will be
Harry took a slow deep breath in, but nodded. He leant forwards, began mouthing exploratory kisses over Draco’s breastbone, where the longest scar slashed a pale pink line across his skin, and Draco relaxed once more, pressing his head back into the pillow with a grunt. Harry nosed his way down Draco’s body, nipping playfully at the sensitive skin of his stomach, before finally relenting and taking Draco all the way into his mouth. He immediately set up a relentless, determined pace that had Draco regretting that he’d ever rushed him – he’d been hard for what felt like an age, after all, and after barely a minute of Harry’s single-minded ministrations, lost in the soft wet heat of Harry’s mouth, he could already feel his balls beginning to tighten. Mustering all his strength, he pushed at Harry’s shoulder.
Either side of the dance floor were numerous tables, straining under the weight of enormous cherry blossom centrepieces, where house-elves were hard at work clearing away the last of the crockery. Completing the look, petals had been charmed to fall continuously from the ceiling, disappearing just above the guests’ heads. The sweet scent of cherry blossoms lingered in the air, and the overall effect was spectacular, although so very pink that Draco had a momentary flashback to Dolores Umbridge’s office.
Draco scowled at them both, unconvinced, before dropping his feet back over the edge of the wall. As much as she might pretend to be an expert, Leonie was still only nineteen, with typically teenage ideas about love and relationships. He knew she cared about them both, but sometimes, with all her sighing and swooning (
It didn’t take long for that feeling to fade. After the final comfort break, Harry and the others returned to their brooms, their moans and groans louder than ever before. Lofts was crying – loud, choking tears borne of both exhaustion and rage – as she wobbled back up into the sky. She wasn’t the only one, either – Ron’s face was suspiciously blotchy, and even Harry found himself suppressing a scream as the clock resumed its inexorable countdown: 05:59, 05:58, 05:57…
Mostly, though, Harry watched Draco fill and package the orders, passing him things as needed, keeping up a constant stream of chatter. It was all so familiar that Draco’s brain felt as though it was overloading with slivers of old memories, all slotting back into place like bricks in a wall. But this –
) Quidditch gear for the first time since Hogwarts, Draco paced back and forth in his flat. It had been years since he’d been out in public without
“Are you coming?” asked Draco suddenly, already striding off round the side of the hill. Harry shrunk his broom, feet slipping on bracken as he scrambled to catch up. Silently they moved over the rough downland, edging past thorny trees and clambering over rocks, when a sudden roar from behind them had Harry jumping backwards in surprise. He crouched behind a bush, wand out, automatically assuming the defensive stance they’d all been taught in Auror training.
been Draco who’d wanted to keep things secret, hadn’t it? Yes, he thinks, it definitely had. Back when the press had been camped out by the school gates, sneaking in hidden devices to spy on Harry, and Draco had still been dodging Tripping Jinxes and worrying about what his mum would think. Sure, the world had moved on a bit since then, but it still made sense to keep things between them, didn’t it?
, can I ask, what now? Only, you might have noticed that I’m on a bit of a schedule. If you stay much longer, I’m either going to pass out or vomit. Or both.” He closed his eyes, swallowing against the bile rising in his throat. “And as much as I’m sure you didn’t expect a repeat of last night, I’m pretty sure you don’t want to be around for that, either. So if we’re going to carry on this little chat, you’re going to have to get me some more
Pansy and Lee, sprawled languidly across their respective deckchairs, were apparently entirely unaffected by his tragic tale. In fact, as he watched, they exchanged knowing smiles. He rolled his eyes, hating them both a tiny bit.
“I know,” he says carefully, letting his hand settle casually against the side of Draco’s leg, “I know you thought I was ashamed of you. I know that’s what I let you believe, but I swear it wasn’t – it wasn’t that. Not really. It was selfishness, again. I wanted –” he swallows, “I wanted you all to myself. It was probably – no, definitely – the second worst mistake I’ve ever made. I’m so, so sorry, Draco.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Do you think I’m a complete idiot?” He sighed. “Look, I need to talk to you properly, but I can’t trust a word you’re saying while you’re on that shit. How long will it take to wear off?”
’s effects – biting back increasingly suggestive remarks, snatching his treacherous hand from where it hovered over Potter’s waist as Draco squeezed past him into the lab – that he certainly wasn’t going to feel bad about sneaking the odd appreciative glance at Potter. And if he
Draco shook his head, covering it with his hands. They’d been in there for two days, waiting for their trials to begin. Denied more than a few seconds of sleep at a time, all Draco could do was focus on his mother’s weight as she slumped against his side, and try to stay awake by any possible method. Parched lips hardly moving, he cleared his throat and began reciting once more.
Slowly, not breaking eye contact, Draco reached for the gold clasps which held the front of Harry’s robes together. Harry’s smile widened – permission, Draco realised. He flicked one open deftly, and then another. The black fabric started to strain across Harry’s broad chest, the weight of the aiguillette pulling it taught between his shoulders. Draco winked and gave the robes a firm tug, undoing the remaining clasps in a single swift movement. Harry growled as they dropped to the floor, struggling to step out of them and kick them away, pulling his shirt over his head as he did so, before grabbing Draco’s collar and capturing his mouth again in a bruising kiss. Draco looked down. The warm expanse of Harry’s muscled chest lay before him, and he ran his hands over it, exploring, rolling a nipple gently between his fingers. Once again, he felt dizzy with possibility, his magic tingling everywhere he touched Harry.
“I know. And yet…” he held out a hand to Draco, pulling him up, gathering him in close. He pressed a kiss to his nose, holding the door open with a teasing bow. “After you, my Lord.”
“All gone, I’m afraid,” came Harry’s voice from the doorway. Draco couldn’t help opening the cabinet anyway, grabbing frantically at the drawer inside, heart sinking painfully at the sight of its empty interior.
They got out; Harry wrapping a towel around himself while Draco fussed about emptying the tub. On turning, though, he was startled to find Harry still right there, standing in the threshold of the door, staring out into the bedroom.
Twice so far, he’d gone over to his bathroom cabinet, opened it up, and stared at the little golden vials within. But
“Someone could walk in at any minute. We’ll be – stop it!” he grinned, trying to bat Draco away as he continued kissing down the side of Harry’s neck. “I mean it! There are reporters here. We’ll be on the front page tomorrow if you’re not careful. Let’s go somewhere. Preferably somewhere with, you know, a bed.”
It had been a direct warning to him, disguised as the morning’s entertainment. Fail in your task, let me down like your father did, and this will be the consequence. One flick of the wrist, a twenty-foot drop.
was waging a war on his body. His legs wanted to carry him to the bathroom. His fingers itched to hold a vial. He got as close as opening the drawer they were kept in before pulling his hands away and forcing himself to return to the bedroom.
Harry surrendered, his eyes rolling upwards as Malfoy worked his upper back with incredible skill, pressing his thumbs in deep and eliciting even louder groans of pleasure. Malfoy’s slow, slightly shaky breaths disturbed the hairs on the back of his neck and to his utter embarrassment, Harry suddenly found himself getting… hard. He shifted on his broomstick subtly, leaning back in an attempt to avoid putting any pressure on the area. But if Malfoy noticed, he didn’t say – in fact, he didn’t say anything at all, merely persisting in his gentle stroking motions, skilled hands running gently over the hills and valleys of Harry’s spine, drifting down, further and further until they were kneading his lower back through his jersey – and
Draco pulled on his bathrobe, patting the pockets for his wand. He extracted it and pointed it towards the bath. He felt more than a little silly, so he drew himself up tall, trying to ignore the way Harry was staring at him as though he’d lost his mind.

scars that still criss-crossed over his chest. Instantly, he knew that he didn’t want Harry to see them, that he couldn’t have any reminders of their past shattering this fragile new connection between them. Fortunately, Harry’s eyes were instead drawn to the bulge at the front of Draco’s boxers. Taking advantage of this moment of distraction, Draco dropped to his knees, nimble hands moving to trace the outline of Harry’s cock where it pressed against the seam of his trousers. Harry let out a loud moan.
The third time Neville came to visit, he returned Draco’s book, along with some potion samples for Draco to critique. He helped Draco’s mother in the garden while Draco watched, and later took a break to relay the story – complete with actions – of Hagrid’s futile yet increasingly desperate attempts to de-gnome his pumpkin patch. Draco and his mother fell about laughing as Neville stumbled back and forth, cursing and swinging his arms all over the place.
“Oh, you remember that, do you?” said Harry, smile turning positively indecent. “You want to fuck me?”
Draco remembered her all right – recalled her quick draw and steady voice as she’d turned him into a slug. Not wishing to incite a repeat, he stayed silent.

“You should eat it, you know. You’re far too skinny, and you’re definitely going to need your strength once the
“Ah.” It made sense. He’d had a Glamour on for travel; hadn’t known whether removing it as the Portkey activated would work. It had been his only option at the time.
“Thought I might find you out here.” Potter’s voice echoed off the walls around Draco as he closed the gap between them.
He sounds uncertain, unprepared, and Harry strokes his thumb reassuringly. “I can’t, not today.” He wants to – probably could, really – but something’s telling him to wait, to take his time. He’s already messed this up once, after all. “Look – why don’t you find a flat first? Get yourself sorted; get settled at work. There’s no rush. I’m not going anywhere.”
Harry laughed – a cold, unpleasant sound. “You don’t know, do you? You don’t even know what you’re asking for.”
“Into what kind of thing? You mean, Squib rights?” He broke off at the sight of Lee’s scowl. “You know, Wizarding-Adjacent is a really awkward phrase.”
First of all, I have to give enormous thanks to the two people without whom this fic would never have seen the light of day. To
. An angry wind followed him, swirling through the garden; Draco could just make out the shocked cries of the guests over the sudden cacophonous rustling of leaves. He watched as Harry muttered something to Ron, hardly breaking his stride, before disappearing back into the house. Ron looked straight over at Draco, followed by Hermione, then Hannah. Slowly, as the gale subsided, more and more heads turned until, before Draco knew it, the entire crowd was staring at him. He could hear their confused murmurs rising in volume as he desperately fumbled for his wand. Hannah’s pitiful expression was the last thing he saw as he spun on the spot, vanishing – far too late – into blissful nothingness.
He lifted his head from where it rested against the other man’s damp shoulder, reaching down to tuck himself back in. But before he could return the favour, he felt the familiar tug of
seemed weirdly on board with all this, but Granger and Lee together struck Draco as a lethal combination, and one best avoided.

The day of the next match finally rolled around, and Draco still had no idea what to expect. Things didn’t get off to a great start, despite his best intentions, for ten minutes before he’d planned to leave, he was startled when – of all things – Hermione Granger’s head popped up in his fireplace, wanting to discuss the books he’d found. Of course, Draco couldn’t explain where he was going, and when he tried to mention
a sobering thought? And what of the Gryffindors? They didn’t know him, not really. Did Draco have a single friend who would stick around if he wasn’t taking potions? He couldn’t be sure – and wasn’t
Hardly able to believe his ears, Draco took a tentative step forward. He wanted to grab Harry, to shake some sense into him. “This,
Harry’s brain whispered, but he pushed it aside: all that sadness and shame he’d buried deep since that final, awful night. No, that wasn’t true. It had been private,
Eventually, the last of the employees emerged from the Manor, setting a barking alarm and pulling the enormous front doors closed with a grunt. He shone a torch around the grounds for a while to check for any stragglers, before heading home. The moon hung bright in the sky now, reflecting off the surface of the lake. Draco’s face seemed paler than usual, otherworldly in its stillness. Harry nudged his head against his shoulder.
not by the way he kept running his hands through his hair, making Harry ache to turn around and lick a rough stripe up his underarm. No, thank you very much; when the illegal breeding ring had turned up, Harry had actually been very successfully distracting himself from all of the above by tossing bits of crispy duck to a mangy-looking cat. Fortunately, Draco was ignoring the both of them, and he fired off hexes sweet and easy, so that within ten minutes they were done and dusted, uniforms tugged back on to sweat-sticky bodies and all transported to the Ministry just in time for lunch. Not that there's time for lunch, of course: just five hours of paperwork and a lot more swearing.
His suppliers also seemed to be experiencing unexpectedly good fortune. Charlie Weasley himself had written to let Draco know that their dragon breeding programme had had its best year to date, and enormous packages begun to arrive from Romania – almost double his previous order size – at no apparent extra cost.
The voices were all around him, and he recognised the words they were saying, but none of it made sense. It was bizarre, thought Draco, to be here, but not
A sharp twinge shot through the fingers of his left hand, making him gasp. Right. He needed to sort out his arm. With as much focus and energy as he could muster, he

“No worries. Good luck with the shop, Malfoy. See you soon, hopefully.” He left the lab, and a few seconds later Draco heard the door to the store chime again. He turned to Neville.

“My numbing charms?” Harry spoke slowly, still disarmed by this new information. A twenty-four-hour Quidditch match? Where the hell did they come up with this shit?
“I’m thinking that someone should have done this years ago. I’m thinking that I’m doing the world a favour! Everyone knows it… I don’t know how he’s
was an enormous photograph of Potter, walking next to a taller man whose face was turned away from the camera. Potter was laughing, and briefly reached out to touch the man’s bicep, before the scene repeated itself. Draco could see Neville and a girl who he vaguely recognised walking behind them, out of focus.
Harry placed a soothing hand on his arm, gently extracting the offending mug from his grip and handing it back to its bewildered owner.
Draco rolls over, pressing his lips to that infuriating mouth, hating him just a little: the way he thinks nothing of barging straight into Draco’s careful, uncomplicated life, kindling hope in his chest where it doesn’t deserve to be. He does it every time.
“Harry, I’m not―” he tried desperately, but it was all too much, and he was rapidly losing the power of thought – so the landing it was, then. Keep this up for another minute, Draco realised, and he’d be coming in his pants like a horny teenager. It was all very well for things to be a little rough and ready, he thought – it

Harry’s voice was soft, nearby. A fleeting movement heralded a feather-light touch to Draco’s chin, as Harry tilted his head up with a single finger.
Potter shifted a fraction. He wet his lips. Deliberately, almost imperceptibly, without taking his eyes off Draco, he drew his knees apart.
“What I mentioned last year. About getting dinner sometime. That offer still stands, if you’d like.”
“I―” Harry began, but before he could finish his thought, both teams came clattering through the bushes, forcing them to spring apart even further.
“I know, I know. You’re busy with work, you already said. And I know you’re probably just being nice, trying to let me down gently. But I like you, Malfoy. I want to get to know you better. Sometimes I think you like me too, but… well, other times…”
Lee cleared her throat, looking more than a little alarmed. “Wait a second. You’re going to cast a spell that means we can tell Pansy anything, and she’ll
Judging by past experience, he had maybe thirty minutes before the withdrawal symptoms would get so severe that he’d be rendered absolutely useless, and probably incapable of speech. And then what would happen? Maybe he’d be locked up and never see Harry again. Maybe Harry would simply leave him there to waste away on his living room floor. Had Harry always known about the
, most weekends he felt like a prisoner within its walls, and so the sudden, stark realisation that what he missed the most was flying shouldn’t have come as such a surprise. But it did, and it gnawed at him, and even taking his old Nimbus out for a spin at the Manor on a Sunday did nothing to sate his desire. Before he knew it, he was spending the long nights fantasising about getting on a broom and just taking off, speeding in any direction until he could see the sun peeping up over the horizon.
“I need to see how it interacts with the skin, obviously. Remember, you’re my – what did you call it? Giddy pig?”
?” Draco’s outraged voice echoed through the cavernous entrance hall. A group of schoolchildren paused, halfway up the ornate staircase, looking around curiously for the source of the outburst.
. Let’s do it, right now.” He splays his hands out deliberately over Draco’s torso, the pads of his fingers moving reflexively over the familiar bumps and hollows of Draco’s ribcage, frowning when Draco doesn’t respond. “Come

“Really? You always hated that place! I’m surprised you haven’t sold it – or burned it, with the way you used to talk.”
are you not getting this? When I – you know, last time…” Draco made a vague, hopeless gesture at the lower half of his face. Harry continued to look blank. “
With one last glance back in the mirror (“truly exquisite!”), he headed towards his bathroom, feet gliding smoothly across the floor. His robes might have been perfect, but there were still plenty of things that could go wrong. If ever an occasion called for an extra dose of good luck, it was this one.
Someone leaves the laundrette behind them, and there’s a sudden burst of noise: the rumble of the dryers and loud Muggle music. They both stare at the floor, Harry tapping his trainers in a puddle. Eventually the door swings shut, and it’s quiet again.
Red cord winds around your hands. Weasley glares daggers as his sister wails, prostrate on the floor. Harry's spiteful nails score your palm. He drags you forward, too rough.
Harry Potter was walking towards him, alone, wearing that same intense, inscrutable expression he’d worn all evening. Right on cue, that irritating voice in the back of Draco’s mind which had been nagging at him all night tried to start up again, telling him that it wasn’t a good idea. Exasperated, he pushed it aside. Hadn’t tonight proved it? Draco was as worthy as anyone. He could do

“Look,” said Harry, sharply, “you don’t need me to tell you that what you did was idiotic, and hurtful, not to mention incredibly dangerous. But I
notice Malfoy, looking directly at him, an orange slice held tightly between thumb and forefinger. A thin line of juice was running down his forearm, and as Harry watched, Malfoy raised his eyebrows, and without breaking eye contact, brought his arm to his mouth and in one slow, suggestive swipe, licked it clean.
He was lost, distracted by Harry’s soft whines, entranced by the way his body writhed at Draco’s every touch, and it was only when Harry bit him gently on the shoulder – eyes hazy, pupils dark and imploring – that Draco thought to withdraw his fingers, shifting under Harry and replacing them with his cock: a slow, easy slide that had them both groaning with pleasure. Harry leaned back down then, rested his elbows on either side of Draco’s face, pressed their cheeks together, and began to rock his hips against Draco’s.
allowed Draco precisely one second of utter disbelief. Then he took Potter’s hand in his own and shook it smoothly, as though they hadn’t been lifelong enemies on opposite sides in a brutal war. “Potter.”
The first thing Draco saw was a mop of blonde curls gathered up into a messy bun at the back of her head. The second was a stern face, pointy chin held high and thin lips pressed into such a tight line that she could have been a long-lost Malfoy, were it not for her outfit, which was a scruffy Muggle thing – like jeans, but coming up to her chest, with straps over the shoulders. Her hands were in her pockets, and she was scuffing her feet back and forth on the floor, her haughty look belied by this obvious sign of nerves.
Harry Floo into his flat in the middle of the night, drop a bombshell like that – oh sorry, I just felt like casually snooping into your private humiliation – and then have the gall to start preaching about right and wrong. He shook his head, digging his nails into his fists and taking a deep breath to help the words come out coherently.
Draco looked around, stunned, as finally – unencumbered by both plant pots and hostile faces – he was able to properly take in his surroundings. Whenever Neville had described their home to Draco, he’d raved about the weather, the fertile ground, and the enormous outdoor space, leaving Draco with the impression of some run-down cottage surrounded by fields. On the contrary, their house – an old barn on the outskirts of a Muggle village, just outside the New Forest – had been beautifully restored, with an open-plan layout and glass windows all across the back to allow in the morning sun. In fact, in the absence of angry ex-schoolmates, it had a very pleasant feel: homely, but surprisingly light and modern.
He forced his feet to keep moving. The last time Draco had walked this corridor, he remembered, it’d been between two Aurors on the way to his house arrest. The time before, he’d been dragged down it before a laughing Crowson and his merry band of torturers – and Harry, he reminded himself. Draco looked around. Was it him, or were the ceilings low in here? The air seemed thin too, and the hum of distant voices mocked him. His wand arm itched, and he released his hold on Lee to feel the length of wood reassuringly still there in his pocket, keeping a loose grip on the handle. He shivered, the hairs on the back of his neck standing up. Lee turned to him, nose wrinkling in confusion.
There were no moments of unexpected genius in this match: no heart stopping, world ending smiles for Draco. In fact, it was almost over before it began – twenty minutes of the most one-sided Quidditch that Draco had ever witnessed, rain hammering down as the Cannons’ Keeper let in goal after goal, until mercifully, the Snitch was caught, ending the punishment. But to Draco, watching from under their Impervius bubble, spending most of the game trying to eat a giant twisty breadstick in a quiet, dignified manner, it felt different. Harry seemed softer today, more contented, his limbs looser. A couple of times, their shoulders brushed as Harry jumped up and down to follow the play, and while Draco tensed each time, Harry didn’t pull away. When the match was over, Draco stood so that Harry could pass by. But this time Harry stopped, his eyes flicking up to Draco’s.
Draco listened with a degree of scepticism, as Neville bent to examine some ferns. “Are you sure? Only, I knew old Birtwhistle quite well when I was a boy. I always suspected they had some dodgy activity going on there, but I assumed they were paying some Ministry official to turn a blind eye. They’ve been on Diagon for ever, though. They’ll find some way to reopen.”
in the evenings. But then he’d suddenly find himself overwhelmed with concepts for new potions, or ways to reorganise the shop, or plans for expanding the premises. At first, a few drops of Dreamless Sleep countered this unfortunate side-effect, but before long he found himself needing something more to settle his racing thoughts. A few good swigs of Firewhisky on top seemed to do the trick, but left him so sluggish and hungover on waking that he struggled to function, leaving him with no choice but to increase his morning dose of
To Draco’s dismay, it had taken Granger precisely two hours to respond to his Owl with an officious note requesting to meet Lee later that week. As Potter had predicted, Lee jumped at the opportunity for a sympathetic ear, and so Draco set them up some chairs in his lab. He hovered for a while, unsure if his presence was required, but keen to get back to work.
“Great.” Draco closed his eyes, cheeks hot as anger warred with embarrassment inside him. He threw open the sash window noisily, sticking his head as far out as it would go, inhaling gratefully and feeling the cool night air enter his lungs. Harry’s words were wonderfully distant from out here.
, he’d proved himself to still be pretty decent on a broom, wheeling around the pitch, dodging Bludgers and taking everything in as though no time had passed since Hogwarts. When he’d finally, dramatically, caught the Snitch, cementing a sweet victory over the staff from the Daily
They turned back to the table. Neville continued to sit in thoughtful silence. Draco took another sip of his tea.
Draco stepped forward. “Longbottom.” Politeness dictated that he should offer his hand, but he felt suddenly certain that Longbottom would decline, so, in lieu of this, he nodded and waved him forward. “You’re most welcome. Please, come through.” He gestured to the door to the drawing room. Longbottom nodded back at him and walked through. Draco noted with some interest the way Longbottom’s arse moved in his tight grey trousers, before thinking to himself with a half-smile that he must have been on house arrest far too long if he was resorting to checking out Neville Longbottom’s bum.
“Fly? No. It’s my balance, you see, it’s – oh, don’t look so horrified, Potter, at least you’ll have free run at the Quidditch Cup this year.” He smiled weakly. “It’s stupid, really. My casting’s off; I can barely control my magic. Can’t even chop Potions ingredients. Flying should be the least of my worries.”
she’d looked at him witheringly, as though she’d caught him playing truant, so now he was running late. To make matters worse, he hadn’t had time to eat, and all the Cannons had on offer was Muggle-style food: burgers and hot dogs and chicken wings and other sticky and greasy things which Draco knew you were supposed to eat
cellar, to be…” he began. Lee coughed loudly. “Er, I mean, it’s lovely to see you too, Luna. You look beautiful today.”
“Hannah?” he called out as he approached the threshold, voice embarrassingly unsteady. “Is that you?”
Stubble scratches at Draco’s skin as he speaks, making Draco squirm away, suddenly ticklish. “Bit of this, bit of that. Farming, mostly. Back in the autumn I helped out with the olive harvest. The beach is about ten minutes away – I cycle, can you imagine? – and one of my neighbours brings me English novels when they come in to the local library. It’s not much, but –”
Draco had only been asleep for an hour or so when he woke with a start, immediately on edge and unsure why. He rolled over, instinctively grabbing for his wand, caught by surprise when his grasping fingers found nothing but cool air. Memories of recent events flooded his sleep-fogged mind, and he cracked a wary eyelid open to survey the room.
hated that bitch Granger. The way everyone thought she was Miss Perfect… well, I knew better. I would swear that it was her who hexed me with those fucking antlers in fifth year, too. But the difference is, Draco, I didn’t talk about her constantly. I didn’t go on and on about how annoying it was that she looked so good despite clearly making zero effort over her appearance. And I

, I mean – which I’m pretty sure sober me can’t do. If you get my drift.” He raised his eyebrows purposefully at Harry, who, to Draco’s frustration, looked completely perplexed.
They shuffled along in companionable silence, Draco’s breath forming little clouds of condensation, as all around them the shops closed up for the day. Lee squeezed his arm. “Anyway, I’ve got to ask you something.”
seem to have changed, somehow. It was actually – dare I say it – quite fun. I’d like to come back some time, if you’d have me.”
It was getting late now, past bedtime really, though neither of them dared to say it. The remains of the takeaway Harry had picked up from Chinatown had been banished to the kitchen, and so they sat, bodies curled together, deep amongst the squishy leather cushions of what used to be Draco’s antique armchair. Harry traced the whorl of velvety hair at Draco’s crown with a finger, as Draco tried desperately not to yawn.
If truth be told, it wasn’t as though Draco had never considered trying to recover the rest of his memories before. He’d been working on it, loosely, with his Mind Healer for a while now – learning to integrate his skewed recollections with reality – and he was remembering more and more each day. It usually occurred at random, with recollections triggered by familiar events – a regular customer popping in, perhaps, or Leonie mentioning something offhand. Draco had only made conscious attempts to retrieve specific memories a handful of times, at the recommendation of his Mind Healer. In order to bring forth scenes, she’d encouraged him to focus hard on minute, seemingly irrelevant details: what had the weather been like that day? What potion was Draco brewing at the time? What was he wearing? It was tiring, and tiresome, and when it worked well, Draco inevitably ended up upset and ashamed by the end of the session.
Harry yawns loudly, stretching out across the sofa. The bangs and crashes from the bedroom are getting harder to ignore, so he grudgingly sets down his magazine and shuffles over to the door. Draco’s had his first trainee shifts at the hospital this week; it’s not gone well so far. He’d arrived home not long ago – truthfully, Harry had been engrossed in an article about the UK’s best flying routes, had barely looked up at the sound of Draco’s voice from the entrance hall. But then the angry noises had begun, presumably directed at him, and now he’s getting slightly concerned for the integrity of his possessions.
man in public.” Draco looked up in the direction of Potter’s voice. Out of the corner of his eye could see an enormous crowd, a blur of different coloured Quidditch jerseys. He could see Dean Thomas, running over towards them. But mostly, he could see Potter, standing with his arm out in front of him – no wand in sight – still pointing directly at Crowson. Draco tilted his head to get a better view. Potter stood stock still, although his hand was shaking slightly. His expression could almost have been mistaken for blank were it not for the fire blazing in his eyes, which were focussed on Crowson. He looked, thought Draco, like a hunter, dispassionately marking his prey. The air around him seemed strangely still, as though he existed in a different universe to the chaotic scene playing out behind him. The whole tableau was nothing short of terrifying, and yet, despite the sickening pains in his arm and ribs, Draco couldn’t look away from Potter’s face.
Suddenly, a scream. It was one of the Holyhead chasers, with Ellis for the Cannons right in her slipstream, yelling urgently to her teammate as she raced overhead, forcing the front row spectators to duck and weave. Both Bludgers hit the wooden boards to the side, their loud cracks making both Harry and Draco jump backwards. A gust of wind followed the speeding players, and they reached out to steady each other as the ground below their feet wobbled. The moment was gone. Draco laughed, shakily, hand grasping Harry’s robe at the waist, feeling solid flesh below soft fabric.
“Morning, Draco.” She nodded at him, amused. Little wisps of hair were just beginning to escape from last night’s plait. “This is even earlier than I thought we’d be seeing you.”
’s notoriously unreliable ‘scoops’, but the way Potter’s cheeks were turning red, his mouth curving up into a dopey smile, made Draco come over suddenly queasy. He packaged and handed over the salamander blood mechanically, before making blatant excuses and retreating to his lab.
That bothered him. While plenty had happened over the past few years that he was keen to forget, the thought of forgetting the details of the times he knew he’d felt the happiest – Harry’s visits, Quidditch, Lee, seeing his mother – was awful. But try as he might, to his immense frustration, the memories remained inaccessible. Hidden away, behind a locked door, with no way of knowing if they’d ever return.
Draco felt his fist grow wet, coated with Harry’s release. He kept it curled loosely around Harry’s cock as Harry continued to thrust weakly forward, riding out the last of his climax, a long, low gasp ripped from his throat.
needn’t have bothered training since Draco always caught the Snitch straight away. Gone was all that camaraderie he’d felt, his joy at being part of a team once again.
It was only much later that Draco finally opened his eyes, to find Hannah staring down at him. Her relief at his lucidity was palpable. The fever had subsided, she told him, and he’d stabilised a lot overnight. The potions and alcohol should have worked their way out of his system by now, and with a bit of luck, things should start to improve.
And he was gone, a blur of orange joining all the others hurrying down the stairs, before Draco could even consider his reply.
up for it. She happily nipped out to grab some Firewhisky – there was no way to avoid alcohol without arousing Pansy’s suspicions, after all – and the three of them ended up (in a much more pleasant rehash of Draco and Pansy’s last meeting) upstairs at the kitchen table. The two girls passed the bottle back and forth, excitedly discussing Pansy’s wedding plans – the ring had been given to her by a Swiss banker named Michel, it turned out – while Draco sipped grumpily at a glass of cordial, belatedly realising his big mistake. If seeing Lee and Hermione together had made him nervous before – well, comparing that to the unholy alliance that was Lee and Pansy was like comparing a Kneazle to a Manticore.
He’s clearly come up with some awfully Gryffindor reason why you’re better off apart. You’ll just have to figure it out and convince him otherwise. Trust me, darling, it’ll all work out soon enough.”
each morning for news. This brought Draco nothing but misery – he’d feel sick to his stomach as he suffered through blow-by-blow accounts and pages of photographs of every date Harry went on. He scoured each issue cover to cover, but it was no good – there were no solid clues whatsoever as to Harry’s whereabouts.
But no sooner had he swallowed, shuddering as energy began to return to his exhausted body, than the roar of the Floo sounded unexpectedly from outside. Guiltily, he hurried out into the bedroom, where he was met by the sight of Harry Potter’s head, twisting hither and thither as he searched for Draco from within the flames.
he kept in the hidden drawer at the bottom of his bathroom cabinet. Had he closed the drawer properly that morning? He opened his mouth to say something – to ask Theo to use the other bathroom – but the very second the thought crossed Draco’s mind, Theo changed course, heading out of the bedroom. Draco heard the other bathroom door slam. He threw his head back against his pillows and let out a long groan.
“Look,” said Pansy, “you already know he thinks you’re fit. He’s a man – trust me, that’s half the battle won. If I was in your shoes, I’d just flash him a bit of cleavage and he’d be handcuffed to the headboard before you could even say ‘chuck me that harness, would you?’”
“She’s been invited to the Wizengamot in a few months’ time to speak for a new bill to improve rights for Wizarding-Adjacent people – Squibs, that is,” he added for his mother’s benefit. “She’s been working with support groups, met lots of other Wizarding-Adjacents. Hopefully, if the bill passes, the Ministry will start registering their births, and helping them to get work. It can be hard to find decent employment in the wizarding world – the stigma, you know – and I wonder whether Lee might know someone who’d like to work outdoors, knows a bit about magical plants, that kind of thing. Then, when we sell off the Manor, we could retain some of the grounds. They could even live in the old gatekeeper’s lodge, if they wanted. You could show them what to do. Of course―” he added quickly, “―that’s if you wouldn’t mind. I know it’s not – that father wouldn’t have liked – I don’t know
to smooth over the situation – aside, and managed to navigate introductions with his other teammates. He recognised one of them, Bradley, who’d played chaser for Ravenclaw at school and now worked at Quality Quidditch Supplies, but happily he didn’t know anyone else. He had no idea what Thomas had said about his involvement, but no one was directly insulting him or reaching for their wand, which was about as much as Draco had hoped for. Instead, they all regarded Draco silently with expressions ranging from unsure to outright suspicious, as he considered what to say next. Pressure started building up in his chest, stifling his breathing. Sticking around for a chat was definitely not going to endear him to this lot, so, trying to ignore the six pairs of eyes watching his every move, Draco grabbed a jersey off the ground and tugged it over his head. He mounted his broom and kicked off, praying to anyone who’d listen that he wouldn’t make a complete fool of himself.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Obviously. But Dittany only does so much – it cauterises the wound, draws the skin back together, but healing deeper injuries takes time and draws heavily from your own magical reserves. My salve rejoins muscle and fascia too, and it should work immediately because it’s specific to individuals – you add a hair to the mix. Got the idea from Polyjuice, actually. I was going to approach St Mungo’s, but I wasn’t sure when I’d get the chance to test it.” He didn’t mention that Lee –ridiculously dedicated, slightly mad, or both – had offered to let him hex her so he could try the salve out. He’d shut that one down pretty quickly.

– and yet, up close, caught the solemn, unblinking assurance of Harry’s gaze, Draco found that those famous green eyes were actually peppered with hundreds of tiny flecks of gold. As Draco peered closer, transfixed, he noticed Harry’s brow furrow slightly, and he smiled in reassurance, quickly bringing his trembling hands up to cup Harry’s cheeks. Harry breathed a sigh of relief, his lips parting, and Draco leant in – finally,
better,” he said, winking at Harry, who was making a half-hearted attempt to cover himself with one hand. After a few seconds he laughed, gleeful, and held his arms out towards Draco.
“I know you’re probably wondering why I chose… not to…” He shook his head in frustration and inhaled deeply. “Why I chose this course of action, keeping everything a secret. For you. After all the lies.”
Draco smiled, fondly. “Oh, she’s good. She keeps me on the straight and narrow, trust me. Told me she’d cut my balls off if she even suspected me of using again. I don’t doubt it either.”
Draco was quite aware that this whole thing was ridiculous; who in their right mind would hire a Squib? But
Harry grabbed a handful of Floo powder, expression playful. “You know, I did wonder how you didn’t choke.”
rushing through his veins, he didn’t miss a single step. By the time the orchestra started playing the old pureblood cotillions, witches of all ages were fighting to start opposite him.
“How the hell did you get that from ‘it can’t happen’? I thought you were going to tell me to give up completely!”
getting unbearable. The only way he could see to avoid it was to load up on Firewhisky and Dreamless Sleep, and sleep the whole lot off. He’d wake up in the morning sober and go from there.
they’d done plenty of. Draco, still wary of Muggles and, well, anything he didn’t understand, had strongly protested when Harry had suggested buying a telly, moaning the whole way around John Lewis and refusing to help him carry the box. Within weeks, though, he had the TV guide memorised, and after that they spent many an evening on the sofa, Draco keeping up a running commentary over London’s Burning, or Heartbeat, or – his absolute favourite – Casualty. Each Saturday night they’d eat takeaway off their laps, trying to guess who’d get injured and how. Draco would sit up straight, eyes wide, laughing loudly at the Muggles and their primitive attempts at Healing. They’d dozed off together afterwards like that, countless times; Draco tactile as always, body curling instinctively around Harry’s.
“So romantic, Potter,” Draco scoffed, but a reluctant smile tugged at the edge of his mouth. He stood up, extending an arm to Harry, pulling him up and pressing another chaste kiss against his lips. He kept a tight grip on Harry’s hand as he tugged him away, around the hill and back out into the dark night. “Come on then. I fancy fish and chips, what d’you reckon?”
Though in hindsight, Draco realised, he probably should have considered that having an eagle-eyed teenager around him every day while he tried to hide the fact that he was illegally brewing and consuming large quantities of
something – anything, to try and escape this awful situation. But what could he do? What would a normal person do, someone without
“In the end, it was Ron who got me through. He sat right in the front row, told me that any time I felt like panicking, I should just ignore where I was and focus on him. I did, and I survived, and now every time I have to make a speech, or do something which makes me… well, uncomfortable, I always choose someone I know, someone encouraging, to concentrate on. Just in case. These days it’s easier for me, you know? Anyway, my point is, if you need to, you can just focus on me.” He coughed, awkwardly. “Or anyone, really. Lee. You could focus on Lee.”
Some things do change though: Scorpius comes of age in two months. Astoria will be gone soon, taking half your vaults with her, and your life will be your own once more. Finally, you’ll let yourself be happy. Finally, you’ll leave the past behind.
“I reckon you’re in luck,” whispered Ron out of the corner of his mouth, his forced grin slipping into an unsettling scowl as he looked over at Malfoy. “With that ridiculous hairstyle, he probably wouldn’t see the Snitch if it hit him on the nose.”
Another unexpected benefit of her presence was the way it seemed to reassure more sceptical members of the public of Draco’s amazing transformation from bigoted ex-Death Eater to generous champion of waifs and strays. This was helped along by – of all things – a Rita Skeeter article, which was saccharine to the point of queasiness, focussing heavily on Lee’s
