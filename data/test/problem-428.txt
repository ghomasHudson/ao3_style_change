“What you can do is make feeble attempts at your mission that you know will fail but will keep Voldemort thinking that you’re trying. Whatever than ‘until’ was in what you said about Dumbledore, that’s when you’ll next see Dumbledore right? When that moment comes, confide in him. Tell him what you’ve told me, and tell him that I trust you. He’ll take care of you, and your family — I promise.”
you survive —?” Harry started.
Draco turned around, looking terrified. Composing himself, he retorted, “Are you following me now, Potter? What could you possibly want to say that can’t be said in the open? Scared of my friends, are you?” He mocked.
— thinking of all the nasty things he wanted to do to Draco if he ever should forgive him.
around the house? — but it still brought him joy and sanity to imagine the look on Harry’s face when Draco kissed him, the eagerness with which Harry gave Draco head, how good it felt to finally embrace after spending an impossibly long couple of days apart.
Her jaw dropped. She saw Draco. “
Sure enough, Harry pulled off his invisibility cloak, his body shaking. “What the bloody hell was that?” He demanded. “How come Snape’s helping you? What are you up to that I don’t know about? What’s an Unbreakable Vow?” Draco had to admit, watching Harry’s chest heave for him like this was kind of touching.
Draco hesitated, but obligated. “Look, Harry, I know you’re trying to help, but you can’t. No one can help me.”
Sick of this exchange, which had been repeating itself in Harry’s head every day for the last several months, Harry screamed into his pillow.
Grateful that Harry didn’t mention it again, Draco ominously said, “Keep fucking me like you do, Harry, and I may surprise you. Crazy how much sex can do for one’s nerve.”
“Who’s there?” He asked, hastily zipping his pants and fixing his hair in the mirror. In the hall outside the restrooms, waiting for the girls’, was Katie Bell. Draco gulped. Now was as good a time as any.
at how he could make Harry feel.
Mustering an innocent-looking expression on his face, Harry responded lightly, “What d’you mean? Why shouldn’t I use his wand?”
“No, not now, stupid erection,” Harry uttered aloud, hoping that it would not be audible. He felt terribly guilty jerking off while the war was going on — to his
But Draco took his merry time. Slapping Harry’s buttcheeks with both hands, he rubbed his moist dick up and down Harry’s backside and pulled Harry’s hair. His hand slid to Harry’s front and stroked him, ever-so-lightly in the way that he knew Harry loved. Draco’s dick was throbbing now, he could not take it for much longer —
over the years. Even though they had spent glorious nights together, even though he
— holding back tears from his eyes. “You said...you said Ron deserved what he got. I thought...we were friends. I didn’t know...what the spell would do. I’m sorry, but also, you should be sorry too.” It seemed as though Potter had rehearsed these words, as he struggled to get them out.
“Please believe me,” Draco added desperately.
“Yes, but no thanks to you,” Harry glared. “Transferred to St Mungo’s.”
“Go back to your common room right now and take this,” Draco then spat at the terrified second-year before handing him a Nosebleed Nougat. “If anyone asks, the injuries are from me.”
“Or else?” Draco teased as his eyes darted between Harry’s legs. “Gonna punish me? I dare you.”
Draco went wild.
,” Ron huffed and puffed, panting heavily between each phrase.
?” Hermione whispered in Harry’s ear after their families joined together. The kids were busy catching up with their cousins while Ginny and Ron were deep in conversations. Harry didn’t know whether he imagined it, but he thought their faces screwed into intentionally absent-minded expressions.
Draco’s face hardened back to the loathing look Harry was far more used to. “We’d better get going.” He stood up to leave.
All those times of being trapped, alone, inside his musty and cramped cupboard under the stairs, he had always imagined how it was like to have someone beside him, holding him tight, keeping the nightmares away. The thought of having someone with him there was probably the only thing that got him through those dark times, continuously wishing that it were true.
It was then, belatedly, that he realized what was missing. It was Malfoy's usual snide remarks, a protest at being partnered with Harry on Potions or a jab on Harry's potion-making skills.
Harry sheepishly grinned, willing his own blush to go away. He stared up at Draco's eyes, they were alight and
Harry wanted to point the series of love marks, prominent even at the dim light of his lumos, on the side of his neck in retaliation but found that his need and curiosity to see Draco won over. He gathered his pillow and blanket before heading downstairs. Draco was sitting in one of the sofas in front of the fireplace. The flame giving off an ember glow to his face, making him look more ethereal and stunningly sharp. Harry stopped for a second to inhale the air that evaded his lungs before sitting down beside him.
"I want to be... a professional Quidditch player!" Ginny said enthusiastically. Harry snickered,
"You want to?" Draco narrowed his eyes, but his face flushed adorably.
“But,” Harry blurted, before he could help himself. “I tried. I went, um, flying yesterday.”
The Common Room was full, and it was pretty obvious that some of the eighth years had already started on their Potions project. They could see Parvati crying in the corner while Bulstrode was calming her down. Ernie Macmillan was enthusiastically jotting down notes as he interviewed an irate Anthony Goldstein. Hannah Abbott was talking about something excitedly while Terry Boot looked bored beside her.
Draco watched Harry’s face some more. He had removed his glasses earlier when Harry was starting to fall asleep, to avoid the painful indents of the frame on his skin. His lips were slightly parted, the tiniest bit of tongue poking out, drool starting to glisten at the side of his mouth. Draco chuckled, a sudden urge to plant a kiss on Harry’s forehead, just like what his mother used to do, overcame him. Though he reckoned it would be inappropriate, but that doesn’t mean he can’t brush his fingers softly through Harry’s messy hair and swept the overgrown bangs out of his eyes. Draco’s eyes travelled down to the faint dark spots dotting across Harry’s cheekbones and tip of his nose that Draco obsessively traced with his eyes earlier. They were barely seen, not like the freckles on Weasley’s face, but they were there, evidence of Harry’s hours under the sun.
"Is there any problem, Potter? I can feel your eyes on me the whole day," Draco stopped writing and put his quill down, though he still had his eyes cast on the table. "At least if you'd like to spy on me again, do it more subtly. It was very unambiguous even to someone with a mind of a troll."
"Forgive me my child, I only wanted to check on you—"
“Draco,” Harry called. Draco stopped pacing all together and turned to look at him, eyes wild and face a sickly pallid. For a moment he looked disoriented, but when his eyes moved to what Harry was holding, Draco’s face closed up.
“What makes you hesitant?”
Harry was suddenly back in sixth year again. Draco’s business was not his to know, Harry knew it. And the war was over, no Voldemort to force a sixteen-year-old to pay for his father’s failure, no Dumbledore to assassinate, no Vanishing Cabinet to fix. But Harry was helpless as the alarmingly familiar suspicion tugged at him, urging him to go find Draco and confront him because he was likely doing something that warrant investigation.
Potion—but each of them is of different variation," Severus dramatically paused, "while
At Hermione's curious eyes, Harry theatrically clears his throat and assumes a pretentious voice, "...
Draco had his back to him and he had no way in gauging Draco's expression. He wanted this to work out, without hurting Draco even more now that he's in a much vulnerable state, and Draco's amplified emotion doesn't help. The coloring of Draco's Augmentare Histrionicus had been magenta, and it technically suggested Emotional fluctuation, temperamental, impulsivity, instability. It was all familiar to Harry, he had some serious history with being unpredictable himself, and it was all the more reason to be wary and cautious. But the aggravating thing was, Harry knew for sure, Draco doesn't want others to treat him like he's going to break any moment.
The familiar snarky voice of his schoolboy rival snapped at his trance. Harry turned to see Draco Malfoy's sneering face, grey eyes sharp with his signature haughty condescension.
Draco pulled his arm back and put as much distance between him and Harry. The Gryffindor stared in confusion at Draco's scowling face.
“What am I doing here?” Draco growled lowly. “What are you doing here? Let me guess: are you afraid that I’m up to something again?” He stepped closer, looming over Harry. Harry tried not to show his guilt, but it was proving difficult as he can’t breathe with their sudden proximity, the kiss suddenly flashing in his mind. “What? You think I’m that stupid to make the same mistake of following orders’ from a madman, like my equally mad father? Or do something crazy like resurrecting Voldemort and gather his followers for a fucking new world order?”
Judging by the soft steps behind him, he was. And Harry internally growled in frustration.
"U-um, hey Ginny!" Harry greeted, a smile forcefully stretching his lips. Ginny frowned at him.
Harry angrily marched over the comfortable loveseat by the fire, who was currently occupied by Justin Finch-Fletchley.
Why was Malfoy being difficult?
Harry was bewildered with the whole affair. While it was clear that the Slytherins have a complicated way of expressing what little emotions they let themselves feel, it doesn't explain why the whole mausoleum during Lucius burial was stiflingly silent. All the funerals Harry had been to post-war were filled with grieving loved ones, weeping and sometimes telling stories in memories of the deceased. Lucius' entombment, however, was a stilted event. Even Narcissa didn't show anything other than the only time she pulled out a handkerchief to wipe at the side of her eye. Draco looked like he was a having a hard time sitting through the brief ceremony and short of wanting to depart all together. While Harry isn't cut out to judge their method of mourning, he couldn't help but feel that the fall and death of the head of the Malfoy household wasn't really a loss to his remaining family.
"What are you staring at?" Harry spat at the crowd, and Harry's red face was enough to scare them all away.
“Don’t be so selfish, Draco,” Pansy snickered, helping Ginevra up. She pulled the discarded jumper off the end of the bed and covered her indecency before turning to him fully. “We’re utilizing our available resources.”
Harry cursed out loud, gaping at Draco's retreating back.
[TW: this chapter contains past child abuse, neglect, emotional and physical abuse]
Harry nodded, albeit guiltily. Aside from waiting impatiently for the seventh book to be published, Harry's re-reading of the sixth book felt cathartic and therapeutic to him. It was no denying that the War of the Worlds in
"Do any of you has idea about this potion? No one?" Snape said silkily, the enthusiasm in his eyes prominent upon seeing the confusion on everyone's faces and not seeing Hermione's hand in the air. "Of course, you would not know this particular potion as this is not in your Advance Potions textbook... yet."
"Shut up!" Harry all but shouted. The four disputing people, and the sobbing Hermione, looked up to Harry all at once. Harry struggled to breathe, to
"I'm not!—" Harry looked up in time to see Malfoy walking out of the Great Hall. He immediately get to his feet and followed Malfoy out, missing the troubled looks on his best friends' faces.
"It's not too early for someone who wanted to pass with Outstanding marks," Draco quipped, sounding almost too close as he did before. Harry started, hearing it for the first time for a very long time. "I supposed you wouldn't understand. You don't need to pass your NEWTs, do you? The Golden Boy that you are."
Harry was close to shaving his hair off with his bare hands.
“I know, Granger.”
Harry stared back up. He didn’t dare move, trying so hard to put the earlier things out of his mind. But a wince had contorted his face no matter the effort of relaxing his muscles. Draco shot him a final look before shifting off the bed. In a moment of impulsivity, Harry reached out and curled his fingers around Draco’s lithe wrist. Draco stilled and stared back down at Harry.
"It's going to rain, it's probably best to get back inside," he said, hurriedly walking towards the direction of the castle without waiting for Malfoy to follow.
Predictably, it was.
Right. It was hardly Advance Potion. It was not too hard to see that he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Again.
Harry has no way of knowing since Draco was great at putting levels of façade. Even if he's starting to tell it's all a pretense, Harry couldn't see through the extent of his disguises. If what he saw in the blond's mesmerizing grey eyes was to be believed as the truth, then Harry, for the life of him, wanted to break down the barricades of Occlumency and see behind the inherent Malfoy mask.
Harry could only growl at the shocked students, powerless at the tone of Malfoy's voice when saying his first name.
Harry didn't pay enough attention to see Parkinson's sneer and Zabini's thoughtful look as the Slytherins left the Gryffindor dorm room, or Hermione and Ron's knowing and concerned stares. Harry fell back in his bed, mind detached, fingers still gripping the wet cloth.
"I'm really sorry if I worry both of you," Harry said contritely. "I really didn't mean it. I'm just... we all just came out of war and we still have individual scars we need to heal. I don't want to be... you know..." He sighed helplessly.
"Po—"
"It's okay, Harry," he said, holding Harry close to him. "Don't worry. We're not going inside the manor."
He couldn't help but to chance a look at Malfoy and his stomach tightened delightfully at the sight of Malfoy's flushed face.
Harry reconsidered his options. The Memoirs of Saturnine the Villain had been his chosen recreational activity ever since the start of the sessions. He had no problem with re-reading it. Dianne had even assigned him various essays and reaction papers regarding the series, and Harry had enjoyed writing them and viewing the whole story in a scholarly light. But Harry also wanted to do something else, though he didn’t know what.
But even the factitious illusion of denial would crumble down at the hands of Gryffindor curiosity. When Harry had pushed his arm through the disarray and higgledy-piggledy inside his trunk, the first object that he laid his palm on was the crumpled piece of parchment. It was the Marauders’ magical map of Hogwarts. Harry felt a tug of grief and sorrow at the object, remembering the fact that Prongs, Padfoot and Moony (he doesn’t really wanna think about the bloody rat) were all dead. He hadn’t touch this memorabilia since after the war. But the morose had been surmounted with curiosity and the familiar anticipation of seeing Draco on the map. Even if they were both inside the same tower, watching (see: spying) Draco’s dot on the map offer a sense of assurance and normality.
Snape's voice became soft for his next words, but the smug and pride on his tone were evident, "because this is a potion that I, on my own, devised. The two variations of the
“Close your eyes.”
But why couldn't Malfoy give it to him?
"Please, Weasley. Harry is on his potions—"
"Good morning mate," Ron said slowly. He stared at Harry. "You seem to be in a very good mood."
Harry not-so-gently slap Draco's stomach with the back of his hand. "That's not very nice of you, Draco. Don't be so obnoxious on my friend!" Harry tutted.
Harry curled his fingers around the heirloom, a silly sensation overlapping the cold disappointment for no apparent reason.
on it. Harry gently dabbed the wet cloth on the dried blood on Malfoy's nose and lips, careful not to hit Malfoy's broken nose as well as making a lot of effort not to look at Malfoy's wary eyes on his face.
The reason why Harry couldn't sleep later that night is not because of the nightmares but because of soft lips and golden skin and playful eyes. Harry smiled throughout the night.
He sighed wearily, weariness carving deep in the lines of his face. He eyed the soppy potion inside the corked tube, then looked at Malfoy, who was surprisingly looking at him with unguarded,
. Let us help you."
"Draco- no!"
It was a testament that Harry has yet to recover from his prejudices. And the past.
But the thing is, odd things had always happened where Harry is involved. When he found himself at the rooftop after being chased by Dudley and his gang; when he was suddenly at a tree after being hounded by Aunt Marge’s dog without remembering having to climb up the trunk; when he luckily got away from Voldemort and his Death Eaters at the graveyard. And in the grand scheme of things, courageously betraying one of his weaknesses to Draco Malfoy (of all people!) weighed no more than all the life-and-deaths and you’re-a-wizard-Harry’s and freakish connections with a dark lord.
"Your blatant staring is distracting, Potter," Draco suddenly said, though he still didn't look at Harry. "Can I assist you with something?"
"Lucius Malfoy is dead," Hermione said, staring down at the newspaper clutched in her hands. The Great Hall fell in a somber silence as they too were engrossed in the front page. "He was found unconscious in his cell last night. The resident Healer in Azkaban tried to revive him, but he was dead upon arriving at St Mungo's." Hermione frowned, her shocked expression marred with skepticism. "The autopsy report allegedly declared 'heart failure' as the cause of patient's death."
Harry didn't realize he was staring at Malfoy's pretty, long hands until they were lost inside his bag. Harry snapped out of his reverie and realized Malfoy had cleaned their area, and the two potions were already placed in separate corked glass vials.
is the discrepancy. This potion relies solely on emotions. And human emotions are subject to error; inconsistent,
Not technically difficult since he's not doing anything Malfoy-like. But that's the thing, Harry's world suddenly felt wrong when Malfoy is not being the snarky, snobbish, haughty, all-around awful elitist schoolboy rival that Harry's very much familiar with.
And Harry, strangely enough, is not afraid. Whether it be because he felt compelled under Draco's gentle eyes or it was indicative of something deeper that warrant introspection, Harry felt warm for the first time; not just physically, but it came down deep inside of him, under all the amplified sorrow and grief, a bubble of warmth surfaced. Draco's eyes were like a safe space, and he realize he could just feel whatever bloody emotions that were intensified by the potion, Harry knew, just by looking at Draco, that it's completely alright to feel them.
“Do you perhaps believe he can help you with overcoming your emotions?”
"Harry! I've been looking—" she stopped and gaped at Malfoy practically sprawled on Harry's lap. Then she frowned, "why is the Death Eater scum on your lap, Harry?"
"Not to sound arrogant, but you were the only person whom I can consider a challenge to fly with," Harry said. Draco's eyebrows arched in surprise. "It would be a pity if you lose your enthusiasm. You're such a good flier."
"You're so greedy," Draco giggled, he bloody giggled and Harry didn't know what to do with the sight. Harry made a frustrated sound and Draco laughed. He place a short kiss on Harry's lips before he stepped back. "Goodbye Potter. Don't think of me too much."
"Because it's... Malfoy?" Harry said, still not getting their point. "And we're under the influence of the potions. It doesn't mean anything."
Malfoy meekly nodded and Harry made a mistake of staring up at Malfoy's eyes. Harry found the blond's eyes so deep and mesmerizing, it was more silver than grey with the firelight from the candelabra reflecting off the glassy surface, with golden specks surrounding the slowly dilating pupil. Harry was confused why he doesn't want to look away, or why he felt being drawn to the eyes that only looked at him with malice and disdain in the past.
The weather was perfect for a Seeker's game. Harry's hair was whipping about in the wind as he soared. His heart throbbed in his chest, the adrenaline at being high up in the air spiking enthusiasm that thrummed through him. He grinned, the air chilly and sharp on his lungs.
"It was our Potions project, Weasley," Malfoy calmly said, though the grip he had on the side of the loveseat was tight. Harry didn't know Malfoy was capable to feel anger under the Sedatus potion but Harry was too angry to comprehend it. "We were partnered and his emotions were amplified—"
"Do you think something's wrong with Malfoy?" Harry mused, unintentionally voicing what should've stayed in his mind.
Draco turned to face Harry, his grey eyes sparkling with tears, "Dobby was always going on about how you were so brave, that Harry Potter was a noble hero and that the elves knew of his kind and courageous heart. Dobby knew what father planned and he wanted to warn you about it. But I didn't listen because I could care less about you, though I wanted the creature to do what he wanted. But that only led him to be freed! As selfish as that sound I don't want to lose him. I was so fucking angry at you when you made my father gave him a sock, Harry. Dobby was the only person in the entire world who doesn't expect anything of me and I just... lost him."
The chosen recreational activity for each student is proposed for their assigned Mind Healer. Since it supposed to change every month, they are to record any changes they felt, whether physically, mentally and emotionally, while performing their chosen activity.
Harry had been too focused on the slightly moving dot on the map to fling a pillow at his smarmy best friend.
Harry had not cried this many tears before. Not when Cedric died before him, not when Sirius fell into the veil. He thought he couldn’t cry any longer, but to his embarrassment, he couldn’t stop the grief that settled heavily into his chest at the sight of his parents names inscribed on their gravestone. Draco had stood a few feet behind him to give him some privacy but near enough to hear the dry sob that wreaked out of him. It had echoed across the silent graveyard anyway.
look away, the door to their dorm banged open. The newcomers were met with the sight of Harry with his wand in his right hand and the wet cloth on the other. It was obvious that Parkinson mistook this as an attack before Harry could even hear her shrilly voice.
"Why are you here?" Harry asked, wincing when his voice came out squeaky. Draco stared at him, vacantly.
Harry had no time to react, and to wonder when the fuck did his friends' preference had swing the other way, as both the naked boys scrambled to get their clothes and bolt out of the room. The slamming of the door resounded through the silent eighth year Gryffindor boys' dorm.
"I'm sorry, Gin," Harry cut her off, feeling awful at the look on her face. "We'll be busy with our potion. Maybe next time."
"Potter? Are you alright?"
"What do you reckon the slimy git has for us this time?" Ron asked as the three of them walked to the cold Dungeon corridors.
“Snape...Snape did kill Dumbledore,” Harry responded. “Draco only disarmed him. He wouldn’t have done it...He was lowering his wand.”
Draco, understandably, looked skeptical.
There was also the matter that Harry now possessed Draco’s wand. The idea of holding an object of Draco’s would’ve driven Harry wild with lust just a week prior. But now, Harry could not feel much but solemnity. He could not believe that Dobby had died, died to give Harry and his friends their lives...the elf had been such a loyal and good friend…
Returning back to Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and the children, Harry couldn’t help but notice a new spring in his step.
The sneer on Draco’s face and sudden reintroduction of Harry’s last name caused his insides to roar.
Harry thought frustratedly.
Harry was getting fed up at Draco not talking to him. He thought, after three months of being together nearly every night — his insides would squirm when Draco would say “Can’t tomorrow, day after” — that Draco would loosen up.
Then, realization dawned. Malfoy was supposed to kill someone. Not curse them, not capture them and hand them to Voldemort, kill them. He obviously had not tried very hard, as he’d promised Harry, but his slip-ups...his mistakes...
Draco stepped back.
Harry’s familiar gasp under his touch made Draco shiver. “Ugh, Draco, you have no idea...ah...how long I’ve been...
Draco looked at Harry with a glint in his eyes, his dick throbbing.
But the moment was short-lived.
With a look that made Harry weak in the knees, Draco nodded curtly and left without another word. Harry ignored the pulsing going through his body as he turned around to face his friends.
“Potter, you’re a real idiot you know,” Draco finally broke the seemingly eternal silence.
The two made eye contact for no more than a split second when Draco turned away and, again, got dressed at lightning speed. And, again, his whole demeanor changed, settling back into the cool meanness that characterized Draco Malfoy.
The Slytherins around him laughed. With one look at Harry’s face, Draco changed course.
“Er, yeah, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t spread it around, thanks,” Draco replied, clearly relaxed. “Are you seeing anyone else then?”
,” Harry struggled to regain himself.
, he added in his mind. No matter what Dumbledore or Harry might think, Draco knew the truth — that Snape was working for Voldemort and would stop at nothing to help Draco complete his mission.
Sighing, Draco obliged.
The color in Draco’s face disappeared. “No...” he began. “No. She wasn’t supposed to touch it. She was supposed to just give it to him. He would’ve known. He wouldn’t have touched it.” Draco seemed panicked now. “Is she...is she alive?”
Harry turned from Ron to Hermionen, saw Hermione’s expression, then glanced between his two friends once more. Gulping, he answered Hermione’s look with a curt nod.
“It’s just...Well, are you sure you want to be using
There is no question that Draco Malfoy had never hated anyone like he hated Harry Potter. Equally true was that he’d never tasted anything better. As he got to know Harry through snippets of conversations he sometimes allowed himself to have, he grappled with his increasingly confused feelings. Harry brought out the deepest of his insecurities and jealousies, but at the same time making him want to be valiant and bold — and believing that he could.
— he tried to calm himself, to no avail —
The One and Only Harry Potter could hardly believe his eyes.
“Okay then...if you don’t care to elaborate, let’s go,” Harry replied, still skeptical.
“Oh, snap out of it, Potter,” Draco continued. “Are you taking Granger?”
“Malfoy, er...” Harry continued, reveling in the taste of his lover’s name on his tongue and trying his hardest to quash his erection. He had just had the most orgasm in his life ramming Draco against the outside of the vanishing cabinet with his hands tied up in some rope they had found lying around. Concentrating with all his might on Ron’s Aunt Muriel, Harry forced himself to continue. “Malfoy’s been given a mission by Voldemort, sir, I’m sure of it. And it involves you.”
spot — but it’s a solo life for me. Probably will have to enter an arranged marriage, though, if I survive the year.” He tried so hard to sound matter-of-fact.
“The air’s nice today, isn’t it Harry? Maybe we can go for a stroll when we’re done,” Draco suggested one evening.
In a magnificent swoop, Draco felt himself grabbed by Harry’s big, strong hands, onto a broomstick behind Harry’s back. Knowing it would be the last chance he’d get, Draco held tightly to Harry’s waist and buried his face into Harry’s neck — soaking in every crevice as though they were the only things that existed in the world.
But it was too late. The others had joined him, and Snape — Snape had gone and done it. And he, Draco, could do nothing but watch...watch as the greatest wizard in history fell from grace, as the other Draco — the
“Some of us,” Draco grinned, with a glance to Harry’s crotch. “Are gonna have to wait til tomorrow.” He winked.
“Don’t,” Harry gulped. He couldn’t take it. This shared ability is what led Dumbledore to...to… “Let’s just go.”
“Expelliarmus!” Harry heard suddenly, as his body became immobilized and he couldn’t believe his eyes —
But he would be with Harry. If not physically, then at least in their hearts, on the same side of the war...and, Harry would
“Wait wait wait,” Draco shushed him as he edged his body closer and closer so that Harry could feel his breath on his face. “Didn’t you hear me say
Romilda could’ve done to make me never want to go for her, Harry thought, it was this. As much as Draco had his faults, he would
house?! He felt as though he were coming alive for the first time in years.
Making sure to bump into Harry on his way to the bathroom — “Ouch, watch it!” said Harry, but Draco knew it made him fire up — Draco continued on with his task. Filled with desire at the effect of his touch on Harry —
“Three orgasms within the span of a few hours, goddammit Malfoy,” Harry looked incredulously at Draco, who looked absolutely amazed at this accomplishment.
“It’s just that…” Harry continued, pushing his nerve beyond his limits. “Er...I mean... could help you...you know, if you’d like,” Harry added sheepishly.
The way Draco was talking about his death so absentmindedly made Harry furious. His gloating face reminded Harry of all the taunts he had had to endure from
Harry didn't wonder why he dreamed of Voldemort last night. Or why the green light of the Avada Kedavra curse had pricked his eyelids even after waking up.
Harry was almost by the door when he looked back and saw that Malfoy was still standing in his spot, still. Harry frowned.
“Scoot over.”
Draco's face fell and his eyes lost its spark, now guarded and cold. Harry inwardly cursed, thinking he had fucked it up.
"Harry, mate? Are you awake?" It sounded like Neville's voice. Harry stood up and rubbed his eyes before perching his glasses atop his nose.
"The rest of the Houses hated Slytherins even more after the war! They were pariahs not only in Hogwarts but the whole of the Wizarding world. They weren't given a chance before the war, they were segregated! Even if they were awful and bullies, but it was not enough to cast them away that they felt like they had no choice but to be Death Eaters because the Light weren't so acceptable. You were the leader of the Light, the Hogwarts Headmaster and you have all the power to accept and convince them. But no, it was your prejudices that set the Slytherins apart. And you expect that this crazy idea would somehow mend that problem, wouldn't it?"
potion for your term project," Snape drawled, flicking his wand at the board as the ingredients and processes materialized.
, until he was jerked awake when the dank and claustrophobically narrow space of his cupboard or the piercing green of the Killing curse assaulted his senses. There was nothing to do than to lay in his bed, his listless body morosely longing for even just minutes of sleep that his high-strung, restless mind was too selfish to give. Harry climb out of bed with his muscles tauten and his sense of sight violated with the floating sparkles in the air that he was sure everyone but him wasn't aware of.
By the end of Defense, Harry was reeling with adrenaline after he partnered with Ron. They were practicing with some advance defensive and offensive spells. When Ron had him slipping down on his butt after he had been distracted with the speck of blond-head moving in and out of his periphery for the better part of their dueling, Harry tried to put his mind on the task at hand (that is, wiping the knowing, conspiratorial grin on Ron's face that suggested he perfectly knew what Harry'd been thinking of) with a single-minded intent. He was enjoying it so much, the practical lessons in DADA, all the friendly competitiveness and thrill of duels, that Harry forgot what had occupied his mind for most of the day. Professor Bentham dismissed the eighth years, and Harry and his friends just rounded the corner on the way to the eighth year tower when he saw the blond excusing himself from his friends and going straight to the direction of the library. Harry didn't know why he did the same to his friends. Excuse himself that is.
"My father... had damaged me in more ways I could imagine," he whispered, shoulders hunching as he hugged his knees even closer. "I didn't even knew if he loved me as his son or I was always just the heir, an asset that could serve useful when he saw fit. And being his showpiece proved to be more poignant as there wasn't a single time in my whole life where I was enough for him. I strived so hard to be just like the son he wanted, to be just like him—the perfect, quintessence of a Malfoy. I saw how he commanded the crowd, how polished he was under any circumstances, how adept he was at maneuvering the sociopolitical circles in the Pureblood society. He was a master of emotions, even so much better at emotional manipulation. He was the person that I wanted to become, but in the end, I became the worst parts of him.
Though Draco kept his composure, his heart throbbed when he heard Snape tell the Dark Lord when Harry would be moved.
Draco looked like he was in tears. “Harry, please, listen to me. I don’t have much time. I didn’t mean for that to happen, for Dumbledore to...I swear I wouldn’t have done it.”
“Oh...er...got held back on the train. You know,” he took another gulp. “Fight with Malfoy.”
they had managed to pull it off, Harry had no idea.
could he have been so careless? Draco begged himself. He had been there every day at seven on the dot, hoping — uselessly — to see Harry walk through the door.
Harry punched himself internally.
“HARRY!” Hermione shouted as she came out of the common room, looking taken aback to see Harry engulfed in snogging. “I would’ve thought...after...oh,
Ron had nearly died.
“Can, er, can
— he thought —
Collecting himself, Harry stood up abruptly. He knew what had to be done.
“Look Potter,” Draco finally responded, his gaze firmly intact. “Harry.” He softened, his voice daring him to go on. “There are certain things even the Chosen One wouldn’t be able to handle.”
Harry's groin roared again.
Sure enough, Draco had very nearly completed his mission.
“No problem, and same to you obviously,” Harry said. “I’m not, but I think I might be starting to have feelings for...Well, nevermind, it doesn’t matter.”
Harry was in the middle of a mind-numbingly dumb conversation with McLaggen, replaying scenes from earlier and begging for release, when he heard the noise. Filch burst into the room holding onto the cuff of —
“Oh my Goood,” Draco yelled, his eyes rolling over.
Draco broke. With a swift motion, he pulled Harry by the robes and embraced him in a long, hard kiss. His body thrashed in desire as he let his hands roam freely around Harry’s face, hair, and chest.
Meanwhile, Draco kept his ears perked up at any news of Harry. He knew he couldn’t do anything about it if Harry had been caught, but he was still dying to know what was going on. Death Eaters often came in and out of Malfoy Manor conveying filthy pieces of news about the various wrongdoings they’d committed. Once or twice, Draco even heard about his classmates’ entire families being murdered.
“Anyone else? Who I’m fucking, you mean? You think I’d take all my lovers to the same place?” Draco smirked. “C’mere.” His expression softened.
“Draco…” Harry interrupted with difficulty, between groans. “I want you to know that there’s absolutely fucking nothing I’d rather be doing right now.” He panted and caught his breath.
“I mean, Ron and Hermione know I’ve been seeing — well, hooking up with — someone. But I didn’t think you’d want anyone to know the details.” Harry was quite honestly not sure where this was going.
he could be doing that’s more important, Harry didn’t know — Harry was so full of desire and frustration at not knowing what was on his lover’s mind that he had to take some time to himself. He glared at Draco on his way out of the classroom, who glared back without hesitation, and headed straight for Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, hoping beyond hope that she wouldn’t be there.

Gasps around the tables - as well as a few stifled gagging noises Harry was more than sure came from his friends - nearly drowned out Draco’s hiss, “Unhand me right now,

the eyes move off him and back to Draco even as he, himself, turned around as well.
Harry took off from the table, reveling in the terrified look that crossed Draco’s face for the briefest of moments as he chased the man a few yards before he fell back on anger when Harry grabbed him by his robes and fought him, red faced, into Harry’s arms, “Just what in Merlin’s name do you think you’re

, do you? He still let the Death Eaters into the castle.”
But Harry was at a loss for words.
Aunt Bella was less than happy with Draco, and she would not so much as glance at him all summer, but Draco assumed his mother had some leverage holding her sister’s tongue...something about Gringotts…
Of course, Hermione didn’t know just how right she was. Harry was quickly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy.
“No,” Harry began, slowly realizing what he had done. “NO!”
Draco….and he was looking
Fueled by the combination of anger and desire Harry had become used to, his strokes quickened.
“Fine. FINE,” Draco screamed, annoyance etching into every corner of his voice convincingly. “I suppose Potter

— for what was about to happen to Hermione.
“Why haven’t we been doing
“I do understand,” Harry responded kindly, his chest swelling. “I understand what it’s like to have the world expected of you when you just want to live your life like a normal teenanger. To have everyone you’ve ever loved be in constant danger and feel like it’s your fault. To be so alone you can’t even confide in your closest friends. To have a task ahead that’s so great, so important that…”
“Romilda, of course, Romilda Vane,” Ron had purringly told him that morning in a disgustingly sweet voice almost unrecognizable as his own.
Harry was still speechless from the unbelievable banging he had just experienced. For a moment, it seemed that all had returned to normal.
“Er, no idea,” Draco responded absentmindedly. He only cared that Harry had actually believed him.“The song’s got a point though.” He winked.
Harry looked at her imploringly, hoping she would understand without him saying a word. Instead, Harry muttered “I’m fine” before storming off to check the Marauder’s Map again. He was now looking at it every day at dinner — around the time he and Draco used to meet — in addition to before he went to bed. He had been satisfied to see that Draco had not been on the map at seven o’clock every day this week, since it meant that Draco had been desperately waiting for him in the Room. The thought gave Harry a jolting feeling.
Mustering all of his courage, Draco turned to Harry and said, “I mean it, Potter. Get out of my way. Weasley deserved what he got. You can’t help me.”
Draco hesitated, then decided he didn’t have much to lose anymore. “I had a plan which had to be kept secret, but it’s been compromised. I’m trying my best to fix it, but I don’t know if I can.” He tried to be firm, yet vague. “I’m in too deep,” he added dramatically.
“I’m so attracted to you right now,” Draco purred, pulling Harry’s head down to meet his lips. A now familiar tingling sensation ran down his body as the lovers met. “Luckily, your dick is right here,” Draco said as he moved to unzip Harry’s pants once more.
In that moment, Draco shed all else in Harry’s mind and was, once again, solely an enemy. It was as though the past several months had never happened, and they were now battling out the fight they should’ve — would’ve — had on the Hogwarts Express.
Draco smirked. Even in his fantasies, he maintained the slightest bit of snide and jealousy towards Harry. This, of course, only added to the attraction.
, but I don’t want you to fucking
“It would’ve helped me sleep better,” Harry had his answer ready.
he thought.
Harry thought as he felt a rush of affection towards his wife.
Returning Harry’s grin with a look of understanding, Ginny took their kids through to the platform. Harry followed, feeling like the luckiest man in the world. Little did he know...
Harry swallowed. Draco’s eyes had never looked more clear. “I believe you, Draco, and I wish things were different. But you must know that I can’t...we can’t...we could never—”
“That day at the battle, I stayed behind after we...y’know...to help you fight...I couldn’t leave you. Crabbe and Goyle assumed I was trying to catch you, and they saw you go into the Room. I didn’t tell them…” Draco trailed off. Repeating this memory was so painful that he needed a moment.
“But I’m touched,” Draco continued before he lost his nerve, not even sure himself how sarcastic he was being. “Since when do you actually care about my safety? I thought we were just fucking.”
...thinking about this,” Harry managed to say between gasps and moans. “But...
Harry gulped. Draco
, he laughed to himself, then realized that the situation was in no way laughable.
“Er...I just noticed, that, er, you weren’t in class,” Harry replied pathetically. “What are you doing here? Is there...Is anyone else here?”
“Look, you don’t have to tell me what you’re doing,” Harry continued, his voice gaining confidence. “But let me help you. I’ll help you in ways he won’t find out,” Harry added before Draco could protest.
“Harry, I will not ask you how you know this information,” Dumbledore responded kindly, his face not giving away whether he already knew — though Harry had an inkling that he did. “But I assure you that Professor Snape is handling it.”
"Counterproductive?" Severus silkily said, his lips slightly curling. "Of course you would thought it that way. But if you stop to think for a moment," he drawled, narrowed dark eyes sweeping over the long table of warily skeptical faces of the Hogwarts teaching staff, "this would be advantageous to the 'House cooperation' cause."
Draco's grin softened into a delicate smile, upper teeth biting the side of his lips. "I thought I could never ride a broom again," he whispered, eyes casting downward, "you know, the fiendfyre and all."
"Can't you stop staring at that slimy ferret for one second?" She scowled, her face almost as red as her flaming red hair.
were, obviously, just Saturnine's compiled memoirs from his ancient diary. He was the greatest tyrant in the fictional universe of
Draco raised his head, two lovely pink spots high on his cheeks, as he pecked Harry on the lips before snuggling against Harry's neck.
His body jerked to awareness once more. He suddenly felt wrong-footed, used to weeks of sleeplessness and nightmares that a night went smoothly had left him slightly feeling discomfited. It was not unlike the strange feeling during the mornings just after the war brought on by the hunt for horcruxes; the vestiges of adrenaline, constant vigilance and the thought of guard duty for the night stirred him up only to remember he was safely tucked in his bed in Grimmauld Place.
"It's okay if you don't prefer to begin right now. I understand," Malfoy told him. "Maybe we can lay over it until—"
emotions? Snape must be looking forward to either of them blowing their cauldrons or blasting their heads off.
. He still wanted to defend Malfoy, still stuck literally beside him, still wanted to please him. But everytime he tried touching the blond, comfort him, Harry was brought back to the picnic by the lake, words rotating in his mind like a limbo, he felt like a rubber band stretched to its capacity; straining him until the point of wanting to explode.
Instead of feeling insulted, excitement thrummed through Harry, feeling like fourteen again. "I don't know, Malfoy, but I think the weather's lovely today. Fancy a fly in the pitch?"
Potter huffed and let go of Draco's body, thankfully, but the fondness in his face became apparent and unequivocal, much to Draco's chagrin.
"Um. Of course not, but Hallo—" Ron grunted when Hermione elbowed him in the ribs. "Er. How's last ni—"
Harry fell silent, unable to think of a coherent reply. If he were here two years ago and hear the same question, he would’ve laughed at her face and probably thrown the nearest object in incredulity. But then there was too much that had shifted between them and around them and within them. The war had taught them a lot of lessons, among them are forgiveness and second chances. Harry was in no way justifying Draco’s actions before. Draco was a bully and a bigot, had denigrated Hermione’s blood status and mocked the Weasleys’ financial state. But part of mental maturity was realizing Draco Malfoy was just as victim as everyone else. It was unfortunate of him to grow up in a very unfortunate circumstances. Being a bully, a bigot and a Death Eater were all he really knew, were all what had been taught to him. There had been no other choices for him, just as Harry had no other options as the bloody Chosen One.
Draco had tormented Harry and his friends for years, but Draco had also been there for him when he needed comfort, baring himself as much as Harry did. And, Harry realized with a staggering force, Draco helped him in ways no one did and no one would ever be able to.
She stared at the black lake, watching a tentacle rippling the surface of the peaceful water, eyes glassy. "Of course everyone was wary of Slytherins that time. There was no way of knowing her intentions so I was initially suspicious, and just like the stupid Gryffindor that I was, I called her all sorts of names. But she stayed, somehow knowing where I've gone to, bringing hot chocolates every time. Until..." Ginny sighed once more. "We almost got caught by one of the Carrows. She... she told me to stay hidden behind one of the tapestry and presented herself. She was

"I'm surprise you even knew gentleness in the first place, Potter, since you have a grace and subtlety of a mountain troll," Draco spat, but he conceded.
needed Draco Malfoy's sneers, jeers of contempt, condescending grey eyes, and his awful mouth sputtering his usual awful tirades. Because those were
“As I said, a theory. About the Histrionicus Potion,” Pansy went on sternly, glaring defiantly. “Blaise and Granger are correct in some ways. While there are certainly issues of non-consent, it is not entirely enslavement, per se. Well, not to certain mutualistic standings, anyway.”
There had been no time to grieve because of the war. And after all had been said and done, he still can't.
Though this was easier for him if Malfoy put up with some of their past animosity, sneering nastily and being the caustic, irreverent prat the way he had been under the amplifying potion. But the unusual vulnerability in Malfoy's ocean eyes was enough for Harry to let the ire go. It was all the more hard and exhausting to force out the anger at the memory of the blond's cutting words when Malfoy looked so depreciating before him.
Malfoy gently tutted, "it couldn't be that bad, Potter."
“I said scoot over, Harry,” Draco repeated, his voice a soft lilt in the ringing silence of the dorm room. Harry’s throat worked up, staring at Draco before he shifted to give Draco space.
Draco raised his brows, “heard of it. It doesn’t have any proof, so I don’t have any reasons to believe.” He shrugged. Harry looked at him solemnly.
"Hear hear, Draco," Potter said in a pleasant tone. "Don't be nasty to me. I'm here to 'mediate' you, remember?" Potter placed both his hands on Draco's shoulders. He had a mock pout on his lips that had Draco bristling. "What would happen if you don't have me? I know you value your pride so much, it would not be good to continue embarrassing yourself. You should stop treating me nastily, or else..." Potter added in a faux threatening tone, that to Draco sounded ridiculous coming from his righteous mouth.
Days leading up to Halloween, however, Draco observed Harry’s healthy tan taking on a sickly pallid; sunken purplish dents resided under his eyes and his pale skin stretched taut and thin across his face, making his cheekbones jut out highly. He was lagging on schoolworks, and even Granger and Weasley can’t do anything about Harry’s state of sudden withdrawal even if, Draco had seen, how much they wanted to encourage Harry out of it.
"I couldn't quite imagine having this heart to heart talk in the middle of breakfast," Harry said, his best friends grinned with him. Hermione ended the charm, signaling the end of the conversation. Though he's got a feeling that it was only the end of the heavy bit. "I can't believe myself by saying this, but it needs to be said. I believed that Snape's Histrionicus potion has somehow done more good than we care to admit."
“What?! Who told you to—”
A prophesied hero, a demigod of the lowest kind, Warden the Illustrious, came to destroy Saturnine's pursuits of reigning over the universe. But during the fateful face-off, there was a red string of fate that connected his heart to Warden, which the Illustrious had cut off mercilessly. Since then, Saturnine forgot his plans to take over Nirvana and pursue the hard-hearted Warden instead, which the hero always turn down. Hence, the morose poetry.
normal position.
He was dangling at the edge of consciousness when he heard a soft, tentative voice calling his name from across the room. He blinked his eyes open, and in the dark, he saw a big blob of blur by one of the beds.
The mediating potion, on the other hand, was like being in a blissful and satisfying giddy rush. Harry intermittently felt like bounding through walls and floating on cloud nine; a confectionery tang bursting on his palate. While he seemed to have some power over Draco, there was an incessant dull tug—a helpless urge—inside him that propelled him to cater to Draco's whim.
"What are you talking about?" Harry asked. "You're not upset that I brought him there, instead of you two?"
"Do you want to talk about it?" Harry whispered. Draco's face shut off and his eyes became distant, so Harry hurried to add, "you don't have to if you don't want. I just want you to know that it doesn't do good to keep it in, and I'm here if you want someone to listen." Harry remembered Halloween, when it was his turn to drink the Augmentare, the feeling of being free of the onerous weight of guilt and grief after he allowed himself to cry and feel about it. Draco seemed to think the same.
Potter who has his arms around Draco's torso, green eyes behind that hideous glasses staring up at him earnestly and with a cringeworthy amount of fondness. His ridiculously unguarded green eyes had Draco's resentment ebbing away.
Harry was just starting to doze when a knock on the door resounded through the dorm room. He glared at the door, wondering who in their right minds to knock after years of seeing each other naked and walking in on a hand under their pants.
"And he brought me to Godric's Hollow. To visit my parents," he said slowly, waiting for the stern frowns and gaping mouths. Hermione and Ron looked at each other before she looked at Harry with a warm smile. Even Ron stared at him with intrigue, a small keen smirk tugging his lips. Harry stared at them in confusion.
. Harry found himself unable to look away at the blond's calf and ankle and the knobbly toes with perfectly shaped nails.
Right now, by the grace of their Potions project, Harry had the privilege to closely expect the extent of the changes in Malfoy's suddenly subdued behavior.
; both the potion will work efficiently with the aid of the other."
Harry shoved her in turn, forgetting that she has a lither form than Ron. She almost toppled over. "Why does everybody think I fancy that pointy git! That's just ridiculous."
Harry's childhood was fucked up; he had Voldemort and his wretched relatives (and if he was really being honest, Dumbledore) to thank for that. He had years of constantly biting his tongue to the point of bleeding when being told the infamous nicknames he had as a child, holding back the whimpers of pain after a fateful day with Dudley and his crew, holding back the screams of terror after a nightmare.
At the joined common room of the eighth years, Hermione sat in one of the couches with a book in her lap. When she saw them walking to her, she met them halfway and flung herself to Harry before planting a chaste kiss on Ron's cheek.
Malfoy, on the contrary, was calm and gentle. When he drank the potion, his empty eyes and dull expression were replaced with mildness, and he even have a serene smile on his face, much to Harry's indignation. He was becoming more and more vexed at Malfoy's gentle approach, Harry had repeatedly snapped at him but the Slytherin stayed collected at the face of Harry's unhinged behavior. He didn't know if this mild Malfoy is worse than emotionless Malfoy.
"But he isn't the whole Ministry," Ron shrugged. "The Ministry's been rotten to the core. It's not surprising if one of them is behind this vigilantism for some funny sense of justice when most of Death Eaters were already rounded up in Azkaban."
There was a chorus of snickers and catcalls throughout the room. Harry was reminded of the scene last Friday night, Nott going down on Neville. He snorted at the identical flustered looks on the pair's faces.
She stood up and left his room.
Draco turned and asked the Room of Requirements for a closet full of robes befitting for the gloomy occasion as Harry sighed, resigning to a stilted and awkward afternoon.
) instead of his usual grouching and went as far as to work on his own essays without her behests.
“Do you want to find Harry or what?” Granger asked just as crossly. The Weasel interrupted.
So no! I don't see why you should check on me now that I can very well take care of myself. So please, stop pretending that you care."
“Oh my fucking god do NOT stop you fucking FUCK!!!” Harry screamed loudly as he collapsed into a heap of pillows. Seeing his beautiful conquest before him, Draco quickly followed.
In a tender act, Harry took Draco’s head and placed it on his own shoulder, stroking his head as he did so.
Hoping and praying that it wasn’t Ron, Hermione, Ginny, —
“Er...yes, sir,” Harry replied. Building up his own courage, he continued, “Sir, I have something to tell you. About Malfoy.”
, a voice in Harry’s head echoed and clutched to these words. That’s why I haven’t stopped thinking about him all summer, why I followed him down Knockturn Alley and panicked when I lost sight of him, why I’m still here talking to him...to thwart his no-doubt evil plans, as I’ve always done.
“Tell us what?” Crabbe replied.
Harry took it as a game of hide and seek. “You know I’m furious at you beyond belief...but you also know that I can’t resist for too long. And nor can you,” he smirked.
Draco, the Draco who was funny, sexy, and unabashedly himself with Harry — fell with him.
“Hermione, look, I can explain,” Harry started, looking at his friend’s disapproving face. “We were hooking up, yes, but it’s over now. I was right. He was up to something. Voldemort wanted him to kill Dumbledore. He…”
Harry Potter? Help me?” He sputtered. “What a laughable idea. How could you possibly understand?”
Harry’s eyes seemed to be saying, but the rest of his face was expressionless. Almost instinctively, Draco glanced furtively at Harry’s dick, which was indeed bulging. Draco turned away quickly, as he couldn't help but feel happy with himself despite the circumstances.
Draco was growing desperate now. He had not realized how much he needed Harry. Surely, he had other lovers who could fulfill his desires...but none of them were like Potter. None of them cared. He thought this particular fuckbuddy situation was so hot because it was forbidden. He had not realized that Potter would become his friend.
Ron raised his eyebrows. “Remembered us, have you?” He retorted. “After not so much as a thank-you card for saving your goddamn life.”
“Potter, your potion looks like it came from a puking pastille. You know Weasel products are banned, right?” Draco spat at Harry, with a convincingly disgusted look on his face.
He thought desperately.
“Malfoy…” Harry started cautiously. “What is it exactly that your mother can’t help you with?”
“Couldn’t have put that in an owl, could you?” Harry retorted, his anger making the best of him.
Draco grimaced. “Remember what I said to Wormtail,” he whispered before turning away.
The fact that Harry Potter was sneaking around nearly every night to meet a secret lover became news soon enough. Harry had been expecting this to come up, and probably earlier, at that — he was, after all, the
Draco hesitated. Looking at the blazened expression on his oldest rival’s face, he felt a flutter below. He was suddenly filled with a deep desire to grab Harry. Did he dare?
tried to lower his wand...
“I know...I know he did, and I’ll never forgive him. He made his choice. It’s got to be over between us,” Harry’s heart sunk. Hearing Hermione say it confirmed what he already knew.
Truthfully, his nights with Harry had been the only thing keeping Draco from crying himself to sleep. He grew increasingly distant from his friends, not able to confide in them, and was filled with nothing but dread for what lie ahead.
As he saw Harry’s eyes widen and heard his moans deepen, Draco quickened his pace — coordinating his mouth and hand so that their motions collided.
Obviously Harry couldn’t have expected Draco to have up-and-joined the resistance. Yet, he did feel an unmistakable twinge of disappointment that Draco was not among those greeting him.
, he was caught, he thought.
“Is that...Is that
Draco made sure that Harry had seen him strut towards the Great Hall before swerving back.
Harry was stunned by the level of maturity Draco was displaying. “Me too,” he replied. “I mean it. I’ll never forget this year, you know.”
“He caught me eavesdropping on his conversation with the Slytherins. Saw my foot slip from the cloak.” He gave them a knowing look.
he made himself think as he watched Harry get dragged into the dungeon downstairs.
’Course I am, you dickhead,” Draco scowled. “You think I saved your life just so I could suck your dick? Cocky as always, Potter.” His tone was so reminiscent of their childhood that Harry couldn’t help but smile. “Though that, of course, is an added benefit,” Draco’s face softened as he leaned in for a kiss.
“Harry, you don’t understand, I…” Draco started, looking hurt.
“What a prat,” Ron was quick to respond. “What happened this time?”
“You can try,” Harry played back as a grin spread across his face.
Chaos ensued. Jinxes flew left and right, bouncing up and down and off the Room’s many treasures. Hermione screamed, Ron was nearly hit by Goyle’s killing curse, Harry himself swerved many times to avoid the attacks, and...and then there was fire.
He was sitting with Ron and Hermione in the common room, attempting to finish his Transfiguration essay, when Hermione interrupted his reliving of a particularly fond time a few days ago. Draco was clutching onto Harry’s hair, leaned over on a pile of books, his face scrunched up in that adorable expression he made whenever he neared climax  —
“I’ll catch up with you guys later,” he told his friends. “Think Potter is looking for a sequel to our little train adventure,” he smirked. The others patted his back, nodded their encouragement, and left obediently.
Wondering what Draco was up to now —
Realizing that
Hermione’s expression softened somewhat, but she still looked skeptical. “Harry, of course I support whomever you want to snog or sleep with, but you don’t think Draco’s really
“You what?” Draco retorted, returning Harry’s piercing look with an equally devouring stare.
The lovers embraced. Draco pushed Harry with the full force of his body against the wall, his hands roaming freely, desperately, taking in every tiny touch so as to savor it. Never mind that they were in mortal danger, that the Dark Lord had probably been summoned, that Harry no doubt had more important things to do. In this moment, Harry was Draco’s.
Draco shivered obediently under his touch, his body responding in all the right ways. Desperately thrashing against each other, thrusting so vigorously that there were flames between them, the enemy/lovers came in unison — pleasure filling every crevice of their bodies, which, though fully clothed, had never been so vulnerable with each other’s until now.
Harry couldn’t believe it. He had seen Draco in person, lived in the same house, breathed the same air…He swallowed deeply. Draco was alive. He was...well, “okay” would certainly not be the right word for it...but, at least, whole.
” he added as Draco still looked as though he wanted to resist. “GO!”
“Oh, I think I ate something bad,” Draco retorted, noticing a boner coming. “Bathroom.” On his way there, he made sure the other package was safely tucked in.
On the first Hogsmeade weekend of the year, Draco was ready to execute the first step of his plan.
“I’m not satisfied with that answer one bit,” Harry answered. But with one look at Draco, he gave in. “Oh go on then, a quick one,” he grinned and unbuckled his belt again.
Sure enough, he saw Draco’s dot disappear into the secret Room of Requirement —
“Er...yeah,” Draco quickly responded, putting on his best voice. “The idiot is probably off trying to do something heroic again.
Fully erect now—more so than ever before—Harry entered the maze of indescribable bliss that was Draco Malfoy.
Draco thought smugly.
“Ronald, you’re so insensitive sometimes!” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. “Okay, all the time,” she added. “If Harry doesn’t want people to know, he must have a good reason for it, don’t you Harry?” She gave him an all-too-familiar knowing look, which he found in equal parts comforting and annoying.
“Genius idea. We’ll help,” Goyle added.
, Draco thought.

Draco thought desperately.
“I’m not
Harry gulped. Was it
Harry sighed. He had been waiting for this. “Look, I just said it to Ginny, don’t tell me I have to say it to you too,” he said.
“But...oooh...I need to...
, Draco thought, as Harry smiled for the first time in what seemed like years. Draco took the moment to lean in and kiss Harry. “I do appreciate your offer, and I’m doing my best. You have to trust me too, okay?”
Grunting furiously as he thought desperately of Draco’s piercing eyes, the soft sound of his moans, the feel of his dick on Harry’s back...Harry’s body stirred.
“What the Dark Lord wants me to do is none of your business. Stay out of it.”
Draco thought.
the time you know,” He blushed. “But, I do have to go. Let’s do this next time?”
you, Ronald?” Hermione looked positively exasperated. “Ginny is perfectly capable of understanding that she and Harry’s situation is polyamorous, and that Harry’s bisexual” — Harry felt a gulp of relief — “and to answer your other question, I suppose anyone
“Harry, I…” Draco returned, sweating now. He was getting closer and closer.
Before he knew it, Snape had pinned him against a wall. Besides not trusting Snape himself, he had the sneaky feeling that he was being watched. If their roles were switched, surely, he would’ve followed Harry. Luckily, Draco knew to say just enough to put Snape off while not turning Harry against him.
Draco’s hands shook in an unmistakably familiar fashion as he looked Harry dead in the eye, his face resuming an unmistakable hatred. Returning his enemy’s stare with equal coldness, Harry suddenly realized that things were never really going to change for him and Draco.
“It is of utmost importance that Draco does not want to complete the task ahead, for your purposes and mine. We value our classmates’ characters after all,” —
Utterly unconvinced, Hermione muttered something about knowing Harry was up to something, if he couldn’t just
Hours later, Harry stumbled onto the Astronomy Tower with Professor Dumbledore in his arms. It seemed as though a lifetime had passed since he and Draco were headed out for a walk together.
Draco thought to himself, half sarcastically.
On the other side of the Great Hall, Draco was bragging about cornering Harry to Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle.
Then Draco was kissing him — kissing him like he had never before kissed him. A fire erupted in Harry — All he cared about in that moment was the taste of Draco’s tongue in his, the feeling of Draco’s hand grabbing his hair, the familiar embrace of his lover’s arms.
he worried.
Harry thought.
Still, Draco could never have prepared himself for the night he first heard clear news about Harry.
“Yeah...Yeah, I guess he’s not all bad,” Harry responded lamely.
“Remind you of something else of Malfoy’s that you like?” Ron teased.
“No, he’s right,” Draco replied, looking solemn. “I deserve it. Thank you, all of you. On top of saving my life, my family and I are indebted to you for defeating the Dark Lord. We were miserable under his rule.”
Draco smirked. “Different good?” He has to admit, he had not planned on putting so much aggression into his thrusts. It kind of just...happened.
“That was, er, different,” Harry muttered when they finished, seemingly speechless. “You sure you’re okay?”
“Leave me alone,” Draco uttered, his voice cracking. “Stop following me.”
“You always have a choice,” Harry answered, his voice softer now. Stroking Draco’s hair with his hand and looking down at his helpless expression, Harry understood what he had to do.
“Thank you. Thank you Draco,” Harry sputtered as he kissed Draco with such fervor that Draco’s cheeks turned red. “You have no idea how helpful you’ve been. Now, get your git arse the fuck out of the castle with the rest of the Slytherins. I’ll join you soon.”
Harry thought.
“Let’s drop it,” Harry interrupted before the two started bickering again. “As for the wand, I think I can control my feelings. It’s the best I’ve had for a while,” Harry said determinedly as he grabbed his lover’s wand tightly.
Harry thought.
With a swift motion that became so familiar it was basically a habit, the lovers undressed and took each other.
Draco simply looked at Harry.
With an impatient look at both of them, Hermione answered in her typical textbook tone: “Polyamory is when one has multiple sexual, emotional, and/or romantic engagements at the same time. This does not negate any of such relationships, nor makes them less worthwhile. Sometimes it’s referred to as ethical non-monogamy, and there are several variations of how people negotiate it exactly. Ideally, however, all parties fully consent to the situation and maintain open and direct communication about it.”
about all
Hermione is concerned about Harry using Draco’s wand, leading to Ron finding out about Harry and Draco. I try to bring out Ron and Hermione’s characters more in a dialogue between the trio.
Draco thought.
“Or what? Gonna jinx me?” Draco retorted. He slowed down, taking his time deliberately, but did not loosen his grip.
Nobody had dared tell the Dark Lord, but Draco was subjected to several rounds of the Cruciatus Curse from Bellatrix before she finally believed his lie — that he was trying to warn Crabbe and Goyle not to run away from Death Eater service because Lord Voldemort already knew of their whereabouts.
“Really, Malfoy? Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom?” Harry could not help himself from storming in. “What if I had decided to show up to the Room today, huh? Think I would’ve forgiven you if you weren’t there, patiently waiting?” He teased. He had already decided that he would cast his anger aside, just for this night, because his body could not take the excruciating pain of not being inside Draco’s for a moment longer.
Sitting at the long dining table that used to be saved for special occasions — like Draco’s birthdays, it made him shiver to remember — Draco could hardly contain himself when he saw Snape walk in. His mother kicked him under the table as he clenched his fists.
For a split second, it seemed as though Draco was tempted. Then, removing himself from Harry’s shoulder, he sputtered, “Go to Dumbledore? I can’t do that. He’ll kill me and my whole family! I’m not supposed to see Dumbledore unless...until...” Draco gazed off into the distance. “Can’t we just drop it?” He added pleadingly.
Crabbe and Goyle seemed convinced at Draco’s tone and turned to look for Harry. Draco grimaced as he thought of a way to distract his friends. They, after all, knew positively nothing about Draco’s...affairs. Or his sexuality, for that matter.
Harry had not had the chance to think—or sleep— in what felt like an eternity. The weeks following Harry’s personal revelations were consumed by plotting and planning, breaking into Gringotts, and escaping on a Dragon.
Harry was there when Katie Bell got cursed. He saw her fly into the air, her arms wide, her face looking as though it’d never see light again.
, he thought,
Sparks flew out of the wand’s tips as Harry’s hands went hot. The heat then traversed Harry’s fingertips and flowed through his whole body.
Harry went wild. “I want you...inside me...NOW,” he demanded as his hips thrust into the air and his dick rose to greet Draco’s. “Fuuuck,” Harry continued as his eyes rolled back into his head.
Harry Potter was sprinting at him from across the Great Hall. Sprinting, as though he, Draco, were the most important thing in the world. The thought made Draco’s insides curl.
Chaos ensued. Looking around for a sign of Harry, Draco spotted his lover in a corner below. Harry glared at him with a loathing that had only appeared on his face sarcastically in recent months. Before he could say anything, Draco was swept up into a swarm of Death Eaters.
“Yeah, er, good luck,” Draco responded lamely, though secretly thinking that it was he, Draco, who needed luck tonight.
“Does hate towards a wand’s previous owner cause it to malfunction?” Ron jumped in after overhearing Hermionen’s last comment. “We definitely shouldn’t use Bellatrix’s then.” He shot the object a look of disgust.
“Ron, be nice,” Hermione shot her husband a dark look. “That was a long time ago.”
“My mum, as you know, was dead before I could speak.”
Harry had not felt so understood in his life. Of course, it all made sense to him. He definitely thought of Ginny still, especially when he was strolling through a forest or enjoying a good bit of sunshine. It made his heart ache that she could not be there to accompany him in those moments…
“What good would that have done?” Draco asked.
to talk to Slughorn this week?” Hermione demanded.
Draco knew it would be too risky to openly join the resistance with the others—with Harry’s friends. Instead, he took a position assisting the Carrows in torturing students, then thwarted the siblings at every chance he got.
Meanwhile, Draco was quite pleased with himself. He had now successfully gotten Snape off his tail, revealed his true plan to his mother, and made substantial progress on the Vanishing Cabinet. Soon enough, his mother would come and join him, they would go to Dumbledore together, and this would all be over. His father was safely in Azkaban, and there was no one else in the world Draco cared about so Voldemort would not have anything to use. Except —
besides stand there helplessly to watch his enemy-lover-friend corner the man he looked up to most in the world.
, he had realized. “See you Harry.”
Convincing himself of this theory before he could think twice about it, Harry pulled out the Marauder’s Map and located Draco standing outside a classroom on the third floor. Pulling on his invisibility cloak, Harry set off on his pursuit.
secret.
, Harry stopped himself. In the split second it took him to regain his composure, Draco’s eyes were filled with something other than taunting.
at his slightest touch. “Turn around,” Draco demanded, though his hands were already on the job. Harry panted and fell on all fours, his eyes closed, ready to be fucked.
But he did not get the comfort he was desiring. “You won’t even tell us, will you, mate?” Ron demanded, clearly annoyed. “We’re supposed to be best friends, you know?”
Harry looked skeptical, but tilted his head forward ever-so-slightly in another motion resembling a nod.
, Draco rolled his eyes but secretly smiled.

“Ron nearly died. He’s in the hospital wing. I know it was you,” Harry continued, picking a fight. People up and down the hall had turned to watch.
Harry’s stomach clenched. Of course, this was all a joke.

“What’s gotten into you?” Harry retorted, still dumbstruck. “I thought you were the one who wanted to keep our, er,
It took Draco every ounce of determination in his body to make a smooth exit.
to poison Ron, had
Despite the horrified expression on Draco’s face and the less-than-ideal circumstances he was in, Harry couldn’t help but notice how handsome Draco had looked. He hadn't seen him so clearly, after all, in ages.
As Harry stepped in the tunnel towards Hogwarts led by Neville, he couldn’t believe or process what was about to occur. He barely caught himself as he stumbled into the Room of Requirement —
“You’re early,” he said, looking as menacing as can be. “Sit.”
But he stopped himself.
— had tried, time and again, to get him to talk. Harry didn’t run away, even after the Katie Bell and Snape encounters. He’d offered to
Harry’s heart sunk. Of course, he had to talk to Slughorn for Dumbledore and had forgotten all about it. Dumbledore…
— Draco pleasured himself. He imagined inviting Harry to fuck him in this bathroom, against this wall perhaps, crouched over that toilet seat. He let these glorious thoughts overtake him when he heard a noise outside —
“Fuck,” Draco repeated as he grabbed Harry in a warm embrace.
“It’s me,” Draco heard the air around him vibrate with a familiar voice. “Come inside.”

him from a poll in the Room...there was so much he still didn’t know about Harry...
, no less. I suppose you’ve forgotten all about Ginny then, have you?” Ron looked a mixture between amused and murderous. On second thought, Harry thought it was definitely closer to murderous.
After what seemed like an eternity, Harry finally looked up and nodded. Draco took the opportunity to sit down next to Harry.
Don’t you know how much danger you’re in?”
“Harry, I know we haven’t properly addressed the topic, and it’s my fault for not checking in before...I feel so guilty and of course I haven’t told anyone, even Ron, but —”
Harry thought, anger welling up inside him again.
him. He could even help Harry defeat the Dark Lord, knowing what he knew. And then they could be together, really together…
“Hey! Don’t do that,” Harry started shouting again.
he thought.
Draco thought.
Draco scrunched the letter into a ball and stopped himself from crying. It was nearly seven. He stormed to the Room of Requirement and fucked Harry like he hadn’t ever before, letting his anger and revulsion at his task ahead drive his body to dominate in a way he didn’t know was possible.
Draco couldn’t believe his ears. Harry Potter, in
never told anyone?”
Draco thought, feeling more pleased with himself than he could've imagined.
Hermione bit her lip. “Well, it’s just...don’t you think it might be distracting, given your...given your history?” Her confidence increased as she continued. “You don’t want the wand to malfunction if your feelings aren’t totally in control, right?”
Harry couldn’t believe what had happened that night. Weeks later, as he was packing up his suitcase to return, for the last time, to Privet Drive, he still had not processed it. Dumbledore, dead, Draco, running away, Snape, the Half-Blood Prince...his head could not take it anymore.
Scowling, Draco turned back to rejoin his friends.
Harry thought he saw the faintest blush across Hermione’s cheek. “I have my guesses, sure, but that doesn’t matter. Anyway, it’s not like they’ve defined anything, right Harry? Also, aren’t you going to ask out Ginny?”
or being torn apart from a Draco who shared Harry’s longing, one that was becoming unbearable.
Harry watched his lover leave the room with grace, making sure Draco was indeed headed to where the others were disapparating before hurriedly finding Ron and Hermione on the map.
“So you’ll do it then, great,” Harry uttered before being engulfed by his own moans. He looked down once more at Draco, now busy with his hands and mouth with a characteristically determined expression which existed solely to pleasure Harry, and felt his body shake.
“Well, I don’t know how soon, but I will. When it’s all over,” Harry pressed. “
“Harry, I’m so sorry.” It was Draco.
Harry looked beyond Draco at a young boy with uncannily similar looks to his childhood rival, accompanied by a beautiful woman with sleek brown hair.
,” Draco responded sarcastically. “The Dark Lord just wants me to go for an afternoon stroll with him and invite him for tea.
Harry wanted with all his being to respond to the familiar call. He could already feel himself getting hard again.
“I’ll take care of it,” he had said to Alecto just the other day. “Aunt Bella taught me some tricks,” he stammered convincingly, with a mischievously evil look on his face that was characteristically Malfoy.
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispered as he crashed down into his seat with his head resting in his hands. “I can’t do anything right. I’m nothing compared to you. My own mother can’t help me now.”
“I’m not brave like you, Harry. I’m so scared. These past few months with you...I’ve been living a fantasy. But I can’t anymore. I don’t have a choice.”
“Bye.”
“OOOHH MY GOODDD!!!” Harry shrieked, his hands clutching Draco’s head, his body throbbing with release. Seeing the desperation and lust on Harry’s face, Draco quickly followed. “FUUUCCKKK,” he yelled as he jerked himself to completion, taking in Harry’s wild features.
“Ooooh,” the enemies-turned-lovers-turned-enemies-turned-lovers groaned together. Draco thought his dick was feeling freedom for the first time — there were always firsts, even during their 495th fucking — as he thrust wildly into Harry. “Guess I’m not all bottom after all,” Draco bragged. “Fuck, fuck fuck
“And sure,” Draco continued, hoping to leave out the worry in his voice.
, Harry thought smugly.
As the months went on, Harry became busier and busier with schoolwork, Quidditch, and Dumbledore’s lessons. It seemed that Draco was less available as well, which Harry attributed to his still making a full recovery. He pushed the thought that Draco still had to appear like he was committing murder to Voldemort to the depths of his mind.
Harry looked around and gulped. It
Harry must’ve picked up on Draco’s crestfallen expression because he turned and kissed Draco with such force he nearly knocked Draco off his feet. “I’ll see you later, okay?” He stammered before running off.
Seven o’clock quickly became Harry’s favorite time of day. The other hours seemed to serve the sole purpose of counting down until seven. He often found himself filling them with day dreams of recent love-making sessions with Draco.
Harry’s body erupted in flames in a way that had nothing to do with the Fiendfyre. He was so angry, so disgusted at Draco’s betrayal that he could hardly feel happy about the Horcrux being destroyed.
“Said what to Ginny?” Draco replied. “I don’t care what’s between you and Ginny. I need you to know that I wouldn’t have killed Dumbledore. I intended only for my mother to come through the vanishing cabinet, so that she would be safe when I...when I went to Dumbledore for help. I was going to take his protection. You know...come over to your side.”
Unless Malfoy had
“Harry, what has gotten into you? Have you even
Harry’s screams echoed around the Room as he jerked himself to completion, his liquids landing brightly on Draco’s chest. Yet his mission was not complete.
Before Harry could respond, Draco was gone. Dumbfounded, he headed up to the castle, alone.
That night, Harry went to bed feeling more clear headed than he had in years. Swearing to give Hermione a big thank-you hug in the morning, Harry rolled over, and — clutching Draco’s wand close to his body — fell asleep with a grin on his face.
Harry thought guiltily as he felt himself tremble with desire.
“Harry?” Draco inquired worriedly as Harry revealed himself in the empty classroom. “What are you doing here? You need to get out,
With one look at his enemy-turned-lover-turned-back-enemy, Harry realized that Draco was being serious. Anger — pure rage — reached Harry’s fingertips as a burst of red light came out of Harry’s wand.
” Harry sputtered. “I don’t hear from you for nearly 20 years after you tried to kill me, and you have the nerve to stand there and ask me to
Draco’s voice was calm, but undoubtedly sour as he put two and two together about whose kids were whose.
Before Draco could continue this thought, however, they were out.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake, Harry, I thought you’d known all along! You’re
Harry proudly realized. Grasping Draco’s wand tightly in his hands, he saw a sea of familiar faces. It seemed that every student he had ever cared about was camping out here, everyone except…
Feeling his body turn a temperature he had not experienced since adolescence, Harry’s heart pounded.
This chapter is kind of an aside and I use it to explain Harry’s realizations about sexuality and polyamory. Feel free to skip if you’re just looking for Drarry action/would prefer to think of them as monogamous (The Epilogue might not make as much sense though).
This allowed Harry to give his dick a few good strokes to Draco’s memory before more thoughts creeped in.
“When it comes to you and me, aren’t these things one and the same?” Draco responded, as though reading Harry’s mind.
