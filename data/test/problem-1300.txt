Sirius hands were shaking, and the room suddenly felt colder. He dreaded the question he knew he had to ask.
Harry scowled. After a few moments of silence, he pushed his cereal away, scraping the chair as he stood.
The other boy simply stared at Harry, expressionless and unmoving. He exhaled a sharp breath of air, but otherwise didn’t make a sound. When he finally moved, it was to turn away from Harry.
One of the things I have always headcannoned, is Sirius being really good for Harry in the way that he lets him act his age.
He sat at the table, shoveling eggs into his mouth when Sirius walked in, yawning and rubbing his eyes. His hair resembled Harry’s, the black mess fluffy and sticking up in different spots. As Sirius shuffled into the room, Harry monitored him, checking if he had stayed up too late. When he went to the cupboard to obtain the instant coffee, Harry knew he had. The man hated instant coffee.
“Well, apparently Lucius was more clued in than I thought. Like I knew he thought his son liked Harry, but I didn’t think the man knew his son was a flaming homo. Honestly, the poor kid could have given me a run for my money back in the day. Anyway, turns out he worked through some shit, and now he is what the teens call ‘tolerant’.”
The summer sun had turned Draco’s cheeks pink and his hair was damp with sweat. He had long since rolled up his shirt sleeves. Passing shade granted short relief from the summer sun, but it didn’t last long. He mumbled under his breath as he walked, cursing Potter and his dog for putting him through this. Yet, regardless of his discomfort, he couldn’t keep the twinge of pain aching in his chest each time he thought about how frightened Potter had looked before he took off. Draco had never imagined seeing Potter in such a state.
Harry gently placed his hand on Draco’s arm. The other boy inhaled sharply, his eyes darting down to stare at Harry’s hand on his bicep.
Soon the footpath ceased to exist, and all that marked the path for Draco was the patchy grass and dirt under his shoes. He walked until the trees became larger and dead leaves soon covered the earth’s floor. His head jerked each time he heard a new noise, his eyes searching for the threats around him. The large black dog was still attached to Draco by the rope, and he held it tightly, like it could be used as a shield should the need arise.
Harry stood away from them all, watching the emotions run through Sirius’s face. His eyes were trained on Mrs. Malfoy who hadn’t taken her eyes off of him.
When they exited the stage, Harry couldn’t help but notice that despite his sneer, Draco didn’t say anything to the flabbergasted Ron or the bouncing Hermione. While Harry wasn’t overly impressed with his new friend, he noted it was indeed progress.
The chill of the night blew against Harry’s exposed skin, sending a shiver through his body. He crossed his arms and jogged the last steps to the front door. He couldn’t keep the smile from his face, the memories of the night washing over him. Comments from Draco that made him laugh so hard his stomach hurt, the dumb, theatrical manner in which the other boy spoke, the tickling of his arms brushing against Harry’s as they sat on a park bench eating fried chips.
I really hope you don’t hate me for not telling you. I didn’t want to ruin your holiday, which I know is a shit excuse but it’s true. I’m so sorry for making you worry.
Rolling his eyes, Draco stood, walking with his back turned to Harry towards his walk-in wardrobe. Harry listened as Draco rummaged around. When he emerged, he was wearing a pair of black jeans. Harry couldn’t explain why the sight made his heart rate increase.
Harry rolled his eyes, too used to Draco’s commands to take offense anymore. Finally, he shut the draw’s before turning to face the other boy. Standing in front of him, Draco Malfoy held out a neatly wrapped present, topped with red and gold ribbon.
Without a word of explanation, Petunia reached into her bag, and pulled at a small, thin bundle of letters, held together by a single rubber band.
Harry cut Sirius of by throwing himself into the man’s chest, wrapping his arms tightly around his body.
“Whatever is on your mind, just sort it out already. Your making me nervous and you suck at cleaning.”
“Mr. Dursley, I won’t have you speak of a child like that in my courtroom. That behaviour is unacceptable. Another outburst like that, and I will have you charged with Contempt of Court.”
Slam! A door slammed shut behind Harry. The sound of heavy, pounding footsteps came closer and closer, closing in on Harry. A deep chill filled the hallway, raising the hair on his arms. Without hesitating, Harry threw open the door to Draco’s room slamming it behind him and holding it shut.
They sat in silence after those words. Harry stared into space, his eyes unfocused. A deep fear settled within him, twisting his stomach and making him nauseous. Distantly, he could hear Sirius talking to him, could feel him rubbing his arm. The touch made his skin crawl, but he couldn’t bring himself to shrug Sirius off.
Uncle Vernon walked beside her. The suit he wore was a size too small, its sleeves hugging his arms too tightly. The shirts buttons gripped together through sheer will. Sweat marks stained through to his blazer beneath his armpits. The walrus moustache was dripping with sweat. Harry could practically feel the floor shaking with every step the overweight man took.
There was something about the image of Parkinson draping herself about in Draco’s room that unsettled Harry. He shifted in his seat, slouching back, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Hey Harry,” Ginny Weasley stood behind him, looking upon Harry and Luna with a quizzical look on her face.
Harry couldn’t decide if he should try and speak or not. The mere effort of talking seemed exhausting, but he hated how quite his godfather was being. In the short time he had gotten to know Sirius, he had learnt quite was never a good thing.
Harry wore the same shirt and jeans he had been wearing the day before. His hair was even messier than it usually was and there were smudges on his glasses that he was too lazy to clean. When he looked at Sirius, Harry noticed for the first time in the week, the man had pulled his hair back into a ponytail and shaved his face.
Remus expression stayed blank, a false blanket of calm. Sirius knew Remus though. He saw the twitch in the other man’s hand, the tapping of his foot, the glint in his eyes. Remus was anxious. Yet, he was more patient than Sirius. He always had been. So, they sat in silence, Remus staring him down with a raised eyebrow and thinly pressed lips until Sirius couldn’t stand it any longer.
“Wait,” Harry looked at Sirius, his eyebrows furrowed. He ran the sentence through his head, key words dog and pick playing over and over again. “You’re not kidding? We are getting a dog.”
“The first day Lucius brought Draco over, I realised. I thought there was going to be a fist fight, I won’t lie, but then I brought it up to Lucius, and apparently, he reckons Draco has wanted to be friends with Harry since First Year. Not that the kid would ever admit it, he said,” Sirius gestured wildly with his hands. “And, to be honest, the more I saw them interact, I kind of figured why Lucius thought that.”
“Finally,” Ron groaned. “I’ve been starving since history. Let’s go to the canteen, Harry. I managed to sneak some change from Fred and George this morning.”
“We are talking later!” Draco pointed to him, before rushing out the door of the abandoned classroom.
“Shit, Remus…” Sirius breathed. He shook his head slightly. “I mean, I figured you would have noticed… you and James were the first to pick up on how my mum treated me.”
Inside, Lucius Malfoy was sitting behind his grand office desk. The desk was vacant of all files, instead holding only ornaments and picture frames. The man himself sat in a large leather office chair, platinum hair pulled back in a ponytail and his office phone pressed to his ear. He looked at Sirius with wide eyes and a thin pressed mouth.
Harry nodded at the answer. He looked at Draco and raised his eyebrow. Draco, in response, shook his head slightly as his eyes widened. Harry gestured with his head to Luna, who was still staring vacantly at the movie posters. Draco threw his head back and let out a silent but deep sigh.
Draco shook his head, his eyes squinted and angry, his lips pursed. It was a look Harry knew well. The ‘Potter you fucking idiot, how can anyone be so stupid’ look. It was an expression he had been receiving from Draco since First year, and now that Harry thought about what he had said, he realised he deserved it this time. Of course, Malfoys house didn’t have ghost. He was being stupid. Any minute now Draco would open his mouth and tell him so.
“Soon, alright! The longer Harry stays out of this, the better it is for him. He doesn’t need to know all the details, ok Malfoy.”
“Your Honour, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley have not protested Mr. Potter residing with Mr. Black, either formally or informally, nor have they made any attempts to contact my client regarding the wellbeing of Mr. Potter since his absence from their care. Mr. Black has made as such clear throughout his statement.”
Tracking down Potter proved a long and tiring process. Malfoy would have surely given up by now, if not for the insistent pull of Potter’s beast. The dog had its head low to the ground sniffing, completely ignoring the person that held his reins. Each time Malfoy tired, the beast pulled harshly, causing him to jump forward and keep walking.
“Well, do you think Potter would prefer you adopt his son, or that Harry ends up back in the care of his abusive relative? Honestly, I thought even you could work it out.”
Harry couldn’t do much more than nod as Sirius gently guided him from his seat. His godfather opened the back door to let snuffles in, clipping the leash onto his collar before leading them out the front door.
They stared at each other a little longer. Harry was beginning to feel like he was intruding so he averted his eyes from the two, studying his shoes and quirking his lips in discomfort. After a few moments, he cleared his throat, hoping it would distract the two men.
If Harry were being honest with himself, he knew this mood had been developing for weeks now. Because, despite all the amazing things he now had in his life, his unconscious mind refused to get with the memo. Each night over the past few weeks, Harry had woken screaming.
She took a deep breath, before walking the last steps to Harry. Draco was still on high alert but was kept at bay by Harry’s sharp tap to his forearm.
“Oh, come on Moony!” Sirius exclaimed. “Just then, when Harry asked to borrow my clothes? Did you not pick up on that?!”
He trailed off towards the end, eyes scanning the hallway like said man would appear at the mere mention of the insult. They were nearing the Science room and could hear the chatter of their classmates echoing through the hall.
“This is FUCKING ridiculous!” Vernon threw himself from his hair, pushing the table as he stood. “I took care of that freak for FOURTEEN years. I deserve COMPENSATION!”
As he descended the stairs, the first thing he noticed is the two guest’s blonde hair. Like usual, Mr. Malfoy had his long hair pulled back, but unlike usual, there was no gel in the younger Malfoys hair. Instead, his hair fell normally, tousled and shining.
So, Harry cries a lot in this, but like, the kid deserves it, he's been through the ringer. Canon be damned.
Sirius sent a surprised look to Lucius. The other man looked just as shocked and sent a single nod back to Sirius.
“Oh yeah, of course Harry,” Sirius inspected two black mugs as he spoke to Harry. “Do you know his number?”
Here is the movie date turned not a movie date, haha sorry not sorry. I love Luna too much not to include her.
Harry knew if he asked him to, Ron would have stayed behind. He was just that sort of friend. One time when they were 13, Harry had run over to his farm after a major argument with Uncle Vernon. Ron hadn’t even questioned what had happened, simply taking Harry’s teary eyes and bruised cheek for what they were. He let him stay as long as Harry needed, and Harry stayed as long as he could let himself.
Harry watched as panic washed over Sirius the closer Professor Lupin got. He felt a twinge of panic himself, watching his godfather freak out.
They sat in silence again, the only noise in the room the platter of rain on the window and snippets of conversations resonating from the television.
The day continued with relative ease. The class had all but forgotten about Draco’s outburst. However, towards the end of the day, in-between classes, Harry had walked past Parkinson ripping into Draco over the matter. They were off to the side of the hallway, Draco surveying the students walking past, Parkinson staring at the blonde with bulging, outraged eyes. Ron and Hermione were too far into their argument to listen to the Slytherins argument.
With a small smile, Harry slowly unwrapped the extravagantly wrapped present. He could tell Draco was itching for him to hurry, annoyed the wrapping wasn’t ripped away quickly. Once Harry removed all the tape, he pulled away the paper, revealing a small, leather bound book with a family crest engraved on the front. Harry ran his hand over the engraving, tracing the letter P in the centre. He frowned.
“Well I fucking do, so deal with it, you self-hating prat. I’m meant to be the drama queen in this relationship, not you, so sack up.”
They walked down the corridor into a small room lined with metal fences. Inside the fences, blocked off from each other’s cages, were several dogs of varying sizes. The majority looked to be a mixture of breeds with no definite features of only one type of dog.
“No, you dunce. You got guardianship. This is different. And if you want to make it impossible for the Dursleys to regain their guardianship over Mr. Potter, you have limited options. The most suitable being adoption, though there are other avenues we could explore.”
All the lights in the house were off. The only thing lighting the room was the faint glow of the television. Gently closing the door, Harry crept through the hallway, intent to head straight to his room. However, when he got to the base of the staircase, his creep was interrupted by a long, breathy moan coming from the living room.
“It doesn’t matter, Malfoy. This is just about making Sirius my legal guardian. They refused to sign the paperwork, and things… escalated. Now, well, I just…I don’t…”
Sirius jerked. He moved to bolt out of his chair but was stopped short when Harry grabbed his arm. He wore the same murderous expression from before. Harry looked to Mr. Malfoy for help but was surprised to find the other man looked just as disturbed by his Uncles comment. Mr. Malfoys eyes were narrowed and his lips thinly pressed. He looked ready for blood.
Sirius knelt beside him. His godfather’s face was pale, eyes glassy, and his hair was pulled back into a frizzy bun.
Sirius walked up to the lady behind the desk, who gave him a beaming smile. She was beautiful, her blonde hair shining with each movement and her white teeth displayed in her perfect smile. She managed to make the red and black vet scrubs fashionable. She didn’t look much older than Harry, and her badge said trainee.
After a few minutes standing awkwardly in the bushes, Draco moved. He walked to the other boy, his strides confident even if his feet wobble when he stepped over the branches littering the clearings floor. When he finally stood above Potter, he stared hard at the boy. Potter looked to be preparing for a fight, his eyes narrow and his mouth pressed thin. Yet, instead of antagonising the boy, Draco simply turned and sat beside him.
Harry clenched his hand around Sirius’s arms so tight, he was sure it hurt. But Sirius didn’t protest. His godfather leaned forward in anticipation. The Judge dropped the papers he was holding and surveyed those before him.
Sirius opened his eyes, ready to start screaming at the man in front of him, before he saw Malfoys reaction. His jawline set and his eyes narrowed, Malfoy looked the angriest Sirius had ever seen the man. Even his cheeks were tinted pink again his pale white skin, something that Sirius had only seen once on a prank gone wrong against Malfoy back in High School.
“By the way, I meant to tell you. Snuffles is running low on dog food. I am going to head to the store tomorrow to pick some up, so don’t worry. Can’t have our favourite pupper going hungry, can we?” He scratched under Snuffles chin, who started thumping his leg in response.
“Vernon Dursley, you are hereby charged with Contempt of Court on the third of July in the Family court in proceedings before me between Mr. Black v the Dursleys over the guardianship of one Harry Potter. For verbally assaulting Mr. Potter and attempted assault, you did thereby conduct yourself in a manner that had a real tendency to interfere with the administration of justice,” The Judge looked to the security guards. “Escort Mr. Dursley from my courtroom immediately.”
After leaving the house, they had walked for over 20 minutes, Sirius talking fast and cheerily, Harry listening contently. It was nearing half an hour of walking and Harry was starting to tire from the distance. He was unsure why they couldn’t have just taken a bus. Between the pull of the crowd pushing Harry forward and backwards, and Sirius’s quick, excited strides, it was inevitable they would be split apart.
“You’re pale as fuck, Potter,” Draco was looking at him with a raised eyebrow. He kept his voice low to keep his Father from hearing him swear. Lucius Malfoy was much to busy to take note of his sons’ behaviour anyway.
“Then tell me what’s bothering you, bud. You don’t look comfortable with this, and it’s worrying me.”
The movie was better than both Harry and Draco expected. It was full of major fights between different mythical creatures and the graphics were the best Harry had ever seen. They walked out of the cinemas, happily chatting with Luna about the movie.
“I said it didn’t matter if he won or not, not that he wasn’t trying to win,” Draco rolled his eyes. He didn’t like the severity of the conversation, and so he reverted to what he knew.
“Ok, Ok,” Sirius held up his hands in a peaceful stance, attempting to calm his panicked godson. “I had to check. I want to know if this is going to be a problem. It was stupid of me not to think this would become an issue sooner.”
“Are you mad?” said Harry, his voice croaky and low. “Of course I want to leave the Dursleys. When can I move in? Do you have a house?”
For what was one of many times, Harry silently thanked his best friends and their ability to pull himself from his own head. They walked through the gates of Hogwarts together, walking up the winding path to the castle.
“It’s not like I don’t want to!” His eyes were stinging, like they always did when talking about James. “He is my godson. I would do anything to protect him, Remus. I just don’t want to forget James. I shouldn’t be able to take away his place as Harry’s father.”
The bell finally rang for lunch and Harry couldn’t be more grateful. The class packed up, shoving books into bags, and scraping chairs along the stone floor.
The sharp clicks of heals hitting the tiled floor grew louder. Draco jumped to his feet, and Harry quickly followed. Towards them marched none other than Petunia Dursley. Her face was sour, her back straight, arms swinging quickly at her sides. Draco looked ready to start screaming for a security guard but stopped short when Harry shook his head. Petunia stopped her march mere metres in front of them.
He made his way down the stairs slowly, careful not to make any noise. He walked into the open living room and paused. Sirius was sitting with his back to Harry on the couch watching the television. The room was dark, only lit by the dull light emanating from the television which played a generic quiz show. Harry took a deep breath. He walked to the side of the couch and placed himself in the edge of Sirius’s sight while making sure he in no way blocked the television. That had never gone down well with Uncle Vernon.
“Nothing!” Harry defended. Draco raised an eyebrow, and Harry noticed how stiff he was holding his body. Rolling out his shoulders, Harry tried to relax. “This couch just looks like, really expensive.”
Sirius looked stricken and close to tears, but Harry kept eye contact with Mr. Malfoy. The man stared back with a blank expression. Eventually, he lifted his chin and gave one short
Draco was standing outside the cinemas when Harry rounded the corner from the bus stop. His pale face and blonde hair were shining underneath the fluorescent lights above him. Harry watched as Draco surveyed the diminishing afternoon crowd with a disinterested look. He was tapping his foot, and he could practically hear him tsk-ing at Harry’s tardiness.
All morning things had been tense between the two of them. It was a combination of boredom, stress, and the terrible weather, and neither Harry nor Draco were known for their ability to react rationally to the other.
“I hope that was alright,” Sirius grabbed the present, holding it out to Harry with shaking fingers.
After it all, the three were emotionally and physically exhausted. Malfoy asked minimal questions and remained stoic. Sirius looked on the verge of murder and had to excuse himself into the kitchen for a breath. Harry couldn’t blame him. He had never delved into so much detail about his relatives, and the experiences were rushing back to him, causing his hands to shake.
Harry told him about his life with the Dursleys. He spoke of the daily chores that were too much for any four-year-old to handle and the punishments he received for not finishing. He spoke of his Aunt Petunia and her frying pan, and his Uncles punishments that usually entailed a few punches and days locked in his cupboard. He told Malfoy and Sirius things he had never told anyone, such as the time his Uncle put him in hospital with a concussion and three fractured ribs. Harry had been forced to tell the nurses he had fallen down the stairs. All the stories led up to his final night with his relatives and him running away to Sirius.
“I know that you don’t trust me, but I haven’t done anything but try and help you all week, Potter. I don’t know why you still think I’m going to use everything against you.”
Sirius ran a hand over his face, feeling the scratch of his stubble has he dug his nails across his chin. Remus hadn’t looked away from him. Sirius was actively avoiding eye contact. He watched a stray newspaper blow across the road, the pages separating as they flew in a multitude of directions.
Begged was an exaggeration. Narcissa had screamed at him he was unworthy of the family title and assets. He could still remember her saying she wished in were him who had died, rather than Regulus. Sirius had never said as much, but he agreed with everything she said. Still, the slight exaggeration was enough to interest Malfoy, who sat down in his leather chair, eyes assessing Sirius.
She walked Snuffles and the boys out of the small room and into a tiny fenced off yard. Harry and Sirius stayed a few steps behind her and Snuffles, who kept looking over his shoulder at the two, tail between his legs.
“And we have two parties vying for Guardianship over one Harry Potter. Is that you, son?” The judge smiled at Harry.
“No Sirius. I fucked up. I’ve been teaching Harry for two years. I should have noticed something, but instead I put it down to him being James’s son, being secretive because of the trouble he was getting himself into. Fuck. I should have noticed. I’m so fucking sorry I didn’t notice.”
The men glanced at the exhausted dog, who continued panting on the living room floor. Draco sent a surprised look at Harry, who shook his head.
Harry and Draco both looked each other up and down. Draco opened his mouth to answer when Harry cut in.
Draco looked to Harry and felt the overwhelming need to apologize. He wasn’t even sure what he would be apologizing for. Today, for their past, for finding out why his father was representing the other boy. It all just became to much and guilt was swimming in his stomach, making him feel ill.
The hound bit his pants, roughly tugging him forward. When he heard a sharp rip, Malfoy swore. He picked up the rope attached to Potter's dog, and immediately the beast pulled him forward, just about jerking his arm from its socket.
The good thing about Hogwarts had always been its location. It seemed no matter how far away you lived, it was only a matter of minutes by bus. It truly was magic, Harry thought. He couldn’t explain it, how his friends came from all over, small towns and cities, and each came to the same school.
Harry scowled, and moved the rest of the way to the other couch. He slumped into the seat. His face was red, and his thoughts swam to how ridiculous Mr. Malfoy thought he must have looked. Harry tried to avoid the man’s gaze, instead watching Sirius pour tea into a mismatched tea set. When he was finished and had handed out beverages to everyone in the room, Sirius sat next to him. Mr. Malfoy held his cup in his hands, before putting it down on the table without taking a sip.
Both Neville and Harry jumped, jerking around to see Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan running towards them. Dean had his bag thrown across his shoulder and a worn football tucked underneath his arm. They slowed when they reached the other two boys, grinning like madman. They had neared the classroom already, where ahead of them, most of the class was already gathered, including Ron and Hermione, and Draco who was scowling at something his friends had said.
“Just pick something, Malfoy,” Harry said, after Malfoy changed the channel after two minutes of deliberation on some crappy Spanish drama.
“Very well,” Mr. Malfoy sighed. “Mr. Potter, this meeting will not require your presence. Draco, you won’t need to be here either. I suggest you both find something to do while Black and I sort things out.”
“I have to go talk with Lucius to sort out some stuff,” Sirius hand rested on Harry’s shoulder. “Stay here with Draco and stay near a security guard, ok?”
“We’ve got this, Harry,” Sirius repeated his mantra, sounding like he was trying to convince himself more than Harry.
Harry slowly nodded. He studied the girl standing beside them. She wore a frilly lilac dress, sky blue stockings and large doc martins. A necklace made from every variety of beads was strewn across her neck and as she stood there swaying, it jingled and clanked.
“Ronald! It was very educational, Harry,” Hermione took her seat and unpacked her books. “We went over our prefect duties and some of the additional perks of the job, like being able to take points from houses.”
“Look, I haven’t told Ron and Hermione yet, alright,” Harry heard Draco tut, but pushed on. “In my defence, you know I haven’t even properly told them about Sirius!”
Lucius was staring at his son with a raised eyebrow and a small smirk on his face. Draco felt his cheeks heat up as a small blush painted his cheeks. He looked to the floor, inspecting the dirt that covered his shoes.
They all turned to look at him, Sirius looking relieved as he glanced over Harry. The gaze of all the Malfoys had Harry shrinking his neck into his shoulders. His wide eyes shifted
Malfoy practically growled, refusing to respond to Sirius’s question. He checked his watch, then turned away.
“I still can’t believe Harry and Malfoy are friendly. I feel like I’ve woken up in an alternate reality,” Remus shook his head.
The Malfoys all followed Sirius’s gaze, Lucius and Narcissa delicately turning their heads, Malfoy straining his neck.
Harry thought for a moment. He picked at his nail beds, tearing skin from his fingers absentmindedly.
While they waited, Draco refused to look at or speak to Harry. He ground his teeth as he watched the boy on the pinball machine with narrow eyes. He looked ready to hurl Luna’s popcorn at him each time he made a loud noise.
The next morning Harry was filled with dread. The moment he woke up he was exhausted and the thought of spending the day with Malfoy felt like a nightmare spilt over into the real world. Yesterday afternoon, Sirius had checked Harry was alright with the arrangement. He assured Harry he would call Mr. Malfoy and tell him they had changed their minds if Harry wasn’t comfortable, but Harry wouldn’t let him. It felt too much like cowering away and Harry wouldn’t let Malfoy have the satisfaction of scaring him.
Now, however, he had no game plan. He didn’t feel up to playing football. He couldn’t spot Neville anywhere, meaning the boy was probably in the Garden Nursery helping Professor Sprout. He did see Ginny, her red hair shining in the sun, but she was surrounded by a group of girls and Harry would rather die than walk up to them right now.
Sirius hummed, not rising to the bait. He showed Malfoy into the living room, gesturing for him to sit in the large leather brown chair. The man looked affronted at such an offer, but after a few moments, simple etiquette and manners won out and he slowly slunk himself down onto the edge of the seat.
At the question, Luna looked at him like he had asked her if she would like a brand-new puppy, the way her eyes lit up with delightful surprise.
“Hello, you two,” Professor Lupin greeted them with a cheery voice. There were deep bags under his eyes and the scars on his face looked irritated. “What are you up to? Out for a walk with your new dog?”
“Zat is why he is called Snuffles,” Harry heard Fleur say over the excited sniffing next to his ear.
He barely had time to apologies before another body was knocking into him, sending him flying to the ground. He could feel the sting of his cut palms before he saw the red cuts. His arms began to shake violently, making it harder for him to pull himself up from the ground.
He was coming to accept the though of his own death when a hand gripped his forearm tight enough to bruise and pulled him up. He felt strong arms grip his midsection, and panic overwhelmed him. He was being pulled to the side of the footpath near a building when the ringing in his ears gave way to words.
Ps. Sirius is totally awesome and let me adopt a dog! His name is Snuffles and I don’t know what type he is, but I can’t wait for you to meet him.
When the song fizzled out, Harry stopped his movements awkwardly, still smiling a smile that shone through his eyes. Sirius heaved in exaggerated breaths. He held his hands on his hips.
“I, Judge Odgen, hereby rule that full guardianship of one Harry Potter be granted to Sirius Black, on July third. I also rule that the Dursleys hold no legal rights to the child and thereby no right to visitation,” he smacked the gavel on the desk. “Court adjourned.”
He smiled down at Harry who suddenly felt an overwhelming surge of pressure. It was such a big decision and he was beginning to worry he might choose wrong. What if he picked a dog that destroyed everything, and Sirius decided to get rid of the dog and Harry for choosing it. As the thought consumed Harry, Sirius and Fleur continued talking about the options available.
“Mr. Malfoy has compiled a number of witness statements for the hearing today,” The Judge held up a sheet of paper, which he peered at with narrowed eyes. “One in particular, written by a Mrs. Arabella Figg, states the night Mr. Potter left your care, she heard a number of disturbing noises, including you, one Mr. Dursley, calling your nephew several slurs that I won’t repeat here today.”
He put on his usual baggy blue jeans and stained white t-shirt. Then he took them off. Harry dug to the bottom and managed to pull out a blue shirt that was relatively unstained. He put it on. He dug around some more, before finding a pair of black jeans. Harry realised when he put them on, they were hole-ridden. He took them off. He was standing in his boxers and the only unstained shirt he owned, a slight chill making him shiver, when he got an idea. He ran to the door and stuck his head out into the hallway.
It was in the silence that Harry thought about his life with Sirius. Harry remembered when he had first stepped into the home and how content he had felt, how safe. He thought of Snuffles and the nights Harry had snuck him up to bed with him, and how Sirius definitely knew what was happening but let him do it anyway. He thought of the spontaneous dances Sirius would pull him into, or the stories he told about Harry’s parents. He thought of leaving all this behind for the cold, locked room that held promises of punishments and pain.
After their coffee’s arrived, Harry had come around the corner and made his way to their table. Snuffles trotted alongside him and resumed his position laying, as Harry took his seat. Sirius had pretended not to notice his godson’s sly smirk. The three of them spent the rest of their morning at the café. They chatted over coffee, and when that was all gone, decided to order lunch. Remus ordered a salad, while Harry and Sirius had burgers.
“Don’t you fucking knock?!” the shrill, angry voice of Draco Malfoy shocked Harry out of his fright.
“No, no! You stay Harry. I should be going,” his teacher reached to retrieve his rumpled sweater from the ground.
Harry huffed. A pair of pants slumped to the floor and Harry gave Draco the side eye. Walking to the bed, Harry gathered his presents, stockpiling what he received. Then, he took the time to place each present away in his cupboards. He ignored Draco as he worked, letting the other boy inspect the room he already knew too well.
Harry couldn’t stop his head from shaking minutely, like he couldn’t understand what Draco was saying.
Upon Harry’s intrusion, Draco had ripped the headphones off his head but did nothing more than shoot the other boy a seething glare.
“Well, I’ll tell you what. I don’t think they are exactly like we were, because I highly doubt Snape ever had a crush on me,” Sirius shuddered, the thought making him want to gag.
“I am not dating Pansy!” Draco walked over and draped himself on the couch beside Harry, leaning against the side as he faced the other boy.
Harry spent most the day there with Sirius, Melissa patiently watching over the two. He learnt about his parents, and why he had never been able to meet Sirius until now. He learnt how Sirius had been falsely accused of murder and had spent the past twelve years in prison. Sirius told him about how when he had been released four months beforehand, he had wasted no time. He spent the time between then and now undergoing psych evaluations and different procedures all in hopes of finally getting to see Harry again.
Harry bolted to his room the second he heard Sirius hang up the phone. When Harry heard his godfather walk past his room later that night, he pulled the covers over his head and
“I told Remus I would have dinner with him,” Sirius found himself replying. Not that he owed the other man an explanation. Truly, it had just slipped out.
“You know, after you told me everything that had been going on, I fucking hated myself. Still do. I mean, how could I have been so blind! Harry was my student. I was trained to spot these things.”
Harry had been expecting a fight from the other boy. Harsh words that Harry could retaliate against. He hadn’t been expecting this.
“After we go camping, Mum said we might stay a few nights in London, just bum around the city for a bit.”
Sirius and Mr. Malfoy walked over to Draco and Mrs. Malfoy. The four stood beside the reception desk, Sirius and Narcissa’s eyes locked, Mr. Malfoy looking between the two and
“You’ve come to know my son over these past weeks,” Malfoy’s voice had undeniably lowered. His eyes surveyed the room in a calculating way. No one was around them. “So, if you must know, Draco played a large part in my ... what did you call it … increased tolerance.”
“Well, I don’t see a problem with that…” Sirius said, completely baffled at the request. “Harry, what do you think?”
Awkwardly, he wrapped his hands around her back and patted. Once she let go, Ron pulled him in roughly. When he let go, he ruffled Harry’s head, leaving his thick black curls even messier than before.
"Given the statements and evidence I have received from a number of parties, I am inclined to grant Mr. Black legal guardianship over Mr. Potter.”
Sirius carried the two brown bags, smiling at his godson as they walked down the street. Despite being an enormous dog who was probably much stronger than Harry, Snuffles did not pull against Harry’s grip. Instead, he contently walked between Harry and Sirius with his head held high and his tail wagging. The walk home Harry repeatedly thanked Sirius, gushing about Snuffles and how amazing this surprise had been.
Harry felt his face heat up. He wondered what Mrs. Malfoy meant by that. He let out a nervous laugh that he hoped Draco wouldn’t hear.
“You have got to stop grabbing me, dude,” Harry breathed, heart pounding. “I swear, if I accidentally pop you in the nose, it’s on you.”
Harry tried hard to tune them out, but it seemed every word they said got louder and louder. Parkinson was giggling somewhat cruelly, and Malfoy’s obnoxious drawl continued throughout the class. Harry knew by now Snape could hear but was choosing to ignore them.
“What I’m saying,” Draco finally looked at him, and Harry’s chest tightened when he saw the blue eyes staring at him. “Is that we shouldn’t tell our friends. At least not until we figure out if we are going to stay friends now that your trial is over.”
When they left, and it was just Harry and his godfather left in the room, Sirius couldn’t keep himself from smirking at his godson. There was a mischievous glint in his eyes.
“The boys a freak! He deserved his punishment,” Vernon shouted. “All I tried to do was make him normal!”
Harry found the kennel to be both a joyful and exhausting experience. After saying goodbye to Professor Lupin, something which took much longer than was normal, Harry and Sirius headed up the street to a small vet clinic. The interaction between the two men was something Harry made a mental note to ask Sirius about later, but at that moment he couldn’t keep his mind off the thought of getting a dog. Harry had been buzzing the entire walk, continuously asking Sirius if this were a joke, if he was sure, and could they really get a dog.
Harry was upstairs pacing in his room when he heard the knocking on the front door. It was Mr. Malfoys usual rhythm; Tap, tap…tap. Harry’s heartbeat spiked, and his hands clenched at his side. He heard Sirius greeting the Malfoys and knew he couldn’t stay up in his room any longer.
Sirius huffed a small laugh, before moving from the doorway to join Harry on his bed. Harry shuffled so he was leaning against his bed post, pulling his knees up to his chest. Sirius stayed sitting on the edge, his feet planted on the wooden floor.
Harry felt heat explode across his cheeks. He placed the plastic apple back on its pile, avoiding meeting Draco’s eyes.
Finally, Malfoy looked back, smirk on his face, ready for whatever retort Potter would respond with. He expected to see anger in the boy, unbridled and fierce like he always looked when they fought. He was not expecting the pale, shaking boy he saw.
“What about the Weaslette?” He snorted. “God, I will never forget second year, when she sent you that valentine…”
His room was not large, nor was is small. A double bed sat against the wall furthest from the door and above it was a square window. The duvet was a simple blue colour with matching sheets. Opposite his bed was a dresser. Despite having four drawers, Harry had only managed to fill one. When he had moved in, he had only brought his school stuff; homework, uniform, books, and the photo album Sirius had given him for his birthday. Sirius has since taken him shopping, but Harry refused to get more than was strictly necessary. A spare set of clothes and his school uniform was all he had needed at the Dursleys.
“Keep your mouth shut and let father do the talking. No emotional outburst. No disagreeing with father in front of the judge. You go along with everything he says, even if you don’t agree. He is going to win this, Harry. You have to trust us,” Draco’s voice whispered into Harry’s ears, making the hair on his neck stand up.
Slow nods seemed to be the only reaction Harry could force from his body. The other man turned around, frantically buttoning his white shirt. Harry saw the bright red face of Remus Lupin staring back at him. Everybody seemed to hold their breath.
Harry looked at the sign above the shop when Sirius walked away. It read Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour.
“Yeah, she and I talked about the trouble I was having. Made me realise I was being stupid about the whole thing.”
Harry’s felt a squeeze in his chest. He was reminded of primary school, and no one ever standing up to Dudley for him. He remembered how happy he felt the first time Ron yelled at Draco for being rude to him.
When his eyesight refocused, he was expecting to see Sirius hugging him from behind. He was not expecting to see a ragged man dressed in an old suit with rushed patch jobs fixing the torn fabric. The man had sandy brown hair and kind hazel eyes. He was encouraging Harry to breathe, demonstrating the breathes by counting.
“Remember, Black, that’s only a last resort. We won’t be pressing charges unless they force our hand.”
Harry swallowed, trying to drown the lump building in his throat. Luna swayed her head side to side, seemingly contemplating Harry’s words.
Draco had kept his mind occupied throughout the night, chirping about whatever meaningless topic had offended him while Harry simply smiled and agreed, uncaring for their usual fight, if it meant his peaceful evening was disturbed.
“Oh, Harry. You frightened me,” he chuckled. “Yeah, I’m alright. Just not keen for Science with the bat, ya know.”
“And I forgive you! Harry, please, nothing you do could make me hate you!” Sirius ran his hands down to squeeze Harry’s shoulders. “Besides, you weren’t the only one that said things they regret last night. So, I’m sorry as well. I shouldn’t have brought the topic of therapy up like that. I didn’t know you would take the suggestion so bad.”
“Because I still love you,” he finally looked to Remus, staring into his amber eyes. “Because I still want you in my life. Because I wake up every morning wishing you were there next to me.”
The smell of popcorn was the first thing Harry noticed as he entered the lobby. He took a deep breath, closing his eyes as he savoured the enticing scent. There was no line at the ticket counter, just a bored looking worker staring at nothing. He didn’t even look at Harry and Draco as they paused in the middle of the lobby. In the corner sat a small arcade. A boy a bit older than them was aggressively playing the pinball machine. It chimed and pinged each time the boy pressed the buttons.
The day continued much the same, Harry staring forlornly in class, Ron shooting his friend concerned looks, Hermione forever attentive to the lesson. After History was English, then Maths, before finally lunch break.
“I’m worried about it, Draco. You haven’t even spoken to her since we started school. Why now, did you decide to declare that your related to…that!”
Thoughts were racing through Harry’s mind. In such a short conversation, Luna had given him so much to think about. He was still wrapping his head around what she had said.
Harry breathed a laugh, shaking his head. The mood in the room no longer felt suffocating. The light above them flickered, its yellow haze illuminating the bare room, making shadows dance around the small family. After a few moments, Sirius’s smile dropped, and he looked to Harry with a soft, sobered look.
Despite the abundance of money Sirius had hinted at having, he had never wanted to indulge in anything more than the simple life. Or so he had told Harry. This was why instead of moving into his old family home, which was practically a mansion, Sirius had bought the small unit they now lived in. It also explained why they took public transport. That, and Sirius was still working on fixing his bike’s engine.
Ron’s mouth fell open, and he shot Harry a scandalised look. Harry hunched his shoulders, throwing his hands up in a mock surrender.
Harry remained still. From the doorway to his bedroom, Sirius sighed, before slowly pacing away down the hall. It was only once he heard his Godfather banging around in the Kitchen that Harry decided to move from the safety of his blankets.
He patted his hair down, the half damp frizz remaining untameable. Nevertheless, he ran his fingers through the black curls for a few minutes, before giving up. He nodded at his reflection, before heading down the stairs.
The day had turned grey, the clouds overhead blocking the sunlight from reaching the earth. Their driver finally pulled to a stop. Harry peaked out the tinted windows to see a large white building, and a white concrete staircase leading to the wide doors. It was only when Sirius nudged his shoulder, that Harry realised he had stopped breathing.
Draco opened his mouth to launch into a tirade of insults. Before he could start though, the dungeon doors slammed open.
Remus pulled the car to a stop, putting the gear stick into neutral, pulling the handbrake. They were parked outside Harry and Sirius’s house. Remus cut the ignition, before turning to face Harry.
Sirius led them over to the small couch. He shoved Snuffles over, who huffed before resettling his head in Sirius’s lap. Harry stuck to his godfathers’ side, resting his head on the man shoulders. Sirius wrapped his godsons’ shoulder and ran his other hand through Snuffles fur. The family sat together like that, watching a wheel spin on the telly.
“Right, yes, well… there wasn’t anything else to do and all my friends are out of the country, so I thought I would try something new. It seemed like it would be easy!”
He was in the process of deciding whether to go after the dog or bolt from the area when he heard a small voice and booming barks.
Harry put his head down. His chest had already been brimming with anxiety about the thoughts of this summer, and Malfoys words succeeded in increasing the panic within him.
At the end of the long court hallway, stood the Dursleys. Aunt Petunia, still skinny, pale, long-nosed, wore a frumpy brown dress that probably costs a fortune but looked like a potato sack. Her lips were pursed, like she had just stepped in dog shit on the way to court. Her pinched eyes were cold.
Hermione smiled at his words. Ron only managed a pained whine which Harry took to mean he was happy.
A knock banged against their front door. Sirius jumped, his hands tightening their grip on Harry’s shoulders.
Draco rolled his eyes, his body angled away from Harry. He looked his usual snarky, unpleasant self, except Harry could now see the amusement twinkling in his eyes and his quirked lip.
Shit, Harry thought. This wasn’t ok. He hadn’t expected this to go on any longer than a day. Now it was an indefinite hearing? He wanted to drive back home and crawl under the covers of his bed, taking Snuffles with him for company.
There was something within Harry that wanted to refuse telling Malfoy anything. It was a deep fear that was sunk within him after too many of his Uncles threats. How could he tell this man all the moments of pain he endured? How could he be trusted not to let Harry get hurt by them again? But, Harry knew his life with Sirius was depending on him and the truth of his life with the Dursleys. He knew, if he didn’t speak up, then this was just another victory his Uncle had over him, and the thought of that infuriated Harry.
“Oh, I’m sorry I’m a little bit stressed about the fact that I may not be living here in a weeks’ time!” The sentence started through gritted teeth but escalated into sharp words.
Harry squinted his eyes, unsure where the conversation was going. Sirius was buzzing with a chaotic energy that Harry had become accustomed to.
On the Friday afternoon, Harry overheard a one-sided phone conversation between Sirius and Mr. Malfoy. Despite talking in hushed tones, Harry could hear the stress in Sirius’ voice.
Sure enough, in the window was Sirius, waving frantically, smirking at them. Harry couldn’t help snort at the sight. Taking a deep breath, Harry nodded, bidding goodbye to Moony before exiting the car. The door creaked as it shut, the metallic ring sounding through the air.
“Harry, come on, look at me,” soft words were being spoken in his ear. A hand was pressed to his chest, just over his heart, and instead of panicking, he found the gentle touch comforting.
He stopped. Dread filled his stomach, and his heart began racing. It sounded as though someone was hurt.
The air outside had a faint chill. Harry could feel goose-bumps scatter across his skin, and he saw Luna cross her arms to ward against the chill. They walked a few metres up the street before Luna waved to a car; a beat up, bright orange, punch buggy. Harry snickered a little at the sight of it. It was exactly the type of car he expected for someone like Luna.
Harry’s favourite thing about Sirius’s room was the number of photos he had. Hanging on the wall was a photo of a younger Sirius, with his brother and two cousins, standing in front of a school. On top of his dresser was a framed photo of Sirius in a field, arm slung over the shoulder of Harry’s father and what he now recognised as a younger Professor Lupin. Other pictures of the group hung over the mirror as well, some even featuring Harry’s mother. Her red hair was unmistakable. Harry’s favourite though, was the framed photo of a baby Harry resting on Sirius’s hip. It was placed on his godfather’s bedside table and Harry had nearly cried the first time he saw it. It was the first baby photo he had ever seen of himself.
Malfoy rose from his seat. He opened his desk draw and pulled out a small file. He began flicking through it, content to ignore Sirius.
“This isn’t a case you can win, especially if the family Mr. Potter has been living with for the past 13 years refuse to sign over guardianship. I am sure they would do a much better job at parenting the boy than you, anyway. Its best you give up.”
Those were the words practically shouted by Professor Snape as he entered the classroom in his usual dramatic fashion. Behind him the door slammed, and it took everything in Harry not to flinch from the noise. He refused to give the greasy git the satisfaction of his fear.
The thought remained with him though, and for the first time in his life, Harry wished he could go shopping for new clothes.
Despite his experience with being lost, this was the first time he had been separated form Sirius in a crowded area. Harry could feel his breathes coming out shorter and he felt the swell of panic bubble in his chest. Due to his short stature, Harry was unable to look over the height of the adults surrounding him to spot his godfather. Harry knew the man couldn’t be far off as he had been next to Harry only a moment ago. Harry thought about calling out for Sirius but was unsure he would be loud enough over the sound of traffic and travelling footsteps.
The television blasted a tune that drew Harry’s attention. On the screen, an animated show was playing, its opening credit filled with robots and explosions.
Harry stood still, his heart beating loudly in his ears. Then a bubble of relieved laughter escaped his chest. He couldn’t stop the smile spreading across his face as he shook his head. His eyes felt damp, and for reasons he couldn’t understand, he felt like crying.
Eventually, the ceremony ended. Students were given their timetables and were rushed out the door to get to their classes. Ron and Hermione were flocked by the other Gryffindor’s, all offering words of congratulations.
Most adults see him as the savior of the wizarding world, but for Sirius he has always just been Lily and James' child, his godson, which is what I wanted to show in this chapter.
Draco was still staring at Harry with a puzzled expression. He couldn’t figure out why the other boy had lied for him. Harry was actively avoiding eye contact with him, focusing on the two men who had started packing up the paperwork.
“Honestly, I agree with Harry,” Hermione conceded, mouth pinched like she had swallowed a lemon. “He hasn’t said anything to us all day, and that’s never happened. Especially to Harry.”
Remus sat with his head in his hands. His breathes were shallow. He let out a hollow, near hysterical laugh.
Draco couldn’t help the twinge in his chest at those words, nor could he hide the concerned expression cross his face.
Harry glanced towards the couch, shifting on his feet as he decided whether to sit on something that looked so expensive.
“No, I’m sure it wasn’t,” Sirius scoffed. “But, Harry, I need you to know not everyone is like your Uncle. And nothing is going to happen to me. I have been like this my whole life, so I would know. You don’t need to worry about me. That’s not your job. It’s my job to worry about you.”
Potter let out a frustrated noise. He ran his hand threw his hair, managing to make it even messier than usual.
“Please don’t press charges against my relatives,” Harry spoke, drawing the attention of everyone in the room. “I’m barely making it through this court case, I don’t want to go
“It was stupid,” he murmured. At Luna’s silence, he kept speaking. “I, uh, haven’t been sleeping well. I don’t know if Draco told you about what happened, but Sirius getting custody was pretty … important. I wasn’t all that safe with my relatives.”
The drive to the court room was awkward and stifling. The music played on the radio was irritating. The driver was stoic and uninterested. Any other time Harry would be happy the trip to their destination had ended. But not this time.
Harry quickly ran into his godfathers’ room at the end of the hall, trying not to slip on the wooden floor.
Potter spoke barely above a whisper and the words cut off on the last syllable, but Draco heard him. The dark-haired boy picked at Snuffles fur, eyes trained away from Draco. Still he could see Potter peaking at him every now and then.
Harry frowned, stunned. Draco hadn’t said his name like that since the start of the summer. Before he could ask what the other boy’s problem was, Sirius and Mr. Malfoy rounded the corner. They walked to the boys with long strides.
His voice was quite but strong. Immediately, Sirius paused. His eyes zeroed in on his godson, filled with panic and worry. He hovered in the centre of the room, swaying slightly towards Harry with his hands on his hips.
“I’ve already lost to much of my life trying to forget you, Pads. I know now you are all I will ever want.”
“But I yelled at you,” Harry shook his head, trying to break Sirius’s hold on him. “I said horrible things about you.”
Guilt ate at Harry, turning over in his stomach and making him feel ill. His head was swimming. He took deep breaths hoping it would calm the haze of adrenaline that had washed over him. He watched as Malfoy finished tying his shoe laces. Malfoy stood and headed to the closed door. His hand was turning the handle when Harry spoke.
“I promise, Mr. Potter, my son will be on his best behaviour as a guest in your house,” Mr. Malfoy said. “I believe it would be good for him to get out more and I would like that to happen someplace I can keep my eye on him. Even if just for a day.”
The floor dropped out from under Sirius. He stumbled into a particularly large stack of papers, causing them to topple over, sending papers flying everywhere.
Sirius was panting by the end of the tirade. His throat was sore from his hoarse shouts and he was unable to control the shaking of his hands. He closed his eyes and disappointment washed over him. He was upset with the situation, and with Malfoy, but mostly himself and his outburst. He wanted to punch Malfoy and keep screaming at him.
Basically, I am no longer living with the Dursleys. I haven’t been for about four months now. I swear, I meant to tell you, but with everything happening at once, I just didn’t know how to. The past couple of weeks have been really intense. My godfather Sirius Black has taken me in after he got out of prison, but I swear he is totally safe and nice! He went through all these checks and we did meetings through social services and its totally fine. I just never told you guys because I guess I thought it would make everything disappear. Anyway, yesterday we had a guardianship hearing against the Dursleys, and Sirius won! I never have to go back to the Dursleys Ron! Its insane.
That got Malfoys attention. He closed the file and placed it face down on the desk. His eyes roamed over Sirius, who didn’t shy away from the other man’s piercing gaze. His suit jacket was placed over his chair, leaving the Malfoy in his white button up and black vest. He fiddled with the cuffs of his sleeve as he mulled over what Sirius said.
“What? No!” Harry defended. He glanced towards the door, listening as footsteps retreated down the hallway. “…are you messing with me?”
“I don’t care! You can’t go back to treating us the way you were. I am not saying you have to be friends with them, though that would be ideal, just that you need to stop the insults.”
Harry picked at the sandwich Sirius had made for him, unwrapped it again, noted it was plain peanut butter, and felt pain stab at his stomach. He didn’t take a bite.
Harry nodded, his stomach doing flips despite the car being stopped. He was unsure why the man’s words were making him nervous. There was something in the way that he was checking in with Harry, making sure he was comfortable with Sirius and his relationship that was so strange yet so reassuring at the same time. Never had the Dursleys thought to check if he was comfortable. Not even when he was a child, sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs in the middle of winter with only a thin blanket. He had merely been expected to adapt. Which he did. Now though, he had a say in what happened in his own home.
Harry thought about how hard it would be for him to that after calling the man Professor Lupin for two years. Instead of telling Sirius that, he simply nodded.
The first thing Sirius did when they entered the threshold was pull Harry into a tight hug. He squeezed the boy with all the strength he possessed. Harry took a few moments to respond, but eventually he reacted with a hug just as fierce, wrapping his arms around Sirius, tucking his head into his Godfathers chest. they stayed like that, uncaring of the time that passed.
“Do you think I care what you can pay? I am the most sought-after lawyer in Britain, Black. I don’t need to take on any case for the money.”
Before he could answer, Snuffles let out another small boof, as though agreeing with Sirius’s question. Sirius laughed and ruffled his ears.
Her gown flowed behind her as she walked, the fabric glistening in the light. Harry hung back to avoid stepping on it, conscious of the fact he was underdressed in his blue jeans and black dress shirt.
“It was my fault. When I went to prison, I was in a really dark place. I was mourning your parents and I was so angry at myself for being stupid enough to believe Pettigrew. I just couldn’t handle seeing Remus. The guards would tell me when he had come to visit, and I just couldn’t let him see me like that, so each time, I just refused visitation. Eventually he stopped coming.”
As if knowing his presence was acknowledged, Snuffles let out a soft boof, wagging his tails as he sniffed the new man in front of him.
Harry noticed Ron’s stare was stuck on the very person Harry was looking for. Standing at the doors of the Great Hall, Draco Malfoy stood in the centre of his Slytherin friends, an amused smirk adorning his face as he listened to Pansy Parkinson prattle on.
Harry felt numb. They day was moving fast, and he was struggling to keep up with everything that had happened. He couldn’t remember much of anything after the judge spoke, just that Sirius had hugged him tighter than he had ever been held before.
Just as he’d given up hope and was planning on re-entering the abandoned classroom he’d just exited; Harry spotted a sight of familiar silver hair. Squinting to get a better look, at first, Harry was sure he had spotted Draco. However, upon closer inspection, Harry noticed the blonde locks were much to long be Draco’s, and the person they belonged to, wore a rumpled skirt and bright blue knee-high socks.
“Whatever do you mean, cousin?” Mrs. Malfoy smirked, glancing sideways at Sirius. “Now Harry, Draco is in his room if you would like to head up. Sirius and Mr. Lupin will be joining Lucius and I in the parlour before dinner.”
Instead, Sirius wrapped his arms around his godson, and slowly rocked them both, hushing Harry as more tears escaped his eyes.
“So… you and Professor Lupin?” Harry sounded sceptical. It wasn’t something he ever thought he would ask.
Harry’s eyes squinted, and he looked to Professor Lupin, shocked to find the man looked as lost as Sirius. Professor Lupin didn’t respond to Sirius. Instead his mouth had fallen open and looked to be struggling for words.
‘Huh,” Sirius said, before shaking his head in a manner resembling a dog. “Oh, uh, yeah, I’m fine, Harry. Sorry.”
“What the game here, Malfoy?” He crossed his arms. “After the shit you put us through in High School, there’s no way you’ve actually became tolerant of my relationship with Remus.”
Malfoy didn’t sound as though he were asking for a favour. His back was straight, and he looked down at them both.
September 1st meant a lot of things. It was the end of summer where the heat filled days slowly began to fade. It was the beginning of fall, when leaves would begin to brown as children counted down the days to Halloween. And, each year without fail, it was the first day of classes at Hogwarts. Now to Harry, who usually looked forward to this day all summer long, September 1st was a day to be celebrated. Since his First Year, on the 1st of September he would rush through his morning routine, before running from Number 4 Private Drive to the bus stop he knew would take him home to Hogwarts.
“No! I refuse to let those fuckers get a cent after the shit they put Harry through! Also, could you imagine if Harry found out? That I practically bought him, like a goddamn animal!” Sirius shook his head and spoke through gritted teeth. “It was never an option.”
Harry’s eyes started to sting. He removed the album from the box, slowly opening it to the first page. Sure enough, a picture of his parents smiled at him, his father’s hair a mess just like his own, and his mother’s dimpled smile aimed at him. Next to his father stood a much younger Sirius in a leather jacket.
“Has something happened to upset you, Harry?” Luna asked, her wide, unblinking eyes were boring into Harry’s soul.
before he could find the lead, noticed dirty dishes in the sink and set about cleaning them. After that, he headed upstairs to help Sirius with the washing, but got halfway up the stairs when he remembered he was about to walk Snuffles. He never did find the dog lead.
Sirius was the first to jump out of the car, beating The Driver outside. Throwing Sirius a filthy look, The Driver walked to Harry’s door, holding it open for the boy to exit. Harry tried to smile at the man, but it closer resembled a grimace. Sirius stuck his tongue out to the driver, before opening the passenger front door with a flourished bow. A deep sigh sounded from inside the car, and Remus Lupin stepped out, wearing black slacks and a white button down. It was the nicest thing Harry had ever seen his teacher in. Rising to his full height, Remus smacked Sirius upside the head, before straightening his shirt and making his way to the stairs where Harry was standing.
The room fell silent. Harry couldn’t move. His eyes were wide, staring at The Judge, waiting for him to say ‘sike!’. His grip on Sirius’s arm had only tightened, but instead of pushing him away, his godfather laid his hand over Harry’s. The pair stared with wide eyes, waiting for man to continue.
“Its standard. You don’t have anything to be worried about. He just needs you to answer some questions,” Sirius voice was strained.
“Very well. Get your textbooks out and turn to page 664. If you were foolish enough to have forgotten your textbook this afternoon, you will be seeing me after class.”
By the third week, Sirius was intent on talking about the issue. Harry was keen to avoid such a talk. This had resulted in their first ever fight, which occurred the night before Harry’s first day of school.
“Prove it then. Promise me you won’t tell Granger and Weasley the second they get back. That way they won’t be able to talk you out of being friends with me.”
“Will he?” Harry whispered. He looked at his socked feet, one of his toes sticking out through a hole.
Sirius stopped walking, staring at the back of Lucius head. He blonde realised he had stopped and paused, shooting an exasperated look at the other man.
Harry couldn’t help how wet his laugh came out. It sounded like a sob, and Sirius quickly shoved Snuffles from his lap, standing up to approach Harry.
Finally, Sirius noticed the other person in their presence. When his eyes caught onto the man, Sirius’ body stilled. He no longer looked at Harry. Instead his eyes were locked on Professor Lupins. Sirius’s expression was harrowing, and Harry was taken aback by the heartbreak that crossed through his godfathers’ eyes.
So, one might ask why despite having the best summer of his life, three overly supportive, amazing best friends, and a loving, caring guardian Harry was in a sour mood the morning of his first day of Fifth Year? Well, he couldn’t quite figure it out himself.
He walked along the street path from the school into the city. He watched as more and more people passed by him the closer he got to the city, the unmistakable smell of thick air growing stronger. The walk only took 15 minutes before he arrived at his destination.
“Right, well, Father didn’t trust me to be in the house by myself anymore,” Draco avoided eye contact with Potter by examining the small rip marks on his pants.
His bedsheet covered up to his waist and one of his legs remained uncovered. He glasses were off, and he stared blankly at the dark ceiling. He could hear Sirius snoring down the corridor. It had become a habit for Harry to wait until the other man went to sleep before opening his bedroom door a crack. The door being shut caused him to think of locked rooms and bruises. Harry slept better knowing the door was open.
Draco smirked. Harry walked past him and into the cinemas, knowing without looking Draco would follow him.
Sirius stood from the couch, and Harry was relieved to see he still wore his plain black shirt and jeans. However, he did notice red and purple marks scattered across his godfathers’ neck. Gross, he thought.
It was a few minutes later he heard his bedroom door creak open. He stayed facing the white wall. He heard the patter of Snuffles footsteps and his bed shook as the large dog leapt up to be beside him. He stuck his cold nose into Harry’s neck drawing a small smile from the boy.
Harry nodded, and let himself be pulled into a debate with Draco about the latest football match. Each had opposing views on who deserved to proceed to the finals. Though they argued, the heat was missing, and for the first time ever, Harry, surrounded by people he knew cared about him, didn’t care if he won or not.
“Eh, you know. Sirius suggested I should talk to someone about everything. Like, properly talk about it with a therapist. I wasn’t too keen on the idea.”
Harry let the subject go, laughing along with Sirius. However, he didn’t miss the thoughtful looked that passed over his godfather the rest of the walk home.
“Just one more concern,” Draco said with a serious, deadpanned expression. “When are you going to do something about that disgrace you call hair, Potter? It’s a mess!”
Harry finally took notice of the room he was in. It was like the top floor of a grand hotel. The entire layout was silver and green, just like the Slytherin house colours, Harry noted unhappily. It gave off the aura of rich and spoilt. A couch that looked more expensive than anything Harry owned was pushed up against a wall, and in front of it, a table fit with a fruit display. An opened door showed off a walk-in wardrobe filled to the brim with designer clothes, and another door led to a bathroom nicer than any spa Harry could ever imagine going to. In the centre of the room was the canopy bed which looked so extravagant, Harry thought it was something only seen in movies.
Harry walked towards the dresser and carefully opened the top drawer. Everything inside it was black. Carefully, Harry sifted through the mess of unfolded clothes until he found what he was after. He quickly tried the black skinny jeans on, shoving his legs into the pants, hopping to pull them up. He quickly walked out of Sirius’s room, shutting the door softly behind him.
Remus slowly nodded. His lips were thinly pressed, as though he was trying to keep himself from crying out. He swallowed deeply.
“Apparently, my parents left me some money when they died.” Potter scrubbed his face. “I only found out when Sirius came around because the Dursleys never told me. When I turn sixteen my legal guardian has access to the accounts. The Dursleys don’t want to give up custody because if they do, they lose access to the money.”
“That isn’t what I am saying, and you know it. I’ll keep Ron from starting shit, if you promise not to antagonise him into starting a fight,” Harry gave him a stern look. “Have we got a deal?”
As he walked out of his room and down the creaky stairs, Harry’s mind stayed on his friends. The idea of not telling them everything that had been going on with him left knots in his stomach. Especially when he thought how he had never even told them of Sirius’s existence.
“It would be a terrible shame for me to turn down an invitation to dinner with the Malfoys, don’t you think, dear Pads?”
Sirius turned to face Harry his movements becoming more exaggerated as he looked to his godson. Sirius brought the dishes scrubbing brush up to his lips to use as a pretend microphone.
Sirius laughed fully, opened mouthed and eyes closed. He had missed how blunt Moony could be. When Remus joined in laughing with him, it felt like everything was normal again. Like everything between them, all the years spent away from each other and the fights they had, meant nothing, and they loved each other again.
Sirius had a mischievous grin across his face, and he glanced to Professor Lupin who was trying to hide his own amusement.
Harry started to protest, but Sirius shot him a look that told him it would be useless. He laughed at Sirius’s determination, before running up the stairs to the bathroom.
Harry threw his head back. He tried to keep himself from smiling, but he wasn’t completely successful. He went to the fridge and pulled out a carton of juice.
“Shall we start?” Mr. Malfoy said with a drawl. He sounded bored. Like he would rather be doing anything but this.
Harry shrugged. His eyes felt puffy and he wondered if there were bags under them. He had stayed up late last night, watching the light shine from Sirius room through the cracks of his closed bedroom door. He fell asleep shortly after the light finally shut off around 1 AM.
They walked across the street and set themselves on a table outside the small shop. Snuffles flopped to the ground when Harry sat down, his tail slowly wagging whenever he brushed his hands over the hound’s head. His fur was scraggly, and it felt like he had rolled in sand.
“Thank you so very much for letting me join you tonight,” Luna smile was bright. “Would you like a ride home?”
Malfoy and his friends snickered as Ron’s face grew red. They turned around, smirks adorning their faces. Hermione rolled her eyes and Harry shot his friend a thankful and sympathetic look.
“I think it is best we meet every day leading up to the hearing, Black. There is no such thing as being too prepared.”
“Well, like I said, I haven’t been sleeping, and, uh, last night Sirius wanted to talk about how bad my nightmares had gotten, which I didn’t… I don’t want to talk about,” Harry cleared his throat. “And then he said, um… he said I should see a therapist. I kind of went off after that.”
Draco tilted his head. He did remember that game. He had been making fun of Potter’s lack of hygiene, claiming he had got it from his mother, when Potter threw the first punch. Draco’s father had demanded Potter be cut from the team, but Dumbledore claimed Draco was just as much at fault. Turns out, they had been in front of the teachers stands when the fight started. In the end neither of them was suspended from football. However, they each had to serve two weeks detention.
The fight left Draco along with his breath. Instead, he just grumbled to himself, cursing the branch that had tripped him. The dog flopped to the ground and curled up next to Potter, putting his head in the boy’s lap.
The longer he thought, the more he realised he had seen Luna before at school. On the way to classes, eating lunch, even sitting on the grand stand watching soccer. Harry had never noticed, or most likely never cared enough to, but she had always been alone.
Then, Harry remembered he was facing a guardianship trial which would soon decide his future, and he felt stupid for worrying about something as dumb as holding hands with Malfoy. There were much more pressing matters demanding his anxiety and stress.
Sirius was unsure if he could leave Harry so soon after gaining guardianship of the boy. The day had been slow. The mood in the house quite and dimmed. Harry was content to stare at the tv in his Pj’s, unmoving, while Sirius pottered about the house, half-heartedly cleaning without any results. It was only when he wiped the kitchen counter for the fifth time Harry had enough.
“Heavens, no. I’m afraid I just don’t like you like that, Harry,” she looked at Harry like she was afraid she had offended him.
The wallpaper was pealing throughout the entire house, the floorboards creaked with practically every step, and dust had covered the place. When Harry saw it for the first time, he had nearly cried from happiness.
Harry did as directed, and slowly sunk down on the grass strip next to Snuffles. He gently reached his hand over to dog’s large black head and gingerly ran his fingers over his ears. Harry repeated the movements until the dog eventually lifted his head to look at Harry.
Finally managed to write Remus into the story. Hope you enjoyed the chapter, there will be more of him to come!
“God bless the last day of school,” Sirius chuckled, running his hands across his face, rubbing his eyes.
“Well, he said that it was possible we could talk about seeing each other again, given your approval.”
Harry looked to Draco. The other boy simply shook his head, telling him to drop it. So, Harry nodded along to whatever Luna said, letting her explain the complex ideas behind the film.
“Are you even listening to me? I am pissed, because I know the second Granger and Weasley are around, you’re going to go stop pretending to like me and we will go back to being enemies!”
Anger swelled in Harry’s stomach. How dare Malfoy judge his home. Afterall, the boy was probably raised in a haunted mansion filled with dark, incriminating relics. Harry was about to politely tell Malfoy he could go fuck himself and leave when Sirius spoke.
He stood beside Draco with his shoulders slumped. Dirt covered both their clothes and skin. The scratch marks on Harry’s face were bright red and his glasses were askew. Draco stared at the boy beside him. His eyes were wide, like he couldn’t believe the conversation they had walked into. From Potter’s reaction today, he knew this case was serious, but to hear discussions about pressing charges cemented everything he suspected about Potter’s relatives. It seemed all the tension expelled from Potter that afternoon had returned. The boy’s eyes were sunken, and his face was gaunt.
This chapter is not the best but I wanted to give you another update, so I apologise if its terrible.
“Did you catch the latest Premier league game, Potter?” Draco asked, his voice lowered to keep from interrupting the adults.
“You two know each other?” Harry asked, breaking the depressing staring competition the two had going on.
Harry’s breath was erratic. His shoulders tense. He clenched his eyes shut and tried to supress the overwhelming urge he felt to start sobbing. He dropped his head into his hands rubbing the base of his skull where a deep headache had been ailing him all morning. Snuffles continued barking in the backyard.
“I don’t know if anyone told you,” he started. “But before your parents died, they made me your guardian.”
Harry showered quickly enough that steam barely started to form in the bathroom. He towelled himself off, before wrapping the towel around his waist. Then, he crossed the hallway to his room in search of clothes.
“You act like that means something. Honestly, me hanging out with her at school would mean social suicide. Pansy and Blaise would never let me live it down,” He shook his head. “I’m sorry, Potter, but we can’t all be bleeding hearts like you.”
Harry turned his attention back to his friends, noting he was flanked either side by Ron and Hermione, who were waiting for his response with puzzled eyes. Hermione frowned like she was unaware there was even a problem to begin with. Harry blinked before looking at Ron.
The shock of the situation kept Malfoy from acting immediately as he watched Potter disappear from his view. Instead, he played the interaction through his head, uncomprehending to what had caused Potter to react so bizarrely. It was a large booming bark that broke him out of thought. He noticed Potter’s beast barking at him, its eyes focused on Draco as though rousing on him.
Draco thought about lying, about making some grand story up that made him sound cooler. But, as he thought to what Potter had told him, he realised the other boy would not care for his lies.
Silence hung between them. Then, Lucius sighed, before turning to face Sirius. His eyes looked bored, like he was about to explain to a child why it was unbecoming to throw a tantrum in public.
Honestly, feels like my writing just keeps getting crappier, so sorry about that. I'd like to use the excuse I rushed the latest chapters, but you may have clued in to the fact that all my work is rushed.
“Alright,” Sirius sounded disappointed. If Harry were to look up, he would see the concern simmering in his godfathers’ eyes. “Have a good day at school, Prongslet.”
“I guess I’m worried they wont like him, or something. And our whole friendship they have been helping me deal with the Dursleys, this time, I just. I thought I could do it without them. To show them… I don’t know, that they didn’t… I don’t know.”
“I’ve got one flat white and two hot chocolates,” the waitress was standing at their table balancing a tray with three mugs.
Harry and Remus shared a look behind Sirius’s back before making their way up the marble staircase. The building became more intimidating as they approached. The pillars lining the walkway looked like Greek ruins before they became ruins, white and unchipped. When they finally arrived at the top of the stairs, Sirius straightened his shirt and brought a hand up to knock. Before his fist could connect, however, the doors were thrust open, startling both Harry and Remus.
And just like that, all the worry Draco and Sirius and Remus had prevented Harry from feeling, returned. A tight, iron grip grasped Harry’s stomach, making him feel ill. All he could do was nod, bidding Sirius goodnight as the man left the room, unable to evade the anxiety coursing through his mind.
Harry was silently thankful for that. He was surprised Mr. Malfoy had managed to get in touch with his old babysitter. He had no idea she had paid that much attention to him, or that anyone on Private Drive cared enough to go against the Dursleys for Harry.
Harry stood by the edge of the staircase, waiting for his chance to escape. Sirius looked to him, panic in his eyes, before looking back to Remus.
Sirius opened and closed his mouth. Dread was filling him. He wasn’t even sure how to bring up the topic with Remus, let alone explain everything that had been going on with Harry’s home life.
When they ate, Harry was seated beside Draco and Sirius, listening as Remus and Mrs. Malfoy discussed the gaps in Hogwarts curriculum. Mr. Malfoy sat at the head of the table, sipping red wine from a crystal glass. When he noticed Harry looking, he sent the boy a small, barely-there smile, before tucking into his dinner with stiff etiquette. Harry shot a look to Sirius, watching the other man stare smitten at the teacher as he rattled off the topics he was wished to introduce to his classes.
