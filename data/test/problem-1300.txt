Harry groaned as he felt another tug on his hair. He had stayed at Ron and Hermione's, giving in to their insistence and was now awake an hour earlier than normal because Ginny had come over and had wanted to see him.
don't make it sound heartless, Kingsley. It
"What's wrong?" Harry's worried tone makes Draco's heart flutter.
"Why not?"
His ambition to be an auror did not seem as thrilling after the war. Maybe because he was tired of putting himself in danger or maybe he didn't like the paperwork or following orders but he didn't want to become one anymore. So when McGonagall presented him the oppurtunity, he took it immediately.
The whole room laughs at George's ridiculous act except Hermione.
The room the woman had directed him to was white, a sharp smell of antiseptic lingering in the air.
The door swings open and Potter invites him in with a little smile though it doesn't reach his eyes. He still looked kinda off. "I hope you recieved my letter?" Potter asks him. Draco nods his head in affirmation and proceeds to sit on the couch. Potter doesn't ask him for tea today, neither does he look as interested in teaching as he had done the previous times.
Blaise rolls his eyes at that and Pansy snorts.  "Like that'd stop you." Draco glares at them and they finally shut up.
"Y-you don't understand, Mr. Potter. He- the man, he's dangerous." Farley stuttered; his eyes wide with fear.
"How unfortunate, Mr. Farley. You see, this is a very valuable piece of information we, Aurors, need to solve a case and I have a gut feeling that you can give it to us." Harry smiled lightly.
Draco sighed; it still didn't explain why the book was here.
"Pardon?"
1. Magical traces
) Potter. Draco ignored her again and looked at the moving picture infront of him.
, Kingsley, and you want me to go to a fucking reception? We have hardly any lead in this case and-"
Blaise sighs. "You and your gut feelings." He rolls his eyes but moves towards the kitchen nonetheless.
"I-it kinda itches." Draco whispers, he hadn't looked at Potter. He was staring at his bare arm.
"Nothing's wrong, Malfoy. Look here's the bill." Draco frowned but didn't push it. If Potter didn't want to tell him then he won't act desperate.
"Okay. Is there any spell you can perform?"
"Listen, Malfoy." Harry spoke again, Malfoy's head turned towards him. "I uh- you know that we are supposed to work together, right? And it seems that this case will take a long time to solve so I'd say we are stuck together for a while. What do you say about us starting over? I mean get to know each other the way we are now not what we were in the past." Harry said.
Harry gave a soft knock on Shacklebolt's door, and received a loud "Come in!" in Shacklebolt's rich, heavy voice. He entered the brightly lit office with a deep breath.
easily and there was a criminal to be caught right infront of him.
"So? Would you like to dance with me?" Harry asked again, his hand still held out.
"And why in the Salazar's name would you invite him to your birthday?"
Harry saw Smith's eyes widen. "The man was there? The wizard?" He asked in a hushed tone as if the evil wizard was listening to them. Harry didn't like it, it reminded him too much of people calling Voldemort You-Know-Who.
Harry whipped his wand out, ignoring the nervous gasp Farley gave. He didn't point it at the shopkeeper though. All he did was twirl it lightly in his fingers.
Draco's mind supplied.
Harry nodded and he felt a knot in his chest loosen. If Malfoy stayed true to his word then maybe this case won't be as miserable as Harry had thought.
Draco was stunned at Kingsley's little speech. Life was too short already, why would they want to waste it for the Wizarding World? The same Wizarding World who doesn't give a single fuck about them? None of them would sacrifice themselves for the Aurors. Then why would they do that? It didn't make any sense to Draco.
"No, it was f-fine." Potter nodded and smiled in reply.
Kingsley nodded seriously. "This is a very important and arduous case, Harry. It is to be kept confidential from everyone. And by everyone, I mean
He couldn't help the flutter in his heart when Potter looked him in the eyes without loathing, couldn't help the flip of his stomach when Potter smiled at him genuinely.
Draco shook his head in response. "It's confidential, I can't tell you the details."
~~~●●●~~~
"You're a lifesaver." He muttered to his best friend around a sip of the liquid.
Potter has just turned the street towards the apparition point when I shriek as loud as I can, "Potter!" He stops and turns around with a frown on his face. I stop infront of him, breathing hard.
(Draco's POV) ~~~●●●~~~(Draco's POV)
Draco does. After what feels like hours, he feels the cooling sensation in his heart. He says the incantation, does the wand movement and opens his eyes.
With a huge sigh Draco apparated back to the Manor, the weight of everything that had taken place at the Ministry falling heavily on his shoulders all at once.
His face was less pointy now, more angular; the high cheekbones and sharp jaw made it rather attractive. His eyes were the same grey they had been at school but they held something different now; they were gentler and kinder, less cruel. And it was true, Malfoy wasn't outright rude anymore, the occasional sarcastic remark or sneer was there of course but it didn't hold any real loathing.
He was still tracing the body of the snake, careful not to touch its head or the skull. Then he took out his wand.
The man was breathing hard, his stale breath tickling Harry's face but Harry paid it no notice. The words he had just heard were freezing the blood in his veins. Memories flashed behind his eyes, words echoed in his ears; the pain he had experienced that night, the hissed words in his ears,
What the hell was happening? Harry couldn't relate the words together no matter how hard he tried, and it was getting harder to focus as a dull pain started to spread from his legs to his torso.
Harry left the powder and turned his attention to the dagger. His hand reached forward to grab it and take it back to the Ministry with him, so he could investigate it later but just as his fingers wrapped around it, a pop sounded, announcing someone's apparation.
Kingsley sighed, "Take Auror Smith with you. He has investigated the house before. Don't tell him the details of the case, though. Tell him he's there for backup on my orders." With a replying nod Potter left the room.
"Yes, we do have coke. Your order will be here in 20 minutes." The waiter turned around and left.
"Auror Potter should be here any minute. I notified him already." Kingsley spoke again from his position beside the huge mahogany table. Draco had no idea what to say to Kingsley's statement so he only nodded.
He looked up as his mother entered the library.
"But why, Draco? You know how dangerous it is to mingle with the Ministry. They still are not fond of us, even if you are a great healer and work for the betterment of the Wizarding World." Mother argued.
"I see." Draco swallowed hard, his palms were sweating and his mouth was dry.
"These are the terms of the removal." He said, laying the parchment on top of the table I was sitting on.
Thank you to everyone who left kudos! Here's chapter 4 for y'all.. Do tell me what you think. ~Goldhearts♡♡
"I'm not posh!" I swatted at his chest with my left hand.
"Y-yeah." I said, my voice cracking. I drank a bit of the firewhisky in my hand.
"What was that about?" Draco asked Potter as soon as Will left.
Harry pulled out his Ministry identity card and flashed it at the woman.
"I'll take a white wine." Malfoy said.
"Good to see you mate." Ron says.
"As I was saying, your partner will be debriefing you about everything we currently know of this case." Kingsley said. He wrote something on a piece of parchment. Draco wondered if he had made the decision too quickly or if this decision was right at all.
He held up a hand and his Mother stopped talking. "What's done is done, Mother. I will not take back my decision." He said firmly and his Mother nodded with a sigh. "But this wasn't the only thing I wanted to talk about." He continued.
Draco wanted to say that he wasn't
With a nod Draco disapperated to the library Potter had taken him to, his mind remembering that beautiful day, the way the street lights' glow had reflected in Potter's striking green eyes.
Harry slowly turned around to see a dark, cloaked figure, nothing like Smith, entering the room he was in.
Draco covered his hands with the Protective Charm and cast a Filtering Charm on the vial to make sure that any poisonous fumes didn't reach him or Potter.
2. Fingerprints
"No! We aren't telling him about me being involved, okay?" Harry spoke.
"For Merlin's sake! There are people
"Stop pacing, Draco. It will be fine." Pansy says as I pace around the room once again.
"N-no. He'll kill me, he'll kill me and everyone I love!" The man shouted with fear, his eyes flitting behind Harry's large form as though expecting the Dark wizard to appear there any instant.
His time spent with Potter today wasn't as bad as Draco had expected except for the start. He was glad that they had apologized to each other and gotten rid of any misunderstandings. Apologizing had definitely lifted a weight from Draco's heart. Perhaps, if they remained extremely professional, they could get through this case.
Harry folded the letter and sent it off with his new barn owl.
"Nothing." She kept dragging me towards the drinks table.
With a nod Harry disappirated to Kingsley's office, dreading the conversation he would be soon having.
"But it's still my home." Draco says weakly. That's when Harry noticed how badly Draco's hands were shaking and how red his face had turned. Harry realized how very wrong he was and now he had made Draco angry.
Harry's anger flared, he placed his palms flat on the table loudly, leaning forward in Malfoy's face. "Don't tell me what to do, Malfoy. You aren't my boss."
Hermione, bless her, came to Harry's rescue.
"You may go now, Mr. Malfoy. Please be here by morning, if you can make it." Kingsley said. With a nod Draco finally apparated back home.
"It is called a hoodie, Malfoy." Potter says through his laughter. Then he pulls the piece of fabric hanging on his back over his head. Draco can't help the blush that rises on his cheeks when sees Potter's extremely cute ridiculous grin that causes his eyes to sparkle and laugh lines to appear on his face and his face looks so adorable in that hoodie and Draco just wants to- Draco cuts his thoughts with a deep breath before he does something extremely mortifying like kiss Potter and rolls his eyes halfheartedly.
Draco sighed, "This case, Mother. It's driving me insane."
"Yes, now. So tell me Potter, what are your intentions with my friend?" I ask and watch in satisfaction as his eyes widen.
"I believe you were recently on a mission?" He asked and Harry's heart dropped. So, Kingsley knew about the episode. "Yes." He replied trying to keep his composure. Kingsley nodded thoughtfully his gaze far away.
"It's painful. It's like someone's smashing my head with a hammer and breaking my limbs at the same time. I also have trouble breathing and my heart rate slows down. I feel like someone's squeezing my heart." Harry spoke the words reluctantly but after he had said everything, he felt a little lighter. As if a heavy weight had been lifted off his shoulders.
"Yeah, it's a ball. Of course you have to bring someone." Ron rolled his eyes at Malfoy.
Potter seemed confused for a few seconds until his eyes filled with realization.
"Look mate, we all know you are too good for this world but sometimes we got to follow orders." Ron said.
Potter frowned and looked up at Draco then, "Why?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter casts an Aguamenti and sprinkles some water on Dray's face. His eyes twitch and soon open. He blinks and sits up.
She looks at me confusedly but nods, nonetheless. I walk behind her as she leads me to a room with black walls and a huge bed.
The Hufflepuff girl was smiling dreamily at Potter's grinning picture. Draco rolled his eyes at her sappiness. "When will the mighty Sir Shacklebolt grace us with his presence?" Draco asked her but it wasn't the girl who answered.
"How long will it take for me to feel my magic?" He asks feeling both dread and hope waiting for  the answer.
Draco scowled; he was working his hardest to figure out both the potions but it wasn't his fault it was so damn difficult. "No but I'm trying my best." Draco glared at Potter who lifted his hands in an innocent gesture.
"But Draco, my love why-" She started to say but stopped when Draco held up a hand.
"Oh, okay then." Potter put the book back down on the pile of the books they had read already.
Harry, having observed this whole scene wonders why not Narcissa had treated Dobby this way. He could ask her but that would be impolite and he was really curious as to why Mrs. Malfoy had come to talk to him.
Potter raises an eyebrow but raises his wand nonetheless. Bracing himself for what comes next, Draco closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.
"When will I start working? And do I have to come here everyday? You do know that I am a healer, right?" Draco asked, regretting not asking these questions before.
"Let's just focus on the main reason of us being stuck together; the case. We need to solve it and I'd rather do it without you rambling over my head."
"This is Senior Auror Potter. He recently went on a case and captured a very dangerous criminal all alone and then..." The girl started to babble again in a way that clearly told how much she admired (and probably
"Now let's try some wandwork today." Potter says. Once Draco had calmed his face into a normal looking color and Potter had served him tea with a smirk, Potter had cleared the space in his living room.
"Okay? You look amazing. The sexiest guy I've ever seen." She winks at me. "I'd totally date you if you weren't gay." Pansy pouts at me and I roll my eyes.
"I am extremely sorry to call upon you so urgently, Mr. Malfoy but a rather serious matter has occurred in relation to the deal you made with us yesterday. You are requested to come to the Ministry as quick as possible. Please apparate to my office." Shacklebolt spoke in his deep and stern voice.
Draco nods again. "Thank-" He starts to say but Potter interrupts him, "Stop saying thank you. We are here for you to make progress." He says.
"Keep your voice down, Potter! This is a library, for Salazar's sake. And to answer your question, I did find something. I think this book might be useful." Draco held up the thick leather-bound textbook.
(See the end of the chapter for
Kingsley merely shook his head at Harry's question. "I said confidential from
"Ron? Mione? Gin?" Harry turned to them but they didn't seem to hear him either.
And the next words were the last he heard before he slipped into a dark, unknown abyss;
Malfoy stood up, facing Harry with rebellion written clearly on his face. "Neither are you mine. I will tell Kingsley if I want to." He stood up and turned to leave but before he could step away, Harry grabbed Malfoy's arm.
Harry took a deep breath, not looking away from the reassuring expression on Malfoy's face and continued.
"Did you even see what your Patronus was?" Harry asked once they had stopped.
Ignore any mistakes!!
Draco takes a while to think then says, "Probably since I came out of Azkaban."
"Good different?" I flash him my most charming grin.
"So, what's your favourite colour?" Harry asked to break the suffocating silence.
"I wanted to-to talk." Draco whispered, sitting on the couch with Harry but he was far enough that Harry couldn't touch him. Harry nodded in reply to show that he was listening.
With a deep breath Draco signed the parchment with a quill Kingsley provided. As soon as he completed writing his name, a pulse of magic went through his arm and wrapped around his heart like a warm cocoon encasing an insect.
He looked up at Asper but the man was staring at the table with wide eyes, his breathing shallow.
P.S. Ignore any mistakes.
"He is a capable auror and so is Smith. They can protect themselves. Don't you worry, Mr. Malfoy." Kingsley said, his back to Draco as he strode forward.
He hesitantly put his other hand on Malfoy's waist, feeling the slender curve of it, and when instead of pulling away Malfoy just blushed harder, Harry grinned and grew more confident.
Harry chuckles and follows him out the door towards the appirition point to apparate to the Burrow for their weekly getogethers.
"Lumos." Draco whispered, leaning forward with the light illuminated by his wand to observe the thing, whatever it was, more closely.
At first Draco's mind blanks but after blinking at Potter for a few minutes like a moron  he replies in the most embarassing voice possible, " Ummm.. No.."
"Nothing happened to me, Ron. Just a very difficult new case." Harry answered, hiding the case files as Ron sat in front of him. Ron didn't mind him keeping the files away from view; he knew that auror cases were supposed to be confidential.
Harry found who he was looking for sitting in a small wooden chair, eating Chinese take-away from a styrofoam container. The Senior Auror moved forward, his head held high and his face set in an intimidating scowl.
. His senses were so full of Potter; Potter's masculine scent of sandalwood, sweat and something that was uniquely him, Potter's green eyes with specks of freaking gold in them, and Potter's soft hair.
Potter kept pulling and the pain was so much. I felt faint, my head was spinning. It was worse than any Crucio I had ever experienced and then my eyes closed and I fell into oblivion.
Ron's eyes widened, his mouth dropping open as he stood up so quickly that the chair he had been sitting on clattered loudly to the floor. "Tell me you're lying, Harry. Tell me it's just a joke." He said dramatically.
Draco took her warm hand in both of his and rubbed her knuckles, hoping to provide some comfort.
"Well now I am here so shall we get started?" Potter reached in his auror robes and took a roll of parchment out, opening it.
he was the Senior Auror. He was determined, strict and courageous; he wasn't afraid to take risks.
This fuelled his anger even more. He picked up the bronze object and wrapped his fingers around it tightly. Red sparks danced around his palm, wrapping around the goblet like a snake wraps around its prey.
“No, ownership like a Master owning his pup, or an Alpha owning his Omega,” Harry said. “I’m my own person Hermione, but Draco is here to support me, to command me when I need commanding, and both of us are here to punish the other when it’s needed.” He glanced back at Draco, who looked very amused.
“Well… I admit I’m very interested now,” Zabini chuckled.
“Good! So, boys, and my sweet feminine boy, there’s nothing wrong with that,” Loki said, again behind them all, three arms around their shoulders, “shall we all go someplace better and talk? This cave is rather drafty.” He led them towards the stairway. As soon as they stepped onto the steps, however, the four of them were outside. Loki let go of them and stretched as he took in the fresh air, “Ahhh, sweet freedom,” he groaned, “which reminds me…” He looked around and gave a whistle. The scared essence found itself closing in on the four of them. Loki grabbed the thick fog-like creature and rolled as much as he could into a ball, which he threw down the hole. “That should keep your father none the wiser,” Loki said.
“Yeah,” Dean snorted. “It’ll be hot, right Nev?” He smirked at Neville, who looked between them.
“Uhh…” Harry did his best to fake a smile as he, Draco, and Blaise awkwardly moved to sit down.
“Good boy,” Draco said, patting Harry’s butt. Harry chuckled and followed Draco to the bathroom. While Harry cleaned himself, Draco took his time looking through the clothes stored in his summer room, pulling out shirts and pants that looked like they might fit Harry. He found an old sweater that might look good on Harry, as well as a pair of pants that looked as though Harry would wear. Draco thought for a moment about underwear, and smirked to himself as he only pulled out an undershirt for Harry, but no underwear. For socks, he just chose a random pair. Harry stepped out moments later, a towel wrapped around his waist.  He looked at the clothes, which Draco has laid out on the bed, and frowned. “Where’s the underwear?” he asked.
“We have to do something—anything—I can get my father to help!”
When Harry and Draco went the kitchen a couple hours later, they were surprised to see Blaise sitting at the table with Harry’s Uncles. “Hello boys,” Blaise smiled. “You just missed a nice talk, it seems your Uncles are way more reasonable in the morning.”
“Will this be a real wedding?” Loki asked curiously.
“Just that we’re in different Houses, and what the horrible woman is doing to us,” Harry said bitterly as he lifted up his hand.
“I said forget it!” Draco yelled. “Can’t you listen, Weasley!?”
“I’m putting it in, boy,” he said, “take your pants off and bend over.”
“Precisely Harry,” Dumbledore said with a small smile, “you would make wonderful friends there as well, and there are three other Omegas in your year—”
Lilith shook her head, “Lucifer talked plenty about how he wanted you to suffer in agony before your ten years begin,” she said. “However… I don’t believe in such things.” She reached down and pulled out a sleek, long silver knife from her pocket. “Straight for your heart, quick and painless,” she said. “Your ten years will begin before your body hits the floor.”
However, before they could, Harry saw something. Across from Flourish and Blotts was a store with plushies of every side called Omega’s Comforts. In the window was a plushie of a large, beautiful wolf with black fur. Harry swallowed and stared at it, unconsciously stepping towards the store. “Harry?” Sirius said.
“This is the safest place we can be,” Harry said. “I don’t know why but, I feel like we can’t leave each other.”
Looking at his boyfriend, he smiled, “I know it’ll be dangerous… but I know that we’ll be able to do it Draco. I won’t let anything hurt you.”
“Of course, I’m surprised you’re not.”
“You said that we can go,” Harry muttered.
“Don’t start!” she yelled at both of them. “McLaggen, I won’t allow you to talk like that to anyone. And Malfoy, you better not even think of causing any sort of trouble here!”
“Good,” Draco said. “You may leave us now, we still have more to buy.”
“Harry,” Draco breathed. They continued to stare. “Can I…” he began but lost his voice.
“Draco? Yo Draco, you there?”
“What do you mean by was? Did she take your father’s?” Harry asked.
Harry frowned as he thought of McLaggen. “McLaggen,” he said. “A guy who’s a year ahead of us. Along with a Ravenclaw in seventh year as well. From what I guess, I don’t think he or Neville impressed Slughorn sadly.”
she said.
Neville shrugged, “Why not?”
Ron’s face went red. “When did… when did you realize you like guys and girls?” he asked bluntly.
“Look who’s talking,” Remus muttered, but he smiled and locked the door with his wand before embracing his Alpha.
Draco hummed and looked outside, “It’s a nice day, why not I show you around Hogsmeade?”
“Blood and power?” Harry asked.
“But I can’t sing,” Harry frowned. “And… out of all of these, Basics of Curses sounds more interesting.”
Blaise smiled, “My name is Blaise. Right now I’m using the last name Zabini, however, I have many titles. The Lord of Fire. Prince of Darkness and the Inferno. I am Lucifer’s Son, created and born from his womb.”
“Very well, Mr. Riddle,” Professor McGonagall said. “Now, what are you boys here for?”
“I love you two,” Harry mewed.
“Become my scion, reject the Dursleys, you will be a pureblood and my son,” Voldemort said, his hand moved slowly, holding out Harry’s wand. “With your father’s blood, Potter blood, and mine in you, you Harry all I would need is a vial, less than half a liter, of your mixed blood, which I will use as the base of my potion. If you wish to have Draco forever Harry, there will be many obstacles in your path, many hoops you must cross… but I will help you Harry, my son…”
“I’ll show you hard,” Draco growled and pulled Harry to him.
The effect was immediate. His once chalky skin, pure marble and sickly-looking, began to flush, live coming to the skin as though blood was pumping vigorously throughout Voldemort’s system. The cheeks darkened to a healthy, yet still light hue which reminded Harry of the Tom Riddle from the diary. Hair sprouted from the top of Voldemort’s head, growing long and thick, black as night along with white, giving him a salt and pepper hair color, a mature dignified color to an unkempt hair that continued to grow, as though catching up for years lost. His eyes turned dark, becoming a brownish-black, and from where the two slits were, a nose forced itself out, looking remarkably like Harry’s. His long, spider-like fingers reduced, becoming shorter, more human-looking, and though the man’s height stayed the same, his form filled out, looking healthier, not skeletal like the Dark Lord was. When he was done, the Dark Lord stood in front of Harry, looking like a healthy man in his fifties, his hair a mixture of black and white, wild and long and in great needs of a cutting. His robes no longer fit him, and without shame, the Dark Lord disrobed himself as he stood in front of a mirror.
Harry heard a laugh and turned to see his cousin Dudley, a boy his age with equal parts fat and muscle, sitting at the table in the kitchen with a plate of snacks in front of him. Harry did his best to ignore him and turned to make dinner.
“What do you mean?” Mr. Krum asked, confused.
“The starving, Nev,” Niall said. “You don’t need to do that.”
he thought,
“And where is that?” Daphne asked.
“Defense Against the Dark Arts,” Remus said. He gave a smile. “Harry was one of my best students. I even taught him how to cast a Patronus.”
“Good,” Harry answered, although he had a feeling that Mrs. Weasley was asking a far more complex question. “I feel the same as I always have. I wasn’t even scared when I shifted. I didn’t—I didn’t turn into a werewolf like Lupin. I was different, I looked completely different. That part scares me. And the fact that I feel good about it.”
“Such a demanding puppy,” Voldemort chuckled. “But you would like that, wouldn’t you? You want your Alpha to breed you, to make you pregnant with my seed? Make Harry an older brother?”
After several minutes had passed, however, the other students were starting to look at Harry and Niall. The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch the twins’ mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge’s eye than to struggle with “Basics for Beginners.”
“Both of us write letters,” Harry said, looking up. Niall groaned, “Yes Niall, you write one too. I can’t be the only one who keeps them updated. I’ll use Draco’s owl and you’ll use Hedwig. We write about how our lives are going.”
Nagini said, and Harry was grateful for it. He did not want to get into any more trouble than he always was. The Omega ran as fast as he could, doing his best to remember his way out of the forest. His feet pounded on grass and leaves as he jumped to avoid any roots before the ground beneath him started to transition from grass to pavement and the trees around him turned into houses.
To say that the Dark Lord was not flamboyant in his entrances would be akin to saying that peacocks, the natural enemies of rodents, politicians, and law-enforcements as we all know, are not very colorful. So, when the hour warning was up, Harry found his room quite instantly, and quite suddenly, in darkness. Not a speck or glimpse of light was to be found except for red eyes at various heights, degrees, and sizes, all staring at Harry with an unemotional stare that hinted at a murderous danger just behind the surface, like how peacocks look at the law-enforcement or a very disrespectful politician. Harry stood up stiffly, his own green eyes moving rapidly between the sets of red, scared and lost as he tried to find the murderous red eyes that belonged to his Dark Lord.
“M-Mrs. Malfoy, I’m sorry it’s just that I wanted to tend to the garden and—”
“That is still up for debate, your flirting skills need obvious work,” Draco hummed. “But back to
“It’s fine,” Draco said, still sounding stony. “Just show me the gym. Or better yet a track, I feel like running.”
“I hope you like the throne, Sir,” the said as the shadows crept in. Draco Malfoy walked through the shadows, smirking down at Harry. “It will do.”
“So far, it seems that Dumbledore has failed in finding Slughorn. He currently is planning on finding him along with dealing with the Potter boy,” Severus said. “That is all.”
“Then what do you want to know about?”
“Fine,” Lucius Malfoy spat. “I will honor this blasted debt. However, if you even think of hurting my son, I will skin you alive before making sure that Black gets the Dementor’s Kiss.”
“Take these to father immediately,” Draco ordered. Dobby took the papers and bowed before disappearing.
“OW! Mum—you’re not my mother,” Ron said, sitting up abruptly and staring at Draco.
“I’m fine,” Harry said, lying to his uncle. He lifted his hand and stared at the mark. It didn’t feel right. He felt a hot gaze staring at him and turned around quickly to see that it was only him and Uncle Sirius in the room. Frowning, he turned back to the mark and examined it.
“Go, I trust you with Zabini,” Draco said, pulling Harry in for a long possessive kiss. “I just want to make sure my smell is strong on you,” he winked.
“Excellent boys! Excellent!” Blaise cheered, and without thinking, he jumped towards the two of them and kissed their cheeks and hugged them close. “My pretty mages!” he hummed. In the hug, Harry and Draco looked towards each other, their cheeks red as the fire that Blaise casted upon them, their hearts beating fast.
Draco glared at him but sat down. “Anyway Harry,” Theo said, “what did you say about transfiguring your body?”
“Ge—get off of him you idiots! He’ll kill all three of us!” Malfoy panicked, grabbing the nearer flunky and pulling him off. Crabbe and Goyle didn’t move immediately, too stupid to understand orders Harry thought, before jumping up as Draco yelled, “Move you idiots!” He pushed them out of the compartment and gave Harry one final, scared look. “This isn’t over Potter—I’ll get an explanation out of you.” And, with a drop of Harry’s wand and letter, he ran away.
“As if,” she said, “I’m just too busy to care about boys right now.”
“George!” Cedric yelled.
He opened the door and walked into the office. Umbridge was sitting behind her desk, her hands folded. A stack of papers were to her right with a blank piece of paper, and a black quill, in front of her. “Now Mr. Potter, I believe we must talk about your consistent need of telling lies and further traumatizing the students,” she smiled.
“But the threat—”
“And who is it you care for, Harry?”
“Malfoy will throw a fucking hissy fit that’ll what happen,” Ron muttered.
“Wait, five?” Blaise frowned. He started counting on his fingers and shook his head, “No, everyone’s coming. Draco froze and glared at Blaise. “What do you mean by everyone?” he asked, his voice going icy.
To his left was the boy with platinum blonde hair, steel-gray eyes, and pale skin while to his right was a boy with dark skin and hair with bright brown eyes that looked at him with interest. The pink woman stopped talking and the boy to Harry’s left hummed, “Just as Father said,” the boy said, “The Ministry is interfering with Hogwarts.”
“It’s fine,” Harry sighed. “You want to know this stuff too… and she wasn’t here to listen through the door like you.” He turned to Hermione and started to explain. “I don’t know how I’m going to keep it a secret because according to Lupin my lycanthropy is different somehow. I did not shift when I was bitten. I don’t feel any aches or pains, the things he mentioned to me I did not feel. I felt great, better even, and my body changed! In case you didn’t notice I’m two inches shorter somehow! I got muscles now and everything feels weird ok!” Harry stopped himself short, realizing that he was freaking out.
“And yet, it seems that you do not understand the simplest facts of assigned seating, Mr. Potter,” a cold voice said from behind them. Harry did not hear the man enter. He looked around the room to see that the Slytherins and Gryffindors were sitting apart from each other. He held his head high and said, “Of course Professor, I do understand that fact. I was just asking my brother how his first class went and lost track of time, my apologies.” And with as much grace as he can muster, he picked up his back and moved silently to sit with Theo, Blaise, and Malfoy.
“I see,” Blaise nodded, “Still there is so much more missing. Did you know, for example, that you can turn into animals?”
“Harry,” Hermione said warningly, glancing between him and George. George shook his head and looked up at Harry.
“I know you want to show off but please go feed Orion and Lycaon. They must be starving by now and the Diggorys already yelled at us for the one time they ate one of their foxes,” Uncle Sirius said.
“Fuck that… I hated that,” Harry said.
“Then why are you disturbing the staff during your break?” Snape asked.
Harry thought for a moment, “Well if it were me, first of all, I would appreciate any gift my Alpha gives me. With flowers, I would like to know a little bit more, you know, because they have these different means, you see. Like Roses mean ‘I love you’ but the different colors of roses mean a different kind of love.”
“Y-Yes, my lord,” Mr. Malfoy nodded. He looked between his lord and Mrs. Malfoy, unsure of how to proceed. Voldemort saw this and decided to take little pity on them. “Narcissa, you should be relieved to hear that your son is treating mine beautifully. He is truly a strong Alpha, worthy to be courted with my son.”
“My lie?” Harry asked.
“Spiking my food—what? What are you talking about?” Harry demanded.
“Silence Brother Sirius! Sit down Brother Remus! You are not his blood family, and so you will not speak for him,” Mr. Riddle yelled. The men glared at him while Harry began to shake. He glanced around his shoulder and saw a mixture of angry and sympathetic looks, mainly from the Weasleys and Cedric.
“Wake up, my son,” the handsome face of Voldemort said. Harry screamed and jumped up, only to see that he was no longer in his room, but on the floor of Malfoy Manor.
“This is outrageous!” Mr. Krum yelled out. “Throwing men away for having a choice in their children’s education? What kind of monkey circus is running this country?”
Ginny grimaced at Harry and Draco from behind Slughorn’s back. “Well now this is most pleasant, a chance to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. I’ve packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on sugar, and a poor old man’s digestive system isn’t quite up to such things. ...Pheasant, Belby?”
“Some solicitor or helper,” Harry shrugged. “He claims to help Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus getting pregnant… someone sent him and…” He sighed, “if he can help, I sincerely hope he does. They want a child so bad.”
“Wicked,” Tonks said, giving a low whistle.
“Oh no,” Sirius said. “No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemort’s orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he died, he got too far in then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don’t just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It’s a lifetime of service or death.”
“Then you would have to go into their fantasies,” Daphne laughed. “Although personally, I would rather kiss a hippogriff than do that.”
Harry nodded and took a deep breath while Blaise showed Draco the spell. Harry held his hand on his opposite shoulder and stared at the middle maw between the three heads. All three centered on Harry, no longer moving wildly and the monster slithered towards him. He swiped his hand from his shoulder, fully extending it and screamed,
Goyle’s look of surprise changed quickly to a relaxed, oblivious look. His eyes seemed to droop, and a silly smile grew on his face. “I am really angry at you Goyle,” Draco said. “You’ve harmed my boy, my precious, beautiful boy. Harry is mine, Goyle, and now I have to make sure that nobody is stupid enough to try what you’ve done again.” He shook his head. “It would have been fine if this happened during the game, after all, Harry is too good a flyer for your idiotic reflexes to hit… but after it was over? When he was celebrating? You’ve really messed up Goyle.”
“Yeah, he only has classes in the morning,” Neville nodded. Draco looked between the two confused and frowned slightly.
“Not another word from you boy or I will get out the belt,” Uncle Vernon warned. He pushed the door behind Harry closed and grabbed Harry but the scruff of his neck. The fat man dragged Harry to the kitchen and threw him towards the oven. “Cook!” he barked. “And be quick about it! There’s a new episode of my show on tonight and you will be damned if I have to miss it because of your idiocy, you freak.”
“It’s too big,” Draco muttered. “It is in the perfect place but is too tall,” He scowled and pushed off Harry’s shoulder to look at the man, “How much to adjust?”
“I would never touch that woman,” The Devil said with a look of disgust. “She was a means of making the boy.”
Mr. Malfoy scoffed. “That would never happen, my son would never do anything to earn Umbridge’s ire.”
“I am,” Harry nodded.
“You bastard!” Ron yelled. He ran up to the two of them, his hand tightening into a fist, and before Harry could stop him, the taller teen swung his arm, punching Draco’s cheek. Draco didn’t flinch. He glared at Ron and punched him back, the lankier teen falling.
Nagini hissed, as though it was obvious. She slithered towards Harry and watched as he pulled weeds out.
Harry ignored her and stared at Draco, their eyes meeting. “I would like to talk with you Malfoy… if you would?” he asked politely, almost submissively.
“What’s the matter, Harry?” Niall asked.
“And how do we know that he’ll do that?” Ron demanded.
“Young love is strong, yes,” Dumbledore spoke for the first time, “and I suggested and encouraged that Connor kept the memories of you, Harry, however I had no authority.”
Harry could feel Niall’s anger radiate from the Alpha’s body, but he kept him leveled as Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry knew that Umbridge was looking for any sign of weakness, and the Omega refused to give her any. He did not show weakness in Durmstrang with the other boys, and he refused to show it now. So he kept his and Niall’s legs together as they continued to cut into their own skin, anchoring both himself and Niall.
It amused Voldemort immensely at how easy it was for him to slip into the populous unknown. They all knew him as a hideous monster. That was what he looked like during the First War, and what he looked like as he invaded the Ministry for that fake prophecy. So it was easy for the handsome Alpha to walk around unnoticed.
Draco backhanded her. “You insufferable cow,” Draco sneered and pushed her to the side. The Slytherins around them protested, but Draco ignored them.
He couldn’t help but think. “So Ron, how about we have lunch together? I can get out own picnic basket? There’s a lovely tree by the Black Lake.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You will find out in time,” Voldemort said. “You will find that I am not all monstrous, Harry. You want to submit to Malfoy, body, mind, and soul. I have told you that I will show you the path towards that, and I have not lied. That mark is the beginning, Harry. May you wear it with pride just as the boy before you did.”
That seemed to snap both the crowd and monster awake. One head leapt towards a woman that Harry recognized as the owner of the makeup shop, he likes. With one fell swoop, the head’s mouth opened and swallowed the woman, snapping in half. There was a scream and a spray of blood and guts before nothing, the remainder of the woman’s body fell to the ground, blood bleeding openly. The second and third head caught sight of Mrs. Malfoy.
“They’re all great, thank you Uncles,” Harry smiled, hugging Uncle Remus and Uncle Sirius. He packed his gifts away and brought them upstairs before he helped with the final preparations of his Dark Initiation.
“Seven, until she decided to stop searching,” Blaise said. He looked at Harry and explained, “Every time my mother married, her husbands would die mysteriously and suddenly. My own father, who was her first, was actually killed by a muggle.”
It was just as magnificent as Harry fantasized about it. Large and thick with a heavy musky smell that drove Harry wild. He pressed his nose against it again and inhaled sharply, burying his face in Draco’s pubes as his cock slapped against his cheek. Draco’s hands tightened in his head, pushing down, “Fuck yeah pup,” he groaned, “smell my Alpha cock.”
“O-Omega?” the man stuttered. “But Dumbledore said—”
“This is horrible,” Lucius muttered. “This is devastating. Everything we worked for, the years of suffering—over.”
“Don’t insult Lily, you disgusting hag!” Uncle Sirius yelled out, whipping around to glare at whoever yelled.
“Oh?” Draco said, raising his eyebrows. “I honestly didn’t think he was like that.”
Draco blushed but smiled confidently, “I think supporting each other’s meat is a third-date kind of thing, don’t you agree Harry?”
“I told you that I will see you off, Harrison,” Voldemort said. “How did the Weasleys treat you?”
Harry frowned and looked at Ron, who shuffled in his seat sheepishly. “Hermione and Ginny had a row,” he said. “It was awful.”
“Speak plaining before I tell Harry to hex you some more,” Niall huffed.
“So?” Harry demanded, “You don’t decided to just punch my best friend and think everything is okay! Apologize immediately or I’ll actually consider what Ron and said kick you back out to that room in the Leaky Cauldron.”
After breakfast, he went up to his study and his mother retired to her own chambers.
"I don't see how this is any of your business." Mother said, her eyes blazing with disapproval. Draco was all too aware of the spark of triumph in his own eyes at the fact that she hadn't denied the assumption he had made.
"Yeah so I was wondering i-if wecouldgolivewiththemforafewdaysuntilfathergetsbetter." Draco says quickly.
Malfoy chuckled lowly, "I don't blame you; I was surprised too at the fact that I admitted that to you, of all people."
"I'm sorry. I'm so so sorry sweetheart. I love you. I love you so much. We can go live with your parents, or your parents can come live with us, whatever you want, baby. Whatever you want. Don't cry please, Draco, I love you, don't cry."
He suddenly felt a sharp pain in his chest, near his heart. His head felt like it would split open any second and someone was prickling his whole body with razor-sharp pins, not only that but they had somehow reached within his chest and his heart was slowly clenching, as if a fist was squeezing the sensitive, vital organ.
"There's something else on your mind, isn't there?" Narcissa asked.
"You look tired, Harry. You can sleep in my guest room for today, if you want." Smith said.
Draco sighs. "Certainly."
Harry looked away from his face and thought about the first night he had experienced the strange events. He remembered those words spoken in Parseltongue, they haunted him in nightmares every night but Harry hadn't told anyone about them, not even Ron or Hermione.
"Yep. Come on, Potter, you'll look better."
"Okay, I want you to relax and close your eyes." Potter says softly.
A man limped from behind a wall, he was short and slim, hardly any muscle, only bones. His face was gaunt, an unattractive stubble on his cheeks and chin. He might've been intimidating to others with his walking stick and the annoyed aura surrounding him but not to Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World.
"So as to why you called this meeting?" He asks Draco.
I stare at Potter and feel my heart burst with joy when I see how much concern and worry is present in his eyes.
I roll my eyes. And he's supposed to be a
"Ummm.. no?"
such a dangerous book was so easily accessible to
He saw Malfoy flinch at his words, "I apologise for all of those insults and the effects they might have, no must have, caused on you and your friends. I also believe that we have matured enough at this point to work together without hexing each other's bollocks off."
Our lips move in sync as everything and everyone around us is forgotten. For now, it's only us, me and him, Malfoy and Potter, Draco and Harry. I smile into the kiss. I'm now Potter's, Potter is now mine.
Draco took a deep breath before knocking. He had contemplated sending a letter to Potter in reply but in the end had decided not to. After all, he was disrespected and would choose whether or not to return. Draco had told Blaise and Pansy about everything that had happened but not Mother. He was afraid she would somehow see how upset Potter's actions had made him, (she had always been good at reading his emotions) and then she'll figure out about his crush on Potter, which probably wouldn't be good news for Draco.
Draco closes his eyes and thinks. What is his happiest memory? Probably when he saw the body of Dark Lord fall to the ground and saw his Dark Mark vanishing. He opens his eyes and tells Harry he knows what it is.
Potter sighs again then stands up and walks to the middle of the room. He flicks his wand and the table in the centre moves to the side.
"So how did you and Pansy become...friends?" I asked, recovering a little bit from seeing Potter's surprising (and extremely sexy) appearance.
"W-what happened?" He asks, looking around. He looks surprised to see Potter.
"What did he mean?" He asked Kingsley who was now rubbing his temples.
"Whatever you say Malfoy." Potter says and the idiot has the nerve to wink at Malfoy. With these actions and the effects they caused on Draco, Potter leaves the room with a simple "I'll bring tea." As if he didn't just made Draco go redder than he has ever before.
"Thank you Kreacher. I ummm could do with a hot choco."
It made sense now, a little more sense than before. A loud scream interrupted his musings.
"I uh- here." I thrust the box in her hands and scratch my neck.
"Yes?" Harry answered, out of the corner of his eye he could see Malfoy look up too.
himself who had his back to Draco currently and was supposed to be his
"Of course. Enjoy your vacation, Mr. Malfoy." Healer Brandon smiled kindly at him, his eyes and mouth wrinkling at the corners.
"Yeah... well.. I-I..ummm.. you know that I-uh- like Draco-." Harry started to say but stopped when Ron coughed loudly.
Harry's eyes sought the man again, he was the suspected criminal of a case the aurors had been trying to solve for a long time and now he was finally going to be in their hands. Just as the man turned a corner and reached a deserted street, Harry knew that was where he had to be captured.
She smiles at me and tears the wrapping paper. It is a necklace with a pug locket, which is Pansy's patronus.
After Fred's death, it was very hard on the Weasleys. Molly wouldn't stop crying, Ron was quiet, Ginny wasn't lively as before but most of all George acted like he had lost a part of himself. He was just a shell of who he once used to be. It was very hard for Harry to stay around the Weasleys when they so clearly were mourning Fred. He felt like an intruder and didn't want to spend much time with the family. He knew it was wrong, he should've supported them, helped them but at the time, he was so tired of his own nightmares and everything else going on in his life. It was Hermione who had finally talked some sense into him and told him how the Weasleys accepted him as family. That he wasn't intruding on anything. So he started to grow close to the Weasleys, closer than before.
Draco tries but to no avail. He keeps trying again and again, motivated by Harry but Draco couldn't produce a corporeal Patronus.
He hadn't expected to be offered to work with the Aurors but most importantly he hadn't expected himself to actually accept the opportunity. He had agreed though and now he was stuck with Harry Potter of all people on such a dangerous case. Draco shook his head at himself. He had a tendency of somehow making the wrong choices at almost every opportunity. It was going to get him in trouble, that is if it hadn't already.
"Dangerous? What is the guarantee that I'd stay unscathed?" Draco asked.
"Friends? Since when?"
With a nod he got up and disappirated to Potter's office.
Narcissa smiled brightly at her son in reply. "Good morning, love."
"Say what you want, Potter, but I'm telling you, be careful. Don't...don't go to the…ball." Dolohov said.
"You're right but I doubt Malfoy would agree to this."
"Ummm.. an Accio, I guess? No no.. it was an Alohomora.. yeah.. I performed an Alohomora on my bedroom door, or tried to, you can say."
Harry's little speech made Draco realize that what he was looking for wasn't something he had already experienced at all, it was something he had always desired.
"B-but I promised! only promised. I did not make an unbreakable vow, for Salazar's sake!"
Also, I saw a bunch of posts about how Draco fans justify his wrong actions and I really wanted to address that in this; the fact that redemption is truly a thing.
Harry walked soundlessly beside Smith, hiding from view of House 248. Harry cast the Deprehendatur Spell at the house but there was no trace of magic apart from the Dark wards that surrounded it.
Draco whispered in his mind as he flipped through the pages.
"How can you be so sure?" Harry asked.
Harry knew he could capture the man but it wasn't only about the wizard. It was about what he was planning too. The potions they had discovered were hard to understand and Harry knew Malfoy was doing his best. He had observed the Healer when they were together, observed the way his hands worked in symphony as he inspected the green emerald paste.
"And what was all that about the Minister?" Draco asked, he knew who the Minister was; Johan Hertzoon, but he had thought that the man became the Minister because he was voted by the Wizengamot.
"Potter? You okay?" Draco was angry at Potter at the moment but he
"How can I help you?"
The words were utter nonsense but where were they coming from? Was someone nearby speaking them? Harry doubted that, not many people could speak Parseltongue. Then how was he hearing it?
"Draco, sweetheart. How was your day?" His Mother's soft voice reached his ears and Draco immediately felt at ease. No matter what, she had chosen him; her son and Draco knew she always would.
"Here are the bodies." Kingsley's voice sounded oddly far away due to the charm.
"I don't own this book. I didn't bring it here. I remember every piece of parchment in this library but this book...this isn't...it's so dangerous. I can't believe it was
He felt Harry move closer to Draco's face. Draco knew Harry was giving him time to move away but Draco didn't, of course he didn't. He had wanted this for ages and now he was finally getting it.
"I- sure." Draco said.
Potter snorted, "To please your ever curious wonderment, I asked Will for a reason. We get along well and I don't mind him as my date. Besides, he's handsome."
"It's not that hard, Potter." I drawled, rolling my eyes.
"Going to take us there today or what?" Potter's voice brought Draco out of his stupor. Draco felt his cheeks warm, there was a weird feeling in his chest. Potter's stupid aftershave scent was tickling his nostrils. Draco swallowed hard and exhaled softly, trying to block everything out and picture his destination.
With a nod Kingsley continued, "You see, Mr. Malfoy, we, Aurors, have a rather...challenging and significant case to solve." Draco had no idea what  that had to do with him but he didn't interrupt. "I have selected my most able auror for the case but we need your assistance. It has come to my knowledge that you are a brilliant potioneer and you have knowledge of the Dark Arts; both of which my most capable auror doesn't master in. We require both of these expertise to solve this case." Kingsley finished.
"Shut it, Potter." I mutter.
Harry stood up too, eager for a distraction, "Yeah well, no one forced you to accept this offer, Malfoy. No one asked you to quit your job. They were your choices and it comes as no surprise to me that you regret them. After all, none of your decisions have ever been noble."
. Was all Draco replied with.
Now I feel angry. How dare he insult Draco like that? Not everyone is as bloody Gryffindor as him. He doesn't have any idea what Draco went through. None. He has no right to say such things about Dray, no fucking right.
Mother nodded, "I have already ordered Pippy to set up the table." She stood up and followed Draco to the dining room.
He frowned, as he paused in front of the door. "Er-are you alright, Amanda?"
"He does like you, Draco. I assure you that."
"You can call me Asper." The librarian replied.
"Potter, you need to tell me what's hap-" Draco's words were cut off by another pained moan from Potter.
"N-no, of course I know what a dance is, Potter." Malfoy muttered and looked away, not meeting Harry's eyes.
"That was Smith." Kingsley said, he was frowning at the place where the silver leopard had vanished. "It isn't like Harry to go back home without reporting to me, specially with a case this significant."
Draco had, indeed, forgotten that he'd be working with a companion but he wouldn't be telling Kingsley that. He schooled his face into a neutral expression, "No not at all." Amusement danced in Kingsley's eyes; he clearly hadn't bought Draco's lie.
"Ask him yourself, Mr. Malfoy. Harry has a strange interest in ranting against the Minister. He can do it for hours." Kingsley shook his head and Draco knew he was being asked to leave.
Potter huffed out a short laugh.
The music was an old rock song that wasn't meant for a slow dance but Harry wasn't aware of the world around himself anyway, all he could focus on was the slender body in his arms.
"You're not making any
Harry sighed. Casting a Reparo on the shards of teacup, he cleaned the mess of parchment and ink he had made too.
"A favour?"
Harry's blood ran cold at the words. His hands dropped from his throat to clutch his head that was throbbing painfully. It felt like someone was choking him, hissing threats in his ears and hammering his head all at once.
"Fine, my arse. You're clearly worried about something. Now tell me what it is." Ginny gave a final tug on his hair and stepped back to admire her handiwork. Apparently, she was satisfied because she took a seat in front of Harry.
"His magic?"
I feel my cheeks redden at her words. She notices and pinches my cheeks, something she knows I hate.
Probably seeing Harry's anxiousness on his face Kingsley gave him a reassuring smile, "I wasn't finished as of yet, actually. As I said you will be the only
"So, Dolohov, why were you released early from your punishment in Azkaban?" Harry asked. He had thought long and hard about this; why the Death Eater was removed from prison 6 months before his actual release was due.
"Draco, my love, you've been here for hours. Is something the matter?" She asked softly, taking a seat in front of him.
Harry blew his breath from puffed cheeks in an attempt to calm himself. "Yes, Ron. That's a rather accurate summary. Now if you don't mind, I have to go. I am already late enough for work."
I feel embarrassed. I knew it was Pansy's birthday and she had helped me so much that I had to get her a gift she'd remember for her whole life.
He expects Potter to hex him but Potter surprises him by giving a rich, loud laugh that makes Draco's heart flutter and stomach churn pathetically.
"What?" Malfoy raised a blonde eyebrow.
"Cafina Street." Malfoy said, looking around. "It is near Mungo’s, I usually come here for shopping. More convenient than going to Diagon Alley."
"You're drooling." Draco's head snapped up to look at Potter frowning as he folded his auror robes neatly.
"Will it h-hurt?" I asked, my voice quavering. Merlin could I get anymore pathetic. I felt Pansy's hand on the small of my back, comforting me.
"I read it and found the information I desired but...this book is dangerous, Asper." Draco removed the velvet from the ancient book, revealing the title.
"Of course, let's go."
"So what's so special in this cranky old decaying book?" Potter spoke as he took a seat behind his office table, Draco already seated in front of him.
"Good. Now breathe in with me." Draco instructed, taking a deep breath. He saw Potter repeat his actions. "That's right. Now breathe out." Draco exhaled slowly, Potter following.
"Oh and why would he do that?" Draco raised an eyebrow.
Draco nods and takes a deep breath, bracing himself for God knows whatever Potter is about to ask.
Harry cast a scourgify but the ink left a huge spot on the parchment where it was absorbed. Harry crumples the report he had been writing and throws it at the wall. He fists his hair in his hands, taking deep breaths to calm himself. Draco puts his hand on Harry's shoulder in order to give comfort but receives no reaction.
Potter looked like a deer in the headlights at Draco's sudden outburst but to his credit he recovered quickly. "Well, I did drink coffee."
"Mate, where have you been? I-" The red-haired auror stopped speaking as soon as he saw Malfoy.
The sound of the door creaking open interrupted Draco's thoughts and he jumped, dropping the photo clutched in his hand to the table. His head whipped around to see who had entered.
"So Harry-" Draco gives a surprised jerk at that and stares at his Mother. He didn't know she was on a first name basis with Potter. Mother probably noticing his reaction gives him a little glare and continues "- So about Draco's magic."
Just as Draco's about to ask which object he has to perform the spell on, Potter casts a calming charm and Draco forgets everything. He closes his eyes, reaches towards his magic and after much practice, reaches it in less time than his previous tries. He has no idea where to aim the Reducto so he blindly aims his wand, hoping it isn't at Potter but just as he is about to cast, a heavy something collides with his wand arm that he falls to the floor on his arse.
? Had he lost his mind?
"Umm I came on the order of the Ministry and removed his Dark Mark for him?" He says, though it sounds more like a question. I notice that he sounds a little scared, good.
I look around, trying to find Pansy. I see Blaise who notices me and comes over. I'm not friends with him, we're acquaintances, you could say. I asked Ron and Hermione if they wanted to come but they had promised their kids to take them for a picnic or something so they couldn't.
"What? Why? It's been years since the war why are-"
"Oh, not at all. Sir Shacklebolt should be free in a few minutes, I'm sure." The girl was such a damn Hufflepuff her smile still didn't falter. It started to seem a little creepy to Draco.
Potter only shrugged his broad shoulders in reply. "One of the perks of being Senior Auror. Besides, if anyone asks us, we can say that we were investigating the house."
"Then the pain increased and the words started to make sense. Blood, kill, revenge. The last words I heard before passing out was my name; Harry Potter. Dead."
Draco thought of following but decided it would be better to secure the potion in the vial first. So he entered the investigating room again, his head swarming with worried thoughts.
"Why are you giving me chocolate?" Draco asks but takes it nonetheless, he could never refuse chocolate.
I see Potter raise an eyebrow at me. "You didn't answer." He whispered and I notice how his beautiful, luscious, pink lips moved as he said those words and now all I can think of is those lips on mine. I force myself to look up and this time what I see makes me shiver. Potter's irises are so wide, his eyes are almost black.
Harry had gone and investigated the house in Purely again, without Kingsley's permission of course but it didn't really matter because he hadn't been able to enter it anyway.
"Aaaand open." Pansy mutters.
In just a few seconds, the precious bronze was nothing more than ash-like powder.
Draco closes his mouth, feeling himself go red. He doesn't meet Potter's eyes as he greets him or enters Potter's house or sits in his living room.
"Y-you think so?" He looks so miserable asking this that I feel my face soften involuntarily.
Unfortunately, Potter had heard the remark and the minute he looked up with a furrow between his brows and a smirk on his face, Draco wished that the ground would swallow him up.
"I think I know why you and Pansy became friends." I mutter, not wanting Potter to keep looking at me the way he was right now, I would probably faint (or worse swoon) if he continued that.
"Master Potter! Kreacher is very sorry for being late but he made Master's favourite hot chocolate that Master wants when he spends the night with-" Potter cuts Kreacher off with a blush coloring his cheeks.
Now Draco couldn't argue with that and saying that Harry wouldn't have thought of it when seeing someone in such a condition would probably be too lame. He decided not to reply to Blaise at all. And so Draco just looked away, ignoring his friends' triumphant stares and took a sip of the tea Pansy's house elf just served.
"C-can you cast the calming charm again?" Draco asks, mortified at having not been able to feel his magic once he had done it before.
Loud knocking on the door wakes Harry up. He rubs sleep from his eyes as he walks out of his bedroom, simultaneously cursing whoever is waking him up at 5 in the morning. Not bothering to even pull a shirt on he yanks open the door and feels his eyes widen.
"By the way, could you inform Kingsley that I'm safe? Tell him I was very tired, hadn't slept since last night so I apparated back home. Say that I'll give him the report tomorrow. And if you mention the passing out part-" Harry let the threat hang in the air.
I squinted at her and she still had that little sneaky smile on her face, even though I could tell she was trying her best to hide it.
"Mr. Potter. How can I help you?" Harry was impressed at the fact that the man didn't stutter.
With a click, the door bounced open.
"If Malfoy agrees, I will help you." Harry says. He knows that he owes Narcissa and if he rejects this, she might ask for something much more difficult. Besides, it can't be that hard. Harry can teach a first year, Malfoy should be an easier student.
Harry frowned at that, not knowing what exactly Kingsley meant but nodded nonetheless and disappirated to his office.
With an enthusiastic nod disapparates with a loud crack.
"Parkinson? Everything alright?" He asks, looking at me confusedly.
"I am glad to hear that you have a good memory. It will definitely come in handy for this case." Draco wanted to blast off all of the perfectly white teeth Kingsley was displaying at him but he resisted, barely resisted. Instead Draco gave him a cheeky smile.
"I tried. I can't do wandwork at all."
"Well, I bet your favourite colour is red too. Self-obsessed Gryffindors." Malfoy drawled.
Potter suddenly opened his eyes and traced my Mark with the index finger of his other hand. The movement was so soft and feather-like that it sent shivers down my spine.
"Hmmm." Potter looks thoughtful for a while.
"What is this place?" Harry turned to look at Malfoy who was striding beside him. His hair looked almost gold in the sunlight. And how the hell was it so straight? Harry was sure no one had that straight hair naturally.
Gone. It was gone. His hardwork of 6 months was
"Now, Potter, I wanted to discuss a huge problem with you." I say matter-of-factly, crossing my arms on my chest.
An involuntarily smile curled on Draco's lips. He had enjoyed the time spent with Potter; the only people of his age he hung out with were Pansy and Blaise but even that had been a long time ago. They both were busy with their own lives and Draco with his.
I felt my cheeks heat at his tone and I knew everyone could see it due to my damned pale skin.
"I…my head!" He gasped, looking up at Draco with huge blood-shot eyes. Draco walked towards him slowly, trying to figure out what was happening. It couldn't be the Potion since Draco wasn't feeling anything.
decline but then again curiousity killed the cat, didn't it? Draco was curious but he just hoped it wouldn't get him killed.
"It was unexpected, definitely." Draco replied.
I grab Blaise's arm and haul him out as he looks at me confusedly.
"Isn't that a good thing?" She asked.
, wasn't it, when instead of investigating the brutal death of a little girl, we went to a ceremony?" Potter spit every word with so much venom Draco was taken aback. His surprise even more was evident on his face when he saw Kingsley flinch.
I saw a frown between Potter's brows as he worked on my arm. He started to speak then and the sounds made my stomach clench. It was all Parseltongue and I couldn't understand a word of it but the sound of it was like music to my ears.
He knew he must look intimidating in his Auror robes; tailored specially to suit his muscular build. The muscles in his arms, visible due to the rolled sleeves, flexed as he rolled his shoulders.
Kingsley's words sent a flare of rage pulsing in Harry's head. Was that all they cared about now; reputations and useless acts of selfishness? Had the Ministry of Magic, the Aurors, fallen so low that they forgot the actual purpose of their creation?
"Kreacher was in the attic. He likes to go there sometimes. He'll be here with the tea soon" Potter says, a little out of breath.
The walls are covered with framed photos.
"No. I uhhh- umm.. you're still working?" Draco asked nervously.
"Calm down, Parkinson. I didn't mean it as an insult." And then he sighs miserably.
There was. Draco didn't want to admit it because it was such a small and insignificant issue compared to all his other problems but it was bothering him to no end.
Draco walked behind the desk, picking up the little vial of the blood red potion. Potter nodded with a sigh and grabbed a piece of parchment, scribbling on it.
Harry casts Legilimens, and visits the Weasleys. Draco talks with Blaise and Pansy.
"Don't lie to me, Potter. I can spot lies from a mile away. Besides, I saw you in the living room." I say, making my voice as intimidating as I can.
"Oh he so likes you back, Draco." Pansy had said.
at Potter. It was clear Potter wasn't interested, Draco was pretty sure that when the guy still continued his staring, it was counted as harassing.
"I'm fine." Harry replied. He didn't know why he wasn't telling his friends about the recent bullshit in his life; believing they would be worried was still a good enough reason but if Harry was in their place, he'd definitely want to know what was bothering his friend even if it was terrifying.
Harry turned around to see who had entered his office and was surprised to see Malfoy. It was too damn early to deal with him but Harry had absolutely no choice.
Draco knew he had wanted this, infact he had just thought about it, but now that it was actually happening, Draco's mind couldn't function. He couldn't meet Harry's eyes so he stared at his bony palms that were still on Harry's broad chest.
"Don't go near it, you understand?" Potter hisses at Draco and it sounds so much like the hisses of the evil wizard that Draco can't help but release the whimper building in his mouth or the tears gathering in his eyes. He has no idea what he shouldn't go near but he wasn't going to ask, nor was he in any condition to.
Then as though a cord snapping, Potter's expression becomes less angry and he backs away from Draco.
Draco didn't push Harry away, even though he was undoubtedly very mad at Harry. He probably needed the comfort only Harry could give him. Draco sobbed loudly, his tears were wetting Harry's shirt but Harry didn't care. All he wanted right now was for Draco to stop crying.
Malfoy shook his head, "Well he isn't great but I thought there must've been a reason he got the position he has."
Potter shrugged in reply, eyes on his report. "I don't, really, but I
did I do this? What was I thinking? Draco's tendency to overthink everything was starting to show itself but all thought left his mind when he saw just
"He will agree. Thank you Harry. When should I bring him here?"
"To what do I owe this um- pleasure?" Harry finally stutters out.
"Malfoy just forget-"
"We need to investigate this as fast as we can. As you saw this wizard is no ordinary one. The fact that we have no idea what he is planning makes it all the more harder. Mr. Malfoy, you should investigate the potion and the bodies we evacuated from the wizard's place as soon as possible. Harry, you should be there too. We don't know what it might cause." Kingsley said.
"Very well. You may come tomorrow to investigate. You will probably have to come here for a few days so I apologize if your Healer job is disturbed." Kingsley looked sincere and sombre as he spoke. Draco didn't tell him that he had taken a vacation from his healer job. Kingsley might expect him here everyday otherwise. "It's okay." Was all he replied with.
"Stay here, if you see red sparks, call for help immediately, then rush in." Harry whispered lightly to Smith as they reached the edge of the house. Once Smith had nodded and stood at guard with his wand at the ready, Harry went in.
"Mr. Potter, I've already told you that I've never seen this kind of a knife before. What is it that you want?" Harry's blood boiled at the hostility in the man's tone. How dare he lie then talk that way to an Auror?
When Draco had told everything to Blaise and Pansy, however, with an extremely red face not to mention, their reaction wasn't the same at all.
"Dolohov." Harry's words caught the ex-Death Eater's attention, who blanched upon seeing him.
Draco obeyed, placing the book covered in cloth on the dusty table.
"What do you mean you didn't had a choice?" Ron asks. Harry sighs. He misses Hermione's sensible remarks whenever he is alone with Ron. He should probably have told them both together at their home and not only to Ron at The Three Broomsticks.
After she had saved him from Voldemort and everything had settled, at the time of the trials, he had defended Narcissa and Draco but not Lucius because he did do wrongs unlike his family. So Narcissa had gotten away with only 1 month in Azkaban, which was no longer guarded by dementors. Draco, however had to spend 3 months in the prison due to the extreme nature of his crimes. Lucius was  sent to Azkaban for 2 years. Other than a final fine of 3000 Galleons,  in Harry's opinion, the family's punishment was not that severe.
"Mr. Malfoy. Come here please." Kingsley said.
"Oh... You er- brought the bowl?" He stutters.
I close my eyes dutifully and wait for Merlin knows what Pansy's about to do to me. I flinch as something suddenly touches my eyelid.
Harry laughed, a cruel sound. The tension and worry of all the days weighing in.
"The only time my gut feeling was proved wrong, was when I thought I wouldn't kill a criminal if he begged me." Harry saw the man's eyes flit away nervously.
Ron gapes at Harry's answer. "How clever of her."
"Not everyone is as forgiving as you Mr. Pott- Harry"
Draco takes a deep breath and tries to find something, anything but he doesn't, despite his efforts. He opens his eyes, feeling ashamed at his failure.
He laughs loudly at that but soon stops when a slow, romantic song starts. Potter sways in time to the music and I start moving too. We dance in complete silence until he breaks it.
"You do not talk to an Auror that way, Mr. Farley, nor do you lie to one, and certainly not to the Senior Auror." Harry gazed with burning eyes at the gaunt man who stumbled back a step. "Now tell me who bought this knife from you."
Draco walked to where he was standing. "Here is the potion we recovered from the house in Purely." Kingsley was holding a tiny vial in his hand, about the size of Draco's ring finger. Inside was a deep red liquid, Draco would've assumed it was blood had it not been for the glittery bubbles inside it.
Harry Potter.
"Just...don't go, Potter. He...he wants you dead." Dolohov said.
"Did you see Potter?" He said, his eyes wide, looking as though he had just been hypnotized.
Potter's eyes lit up in reply. "Th-thanks, Parkinson. I owe you one." He says urgently and runs towards the apparition point.
"Can't you do anything? Everyone listens to you." Harry stared at Malfoy to see if the git was joking but if his serious and sincere expression was any indication, he wasn't.
Just as he was about to cross out Malfoy's name, Kingsley's words came rushing back to him. "Choose the wizard who is most suited for the case and not your company."
"People in the Wizengamot tried to stop it from happening but they couldn't really do anything. There might not be much evil in the Wizarding world after the war but there certainly are lies and corruption." Harry shook his head in frustration.
"He can't perform even the simplest of spells. He used the wand you defeated the Dark Lord with, so I thought that is why he couldn't perform magic but with a new wand, he couldn't do magic at all."
"Fine. I'll ask someone." Harry turned around and grabbed his auror robes from the sofa he had kept them on.
"Did you find anything?" Potter's voice rang loudly in the library and Draco cringed at the scowl the shrewd librarian gave their way.
Draco sat frozen in surprise; the Ministry wasn't fond of him certainly then why was he invited to this ceremony?
"So I'll have to wait until he kills a few bad guys and makes a dramatic entrance?" Draco drawled. He had a job which he
"You look amazing. Dray'll probably faint seeing you. Or he might kiss you. Depends on how bold he's feeling" Pansy smirks and turns around, entering the living room.
Harry shook his head, "No. The form you signed will prevent you from sharing anything about this case with an outsider."
"Of course." She just nodded instead of pestering Harry about his health. “I will send it to Robards.”
Harry was impressed by the man's courage to speak to him that way.
"You must be wondering why you would help us. You, of course, owe us nothing but we do require your help. If you demand of me what you want and I will be able to give it to you, I definitely would. That is in return for your assistance in this case." Kingsley said in that booming, deep voice of his.
"Mistake, really? Oh don't deny it, Malfoy. This isn't the first time I've been called attractive." Oh great. Add 'arrogant' to the list of 'Qualities of Potter Draco has noticed.'
"This is Sir Robards, the Junior Head Auror" She continued pointing to the picture of a man with a stern face and grey hair.
"Uh-w-what?" Malfoy recovered from the shock of Harry's question and stuttered.
Harry nodded and agreed but he could feel a heaviness in his actions, a weight in his chest, a dark shadow looming over him.
"Mal-Healer Malfoy, do come in." Harry nodded at him. Kingsley had given him a whole lecture to remain professional with Malfoy, to which Harry had muttered a dejected "I'll try."
Okay,
"Looks ancient." Potter remarked.
I don't look up as Potter puts his hand on my waist. My face flares up and I know he can see it because of how pale I am. The song in the background isn't something we can slow dance to at all but Potter doesn't seem to mind that. I don't look up at him, for fear of what I might find there. I've always been a coward.
Draco ignored the rest of the ingredients and the method, turning the page to the effects of the potion. His heart was beating fast, his fingers tingling in anticipation.
birthday? And since when was Blaise interested in
"But you already did." Kingsley said with a frown.
The calming charm ends, Draco looks around for the cause of his fall and his eyes widen when he realizes it was Potter who pushed him.
"Yeah, here." Blaise keeps the bowl infront of him and sits cross-legged on the carpet. I sit beside him.
"Come on, let's get you a drink." She said, then glared at Blaise.
person does.
"Oh. My. God." Pansy says. "Get back, I'm coming in."
"No." He stated plainly.
"Would you like some tea? Or coffee?" Kingsley asked. "No, thank you." Draco said.
"Harry, calm down." Kingsley pinched his nose between his brows. "You don't have a choice; you have to come to the ball. And you too Mr. Malfoy. I won't hear anymore arguments." With a wave of his hand Kingsley dismissed them.
Harry's head was throbbing painfully and his eyes were heavy with sleep. He had been up all night, investigating the latest case.
I sit there surprised. He didn't even say anything about meeting again. Wasn't he supposed to ask Draco out? Or had I misinterpreted his behaviour? I am pretty sure no one caresses someone's face the way Potter did if they weren't in love with them.
The last thought surprised him. He didn't want Potter to smile at him. Absolutely not. He was Draco Malfoy; he didn't care about Harry Potter one single bit-
"So Mr. Malfoy, you must be wondering why I invited you here." He said, folding his arms on the table and leaning back in his chair.
Draco knew he shouldn't, knew it wouldn't do him any good but he couldn't help glancing at the picture of the murder scene again. It was the same, as gruesome as it had been before. Draco's hand shot out as he picked up the photograph with a shaking, pale hand. He brought it close to his face and inspected the bodies. Cuts lined the torso of the two males. Little but deep ones, stark red against the pale skin. The wounds looked as if they were made by a knife. Draco's gaze moved to the wounds on the neck. They were circular, ringed with dry blood. In the middle was something greenish, like rotten flesh. Similar wounds in varying sizes were present on the wrist of the bodies. Draco gagged at the picture but didn't put it down. He had seen many injuries during his job as a healer but this was something else entirely.
At night though, when Harry was back home, he had thought about all those events; the pain, the hissing and the violent words. Harry had downed a whole bottle of Firewhiskey and swallowed a vial of dreamless sleep potion. He had a tendency to get nightmares after particularly traumatizing events. He had given it a thought, and concluded that those words and that voice were mere fragments of his imagination. Yet, deep in his heart he couldn’t believe that.
Harry was starting to feel like he had over-reacted but he wanted to clear up a few things with Malfoy.
"Does he know we left?" Harry chuckled lightly at Malfoy's panicked expression. The guy followed the rules too much.
Draco shook his head no and the waiter went away with a nod. Draco dug into his food, at the sight of the sizzling plate of milky vegetables, he was hungry too. He looked up to see Potter ravenously stuffing his face with Naan and curry. If he continued eating this fast, he'd choke.
"But in all seriousness, Draco, I do wish you get your magic back. Hopefully Potter can work it out." Blaise says getting a nod of agreement from Pansy. Draco nods too, wishing the same in his heart.
"I am very proud of the progress you've made and the way you both have cooperated together despite the dark past you've had. I know what you think of this Ball, Harry but you have to attend it." Kingsley continued and Harry exhaled through his nose. Of course this was about that stupid ball, of course it was.
Malfoy put his hand in Harry's. His skin was warm and soft, so unlike Harry's which was rough and callous. For a moment all Harry could do was stare at the contrast of their hands. Caramel and pale skin, it looked like the most magical thing he had ever seen. Harry's heart squeezed in his chest. He forced his eyes to look up and found Malfoy staring at their hands too, his breathing a little rough.
4. Who owned the house before? Was it sold to the Dark Wizard or did he kill its previous owner?
"I don't know what you're talking about." Dolohov muttered, poking at his food.
dark.
"Hey, don't lose hope right now. That was a very good..er- try." Harry says getting a sarcastic snort from Draco in return.
, give you any information about him. You are wasting your time, Auror Potter. I do have a little piece of advice for you, however; be careful, the man's dangerous, he intends to avenge the Dark Lord's death. What better way to do it than destroy his Lord's killer?"
His gaze was broken by Malfoy's soft exhale, "Don't look that way, Potter. I'm human, after all."
"It's okay, we weren't talking about anything that confidential." Malfoy spoke.
"I just...wondered." He said lamely.
Harry entered the dark shop at Knockturn Alley; Farley's Trading Hub. He didn't bother knocking on the door, opening it wide with a simple nudge of his heavy auror boot.
"Yes, Potter. I am quite sure I have read this book and it does not have any information we need." Draco was pretty sure coming to the library with Potter was a bad idea because the got wouldn't stop talking.
Ron's face scrunched up in confusion. "But he's the second-in-command on your team." He said, staring at Harry.
Draco entered the white room, it's sharp smell of antiseptic hitting his nostrils. The Head Healer, Healer Brandon as everyone called him, was a 70-year old man with a wrinkled but kind face, soft hazel eyes and greying hair who was, at the moment, giving him one of the softest smile Draco had ever witnessed. "Ah, Healer Malfoy! Do take a seat. What brings you here?"
Amanda jostled out of the thoughts in her head, "Oh, yes. I'm perfectly fine. You seem tired, Harry. Didn’t get enough sleep?”
With a final glance at his office, Harry slid his wand in the holster on his arm and disappirated to discover a clue to who was after him now.
Draco frowned, was it something about the case? He hurried in the living room and crouched in front of the fireplace where stood a tense looking Kingsley Shacklebolt.
in the
"Oh, great! It uh- didn't... hurt too much afterwards?" He asked.
“More than one,” Harry said. He dug his wand deeper against Draco’s throat before screaming as Goyle tackled him, both wand and letter flying into the air.
He kept walking until they reached a bench that overlooked the grounds. The two sat and Harry made sure to leave some room between them. “Why did you never try to contact me?” Harry asked. “Why did you never answered my letters?”
Harry felt that his face could not go redder as Goyle stood up to help the girl with her luggage. “I’ll tell you later when Draco comes in,” he muttered. He looked at the girl for a long moment, “You’re Greengrass,” he pointed out.
“Nobody really takes the class seriously,” Theo shrugged. “But we have to keep up certain pretenses, so we must never really talk about our suffering of this class aloud in halls.”
When the two were done, Blaise helped Harry dress and put his make up on, the mage leading the demon on how to do it, before both went downstairs to find Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus. “Blaise! When did you get home?” Uncle Remus asked.
“Confidence and dominance,” Ron repeated.
“It was,” Draco smirked. He looked thoughtful for a moment before standing up. “Stand, Harry,” he ordered.
“Well, Voldemort wins, it’ll be worse, much worse. The most extreme beliefs you grew up on will be established I fear…” Harry said.
“But you should! Harry this is very important, we need to know what is going on with you,” Hermione insisted. “If not then who knows what can happen—you can hurt yourself!”
“Yes Uncle Remus,” Harry said a little meekly. He felt the pressure move off his body and got to his feet. Draco followed and the two scared an uneasy look. Harry reached for Draco’s hand, and the two walked after Uncle Remus, Typhon following after them, growing in size until he reached Harry’s waist.
“I used to travel around studying,” Voldemort said. “I’ve amassed a comfortable amount of money during these travels. I’m actually having a home build for me and my son. Along with an Omega, hopefully.” He glanced at Remus.
Harry was doing the same, looking between Draco and Blaise. “What happened?” he asked.
“No, but—can I please come home for Christmas?” Harry asked.
“Yes, I do,” Theo said. “Do I need to say it explicitly for you to understand Weasley?” He said in a small annoyed voice. He rolled his eyes and turned to face him. “Ron Weasley, for some reason I like you. I like you, I like your voice, I like how you feel next to me, and I like how my thoughts about you calmed me down during the worst of times. So yes Ron, I like you—”
Remus frowned at that. “Are you sure?” he asked.
For at that moment he really does want to marry Draco, his love for the blonde so full and pure that thoughts of how he was to become pregnant were far from his mind.
“You’re such an alpha,” Harry said, scrunching up his nose.
“Perhaps, we do not know for sure,” Dumbledore said. He was silent for a long moment, lost in thought. He then turned to Mrs. Weasley, “I would like to see Harry’s room,” he said.
“I do!” Ron said defensively, “just didn’t take Slytherins to be jokey.”
“Sure, sounds good,” Harry nodded. “Draco?”
Harry grabbed Draco by the arm,
“What if, what if they’re already a friend?” Ron asked, his cheeks growing red.
“They didn’t get my letter,” Harry said, “the one we sent.”
“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,” Ron told harry in a tense voice. “Every time he’s mention, Dad breaks whatever he’s holding and Mum starts crying.”
“N-Niall, I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Neville stuttered. Niall sighed and stretched his arms so one rested on the back of the couch behind Neville’s head.
“We go back, and live our lives normally,” Draco said, “I’ll think of dates we can do, spots we can fool around with, but other than that, you better not slack on your studies, I won’t have an idiot husband.”
“Why?” Harry asked, looking at his father. “I’ve sent you the letter about Daphne yes?”
“No I’m not, he doesn’t belong here,” Pansy said. “He’s a Gryffindor! And we always sat together!”
“Ron, you didn’t,” Hermione groaned.
“Niall calms me down,” Harry muttered. “I’m sorry. I—if you don’t want me to wear this shirt, I’ll—”
“Nah mate, it’s perfect,” Ron grinned. “Let’s go!”
“Um… was I supposed to?” Harry asked, his cheeks turning red.
Niall did not want to go to Umbridge’s office for detention. He would rather just go to dinner, stuff himself and then go back to his dorm to lay in his bed and daydream about cute omega boys. Instead, feeling practically starved, Niall trod his way to the third floor to meet with Harry in front of Umbridge’s office. The twins shared a defeated, tired look and Niall knocked on the door.
“Six sickles,” the man said. Draco immediately handed the man the money and pulled out his wand, pressing it against the collar. Harry felt the collar move, and it shrank less than a centimeter. Draco smirked and pocketed his wand, “Now it is perfect,” he said. He turned and placed four galleons on the table, “We will wear it out,” he said.
“Umm, sir—I mean Remus, umm,” Harry interrupted. He looked at Niall and bit his lower lip, “Can Niall and I take a bath together? Please?”
“I see,” the Dark Lord said after a while. “Now… was that so hard, Mr. Rolling?” He chuckled and stood to his full before aiming his wand at the man.
Harry forced himself to get out of bed. Water, that’s what he needed. Yes, water will help. Convinced that he needed water, he took his wand went into the bathroom where he summoned a simple cup and filled it with water from the faucet and gulping it down. The water helped slightly, but he still felt sickly, the sensation of vomiting still bubbling inside him. He cried and leaned against the sink. “What is happening?” he asked the empty air around him.
“What? I wasn’t going to harm your boy, just give him some ample breasts to experience how… exquisite they feel,” he chuckled and felt his own breast.
“No,” the boys said weakly.
“MALFOY!” Ron said louder.
Mr. Riddle allowed the cheers to die down naturally, holding his hand up for attention, “However, that day will not be today, as today is about marriage… about love, honor, obedience, three things Harry Potter will swear upon, becoming the men’s wife.” Harry glared at that.
good—even got myself a feel,” he winked at Harry. I bet we’ll be going at it before your heat! So you better step up Harry.”
They found Sirius sitting at the kitchen table as Remus was setting it. “Hello boys sounded like you had some fun,” Sirius grinned. “I got the signature no problem. You’ll never have to see them again.”
Confront
“Strict? They outright beat and starve him!” Ron yelled.
Harry walked away from them, his heart hurting, but his resolve to bring this all to an end kept him from turning around. He ran through Hogwarts, up her stairs and through her corridors until he saw Draco waiting in front of a door. Silently, they walked into the Room of Requirement.
"Oh! This is the DMLE staff. This is Sir Shacklebolt, the Senior Head Auror" The Hufflepuff girl stood beside him and pointed to a picture of Kingsley Shacklebolt giving a small smile. Below it was a bunch of text about him.
Kingsley sighed, "Harry does that. He wouldn't admit if something was wrong with him. Some idea of his about making people too worried." Kingsley shook his head. "Nevermind, I'll ask him tomorrow." Kingsley started to walk again, Draco following.
The words repeated themselves;
Dolohov shook his head, "Well, warning you causes us
It shouldn't have bothered him whatever Potter said but it did. He had thought that after the surprising confession he had made to Potter about him regretting his actions and all, Potter might've forgiven him but clearly, he hadn't. Draco had been a fool to believe otherwise.
Harry's heartbeat increased,
~~~●●●~~~
Harry sighed and let go of Malfoy's arm, sitting back on the desk. "I'm sorry. This whole thing...it's just agitating me." Harry muttered.
"Yes but I just noticed something in the picture. Look. Those are the bodies, right? What is this shiny thing? I hadn't noticed it when I went there but it could be a clue." Potter was pointing to a place right on top of the head of one of the dead bodies. Draco was surprised to see that there was something shining there. It was such a small detail, it was astounding how Potter had found it.
"I didn't want to worry them. They're so happy after the war. Ron, Hermione, Ginny...they deserve to be happy instead of worrying about evil people in my head." Harry rubbed his palms on his face.
"I'm calling it a day. You can stay here if you want but make sure to lock it behind you." Harry spoke to Malfoy.
"T-thank you. Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this means." Dray whispers. His arm is shaking and is face is bone white.
"That man. He...he wore black. I... I couldn't see his face. He asked for...books on...on potions."
Dolohov looked up at him then, his eyes blazing with a mingled fear and anger. The sweeper slammed his hand down on the table between them, standing up from his seat.
"Now that you've felt your magic, let's try wandwork, shall we?"
Something weird had happened to him, his throat had closed up and his vision had blurred but he hadn't heard voices or felt the sharp pain in his whole body like before.
With a loud pop, a very tense Draco and a famished and extremely oblivious Harry Potter, disappirated.
"But it's so little. I can't determine what's in there with such a small amount." Draco argued.
《POV Change》
The broken cottage was secure with Dark wards as Harry had discovered a few days back. He had thought that the wizard was foolish not to have the place secured with wards before and that had troubled Harry; maybe the Dark wizard wanted to lure the Aurors there and set a trap for them, though that didn't seem likely considering that no serious harm had come to the Ministry officials.
It was painful. So very painful. Potter twisted his wand tip on my skin and the snake hissed in pain, writhing. I felt bursts of pain but they weren't unbearable, it was nothing compared to the Crucios I had endured but then Potter lifted his wand from the skull and brought it down on the snake's head with so much pressure that I threw my head back and screamed. I tried to pull my arm back but Potter's hold was tighter than chains.
Potter smiled at him but his expression didn't have the same sparkle it had on the first day. "That's great news, Malfoy. I am glad you've made progress." Is all he said before getting up and clearing space in his living room.
Harry's head snaps up as he stares at Draco in disbelief.
Twenty minutes. The twins are pushing it close. Even the Weasleys, who are notorious for being late, are here and their children on the train.
“Shut up Zabini, you’re ruining the moment,” Harry repeated.
Mr. Riddle stopped. He examined the three of them, “I see,” he said slowly, “And did your family give consent, Mr. Potter? Mr. Malfoy?”
Harry looked at the two confused while Cedric rolled his eyes, “What do you mean?” he asked.
“My research?” Mr. Riddle interrupted. “You are using my research against me? Dumbledore even you mustn’t be so narrowminded? If I truly was Lord Voldemort, then my own son who I have gone through hell to get back is destined to kill me and me, him! And we both have no want in the slightest to kill each other. That is to say, even if this prophecy is real in the first place.”
Nagini said. Harry stared at her.
“Look,” Harry intervened, “it’s great that Ron became prefect, so why don’t you two just sod off? You’re only making Hermione fluster.” He gave a glare to Fred and George, who both rolled their eyes.
“And now he will never go there again,” Mr. Riddle said, “both because he is home, with me and Remus, as well as the poorly timed passing of Mr. and Mrs. Dursley.”
“Which we are working on, your Darkness,” Uncle Remus said. “However, the potions have not yet taken a liking to me and Sirius… well he is much to stubborn to put it that way.”
“Come on, I know a fix me up,” Ron said, throwing off his blankets and grabbing for a pair of jeans. Draco quickly looked away and then rolled out of his own bed to get dressed, slower than Ron as he wanted to fix his hair while Ron just rubbed his hand through his. Draco grabbed his keys out of habit and followed Ron.
“Thank you,” Harry said to Blaise. Turning to Draco, he said, “Boyfriend?”
There was a jump at Voldemort’s name. Mrs. Weasley gave a sharp gasp and almost bumped the table while Tonks almost fell from her chair. Dumbledore, however, stayed calm. “You saw Voldemort, yesterday?” he asked.
“And the end result?”
“What that you’re suddenly a dark wizard?” Draco snarled. “Is that supposed to impress me Potter? Think we’ll be best buds now that you’ve learned your first curse? As if.”
Breakfast arrived and Harry was amazed that he could work on an essay for Transfiguration as he ate, leaving the empty plate on the small table. An hour after it arrived, the plate vanished, and Harry was left with his heat and classwork. Time moved agonizingly slow for the Omega. He forwent his pants long ago as his hole just continued to leak with need and his cock begging for attention. It would come in waves, his cock hardening and softening periodically but the end result left his lower regions sticky and the teen panting. He was somehow able to finished his essay for Professor McGonagall, as well as his homework for Professor Flitwick and Professor Sprout when his watch went off. Classes were over and he somehow worked through lunch. He did not feel hungry in the slightest and as he looked at the table, he saw that there was no plate just as Madam Pomfrey told him. He stood up and took a breath as he pulled his pants on. “Come on Riddle, just walk quickly,” he muttered. He could feel a strong wave of arousal coming, and he needed to be in the Room of Requirement before it hits him.
“A werewolf,” Draco said. “During the first war, father told me stories of how he would steal kids, do …stuff to them and turn them. He’s savage, an animal given human form. It is a certainty that Voldemort will call on his aide during this war, just as he did with the giants.”
Still struggling, Harry gave out a silent gasp as shadow hands reached through the barrier. Harry reached for them, grasping onto one. It was warm, inviting, and Harry held on strong. The other hands circled around Harry, the shadows of the darkness cradling him, driving away the mist and carrying the boy across the barrier.
“I don’t care about that! Students are supposed to get to my class five minutes early! You are two minutes and as such you are late!” Ms. Samael said. Harry couldn’t help but notice that she had a rather sharp nose. “Now get into the only seat left next to Mr. Malfoy and kindly remember to come on time tomorrow!”
Harry could not help himself; Abandoning his search for the Snitch, he turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a long figure at the far end of the pitch, hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted towards him…
“It’s fine,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Look, you had a bad date let’s move on and forget about it. What to play some Wizards’ Chess?”
“I was hoping you’d say that,” Niall chuckled, and his hand moved to the back of Neville’s head. He closed the distance between them, kissing Neville with an animalistic need. Neville moaned in the kiss and pressed back, Niall loving the feeling of Neville against him. The kiss was quick but rough, leaving Neville’s lips bruised and slightly puffed as Niall pulled away. “You’re mine now Nev,” he breathed, “and I’m going to show you every fucking day how you’re beautiful.”
“Yes, Potter,” Voldemort chuckled, “he is now my son… and soon your son-in-law.”
Harry turned to Theodore Nott and smiled, “Thank you Nott, I think I will,” he said pleasantly.
“Do you know who it was that leaked that you’re an Omega? And about your relationship with Krum?” Theo asked.
“I am not a girl!”
Harry felt his heart stop for a second, his mind instantly going to the dance. “Do you think,” he said, “that Lucifer will try something during the ritual dance?”
“Oh—oh I’m sorry Harry,” Hermione said. “Anyway… do you know what you will do during the Full Moon?”
“It shall be done at once,” Mr. Malfoy said. He snapped his fingers and a dozen house-elves appeared. “You are to made a grave fitting for the Dark Lord,” He commanded.
“That said, while Hogwarts and the Ministry do not have a specific path planned out for your goals, I believe that your current classes are all perfectly reasonable in helping you with your objectives. Most obviously, Defense of the Dark Arts as well as Charms, Transfiguration, as well as Potions, which I have explained to Mr. Malfoy,” Professor McGonagall said.
“Mine was the opposite,” Sirius smiled. “Second best day of my life.”
“Hmm? Oh Ancient Runes,” Harry answered. “We were allowed to make our own schedule for our third year and Vik—Niall and I decided to try Ancient Runes.”
“How about Charlie? You like older guys right?” Ron said desperately, “anyone but Malfoy!” Harry found himself laughing. It wasn’t cruel, or vicious, just laughing, pure and joyous.
“Slughorn told me, Blaise, and McLaggen to come visit him any time we can but barely said goodbye to Neville,” Harry explained.
“About a couple hours ago,” Hermione nodded. “You came here with Dumbledore, right? How was it? Where did you go?”
“They are not. Harrison, Harry, you are my son, my precious memory of Adrian. You are the legacy that we created, our baby boy. And look at you, you’ve grown into a beautiful Omega, and now that I’ve found you, I’m never letting you go,” Voldemort said. He then shocked Harry as he grabbed the boy and pulled him close, hugging him tightly.
“But I need to do more,” Draco begged. “Please Harry, let me help.”
Harry was not the only one broken by Mr. Riddle’s laughter. Chaos erupted in the stands, people screaming or demanding questions. The Aurors in the room all took out their wands uncertainly, aimed them at Mr. Riddle as he continued to laugh. Up in his seat, Scrimgeour screamed for order, banging his gavel but nobody listened. Dumbledore relaxed his pose, looking satisfied at his revelation, as though everything was turned around. Next to Harry, Remus sniffled, and out of reflex, Harry reached out to squeeze the older Omega’s hand.
“Because I see my friends coming aboard, and I’ll not be the one explaining why you’re here,” Theo said, with a sadistic smirk on his face. Harry shook his head, and sat up, doing his best to feel as though he belonged in the compartment. The train started moving, and a few moments later the compartment door slid open, Crabbe and Goyle, looking as thick and dumb as ever, stood there. “Move,” one of them grunted.
“They do,” Harry sighed. “It makes me a little nervous about going to the Academy, honestly,” he said. “I’ve never been around people my age, except Cedric Diggory, my neighbor, but even then we didn’t exactly hang out. And there’s Draco of course,” Harry smiled softly.
“Of course you read thoughts,” Harry gritted out. The cut was now five inches long, going down his arm. The pain was immense and Harry screamed and whimpered as he blood drained out of the cut, along his arm and dripped down into the cauldron.
Harry nodded and allowed Draco to pull him out of the café, the blond nodding to a very handsome man on the way out. They stepped into a cloudy street with large shops pushed against one another, streetlamps still lit as witches and wizards dressed in heavy cloaks shouldered their way to and from the various shops. It somehow seemed a happier place than Knockturn Alley, in Harry’s opinion. The shops were all colorful instead of the moody greys and blacks that the shops in Knockturn Alley shared, and the people were talking with each other in quick French, instead of having the solemn, suspicious shifty-eyed silence and look that the wizards who frequent Knockturn Alley usually have. Even though he couldn’t read the names of the shops, Harry found his eyes wandering like the first time he entered Diagon Alley, looking at all the colorful shops.
“Yeah, it came out at the perfect time for me,” Draco smiled, looking at the keychain fondly. “In fact, I even dressed up as one of the characters one time, with Daphne.”
“Ron!” Mrs. Weasley said, “Watch your language!”
Uhhh I ran out of written chapters. Oops. Should work on fixing that lol. Also DRACO! HOW DARE YOU!!
Mr. Malfoy stared at Harry, his stoic expression breaking for a sly smile, “Perfectly, my lord,” he said, and he fell to his knees in front of Harry. Harry smiled.
“We will,” Harry said, giving her an easy smile. He grabbed Niall’s hand and they pushed themselves together to fit into the fireplace.
“What is it, Harry?” Hermione asked.
Harry couldn’t feel the glamour at first. They appeared directly into a clothing shop that Harry has never gone into, and he was facing a mirror as the world came into view. There weren’t many changes, his hair was longer, and his eyes were now brown. But still, it was enough for Harry to stare at the mirror a second longer than usual to recognize it was him. Even his glasses changed, turning from the round frames to a thinner, more sleek design with a slightly thinner frame. He took them off and turned them over as he examined them and slid them back on.
“False, yes,” the demon nodded. “However, I think I’ll talk more about that later, my sweeties. Come boys, let’s get to class.” Draco and Harry nodded and led Blaise to Basics of Elements, taught by Ms. Samael.
He squinted against the light as he made his way to the growing darkness. The cloud became bigger until it consumed the horizon. The two did not mix Harry noticed as he approached. The whiteness stopped and the darkness began exactly at a detailed line, almost like a barrier. Harry reached it and peered into the darkness, feeling nothing, seeing nothing from it, yet he knew that the darkness was where he had to go. He took a step towards it but felt a restraint. His body felt heavy. The mist gathered and thickened around his feet. He felt its weight and struggled. He opened his mouth to yell “let go!” but gave out a shock when he found he had no voice. He tried to scream, tried to curse, and yet nothing came out. Nothing broke the silence. He struggled, and the mist held on. He reached for the darkness ahead, only for the mist to gather around his hand and try to pull it down.
“What do you want from us?” Harry asked. “You already destroyed our lives by forcing us to transfer to Hogwarts. You cannot give us the smallest happiness of both of us being in Slytherin?”
Just in case this wasn't serious, this story is basically my cheesy B movie romance because, well, we all need a cheesy feelgood romance every now and again.
“As for you,” she said, looking at Harry. “I don’t serve lying sluts Omegas here, get out!”
He placed the dress back and then moved over to pick up an outfit from the right. It was a black suit with red rhinestones on the shoulders, designed in such a way that it looked as though they were bleeding. Just as the girl’s, there was a pentagram over their hearts, however in that pentagram was an icon of a sword, piercing the circumference of the circle. There was a tie that came with the suit jacket, as red as red can be, along with black leather gloves with red underhand. The pants were sleek and black as well, with no design whatsoever. “The boys’ is much more simplistic, yet still hold important symbolistic value. The shoulders look to be bleeding, carrying our values and traditions can be a dangerous task, my children. The shoulders bleeding is a reminder of the threat we’ve faced in the past, and the unseen threats we may face in the future. Next, like the girls, you have a pentagram over your hearts, showing ownership and loyalty to Lord Lucifer, however we have a sword to show that we are his warriors. We will fight and kill his enemies on his command and penetrate our loyal woman when he wills it. The red is to show sexual passion that warms cold winter days, passion for our Lord and for each other, yet always remember girls to save yourselves for our Lord. The gloves are twofold, the leather shows our dominance over the fairer gender while the red symbolizes the boiling blood in our bodies and loins that calls out for demons’ blessing.”
during the break... bad things but when I went to bed, yeah, all I can think of...” Ron couldn’t finish his thought.
With a sharp crack, a house-elf appeared wearing a potato sack with a very ornated M on it. “What can Blinky do for Master Draco?”
“Alpha Gamma Kappa. Sounds stupid, I know, but hey they’re frat boys and they have booze,” Ron grinned. “Come on!”
Mr. Malfoy was just as tall and just as coldly menacing looking as he was the first time Harry saw him. His cold steely eyes swept across the room before walking in. His eyes landed on Harry. “So, not only have the feminine wizard decided to date my son, it decides to steal him from me?” he asked.
“Yes Sir,” Harry moaned, turned on by the idea of the shadow-walkers watching them as they worked. He opened his mouth greedily and licked the cock head before swallowing Draco’s length whole. His gag reflex gone, Harry closed his eyes in bliss and moaned as he moved his head up and down the cock, feeling the member heat up and stiffen inside him. Moaning, Harry pushed forward until his nose was buried in Draco’s pubic hair. He breathed in the musk and smell of his lover, his brain going light as Draco’s hands pushed Harry down, holding him there. “Fuck,” Draco cursed. He kept his hands on Harry but allowed the boy to move as his own will, swallowing and slurping at the thickening cock. “You’re such a good cocksucker Harry,” Draco groaned.
“Umm… hello.”
“I don’t know,” Niall frowned.
The Alpha cleared his throat and swallowed heavily as his cheeks immediately blushed. “Hey Boot, I mean Terry—uhh,” Ron began awkwardly. He took a step back, but Harry immediately patted his shoulder, squeezing hard as he gave the Alpha a hard look. Ron stayed and blurted out in one breath, “I want you to go to Hogsmeade with me tomorrow!”
“Yes sir,” Harry said.
Sirius nodded and smiled at the idea, “Yeah, yeah I would like that very much,” he said. He finally let go of Harry and clasped his shoulder. “Come on,” he said, “you can tell me all about Quidditch, and everything else that I’ve missed.”
“Noted,” Draco hummed. “Harry, come on, we should go and calm your twin down if he isn’t freaking out.” He turned to Viktor and offered his hand. Krum took it in a strong handshake and turned to give Harry one last hug.
“How about actually eat food and not just the scraps of it?” Niall asked. Remus, still frowning, nodded. “And chores! Would you make us do all the chores?”
“No answer… very well,” the Dark Lord said. “I will remember this. Now, tell me about our allies, how are the giants in the mountains…”
“Bill doesn’t like him either,” Fred said.
“Highly impossible,” Lord Voldemort said. “You should know this Harry. The essence chooses the shape it wants to appear to their warlock or witch. You have no control over their shape.”
Harry nodded. He looked at Draco and the two stood up. “Good night Draco,” Harry blushed. He glanced at his Uncles and leaned in quickly, planting a chaste kiss on Draco’s cheek. Uncle Sirius looked a vivid red but said nothing.
“I’m sorry, ma’am,” Harry said a little meekly. “I didn’t mean any harm.”
Voldemort nodded, “Be careful, my puppy,” he said.
“So rude,” Blaise chuckled. He snapped his fingers and the mattress changed, raising above the ground as dark heavy-looking comforters and blankets and what looked like leather pillows. Harry felt his cheeks grow red at them and Blaise winked, “I’m just a simple demon who
“But you’re so pretty,” Ron said.
“Yeah,” Draco nodded. “Not that bad.”
, was originally borrowed from the Gaelic people, marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter and the darker half the year. Naturally, when the Devil’s worshipers rose in covens, and witches and warlocks began to become more spread out, the Celtic origins of the holiday was taken over by the demons and deviltry found in Hell, and a new origin was born. An origin that Mr. Riddle was far more enthusiastic to share with the students of the Academy in the Church of Blackest Night during rehearsal.
