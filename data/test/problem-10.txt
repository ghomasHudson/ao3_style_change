"Oh, Harry," she groaned, looking even more distressed at his joke. "It's really not like that, it's just –"
"He's shocked, understandably," Neville answered after a moment, feeling better after seeing Harry was actually worried about the other man. "I think it dredged up a lot of painful memories for him. He tries not to think about – about that time of his life. Nothing that happened was his choice. Hell, you know that. You were there at his trial."
"Both of us?" Harry asked, his attention back on the manuscript. They'd been working on details for their upcoming wedding ceremony for more than a month, and Harry felt fairly useless in every area but the food.

was late, and it was throwing off his entire day. He'd spent the week since his unfortunate run-in with Potter – because that was all it was, and it ended badly not because he was jealous, but because he hated the prat, he assured himself – settling into a comfortable routine. He'd read several newspapers with his breakfast tea before taking the Floo directly from the chateau to his office in London. He'd taken to turning down all evening and early morning invitations and appointments, both business and pleasure, so he could spend more time in France.
Draco wondered, hoping he could redirect his thoughts enough to avoid using the spell again. It wasn't exactly painful, but it wasn't a comfortable sensation, either.
"Sir," he said formally, inclining his head at Snape a though he weren't sitting there completely starkers and the man
Harry sat up, pulling Teddy up with him. Ron and Hermione weren't due back from their honeymoon for another two weeks. Had something happened?
Still, any of their fellow seventh years – or one of the professors – could wander in at any time. It made Hermione’s plan dangerous enough to heighten her arousal.
to Harry when he'd had a long chat with the portrait last week, thanking him for furnishing what he called a 'decent-enough children's potion laboratory' for Caleum.
at Harry and he didn't really have anything to do with the situation. How must Draco feel? "Why, Harry?"
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They belong to JKR. Thanks to Kamerreon for her reassurances and her editing skills!
Harry nodded, smiling at the witch who slid a salad plate in front of him.
"And last week he sent me a bottle of cask-aged Balsamic Vinegar of Modena," Draco continued, oblivious to Blaise's blank look. "Just because I said I liked a good aged balsamic on strawberries."
Snape smirked, enjoying the absolutely outraged look on his godson's face. He knew Potter had told Draco about the unfortunate incident he was referring to – the wizard had asked him about it a few weeks ago, after discovering Potter's identity and correctly guessing which professor the boy had been attracted to.
really
He looked up, rolling his eyes when Draco just quirked a brow at him.
Draco hesitated, waiting until the pull of the potion was too much to ignore before answering in a flat monotone.
Harry stepped out from behind the largest Christmas tree, grinning from ear to ear. Draco's heart stuttered at the sight of the wizard standing before him, soft white snowflakes sprinkled in his messy dark hair, quickly melting into shiny, iridescent droplets. He was wearing a Gryffindor scarf and a heavy cloak like Draco's, holding three pairs of ice skates in his bare hands.
"Thank you," several people chorused at once, making Hermione blush. She hadn't realized how annoyed her friends had been with her constant stream of questions.
"It was his idea," Harry murmured, Draco's fingers tickling his lips. "He and Teddy came to me more than a month ago. He wanted it to be a surprise."
"I'm putting them with you because I know I can trust you," she continued, and Harry's stomach dropped. He had a good idea of what was coming next. "I know you'll do your best to make them feel comfortable, which shouldn't be too hard, since they're friendly with most of the other guests."
Draco looked away, angry with himself for getting drawn into Potter's little game. He'd come here to cancel his account so he could forget about the prat, not engage him in conversation. Draco found the dark-haired wizard alluring, but that was it, he assured himself; he was suppressing the urge to smooth his robes to make sure they were covering his burgeoning erection. Really, it was like he was a schoolboy again. He almost laughed at the thought of sitting in Sev's classroom at his advanced age, getting tips for managing his libido again.
"Draco Abraxas Malfoy, Head of the House of Malfoy, Heir to the House of Black," Kingsley continued, drawing a surprised look from Harry. Draco shrugged – he'd assumed Harry knew he was next in the inheritance progression as the eldest male descendant of the Black Line.
"Shit. I'm sorry," he groaned, rubbing his hands briskly over his face. He needed to wake up.
His wand trembling in his hand, Theo turned his gaze to the parchment, repeating the incantation. This time, to his surprise, the parchment shivered and sprouted a thin layer of bark across its surface.
"A few
," Hermione said with a thoughtful frown, tying the twine around the plain brown paper with a spell when it kept slipping through Harry's fingers. "Are you sure it will count?"
"Thanks for coming, Kings," Harry said, squeezing Kingsley's hand affectionately. He reached behind him, grabbing Draco and pulling him forward. He'd never known the blond to be shy, but it seemed like he was hesitant to address the Minister on his own. "This is my intended, Draco Malfoy. Draco, I'm pleased to introduce you to Kingsley Shacklebolt."
Draco inclined his head, letting the subject drop. He fully intended to find out the particulars of Harry's duel with Cartwell, but it was clear Harry didn't want to pursue it tonight.
"Caleum Alexander Malfoy, you have petitioned the Ministry to allow Harry James Potter-Black to adopt you. Is this your wish?"
"I'm sorry," Harry whispered again, his lips against Draco's ear. "God, Draco, I'm sorry. I wish this wasn't necessary. I'm sorry."
"You could have tipped me off to stay away from that subject or something," he continued, oblivious to Pansy's bewilderment.
Draco bit his lip, unsure why he was so upset that Harry had Disapparated before he could explain. What was Potter to him, after all?
: MustLoveQuidditch
They'd already viewed that memory, though Draco took no solace from the knowledge that Harry had been there as well. He already knew Dumbledore had been dying, and that he'd asked Sev to kill him so Draco didn't have to. It was one of the first conversations he'd had with his godfather after his portrait woke.
The Auror remained silent, and Draco felt more answers being pulled from him.
time, don't drink so much so fast," Bill said, rolling his eyes. "I haven't had to use that spell since we found Percy flat-out tanked in the back yard after he proposed to Penelope the first time and she said no."
"Thank Blaise. It was his idea," he said, snorting. "Hair Thickening Potion? Leave it to a Slytherin."
"Really, thank you," she said, smiling slightly.

, Hermione. Namely getting Ron there on time with his robes on the right way. Everything will go beautifully," he said, ducking when she threw something at him. The Muggle pen bounced off the wall, skittering across the floor.
He let his fingers touch the letter in his pocket the one Potter had slipped to him this evening when he'd passed him on the street. He'd watched Draco cast
Ron cleared his throat, waiting until one of the junior Aurors on his team had left the room, leaving him alone with Draco.
Pansy gave him a small smile. If Draco really had made that food, there was no question it would taste marvelous, and she'd bet her company that there were a few bottles of excellently paired wine inside that seemingly bottomless basket as well.
"Harry?" Draco asked, blinking at the unexpected appearance of Harry's head in his fireplace. They'd just seen each other yesterday, a quiet dinner with Cal at the chateau, and didn't have any plans for today.
"You were just a
"It's got to slow down, yeah?" Harry asked, accepting the hand Draco offered to help him stand. They leaned against each other under the shower for a moment, propping each other up. "I mean, we're not kids anymore –"
It was unexpected that I would meet an old acquaintance by random chance and find myself instantly attracted to him.
"Draco Abraxas Malfoy."
Draco fell back against the pillows exhausted from the little bit of movement he'd managed. His head throbbed, the haziness growing with each passing moment.
"I suppose you're right, Hermione. I could send him a few naked pictures of myself in my next email; that would clear things right up," he said, testing his theory.
“Excellent,” Hermione purred, flicking her own wand to banish the half-Transfigured parchment and replace it with a new sheet. She uncrossed her legs, giving Theo a feral smile when he watched the movement carefully. “Again.”
Harry shook his head still stunned the spell had worked. Something had happened when it was combined with Ron's
Even Harry was listening intently. He knew the law, of course, but he'd never heard the specifics of how it came into being. Ron, who like Neville had grown up with the story, listened with disinterest while scanning the restaurant for trouble. They'd come to the Muggle diner for the sole purpose of evading the wizarding press, and he wanted to make sure their private conversation stayed private.
"It looks like he's made more than enough for one," Harry said, looking up at Pansy. "Would you like to join me?"
Harry nearly choked and squeezed his eyes shut as he realized what Malfoy was taunting him about.
"I don't want to," a petulant voice pouted.
Harry flinched when Bill leveled his wand at him, swallowing as a wave of nausea overtook him. He wasn't so far gone that he didn't recognize the Sobriety spell the man hit him with, grimacing as the uncomfortable sensation spread through his body. He thought he might vomit for a moment, but thankfully fought the urge.
Pansy blinked, a huge smile splitting her face. "She?"

with Potter. Magically enabled or not, he'd had Potter's hand on his cock. He flinched when he felt the traitorous organ stir, obviously thrilled at the idea. Thinking Potter was fit was one thing – the man clearly had a fabulous body and was blessed with boyish good looks that appealed to something visceral in Draco. But to actually have had one off with
Harry dropped to his knees, an odd feeling of pride sweeping through him when the little boy flinched but did not retreat, grey eyes meeting green head-on.
"And alerting you to my presence?"
"It must not be working," the older man spat, kicking the other man's chair. "Go get another bottle. Test it on yourself, then bring it to me."
"Yes," Harry answered, his hips bucking as he felt Draco's hand fly over his cock, his fingers still buried in his arse. "Now."
Fifteen minutes late. Draco crossed his arms, his eyes narrowing as he watched the fireplace. Harry had really better have a good excuse, because –
Harry stepped down off the stool, retreating behind the make-shift curtain to change out of the stiflingly hot tuxedo. He made a mental note to check with Molly to make sure they were blanketing the park where the ceremony would be with Cooling Charms. He didn't want Ron sweating his way through the bonding, after all.
People always talked about how a bride glowed, and they were right. Hermione was no exception – she looked ravishing, and so happy it almost made Draco's heart hurt to watch. But Weasley – he looked like he'd gotten every birthday and Christmas at once, so shining with love and joy that his entire face lit up.
Harry looked up, suddenly aware that both Hermione and Ron were staring at him.
"He said you were resting. I'm not bothering you, am I? I can come later," Harry said, unsure of what the protocol for visiting new mothers was.
"Harry James Potter!" she yelled, a small satisfied smile curving her lips when she saw him flinch at the tone and volume of her voice.
Draco looked away, focusing his gaze on another tableful of friends near the front of the room. His stomach lurched when he saw Pansy, who was openly staring back.
"Hi," Harry said, settling himself in front of the fire.
"But –"
She frowned, nodding as she thought about the inevitable fall-out when they revealed their identities. She was sure to bear the worst of it, since they would both be aware that she'd known from the beginning. Pansy was sure Draco would find a way to hold that against her, Unbreakable Vow or not
Draco's throat tightened as the potion continued to work, his muscles shaking with the effort of holding back the information. This was worse than any torture he'd ever been subjected to – worse, even, than the Cruciatus Curse Voldemort had been so fond of using on him every time he disobeyed.
"This is a potion to ensure there is no permanent damage to the tissue you bit through when you nearly severed your tongue earlier," he said, his tone disapproving. "The other is a muscle relaxant, which will help you get comfortable while your magic stabilizes. I'm not sure how you did it, or if it was even a conscious thought, but your magic forced the potion out of your system. You must be a very powerful wizard, Malfoy, to have been able to do that."
"A hundred?" he yelped, incredulous.
"Speaking of the future," Draco said, putting his glass aside so he could retrieve a large box from behind his desk. Harry's present.
Draco nodded numbly, as though it was the most natural thing in the world to do on a hot August afternoon.
Harry watched himself hiding from Death Eaters in Luna's house with almost absent curiosity. He pulled his gaze away, blinking in surprise at Draco's question.
Draco's wand," Blaise muttered with an eye roll, holding his hand out to catch the piece of hawthorn that came hurtling toward him. "Honestly, Draco."
Harry was silent for a moment, finally nodding with a heavy sigh. Hermione was right. He hadn't done it to intentionally embarrass Sly, much the opposite, in fact, but she had a point.
Theo frowned, raising his wand to try the spell again. He looked up, surprised, when Hermione stopped him.
Hermione looked down at the small bound volume, interest sparking in her brown eyes. Ron almost laughed, knowing she'd be up all night reading.
But the open laptop reminded him of Sly, and his heart sank. What if he
Hannah nodded, hurrying toward the door. She didn’t want to make poor Theo feel any worse about his failures than he already did. She opted for silence as she made her escape, and she wasn’t the only one who felt a tremor of relief when the heavy library door swung shut behind her.
those people?" Blaise growled, winging the file folder across the table angrily. It slipped off the other side of the polished conference room table scattering parchment and statements across the floor.
He heard the crowd gasp, turning slightly to see what had caused the commotion.
Harry grinned as he looked around the dingy bar, thoughts of his chat with Sly pushing to the forefront of his mind. He hadn't been lying when he'd admitted to coming to the pub for Single's Night, nor had he exaggerated how horrible the experience had been.
Harry and Ron followed, taking their places in front of Kingsley. The Minister had eschewed his traditional black Ministry robes for resplendent crimson, the same robes Arthur also wore. The traditional robes marked them as Harry's fathers. Kingsley's wife, Artentia, and Molly were wearing gorgeous silk dress robes in the same color. Draco turned slightly to smile at his mother and son, who were both wearing deep green robes that marked them as his family.
He expected them to argue, especially Ron and Hermione, but the others simply nodded, following Pansy's lead as she retreated to the kitchen. Blaise gave them a grim smile before placing the Pensieve on the table Harry pointed to, and Ron gave his arm a reassuring pat before following everyone else, drawing the study doors shut behind him.
"Minister Shacklebolt, I apologize," Neville said, startling everyone. No one had heard him slip into the drawing room. "Harry and Draco will join you shortly. They've been delayed, but it shouldn't be much longer."
Harry nodded, running a finger over the silver lettering. Any of their friends who hadn't known about the silver bond would know the moment they laid eyes on the invitations. If they ever went public with their marriage, Harry and Draco would be forever listed in the pages of wizarding history, one of only a few dozen silver bonded pairs since the time of Merlin, who had supposedly started the practice.
"He's just winding you up, Hermione," Harry said, squinting as he studied the antique stone basin in front of him.
Kingsley turned slightly to address Draco.
He had a deadline coming up, and he'd been too distracted by Sly's messages to really concentrate on it. Shoving the temptation to drink away his disappointment, Harry re-settled the laptop on his knees, his brow furrowing as he called up the document he'd been working on and began to write. Maybe this forced separation from Sly would be a good thing – he might actually get some work done himself.
He turned to Draco, who nodded tightly. A short question and answer period was necessary, or else they risked an irate press that would dog them for the foreseeable future. They were sure to be besieged with crowds wherever they went, but they hoped that by giving the press conference they might have some semblance of peace from the press.
That had been an hour ago, and Harry was still no closer to finishing the chapters Hermione had demanded before making a dramatic Floo exit. He sighed, rubbing his face with his hands. His band of streetwise and hardened Aurors were stuck in a warehouse in Kent that had been struck by Fiendfyre; they had to find their way out without using magic, which would trip the wards left by the evil wizards they were chasing. The characters had been on the brink of death for weeks; Harry had tried writing the last three chapters of the book over and over again, but nothing worked.
Draco hummed his approval, biting his lip as he tried to decide what to do next. His regular email box was likely overflowing with messages, and some of them might well be urgent. He also had a few letters to read and respond to, and a dozen contracts that needed his attention before they could be sent out that afternoon.
He'd been working steadily since she left, but Harry still cringed when he heard Hermione's footsteps approaching. He'd managed about a dozen more charms, which meant there were still many to go. They'd set up their operation in the back room of the joke shop, since George had a few spare counters they could use to prepare and store the plants until the wedding on Saturday.
Harry smiled, taking the parchment George shoved into his hands.
"I have a delivery for you. A bottle of wine with a note. Shall I send it through?"
"Does he want to hurt father, too? Shouldn't father be here with us?"
"That's barbaric," Hermione complained, her words slightly slurred from too much celebration. "Buying someone's love?"
Blaise frowned, pressing a kiss against Cal's dark hair. Sometimes he was much too smart for his own good.
"Sorry, sorry!" He mumbled, brushing a bit of ash off his Muggle denims –
"The Malfoy Chateau is in Amboise, France. The only way to travel there if you haven't been entered into the wards is with me, Neville or Draco," he said in a rush, not releasing their arms. "I'll take you there now, if you're willing."
Harry sat up, glaring at the blond in the doorway. He quickly covered himself with the duvet when it was clear that Draco was about to open the door.
on him, since his arms were full of a squirming toddler.
Harry had Floo-ed to Pansy's office first thing that morning to cancel his account with Magical Dating Online. She'd tried to talk him out of it, but the stubborn Gryffindor wouldn't be dissuaded.
"And the modifications?"
The flames turned a bright green, and Harry stepped out of the fireplace. He was holding a small magenta bag – Draco's mind vaguely registered it was probably from that joke shop one of the Weasleys had opened, he'd heard Harry was a partner – and wearing an expression of contrite apology.
?" He sputtered, green eyes wide as he looked around the room.
"Harry, are you alright?"
Draco blinked as Harry became engulfed in a halo of riotous color, the silver of the bond snaking its way through blocks of deep purple and turquoise swirled with green, yellow and orange. The streaks of red were a surprise, but he couldn't help but smirk when he saw pulses of pure white as well, something he was sure would be conspicuously absent from his own aura, which was also rendered visible by the spell. He couldn't help but smirk at the mix of colors and the shocking streaks of white, irrefutable evidence that the Goody Two-Shoes Gryffindor was essentially pure and innocent at heart.
"– mustn't
"Of course I know who you are," Cal said, his tone dripping with an impressive mix of disdain and confidence.
"Of course," Draco said, his fingers flying across his keyboard as he logged in to his email, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the new messages for one from Gryffin.
Harry laughed again, fumbling to untie his apron. He lifted it over his head, tossing is onto a chair before pushing past Draco and running for the stairs. He was too old to be fucked on a kitchen table, he thought as he tore toward the bedroom.
He'd managed to avoid Malfoy so far, but he knew his luck wouldn't hold out much longer. Dinner was about to be served, and Harry would have to take his seat at their table soon. He took another swallow of the wine, making sure to smile broadly when he saw Hermione trying to catch his attention from across the room.
"We're frogs," Teddy said calmly, flexing his slimy green legs as though nothing was wrong.
“Last weekend you missed Hogsmeade –”
a present," he assured Hermione, touched that she worried so much about his courtship. True, it was annoying most of the time, but she did it because she loved him. And because she was desperate to find out more about the laws and traditions she didn't understand.
"Page 2."
Draco tucked a lock of Cal's black hair behind his ear, completely intoxicated by the picture he and Harry made. It was almost exactly the way he'd pictured them at Ron and Hermione's wedding, when he'd come across Harry cradling his sleeping godson. He hadn't been able to envision how staggered he would be at the sight of Harry pressing a fond kiss to Cal's forehead, though, or how fiercely

"No, thank you, Mr. Potter. I have to get home," she said, nodding. "I hope your experience with the agency is going well. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you need anything.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They belong to JKR, I'm just taking them out for a spin.
"You've got thirty seconds before I sink my cock into that naked arse of yours," Draco growled, his eyes flashing.
Hermione laughed, easing Theo’s zipper down. The sound was loud in the quiet room, but neither noticed. She’d just managed to unfasten the buttons and wrest his erection free from his boxers when the distinctive sound of the doors opening echoed through the library.
Hermione bit her lip, her eyes wide as she followed the unfamiliar ceremony. She was bursting with questions – Why give them three years to break it off? What happened if they decided not to marry next week; would they still be bound and unable to marry another until the term expired? Why have a ceremony of intent at all? Was all this pomp and circumstance necessary? Couldn't they just skip to a wedding ceremony? – but kept them to herself, knowing she'd have plenty of time afterward to investigate the matter thoroughly. She looked around, noticing for the first time that everyone else in the room was entranced, their postures stiff as though braced for some sort of blow.
"We've had a few last-minute additions. A couple more classmates that hadn't thought they could make it, and then Gin asked me to add two people as well," she said carefully, cringing as she looked at the newest name on the guest list.
"T-thank you, M-mister P-Potter," the man stammered, clearly out of his league.
"Yes, please."
Draco thought, his mind flitting through possibilities. Though they were an elite bunch, there were still hundreds of families Gryffin could be from. Draco shrugged, letting his finger break the pristine seal. His lips curved in a smile as the wax broke apart, already looking forward to the missive inside.
#13279
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. I love them like they were my own, but unfortunately, they're not.
Hermione laid her hand over his, squeezing it gently.
"You have a real taste for married men, don't you, Harry?"
Neville nodded, smiling slightly at the mention of Gin and Theo's daughter. He and Daphne had been out to see them the day before, and they made a perfect little family. He could hardly wait for it to be their turn, his stomach flipping at the thought of becoming parents.
Draco thought morosely, reaching onto the table beside him to grab the box of malted milk balls Harry had sent over earlier. At least he had chocolate.
"I take everything back I said about this internet dating thing, Harry," Ron said, sighing in delight after finishing his second piece of Pavlova, a large meringue shell that had been filled with fresh raspberries soaked in Framboise.
Draco shrugged negligently. He didn't care about his injuries, or how his body managed to survive resisting the potion. He just wanted to know that Cal was safe. He couldn't think of a way to ask without revealing more than Finnigan might know.
Draco shot them all a wolfish grin, quirking an eye at Hermione. She cast
Draco thought, his face still a mask of polite interest,
Harry snickered, wondering how Draco would react when he read it. He was sure the blond wouldn't like being cast as a woman, but Harry was a realist. Although homosexuality was accepted in the wizarding world, it still wasn't something most of the population was completely comfortable with. Not enough to buy books about a gay character, at least. He couldn't share their relationship with the world, and Harry realized that might not change for many years. Not until Cal was older or the climate in the wizarding world changed dramatically, where the Malfoy name was concerned. Still, he
Hermione's head disappeared for a moment, and Harry could faintly hear her yelling something to Ron about popping out for a bit. Seconds later, the green flames leapt, and Hermione stepped out into Harry's study.
found the perfect partner, and he'd let him walk away.
"So the
"Pans?" Draco asked, sticking his head into his study, wondering what would be so important the witch would Fire-call France looking for him.
"Crisis averted, then?" Blaise asked, his eyes crinkling merrily as he smiled.
No, that wasn't right either.
Harry rolled his eyes, shaking his head.
Harry nodded, unsure of what could have her so distressed. The wedding planning had been going smoothly so far, the entire thing so militantly organized that Harry was positive nothing would dare go wrong and risk Hermione's wrath.
Blaise smiled. He had been working for Draco in of his stable of in-house corporate lawyers for six years, so he knew Draco always put business before pleasure. He also knew his friend well enough to see that Draco was nervous and stalling. Blaise straightened out of his slouch, adopting a more professional posture and crossing his legs.
"– no recourse but to agree with Mr. Potter," Wedgewick said, his shrewd eyes glinting with reluctant agreement and something more, a slightly sinister calculation that Draco didn't care for.
She held a book out in her arms, waiting until Harry Summoned it from her. There was no question of one of them getting close enough to take it the normal way – it simply wasn't safe.
Draco chuckled, a dark sound that seemed to be directly tied to Harry's aching cock. He felt himself grow harder, something he'd not have thought possible just moments earlier, at the deliciously wicked laugh.
"You," Harry growled, clutching his pillow tighter. "You knew he was there!"
Neville almost growled in frustration when he saw Harry had no intention of elaborating on any of the questions he'd shot at him. He let the conversation drift to other things – Draco's reaction to the other gifts Harry had sent, an update on Daphne's pregnancy, Harry's ideas for his next book. He knew better than to press his former Housemate for more information than he wanted to give. Harry was surprisingly Slytherin in his views on sharing information – like Draco, he operated on a need-to-know basis most of the time.
Oliver drew his head back out of the fire, shaking some ash off his robes as the green flames dissipated. He'd promised Blaise updates on how things were going, and he'd just made his second Fire-call of the afternoon. No one knew what was keeping Harry and Draco, though they worried one of the men might be having second thoughts.
"Completely," Kingsley assured him, his white teeth gleaming as he grinned. He was beyond pleased to be officiating another wedding ceremony for Harry and Draco – this one the glamorous affair both men deserved, full of family, friends, laughter and champagne.
here,
Harry put on his most supportive face, trying desperately not to look as revolted as he felt lest Ginny let fly with another stinging hex. Ron's face turned a light shade of green and he quickly stood, offering to run to the bar to see if they had any on hand. Ginny nodded happily.
It was true, partially. The wards needed to monitor the health of the grapes had been extensive, and it hadn't truly been much more work to embed a few additional spells that would alert Neville or one of the others in the big, rambling chateau to trespassers. In his own way, Neville was as fiercely protective of Cal as Draco and Blaise were. He did everything he could to safeguard the boy, knowing Draco trusted him to watch over both Caleum and Narcissa when he was away.
Lord Harry James Potter
"I suppose not just any words though," he continued, his lips quirking. "Tell me, was it just the sound of his voice, or do you have some perverted kink for potions ingredients?"
Draco swallowed a sip of Scotch, enjoying the oaky flavor as it swirled over his tongue. As much as he liked the added bite of Firewhisky, he'd taken to enjoying a glass or two of Muggle variety from time to time. He favored a rich Scotch like he was savoring, which had been distilled near Hogsmeade, or a fruiter American bourbon, which he brought back from his infrequent trips across the pond.
Harry might have tackled Draco the second he stepped out of the Floo had it not been for Ron's restraining hand on his bicep. The tight squeeze reminded him where they were and what they had to do. The magic of the ancient spells that forged the courtship and marriage contracts was enhancing the natural attraction and pull he and Draco felt for each other, which meant Harry was nearly jumping out of his skin with need.
Ron clenched his jaw, willing himself not to respond. Wasn’t that

The boy nodded, disappearing without saying goodbye.
"It's not bad, Uncle Nev, I swear," he said earnestly, his grey eyes beseeching. "Please don't tell father or Harry we were arguing with Uncle Sev. It makes father angry, and Uncle Sev doesn't really like Harry anyway, so I don't want to make them fight."
be the first to break.
Sensus
Harry's green eyes blazed, and he gripped Draco's hands almost painfully.
The tiny Dumbledore figure waved his fist in Ron's direction, eliciting giggles from Teddy. He laughed harder when the small Hermione Granger shoved the Ron Weasley figurine, catching it off balance and sending it sprawling to the bottom of the box.
"Don't worry about this," he said, waving the small stack of parchment. "I'll take care of it. I'll send you an Owl after the meeting. You should go home, get some rest."
He finished his tea, finally caving to his curiosity and calmly unwrapping the gift. It looked like a book, and he figured Harry had probably given him a signed copy of the James Evans novel that had just been released.
Hannah motioned toward the small sapling still sitting on the table in front of him.
He bit his lip hard enough to draw blood, but the salty tang went unnoticed as he steeled himself to read about Potter's latest paramour. An open letter to the wizarding community. Potter certainly did have a flair for the dramatic.
Theo rolled his eyes and nodded. Draco’s exasperated tone meant trouble, and he knew it.
Ginny waved the chip in her hand dismissively, sending a shower of butterscotch and vinegar over the table. Both Ron and Harry flinched, but she took no notice.
"Harry!" Cal called, pulling his unresisting father across the snow toward the frozen pond. "Harry! Father's here! Can we skate now? Can we?"
Cal hopped down from the ledge, his sock feet barely making any noise as he snuck up on his godfather. Blaise was napping, sprawled uncomfortably on a Conjured sofa while Neville guarded the only entrance to the small cave.
had no one noticed that?
"Thank you, Madge," he said, bowing to her slightly. She grinned. She was 80 if she was a day, but Draco always flirted and joked with her. He turned to Blaise and nodded. "Blaise."
"These are untraceable?" Harry asked, looking up from the pile of creamy parchment invitations on the table in front of him.
was the witch Gryffin had alluded to, but she had assured him her labor had been quick and easy when he'd asked. Nothing like the ordeal Gryffin had relayed.
"Your daddy has lots of people who love him," Blaise said, pausing his tickles so he was sure Cal could hear him. "And he's definitely one of the smartest wizards I know, and I know a lot of wizards."
Of even bigger concern was the fact that his good friend was now completely melting over the fact that Harry had sent him a box of Muggle candy. Malted milk balls. Draco hadn't paused long enough to explain the odd gift – even odder than the autographed photo and several dozen Muggle DVDs with titles like
"We should tell Cal today," Draco said, pulling back from the embrace, but leaving his arm around Neville's shoulders. "He'll be over the moon at the thought of having a cousin!"
"A silver bond," she marveled, shaking her head. "Who'd have imagined it? A silver bond from a match made over the internet!"
the one who wants to keep it a secret."
Hermione grimaced, hoping Harry didn't fall for the man's story. Harry's prophecy aside, she still thought Divination was by and large a hoax, especially those Seers who claimed to have spirit visitations. The piece looked old and fragile enough to be of that provenance, but she highly doubted a Seer had anything to do with it. It was probably just a story to hike up the exorbitant price even more.
Cal murmured something sleepily, nestling deeper into Harry's arms. They'd spent the afternoon skating and playing in the snow, breaking for a quick picnic amid the twinkling Christmas trees before opening the pile of presents Harry had brought. As Cal had suspected, most were for him. The best – and most surprising – had been a tiny Crup puppy, which Harry trotted out from a hiding spot at the back of the greenhouse after Cal and Draco had unwrapped everything under the tree.
Zach glared at Ron, his frosty gaze shifting to Harry. The dark-haired wizard just smiled benignly, not making any move to expound on Ron's words. His careful mask hid the swirling emotions and thoughts in his mind, and the traitorous little voice that was insisting Ron was right. He
The thought of Malfoy revealing that tidbit of information to the press – which Harry fully expected he would – took care of the remnants of his erection, and Harry sprang to his feet, his napkin falling to the ground unnoticed.
Blaise had Flooed to the chateau shortly after Draco, having stayed behind to take care of any pressing business matters that needed immediate attention. He was almost as fond of Caleum as Draco was; he generally tagged along whenever Draco visited France, and he was often present on the nights Caleum came to Malfoy Manor for dinner several times a week. After checking in with Caleum, Blaise had returned to London to oversee any problems that couldn't wait for Draco's return, much like he had three years ago when Draco had taken a leave of absence to spend a year with Caleum in France.
"Listen to this one, Draco! He's perfect for you," Blaise said with mock delight, scrolling down to read one of the hundreds of ads posted to the online dating site Draco had joined the week before.
Draco huffed angrily, following Blaise through the chateau. He was surprised when they turned at the entryway, heading down the stone steps toward the grounds. Draco craned his neck, looking for his son's dark head. It was a nice day – perhaps he was out flying with Neville or playing in the gardens.
: If you haven't already checked it out, I posted an extra scene from MLQ on my author page yesterday. It's called Snape's Voice, and it shows the unfortunate reaction Harry describes to the sound of Snape's voice in Potions. Hilarity and wanking ensues! *grins*
Draco smirked, pleased to finally have the upper hand. He'd spent the last two weeks being continually shocked and delighted by Harry's generosity and thoughtfulness, and he was glad to be the one making the romantic gesture this time.
, but his traitorous lips refused.
"I didn't know," he said softly when the potion forced a response. "I don't approve of the things my father did."
“Oh,” Hannah said, finally rounding the corner and finding Theo’s study carrel. She looked around, confused. “Harry said Hermione was here, too. Draco told me you were working on Transfiguration. I’d love to watch.”

He nodded toward Draco. "Draco, you
He didn't look up as the footsteps stopped, though he could sense her standing over him, watching him as he crouched on the floor, moving another plant into the finished pile. He saw a take-away coffee cup appear in his peripheral vision, and Harry reached up, grabbing it without looking away from his task.
"I've been meaning to look you up," the man continued, leering suggestively at Harry in a way that made his skin crawl.
"They're saved by a Crup?" Hermione asked, her brow raised skeptically.
"Harry, many have said you left the wizarding world five years ago because you couldn't handle the pressure of being the Boy-Who-Lived. Is that why you took up with a Death Eater? Are you rebelling against the society that has made you an emblem of national pride?"
"I apologize, Mr. Wedgewick, but I really must be going," Harry broke in, thrusting his hand at the man so he was forced to take it. Harry shook their joined hands briefly, quickly releasing the man's slightly damp palm.
He raised his head, regarding her with bleary eyes. He absolutely stank – the sour smell of whisky fairly emanating from his pores. Harry didn't have a high tolerance for hard alcohol, so she doubted he'd actually finished that much of the open bottle – a suspicion confirmed when she noticed several pools of amber liquid dripping from the table onto the floor.
It was lovely and tender and sweet, but it wasn't what Harry wanted. He thrust up again, his green eyes so dilated they were nearly black as he watched sweat roll down Draco's perfect face.
"Draco Malfoy, representing Malfoy Industries," he said, standing and bowing slightly to the board.
"I want to be
MustLoveQuidditch
Draco nearly came undone at the word, snapping his hips back and thrusting harder, deeper. He bent Harry nearly in half, pounding into him as he leaned down to claim his mouth as well. Harry supported himself as best he could on raised elbows, his lips just barely able to meet Draco's in an unsatisfactory kiss.
"Any news?" She asked as Neville joined them, pausing to press a kiss to the little girl's forehead then repeating the gesture on his wife.
The room rang with absolute silence, the ragged breathing of the newly bonded pair loud within the confines of the drawing room. It was enough to snap Kingsley out of his stupor, and he grimaced slightly at his misstep before continuing.
"Eat. You need a shower, and we only have a few minutes," she said, crossing her arms as she leaned against the counter, watching him with narrowed eyes. "I told Abigail you had an emergency, but she expects us there this afternoon."
Ron laughed, shaking his head. If Lavender was so excited about the party, surely he could coax her out of her bad mood with some dancing and alcohol?
Ginny stroked Freddie's soft cheek, handing the sleeping baby off to Daphne when the other witch held her arms out expectantly. She sighed and stretched, grateful for the break. Freddie had been restless today, and she'd cried every time someone put her down.
"Just exactly
The dark-haired wizard took it gratefully, wrapping it around himself toga-style and grabbing his clothes from the sofa. He sent a hard look at Draco before stalking across the floor, opening what he assumed was the door to Draco's bedroom so he could dress in privacy.
Three days later, Harry was still waiting for his reply. Hermione's rational influence quelled his panic; surely Sly was still on his trip, and he would reply when he could. While Harry knew that was likely the case, he couldn't help but worry he had been too forward in his response. Sly's gesture with the wine had been so sweet, and Harry had admittedly imbibed several glasses before he hit send after writing his latest missive. Sly seemed sophisticated; maybe his sloppy approach had offended him?
Pansy nearly swallowed her tongue – Potter had confessed who he was? And Draco was still accepting gifts from him?
have a point.
wouldn't let me have a silver knife to chop –"
"I am pleased to present Draco and Harry Potter-Black and their son –"
"Well, yes," Neville said, his head snapping up when he heard footsteps approaching. Draco and Pansy came around the corner, stopping short when they saw them.
"Of course, that all depends on getting that zoning change approved," Blaise said, not even bothering to hide his grin, since Draco wasn't looking at him anymore.
He'd spent as much time as possible with Cal over the last week, and he'd come to the realization that Gryffin – Harry – would never stand for an innocent child to be hurt because of their relationship. It would be hard to keep things under wraps, but together, he was sure they could manage it.
Harry laughed again, something tight loosening in his chest. This little boy – this perfect copy of Draco, with olive skin and black hair – was everything and nothing like he'd expected in the frenzied hour since he'd learned of his existence. Beautiful, privileged, confident, smart, brave – Harry looked at Neville's hand on the boy's shoulder, following it up to offer an encouraging smile to the stoically silent man –
"By invoking
Delibero Pergo
Murmurs shot through the audience, and Draco turned to face Harry fully, his confusion clear on his face and through their bond. There were no other vows they could take – they were already bonded for all of eternity. What was Harry doing?
He didn't know why he hadn't left yet. He'd stayed through the cake cutting and the first dance, compelled back into the ballroom by a sense of propriety that forbade him to leave the reception without complimenting the happy couple and dutifully watching their nuptial milestones. Something intangible had kept him there, born either out of the desire to see Potter's eventual explosion or admiration of this calm, confident man the once-volatile Gryffindor had become. He wasn't sure which.
"Oh, for the love of –" Hermione hissed, jabbing Harry in the ribs. He'd fallen asleep – again.
Draco nodded dully, his eyes shifting to the tall mediwizard.
"And do you, Draco Abraxas Malfoy, Head of the House of Malfoy, Heir to the House of Black, swear on your magic that you have no other bonds or entanglements that would prevent you from legally wedding Harry James Potter?"
Harry faltered, wondering if Draco was struggling with him being Gryffin as much as he'd struggled with Sly's identity. "I was just thinking about you. I'd really like to –"
"No, Harry, no!" Teddy giggled, his eyes on Freddie to make sure he didn't hit her as he flailed. "No, you can't!"
"That's good news," Draco muttered, booting the machine and anxiously tapping his foot as he waited for the monitor to spring to life.
"I've already spoken with Neville," Draco said stiffly, hoping to avoid a drawn-out row with Blaise. He'd come to France for some quiet, after all, not to continue to rehash this ridiculousness.
Hermione nodded, tears clouding her eyes. She wanted Harry's wedding to be special, but circumstances were preventing that. It was complicated, just like most of the rest of Harry's life. Just once, she'd love for her friend to have a normal experience.
is your problem today?" Hermione asked, frowning when she caught Ginny staring out into the sea of people who'd already been seated for the ceremony.
, he thought ruefully, grabbing the bag from George's outstretched hand.
Hannah, not oblivious to the waves of fury rolling off Harry, stood quickly, wrapping an arm around Harry's waist. He wondered who she was protecting, him or her fellow Hufflepuff.
"Let's see how Slytherin he can be now that he can't hide things from me!" Harry laughed, ducking when Draco pretended to choke him.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. I don't own 'em, I just play with them from time to time.
“Not here,” he groaned, capturing her wrists in his hands and pushing her away. “Your room.”
"I'm sure. To be honest, I wasn't having much luck before –" he broke off, at a loss for words.
, he thought fondly, shaking his head.
Draco sighed, narrowing his eyes as he looked at the man who, against all odds, had become one of his closest friends. "Fine. Firewhisky, though."
"Oh, you don't have to tell
"Alright," Blaise said cordially, pinching the bridge of his nose. "
“Serves you right,” Theo muttered, tucking his growing cock back into his pants. He’d be fully hard again in just a moment if she kept standing there like that, one hand on her hip, biting her already full lips as she puzzled over what to do.
"Fine," Blaise said, a sad smile on his lips at Draco's pained expression. "You've owled him several times a day, and he loves the present you sent him, Harry."
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. If they were mine, the Epilogue would have been
"Neville needs you in the greenhouse," she said, settling on the floor beside Cal, heedless of the wrinkles the position made in her silk dress.
"Are you ready, mate?" Ron asked, and Draco had to bite back a laugh. He never thought he'd see the day when Ron Weasley called him
"I suppose I should have asked," he said sheepishly, risking a glance at Draco. He relaxed when he saw the other wizard was smiling.
Draco shivered and Harry wrapped his arms around him, transporting them to the next memory. It was no less traumatic, but he figured a change of scenery might shock some sense back into the blond.
"You need sleep," she said shortly, rolling her eyes when his hands flew to his face again, checking to make sure the glamour had held.
A shrill whistle blew, and Teddy grabbed the handle of Cal's trunk, motioning for the younger boy to follow him. Cal wrapped his fingers tightly around his owl's cage, giving his father and sister an awkward one-armed hug before dashing off after his cousin.
he thought uncharitably, closing the window without responding.
Charlie grinned, laughing when Bill shot them both a wary glance.
"No, they don't have frog legs," Cal said seriously, and Harry breathed a sigh of relief. It was going to be hard enough to end Transfiguration Spells on the others, though how a first and second year had managed it was beyond him –
He indulged himself for a few more seconds, already missing his son terribly. He wasn't surprised when Draco materialized next to him, his bright hair spelled brown and his distinctive eyes hidden by sunglasses. He handed their daughter over wordlessly, knowing his husband needed the comfort her small, warm presence could provide.
"We really should think about Fire-calling someone and telling them we're still alive," Harry panted, his legs trembling as he slid to the shower floor.
“It’s Hermione,” he said by way of explanation.
Hermione turned her attention back to the computer screen in front of her. Harry's ad was far from polished, but then again, so was Harry.
Blaise laughed and sat back in his chair, bringing his foot up to rest on his knee.
"Thanks, Pans," he said, his fingers itching to open the sealed note that was attached to the bottle.
"He won't," Harry answered, heaving his now mostly sober self up out of the vinyl booth. He hit both Ron and Seamus with a mild Obliviate, shrugging off the protests from Charlie that Harry never let anything fun happy.
," Caleum hissed, his jaw set angrily. They'd already had this discussion several times, and he was so embarrassed that his dad was bringing it up again – this time in
"I don't want to know," he said, giving Draco a shrewd look before turning and walking out of the portrait.
"One can only hope," she muttered, dousing the lights on their way out. She had a feeling things were going to get even more uncomfortable when Harry and Draco could touch each other freely. She just hoped they waited until everyone left before jumping each other tomorrow.
Harry's smirk grew when he saw the outraged faces of many in the crowd. Luna, standing toward the middle of the pack, was the lone exception. She was smiling broadly, sending the occasional wink to her goddaughter.
"Alright," she said, throwing her hands up in the air. "Shorter, then. Tousled, though. Sexy."
Harry looked at Draco, who hadn't moved from the chair. One elegant eyebrow was arched, and Harry knew his tardiness had been noted.
: MustLoveQuidditch
, would it? Surely not.
"Ah, yes," she said, settling onto a bar stool near the counter and snagging a piece of spinach from the salad Draco was preparing. "I suppose they will be cousins, won't they? Growing up together, at least."
, he reminded himself, willing away the beginnings of his burgeoning erection.
"Oh, Harry," she said, her tone exasperated. "Budge over. I'm coming through."
Even Blaise had turned out for Harry's birthday, and Grimmauld Place was teeming with people. He'd wanted to keep it as low key as possible, so Harry had opted to have the celebration at home instead of out at his favorite pub, as he normally would have.
Harry nodded, staring at his feet. The fact that Draco had this whole other life he knew nothing about was really starting to hit home, and it was worrying him. Draco had agreed to the courtship, but had he really intended to progress to the next step? Harry chewed on his bottom lip, his mind focusing on the little boy he'd met earlier. Draco's son.
"Aunt Hermione," Teddy groaned, clutching the box tightly as he stomped up the stairs. "You don't need to tuck me in. I'm not a little boy!"
Blaise had been by earlier, assuring him Cal was safe and that no word had spread yet to the wizarding papers. Everyone was back in the chateau, which Blaise assured him had only suffered minimal damage in Cartwell's attack. He'd also brought Harry's present from the day before with him, a small vial of Pensieve memories. Draco had sent it home with Blaise, unwilling to take the risk of someone picking it up by accident at St. Mungo's. He had a feeling it wasn't something Harry would want anyone else to see.
"If you'd stop moving, Mr. Potter, this would go much faster," she said, her words distorted by the line of pins stuck between her lips.
Harry smiled sleepily, pushing his computer to the far side of the bed and allowing the letter to settle on the bed. He was too tired and wrung out from finishing his novel to answer tonight, he decided. Sly had given him a lot to think about.
He watched her warily, knowing she'd wait until they were alone before laying into him. So he was surprised when she moved past him to step toward the Floo. He always went first to open the wards at Grimmauld Place.
"Alright," he said equably, laughing when she gaped at him in surprise. "We're all adults now, Hermione. We're hardly going to hex each other on sight."
"Holy shit," he whispered, studying the plain leather band closely.
Hermione braced herself on his shoulders, reaching up to kiss him. Her lips pressed against the stubble on his jaw line, hidden by the glamour.
, he corrected himself,
Draco turned slightly in his chair and called up his e-mail. There were several messages from others responding to his post, but Draco skimmed over those seeking out the one he was looking for. Triumphant, he motioned Blaise behind the desk so the two men could read it together.
"How was I to know Potter would be here?" Severus asked, shrugging negligently. "Besides, it wasn't anything I hadn't seen before. Although Potter
Hermione shook her head, wringing her hands. "No, your bond won't calm down until you are married," she clarified, wincing at the shocked looks on Harry and Draco's faces. "I'm so sorry, but you'll have to be married immediately if you want the bond's reactions to diminish."
"Are you sure, Harry? You shouldn't give up just because you've had a setback," Pansy said, regarding the wizard seated in front of her with concern.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They don't belong to me.
"Er, Angie," he said, his eyes downcast.
"What?"
"I'm fine. We've had Freddie in here with us, but I think Theo just wanted some time alone with her," she said, her eyes sparkling at the thought of her husband bonding with their daughter. "He had to dash out just after she was born for a business meeting, and he felt terrible about that."
"Do –" Draco hesitated again, his mouth going dry. Even though his face was distorted in the green flames, Harry looked utterly fuckable, his mouth slightly open, his eyes twinkling with amusement and lust. "Do you want to come through?"
She smiled, surprised at how happy she felt for Draco – and how that happiness was tempered with disappointment, since under different circumstances, she really did think Harry and Draco might be good for each other.
"That's –" Ron said quietly, his eyes locked on Harry and Draco, who were still holding hands. The sparks everyone had seen literally fly between their skin, had gone as quickly as they'd begun, but the sight left everyone speechless. He had no idea how to explain it.
"That's odd," Harry said, looking around the table. A few other singletons from their Hogwarts days were seated there, but the table should have been full. "Are we missing a few people?"
let Sly win.
Harry woke cranky. There had been no word from Sly for days, and on top of that Hermione was pushing him to meet his latest deadline.
"Oh, shit."
"Merlin, Hermione," he groaned when her hand fisted in his hair, pulling them even closer.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry fidgeted nervously in the small room behind the staff table. He could hear the Sorting begin out in the Great Hall, his body rigid with anxiety as he waited for his son's name to be called – and the uproar that would likely follow.
, Draco thought, studying Potter's striking green eyes, full of love and pride. Draco tamped down a feeling of what he refused to acknowledge as jealousy at Potter's expression, telling himself it was merely the old rivalry between them rearing up again. Why should
Harry's hand was a blur as he stroked his cock furiously, pleased by the way his strokes made Draco pant and groan. He twisted his fingers, knowing he'd hit Draco's prostate again by the way the blond keened.
"It's a law.
Ron turned when Ginny joined them, narrowing his eyes at the meaningful glance she shared with Neville.
"Yes, sir, that is my wish."
Neville swallowed, panicking when he saw Ginny striding across the grass toward them. This was bad. Did Ron – could he really have figured it out?
"A life debt," Draco said flatly, his gaze trained on Harry's lifeless body in Hagrid's arms. "You testified for us because of a life debt."
Draco followed Harry down, grateful for the blind luck that seemed to so doggedly follow Harry. The same good fortune Draco had cursed as a teen was now serving him well; if it had been anyone other than Harry, he was sure they'd be sprawled on the floor at the moment instead of on a very comfortable sofa.
They made it up to the bedroom eventually, partaking in the scented bath Harry had drawn – perfect for sore muscles – and the soft sheets he had procured – deliciously soothing against sex-chafed skin. Harry stretched and yawned, resisting the urge to ruffle the blond hair on the pillow next to his.
"Fucking hell, Harry!" Ron shouted when the Auror hit the ground, his eyes blazing with anger as he watched his friend get to his feet shakily. "What the fuck, were you thinking?"
Ron coughed, looking away again. He seemed more comfortable with his gaze locked on the door instead of on the man in the hospital bed.
"Harry, is there any truth to the rumor that you and Draco plan to have more children?"
Draco looked at him sternly. Blaise's beautifully tailored clothes made his current pose even more indolent.
Harry sat back, his jaw clenched.
"I'd be happy to explain to Abigail that her bestselling author couldn't meet the deadline for his latest book because he was going all emo about an email message sent to a man he has never even met," she said frostily.
hadn't tried to kill Dumbledore.
"Too right, Hermione," Harry said, shaking his head with mock exasperation. "Too bloody right. Now, did you come to help me write this ad or just to be a nuisance?"
Lavender shot him a small smile, rolling her eyes.
" – proper Potions Master
Ron smiled again, laughing as he envisioned Harry as a Slytherin. It was ridiculous, of course. Who was a better embodiment of pure Gryffindorishness than Harry? He shook his head, turning back to his sandwich. If Draco thought Harry had so much as a single Slytherin bone in his body, maybe they didn't know each other as well as he thought they did.
ran the office, not the other way around. In turn, Harry had shared a few stories about working with Hermione, though he hadn't named her. From his response, Sly had quite enjoyed hearing about the perils of working with one of your oldest friends. They'd both been careful not to divulge what they actually did for a living.
he didn't have someone else write the emails. He flushed, remembering how Hermione hadhelped him write his profile and his initial response to Sly. And what had that gotten him anyway? Two months of trading emails with
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to introduce Messieurs Potter-Black."
Harry explained to himself, conscious of the blood pounding through his veins in a way he'd never been before.
Draco swallowed, the need to feel Harry's skin against his own was almost overpowering. Neville's arm tightened around his shoulders, letting him move forward, but restraining him at the same time.
Draco nodded, sending Blaise a silent word of thanks for defusing the situation and cluing him in to who the woman was – no doubt the fuming witch in front of him would be even angrier had he blanked on her name.
Hermione was enraptured, her attention completely drawn away from the mangled napkin in her lap. Neville took a sip of coffee, being much too tired lately for tea, and continued.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They belong to JKR.
Caleum was silent for awhile, and Blaise thought the boy might have drifted off to sleep. He settled them back into the sofa, letting himself slip back toward sleep.
She heard the water shut off as she dug around for a pair of socks in his bureau, her curiosity raging. What could have upset Harry so much? She had a sick feeling it had to do with Sly, and Harry's confession. Had he told the man everything, or just that he was James Evans? Guilt nagged at her. After all, she'd been the one to insist he come clean.
"I'm sorry, Draco," Harry whispered, pulling him closer. The scene dissolved again, and Draco flinched as he saw Harry and his friends battling against a dragon, marveling – even through his horror – that they'd managed to ride it.
Draco laughed out loud, shaking his head at the blonde. He couldn't believe she'd asked that. Then again, it
, Blaise thought,
"He's not coming, dad," Cal said, sounding as exasperated as an: I'll-be-eleven-in-two-days-I'm-not-a-baby-dad, could.
"Aha!" He cried triumphantly when he read the words on the sheet. Hermione grimaced – she'd obviously lost. He handed her the small square of parchment. She groaned at the word that magically appeared, the moment he'd opened the envelope: Wrong.
The air was electric, shimmering with the power generated from the ceremony. It was clear that Harry and Draco's magic was extremely compatible, and that they were both very powerful wizards in their own right.
"Ready?" Draco asked, his mouth watering at the sight of Harry standing in front of him, completely naked and impossibly aroused.
"I did, and you're lucky I'm not hexing you for Fire-calling him. Honestly, Blaise, I'm an adult. I don't need looking after."
"I'll take it away, if I have to," Hermione warned, her voice stern.
That realization gave Harry the impetus he needed to demand obedience from his lips, a fountain of adoration pouring forth from his mouth as he came.
Harry and Hermione had been in favor of having a traditional Muggle ceremony, but Draco and Narcissa had been strongly against it. In the end, they'd decided to write their own vows, being careful to avoid any words that might have magical implications.
"Harry?
"The Traylor contract is solid. The land is already zoned for residential development, so it will be a snap to get the permits we need. It's truly a genius idea, building a gated and warded wizarding community. The lots will sell like caldron cakes," Blaise said.
Holy hell, had he really just said that? Harry's entire body tensed, his head reeling. A million other words – words he
He could tell she had more questions, but Ron just shook his head. He didn't want to break the moment between Harry and Draco. No one did.
" – an insult–" an unfamiliar voice was droning on, clearly upset. Draco strained, but couldn't make out the rest of it.
Hermione stood, transferring the laptop back to the table. She picked up her mug, taking one last swallow of now-tepid coffee, and carried it into the kitchen to place in the sink. Harry rifled around on his desk until he came up with the disc, which he held out for her.
conversation.
Draco blinked unsure of how having a vindictive Auror bent on revenge knowing he had a child was cause
Draco snickered from his place on the chair. Harry looked up, noticing the portrait of Severus Snape above the mantle for the first time. Had that always been there? He'd been in Draco's study several times over the last few days, and he didn't remember Snape being there. Harry squeezed his eyes shut, hoping the dour man would be gone when he opened them. No such luck.
He stood his ground, and he was proud of Harry for doing the same. They were excruciatingly close to finishing the ceremony, and both knew there was one final step that must be completed. Kingsley nearly forgot himself dumbfounded by watching what had to be one of the most powerful promissory bondings the wizarding world had ever seen. The spell was usually only partially visible, and he'd never heard of a witch or wizard's aura manifesting during the ceremony. His heart pounded as he watched the last of both Harry and Draco's auras recede, leaving only a shimmering silver glow covering the visible skin of their hands and faces. A silver bond was a thing to be coveted.
"I can't tell you anything, Nev," Pansy said, her eyes darkening as she watched him.
"What did you give Harry? He's dead to the world," he said, nodding to the unresponsive man on the sofa.
"Looks like I
He sat back down, logging into his regular email, dashing off a note to Theo to see if he and Ginny would like to join him for his standing dinner date with Cal tomorrow. He had some questions for them.
Draco groaned, closing his eyes so he didn't have to look at the suffocating man in front of him.
"I'm sorry that was necessary," Harry said, the smug tone of his voice assuring them he was not the least bit apologetic. "This is Draco Potter-Black, my husband, and Carina Potter-Black, our daughter. She is two."
Draco's brow furrowed in surprise. The
"We'll try a bottle now, and then let the rest of them sit in the wine cellar," he continued, his smirk returning when Harry's eyes lit with understanding.
"Every boy deserves a puppy," Harry had said with a simple shrug, placing the squirming ball of fur in Cal's arms.
"He's going to be embarrassed he told you that, Harry, when he finds out you
: IntrospectiveIntellectual
Draco smiled at his son's one-track mind. Not two minutes ago he had been begging to leave France, and now he was content to stay so long as he got to eat on a blanket.
Harry was amazed. After all this, Zach really thought he had a chance? They hadn't parted on good terms, though Harry had always managed to be civil to his old lover in public. Until now.
yes," Draco snarled, more than ready to give himself over to his own release.
It was unexpected that I'd fall in love with him, despite our past.
"There's nothing shameful about a Slytherin, brother dear," Ginny said smartly as she slid into the booth next to Harry, snagging a chip as she scooted past.
Hogwarts.
, he thought, giddily.
Draco hadn't moved from his seat in twenty minutes, completely frozen. He was torn between anger and elation. What was Potter
. He liked the sound of that.
“Theo? Are you alright?” Hannah asked, looking at him with concern.
"Sev, be nice," he chided, retrieving a blanket from a hidden drawer and tossing it to Harry.
Her eyes flashed, and he stepped back, an unconscious gesture of self-preservation.
Harry looked up sharply at the sound of a leather sole sliding over the rough stone floor, his heart stuttering when he realized it was Malfoy. Their eyes met for a brief second, and Harry was floored by the longing he saw in the grey depths. He opened his mouth to speak – though he had no idea what he intended to say – stopping when he saw Malfoy's expression change to one of absolute anguish. Malfoy shook his head once, the motion so minute Harry almost thought he'd imagined it. Without a word, the blond turned on his heel and walked through the doors, not glancing back as he disappeared into the crowd on the dance floor.
And suddenly he was coming in hot spurts, his arse clenching around the pleasurable intrusion of Draco's fingers …
, she thought, biting her lip, already braced for the worst with the notoriously hot-tempered blond, who likely wouldn't be as reasonable as the Gryffindor.
: A lot of reviewers have asked about Cal's identity. You'll find out more about him in the next chapter.
for fuck's sake.
Draco's face broke into a large smile as he thought of Caleum.
My time of toeing the line of what is expected is over.
"Well, it's a moot point," Ginny said, swiping the last of the butterscotch sauce off the plate with her finger. "He's managed to get your sister up the duff, which means he'll be the father of a Weasley child. There's no getting rid of him now."
They both flinched, suddenly very aware that they were sitting in a room with nearly two hundred other people, three of whom were looking at them with concern. Draco opened his eyes, careful to avoid Potter's face. He knew the man was breathing again, but only because he heard the first shaky breath the Gryffindor took.
"You look like you're in a better mood," Blaise said dryly, scowling when Draco merely grinned. He'd taken quite the tongue lashing the day before, and he was still a bit put out with the blond. "Care to share?"
He snorted, taking a sip of the wine he'd promised himself he wouldn't drink. It was just so bloody
"Well, I do like to experiment with wine," Harry said slowly, wrapping his mind around the fact that Draco's gift was tantamount to promising to marry him. He looked at Draco for a few moments, choosing his words carefully. "My cellar's full," he said, enjoying the way Draco's face fell at his statement, knowing his next few words would reassure the blond. "Maybe we could keep them here?"
Harry relaxed slightly, and Draco almost smiled.
The man blushed, and even his Quick-Quotes Quill trembled as it hovered next to him.
They were working on a difficult Transfiguration, coaxing a past life out of an object. The parchment, with the correct incantation and intent, would revert to its original state: a tree. Properly done, the Transfiguration would be permanent. It was their end-of-term project; Transfiguring the parchment into a sapling and then nurturing that tree so it would take root and grow. It was the only way to prove they had successfully Transfigured it into a living thing. If he didn’t manage it soon he was sure to fall the course, since McGonagall wanted the saplings to be at least two months old when she inspected them at the end of the term.
"Yes, the Divitiae Society. Mr. Malfoy was kind enough to extend a courtesy membership to me. I'm very much looking forward to it," Wedgewick said, smiling wolfishly at the thought of finally gaining entrance into the inner sanctum of the wizarding elite.
It had been a gift, true. But it had also been a test. If Draco wanted to be with Harry, he had to be prepared to find out some disturbing things about the wizarding world's vaunted Savior. He'd never told anyone – not even Ron and Hermione – all the details of what happened that night, but it wasn't something he planned to hold back from his future husband. If Draco couldn't handle this, Harry figured he might as well cut his losses now.
Blaise tipped an imaginary hat at Draco as the other man left the office, whistling softly to himself as he made his way toward the office's apparition point. Blaise shook his head fondly, watching him walk away. Draco was already on the road to smitten, that much was clear. He just hoped things worked out.
"I need some advice," he admitted, watching her carefully. "I met up with someone yesterday – someone from our past – and, I don't know, something happened."
"Good, good," Draco murmured absently, his attention drawn to his computer screen. He'd promised himself he wouldn't check his Magical Dating Online email before he'd cleared the inbox on his desk, but he was having trouble fighting the temptation.
“Again?”
"To skate?" Draco asked, his voice sounding rough and hoarse, as though he hadn't used it in months, not minutes.
"Can you
I am through with the expected.
"Er, no," he said, smiling sheepishly. "We found each other on Pansy's dating site. I haven't actually met him yet."
"Harry," he whined, his voice catching when Harry's finger brushed over his prostate.
He shifted closer to Draco, their hands still tightly joined. "It is what it is, Kings," Harry said with a nervous laugh. He just wanted this to be over with. "Let's just do it, shall we?"
"There should be something from the Diagon Alley Zoning Board in that mess," Blaise said, waving negligently toward the pile. "I took your meeting with the Director of Planning. He wasn't pleased to be dealing with me instead of you, but I told him you'd definitely be at the board meeting Monday night."
Harry watched her go, feeling sympathy for the greeting he knew Ron was going to get, and without the benefit of the Hangover Potion Harry'd had. He let himself relax into the chair, breathing a sigh of relief. His fears had been ridiculous. He
They both stopped when they heard the Floo roar to life, pausing mid-struggle to watch as Hermione and Ron climbed out of the fireplace. They looked tired and harried, the stress of the last few hours showing on Hermione's sun-browned face. Ron sported a light sunburn – he could never be trusted to renew the charm that blocked the sun at regular intervals – and a healthy amount of red stubble on his jaw.
"He had me wrapped around his finger from birth," Draco admitted, grinning fondly. "I swore to do whatever was necessary to protect him. That included forcing everyone who knew about him to swear an Unbreakable Vow not to speak of him to anyone who didn't know," Draco said, breaking his gaze away from Harry to smile apologetically at Neville.
Draco busied himself pouring the drinks, the easy camaraderie he'd felt all day morphing into something different – something tight and hot in his belly, a sudden nervousness that had him struggling for composure. It was ridiculous, of course. This was Harry. There was no reason to be nervous. Then again, this was
"I heard you whispering with Dumbledore," Ron murmured in his ear, smirking when the boy blushed. "Always meddling, that old man is."
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's cheek, inhaling the spicy scent he loved so much.
"All in due time," he answered, shocked by the way his voice shook as he spoke.
In the convening years, I have also done what is expected of me. I went into a career with the Auror Corps, despite my distaste for violence. I settled into a relationship with a man the wizarding world thought was appropriate for me, despite my reservations about him. I turned a blind eye toward the gossip and slander that continually circulates through the wizarding populace about me, ignoring the countless libelous articles and books that have been printed about me. Worst of all, I let my notions of who I was expected to be get in the way of a blossoming relationship with the man who could quite possibly be my soul mate, all because I, too, fell into the expected and refused to see him for what he really was.
"Carina Luna Potter-Black," Draco said, his voice clear in the silent room. "Heir to the Potter family name. I think it suits her."
"I'm in love with him," Harry said, his goofy grin back in full force.
"Going for a swim?" She asked, resting her hands on her hips and canting them forward, making sure he couldn't miss the tiny scrap of cloth held together by a few thin ribbons that dipped almost indecently low.
Draco snorted, reaching for his cup of tea. "No need to thank me," he said bitterly. He'd nearly hexed her for touching Harry's arm during their now-daily test of the bond yesterday. "I'm just glad I didn't hurt her."
"You can't tell me anything, but you can listen to what I'm going to tell
Draco rolled his eyes, but his mind wandered to Gryffin, another person he'd promised to take on a picnic. He hadn't heard from the man yet this morning, but he was confident he'd be forgiven. His buckwheat blinis were irresistible.
The meeting took much longer than Hermione's promised few minutes, but Harry didn't mind. It was important, and therefore worth his time. He couldn't wait until the finished product hit the stores in a week. James Evans' latest triumph, and the ace up Harry's courtship sleeve.
"A few weeks," he said lamely, shrugging. Sly couldn't meet before then, and Harry was busy with things for the wedding and the book, as well. There would be no point in trying to move up their meeting.
He jumped on the sleeping man's stomach, giggling madly when the movement caused Blaise to curse loudly and grab his wand, instantly on the alert for an attack.
Which wouldn't happen, because Oliver was in no way interested in Potter, Draco assured himself. His fists clenched harder as he quickened his pacing, glancing up at the large antique clock over the mantle. They were late.
He knew Neville well enough to read the other man's discomfort, correctly assuming what it meant.
"The dating site just added a chat function," he said, startled when he saw remorse and sadness in the grey eyes in the mirror. He'd been using the glamour for years, but he'd never seen that expression on the now uncomfortably familiar features. "I told him who I was – that I was James Evans, at any rate."
"Drink?" Draco asked, pushing the door to his study open. It seemed like the safest place to entertain Harry – no bed, and a sofa too small to encourage any horizontal activities.
“Right then,” she muttered to herself, smoothing her hands over her short leather skirt. Her hands followed the curve of her arse, admiring the tight leather that stopped almost indecently high. She threw her robes over her nearly sheer blouse, covering up the fact that she had forgone a bra.
Freddie required.
"Yes, Chessie. Master Cal. My son. Your charge."
"Obviously, I can't tell you who sent the gift, but he said you were expecting it," she continued, searching Harry's face for confirmation.
Ron grinned, shrugging as he reached for another piece of Harry's homemade bread. "That's different," he said easily, winking at Harry. "He's family. It's my
Draco sputtered, turning in a tight circle to take everything in. Several large evergreens had been brought in, all decorated to the hilt with Christmas bows, lights and ornaments. A large stack of brightly wrapped presents sat underneath one, obviously spelled to resist the wet snow.
"Of course," Theo said, Ginny disappearing. Draco could hear the thin wail of a newborn, and figured it must be time for Freddie to eat. "It's nothing serious. Just a precaution, really."
were you drinking?" she asked, opening her eyes when he'd pulled his robes on. She handed him the socks, watching as he finished dressing and cast the glamour on his face and hair.
Blaise rapped on the open door sharply, ostensibly announcing their presence. Draco knew it was a show for the woman he was leading in – Blaise was well aware of the Amplifying charms Madge had placed on the corridor so no one could sneak up on her boss.
questions, and this will be your only chance."
"No," Harry whispered, the barely audible word full of misery and despair.
Harry grinned, remembering Sly's words as he sipped a glass of Ogden's Finest in front of the fire. He'd been going back and forth with the man for more than a week now, their emails escalating to several a day. He'd developed an addiction to checking his email, unable to stop the zing of excitement that shot through him every time something new came in from Sly.
parents got to see the Sorting. He sighed, well aware of why they were coming. He could only imagine the shocked whispers and rumors that would start when his name was called out. His fathers had managed to keep news of their marriage and his adoption quiet, but he'd decided he wanted to go to Hogwarts without a cloak of secrecy surrounding who his family was. He was proud of both of his fathers, and he wanted the world to know who they were.
, he thought as he rolled his eyes.
"You're frogs," Harry repeated flatly, his headache blooming even more.
Harry just smiled, shaking his head. "Nope."
"Harry? Draco? I have some books I think you two should take a look at," she called from the other room. She knew enough to stay there until they came to her – the last person who had surprised the couple, Ron, had been Stunned.
," he muttered. "It was nothing. A minor disagreement. Now that the boys know my opinion on their little farce, I'm sure they'll talk to Draco about it before they do anything irreversible."
Draco looked at the bag, then back to Harry's wild hair and slightly flushed face.
too," Draco whispered, his voice stronger. "You're a good man, Ron."
Draco swallowed as the message flew into the ether; the ball was in mystery man's court now.
combine these –"
Draco and Blaise drew back out of the fire, brushing the ashes off their robes as they stood.
"The Minister is in the drawing room. Are you ready?"
"I have to ask," he said, laughing when George grimaced. "Who had the other one?"
"If this isn't what you want –"
"They're waiting just inside the doors," he said, avoiding Draco's gaze.
"Potter," he snarled, his eyes glinting dangerously.
, Neville thought, pouring himself another shot of Ogden's.
He measured out the coffee, finding comfort in the ritual. Harry leaned against the counter, toying with a magnet shaped like a Snitch he had taken off the refrigerator, while he waited for his coffee to brew. The thought of Sly having a beloved childhood pet made him even more attractive, though Harry couldn't work out why. He guessed it was because it made him sound so normal – Harry's first pet had been Hedwig, and Merlin knew there had been no normalcy in
"Tell them I took this to the Ministry to file," he said, pointing the scroll over his shoulder at the entwined couple. "I'm classifying it with top-level clearance, so it will disappear after its legitimacy has been registered."
Draco squeezed Harry's hand reassuringly as his soon-to-be-husband stuttered over the last word. He knew the bulk of Harry's anxiety was over him, since this meant he couldn't have his mother or Cal at their wedding.
Harry dropped Draco's hand, kneeling beside Cal. Kingsley moved his wand, pressing it against Harry's chest. "
"Is it?" Ginny asked, crossing her arms.
Harry groaned, using the flat of his tongue to sweep over one of Draco's small nipples. "Can't wait," he whispered, the rush of air against his wet nipple making Draco shiver.
"Oh, I'm quite familiar with what you find
He tapped his shoe against the floor, the steady tattoo of noise increasing in tempo as his irritation grew. He looked at his watch again. Fourteen minutes late. Draco thought about pouring himself a drink, but decided against it. Whatever Harry was planning would surely test their willpower, and he needed a clear head for that.
"I wanted to have you at a table with us, but it was all couples, and –"
"I hope he remembers that in the morning," Charlie said wistfully, watching Ron take a bite out of a lime wedged between the Irishman's lips.
She brought her attention back to Hermione, smoothing some nonexistent wrinkles out of the simple silk sheath she wore. Everything about the wedding – from the elegant bridesmaid dress to the sensible favors – just screamed Hermione. Ginny smiled, tucking one of Hermione's errant curls back into its pin. Hermione's light cream-colored dress fell in graceful waves around her, its scooped neckline accentuating her slender shoulders and graceful neck. Her hair was piled up on top of her head, secured by about a hundred pins and Great Aunt Muriel's goblin-made tiara, the same one Fleur wore when she married Bill.
"No, you stay," Draco said, leaning in so he could read Theo's expression in the Floo. The Healer was concerned about something called jaundice, and Ginny was frantic. "I can take care of the meeting by myself. You should have Freddie checked out."

Ron was surprised when Harry joined them on the dance floor as the song ended, stealing Hermione away for the next dance with a huge smile on his face. Ginny appeared at his elbow, and he held her stiffly, his dancing even clumsier than it had been with his bride.
As the silver tattoo on Harry's ring finger faded from blinding to merely conspicuous, Kingsley clapped both men on the shoulder and forcibly turned them toward the room.
"Er, sorry?" he offered lamely, flinching when he heard a loud crash from upstairs. Apparently Ron was awake.
"Durward took Luella's imprisonment as a mortal insult and he appealed to the council with every bit of Ravenclaw wisdom and logic he could muster. It took him five years, but he finally won the right to court her.
Harry's mouth hung open at Ron's words, but he quickly shut it, forcing himself to smile smugly.
Ron opened his mouth to speak, but Hermione shushed him with a stern look. She settled back into the chair nearest the computer and looked expectantly over at Harry, her fingers poised over the keyboard.
He could feel the tension radiating off both men, and it had a distinctly sexual feel to it. Plenty of anxiety as well, he could tell, but he had a hunch it was going to be a challenge to keep the two of them apart much longer. He knew Harry's plans though, and he figured the Pensieve memories would help dampen their arousal.
Harry smiled grimly, shrugging. "It was the only path he saw," he said softly, gripping Draco's hand when the scene swirled around them again. Neither took any notice of the new memory, their attention focused on each other.
"Yes," she said curtly, fixing him with a glare. She wanted this wedding to be everything Harry envisioned, and she'd been working tirelessly with Draco to make sure his stubborn husband had everything he wanted.
He relished the stunned looks on everyone's faces, already predicting what tomorrow's headlines would bring. "Boy-Who-Lived to spend eternity with Death Eater," was his best guess.
"You don't' know anything!"
Draco watched as Potter danced with every female under the age of 80 in attendance, engaging in polite conversation and moving around the floor with surprising elegance and skill. A far cry from the klutz he'd been at the Yule Ball all those years ago.
Biting his lip, Harry made his way toward his bedroom. He'd promised to be ready and waiting by 8 p.m., and he thought it best to be naked, allowing unhindered access to his cock. His erection ached, pressing uncomfortably against the stiff fabric that had been its prison all day. He actually moaned as he unzipped the denims, his cock springing free, a shudder of desire and pleasure ripping through him as the cool air hit the fevered skin.
"Yes," Ron whined, dropping his head into his hands.
with no sarcastic undertone.
"Thanks for this," Harry said, waving the bag in the air as he strode out of the back room, headed for the shop's front door.
"Gryffin?" he asked, standing and holding a hand out to Harry.
he assured himself, his brow furrowed as he tried to remember why if he'd actually modeled the glamour after Malfoy, or if it had just been a fluke.
"James Evans, yes," Neville said, realizing Pansy's problem. "It got even worse. When he'd finally reconciled the fact that he'd been writing to his favorite author, he said 'at least it isn't Harry Potter', or some rot like that."
"Aunt Hermione said to tell you they'll all be waiting for you back at Grimmauld Place," Teddy said, shifting nervously from one foot to the other. He agreed with their plan, but he worried what affect it would have on Caleum. He'd be the one to bear the brunt of it, Teddy knew.
Harry almost groaned, the only thing preventing the sound from escaping his lips being the total lack of oxygen in his lungs. He'd forgotten to breathe again.
Draco frowned, turning the lightweight box over in his hands. He felt a pang of excitement as he studied the dimensions of the box – the very familiar dimensions. He'd had two strikingly similar boxes in his lifetime.
"It felt like a shock for me," Daphne offered. "My mum warned me, so I was ready for it. No one told Nev, though, and he actually yelped when it happened."
Skeeter looked as though she was about to follow up with another question, but Hermione's quick Silencing Spell stopped her.
"A junior potions set," Harry said with a shrug. He'd had George pick one out and Neville had delivered it. "You mentioned he took after you in potions, so I thought he'd like his own mini lab."
Harry felt like he was enveloped in a warm cocoon of dancing color. The runes were hot against his skin, pulsing as though they had a life of their own. It seemed like an eternity passed as he and Draco stared at each other, their skin reflecting flickering colors from their joining auras. They'd discussed this over the last week, so sure in their love and devotion to each other that nothing less than an eternity bond would do. It would be impossible for them to divorce, and they'd be bound together even in the afterlife.
Harry bloody Potter, after all.
"We thought we'd let Cal make the final decision," Harry said, his voice hoarse with emotion. "He's been there for all of our discussions about what to call her."
"His bedroom's up here. Can one of you cast a Lightening charm? I'm just going to carry him," he said, sighing in relief when Draco's spell made it possible to easily heft the sleeping man.
"Ollie sent me everything from Quidditch tickets to his grandmother's heirloom necklace," she added, giggling when he kissed her again.
Neville watched Draco, studying the expression of remorse on the blond's face.
"But sparks? Real sparks?" Hermione shook her head, unwilling to believe what she'd seen.
Luna. She rarely did things like that, without good reason, and he figured she must have foreseen that this was a good time to share their news. He shrugged at Harry. Why not? What did they have to lose, after all?
"This and that, Malfoy. You know how it is, life among the wizarding elite," he answered, his tone more bitter than he'd intended.
"It's no trouble," Draco reassured him, signaling Madge to bring a tray of tea in. They may as well get comfortable, since the Aurors still had piles and piles of files to get through. Accommodating though he may be, Draco had no intention of allowing them to leave the building with files that were not expressly included in the Ministry search warrant. That meant wading through thousands of pieces of parchment. "No trouble at all."
,” he rasped, his eyes on Hermione instead of the blank parchment in front of him.
Another twenty seconds ticked by, the compulsion in his brain buzzing frantically.
"And then
he thought wanly, waves of humiliation and misery crashing over him.
"Harry," she said sharply, squeezing his knee. "He will answer when he can. He warned you he would be out of contact for several days. Just relax."
"I –" Harry tried to form the words
Draco's lips parted in surprise as he studied the innocent-looking objects. He swallowed hard.
"You were the one who wanted this much control," she whispered, her lips grazing his ear as he bent to accommodate her. "You were the one who fought to be so involved in the editing process. They don't do this for most writers, you know. You could at least pretend to be interested."
They'd found a few ways to lessen the bond's response to other people, though nothing failsafe enough to risk going to see Narcissa or Cal. Harry knew how frustrating it was for Draco not to be able to see his son, and they'd been working hard on their meditation and relaxation techniques. Hermione had been researching the bond and how to minimize its effects.
"Fuck off, Zach," Ron hissed, making sure his colleague could see the tip of his wand, which was trained on him under the cover of the tablecloth. Hexing a fellow Auror would cause a headache at the Ministry, but it would be worth it. "Get out of here."
I wanted to dash off a quick thank you for everyone who is reading, and especially those who are reviewing. The response to Must Love Quidditch has knocked my socks off! *blows kisses*
Draco's brow furrowed for a moment as he leafed through a large stack of parchment, messages Madge had given him the moment he entered the office. He'd missed several fairly important meetings yesterday afternoon, but he hadn't been in any frame of mind to stay.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They aren't mine.
Harry's expression sobered suddenly, and he studied Draco carefully. "Have you watched the memories, yet?"
Neville pulled a similar disc out of his own shirt, shrugging uncomfortably as he murmured the words and disappeared.
"Yes," Harry said, wrinkling his nose in mock distaste. "Theo's set up some sort of bar crawl that ends at the strip club in Knockturn Alley."
Draco gave money to all the right charities, attended all the right functions and supported the Ministry in all the right ways. But at the heart of it, he was still the son of one of the most notorious and blood thirsty of all the Death Eaters, suspected of Dark activity himself. He'd been cleared of all charges after Harry Potter, of all people, had testified at his Wizengamot hearing after the war, but Draco was still something of a social pariah, admired for his looks and money but still not completely accepted. His father had died in Azkaban years earlier, and Narcissa was living in France taking care of Caleum at the Malfoy chateau in Amboise. He was the only Malfoy left in England, which meant he was the only target for peoples' disdain for his family.

"Mr. Malfoy, you have a meeting at Gringott's in half an hour. You'll need to leave now in order to make it. The Goblins have instituted some new security measures and it is taking a little longer than usual to get into the bank," she said.
: MustLoveQuidditch
Harry's eyebrows rose at the complicated magic. It was perfect: rare, prestigious, ancient – a very worthy gift. He nodded to Neville, who grabbed Hermione's arm, pulling her toward the door. If Harry was set on buying it – and Neville agreed, it was perfect for Draco – there was no sense in letting Hermione nag.
Hermione nodded, cringing inwardly at the influx of Fire-calls and owls she knew her office would be getting over the next few weeks.
," Harry repeated dully, feeling another wave of anger sweep through him. "Who else?"
"I know, and I'm sorry, Hermione. You must think me daft, to keep going round and round about this. But I really think there could be something here, and I don't want to muck it up. I hardly have a great track record, you know," he said, fidgeting with a paperweight as he perched next to Hermione on the desk.
"Everything is fine," Neville assured him, chuckling at Draco's flustered reaction. It was great to see the blond's usually unflappable control disrupted – well worth the effort it had taken to cast Shielding Spells around the trees and plants. "Same spell we use on the vines when there's an unexpected frost."
She closed her eyes as he dressed, and they chatted about the book and the changes Abigail had proposed. She questioned him about the scattered manuscript, relieved to hear he'd tripped and knocked it off the desk, not thrown it in anger as she had assumed. It was believable – Harry was a very clumsy drunk.
"We're here, and it's where we want to be. We couldn't have stayed there knowing what that idiot Smith was playing at. Did that b-" Ron broke off when Hermione cleared her throat meaningfully, inclining her head toward Teddy, who was listening avidly. "
"Thanks, Hermione," he said absently, taking a sip as he stood slowly, wincing when the blood rushed back into his cramped legs.
"That was –" Neville shook his head, still shocked by what he'd seen. "That was amazing. I'm privileged to have witnessed it. It's not often you see such a strong reaction to the courtship bond."
: MustLoveQuidditch
"He's –"
"Uncle Blaise! Dad said we can have a picnic! Can we eat on a blanket and everything?"
. He wanted to make sure he knew everything possible about the blond. What he learned left him with more questions than answers, though, especially about his failed marriage and subsequent two-year disappearance.
Draco fought his way out of sleep, aware of a hot, heavy weight pinning him to the bed. It was like being under a sweltering blanket, and he absently wondered if the room's Cooling Charm had failed sometime in the night.
They'd been staying with Harry for the last week, helping him keep within the courtship rules. She didn't know what had gone on a few nights ago, but Harry had stumbled out of the Floo flushed and in better spirits than he'd been in for weeks. The marriage contract he kept on the desk hadn't combusted, however, so she knew whatever they'd gotten up to had been within the letter, if not the intent, of the courtship laws.
So Happy Christmas, and thanks for your patience!
She slipped out of the rest of her robes, tossing them carelessly over the back of her chair. She knew the prim way she’d crossed her legs made the tight leather mini-skirt even more revealing, and she leaned forward, making sure her breasts brushed against Theo’s arm.
"Uncle Sev, that's not true!"
"Harry, Weasley," Blaise said, pulling a similar medallion from around his own neck and tossing it to Harry. "Use it only when it is safe for us to return."
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. The characters belong to JKR, not me.
Harry took another swallow of wine to curb his sharp retort. He knew Ron and Hermione were only looking out for him, but he didn't want or need their advice on this. It felt right; he couldn't describe it, and he didn't want to sully it by trying.
Hermione frowned, looking down at the hand that rested in Ron's.
Draco decided not to be coy, wrapping his hand around his own cock and giving it one firm stroke. He heard Harry curse softly, and soon Draco's cock was enveloped in tight warmth as well. Draco closed his eyes, unable to concentrate on the amazing feeling of Harry's rough palm on his cock and watch Harry at the same time. It was too – strange. It had been odd enough when they'd done this with the cock rings, but now, knowing it was Harry's hand on his cock,
"He'll listen," he said, gritting his teeth.
"Who's today's test subject?" Draco asked, looking up over the copy of the
"I doubt Smith would appreciate hearing that," Draco said, his tone still cordial. He felt Blaise stiffen behind him, but ignored it. Draco looked over Harry's shoulder, watching the Auror's approach dispassionately. "I wouldn't want to cause any more trouble between the two of you."
Draco shuddered, and Harry wondered if it was possible to vomit in a Pensieve memory. He thought he was likely to find out soon.
"Are you this much of a tyrant with your other clients?" he asked petulantly, grabbing the stack of paper from her hands and slamming it down on the desk.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Much as I love them, they aren't mine.
"You've only done half a dozen," she snapped, knowing she was being unreasonable but unable to stop herself.
Draco blew out an unsteady breath, which turned into a laugh as he shook his head.
"Wanker," Harry whispered, his battle with his shoes prolonged because he refused to break eye contact with Draco.
he thought, his head hitting the back of the chair as the strokes became faster, more sure. He closed his eyes, remembering the words Gryffin had used in his letter about the cock rings being twins.
Draco nodded, the tight fist of terror around his heart still constricting painfully. If Harry said Cal was with Neville and Blaise at the safe house everything was probably fine, and he was right – there was no way he'd be able to ditch his Auror guards in the condition he was in.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. If you haven't figured out yet that I'm not JKR, well, you haven't been reading closely enough! Thanks again to Kamerreon for her fabulous beta skills!
"You're right, of course," Wedgewick said, still oblivious to the sexual tension that had sprung up between the two men. "We need to continue on with the petitions. But it was lovely to have met you, Mr. Potter, and to have seen you again, Mr. Malfoy. I do hope
“I hardly bloody well open my mouth at all, could I?” he answered, a laugh escaping as he watched her ransack both their bags for something to wear. “More likely to moan than anything if I had.”
"Mr. Potter, you may now complete your vow of intent."
Harry found Draco stooped inside his old cupboard under the stairs, looking around in confusion.
: IntrospectiveIntellectual
"Who is it? Maybe Theo can tell you more about him. He is our age, right?"
, what do you mean? Take care of me? A father's job is to take care of his son, not the other way around," Draco said, fighting to keep his voice calm.
Kingsley placed a hand on both men, careful to gauge their reactions. This far into the marriage ceremony, it shouldn't cause a problem, but few things ever went according to plan when Harry was involved. He nearly sighed in relief when both Harry and Draco nodded slightly, looking up to meet his eye.
"Mr. Potter, I have a delivery from another one of my clients. We'd usually send something like this via owl, but the basket is rather heavy," she said, shifting her grip on the handle. Harry reached out without thinking, taking the basket from her to ease her burden. She sighed in relief.
know, right?" Ron asked, cornering Neville as soon as they were out of earshot. The rehearsal dinner was in full swing inside, with everyone enjoying cocktails before Molly's home-cooked meal.
"You owe me," Blaise mouthed silently before he left, making mock gagging motions as he rolled his eyes as the homely witch seated across from Draco's desk.
"I will," he promised, returning the kiss before she stepped into the fireplace and Flooed away.
Ron nodded and Hermione stood to pull Harry into a light embrace. He bent to rest his head on her shoulder and she pressed a kiss into his rumpled hair.
"Sir, are you really married to Mr. M-malfoy?"
Harry grinned when he saw Malfoy's composure falter. His heart skipped a beat when he saw Malfoy's pale skin heat with a blush, and his mind was unwillingly drawn to the thought that this must be what the blond looked like when he was aroused – the peachy-hued skin, the parted lips, the fast rise and fall of his chest.
"Let's get this over with," Harry sighed, following Hermione's lead toward the studio.
Harry thought, his grin turning wolfish as he noted Draco's erection.
"An official investigation," Draco offered with a wry smile, nodding his head toward the corridor, where three similarly attired wizards were sorting through boxes of files.
"Excuse me," Draco said shortly, striding off toward the exit. He knew Pansy would follow him, which was fortunate, because this wasn't a conversation he wanted to have in the middle of a wedding reception.
Draco popped another DVD into the player yet again glad he'd purchased the Muggle device a few years ago. Like all electronics, it had taken some complicated warding to protect it from the ambient magic in the room, but it was all worth it now.
"I am agog at your hilarity, Blaise," he said dryly.
"Why would you need to do that? You've never seemed too worried about it before," the man sneered.
"And I do apologize," Blaise said, the underlying annoyance in his smooth voice audible only to those, like Draco, who knew him well. "But he does have a few moments now, if you'd like to see him. I'm sure Mr. Malfoy wouldn't mind. He has another appointment shortly, but he'd never willingly turn away such a valuable client as you, Madam Atalier."
"Hermione?"
"Don't say it like that," Harry chastised. "You know it's hard for me to meet people like a normal bloke would. The last time I went to singles night at the local pub I was mobbed by slavering women."
Blaise smiled, unable to stay angry with Draco for long. The blond knew it, too, and often used it mercilessly to his own advantage.
Grey eyes sought him out across the crowded club, and Harry's pulse jumped when they made eye contact.
"Is he ever," Draco growled, sending a pointed look toward his son, who was glaring at him from across the room.
He felt Cal shrug against him. "
And Potter. Draco bit his tongue, trying to steer his thoughts away from the gorgeous dark-haired wizard standing next to the groom. He looked almost as happy as Weasley, his lips curved in a breathtaking smile, his eyes locked on his friend as she made her way toward them on her father's arm.
Draco's gaze never left Harry's face as he raised his own wand.
Twenty minutes later, Harry was climbing back into his freshly made bed after a lukewarm shower. Two wet dreams in one night – he'd never even suffered this badly when he was in school! He wondered if Draco was having a similar problem, smacking his head sharply against the headboard when the mere thought of the blond had his cock twitching again. It was going to be a very long week.
"You gave them frog legs on purpose?" Harry asked, forcing himself to keep the hysteria out of his voice.
Author’s note: We made it through all the resolutions, folks! How did my 5K word one-shot turn into this 13-chapter fic? *grins* It was thanks to you, dear readers. Enough of you asked for more, and I couldn’t ignore the puppy dog eyes and offers of cookies.
I didn't realize FanFiction was editing out the fake email addresses in the story ... oops! I've reformatted the email addresses, replacing the at symbol (damn, I've just discovered it won't even let me use the symbol in regular text!) with [at] and adding extra spaces so the server doesn't remove them, because it's kind of integral to the story to be able to identify the writer, yeah? *rolls eyes* The addresses in Chapter 1 have been fixed as well. Bet y'all thought I'd just gotten lazy and decided to omit them! Apologies!

"Someday you're going to have to tell me how
their joined magic pulsing around them.
Hermione's expression softened slightly. "I'll pick out some clothes for you. We're leaving in 15 minutes, so you'd best hurry."
“Hermione?” Theo whispered, raising a hand to run down over her collarbone. He slipped his hand into her robes, gasping again when his fingers ran over her hardened nipple, making it clear the sheer blouse wasn’t her only surprise. They’d been sleeping with each other on and off for months, but he’d never known Hermione to be so wanton – no bra in a public place? It was enough to make his cock jump to attention, wondering what other surprises she had in store.
"It was just a random thought," he said, his confidence returning. "But he
"You're on thin ice, kid," he growled, pinning Cal's arms behind his back and rolling him so he was pressed against the back of the sofa.
Magic swirled around them, less impressive than the scene that had unfolded at their bondings but just as final. Draco felt his chest warm where Kingsley's wand had pressed, disappearing as quickly as it had started.
Draco made a mental note to ask Harry who had coached him on the old laws and traditions, because it was obvious the Gryffindor had gotten his information from someone other than his friends. Even Neville, who had the same pure-blood upbringing that Draco did, had been unclear on some of the ancient courtship rules Harry had invoked.
She eyed him appraisingly, amused that Draco seemed tongue-tied about something. They'd talked about the club over dinner, so it likely wasn't that. Besides, that was Theo's area, not hers.
Blaise snorted when Draco's attention became fully engrossed in the screen, correctly assuming the mysterious Gryffin had emailed.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Not mine!
Neville took another sip of tea, sitting back in his chair. He knew more about the planned date than Draco did, but refrained from mentioning it. Gryffin and Sly had agreed to meet up for a movie, and if things went well, Draco had been planning to take Gryffin to dinner at an exclusive restaurant in Muggle London that was actually owned by wizards. What Draco didn't know was that Harry had made similar plans, intending to whisk Sly away to the very same restaurant. Neville had found the fact that they'd both made reservations at the notoriously difficult to book restaurant amusing at the time, but now it pained him. Another example of how bloody compatible they were, and it was never going to come to light unless Harry and Draco dropped this disinterested act.
“H-haven’t been h-having much luck with the s-spell,” he stuttered, his entire body tense from pleasure and fear of discovery.
"It is my wish," he whispered, his throat aching with unshed tears. His family.
Kingsley nodded, wondering what was going on. Knowing Harry, the man was doing his best to convince Draco
!" Harry blocked the spell, his face darkening in fury.
Ron nodded, still confused but willing to go along with whatever Blaise and Harry wanted to do. They knew Malfoy better than he did, after all, and if they agreed it was likely the right thing.
He swallowed hard, tamping down thoughts of his wank sessions with Sly. No, not Sly.
"Don't be stupid," Ron answered, digging around in the familiar diaper bag to hand Harry the charmed bottles Ginny always prepared whenever she left the girl. He'd been around Freddie enough to know the signs of a hungry baby, no matter how oblivious everyone assumed he was.
Harry's eyes flashed angrily, but he schooled his features into his normal mask of calm control. He shrugged easily, letting a slow smile steal across his face. It wasn't hard – he just focused on his feelings for Sly. Well, before Sly was
Draco blushed slightly, meeting Kingsley's eye. "Kingsley, then," he said, his eyes widening in surprise when the man tugged on his hand and pulled him into a loose hug.
Draco closed his eyes, willing the tears away. He was no longer the Head of the Malfoy family, having renounced the name and put the title – along with the deed to Malfoy Manor and a significant amount of money that was set aside for only the heir to the family – safely in a vault for Cal, should the boy choose to take it up when he came of age. He was officially the Head of the House of Black now, Harry's wedding gift to him. He stalwartly summoned his Malfoy mask, even though he had no claim to that family any longer. He still had his pride, and he'd be damned if he was going to show this much emotion in front of dozens of people, even if they were their friends and family.
"Harry said you'd be stubborn," Seamus said with a sigh, putting the potions on the bedside table and sitting on the bed. He dug through his pockets, retrieving a small notebook. "I wrote it down, so I'd be sure to get it right. He said: Tell Draco to take the damn potions and get some rest. Everything is taken care of, and Ron and I are house-sitting for him in case any unexpected visitors come by."
"Oh," Draco said, the sound barely a whisper. He looked back up at Harry, his grey eyes wide.
Lavender huffed out a sigh. “Of course, Hermione. Is there anyone
"Finally," he muttered, his stomach plummeting in anticipation of what he might find in that day's issue.
Harry groaned, stripping the bed himself instead of calling for Kreacher. The elf would have happily done the chore for him, but he didn't mind doing it. It gave him some time to avoid thinking about why the bed needed to be stripped for the third time this week, especially since it was only Tuesday. He had another whole week of this before he could even
, Draco thought a thrill running through him.
printed – part two of the story, which included photos from Smith's two-year relationship with Potter. Smith claimed they were on the verge of reuniting when Oliver caught Harry's eye.
"You're not going anywhere, Malfoy," he said, his tone suddenly professional as he checked Draco's pulse. "Your breathing's still a little erratic, but your heart rate has stabilized."
that?" Neville asked, squinting at the PEZ dispenser.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They belong to JKR, even though she insists they're straight.
"I was wondering if you and Ron would mind bringing it here instead," Harry asked sheepishly. "I've just had a brilliant response to my ad, and I want you to help me respond."
"Harry Potter, representing Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes," the dark-haired man said from the back of the room.
"He says he wants a family," Draco said, his tone wistful, but slightly sad. "He seems different from the others, but I still wouldn't tell him about Cal until after we'd met."
They both looked up at the sound of feet slapping against the wood floor, loud in the otherwise silent corridor. Ron turned the corner, red-faced and panting.
, Harry thought through the fog.
She shook her head dumbly, still unable to process what she was hearing. Any other time, she'd consider helping, but she knew Harry was seeing someone. Sort of.
Damn it, Draco thought, reading the email through a second time, I wonder if I've completely blown it. He hesitated, unsure of what to do. Should he email Gryffin with his apologies, telling him about the unforeseen personal crisis that kept him away? No, Draco decided. He couldn't tell Gryffin about Caleum; he had no idea how the other man would react, and he didn't know him well enough to risk it. Caleum was an absolute in Draco's life; nothing would ever come between them. To accept Draco would be to accept Caleum. He was the reason Draco had ended all of his previous relationships; he'd never gotten close enough to any of them to tell them about Caleum. He'd come close, once, but Blaise had intervened and advised him not to. He had been right. It turned out the man had a sister who worked for the
"Draco!" He hissed, wary of being overheard. Narcissa's and Cal's bedrooms weren't very far from theirs, and most of the guest rooms were full, too. Most of their friends had chosen to come a day early to help with wedding preparations. "You can't just leave!"
The door swung open, and Ron was standing there, a protective order from the Wizengamot in his hand. He blanched at the sight of Draco's bloody mouth, the blond obviously in deep distress. Before Draco succumbed to the blackness that threatened, his mouth opened again, his words slurred by his swollen tongue.
Harry had originally balked at the idea of a game based around him, but he'd agreed when the manufacturer pledged to donate a quarter of the proceeds to a home for children orphaned in the war. Harry Potter Clue had been the first game, but now nearly a dozen different Harry Potter-themed games graced the shelves of most wizarding toy stores.
"Today's gift?" he asked, testing its weight with his arms.
Ron grimaced, wincing gingerly after jumping down off the tabletop. He couldn’t remember exactly what he’d been doing up there, but between Draco’s smirk, Lavender’s glare and Harry’s blush, he was pretty sure it was bad.
Draco pushed back from his desk, frustrated. They'd been working out the details of a major land sale in Wales for weeks, and the seller had just dropped out. Added to the pounding headache he had this morning – which he hadn't taken a Hangover potion for, letting himself suffer as a reminder not to overdo it again with whisky – the morning had been a complete and utter disaster.
"Oh, for Merlin's sake, Potter," Draco sighed, pushing the box closer when he realized where Harry's gaze was directed. He collapsed back into his chair, crossing his legs to hide his erection even though the movement squeezed his cock uncomfortably. "Just open it."
"I knew you'd be here," he muttered, wrapping his arm around Draco's waist as they made their way through the barrier into King's Cross Station.
He slid a finger over the heavy wax seal, smiling at its conspicuous blankness. It must mean that Gryffin was a member of one of the old families – sealing correspondence with wax was something only Lords and Ladies did these days, though they usually used their family crest. He shrugged, running the pad of his finger over the smooth surface of the satiny wax. Gryffin had mentioned he was a Muggle-raised half-blood, but he was obviously familiar with the customs of pureblood society.
" – so you see, it's not alarming, so much as it was just surprising," Daphne said, waving her arms vaguely as she spoke.
"Tell him Blaise and Neville said: 'Weasley is our king,' and they'll be gone until we get everything sorted. If he leaves now, he'll just have Aurors following him here. That's all he said."
Oliver wrapped an arm around his wife's shoulders, dipping his head to press a kiss against her neck.
Harry quirked an eyebrow at Draco in silent question, cocking his head toward the frozen pond. When they were all safely on the ice, he leaned in, his lips almost touching Draco's ear.
"Don't," Neville said, the warning clear in his voice. "Harry, stop beating yourself up. You were right. Draco needed to know those things about you. He needed to see you do have a darker side, since he's going to be the one to help you when you need someone to lean on when you get overwhelmed."
"Oh, good. Blaise said you were there, but I didn't believe him. Is Cal alright?" she asked, puzzled as to why Draco would be in France on a weekday.
"No, really. Just think about it, Pans. If they could just get past their rivalry – and if Draco and
"I hope he is," Caleum whispered, snuggling closer to Blaise, leaving the man wide-awake with surprise while he fell into a fitful sleep.
"Harry James Potter, I seek to be of one mind, one spirit and one life with you for all eternity."
"I think so," Draco whispered, straightening when Harry dropped his arms. "Just don't get between us. Let me stand between you and Hermione."
Draco grinned, holding a hand out to help Blaise up from the sofav . He'd make sure the man got to bed, even if he had to place him there himself.
"It's not like that, Potter," he said, his voice pitched low so it didn't carry as they walked out of the room.
is working, just like
"He –" Harry looked at Draco, who was now openly laughing. "But –" The portrait had been a still life yesterday, Harry was sure of it. A laboratory scene, with several cauldrons and an empty wingback chair. He looked closer. The chair wasn't empty any longer. Snape sat there, his lips curled in a sneer Harry hadn't seen for years, not since he'd last visited McGonagall in her office at Hogwarts.
, he thought, turning abruptly as the rough sound echoed through the corridor. It sounded like – snoring? Coming from the bathroom? He pushed the door open, ready to Stun or Disarm whomever he found there if necessary.
done something with someone? He wrinkled his nose, disgusted with his inability to admit – even to himself – that realistically, it wouldn't have been just
"I'm pleased so far," he said. "Thanks again for bringing this by."
"How about Carina?" He offered, his eyes returning to the baby.
He broke away, covering the ground between them and the ornately carved doors to the ballroom in a few powerful strides. He bypassed his own table, heading straight for Ron and Hermione, who had just cut the cake and were now stepping onto the dance floor.
write those emails, didn't you, Potter? You didn't farm them out to Hermione or someone else, did you?"
Draco smirked, winking at his oldest friend. "Jealous?"
Harry laughed, shaking his head. "You never change, do you Rita?"

"Er, there was an accident in the interrogation room. I had a vial of Hair Thickening Potion in my pocket, and it, er, fell out onto the floor as I was leaving," Ron said, his face red. "I, ah, dropped a bottle of Veritaserum, too."
Draco followed, but paused at the door, his horrified gaze locked on the stained mattress in the far corner, the single, bare bulb hanging from the sloping, cobweb-covered ceiling and the neat row of cleaning supplies stacked against the wall.
"So, what happened?" Neville asked, hoping Draco couldn't hear the tremor in his voice.
His bedroom was set for seduction – a bath filled with scented oil charmed to stay the perfect temperature, an array of massage oils and flavored lubricants to have fun with, the bed covered in sheets so soft they were like a cloud, sets of silk pajamas for both of them for after – but Harry didn't have the willpower to make it there. There was no way the two wizards would make it up a flight of stairs, nor did he think either of them was in any state to Apparate.
know?
Daphne nodded, smiling as she popped another cracker in her mouth.
"I give you a symbol of my love, devotion and fidelity," he said, his smile growing. "
"You're perfect for each other," Harry whispered, squeezing Ron's tuxedo-clad shoulder.
Draco picked up on the clue instantly as well, chuckling softly. The man might have been a Gryffindor when he was at Hogwarts – and Draco had no way of knowing whether that was 10 months ago or 10 years ago – but he clearly took a Slytherin approach to things. He found himself even more intrigued with the mystery man after reading his response, and he approved of the man's suggestion to simply exchange emails for the time being wholeheartedly.
They both turned to Kingsley, who had Summoned the marriage contract from Harry's desk in the study, looking over it and nodding his approval. The two wizards had successfully completed all of the contract's stipulations. He saw no reason their bond would be rejected, nor any reason that the couple couldn't keep claiming rights under
Hermione frowned, trying to process Neville's words. There must be more to it to justify the Cheshire grin Harry was currently wearing.
Malfoy.
"A Slytherin, Harry? For shame," Ron teased after Harry gave him the highlights of the letter over lunch at the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade.
Ron was still in Draco's office two hours later when Pansy came in with a large package. The redhead grinned when he recognized the familiar shape glad he was getting the chance to see Draco open one of Harry's gifts. This one was a big one, too. He hadn't been there when Harry purchased it, but he'd seen it the next day when he and Harry went over the spells and enchantments on it carefully, ensuring nothing dangerous was present.
"Mr. Wedgewick," Draco said, bowing formally to the shorter man. His gaze shifted to the other man who had been called back, bowing to him as well. "Potter."
"She's just brilliant, Gin. Well done!" Theo had caught him on his way to the room and taken him to the nursery to see their daughter, Fredricka. Harry could hardly believe how tiny she was.
Draco smiled. He knew his secretary was confused about why he would send his personal owl on an errand instead of entrusting it to her and one of the company's messengers or birds, but he didn't want anyone to know what was in the carefully padded package on Orion's leg.
He heard others on the dance floor giggle, probably laughing at the fact that it appeared as though he couldn't take his eyes off his bride even for a moment.
Theo chuckled, releasing his wand from its holster and handing it to her base first.

"Cal, how about a game of Clue?" He asked as he entered the drawing room, inclining his head formally to his mother as he passed her. "Not the Harry Potter version, Caleum," he groaned, rubbing his face briskly when he saw the game in his son's hands.
“Now,” she said, grasping the hand that now limply held Theo’s wand, “raise your wand –”
He grinned, sitting back to enjoy the unfamiliar film. He'd already worked his way through his favorites –
different!
Hermione hadn't heard that yet. She didn't think Harry was doing very well, if the point was romance. She hadn't understood the first or second gifts – albums and memorabilia from an American Muggle band? – and today's gift was equally odd, a book on the natural life cycle of the Magnolia tree. Clearly, Harry needed some help in the romance department.
This letter and its ramifications will be unexpected. But if I've learned anything over these last few months, it's that the unexpected happens frequently.
"I don't need to be able to
He couldn't hide his disappointment when he opened his email, even though the automated response was no less than he'd expected. No matter, he assured himself. He'd just have to get creative.
Hermione crossed her arms over her skimpy bikini, frowning as she watched her new husband stare out at the waves. They'd been in Fiji for over a week and he'd been somewhat distant the entire time. She'd even pulled her most revealing swimsuit out this morning – a gift from Ginny that was so indecent she'd blushed at the thought of even wearing it in the privacy of their bedroom, let alone on a beach where others could see her.
The house-elf wrinkled her brow, fluttering her long fingers nervously. "Master Cal?"
Draco's mouth dropped open, his hands fisting on his hips. Harry was just going to
"Nev and Daph," Draco explained, carefully transferring crispy pancetta pieces to a towel to drain. He threw chunks of chicken into the pan, letting them sizzle in the rendered fat.
He watched Draco carefully, unsure of what part he'd played in Potter's latest bit of exhibitionist wanking. Something was up, he knew, from the way his normally calm godson flushed suddenly. Severus cast a speculative glance around the room, but found Draco's bedroom door still tightly shut. Not a spell, then.
"Oh, hell. You, too?" she asked, scowling as she grabbed a pen to sign both sheets. She'd just lost her two most popular clients in one fell swoop.
Harry smiled, kicking Draco lightly under the table. "She knew you didn't mean it," he said, returning his attention to his laptop screen. "It'll settle down soon."
"Just a minute," Harry responded, doing the same deep-breathing exercises he could hear his bond mate going through.
"She doesn't look like a Lyra," he said quietly, studying his newborn sister's face closely. "Vela isn't right, either."
"Malfoy?" he asked, his eyes widening as he realized the footsteps hadn't belonged to Hermione after all. "What are
Harry stuck a spatula in the pocket of his apron, whistling softly to himself as he opened the oven door and checked on his frittata. It was browning nicely around the edges, but a deft shake of the skillet's handle proved it wasn't set in the middle yet. He shoved it back inside, letting the door slam as he turned to check on the coffee.
Neville smiled, returning Draco's hug. "January."
Harry nodded, settling Cari on his hip. He looked around the platform, wondering if Draco would make good on his promise not to come or not. He couldn't imagine not being there to see Cal off, but he knew they had said a private goodbye earlier that morning.
"Mr. Malfoy, please repeat after me: I give you a symbol of my love, devotion and fidelity."
"No," Hermione said, stifling a yawn. She hadn't been kidding when she'd said Harry's dreams had been waking them. She blushed darker, remembering the past few nights and the sounds she'd heard coming out of his room. "Silencing Charm?"
"I'm afraid there's only one remedy," she said, biting her lip. Draco was leafing through the chapter on bonds, half-listening to what she was saying. "You have to get married."
“Oh, come on!” Ron whined loudly, collapsing into a chair near the base of the girls’ staircase. He’d been waiting for Lavender for what seemed like
"I, Draco Abraxas Malfoy, Head of the House of Malfoy, Heir to the House of Black, do so swear on my magic that I have no bonds or entanglements that prevent me from offering my hand in matrimony to Harry James Potter."
"It may not be a traditional present, but it
Harry's wolfish grin was back, and he nodded enthusiastically.
"Let's go," he said, borrowing some of Harry's Gryffindor bravery and plunging his head into the basin.
"You would know, if there was something
Careful not to jostle the baby lying on the blanket beneath him, Harry reached an arm around blindly behind him, capturing his godson and pulling him down to the floor. He whirled, rucking up Teddy's shirt to give him the same treatment.
“It’s –” her eyes widened as he began to pant, his breath coming in small, uneven gasps. Thinking he was on the verge of tears, Hannah hurriedly gathered up her book and stuffed it back in her bag. In her experience, Slytherins hated having witnesses to their weakness. Dating Blaise hadn’t done much for her Transfiguration skills, but it had taught her that much.
He swallowed hard, wondering what could have happened that would have resulted in something sticky in his hair. Oh, Merlin. He hadn't offered to re-enact his dream, had he?
"It's been nearly a week," he said, forcing himself to take a calming breath. The Healer they'd consulted with via Fire-call had suggested meditation and relaxation techniques, saying those would help them master the impulses the bond awakened. She was Harry's personal Healer, sworn to secrecy with an oath even more stringent than the normal Healer's Oath. "But you're right. It will eventually pass."
"No relationship between Smith and Potter! Boy-Who-Lived provides Pensieve proof!" The standard shot of Potter accompanied this one, and Draco couldn't help but return the shy smile in the photo.
A powerful pulse of energy rippled through the room. At its epicenter, Harry and Draco both gasped, their bodies literally pushed together by the force of the magic. Face to face, they exchanged a startled glance before Harry broke into an enormous grin and brought his mouth down on Draco's.
"Yes, thank you," she said with a self-deprecating grin.
Cal tugged on Kingsley's robes, interrupting the Minister. He bent, listening intently as the boy whispered in his ear. He chuckled, standing once more.
His knees trembled, and he sat heavily in his desk chair. Merlin. But the
Straightforward, but maybe too much so.
"Fourteen," Pansy confirmed taking a calm sip of her own drink; it was a Muggle concoction Harry loved called a Tom Collins. It wasn't bad. "Most couples spread those out over weeks or months, but our Harry's in a hurry, so he's doing one a day. They don't have to be grand, just a token of affection or respect."
Ron nodded quickly, feeling his own cheeks heat at the thought of what they'd overheard. It had been incredibly embarrassing and erotic at the same time.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. I love them like they were my own, but unfortunately, they're not.
He scanned through the emails in his inbox, scrolling down until he found one from Gryffin. Curious, he thought. There was only one, and it was dated the day he left. He opened it quickly.
He resumed his offensive against Cal's stomach, not stopping until the boy started flailing and he nearly lost his grip. Laughing himself, Blaise lowered the now-boneless boy to the floor, gently settling him against the priceless Aubusson.
"To whom it may concern:
"Mr. Malfoy, please calm down!" The Healer shouted, leveling her wand at him as he fought.
Neville waited for either man to protest, but they remained silent. He grinned triumphantly. He'd just averted a day or two long fight in under two minutes.
"Well?" Blaise asked, impatient with Draco's unreadable silence.
"I mean, it's not like he told me he was Harry bloody Potter, for fuck's sake," Draco said, shaking his head. "James Evans. Really. I still can't believe it."
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They don't belong to me.
"I love Daphne Longbottom."
Harry's eyes widened comically. "You wouldn't –"
"Whatever you want, Cal. I'll have the house-elves make us some of your favorites, and we can go riding afterward. Alright?"
She stuck her tongue out at Teddy, crossing her arms. She loved playing games with him – he was incredibly smart, and a better opponent than Ron was at almost everything but chess.
on the table in front of her. Thankfully, Hermione noticed from her spot under the table, the girl had chosen a seat a few down from where she and Theo were sitting.
The Auror simply quirked an eyebrow, his gaze shifting from Draco's sweaty face to the file in front of him again. They couldn't have already known that, could they?
Blaise saw Draco stiffen, and he knew the man wouldn't want Cal to see the emotions that were likely playing across his face. He charged forward, swooping in and lifting Cal into his arms before the boy could protest.
The press had a field day with Harry and Smith having lunch together, running wild headlines about their relationship and how they'd overcome Harry's infidelity with Oliver. Draco had followed the coverage out of what he'd told himself was idle curiosity. No different than the rest of the world, which hung on every single word Skeeter wrote about the couple.
Luna watched the little family, knowing she'd made the right choice. It was hard to give the little girl up, but she'd come into this knowing she wouldn't be the baby's mother. Harry had been stunned when she'd approached him nearly a year ago with the offer to bear a child for him to continue on the Potter line. With her blonde hair and light eyes, there was a good chance the child would look like a blend of Harry and Draco, just like Cal did.

"See you around, Zach," he said, grinning like an idiot as he made his way toward the door, Ron hot on his heels.
He shook his head, grimacing when the movement caused pain to spike through his temples. He was resolute in not allowing himself the potion, but a strong jolt of caffeine might have the same results.
“G-good,” Theo grumbled, his eyes still closed as he fought off his climax. They might have fooled the Hufflepuff so far, but there was no way even Hannah could mistake an orgasm for anything else.
"Are we?" Draco gasped, rolling his shoulders under the scalding hot spray. Every muscle in his body ached.
Draco recognized Wedgewick and two others, since he'd had a few dealings with the board before. The witch was a new addition – recently elected, he'd heard, replacing a man who had apparently moved away.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. I don't own 'em. My undying gratitude to Kamerreon for the beta!
Harry looked up, smiling in a way he hoped looked vaguely reassuring. "Yeah?"
Draco almost growled in frustration. "Nothing. I had nothing to do with it."
not? – they'd be great together. They're both strong-willed enough to reign each other in, and they're both capable of a tremendous amount of love and affection. It's something neither had as a child, not really, and you know they both crave it. And Harry really wants children. I think he'd adore Cal."
, he thought, allowing his mind to drift to Sly and their last conversation. It hadn't ended well, but Harry was confident he'd made amends, between sharing his own mortifying secret and sending Sly a bottle of truly excellent French wine. He knew how much the man loved the full-bodied red wines of the Dordogne region, which was why he'd Apparated there to buy the bottle. The label he'd chosen wasn't available outside the small town it was produced in, and he knew Sly would know that. Surely that would show how sorry he was?
"I repeat: And?"
Harry growled in frustration, pushing Draco back with his palms as he drew his body away from the blond's. Draco's confused frown became a smile when Harry pulled him down to the couch and straddled his lap, pausing so Draco could position his cock before sliding down onto it with a satisfied grunt.
Draco's hand found Harry's under the podium, squeezing it tightly. Just a few more questions, and they could head back to France. Neither missed living in London, though they did make it a point to stay in one of the Malfoy flats in the city several times a year. Never Grimmauld Place; that was why Harry was so willing to have the press conference there. With any luck, the media would camp out in front of it, hoping for a glimpse of the family, never realizing they didn't actually live there.
Harry turned to Theo, half expecting him to bolt as well, but the former Slytherin looked just as confused as Harry felt. He shrugged, taking a sip of the cider in his champagne glass. He'd sworn off drinking for awhile after his experience on Ron's stag night.
The tired editors and publicists glowed at the praise, some of them breaking into spontaneous applause. This was another reason he was allowed into their inner sanctum, a place most authors were refused entry – his charm and modesty. They all truly loved working with Harry, who rarely missed deadlines or threw fits over edits or publicity schedules. James Evans was a hard worker, a talented writer and an all-around nice man.
"This, Mr. Potter, sir?" he asked, reaching out to grasp the side of the stone basin. "It was hand-carved in 1611 by a renowned Seer named Chaitali, rumored to be the result of a thirty-day spirit meditation fast."
"I just –" Neville stopped, looking away. He was so
He grinned, shoving the box on his kitchen table as he walked through to his study, flicking his wand to turn on lights as he went. It was late, but he wanted to check in and see if Sly had emailed.
The elf hesitated, looking down at her feet. She was wearing ballet slippers today, and Draco had to fight to keep his thoughts focused instead of letting them wander to why exactly the diminutive house-elf would be wearing the odd footwear.
"Harry's not well," she said, pushing him lightly away from the table. She blocked Zach's approach with her own body, angling toward him so Harry could get away. "The flu, we think. He was just leaving to see if he could track down a potion for his headache."
Harry watched until the train pulled out of the station, full of pride and anxiety. As the heavy smoke cleared, he saw most of the other parents had left. No one had recognized him, thanks to a light glamour that hid his more recognizable features. Cari had laughed when he cast it, filling his bedroom with delighted giggles and cries of 'Silly daddy! Silly!'
"I'm sorry you had to waste an afternoon, Weasley," Draco said, and Ron marveled that the man actually
The assembled crowd groaned, so Draco figured they were there to support the petitioners.
Harry nodded woodenly, his shoulders straightening with resolve. He looked over at Draco, who had a similar fierce expression. If this was what needed to be done, it's what they would do. They'd be married in the end, and that was all that mattered.

the slender piece of holly would respond just as well for him as it did for Harry. His own wand twitched slightly in his loose grip as though seeking out its other master's hand.
, Draco thought, groaning with relief when he felt the soft tug on his balls. He wasted no time mirroring Gryffin's actions, his hands trembling as he released himself from the cock ring. They'd been at this for what seemed like an eternity, and his body was so grateful to be allowed fulfillment that he didn't even have to stroke himself before he was coming, gasping out a string of meaningless words and profanity as come spattered over his hand and stomach. Wave after wave of bliss rolled over him, leaving him completely boneless and gasping for breath when it finally finished.
"How long have you known Malfoy and I were writing to each other?"
Harry gave Neville a bleak smile before joining Draco in the Pensieve. It hadn't been his intent to view them alongside the other wizard when he'd extracted them, but he could see now it was the best way. He'd be able to answer Draco's questions along the way, and offer support to help him get through the worst of it.
, he thought distantly, his stomach roiling as fresh blood dripped down his throat.
“I didn’t hear any complaints out of you at the time,” she snapped, looking around in her bag for something to cover herself for the long walk to Gryffindor. Theo wasn’t wearing robes, so she couldn’t just borrow his, she noted with a grimace.
"– end of March, which is fine with me. We'll be ready for some warm weather by then, eh?"
Harry laughed, a bit of unease slipping across his face. He'd talked with Neville about it before buying the puppy, and the man had assured him Draco was planning to buy a Crup for Cal soon. Harry figured it had been a safe gift, but maybe he'd been wrong?
Harry took another sip of whisky, grateful for the slight burn as it trailed down his throat. It distracted him from Draco's tantalizing nearness.
"It's a law?"
He swallowed, licking his lips. He looked away, hoping the spell would be broken if he didn't have eye contact with Draco. His gaze traveled around the room, his eyes widening when they lit on his desk. His desk, with the warded drawer no one but Harry could get into.
Draco stroked himself, shuddering as his warm hand closed around his hard cock. His breath hitched when he saw Gryffin's words appear.
"Draco?" Neville asked tentatively, wondering if Harry had known the gift would upset the man. Was that why he'd asked him to be there when Draco opened it? Why would Harry have sent something that would distress the man he was courting?
who will only be drinking soda from here on out, too.”
Harry's lips parted, and he swallowed dutifully. Neville reached behind him, two more vials in his hand. "Again," he said, pushing the vial against Harry's lips. "One more," he said, tipping the contents of the last vial into Harry's mouth.
Harry nodded encouragingly, squeezing Draco's hands. He hated that Draco had been married before, but how could he resent something that resulted in Cal? The boy was fast becoming like a son to him.
Incarcerous
No, not the right tone.
," he said, snorting when her expression changed from wary to calculating.
Hermione tutted, shaking her head at his failed attempt. The parchment hadn’t even wavered.
Harry arched and groaned, running his long fingers through fine, silky blond hair. He was covered in sweat, his heart beating frantically as he ground against Draco, his eyes bright as he watched his cock slide in and out of Draco's swollen red lips as he fucked his mouth.
"Where. Is. My. Son?" He bit out, breathing heavily as the band of fear around his chest tightened.
He looked up, searching through the fog that had settled over the vineyard, his head turned toward the deep, familiar voice. He couldn't see further than the vine in front of him – he had no idea how the man even knew he was out here.
Neville shook his head as though trying to clear it, blinking as he thought of his friends.
"He was just taking the piss out of me, Gin," Harry said quickly, earning a grateful look from Ron, who surreptitiously rubbed his arse where Ginny had hit him with the Stinger earlier.
"They wanted to be frogs!" Victoire whined from the stairs. She was sitting on the top step, her silvery blonde hair brushing the ground.
"Some of us are capable of doing more than one thing at once," she chided, turning the page of the contract. "I'm paying attention, but I'm not sure
Draco pulled a dormant Golden Snitch out of his pocket, absently stroking it until its tiny wings began to flutter. It was charmed to stay put until thrown, so he didn't have to worry about it escaping and wreaking havoc through the chateau. It was a poor substitute for Harry, but since it had been one of the gifts from him, accompanied by a written promise to play a Seeker's game sometime in the near future, Draco kept it close.
Draco winked at Neville. "We should also thank you for standing by us through this courtship. It couldn't have been easy for you, especially these last few days."
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. I don't own 'em. My undying gratitude to Kamerreon for the beta!
"You're naked!" Draco cried, his eyes still wide from watching Harry, clad only in an apron, bending over the stove.
Teddy quirked an eyebrow, and Ron laughed at seeing such an adult expression on his face. He was still a year away from starting at Hogwarts, but he was clearly magically and emotionally mature enough to go. Harry and McGonagall had already intervened with Andromeda, begging the woman to let her grandson start in the fall, but she'd steadfastly held her ground. She wanted as much time with Teddy as possible, which meant no going away to school early.
Harry noticed Ron had edged up so he was blocking her slightly with his body. He felt no tug on his bond, no reason to think they were a threat. He glanced at Draco, who looked similarly untroubled.
Malfoy
"Harry's –"
"So," Harry continued, not waiting for an answer. He knew Draco well enough to know he wouldn't speak until he was over his snit about Harry's lateness. "I figured out a way around the no-touching thing."
Ron paused, his expression uneasy. He knew exactly why, but he also knew Harry wanted it to be a surprise. Still, it was odd he hadn't included a note with the gift, at least outlining its provenance.
She batted the paper away before he had a chance to do more than unfold it, straddling his lap as she sank down to face him. She heard his breath catch, and her heart sped up as his eyes darkened with arousal. He took a good look at her swimsuit for the first time, something akin to awe stealing over his face as he realized how little fabric actually separated her from complete nudity.
"'Mione?" he croaked, blinking as he searched the table for his glasses, not realizing they were still on his face. He swallowed, grimacing at the taste in his mouth, and rubbed his eyes, the action pushing his glasses aside. He took them off, regarding them with surprise before replacing them and clearing his throat. "Hermione."
So, what are you doing these days, Potter?
He moaned when Draco laughed, the vibrations sending shivers of pleasure through him. Just as he approached his orgasm, the wet heat disappeared. Harry's eyes flew open, his stare accusing as Draco sat back on his heels.
Harry nodded absently, picking at his heaping plate of paella. He usually loved the dish, especially the way the chef there prepared it, but today he just wasn't hungry. The pungent saffron reminded him of a flurry of emails he and Sly –
Neville watched her, frowning. He'd realized, of course, that it was up to him. He'd just hoped Pansy would be able to provide some sort of guidance or advice. On one hand, he didn't want his friends to get hurt, which was surely what would happen in the end if they were allowed to meet without any sort of warning. On the other hand, he really did think Harry and Draco could work as a couple, and if he intervened now, they'd never know. He could only hope that they'd become close enough as Sly and Gryffin to eventually get past their aversions to each other.
"Weasley, no," Draco snapped, leaning over Theo and Blaise to grab the redhead's robes when it became clear Potter was too drunk to realize what was going on.
"What?" Ron shouted, his hand automatically going for his wand. Harry grabbed his wrist, forcing it down.
he thought, a low moan escaping his lips as he felt Gryffin's thumb drag against the plump vein along the underside of his cock, the friction almost more than he could bear. He pressed himself harder against the chair, his arm trembling as he mimicked the motion, hoping Gryffin found it as pleasurable as he did.
Or worse. Harry moaned, slumping against the wall. A hot blush flooded his cheeks as he wondered what he might have said to the Slytherin in his drunken state.
Draco turned, his eyes narrowing as he studied the other wizard. He couldn't bring himself to be mad at Neville or Pansy, though he did think they should have intervened. The more rational part of him knew Pansy had been oath-bound not to reveal the secret, though, and it wasn't hard to imagine that the Gryffindor beside him would have been reluctant to betray his – or Potter's – trust.
he thought, his teeth clenched as three more chat requests popped up, none of them from the one user he wanted to talk to, each of them cheesier than the last.
Hermione wrinkled her nose as she stepped out of the Floo, the smell of stale whisky immediately evident. She stepped around what looked like part of a broken bottle of Butterbeer, careful not to touch it – or the puddle of liquid next to it – with her shoe.
Harry arched an eyebrow appreciatively, unsure how they'd managed that. If anyone could, though, it would be George.
She looked so much like his father, just like he looked so much like his dad. Caleum smiled, happy that their family was complete at last. He and his father had been waiting for this moment for years, though apparently dad hadn't realized it. He smirked at the memory of his dad worrying they wouldn't want to take Aunt Luna up on her offer – how could he not have known they were missing a piece of their family?
He Summoned the contents, picking through the jumble of paperwork until he found the Gringotts statements they'd just been discussing. The Ataliers' son Cato had been steadily embezzling from them since he took the helm of their apothecary business a few months ago. Profits had been declining, but the Ataliers preferred to blame Draco's management of their investments and properties for the losses instead of their son's obvious duplicity.
"It wouldn't be a bad thing to take this slow, like he says, Draco," Blaise said after reading the email. He smirked at the signature – a Gryffindor?
"Thought I'd get front row seats for the show," Blaise said easily, brushing a bit of ash off his robes.

"Can't," Draco ground out as Harry's thumb swept over the head of his cock, the sensation further heightened by the smear of precome that had gathered there. "Too much. Can't –" he broke off, his words lost in a moan. "
Draco rolled his eyes, returning his gaze to the screen. "Prat."
"Besides, what's the worst thing that could happen? You've planned for every possible contingency," he joked, stretching to pick up the pen. After all these years, he still preferred them to quills. "What are you so worried about? The best man getting into a brawl with one of the guests?"
Kingsley looked out over the group, pitching his words so they could all hear.

"I'm Nellie Ireson from
Neville spluttered, pushing Cal behind him when the three men suddenly appeared in the chateau's entryway.
"It's no big deal," Draco continued his gaze still locked on his son, who was attempting to stand on the broom, which hovered a meter or so off the ground. He'd already cast several Cushioning charms on the ground, but he'd intervene if Cal tried it any higher. "So what? Gryffin is Potter. I'd have found out next weekend anyway. Yesterday was unpleasant, but it saved me an awkward date at any rate."
aren't judging him just because he was a Slytherin, Harry," she said, shooting Ron a cold look. "Good for you.
"It's no problem," Draco assured them, rocking back on his heels. "Just do whatever you need to for Freddie. You'll let me know if you need anything?"
The last article had nothing to do with Draco Fire-calling Pansy, though. He assured himself he was only doing his duty as a good friend in checking up with the couple. It couldn't be an easy time for them, with reporters camped out on their doorstep and dogging after Oliver, hoping for a photo of him and Harry out somewhere together.
, but I'm here to tell you that it very nearly cost you everything you've worked for!"
"It will be fine," Harry repeated, easily following Draco's troubled thoughts. "Ward and lock the room, and I'll be through in twenty minutes. We won't do anything that will interfere with the courtship, I promise."
