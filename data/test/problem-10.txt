“Come on ‘Mione, it’s bloody hilarious! Draco went bonkers for nearly two weeks about how Harry couldn’t control his magic and now he’s gone and done it himself!” Ron’s laughter spilled across the room and even Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
After that summer had passed in a flurry of friends and family.  Grimmauld Place had become the house between all, not a week went by that it hadn’t seen visitors.  Luna, Goyle, and Pansy visited every Thursday.  Neville, Hannah, Dean, and Seamus would have dinner with them every Tuesday.  And Saturday’s saw dinners with Ron, Hermione while Sundays were dinners with Narcissa, Andromeda, and little Teddy.  The two sisters mending their relationship while little Teddy ran circles around Harry and Draco, his hair flashing from black to platinum.
“Have I?” Harry smiled and continued on his way back up to his room where he settled in, grateful for the plate of food sitting on his writing desk that was held under a stasis charm.
“Harry! Welcome back! I see you’ve finally rid yourself of the wrackspurts, how wonderful!” Luna smiled brightly.
Draco merely huffed out a laugh. “The only thing Harry will unfortunately die from, is his own stupidity. I however pride myself on being capable and quick-witted.”
Harry turned away from McGonagall and helped Malfoy support the weight of the younger Slytherin, and without a glance back to his friends he and Malfoy began walking the poor boy in the direction of the Hospital wing.
if Harry suggested he and Draco live separately simply for the blonde's safety.  All thoughts thereafter abruptly halted when Harry realized something far more important, Draco had used wandless magic, not just any wandless magic either.  It was corporeal and shining just as Harry’s was those few times he had lost control. Harry could only imagine the panic Draco was in seeing him on the floor, unconscious at Dolohov’s feet.  Harry, in his still addled state, felt the laughter bubble in him.  Draco had always reminded Harry of a snake, companionable and affectionate but when scared he could and would lash out with blinding ferocity.  Harry found that he liked snakes, even despite his sordid history with them.  He could only imagine the explosion of anger that had been Draco Malfoy, he would be very unhappy for sometime that he was unconscious for it.
“How dare any of you!” Harry shouted, a rattle about the stone walls had even Harry’s friends watching on in fear.
“It’s just nasty snake is all!” Shouted one of the boys. “You should be thanking us! We’re doing what you did!”
When Harry entered the 8th year common room, Luna was the only one there, her legs tucked under her as she sat on the sofa in front of the fire.
The return to Hogwarts for the ‘8th Years’, as McGonagall had called them, came with little to no fanfare.  For which they had all been immensely grateful for.  They had all arrived at the castle the night prior to when the remainder of the students were set to arrive, and to no one’s surprise, they all agreed amongst each other that the pain was far too raw for them to be in the Great Hall for extended periods of time.  The Headmistress was sympathetic and told them that their common room, as they would all be sharing one rather than being split back into their houses, would accommodate a small dining room for them as well.
“When I came back, the first thing I smelled was tea and honey.  I thought it was my mother who was with me.  When my head cleared and she whispered, I realized it was Narcissa.” Harry whispered as he lay curled in bed with Draco. “I’d like to think that if things had been different, they could have been good friends. Your mother and mine.”
For nearly two weeks Harry let that night with Draco play in his head on repeat. It fueled him through his anger, his sadness.  He let himself feel the weight of everything that had happened.  He let the memory of that night become the catalyst that allowed him to let out every negative emotion he had been harboring deep down since before he could even remember.  His life with the Dursley’s, his escape from them only to be marred by the constant threat of death all the way up until the battle.  He let himself be angry, he let himself grieve.  And he let his magic flow through him, unbridled and unchecked.  Harry held himself back just enough to not destroy Grimmauld entirely.  He let his magic strip the family tapestry from the wall and tear through the house, room after room.  Brilliant swirls of gold and orange tore through the furniture, through knick-knacks and books and heirlooms.  He brought down entire walls. He sat and saw each face before him, his friends and family he had lost in the war, and he let his magic all but gut No. 12 Grimmauld Place.
“Potter! Wake the fuck up!” Malfoy was shouting at him.  Harry pulled himself together to take stock of his surroundings. Draco Malfoy was on top of him practically smothering him into the mattress and it was unbearably hot, so much so he practically felt on fire.
It wasn’t long until Harry drifted off into a restless sleep, dreaming of wild and angry red hair, the swirl of magic pulling from beneath his skin, and the distinct metallic and burnt smell that haunted all his nightmares that involved the war.
“Under control my arse.” Draco muttered into Harry’s neck, peppering kisses and nipping bites at Harry’s pulse point.
“Come on.” Harry coughed, the pain in his ribs had thankfully dulled to just a throb. “We had it under control. Besides, Draco is right, if you guys had come through there was a chance you could’ve been hurt as well.”
“Filth! Scum! How dare you disgrace the noble house of Black!” Walburga shouted, practically on repeat.
She held her son, because truly that’s what Harry had become to her.  She squeezed him tight and welcomed him back, and Harry returned the hug with such heartfelt emotion that he made Molly cry.
“I’m sorry you guys, but I’m alright.” Harry squeezed his friends tighter. “I’ll be alright.” Hermione sobbed and Ron just patted Harry’s back.
“Potter! You’re supposed to be watching him. No sitting there giggling to yourself like some blithering fool!” Draco bit out as he snatched his wand back from Harry’s grasp.  “You’ll be going to St. Mungo’s once we’re done here.”  Dacro then proceeded to cast several body binding spells on Dolohov’s still unconscious form before casting Rennervate and forcing the vial of veritaserum down the man’s throat.
It was just two days before Hogwarts took it’s Christmas break.  Harry still had not returned to the castle and his wards had rejected everything from floo calls, to owls, to even someone who had tried to apparate into the house, and also what he suspected to be a howler from Hermione.
And as if Draco had summoned her by merely speaking her name, the Headmistress was round the corner into the corridor, her face set in anger and her robes billowing menacingly behind her.
“Don’t make empty promises Potter.” Draco grumbled, cutting Harry off and looking away from him. “You’re far too reckless to promise something like that.
“Idiot.” Draco shook his head as he helped Harry readjust, muttering charms to numb the pain that was blossoming across Harry’s mid-section. “Dolohov. Apparently, you and yours had obliviated him? I’m not sure how he got his memories back, nor how he even managed to make it through our wards but I do have some veritaserum in my potions stores we could use.”
Harry settled himself in for bed and instead focused on worrying about the holidays.  They had just another two weeks before Christmas break and his nerves were frayed on the matter.  He and Ginny had barely spoken after the war and now he would be living with her and the rest of the Weasley for the entirety of the Christmas break.  Post-war he had managed barely a week at The Burrow before taking off for Grimmauld.  Molly was beside herself but he needed to be alone and process things, and the Weasley’s needed time to themselves as well.  After that, Harry had remained at Grimmauld for the entirety of the summer, only popping around to the Burrow for the occasional lunch or dinner, even then avoiding Ginny.  Though it wasn’t as hard as Harry thought it would be, he got the hint that she was avoiding him as well.
When Hermione and Ron had taken a few breaths and calmed themselves too, they noticed it as well.  Harry no longer looked haunted, his eyes were bright and shining and he exuded hope.  He looked healthy, for probably one of the first times in his life and Ron and Hermione couldn’t help but pull Harry into a hug when Molly had finally let go of him.
Harry could feel the rage in him swell just as it had before. He felt his magic course through his veins and crack like lightning across his finger tips, sparks were flying every which direction burning tapestry, rugs, and wood alike.  He wanted to destroy something, something more than just Walburga’s portrait. He wanted to be mad and lash out, but there was something stopping him. There was a voice in the back of his mind, calling his name, just as that same voice had the first time Harry let his control over his magic slip.
“The Great Wizard, the Dark Lord himself will wipe you all clean from this world and the noble house of Black will be restored!” Walburga cackled.  Harry felt a nerve snap, and without hesitation he spoke the incantation, his wand left untouched and shoved into his pocket.
Harry and Draco would spend the night before Christmas Eve curled in on each other, Draco lamenting about his fear of losing Harry and Harry in turn, whispering promises and love into the soft corners and edges of Draco’s skin and together they would continue to build up their home and their happiness. And if anyone would catch a glimpse of gold and silver magic shimmering and swirling about them, they would only look on in wonder and watch as the two intertwine and weave about each other then gently fade away again.
“Draco, look at me please.” Harry whispered. Malfoy’s eyes snapping back up at the use of his first name. “I can control it much better now. And I swear I would never hurt you. Please.” Slowly Harry let go of Malfoy’s wrists and he repositioned himself and sat down beside Malfoy on the bed.
Harry’s eyes never left Draco’s when he released his magic, dropping the boy to the ground. With a nod Draco walked past Harry and helped the poor battered Slytherin boy off the ground.
“Others?” Draco froze momentarily. “Oh, I closed the floo and locked down all the wards. No one in and no one out.” Draco waved his hand as if brushing the subject away entirely. “Here, Merlin only knows where your wand has gone.  If he stirs even a bit, stupefy his ass again. I’m going to go dig out the veritaserum.” Draco was up and away in moments.  Leaving Harry blurry about the edges but pointing Draco’s wand at a blacked out Dolohov.
“Filthy death eaters!” The other boy chimed in, spitting at the Slytherin boy who was still curled in on himself on the floor where he had fallen when the spell broke.  Harry could feel the rage peeking inside of him.
“How did you get past the wards?” Draco warned, his voice cold and firm.  When the attacker didn’t respond, the magic tightened further around his neck. “I won’t ask again.” Draco hissed. The attacker only gurgled. “So be it.” Draco shrugged. “
Later that night Harry would find himself in the gardens of the Burrow with nothing more than the moon and Ginny for company.  He would hug her and say a goodbye of sorts.
“Your Dark Lord is dead.” Harry spat. “And the House of Black is mine.  Your time here is over Walburga.” Harry waved his hand and spoke once more. “
“As impressive as it was and despite that it has been nearly two months without such an incident again,” Draco drawled from his armchair by the fire. “Granger may very well be right.”
“No shit Potter!” Draco spat back. It was then that Harry noticed the rather sour complexion of Draco’s expression and the fear that flashed through his eyes.  His first thought was that Draco was probably living his worst nightmare, all over again.
"Please don't. That spell works better on the outside of people, not the inside." He says this to make Harry flush magnificently.
Malfoy clenches his jaw, eyes narrowing. Then, he says, "Fresh ink. Metal. Holly flowers." He doesn't look away from his feet. "And you?"
This time, she was wearing dark purple lipstick. It was always a risk when one of them wore makeup like that. They would need to rush to the girls' bathrooms, on separate sides of the castle, to fix up their appearances.
Warnings: teratophilic fantasies? Discussion of wet dreams from underage characters, but they're adults in the actual fic
And by the time the plant had its fill, the sun was beginning to rise. Draco's mind felt foggy, as if had just woken up from a deep sleep. His body felt sore and ache. The vines were able to wring four orgasms out of him, the last two completely dry. His prick hurt so bad he never wanted to touch himself again.
he was. With his other hand Sirius held both of the boy's wrists, square against the small of his back. A part of him hoped that the angle of his arms would give him a dull, aching pain.
to stutter like a second year talking to his crush? Is the mere fact that he has the hots for a Weasley not punishment enough?
Ron shrugged. "Blaise and I have been conspiring. You two are hard people to convince to express your feelings, you know that?"
Potter jerked a little but didn’t pull away and Draco realized he hadn’t moved an inch since they started. Strong hands met his shoulders. To pull him closer or push him away, Draco didn’t know. Potter was doing something amazing with his mouth and he didn’t want to stop.
Draco sighed involuntarily, zoning out as Weasley rushed to join the gaggle of students. Potter didn’t speak to him anymore after Madame Hooch moved on, so they ended up just sitting on the sidelines next to the changing room. Nobody else was deemed a Seeker by Madame Hooch’s standards, so it was just them.
"Truth," Ginny responded with a malicious grin. Harry's seen what happens to those who receive that grin— it's not good.
"No, I wasn't here for an interview," Hank said and grimaced. "I work for the Ministry. We've had reports of people using excessive Dreamless Sleep potion so I just wanted to check some records. People who buy large batches, maybe if large bunches have gone missing, anything will help."
When he opens his eyes, Gellert has moved. He's sitting just next to Albus, body turned inward towards him, with his trousers down to his ankles. His prick is hard and dripping at the tip where Gellert rubs his thumb against on every up stroke. His face is also as flushed as Albus' now.
"You can't do that," Draco said shakily. And, oh Merlin, tears welled up in his eyes and dripped down his face. "You can't do this to me. Expecting me to take you into my arms after violating my trust like that. Don't say
He shivers with every stroke his hand makes, closing his eyes so he can just listen to the parseltongue coming out of Harry's mouth. It sounds so nice. Rough and breathy.
"You want to be a good boy, don't you James?" Teddy asked, finally walking towards the bed. They pushed up their sleeves, revealing the sleeve tattoos that James loved so much. "You know what to say when I ask your color, don't you? Answer me, love."
The Great Hall was loud, so much louder than Harry ever remembered. Ron and Hermione were sitting next to him, on his right, and some Hufflepuffs he didn’t know were sitting on his left. There was a smaller table, fitting only about one hundred and fifty students, in front of the professors’ table. If he looked in front of him, Harry could see the four rows of the House tables. The classes looked smaller this year and he wondered how many parents decided to send their children off to other schools, deeming Hogwarts “unsafe.”
"We're going to have to tell them... eventually," Pansy says and Hermione can feel her jaw against her shoulder, moving as she speaks.
A flicker of a smile appeared on Draco's face. His face was the same color as his pale pink paisley scarf. "You won't have any trouble with that," he whispered and leaned in to press his lips against Harry's.
Everybody was staring at him. Some a little more surprised than others. Draco stood up and held out his hand. Harry took it on impulse, and found himself being dragged out of the living room. His head whirled but he hardly even drank.
The door locks behind him before he can think to take out his keys. Did he do that with wandless magic? Or did Hank do it?
If he had looked up, he would've noticed the gleam in Tertius' eye. He would've noticed the way he suddenly sat up a bit straighter.
No, he was not interested in fame. He would rather sit at his desk, alone (blissfully alone, without an echo of his mother's voice) and write his book— a potions instructional manual. The new Headmaster at Hogwarts had asked him to write a thing or two for new students and he couldn't turn down the opportunity. If he could inspire students to love the art of potion making the way he did, the writing was a small price to pay.
Draco’s eyebrows raised. “He really is dating Granger, then? I’d heard they’d gotten close, but I didn’t think they were actually dating.”
, Draco thinks. In his misery and warmth, he doesn't notice the smirk gracing Charlie's face, who clearly notices his ogling. Maybe it's for the best that he doesn't notice.
Warnings: dub-con confessions? Is that a tag? Well, the characters confess when they can't really consent to doing so.
The sweat and cum disappeared after they spoke. That spell was so helpful for times like these; when Teddy just wanted to lie down with their lover and comfort him. Standing up to get a handkerchief always ruined the mood and they didn't like leaving James so soon after a scene.
Ronarry! Does this count as a rare pair? They're both main characters so it makes complete sense that people ship them but I don't see a lot of content with this ship. Then again, I have some pretty severe drarry tunnel vision, so maybe I'm not the best person to talk about this.
Potter leaned back in the chair, arms over his chest defensively. “I bet you would, Princess Malfoy.” Draco froze at the nickname.
," Teddy added, pushing James' bound hands above his head. His body was strong and thick, hair covering every inch of freckled skin. "But I think you want to see me, love. I think you want to see my face when I finally push into you, is that right?"
But he nodded, albeit rolling his eyes at Ron’s statement. “I swear I’m okay. The ride was long and I am just exhausted from packing.”
"You've been sleeping in here an awful lot," she said softly. She always spoke quite softly. "Are there pests in your bedroom?"
James pushed his hips up on every down stroke of Teddy's hand. Teddy kept kissing his face and bathing in those whines and moans and grunts. They could see when his hands formed tight fists and his eyes closed that he was so, so close. Their hand stilled so he could do the work himself, swiping their thumb over his cockhead.
"Fuck," Hermione gasps desperately. She moves a hand to rest against Pansy's nape, pulling her mouth away from her sensitive nipples. "Do we have enough time to get you off?"
Too late, Ron realizes the parseltongue has stopped. Fear gripping his lungs, he opens up his eyes and stares straight into the flushed expression of his best friend. Ron's hand stills on his dick; it throbs angrily at not being able to reach completion.
Except... he can't tell if that's quite true. Draco would love to fuck Harry right now. Not even take his time with foreplay like he usually does. He just wants to stretch out Harry's hole into the shape of his cock.
Harry pops his head in the office with a wide grin. Narcissa eyes him warily; a grin like that can only mean trouble, in her experience. James was a few years younger than her when they were at Hogwarts but he made a lasting impression on her. With his and his friends' juvenile pranks and taunting and James' obsession with that muggleborn girl. She wasn't surprised her cousin got swept up with them when he was sorted into Gryffindor.
For a moment, Zygmunt allowed himself to believe that Tertius was going to use it to aid him in courting his sad, ugly self. He almost entertained the thought of telling him
Strangled groans woke Ron up from his light slumber. It takes only a moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness and for him to remember where he is. His Gryffindor dorm room, a few days into their autumn term, surrounded by their his friends. He sits up a bit and throws open his crimson bed curtains.
He falls to his knees in front of Harry. "Fuck you," he sobs in between breaths. "You can't really expect me to do this? Can you? Are you truly asking me to watch you fucking bleed out in front of me?"
He moved Seamus' arms to sit on his shoulders and then grabbed Seamus' waist. Then he swayed them both to the tune of ballroom music only inside his head. It was reminiscent of their dance at the Yule Ball, and made Dean's insides feel all fluttery again.
Ron’s jaw dropped and his eyes widened to the size of saucers. “Malfoy’s gonna be here? Why’s he need to be here, shouldn’t he have hundreds of thousands of Galleons in his family’s vault?”
Self-hatred wasn’t fitting of a Malfoy. He was going to be the head of the Malfoy house, the oldest surviving male. Not that his mother couldn’t handle the financial burden of the manor, but having that title did always make him grin.
There was silence for the better part of the night. He didn’t know where Potter was or why he came to the room later, but he didn’t want to know. Despite the tightness in his chest that longed to follow Potter wherever he went like some sort of dog, Draco wanted a simple, easy year. He knew the material from the bare minimum teaching he got from his seventh year. Absolutely no reason for him to make his life more difficult than it already was by getting involved with the Gryffindor; historically, it’s never helped him out one bit.
He was also hoping one of these people would smile back at him, let him know an inside joke, do anything to tell Draco that they were actually someone he desperately wanted to talk to. If not to clear the air, then definitely to scream at.
Fuck, his own apartment was beginning to be a weird spot. Potter only spent time there once yet made a lasting impression. Draco had seen the people of ash in Pompeii after the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. That was what entering his bedroom felt like; excavating a tragic scene and seeing the imprint of a loved one on his door.
"Please," Harry begged, turning into a moan as her hand traveled under his boxers. Her hands were cold against his hot sex.
Teddy was eager to finish up. They pointed their wand and stung him one last time. James sagged into the mattress and Teddy mused that they would need to change the sheets.
The cabin is less dark on the inside, especially when Charlie flicks the lights on. Multi-colored blankets were draped over the sofas, the fuzzy rugs were each a different neon color, and even his trinkets all had contrasting patterns and colors.
Once he caught his breath, another vine slipped between his bum and began rubbing against his hole. Is that why it wanted him to come? To make him more pliant? Draco was feeling a lot more relaxed, though his heart raced inside his chest.
After a tough moment of silence, Harry stood up and opened the door. He stood there for a few seconds and Draco hoped he would turn around, make him talk, kiss him, fuck him, throw punches,
Draco cried out in pain, his back heaving with sobs. Yet he was arching his hips upward to meet Sirius on every painful thrust.
But the Malfoys were traditional purebloods, with no interest in Muggle history unless it intertwined with wizarding history. Harry had seen Malfoy working on Muggle Studies essays over the past few weeks, but he supposed he was still unused to Muggle historical figures like that.
Her fingers fill him up so well, thrusting slowly inside of him. With her other hand she turned on the vibrator and rubbed it gently against his cock. Harry moaned, surprised— it didn't matter how much she did this, it always caught him off guard how good it felt. He never knew sex could feel so good. He barely even masturbated before meeting Blaise.
Teddy whacked the side of James' fuzzy thigh with their open palm. One of the few times they would do so. They enjoyed savoring the skin on skin contact for after the scene, when they are holding each other close and it's become Teddy's duty to provide comfort. And James, in turn, would focus on decompressing and assuring Teddy of how much he enjoyed it. The hands were not to be used during the scene.
Weasley smirked, but Potter rolled his eyes. “I don’t want to reclaim anything, Malfoy. Madame Hooch is going to make us compete fairly for Seeker.”
He grins and thanks her graciously before making his way back to the table. Ron claps him on the back. The others cheer, but Dean looks a bit put off as he digs around in his pocket for the promised money.
With a pathetic groan, Draco's cock jerks and spurts all over Harry's calloused palm. He whines in sensitivity when Harry swivels his hips just so. Sighs when he feels the spreading warmth of his cum inside him.
The only piece of furniture in the entire room is a flat, wide object standing up. It's covered with a black curtain. Albus lifts it and then resists the urge to smack himself on the forehead.
Harry flushes. "Sorry about, er, that. I wanted to ask you for your number, honestly, without the bet."
Well, Draco could see the appeal. Especially since he would never get a chance with the one he's wanted for so long. (Since fifth year, as pathetic as that sounds.) Maybe that's what it all was; insecure partners who know their lover's minds are wandering so they believe changing into that other person will fix everything. Draco couldn't imagine it resulted in anything beneficial. But... he could definitely see why someone would want that.
. He'd always loved when Blaise read his body language. Especially when it came to sex. The idea of someone knowing him so intimately made him instantly hard. For the longest time, Harry was convinced nobody would ever want to be with him that way. He'd watched enough of Vernon's favorite shows and Petunia's tabloid shows to know that trans people were not desirable. Even though nobody at Hogwarts really knew he was trans, he didn't want to tempt fate by trying a relationship. (And there was the whole Voldemort, Savior of the Wizarding World thing going on.)
Harry smiles a little. "Treacle tarts, lake water, and broomstick polish. Not the most romantic combination."
Malfoy put his mug down on his bedside table and stretched his limbs. Harry tried not to stare, keeping his gaze focused solely on his face. His shirt lifted slightly to show a sliver of his pale stomach, but Harry didn’t notice that. He gulped thickly.
. But that isn't who he's going to get 20 quid for if he asks for their number. He steels himself and sits down next to the couple.
“I bet,” Harry whispered. He looked back on all of his memories of Draco. Always flanked by a posse, a spitting image of his father. Wondered how much of that he did because he was transgender. Harry couldn’t lie to himself; he really had no idea what the consisted of. But he was nothing if not determined and he really wanted this…. whatever they had to work out. “It’s getting pretty late.”
So immersed in his work after a short amount of time, he jumped when he felt a hand touch his shoulder. When he looked up, he was met with Harry’s dazzling smile. It wasn’t an expression seen often in the press; usually, he was far too irritated with the harassment to be happy, even fake-happy.
Draco pressed his hand against the dragonhide leather of his case. “I know. I’ve just heard it far too much from mother and Pansy. Did you know Goyle sent me a letter asking me to think this over?”
Potter looked at him intensely. “You seem a lot happier. I like how you look when you’re actually happy. You walk with more confidence than when you were that bratty eleven-year-old who thought you were the shit.”
Well, I was thinking more dub-con but the scene got away from me and ended up traumatizing Draco even more than dubiously. This is one of the darker fics so far. I have written non-con and dub-con scenes before, but this is my first published one. In other fics I've alluded to it or referenced it in detail, but I haven't actually published a whole scene of it before.
She was leaning forward, placing her hand on Harry's knee. Was this flirting now? Were they flirting over a box of sex toys? What was Harry's life? Harry felt his stomach twist in arousal.
So he cherished the moment. Sighed happily when the other teens finally came, coating his front with semen and leaving his insides warm and wet. Sirius didn't let go when Remus lay beside them, one arm over Sirius' back and rubbing soothing circles in his shoulders. He wanted this to last forever.
He looked downcast as he finished his speech. The way he spoke kind of reminded Harry of Hermione’s lectures. In another world, he thinks they could’ve been great friends. He imagined what it would be like if Muggle holidays, like Christmas, were being forgotten about. If people just decided not to celebrate it anymore, how those who did celebrate it would feel.
His face is flushed but maybe Charlie will think it's just the heat of the room. Or even the cold from outside.
But he wasn't a real victim. He was a disgusting pervert he liked to pretend to be a victim so he didn't have to face the fact that he loved getting fucked by Sirius.
“We’re wizards. We have water. I turned the water into hot chocolate.” He sneered at the liquid in the mug. “Doesn’t taste very good, too watery, but it’ll get the job done.”
The strength in his voice made the butterflies in Harry’s stomach flutter. He smiled a little. “It’s not as if you’ve ever needed my permission for anything,” he said softly, which drew a small exhale of mirth from Draco. “I don’t mind, though. I would still like to be with you if you still want me.”
Harry pushes down the duvet revealing his own pajama pants tented up. Ron's poor prick throbs again in want.
"Weasley," Draco responds. He isn't looking at the driver; he wants to test his memory. "Can't be Bill, he's a curse breaker in America. The twins have their joke shop. Ron is an Auror. He and Ginny have both married the loves of their lives."
"Fucking Pansy," the voice groans. "This isn't her. I was with her that night, though. My name is Draco. She gave you my number instead of her own."
It hadn't take long for the plant to rip off his pajamas and hold him up. Draco decided to explore outside the garden, with only his wand on him, against his mother's wishes. There were plenty of things his parents told him not to do, like no having chocolate after 8 pm, no kicking at the peacocks (no matter how much they chased him around), no jinxing the house-elves. All of which were rules for a reason, because he'd done them at least once before.
He couldn’t say he blamed them. Durmstrang didn’t get invaded by Death Eaters, and certainly not Ilvermony. (An American wizarding school. Harry didn’t think those even existed, but Hermione loved to prove him wrong. Apparently she had some sort of pen pal that summer from Ilvermony.)
In his mind, swirling around and making a home there: bronze skin, thick shoulders, dark hair covering his chest and stomach and arms and legs, wild and unkempt raven-black hair. Usually tied in a low ponytail those days. Draco's hand pulling at it, watching his head fly back and his thick neck stretch, exposed.
There were plenty of items that Harry thought he knew but found out were completely different in the magical sphere. Owls weren't just creepy little bastards who stared at you if you were out too late. They were the entire postal system. Chess wasn't simply a strategic logic game between friends, but an actual battlefield with chess pieces getting ruthlessly slaughtered. So why should sex toys be any different?
"Ugh, Gryffindors." She looked down at her ring finger. "Your father and I have had a few issues. I wasn't ready to have a child and we got into a huge row about it. Even told him I was leaving, divorcing. Moved out to live with my disowned sister. She always seemed to have an answer."
Harry flushed and looked down. “It wasn’t just me. He leaned in too…” He ignored Ron’s gagging noises. “I just don’t understand why he did it in the first place. What’s he trying to get? I had just given him back his wand.”
Weasley didn’t seem too put-off by his presence, which was a change he wasn’t expecting. Harry sat down beside him, but those two sat across from them. Granger mimicked his set up and got into her work quickly, as expected. She would be the brightest witch of her age if she didn’t study. Weasley was staring at him, though he didn’t look particularly judgemental.
His pajamas were less ripped than he thought they were, in his blind panic, but they were stained with green and brown from the grass and dirt. They were damp on his skin but he pulled them on. His underwear was not salvageable, but he didn't think anyone would really notice. He limped as he walked back to the garden.
Dean hummed, setting the book aside and holding Seamus' hands. "Hmm, let's make it gay. If you were the man—"
If only they could do this outside of a damp, dingy closet. Hermione feels she has had multiple opportunities to tell her friends, or Harry at the very least, but she can never work up the courage to express her thoughts. Draco Malfoy of all people already knows; Pansy said he caught her coming back to Slytherin common room after one of their midnight expeditions, coincidentally because he was coming back from a secret love affair with Harry. They promised not to reveal each other's secrets.
Potter cleared his throat. “Listen, Draco…. There are a few jerseys left. I know this probably greatly offends your sensibilities, but if you can manage the smell of sweat for the fifteen-minute walk back to our room…”
And... it was a little anticlimactic. Just a few dildos, a masturbation sleeve, different flavored lube, and some nipple clamps. There was a vibrator, so that answered his earlier questions. He didn't know what he was expecting. They were sex toys. Blaise said "sex toys" not "magical sex toys." He didn't know why he seemed disappointed.
Blaise stroked her cock a few times before meeting the tip to Harry's hole and pushing inside. The groan they simultaneously made should've been illegal, Harry decided. He was glad to know he wasn't the only one craving this. That was the only downside about not living together; they don't spend as much time together with their schedules so they forego sex in order just to hang out.
how to love her Nymphadora and that it was normal to fear not having a bond. Reminded me that it took experience and love to forge a bond like that of a parent and child. I think about that every day. I hope I didn't forget that."
that fic wasn't fully working for me so I made it a pre-established relationship instead of a getting-together fic. And I like it a lot more now. Enjoy reading!
Draco finally fixes his trousers and robes. He gingerly sits back down and leans most of his weight on Harry's shoulder. Closes his eyes and breathes in Harry's exceptional after-sex musk. Good for him that his hair's already a fucking Snidget's nest; his mates probably won't even be able to tell what business he got up to. Harry rests his head on top of Draco's. The sex is nice (really nice) but Draco likes this part of things. The cooling down. When Harry is at his least guarded, vulnerable, belly-up like a cat.
He climbed into the bath and pulled Draco on top of him, laughing as the water sloshed up the sides of the tub. Draco smiled and leaned in to Sirius' body even more. His eyes were red and puffy from the crying earlier. Sirius pushed a wet strand of hair off of his face.
"Er... can I?" Harry takes his mouth off him to ask. And Draco doesn't know quite what he's referring to until he feels his thumb swiping at his hole. There are tears in his eyes from how much he wants this. From how much he doesn't.
Ron was already close before Harry woke up, so it only takes a few strategic twists of Harry's wrist for him to come undone.
He closes his eyes as he dips his hand beneath the waistband. His fingers are cold in comparison to the heat in between his legs. Albus shudders when they reach their destination; he's already wet and aching for more.
The Room of Requirement has been used for emergency heat/rut rooms since the blockers were invented. Before those were around, it was just a full-time room for students to work through their heats or ruts. It was beneficial to have a room that can transform into whatever you require in that moment, especially because every omega and alpha had unique heats and ruts.
And he knew they didn’t mind that their best friend was dating a boy. If they did, they would have made it plenty clear by now. But Draco couldn’t help but wonder if they were surprised that he liked guys as well. He wondered how they would react if they knew he was transgender, not that he ever planned on telling them; it just wasn’t necessary information. They didn’t need to know anything about his bits, so to speak.
him. It was an incredible juxtaposition to the food services in the Wizarding World who would spit in his food if they found out they had to serve it to the likes of him.
He lies next to Harry. He feels better already. Sleeping in his own bed is grand and all, but Harry must've charmed his bed during their years to be so comfortable. Ron feels himself falling into the mattress, feels like he's being held by a cloud.
Not a bad older, either. Malfoy’s jaw had sharpened and he looked stronger. Despite all of the glares or grimaces he received from the students around him, there was an air of confidence surrounding him that made Harry’s stomach twist.
Harry can't smell anything else over the potion in front of him. It looks like a drink that would fit in at Madame Puddifoot's shop. He doesn't dare stir it, though his hand twitches. He itches his nose instead.
He found it disturbing how Hogwarts had a Muggle Studies class dedicated to teaching witches and wizards their traditions whilst a majority of students didn’t even know of the origins of their own holidays.
It was on their second child and Pansy and Luna's first, that Draco decided to bring up the topic to Harry. Harry was hoping they would have kids; he'd always wanted a big family like the Weasleys, but he was nervous to ask Draco about it. Thus began their attempts at having a child.
Regulus always used to give her in depth rants about whatever his idiot brother and his friends were doing that week. In letters and in person.
Hermione pokes one of her hands out of the cloak, while the other one opens the closet, and beckons Pansy closer. Pansy grins and walks delicately in the small room.
"Should I bind your body wholly, or just do what's necessary to keep you from interrupting?" James had a horrible habit of reaching down to touch himself while Teddy was busy teasing another part of him. "You tend to be rather squirmy, love."
. Draco thought he was so full of himself; Draco was his only employee, where did he get the authoritative stick up his arse? "How may I help you?"
Blaise dropped the box on the bed and sat down. Harry followed up, sitting cross-legged in front of her. He placed his anxious hands in his lap. His eyes widened when it was finally opened.
Pansy had said gleefully the first time she marked Hermione with blood-red kisses. That sentiment alone was enough for Hermione to insist they wash off before seeing their friends again.
after he mentioned never buying any. He tried desperately not to expect anything. But... his mind wandered.

"Wha—" Draco twists around as best he could to glare at Harry. "You called for help? Whatever happened to
Ron is sure his skin is bright red from the shy admittance. Harry dreams about him? Does he do this often? How many of those nightmares were really just sexy dreams? (They're all mostly nightmares, if Ron had to guess. He shouldn't get his hopes too high.)
For the past two years, ever since his rivalry with Harry Potter blossomed into a relationship, he's never been a bottom. He's just not into it. Draco doesn't care if anyone else bottoms (he actually finds it insanely hot when his alpha boyfriend opens himself up for him), penetration on his end just isn't fun.
It takes a few minutes for the Gryffindor to find Harry's invisibility cloak again. Then a few more minutes while Pansy admires the material up close. Then they simply hold each other close, fully dressed, and breathe in the other's scent before they are separated once more.
The room itself isn't as dark as it was when he fell asleep. It must be close to morning. Ron looks around at each of his friends' beds. (He's the only one who keeps his curtains closed— too many experiences being pranked by Fred and George to trust his roommates entirely.)
But Blaise only transitioned after Hogwarts. She'd been with loads of people by the time she got with Harry. She taught Harry a lot about feeling sexy and comfortable in front of a partner. He learned a lot. Like the fact that he adored dirty talk.
With great restraint, Blaise was able to hold in her laughter. "Really? Wizard sex isn't a whole lot different to Muggle sex."
Over time, they've carved out enough space to feel comfortable standing. They pushed all the cleaning supplies to one wall, with a few unlabeled bottles being held up precariously by broomsticks. It's a reminder not to go too far,
Draco was just thinking of putting his pajamas on and going to sleep. Usually, he’s the only one in their room when he changes. But now Potter would be right in the room. Anyone would find it odd that he avoids changing in front of other people, right? Potter would surely find it odd, anyhow.  It would become another reason for him to stalk him. Just to make sure he’s not hiding anything nefarious on his skin.
What a surprise it was to his mother and father when his face in the family portrait that hung in the main dining hall changed, some odd ten years ago. The long, wavy blond locks were cut like they had been sheared in the painting. And painting-Draco had ripped off his flowy, pale pink robes with all of its ruffles and lace to replace them with decidedly sophisticated, decidedly
A chorus of cheers interrupted their intimate moment. Looking into the kitchen from the door was a set of five heads, all smiling like lunatics. Ron was giving him a thumbs up and Blaise was smirking at Seamus' surprised expression. Understanding fell upon Harry.
Draco gasped as the smooth, hard vine wrapped around his stiff cock. He was hanging midair and he worried if he struggled the plant would just drop him twenty feet on the grass. It was hard to read a creature's next moves when the creature was a massive, hulking tangle of vines.
They could see the effect their words were having on him. Another full-body shiver like before, except that time James' toes curled and his hips flexed.
Anxiety clouded his mind when he thought of going back to the manor. How was he supposed to walk those halls, knowing of the stains of curses that took lives were embedded in the very floor and walls? How was he supposed to enter his bedroom, a childhood bedroom, that’s been raided and threatened and then treated like a crime scene? His mother may be willing to embrace the past, but he didn’t know if he could face that properly.
"Of course," Narcissa said with a smile. "She helped remind me why I loved him in the first place. Asked me why I was so nervous about becoming a mother. By that point, her daughter Nymphadora was already about seven years old.
She sat back on the bed and pushed his legs apart. He still squirmed a bit in embarrassment, but Blaise said she loved seeing how open and wet he got for her before she even touched him. Knowing she was genuinely attracted to him helped him move past the shame from exposing his intimate parts.
, not Hank— scowled at him. "Of course not. Don't be stupid." He flushed. "I knew you wouldn't talk to me if I just showed up at your shop and interrogated you. Someone in my department offered to give his image and Hermione recommended the name."
"Yes, Miss Granger," Professor Slughorn agrees with a gentle, if not slightly panicky, smile. "It can have some rather adverse effects on those who are particularly sensitive to some of the ingredients. It can provide a temporary high, hallucinations, and excessive thirst. Usually those symptoms fade after time away from the potion..."
He took the wand case from him, eyeing him suspiciously. When he opened it, finally, there was a shock within him that caused him to nearly lose control of the muscles in his hands and drop the box. His wand was laying on the soft, velvet walls of the wand case.
Changing out of his school robes and into playing robes was strange, to say the least. He had underestimated how sore his chest would be, even after so many weeks of rest, despite his Private Healer, mother, and closest friends warning him otherwise. The scars left were pretty clean, but a knot formed in his stomach when he imagined how his classmates would react. It would just be another target for them to try and bring him down with. Merlin, how would Potter react? Probably look up at him like a guilt-ridden puppy, mistaking the scars that saved Draco’s life as the ones he nearly killed him with. That would almost be
Then it hit all at once. A curious dream that ended with his pajama pants sticky and warm. Involving the resident cephalopod in the Hogwarts Lake rubbing its thick tentacles all over Draco's intimate bits. A detailed, yet ashamed, account of the dream in the hopes that he would analyze it at a later time and figure out why he was such a degenerate.
Hot shame flooded Zygmunt's cheeks. His lower lip trembled and he fucking hated it. The Headmaster nodded at the both of them then slipped by. No doubt to stuff his fat face with food in the kitchens. Tertius clapped his shoulder and air suddenly filled his lungs.
The walk back to the dorm room was… quiet, to say the least. Harry was walking next to Ron. He couldn’t keep his eyes off of the white-blond hair, so white that it practically glowed in the blackness of the night. After everyone was assigned a position Madame Hooch made them run through countless drills in an attempt to whip them back into shape after such a long break. It was a comfort to know she’d be treating the other house teams the same way, though.
"Should we take this into the bedroom?" He asked, in a voice that he hoped was more sultry than anxious.
"I don't know," Harry lied. Then he said, "I just thought the Wizarding World would have special sex toys. That's all."
"None of the prophecies said this would happen." Harry's smiling and there's blood in the corner of his mouth.
Yes, they made the right choice in not binding his whole body. In their satisfaction, Teddy felt their hair shifting, growing longer than before until it spilled over their shoulders. They adored having long hair during these scenes; James usually begs him to keep his hair long, says having it gives them a stunning aura. But in their line of work, wrestling injured dragons into rehabilitation programs, long hair was a downside.
Coming from a primary school in which Catholicism was just as important as maths, it was strange imagining a world in which people grow up not knowing who Jesus Christ is. Ron and his family had at least heard of him, but that was only due to Arthur Weasley’s love of Muggle traditions and objects. It’s why his family celebrates Christmas, Ron told him.
Harry had the grace to look ashamed of himself, at least. It was the least he could do while Draco was sitting on his bed, crying and regretting every word. This could be his only opportunity and there he was; self sabotaging like the coward he used to be and always will be. Why did he think this would be any different?
He bit his nails so far down they stung. It was a disgusting habit his poor mother tried to break him out of, but failed to keep up with when he finally when to school.
This one is short and sweet. Probably takes place in fifth year or something, before James officially got together with Lily. Sirius is a sappy little shit and I love him
"Since then I've been placed under every potion and spell known to man and interrogated by more Aurors than I've ever seen before. Is there a right way to feel about all this?"
The thought (combined with the tight heat of Draco's insides and the consistent whines, sobs, and moans he was able to draw out of the boy) was enough to bring Sirius to his climax. He let out a guttural groan. Pushed his dick in and out even after he came, trying to shove his seed as deep into his body as he possibly could.
Zygmunt sighed and placed the letter down. He stroked the owl's neck and smiled as she trilled. Whatever. He never liked being around people anyways.
"I was destined to die, many, many times," Harry reminds him. He's holding Draco's hands in tight fists and his hands are so cold. "I've risked my life to protect the entire Wizarding World. I will gladly risk it to give us the most precious thing in all the World. A life, Draco. A new life to cherish."
"Wow," Harry said in awe. "Did you go shopping recently? I'm fairly certain that wasn't in your closet last time I was over."
He hardly notices the way his eyes well up in tears and the droplets spill over his cheeks. Harry sniffs and nods. Hermione's staring at him imploringly from his right. Ron is rubbing his shoulder, squeezing it every so often. He leans into the casual touch.
Teddy let their arm drop to their side, admiring the work they've done. On James' previously unblemished skin were red, swollen marks. Perfectly where the jinx hit him. Some of them were intercepted by other strikes of jinx, making beautiful Xs.
, Harry wanted to be good. He felt hot and flushed from his head to his toes. Blaise removed her hand and sat up. She leaned over and grabbed something out of the box. A wand vibrator. Harry remembered she was tickled pink when she heard the name and impulsively bought the thing for 32 quid.
Harry's eyes are narrowed and Ron wonders if he can convince him this is just a sleepy hallucination. But then he opens his mouth.
Where he lost his wand, his mother stood. Still in her dressing gown with her bi-colored hair pinned up in rollers. Wearing the satin slippers Draco got her for her birthday last year. Holding his wand in her hand. Her expression was a mix of anger and concern.
Draco sighed against Sirius' neck, slumped over in his embrace, sleepy eyes admiring his cousin's face.
"That's quite enough!" She squawks from her spot on the wall. She hopes she's bot blushing, but it's normal for Blacks to go a brilliant crimson when they're embarrassed. All of her sisters and cousins were the same way, and her parents used to get all red when they had too much to drink. "Take this to your room!"
One of those people she knows is her son. A handsome young man now, not the chubby little toddler with a tendency to secretly lick her arm. (It wasn't the licking he liked, it was the tired, disgusted expression on her face from having baby saliva on her skin that made him laugh.) Draco uses his office a lot now. He works independently as a potioneer. Narcissa always hated his boss, his arrogance was staggering and she was shocked Draco put up with it for as long as he did.
is such a rare potion ingredient that we have been working with Potioneers to see if we can figure out a way to make werewolf hair work. This could really revolutionize the roles of werewolves in society and change how most non-lycanthropes see you."
Draco gasped and groaned when Sirius smacked his arse again. Much harder than the last time. There was a lasting red impression of Sirius' large hand. But he just wouldn't let up.
An olive branch, his mother had told him. She had made him promise not to bottle the experience up and leave it to rot in an unused cupboard. Extending an olive branch...
His sleepy eyes open at the sound of Charlie sitting on one of the opposing armchairs. He's lighting the fireplace. That's when Draco notices them and now he's wide awake.
Even just being around some of their friends with their new toddlers who had grabby hands, having long hair was unadvised.
Zygmunt was pacing the halls of Hogwarts. His robes swished all around him in a flurry that resembled his anxiety. The potion he had spent months refining was safely tucked away in a pouch tied around his waist. It was a warm spring afternoon and he was glad that he omitted his woolen jacket.
By the time that train of thought leaves, he realizes he took a wrong turn somewhere. He's in a corridor he's never seen before, with faded posters from classes long-gone. All of the doors are locked except one. With a thudding heart, Albus opens it, cringing at the creak of wood in the otherwise silent part of the castle.
He was drinking from his mug again, seemingly in thought. Those striking silver eyes were looking up over the rim of his drink. Then, he said, “My family has never celebrated Christmas. We usually celebrate Yule. Hogwarts was the first time I’ve ever seen any Christmas traditions.”
, Granger noticed. He met eyes with her and she smiled a little at him. Merlin, don’t tell him he was getting soft with the Gryffindors? The hostility, he hoped, was dying out but he didn’t know what to do with himself he felt entirely guilty about being even the slightest bit snarky with them.
Draco apparated them to his apartment building, stumbling a bit from anxiety and the fuzzy feeling in his head from some kind of Valpolicella. He couldn't remember what the server told them it was. Hank helped steady him and they made their way into Draco's apartment.
Her son and his boyfriend kiss while they greet each other. Harry grabs Draco's hands and twirl him around. He must have great news, in that case. Though, Harry is far more romantic than her husband was with her. Perhaps this is a normal couple's behavior?
to touch himself, which is stupid for a number of reasons. It makes him feel primitive being so needy for touch.
With every word, Draco obeyed. Weakly moving his hips, rutting against the old, solid arm of the sofa. It must be uncomfortable, but before long he groans and comes. Painting the seat cushion white. Sirius grabbed him by the air and pulled him away from the arm, shoving his face into the cushion.
Ron gave him a sympathetic face. “Sorry, mate. I suppose the real question isn’t why he’s doing it, but why did you do it? Do you want to kiss him again?”
The fireplace crackled and popped to his left. It provided a pleasant warmth that erased the wet chill in his bones from practicing and he felt himself unwinding bit by bit with every minute in the presence of the fire.  The bright flames licked the sides of the brick fireplace, dancing as erratically as the Weird Sisters. (Ginny tried getting him into their music, to no avail. He just didn’t understand wizarding music. “How is anyone supposed to dance to this?”)
The door to the room swung open and he felt himself stiffen up. He wasn’t facing the door, and he decided to keep it that way. Keep his head low, his mouth shut, and just focus on unpacking all of his clothing. His mother and Pansy went shopping in the main shopping center of Tinworth after his procedure, finding a new wardrobe of clothing that would fit properly. Not that his old clothes didn’t, but Draco misjudged the difference it made between having his chest flattened with clothing and having all of the unwanted flesh being transfigured off.
Draco coughed and stared down at his work. Harry rolled his eyes and countered, “We’re already together, Ron. I appreciate what you’re trying to do though.”
Pansy had no choice in the matter. She wants to be forgiven. She doesn't want to be remembered as someone who hurt others, who's a villain, a parasite to everyone around her. So Hermione decided to extend some compassion, something she is excellent at.
"Thank you! Okay, um." Papers rustle against each other. "I would just like you to confirm that you are a werewolf, born into a family of werewolves?"
Of course it was fucking Polyjuice Potion. He could recognize the signs of a person coming off the substance with his eyes closed. Better just to wait it out and face the music than to ignore what was happening and deny it.
“I’m not gonna leave you, Malfoy.” Did he say that out loud? “I don’t know what kind of person you think I am nowadays or why you kissed me, but you won’t be here alone.” Draco didn’t say anything. His chest felt tight. “Maybe I could ask a House Elf to get some extra clothes? Or a blanket to cover you with? I think there are—”
With a stroke of luck given to her by Sappho Herself, Hermione brushes her hand against a familiar silky fabric. It's like solid water in her palm. Transparent except for a subtle shine only apparent to those who are truly looking. Hermione smiles as her hand disappears beneath the cloak. Ecstatic that she found the rare magic, she whips it over herself and bounds out of the boys' dormitory. Sneaking out of such a place is far easier when invisible than sneaking in completely visible.
"I know how they see us. As if we're uncivilized beasts." Another pause. "Do you really think joining Potioneers can help our image?"
That Help Wanted sign had been unanswered for months. Help was wanted, it would keep Draco from juggling so many potions every day. Too bad Mr. Barnes was out of the country.
Warnings: light description of a corpse, underage mutual masturbation, not somnophilia but kinda veering on it I think?
And maybe, just maybe, it was those memories that triggered the visceral response he had when he saw the white-blond head of hair walk out of the kitchen and toward the eighth years’ table. He stood up from his seat, hands clutching the sides of the table, eyes not leaving the other boy (well, a man now). Hermione gasped and tugged at his sleeve urgently.
No response. Draco breathed out the tension in his body in a sigh of relief. He didn’t know what he would do if he heard Potter’s reasoning.
Harry sighed and sat on the corner of his desk, hanging his head low. It was truly a pathetic sight. Draco thought he'd feel good, powerful even, looking at a scene like this. But he just felt hurt and distant. And wanting. He wanted to close the distance. He needed to extend the olive branch.
Pansy's hair tickles her skin as she kisses and sucks on Hermione's skin. Her skilled hands reach around to unclasp it. Hermione holds her arms out so Pansy can shimmy the bra off, tossing it to hang over one of the broomsticks.
“We need to talk about being Seekers,” he said bluntly. At least this time Draco knew he wouldn’t try to surprise him with any strange Muggle references. He was still holding his Quidditch robes against his chest, subconsciously covering it. When he noticed this, he flushed and dropped his arms. No reason why he should be covering that. Not anymore, at least.
Harry wondered too. Usually Draco was the one men were infatuated with, so it was surprising to see him on the other end.
Eventually he raised his head. Looked again at Potter's face. A face he knew better than his own. His glasses were askew, so Draco reached up to set them correctly on his nose. He remembered breaking that nose ages ago; it's still a little crooked at the bottom.
"Fuck yeah, that's right." James squirmed a little, his hips swiveling in an attempt to get Teddy's knee to touch him where he was hard and aching.
Harry's head aches the next morning. The lipstick on his hand has smudged since then, but there is a new number on his phone with the contact name "Goth girl with the fruity drink."
He sighed deeply, removing his robes and then his jumper. His back was to Potter. If he could avoid contact, he would. Next came his shirt. There was a strange air of intimacy in the room that made his stomach constrict. What was so different about tonight? The silky-smooth fabric of his pajamas was comforting, and it calmed him down as he moved on to his trousers. Nobody in the past had any qualms about his crotch, because no boy his age would be caught dead staring at another boy’s crotch like that without being afraid of being labeled a creep. Or a poof.
A low sound from the back of Harry's throat leaves his mouth. It's unlike any of the other noises Ron's heard from him. He barely recognizes it as the long-forgotten language of Salazar Slytherin.
"Well, the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship is next weekend and I would like to ask for a special admittance." He spread out his hands placatingly, anticipating the answer. "I know, I know, the guidelines state that it's only for students sixteen and older, but you all know how advanced I am at potions, I'm practically the best student here and—"
He had similar broad shoulders. His ears stuck out a little more and his pseudo-military haircut made them stand out so much more. There was a blemish on that perfectly smooth, pale skin. But his hair was the same blackness. (Okay, maybe a little more brown than black, but it was curly and wild in a reminiscent way.)
It wasn’t as if he had any friends to hide behind this year. No Goyle or Blaise or Pansy to back him up. Sometimes, he would hear the sound of shoes clicking against the stone floor close behind and he would whip around, expecting to see his childhood friends, only to see students he didn’t know. Afterward, they would give him dirty looks or make scathing remarks about his appearance, family, name, status, and everything else under the sun they could think of. Which, in his honest opinion, wasn’t much; he felt he had more creative tactics when bullying Potter when he was eleven.
He also couldn’t deny the feeling of offense that filled his chest. Never would Malfoy forego an opportunity to antagonize him, especially not at the beginning of the year. Sure, Harry knew he had probably changed a tremendous amount over the summer, but the absence of that nostalgia hit him harder than he’d like to admit.
Its cries soften at the human contact. There's blood in its mouth from where its fangs punctured its forked tongue. Black sludge drips down its honey-blond hair.
Turns out, he didn't need to. Hank pulled away first. His lips were plumped and Draco had half a mind (okay, maybe a quarter of a mind) to feel embarrassed by how carried away they got. They were both panting hard.
Draco groaned but turned around to look. Potter wasn’t wearing a top. He scowled and focused on his face. “Yes, Potter?”
Harry grinned toothily. Something inside of him was bright and warm. Is that what reciprocation felt like? Wow, he could get used to that.
Then Harry rolled his eyes. So dramatic. They were all sitting at Luna's housewarming party. Their host was already snoozing, resting her head on Ginny Weasley's lap while the other woman carded her fingers through her curly blonde hair.
, he thought as another vine caressed his cheek. it picked up a few of his tears on the way. His eyes felt puffy from crying.
Harry collapsed onto his bed while Malfoy dug into his suitcase for clothing to change into. When he found his (presumably) silk pajamas, he went into their bathroom to change. For many long minutes, he waited for him to come out again. Which took longer than he expected.
When his hole was decently shiny with spit, Sirius pulled out his cock and pressed the head against the boy's entrance. As he forced it inside (he was tight, not stretched out with fingers or toys), he murmured, "This might hurt a bit, cousin."
"Oh, Budge," the Headmaster said, as if he were surprised to see him. "What seems to be the matter?"
, they watched in fascination as thick, blue cotton ropes swung outwards. The ropes twisted around James' wrists and forearms. Perfectly, his arms get pulled together and tied tightly.
"Wow, thank you for putting it so gently, Dean," Harry tells him. The table laughs at his blunt tone and he can't help but laugh along with them. It feels nice to laugh.
"Oh I'm just wondering where I can hide your suppressant pills next month," he muses, mostly to himself. Harry laughs.
," Teddy said at last. Their wand felt strong, solid, in their hand. The magic thrummed through surprisingly flexible sycamore wood and made contact with James' bare chest.
His knees felt weak but he refused to allow himself to fall. Draco gently grasped the hilt of the wand and it was a familiar weight in his hand. It sparked a bit near the tip and he gasped. Right. Better not let any accidental magic go in his excitement.
"Remarkable," Albus sighs. This feat of magic is great. Does it reflect whoever or whatever is on the mind of those who look upon it? Atop the actual mirror, on the frame, is an inscription:
Weasley gave him a wide grin and nodded slightly. Being Granger’s boyfriend, he’s probably the most aware out of any of them how much she values her books.
Draco snorts and leaves his suitcase near the door, gravitating towards the plush sofa. He buries himself among the blankets and sighs. They warm him up to his very core. He brings his knees up to get them underneath the blanket as well. Draco could just curl up and fall asleep right then and there. He was exhausted.
Fuck, how is he supposed to look into Gellert's eyes tomorrow? Will he know what depraved things Albus did? He's incredibly perceptive when he wants to be.
The receptionist looked a bit shocked at his appearance and even more shocked at his request. And as he went into the back room to request Potter, a tall man caught his eye.
Draco closed his eyes. “Severus told me the name once when I was in third year. Where my body doesn’t feel right to me.” He opened his eyes, looking like he wanted to hit something, but not looking anywhere near Harry. “I’m transgender.”
Pansy removes herself from Hermione's shoulder and grins as they stare at each other's faces. "Sounds like a plan, Granger danger."
“You take Arithmancy too?” Granger asked, leaning over the table to check out his essay. Weasley groaned as she handed his half-proofread essay back to him to deal with.
"Hard to avoid," she said, glaring back at him. "I'm a bit stuck here and it's not as if anybody thought to paint a pair of earmuffs with me."
Self-hatred wasn’t fitting of a Malfoy, but cowardice was. He had half a mind to just ignore Potter and pretend to be focused on going to sleep. But that wouldn’t work forever. Eventually, Draco would have to make some sort of verbal contact with him.
Draco lifted his head to look at him. Now he was curious. Obviously, he was pleased that his private healer’s human transfiguration showed. He’d been previously insecure that it would be too pronounced, but Blaise and Pansy assured him it was a subtle enough change. “Hm?”
Malfoy's been quiet as ever. Despite the one-sided fighting from the train before term started, there hasn't been half as much antagonism as usual. There isn't any rhyme and reason for that kind of drastic change in behavior.
Her son writes letters diligently, tying them to the necks of potion bottles, wraps them up in a parcel, and then sends them off by owl to the customer. Over and over he does this. Or he works at his potions set making the products.
much better when it’s handmade, like this. Transfiguring water into a different drink will never be as good. Potter took a few moments before drinking from his own mug.
"Well, go on," he taunted. "Rut against the sofa. Defile it with your bodily fluids. Show the couch just how much you love having your poor arsehole sting after getting raped."
Draco heaves a heavy sigh. In the distance, Harry can hear a door opening and multiple footsteps rushing through the house.
Zygmunt imagined, just to himself, the rest of the letter being a love confession. He dismissed the idea out of his head and kept reading.
during their trysts. Hermione believes it's because she's always so cold that she likes to leech from Hermione's warmth whenever she can. Pansy always smiles when she tells her this, stating that she can neither confirm nor deny those accusations.
"I think we're getting this whole 'dueling' business wrong," Dean admitted as Seamus hummed a ballroom song for them to sway to.
Draco huffed and stuffed another folded shirt into his suitcase. They were in Draco’s room in the temporary house he and his mother were living in while the Aurors cleared out their manor of Dark Magic and other souvenirs the Death Eaters may have left behind. It was an alright little house, right in the middle of two other houses in Tinworth. Living there, among Muggles, wouldn’t be quite that bad, Draco’s come to know, if it weren’t for those damn Cornwallish Pixies.
In no time at all, the pair were sitting in an examination room with Draco's family healer. Healer Taylor was frowning at the results of the comprehensive health scan he had just cast on Harry.
Harry went into labour just before midday on Yule. It was a mess of fear and pain and worry as Healer Taylor was called in to help with the birth. There was less drama than with Astoria, their child cut free from Harry’s body easily. Draco could not look away from Harry’s shining green eyes through the whole thing. It felt like Harry was reassuring him with his tight grip, rather than the other way around.
Harry trailed off, looking away, shifting awkwardly here he was straddling Draco’s hips. Draco could only think of one thing to do, so he reached out, wrapping a hand around the back of Harry’s neck to pull him down and into a searing kiss. Harry gasped and moaned, Draco taking advantage to plunge his tongue into Harry’s mouth.
Draco, slid his fingers down Harry’s arse as they kissed frantically, moaning loudly when he found the man already prepared and waiting for him. He gasped when Harry batted his hands away, grasping Draco’s cock and pressing the head to his entrance. His breath stuttered and stilled as Harry sat back slowly, sinking down until Draco was fully encased in the other man’s body.
They were shown to the room and Minerva left, granting them a modicum of privacy. Draco was astonished that neither Cassie nor Scorp actively blamed him like he did his father.  He guessed the difference was that Lucius refused to believe the curse and married the woman he loved, while he didn’t. He had grown to love Astoria, very much, but he had thought she was safe without the romantic aspect of love.
Draco wasn’t sure how long he cried, all of the pain and frustration pouring out of him. Eventually, his hiccups eased and he just rested in the arms of his beloved, calm and centred for the first time in a long time.
He felt terrible for leaving Harry alone so often, but the other man didn’t seem to mind. He seemed to understand Draco’s struggle. There was little he could do to help though. Draco did make sure he was dutifully available for every healers’ appointment; he had done the same for Astoria. He would not do any less for Harry no matter how much of a mistake he thought it was to keep the baby.
“I heard the deathwatch beetle ticking for her. I refused to believe the silly old story, but I was wrong! She was out riding and the horse must have spooked, she fell and hit her head…”
He had to laugh when Chris cut in and dragged the drunken man to a pole that had been set up in the corner at some point after all the stuffy oldies left. Draco was relieved, and disappointed, with the reprieve from the other man's intense attention. Potter had been considerate as a leader and pliant as a follower. The contrast was overwhelming, how easily Potter switched, shaping himself to the moment, the mood, the music. He had been willing to be whatever Draco needed and it was overwhelming to find someone who fit so easily around him.
“Dad? It’s time for us to pick Scorpius up from Kings Cross. Daddy come on. Out of bed sleepyhead!” Cassie crawled onto his bed, poking his cheek.
“Would you like some help with the plants? I am a bit of a green thumb.” Harry offered, making no move to get up, Draco nodded his head where it was resting against Harry’s shoulder.
He was sitting down to dinner when his father strode into the hall. He was as immaculately dressed as ever, but Draco immediately knew that something was wrong. While his hair had been tried back neatly, it was dirty. There were dark smudges under his fathers eyes, and a sallowness to his skin.
“Alright, I have some excellent readings from you. I am going to have to do some research to find the best way to resolve this. I will send you an owl once I have a solution. Please be patient, these things can take time but I can assure you, I will find you a solution so neither you, nor your children have to deal with this again.” Hallet extended his hand and Draco shook it gratefully before leaving to collect his kids from Harry’s place.
“Yuri,” Draco found himself commenting to his protégé as they departed the rink after the medal ceremony for the Sochi Grand Prix Final. “about the free performance, you did well but your step sequence could do with some work.”
Occasionally Draco would have to interact with Potter in a public setting. They had been cordial since the end of the war and while he had grown to harbour a secret flame for the other man, he would never consider taking it further. It wasn’t worth the risk.
"Congratulations again, come back and see me in a month once the shock wears off and you've had a chance to read through the papers I send over." She laughed good-naturedly before urging them out the door.
It was just after the snow had melted in the new year, Harry had come over to help him locate a glade that could be used for the ritual. It was still cold out, so they were bundled up, wandering through the manor grounds and the forest that wrapped around the edge. They had found a few different spots they could use, but none had called to him as yet.
Draco could only blink, astonished that the Potters, who had such a tendency for irrationality and chaos, were being so sensible. It made him want to scream.
The funeral passed in a blur. Albus was granted dispensation to attend to support Scorpius. On one hand, he was grateful his son had such a good friend, on the other, he could see that the beginning blossoms of romance were there as well. Scorpius was very much his son apparently.
Suddenly Healer Taylor moved into his field of vision, a swaddled bundle in her arms. Harry’s eyes snapped towards it, accepting the bundle gently.
Rather than wasting his time trying to find the blasted deathwatch beetle, he scrambled from his office, frantically calling for Astoria. He was horrified, when he was too late. She had fallen down the main staircase, her blonde hair splayed out on the marble tile. A growing pool of blood under her head where it had landed oddly on the bottom step.
“I’m sorry Cassie,” Harry turned to her, “I’ll replace the pot. Perhaps you and Lily can finish up in her room?”
“Of course,” Hallet extracted a piece of parchment from the stack, “I would like to do the ritual at your home, where the family magic is thick and deeply embedded in the earth. Just before dawn, I would have the three of you lying down within a circle of cleansing flame, your heads in the centre and your bodies making the spokes of a wheel. You will be dressed in robes of simple white linen, for purity, with crowns of spring blooms, preferably daffodils, primrose, flowering red currant, star magnolia and Rhododendron. If you have any grown on your property this would be preferred.”
Harry shot him another worried look, wiping his dirty hands on his filthy pants before grimacing. Extracting his wand, Harry cast a cleaning charm on himself, banishing the abundance of soil clinging to his person, before moving inside.
He was swept up in their chattering enthusiasm. Draco was astonished at how quickly children tended to recover. Then again, they weren’t dealing with self-blame and recrimination.
Draco had never seen his father so distressed. Nothing touched his heart though, he felt dead inside. His beloved mother was dead, dead because of a family curse his father refused to believe in.
His father died during his fifth year, at the Department of Mysteries. He was practically kidnapped by his aunt and forced into service to the monster that had taken over his home. Everything was tainted with the Dark Lord’s touch and he had no escape, no reprieve.
Draco’s head was spinning, another six months. Six months before he could… He forcefully stopped the train of thought. If six months was what it took, then it would be what it took.
James seemed to be the only one who shared his worries. They didn’t speak about it, there was nothing to say really. Harry was adamant that the curse was broken and the baby he bore was a blessing.
Rocking gently, Harry began riding Draco, his own cock jutting out and dripping. Harry arched, head thrown back so that the sunlight streamed over him, turning him into a wood nymph, come to steal Draco away. His breath caught at the perfection of the man over him. This was everything he had hoped for, had dreamed of, and so much more.
Stumbling down the stairs, Draco collapsed next to her, frantically checking for a pulse, knowing already that the efforts would be wasted.
Daffodil for rebirth, new beginnings and eternal life. They would need lots to bring joy and happiness, what they hoped to find after the curse had been lifted, what they felt would counter the heartbreak that caused the curse to begin with.
Harry moved over to him, cupping his cheek once more, expression soft and understanding. “The curse only seems to take effect after they marry and have a child. Somehow, I don’t think we need to worry for a good long while with Scorpius. He knows about the curse and he wont risk Albus until it is broken. We have time.”
“I don’t mind if I have to experience pain, as long as my kids don’t, I will bare anything.” Draco reassured him.
He was swallowed once more by the image of who he had been crafted to be, only occasionally letting what little he had left of himself out. When he skated, he could feel, but this year it wasn’t working. Next, he tried to find himself in sex. In past years it had helped, but it didn’t seem to help now either. The act was empty of affection or truth. There was only release but he was so void of everything that the act felt pointless.
He looked at her, her eyes pained. Their relationship had improved following the war, he was on the Board of Governors and had devoted time and money not just to the rectification of Hogwarts, but also to improving the school and its facilities over the years.
He finished the routine, his final pose perfectly striking. It showed off the long lines of his body and his sculpted muscles. His silvery hair slid back from his face, revealing his profile in all of its elegant glory. It had been immaculate, of course, his performances were never anything less. The sound of applause washed over him like the ocean at his mothers’ favourite beach. The soft susurrations fading into the background as he realised how empty he felt.
He lurched up, darting after her as she ran, room by room around the manor. Eventually, she collapsed, sobbing in the main sitting room.  Draco approached cautiously, reaching out a trembling hand to stroke her hair as she cried. Eventually her sobs eased and she peered up at him.
“The kids think it is great, so once I left Ginny, I stopped wearing the glamour around the house to appease her. It’s been so long though, and the uproar that would be created by me dropping it in public is something I don’t really want to deal with. So, my few friends know the truth, but every time I step foot outside I put the glamour up to hide it.” Harry shrugged.
Harry’s expression softened and he reached out to card a hand through Draco’s hair. “The curse broke, we both felt it. I will not die, my love. Magic blessed us with a child, why would she take away our joy?”
“It will take as long as it needs to, you know how magic can be Draco.” Harry reassured as he pulled on a fresh shirt.
His heart stuttered painfully at Harry standing by the stove top, flipping pancakes in the air to the applause of the kids. Harry looked up to where he was hovering in the doorway and grinned. Draco’s stomach clenched. Harry looked different to how he normally did. The lightning bolt scar now stretched down and over his eye, causing it to turn an electric blue, the other still a rich green.
“For more than 1,000 years, the Malfoys have been blamed for darkness and trouble. It is in the name after all.” He repeated the words that his mother had told him so very long ago. “It began with your ancestor, Maria. She fell in love with a muggle, and when she was found out by the local villagers to be an unwed, pregnant witch, she was banished to a lonely island off the coast of France.”
He found it appealing, how rumpled and flushed Potter was, his clothes in a disarray, his wild black hair mussed, cheeks stained a pretty pink from the alcohol and exertion. He was so different under the influence, his personality bright and free rather than the painfully shy man that he had seen hiding in corners all throughout the Grand Prix Final. Many seemed to think that Potter was arrogant or aloof, but Draco didn’t think that was the case. His skating told a different story.
He did tell her about the family curse, but assured her that while he might grown to feel affection for her, as she was a woman he would never be
Somehow he found himself drawn into a conversation on the technical points of the difference between a toe loop and a flip with some idiotic hanger-on who had no idea who he was. It would have been refreshing if it wasn’t so terribly irritating to have to explain it to someone who obviously didn’t care.
“Alright, we are done here for now. Let us go to the greenhouses and see about these flowers. Just don’t disturb the circle as you step out.”
The man's expression was hazy yet determined as he yanked the god awful tie from his neck and stalked over to Yuri. They couldn't hear the conversation, the music was a little too loud and a little too upbeat now that all the older attendees had left. It was an unspoken agreement that all of the young skaters would show up for the schmoozing and dinner, provided that the older people would leave them to their after party. The skaters worked hard and had limited opportunities for downtime. The competition was over, the medals handed out and tomorrow they would all be returning to their home rinks to prepare for the next competition. But for tonight, they were free.
“Draco, thank you for meeting with me. I am sorry it took me so long to find a solution, but wish magic can be tricky.” Hallet explained.
After a restless night, he dragged himself from bed, gathering up a listless Cassie and enlisting the elves help to have her dressed and ready to go.
Harry’s distressed voice yanked him from his reverie, and he froze, staring into wide blue and green eyes. He couldn’t help but glance down, Harry’s lips perfect and pink, a light stubble shadowing his jaw line. Draco desperately wanted to kiss the other man with a passion he had never wanted anything before.
She knew she did not have much longer, Draco would be going to Hogwarts soon and the curse would drag her down. She and Lucius had fallen in love, and because of that, because she had made Draco, she knew her time was drawing to a close.
He survived not murdering the Headmaster and the punishment that followed. He survived Potter turning up with his lackeys in his home and lying about their identities. He survived Potter dying, or not dying for that matter, in the forest and lying to the Dark Lord about it.
Yes. This could work. He was uninspired for the next year, using up his last good idea to create the routines for this season. Now, he needed something fresh, something new. Potter called to him, and he hoped to find a new angle for next year. Inspiration could come from unexpected sources and this was definitely unexpected. He only hoped he remembered all this in the morning with the hangover he was likely to have.
The months passed slowly as Harry swelled with their child. Lily was the most excited of their children, sharing Harry’s conviction that the curse had been broken. With a little time, she had Cass convinced as well, the pair filling the Manor with their enthusiasm for a new sibling.
Draco’s father would murder him for wanting to take time off, but his mother might understand if he phrased it just right. He had some time to work it out still.
Albus and Scorpius were going into their fourth year and were utterly inseparable. Draco caught them sleeping in the same bed during the holidays but found he didn’t have the heart to rouse on them. Scorpius was wrapped so protectively around Albus that it almost broke his heart.
He strode into the school, taking the familiar route to the Great Hall. The hall was filled with students, chatting over breakfast. His eyes roamed over the hall, taking in McGonagall rising from the head table. As silence rippled out from him, like a pebble dropped in a pool, he spotted Scorpius lurching to his feet at the Slytherin table, Albus beside him.
Without realising what he was doing, Draco floo’ed to Harry’s place, stumbling out of the fire and collapsing into a chair and burying his face in his hands.
Horror immediately washed over him. He was not in love with Astoria, he had grown to love the courageous, clever woman, but there was no romance there. The curse was only supposed to affect romantic relationships.
Harry could feel his heart fill, the same joy and hope he found himself early was now only further amplified.  He felt his skin tingle, his magic bristling to burst forth. And with an exhale, the room was filled with bright, brilliant, blindly light.  Harry’s stag patronus galloping about in circles, clearly displaying Harry’s abundance of happiness.
The other two boys, the ones tormenting the younger Slytherin, had enough sense to stop what they were doing and look on in fear but they weren’t fast enough to get away from Harry. Who had grabbed the Gryffindor on the right and with a rather large amount of force, shoved him straight into the Gryffindor on the left, toppling them both over and down onto the floor.
Harry had wished Ginny all the happiness in the world and Ginny congratulated him on finding his, and they parted all the better.
“Mr. Davies, Mr. Taylor, and Mr. Wilson, you will report to my office immediately.” McGonagall leveled her gaze on Harry but he hadn’t flinched away like the three Gryffindors had.  “Mr. Potter, come join me when you and Mr. Malfoy have settled Mr. Prewett in with Madam Pompfrey.”
“Malfoy?” Harry startled, dropping the pair of trousers he had been holding. “I’m sorry about…” Harry faltered.
“Harry!” Luna’s voice carried over the noise.  In the span of a moment Harry spun on his heel and watched as the first Gryffindor, whose face was now covered in blood, stumbled up onto his feet and pulled out his wand, pointing it straight at Harry.  In the very same moment, the air seemed to rush out of the corridor entirely, and Harry’s hair whipped about his face wildly as bright orange and gold curls of pure magic spiraled off of his skin.
“Thank you, but I know why you did it and that was incredibly brave of you.” Harry whispered into the top of her head.  Everyone was kind enough to look away when Pansy began to cry into Harry’s shoulder.  He guided her down onto the sofa to sit with him all the while rubbing her back as she sniffled against him. As if it were a dam shattering, the Slytherins who had returned effortlessly melded into the fold.  Relationships were mended and past grievances were washed away.
Together they watched the stag strut about a bit longer until it took off, at full gallop, through the window.  Without further interruption, they returned back to more joy inducing activities.
“Not you too!” Harry threw his hands up and launched himself off the sofa before stomping up to his room.  If Hermione, or any of the others for that matter, were surprised with Draco’s spoken agreement with Hermione, Harry hadn’t noticed.
Harry stood in front of Walburga’s portrait as she screamed and screamed.  Harry had been trying to loosen the permanent sticking charms for nearly two hours but nothing was working.
The bear and phoenix continued to circle Harry’s room, causing flames to flicker and snap all around them but the bed was so far untouched.
“Yeah.” Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. “I locked myself away and let all the pent up…. err magic…..out. Nearly destroyed the house.” Harry shrugged.
“Come on, it's nearly Christmas and it smells like Molly’s cooked a feast!” Harry said happily, and together the three of them made their way to the kitchen.
Harry slowly clawed his way back into consciousness, his body protesting entirely against any movement while his mind shouted at him to get up.  Shouted at him that Draco was in danger.
In that moment several things occurred to Harry. The first being that there were Death Eaters still out there, the second that there was a very real chance some may still come for him. The third was that that meant Draco would be in danger but Harry was certain he’d be in more danger of Draco
“You’ve grown into a fine man, Mr. Potter.” She spoke as she pulled away and held him at arm's length, looking down onto him past her spectacle lenses. “Your parents,” She began. “And Albus would be proud.” Harry thanked her and left her office quietly, glancing quickly at Dumbledore’s portrait.  Even Snape was looking down on him with softened features.
Hours later, saw Harry in a bed a St. Mungo, against his protests. His ribs were on the mend and his headache from his concussion was receding thanks to the lovely mediwitch that had brought him his potions.
Luna was the only one not originally in their year who had joined them on their return and the Headmistress had no mind to argue with the group, that she should be with her own year and not with them.  Instead she was simply absorbed into the class of already very few returnees.
.” The bits of plaster and wallpaper, signed rug, and even Walburga’s portrait vanished without further thought. Harry simply brushed his hands off and headed for the kitchen, he was famished and thought maybe he’d cook himself some pasta puttanesca.
“Remember last year when I snapped and went after that kid that attacked that second year?” Harry asked.  Ron and Hermione just looked at him expectantly. “Well I don’t think Draco handled seeing me unconscious on the floor at Dolohov’s feet very well.  Or well I suppose he did, it’s really all about perspective.”
In an instant Harry’s wand was discarded, clattering along the stone floor, unheard, as the sound of Harry’s fist connecting with the closest Gryffindor dominated over all other noise in the corridor.  The boy fell to the floor at Harry’s feet and Harry pulled Pansy away from him, pushing her away from the scene altogether, hardly noticing that she landed in Blaise’s arms while Hermione and Ron both shouted at him.
Then the morning he was to arrive at The Burrow, he woke up and let himself heal.  He let himself feel all the happiness he could.  He replayed his most cherished memories in his mind, even the bittersweet ones.  He thought of his friends who stood with him through the worst of it all, he thought of all the lives he saved, he thought of the hope that had blossomed within Hogwarts when the students returned, and then like a crashing wave he let himself cry his pain away, replacing it with joy and hope. Hope, oddly enough, had come to him in the form of a pair of silver eyes. Harry let his magic wrap around the house to transform and transfigure it.  He imagined what his life to come could be like, the happiness he could live in.  Harry let himself revel in the magic he realized he had never really had time to appreciate and experience.  He watched as walls rebuilt themselves, clean and light-colored.  He watched as the dingy corners began to lighten and the dark, angry magic faded away.  He let his magic stitch back together the furniture, most of which had been recreated in the likeness of his favorite sofas and armchairs found in the common rooms at Hogwarts.  And with the same ferocity with which he destroyed the house, he let his magic rebuild his house, his home, and himself.
In fact, he did. He really did, but today was not the day to deal with it. His morning was already so ruined, exploded into shrapnel that had already pierced his mind and heart. He didn’t need this conversation now. Not today.
Harry put down the rest of his cards, pausing the game. “That is what happened. I was at work, and I got hit by a lot of bad spells. So now I just have to remember.”
Harry clenched his eyes shut, trying so hard to remember something. Anything. Please. But nothing came but the history the two shared in Hogwarts. Nothing but the cold communication during his trials. Nothing but snide remarks and petty fighting in 8th year. Nothing. Nothing that could somehow twist into affection for Malfoy.
They spoke at the same time, and cut off at the same time. The sides of Harry’s lips twitched upwards.
Hours were spent in silence. Even the frames didn’t dare knock into one another. Everything was so fragile, from Harry’s heart to the quiet of the house.
So when he stepped into his house and read the letter Malfoy had left him, telling him he went to sleep early, Harry knew he’d still stick with his plan. It had given him something to do, a way forward, even if the path was filled with shards of glass.
So he bought a camera, a muggle one. Extremely expensive Harry guessed with the amount of details Blaise gave about it. He began to dabble in photography. He took opportunities to take photos of his co-workers who modelled with him.
A snort of laughter left his mouth. Isolt nipped gently at his hands. He told her he wasn’t going to write a reply, and that she should go home, that he’ll be there soon.
Soon enough, Harry’s spoon was scraping against the plate, trying to get as much as he could from the amazing meal. When he finally put his spoon and fork down, Malfoy smirked at him.
Harry was touched by that. “Can’t imagine any other professor getting that role. Look at you, Herbology professor AND head of Gryffindor.” He was immensely proud of Neville. “So, how’s Nott and Goyle? I heard you’re dating them?”
He cried after finally putting that picture frame down. It wasn’t a calm teary eyed cry, no. It was heart wrenching sobs and the biting of his clenched fist as he tried to be quiet even though he wanted to scream. It was his free hand rubbing circles over his aching chest in a vain attempt to soothe the pain.
Harry wiped away the tears on his cheek and nodded. He felt better, the pep talk really helped. He was so glad to vent it all out too, all his worries and fears this far into the recovery. His physical body was fine now, it was just his mind left.
Malfoy grabbed one of the noodle cups and walked out into the dining room. Harry followed, carrying his own.
“No, Ron, I distinctly remember it was both.” Blaise Zabini’s deep voice rang through as he brushed the soot off his clothes and walked towards Neville.
Hermione was Minister of Magic, he knew, and at least he could remember. She was great. She passed law after law that brought the people together. She had a ban on sleeping draughts after the war as people started getting addicted, and the healthcare was more welcoming. Healers got more patients, people got better. She lifted the ban, and nothing went terribly wrong.
“I read about it while in this study group I had with other 7th years. They were talking about the great potioneers of the wizarding world, and I just... “ She slowed to a stop. “Got inspired I guess.”
Harry learnt that Luna wasn’t working with creatures anymore, she was looking into wandmaking after a dream she had about Mr Ollivander. She was working under him, learning about the different cores to the woods, from lengths to designs. She found she loved it a lot more than the creatures, though a part of that would always be in her heart. She still edited for the Quibbler one the side, but more people had come to them for a job, so she wasn’t needed as intensely as before. Her father’s quite ecstatic about it.
In silence, they turned and walked to the back. He quickly put their food in the space under the counter for Malfoy to have when he’s free. Harry looked back once to find Malfoy, but found him only being swarmed by more customers.
Malfoy slowly sat up, blinking him slowly awake in a way Harry had only seen once before when he woke up from St Mungo’s. “I was waiting for you,” Malfoy yawned. “Wanted to make sure you were okay when you got back.”
Hermione clears her throat. "It's Amortentia, Harry," she says. "The most powerful love potion ever brewed."
His fingers are so long and thin. Harry admires them for a moment. He wonders what lies beyond his wrist, etched into his forearm. The thought isn't pleasant. He swallows around the ache in his throat at those thoughts.
Sirius removed his clothing first, took his hair out of its ponytail, and helped Draco out of the clothes left on his body. There was already a bruise forming on his thin wrists and chin. Not to mention the pink-purple color on his arse cheeks. Sirius made a mental note to perform a healing spell on him because of the blood from earlier. He must have torn a bit.
So he gave in. And Harry set up a time where they could meet each other without it being too awkward. Which, they decided, would be a group study session. They would come out and hopefully, everyone would be too busy with homework to chase him out of the library.
Malfoy always slept early and woke early. Every time Harry went in to go to sleep, he was already cocooned in the duvet, his body still as can be. And by the time he woke up for breakfast, he was gone. The only evidence that he was in the room was the smell of his distinct posh shampoo permeating their shared bathroom.
Then, a smile spreads across her green lips. It isn't the most assuring smile, but he now has some hope. Without speaking a word, she takes out her lipstick (one of the ones with the little wand) and, with a very steady hand, writes a phone number on his hand. It's in a delicate script. Harry has to twist his hand in an unnatural way for him to see it, but it's there.
He heard the door creak closed, but his roommate didn’t walk any closer. Draco couldn’t help but feel judged.
"Well?" Charlie is already out the door, leaning down so his head is visible. Strands of red hair fall into his face, fueling Draco's imagination far more than it should. "Are you coming?"
He leaves his socks and underwear all around his bed. And his bed is closest to their shared restroom, so Ron tends to trip on the way when he goes to piss in the middle of the night. He has crude humor, sometimes making blunt, dark jokes when Ron's least expecting it. The worst time this has happened was during lunch and Ron laughed so hard milk spewed out of his nose. But the biggest difference between the Harry Ron thought he was going to meet versus the one he actually ended up meeting was that Harry is so brave yet quiet. Quiet bravery is a good way to describe him.
He looked at the mess and was met with all types of notes about potions. For a brief moment, he thought of Kiana and hoped she was okay. Then he changed his focus solely on Malfoy beside him, ignoring Harry’s presence and staring at the notes.
His eyes continued to browse the room, taking note of muggle lamps. For a house that has been lived in for years by two people, it seemed like it was missing something. Bits and pieces of things were here and there, a stack of wooden dragons on one table, a discarded coat, but it stillfelt bare.
Pansy and Blaise would be inside anytime soon, and free to talk to while Malfoy handled his customers. It was a perfect time. He’d finally be able to relish the success of his pretending.
Just as Harry entered, McGonagall’s owl came swooping in and landed on the table. Malfoy looked at it with wide eyes.
After Harry got his food, Malfoy got his. It was just as silent as the dinner was last night, but it wasn’t tense or uncomfortable. Harry recognised that Malfoy seemed worn out. The kind of worn out that comes after a hard day at work. Harry himself was starting to feel it.
The conversation ended quickly after that. Ginny and Luna were talking to each other now, and everyone else had started going back to their respective conversations. Then he watched as Zabini fist-bumped Neville and walked over to Malfoy talking to George.
“I can’t eat with you today, I’m late!” Harry called, grabbing an apple from the fruit bowl they started recently.
Harry almost shook his head. No, of course he didn’t. Work was all he knew these days. It was just that case. But if that was so, why couldn’t he tell her that?
He quickly went to work, Isolt perched on the window, watching Harry. First, he moved the desk to his liking. He grabbed all of the journals and diaries, all of that writing that was purely personal, and promptly
Harry nodded. He could see that. It’s a better idea than having the kids demonstrate when they themselves were practicing simple stuff. But something still irked him.
Harry pet him, ran his fingers through his feathers, and cried silently. With hushed whispers he apologised to Hace. He told them that he wasn’t sure if Harry was going to come back any time soon, that the Harry from back then still loved him even if he wasn’t here right now. Harry knew he was mourning the death of a person who wasn’t really dead, but he might as well be.
Tina was a good healer, Harry decided. She didn’t give anything away from her face and didn’t treat him differently.
“Yeah, you’ve both drunk so much firewhiskey, I’m surprised you’re able to think properly.” Goyle retorted.
He wanted to vomit when she added on, “I just found something new 4 days ago. It’s slow, but if I’m right…” She trailed off into a sip of her coffee before she disappeared.
Just as those words hit her, Harry realised the strength of his words. How it could be used against him when someone finds out about his plans, his actions to forcefully bring back the old Harry that had everything.
Harry didn’t realise he missed her this badly until he had engulfed her in a big hug. Minerva had aged the way one would expect in 5 years, but she still held that youthful strength and passion she’s had since the first day he met her all those years ago. She had a strong sense of authority, fair and just.
Not wanting to know any bit of that conversation, Harry stepped away until his back pressed up against the opposite wall.He waited patiently, for their meeting to be finished. No one paid him any mind as they whizzed back and forth in urgency.
“Well, considering your situation, I thought you might like to see a new addition to the school 3 years ago.”
“You’re so lucky the wedding cake wasn’t on that table.” Hermione piped in, smirking at Ron’s astonished face.
“Huh? Oh, yeah, they’re okay. They’ll get better soon.” The smile was back on her face, better than ever. “Besides, I got to see 3 out of my 4 favourite customers again after, like what, 10 years?”
Malfoy noticed, and conjured a glass and cast a simple augementi. He offered the glass to Harry, who took it gratefully. He nodded his thanks.
A thought came into his head, and he asked the question before he realised it. “How do you two handle a relationship with your high role jobs?”
There were still the journals and diaries in his office to read through, folders too, but he assumed most of them were work related. Then there would also be newspaper articles. He groaned at the thought, both annoyed and elated with the fact his life would continue to be documented for the public to see.
“You haven’t really been here, have you? It’s like 5th year all over again where you cut us off, shut us out.” Hermione said.
He turned and saw some of the third years from the Care of Magical Creatures class along with other house students looking up at him with curious eyes.
Harry just nodded in the hug, unable to speak with the lump in his throat. The back of his eyes hurt, but he didn’t cry. They stayed hugging for a while.
Then he heard a soft hoot from on top of him. Then he started to notice the feel of talons on his head. Isolt was on his head. Huh.
But Harry's had enough. There’s been too much today. In fact, it’s been pretty loaded this past month since he woke up. No memories have resurfaced, nothing is making any sort of sense, the two people who he does know a little are not here, and Draco bloody Malfoy’s hand is blocking his access to physical reminders of anything that’s happened the past 5 years.
“I just don’t like that idea,” Harry started, building up the courage to say his fears. “The memories aren’t mine. They’re someone else’s. Things are fuzzy when people don’t remember specific details.”
His mind began to dig a hole to fall into. It stopped almost as soon as it had start when Isolt bit the hand that held the letter. He glared at Isolt as he opened it.
Harry didn’t even notice the fact that Malfoy had stopped shuffling, finally approving of the combination of papers surrounding each other, until Malfoy got up. Curiosity got the better of him, and he looked at the array of knowledge.
He whipped his head back, determined to solve this damn case so he could be back there with them. Then it crumbled down into rubble as he remembered just how frustrating the case was.
At that point, Hermione and Ron looked like they already understood and were ready to apologise for not thinking, but Harry just continued.
He slowly stepped back from the window, allowing himself to indulge in the sight and breathe in the fresh air before turning around to face the task at hand. The wind must’ve been a lot stronger than he thought because it looked like a tornado had came through. The papers on his desk now scattered across the floor, several folders and books on the shelves had opened up. He rubbed his face and groaned.
Harry smiled, and took the letter off. Before he could start reading it, Isolt flew over to his desk and pecked at the corner of it. Harry realised he hadn’t checked the drawers yet. In one swift movement, he went to his desk and opened up the top drawer that Isolt seemed to be pecking at.
Time must have passed as he stood there with Isolt. Both were simply enjoying each other’s presence so much that Harry did not hear the floo roar at all. So when Malfoy walked in, coat in hand and leaning on the doorway. Neither Harry, nor Isolt noticed.
No. He’ll try and get some sort of memory first before visiting him. He wanted to know, to be, the person Teddy was laughing and smiling with in those photos.
“Will you be going to the duelling club session today, Mr Potter?” A third year Slytherin asked politely.
Still, Harry looked a little harder, observed a little more, when it came to Malfoy. His idea of pretending was a tricky one, and either way, he didn’t think he had the guts to play it on Malfoy just yet. Especially with how he said he still knew Harry. Malfoy would see right through it.
Harry didn’t realise he was smiling until he felt his cheek muscles burn. It was painful, but he couldn’t stop smiling. Just like how Malfoy couldn’t seem to stop laughing. Everything felt good at that moment.
Harry felt himself deflate. There was nothing he could do. He saw the unmoving face, the stubborn tone, and knew it would be a losing fight.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, then smiled at the note. Malfoy was a good friend, even if their current label was ‘???’ He was very glad to have him beside him.
A chorus of disappointed sighs rang through. Harry tried not to feel too bad, but the sadness on their faces was too much. He almost offered to teach before Minerva’s voice spoke up again.
“They won’t be my memories. They’re someone else’s memories in someone else’s eyes. I won’t take that, I need them to be mine.”
Healer Tina took a quick visit too. He was awake enough to hear that there was no physical damage with Harry, once again, before leaving. But soon fell back asleep.
She kept eye-level with him, and the pit that was forming in Harry’s gut became bigger. And as Tina told Harry what had happened to him, the pit grew so big he found himself falling into it.
Harry could just pretend to be the Harry from before. He didn’t need to feel jealous or insecure anymore, he could just keep it up like he never lost them. What’s that saying, ‘fake it ‘til you make it,’ right? So that’s what he’ll do. He won’t waste over the books and the newspapers anymore, those words won’t change.
He smiled and waved at them as he walked out the door. He passed by Malfoy and waved at him too. Malfoy’s smile was bright as he waved him off.
Harry turned to the side, and watched as a Ravenclaw student sat down a few feet away from him. Her mouth was moving at extraordinary speeds as she continued to mutter loudly. Harry didn’t catch any sentences, and barely caught the word, ‘Fluxweed.’
He didn’t know anything from the last five years, let alone what Draco Malfoy was thinking. There was so much stress and tension in his brain already from the day before, now add onto the events of today, he could feel himself slipping.
Teddy absolutely adored the voices Harry put on for all the characters. Despite him fidgeting, filled with energy, Teddy kept quiet and never commented or spoke as Harry read it. Harry was immensely proud of him for it, though he didn’t know why Teddy felt the need to hold back.
He told Malfoy of how he pretended. How it worked on people, how it made him feel like he had everything back again. He spoke of the intense jealousy he felt for himself, his old life, how he read his hard work and all of it was gone because of one mistake.
Harry looked up at Malfoy. His vision finally focused and cleared. He didn’t care that Malfoy didn’t seem fazed by the accidental magic. He was too angry for that.
“Yes, but I don’t think you would’ve noticed the cake at all with how quickly you put things into your mouth.” Malfoy added with a shake of his head,
It was peaceful, watching the movement of the room from a wall’s perspective. Everyone moved around, catching up and sharing stories they wanted to tell. There were a lot of people, and a lot of stories, but it just worked. It worked so well.
‘I must not tell lies,’ it said. The blood left Harry’s face, and he stared at it. Even with Isolt moving down, hooting softly, Harry didn’t take his eyes off of the words.
“It was a great night, either way. Oh, by the way, when mum and dad danced, it was one hell of a sight.” Ginny said.
When Harry finally stepped back, bowing once more as a goodbye, Hace bowed back just as low. Harry turned, and Tatus was there with a tilted head. It reminded him of Isolt, and her curious eyes.
There was a distant crash that sounded from the kitchen. Then it was the shelves shaking. The ground began to quake.
A chance! Harry grabbed it before it could get away. Somewhere deep inside, he knew Parkinson was scared and worried, waiting for some sort of sign that Harry would turn them away like he did in Hogwarts.
Harry pet Neville’s shoulder, and reached out for a handful of floo powder. Just before he could grab it though, Neville spoke with a firm voice.
Harry wasn’t in his right mind yet. He knew this because why else would Harry want to listen to Malfoy talk more than necessary?
“I’m alright, I guess. At least, much better than before. Thank you…” He trailed off, raising the final note in a question for her name.
The last time he saw Blaise was at the Burrow. That felt like years ago, but it couldn’t have been more than 3 months ago. This Blaise was different though… As if Parkinson’s personality molded his to something slightly different.
Harry’s jaw clenched, and his eyes glowed red for a single millisecond. But it was all masked quickly with a sad smile.
Mixed emotions flooded through Harry, just as it always did when it came to the new Malfoy. Well maybe not new, just unknown. The unknown Malfoy of the past 5 years. This letter wasn’t anything like he thought Malfoy would write. It was informal and domestic and not at all what he’d expect.
“No! No, thank you. You’re a great healer, and you don’t treat me differently like the ones I had before.”
When the Great Lake came into view, he instantly noticed the crisp lake air, slightly different but no less refreshing, from that of the hill and the field. A tentacle poked out of the water, as if the Giant Squid was greeting Harry. He just smiled, and waved back.
He decided right then and there he wouldn’t pretend to them. Not because he didn’t want to, but because he felt he didn’t need to. Not to them, the people who current Harry wasn’t jealous of because of old Harry. Unknown Harry could take them all, but these two, they stayed unmoving. They didn’t change, just like this castle, just like its trees.
Nott and Goyle, two Slytherins that he could only recall as being unpleasant. But he did remember their distance in 8th year, how they never started fights or followed anyone blindly. Their walls were higher than ever last time he saw them, just as all Slytherins had been. Except maybe for Malfoy, Parkinson and Zabini.
“Sometimes we just need one person to tell us we can do it, you know?” Malfoy smiled through teary eyes at his memory. “Just one. Mr Rizer was that for me.”
He also noticed how they helped each other, there was always someone who watched just in case a hippogriff would reject a student. There weren't any rejections yet, and the students were overjoyed.
He really thought he had it. Truly, wholeheartedly. But no. That life wasn’t his, and these two knew it. He wants to explain it to them, to tell them why he started this plan in the first place. How rewarding it was, how frustrating his life is with no memories of the life he wanted since he was a child.
“Either way, I’m still your main healer.” Tina started to talk, gesturing for Harry to follow. “Unless you wish to have a different healer?”
Harry told Malfoy about the people who knew about his performing act. From Teddy to Kingsley, Neville to Pansy and Blaise. How each one of them chewed him out, finding his plans unnecessary.
“It’s amazing,” Harry said, putting praise in his voice. “This is the vision you tried to drill into us during 8th year.”
Harry’s hands were gesturing wildly, trying to convey his message through weird actions and stumbling words. He could imagine Malfoy on the side, laughing at his silliness.
Her smile never left her face. Her curly dark brown hair matched her dark skin that seemed to glow like the sun made a home in her heart. Her eyes were just as bright. She was happy, incredibly so, and it radiated throughout the building.
While walking down the stairs, he could smell the pasta from last night. His stomach rumbled and he remembered that he’d barely gotten more than 3 bites before the argument broke out. He groaned at the memory. What was he thinking? But he felt he was well within his right to have been angry. He just knew starting the duel might’ve been a tad, just a tiny little tad, too far.
Harry hung his head lower, willing himself to sink into the chair. He couldn’t even look at Pansy anymore as she struck each blow with her words.
“Alrigh’. We’ll be learnin’ abou’ hippogriffs.” He looked at Harry who was standing awkwardly beside him. “My Potter ‘ere is going to help us.”
He’s wanted to ask her this before. It’s Hermione. She’s always had an answer for everything, and if she didn’t, she’d spend all her efforts looking for one. Ever since he met her, she seemed to hold all knowledge.
He watched her as she left. Once out of sight, he looked back down at the field, watching Hagrid throw chunks of meat to the thestrals. Harry ran down, old trainers, dirty jeans and all, to meet him.
Despite his face being mostly covered in hair, Harry could still see Hagrid’s cheek redden. “Thank you.”
“Of course. Especially with this new situation and all,” Parkinson added after pulling herself together quickly.
Harry was thankful Malfoy did that. He wasn’t sure if he’d be able to handle a party at the Burrow so soon, but two weeks was manageable. He could do something, maybe get a few memories by then.
He put down today’s Daily Prophet newspaper with ferociousness. Frustration tingling in his fingertips, but held back with taught control. It wasn’t as bad as it could have been.
She worked hard getting to where she was now. If she knew what she knew back then, she would be already at the top. Her new lines seemed to hold power over the majority of the muggle society. How she started trend and fashion statements.
Malfoy sighed, but kept rearranging his papers in an order that Harry didn’t quite understand. “Why don’t you guess?”
The sadness and anger of losing his memories have warped into hot thick jealousy running on his nerves.
He’d watched the pensieve memories so many times he could reenact them as if it were a one man show.
A watering hole was situated in the middle. There, the hippogriffs stood together. They were beautiful, as Harry recognised he’d always had a soft spot for hippogriffs. They’re feathers ranged from white and gold to dark greys and blues.
He closed his eyes and took a moment to think of Hedwig, and if she was okay where pets go after they die. He thought of an owlery, or an open forest filled with all the mice and owl treats they’d want. He imagined Hedwig making friends and flying so far into the sky she could almost touch it.
Harry knew he’d stop one day. Maybe it would be when the first memory comes, or maybe when the last one does. Either way, this was all he had. Amongst the joke of a job, forgotten friendship, and excessive envy, at least he had this.
She froze, and began to pack her notes. Her head was kept down, again avoiding Harry’s eyes. “I realised too late that I wanted a career in potions.”
Since then, Hermione’s words have faded slightly, but Harry still tries to hold on to them as he rereads every word in his office and rewatches every picture frame.
The memories stayed hidden. Even with confused healers performing the spell that counter Obliviate, nothing came. The Obliviate took his memories, but the hit on the head ensured they stayed gone. He’d have to try and get them back another way.
Suddenly, Malfoy was at his side, checking him. Either Harry was losing his sense of perception or the pain was becoming too distracting to notice. Yet there Malfoy was, casting simple diagnostic spells on Harry even though they had just fought.
But if there was nothing to do, there was everything to think about. He’d end up in his office that had become increasingly difficult to stay in. It was annoying he couldn’t stay there, as if the two Harry’s of this world couldn’t coexist, it was one or the other, and Harry knew it wasn’t meant to be him.
The office was complete a few hours later. It wasn’t a completely new office, but this one felt right. This one felt more Harry now, than it did before. A part of him was nervous about this change, but he knew this was moving on.
Instead, Malfoy’s face broke out into a wide dopey grin. His face glowing and bright and was, for the first time that Harry had seen today, completely relaxed.
When he asked Lavender why they don’t stasis everything, she glared at him the way Hermione used to when he was studying for his NEWTs.
Then, he looked properly at the desk. There were books, what seemed to be diaries and journals, stacked up. Going to pick one of them up for reading, movement caught the corner of his eye.
A few hours later they returned with bags full of new things and packages waiting patiently for him at his open window. Harry gathers it all and brings it upstairs to his office.
Through his chest aching cries, Malfoy stayed beside him. He didn’t hug him or touch him, but he was there. That was perfect for Harry. He didn’t think he could handle anything else right now.
Harry just kept his mouth shut, he’d already stepped past a lot of Malfoy’s mental sanity checkpoints today. Yet, he knew he was amazed with Malfoy. The completely new Malfoy, miles ahead of the one in his memories.
It was so strikingly domestic, his heart felt a strong pull. But even so, he needed to remember it all first. He wasn’t going to do anything like this. Not while he wasn’t really himself.
His mind had other thoughts, of course. Despite an outward appearance of nothingness, his head still continued to run a marathon. Every single one he filed right back to look at later. But later never seemed to come, there was no right time to think about Draco Malfoy.
Then Harry felt it. His body roared to life like a fire that got new fuel. Now he could feel everything. He could feel his magic course around him like a second skin. His fingertips were tingling. The vein in his neck pulsed with his racing heartbeat. His hair stood up, his eyes went in and out of focus.
He couldn’t have stopped the sudden onslaught of laughter even if he wanted to. He felt it shoot up from the bottom of his feet to the top of his chest. It lasted about 5 straight minutes, and through it all, Isolt stayed perched proudly on his head.
He grabbed at the thoughts whizzing around his mind, trying to focus on one thing. Every single thought he caught was how much better the life of unknown Harry was. How he had everything.
“That’s the bedroom.” Malfoy pointed to the room at the end of the hallway. “That’s the spare room.” Pointing to another door next to it.
Harry took a moment to think. He didn’t even think he’d live to hear the word Quidditch again. When he walked into that forest, surrounded by those who loved him who passed on, he couldn’t allow himself to imagine a world in which he won. But now, that’s exactly where Harry was. A world in which he won.
Even after that embarrassing mix up of Draco's, they scheduled another date. A lunch, that time. At another muggle place. One of Draco's suggestions; there was a diner he would visit in the early mornings when he was hungover. The staff knew him, but they didn't
Could he meet with him that early on? Back when they were younger, their first meeting was important. The first conflict of the year, and all that. Harry sunk into the train seat further.
They were standing in the study when there were perfectly fine chairs. But a part of Draco (an admittedly petty part) didn't want Potter to taint them with his Golden Boy-ness. And he would— he made everything around seem at least 20% more Good just by being around them. Including Draco, especially now that he wasn't being overshadowed by his father's influences.
They both knew he was lying, but neither of them said anything. It was pitch black outside with only the lamps of the locker room giving them any source of light or heat. Draco stayed like that, arms tight around Potter, inhaling whatever soap or cologne Potter used so he wouldn’t have to smell the sweat of the uniform.
Potter laughed, and he felt his chest ache. Oh, if only Blaise could see him now. He’d surely be laughing at his misfortunes. Laughing, while providing no help whatsoever. Draco offered a small smile, and both of them walked off toward the kitchens.
Well, almost everyone. Madame Hooch definitely knew he created a study spot out of what was, essentially, her office. Sometimes he would walk to his usual spot and find a plate with little sandwiches on it and a glass of pumpkin juice. Or a picnic blanket on the ground when it rained, charmed to keep him dry and warm. And in return, he made sure to clean up any mess he made and to help Madame Hooch put away any equipment that was left out.
Albus is afraid to breathe. There's so much dust in the air that he fears he'll choke to death and nobody will find his body in the morning. His shoes make soft tapping noises on the floor. Was this a classroom? There aren't any desks or cauldrons. No chalkboards. Why does nobody use these classrooms? Sure they're in some need of repair and cleaning, but it's not as if that's an impossible task.
He can't help but wonder what the solid soles of his boot would feel against his aching cock. Merlin, there was something wrong with him, wasn't there? Normal nineteen year olds didn't travel a million miles away from home to research different species of dragon heartstring on wands. Normal nineteen year olds didn't lust after the second-eldest sibling of a family he was raised to hate. Normal nineteen year olds especially didn't have depraved fantasies about said second-eldest sibling spitting on his boot and making Draco lick it off.
Draco sits back down at the body of his husband with their child in his arms. It's quiet now as he wipes gunk away from its bulging eyes. In the distance, underneath the sound of rain, he hears the cracks of multiple people apparating. His face is swollen from crying, but he's stopped now. There are no more tears to give.
"My apologies Mr. Allen. I am not qualified to take employee interviews. But I can take your information to send to Mr. Barnes so he can contact you and schedule for an interview."
not here to harass you while you recover. I just... it's not often someone in my field comes across someone who was
Hermione tugged harder and he finally sat back down. His gaze didn’t leave Malfoy’s form, which had sat down at the very end of the table with the least amount of students and was subtly adding food to his plate. It took him a while to recognize that he was feeling surprised. He couldn’t remember the last time something had truly shocked him. Oh, a symbol of death is following him around? Sounds like a Tuesday. The weird creatures that infested the Weasley’s shed were asking for autographs? How many need a signature?
“Sod off!” Draco couldn’t help but laugh as he shoved his pillow into one of his best friends’ faces. Sometimes he felt guilty that someone like him, a Death Eater, could still laugh after the War, while good, innocent people could no longer laugh. Because of his actions. Because of his choices.
"Well, I imagine I'd just woo you. And you'd be so frozen from my charm that you would concede right then and there." He was grinning, they both were.
Harry's stomach hurt. He couldn't imagine what kind of sick thing Blaise would make him do if he picked dare. The way he kept glancing at Draco surely didn't bode well for him, now did it? But truth was scary... Then again, Harry would probably be asked about some stupid rumor about his love life that wasn't even true. He'd be willing to take the chance.
It feels even better than fantastic. He comes in record time, he feels. The painful ache in his stomach decreases and Draco can finally relax. Maybe it's because he bottoms so rarely that he's so sensitive down there. But at least that means his butt is fairly safe for now.
Few House Elves were there this late at night. They cowered at the sight of Draco, but relaxed when Potter followed close behind him. He tried very hard not to take offense to that. He knows his family doesn’t have a great track record with House Elves, but it’s not like he was especially dastardly to them. They even looked between them as if Draco must’ve bewitched Potter to get him to be in the same room as him.
"Draco," Harry whispers, and he sounds just as affected as Draco is. And he isn't even experiencing a rut.
"I appreciate everything you do for me," he confessed. "You never had to help me, I know that. You could've turned me away when I first came here, begging for help and grovelling at your feet. But you didn't. And I don't know how to repay that."
. It’s been celebrated by wizards and witches for centuries, but it doesn’t seem to be fairly popular nowadays. None of the seasonal holidays seem to be…”
The Room is cold, so cold that it would give anyone else hypothermia. But not for an omega in heat. Especially not Draco Malfoy, whose heat came unexpectedly after he lost his pills. His skin burns and even the touch of silk bed sheets against it makes him gasp and twitch his hips.
"Ah, yes, I remember. You kept casting shield charms when the Aurors would get close to you and that Muggle. Absolutely extraordinary. Is that a skill that shows up when you're a child, like with other magical children?"
"We're going to have to tell our friends eventually," Draco says, while Harry is unprepared to brush it off and change the subject.
Draco swallowed the thick emotion coming up his throat. He grabbed Harry's hand and pulled the man up against his chest, burying his head into his shoulder. Inhaled the smell that clung to some of his clothes that he missed so much.
Hank loved it. Draco loved talking to him. He had so many interesting stories about his job. He was so curious about Draco's life. For a moment, Draco wondered if this guy had amnesia and just forgot who Draco Malfoy was. For a moment, he wondered if this man could finally be the one to help him get over the one who's had his heart for ten years.
Luna placed her thin hand atop his. “Draco Malfoy is back! It’s been so long since you or I have spoken to him, hasn’t it?”
The bed was right there, yet Draco didn't want to move. He felt as if the spell would be broken if he pulled away.
"They're not tomes, Seamus," Dean reminded him with a fond roll of his eyes. "They're records of Wizarding families."
"Of course I knew that. This is my life's work, you know. I'd appreciate it if you took this a bit more seriously."
"How do you think I'm doing? I just transformed during the full moon with some shitty counterfeit Wolfsbane potion, clawed ribbons into my own skin, nearly murdered a Muggle, and was restrained like a monster by a team of ten Aurors. All humiliatingly in public. I was a wolf for three more days and only transformed back yesterday.
As if possessed, Draco whips his hand away from his bum and runs toward the familiar voice. His head is in a fog and he's relying exclusively on scent to find Harry now. He feels
Just when the stimulation started getting to be too much, she removed the vibrator and her fingers. With her fingers, wet with his cum, she rubbed his mound, nearly grazing his sensitive cock.
It isn't the first time Ron's seen his nightmares. Far from it, in fact. But whatever nightmares he had before have apparently doubled since last year. Not that Ron could blame him, of course not.
He understood this was all his father's fault. The man was such a sneaky bastard at the end of the First War that nobody wanted to risk another slip. Draco understood a lot of what was happening to him was his father's fault. His foolish father— he didn't know how he ever looked up to him. Children do stupid things, he supposed.
"You can talk to me, you know." Hank looked up at him. Draco cleared his throat and looked at his dessert. "If you're anxious about... it. That's alright. I'm not expecting anything from you. We can just hang out at my place. Or we can just go our separate ways!"
Will Ron and Hermione follow him? Or will they (rightfully) assume that he wants to be left alone with his thoughts for a while?
Gellert laughs as if he can read Albus' thoughts. And maybe he can. He teasingly undoes another button, pulling at the shirt to expose his chest even more. There's a noticeable tent in his trousers. Albus has never seen the younger look so debauched in all their times of knowing each other.
"I know!" Draco pulled at his silky hair. "I know. I just... It really hurt that I looked so stupid in front of him. Fawning over this man who wasn't even real. It hurt that he didn't trust me just to appear as himself from the beginning."
Draco was right, like Harry thought he'd be, and they broke into the house. It was seemingly empty and neither of them noticed the presence of one of the members, watching them in the darkness.
, or they could cause a mess of things. A literal and metaphorical approach to their relationship, really.
So when they let their hair grow long, it's all for the blanket appreciative smile James would give them.
Pansy Parkinson is not the type of person you want to introduce to your parents unless it was a marriage deal. Hermione shudders at the thought of trying to find the commonalities between her Muggle dentist parents and a Slytherin rich witch of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.
I don't write a lot of major character death. There is definitely an alternative ending out there in which everyone is alive and happy, but I decided not to write that one.
Malfoy’s bed was empty when he reached their shared bedroom. The light was on in their bathroom and he heard the water from the sink. Harry took the break to quickly change into his pajamas, so Malfoy couldn’t see him like that. Well, he supposed, if they were going to be on the same team then they’d probably see each other in half-dressed states quite often. He ignored the heat rising to his face and kept buttoning up his top.
Which Draco could understand. Blaise and Pansy still didn’t know, but he could never lie to his mother. Even if he didn’t hint about any changes in his relationship she just
Zygmunt pulled away from the touch and slid down the stone wall until his bum hit the floor. If he stretched his bare legs, they would touch the patch of sunlight stretching into the corridor, but he didn't want to feel warm. He curled up his legs to his chest, pulling out the vial of molten gold liquid.
Ron didn’t end up levitating a blond, screaming Slytherin through the corridors. Which, to some degree, was a shame. Harry kind of thought he deserved it for breaking his promise from that morning. Malfoy didn’t look at him at all during the two classes they had together, but Harry couldn’t help but look.
Eventually, it was Hermione who lifted Ron up and off of her. She held him steady and looked up at Harry. “I’ll be taking off. He’s fallen asleep twice while I was telling him about my essay.”
like to feel pain. The sight alone made his cock throb in need. He smacked the round flesh with his open palm, clutching the same spot afterwards firmly.
Once the green sparks subsided, Teddy stood back up. They enchanted the ropes to tie around the headboard. Keeping James' arms away from his dick and his body open. His skin was like a canvas made from the most expensive material. And gifted to Teddy so they can create a beautiful image on it.
Harry stood on his toes to kiss Blaise's cheek and then he noticed a cardboard box tucked under her arm. His cheeks heated up as he thought about what could be in there.
"He sure would. But he's an old madman nowadays. He's been neglecting my poor mother trying to figure out how to get my sperm to produce more heirs. I pity my future wife."
A break of squeaky, high-pitched cries destroy the relative silence. It's coming from the cauldron. Draco doesn't want to let go of Harry, but he must. The guilt would consume him if he were to neglect the life Harry sacrificed himself for.
Harry's body stills, his breathing evens out. Ron feels his throat catch when Harry turns closer to him and wraps an arm around his body.
when you mother hen, Hermione, but maybe we should let him be for right now? Harry’s a big boy, if something is going on then I’m sure he’ll tell us.” He gave Harry a pointed look. Both of them knew it took a lot for Harry to come to them when he was feeling down.
Seamus was sporting a wide, toothy grin. "Oh yeah. My mum's talked in length about this. Says that's the one thing she regrets about marrying a Muggle; there's no way she can be a part of these duels."
He smiled back at her. It felt like the most genuine one in a while. Harry always had a soft spot for Luna, from the moment they met. At first, it may have been out of pity but by now he knows it’s definitely grown into a real friendship.
"Stop getting distracted, Shay. Seriously." He pushed the book away. And he groaned when Seamus wouldn't give up. There was a list of magical names, wand cores, dates, and... spells? Defense spells, attacking spells, and more.
Eagerly, Harry removed his sticky boxers. Threw them by the door as a reminder to clean them later. Blaise tossed the vibrator on the bed and stood up fully to give him a little show. Removing her jeans and bra so all she wore were black panties and her mesh top, now showing her chest through. Harry's cunt throbbed.
, Sirius mused, a grin tugging at his lips. An absolutely beautiful whore. Draco's back muscles were flexing and quivering. They tensed when he held the sofa cushion harder than before. It made Sirius a bit melancholy that he couldn't flip him over and see how his stomach muscles jumped. Fuck, he probably could've seen his dick poking around in his guts if he had flipped over. Next time, definitely.
"Oh, of course. Can't have a normal time going on dates, getting to know each other, meeting each other's parents. That's barbaric."
Surely, Harry wouldn't notice if his cloak was missing for just a few hours. Would he? Hermione's lip aches from between her teeth as she pokes around one of her best friend's personal trunk. She tries her hardest to look past the pairs of underwear and socks. (Did Harry even keep the cloak in his trunk when he wasn't using it?)
But this is a bit of a different situation. One that she's not ready for her best friend to know, let alone him
, he thought, then hated himself for thinking it. The man left him standing at the door. Fuck, Draco wished he had opened it for him. He didn't know if he had the capability to open it.
, look at his personal diary from when he was fourteen years old. And, of course, it wasn't like he could edit it before the Ministry snatched a hold of his childhood home and all of its objects, setting up a stasis on everything so it wouldn't be touched.
Eventually, Draco cleared his throat. "Well, are you going to let me in?" He asked, perhaps a bit more bitterly than he meant. He could already feel a swell of emotion in his chest that wasn't getting any smaller.
Draco could understand that. His stomach felt warm knowing he was getting along with Granger. He never thought she’d be able to forgive him, but he was happy they could civilly talk about something, even if it was school-related. “Sure. I’m sure she’d love to lend it to you.”
"I'm fine," he assures Slughorn, who was probably worrying that he ruined his star student and the Boy Who Lived. "This potion is just... bizarre."
"Of course, love. "Teddy pulled on the ropes, jerking James' body around a bit. "Have to do something to reward good behavior, don't I?"
Despite the teasing from his friends, every time Draco thought about his chest he felt like he could cast a fully corporeal Patronus. The area was still pretty sore but his private Healer assured him he should be able to go back to school. It wasn’t a procedure he ever thought he’d be able to get, especially not when he was a young child.
"Blaise!" Draco hissed, punching his (not-best) friend in the arm. He looked at Harry, in sympathy and curiosity.
Potter was in two of his classes. Draco tried his best to ignore the Gryffindor’s intense eyes on him, ignoring the heat that rose to his skin at the thought of Potter paying any mind to him at all. Where was all that attention for the last seven years? If all Draco had to do was ignore him, he would’ve done that far sooner.
Ginny held up a finger so she could sip her wine. Then she said, "He didn't when we were at Hogwarts. We have not been together in quite a while, so I am honestly unsure if has any tattoos nowadays."
Something about the way Draco was glaring at the stone floor beneath them, Harry didn’t think mentioning that would be an appropriate response. He cleared his throat, testing the waters.
"Well, I suppose I can shirk my duties for a little while. Who knows— maybe I will become the first gay Malfoy in my lineage to end it."
Draco scoffed. He crossed his arms, if only to hide the nervous thrum of his fingertips against his skin. "So what was that man's name? If he's not actually called Hank Allen."
He knew she wasn't going to let him rest until he'd come, minimum, three times. Once with the wand while she was fingering him, another time with the wand and her cock, and a final time without the wand and only her cock as she found her own orgasm.
