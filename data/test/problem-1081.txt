James looked reluctant for a few seconds, then he was struggling with himself and finally sighed audibly
Later he thought of some reason to have Harriet, just once, at least try her. Perhaps… He could find an excuse in the ancient laws of the Black. His ancestors did far worse things than he wanted to do with Harriet. And found it
Harriet had received a visitor and Draco was sure it was one of her parents or her godparents. His father had not yet threatened to disown him or expel him from the family tree because for generations the Malfoys only had one son. Rather, his father had told him that he hoped that he would pass the whim for the mestizo and they could get a quick divorce in the future
The book slid to the floor as Harriet straddled Tom's lap, facing him. The pages had an underlined note and it looked like handwritten. The note read: Women who speak Parseltongue are often very proud and do not approach those they love, but they cannot resist the orders of the person they love if they are spoken in Parseltongue. Apparently it was in this way that Salazar himself married his wife
In his defense, it had to be said that he had not invented anything and he had seen everything with his own eyes. Also, with six siblings he was used to quickly spreading any information that fell into his hands
Sirius slowed his hips to try to hold out longer as he felt Harriet orgasm again. They had been making love for almost two hours and Sirius had controlled his ejaculation with great effort to prevent her from leaving and enjoy it to the fullest
-Good. Go practice the purification magic circle design that we are learning while in Egypt. It is useful to know a lot of magic.
The war was over. Voldemort was dead and the Malfoy family had been exonerated after they passed the Veritaserum test and it was known that they were forced to serve Voldemort.
Zefrina looked at the letter from her ex-husband. Her ex-father-in-law's pompous bird was on the windowsill. Zefrina had been bitten viciously enough times to know she shouldn't go near the bird, and she didn't want to give it a treat.
Lelwani looked at his sister who was next to him making her robes for Hogwarts. Several wizards went to that school from abroad, so the patterns of the robes were easy to get
Zefrina gritted her teeth as she saw the man's plans in her mind. She waited for them to leave and approached the girl at the door. Not even a protection or heating spell, just a blanket, a letter and a basket in the cold night
Article that was followed shortly after by a fellow student's confession of Ron's advances on her. A very detailed description
Of course, said best friend didn't have to know that Sirius and his wife had been dating for a week. Like said best friend's wife didn't need to know that Sirius and James had slept together one day when they were drunk.
-I'm fine- Magnolia tried to smile- Luckily Harry didn't see it. He would tell Sirius and we wouldn't hear an ending to this, at least not a good one.
-It's the Malfoy family crest, Grandma promised me her house. I'm supposed to wear her coat and colors with pride- Magnolia didn't quite understand what that meant, but the elegant woman who had said it seemed very serious. Aunt Andy called her Minerva
Draco turned to look at her and raised Magnolia's jaw a little to kiss her, was it weird that the boy tasted like strawberries?
-You may be fooling an Animagus nose. But the werewolves are much stronger. Harry smells like you and James, but Magnolia smells like you and someone else, familiar but unfamiliar. Babies do not begin to develop their own scent until three months.
Lelwani took off his hat and went to the table with deafening shouts. Arinna sat next to her after being classified into Gryffindor as well. She smiled and nodded at a pair of twins.
And Sirius's mother did not invite them to any event again because people ended up congratulating the older couple who believed sterile more than the young ones who had conceived early.
The magic was dark and very complicated. One good thing about being so close to an original wizard was that their intuitive understanding of magic had greatly increased. Which was necessary if Heather broke all the windows in the house by mistake when she had a fever or called storms when she felt sad.
- Of course it is part of my evil plan, my lord. I spend the hours dreaming and planning to bring you to my bed and to this house- She took a drink from the bottle directly- I couldn't care less what you do and what you think Orion. And you have already made clear how you feel about me. And I feel absolutely nothing towards you. Any possible respect or affection vanished with your treatment of me
The first time Magnolia saw Draco with another girl was when they were fourteen. Before the tournament of the three magicians but with the goblet of fire already placed in a position of honor. She was walking the corridors with Luna as they talked about the history of magic.
A lot happens when you are a spy and you have to keep the cover up. Even a baby. A story of what would happen if Harry had a twin but she was the daughter of another father
Although Harriet was sure the headmaster knew. But totally sure, she had even told him that morning that her things would be moved to a double room. Before, many students were married at the beginning of their senior year, so Hogwarts had special rooms for married couples. Both from the same house and from different houses
Euphemia Potter looked ready for war while Fleamont looked bloodthirsty with so many vials of dangerous potions in his hands. Sirius had always seen them kind and warm, nothing like that
-Well, I have to find her. Half the train's Alphas seek her out to try to woo her when they learn that she was Omega. They won't beat me
Lily Evans did not expect to meet a girl identical to James except for the eyes. Eyes eerily similar to yours
She passed her hand in front of his eyes before smiling and approaching him. The invisibility cloak served as a mattress as the man tossed it onto the bed.
She was raising up as a savior a girl the same age as her daughter. Zefrina had followed the gypsy custom of giving birth accompanied only by a Veela. July 31 had been a dangerous day due to that damn prophecy that everyone seemed to know, but Zefrina gave birth to her daughter safely
It was simply that sex ceased to interest them at some point in their lives, usually around thirty, and then they turned to other kinds of entertainment. This is why most thoroughbred families married young and had at least one child very quickly. The Weasleys were the exception to the rule
The woman looked at her daughter who had a couple of scratches that a house elf was treating with affection. The girl wouldn't correct herself for doing what she thought was right. Nor would she regret it no matter how much I scold her
-Lady Potter will find her mate by the smell of her, like all Omegas. Albus Dumbledore has no jurisdiction over something that is as old as magic itself.
Harriet walked into one of the supposedly empty classrooms and saw Tom Riddle sitting by the window. With the sun shining behind him and making him look so handsome.
-If you want to keep looking at the painting without seeing the painting, that's fine, but one day you will have to stop looking at the frame. Although if he can play you too
Harry took a train at the station that led directly to the body of Walburga Black. With Tom Riddle still a child, a distant husband, and plenty of free time in her hands, Walburga decides to raise the next dark lord.
-To marry outside the family and take another surname, Black women sign an agreement that if one of their children or grandchildren is a metamorphomago she will bear the surname Black and marry a member of the family. Although there aren't many Blacks procreating right now to make a husband to her - Sirius stroked the girl's nose before approaching the boy and seeing his striking resemblance to James
The man was a talented architect and had rebuilt the ancestral home of the Bulstrode for Millicent. Except for the original place and wood, the house was no longer the cold floating mansion in which Millicent had grown up.
To Heather, Arcturus, and Regulus, those who treated Kreacher well, the elf was a sweetheart. Hard but a love
Severus closed the door carefully and opened his robes slowly. Her swollen flesh came into view as he watched her. He groaned as his fist encircled, or attempted to encircle, the standing flesh. A slight lubrication spell made the rub softer and sweeter.
Leanne Bulstrode, her little sister, on the other hand, was her mother's right eye. Slim, beautiful, with a charming face, and affected by "red magic." It always made Millicent think of Bellatrix LeStrange, for some reason.
The war was at its height when Millicent returned home for Christmas to see her parents sprawled on the ground, along with the house elves. In puddles of half dried blood.
-Well, I had not noticed that Magnolia's hair is slightly bluish in the light- the children tensed and Magnolia clung to the end of one of her braids- It's beautiful, you should let it loose
-My Alpha is Draco Malfoy. My muggle relatives abused me and the Malfoys took my custody thanks to the laws.
Omegas, even more powerful than the Alphas. But more dedicated to defense and healing by nature, unless you touched one of their children. Very fertile and rare. In thoroughbred society they were highly valued because they could have many children. An example of Omega was Molly Weasley and hers was her seven children, all Alpha
Walburga was a beautiful woman, which was shown by the beautiful children she had had. She was the kind of woman who in her youth had red roses, red wine, strong perfume, and red lipstick all over the place.
Seeing Draco's face during the Yule dance was a damn sweet moment for Magnolia. And for Harry too, he who congratulated her on starting to move away from her fiancé's uptight hairdo. Narcissa also congratulated her in her letter, claiming that they were Black women and should not be trampled on by anyone because they were strong, beautiful and powerful.
Rose Marie and the goblin frowned. Rose didn't like to think that someone she hadn't met before had power over her marriage. The goblin, on the other hand, did not keep his opinions
Who would tell him that his mother would be present when the tapestry of his lineage would create a new branch linking him to Harriet?
Arinna was very good at creating potions. Lelwani was good at making offensive and defensive spells and creating amulets.
-Here are many years of repressed feelings, two brothers who are back in tune. But Regulus needs to rest properly, that potion was very hard for him. The best thing is that you do not speak until tomorrow and Regulus can let his mind rest- Fleamont smiled at the two with affection- I missed seeing you together. But now Regulus needs to take this potion to sleep
The girls smiled and ran to their mother's store. The attractive woman was calming her youngest baby, the son of another gypsy.
His room was always with the large windows closed and there were many candles and aromatic oils on each surface. After all, the scent of those damn roses filled every corner of the mansion's surroundings.
She was not as innocent as she was not to know that Ron had had sex with several girls, but until that moment he had limited his adventures to private moments. At least as private as his clumsy mind allowed him. But they were already in fifth year, he must know better what to do
That's why she was taking a walk down Privet Drive at night. Although she was a natural legimens she could restrain her gift, but with such emotion the thoughts of the magicians were like screams in her ears. So she preferred to walk at night in a muggle town
Magnolia watched from the Ravenclaw table as her twin brother and her fiancé were staring at each other as if they were going to kill each other. It was not that rare, they had met before in Diagon Alley with similar results
*It's okay! Always you do this! You look at me and I feel naked and defenseless! I feel weak and vulnerable, like I have to entrust my whole life to you and that makes me nervous! That's why I avoid you! I can't be weak, I can't be helpless! I…! * Harriet's words were stopped by Tom's lips. He kissed her slowly and gently
- Magnolia, the brothers will accompany you throughout your childhood- Draco's mother looked at her with a warm smile on her lips- But your husband will accompany you all your adult life. When you and Harry decide to start your own families, Draco will be the person you start yours with.
Normal wizards needed a wand to do adult magic and could not control their magic as children. The originals did not need that, the same magic bent to their wishes. Non-verbal and wandless spells came out as if they were breathing. All magicians were said to be descended from these originals. And the wands were the means that they used so that their children, less powerful than them, could use magic
Sirius busied himself lighting candles with his wand while the elves finished laying down the black silk sheets, with the Black shield. With the glow of the candles on the silk, he made everything look very immoral and sexual in the room.
But things changed if visitors came, his mother would always pretend to be the perfect woman in front of visitors. As much as she hated James and the Potters, Walpurga Black was the perfect Lady Black
Young Draco rubbed his ears after he heard the howler shut up, the letter had been sent directly to the new private quarters. It was literally the third howler of the week from his father. He hoped they would find out later
Although neither of them would say that it was what they both desired from the bottom of their hearts.
The Bulstrode ancestral home was built on gravitational trees above the ground and on a spell dome that controlled the weather around it. The water was obtained from a reservoir that the house elves filled every week. When she emptied it with a spell, she could see that the potion vials that her father kept in her office were at the bottom of the warehouse.
Her pale, creamy skin interrupted only by her shoes and those sheer white underwear. He knew he wasn't the only one who had gotten an erection when he saw her, thank heaven for the wizard robes
Neville had fallen in love with Harriet in their second year at Hogwarts. She was the only one who seemed to understand how close he felt to plants
- It was Regulus, but don't tell Sirius. - Remus looked horrified- He is one of our spies within the Death Eaters and my contact within the group. Professor Dumbledore told us that if one of us was ever captured he had to behave like the others until he helped us escape or get away from the hands of the Death Eaters.
The other Gryffindor Omegas entered the shared room. There were about six beds in that room alone, but only three were occupied. The black boy and the girl who had helped her before seeing her so lost entered
Magnolia was grateful to Draco, he had saved her from war. Following Dumbledore's death, Draco had drugged Magnolia with the Living Dead Filter and taken her to the Malfoys' Gringots chamber. She was looked after while unconscious by the goblins, in exchange for a fee.
Harriet looked fondly at the center of one of the house's gardens. Neville was planting a new plant. In that area there was only a magical tree with bright white fruits and blue leaves, with a silver trunk. The fruits helped the body to heal naturally from any injury or illness. The leaves were used to make salves and antidotes, and the wood was good for making brooms
-Not only an Alpha but also one from the dark side- They both sighed- If Dumbledore discovers it he will force a mating with an Alpha among his followers
-Riddle ... Iih ... Please ... This is not fun ... I don't ... Tom ...- Harriet paused with each new blow. She could feel like she had gotten so wet that she could feel her wetness slide down her pants, she wasn't wearing skirts. And she knew Tom was noticing it too, if that smug smile meant anything
But they don't care about me. They were crazy with happiness. The north wing was repainted and reconditioned. Play areas were made and they began to study all possible motherhood and parenting spells. Fleamont personally made all the potions to nourish Euphemia's pregnancy and she followed many tips to make sure the child growing in her womb was healthy
-Yes, no one from the ministry can enter our house for years. We will not let them steal what they yearn for-James clenched his fists tightly as he looked at the protective rooms of his house.
-Of course, princess. Not a word will come from my lips about what happened here or that I am your partner on trial
-Quite security. Severus looked up in time to see a young girl. Who was? She looked like Potter- Who are you?
Walpurga had left Sirius with the house elves as soon as he was born. She hadn't even breastfed him and had used a potion to stop producing milk. She did not believe that Walpurga had been with her children for more than a week after giving birth. Orion, for his part, had not wanted to be a father or marry Walpurga. He did not care about anything other than his position as head of the family
-Actually I will dedicate myself to trying to create new musical spells. So everything will be fine. And you could practice the transfiguration where you're lousy
- Ronald Weasley! - Neville's shout made everyone fall silent - I challenge you to a duel for the honor of the Heiress Harriet Potter
The boy grabbed her arm and all of her around her flushed with color as Rose Marie felt her cheeks blush.
Rose Marie wanted to take refuge in the arms of her Alpha, she didn't like that red-haired Alpha at all. He didn't see her. He saw the things that Rose Marie carried on her back, the titles that she possessed, he did not see Rose Marie
Dumbledore had been furious that he had not known in advance of the abuse the two brothers suffered. Fortunately the Tonks lived far enough away from the wizarding world for their expectations. Furthermore, Harry carried the weight of Magnolia's blood barriers and Magnolia held Harry's.
-Don't say that out loud- she whispered in her ear quickly- The portraits are spies of the director and if he knows that you already have your partner he will keep you away
They could not stand each other, the Gryffindors made a pineapple on one side and the Slytherins on the other. Arguments and duels between both houses were common and sometimes pitched battles occurred in the corridors. Three out of four wounded in the infirmary were due to these battles.
He looked in the mirror for a few moments, it didn't look like him. He had long ago assumed that with his physical appearance it would be impossible for him to find women to alleviate his carnal desires. The dungeon master just didn't get a night of casual sex easily
Memories of his beautiful childhood always came to him when he was in the south wing. That moment when he did not notice anything strange, he only saw how special the person next to him was
There a black boy took her by the shoulders and she could smell her honeysuckle coming from him. Another Omega. Another girl who smelled of another flower sat down with her and they created a barrier between the loud Alpha and the shy Beta.
Heather had no attachment to the witch, she had seen her about three times in her life on the very rare trips to Grimauld Place. Always from afar. The dark lord had broken what little was left of Bellatrix's sanity
After four hours of painstaking preparation, even with the help of magic, Harry decided that he would never complain about the time it took for a woman to get ready if he became a man again. But never again, never ever.
Footsteps sounded on a damp stone surface, a footstep he had heard thousands of times in the dungeons. One hand went through the devil's lasso with ease and grabbed his shirt as he pulled him off the floor.
It was November 3, the Potters died on the 31st just after dark. The girl had been recovered while her parents' bodies were still warm. So Dumbledore had had her for several days. Her magic core had been partly sealed, her powers too, they had put compulsions and loyalty spells on her. Besides Dumbledore hoping that by growing up in an abusive home she would be loyal to the man who would rescue her, to him.
Zefrina looked at the gold her former father-in-law had given her. That gold was just a tiny bit in that family's fortune, but they believed it was a lot for Zefrina.
A figure that the founders of Hogwarts created to make sure there were more people like them. People who followed and maintained their noble principles by passing a test devised by the founders themselves
Madame Malkin watched with tears in her eyes and her assistant smiled foolishly at the image of the first meeting of a couple. But Draco didn't care. She was there now and she was his
That lack of brain was one of the reasons why the Weasley family had been ruined three generations ago.
Layer upon layer of ward rooms of level 5 or higher, with their magic intertwined alongside that of their parents.
She normally didn't speak to many people. She corresponded with the heads of the household of the sacred 28, and Grandfather Arcturus came to see her frequently. But interacting with another person was weird.
Heather made her magic calm the elf before using Legimens on the poor creature. The potion, the cave, the corpses, the pond, ... Heather got up and looked at the elf
-Most Potter men have married or fallen in love with green-eyed women. It's kind of weird that they all had that in common, if you ask my most honest opinion. Even so, very few Potter-born have had green eyes. And those who have them are said to be special
-This will meet a lot of opposition and will be rejected very often, possibly it will take a whole generation to get it out. Banning marriages between people of the same blood is unheard of in the wizarding world
A flash of white caught Andromeda's attention and she saw the girl's hair turn white in seconds. It reminded him of his Dora. Black blood was strong in the girl. She wondered if the ancestors who lost that power would squirm in their graves knowing that only their descendants of Mudbloods had the most sacred gift to the House of Black.
-The first month he avoided you and focused on Harry. But after that I think he came to terms with himself and he loved you. He became the typical idiot father who was already making plans to attack any boy who wanted to be your boyfriend- Remus smiled to himself as he remembered Antlers with Magnolia in his arms. Sirius and him planning how to teach Harry to keep the boys away from his sister.- I have more stories, if you want to hear them
That brave lioness fled from him a lot, but he would soon catch her. Salazar's own basilisk had said that she was a talker, like him. And that Tom's mission was to continue the family name with the other speaker
The Potters died in a world without Voldemort, Harriet was raised by Sirius. But now there is an ancient tradition that must be fulfilled
The weight of Draco's great-grandmother's engagement ring suddenly grew heavier on Magnolia's right hand. She squeezed her books so much that Luna took them
There was no mistaking it, he loved having Lily in his family's ancestral home. Nothing united so much as planning the murder of a genocide. The problem was the other three pests
-The gypsy law establishes that if we find an abandoned child we can keep him. And I don't see anyone claiming the girl abandoned at this door
The Potters definitely had a lot of money. The second oldest family in wizarding Britain, as far as he knew. Damn, they called it a mansion, but that looked more like a palace. According to the words of Potter senior, while they were dining in the third dining room, the king of magical Britain had given this place as a gift to the Potters by giving his youngest daughter in marriage to…. Another extinct thoroughbred family
That bastard had tricked her! Now she was glad she hadn't given in to her carnal desires and slept with Abraxas. The man who swore to love her above the world and who wanted her to be his wife. That damn man was married with a pregnant wife at home
The only thing that did not change in this world of another in which the first child had chased his dream was the hatred between the Gryffindor and the Slytherin.
- You shouldn't have been so reckless. - Regulus looked at Sirius, it was the first time in almost seven years that they were together, in the same room and without ignoring each other. Or with his mother yelling at Sirius and praising Regulus. Or without Sirius looking at him with reproach in his eyes just because Regulus didn't want to be like him
-Let me contact your magic, I'll know the location. They won't hurt her anymore, I'll take you to her- Narcissa put her hand on Lucius's man when Draco allowed her father to touch his magic.
The Hufflepuff test. No one knew what it was, but it tested loyalty. More than 200 Hufflepuffs surpassed him, becoming the princes of his house.
So Harriet went to Hogwarts and they could only see each other a few times during the school year. And she began to change, to mature. To become more of a woman
His bedroom was the second to last one down the hall. He was one of the two that got the most light. The next door was slightly open and I could hear a soft humming.
Runes of all kinds, potions, magic circles, blood rituals, sacrificial rituals and spells. Astrology, history, how to make amulets and protection practices.
Alphas, magically very powerful and dominant magicians. Specialized in attack and great leaders. Those who ran the magical world, but their fertility was incredibly low, normally they could only have a child if they were not with an Omega
The first to qualify was Draco. Of course he was a Slytherin, Rose Marie clapped, but she was the only one outside Slytherin house who did.
Euphemia and Fleamont had convinced themselves that they were sterile and would never be blessed with a child. Years in which a son did not come despite all their efforts and fertility potions convinced them of that
-I don't know, one of the dark lord's remains made him drink a strange potion- The girl, Heather, raised deep and beautiful green eyes. A trait that rarely appeared in the Potter family tree- The potion is damaging his mind. I'm using my magic to control and repair the damage, but it needs a potion.
It was not an empty threat. The ministry had the power because the 28 thoroughbred houses had given it to it. But the houses could regain that power at any moment.
-Okay, but just because I want to see your fiancé's face when we see us while he attends with that almost squib to the dance while I take his beautiful and powerful fiancee by my arm
“Not much of a social butterfly, are you?” Ronan jokes. “Come on, half the wizarding world wants to bang you.”
Harry shrugs. “Just something about her, I guess. I saw her yesterday. Couldn’t stop thinking about her ever since.” He internally praises himself for the good save.
Malfoy stands up, resting a hand on the armrest of Harry’s chair, and placing the other one underneath Harry’s chin. Harry freezes, his heart pounding in his chest. He should push him away, but he can’t. He sits there, completely still, his eyes transfixed on Malfoy. “You bastard,” Malfoy snarls. “You arrogant bastard. Think I’ve asked you here to
“Don’t encourage this, Ronald.” She turns back to Harry. “We will find you a boyfriend, Harry. Don’t interact with Malfoy, he’s not good for you.” Harry nods, but he’s still fixated on what Ron had said earlier.
Harry checks the time. 6:00. He has about 20 minutes to kill, so he decides to take a shower. While he’s lathering shampoo through his hair, his mind drifts to the only place that it had been for the past 24 hours—Malfoy. He imagines Malfoy’s naked body, covered in soap, pressed up against his. He pictures his hands running through Malfoy’s platinum hair, while Draco’s lips latch onto his neck, leaving marks he’d have a hard time explaining to his teammates. He quickly lets the thought slip his mind before it can make him hard. He rinses his hair quickly, before stepping out of the shower and putting on his quidditch jersey.
“Okay guys, he’s clearly uncomfortable,” Marcus comments. “No need to push him to spill details. He probably just doesn’t want his love life published in the paper, that’s all.”
“R-right,” Harry replies, shaking his hand quickly. He lets go as fast as he can, not because he doesn’t appreciate the physical contact, but because he’s sweating. “I’m Harry Potter,” he adds impulsively, and then internally scolds himself.
Harry saw Ginny pretty often, but not as much as she liked. As much as he loved her, he didn’t find himself looking forward to their meetings. It wasn’t because he didn’t enjoy her company, it was more that he didn’t enjoy the snogging. Ginny was pretty, intelligent, and fun to be around, but something that Harry couldn’t quite put his finger on, felt off. He assumed he was overthinking it. After all, it had only been a little more than three years after the war, and he was still recovering. Give it some time, and all would be back to normal again, surely.
“I’m telling you,” says a chaser, who’s name he didn’t quite remember. “She’s slept with half of the Chudley Cannons.”
“Of course it isn’t,” she answers. “I don’t think anyone’s naturally bad in bed. Everyone can learn. And if there are people who were just born to suck in the bedroom, it’s not Ginny, that’s for sure.”
He’s almost tempted to go back to Hermione and tell her he wants to quit, but he doesn’t, because that would be stupid. Why would he give up the opportunity of a lifetime because he might be a little bit gay? This wouldn’t last long, and soon enough, things would surely go back to normal. Harry finishes his shower last, and the other guys are outside, chatting. A wiry brunette boy taps Harry on his shoulder. “I’m Marcus. Team captain, chaser. We all go out for drinks every Friday, but since it’s your first day, we figured we’d reschedule for tonight. Care to join us?”
with him? “Of course not,” Draco finally adds. “You insufferable twat. I just called you in to tell you that you catching the Snitch today, well, helped us beat a record. The Magpies are officially the team with the most World Cup wins in Europe.”
Ron’s mouth is hanging open in shock. “Seriously? Malfoy? Harry, I’ve got absolutely no problem with you being gay, but Malfoy?”
Harry swallows his saliva and attempts to remain calm while Malfoy saunters his way over to the broom polishing station. His insides turn to jelly as Malfoy’s eyes meets him, and he begins to polish his broom with unnecessary fervor in some lame attempt to divert his attention. “See something you like, Potter?”
“Yeah,” Harry answers weakly. “That’s a pretty good summary. I just have no idea what to do now. Do I just wait until I’m over him? But how long will that be?”
“I think it’s more of a lust-driven obsession,” Hermione remarks. “Not the healthiest thing to pursue.”
When Harry enters the Three Broomsticks, his teammates are already seated and waving enthusiastically, including Ronan. Well, being the Chosen One did have its perks. Harry had spent the entirety of his childhood neglected by Dursleys and trying not to die, so he wasn’t really aware of what “normal” guys talked about. Probably quidditch and girls.  Harry would certainly have trouble making contributions to the latter.
Ron and Hermione look at each other and Ron raises his eyebrows. “What makes you say that?” Hermione asks calmly.
In an act of childish petulance since he didn’t have any better way of response, Harry sits down again.
“Hey,” the team captain, Marcus, scolds. “Why don’t we start by introducing ourselves, instead of bashing his best friend?”
“I just don’t like talking about my love life,” Harry admits. “Frankly, it’s not going well at all.”
Malfoy drags Harry over the shed where his teammates had stored their broomsticks, and they both sit down. Harry happily complies with Malfoy’s command, using a spell to remove his clothing. His cock is aching and throbbing, and when Malfoy closes his hand around his length, he almost can’t take it. Draco’s strokes are long and teasing, but feel incredible. Harry moans shakily, and Draco picks up the pace, filling Harry with white-hot pleasure. He’d wanked in his room plenty of times, but it never felt anything like this. Maybe it was the fact that it was Malfoy’s hand instead of his own that was making this so intense. He comes embarrassingly fast, but Malfoy doesn’t seem to be bothered, and he licks Harry’s come right off his hand.
“Well, I got over Malfoy quick,” Harry says, the words leaving a sour taste in his mouth. That was perhaps the biggest lie he’s ever told. “So, back to Ronan.”
“That’s what I thought,” Malfoy states coldly. “You’re so impossibly good that you’re vile. Trying to reform Death Eaters to improve your already squeaky-clean reputation? Well, guess what, Potter, you’re not using me to fulfill your next hero project.”
Harry’s heart nearly stops. Again? What could Malfoy possibly want this time? He stands up, his legs feeling like jelly, which he’s sure has nothing to do with the quidditch match. He collects himself, ignoring his heart pounding in his ears, and heads over to Malfoy’s tent.
Harry manages an appreciative smile, and returns to putting on his knee pads. For the next three weeks, he starts a routine. Wake up at 6:20, take a shower, get ready for practice, take another shower after practice, wank away the frustration, go drinking at the Three Broomsticks, ignore Ron and Hermione’s pressing questions, and sleep. His friends grow increasingly worried about him for the next few weeks, and Harry wants to yell at Ron for telling him he’d get over Malfoy quickly, but he doesn’t, because it’s not Ron’s fault. This wasn’t the first time he’s shut them out—it wasn’t a big deal. He knows they won’t understand his feelings. How could they, if he couldn’t even understand them himself?
Draco was bored and horny and had no intention of doing this again. Maybe their conversation would ensure that they were no longer enemies, but definitely not friends. And most certainly not lovers.
Hermione, as usual, was right—but that didn’t mean that he had to listen. He wouldn’t mind learning his lesson the hard way if it meant he got to live out his fantasies, even for one night.
The man finishes first and makes no attempt to get Harry off afterwards. He leaves abruptly, not even bothering to stay the night. Shamefully, he realizes that he’d spent the entire time thinking about Malfoy. His idea to hook up with a Muggle in order to forget about Draco was probably his most unsuccessful endeavor to date, and he almost wishes that he would have asked Hermione for advice, but he’s afraid that she’d call him foolish. And that would sting, because he knows in the back of his mind, that she’d be right. Harry has to remind himself he doesn’t like Malfoy, and never will. He acknowledges his burning desire to sleep with him, but reasons with himself that sex doesn’t mean love. Clearly that was true from tonight’s experience.
“Didn’t think you would be the type, honestly,” Ron says. “I always reckoned you were more for serious relationships.”
“Of course,” Malfoy continues, “I tried tearing up your contract. But the stupid things are charmed.” He takes Harry’s contract from the envelope, rips it apart, only for the pieces to reassemble again. “I own the Magpies, but I don’t own the entire league, so there’s nothing I can do to kick you out now.” Malfoy slams his hand on the table, and while leaning forward towards Harry, he practically spits, “so don’t fuck it up, Potter, or your quidditch career will be over faster than you can wipe the drool off your chin.”
Ronan seems to be satisfied with Harry’s choice, and nods in approval. “A pretty girl for sure. Too young for me, but yeah, definitely. So, what about her’s got your knickers in a twist?”
Harry wakes up early the next morning, something he hasn’t done in a while. Professional sports, even quidditch, was no walk in the park. The coach had requested everyone be present by 7 AM sharp, so Harry woke up at 6, had a quick breakfast, before standing in front of the mirror and trying to get his hair in order to no avail. He makes his way to the locker rooms at 6:50, and when he walks in, it sounds more like a pub than a changing space for athletes. When he walks in, the chatter stops abruptly, and everyone turns around and greets him.
“Not necessarily surprising,” Ron answers, “you and Malfoy have  always been rather obsessed with each other.”
He looks around at the assortment of guys in the bar, not overwhelmed with his options. Most of them were completely inebriated, while one couple was engaging in activities he thought would have been more appropriate behind closed doors. Harry scans the bar for any blondes, and sighs, feeling defeated and completely pathetic. He imagines what Ron would say if he told him he’d hook up with anyone who bore a slight resemblance to Draco Malfoy.
The Quidditch World Cup does provide him with some much-needed distraction from his nearly month-long moping over Malfoy. Being Harry Potter had its advantages—he got first pick for his roommate. He debates between Ronan and Marcus. He decides on Ronan. He was pretty easy to talk to, and also the only bloke that could even compete with Malfoy for his attention.
Ronan snorts. “No way. Would have never guessed. So you’ve got really bad girl problems? Let me guess, you like some chick that’s way older than you. Mommy issues?”
Ron’s jaw drops. “The Montrose Magpies? The greatest Quidditch team in the UK?” He elbows Harry. “Let’s go, mate.”
Harry redresses himself with shaky hands, completely red in the face, and still shivering from the aftershocks of his orgasm.
Harry has never found himself to be particularly attractive, and he assumed all the attention he received from girls at Hogwarts was simply because he was the Chosen One. But considering how wasted everyone seemed to be, he didn’t think he’d have too much difficulty finding a guy to bring home. Harry spots a decent-looking blonde boy from the corner of the dance floor, and decides that he’d suffice. He’s never been much of a flirt, not even with women, let alone men, so he hopes that a couple of drinks would help him muster up some confidence. He realizes that he’s never ordered Muggle alcohol, and searches his mind for anything that the bar might have.
Harry reminds himself. Malfoy straightens his tie, and despite the thousands of people surrounding them, Harry feels like he’s staring directly at him. Their eyes meet, and Harry shudders, under Malfoy’s intimidating, yet unfathomably attractive, glare. He can hear Malfoy’s voice in his head saying, “
Harry knows it’ll be a long time before he’ll ever find a boyfriend--he couldn’t imagine himself dating a Muggle, but he didn’t think he could ever come out without having his face all over the front page of the Prophet. He can already picture the headlines, and he cringes. He leaves Ron and Hermione a note, letting them know he’ll be gone for the night, and heads off to the club. When he enters, the smell of alcohol fills the room, and Muggle music that he hasn’t heard in more than a decade is blasting through the speakers.
Harry desperately tries to tear his eyes away, but he doesn’t, and allows himself to give in, even more overwhelmed by how much he loves Malfoy’s body. “Who knew that golden boy Harry Potter fancied blokes?” Malfoy teases cruelly. “Not very saint-like of you, is it? I bet the Daily Prophet’s going to have loads of fun with that little tidbit.”
Harry’s heart thumps in his chest, and he stands up. Malfoy laughs coldly. “Why so obedient, Potter?” He takes a sip of his firewhisky and continues, “must be your nature. Didn’t you do everything Dumbledore asked of you? Of course you did. You’re really such a saint, aren’t you?”
Harry Apparates back home, and realizes that it’s midnight. Hermione and Ron are still on the couch, and they immediately bombard him with a barrage of questions. “Where were you?” Hermione inquires worriedly, and Ron adds, “how was practice?”
“For the pleasure of your company?” Malfoy suggests, leaning forward in his seat, looking him directly in the eye. Harry’s mouth goes as dry as chalk. Was Malfoy
“Well, he’s an asshole,” Harry says. “A terrible person. But ridiculously hot. He kept...touching me. Like, he kept grabbing my chin. And he kept mocking me. He said, ‘do you like when blokes touch you, Potter’ and ‘we could’ve had lots of fun.’ What could that possibly mean?”
So you're bent, too. Wow. I am rather shocked. I don't know why, it seems a little obvious now that I'm thinking back on it. But you always struck me as really masculine and really proud. I mean, there's not a wrong way to be bent. It just didn't occur to me that you would be. As my own bentness didn't occur to me. I'm not even 100% positive what color Ginny's eyes are. (We were never really together, but that's a story for another letter, perhaps.) But I know what color yours are. Is it a bent thing? We just pick up on these things subconsciously, while we're struggling to remain alive due to threat of evil wizards, and our subconscious just doesn't inform us until we're drunk and kissing an American on the beach?
The indignation!  The absolute absurdity!  To accuse me—ME—of failing to date my letters!  And just when I thought we were beginning to be friend
-Can I stay with him? Even if he's asleep- Sirius had suffered the scare of his life seeing his half-dead brother and didn't want to get away from him yet.
Euphemia fainted at the party celebrating the birth of the next Black heir and woke up to a happy Fleamont by her side.
The children began to laugh louder and the adults turned in time to see some silver locks take the shape of a doe next to the falcon's patronus. The locks came from Heather
-No, I have married you because I love you. But, from a pragmatic point of view, you were a very tempting candidate for a wife. A shame that I have already taken you
Tom watched her from the doorway. She took a rose from the vase and put it on Tom's lapel, one more way to mark it as hers
But something changed in Ron in his third year. Suddenly he grew four hands. Well, Harriet looked ridiculous in the five-foot hers next to the eight-foot-seven boy.
- What happened to you? - Harriet knew that the headmaster was not talking for the sake of talking, so she must have known his feelings for Draco
-And what truth did you say? - The man looked at the wizard who was angry at the edge of the camp, without going through his protections
The marriage was annulled, the family lost their seat and they would be imprisoned for life. At least the members who were involved in the line robbery. And now her ex-husband was asking her to come back.
Regulus watched as her uncle Fleamont dropped the locket into a potion that was a mixture of Basilisk poison and pure acid. The object screeched in agony before being consumed and disposed of.
Hagrid was a little green and Rose Marie told him to go have something to settle her stomach while she was with the dressmaker, Madame Malkin
- I don't… Kiii- Harriet leaned forward after receiving a spanking on her butt, hard enough to sting but not enough to hurt- What are you doing, Riddle?
Arinna would be laughing at that for hours when they were in private. At the table were a couple of men who were not teachers and who were clearly nervous looking at the freshmen.
Remus was never able to keep his promise. It was late when he arrived. They barely heard his screams to demand a fair trial for his partner, his Sirius, and no one told him where the children were. Remus swore that if he ever found them he would protect them from everyone
- Professor Snape is still in love, and I think your mother is happy in her own way. But I know they would have been even happier if they had stayed together. Don't repeat their history, make a new path
-Miss Heather, it's not good to take baths so early in the day. She could catch a cold- The elf began to run the towel over the girl's body, hoping to dry it quickly, after giving Severus a towel
It was true that the gypsies had a reputation for being poor, because they did not cling to material possessions or remain stuck in one place, they traveled like the wind. Free and without limits
* But just as a test, I want to get to know each other a little more before starting to introduce you to my parents * Tom was an orphan and the magical tradition dictated that Harriet being the heir to a house with more history than the Gaunt
Walburga pushed his entire Black woman side out as he looked at the matron. She had known nothing but Vile Muggles when dealing with magical children
-I know, but I'm in the middle of a couple of doses of vaccines that I had missed. I can't eat at certain times- Severus grimaced. The magic vaccines were very effective, but if you did not take them well the side effects were worse than the disease itself
Euphemia was meeting with the former Black Lord. Arcturus Black was a good man, he had always treated her well being a few years older than her. Had it not been for Fleamont she would have married him after his first wife's ill health left her in the grave. Fortunately for both of them, and against all odds, Arcturus's wife almost reached old age.
But Ravenclaw was very disciplined, so Picquery was looking around more than at her own team. And Tom had seen her pass the window at least three times. Additionally, Picquery was known to be an impressive gossip. Tom knew that before tonight the whole school would know that the Gryffindor princess was his, if the marks he had left on her neck weren't enough to mark her.
The arrival at the castle had been good. Everything was magical and the boats rocked just enough that she had to be sheltered in the chest of her Alpha until they reached the shore.
-I understand… What eternal glory is there in such a rigged and calculated tournament? - Magnolia sighed- Diggory was forced to participate by his father to help him in his future career and my brother had his name put up without his consent. This tournament is as free choice as the chains on the feet of a slave- The boy laughed at Magnolia's words
I wouldn't leave a single place without kissing, licking, or biting. She could only moan his name when he was done with her
Lord Black and Lord Lupine. The men who had reported her missing. She had wanted to meet them for years, but was afraid that Dumbledore would take her away from her family. They were the best friends of her biological parents
The wizarding world, at least Great Britain, celebrated the fall of a dark wizard. Zefrina thought that Dumbledore was worse than Voldemort, but no one would listen to a gypsy witch. But she had traveled, she had seen the world.
Well, now I'm just making myself sad. I'm really not so sad, it's just another thing to come to terms with in my weird life.
You'll have to skip down to the bottom if you want them, because I'm mortified, and need to focus on another aspect of your letter that concerns me.
But back to what CONCERNS me. Like... do you like women, at all? You mentioned that it's irrelevant to Purebloods as long as you do your duty by the family name, which I'm putting two and two together here and assuming that means you need to have a baby. That seems so invalidating. I'd hate that. Does it bother you? What are you going to do about that, if you don't like being with women? I realize this is all rather personal and if you don't want to share, that's okay. I'm really just stalling, though generally very interested and curious about your answers.
Absolutely not!  I don't even know if I'm going to appeal, when the opportunity comes.  What is there for me to go back to?  The Manor is gone, my friends are in prison or exile like myself, my mother is here with me, and the number of British wizards who don't look at me and see my father, see the Dark Lord's right hand, I could count on one hand.  Anyway, I couldn't bear to be any more in your debt than I already am.  Thank you, but no.
I have bad news.  I'm afraid I saw the Greengrass girls in Diagon Alley today, and they made not the slightest attempt to converse with me.  They used to be such polite girls.  It seems plain from this behaviour that Miss Greengrass has abandoned her engagement with you.  I have not given up, however, and am determined to find a suitable partner for you.  It's a shame.  Miss Greengrass always seemed so fond of you in school.
I've never told anybody anything so personal. I mean, sure, the world knows I pretty much died and came back to life, and they know the intimate details of my mother's pre-teen love life, and weirdly blame her for turning Snape into who he was (I mean, what WAS that Skeeter article? GROSS) and they know all about my parents' death, and about their relationship with their friends, and how they were betrayed, and on and on. The world knows these details about my life, but those details aren't me, you know? They are things that either happened before I was born, or things I genuinely had no control over or real choice regarding. This is the first time in my life I've had space to figure out anything so personal. And I want you to know I'm not telling you lightly. It means a lot to me that it's you. It's giving me some much needed hope in this world of ours.  I mean, if we can let bygones be bygones, anyone can.
Of course I spoke at the trials. Yours, and dozens and dozens of others. It was no hardship to speak the truth. Somehow I was in possension of the truth when no one else was, I could prove it to the Wizengamot in the Pensieve. I was the only one who could save you and your mum from losing years of your life in Azkaban unnecessarily. Anyone would have done the same.
I write to thank you for your efforts on my mother's behalf and on my own. We neither of us had any expectation of seeing you at our trials; the evidence against us was strong enough to satisfy the Wizengamot's desire for a public eradication of Death Eater sentiment. Certainly we never imagined that you would appear to testify in favor of our acquittal; and then, in my case, in favor of leniency when acquittal was impossible. You had much to do, and my mind still boggles that you were willing—that you wanted, you insisted on coming to our defense. I do not ask you why; I write with no expectation of a reply. I simply cannot allow the depths of my gratitude to remain unknown. Perhaps what you did for us means little to you, but it means the world to us. We owe you our freedom. More than freedom, we owe you our dignity. Even my father owes you a debt of gratitude, for the work you and Ms Granger did in removing the Dementors from Azkaban. Please, if it seems appropriate to your judgment, pass my thanks on to Ms Granger as well; it is a great comfort to my mother to know that he is not held by those creatures, and a great comfort to me to think that she may visit him. I am not sure I would if I could, but I am spared that decision by the fact of my exile.
It's wild here, untamed. But safe enough if one takes the proper precautions. It reminds me a bit of the Forbidden Forest. And there's a cave here, not a proper cave because it doesn't extend very far inwards, but it reminds me of a place Dumbledore took me to once last year. That was a horrible experience, but this place is on the opposite end of the spectrum of caves. Tourists are here, laughing and awestruck and safe, and I can... process, or whatever.
Do I regret the choices I've made? I can't be sure. Maybe turning a certain way down the corridors during the final battle, I would have been able to save Fred, or Remus or Tonks. Maybe I could have fit a third person on the broomstick in the Room of Requirement. But how can I know? How could I have known. What if I had grabbed your hand in Malfoy Manor when Dobby Apparated us all, and gotten you out, too? Gotten my arm stuck with the knife that instead went through Dobby and killed him? Maybe if I'd done anything else in any of those circimstsances, someone else would have died.
Something else I'm doing is thinking of Dumbledore an awful lot. Not missing him, or mourning him, because I've done enough of that, but just thinking through what his actual thought processes must have been, in real time. I can't discuss this with Ron or Hermione or anyone else, because for them, it hasn't been enough time. They can't imagine him in any other way but as a saintly old man who somehow saved us all with his overarching, far-reaching quickwittedness, even from beyond the grave.
Unless you need me at the estate this winter, I believe I'll be staying here through the New Year; you can expect me in early January.  The weather is horrid, of course, and many of the best families are wintering on the Continent, but there is still some decent society to be had in London.  I have high hopes that the Parkinsons might see reason where Miss Greengrass failed to.
I want my father back.  I want my childhood back.  I want to be four years old again and carried home, safe.  Fuck him.
As for holding back, it seems I hardly know how.  I tell you more than I'm accustomed to telling anyone.  For all I keep trying not to dwell on the war, it keeps on coming back to that.  Maybe it always will.
I’m glad you’re all doing as well as you are, and that you have your dignity. Even Lucius. Dementors are ridiculous and have no place near people, but neither did it seem right to just exterminate them or whatever, you know? Hermione’s experiments with volcanism and the creation of Grey Island for them was genius. I’ll get your thanks to her in the next letter I send. She was here in Iceland last week doing more research on the latent magical properties of volcanoes or something, under the pretense of visiting me. (In fact that is probably why she handed me the Iceland brochure that day at the Portkey office in the first place. Haha, I’ve been played.) It really is super interesting though, she thinks Katla is going to blow sometime soon, within the next five years, definitely. I hope I’m still here for it, for whatever reason. Extreme catharsis? I don’t know.
Which is a good reason to stay in Iceland, I suppose.  Have you mentioned how long you intend to stay there? I don't think you have.  If you think you'll still be there in the spring—well, I shouldn't presume.  For the moment, I don't want to leave my mother alone, with the winter holidays coming up, and it seems like Iceland may not be as pleasant to visit in the winter.  Thank you for the invitation, though.
Keeping this written here as my official intention, so that everyone knows why I’m in pieces across the Arctic Circle, in case that’s the way this all goes down.
I suppose that means classes have started at Hogwarts.  Unless they're still rebuilding?  I haven't kept up with the news from home.  Have you?  If I'd thought about it, I'd have expected you and your friends to have gone back for your NEWTs.  If I were confident that I was right about that, I might then reason that Hogwarts is not open, but I'm not confident.  I don't think I've ever been right, when it comes to you.  For instance, I would never have guessed that you could cook.  Or that you would retreat from your adoring public to hide away where no one knows your name or what you've done.  On rereading, that sounds mocking.  I don't mean it that way.  Rather, I mean to mock myself.  There's not much I haven't been wrong about.
What do I DO though. Well. Every morning, I wake up and have a cup of instant coffee, and do my share in cooking breakfast in the communal kitchen with whichever guests happen to have stayed the night before. It's always a different assortment of people, and it's always interesting, learning about where some complete stranger has been, where they are from. I'm going by the name Henry, and I have to say, it's very different relating to people here. Different in a way I don't think I've ever experienced before. I went from no one wanting to talk to me or take any interest in me, to having the entire bleeding world overly concerned about every aspect of my life... to just... being a normal bloke, all of sudden. No one bats an eye when I tell them my scar is from a car crash. No one thinks twice. I don't really know what to do with such normalcy, I guess, because as soon as breakfast is over, I hightail it out of there and start my usual daily walk.
The Girl Who Lived existed, but she was no longer the subject of a prophecy that bound her like the chains of a curse.
Magnolia was standing next to her Aunt Andy as they entered the white mansion. Everything here was white, the flowers, the peacocks, the roads and the house. It was like everything was so pure
The image of someone shone in his mind. It was true that she had to go out into the world sometime in the next few years, but that didn't mean that James liked the idea.
-Very attractive, inside and out.- the door of the room opened and a funny James looked at his friends
"Any woman raised in the Black household with no blood ties to the family must bear a child to the family or marry a male from the Black family."
-No. The only people who know this are you and me. And maybe the goblins. That is why I insisted on destroying the mural that was a copy of the family tree. You were tied to Regulus with a blood tie, not the silver tie of sponsorship like Harry
-I'm your sister, also, that man insists that I have to have a formal education- Arinna smiled as she referred to her father
-The fact that he can do things that you cannot does not mean that he is possessed. My decision is firm, I will adopt him.
Millicent opened the prophet to see the new law of blood marriages created by Minister Hermione Granger. Her Muggle-born husband caressed Millicent's bulging belly within which their son was growing.
And the only one in the high-ranking political landscape who would listen to what Millicent had to say and do something about it.
It wasn't that they were asexual or anything like that, from his ungrateful teaching experience he could tell for sure that all teenagers went through a period of heat.
She was not criticizing him, courage was something that also characterized her. But fine was the line between courage and idiocy. It didn't matter how brave they were and how strong, if they didn't have some brains they wouldn't last
The girls went to the part of the store that was theirs and took their drawing supplies to start preparing the magic circle. In each new place her mother learned a new magic and the three of them. Of course the difficulty level of the magic was different. But the girls had been studying magic since the age of three
- I think we have to notify Dumbledore and the Ministry- the last word was said with the same joy as if he had said that kittens had to be gutted.
James ran his fingers over the images of magical creatures and beautiful landscapes that decorated the walls. He saw a young elf, less than ten years old, carefully cleaning the game room.
Harriet launched into a kiss to Tom and they both ended up tangled and naked on the floor of the empty classroom.
She looked at the girls, watching as the ritual was completed and their names were engraved in the language of the gypsies on their wrists.
Harriet Potter came from a long line of Gryffindors. From a family of great lineage and tradition, only tainted by the addition of her Muggle-born mother. However, finding the sword a week after classes started raised it to the same position as the Purebloods. Sword that she now wore on her waist with pride, demonstrating her position as a Gryffindor princess
-What the hell do you think?- She said as she led him to the kitchen discreetly. -She's just stopped being a girl.
Millicent knew it very well. She was broader in the shoulders than most teenagers and physically large, luckily she was also muscular and not fat. Her mother only talked about her to complain about something
The groom was supposed to be the only one who could remove it, but that was fine. The boy needed time to adjust to his new body.
Tom took the book and turned its pages curiously. After a few minutes an eerie laughter spread throughout the underground chamber.
An outstanding lady who drew the attention of Arcturus Black from the cradle to be the next Lady of the family and empower the Black blood in the next generation. Raised as a brood mare all her life to marry a man who despised her and become pregnant at least before her fifth wedding anniversary.
Her fiancé was there before her, flirting with Lavender Brown. It wasn't that she cared about Ron, rather she hated him. Much, hard. The boy had destroyed any positive feelings she had for him in her childhood
Harriet watched the man leave and looked at the chocolate in her hand. She put it in her mouth feeling the freshness, the acidity and how sour it was. Yet it was delicious
- Well, you wear the Potter shield closing your cape and I don't say anything- Magnolia smiled amusedly. Then she touched the necklace with the Black emblem that was under her clothes.
Magnolia looked at Remus. The man had taken her aside while Harry was having a hookup time with Sirius. Or playing with Ron. Or something. Magnolia had had a really hard time preventing things from being dumped from Grimauld Place.
-Only you can use the bag and if you don't use them, the unused galleons will be kept in the bag- said the goblin- You were supposed to give this bag to you on the day you turn five, when your parents bring it to the bank . It is an honor to be able to give it to you at last
She couldn't support the friend of man, the one who was causing a war by stirring up the pride of the thoroughbreds who felt outnumbered by Muggle-borns.
It was a crime of line theft, the premeditated murder of future heirs to a noble house. And he was recognized before the majority of the Greek council and many journalists. Of course, the family tried to pass it off as the woman was drunk. But then she was questioned with veritaserum before the council
-The child's lineage is clear, he is the son of James Fleamont Potter. The girl, on the other hand, has Black blood in her veins. She is the daughter of Regulus Arcturus Black- Said the goblin with a grunt- As the daughter of the only non-repudiated heir of the Black lineage that makes her the owner of the family fortune, despite the fact that her father has already passed away.
The tree Neville planted on their wedding day. And now he was planting a flowering bush to celebrate Harriet's pregnancy.
Sirius felt even more like a scoundrel for doing what he was going to do, yet he couldn't help it. It was burning him insides
The point was, the Potters were money, very abundant and very old. They wouldn't mind if someone less fortunate took an ingredient or two. So it wasn't bad for him to take one or two rare and valuable ingredients. There were three greenhouses, one for Muggle plants, one for non-harmful magic, and one for harmful magic.
Harry raised his hand to his chest. It was squishy. Harry straightened up and felt more of his chest. That was a lush female breast, seriously, huge. He couldn't cover it completely, even if his hands were four times as big, they were almost the size of his head.
When they got to the top they had to take a couple of strokes to get to the surface of the pond behind the property. The girl was swimming to the shore where there was already a house elf waiting for her.
James' parents gave a big welcome after the aurors helped them get off the carriage pulled by thestralls. The older couple did not let them enter the residence and dismissed the aurors politely
Memories of Walburga hit Harry hard. The eldest daughter of a secondary branch of the Black family. A witch of outstanding appearance, lineage, and power. Daughter of Pollux and Irma Black.
James and he had known each other since…. He couldn't even remember it. But it had never been there. It was always James who came to visit him. His mother had taken it very seriously to educate the heir, not letting his grandfather take him out of the house without permission.
-It seems the time has come- her two eleven-year-old daughters looked at her- This is your letter to Hogwarts, Lelwani
Fleamont had thrown his cup of tea on the man from the Ministry who had come to see them. Euphemia was on her feet and furious too
-Yes, the contraceptive potion was a success. We will have to do it more times and I can make Sirius fall in love
-What is a husband? - Magnolia asked looking at her aunt Andy, but Draco is the one who stepped forward and looked at her
James Fleamont Potter was staying in the south wing of Potter Manor. His parents were staying in the central wing and the guests were in the north wing. The south wing had been created specifically to take care of the family's children. There were many protection spells in case the house was raided to protect the children of the family. And portkeys the elves could use in a pinch
The man from the ministry got up and left angrily saying that next time it would be the same minister who would go
Heather followed Opal to the north wing and there she trembled with excitement. She had been so nervous ...
-She's almost a squib? And why did they bring her to the Triwizard tournament? - Magnolia looked very surprised. He had assumed that everyone who came was great talents, the best of each school.
Even though Harry doesn’t know the girl, he feels the need to defend her. “Sod off, Malfoy, she’s working for you. Show her some respect.”
“Of course not,” Ronan replies. “Your secret is safe with me. Albert gives me homophobic vibes to be honest, so if you ever want to come out, please be careful.”
“Well, it’s now or never, I guess,” Harry begins. “You know how I always get really awkward when you guys ask me about my love life?”
Harry makes no effort to hide his frustration, and he’s so deep in his own thoughts that he forgets he can use
“You want the boys too, Potter?” Ronan teases. “Greedy, aren’t you?” He has a point though. Despite the fact the spotlight sort of followed him everywhere he went, he didn’t care much for it. He didn’t need or want the attention of anyone who he didn’t care for. This was going to be difficult to explain to Ginny.
“Amelia McMillan,” Bryce answers. “She’s a waitress here. I hooked up with her at least year’s championships, and now she’s writing to me again for some reason.”
He smiles weakly. “Thank you for thinking that way about me, but really, a lot of people. Perhaps everyone who’s ever been a Slytherin?”
“Hermione, you’re a miracle worker,” Harry comments and she grins. Surprisingly, Ron was the only out of the three that found a decent job after finishing up their 8th year at Hogwarts. Hermione hated the ministry with a passion, and Harry decided that he didn’t really want to be an Auror, and that his desire to be one in the past the result of him being squeezed into the mold of a “hero.” Although Hermione admittedly wasn’t much of an athlete, Harry suggested she become a manager for aspiring professional quidditch players. Initially, of course, she thought it was a horrible idea, but Hermione’s wisdom ensured that she found success right away.
he doing this? He supposes he doesn’t really care to convince Malfoy that he wasn’t such a terrible person after all, and more to justify to himself that it was alright to want to shag him. He doesn’t want to tell Malfoy that of course, so he remains silent.
“You talk too much,” Harry replies simply, taking him in again, using his hands to compensate for what he can’t get into his mouth.
Harry nods curtly and makes his way to the office. He nearly wets himself when he opens the door. “M-malfoy?” But this isn’t the Malfoy he remembers from Hogwarts. This isn’t the pointy-faced Malfoy that always used far too much hair gel. This Malfoy radiated authority and dominance that made Harry’s knees buckle. He’s wearing a suit that looks like it was perfectly tailored to fit him, and his blue eyes are as icy and piercing as ever. This Malfoy was gorgeous. Harry quickly sits down before he can do anything stupid.
Harry tells Ginny the good news anyway, and invites her to the Three Broomsticks to celebrate, which he figures is the best way to spend time with her without having to snog her. He usually orders a butterbeer, but knowing that he won’t be allowed to drink much once he starts his contract with the Montrose Magpies, he opts for a firewhisky instead. Or perhaps more than one. Ginny gets sloshed too, and by the end of the night, their speech is slurred and they can hardly walk straight.
Draco moans. “Oh fuck…” Harry, motivated by the encouragement, tries to take Malfoy down his throat again. He gets farther than last time, but he’s still a few inches away from the base. “You’re such a fucking slut, Potter.”
“Well, listen,” Ronan replies. “I wish you the best of luck. I doubt she’d say no to you, for real. But hey, the Quidditch World cup is in three weeks. Something to look forward to, right?”
“Maybe I should supervise practice more often,” Malfoy comments, buttoning his trousers and shirt. Without as much as another glance, he’s off. A wave of disappointment washes over Harry, and he sighs, the post-orgasmic bliss lasting for a much shorter time than it should have.
Marcus shrugs. “I’m not sure. I have no idea why he would want to kick you off the team, you’re way better than our other Seeker. If we ever lost, it was because he couldn’t catch the damn Snitch. Well, Coach and I will see what we can do.”
Burning with desire, he takes Malfoy’s cock into his hand, and circles the tip with his tongue. Harry licks a stripe down his entire length, before finally taking him into his mouth. He’d sucked a cock once before, when he’d gone to a Muggle bar and picked a bloke for a one-night stand. He had done it only to please the man enough that he would hopefully fuck away his feelings towards Malfoy, but this was different. He wanted this to be something Malfoy would never forget, because Harry was sure he’d never forget this for as long as he lived.
Something about Malfoy calling him a slut makes his cock twitch in his pants. Harry considered himself to be more of a power bottom than a submissive one from his previous experience at the bar the other night, but there was something about Malfoy that made him want to submit completely. Harry sucks Malfoy’s cock furiously, taking as much as he can each time, occasionally swirling his tongue around the tip. Malfoy’s not talking anymore, letting out deep, ragged moans that drive Harry to the point of insanity.
The fans begin filing into the stadium, the box seats still empty, as they were reserved for special guests. Harry had reserved three of them for Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, and they arrive in a few minutes, waving to him enthusiastically. A few more people arrive, which Harry assumes are his teammates’s friends and family. Three suited men have a seat, and Harry gulps when the final man has a seat.
“We know, Harry,” Hermione reassures him. “Ginny is always understanding. And as Ron said, you two will have no problem finding someone else. You’ll always be good friends. But it probably won’t even come to the point where you’ll have to break up.”
He didn’t really understand why they had sex so often. He never questioned it in the past, but after his night with Ginny, he was wondering how they could possibly enjoy it that much. “Sex is overrated,” Harry blurts out at breakfast.
“Bloody hell,” Ron interjects. “First you were shagging my sister, then you realize you’re gay for one of your teammates, and all of a sudden you’re gay for Malfoy?” Hermione rolls her eyes in response.
Harry shudders. He was in the bath. He was alone. He’d just won the Magpies another break. He comes to the conclusion that he needs to give himself a well-deserved break. His hand moves down to his cock, and he strokes it a few times, before closing his eyes and imagining Malfoy again. He comes on his hand in a matter of minutes, and sighs, knowing he’d wanked more in the past month than he did his entire time at Hogwarts. Harry finds it foolish how Malfoy kept telling him not to fuck things up, when Malfoy ruins everything. All he wants to do is sit down with Ron, have a drink, and complain for hours, but he knows he can’t. Ron would call him stupid, and he couldn’t be mad, because Ron would be completely justified in doing so.
Harry debates whether to lie or not, but decides it doesn’t matter, because Hermione would probably coax the truth out of him. “Erm, it went alright.”
Malfoy is taken aback, so much so, that he can't even think of a snide remark to reply with. “Are you offering what I think you’re offering?”
While he lathers shampoo through his hair, he gives into temptation, and sees Ronan stepping out of the shower, his blonde hair damp and a towel wrapped around his lower body. His heart thumps in his chest, and he feels blood rushing to his cock. Harry winces in humiliation, even though he’s pretty sure nobody noticed. He should’ve known this before joining an all-male sports team. But then again, he’d never had time to think about things like his sexuality. How would he ever face Ronan again, knowing that he had inadvertently made him hard? Harry vows to never use the showers in the locker room ever again, even if his odor could be smelt from a mile away.
The bathroom has a tub and a shower, but Harry decides to get into the bathtub. He turns on the tap, which fills the tub with multicolored water and fragrant bubbles. He’s reminded of his experience in the prefect’s bathroom fourth year, with Moaning Myrtle. He laughs at the memory. He pictures Malfoy, with his button-up white shirt, undoing the buttons, sliding off his trousers, and joining him in the bath. He imagines how big Malfoy’s cock must be, and his stomach flips. He’s guilty and disappointed with himself as ever, but he allows himself to close his eyes and enjoy getting lost in his thoughts. Images of Malfoy’s naked body fill his head, as well as images of Malfoy’s hands all over him, lathering him in soap, closing his hand around Malfoy’s hard cock...
Harry shrugs. “I guess you’re right. I just really don’t want our relationship to suffer, you know? I love her, I really do.”
Harry smiles and decides he likes Marcus. “Likewise.” He apparates home to see Ron and Hermione cuddled up to each other on the couch, watching a Muggle TV show, while Ron expresses his confusion.
“Right,” Harry affirms, although there’s an edge of doubt in his voice. “Well, I’m going to go take a shower.”
Harry gives Ginny a goodbye kiss before he leaves, and luckily, she doesn’t mention last night. He loves her—there’s no doubt about that—but thinking about sex was never anything Harry had time for. Not in his teenage years certainly, and even though things are better now, the trauma hasn’t gone away. He still has nightmares. He misses Sirius and Remus every day. Perhaps he just wasn’t ready for this. When he returns home, the sheets in Ron and Hermione’s room are in disarray, leaving Harry with no doubt of what they were up to when he was gone.
He wakes up again at 5 AM, and decides not to go back to sleep. He gets up and opens up the pile of letters on his bedside table. There’s a few from old friends at Hogwarts—Neville, Dean, Luna. He’s too tired to write back to them, so he places them aside and makes a note to himself to respond to the letters after practice. He goes through the rest of the stack, most of them being from girls who were desperate to date him. He makes his way to the final letter, and his heart nearly stops. He looks at the name printed on the envelope again, to make sure he wasn’t hallucinating.
“I really hate it when I don’t have the answers,” Hermione comments. “But I can’t be sure of the right course of action to take until you have your feelings entirely sorted out.”
Harry decides to make his presence known before barging in. Malfoy replies with a particularly spiteful, “come in, Potter.” When he enters, Draco is sitting in a lounge chair, his jacket hanging on the chair next to him, with the top two buttons of his dress shirt unbuttoned. A half-finished glass of firewhisky sits on the table beside him. Harry gulps and sits down, to which Malfoy answers, “did I say that you could make yourself comfortable?”
I think you should come visit me in Iceland. It’s an island Voldemort couldn’t hope to have touched. The magic here would have destroyed what was left of him before he ever could have set foot. It’s so pure and new, simple but profoundly, deeply moving. I think it would give you some hope, as it’s given me.
I'm not big on wine, myself. I don't think alcohol in general is good for me right now. I had a few pints with Hermione last night, and that was all well and good, but mostly I'm here on my own, and apparently I'm a maudlin drunk when left to my own devices. Fun fact: alcohol was illegal here in Iceland til about 10 years ago. The local nightlife in the bigger town of Reykjavik, about an hour's drive from here, is a little over the top. It's like they're still making up for lost partying time. I can't say I relate or understand. Best I just avoid it.
Like what just happened with Andrew the American Muggle before I came in to write you this letter. I can't believe I'm about to tell you about this, but, I'm drunksy, I've started, I've got to. And weirdly, I want to tell you.
As for Hogwarts, it's not September in particular but all of autumn.  It's a beautiful season, of course, and I wanted to love it the way my father did, but it's always made me melancholy, as long as I can remember.  He used to take me on long walks through the grounds to cheer me up.  We'd run through the big drifts of leaves kicking them up in the air, and he'd make them spin around me, and I'd laugh and dance around and try to catch them out of the air until I was exhausted, and he'd pick me up and carry me back to the Manor, and Mama would smile and call us disgraceful and pick a leaf out of his hair, and we'd all sit in the east parlor with a cup of cocoa and he'd read us poetry until he thought I was falling asleep.  And that was all lovely, of course, but it was fleeting; as soon as it was over I'd feel sad again, or—or tired, or heavy, or...  It's hard to describe.  It's like being under a heavy, wet wool blanket, all the time.  It's a melancholy season, is all, and I never really come out of it entirely until spring.
This letter is embarrassing, but what isn't?  My whole existence is embarrassing.  I'm not drunk, I just haven't been sleeping.  Don't worry, it's not because of you; it's part of what winter does to me.  This is a bad one.  I haven't been this idle before, or this alone.
Anyway.  I'll send this one expedited; if it does arrive before last night's letter, perhaps you'd be so kind as to send the other back unread?  Perhaps that's asking too much.  Transatlantic expedition is hardly a simple business, either, so perhaps it's already arrived by the time you get this.
Thanks for writing to me even though I'm gay. Woo-hoo gay friend times. (Are we friends? Is my obnoxious anxiety over it all coming through clearly?)
I don’t have “something like feelings”, I have full on feelings. I’m here in Iceland, I’m supposed to be looking for something out here, and this happening with you… it’s all part of my time here, my journey towards… um, myself? It’s really surprising and I’m pinching myself constantly, but I’m  here for this.
Nothing has been worthwhile at all the past week or two, while I have been sat here wondering if you might hate me again for what I said.
I'll leave the rest to your sordid imagination. I'm still a virgin, but that's about all I held onto out there that day. I know it's old fashioned, but I take penetration incredibly seriously, and I don't want to do it if I'm not in love, and vice versa. He wanted to, but I wasn't ready, and I wasn't in love. He was an attractive man (he's gone home now) but not my type for love. Is that horrible? Good enough for the physical aspect of things, but that's it. I really don't know if there's someone out there who could fall in love with me and really mean it. I know that sounds weird, and I'm not trying to think extra highly of myself, as you in another life would have called me out on (who am I kidding, you're going to call me out on it in your next letter) but I'm just... there's a lot to understand about me, you know? Once people hear the whole story, I can't imagine anyone wanting to stick around. I'm not easy. I still have night terrors all the time. I hate going out in public. I'm probably allergic to regular fun. To be with me would mean instant notoriety and a loss of privacy and no one will want to sign up for that.
