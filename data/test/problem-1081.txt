The following day Draco found himself out in the yard with pansy who was loudly complaining and teasing him, at the moment she was pretending to be distraught at Draco telling him she was destroyed after not seeing him in weeks, and Draco laughed harder than he had it weeks at her dramatic monologue.
“you okay in there,” Weasley asked.
“He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding,”
“Idiot” he repeated and him and pansy giggled again as Longbottom was escorted out of the class, Snape once again took points off Gryffindor but Draco didn’t care.
‘shh’ he sighted before Granger could say a word. ‘its Filch’ he mouthed, Weasley mouthed a curse, they all looked at each other in panic and started to run on the opposite direction. They tried to open another random door in the corridor when peeves floated out.
He finally held the two vials in his hand, completely sure they were the right ones.
“so that is what fluffy is guarding, the stone,”
(See the end of the chapter for
They suddenly found themselves in a big dark room, Draco could tell by the way the sound of his footsteps echoed it was probably as big as the great hall, he was about to cast a Lumos spell when everything lit up  torches on either side of the room revealed they were standing on the edge of a gigantic chessboard behind a row of chessmen taller than they were and carved from stone.
Lunch passed as usual his father relaying some occurrence at the ministry and his mother listening intently and offering her perspective on the situation when proper. Although this might sound boring, Draco had loved to hear about his father’s job, investments, and business deals ever since he could remember, perhaps there where a lot of things about his father he didn't quite understand but he knew for sure he was extremely cunning and smartly gifted for his work.
The three of the sat around the bed and he told them the whole story, how he had seen the stone In the mirror, and how Quirrell had taken off his turbant, and Draco didn’t know how Harry hadn’t just fainted on the stop, he though he probably would have. He of course did not say this out loud, Harry didn’t really go into much detail about how Quirrell was gone, and noticing he was uncomfortable just thinking about it none of them pressed him on the matter. He then told them a bit about the conversation he’d had with Dumbledore, and to Draco’s surprise he had gotten to a similar conclusion as him about the whole thing. He didn’t say anything about it, he would make sure to bring it up later.
The door suddenly flew open.
“absolutely bonkers that one” Ron said once outside.
“Get out of the way,” snapped Weasley. It was bad move.
“Oh, and one last thing, I’ve taken up a higher position at the Hogwarts board so you’ll likely see me around the school more,” his father said as Draco unlocked the door.
“Abut’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour already. All right?” Hagrid and flitch exanged a few more words Draco was too busy panicking to catch.
“I’m telling you Ron I think the dog is guarding the object from Gringotts,” Potter said, Draco started listening more intently. Granger on the other hand who also seemed to have been paying attention to the conversation only rolled her eyes.
“You mean that thing has a name,” Weasley gasped.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hope not” Harry said
“What the hell has gotten into him?” Draco asked Ron who was sitting there looking equally dumbfounded. Hermione of course had already taken too chasing after Potter.
“Oh, Harry dear – I was worried sick you could have been anywhere” she said almost smothering Harry in a hug and before he had a chance to speak seizing the glasses form his face and with a gentle tap of her wand giving them back as good as new, she apeared to be a little much in Draco's opinion, hadn’t even noticed Draco or his father.
“let him go, all he will do is hex you”, harry said and Draco had to admit he wasn’t wrong.  He heard Potter trying to convince Granger to go back to the tower but she didn’t budge. Draco was just a little impressed with her nerve, Potter finally convinced her by saying him and Weasley would go. This didn’t last long though, the lady was gone form the portrait and there was no way to go back in.
“Thank you sir,” he said.
“Care to explain?” he said.
“you must be exhausted dear,” she said sweetly instead.
“But –” Harry began to say.
“mind your business Malfoy,” Potter said.
He was in deep though when he heard someone stepping out bed, he peaked through the curtain to find Potter sitting by the window staring out into the Hogwarts grounds, Draco didn’t notice for a second that harry had turned to look back at him.
After this Harry finally managed to sneak away, and, Lockhart took his place as a line formed to being signing autographs. Draco was pushed again to the back of the store, and found himself face to face with Harry who looked miserable.
Christmas at the manor was hectic as always. He woke up bright and early and rushed down stairs to open his presents, as his mother watched, he had received a new nimbus 2001 that he could not wait too brag to Potter about, and his usual array of robes, books, and other trinkets from his parents. He also received a lot of presents from his relatives, clothes and books seemed to be the most common, but he received broom caring supplies and even some toys form relatives who must have forgotten he was no longer 9 years old. Pansy had sent out some chocolates and Blaise a bunch of Christmas sweets. The rest of his morning was spent pacing the halls waiting for guest to arrive.
“Dobby” he called and heard a characteristic *Pop* of apparition.
Four more other Lockhart books where listed, in fact it was the entire collection.
His father sat opposite to him in the chair his mother was sitting before. Draco shifted his weight, he felt his heart beat accelerate, his palms where sweating, he hoped his father count tell, he keep his posture and looked directly at him as he always had been thought hoping his obvious nervousness wasn’t obvious.
“Well what a coincidence, we are headed to buy Draco’s books for the school year there ourselves,” his father said, Draco simply nodded in approval. “Its surely no trouble, you can come with us until we can get you back to who you came with; and who may this be?” his father asked.
Draco sat down at the front of the class next to Granger, to his dismay, but it was the only empty place left at the front. No one paid him much attention, he took note of what professor Flitwick was saying, it was only a short introduction to charms probably for all the muggle borns, stuff he already knew. He found it displeasing that his time was being wasted on explaining such basic concepts. Never the less Granger besides him wrote notes like crazy. He felt a sting of confidence. Surely being the top student wouldn’t be that hard as it looked most of them hadn’t gotten a proper magical education beforehand. Things where looking up for Draco.
“That thing, is my dog,” Hagrid said maddened. “I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the --” he stopped himself.
“I don’t know, Dumbledore” he said dryly.
“Of course, we checked on fluffy just yesterday and everything was still the same,” Hermione said.
He looked like he had since Draco had memory. Long blonde hair slicked back into a low pony tail, dressed in elegant black robes from head to toe. he carefully removed his leather gloves and set them on the table, neatly and then they disappeared.
Students started to enter the classroom slowly  as Draco took off to his first lesson of the day. He took a deep breath and made his way up to the charm’s classroom, sprinting, it was getting late. He made it to the door just seconds before professor Flitwick started, never the less Potter was nowhere to be seen. Draco was really starting to dislike him, what could possibly be more important that their first ever class at Hogwarts that he decided not to show up.
“shut it Weasley, at least she knows something” Draco yelled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry I’m sure” he said hoping Harry would trust he was telling the truth. He looked directly in his eyes for a couple of seconds as if trying to find any shred of doubt.
"Draco,” Lucius said, his expression suddenly turning grave. “If, the dark lord shall return to full power someday, and he probably will form what you tell me, we must be ready,”
“Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back, haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over?”
"what do you mean, I am a Slytherin," He wanted to yell, He was starting to panic his heart racing suddenly he felt dizzy, how long had he been sitting in that chair he wondered.
“It wasn’t Snape,” Draco rolled his eyes.
“come on Hagrid, what is going on,” she asked.
“Wait,” his father said. “Draco, continue to do as discussed and you will continue to have my trust,” Lucius said and this time Draco felt that unlike when he had heard it back in december it wasn’t a warning it was just a reminder, and it clicked somewhere inside him his father trusted him again.
“Gryffindor won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty,” Shouted lee Jordan from the stands. Cheering filled the air. The whole team went down to congratulate Potter who was still clearly very shaken up.
Harry had instead wasted no time and was already lowering himself through the hole until he was hanging only by his fingertips, still no sign of the bottom.
“I’m aware” his father said as they turned another corner finally the loud noise of diagonalley could be heard and the warm light of the sun returned slowly.
“I guess,” Ron shrugged the three of them got up.
“You know how rumor fly,” he said.
“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch’ Come on, dear.” Draco heard madam hooch  and hurry away to the hospital wing.

“Game on, tosser,” pansy said
Draco stepped outside, the cold air of the night hit his face, his cheeks flushed red and he pushed his hair back, he had not bothered to comb it that morning and it was looking very rattled but he didn’t really care. He wrapped his scarf around his face and made his way to his mother. She looked happy to see him, almost too much in a way Draco had never seen. It was then the first time it occurred to him that this was the longest time she had gone in her life without seeing him, and perhaps foolishly he hadn’t considered that it might be hard for her. His father on the other hand was nowhere to be seen, this was nothing unusual though, he didn’t really see his father that often even when he wasn’t at Hogwarts.
Later that evening, Draco made his way downstairs to his father’s office, and after showing him the book list, his father informed him that Lockhart himself had been hired by the board to be the new DA teacher.  Draco felt a weird sensation in his stomach upon hearing this and started to wonder about Lockhart, he didn’t know much about him, but, he had meet him back at one of his parents Christmas balls, and though Draco didn’t remember much he knew that his accomplishments had sounded grand he had just gotten his order of merlin that year and everyone had wanted to talk to him. He had seemed cool from a distance, Draco also remembered that he had been wearing turquoise blue robes that made Draco wish he had style.
“How you know it was that one?” Ron asked as the door closed behind them.
“What the hell Potter” he sat up annoyedly. instead of seeing Harry's face next to Granger though Harry was already quite far into sprint towards Hagrid’s hut.
“Well you were lucky once right?” Draco said and Harry let out a little snort.
“Wait, Granger,” Draco said following her. “What the hell do you think you are doing,” Draco said crawling behind her, she was shorter and moved faster than him, he was struggling to keep up. “Granger” he kept shouting as they made their way to a steps of flimsy wood stairs leading up the professor’s benches.
’ he repeated in his head inspecting the biggest and smallest bottles. One of them was wine, the other one had therefore to be one of the potions to get him trough. he noticed then one of the potions had been switched of its place by whoever was there before them, it was clever if he didn’t know about potions composition he would have solved the logic puzzled but been wrong because the bottles where switched.
“Right then, now, listen carefully, ’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks” the half giant said, Draco could only think to himself ‘bloody wonderful’ as they followed Hagrid into the edge of the forest. The tall trees quickly surrounded them and he could catch a glimpse of the full moon between the deep net of branches that intertwined over his head.
“No,” Harry said.
“Did you see his face,” he said loudly so everyone could hear him, tossing the Remembrall back and forward between his hands, he held it up, “look, it’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.” He laughed.
“In your eyes,” Draco said thinking back to Granger, Potter and Weasley, Pansy must have figured out what he was thinking.
The weeks passed painfully slowly and Draco found himself once more sitting down in the kitchens reading one morning. when one of the elves frantically burst in announcing that master Malfoy was expected for lunch. All the elves started immediately rushing in what could only be described as organized chaos, plates and vegetables all of sorts levitating everywhere, and cacophony of orders being shouted back and forth. Draco though it best to get out of the way and change into some proper attire for lunch.
“You need your strength Harry ,” Seamus chimed in form the other side of the table. “Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team,” He continued Draco laughed.
At around seven the manor started to fill with witches and wizards in very elegant dress robes. He had heard form someone the minister of magic was even there that night. He saw his mother and father graceful host as ever, walking next to each other, greeting all the guest with polite smiles and handshakes and sharing once more does roaring fake laughter’s Draco knew so well.
“I mean, maybe...but I think it’s just a coincidence Draco, each of the task was assigned to a professor, Hagrid for fluffy, sprout for the plant, McGonagall the chess set, Flitwick the keys, Snape the potions, it’s just a coincidence” she said, Draco almost let out an exasperated sigh but held it in.
As soon as they were back at the manor his father stormed off to his office slamming the door shut behind him.
In the back of his mind though was still the worry of not having heard back from his father at all. sure, the weather this week hadn’t been the best, but the owl ought to have reached him by now right? He wondered. He had breakfast on his own as every day that week. It seemed at least the Gryffindor where good on respecting his distance, or perhaps they just didn’t want to be friends at all. Whatever the reason he was glad he could keep to himself without being pestered by the others.
Ron pulled her by the arm in the split second, dragging her out of the way of the swinging club. The troll roared again and started to corner Ron and Hermione. Draco was running out of objects to throw when he saw Potter start to take speed, he leaped and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck. And for some reason decided the move would be to stick his wands up the troll’s nose. The troll didn’t seem to like this as he started swinging like crazy Potter was holding on for dear life. Draco suddenly had an idea
“Aja!” Harry screamed. Hagrid cursed himself.
“Prefects,” he heard professor Dumbledore shout distantly “lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!”
“Well then son,” his father said picking up the glass and leaning back on his chair again. “I imagine there are many eventful things you’ve been longing to share about your school year,” Draco nodded. “well,” his father said simply and Draco began to diligently recount everything from the dragon to the dog and the stone as his father listened attentively. He obviously left details about Hermione and Ron out, but told his father mostly everything. he knew his father would be proud of him, he had done as expected of him. “Seems to me everything is working wonderfully son,” Draco beamed with joy. “I’m delighted to hear you’ve managed to gain the boy’s trust Draco, but do tell me more about him what is he like?” his father asked. Draco had anticipated the question and been thinking about what he would say when faced with it.
“It’s me Harry,” he said.
“how was work,” she asked, his father started pacing the room. He still hadn’t even directed a look to Draco.
birthday celebration with pansy and Blaise in June just after the Hogwarts term had ended there was nothing else to remark about that summer.
Draco was in shock he never expected absolute rule follower maniac Granger to tell a lie, and much less for him. Perhaps he had been wrong about her he tough. He didn’t really hear much of the rest of   Professor McGonagall’s scolding, he just knew they had lost a bunch of points but also surpassingly won some.
As the minutes passed, they all kept talking and shouting, Angelina scored again, they all cheered, still no sight of the snitch. It was almost 20 minutes into the match and still no sight of the snitch, Draco was looking around with Hagrid’s binoculars when a strange movement cough his eye. Potter was zigzagging through the air, his broom looked to be making violent swishing movements. It looked like it he had lost complete control. Draco pointed up
After a McGonagall reprimand Draco was starting to get weirdly accustomed to at this point the four of them had achieved their first proper detention at Hogwarts and had lost a considerable amount of points for Gryffindor. Hermione on her part was completely mortified as was Potter, they both looked like they had seen someone die after it was over. Weasley on the other had was very pleased as he recounted the million times his brothers had gotten detention, and it appeared to Draco he even felt proud of himself for having something to brag to the twins about. Draco  was only angry the thing that had gotten him in trouble had been the god forsaken dragon.
“oh absolutely, can't wait for the front page,” Harry said flatly, annoyance clear.
“she really does” he said before he could consciously hold back words. Surprisingly this go a laugh out of Potter and Weasley. Afterwards the awkwardness set in there was an uncomfortable silence
A few hours later, a car pulled into the familiar Malfoy state drive way, the metal grates sung open with a clink. His mother often preferred muggle ways of transportation so his father had compromised on getting them a driver and a car. This was quite normal in upper wizard society as one of the few muggle things they had fully adopted.
“a chance?” asked Draco.
“fine, but don’t you think it’s weird that us, a group of first! where able to defeat all the “best” defenses our professors could come out with to stop the literal dark lord” said Draco, Hermione cringed at the name.
“But he already dislikes me sir,” Draco argued
“So is he not…” pansy trailed
Time flew by, between assignments, and exam after exam, slowly the grounds got colder. It was a chilly mid-November morning, and the school was getting ready for the first quidditch match of the season.  The anticipation could be felt in the air as he walked into the great hall, Potter looked like he would be sick and so Draco of course took the opportunity to tease as he sat in front of him
“Seriously how do you manage to mess up such a simple potion that bad,” pansy said Draco also smiled
It was true none of them had much knowledge about the first war, after all Hermione was a muggle-born and Ron's parents much like his own had sheltered all the Weasley’s form knowing too much. In fairness in terms of actual events, dates and battles they probably knew the same.
“Look at the of the day wasn’t this the plan, like didn’t you tell me that you were gutted when Potter didn’t take you as a friend the first day what are you so worried about,” there was the question coming Draco knew it
“Well that is your problem to deal with, figure it out Malfoy, in the meantime though I will help you write to your father,” Draco breathed relived and regained his composure.
Draco didn’t have time to think before Hermione had cast a full body biding jinx on the idiot and promptly apologized as they headed out to common room huddled under Harry ’s cloak It surpassingly was just about big enough fit the four of them comfortably under it.
“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare … what did, oh!” she exclaimed “it likes the dark and the damp”
“err --- can´t have ya right now, sorry,” Hagrid said he sounded agitated. They heard a pot fall with a loud clatter of metal inside the hut.
“what object?” Weasley muttered as he chewed loudly Draco cringed.
“You... you mean it was the actual dark lord?” she whispered.
“Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” the man said “And young Master Malfoy, too charmed. How may I be of assistance?” he said looking Draco up and down. he simply stiffened in response but was quickly distracted by the many artifacts around him. Bones and skulls of all sizes where laid around the many shelves along with decks of cards and bottles, there was a severed hand above the fire place and a hole cabinet of jewelry with many sings saying not to approach it.
“Dumbledore was called to the ministry a few minutes ago and will be out for hopefully only a couple of days, anything you need I will be taking over,”  McGonagall announced before dinner. Harry looked pale as a gosh, and looked nervously at the professors table Draco assumed making sure they were all there still.
“yes, please have lunch fixed, in the meantime I’d like to talk to my son,” he said. His mother understating, left the room quietly and presumably headed for the kitchen leaving Draco and his father alone in the dark lounge room.
After that, Draco didn’t remember how they made it out of the forest or how he got to the hospital wing but frankly he didn’t care. He had been given some potions and was felling considerably better, his knee was still sore form the fall but he didn’t feel nauseous anymore. Potter was on the bed across form him, by the looks of it with a horrible head ache. Draco finally let his body relax, and felt the exhaustion catch up to him he finally let himself fall into a restless sleep.
“you must be hungry” said his mother, “I’ll get you something fixed” she said leaving him alone in the dark corridor.
Harry had left earlier in the morning and had apparently already filled the other two on the events of the night before as Granger looked at him with the most disgusting sympathy in her eyes when he walked into the common room and promptly hugged him like he had saved Harry’s life which he very much had not done. Draco wasn’t used to being hugged and it made him deeply uncomfortable but he resisted the urge to push her away he just rolled his eyes instead and gently nudged her away. Hermione understood and thankfully left him alone after that.
“Sure,” he said
“they came looking for me, I – I” she stuttered “I came looking for the troll because I thought I could deal with it on my own” she lied.  “if   - if they hadn’t found me I would probably be dead by know” she continued to explain the situation and described about how they had actually knocked out the troll. “They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.” She finished.
“Well then, tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.” The group gladly followed Hagrid as he picked up the two trees and started to drag them again.
“You coming or not” pansy called Draco who had been focused on the sunset to notice his friends walking away, “on my way” he said, sprinting up the hill to follow them.
was bursting with people almost all the way up to the exit and it didn’t take Draco long to figure out why. Countless advertisements parted on the windows informed that Gilderoy Lockhart himself was holding a signing. Draco’s father didn’t seem to pay any mind to the multitude and made his way into the book store. Inside Draco immediately spotted the unmistakable bunch of redheads near the front and instantly knew it was the Weasleys. One of the twins had spotted them and was pushing his way to the front to alert who he assumed was Molly Weasley. Who immediately turned red face and pushed back to the back of the book store.
“If it isn’t Arthur Weasley”
“MR MALFOY WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING!!” she screamed opening the window, Draco just tumbled inside plummeting onto her floor.
“Lucius,” said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.
“but who would do that, and for what?” asked Hermione. Draco though it was naïve, he could think about many reasons one would want to ‘test’ them, or well test Potter specifically. After all the contradicting talk, he had heard in his life about the ‘boy who lived’ the ‘savior’ the new ‘dark lord’ it would not strike him as weird that they wanted to test him, get a feel for where his loyalties laid, or even more try a sense of his character.
“Spit it out did you really bet on Gryffindor?”  Blaise questioned
It was a sunny day, and after lunch Draco and pansy headed together to the outer grounds. Twenty or so brooms lay on the grass.  It took a while for both the rest of the Gryffindor’s and Madam Hooch to arrive.
“I – I understand you are busy father no need to apologize,” Draco said unsure felling suddenly very out of his ground
“Are you, all right?” said the centaur with a voice so deep it echoed on the threes around them, it helped Harry to his feet.
“But how?”
“I don’t have one,” she said and gave him a death glare that made him to shut up. He still trailed closely behind her over the narrow stair way. they reached the top and started crawling again hoping to not alert anyone on the row of professors in front of them. Everyone was too focused on Potter to even notice, Draco breathe relived, he was still alive.
“Mate they can’t make you miss the end of the year feast tomorrow night,” Ron exclaimed
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” Hagrid questioned.
Draco rushed out the dorm on Halloween morning he had overslept and he only had five minutes to rush to the charm’s classroom. To his dismay the last sit was next to Longbottom. He cursed his luck and reluctantly sat down. Draco’s mood however improved a little when Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly.
She led him to the other side of the room, and pushed open the curtains, Harry looked pale, more than Draco had ever seen him. his face was covered in bruises and cuts, just like his own must be he imagined. Madam Pomfrey had clearly washed off most of the dirt off his face but his hair was still covered in dust in some spots, and it was tangled up with dried blood. The lighting bolt scar was redder than before and there was a new red mark on his neck. Nevertheless his face looked strangely peaceful. Draco could see he was breathing slowly under the covers, and he finally let out a relived sight, the tension he had been involuntarily holding on his shoulders until then released and he was able to relax. Harry might not have looked his best but he was alive and he would be fine. Draco walked back to his own bed, overhearing Ron complaints a few bed over, saying that it wasn’t fair Draco was allowed to see him but he didn’t. Pomfrey only answered that his foot was on no condition to be walking around, Draco smiled to himself, and drifted off into quiet sleep.
“HEY” he complained turning then to see it was Hagrid who was attempting to squeeze himself into the tiny stands
“Yea – he’s mine” the half giant said knocking over a pan from the ceiling.
“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,” Mr. Weasley said coldly grabbing Harry’s shoulder. Draco shoot Harry what he hopped was an apologetic look, as the conversation slowly escalated.
Weasley kept loudly complaining as the students made their way out of the classroom. Hermione took a while to pack her things and followed the class from distance as did Draco. Once they were out in the hall they walked behind the group of Gryffindor boys Weasley still loudly complaining.
“Yeah, yeah I will too swear!” said pansy. “and don’t forget to write, because you barely owl'd me during Christmas break Malfoy” she said.
“look” Draco was confused. He took the binoculars from Hermione. he saw Snape looking directly at Harry , to his surprise, it did look like he was putting a curse, but Draco knew it could not be, he couldn’t look anymore, as Weasley sized the binoculars from him. \“I’m telling you Hermione it’s not him,” Draco argued. Weasley just asked in panic
“I’m not hungry,” Potter simply said
“You’d think magic got rid of does” said Draco.
“They are just rumors at the end of the day, right?” pansy said. It had been going around that Draco was friends with Potter Granger and Weasley. Draco had wanted to maintain the idea that they were merely on cordial terms in fear of his father. He was almost sure that he had already heard about the company Draco know frequented, and this worried him.
This final comment seeming a little strange but Draco brushed it off as another one of his father’s attempt to keep a close eye on Dumbledore, or some attempt to make himself more important; even perhaps an excuse to be around in his life more. This though made him feel  warmth inside as he headed up the stairs to his bedroom for the night feeling exhausted, the conversation about the dark lord running over and over in his head, his father’s severe expression and hushed voice vivid in his mind.
“He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after so I told him after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy” continued Hagrid
“Swish and flick, “suddenly the room filled with noise, the words Wingardium leviosa where said over and over again.
“apparently,” he smirked clearly enjoying getting back at Malfoy after last night’s incident. Draco only rolled his eyes and kept quiet before he said something dumb and gave Potter more satisfaction. Even more so because Draco just a few weeks ago had been gloating the broom he had at home, only to know realize Potter had a better one. Not only that it was in this moment that it downed on n him that Potter had a broom and was the younger seeker in a century because of him. Potter of course did not miss the opportunity to point this out to Draco. So, for the following week whenever somebody asked him about the broom he would sarcastically say
“sure” said Potter, trying not to be rude but he sounded equally as tired as Weasley. Thankfully though Hermione seemed pleased with her announcement, and though Draco could practically fell her vibrating with energy next to him the entire time they were eating she actually allowed them to have a quiet meal which he greatly appreciated, because Draco was definitely not a morning person and the cold put him in an even worse mood.
“well- come on then,” he said the four made their way into the house, it was suffocating, and all the curtains where drawn shut. Hagrid quickly closed the door.
“won’t you look at that” Draco sneered “the losers acting even lamer than usual,” he said. Ron started to go red
Both Draco and Potter in what seemed like synchrony decided to do something arguably very stupid and took up on a sprint towards the troll. Ron followed closely behind them, the troll disappeared out of view as it knocked down the door of the bathroom and made its way in. Draco lead the way as the trio followed the troll into the bathroom, what they saw when they were finally inside was Granger against the wall opposite to the door, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her knocking over doors and sinks on its way.
‘What did a stupid hat know anyway’ Draco thought to himself, he was still struggling to breathe, he didn’t know what to do. So, he just sat at the end of the table and tried to avoid all eye contact. He could feel all eyes burning on him.
"game on Potter, yeah? come catch it then” he said taking off towards one of the high towers close to the yard, harry followed him closely, Draco finally deicing on what to do threw the crystal ball as far away as he could. To his surprise Potter dove straight down to catch it. Draco went back to the ground, and was stunned to see Potter had managed to actually catch the Remembrall. And he held it triumphantly in one hand as he came back down.
“I mean, doesn’t it seem strange to you that no body stopped us from going in there, or that Dumbledore left the school and came back precisely to find Harry, like he somehow knew we were there” he said, Hermione looked confused. "or, or, what about the spells protecting the stone” he continued. “doesn’t it strike you as somewhat odd that they seemed like they were literally designed for us specifically”
“Feeling better?” he asked.
“Sorry I didn’t mean put you on the spot,” she said as kept walking up a flight of stairs Draco simply nodded. “Worried about going home then?” she said.
“sure is,” he said
“Dunno know hopefully later today” Harry said.
“Oh, thank god!” she said when she saw him enter the room. She sprinted throwing herself into a hug, for a second Draco was comply taken off guard, it just turned awkward, Hermione must have felt it too because she immediately pulled away. Physical affection still made Draco uncomfortable.
“I’m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,” his father said, pulling Draco back to reality. “You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,” his father said taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket “I have a few items at home, well, I’m sure you understand” handing Mr. Borgin the list.
“Famous Harry Potter, can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.” Draco teased and Harry elbowed him playfully as Draco laughed
"Malfoy, Parkinson,” he called for them to work together.
“Are you sure it’s that one?” potter asked.
“Never reject an apology given without good reason Draco,” his father instructed as he constantly did, Draco simply nodded.
“yes, father I have,” he simply said trying desperately not to look down he settled his eyes on a portrait behind his father’s head so as not to look directly at him.
“Excuse him Hagrid, he’s intolerable when he gets in a mood,” Hermione interrupted him with a sneer, Draco resisted the urge to hex her just out of propriety. he instead settled for looking at her furiously. At least he noted his discontent with the situation was shared with Weasley who was starting to look really green. Hagrid didn’t care.
“Thank you very much sir,” he said after finish writing the letter, and making his way out of the classroom
The dog had three heads. Three pairs eyes; and three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction, they held their breath as the eyes of the creature shot open. And stared at the four of them. The dog got up and Draco made a quick decision. Between death and Filch. He would take Filch. So, he turned the nob and they all fell backwards into the corridor. Ron kicked the door closed and the four of them ran for their lives. By some miracle they didn’t encounter Filch or anyone in the way back, but they didn’t care, all they wanted to do was get back to the common room. They practically flew up to the seven floor. The lady was back on the portrait.
It was small, very small, the door shut behind them as they walked in,
“fine, maybe not” he said letting the conversation die seeing he would never convince granger. She went back inside.
He looked at it for a second at him, and then to Draco’s surprise drained the bottle in one swift gulp and walked straight through the flames. Draco had no doubt it was the right bottle but he still breathed relived as he heard Harry’s foots steps hurrying away from behind the fire.
he felt a bit like a stranger in his own home, and walked slowly up to his room with an odd caution as if he hadn’t lived in that house for the past 10 years. He opened the door to find everything almost exactly as he left it. The elves had probably gone in that morning and whipped the dust off his things. A box of chocolates was placed at the edge of his bed, a welcome gift from his mother. He felt a sigh of relief thinking at least he would not have to face his father that night and plummeted into his bed with his jacket still on. He was called down stairs for dinner a few minutes later. His mother sat with him but didn’t ask many questions, as she figured he was tired, which he was. He appreciated her silence ate and went back to his room, finally letting the exhaustion set in, he fell asleep almost as soon as he steeled under the familiar bed covers and wondered if he could take them with him to replace the uncomfortable Gryffindor ones.
Later, on Christmas eve he had dinner with his family more as a formality that anything and although as grand as ever he could not help but feel a bit alone. As the evening drew to a close he laid in bed and he thought about what Potter and Weasley might be up to at Hogwarts and slightly smiled to himself knowing they were probably getting into trouble as he drifted into a quiet sleep on that winter night.
The more he mused the idea the more he convinced himself, but his friends would hear none of it.
“The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?” said the old man slightly shifting on his seat
“And so are you, I have a feeling the next one is Snape’s spell so it must be potions and we all know you are much better than me” Hermione said, Draco was speechless.
“please don’t,” potter begged.
“we have to tell McGonagall” said Hermione. Harry nodded and they both rushed to the table to speak with her. Draco couldn’t make out their conversation but the professor looked utterly horrified and quickly dismissed Potter and Granger.
“I think she heard you,” Potter said.
“Ron..” said Harry hesitantly.
“No, he didn’t he was still struggling a few seconds later,” he argued back.
“Wait a sec,” he said going into the common room to grab his robes and came out a few moments later. They started walking downstairs.
“What do you plan to do then Draco,” he said.
“You are the Potter boy, my name is Firenze,” the centaur said, it seen a shiver down Draco’s spine. “You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you.”  Harry just looked confused. “Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?” Firenze said, he hadn’t even direct Draco a look.
“I know it’s not me who has to go on its you” she said looking at them, “GO!” she urged and him and Harry took off into the next room.
He started bagging on her window in desperation. He didn’t want to think about what Harry might be going on with Harry, Eventually after a bit of frantic banging the old witch came to her window in shock.
“at least I have any, all you have is your siblings and idiot Potter that can’t even do magic,” Ron got up pointing his want at Draco’s chin, Draco wasn’t intimidated at all.
“yeah,” he nodded and followed them outside.
“ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” Ron shouted.
“Honestly I don’t know why we even hang out with that prat” he heard Potter loudly complain to Weasley as he made his way down stairs to where they were supposed to meet filtch. “he thinks his so posh and important, the Malfoy heir, all he is an arrogant arse” continued Potter loudly. “cursing the that girl, what has she ever done to him, typical snob picking on others if you ask me!”
“Lord, what happed,” his mother said calmly taking a sip of her tea not looking up from her book.
“I believe so for now, I’m working on it father,” he said again hoping this didn’t sound like too much of a lie. Nonetheless, his relived his father appeared convinced.
“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Weasley. “No wonder Snape’s after it!”
He left the common room as soon as he was able to, he felt strange like his body wasn’t his anymore, and kept looking down at his tie every few minutes as of this was some sick nightmare that would pass.
“Can I see him?” he muttered, She stopped what she was doing and looked at him with clear pity on her eyes, Draco hated it, but he didn’t let it show he kept making sad eyes instead hoping he could get some compassion out of her. She finally gave in and nodded. He jumped to his feet instantly and followed her, Pomfrey was a tiny witch, so much so that Draco even at eleven was only a few centimeters shorter than her.
“The philosophers stone” Harry murmured. before Firenze could say anything, they heard rapid foot steeps approaching. The silhouettes of Hagrid flowed by Weasley and Hermione appeared, Firenze instantly took off on a sprint disappearing behind the tress as Hermione's yells grew closer.
“Thanks Seamus,” said Potter sarcastically and went back to fieldling with a piece of toast.
“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.
“Been learning your curses, or are you still too thick to pick up on anything Potter” he mocked and just as he was about to cast his first spell flitch walked down the hall. They both hid the wands immediately.
“yeah it’s a lot,” harry said. Draco just nodded and looked out to the grounds, One of the benefits of Gryffindor was definitely the views, Draco thought to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter had the cloak under his arm and nervously fidgeted with the fabric as the minutes passed.
Harry turned back to Draco for help. But it was instead his father who spoke
Apart form that the day was uneventful, with exams all gone they didn’t do much in class, all that was left was waiting till the grades where given that Friday. So Draco got to spend most of his time thinking about his theory, trying to understand all the pieces like it was a giant puzzle. Everything started to feel like a giant plan. Someone had to allow the specific dark forest detention for them to see the unicorns, Hagrid telling them specifically what they needed to know but making it look like he didn’t mean to, Harry getting the cloak for Christmas. It all just made sense, they had though they were investigating and actually finding stuff, but actually they were doing exactly what they were supposed to be.
(taken directly from the text: some dialog in the broom scene you probably recognize, a couple Peeves lines, and Hermione's iconic Line)
“oh, good,” Draco said pleased, Before Hermione could ask Draco lead her into the hall outside.
“Draco, if it had been me you wouldn’t even have glanced at me again ” Pansy said getting annoyed  and Draco could not say she was wrong, but he desperately wanted her to be, he kept mixing no answer.
“Knockturn alley”
“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more important things friendship and bravery” she looked back at Draco directly now.
he thought to himself.
“I figured as much,” said Snape, finally turning to look directly and Draco.
As they reached the cabin Hagrid stepped out looking as usual, but for a crossbow on his back,
“let the feast begin,” he said and Draco could not be more thankful as the food appeared and the hall filled once again with sound. During dinner he spoke to no one, and he barely ate, his head was running, and he was sacred, confused, and most of all angry.
“Maybe,” he simply said with a sneer and they were quiet again. As the minutes passed Draco notices his senses seemed to be getting sharper he started picking up every sound of the wind, every cracking twig under Potters heavy footsteps, he also noted that the forest was eerily quiet, and wondered What was going on with the others.
“I’m going to be just fine” he said confidently “And you two have to promise you will visit during the holidays” he said with a smile,
“A bit,” he replied as they made their way up, “it’s just I don’t know what it’s even going to be like” he muttered “I can’t help but feel like they might act strange, plus, my dad has not said anything about the hole troll incident thing yet but I’m sure he must know,” he continued. “I just hope they don’t, like, assume anything,” he said finally as they reached the second floor.
“You’ll understand soon enough, he will guide us back to the power we deserve,” his father said, and Draco though it sounded insane but was too scared to think properly so he simply nodded. “we must be prepared,” his father repeated.
“give it back Malfoy,” Potter said,  it was then Draco had an idea.
It was all the Draco needed one interaction with Potter had been enough for him to decide it wasn’t worth making friends with him anyway. If he preferred to hang out with weasels let him. Finally the professor called out his name and he made his way confidently to the stool, the hat was placed over his head completely covering his eyes, when suddenly a voice resonated inside his head,
“yes now” Ron said, she rolled her eyes and followed along.
In the middle of the room levitated and old broom spectrally bathed in moonlight, Draco keep staring at the strange creatures when he notices they weren’t animals at all, but keys with wings.
Draco sat on the second row behind Granger, he saw as all the Slytherins take their places and noticed Pansy was staring at him. She hadn’t even talked to him the entire week and started angrily wondering if she was just looking at him with pity or if she wanted something else. He was pulled out of his thoughts by the sound of the door slamming shut.
Potter and Weasley sat a few seats away from him, but close enough so Draco could hear everything they were saying. Once they noticed him, there was the awkward pause in their conversation it seemed they weren’t sure if they should say anything to him or not. They all turned to the food without acknowledgment of each other’s existence and soon the duo resumed their conversation. Draco could not help but to listen in.
(From the text, Harry's line about being allowed to face Voldemort)
“That means at least until next Friday we are safe” said Harry, Draco was about to continue the conversation when Snape appeared as if out of thin air behind them.
“we’ve been hearing rumor all day” barged in Thomas.
He got up with difficulty his legs were sore and his head throbbed in pain, McGonagall guided him but the walk was still painfully long, Once there he immediately collapsed into one of the beds. Madam Pomfrey arrived to his bedside a few minutes later, and quickly got to work. Draco promised himself he ought to learn whatever spell she had used to soothe the cramping on his neck in the future it was brilliant. After a few minutes he felt almost like new, except for the throbbing headache, she had given him a disgusting tasting potion for it, but, she said he would probably have to sleep it off anyway.
“reckon we should go check on him or something?” Harry asked.
“Or maybe he wanted you to prove yourself” Draco poised, Harry pondered on it.
Before them was a brightly lit room, letting in the light of the moon, The glass ceiling arching high above them. Over them flew a group of what from a distance looked like huge fireflies.
From the dogs to the keys and the potions, to Flamel and the stone and the forest. He didn’t notice when but McGonagall made him tea and listened to the story with patience. Once he was done she told him to wait for her there, and she left without another world.
“Well then, but you father doesn’t need to know that” she said Draco smiled she felt a bit better having talked to pansy. “I’m glad,” she said, “you know I worry about you a lot,” she had stopped to face him in the middle of a corridor. She was still shorter than him and Draco teased her about it.
They had apparently been in some passageway bellow the castle, He flew all the way to the Gryffindor tower and climbed through a window on the common room as fast as he could, it must have been about 3 in the morning, and Hedwig was sitting in the window still it was almost like she had been waiting for him.
He approached the table. And discarded the easy ones, he didn’t need to read to now the far left one was a very common poison. The one in the middle was wine according to the first clue, and the next to the left, by that reasoning was another poison.
“going to Hagrid’s, come on,” Ron said and started to walk with intend.
“we are done,” Ron said in desperation they could still hear peeves screams.
They started to walk down back the dark alleyway following his father’s steps quietly.
“Fine” he whispered. “I’ll do the talking, you speak as little as possible”
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” Granger snapped, Draco had noticed it too but no wonder stupid Weasley hadn’t,
Before Draco had time to even process the situation Hagrid, Weasley an Hermione took off in their own path leaving Harry and him with nothing but a lamp, and stupid and cowardly dog, in the middle of the forbidden forest. They didn’t look at each other, and in a stupid rage of determination to prove Potter was a git, but also to get the hell out of there fast, Draco started to follow the path walking into the deeper into the forest. Potter tried to keep up his fast pace, as they walked in silence.
“Diagonally,” he replied.
He was wearing baby blue robes that trailed elegantly behind him and unconsciously Draco moved forward to get a better look pushing into the clapping crowd as cameras flashed everywhere, Gilderoy smoothly and elegantly walked along the walls of books.
“A please would be nice” She said condescendingly,
"TROOOOOOOLLL” he shouted “in the dungeon,” he said as he fainted in the middle of the corridor. Panic ensued, but Draco could only think about the fact Granger had no idea there was a loose troll in the castle. Draco’s ears where ringing he didn’t know what to do. He heard the blood pumping in his head.
These types of events always bored him, the grandness of the ball room, the dullness of the classical music and the lack of other people his age were annoying. The only other kids around where other heirs like Draco himself, normally very posh and educated who typically did well mixing with adults and where never allowed to run around, good pureblood children. Even his interaction with Blaise was limited to a very polite hello as he was being paraded around the hall by his parent to meet what seemed like every single important wizard in the whole of England. He was always hearing comments form old witches saying how much he had grown, or what a fine and educated young man he has. This year though he was more hyper aware of the looks he was getting and the little whispers about him being in Gryffindor. He even heard a few comments saying they hoped he didn’t turn out like the other black boy who’d last been in Gryffindor whatever that meant.
“They’re keys! Winged keys” he muttered softly to himself and then repeated it loud enough so the rest could hear.
Sorry for the delay had a very busy couple of days but here is this weeks update! hope you enjoy and as always let me know what you think. (btw, still looking for a beta if anyone is intrested!)
“It had a crooked wing like someone had used it already” he said as if it had been absolutely obvious.
“I’m supposed not to say,” Draco shrugged and his mother laughed her soft elegant laugh Draco knew to be the real one.
“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” oh finally justice Draco thought to himself knowing full well Potter would not know the answer. He on the other hand new the answer but simply scribbled it on the side of his parchment
The day of the match was as the rest of the week had been insanely rainy he only went out to the pitch because he really wanted to see if the team would make it to the finals or not. Thankfully the game was over in less than five minutes when Potter caught the snitch. It could not be denied now that Potter had talent. The week after the Gryffindor victory he felt the atmosphere was a bit cheerier even if the rain didn’t stop. The assignments started to almost double and Draco found himself spending hours looked up in the library. Finally, by the last days of May the sun started to return, and the four of them where spending an evening out in the grounds for the first time in months. Hermione still deep into studying for the approaching final exams.
The three boys where left staring at nothing, they awkwardly laughed and entered their dorm. But form that moment on the animosity between the four of them was significantly less, and Draco would not call them his friends per say, but as the old tale says, there are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other at least a little bit and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them but Draco would never admit that of course.
it was cheesy but you could tell there was effort involved. They even had gone to the extent of drawing a lion that changed colors on it. Draco settled in between Granger and Thomas and he was handed little flag to wave around by one of the older kids behind him.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play.”
As the clock stroke eleven the  four of them found themselves nervously pacing on the common room waiting for the final students to go up to bed.
“When are they letting you out of this place anyway?” asked Draco.
As they entered the castle pansy said,
“I can’t believe you Albus” he heard a muffled whisper at the other side of the door. “They are eleven years old” whispered the voice behind the door it sounded exasperated, Draco recognized it as professor McGonagall.
“I don’t think so,” Draco pointed out the troll was still breathing. Potter pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose making Weasley visibly gag. A sudden slamming of loud footsteps made the four of them turn to the corridor. Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, and Quirrell who looked even paler than usual.
“Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up,” She shouted as all the students took their places next to a broom, “Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!” and so they all did.
His father had been around a couple of times, most of them with ministry officials to talk business Draco want allowed to hear but wanted to desperately. He had also brought home other important guests for stoic diners that Draco found immensely boring but was forced to attend a couple of times. Most of them with alleged relatives or apparent important political figures that Draco could not care less about. Yet, Draco and his father hadn’t really spoken much since he had got back from Hogwarts, still he knew his father would want to know about everything that happened regarding the stone and as the weeks passed without even a mention of it he grew uneasy.
“Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?” the centaur interrupted. Suddenly in a striking realization in clicked in Draco’s head, he felt nauseous.
“Yeah, right” Harry whispered back adjusting his broken glasses.
“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands.
He spent the week leading up to the first of September reading Lockhart’s books, he got through about four, because they weren’t really textbooks, but rather read like novels, with engaging characters and intrigue and mystery. Draco found himself immersed in the colorful towns and wondrous dangers they described and slowly his admiration for Lockhart grew with every page he read about his wild encounters with werewolves and his life among vampires.
Regardless, even if it wasn’t indented maybe his original plan could be redeemed. Not that he wanted that by any means, to him, after a few months of being away from the constant idea of acquiring Potter for the rise of a new era of supremacy or whatever his dad said, had become – a bit ridiculous. Especially after getting to know Potter he was convinced there was just no way that would ever happen. But his father didn’t need to know that, so he planned to bring up the plan if he did get questioned about it when he was home for the holidays.
“Took you long enough” Weasley said “it’s about to begin” his voice high, he was clearly very nervous. A few minutes of anxious waiting and chanting later and Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. Fifteen brooms rose up into the air. The match began.
“it is a monstrous thing, too slay a unicorn,” continued Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips,”
Monday night he walked onto the common room to find a posted announcement saying Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday and would be joined by the Slytherin's Draco mentally celebrated he got to share more classes with his friends as up to that point they only had potions together. He was also back to his usual self, terrorizing the lesser students in his opinion. Most of the time, Longbottom, who couldn’t not seem to do anything right. Even his family thought so it appeared, he had gotten a remember-all that morning in the mail. The worry on Draco’s mind was the only thing he could not seem to shake. His still had heard nothing from his family.
The first months of the year where rainy as the winter gave way to spring, the four friends where relaxing in the common room one Friday evening after a week full of lessons. Hermione and Ron sat opposite to each other playing on the old chess set, Hermione loosing for the millionth time, this was the only thing she ever lost at. Potter sat by the fire chatting with Draco about the quidditch season as he explained all the different teams and intricacies of the British league to Potter who was still a bit clueless about. They shared sweets they had bought from some older students who brought them after their weekend at Hogsmeade, making a game of who would get the most disgusting flavored bean. So far potter got the worst one, puddle water. Looking to get the disgusting flavor off his mouth Potter quickly opened one of the chocolate frogs they had bought for that specific purpose and ate it with delight. Draco picked up the empty box he had tossed between them in the hustle to open it, and cheeked to see if the card was good and found disappointedly it was just another Dumbledore as he tossed it back to the floor, potter picked it up.  His eyes suddenly went wide,
“Oh, hello professor” he greeted politely. Weasley glared at him, Draco promptly ignored him.
‘perhaps Potter was good at something’ Draco thought. Still he wasn’t discouraged even as the rest of the Gryffindor’s cheer Potter, he saw and angry Professor McGonagall walking directly at the crowd.
“Yes, but he’s is not fully himself, he is less alive than a ghost, but alive none the less” Draco said without hesitation his voice coming out more confident that he felt. He couldn’t read his father’s expression, he detected a hint of fear, and maybe some surprise in his burrowed frown.
Hermione didn’t respond, and his father suddenly turned his attention to Arthur who had just appeared behind Harry .
Weasley moved forward and the white queen attacked. She struck him hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor. Shaking Harry did his move and just like that the door at the end of the room sung open. Ron still lied unconscious on the floor.
‘leave it up to Potter to show up 20 minutes late’ professor Flitwick didn’t pay them much mind but they claimed they had “gotten lost” as far as Draco was concerned they where idiots.
“Good luck Harry ” he said sincerely and watching him open the little vial.
The next day Draco woke up in a mood. He had never been a naturally early riser and the exhaustion from the last couple of weeks was starting to set in. He dragged himself to the great hall and ignored pansy’s cheerful wave from across the hall. He plummeted into one of the farther chairs only for Potter and the Weasel to come in cheerful as ever. Indeed, their shared near death experience the night before had already faded to one of the many adventures the duo seemed to collect. Granger on the other hand seemed to be in an equally terrible mood as him. So that at least made him fell some sort of comfort.
“wait,” Draco managed to say but Hermione did not stop she just ran down the hallway.
It was also no secret that both sides, does who believed in the darks lord's message, and does who did not had been holding their breath for the last 11 years waiting to see what kind of person he would turn out be. It was the reason his father had asked him to befriend him in the beginning of the year,
“No sir,” he said.
“It’s not class time yet,” he heard a cold voice reply from the other side of the door
“what the hell do you care,” Draco hollered
“Very much so Miss. Parkinson,” he teased back, they laughed little too loud and got a few stares. The nigh went by very slowly he stayed with pansy most of the time yet it was hard to make this event feel anything but stuffy and boring, after speeches and a very fancy meal, Draco was excused to go to his own bed.
“The smallest bottle will get us forward, but there’s only enough for you,” he said. “This one will let me go back to Hermione and Ron,” he said.
“What on earth? are you really here...” Draco asked still not sure if this was some weird spell.
Suddenly everting moved fast. His father pushed him swiftly out of the way as Mr. Weasley launched himself at him and started to physically wrestle him. Draco was mortified and Harry who had also landed on the floor amidst the chaos looked at him perplexed. Hermione was staring at him from across the room, she looked scared.
“So light a fire!” Harry yelled as the plant started to wrap around his neck.
“this is... strange,”
His father swiftly opened the door making the bell above the door twinkle softly.
he realized in that moment that Harry had to trust him. There was no way he would know if he was lying, Draco could very well be giving him poison and leaving him to die, and no one would be able to do anything about it.
He left the great hall fuming and walked back to the tower to hopefully have some time alone and in peace without any of the usual loud chatter in the room it was almost peaceful. He walked into the dorm only to find his owl on the window with a letter, marked with the distinct green Malfoy crest on the front.
“I bet Flamel asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it,” Hermione said
“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” his father said, “All those raids … I hope they’re paying you overtime? But -- Obviously not,” he said examining a book he had taken from Ginny’s cauldron “what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?”
“Fine, then I’ll go with you,” he said projecting much more confidence than he felt, with his snarky tone of voice he hadn’t really used in a while.
(See the end of the chapter for
The weeks that followed where strange, Draco and Granger now sat together every morning for breakfast. In the beginning it was odd finding things to talk about, but with time conversation got less awkward. Draco was still having second thoughts about the whole thing but he for some reason could not bring himself to be mean to Granger any more. He still made other students life’s hell, and though Hermione didn’t appreciate this she didn’t really nag him for it after a couple of weeks finding it was most likely a hopeless endeavor for the time being. They mostly cached up about assignments or school gossip, because Hermione never found out about anything, and Draco knew everything so it was fun when he got to tell her all the rumors that where flying in the school. If they were not discussing their upcoming projects, they were most likely talking about some strange magical thing they had read about and slowly but surely Draco began consider Granger a friend.
“where are you going,” he heard Granger scream “its past ten you will get in trouble,” she heard her scream at him. But he couldn’t care less. He stepped out into the dark corridor and started to walk aimlessly. he was almost one floor below when he heard the portrait open again out came Granger followed a few seconds later by Potter and Weasley,
“Nah, I’m all right.” Hagrid replied dropping the trees onto the middle of the corridor to take a break.
“oh, would you let that go already, I was busy” he said, but of course it wasn’t true.
A few seconds later to Draco’s relive his voice came from bellow announcing it was a soft landing. The three of them jumped into the darkness just as the music stopped to play.
A few minutes went by the Quaffle being tossed around between the two teams, and
“you do know there is a spell for that right?” Hermione said amused, he didn’t but he wasn’t about to give her the satisfaction and ask he would research it later.
None of them paid attention as Hagrid left them by the door. They stared in awe at the decoration. The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung, and about twelve Christmas trees where placed around the room, sparkling with tiny icicles, and decoration. The professors where casting various different charms making things like floating bubbles of dancing ballerinas that soared around them.
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” Weasley said loudly “She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends by now right?” he said again which received a laugh from Finnigan. Draco turned to look at Hermione, she quickly wiped the tear swelling in her eyes. “she’s a nightmare, honestly,” Weasley exclaimed loudly. Draco saw Granger take up speed and push past the group of boys.
“we should have gotten more points,” Weasley finally said.
“be thankful they didn’t just expel us,” Draco replied.
“And did you – did you see him?” his father asked almost in a whisper.
“I almost didn’t read it,”
“Alright, copy exactly as I say ” Snape said, In the end the final letter read;
“he’s going to do it tonight, Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight,” Harry siad with a sudden urgency and determination Draco held his urge to say for the millionth time say wasn’t Snape.
“thanks” they said quietly. They were not looking at each other there was an awkward silence.
“you’ve ought to eat something Harry ,” Hermione said taking a sit next to Draco
The following morning was uneventful, mostly, Draco had spent most of his time zoning in and out in history of magic thinking of ways to make Potters life miserable. But so far, his ideas where lacking, because everything that he could do to Potter made his loose himself and he was not about to give him the satisfaction. Pansy suggested hexing his drink to turn his hair blue, but, thought Draco though that was funny, it looked like more of one of the twin’s pranks and he had was trying to come up with some better ideas. By the afternoon his mood had improved a little after having seen Potter struggle in potions. He spent the evening doing a terribly boring assignment for transfiguration class, making sure it was perfect. He had a house elf bring food to him and by the time he finished it was almost past 10. He rushed to not get caught in the corridors after he was supposed to. The last thing he wanted was to get in trouble.
“Dumbledore wouldn’t do that” she said clearly getting mad.
“yeah you try and convince him Hermione,” Weasley said sarcastically walking back to the spot they had been sitting before.
“I’m telling you, that man is off his rocker, all right” said Weasley, and Harry laughed.
Finally, it was morning and he got up as early as he could. He didn’t want any unnecessary interactions. He showered and then took his uniform out of his trunk and started to put it on, the green and silver robes, and ties he had already brought with him reminded him of his failures.
“But he’s alive?” his father asked.
“What do you think you are doing,” Draco heard Neville's squeaky voice in the stair case behind him. “You can’t go out again,” he complained  “you’ll get us all in trouble!”
He sped up a staircase to the third floor, and almost turned the corner towards the trophy room when he heard food steps coming from the other direction. ‘Filch’ he thought and froze in panic. It didn’t take long for the rest of them to catch up to him.
In fact everything about the big state in the summer felt suffocating, the dark wood good at trapping heat in the winter made the library and common areas intolerably hot. This paired with his father’s insistence on keeping all curtains and doors closed, not allowing any breeze to flow made everything feel stale and old. The grounds where under renovation, no doubt, on a whim from his mother that liked to pull out all the plants out every couple of years to create whatever garden style she saw was the most current (there were in fact current and outdated garden styles Draco’s mother insisted constantly)
He still avoided Potter and all the Gryffindor’s for that matter when he was with the Slytherin crowd, but it had gone down from hating each other to mostly playful competition. Even Finnegan and Thomas were a little more tolerable now days. He no longer ignored everyone when they had conversations at night or shared sweets but instead joined in. nevertheless the nagging voice in his head of his father scolding him remained present as ever, and every time he found himself laughing at something Granger or Dean said at dinner time, he remined himself who he was.
“I - Yes” he said  “He will probably find a way even without the stone, but he is really weak at the moment so hopefully it takes him a while” Draco said hoping to reassure his two friends a little.
Still he tried to push them away and eventually he was finally excused after and endless round of hellos. He sat by Pansy who had also finally managed to slip away from the grip of her own mother.
After a few seconds of stunned silence, it was Potter who spoke.
‘wonderful just what I need’ he thought to himself. The 4 boys chatted enthusiastically, Fred and Gorge recounting some of their last adventures as the two younger boys listened with awe. Draco got up and left as soon as he could, he wanted to get early to the potion’s classroom before his other classes began and maybe have a word with his godfather and see if he hated him too much. Of course, it didn’t help that said godfather was also the head of the house he had desperately wanted to get into. But alas it was better than nothing. He just wanted to know what to say to his father, and the clock was ticking, Draco already feared he had heard from someone else about the situation.
About 20 minutes into the class Potter and Weasley entered panting through the door. Draco scoffed.
“Draco also said you have skills for defense against the dark arts, yes?”
“Every word Malfoy,” Potter sneered at him, Draco pulled his wand out as did Potter.
“Harry! Draco!, are you, all right?” Hermione shouted, she was running toward them followed by Hagrid and Ron a few meters behind.
“We could send Norbert to him, Charlie can take care of him!” Harry suggested one evening in the middle of yet another endless discussion they were having about the god forsaken dragon, and so it was settled. after Hagrid finally agreed a plan was put in motion to get the stupid dragon finally out of their life’s and Draco could not be happier they had finally decided to get rid of the monstrosity. he even was glad to help with their stupid plan to get him off the grounds.
“I’m going to kill all of you,” Hermione shouted ducked under Peeves and ran for her life. Draco followed suit he didn’t look back.
“Father,” he simply replied, worried if he said anything more he would end up choking on his words. His throat was dry, he desperately wished of a glass of water.
Weasley took the lead as the best player by far among them and assigned them each a piece, and the game began. Thus, did the smashing. pieces of stone flew across the room every few minutes, the air filled with dust, and Weasley keep screaming commands to the pieces without hesitation. Draco understood the final play almost as the same time as potter did.
The first rays of sunrise starting to peak behind the mountains on the horizon.His entire body was sore, the muscles on his neck where cramped, his eyes felt heavy and the headache from earlier had only gotten worse. The events from previous hours came rapidly rushing back to him, and he felt the panic come back. The only thing in his mind was Harry.
“I reckon he knew we were going to try to intervene anyway, maybe he just taught us what we needed to know, instead of stopping us” said Harry
“Quirrell?” he said out loud without really intending
“Yes, thank you” Harry simply replied.
“Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”
“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured, Draco though it was anything but beautiful, but he was also in awe of the little creature he had never seen a dragon before. He saw Hagrid reached out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head It snapped at his fingers biting them and leaving a mark, Draco backed away instinctively. The dragon was sending tinny sparks out of its mouth. “Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” Hagrid said.
“Perhaps,” Draco simply replied.
The hooded figure rapidly approached them, Draco’s head was going a million miles per hour, but somehow, he found the clarity of mind to cast red sparks and then did the only thing he would think of and quickly hurled Harry's arm over his shoulder helping him up. Or rather forcing him to get up, he put his hand around Harry's waist and started to run. Harry was wobbly and dizzy most of his weight fell on Draco making it nearly impossible to run. He was sure it was the end. Harry was sliding away from his grip. Then something jumped over his head, in that moment his knees gave out and he and Harry flopped, face first, onto the floor. With the little strength he had left he crawled backwards until he hit a tree trunk. He was dizzy. He saw what he could make out to be a centaur had scared the hooded figure away. The centaur approached him and Harry . He was sitting a few meters away from him, visibly disoriented.
Harry finally woke up on Saturday morning, after being out for week. They were finally able to put together what had happened when he had faced Quirrell, and from the little they had told them it was no mystery why it had taken such a blow on his body fiscally. Draco had the theory he had been awake for longer than they were saying, and just hadn’t been allowed to leave the hospital wing yet. Finally, after incessant begging the three of them were allowed to see Harry . Draco was relieved to see he looked completely back to normal, he wasn’t pale anymore, his hair wasn’t covered in blood, it was just messy as always, he looked like Harry again.
“of course, it was,” Hermione argued, “Harry got control of his broom when he lost focus,”
“son, I’m so glad to see you” she said releasing him, he smiled. “your father couldn’t make it” she apologized. He ignored the comment
“Yeah,” Harry simply managed.
“Yes, ladies and gentleman,” Lockhart spoke again over the crowd, and Draco could have sworn he looked directly at him, he felt his palms grow weirdly sweaty as Lockhart keep talking about his books, and gifted Harry a full collection. “- I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!” he said as the crowd bombed once again into applause Draco found himself clapping along.
“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?” said Firenze.
“Now tell me what happened,” she said calmly sitting across from him his mind was going a hundred miles an hour. He took a moment to breath and tried to collect himself and then he began to explain everything.
Never the less as the weeks went by, Draco has started to grow strangely fond of Grangers presence around him. Yet the constant thought of his father’s voice in the back of his head kept him from really talking to her at all. Still, he had tried to let go a bit of the hostility at least. Nonetheless, she was still a Mudblood, and he still was constantly aware of this fact even if she seemed to keep up to him in terms of every assignment. He now constantly found himself repeating this fact and the monologues of his father, every time he even thought of actually giving her a chance to become his friend. Still he could never fully shake the thought away, and bring himself to just not care.
“whatever, listen” he began “is it just me? Or doesn’t everything about the stone seem a bit strange to you” he said.
After the match the weeks only started to pass quicker, and Draco just wished time would stop. The corridors only got colder and colder, and the potions classroom became almost unbearably cold, so much so, that it made Draco not even look forward to his favorite class. He sometimes wondered if the Slytherin common room as cold as the potions classroom and found himself being thankfully for the save heaven of warmth the Gryffindor tower had become. He almost never left anymore. They four spend most of their time doing assignments and prepping for middle of the year exams. Or well he did, Hermione spend most of her time nagging the other two boys about unfinished assignments. Draco wondered if she knew she was basically the only reason they had not failed anything yet.
“what do we do now?” said Hermione exasperatedly sitting back down.
He woke up what he guessed was probably an hour or two later, to the sounds of muffled conversation outside the door.
“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as per usual.
“And why is that?” asked Hagrid. They looked at each other wondering if they should tell him about the theory they had been discussing.
“but what do we have here,” said peeves “Should tell Filch, I should It’s for your own good, you know,”
“I can’t say I do, no” he said
Moony lovegood.
“I’ll do it myself,” Harry whispered “I’m going to try and get to the Stone first.”
“but it’s – it's illegal” said Ron, Hagrid ignored him. “Hagrid in two weeks he will be as big as the house”  Ron said again. Hagrid was clearly getting annoyed.
“it’s mad, you all are jumping to conclusions,” Draco said they had had this discussion before he was sure it was not Snape. Hagrid dropped the teapot.
"Yes master," he heard another 'pop' and the elf was gone, along with all his Slytherin robes. A few moments later new robes materialized in his suit case and he aversely put them on, red was certainly not his color.
“I’m sorry,” she said after a few minutes. “But I didn’t know what to do,”
“Did his broom get damage or something” Hermione asked.
“mph” he cleared his throat. Harry sat up on his bed.
The following day went by fast. Draco spend the evening packing his bag to go back home he felt like he was going to be sick as he tucked all the essential belongings he would need for the holidays into a smaller bag to take with him.
Draco was as content as ever now feeling completely settled at Hogwarts. He didn’t even hesitate or think twice when putting his red and gold tie in the mornings, and didn’t often feel the urge to look at the Slytherin table, more than just to say hi to his friends. He didn’t even feel jealous of their shiny green ties anymore.
Hermione pulled out her wand. And stood behind Snape, the hem of his long black robes was accessible.
“Yes, but that was part of one of my father’s plans,” he said
“What is Potter doing” he said. Everyone around him turned their attention up in an instant the hole school was pointing at Potter.
“he’s not what my father hopes,” is all Draco said. “he’s not like any of our families hoped,” Pansy understood. “plus, there is the Granger problem I can’t really explain away why she has anything to do with the potter plan,” he said.
“or what Potter, you don’t even know what a hex is let alone how to cast one,” he laughed.
“He’s strange,” he said, “He doesn’t seem particularly academically inclined, which I'll admit made me dismiss him as first, but he's definitely magically gifted. More importantly, he is a natural leader and extremely perseverant, although, not particularly analytic,” Draco said, his father pondered on Draco’s words for a minute or two trying to decide what to think about Potter.
Double chapter this week, hope you enjoyed! let me know what you think have a good weekend!
“Just looking to find out who Flamel is you know,” Harry continued with a smirk. Hagrid just looked annoyed at them and looked like we had wanted to reprimand them but decided against it
Hello, thank you for reading, this was mostly a prologue so it's super short, hope you like it, this is the first fic long fic, that post since I decided to delete all of my other fic, so do know that even the smallest comment will be super appreciated. Cheers.
It was narrow and empty, and bight Sunday morning sun suddenly seemed to disappear above them. the shops at either side where filled with intriguing articles, scary looking creatures and vials of all shapes that immediately peaked Draco’s curiosity as they walked.  His father kept a quick pace rushing past them making Draco almost struggle to keep up. Finally, after a few turns they found themselves in front of an old corner building, the letters of the sing almost blurred away under the cracking wood.
“It’s potions yes, but not only that it a logic puzzle Potter, It's brilliant, a lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got any logic, they’d be stuck here forever.”
“I know,” replied pansy and they kept walking in silence. They reached the edge of the field and merged with the crowd of students entering the pitch on different sides. Draco warped his yellow and red scarf around his neck, and pansy put on her sliver and green hat, and they faced each other.
The rest of the day was equally painfully slow, they had their first history of magic and herbology classes, and even if Draco had always been a good student, it was hard to focus at times. Granger on the other hand didn’t seem to ever get tired of taking endless notes.
“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione ignored him and started flicking frantically through the pages.
Hermione just nodded “Right”. There was an awkward pause.
He was sat by the fire skimming the pages of one of Hermione’s novels she'd brought from home, some story about knights and wizards. He was absentmindedly flicking the pages processing the events of the previous days. He kept replaying the conversation he had heard McGonagall and Dumbledore having outside the door on his mind over and over again, somehow convinced it must have been something important, when it suddenly hit him.
She was out by the lake with Blaise and some other first year Draco didn’t know very well, Millicent Bulstrode. Draco didn’t really like her much, but Pansy had made her most recent adoption project as she often did.  He waved at pansy and made his way to the group.
“You cant,”  Harry screamed.
“how are you steeling in? you are getting some rest I hope,” his father said with a little more care that Draco was expecting, Draco tough he detected a hint of some emotion but he thought it might only be his imagination.
“Figured as much, I’ll owl for your books and cauldron tomorrow darling” she smiled knowingly and poured Draco a cup of tea.
(form the text; Lee jordans line, and lockharts introduction speech" )
Granger was nowhere to be seen when Draco entered the great hall, and he made his way to the Slytherin table as Halloween was one of the holidays where the students were allowed to share with other houses. He sat next to pansy who asked if he had heard that Granger had apparently been crying all day in a bathroom and questioned whether it was his fault. Not wanting to say that he actually wanted to defend her, he instead said proudly it was, and to his surprise lying to pansy made him feel a strange guilt. Draco keep scanning the hall with his eyes for any sight of Granger but the banquet was just about to begin and still no sing of her. The food suddenly materialized before him, strangely after a few months at the school it was starting to feel a little less exiting each time.
Potter looked like he was about to collapse he was still covered in dirt form the fall. he was sweaty and had a nauseous look, yet he smiled from ear to ear as he saw his them.
(Taken verbatim for the text for this chapter are, Seamus's line in the great hall, and a couple of Hagrid's lines from the hut scene.)
It  had been almost two hours of tossing a turning in his bed yet Draco could still not conceal sleep, the only thing in his head, was the question of what his father would say when he knew. He had to tell him, and soon or else he would find out form someone else and he knew that would be worse, rumors fly, but he just didn’t know want to even send.
“I just think, maybe they were somehow testing us” he said.
“Enough of that, how was your week Draco it feels like I haven’t seen you in ages,” pansy said.
“He thinks this door is locked,” Potter whispered “we are going to be okay,” he said. When Weasley pulled on his sleeve
Hermione shoot him a glare clearly meaning I told you so. Still he was sure it had nothing to do with Snape, he had lost attention and Potter had still struggled for a couple more seconds. He didn’t say a word.
“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore” Potter said, as Draco heard the name he had a sudden moment of clarity.
"Mr. Malfoy, you called’"
“Quite the accomplishment too, youngest seeker of the century”
He drew his wand and started to walk into the clearing to cast red sparks to alert that they had found the unicorn when Potter held out his arm to stop him. Draco was about to protest but then he saw what Potter had seen. A hooded figure approached the unicorn, it slithered brushing against the leaves on the floor with its cloak, it whooshed into the clearing with what Draco could only describe as ghost like motion, but there was something very off and unnatural about it that Draco could not quite place. The figured leaned into the unicorn’s neck and Draco had to resist all his urges to screams. Harry still with his arm out nudged him, they started to walk backwards slowly carful to not make Noise. Draco felt it before he heard it, he had accidently stepped on a branch that cracked, the hooded figure immediately turned, Draco panicked and was about to make a run for it, when he noticed Harry had fallen to his knees hands over his forehead he cried in pain.
Harry and Ron kept discussing guesses on what the mysterious object may be, all they knew it was small and apparently very very important. Their conversation was suddenly cut short by the appearance of the morning post. It was a busy morning for post, and what looked like about 200 owls started to fly in every direction into the great hall. Draco got sent some of his favorite chocolates by his mother, and though small this made him feel a little more like himself again. Never the less his attention was lost to a flock of about 5 owls that carried a package in unison. he was expecting it of course to be for one of the Slytherins. They loved a show. He could tell by the shape it was probably a broom, and it was a good way to let everyone know to have it delivered by the morning post. But to Draco’s surprised it landed instead right next to him in front of Potter. Knocking over the remainder of Draco’s breakfast.
“Wait, wait, think about it” he said accidentally sounding too much Hermione for his liking.
They had gotten almost nothing but Lockhart books of what they came for but Draco didn’t dare ask his father anything with that look of anger on his face still as he apparated them back home.
“what’s that?” Draco asked without really realizing he had spoken out loud.
“Lucius, welcome home,” his mother said standing up from her chair.
“As good as new” potter said. “what’s one more scar anyway” he said when he noticed Draco had accidentally been staring at the new mark on his neck.
“It was my best subject last year yes, but really, - I mean your son is better he got top of the class sir”  Harry said and Draco wished that he didn’t
They were then tasked with mixing up a potion to cure boils. Draco had done this simple potion before so he was not worried about the assignment, but rather he was worried about his partner. Pansy made her way to Draco’s table with all the ingredients in hand and set them down.
“Right,” He nodded and flung the cloak over his shoulder, once they finally found themselves alone, or so they thought,
To Draco’s suspire Hermione came downstairs anyway,
Finnegan and Thomas walked into the common room followed by one of the patil twins, Draco didn’t really know which one was which and at that point he felt it as too late to ask.
Draco felt like his soul had drop to his feet, ´the dark lord´ he had only ever heard stories, he let out a panicked sound.
He finally reached the great hall, and sat by himself at the farthest end of the Gryffindor table. When he was almost done eating he spotted a group of Slytherin's led by Crabbe walking into the great hall, proudly with their shiny new green ties. He made eyes with Pansy from across the hall, she looked at him with pity and went back to her apparent new friends. Draco was hurt, they had been practically raised together and all she could spare him was a glance. He kept eating his meal as the loud group  of the Weasleys and harry sat next to him.
When he finally got to the dorm he was greeted by none other than Potter and the weasel still wide-awake playing chess. The common room was otherwise empty except for Granger and some 7 years that were doing some assignments in the various tables. Perfect time to make the weasel and Potter angry Draco thought
He quickly stuffed his mouth full of food, in a very inelegant way, and ran upstairs to change into robes. He put on some black robes, that would have been elegant if wore by any other wizards, but the Malfoys appreciated being well dressed for every occasion. His father most of all, he usually whore very elegant clothes even for mundane things like going shopping at diagon-ally. Ever since he was young his father would tell him that it was always best to let everyone know how important you were even without saying anything, and that first impressions where always key. Since he started at Hogwarts he had started to take this advice with a bit of weariness as his own experience had proved this was not always right, but he rather not think about that much. He slicked his hair back and made his way down stairs just in time, as Dobby apparated in the living room telling his mother the car was at the front gate, and then disappeared again.
“At least tell me the plan so I can help,” he whispered.
“It’s just assignments Pans I’m fine, plus you know it’s just because our schedules are literally the complete opposite,” argued Draco. Pansy didn’t say anything and just started plucking at the brown grass.
“I know I know” he said and ruffle her hair.
“Exactly, I don’ know why Harry ’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’t’ try an’ kill a student! yer meddlin’ in things that don’ concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ you forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel,”
“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry said
“Last month I was down in the village having a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it,  Oh look It’s nearly out!” He exclaimed piking the egg out the cauldron carefully and setting it on the table at the center or the room. Something started moving inside, deep cracks formed on the surface of the egg, they watched with anticipation.
“To play on that new broom of yours you bet I will” Blaise said.
