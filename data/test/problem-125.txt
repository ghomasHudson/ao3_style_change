But he was also pretty sure that his feelings weren’t irremediable or unavoidable—not yet at least. He didn’t think that he
He wasn’t sure what to do with this line of thought, and his mind was a hot, late-summer haze, so he just kept staring. A silly smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. He giggled again, still looking right at Malfoy. Malfoy had made drugs that had given him some weird, intense dry orgasm in the middle of a fucking muggle restaurant. And now, if Harry could only get his brain to work, he might be able to figure out how he and Malfoy might give each other more orgasms—
“Erm, yeah,” Harry scratched the back of his head, clearing his throat, “Had to make sure Draco made it through the night ok, you know...”
Draco everything. And Draco let him, went slack in his grip and looked up at him, wide-eyed and whimpering.
detail, mind you—for Harry and me to indulge in exactly this sort of behavior, so I really don’t see what you’re complaining about, now you’ve gotten what you wanted?”
“Well, me too, I’m going with you,” He felt his face go scarlet, “And not just Los Angeles, also— Oh, open the black one first, and I’ll explain.”
“God, Harry,” he moaned, “You’re so— I’ve wanted you—you’re so good, you’re fucking perfect—” and Harry let out one thin, high, whimper, and Draco’s hips drove forward and stayed there, grinding in as he seized up and then stilled, chest heaving.
Potter greeted him warily, ordering a scotch, neat, which he promptly drained halfway before turning to Draco and asking, “What are
Harry’s hand tightened around his quill and he shifted in his seat, “I mean, I like music when I hear it, but I never really… got into anything in particular, you know?”
Draco slit open the envelope, fishing out… two more envelopes, one white and one black. His eyes narrowed. “What is this, some kind of birthday card Russian doll?”
Draco held up a silencing finger, “You just love us all so much, your dearest friends, the lights in your otherwise dim life, the very reason you get out of bed every morning to face the day—”
“Harry,” Hermione said kindly, “When you’ve hurt someone… they don’t have to forgive you, even if you apologize.”
Ron pulled up a chair. “So, are you just going to stay here indefinitely or are you going to go home at any point? Change out of your clothes that’ve got Draco’s guts all over them? I don’t know, take a shower, maybe?”
—” he stood abruptly, knocking the chair out behind him and slamming his hands on the table, “—is going on here?!”
“I didn't mean— When you said I’m playing a game with you… do you think I— that I’ve been making fun of you or something? All this time?”
Oh Potter, I’m flattered, but of course I can’t say I’m surprised,” he drawled, leaning in closer, reckless, “I knew you were always staring at me in school, you know. You weren’t that subtle.”
—so good.” And Harry moaned frantically around his fingers, thrusting his hips erratically. “Fuck, Harry,” Draco growled, sitting up, tilting Harry’s hips in and pressing their torsos together, “You look so hot like this,” Harry made a high, desperate sound and Draco slipped his hand around between them, trapping Harry’s cock against the fine, damp fabric of his shirt. “I want to watch you come, Harry, come on, make yourself come,” and then Harry went rigid, and shuddered, his whole body tensing as he cried out, and Draco felt the warm wetness seeping into his shirt and spreading across his stomach, and Harry went boneless on top of him, finally bringing his arms around to clutch weakly at Draco’s collar.
He sipped his beer, half-listening as Potter droned on about the number of scholarships they were hoping to fund this year, wistfully contemplating the hair on Potter’s forearms and the neat flick of his wrist as he turned to the next sheaf of parchment.
. He still had those sharp, haughty features that made Harry’s fingers itch, but even sitting he looked taller than Harry remembered, and there was something in the set of his face, the jut of his jaw, something sure, something mutinous. His white-blond hair was spiked up, his piercing grey eyes were ringed in smudgy black, and his left eyebrow was pierced— it was all certainly
“Don’t think you can distract me with flattery,” he pointed his fork into Harry’s face, “How are you feeling? Are you ok?”
At eight o’clock, Harry apparated to a dingy alley a few streets away from the venue, tucked his wand away, rolled his shoulders, muttered to himself,
subtle Pans—and I just, honestly, he got called into the office around 10 but if he hadn’t I think he would have made a move on me, I really do, and I can’t figure it out.”
And this surprised him too: that love was a choice, not an irrevocable force. That he could, if he chose, keep things the way they were, love Draco just as he always had, and he would be satisfied. But he could also choose something else—he and Draco could choose some other kind of love, together. Harry just had to decide whether to ask Draco to make that choice with him.
Draco blinked. And then, before he could think better of it, he leaned in, extending a hand, “Come back to mine?”
“Ah,” Draco said gently, ignoring the sudden sensation that his stomach was attempting to escape his body through his throat. He swiveled around to knock his shoulder against Potter’s. “Asking for a friend, are we?”
Draco cleared his throat. “I don’t think you’re a psychopath, Harry. I— I may have been engaging in some, ah, shall we say, self-protective mental gymnastics…”
Harry went to collect Draco on Saturday. He wasn’t well enough to apparate or floo yet, so Harry took Sirius’ old motorbike, which he knew would make Draco happy. Draco loved the motorbike; he said it made him feel like a muggle flirting with death, except Harry always cast extra-strength protection charms on them whenever they rode it. It was bitterly cold, but they took the roundabout way home, cheeks stinging. Back at Grimmauld, Harry packed Draco a fat bowl and sent him up for a hot bath, ordering takeaway while he waited. He puttered around the kitchen aimlessly until Draco trailed in, baked and bleary-eyed, smiling in exhausted contentment and wearing his old Green Day sweatshirt. Harry loved that sweatshirt. Draco had gotten it when the two of them went to see Green Day at Wembley Arena, a couple weeks before his birthday that first summer that they’d been friends. Harry had just gotten his ears pierced, and Ron had laughed at him in an affectionate sort of way, and Ginny had said approvingly that it was an effective way of letting everyone know that he was definitely never going back to the Aurors. Draco had told him he looked like Billie Joe Armstrong,
. Circe was a twitchy thing, skinny and spastic, skidding through the rooms and rubbing frantically against Harry’s ankles.
“Holy shit,” he whispered again, locking eyes with Malfoy, mouth open on a gasp, “I feel—I feel like I’m
Harry started. Could he do that? Go to a concert with Draco Malfoy? He opened his mouth to reply and found himself saying, “Yeah, yeah I would. Where is it? And what time?”
He slid into his seat and took a long swallow, then slowly set his glass down. “It was Draco,” he said tonelessly. Hermione’s hands flew to her mouth.
“It’s alright,” José flushed slightly. “I just think it’s,” he pursed his lips, “It’s bad for your health.”
In the wake of his late-night indiscretion, Harry examined his newfound lust closely. It had taken him by surprise. He had thought all the familiarity between he and Draco would stand in the way, that desire could only be discovered fresh and new—that quick flash of want when you catch someone’s eye for the first time. He had thought that love grew from passion, and not the other way around. But that wasn’t what he had ever wanted, was it? Harry had wanted to be known. He had thought it wasn’t possible; Draco hadn’t either. They understood, intuitively, the impossibility of being known by a lover—being really and truly seen by someone who honestly understood all the fucked up shit and didn’t shy away from it. No one was willing or able to go through that for them. And probably no one would, they had been right about that.
Hermione’s eyes softened. “Sorry, Harry, we’re not trying to pile on, it’s just, maybe there’s a reason none of your relationships last?”
But he was used to it, is all. He and Draco took each other as dates to most formal functions: ministry events and charity balls, art openings, and in recent years, an ever-increasing number of weddings. It was, for all intents and purposes, just two friends showing up together. But they made it more fun than that. They always found subtle ways to coordinate their outfits, and went out for posh dinners beforehand, and took photos together in front of the flower arrangements. It was another thing that their friends made fun of them for, but really, why should only romantic couples get to do that sort of thing? Harry didn’t see what the difference was; he didn't get why you had to be sleeping with someone to get your place settings next to each other.
?” he said, incredulous, “I haven’t seen you since you were skiving off games to whinge about a little scratch on your arm,” he laughed. There was a split second of painful silence, and Potter grimaced beside him.
“Woah, woah, Malfoy, what are you doing?” Potter showed his palms, frowning, as though he genuinely had no idea why Draco wasn’t laughing too.
At that, Draco’s dance partner nimbly extricated himself from between the two of them, nodded politely at Draco, and stepped into Blaise’s welcoming embrace. Harry shrugged and wove through the sticky crowd to close their tab. When he got back and grabbed Draco’s hand, shouting,
He glanced at the note again, frowning. “Just me… I’ve no idea why, I don’t even work on future-related matters.”
Draco stroked soothingly through Harry’s hair and down his back, whispering in his ear how good he had been, and steadfastly ignoring the fact that he hadn’t come yet, was still hard and throbbing inside of Harry. And after a moment, Harry noticed it too, lifting his head from Draco’s shoulder with a hitch of breath, saying, soft and uncertain, “You still—” Draco wound his hands around Harry’s hips and thrust up, gently, and Harry whimpered.
—was the one who was supposed to make it happen? To say the words and cast the binding magic? What if he fucked something up?
at Harry and frankly, curry chips sounded like a vast improvement over this whole situation, so Harry just screamed
The scratching on the window grew harder to ignore. Grumbling, he dragged himself out of bed and across the room. Harry’s little brown owl was at the window again. He contemplated shooing it away, but it looked at him so apologetically he couldn’t help letting it in for a treat. The owl winged over to him and dropped a parcel, hooted at him in solidarity, and flapped back out. Draco begrudgingly unwrapped the parcel, seeing that it was the latest
As they stumbled from bar to club, clutching each other and talking too loudly, Harry found himself with his arm slung round Seamus, discussing Draco’s prospects for the night. He was walking just ahead of them, tall and lanky and somehow still elegant even as he swayed dangerously, leaning into Greg’s sturdy shoulder. Everyone was dressed to the nines, but Draco—in a sheer, shimmery black shirt (unbuttoned halfway, of course), tucked into ripped black skinny jeans, rings on his fingers and kohl around his eyes—he wasn’t going to have any trouble pulling tonight.
Draco was sitting alone at the edge of the bar. He had an expensive scotch in his hands; Harry watched as he brought it slowly up to his mouth and sipped, deliberate and controlled. His back was very straight. Harry sidled up next to him.
sound, arching up slightly. Draco took him apart like that, slow and sweet. When Harry pulsed out over his fingers with a weak cry, Draco buried his face in the crook of Harry’s neck, thrusting deep and stuttering out his own release. As he rolled off, cleaning them both with a wave of his hand, Harry reached for him, fitting them together the way they had woken up a year ago—Draco wrapped around Harry, arm around his chest, nose in his hair. Harry hummed contentedly, snuggling back against him. Draco nuzzled Harry’s neck, holding him as their breathing slowed.
“And I certainly don’t want to put pressure on us to take any serious steps anytime soon. I’m happy just being with you.”
Harry hadn’t noticed much else about the man other than the soothing quality of his voice, pouring into Harry’s ears garbled, in fits and starts, like a poorly tuned wireless.
Draco pressed a kiss to his mouth, dragged his lips along Harry’s jaw, nipping his earlobe. “Take the edge off, yeah? We’ve got—” he rocked his hips and Harry could feel him, hard and pressed against his stomach, “So much time.”
“Alright, alright…” Harry shook his head, resigned, “But I’m serious Ron, nothing’s going to happen.”
He felt Harry’s hand wrap around his chest, Harry’s nose along the back of his neck, breath hot as he whispered, “Yeah, like that.”
“Right,” Harry said, taking a deep breath, his nerves easing slightly. “Right, ok, yeah, it’s just music, which we both like, we’ll just go and listen to the music and it won’t be weird. Ok.” He started toward the door and then turned back around, “Oh bollocks, Hermione, what do I wear?”
. Teasing Draco constantly with juvenile sexual innuendo, biting his lip, standing too close. And Draco knew he was being messed with. He knew Potter couldn’t actually be hitting on him. The overtures were too over the top, and he was
They ate Christmas Eve dinner in the kitchen. Harry cooked again; Draco mostly drank wine and watched him. Over a truly delectable seafood pasta, Harry nervously asked Draco whether he might like to go to his aunt Andromeda’s for breakfast the next morning. It was easy to beg off the Weasleys, but Teddy, being a small child, hadn’t taken the news of Harry’s possible absence with as much grace. Draco felt a tight clench in his chest. He had met Andromeda a few times after the war, but their relationship, if it could even be called that, was a tenuous one. He’d wanted more, wanted to know this part of his family that wasn’t poison, but he didn’t want to push her—she had lost so much. He responded haltingly, stammering, and Harry reassured him that he had told Andromeda all about his machinations, and she had signed up for a free one-month trial of
Hermione shrieked and practically toppled out of her armchair. Ron, laughing, said “Good on you, mate. I’d never even have thought to ease into it at the muggle bars—brilliant, really.”
“I don’t even care,” Harry breathed, sticking his head back in from the deck, crossing the room and flopping down next to Draco.
Two weeks after the New Year, Harry was sitting in a spindly chair at Draco’s bedside in St. Mungo’s, monitoring charms humming beside him, a curtain drawn around the bed. They were good at their job; the best at Gringotts, if he wasn’t being modest. They were always careful too. It was honestly a trainee move, to miss a blasting curse like that… Harry shuddered, reaching out to take Draco’s cool, limp hand in his own, stroking his thumb over Draco’s knuckles.
, he didn’t regret that either. It would cheapen their friendship, to regret it. Harry didn’t think they had lost or wasted any time—nothing that had happened between them before was wasted; it was all precious.
After—when they rolled away from the wet spot and lay close under the blankets, half-dozing, Draco running a warm palm over Harry’s back, Harry touching his fingertips to the tip of Draco’s nose, the round knob of his shoulder—he thought about saying it then. Saying
Harry padded softly down the stairs early Saturday morning, still in his pyjamas, fists balled in an old Weasley jumper. He followed the sound of the blasting stereo to find Draco in the drawing room, already showered and dressed, shooting cleaning spells in every direction and shouting,
“Shoulda done the bedside confession of love…" Ron shook his head at Harry, wearing an expression so reminiscent of Molly that Harry had to bury his face in his food, shoving a huge bite of ziti into his mouth to stifle his laughter.
Draco lay still beneath him, panting and sticky. Harry allowed himself to look for one more moment before finally giving into the now hours-old urge to collapse into the plush cocoon of the duvet. He felt the warm wash of Draco’s magic sending cleaning charms over them both, and then the warmer press of Draco’s hand over his ribs. He rolled over to nuzzle into Draco’s chest. He felt wrung out, like the past couple of hours with Draco had squeezed every ounce of tension from his body, leaving him loose, and weak, and—finally—at rest.
“No!” Potter said quickly. “Of course not. I was just— I was wondering—” he broke off, running a hand through his hair and then turning away from Draco to press his forearms to the bar top, clenching his fists. “How did you know?”
?” They were curled up across from each other on Draco’s sofa; he’d flooed her to come over immediately as soon as he’d gotten home from work.
When Draco went to use the loo, he mused to himself that it felt like they’d been talking for hours, at which point he realized they
Potter flushed and ran a hand through his hair. “Ah, just a couple of weeks? I ran into him at the Puddlemere after party that weekend when they stomped on the Cannons.”
“Liquid center,” Malfoy beamed, “You wouldn’t believe how finicky it’s been, but I finally wrangled it into submission yesterday.”
Malfoy just kept looking at him, still and somehow fragile as Harry ran the tips of his fingers across Malfoy’s shoulders, down the center line of his torso, over the flaring of his ribs. Then he was questing back up, up onto the skin of Malfoy’s neck, and that was soft too, Malfoy’s eyes fluttering closed as Harry’s fingers pressed in, swept around and tangled in the hair at the base of Malfoy’s scalp.
“Oui, c’est magnifique,” he proclaimed, plucking the joint from Harry’s fingers and taking another hit before levitating it over to Ginny.
“Look, Hermione, sorry to interrupt, but I’ve told Malfoy I’ll go to a muggle rock concert with him tonight and I—"
Draco hummed. “Weren’t we in the middle of a conversation? I’m sorry, I’m only just realizing I interrupted you with my mouth,” he grinned, unrepentant, radiant.
Draco was right, they had so much time, so Harry didn’t rush at all. He waited until he could slide three fingers in, slick and easy; waited until the sheets under Draco’s hips were soaked with lube and sticky with precome; waited until he heard the word
“Like this,” Harry breathed, spreading his thighs and drawing his knees up, exposing himself to Draco. Looking down at him, Draco swallowed thickly and nodded once, hard. Harry summoned a bottle of lube from a drawer in his nightstand and pressed it into Draco’s hand. Coating his fingers, he reached down, watching Harry’s eyes widen and his breath quicken. He worked Harry open slowly, kissing him, until Harry was panting and squirming beneath him, and he huffed out, “God, Draco, are you going to make me beg—” and Draco grinned wickedly down at him, “I want to hear you ask for it.”
The orange sun hung low in the sky and Molly had just cut the enormous chocolate cake she had baked. The Weasleys had thrown a small party like they did every year, just family and a few friends—casual, intimate. Draco shifted his gaze to Ron standing next to Harry and raised an eyebrow. Ron inclined his head in the barest hint of a nod. Draco cast a
Over the next week, Malfoy delivered a crash course in muggle rock music, filling in every moment of office down time with animated lectures, gesticulating wildly as he raved about sticking it to The Man, flushing a little as he queued up his favorite songs. As Harry started listening, he realized that he liked it. He
“Yeah, d’you think so? I was a little nervous, honestly, usually I just buy everyone’s dinner you know,” he laughed, “but I wanted to do something special this year.”
José’s eyes snapped to Harry, “What whole thing?” His tone was light but his eyes were considerably less warm than they’d been a minute earlier.
“Well…” Harry faltered and frowned, thinking. Didn’t he ever go on holiday alone with someone he wasn’t romantically interested in? “I’ve gone on holiday with Ron,” he proclaimed, triumphant.
“Ah. Well, I could go to a wizarding spot, but I tend not to be interested in the men that are interested in me.”
“Although,” she cocked her head thoughtfully, “I wouldn’t have expected you to leap right into things with a bunch of strangers Harry,” her eyes crinkled, “you’re such a romantic.”
Pansy raised her eyebrows expectantly, and Draco busied himself tearing off a bite of croissant and spreading jam on it. He popped it in his mouth and chewed slowly, swallowed. He looked up.
“I suppose not, I mean, I think a concert might be fun, I’ve never been to one before, you know? But with Malfoy? I just…” he grimaced.
, and he must simply find it funny, for reasons Draco didn’t understand and didn’t care to examine. It hurt a bit, actually, that Potter had chosen to inflict this particular joke on Draco, when Draco was so helplessly attracted to him. It made him sharp—tense and cold around Potter, which only seemed to spur him on further. And he was so guileless, Draco couldn’t even blame him; he was still so
Draco Malfoy liked to come to the Leaky Cauldron when he was feeling sappy, or lonely (or sometimes both). The fact that he, only a little more than four years after the War, could walk up to the bar and make polite small talk with old Tom over a tumbler of Ogden’s finest was, he felt, nothing short of a miracle. Of course, he’d done his utmost to be accepted back into the fold, and to deserve it too. But sometimes he needed a reminder that it was real. So when he felt the doubts creep in, he came to the center of wizarding London, to remind himself that he belonged. Usually it was enough. But tonight was Christmas Eve, and Draco was feeling especially lonely. He should have been in Paris with his mum, who’d fucked off there and never looked back after her house arrest lifted three years ago. He usually spent the holidays with her. But this year, in a fit of sentimentality, he’d wanted to spend Christmas in London. He’d thought he wouldn’t have minded being alone, that he would enjoy the season as a spectator, soaking up everyone else’s good cheer by osmosis. He’d been extremely, colossally wrong.
“So, José,” Blaise drawled, “I have to ask, what is it exactly that you see in our dear Draco here?”
anything that could risk it. So, I just... didn’t.” He shrugged. “Still a coward, deep down, even after all these years.”
“No, of course I’m not mad.” He pulled Harry under the spray, “I am, however, questioning my own mental state, since I actually found that
His eyes caught on Draco and José across the table, who seemed to be having an intimate moment, José whispering something in Draco’s ear and Draco lowering his lids and blushing furiously. He couldn’t hide anything with that complexion. Harry smiled fondly into his drink.
Harry knew that Malfoy had struggled to find work after the war, bouncing between dodgy potions shops on Knockturn. But when the laws changed, he managed to purchase a little shopfront at the edge of Diagon—tucked away at the end of the lane, faded and peeling, so small that no one else wanted to buy it. A few months later, a swinging board sign hung out over the door, painted a soft moss green with the words
, about Draco, wanted him around more than anyone else, wanted to be nearest to him wherever they were.
Harry kept watching as Malfoy drew the spoon slowly from between his lips, feeling a bit dizzy. He looked down at his own lemon square. His mouth watered. Slowly, he lowered his spoon. It slipped right through the buttery whipped cream, through the thick, smooth custard—
Draco shrugged again, then sighed. “I shouldn’t have got my hopes up, anyways.” He cast his eyes down. “I thought maybe if I dated someone normal, then I could be normal, you know?”
Draco challenged Harry to a hike that he had done once before, right off of Highway 1, the route they’d driven up the coast.
but it had been a near thing, at the end, and now finally Potter was braced behind him, hands tight on Draco’s hips, thrusting into him maddeningly slowly, and Draco was whining, turning his face into the cushions and clenching his teeth against that urge to beg, clawing its way up his spine.
Harry took another bite. He had never tasted anything like it—the sharp lemon, sour-sweet and cold, the feel of the crust in his mouth, warm with cinnamon and ginger, the crunch of the sugared pecans on top and the velvet whipped cream. All his senses were singing, his mouth throbbing as he let the cool, creamy filling melt on his tongue, chewed the crust methodically, reverently. He took another bite. Distantly, he was aware that he was making noise, moaning indecently, sexually even. It was mortifying, but he couldn’t hold it in; he had no control, his body reacting to the stimuli like a light at the mercy of its switch. He took another bite. His chest was heaving, and he realized with a humiliating mixture of horror and arousal that he was grinding his arse down into the chair, spreading his legs, stretching the fabric of his trousers tight against his crotch. He took another bite. He felt sublime, rapturous, vibrating with energy, unable to focus on anything save the overwhelming pleasure blooming from his tongue and beating through his body. He took another bite. Sensation was building, pulsing up through his solar plexus and radiating down his arms, tingling waves of pleasure, crescendoing up and up—he took another bite.
Or maybe Harry was just lonely. So lonely that he had finally gone off the deep end and succumbed to the wild ravings of his so-called friends. He huffed and rolled over, burying his face in his pillow.
Draco snorted, waving a lazy hand, “Me, Harry, what’s the difference?” He took a swallow of tea, “Would you like to come for brunch? I’m sure you’ll be welcome to watch the game after, although…” he trailed off, “it might be a bit… loud.”
Harry helped himself to a few bites, mostly content to watch Draco gorge himself. Eventually, he started to slow, dabbing at the corners of his mouth with a spare napkin and fixing Harry with self-satisfied look, “Now that I’ve got my strength back and I can gloat properly—I’ve got a date with José next Friday.”
Of course, Harry knew he looked good too. Frankly, he hadn’t had time to be self-conscious about his looks back in school but if he had, he probably would have fretted most about being so scrawny. He wasn’t underfed anymore, but he had stayed on the skinny side. It suited him, though—Draco always said he was proportionate, compact and wiry. Once, after a few drinks, Hermione had said that his childhood with the Dursleys had probably permanently stunted his growth, and immediately got this horrified look in her eyes and clapped a hand over her mouth, apologizing for being so clinical about it, so callous. Harry wasn’t really bothered though. It was probably true, in any case, and it lent support to his theory that he was stunted on the inside too.
Hermione huffed, turning back to Harry. “I think, yet again, you two are more similar than you recognize. He just needs a little push.”
Draco smirked. “Harry,” he clasped their hands together, “My wish, on this New Year, is that you and I find love and settle down… with…” he winked, “whomever we’re meant to be with.”
“I’m just not used to listening to music. I never did, growing up. And I don’t know, now it’s just… not my habit? It kind of feels—” he frowned, “—too late really to develop, like, particular tastes…”
Harry stumbled over to the bar, intent on drowning his self-pity in yet another gin. He had just smacked his empty glass on the bartop when he felt a nudge to his elbow.
It was well past close at the Ministry on a Friday and the Unspeakables in the Time Department were working late yet again. It had been a shite day capping off a shite week and Draco really didn’t have the patience for whatever tedious, bullshit request surely awaited within this blasted memo. His eyes flickered over the page and he froze, clearing his throat before he spoke.
Well, Harry had had enough. On Thursday afternoon, he just so happened to be chatting with Roberta in payroll as she finished the monthly expense reports. As she was about to drop them into the “out” box, Harry volunteered to walk them over to financial himself—he’d been on desk duty all day, you know, he’d appreciate the excuse to stretch his legs. He didn’t let himself think too deeply about what he was doing on his way over there—maybe he would run into Malfoy, maybe not. But Malfoy was nowhere to be seen. Harry dropped off the reports, made polite small talk with the head witch in charge of payroll—yes, he had no complaints about Roberta, she was splendid and always helped him get his overtime paperwork in on time, really, he had only walked the reports down to get a bit of exercise—and turned to go, wondering if perhaps Malfoy had been kidnapped, or moved abroad.
,” he drawled, a lascivious grin spreading across his face. “And you? You’re looking… hot and bothered.”
Draco’s hand was there on his face, fingers resting gently against his cheekbone, warm palm cradling his jaw. He knew the feeling of Draco’s touch. But now it flayed him, drew the strength from his joints. He shivered. Draco hummed contentedly, wrapping his other hand around Harry’s waist. Steady, he held Harry close, swaying slightly. And Harry, for all his worrying, hadn’t expected that it would feel so… safe. That it would feel how it always felt, stepping into Draco’s arms like sinking into a warm bath. And he really must be an idiot because he’d thought it would feel like jumping off a cliff. A small burble of laughter escaped his throat, and Draco pulled back, smiling, slipping off Harry’s glasses and setting them on the table, “What is it?”
“You feel so good— so good inside me,” he whispered, and Draco tilted his chin up and kissed him. He still tasted of lemons.
It wasn’t exactly normal, Harry knew, how much more he felt about Draco. The intensity of it scared him sometimes; his chest got tight with a thumping mix of fear and excitement and joy. But that didn’t mean they should
“Undo my trousers,” Draco panted, unwilling to stop fingering Harry, curling his other hand around the top of his thigh. Harry brought his arms around with a gasp, his fingers clumsy and frantic.
“Gosh, I should have guessed something like that,” Hermione was shaking her head, chuckling, “I mean, just knowing the two of you, the evidence obviously points in that direction—”
,” he hissed, and then he felt the low reverberation of a moan from the back of Potter’s throat, and Potter closed his lips around Draco’s fingers and
Draco’s gaze hardened. “I’ve been having more nightmares recently, you know…” Harry knew. He didn’t let go of Draco’s hand. They both always backslid a little in the last weeks of April. “He said that I self-medicate with drugs and alcohol and use shows as a way to vent my emotions, and that it wasn’t sustainable. I was like—maybe I just like getting a bit sozzled every now and again and shoving people around in a mosh pit because it’s fucking fun? What the fuck? And then!
Naked, he looked at Draco, biting his lip, breathing shallow. Draco cocked his head, skimming his eyes up and down Harry’s body.
“What the fuck?” he muttered to himself, looking around. No one appeared to be approaching as the song—it was actually quite catchy—continued to blare in the background. Draco allowed himself to stew silently for approximately three more seconds, watching the mystery singer shimmy awkwardly on a stage, flanked by two generic blonde background dancers.
Harry swallowed down that feeling too, and stretched his mouth as wide as he could, tried to look truly pleased, hoped his voice didn’t sound strained as he said,
Draco’s mouth twisted. “No, I— Well, you were the reason I left, actually, I certainly wasn’t planning
kids have access to enriching extracurricular activities, no matter how much money their parents have. I’ve been fighting for this cause for years, and I hope that this year we can raise even more scholarship money than we ever have before. To publicly reaffirm my devotion to this cause, I’ll be personally pledging an amount that will cover camp attendance for five first-time attendees. So to those kids out there who are worried that they won’t be able to go to Quidditch Camp this summer, I’m here to say: I will never give up on you, I will never let you down—”
Potter laughed ruefully and Draco felt suddenly vindictive. He knew this was what Potter deserved—a big strong quidditch star with a kind smile and an easy rapport with the rest of Potter’s friends, the type of relationship the wizarding world would fawn over. “I’m surprised I haven’t seen you two in the papers yet,” he slurred snidely.
Hermione blinked. She hadn’t let on once all week but right then, Draco knew that she knew. He closed his eyes and sucked in a breath.
“I mean, pretty fucking sorry for myself, obviously, but I’d take it. I’m sure I’d get over it eventually and I’m going to stay friends with him no matter what.” Harry heard his voice get fierce, and he knew it was true.
Harry let out a wet laugh, relief flooding warm through his limbs, making him lightheaded. “Yeah, because I slept here, you arsehole—” he gestured at the cot, blushing and busying himself pouring Draco a glass of water.
.” Draco swallowed, still sluggish with the shock of Harry’s revelation, frozen in place. Harry rolled his eyes, filling the silence, “I mean, you did stick your fingers in my mouth, so I sort of think I was right and you
“Quite,” Draco nodded. “And I realized I wasn’t interested in hiding that way. I didn’t want to sneak around and come home to a wife. I wanted to come home to someone I loved properly.” As he said it, he felt the sharp stab of the knowledge that he probably still would never have that. He sighed, “I suppose I’m a hopeless romantic.”
Draco’s birthday was on a Tuesday that year (the Tuesday after Ron and Hermione’s wedding, no less), so they had planned a celebratory outing for the following Saturday. Draco’s birthday was always a big deal—wild parties, lavish dinners, clubbing—whatever he chose, they pulled out all the stops. This year, he was taking everyone out to a posh new restaurant in Chelsea, and then they were hitting the bars. Everyone was determined to get him laid in the wake of his breakup with José—Harry had told Draco that ensuring his sexual satisfaction would be Harry’s special gift to him this year. But that was a lie.
Harry had been practically crawling out of his skin all week leading up to Susan’s party. He had seen Draco once, in the atrium at the end of the day, and they had chatted for a few minutes before heading home. He’d managed to comport himself like a sane person, stringing together full sentences and only stammering a little, despite the buzzing in his ears and tightness in his throat.
they all were, and Draco muttered, “I told you they have no boundaries,” and José laughed, white teeth bared.
“Right then,” said Ron, “Shagging, in all the ways you fancy it. Seamus and I wish a good shagging upon you both!”
Washing his hands after he had finished up at the urinal, Harry examined his reflection in the smudged mirror. The dim light flickered. What the hell was he doing here? Had he really thought this wouldn’t be awkward? It was excruciatingly awkward. But he couldn’t leave; that would be even worse. He just had to go back out there and sit quietly with Malfoy while they waited and then, what? Stand quietly with Malfoy while the band played? Oh god. At least he’d had the sense to wear a black shirt—he had already started sweating. He took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. There was nothing else for it. He pushed open the door and headed back to the bar.
Harry was as attentive as Draco remembered, asking what he liked, gauging his reactions, chasing his pleasure, and Draco realized he was close in an embarrassingly short time.
Harry obeyed, blinking slowly as Malfoy cast healing spells, cracking his nose back into place and siphoning the blood off his face and clothes, cooling his swollen skin and repairing the broken capillaries underneath.
“Harry! Don’t interrupt, for goodness sakes—I just want to tell you how I’m feeling! I’ve got to make you understand!”
? Harry thought everyone should be able to celebrate the end of the war. And he was ticked off about having to play the role of Honorable Gracious Benevolent Savior, and he wanted to stick it to everyone, so he invited Draco as his date. Draco was a flurry of nerves for weeks beforehand, dragging them both to Savile Row nearly every night after work, experimenting with different ways of styling Harry’s hair, backing out in fits of panic and then wringing his hands, saying that actually yes, he did want to go.
At Harry’s prompting, Ron eagerly launched into a description of the multi-course menu he had planned at the caterer’s tasting the following week. Harry, who had volunteered himself as assistant taste-tester, listened raptly. As he ate his way through two more plates of ziti, Ron regaled him with a dramatic retelling of the latest incident with the guest list—a second cousin of Molly’s had asked to bring her kneazle (
“No!” Shrieked Ginny, “Please, no! Harry, I’ve gone years without seeing you naked and I don’t fancy a flashback.”
“Ah,” Harry shook his head, some of the fuzz clearing out of his thoughts. “Don’t mention it. It’s—we both gave as good as we got.”
Harry wanted very badly to fuck Malfoy. He wanted to crawl across the table, undo his trousers and sit down right on his cock, as he licked the rest of Malfoy’s lemon bar from his fingers.
So, Harry followed Malfoy through the door at the back of the shop and up a narrow, rickety staircase to Malfoy’s flat, which he had never seen before.
Potter ran a hand through his hair, half of which was already standing on end, “I knew you were working late tonight—Hermione mentioned—and I thought you might appreciate a break?” He grimaced. Apparently it was finally starting to dawn on him that Draco was not amused.
Draco groped dimly for the edge of the bed behind him, dropping unsteadily to a seat as he smoothed out the cover. A photo of Harry’s face was plastered across it, Draco watched on a loop as photo-Harry worried his lower lip self-consciously, and then, likely at the direction of the cameraperson, smoothed his brow and attempted a nervous smile. Emblazoned across the top was the headline
“Alright, Harry,” Hermione said, shaking out her napkin and sliding in across from him. “What’s on your mind?”
Harry blinked. “I—” he shut his mouth, swallowed, “I guess I just don’t really know where to start.”
Harry scratched Cassie behind the ears. It wouldn’t do to look up at Draco, lest his face reveal how he felt about Draco spending all foreseeable birthdays turning down would-be conquests and slouching on the sofa with Harry at the end of the night.
“Sow your wild oats, Harry!” Ron shouted from the floor, raising a bottle of wine in Harry’s direction. Hermione giggled, refilling her own glass.
Draco tried to catch his breath, but it was a bit difficult with Potter dead-weighted on top of him. He hadn’t made to move off Draco at all—he hadn’t even pulled out. Draco didn’t really mind it, the suffocating weight of Potter draped over him, Potter still inside him, but he did have that irritating need to breathe. Elbowing at Potter’s limp form, he managed to gasp out a protest, and Potter obligingly and apologetically rolled off of him. Draco flopped onto his back and sucked in a lungful of air, throwing an arm over his face. After a beat, he waved a hand, sending a gentle cleaning charm over them both. At that, Potter started, and Draco felt a hand hesitantly brush across his chest.
count the Weird Sisters fourth year…” he paused, mouth working for a moment as a slight frown creased his brow. “Do you— would you like to come with me?”
“Oh,” Harry flattened his palm against Draco’s back and flexed his fingers. “I… wish I could stay. I’ll see you—”
Hermione took a sip of wine. “And what will you do, when Draco moves out to have babies with someone else?”
“Right,” Harry laughed nervously, “Well I suppose I wasn’t being very subtle… I mean, you look pretty spectacular—the costume! The costume is spectacular.” God, he should never open his mouth again for the rest of his life.
“Alright, alright, cool it you great honking idiot,” Ron fished a small package out of his pocket, unshrinking it to reveal a fat pastrami sandwich, a dill pickle, a small tin of potato salad and a chocolate chip cookie practically the size of Harry’s face.
Draco grinned, rolling his eyes. “Of course not. There’ll be no peace for us until we’re at our own weddings. Even then, they probably won’t leave us alone if we’re not marrying each other.”
, Draco had said. Harry had taken another look at Circe’s matted black fur and bright green eyes, and said, incredulous,

“That’s a euphemism for enjoying my fine arse,” Draco smirked, cheekily biting into a scone, tongue darting out to lick a bit of jam off his top lip.
crying. Neville and Greg sat on plush cushions across the rug, Greg hunched over the low coffee table with his rolling papers—you wouldn’t guess it from the size of his fingers, but he rolled the best joints out of any of them, by far. Neville had hired him to work in his greenhouses when he’d been released from Azkaban a couple of years after the War and couldn’t get any other work. Draco called them the gentle giants, behind their back. To their faces, he called them
.” He signaled the bartender for a shot, although he felt rather like he was going to be sick. When it came, he downed it and ordered another.
Harry stumbled back to the table in a haze. “Alright mate?” Ron looked up at him as he approached, “you look like you’ve just seen your boggart.”
phase,” he grabbed one of the various bottles of champagne bobbing in the air around their heads and topped off Harry’s flute.
Potter stood, abruptly, and began throwing his clothes on, all crooked and wrinkled, looking anywhere but at Draco.
The little bubble of relief in Harry’s chest burst, spilling something fizzy and warm into his ribcage and through his limbs.
? Even Draco, who was probably the best-looking person Harry knew, mused that he had forgotten what it was like to be immersed in a culture fully organized around the relentless pursuit of aesthetic perfection. Yet somehow, even in a city of leggy blondes with carved-out cheekbones, Draco still managed to stand out. Harry thought it must be because everyone here was so deeply tanned that Draco, always finding a way to be contrary, was the brightest point in any room, his pale luminescence like a lighthouse in the sea. Everywhere they went, Harry’s eyes were drawn to him, to the ever-present pink sunburn on the bridge of his nose, to the wistful crinkle in his eyes when he recounted a fond memory, to the purposeful strides of his stark white legs, visible because, driven by the heat, he was actually wearing
“Hmph,” Ethel drained her wine. “I’ve lived a long time, boys. A little advice? Give it a whirl. I can tell you’d get on splendidly as more than best friends.” She winked, picked up her empty wine glass, and ambled off towards the bar.
, and Harry had laughed and told him he should talk politics with Hermione, and Draco had cocked his head and and said
“So needy,” he murmured, and Harry shivered and squeezed his eyes shut. “So obedient,” he continued, “keeping your hands back there like I asked and fucking yourself open on my cock.” Harry’s whole body spasmed, and Draco pushed a bit farther, “I had no idea you’d be so desperate, such a little slag for it,” Harry shuddered violently, and Draco brought a hand back up, sliding two fingers back into his mouth. Harry whined around them, sucking, and Draco couldn’t help thrusting up, just once. “That’s it,” he whispered, and Harry tightened around him, his spine curling in, “Just like that,” he continued, “You’re doing so well, Harry, you feel—
Ron and Hermione waved him off. Harry remained stricken for a few seconds, looking at the table, trying to stem the tide of panic rising in his throat. “I need a drink too,” he muttered numbly, and pushed himself up, legs wooden as he stumbled off.
right in the middle of this restaurant, just from eating that lemon bar?” He shook his head, laughed a little hysterically. “I’ve never—I can’t ever remember something like this happening to me before. I—
“Yeah,” Harry reached out, running a finger down Neville’s cheek. “Have you ever touched Neville’s face?” He swiped a thumb across Neville’s brow, turned back to José, who was looking at him as though he’d proposed a quick dip in the Channel.
The song everyone sings for Draco's birthday when they arrive at the club is, of course, 'In Da Club' by 50 Cent
—he was far too noble for that. He didn’t know how to meet men, and he feared the ones he did taking the story to Rita Skeeter.
, he could not wait to be shot of this job. He opened the second right drawer of his desk, just to check—his contract with the Tornadoes, proofed by his solicitor and ready to be signed on Tuesday. Sighing happily, he poured himself another finger, and allowed a slow smile to steal across his face. Two more days. Only two more days, and he could put in his notice with management and get the fuck out of there. He’d done his duty, balanced the books, brokered some truly outstanding trades, hired an assistant coach with real potential. He could go with a clean conscience. He hadn’t scarpered when things became… difficult, for him. He had stuck it out for two bloody years, and now he’d just watched his team win for the last time before they weren’t his team anymore, and he felt something loosen inside of his chest. He started grinning stupidly, he couldn’t stop.
At that pleasantly tipsy point in the night when everyone was well into their second cocktail but the main courses hadn’t arrived yet, Neville cornered Harry in the loo.
between them, and then Potter’s grin turned wicked and he ground his hips down and Draco stopped thinking at all.
Draco held out his arm, motioning Harry to his side. He came willingly enough, frowning as he grasped Draco’s hand and leaned in, “Are you about to embarrass me with a big speech again?”
“Ron, Draco just took a blasting curse to the ribs; I’m covered in his fucking blood; the last thing I’m thinking about is my supposed romantic feelings for him—”
Potter was standing in the doorway, and he was laughing. Bowled over with his hands on his knees, heaving in great, gasping breaths, his eyes bright and crinkling. Draco pulled out his wand.
It had been three months since Harry had seen Malfoy, which, by his calculations, meant they were overdue for a run-in. It’s not that Harry had
Draco’s chuckle cut him off, “Were you going to apologize for waking me up with your sex noises? Or should I apologize for humping you in my sleep?”
“I like you like this, all spread out,” Draco trailed a finger along Harry’s collarbone and down his sternum, over the ridges of his abdominals, through the trail of dark hair leading down from his navel. “Look at you,” he murmured, circling his thumb around the head of Harry’s cock, and dragging it through the slit, “You’re so wet for me.” Harry flushed and whimpered, his hips jerking forward, rutting into the wet patch on Draco’s shirt. Draco watched as another drop of precome welled up, “You’re leaking all over,” he continued, pressing his thumb in again, eliciting a stuttered whine from Harry, “This is quite a nice shirt and you’re absolutely ruining it.” Harry gasped and stiffened, rolling his hips back, panting, “I’m sorry, I couldn’t— I—”
Draco smiled softly. “Yeah, he’s—he’s nice. Smiles a lot, good table manners. Laughed at all my jokes.”
Harry arched up the bed, crying out, collapsing back onto the mattress as Draco kept riding him through the aftershocks, fisting his own cock and coming all over Harry’s stomach as he glared down at him, milking the last out of Harry until he was shaking his head and moaning, quiet and pained from overstimulation.
In mid-November, towards the end of Harry’s time training with Malfoy, Malfoy got them tickets to see Jimmy Eat World at Scala. It was the biggest show Harry had been to yet—Malfoy’s goodbye present to him, he said. They arrived early, waiting in line on the pavement before the doors opened to get a good spot in the pit, close to the stage. They were packed in shoulder to shoulder, passing the flask Malfoy had snuck in back and forth. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d been so grateful to be a wizard as when Malfoy waved a hand at him, discreetly casting a wandless bladder emptying charm. When the band came out, Harry threw back his head and howled.
Malfoy snorted. “You don’t. I swear you wore that exact…” His gaze trailed over Harry’s body with a sneer, “
“Eurgh,” Pansy chucked a glitter-spackled noisemaker at him. “You all sicken me. If I ever use the phrase
Harry groaned, withdrawing his fingers and conjuring lube into his hand, lining up, pushing in. Draco’s breath left him in a rush, Harry felt so good inside of him, and he told him so and Harry whined and his hips stuttered. He didn’t hold back this time, didn’t tease Draco anymore, just fucked him without restraint or inhibition. When he reached around for Draco’s cock, gasping out, “Are you close, Draco, come on, I want you to come, please,” Draco seized up, moaning, “
On a bright Monday morning in mid-September, Motion City Soundtrack released a new album and Harry and Draco stopped by HMV to pick up the CD on their way to work. Harry shouldered open the office door and sank into his rolling chair. Draco crossed the room and popped the CD into the hybrid magi-muggle speaker they had rigged up when they’d officially become partners and gotten their own office three years ago. The familiar voice rang out across the small room as Harry pulled some paperwork across his desk and inked his quill.

Oh fuck, he was definitely going to fuck something up. The room tilted around him as he stumbled toward the toilet.
Finally, we’ve made it to the chapter named after the prompt song! Chapter title taken from 'It Had to Be You' by Motion City Soundtrack
s, said Ron. Whatever it was, Harry was glad for the music—at least they had this one thing they could experience unreservedly, one bit of new, common ground.
“Well,” Harry sighed, “I suppose I can’t be too cut up about it if it means I get to have you. Bloody well timed, actually—” his eyes narrowed, “Wait—Was all this on purpose? Were
He glanced up to see Malfoy gaping at him. “Too late? Are you— are you mad? Potter, we’re twenty-one years old. You’re going to live a hundred more years and you think it’s
Walking away, he held the shirt up to his torso, a bounce in his step. Malfoy side-eyed him, laughing, “Well, Potter, are you going to thank me? First I introduce you to music, now I’m revolutionizing your wardrobe—what’s next, do you think I might be able to fix your hair?” Harry elbowed him, said he liked his hair how it was just fine, thank you very much.
“No, it’s…” Harry trailed off, biting his lip. This gift was big, and felt a bit intimate, and he wanted to give it on Draco’s birthday, just the two of them. He didn’t want to say all that, though. Instead, he fished around in his pocket, pulling out and unshrinking a large silver envelope. “Just open it.”
Healer Andrade pulled himself together smoothly. “Well, Mr. Malfoy, you’ve just regrown half of your ribcage and quite a few organs below, so we’ll be keeping you here for a few more days to ensure that everything heals properly. You’re on a variety of potions and I’ll be performing some regenerative spellwork once daily. We’ll send you home with a topical for scarring.”
Draco rolled his eyes. It was his last weekend paying for all of Harry’s drinks since the Quidditch Camp Gala. Only their friends in the audience even knew about
She raised her eyebrows shrewdly. “Harry. You have both good investigative instincts and the further advantage of having known me for ten years. Look at me and ask yourself, am I someone with knowledge or expertise on what to wear to a punk rock concert?”
fantastic that the muscles in his face were responding of their own volition, with terrifyingly unbridled enthusiasm, and he was afraid he looked completely deranged.

seem quite relaxed over there with Wood. How long has that been going on?” He was probably being humiliatingly transparent, he knew, but he was too drunk to care.
, don’t be daft,” Draco yawned, rolling over and stretching, long and languorous, “We’re young, virile men in our sexual prime—”
Harry sighed. As if it weren’t enough to have people treating him like a piece of meat, he always felt like he had to let them down gently or else he became the arsehole. “I’m not looking for a hookup tonight,” he smiled tightly.
“Watching you parade around the halls, swishing your little arse around my office, dangling yourself in front of me when I thought I couldn’t have you, teasing me like that every fucking day?”
Potter’s face fell a bit. “Well… It’s probably better if you knew the song first… Which I guess maybe you don’t?”
The morning after the Halloween party, Draco met Pansy for brunch at their favorite muggle patisserie, and, over piping coffee and freshly baked croissants, he fed her all the hot Ministry gossip he had heard the night before. He’d had a surprisingly good time, actually, and people were friendlier than he expected. That was probably due to Harry. Harry had been practically glued to him all night, beaming at everyone in financials as though he actually cared, and casually pulling Draco into conversations with the most important people in the Ministry, including the head of his own department, who’d always looked at Draco like someone would look at something scummy stuck to the bottom of their shoe. And then there was the way Harry had touched him, especially towards the end. Intentionally and intimately, like he had any business stroking his fingers over Draco’s back like that. Like he wanted something more. But Draco had learned not to indulge that particular fantasy. He resolved not to think about it. He brought his coffee to his lips, gazing into the middle distance and remembering how Harry’s fingers had tightened on his back before he’d said goodbye. When he put the cup down, Pansy was looking at him through narrow eyes.
Harry skipped the October pub quiz to break up with Oliver. He found himself at Ron and Hermione’s that Saturday, sprawled on the couch after eating far too much takeaway curry and drinking far too much red wine. It hadn’t been that difficult really, calling it off. Oliver was a good bloke and neither of them had gotten too attached—he took it well when Harry said he thought they would be better off as friends, clapping him heartily on the back and wishing him the best.
. With a muttered spell, Harry’s hand was slick and dripping, and when he curled his fingers around Draco’s length he had to grit his teeth and squeeze his eyes shut to keep from coming right then. He withdrew his fingers, cradling Harry’s hips, and their eyes met. Draco felt pinned to the chair with the force of his arousal. And then Harry shifted forwards, positioning himself over Draco’s cock and sinking down on a sharp, broken moan. And they were kissing again, Draco’s hands roaming over Harry’s back and tangling in his hair, Harry clutching his face and moaning into his mouth.
,” he growled and slammed into Draco, who cried out—his control breaking too, he took one of his hands off the wall, but Potter was quick, slipping his fingers underneath Draco’s so that Potter’s hand was on the inside. He wrapped around Draco and murmured, “show me.”
Pansy stayed with him all evening, through dinner and another bottle of wine, and a cathartic hour blaring Madonna in the sitting room and dancing on the furniture (after the war, Draco and Pansy had embarked on a personal quest to better understand muggle culture, which hadn’t been too successful, but had resulted in a mutual obsession with 80s muggle music). By the time she left, Draco was quite distracted and thoroughly exhausted. Pansy always knew exactly what he needed. She had found him, on New Year’s Eve, still in bed at four o’ clock in the afternoon and more than a little drunk. He’d been in a haze since Christmas, not leaving the house except to pick up takeaway and booze, eating on his sofa and drinking in bed. She’d taken one look at him and gotten right in the bed, hit him with a sobering charm and insisted he tell her everything. When he said
Draco cupped Potter’s face in his hands and gently tilted his chin up, brushing their lips together.
share that with Harry, thank Merlin), but everything else that comes with a relationship, all the little minutiae of existence.
As he crawled into bed, the words echoed in his head. He was acutely aware of Draco’s presence down the hall. Asleep in his bed at this very moment, in his pyjamas, with his sleep-mussed hair, starfished across the bed. Harry thought of Draco on weekend mornings, making a smoothie, collapsing next to Harry on the couch, flinging a beam of light around the sitting room floor for the cats to chase, bringing a fat joint up between his full lips, exhaling into Harry’s mouth. He thought of Draco in his robes at Ron and Hermione’s wedding, waiting for Harry with a drink in hand when the ceremony was over, bracketing Harry in his arms for a slow dance, his easy, indulgent smile, the delicate sweep of hair across his forehead. He thought of waking up next to Draco in the hotel room at Big Sur, replayed the slow roll of Draco’s groin against the side of his hip, the low groan Draco had made before he woke up.
“Yes, and I’m sure it’ll have three more envelopes inside,” Draco muttered as he tore it open. He paused, staring at the papers in his hand. “Harry… what is this?”
“I could ask you the same thing, although I might have warmed up to it first—never heard of foreplay, Potter?”
José took a hefty sip of wine. “It’s Friday,” he shrugged, “It’s my only day of this weekend. I hope I’m not intruding? Draco invited me…”
Draco drew him forward, eyes shining, “Yeah,” he whispered against Harry’s lips, “Yeah I think that’s it.”
Draco ran a hand through his hair, looking harassed. “Of course I didn’t, because it was bloody ridiculous—”
“Yes, lemon bars. There’s a rather swanky muggle establishment a few blocks over—I had a truly transcendent lemon bar there a couple of months ago; it’s been haunting my dreams...”
, made Draco say it again, and again, and then he finally sank in, buried himself in Draco’s body, laid his chest flat to Draco’s back, caught Draco’s hands and drew his arms in against his sides, covering Draco’s body with his own. He wanted to wrap every part of himself around Draco, envelop him so completely that Draco would be, somehow, inside of him too, small and curled up under his ribcage.
Malfoy nodded at him as he resumed his seat, and together they continued to drink in silence. At a few minutes til, Malfoy started in his seat, downing his glass, “Oh! I forgot to mention—you’d better cast a protective ear charm before we get up near the speakers. These muggles have no regard for their hearing, I swear, the first time I went to a show back in LA my ears were ringing for two days afterwards until I healed them myself.”
“I’ve got to go; I’m on call tonight and we’ve just been summoned back to the offices to help with booking paperwork—there’s been a major bust in a smuggling case.”
And the way the orientation manager had smiled at him when she read out the names—triumphantly, like she was daring him to protest. Apparently, Bill hadn’t been kidding about the first trainee rotation being a sort of hazing ritual. New breakers at Gringotts spent one year as trainees, rotating between units and supervisors: four three-month rotations. The first one was always with a breaker who had just graduated from their own trainee year. Supposedly, this was to ease the transition into the job, since recent grads took on the more basic assignments. Harry suspected that it was actually a covert method of forced gauntlet running, a cleverly disguised test, a torment: the blind leading the blind. He had been hurried through one single week of orientation and onboarding, and now he was marching toward to his first three-month rotation… with
Draco blinked and raised his palms, trying to get a grip on what was even going on, “Sorry, did I do something—”
Halfway through the meal, Harry said, “Wait a minute. I told you my story about, you know, realizing my feelings or whatever, but—” he took a large bite of pizza, stared at Draco as he chewed, “All you said was that you thought about us, but tried not to.” He washed down his pizza with a swig of beer, “More detail, please?”
Harry laughed, leaned over and plucked his now-empty glass from Pansy’s hand, turned his grin on Draco and said, “No, it’s your birthday, I’m buying
Harry turned the handle viciously and flung it open. He was met with a wall of sound, clearly muffled from the outside by heavy-duty silencing charms. He could barely think over it—a cacophony of banging drums, aggressive guitar, screeching vocals. It took him a moment to even register Malfoy’s presence, overwhelmed as he was by the sudden noise. But when he did… well.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry said, “for everything.” He was so close, and Draco could see him straining to keep his distance, his body swaying forward and jerking back infinitesimally.
Potter chuckled again and tweaked Draco’s nipple, drawing out a very undignified whine before Draco could stop himself.
“Hm?” Harry had eaten so much, he was having trouble thinking. Perhaps all the blood had left his brain and gone to his intestines in a futile attempt to aid his digestion. Was that possible? It felt possible right now.
Draco snorted, wondering whether he should clarify, but then Harry continued, his grin widening, “Anyways, I’ve got to tell the rest of the team, they’ll be chuffed I finally seduced you,” he winked, and Draco rolled his eyes.
The man smiled in a self-effacing way, circling around to Draco’s bedside and extending his hand, “Well, I can’t be the judge of how lucky you are, but yes, my name is Healer Andrade and I’ll be taking care of you, Mr. Malfoy.”
He was silent for a moment, and terror flared up Harry's spine. He was about to take it back, laugh it off, when Draco spoke.
Ron plunked a plate of cauliflower cheese in front of him, molten and bubbling inside, crisply browned on top. Harry sighed appreciatively as he dug in.
It was Harry’s turn to laugh—loud, incredulous. “Are you serious? I’ve been behaving like an absolute
Harry’s hand tightened around the top of Draco’s thigh. “I want—” he sucked in a breath, “I like to hear you ask for it,” he said hoarsely.
Draco laughed, wiping his filthy hand on Harry’s shirt and bringing it up to cup Harry’s face, “Indeed.”
“It means long walks on the beach…” Ron grinned, “And then going back to your hotel room together,” he waggled his eyebrows, “Ordering a little room service if you know what I mean?”
“That’s what sobering charms are for,” Harry snickered, “And anyways, it’s just paperwork… much more bearable after a few drinks,” he grinned.
And she hadn’t been wrong—Harry was dead comfortable in his own skin these days, but Merlin, did everyone in this city have to be so
He never treated any of his scars. Never used any of the spells or salves made for erasing. He said scars looked badass, and he had a lot of them. Keloid ridges and shiny burn splotches, puckered folds and delicate silvery lines. And in between all the scar tissue, tattoos. Black runes littered his torso, spiky hawthorn branches traced beneath his collarbones, crossing under his clavicle. Ink curled around his thighs, crept up his spine, settled between his shoulder blades. There were hardly a few unbroken inches of smooth, pale skin anywhere on his body; but the sleeve on his left arm was Harry’s favorite. The mark was still there, faded and dull amid the flames devouring it and climbing all the way up to his shoulder. The colors were vibrant, intense, shades and shadows shaping the flames into slavering, majestic creatures, and at the apex, a phoenix rising from the fire. It was heavy handed, Draco always said, rolling his eyes at his younger self, his first tattoo. But it was an exquisite piece and Draco always showed it off. He showed off all his ink, and all his scars, and he was sure to be happy with this new scar, too. Harry smiled to himself as Healer Andrade filled Draco in on the details of his care plan.
He reached office 340B and rapped sharply. A few moments passed in silence. Harry’s jaw tightened. Surely someone had informed Malfoy that he was coming. He was probably in there right now, ignoring the knock at the door...
Draco had transfigured some old shirts to look like the Black Parade uniforms. He was creative like that, with the outfits. Last fall, they’d gone to see AFI at Carling Academy Brixton and Draco had leaned fully into the
Draco could have kicked himself. Since he’d started working at the Ministry two years ago and begun crossing paths with Potter and the rest of his former classmates (even, he was proud to say, approaching friendliness with some of them), the schoolboy crush he’d had at Hogwarts had come roaring back full force, approaching truly embarrassing levels. Pansy teased him mercilessly about it at every opportunity. He couldn’t seem to maintain his cool around Potter, always blushing, or overcompensating with too much snark, or doing stupid shite like drunkenly calling Potter over to his corner of the bar on Christmas Eve when he clearly didn’t want to talk to anyone.
“We’re going to a muggle film. Something about the pursuit of happiness? Except happiness is misspelled? That’s important, I think. José said it’s been well-reviewed.”
It had started about a year into Draco’s tenure with Puddlemere. Just a bit of subtle flirting, at first. Draco hadn’t known how to react, couldn’t allow himself to believe it could be true. He worried that he had tipped his hand, stared too long at Potter’s bare torso that one time in the locker room. He resolved to maintain professional boundaries. But then, predictably, Potter just kept
Neville shrugged. “Greg asked him what he thought about it. Said it was the best gift anyone had ever given him. And then he told Greg not to tell anyone he said that, on pain of death. So don’t tell him I told you.”
, so Draco pulled out, eliciting a gasp and a shiver from Harry, who stayed draped over the desk, naked and insensible, while Draco put his own clothes to rights and cast gentle cleaning spells over them both. He retrieved Harry’s kit from the floor and knelt beside him, coaxing first one leg in and then the other, maneuvering him back into his clothes and lacing him up, and then sitting back into his chair and drawing Harry down, sideways into his lap. Harry nuzzled into his neck, humming, and the gesture was so affectionate, so open, that it pulled the question right out of him, the one he was afraid to ask.
Anyways, he was healthy now, and he kept in good shape, and skinny boys seemed to be rather in on the music scene, so he didn’t have much time for being self-conscious nowadays either. Tonight, his jeans were tight and black and crowned with a blood red spike belt, and topped off with the Black Parade jacket, and Harry felt self-assured, armored. While Draco was the high fashion mastermind, Harry had come to enjoy having a bit of an aesthetic himself over the past few years. There was some power in all of it—clothes, makeup, tattoos, nail polish, piercings, the way he cut his hair. It all allowed him to say something to the world around him without actually saying anything, which was a relief, because most of the time the thing Harry wanted to say to the world around him was
“Honestly, though, if I look anywhere near as awful as you, could you spruce me up a bit—a mouth-freshening charm wouldn’t hurt either…”
. He frowned. It wasn’t enough for all of his friends to turn against him, his music had to do it too? He spat into the sink.
Harry chuckled, wondering aloud— “Are you going to have one? You’re closing up now anyways—are you going to keep me under observation?”
Luckily, though, when they went out for Draco’s birthday, Harry was never alone. Only the Slytherins ever fit in at places like this, and Harry could always rely on Seamus and Ginny in particular to poke fun at the stuffy waiter or the pretentious décor. At least the menu was in English at this one, and Harry picked up the first round of drinks for everyone.
His blood ran hot then cold, and he shivered hard. He wasn’t sick. No, he was out of his goddamn mind, that’s what he was. What had he been thinking, agreeing to officiate Ron and Hermione’s wedding? The most important day of their lives—
“I’m knackered, though,” Draco sighed, pushing his chair back laboriously and straightening with a grunt, threading their fingers together. “You’re going to have to do all the work in bed.”
Draco and José left early to catch a muggle film at the cinema, something about Ancient Greece maybe, Harry didn’t quite catch it. Draco had said it would be spectacular to watch while stoned. Harry didn’t understand why that would be the case for a movie about Ancient Greece, but José said it had gotten a lot of buzz—he watched all the talked-about muggle films. Last month he had taken Draco to see a musical about American R&B stars and Draco had come home raving about it, saying,
Malfoy lit up with anticipation. “Alright, I’ve just got to change—are you dressed muggle under your robes? You can leave them up in my flat.”
“Did you say that though, Ron?” Harry piped up, “Did you specifically mention in private? Because if that wasn’t in the terms of the wish Draco and I can strip down right now—”
“Don’t apologize,” Draco brushed his thumb across Harry’s cheekbone, leaving a shiny smear, “I like it.” Harry shivered. “If I’d known you would be like this… God, I wouldn’t have waited so long.”
On Monday he saw the photos in the Prophet: Potter and Wood, walking out of the pub hand-in-hand, surrounded by friends. Potter was laughing at something, knocking their shoulders together. The photos were accompanied by a block of text speculating wildly about his prior dating history with men (
in Malfoy—he wasn’t, not at all. They’d had sex (really incredible sex), so it was only natural that Harry would notice the shift in Malfoy’s throat as he swallowed his drink, or the soft shine of his hair in the low light. He couldn’t help but remember the press of Malfoy’s body against his whenever their knees jostled together under the table. But that didn’t have to mean anything. They had chemistry; Harry was willing to admit that by now. At first, he’d simply thought it would always be that good with a man, that he’d been so overwhelmed by the encounter simply because he was finally experiencing what he was supposed to feel during sex. But after more than a few nights at the muggle clubs Malfoy had recommended, Harry had realized that sex with men could be mediocre too, and Malfoy had indeed been that good. Still though, he was only just figuring out how to be friends with Malfoy. So when Malfoy turned to grin at him after sweeping the Post-League Careers of Famous Quidditch Players category, and Harry felt a soft shiver of pleasure run down his spine, he was pretty confident that was only the warm fuzzy feeling you get when you’re making a new friend.
“I’m not—for Merlin’s sake, I think it’s great, I hope he has a great time, ok? I hope they fall madly in love and get married and have a bunch of tall, beautiful babies, alright?” He stabbed at his salad.
Draco nodded feverishly. Harry dropped to his knees, nuzzling into Draco’s groin, and then he was looking up, eyes wide, saying, “Yes?” And Draco swallowed thickly, trying to get the word out, “
So finally, Harry asked Hermione about it, and she raised her eyebrows and said, “Well, it’s Malfoy.” And when Harry pointed out that he was one of the best players there and everyone seemed to enjoy his company, she frowned and said, “Well yes, he is an asset, and I suppose we all think he’s alright now, but you know, it’s
“Yeah,” Harry let out a short, hollow laugh. “I only just figured it out.” He took another long swallow. “I wanted to ask him for a pint around the holidays.” He was horrified to hear his voice cracking slightly. There was a moment of silence in which Harry replayed the moment Draco’s eyes had flashed with hurt before shuttering blank and closed. “Oh god,” he moaned, dropping his face into his hands, “I’m a fucking coward and I’ve ruined my chances and I deserve it, too.”
Harry could have stayed there for ages, on his knees in the little flat above Draco’s shop. But when Draco croaked out, “Bed,” Harry obeyed. Standing, he followed Draco, tripping, delirious, as they stumbled under the hangings, Draco sprawling across the bedspread and tugging Harry down after him. Draco’s skin was flushed and fevered beneath him and when Harry touched him his fingers buzzed and his spine tingled.
“Are you sure?” Draco frowned, “You’re not—” he tilted his hips and Harry hissed out a breath, “Too sensitive? Sore?”
—that was too far. Potter had never dared proposition him so explicitly, so lewdly, and before Draco could think, he was out of his chair and had him against the wall, pinning him with a forearm to the chest. “I’m done,” he gritted out, “with this little game you’re playing—”
Draco flushed further, and surely it was criminal to blush that prettily and frequently, and in that outfit no less—Harry was an Auror, maybe he could bring Draco in for disturbing the peace…? he did have those muggle handcuffs…
“Credit to Greg, too,” Ron shifted onto one hand, taking the joint from his mouth and passing it to Harry, coughing a little. “This thing’s a monster.”
. He tore off his shirt, kicked away his trousers, tongue thick in his mouth. He slid his hands underneath Draco’s jumper, up over the taut muscles of his abdomen, as he lifted it over his head. Harry immediately threaded his hands back into Draco’s hair, kissing him again, trailing his fingers down, working his trousers open and pushing them off, ardent, feverish. Naked, Draco stood before him, flushed and pale, glowing in the low lamplight of the flat.
Draco pushed out of the booth next to him, draining his drink, “I think I need to be more intoxicated for this.”
Harry looked around, feeling his chest get tight. Fuck, he loved these people. Distantly, he heard himself sniffling a little and wiped his nose on his jumper sleeve.
Draco looked so pleased, thanking Susan for the invitation and expressing his excitement, Harry could hardly stand it. He managed to extricate himself without doing anything colossally stupid, like launching himself at Draco and licking all the glitter off his chest (he just squeezed his arm like a normal person instead). Then he and Ron made their way out of the party, nicking some hors d’oeuvres for the road. He spent the next few hours filling out paperwork on the smuggling case, and trying not to think about Draco’s jumpsuit, and his hair, and his makeup, and the way his lips had parted when he leaned into Harry’s touch.
“That’s enough,” Draco cut in smoothly. “You’re not going to sick up. Brush your teeth and meet me in the kitchen.”
Harry choked on his hit, shoulders shaking with a hysterical fit of laughter and coughing. He handed it off to Draco, who took a measured puff before responding, “No, Greg, we have not. Regarding the actual intention behind your wish, though, the answer is that yes, I did in fact rim Harry until he begged for mercy just yesterday afternoon—”
“Oh.” The insides of Harry’s chest were doing something funny. Neville’s towering figure blurred in front of him. He blinked. Neville was smiling at him.
Greg took a pensive puff and then proclaimed, “He doesn’t smoke. Perfect skin. Goes to all the best muggle movies. Takes Draco to fancy restaurants...” He shook his head, “He likes nice things.” Harry and Neville nodded in agreement. Greg shrugged. “Draco’s not a nice thing.”
Harry moved hesitantly, coming to stand in between Draco’s legs, shifting restlessly. Gods, Draco wanted to make him kneel, but he didn’t think he had the patience just then. He beckoned, and Harry climbed cautiously into his lap, straddling him, gingerly resting his hips against Draco’s, letting out a soft whimper. He ran his hands across Draco’s chest, down the line of buttons on his crisp white shirt, rocking his hips just a little bit—
Draco laughed, shrugging, “Well, no one’s going to remember that.” He darted a sly grin at Harry and plucked a couple of stuffed dates of the nearest tray, offering one and biting the other in half.
of when he saw Malfoy, before, it’s just that, when he thought back over the years preceding what he had taken to calling The Christmas Incident, he noted that he usually ran into Malfoy in passing about once every month or two. Harry might see him in the ministry cafeteria at lunch, or by the lifts at the end of the day, or coming out of Kingsley’s office with his financial reports when Harry was stopping by for a spot of tea on his break. It wasn’t at all odd, he firmly told the Hermione-shaped voice in his head, that he remembered where, or when, or how frequently he was used to running into Malfoy. He simply had a finely tuned Malfoy-awareness, like a sixth sense, honed by years of careful attention at Hogwarts. Conveniently, now that he was once again curious about Malfoy’s whereabouts, he found that his awareness hadn’t turned off, or gone dormant, as he might have supposed. Instead, it turned out that his brain had been carefully cataloguing all of his interactions with Malfoy over the past two years and quietly filing them away, and now he was excruciatingly aware that he had gone much longer without seeing Malfoy than could possibly be considered normal.
He brought the joint back up and sucked in hard, leaning back toward Draco, who was waiting with his mouth open in a soft
“No, I was just checking to make sure you were still paying attention, you looked a little zoned out there,” he grinned. “Although…” he tilted his head to the side in mock consideration, waggling his eyebrows.
hadn’t discussed exactly what was going on between them, but in recent weeks, while sometimes the sex was still hot and frantic and careless, other times it was…different. Draco found himself waking up in the mornings spooned around Harry, and he would hold him there and fuck into him, lazy and slow, Harry weak with sleep, fingers twitching feebly and curling into the sheets as Draco breathed over the sweet spot below his ear.
He thought about that a lot, particularly in the shower. But he also thought about talking to Malfoy at the bar, how he had really listened to Harry, offered thoughtful advice, made him laugh. Harry had had a good time that night, even though he’d ended up in a bit over his head with the whole sex thing, and once he had calmed down somewhat, he had actually been looking forward to seeing Malfoy again. Maybe they could be friends? Harry didn’t have that many gay friends—Charlie was never around, and Luna was… Luna. Malfoy had seemed willing to show him the ropes a little, and Harry appreciated it—more than he expected. But the more time went by without him running into Malfoy at work, the more he started to suspect that he might have been… less than perfectly polite, when he had left. Harry really had no idea what the proper morning-after etiquette was. He’d only ever slept with Ginny, and he certainly didn’t know what to expect when it came to blokes, much less Malfoy. Surely Malfoy hadn’t expected him to stay—it was Christmas morning, and they were ex-enemies who’d somehow ended up getting pissed and shagging—what were they going to do, make cocoa and open presents in front of the fire together? Definitely not that. But when he cared to look closely at his memory of leaving, which was not often, he had a prickly sense that no matter how casual or unexpected the liaison, it was probably not the best manners to practically sprint out of there the way he had. If he was ever brave enough to tell Hermione what happened, which he wasn’t, he thought she might give him that sad frown and say, “I’m disappointed in you, Harry.” And Harry couldn’t bear the thought of
Harry whimpered high in his throat, bucking against Draco’s touch at his rim, and Draco couldn’t hold back anymore. He pulled Harry in, kissing him, pressing their bodies together, fumbling to conjure some lube and slide again against the entrance to Harry’s body, ever so gently, feeling his body tighten with desire as Harry writhed in his lap.
“Well, I’d tell this friend of yours that I pretty much always knew—although it was confirmed beyond doubt when I attempted to snog Pansy at the Yule Ball in fourth year—” that earned him a chuckle, “but sometimes it takes people a bit longer to figure it out, and that’s perfectly alright too. You just have to trust yourself. And a little exploration goes a long way,” he added with a smirk.
He stepped through the fireplace and crossed into the kitchen, finding Ron pulling a bubbling baked ziti out of the oven. Hermione emerged from her study a few minutes later and Harry cracked open the wine, the two of them setting the table while Ron dressed the salad. Once they were seated, Harry didn’t have long to wait for the Inquisition.
He mouthed his way up Draco's body, snuggled into the familiar contours of his chest, and drew the duvet up over them both.
Draco awoke slowly, with his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth and his head pounding. Merlin, he felt like utter shite. It took a few labored breaths to register the presence of another body spooned up against his chest. A body that was firm, and warm, and attached to a head of messy black hair—it all came rushing back to him. He’d called Potter over at the bar last night, and they’d talked, and it had been easy and fun, and they’d come back to Draco’s and shagged and
Harry thought about Malfoy frowning sympathetically as Harry shared his anxieties, listing off which establishments he ought to try first.
Draco wrote it down for him and followed Harry to the door, crowding him up against it, running a knuckle along his jaw and tipping his chin up for a kiss. “Don’t be late, or I’ll be
“I… During the war, when I started having doubts… It wouldn’t have been enough for me to think disloyal thoughts and hide them. If he’d ever bothered to look…” Draco shuddered. “I couldn’t take the risk. I couldn’t even allow the thought, do you understand? I became very good at it, stopping thoughts before they started, or cutting them off in their tracks and then burying them before they could fully form. If I allowed myself to think those things…” He shook his head, “It was too dangerous.”
The day before they were set to leave for Los Angeles, Harry met Ron for lunch at the Leaky. They had already gotten caught up on Ron and Hermione’s honeymoon when they’d arrived back in England the week prior, so the discussion focused on Harry’s upcoming trip.
“I’m taking a position with the Tornadoes. It’s not official yet so mum’s the word, please. I’m signing the contract on Tuesday and then I’ll put in my leave here.”
Harry shrugged, “Could be fun. Reckon I’m drunk enough. I’m a shite singer though so you’ll have to carry us.”
“Noo,” Harry laughed, swaying a little and standing up from his seat at the bar, “Just—" He turned his face into Draco’s chest, “Take me home?” he mumbled.
Harry wrote Malfoy letter after letter, apologizing profusely, begging for forgiveness, recounting everything he’d felt that night and since. At least one letter every day for two weeks. His small brown owl, Glenlivet, had started waiting by Harry’s desk in the evening after work, with a sorry look on his face.
, Draco smirked, and they ate it out lounging on the deck. Afterwards, they took a bottle of wine into the hot tub as the sky blushed coral and crimson and the sun dipped below the waves. In the morning, Draco woke Harry up by blasting their vacation playlist from the hotel speakers, shouting
“Yes,” Draco moaned through his hands. “I’ve been offered a formal invitation into the friend zone.”
“I’m fine!” he repeated, sounding rather like he was on the verge of a panic attack. “I just need to go home—” dressed, he finally turned to Draco, eyes and fingers twitching like a trapped animal. “This was—” he shook his head frantically, “I don’t know. Just please—please don’t let this get in the papers?”
Draco flushed, wiping his fingers on his napkin and pursing his lips, “Well… You know I’m an accomplished Occlumens. And occlumency is about guarding your thoughts from others, yes, but it can also be about guarding them from yourself.”
After that auspicious beginning, Harry reported to his spindly desk in the corner of Malfoy’s office every day, and they attempted to be civil to one another. And every day, Malfoy blared his music. He flatly refused to wear headphones, something about wanting to preserve his hearing into his old age. On the third day, Harry tried asking him to turn the volume down. Malfoy slowly dragged his gaze up from the report he was filling out and fixed Harry with a withering glare.
looking up at the server. Harry had no idea how much time passed before the food arrived, but he spent every stretched-out, liquid moment of that time fighting the stirring arousal in his trousers, fighting the urge to reach across the table and lay his hands on Malfoy’s delicate wrists. His heart was quick in his throat when the lemon bars were finally placed on the table in front of them, fingers shaking as he reached for his dessert spoon.
Potter’s eyes widened and he snaked a hand into Draco’s hair, kissing him fiercely for a moment before pulling back to reply, “Oh
, but every time Potter stuck his head through Draco’s office door, or tapped his shoulder in the cafeteria line, he felt keenly the certain futility of his attempts. He remembered what Potter’s hair felt like in his hands, or the taste of his mouth, and he couldn’t pretend.
They didn’t get much work done, listening to the album and talking about the band’s show in a few weeks. At home, Harry played it again as he was brushing his teeth, and the song Draco had poked fun at him about stuck in his brain. He did hate being alone—both of them did. And as the singer went on describing an increasingly ridiculous and idiosyncratic friendship, Harry thought about Draco, and their friendship. He thought about them lying on the floor together in the living room, getting into character as Cassie and Circe, putting on high-pitched voices and comparing the number of mice they’d caught in the cellar. He thought of the night Draco moved in, the two of them jumping on the bed and screaming at the top of their lungs,
Luna had done a complicated weather ritual in their back garden the week before, a series of incantations she had found in the journal of a seventh century Viking priestess, meant to summon an epic storm. So naturally it was, for once, clear all weekend.
Harry took a puff, closing his eyes as the interstitial spaces of his body released, shoulders melting down his back.
would have been. Harry took a moment to wonder whether the music he was about to hear inside would have put Fluffy to sleep. He grinned to himself.  A few clusters of uni students were hanging around outside, smoking cigarettes and scuffing their shoes on the pavement. And there was Malfoy, leaning up against one of the columns on the far side of the door, arms crossed, scowling. He caught Harry’s eye and blinked as if surprised, just for a moment, before his face settled into blankness. He nodded toward the window and together, they got their tickets checked and walked through the door.
“Ah, yes, Draco,” he was mortified to hear his voice cracking, “I’ve just remembered something—got to go, see you at the Halloween party?”
'Dead!' by My Chemical Romance is the song Draco wakes Harry up playing on the morning of the concert
“Pansy going soft, can you imagine?” Ginny leaned forward, eyes glittering, “Like, for instance, if she were now making sweet, sweet love to Anthony Goldstein at home, in a
ice prince mood, dressing all in gunmetal grey and gauzy silver, silver-glittering eyelids and cheekbones to match. Even his hair, swept severely to the side, had a slight iridescent shimmer. Harry had noticed the eyes on him all night, from the moment they stepped off Sirius’ motorbike outside the venue. He had swelled a little, walking beside Draco, slinging a friendly arm around his slim waist. It always put a bit of swagger in his step, chumming it up with the best-looking bloke in the room—even if they were only friends, even if he was maybe a little biased about just how good-looking Draco was.
“My god, this is horrifying,” Draco shuddered, stage-whispering to Harry, “Should we have a quick shag now just to nip this in the bud? I’ll let you top?”
In a small town called Carmel-by-the-Sea they walked the hilly streets, stepping in and out of posh clothing shops and art galleries. They went into a shop that only sold extravagant, handmade hats—Draco tried on top hats and bowlers, newsboy caps and even a fedora, while Harry laughed and snapped his photo on the small camera they’d brought and charmed to look muggle. Afterwards they stopped into a squat, thatched-roof shop called the Cottage of Sweets and gorged themselves on fresh fudge, filling bags with licorice and gummies and chocolate truffles. They ordered tea from a small café and took it outside, blowing the steam up in the cool air. And of course, they flagged down a muggle passerby to take their photo next to the Ocean Avenue street sign, waving and grinning, shopping bags in their hands, arms slung round each other’s shoulders.
It wasn’t unbearable yet, the jealously, only a slow, creeping vine, winding around his insides and cutting off his sunlight, choking off his air ever so slowly. It whispered to him, when he saw them together,
When Harry’s movements above him grew increasingly frantic, Draco grabbed his wrists, bringing his hands around his back again. Harry arched his back, gasping and flushing.
“Oh God,” Draco groaned, dropping his head back with a thunk against the wall, Adam’s apple bobbing in his pale throat as he swallowed. “Not this again.”
Draco nodded at Ron in the corner and the music blared from the ancient muggle speakers Arthur had been working on for weeks, straight to the chorus,
Harry strode furiously down the Gringotts hallway, soles of his shoes clacking loudly on the shiny black tiles. They had actually assigned him to
He found her in the library, of course, with three wizarding law casebooks spread out on the desk in front of her, muttering to herself as she scribbled notes, a smear of ink across her left cheek. She jumped in her chair as Harry skidded through the door.
Draco had a slight panic. Was he that obviously smitten? Was Potter about to kindly remind him that he was very straight and very taken? “Yes…” he replied slowly, “do you have a problem with it?”
“What sort of music do you like, anyways? Not that I’ll be persuaded to play it, but…” Malfoy shrugged.
with the zeros as eyeholes. Luna had brought some of her own handmade accessories, spangled headdresses and kaleidoscope monocles and necklaces made of waxy creeper vines. There’d been a sloppy game of quidditch earlier in the evening, followed by an enthusiastic devouring of the wide selection of pasties Ron had baked. They’d set off a heap of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes fireworks, great starbursts, flocks of birds and Chinese dragons, sparklers that spelled suggestive and festive New Year’s wishes. Harry had kissed Draco at midnight, as was their tradition when they both didn’t have a date, which was the case more often than not.
Harry loved checking in with them about it, and he loved helping whenever he could, too. He had, predictably, gone way overboard researching wedding bands, compiling a huge list and dragging Ron to live shows all over the greater London area. The two of them had gone to Neville’s greenhouses, passing a joint back and forth and wandering along the paths, staring at the flowers with wide eyes and pointing out ones they liked to Neville, who was taking care of the arrangements. Ron had stopped in front of a cluster of luminous gold blooms, twinkling gently like soft starlight. He had grabbed Harry’s arm and, swaying slightly, said,
“Yeah, I knew you probably had Firewhisky for dinner at least three nights this week,” Harry’s eyes crinkled around the corners as Draco grimaced in acknowledgement, “Figured I’d make myself useful over here so you could get some nutrients in you before passing out.”
with Draco, casual as anything, as if the thought didn’t open a deep well of fear inside of him. Harry’s stomach clenched. Whenever he had considered the possibility of anything more than a bit of friendly snogging with Draco—and of course he had considered it, he’s not blind—the thought was immediately cut off by a rush of gut-twisting mortification. Everything between them was already deep, and heavy, and vibrating with meaning. Sex only had the potential to introduce catastrophic awkwardness into their relationship. How could he know how to be, how to put his hands on Draco’s naked skin? What if he wasn’t good? How could he make himself vulnerable that way, when Draco was so important? The thought wouldn’t even stick in his brain. It made him want to squirm out of his skin. So no, he couldn’t think about Draco like that. But he could hardly explain all of that to Ron either.
“Ready for more?” Harry murmured, and Draco nodded sleepily and allowed Harry to turn him over onto his stomach. He placed a kiss to the nape of Draco’s neck, then began working his way down his spine, trailing his lips over Draco’s skin, breath ghosting over his ribs. He drew his thumbs down and spread Draco open, pressing his mouth to Draco’s hole, flicking his tongue out. Draco’s fingers twitched feebly. Harry didn’t stop when Draco was hard again. He kept going until Draco was leaking, feverishly rutting into the sheets and pressing back into Harry’s face, and then he slipped a finger in, brushing against Draco’s prostate, and sucked, and Draco threw his head back, keening, asking for more.
“All the rooms only had the one bed, so do try not to suffocate me in the night, I know what a frightful cuddler you are,” Draco said.
Harry smiled sheepishly, “I told Molly I’d be waiting on you all day so I was afraid to come over in case I missed you.”
Harry’s head snapped up. He considered the shirt again—deep blood red with black and silver lettering. Could he wear that? He suppressed a small shiver of excitement and fished out a few extra notes.
“Yeah, that’s us,” Harry kicked him under the table. “Or maybe… just hear me out on this one… maybe we’re just a couple of kids who didn’t have a lot of love, so it took us a bit of extra time to figure it out.”
“Yes, yes,” she replied absently, already settling back in place behind her books, inking her quill, “Collect me around half past seven?”
Draco considered whether he should return the compliment—he did his fair share of ogling Harry, after all—but Harry seemed like he was on a roll and when Draco opened his mouth the only thing that came out was a rough, high-pitched whine.
“Fuck,” Draco muttered, slicking himself. As he pushed in, Harry’s eyes fluttered and he made a soft
Harry had that with Draco. It had crept up on them, over the years, with each shift in their relationship—becoming friends when Harry was still a trainee at Gringotts, then requesting each other as full-time partners, then moving Draco into Grimmauld. Now, Draco was there when Harry woke up, brewing tea for the both of them in the mornings and murmuring to the cats as he set their food out. He charmed the wrinkles out of Harry’s shirts when they needed to look properly starched for something at work; he brewed all the basic potions in their medicine cabinet out of his makeshift laboratory in the basement. They ate breakfast together and went to work together and came home together and went out together. Their days were filled with each other, and Harry sometimes wondered that neither of them ever seemed to tire of it. Their friends made fun of them, saying they were even worse than an old married couple, because even old married couples needed some space, sometimes. Most people they knew said things like that about relationships, things like
Dean sidled up next to him. “You’re looking a bit out of sorts,” he said, tilting his head questioningly.
“Sixty-nine!” Seamus roared, sitting up out of nowhere; Harry had sworn he’d been snoring on the rug a moment ago. He pointed at Harry and Draco, fixing them with the wild, focused eyes of a prophet, and repeated solemnly, “Sixty-nine.” He nodded once and collapsed into Dean’s lap.
Harry jabbed his fingers into Draco’s chest. “Unbelievable.” He shook his head, “You are un-fucking-believable! I can’t even—” his eyes narrowed. “Wait a minute. Self-protective?” He raised an expectant eyebrow. Draco opened his mouth to say
Hermione took a deep breath, “Come on Harry,” she said bracingly, “It’s bad but it’s not… completely unsalvageable?” Harry snorted humorlessly.
“My first—” Harry felt himself flushing and clenched his fists, digging his nails in. “the time I wouldn’t tell you about.” He dragged his gaze up from the table in time to see horrified comprehension dawning across Ron’s face.
Ron and Hermine were getting married at the end of May. They were keeping it about as low key as possible for a wedding with close to two hundred guests (it turned out they had rather a lot of loved ones, and there was simply no way around the size of the extended Weasley clan). Early in their engagement, Hermione had unleashed a few impassioned rants against the wedding-industrial complex, and Ron had pretty much taken over the planning from there, with Hermione wielding final approval or veto power.
“And Hamza and Winston are ancient history, mate,” said Ron, “Who are you going to bring up next, Ginny?”
They stayed like that well into the afternoon, swaddled in blankets and snuggling the cats. At some point, Harry got up to clean the kitchen, returning to collapse back on the sofa, fitting himself under the crook of Draco’s arm, resting his head against Draco’s chest. The wireless was tuned in to the New Year’s Day exhibition match between Ireland and Wales. The fire was bright in the grate, the afternoon light dim in the garden. Harry lit another joint.
“Yeah, I want you to show me around, I want to see all the places you used to go, and I mean, I know we’ve seen all the bands before, but I thought it would be cool, you know, to go to Warped Tour, see it where you first discovered all this stuff. And oh, if you look, the departure portkey from San Francisco, it’s two weeks later; I thought we could bring the bike and drive up the coast, I heard that’s really nice, and I mean, we can change the dates if you don’t want— I just—"
The memory hit him forcefully then, standing in the kitchen looking at Draco swaying in the doorway, half-lidded and happy to be home. Harry crossed the room and drew him into a hug, resting his head against Draco’s chest. He hadn’t thought Draco would die or anything, but still, it wasn’t a pleasant thing to watch your best friend get a hole blown through the side of their torso. “I’m glad you’re home,” he murmured.
“No!” Harry reached out a hand toward Draco’s knee, and he flinched away. “No, Draco please—I’m sorry ok?” He ran a hand through his hair again, “You’ve got to know it wasn’t a disaster, I mean, honestly it was the best fuck of my life, I can't—” he choked out, “I can’t stop thinking about it, I can’t stop thinking about you—"
I was like, excuse me? I’ve been seeing a mind healer weekly since 1998, you fucking imbecile, I just haven’t told
They didn’t ask after each other’s weekends or offer to grab an extra coffee when one of them went to the canteen. Harry wasn’t yet sure what to make of this new Malfoy and his pro-muggle, anti-establishment tastes.
—” his hips chased Draco’s fingers, grinding down. Draco dipped lazily back in, barely brushing against Harry’s prostate and withdrawing again, circling his rim, and Harry bowed back taut, arms flexing behind him. He looked so beautiful, flushed and panting, holding himself like an offering in Draco’s lap.
?” She rolled her own. “You know Potter can’t hide an emotion to save his own life. The man’s an open book, and he meant what he said. I could tell.” She paused and laughed shortly. “And he’s willing to go on record in front of
Harry grinned, “Well, as our dear friends have so kindly and recently reminded me, it’s been a while since I’ve had a good cuddle… so enjoy your last breaths on this earth, it’ll all be over for you soon...”
“It’s not so bad though, is it? The old spinster life?” He elbowed Draco conspiratorially, passing him the bowl.
Harry whimpered, and Draco made a low, approving noise, and that was it, he was coming in his pants rutting against Draco's thigh like an overeager, fumbling teenager. Desperate and laid bare, even more than he had feared. As he panted into the damp spot on Draco’s shirt—Merlin, had he drooled on Draco’s shirt?—he found he didn’t mind, wasn’t embarrassed at all, actually. Draco was still talking, muttering softly as he worked the buttons open on his trousers, reaching under Harry’s waistband and getting his hand slick—Harry’s eyes snapped open. Fuck, Draco was touching himself, and his voice was still in Harry’s ear, saying, “God, Harry, that was so hot…” And then he was spilling over his hand, over the front of Harry’s joggers, and every last trace of fear was driven from Harry’s mind. He sucked in a deep breath, trying to clear his head.
Draco swept Harry to his chest in the bedroom doorway, kissing him once, twice, burying his nose in Harry’s hair.
“That’s alright,” Harry fidgeted, eyes darting to the side. “We don’t have to, if you’re too tired—”
was finally going to be the one that Potter proposed to Ginny Weasley, they had in fact broken up the week before. It had been amicable—she’d felt something off too, for quite some time—but it was still a breakup, and would take some getting used to, and Potter had excused himself early from the Weasley Christmas Eve dinner.
“Ok, ok,” Harry waved his hands, flushing, “I’ll allow you a moment to gloat, but I really need your advice!”
“Yeah, course,” Harry laughed, warm inside. Draco was cute like this, all fidgety and excited. Harry knew that Draco had taken José out with Pansy a few times, but other than her and Harry, he hadn’t met anyone else yet. Draco wanted to ease him into the friend group, something about them being rather a lot to handle. Personally, Harry advocated for trial by fire—if any potential partner couldn’t handle their friends, it probably wasn’t going to work out anyways. But Draco had flatly refused that approach, shaking his head, saying,
Pansy rolled her eyes and swatted him on the shoulder. “Haven’t you heard, Draco, the friend zone was invented by sad chauvinists to avoid taking responsibility for their horrible personalities.” She sniffed, “I certainly won’t allow you to endorse the idea, much less relegate yourself to it. Anyways dear, what did you say?!”
It wasn’t for lack of trying. Harry had lingered by the lifts around the time he knew the financial department cleared out for the day. He’d timed his own trips to the cafeteria when he figured Malfoy was most likely to be eating lunch. He had even gone to the last three installments of the monthly pub quiz night at that trendy bar that had opened in Diagon last year. A load of the younger Ministry employees attended the pub quiz religiously, and Harry knew Malfoy was one of them because even though he himself wasn’t a regular, Hermione was. She’d been quite pleased when Harry showed up, but he hadn’t been a very helpful teammate. He mostly just brooded over his drink, watching the door in case Malfoy walked in (he didn’t).
“Oh my god, yes you are,” Harry brought his hand back up to Draco’s face, cradling his cheek, “I could look at you all the time…” he laughed, “I already
It didn’t take long. Draco’s knees gave out as he finished, and Harry held him up, pinning his hips to the wall and licking him clean. And then he tucked Draco back into his trousers and stood up, brushing a thumb across Draco’s cheekbone.
Back downstairs, Harry called for a pizza delivery and Draco cracked open a couple of beers and turned on
about it, and something in him shied away from that prospect, the same thing that made his stomach twist sometimes when he looked at Malfoy or remembered something from that night. It felt like guilt, but also fear—the instinct to avoid examining too closely what had happened that night, and how he felt about it.
Five minutes later, Harry was wrapping his shaking fingers around a mug of hot tea, leaning up against the counter while Draco sat calmly at the kitchen table.
“Of course not,” Draco yawned, and waving his hand, extinguished the lights and cast a teeth-cleaning charm on both of them. He felt Potter shiver against him in the dark.
His fingers shook as he turned to page 17, where he was greeted by another large photo of Harry, wearing a hand-knitted jumper in Gryffindor red, with a wobbly golden snitch stitched on the front. This photo looked candid—Harry’s eyes flicked down at his lap and then up as he ducked his head, blushing and smiling shyly. Draco simply stared at it for a few moments before remembering with a frantic start that there was a whole article attached, which he immediately began scanning feverishly. It was a standard self-discovery fluff piece; Pansy knew her job and she did it well. He found the passage about midway through:
Harry sat back on his hands and let Draco tell him all about everything they were going to do. The crickets buzzed in the grass and the low orange sun was hot on his skin and he closed his eyes, listening to the sound of Draco’s voice.
, he was stupid about it too, but he couldn’t get the words out, so he just stood there gaping in a highly undignified manner.
“How did you know when I was getting home?” he asked, when they had sat down and were digging into the pasta.
“Yes, well, it was rather hard to ignore—like a train wreck, you know...” Malfoy waved a hand at the length of his body and Harry looked down at his baggy trousers and worn, faded shirt. His throat tightened. After the war, he’d burned all of Dudley’s castoffs in the backyard of Grimmauld. He had felt euphoric, on the cusp of something, clutching a bottle of whiskey to his chest as he swayed, watching the flames devour his old skin. But when he had gone the next day to replace it all, he found he had no idea what he liked, and his stomach twisted with embarrassment when he tried to approach a clerk for help. In the end, he bought a small pile of bland basics and hadn’t gone shopping since. He swallowed, trying desperately to regain his footing. But then Malfoy cleared his throat into the silence and clapped twice briskly.
Draco hummed his assent and gathered Harry into his side, slapping some money on the counter and steering them both out.
Malfoy turned slowly to look him straight in the eye and brought one finger up, touching the tip of it gently against Harry’s nose.
“That sounds fun,” Harry said. “I’ve never been to a concert before—unless you count the Weird Sisters fourth year,” he laughed.
“At least you can try,” she said. “Let him know how you really feel, what you were thinking. Maybe he’ll understand.”
He had lasted a little over six months in Auror training before coming to terms with the fact that he had a bit of an authority problem. He then spent an aimless few months renovating Grimmauld Place in the morning and getting drunk in the afternoon before Bill suggested cursebreaking: he could put his sharp instincts and defensive magic skills to use, with none of the bootlicking required in the Auror corps. A two-year Mastery program in cursebreaking later, and here he was. Gringotts didn’t care about his authority problem, as long as he neutralized any threats to their assets. And Gringotts didn’t care about Malfoy’s
“The song, It Had to Be You—you told me it reminded you of me, and then it made me think about you, and I just started to wonder? And I couldn’t stop. I’ve been trying to figure out how to tell you since I kissed you at the concert.”
Shrugging out of his robes, he moved slowly toward the kitchen, where he found Harry puttering about over the hob, plating some spaghetti in a hearty meat sauce and pouring out a bottle of red. He looked up and caught Draco’s eye, singing,
“It was last Christmas,” he began miserably. “I was just figuring things out and I ran into him at the Leaky. He was really understanding, and one thing led to another, you know—” he flushed and cleared his throat. “Anyways, we ended up going back to his and honestly? It was fantastic.” He took a deep breath. “But the next morning I woke up and I just freaked out. I mean it was
“You’re in luck Potter,” Draco pronounced, “As I have extensive experience dealing with the expectations of people who assumed I would marry a woman and beget a brood of little pureblood babies.”
Draco huffed, and in retaliation, clenched tightly around Potter inside of him, and Potter certainly had not been expecting
Draco was only too happy to provide a thorough education on the many and varied opportunities for exploration in the muggle world. Potter, ever the the golden boy, was scandalized.
Harry tried to just be happy for Draco, he really did. After all, what kind of shite friend was he if he couldn’t even support Draco because he was too busy feeling sorry for himself?
Up on the Auror Department Level, Draco checked the memo again—he was looking for Conference Room 12F. The bullpen was deserted save the unlucky Junior Aurors on night duty; only a few lights were on in the offices lining the perimeter. No one stopped him as he headed toward the back and down the hall with the conference rooms, to 12F at the end. It was empty. Draco stepped inside, willing the irritation away. The light was on, after all. Perhaps whoever had summoned him here was just running a little late. Draco settled into a chair. Surely, some brawny, pea-brained specimen would be walking in any moment now, asking Draco some excruciating question about whether Unspeakables could detect future crime patterns, or some other such rubbish.
broken up with Ginny, I was barely out to myself, much less publicly, I knew the papers would be all over me, it was just overwhelming… so—” he grimaced, “I asked him not to let it get in the papers, and I left and that was it.” Hermione’s mouth was hanging open, aghast, and Ron was rather white. “I realized I’d screwed up and I tried to be his friend, you know, and when you asked me about it, I don’t know, I panicked, I didn’t want to admit what an arse I’d been, and I knew you’d ask me how I felt and it just seemed easier to not talk about it, at least until I’d gotten myself sorted.”
“Come on,” Draco’s head was bent low, whispering in his ear, “I want to see you get off, just from this.”
“Alright,” Ron nodded, “So even your worst case is… not catastrophic, eh? Pretty much just the same as things are now?”
But Draco preened a little and thanked him, and there was a giddy feeling rising in Harry’s chest and he said, “Fancy a drink?” And when Draco said yes, Harry took his elbow to lead him over to the bar, his heart beating wildly.
The first Friday of October, they went to see Motion City Soundtrack at the Astoria, one of their favorite venues in London. They’d been listening to the new album non-stop for the past three weeks, the question,
, singlehandedly running the kids camp every summer, showing up to every charity ball without complaint, unfailingly kind to every staff member. It was probably just a harmless bit of fun to him. So Draco steadfastly ignored every infuriating jab. He remained perfectly restrained at all times, the very picture of composure in the face of Potter’s constant tormenting. It wasn’t easy, what with Potter always sauntering around in his leathers, looking unfairly delectable, winning matches left and right and grinning at Draco afterwards, sidling up to him at the afterparty and murmuring
In the three months that Draco had been a regular member of Hermione Granger’s pub quiz team, he’d started to notice some subtle shifts in the way he was treated. He’d originally shown up at the pub quiz looking for an outlet for his competitive spirit and arcane knowledge about wizarding history and culture. He’d felt sick with nerves that first night as he walked in, terrified that he would be turned away. But he had been treated politely, if not warmly, and he had been satisfied with that. He was happy just to participate, to bounce around between teams of his peers who didn’t object to his mere presence, treated him cordially, even. He didn’t think he could expect anything more, really. But recently, some of them had started to greet him when he arrived, in a genuinely friendly way; Penelope Clearwater asked how his weekend had been, or Padma Patil approached him with the latest gossip out of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Granger of course was unfailingly polite, and occasionally engaged him in truly fascinating conversation about wizarding politics or magical theory between rounds—it was still a bit awkward, but he genuinely enjoyed her company. It was all down to Potter of course, who’d continued to be bafflingly friendly after strong-arming Draco onto the team (a team he wasn’t even part of himself, by the way). Everyone followed his lead of course, despite their obvious surprise and confusion. Potter pretended not to notice, or perhaps he really didn’t notice. He always was blithely oblivious to the power he had over his peers—the way they looked up to him, deferred to him, adored him, really. No one was immune, not even Draco, despite his best efforts. He had been doing his utmost to maintain some distance from Potter, to convince himself not to want anything more out of their odd little
“Rickrolling you,” said Potter, with a shit-eating grin that Draco wanted to punch right off his stupid, square-jawed face.
“Oh, good lord, no! I—really, I think we should ease into things… But I—I mean, you said it: this is it, right?”
When they parted at the doorway, Harry wasn't sure what to say. He thanked Malfoy for inviting him, stuttering a bit. Malfoy just shrugged, stuffed his hands in his pockets, muttered
gathered at the base of Harry’s spine. His mind was slow like poured honey in this drowsy torpor, fogged over like a warm window on a cold morning, sedated and stripped to base instincts. The urge to arch back, to open his mouth, damp and hot, throbbed through him—a viscous need, an indistinct tugging at the edges of his consciousness, hovering just out of reach yet pooling all throughout his body, inexorable, like the ocean tide coming in, slow and sure and steadily vanquishing everything in its wake. He tried to focus, tried to wake up but his eyes kept slipping shut, powerless against the cradling heat of the bed, the dip of the mattress enveloping him like a nest, the slow rut of Draco’s hips. Harry couldn’t move, limbs weak and pinned down by sleep, tingling with heavy, somnolent arousal. He just wanted to
the intensity between them. Harry didn’t see why that would be the solution at all. His feelings about Draco’s friendship were just that—feelings about a friendship. Intense feelings about an intense friendship. He knew that because loving Draco felt like loving Ron and Hermione, except wilder somehow, like it was trying to break out him. He wasn’t sure it was exactly the same, because the memory had gone fuzzy with age, but he thought maybe it was a bit like the early days with Ron, when he first realized that he had a friend, when he felt that screaming feeling of possibility, the terrifying joy, the asking
Malfoy closed his eyes and drew in a long breath, and then, with the air of explaining something very simple to a small child, he said, “Potter, this is punk rock.”
Draco, with his little shop a port in the storm, his perfect flat a cradling palm, his very presence a balm on the raw, scraping edges of Harry’s days. Whatever Harry paid, it wasn’t enough. Overcome, Harry wanted to prostrate himself in supplication, touch his forehead to the floor at Draco’s feet. He sank to his knees, reverent hands, upturned face, parted lips. Draco brought his hands to Harry’s hair, fingers carding through the tangles, slow and gentle, exquisite, excruciating. No one had ever brushed his hair like that before. Harry drew a shuddering breath and took Draco into his mouth. Draco made a quiet sound, low and shaky, and his knees buckled.
Harry’s mouth fell open. “Did—did you just propose? We only just agreed we had feelings like five minutes ago! I’m literally still covered in come—yours and mine—”
discreetly on the side, you know. In those days I was rather in the habit of doing as my parents expected.” He grimaced. “Then, I spent the first year after the war re-evaluating everything I’d ever thought and every plan I’d ever made for myself.”
to join their team—he’d been even more rubbish than usual, due to Malfoy’s incredibly distracting presence next to him. It wasn’t that Harry was
“Mmm, I do like the sound of all that,” he hummed, “But right now I think I want you just like this.”
On Wednesday evening, Harry met Ron at the catering offices. The tasting was held in a bright dining hall full of small tables filled with other patrons, all of whom were testing out their own menus. An elderly maître-d quickly swooped in, presenting them with printed out menu cards and offering a selection of wines. Harry, who normally relied on Draco to pick out his wine for him, just told the man to bring them whatever he would recommend. They ate their way through a wide selection of appetizers, three types of salads, two pastas, a roast and a fish—small servings, but Harry was stuffed by the end.
Malfoy invited Harry to another show the next weekend, and then another the week after that. He kept inviting him, and Harry accepted every time, and at every one he bought a shirt.
They took the bike to Wembley, relishing the envious looks when they dismounted. The queue already wound down the pavement and they made their way to the end, plopping down on the concrete to await the opening of the doors. They’d arrived early enough to get a good spot in the pit and they weren’t disappointed when they filed in, ducking between clusters of bodies to edge up closer to the stage until the crowd began to thicken, turned from a maze to a wall. The boundaries collapsed, though, as the lights dimmed and the masses moved as one, everyone surging forward, closer, closer, filling all the spaces between each other, a steady, rolling wave from the back towards the stage.
Draco laughed, “Is that us then? An idiot and a coward, pretending our loneliness was something special? Needing the collective will of the universe to get us to see sense?” His eyes twinkled.
On Saturday, after a week in LA, Harry and Draco packed up the bike and drove about two hours up the coast to Ventura, where Warped Tour was stopping. They’d booked a cheap hotel by the venue, the Seaside Park fairgrounds. It was right on the beach, hot and bright under the Southern California sun, stages set out on the cracked, baking concrete, merch tents forming borders, mazelike. Crowding in front of the dingy hotel mirror, Harry smudged black liner around his eyes while Draco magicked his hair to stick in the perfect swoop across his forehead. Harry was clad in the Paramore t-shirt he’d gotten when he and Draco saw them play at Slam Dunk Fest the week before Ron and Hermione’s wedding. They’d released a new album since then, which frankly, fucking rocked, so he and Draco were both stoked to see them play (plus, of course, Harry would never complain about seeing Hayley Williams perform). Draco had brought his old New Found Glory t-shirt from when he had seen them in LA all those years ago. That threadbare t-shirt was one of the first muggle things Draco had ever bought for himself, back when he was still angry all the time, halfway across the world and so very alone. Harry looked over at him when they were packed tight in front of the stage, worn t-shirt dark with sweat as he flung himself into the tangled mess of a mosh pit, losing himself in the fray, this time with Harry at his side.
—punishingly, endlessly up, and when they were well above the tree line and the sun broke through the fog Harry had to admit defeat, pausing at the dusty side of the trail to slosh water down his throat, letting it run out the sides of his mouth in trickling rivulets down his neck. Draco, scarlet and dripping in sweat, still managed to look smug. But when they finally reached the top and looked out over the ocean stretching before them and the valley behind, Harry bent over and rested his hands on his knees, blew out a breath—said,
“Hey!” Ginny leaned in, slinging a protective arm around Luna’s shoulders, “Don’t insult the collective!”
Draco stood abruptly, knocking the barstool back behind him and pinning Harry with a fierce glare. “Is that supposed to make me feel better?” he hissed. “You think I’m going to skip happily on home because you really did enjoy fucking me?” Harry frowned, shaking his head— he didn’t mean— “You think it’s a great relief for me to hear that you find me so despicable, you’d keep ‘the best fuck of your life’ a secret - from even your
Draco’s eyes fluttered open as he stretched his arms overhead, capturing Harry to pull him in and kiss him, sleepy and slow. In the midst of it, Harry felt the minty shock of a breath-freshening charm. He jerked instinctively, “A little warning might be nice?” He murmured against Draco’s lips.
In the light of day though, with a very awake Draco underneath him, Harry found himself looking at an absolutely gorgeous man. Tall and tanned, with wavy brown hair and warm eyes, a square jaw full of straight, white teeth. Draco shoved Harry off the bed, sending him sprawling into the cot, “Oh no, you didn’t interrupt anything,” he purred.
Harry snorted. José grimaced apologetically at him, as if he thought he should be embarrassed or offended on Harry's behalf. Draco, spotting José’s distress, very helpfully added, “Don’t worry, José, our dear Harry suffers no shortage of self-confidence. His ego is exactly what you would expect of a World Savior.”
This chapter contains the only show that didn’t actually happen—the unnamed band at Underworld, which
Draco said, “Hello, muggle policeman?” and Harry said, “Yeah, and you’re David Bowie? You look… I mean… Wow.”
“You utter prick.” Draco pulled out unceremoniously, swinging his legs over the bed and making for the en suite, Harry’s come dripping freely down the inside of his thigh.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “You know I love some of them, but there are honestly a bunch of idiots up there.”
“Alright!” Ron broke in, “I’ll start… Harry, I wish you would shag Draco… Or Draco, you shag Harry? You can both shag each other?”
At the end of the night, hoarse, bruised and sore, they stumbled off the pavement and ducked behind some shrubbery to cast hasty disillusionment charms on each other and sneak down to the beach. Stripping nude, they charged into the crashing black waves, sluicing the saltwater over their sticky skin, shouting and sputtering, floating on their backs and looking up at the night sky. Harry could just make out the edges of Draco's body under their shoddy, drunken spellwork—a Draco-shaped shadow reflecting the rolling sea all around them. He reached out a hand, splashing around where he thought Draco's arm should be and catching it so he wouldn't float too far. They stayed tethered together, spread-eagled as the cool waves sloshed against their sides, their breath slowing. Finally, pruned and shivering, they struck back to shore and shrugged into their sour, sweaty clothes, traipsing back to their room and collapsing onto the starched sheets of the too-firm twin beds.
Potter looked back at him, self-satisfied and apologetic, so Draco fucked him over the conference table while the muggle song played on a loop in the background, and he hummed it to himself all the way back to Level Nine.
. But when a well-muscled bloke with shaggy hair and perfect teeth asked if Harry wanted to come back to his boat (with a completely straight face, as if living on a boat were perfectly normal), Harry didn’t think twice before saying
Luna turned her protuberant eyes on him. “Well, you know about our wish for Draco and Harry, of course—"
Instantly, her arms were around him. Draco buried his face in her hair, trying to steady his breathing.
—” he pushed in barely a centimeter and withdrew, “Why shouldn’t I play with you a bit, when you’ve been teasing me all this time?”
They snorted simultaneously, rolling their eyes at each other. “Yeah mate, only everyone.” Harry grinned, “Don’t worry though, we are truly like an old married couple in
. He’d thought the polite distance they had achieved in recent years was enough. But he found himself stopping down in the financial offices on Mondays after the Tornadoes had played and following Malfoy to his seat to eat together when he ran into him in the cafeteria line. The problem was that Malfoy didn’t seem too keen on being Harry’s friend, or at least, not as keen as Harry would like him to be. Malfoy was everything he had been on Christmas—sharp and incisive, witty, surprisingly warm—but just a little bit
“D’you hear that? The power of the communal intention,” Hermione poked Harry, grinning, “Our wishes are going to form a commune…” she gestured with her champagne flute, hiccupping, “a wish kibbutz, if you will…” she turned her face into Ron’s chest, dissolving into helpless laughter.
liked it. The music sounded how Harry felt all the time—it sounded like giving the middle finger to the Auror Corps and the Ministry, it sounded like wanting everyone to leave him the fuck alone, it sounded like his confusion and loneliness after Ginny didn’t want him back, it sounded like his desperate anger at everyone who had died and left him behind, it sounded like the hole in his identity where
Dean swiped his drink, throwing it back and turning a warm smile on Harry. “Really, Harry, it was a lovely ceremony. And you can relax now, eh?”
Harry laughed, throwing his head back, and then fixed his gaze on Draco’s, his eyes gone serious and earnest. “Draco,” he said low, “I want you to fuck me. I want you inside me. I—please.”
“What rules?” asked José, who had located some tall glasses and was filling a pitcher with ice water. That was good. Harry hated when guests didn’t even try to make themselves useful.
one morning in bed—” Ron whooped enthusiastically. “But no, we just brushed it off! We just woke up at the same time, you know…” he raised a meaningful eyebrow and Hermione giggled into her water while Ron sniggered, “It was nothing, really.”
On Friday the twenty-second of June, Harry and Draco clocked a full day at Gringotts, dropped the cats off with Pansy, warded Grimmauld to the teeth, loaded their bags onto the motorbike and headed to the Ministry. The grueling transatlantic jump dropped them off in New York City, where all of a sudden it was lunchtime again, and Draco insisted they eat some bagels while they waited for their next portkey to activate. They had two shorter jumps after that, routing through Atlanta, which was a hotbed for muggle airline traffic in addition to being a convenient location for a portkey stopover. By the time they landed in California, Harry was exhausted and barely awake, but as they walked to their hotel the warm humid air felt soft on his skin and Draco was a buzzing, giddy presence at his side, clutching at Harry’s arm, words sticking and tumbling out of his mouth as he ran over their plans for the week.
The problem was that he knew he was lying. Harry hated lying to his friends. It felt odd, so unfamiliar, when they had all torn down their walls and moved into each other’s gardens years ago. But he couldn’t admit it, when they asked, because he knew he wouldn’t be able stand their reaction. Every single one of them would smirk victoriously and crow about how they had all been right all along, and then Harry would be forced to explain that he wasn’t jealous of José, he was jealous of
haven’t even been shagged since—when was it, Goldstein, in the Ministry Archives after work? A Ravenclaw
The interdepartmental memo flapped around Draco’s head, poking at his shoulder insistently. He tried waving it off—he had work to do for Merlin’s sake—but it refused to take no for an answer, jabbing at him with increasing belligerence until he snatched it out of the air in frustration, crumpling it into a ball before taking a deep breath and smoothing it out on his desk. Hermione looked up from across the room.
When he was ready, and said so, Draco turned to watch as Potter slicked himself and nudged against the entrance to Draco’s body, teasing him again. He had laid his other hand carefully on Draco’s hip, and was absently rubbing his thumb in circles against Draco’s skin. Draco’s chest clenched; he squeezed his eyes shut.
There was no shortage of men looking at Draco, and he danced and flirted, even snogged a few, but whenever Harry waggled his eyebrows at Draco in their precise way that meant
José laughed and Harry watched a bit of tension leave his shoulders. He had very nice shoulders, broad and strong, and Harry thought Draco must like those shoulders a lot, and he imagined José crowding Draco up a wall, Draco’s elegant fingers clutching those tall, broad shoulders, and—where had that thought come from? Merlin, he should not be thinking about Draco’s boyfriend that way. He took a large swallow of ale and tuned back in to hear José say something about how
Harry planted his hands on either side of Draco’s head, lifting his hips so Draco could get a slick finger inside him, slow and sweet. Draco blinked up at him, wide-eyed as Harry rocked back against his hand, moaning, “
“Well, I was dropping off the monthly Auror expense reports. Usually we send them through the memo system but I’d been at my desk all day so I thought I’d just walk them over…” he trailed off awkwardly, as Malfoy’s eyes narrowed.
Draco dragged Harry out onto the dance floor then, bracing a hand on the small of his back, waltzing him around merrily, so Harry was tripping and giggling and stepping on Draco’s toes. The music changed and they found their friends, jumping and swaying and slinging their arms round each other, getting happily sloshed and basking in the joy radiating from all the assembled guests, everyone brimming over with warmth.
“I know you don’t want to give up…” she sighed. “Do you think you’ve really addressed the root of it? I mean, you’ve written him why you freaked out, and why you didn’t tell us about it, and how you feel about him now, but... It’s more than just your feelings for him—it’s whether you’re willing to stand by him, right? Think about it from his perspective. Everyone knows he’s changed, yet people hold him at arm’s length, they don’t trust him. He’s accepted, but he’s always kind of on the fringe. And then you come in, and maybe you’re interested, maybe you don’t regret it, maybe you really fancy him, but you wanted to keep him a secret, before—How does he know it’s different now?”
José went extremely red at that, coughing a bit into his drink. He had spent quite a bit of time with their whole group of friends over the past couple of months, but he still seemed a bit uneasy, clearly not used to their vicious, invasive confidences. Draco was still expounding upon just how sexually satisfied he was, to José’s obvious embarrassment, when Luna swiveled around in her seat.
… Harry yanked the duvet over his head and demanded tea. Still singing to himself, Draco acquiesced, bringing it to him in the bed and flinging open the door to the deck to let the bracing morning air in.
dignified sex you can imagine—fucking filthy shit, all your most depraved, kinkiest fantasies, the type of stuff you have to get plastered to even admit you want to try—”
It was late when Harry pushed open the door to Malfoy’s Mellow Medicinals. He paused for a moment in the doorway, closing his eyes and inhaling the fragrance of patchouli incense and vanilla candles, the sticky, pungent aroma of the weed. His body reacted instinctively to the particular smell of Malfoy’s shop—Pavlovian, the muscles in his neck released, his chest loosened as he inhaled deeply, his mouth tingling and filling with saliva. Every day he thanked Merlin that the Ministry had liberalized their drug laws a couple years back. He had always hated to see the Auror Department waste resources on distribution and possession cases. Frankly, he couldn’t be arsed to care whether any citizens were indulging in mind-altering substances in their free time. They lived in a world of literal magic, for fuck’s sake, what was the big deal about a little psychedelic experience? Anyways, Harry also appreciated the changes in the drug laws because it meant that he himself could partake without risk of investigation by his own Department. He was already Deputy Head Auror—a feat everyone said he had achieved at a shockingly young age—and it wouldn’t do to break the laws he had sworn to uphold. And it turned out that the job of Deputy Head Auror was tremendously stressful, and demanded punishing hours, and followed him home if he wasn’t careful, so he was extremely grateful that he could come into Malfoy’s shop and purchase a little bit of hard-won relaxation.
Eric picked up his drink and pushed off the bar, “No worries, mate, I just figured it couldn’t hurt to ask,” he grinned—no big deal—like he had just been informed an item in a display window wasn’t for sale. “Have a good night,” he said, and walked away.
“Malfoy…” Potter began uneasily, but Draco waved him off, swaying slightly and inclining his head towards their table. “Come on Potter, time to get back to the festivities.” Potter still looked a bit distressed, but he followed Draco off the bar, and thankfully didn’t try say anything else. Draco was relieved; he didn’t trust himself to open his mouth again.
Harry thought about lemon bars for a moment and decided that he felt extremely positively about them.
, which Harry agreed was the perfect album for singing up the California coast. Draco clung tight behind him, wind howling in their ears and swallowing their words as they let loose, shouting out,
For a moment, Harry was forcefully reminded of Malfoy standing over him stark naked, that hysterical laugh bubbling out of him, looking down at Harry with surprise and wonder in his eyes.
“Oh, hell yeah,” Harry leaned forward and plucked one of the luminous pastilles out of the box. It felt hot in his fingers, pulsing slightly. He popped it into his mouth and sucked, and it tasted warm and spicy and sweet, and it softened on his tongue and then burst—
So, he knew what Harry would feel like when they saw it live. They stood together, hand in hand as the music swelled, and when it crested Draco threw their arms in the air, and together they shouted
Draco snorted. Harry pressed a kiss to his sternum, lifting his head to grin cheekily at Draco as he skated a hand down Draco’s chest and then, lower— “it’s just, I’m always impatient to see what my presents are, Christmas morning.”
, I wanted you to— to put me on my knees, or— bend me over the desk—" He shuddered and curled back in, and Draco took advantage of the moment to stroke over his prostate, making him keen.
Harry gave it to him slowly—a second finger, and then a third, stretching him open even though he was already loose and relaxed, dripping with Harry’s saliva.
Draco sniffed, “You know he’s only going to be annoyed for exactly two seconds before he gets smug about us going together instead.”
On Tuesday, Harry cooked—carbonara, one of Draco’s favorites, which also had the advantage of feeling indulgent while being incredibly easy to throw together at the end of a long workday. When they had banished the dishes to the sink and retired to lounge contentendly on a blanket in the back garden, he cleared his throat.
After they had listened to the most cathartic breakup songs and drank a fiscally irresponsible amount of the Talisker, Draco shoved Harry onto the sofa and tucked his back up against Harry’s chest and demanded that Harry brush his hair until he was soothed. Harry, running his fingers through the fringe flopping across Draco’s forehead, felt horribly, selfishly happy. He didn’t want to feel it, the small bubble of relief in his chest. He wanted to be a better friend, a better person. But he was drunk, and Draco was his again, Harry’s limbs wrapped all around him. Harry could feel him breathing slow, and a little whisper eased through his chest,
He thought of them in this big old house, doing everything together, alone together. And then he heard the singer croon:
“I could listen to the noises you make all day, too,” he continued, “Maybe I’ll get you fired from the ministry,” he winked, “Keep you here and fuck you on my lunch breaks instead.”
“Gimme gimme—” Draco reached out, wiggling his fingers, but Harry laughed lazily, leaning out of his reach.
“S’alright mate,” Harry plucked the joint from Greg’s offering hand and took an appreciative drag before passing it to Neville. “We don’t need the holiday designation to get stoned but,” he shrugged, “Sometimes it’s fun to be a bit juvenile and self-indulgent.” José nodded slowly, looking like he wasn’t sure about that idea at all.
“Yes, well, my fears have been put to rest,” Draco smirked, swinging his legs over the edge of the bed. “Alright, I’m going to the shower to take care of… this situation,” he gestured at his crotch as he stood up, ambling across the room and sliding the bathroom door open.
“Oh,” Harry relaxed, smiling shyly, “I thought… but wait,” he frowned, “so we have to sneak around and we can’t tell anyone? Ever?”
. The words were out, and Harry couldn’t unsay them. Malfoy, incredibly, blushed even more; he was practically radiating heat, as he tucked a strand of hair behind his ear in a convulsive, self-conscious movement and said, quietly, “Thank you?”
Harry scoffed at him. It was just a walk, and only about four miles at that. And for a while, as they traipsed inland through the canyon, winding around a burbling stream, between massive old redwoods, he thought he’d been right. But then they started climbing up, and up, and
“What’s the matter, you don’t want me?” He frowned playfully, “I don’t think that’s it… I think you’re just wound too tight—"
“I wanted to get you riled up,” He let out in a rush. “I— I thought you might be… something like, like how you were just now.” Draco heard his quick, anxious inhale, “Except, not actually mad at me,” he finished sheepishly.
“Merlin, I fucking hate speeches,” Potter groaned, flopping over onto his back on the sofa and flinging an arm over his eyes. Draco flicked the cap of his beer bottle at him.
“Ah, then let me say I am honored to be a part of your grand debut,” he said with a mocking bow, straightening up to take his drink from the bartender and slap his money on the counter.
He needed to do something about this. It was too important, though, Draco was too important, to proposition him in the middle of a concert. Even Harry wasn’t that heedless—at least, not at twenty-seven years old. He needed a plan. He swallowed, threw his arms in the air and joined Draco singing along, his voice hoarse and cracking.
Harry went out and bought some CDs after that, a set of obnoxiously loud speakers for his bedroom, some headphones and a little device called a Walkman that he could put the CDs in and take around with him. Soon, he was talking about music with Malfoy at work, and listening to Malfoy’s music everywhere else. And talking about music at work actually meant talking about how Malfoy had gotten into his music in the first place, which meant talking about how Malfoy had done his Curses and Dark Arts Mastery in the United States, and how he had explored muggle culture there, and found catharsis in punk rock clubs. When he talked about music, Malfoy’s eyes would light up, and his face, usually blank and guarded, would turn hopeful, expectant when he played Harry a new song. Sometimes, it was almost endearing. Almost. The rest of the time, they maintained a strained sort of truce, a brittle cordiality. Their interactions were mostly polite, if stilted—
“I’m sorry,” he said earnestly, “If I’d had any idea you were being so daft,” he rolled his eyes, “I’d have just asked you out. But you’re very intimidating.”
and can’t Draco please cancel it? No more Potter in the lunchroom, inhaling food and ribbing his teammates, winking at Draco across the room. No more Potter popping into Draco’s office, perching his pert little professional athlete arse on the corner of Draco’s desk, sitting back on his hands and kicking his feet, batting his eyelashes and asking
Draco frowned. “I’m not really sure… All the things I think of—caring about someone, wanting to be around them, be there for them, do things with them—I feel that way about you, except—” he broke off, frowning. “It’s something more than the sum of its parts maybe… like a different
José stared at him a moment, then looked at Draco questioningly, eyes twinkling. “I appreciate that, Harry, but I think Draco should be the one to invite me, no?”
“Usually they either want to give it rough to a Death Eater or it’s like a fetish for them.” He shrugged, “I’m not really into either of those scenarios.”
Malfoy’s frown deepened—he looked a bit sad actually, and Harry had to interject, “But I meant to say yes—yes, anyways, I’ll be your lab anything,” and he immediately felt rather silly, but Malfoy’s cheeks pinked slightly, and he looked pleased.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Harry swayed a little in his seat; his mouth wouldn’t stop smiling, “How about that I just had some kind of fucking,” he dropped his voice to a whisper, “
“Well, we talked about quidditch for 15 minutes and then he left. I’m not sure I’d call that friends, exactly. Friend-
except for Sirius’ old motorcycle jacket, and it was too warm for that. He eventually settled on his darkest jeans and a plain black V-neck shirt. Malfoy wore a lot of black, so he figured that was a safe option.
, while I’m inside you. That’s what you want, isn’t it?” Draco’s whole body tensed and then sagged against the wall, and he whimpered helplessly, and Harry just smiled up at him, and bent down, taking him into his mouth again.
“You bitch!” Pansy threw a lit sparkler directly at her face; Ginny snatched it out of the air and blew her a kiss. “You swore you wouldn’t tell!”
Harry looked down at him, breathed, “Yeah? You gonna come?” Draco nodded frantically, whining, high-pitched and desperate. Harry flexed around him, and when he arched off the bed under Harry’s hands, Harry released him, bringing a hand down and barely touching himself before he was spilling over his fingers, onto Draco’s pale stomach.
“Had Hermione send me a Patronus when you left,” he shrugged. “I had to time the music right, you know,” he flashed a cheeky smile.
. He was holding back, and Harry couldn’t figure out why. It wasn’t as if they hadn’t already been deeply, almost shockingly, intimate—no use pretending they didn’t know each other that well. It was driving him batty. But Harry was nothing if not persistent. He even kept showing up to the pub quiz, once Malfoy resumed his regular attendance. And then, Harry realized that Malfoy didn’t have a team. The other regulars had formed standing teams that competed fiercely month-to-month. Pub quiz was the subject of more than one betting pool, and the rankings every month determined who was buying drinks for whom all night. The core team members were impressively dedicated. The drop-ins got divvied up randomly every month to keep the numbers roughly even. But Malfoy, who was indisputably a regular, got shuffled around just like Harry. It was even more puzzling because Malfoy clearly excelled. He knew all the wizarding history (had he actually stayed awake in Professor Binns’ class?), he ran circles around most of the others when it came to the arts and culture categories (especially the pretentious sorts), and Harry had even watched once, astonished, as he demolished the entire group in a round on muggle pop music. Malfoy was knowledgeable, and quick, and just as competitive as he had been when they’d played quidditch at Hogwarts. In other words, the teams should have been fighting tooth and nail over him. But every month he simply got slotted in wherever there was space. And Harry had been watching him, and his demeanor always went very cool and detached when he got assigned, like he didn’t care at all which team he got on, which meant that he cared very much.
Later, alone in bed, stroking Cassie in a despondent sort of way, he let himself wallow in the knowledge that Draco hadn’t ever taken a boyfriend on a double date with Ron and Hermione (although it had been years since he had a boyfriend at all, anyways). And then, sinking further into self-pity, he thought about how, before now, the four of them always went out together. Harry and Draco, Ron and Hermione. Was Draco replacing him? He was taking José as his wedding date now; he wouldn’t be going with Harry, like they’d assumed before. Harry allowed himself a moment to bury his face in the pillow and mourn the loss of Draco sitting by his side at the Weasley family table. What was he going to do, like Hermione said, when Draco left him and moved out of Grimmauld to have a life with someone else? He had laughed it off, before, but maybe Draco really would do it—leave Harry alone in this big, empty house, a sad old cat lady. Harry fisted his hands in the bedsheets and tried to calm down. He wasn’t being fair. He should be happy for Draco. This was what they wanted, yeah? And he wanted Draco to have everything he wanted. He took a few deep breaths. Draco wasn’t replacing him; he was being irrational. It was far too early to think about moving out, anyways. And didn’t they still work together, and go flying together, and go to shows together? In fact, Harry reminded himself, he and Draco were going to see My Chemical Romance, the Black Parade tour at Wembley Arena, the following Friday. They had been looking forward to it for months, and Harry reassured himself that he didn’t need to be feeling left out; Draco wasn’t going anywhere.
Draco groaned dramatically, throwing a hand over his eyes, hiding his smile. He was a frightful cuddler too. When he first moved into Grimmauld, Harry had tiptoed into Draco’s bedroom one night, hands fisted in the hem of his worn t-shirt, bleary-eyed and shaking. Draco had blinked, rasped out, “Nightmare?” And, without waiting for a response, turned down the sheets next to him. Harry had slipped in and Draco had immediately thrown an arm over his chest, murmured, “It’s alright… it’s over, it’s over,” and promptly fallen back asleep. Harry had laid there, snug under Draco’s arm as his muscles slowly unlocked, his heartbeat returned to normal. After that, they never hesitated to sneak into each other’s beds when the nights got bad.
“Sap!” Seamus blurted, apparently conscious again, catching Dean’s hand and bringing it to his mouth, mumbling over the knuckles, “You’re such a fucking sap…” Dean smiled softly down at him and Harry felt a twinge in his chest. He wanted to be a sap, really, he wanted it terribly. But he knew it was never going to happen—
Draco blinked, then smiled. “Mine I suppose—I’ll just leave now, and maybe I’ll be able to salvage this poor suit.”
Harry turned his face in toward Draco’s shoulder, closed his eyes, breathed in, breathed out. Then he looked back out over the ocean, relentless, constant, boundless; he felt the breeze on his face, cool and crisp.
Harry felt extremely out of his depth. He took a couple of steps into the office and lowered his voice. “I mean, we—” he gestured between them. “We slept together!” he whispered, feeling his face heat up. “I’ll admit I don’t know how any of this works, but I’d think that means I could ask how you’re doing if I run into you?”
Before Draco could reply that he'd been under duress when they'd reached that agreement, the first notes of
“Believe me when I say truly, I have never been better. If you don’t want to that’s okay, though,” Harry said, although secretly he didn’t feel like it would be okay at all. In fact he was quite certain he would be completely and utterly heartbroken—
Harry took a sip of ale. He was smashed into a booth at The Hawthorn and Holly—yes, sickeningly, a gay bar named after his and Draco’s wands. Their friends loved dragging them there, and he had to admit the ambience was rather nice, and they did always get free drinks so it wasn’t all bad once he got over the crushing mortification of the name. The whole gang was out, probably the last time they would manage it before Ron and Hermione’s wedding in only three weeks. Harry was currently pressed into a corner between Ron and Seamus, absentmindedly eating crisps from a basket while they carried on a heated debate about the relative merits of corned beef versus pastrami.
Once Harry had gotten home, after showering off the sweat and spilled beer, he tried on the shirt. It wasn’t particularly soft, or particularly high quality, but it felt good. It was his. He wore it to work on Monday and Malfoy ducked his head and grinned when he saw it, and then he asked how the rest of Harry’s weekend had been.
And Draco finally, inexplicably, snapped. He drained his drink and slammed it on his desk. “Christ, Potter, do you
'Lying is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off' is the song Draco sings to Harry during the Panic! At the Disco set at Reading
His smile went sharp, dangerous, “I’ll take care of you, you’ll like it, and I’ll have you all the time… I’m
. But anyways, the idea is you trick people into showing them the music video for the song, or playing it when people don’t expect it, or whatever.”
Ron leaned forward conspiratorially, “Harry shagged someone a while back and didn’t tell us for ages and then he got all clammed up about it,” he rolled his eyes, “I mean, it’s not like we’ve been best mates for twelve years or anything, must have really been a disaster—”
and jumps you—best tell him in private, I think—then you shag and it’s glorious and you’re in love, et cetera. Pretty good, yeah?”
flexible,” she smirked at Harry, “It was all over the papers. Despicable busybody, that Skeeter woman…”
and no one was paying attention. Harry’s breathing had gone slightly ragged, and he wasn’t able to focus on any of the conversations going on around him. All he could think of was the memory of Draco’s bare skin under his hands. He pressed the heel of his hand slightly against Draco’s spine, and then started slowly stroking his thumb up and down. He felt lightheaded. Surely, Draco knew now. He must know, and he wasn’t moving away, so Harry moved a hair closer, brushing their hips together.
She chuckled darkly, “no, I suppose you couldn’t, although I’d have paid good money to see that.” She raised her glass and they clinked, both drinking deeply. “So, what, you’re friends now?”
And then they would misunderstand, and look at him strangely, and he would have to say that he could barely stand to see Draco getting the one thing Harry wanted most in the world. Worse than being in love with his best friend, or his best friend's boyfriend, he would have to confess that he was a selfish prick who was too focused on his own loneliness to feel anything for anyone.
Harry pouted, “Why the long face? I caught the snitch, you know, I’m sure you saw,” he smirked. Draco stared at him stonily.
, and they danced around the kitchen, shimmying their shoulders, pointing at each other, scream-singing
Back at home, lounging on the sofa with Cassie and Circe, sucking salty grease off their fingers and passing the bowl back and forth, Draco said, "Is this it? Old age?”
Draco wrapped his fingers around Harry’s neck, drawing him in, just brushing their lips together as his other hand skated down, lower—
He laughed and bent to press a kiss to the space between Draco’s shoulder blades. “See that’s the thing. I was thinking you could call me Harry.”
Harry groaned, poking his fork in Ron’s direction, “Fine, alright, you can give me a hard time about it for two minutes while I eat.”
to do anything about these feelings. He didn’t have to pursue a relationship with Draco to hold his friendship close, to continue to lean on him, and curl up on the sofa with him, and eat takeaway late at night and headbang to punk rock in the kitchen with him. He could still have that. He could have all that, and he would be happy, too. There was no doubt in his mind. If it was what Draco wanted, there was no question that he could do it.
“Or does everyone get multiple wishes?” Hermione inquired, “I’m not well versed in the mechanics of star-wishing—"
“Speak for yourself,” Blaise drawled, “All I really wanted was for our boys to make sweet, sweet love.”
Harry rolled his eyes, hitting Draco with extra-strength cleaning and freshening charms, making him yelp indignantly.
the words, practicing them, his anxiety spiked so uncontrollably that he inevitably stuffed it back down and thought,
Harry inhaled sharply, fumbling with the laces of his kit, peeling off his layers, flushing under Draco’s gaze. And gods, he looked just as good as Draco knew he would, his compact frame thrumming with repressed energy, taut muscles shifting under his skin. Draco made no move to undress himself. He simply watched Harry, the roll of his shoulders, the flat planes of his stomach clenching as he moved.
“Honestly, I’m not sure,” he said, “I think they’re good together. They seem to make each other happy. I’m not sure what else is required?” He grimaced, feeling acutely the extent to which he didn’t understand what was required to love someone. He took a hit and passed the joint, asking, “What do you think, Greg?”
The food was indeed fantastic, the hors d’oeuvres and then the dinner and then the cake, which Molly had made, a towering confection iced in white and gold, each layer a different flavor. Harry found himself ravenous after the sudden departure of his nerves, and Draco had to restrain him from taking third helpings of everything, protesting that he was going to ruin the line of his dress robes and they hadn’t even taken any photos together yet. So after dinner, they wrangled Dean to get a few shots of them by the arch, and next to the remnants of the cake, and under the garlands Harry had helped pick out at Neville’s greenhouse.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up, “You want to go to the Weasley Christmas? I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’d love it, I just thought it might be a lot for you—”
A few feet away, Draco’s gaze caught on him and he blushed under the glitter, smiling a little. Harry’s breath caught, and then he had stopped in front of Draco, blinking dumbly with his mouth hanging open and his face getting hot and he finally managed to get out, “Hi,” and immediately wanted to sink into the ground.
His ministrations were interrupted by the soft chiming of the curtain bell, “Hello, I’m—oh, excuse me, I didn’t mean to interrupt—”
After, when the band had packed up and the lights had turned on, they stopped by the rickety merch table in the back. Harry wanted a CD to add to his burgeoning collection, and as he was picking it up, his eyes caught on the display of t-shirts pinned up to a wall of wire grating behind the table.
Draco, grinning maniacally, fisted his hands in the font of Harry’s shirt and hauled him up, smashing their mouths together once, twice, pulling back, staring Harry right in the eyes and still looking a bit deranged, he said, “God, I fucking love you.”
Snagging the pen from Ginny, Harry wrote the song down on the little slip of paper and stood up to drop their names into the queue.
“I really am sorry. I probably wasn’t as, er, polite as I could have been, when I left.” Malfoy nodded tersely. “And anyways, I thought afterwards, that, you know, I had a surprisingly good time with you, at the bar.” He stuffed his hands in his pockets and shrugged, flushing again. “I thought— well, I thought maybe we could be friends?” Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up. “Or at least, like, friendly.” Harry added hurriedly. “Friendlier than we’ve been, in the past.” Malfoy closed his eyes, took a deep breath in, and let out a long-suffering sort of sigh. The silence stretched.
, as it was fondly known by overworked students), walking him across the cropped, bright grass of the quad, through the squat glass academic buildings and the cramped student accommodations he had lived in for two years. One day, they had lunch with Draco’s favorite Professor, Jessica Jefferson, whose research focused on how colonizing wizarding populations had recast the native magical practices they encountered as Dark and used those narratives to legitimize their expansion of empire. Although Harry had preferred practical training during his own Mastery, he found himself fascinated by her work and he wasn’t at all surprised that Draco had relished her critical, intellectual courses. Afterwards, they spent the entire lazy afternoon lounging on the grass underneath a palm tree, watching the summer students scurry between the buildings, Harry drinking up Draco’s tales of his favorite memories of this place.
When he opened his eyes, Malfoy was waiting for him, lounging behind the glass display counter with a lazy smile.
The restaurant Draco had picked for his birthday dinner was insanely posh—the type of establishment Harry would only go to for Draco’s birthday dinner. He always felt uncomfortable in places like this, a little raw, exposed, like it was visible on his body somehow—written in the way he inhabited his jacket, the way his body filled the space in the room, that he had never had properly fitting clothes, that no one had taught him manners beyond
Draco stared at the photos for a few moments, imagining what the coverage would have been had it been him holding Potter’s hand. Then he threw the paper into the fire and flooed into work.
Harry let out a real laugh this time, full and warm, and lifted up on his toes to fit their open, smiling mouths together. And it was easy, too, to tangle his fingers in Draco’s hair, to push him up against the table and roll their hips together. Easy to map Draco's body, searching out how to make him feel good. Easy to let the heat creep up his spine. Harry made a sound—a soft one, vulnerable, exactly what he had been afraid of—stripping himself raw, laying himself bare. But he wasn’t afraid anymore. Now he was open, frantic. He pressed their foreheads together, panting.
“I just don’t know what I can do at this point. He doesn’t want me to write to him and I have to respect that. He wants to act like nothing ever happened when I do see him, which I suppose I also have to respect, since this is all my fault anyways…” he trailed off, groaning.
Draco was squished up against Harry's side, crowded around a sticky table in a grimy muggle pub, flipping through a binder of equally sticky clear plastic sheets. Pansy had dragged them out for karaoke; she and Ginny had their heads together, writing their names down on a scrap of paper for whatever song they were signing up for. Hermione, who had started the whole thing by explaining to
, pressed up against the cleft of his arse, and perhaps there were reasons why he shouldn’t relax further back into the cradle of Draco’s hips, but his brain was fuzzy with sleep and he couldn’t remember what those reasons were or bring himself to care about them. Could it really be so bad? If, maybe, he turned his head and nuzzled into the hollow spot at the base of Draco’s neck? If they tangled their legs together in the sheets?
'Alive With the Glory of Love' by Say Anything is the song Draco is singing when Harry walks in on him cleaning
“No you didn’t, Harry, you tried and failed. Don’t get it twisted. I, on the other hand, successfully sabotaged the wish—while remaining respectful of the collective, I might add—” He inclined his head at Luna, “I wished that Harry and I would fall in love and settle down with whomever we’re meant to be with.” He paused uncomfortably, “No pressure, of course.”
The night wore on and José seemed mollified by Draco’s sabotage, but he hardly spoke to Harry. Harry tried to act normally, as if that hadn't been catastrophically awkward, but he was distracted—unsettled by the sudden reminder of the New Year's wish, and the way José’s eyes had searched him, like he was sure he would find a secret.
“Ignore him.” Draco floated loftily into the room, settling himself at the table and shaking out the paper. “What do you have for us today?”
Blaise grinned, sharklike. “Draco, darling… Harry, sweet Harry…” He swept an upturned palm towards them, “I wish upon you the most dignified lovemaking—that you might stare tenderly into each other’s eyes and whisper sweet nothings into each other’s ears—that you might uncover your deepest desires together—feast upon a cornucopia of carnal pleasure the likes of which you had heretofore never imagined—”
again, moving closer, and their noses bumped together, glanced off so they were cheek to cheek, and Harry was surrounded by the patchouli and vanilla scent of Malfoy’s shop; his body was reacting as it always did, relaxing further, and he sighed and turned his open mouth into the hinge of Malfoy’s jaw, dragged his lips back toward Malfoy’s, kissed him, lush and warm. He was there for a moment, an eternity, before another question welled up inside him, urgent, uninhibited.
