“Will do. Your happiness is paramount.” Potter turned away, chuckling.
Harry’s dislike at the possibility of Ron being put in danger must have shown on his face, because Gawain eyed him back, looking equally livid.
“I trained in France,” Draco replied. “Well, we
A man’s head in the fire-place turned in his direction, his brow creased in concern and confusion, but Potter’s partner didn’t look surprised in the slightest.
? To do what, exactly? Make awkward small talk?
In the far corner, under the window, the nettles for another concoction had finally absorbed up all the rowan tree sap, so he crushed them up in his mortar and pestle and laid the resulting mash out to dry overnight. That potion should be ready to start brewing this time tomorrow, but he didn’t really want to dwell on that.
The next few days were a blur; Harry mostly spent his time being fussed over by Hermione in his London flat (he’d sold the Grimmauld Place house years ago, not needing the space or wanting the memories). She nagged him to eat, nagged him to bathe, nagged him to sleep, nagged him to get outside for a walk in the fresh autumn air and weak sunlight.
When Harry opened his eyes, everything ruddy hurt.
A knock at the door chilled him, and his mother downed her wine before she drew her wand and preceded him to entry-way.
After a long squeeze in greeting on his shoulder, Ron cleared his throat and eyed Harry with something akin to nervousness.
But, he couldn’t be blamed for that.
“We’re not engaged, Mother,” Draco pointed out, though he accepted the glass of champagne she was offering him all the same.
“What’s done is done,” Harry pressed his teeth into Draco’s throat, hands slipping into his robes and parting them. It wasn’t forgiveness, but acceptance and agreement to move on. That was enough.
“To bed. Right,” Draco croaked in agreement. “Just... find him, be careful about it and then clear off, thanks. So, adding you to the mix, with your propensity for trouble, is a damn headache that I don’t need. Find him, clear off
But she was already peering through the peep-hole, and then, with a scoffed laugh, threw the door wide open.
“That’s nice.” Draco even meant it. A little.
“No, you weren’t,” Draco agreed pointedly, making a show of deliberately stepping around him to resume his trek back to the practice with his medical gear.
“Hey, Malfoy.”
Draco looked away, Potter’s eyes too intense, his words too comforting. It wasn’t to be trusted.
“I didn’t lie. You asked if I’d
“Oh! Hi. Sorry. Wasn’t looking where I was going.”
Draco let himself into his warm cottage and headed straight to the fridge for the bottle of Sauvignon Blanc that his mother had sent from her home near Sancerre just a few days ago.
“If I wait,” Innes said over his shoulder as he reached his door, “and Yaxley disappears... I know where he’s likely to be. It’s my turn to surprise him.”
“Anything of note?” Innes gestured to the file as he dropped into the chair opposite Harry. He never read the case notes if he could avoid it, and usually just made Harry summarise the important bits, citing his own skill and experience as far more useful than anything ever written in ink on parchment.
“Why?” Draco didn't know how else to respond.
“You were difficult to find, even for me,” Harry shrugged at her, before he turned to meet Draco’s gaze.
The original note had been slipped under the surgery door, addressed to Draco; Isobel had collected it along with the rest of his post and had left it on his desk.
Malfoy,” Rhona interrupted.
The wind off the sea had chilled his skin, and he felt raw, shaken and shivery, even as the heat from his home seeped through his robes.
“No,” she spat crossly, so he nodded once and headed straight to the door, already sick of her.
“I'm not having sex with Malfoy!”
Despite
So Potter kissing him, gentle and soft, fingers feather light on the back of Draco’s neck, was far from unwelcome. Draco sighed into it, let himself enjoy it, stepped closer and slid his arms around Potter’s trim waist.
“Well, then. It’s been a long time, Potter. I’ll pop out and get a bottle or two to ring in our reunion, shall I?” Draco’s mother didn’t wait for an answer, just pulled her cape on and ducked out into the wind.
under a pseudonym.
Then Potter’s oaf of a partner slammed his way inside, Potter’s unconscious body thrown over his shoulder. Draco was scrambling over to help lay him down flat on the flagstones without thinking about it, worry beating the guilt to churn away in his stomach.
“I knew you’d betray me, you little bastard. Surely you know what happens now; as soon as I saw this dead prick waltz in here, I sent my men to do the job.”
Draco spent most of the rest of the day in his garden – it hadn’t been ‘cool’ to enjoy Herbology back at school, and he’d regretted not paying more attention. Atrix Campbell, who ran the apothecary for his grandparents now they were getting on in years, couldn’t always get the supplies Draco needed, so he had to grow a lot of the rarer herbs and plants himself.
“How is your conversation applicable to work?” Harry called to him.
“I don’t know,” Harry told him helplessly. “It really doesn’t look like there’s any trace of him, does it?”
But getting to Yaxley's last known location... ugh.
“I never hated you.”
“We just don’t get strangers here,” she'd told him helplessly, taking up her knitting needles, on which an ice-blue scarf was taking shape. “You and your oaf of a partner are the first all year. Now,” she took a sip of her tea before she forged on, “You tell that horrid chap you’re with not to go riling up the Healer! He’s the best thing that’s happened to this village in a long time. He fixed my hip, you know, and I’m ever so pleased. Now I can manage the stairs better than ever and I'm making him this scarf; he wouldn’t take any payment.”
“Yeah. Look, this actually wasn’t completely awful, so. Thanks.”
They have another drink each, the silences falling a little less awkward whenever the conversation stops flowing.
“Is it so unbelievable that I might want to do good? To help people?” Draco felt his hackles rise.
!” Draco sneered. “I’m sick of you being here! Can’t you stop wasting time lingering outside doors trying to touch me and just bloody find him?!”
Pointedly, he turned his attention fully back to Potter, who was looking morose.
“Don’t tell me that’s it,” Draco couldn’t help but tease, when Harry sank down onto his chest all sweaty and spent, panting for breath. “Don’t tell me that’s all that the cock I’ve been fantasizing about for almost a decade can give me...”
questioned the villagers.
Draco froze as Harry was admitted in a flurry of wind and ruffled hair, his smile a little sheepish.
“Not unscathed. Trauma just looks a little different on me than on you. I fought him several times, never wanting it, never knowing what to do, never expecting to survive. I lost friends and family to him. But you had him breathing down your neck your whole life, your head filled up with his ideals and the promise he would return. There was nothing your family could do to break away, even when he was believed to be gone.”
“Yes, it's so off-putting that
“Don’t be ridiculous, darling, of course you are,” Narcissa cut him off, as she raised her glass in a toast.
to the Isle of Iona for this case if it meant he didn’t have to use the network. And he was perfectly serious about it, too.
“So you didn’t take a wrong turn for once?!” Innes roared, clapping Harry about the shoulder good naturedly and sending more black soot onto the flagstones at their feet. “Not like last time when you went shooting out into that old Muggle woman’s living room, two doors down from the mark!”
But the fatigue of hours kneeling in the cold wind and water at the shoreline, along with the alcohol, the warmth of the fire, and the proximity to Potter – wait, what, no – all combine to overwhelm Draco after a while.
Innes scowled at him but after a few tense moments he turned and stomped back to the bar for more to drink, pocketing his wand with one last glare at Draco as he went.
villages you’re keeping me locked up in any longer! Do you know how hard it is to get a Chilean red wine here?”
Only too happy to turn away from him and head down the path of his first house-call, Harry glanced at the slumping pink begonias in a hanging basket at the front door, which itself needed a fresh coat of yellow paint, then reached out to knock.
“Thanks,” Harry bade the family farewell, but the mother didn’t have time to respond with any more than a quick wave. Her boys had found some sticks and were whacking each other with them. The little girl was wailing about poor attendance to her tea-party. And, as Harry reached the road, he heard the baby sneeze once more.
fault the fireplace had heard five instead of nine, but Innes used the delay to beat him to the bar and order two glasses of scotch, leaving Harry to collect his luggage.
“I’ll ask Draco the same questions I’m asking everyone, because the only reason we’re here is to find this man,” Harry cut her off loudly, shoving the photo of Yaxley under her nose. “Now, Rhona, have you seen him?”
The little village of Adharmuir was hidden behind a mirage of empty air and unfertile, rocky earth. Like at Hogwarts, any muggles who ventured past the first set of marker stones would be overcome by the curiously insistent need to immediately leave. So far it had worked, and no muggle had ever made it past the second set of stones which the village lay behind, which had an even stronger charm in place to repel outsiders.
? Just as quickly as it had flared, his anger faded.
The night air was a shock to the system after the stuffy heat of the pub, but Draco always rather enjoyed the way the icy wind billowed down the lane. Tonight, it cooled the heat from his face and the sweat from his palms. It didn't alleviate his rapid pulse, however.
Innes had got it in the neck though, doors slammed in his face and one old man had actually ‘spilled’ coffee all down Innes's front as he’d poured it for him.
The woman smiled tiredly at him. “Thank you, Healer Malfoy.”
The door to the inn opened then and in the next instant Innes, who had been facing it, was on his feet and pulling out his wand. Harry leaped up to mimic him out of instinct, upending the table as he did so, his salmon sent flying.
“You knew, then?”
Potter smiled as he watched Draco hide a yawn in his elbow.
“Which one is the Healer’s house, just out of interest?” Harry asked the woman, trying to sound casual as he tucked the photo back into his file. He merely wanted to ensure it wasn’t Innes who called upon Draco, was all.
“They lead... very particular lives,” Draco murmured, in response to the obvious distaste in Potter’s face. “Not all of us are world-saving heroes like you and yours. Their strengths have always been... elsewhere.”
and made a beeline for home and his bath.
“Is that wise?”
“I’m not
“And she did. And it worked.”
“No, of course not. Just curious.” He poured tea through the strainer and into his teacup, feigning nonchalance.
The room around them was dead silent with tension, though the young Quidditch fan from the bar had rushed to Draco’s side and hovered with a protective hand around his elbow as she murmured something in his ear, and a middle-aged couple had stood to position themselves directly between him and Innes.
“Lad’s never happy,” Innes grunted. “I don’t give a flobberworm’s ass about his happiness, so long as he lives.”
“Don’t worry, Malfoy,” Harry drawled from above him, as three fingers slide into where his cock had just been. “You think I don’t more in store for you? You’re not the only one who’s been waiting on this for ten years...”
Draco, who had been healing up a minor injury to her shoulder, could only gape at her.
“Put that on the list for if I do?”
It was freezing cold, the barren island windswept and rocky. Icy gales blew on all sides, from the mainland of Mull and off the Arctic Sea. The north of the island was inhabited by a few Muggles, had an historic Abbey as a tourist attraction, and a few pubs and inns that were popular in summer.
Harry, who was open-mouthed with shock, couldn’t tear his eyes away. Malfoy’s hair was longer, long enough to tie back, and he’d grown taller, it seemed, or else he somehow managed to fill out his robes now far better than he had their Hogwarts gear. Other than that he still looked so familiar – still fair-skinned and regal, with apprehension in his light eyes. Forcing himself to look away from his former nemesis, Harry lowered his own wand and grabbed at Innes’s arm, hissing for him to stop.
Innes scowled so heavily that Harry thought his eyeballs might bulge right out of their sockets, but he went stamping off to finish his rounds all the same.
“He’s not. I just didn’t expect to see him. I wasn’t informed he lived here.”
Ron made appearances in the evenings, chipper and chatty, insistently talking about anything other than work.
He took it with a long sigh, steeled himself with a brief few seconds spent remembering Potter, last night, his hands, his mouth...
it’s wrong... all of that comes from a place of protection, and identity. In themselves those aren’t bad morals. The sacred 28 families, the bloodlines... if some people want to preserve those by excessive and weirdo in-breeding, fine. But the concept that that blood makes them special,
Innes’ body lay at his feet.
“Find. Him.”
, he thinks, but doesn’t say. He also doesn’t let on to the fact that he hasn’t actually heard from either of them, or any other of his ‘friends’, in almost a year. Not that he'd told anyone from his past that he was back in the UK, not even Gregory. He didn’t need friends, didn’t miss them, didn’t want them to visit, Merlin forbid. Besides, this village was his, his sanctuary, his place of rest and peace, where he didn’t have to put on airs or pretend. He didn’t want them to wreck it all and bring back the old Draco Malfoy to the fore. He was so far down the path of freedom, so close to happiness and self-acceptance. He could handle the loneliness if it meant preservation of his tentative peace.
Sighing, Harry flagged down the waitress to order him and his partner some food, and Innes finally deigned to join him as she departed for the kitchen.
“Hi, it’s Rhona, right?”
Draco apparated as soon as they were past the boundary stones, taking them to the wet, windswept coastline to north-west. He gestured at one of the rocky, tiny islands out on the water just ahead.
If Draco watched until he was out of sight down the lane, at least there was no one around to know about it.
, I’d rather fly to Iona, Gawain, honestly. Stop laughing!”
Harry headed up the stairs, rolling his eyes again. He left Innes’s bag on the bed of the room that looked over green but rocky landscape to the east, and claimed the better room for himself, which had a view of the little village lane below as it ran all the way down to the raging sea.
Yeah, looking at him certainly hadn’t been a hardship.
“Does that matter?”
“Perhaps you should wait...”
“I was raised scared and surrounded, hid it with an arrogance I never felt, a self-confidence I had to fake. Death Eaters and the... the pure blood ideology... the motives, the fucked-up beliefs they hold tight to their chests with both hands because they
,” Draco blurted all in a rush, because he
“That’s in case I don’t come back,” he mumbled against Draco’s lips, when he finally found the strength to pull back enough to explain himself.
“Hey, Draco.” Potter said, laying aside his files and settling back in his armchair, looking completely at ease.
jump out of their skin and maybe scream a little bit if they went out the front door of their business and ran smack into Potter? Yes, he was rushing, but Una McIntosh had just fire-called to say her man Darragh had almost been dragged into the sea by a hippocampus, and was left with a nasty bite.
“Come in,” he called, recognising the measure of the knock and finally feeling fortified enough to deal with his partner.
“He’s Harry Potter, lassie. Boy what Lived,” Innes grunted, not very helpfully, from the bar.
day was mildly worrying. He’d skulked into the inn – not
“Sure, yes, please,” Potter sighed, gripped his unruly hair in frustration and squeezed, then let go with another sigh.
She shot him a searching look as she straightened up. “
“I’m so glad you’re safe,” Harry told him quietly, eventually. “We got the report of the attack, but tracking you two was damn hard. Your mother should teach classes to the Aurors.”
“We don’t know bugger all, lad. Get some sleep. Early start.”
“We’ll go door to door in the morning. Start at the east of the village, work our way west to the coast. Whoever this ruddy anonymous source was, that little shit Malfoy or someone else, we'll turn something up. We
“No, Isla, I can’t. I have to get to the practice, remember?” Still not meeting Harry’s eyes, he turned to the woman who had come to the door to help pull her daughter off him.
Innes turned back to the barkeep and they shook their heads at each other in mutual disgust, as the older Auror grumbled, “Laddie always tries to slip water in when he thinks I’m not looking. Not on my watch!”
He dithered at the door, examining the fuchsias in their window box under the sill, taking in the view up and down the lane, the angry sea to one side, rocky landscape to the other.
Then the girl took the opportunity to half climb up Draco’s torso. “Are you staying for the tea party after all, Draco?”
In hindsight, there was never any way Harry would find the trek across the rocky island enjoyable.
“He is!”
“Cave on an island off the coast.”
“Call it a night?” Potter looked ready to drop off in his armchair, too.
“I’m an Auror. It’s my job! My partner is out there, alone, and I don’t remember a damn thing about where we were when Yaxley attacked! Draco, there’s a life at stake here! If you knew information all along, why did you keep it from me?!”
As they watched, the boys came to halt just before these markers, standing as close as they possibly could without crossing the boundary and turning to smirk at their mother.
Harry rolled his eyes at the ceiling.
Clearing his throat and trying to ignore the way his fingertips still felt the pull of wanting to almost-touch Draco again, Harry opened his mouth to explain his presence when sounds of crashing and shouting reached their ears from inside the house.
“Alright look,” Harry pitched his voice loud enough to carry. “My partner and I are Aurors here on official Ministry business. We’re searching for a man named Corban Yaxley, who’s been sighted in the area; a former Death Eater. He is considered highly dangerous and there is a warrant out for his immediate arrest, so if you do see him, please do not approach him. We’ll be talking to each of you over the next few days, to find out if you’ve spotted anyone new or suspicious about the place. Now, about Mr. Malfoy,” he started to add.
Only once he looked impeccable did he leave his cottage, dropping his medical bag at his empty practice before crossing the road, almost eager for the warmth of the inn.
He went to his absurdly messy desk and rooted through a drawer, scraps of parchment and broken quills spilling out onto the floor. When he produced a letter in a sealed envelope, he looked rather proud of himself.
It was mid-morning before Harry and Innes finally got out onto the street the next day. A fire call to Robards had descended into a three-way yelling match as they’d all vented their frustrations – Harry at Gawain for not warning him about Malfoy’s presence on the island and at Innes for being such a jerk the previous evening; Innes at Gawain for sending him on this mission with the ruddy boy who was ruddy in love with ruddy Malfoy or something (“
“You don’t need to look so worried,” Harry told him, helplessly, as anger took over the other man’s features.
“You’ve found him?” Draco gasped, even as he hunched over Potter, touched his cold face, his stupid hair, the undamaged skin of his ribs above the bloody wound.
It had been one heck of a shock, walking into his local pub after a harried day of curing sniffles and patching up grazes, only to come face to face with two wands pointed at his chest and Potter’s frantic green eyes.
that had happened, the old man had refused to say, and still did to this day. Draco, a specialist of creature-induced injuries, had been called out to this windswept little island and simply never left.
“Look. Potter. I... Look, this doesn’t make us friends. We had shitty childhoods, a lot of crap thrown at us at Hogwarts, even more crap with Voldemort and now... we’re both in the same boat, trying to move on from something that won’t ever let go. But we’re not friends. I don’t have friends, and if I did, I wouldn’t want
“Alone.”
He needn’t have bothered. Yaxley was sitting on a rock inside the cave as if it were a throne, casual as anything.
“Shut up!” Gawain yelled from the fire-place, the flames spitting out into the room.
“Don’t move,” Draco’s face appeared above him, a worried frown marring his features.
these isolated, disturbingly
“Faster,” he groaned out, sliding his hands down Potter’s sweat-damp bare back, squeezing at his waist, his hips, his ass. “Come on. Faster. Harder.”
“You distract yourself by pushing your mind and your body to capacity, throw yourself into focusing on others,” Potter nodded along like he understood, as they wandered through Draco’s little front gate and up the front path.
Taking another breath, Harry turned and made his way over to Draco as the table righted itself in the background, mended pieces of crockery flying back into their proper formation.
He was on his second cup of tea, scowling into the fire with the crusts of his toast abandoned on the plate when another knock sounded at his door.
Draco was sure Tavish didn’t even like him all that much, so it was kind of nice to know he may be willing to go head to head with an Auror for him.
The messages, always written in green ink, were the only way Yaxley had contacted him since the first one, a month prior.
“Do you want to have a drink with me tonight?” Potter repeated, all cocked head and stupidly tentative expression. The salt-and-ice wind off the sea ruffled at his hair and his equally dark robes.
He’d always come for her, and she would always protect him.
“You’ve got several weeks of bereavement left,” Dawlish reminded him gently. “You don’t need to be here, so don’t be here. But before you go, I’ve got something for you.”
Draco looked away, his mouth a thin line, shoulders tense. He stayed that way even after Harry stumbled to cross the room, and wrapped his arms around his waist for balance as he kissed him.
Draco ruddy Malfoy reappearing to snatch Harry’s attention after all this time… something was going to go wrong, Harry could practically taste it.
“Will you two
But no. No. There was no way a shag was worth the undoubtedly ensuing drama, not even with stupidly attractive Potter.
But Draco was right on his heels as he staggered down the stairs and out into the street. As Harry started to jog towards the inland side of the village, Draco grabbed for his hand again.
“Young chaps like the two of you have a lot more to live for,” Dawlish shrugged. “And a fuck-ton more to learn.”
Draco shook her gently back down onto the ground, and avoided Harry’s questioning gaze.
“I can’t. I swore an oath,” Harry kissed Draco again, even as he reached up to untangled the fingers curled around him, intending it to be goodbye.
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Draco! Innes could be in trouble!” Harry didn’t know how to feel. Fury, fear and betrayal all circled each other in his stomach, as he struggled to stand.
“If I can be of any help,” Draco murmured, feeling bad for him, weirdly. “Let me know. The sooner you find him, the sooner you’re out of my village. So, you know, I’m hoping you find him quick.”
Then he shot Draco a long look, not even trying to hide the heartbreak on his face, before he crouched down to lay a hand on Innes’ cold chest.
“We barely just survived an attack from three men trying to kill us, and you’re worried about the cleanliness of this place? It’s
It was Draco’s practice next and Merlin, Harry so wasn’t mentally prepared for this.
The man shook Harry’s hand roughly. He was about twenty years older than Innes, therefore in his sixties, but the two seemed fast friends already.
“Harry,” Innes whacked him a bit too hard about the shoulder to get his attention. “Barkeep here owns the place. Alasdair MacKinnon.”
Draco liked it here, though, for all it’s claustrophobic, isolated charm. It was home now, the little village with its crotchety, hardened villagers. Distance from his mother was best. Distance from his father was welcome. He could remake himself here. He
“He’ll be at the practice until the early afternoon, but it’s the largest house at the other end of the village, two-storey, quite close to the water.”
It had been ages since Draco had last gotten laid, so he wanted it as frantic and fast as Potter could manage. The sensation – as Harry got the message and pulled out a little to press his knees to the bed for leverage, then set an even more gruelling pace – was incredible.
“It will be undoubtedly awful.”
Most Death Eaters had been captured and rounded up in the years since the battle of Hogwarts, yet Yaxley had evaded all the Auror’s attempts so far. But Harry was certain he wouldn’t be able to hide from them this time – Innes had been born and raised in the wizarding community just over the water on the isle of Mull and knew Iona and all its surrounding islands like the back of his hand. And Harry, well... no one else had quite his type of experience when it came to the followers of Voldemort.
It was significantly late when Draco finally got around to eating his dinner.
They stared at each other. After a long moment, Harry dropped his arm.
It would be ready in the next 24 hours, which was good – his client was impatient, and Draco wanted the stress of it off his shoulders. Nothing was worse than customers who expected to be handed a rare concoction immediately, especially those that required a long, slow and careful brew like the
caring, he spent a fair amount of time deciding on robes, and cologne, and how to style his hair. Not that it was for Potter’s sake; Draco’s reputation had taken a hit last night thanks to Potter’s oaf of a partner. But if there was one thing Draco Malfoy knew, it was how to recover his dignity through maintaining an aura of regality and pride through composure, veneer and style.
“If you’ll have me.”
It was well into the afternoon by the time Draco could at least head home from the water’s edge, his stomach growling from hunger, with sand all through his robes and the scent of blood and antiseptic still stinging his nostrils. He’d cleaned and healed the deep wound to Darragh’s leg easily enough, but it was a frightening thing, a hippocampus so close to the island. He’d quickly fire-called the Department of Magical Creatures from the McIntosh’s cottage to corral the creature safely away.
“Potter, I’ll need to fire-call Molly Weasley. We’ve got an engagement to plan, obviously.”
“You took your time,” Narcissa sniffed as she looked the new arrival up and down.
Then Potter, all hesitant eyes and low tone, stopped beating around the bush.
“No, he’s not! Is he Yaxley? No! There’s one criminal on this island, and it’s not Malfoy!”
“Yaxley. He attacked you. Innes brought you back last night, half dead. Didn’t I explicitly tell you to be careful?”
potion.
“Why’d you become a Healer?” Potter decided he wanted to know, as they walked into the wind, heading down the lane towards the water.
“But there isn’t time for that,” Harry’s partner Innes MacGregor interjected, slowly, as if Harry was daft. “Do you want an apparition point then, lad? Or a portkey?”
“If only.” Potter looked quite drained, actually. “The only person we’re yet to speak to is you, and if you haven’t seen him, then we’re really screwed.”
Harry took out his wand and led the way, casting a muffling charm over them both.
Ron was already there, and Harry sat with him in his office, unable to step into the one he shared with Innes.
“We don’t know jack shit!” Gawain roared over them both. “Because you two still haven’t deigned to do your fucking job and canvas the fucking village! Malfoy is to be questioned along with everyone else, nothing more, nothing less. I didn’t tell you that he lives there, Potter, because it’s none of your bloody damn business! He is a trained medical professional and has done nothing to warrant any suspicion. Innes, he has served his community these past years in ways you can’t imagine, from curing the most complex of diseases to healing the most minor of skinned knees so do
“Neat, boy,” Innes scowled back at Harry over his shoulder. “Ye’ da wasn’t around to teach it to you, so I’ll teach it to you. You drink scotch
“I have to go. She’s in danger, you heard him. He’s already dispatched them. I have to go!”
“I quite agree,” Harry grumbled moodily, as she let herself back out.
“Not always possible, sorry. Where’s Innes now? How long ago did he go after him?”
“Has anyone given him trouble?” Harry didn’t know why it was important to him to know that Draco was happy enough, and was being treated fairly – perhaps his guilt and embarrassment over Innes’s slander earlier had stung him more than he’d realised.
It was distracting, a case to focus on, a criminal to hunt down, but Malfoy getting under his feet too, all long blonde hair and pale skin that must bruise easy under lips and fingers, flashing grey eyes full of challenge as he’d faced Harry in the pub, as they’d walked together in the wind, as they’d stood by his front door.
“Yes.”
! Get your arses around the island tomorrow, and fucking track Yaxley, or else I’ll pull you both off this case and send in Weasley and Dawlish!”
They traded a bit more small talk about what they and their respective friends have been up to since Hogwarts; Draco told Potter about Blaise’s modelling work, and how Pansy writes a gossip column for
Draco headed upstairs to the room he’d converted into a laboratory and checked on the cauldron in which he was reducing a potion into a burn-healing paste. That would do for Mrs. Stewart, a single mother of four, whose two-year-old boy Magnus had developed a habit of sneezing flames as he came into his magic. It would pass, but for now the paste would be ready tomorrow – Draco would take it over to her before he opened the clinic. Her children were sweet kids, polite and funny, but a handful. Her prick of an ex-husband had run off with a Muggle hairdresser from Mull a year back, so Draco tried to make life easier for her whenever he could.
Too scared to look down at Potter, Draco pulled his prone body up onto his lap, and levitated him out the door and over the road to his clinic, not dropping the spell until Potter was on the hospital bed. Then Draco pulled on his Healer robes and gear and bent over the wound.
Then he pulled back.
“You realize you’ll have to Floo back and forth from the Ministry every day? The village is warded against apparition. Unless you want to walk back and forth from the barriers.”
“The island is tiny, and this village is a single lane, with a population of under fifty,” Harry muttered with a shake of his head, not taking his eyes off the flames. This wasn’t enough to go on. He had a sinking feeling that in a few days they would have trawled the island top to bottom, and they still wouldn’t turn Yaxley up. “How do we know the target hasn’t moved on? He surely hasn't been able to stay in the vicinity.”
Draco woke on Sunday feeling weirdly disappointed, and wasted half the morning shuffling about accomplishing nothing, unable to focus. The two figures he’d seen leaving the inn bright and early had headed out of the village and were unlikely to be back all day. Pretending it didn’t bother him was draining. But what if they did find Yaxley? Even worse, what if they didn’t?
“He’s not a target,” Harry insisted, taking a rather violent bite of his toast. “And I’m not mighty.”
He poured himself a large glass of the wine and leaned against his white marble kitchen counter to take the first fortifying gulp. As if the day hadn’t been long and draining enough as it were…
“Shut
“There’s been no sighting of Yaxley as far as Alasdair knows. But we’ll have to get out into the village tomorrow, have a proper look about, find out who knows what.”
Draco finished his glass of wine and climbed out of the cooling water, drying himself quickly with a towel that a fit of pique made him throw on the floor. He stood before the fire roaring in his bedroom, still disquieted, but resolved. He didn’t know where bloody Yaxley was to be found. But he had, dare he admit it, faith in Potter. He’d find the criminal and bugger back off to London like a big hero, as always, and leave Draco in peace before the week was out.
“Slimy bastard’s seen Yaxley, or I’m a Quaffle. He’s helping him too, or I’m a fucking beater’s bat! He’s a fucking Death Eater, lad!” Innes was furious. He was one of many who’d never accepted the pardoning of the Malfoy’s by the Ministry. But Harry wasn’t about to stand back and let him attack a civilian unprovoked.
“It’s alright, Rhona,” Draco murmured to her, as he backed away to the door even as Harry approached, and then turned and disappeared through it before Harry could even say his name.
“You’ve got issues, Potter,” Draco snapped at him, when Potter almost walked smack into him for the third time today.
He was still trying to mull through his foggy head and ghostly feel of Draco’s lips still on his, when he slid back into the pub. It felt like walking into a wall of warmth, the air heavy with heat from the fire. He made a beeline for the bar to get another drink, then took it upstairs.
. But oh, Potter, in Merlin’s name, will
He looked it, too, eyes heavy with weariness, face drawn.
Draco chucked the little boy she held in her arms under his chin and was away down the front path before Harry could even wish him good morning. By the time Harry turned back to the door, the woman was staring at him questioningly.
A finger appeared alongside his head and began gesturing threateningly at them. “So both of you
“Good day.” Harry launched into his usual spiel of explaining who he was and why he was here, but two young boys barrelling from the house and crawling between his legs to shoot across the lawn brought him up short.
“I did not!” Harry spat. “And even if I did, what business is it of yours?!”
“How do we know Malfoy’s not in on this with Yaxley?” Innes demanded.
Innes snorted, and it was Harry’s turn to glare.
Innes sulked, refusing to speak to him, so it was a quiet walk.
harass him!”
“Falcons will win,” Innes was certain.
“How’s your Mum?”
Heaving a deep sigh of relief, Harry waved his own wand at the mess he’d made of the table behind him. Draco remained at the door, seemingly frozen in shock, or anger, or fear. Harry couldn’t tell which.
There wasn’t much more to say, which was lucky, because Draco couldn’t stop kissing him.
“I’ll double my efforts, just for you,” Potter laughed as he stood. “I’ll walk you home. I need fresh air to wake me up, still got some work to do tonight.”
“Well, he’s been here about two years, since he finished his Mediwizard training in France. The village hasn’t had a healer in a long time, but it’s one of the new reforms, a Healer to every magical community. He showed up one day, settled in, opened up his practice and that’s been that.”
“Quiet, lad. Falcons will have the day. That Flint’s been on top form of late, he’s unstoppable.”
“How are Weasley and Granger?” Draco asked, trying to distract him, taking a long gulp of his cider.
“What will you do?”
Harry’s voice was so strained that it took Draco’s lust addled brain a few long moments to comprehend what he was saying. By the time he caught on and opened his eyes to watch, Harry’s own eyes were shut in delight, his lips parted around his gasps as his body locked up at the apex of one last thrust.
His mind drifted back to Potter, even as his body relaxed, which annoyed him. They hadn’t clapped eyes on each other since Draco’s trial, when he’d been seated before the Wizengamot, trying desperately not to let anyone see how badly he was shaking. Potter had come bursting into the closed chamber with Granger at his heels, and had damn near caused a riot, shouting that Draco was to be cleared immediately. Draco hadn’t had a chance to talk to him. Instead, he had been hustled off back to Azkaban, but Potter had met his eyes as the guards had hauled him from the room.
“The only place is the inn, then. I’m not bloody having you over at mine.”
“Sorry, hello. You’re one of the Aurors? Healer Malfoy mentioned you were in the village. I’m afraid I haven’t seen any strange men about, and the children would have told me if they had.”
“No one walked away from Voldemort,” Draco agreed, staring into the fire. “Even the memory of him haunts. Couldn’t truly escape or walk away. No one walked away, not then, not now. Except you.”
Thinking back on it, after another long sip, Draco didn’t know which of the two of them had been more shocked to see the other. What disquieted Draco even more had been the split second of – what had it been... Merlin, surely not pleasure? – that had shot through him, when he had clapped eyes on Potter.
The notes Harry was trying to read were basic, just what information was known on Yaxley – description, last sightings, criminal history. Harry checked over it all slowly but perfunctorily – the past didn’t matter to him these days, but it was always good to keep a firm picture of the target in mind. What was confusing him was that there was no information on the informant – whoever it was that had allegedly seen and positively identified Yaxley, then reported him to the Ministry, they were anonymous.
“Well, that’s that then,” Potter sighed. “With no new leads, the trail goes cold.”
“Show me,” Innes laid down a map on the floor before the fireplace, so his boss could see too.
“She’s alive, and has her freedom. All things considered, what more could we have hoped for? My parents picked the losing side, chose evil over good. Didn’t those shitty Muggle relatives of yours even bother to read you fairy tales? Evil never triumphs, in the end. They were always going to lose. And once they were indentured, they couldn’t get out, and so I was born into a dark dynasty on the side of the evil and hateful Death Eaters, and never had a choice.”
Night had long since descended, and he’d never admit it, but Potter being gone
Draco sighed, rubbed at his sore eyes. How was this his life? How was he standing in the village lane talking to
Why was he
“I haven’t seen him,” Draco insisted, his eyes flicking again to Potter’s partner even though he already knew he was going to see the distrust and disgust he found on the older man’s face.
Harry took it from him and peered down at the writing. It was addressed to him, in Innes’ hand.
Draco pointed to little dot of a sea-cave off the western coast. Innes and his boss exchanged a long look, and a nod, before the head disappeared without a word, the flames orange and normal once more.
for him, just… checking – about an hour ago, and had been sipping away at his cider at the bar with only Alasdair’s taciturn grunts for company ever since.
he’s still kicking around, he’s holed up on one of those little rocks.”
By midday they were tired and cold, and worst of all there was no sign of Yaxley, or any other lone magical presence on the island.
“You truly cannot expect me to stay here,” she’d said pointedly, the night they had apparated here, lip curling as she sneered at the cobwebs her wand-light illuminated.
It was Rhona who had insisted on anonymously contacting the Aurors. Draco hadn’t even known she’d done it until he’d walked into the pub to two drawn wands and Harry Potter’s stupidly attractive face and tense eyes.
“Draco and his mother were cleared of all charges. Narcissa Malfoy is the reason I’m alive,” he said loudly, directly into Innes’s ear, clenching onto his forearm all the tighter.
He simply had to.
Looking from one to the other, refusing to allow himself to give in to guilt, or shame, or fear, Draco straightened his shoulders and raised his chin.
“You seem to have managed, in the end.”
“He’s a suspect!”
“Draco, where are they?”
He apparated away with a crack that Harry was too numb to be startled by.
“You just told us to shut up,” Harry muttered under his breath, as Innes launched into a breakdown of their day, only to end it with “and then Potter got his rocks off with Malfoy.”
“Remember, apply immediately as necessary and leave it on for ten minutes, then wipe off the residue with a cold, damp cloth.”
The nettle paste he’d been working on was finally dehydrated enough to continue on with the potion he was concocting, so he added it to the cauldron along with powdered chameleon spine and essence of Belladonna, and charmed the flame to burn low for several hours, tucked away in the corner of his lab.
Sighing, Draco wandered into his bathroom and ran the bath. Summoning the wine bottle from downstairs, he had it pour a refill into his glass all on its own as he yanked his robes over his head, and sank into the warm water.
“Now that we don’t know who saw him, or when, or where, we’ll have to do a full tracking sweep of the whole island.” Potter rubbed at his forehead, over his scar. “Means you’re stuck with me a bit longer.”
There was, if anything, too many bottles of wine in the kitchen, but whatever.
! Stop having sex with Malfoy! Macgregor, stop getting on Potter’s case about having sex with Malfoy.”
“No,” Potter said calmly, shooting him a long look. “Not at all. I was just remembering how smart you were, how well you did at Hogwarts, in Potions and stuff. It seems like a great thing to do, being a Healer, but difficult. Hard work.”
, Harry thought, but didn't say.
Draco just shrugged.
authorize me moving back to London? Or to Paris, at least? I cannot
“Exactly my point! We’re here for Yaxley, and you’re wasting time sniffing after Malfoy!”
“Stay back, then. Far back.”
“Thank Merlin for alcohol, then.” Draco gratefully accepted his drink from Eileen, who’d appeared at his elbow, then paused to glance at Potter. “Another?”
“If he finds out we sent them after him… I have no idea who’s watching my Mum, what they’re capable of, how many of them there are. Potter will find him, the big hero, and bugger off back to London. Job done, and no one’s the wiser that you or I had anything to do with it.”
“Toe-rags,” the woman grumbled. She tightened her grip on her smallest child, before properly returning her attention to Harry.
He’d read it, then re-read it, stunned and sickened.
“Malfoy, were my instructions somehow unclear?” Yaxley didn’t move an inch, just ignored Harry entirely, kept his dark eyes fixed on Draco.
They all drink, then
Harry opened his mouth to retort that it wasn’t
Whatever Potter had done that day in the chamber had worked. Draco and his mother had been released the next morning, though his father would have to wait longer for his freedom. They’d fled the country immediately to the safety of their family in France. Draco had trained as a Healer in Paris for four years and had resolved to never set foot on British soil again.
“Ministry expense,” he grinned at Draco over his shoulder, even as his partner scoffed again.
“You won’t like visiting us in Adharmuir, then,” Harry pointed out, before he laughed when Narcissa made a disgusted noise.
“I beg your pardon?”
When it was complete, the potion should disguise Yaxley, obscure his physical form and allow him to come into the town unobserved.
“Oh, fuck you. Fuck you!” Draco let out a wrecked groan, his voice completely without heat.
? Reminisce about how much we hated each other?”
Innes was waiting for him, scowling over the rim of his whiskey glass, camped out on Harry’s armchair.
“Is it like that for you, being an Auror? Pour yourself into hunting down the bad guys and keeping too busy to let anyone hound you over being the Chosen One and asking for a play-by-play of all your battles against Voldemort.”
to France, and I eventually trained in Paris, when I felt it was safe to show my face to humanity again. It’s a little different than how they teach here in Britain. Being a Healer is... yes, it’s hard. But it’s what I want from life; it’s intellectually stimulating, and so exhausting some days that I don’t have the capacity to hold on to all my guilt and self-loathing. I go to work, I do my job, I go home too exhausted to think. And I help people. Heal them. It’s been a way to offer penance, in a place of salvation. This stupid little village...” he can't keep the fondness from his voice.
Narcissa wasn’t much of a cook, and didn’t have much of an appetite for anything not in liquid form, but she was at least making attempts to keep Draco fed.
Taking a breath, staring down into his half-full glass, Draco shook his head before he carried on.
“It was,” Draco was stubborn, as stubborn as Innes. As stubborn as Harry. “It was. I can’t just... I can’t just let you go, not now, not after all this time, after everything. I can’t just let you run head-long into trouble!”
“Alone?”
and hadn't stopped him and saved us? The bullshit I used to spout, the disgusting beliefs I was raised to think were normal... the conversations I had, the things I did or turned a blind eye to... when it’s all you ever knew, it takes a long time to completely break away, even though you know it’s wrong.”
“How good of him, Mrs. Campbell. And I'm sure he'll be happy to have it, it looks very warm,” Harry smiled over his tea-cup, and took another huge bite of scone.
Harry’s breath left his lungs on the back of a gasp as he took the sight of the other young man in.
Innes gave him the finger as they walked down opposite sides of the lane to the first houses on the inland side of the village, which looked roughly identical to each other, with white pebble-dash walls and thatched roofs.
Malfoy. Healer Malfoy is not under suspicion in any way. We’re not here to do anything other than find Yaxley. Healer Malfoy was cleared of all charges five years ago, and as far as I’m concerned that’s the end of the matter.” Harry glowered at Innes as he spoke, who sneered right back at him.
Potter had also acted to calm the situation, in lieu of just blindly backing his partner.
Banging from the mouth of the cave indicated the apparition of his reinforcements, and Harry only let Innes go when Gawain eased his fingers free.
him and I
“What’s the matter with you!” Harry snapped, sick of him and his attitude.
The curse had caught Potter in the side, but the damage wasn’t anything Draco couldn’t heal. Still, his hands shook a little as he prepared the potions to clean the gash, stave off infection, and repair his patient’s body. He applied them far too liberally, one after the other, but it was better to be safe than sorry. Then he dosed Potter with a draught to make sure he slept through the night without waking, and left him to rest and heal.
“Do you want to get a drink?” Potter called after him, and Draco turned back with a raised eyebrow.
The tide was out enough that they crossed the shallow channel between the little island and the mainland easily on foot. The single cave was dark and dank, wet and foreboding.
Whatever the weird tug of a feeling had been within Draco, it had quickly been chased away by suspicion over the presence of the Aurors, and anger that Potter’s partner had denounced Draco in front of the whole village, no doubt damaging the respectable name he’d worked so hard to make for himself the past few years. It was grating. Draco worked his ass off for his village and the neighbouring communities, and then some stranger comes charging into
“What happened?” He went straight into Healer mode, dropping down next to Potter and checking his airway before he cast the charm to keep his breathing even. Potter’s robes were red-stained with blood, a gash on his side the source.
“Who called it in? There’s your answer, boy,” Innes said through gritted teeth, wand sure and steady and pointing at the chest of Draco Malfoy.
Already he was annoyed with this case. Chasing a man who may or may not be here, with
Harry decided to be on his way when the toddler sneezed, and the resulting little flames nearly singed the photo entirely.
Harry groused to himself, as the wind blew him back down the village road towards the warm lights of the pub.
“No,” Potter agreed. “I don’t want to drink without eating, though. And I’m shattered, I need the energy.”
Then his fingers twitched as they curled tight around Draco’s, and the hottest noise Draco had ever heard was the sweet, whimpered cry that tore from the man draped over him.
“Nope.”
“I don’t think fairy tales are all that accurate a representation of the way things blur,” Potter murmured, his smile wry. “Voldemort’s supporters, from what I witnessed first-hand, were scared. Few were truly evil. Just frightened and in too deep, just trying to protect their loved ones. Same as you. Merlin, same as
She’d never apologise for her manner, or her ways, nor thank him for coming to her rescue.
Harry pressed his lips together, but resolved not to interject again. He was reasonably certain that Oliver Wood, whom Harry had bumped into the previous weekend in Diagon Alley, was the reason Marcus Flint had been in a good mood and in such great form lately. But loyalty to his old Captain’s privacy kept Harry’s mouth shut. Not that Flint had tried very hard to be discreet; his hand had certainly found its way into Wood’s back pocket when he’d joined them in the street easily enough.
“I heard Granger is shaking things up at the Ministry?” Draco let Potter prattle on about how proud he was of Granger and her work at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and how great he found it sharing an office with Weasley, even though they weren’t partners.
Probably.
He’d considered charming his way into Malfoy’s bed. A good, quick fuck might be just the thing to get this developing (returning) obsession out of his system.
“I’ll Floo.”
“OK,” she brightened up at the suggestion, and followed him inside.
“What we
Draco’s face fell, but Harry had known all along, since the second he woke up, that if Innes wasn’t with him it was because he’d gone for Yaxley. He was already shoving back the thick blanket to get up.
Having finished his houses before the little strip of shops in the centre of the village, Harry headed into the general store.
“Harry, I’m sorry. I had to. My mum... he said... if I didn’t hide him, he’d send people after my mum! He knew where she lives!”
Harry made a show of looking around him. “Is he here?”
When Harry glanced over at him, Draco wouldn’t meet his eyes.
But as they sat down together for fish baked in herbs and lemon, paired with a sweet white wine, there was a sense of gratitude between them.
“He wrote you one before every mission, in case something happened. I do the same for Weasley.”
Harry’s was saved from having to speak by the arrival of Dawlish, Ron’s partner.
remade himself.
“Yes, sure. Any, either, both.”
Then he was falling forward out of a different fireplace a few moments later, stumbling onto grey slate flagstones, coughing and covered in ash, his wand raised defensively across his chest.
“I don’t know,” Harry replied, his brain turning over the information he’d just been told.
His room was fine enough – a double bed, a writing desk under the window, an armchair before the fireplace, and a small en-suite bathroom adjoining. Harry tossed his files onto the desk and dropped down into the armchair, rubbing at his aching eyes. Fucking floo. Fucking Innes.
Harry just smiled.
“In the end,” Harry agreed, before Draco kissed him again, all his need and hunger rising up in
“Yes?“ the woman murmured distractedly to him, as she tried to shoo her daughter back inside.
The village of Senaide was as nondescript as France could achieve; their safehouse wasn’t as grand as Narcissa was used to, and she wouldn’t stop letting Draco know it.
Harry probably shouldn’t have kissed him.
Canvassing was more straight-forward after that. Not one single person had ever laid eyes on Yaxley, or any other stranger recently, except for Harry and Innes.
Harry nodded, reluctantly picked up the second dram he’d been poured, and headed over to a table by the window with their case files. He still felt a bit woozy from the floo and he dropped onto the plush armchair gratefully.
“Rooms are upstairs,” the barkeep called out to him. Innes was already drinking his scotch. “Second landing up, the two opposite each other. When you get back down, you’s can have your dram.”
Almost a week later, and Draco had managed to bring some semblance of order and tidiness to the house. It wasn’t small by any means, so he and his mother quite happily occupied separate wings and usually only saw each other for meals.
“Well, we lay the past to bed now,” Potter pushed away from the wall, and took a step down the path, before he glanced back. “Right?”
“Cider? That sounds dreadful. I shall bring my own wine.”
The anticipation, almost a decade worth of it, had Draco’s blood boiling, his voice shaking, and his movements lacked anything even remotely akin to finesse. Potter was just as bad, prepping Draco with trembling fingers, his eyes dark with need as he watched him whimper and wriggle.
She nodded once, curt, and produced from her pocket a scrap of parchment.
He readd the letter that night in his tiny living room, after building himself up to it all day, with a glass of whiskey in one hand and a fire roaring in the grate.
“There.”
“I haven’t seen him, but I figured out yesterday where he is. A hippocampus lair. Let me show you the way.”
better now. Or trying to be, at least. So is my mother.”
“You know what I mean!”
They were interrupted by the arrival of their food – more scotch, and a plate of haggis, neeps and tatties for Innes, who tucked into it with such gusto that Harry tried not to stare. He instead took a long sip of his own scotch and speared a green bean absently with his fork. His salmon looked temptingly well-cooked, but he wanted to finish processing what he was thinking out loud before he got too distracted by his food, or his throbbing head.
! Tell me there’s some sort of result.”
The kiss alone was a risk. To attempt for more would be asking for trouble, pure and simple. Besides, Draco made his feelings clear. Harry’s own feelings were another matter.
“I’m a Healer. I took an oath too, to preserve life, if I am able. If Innes is in trouble, or you get into trouble...”
When Harry eventually managed to go back to the Ministry, he purposefully got to the office early in order to avoid too many stares. Or worse, condolences.
His reaction startled Harry – it didn't feel good to see shock and a tinge of fear in Draco's eyes as he looked at him.
No more Voldemort meant freedom for Draco Malfoy, too.
Draining his glass and rubbing at his sore eyes, he decided not to stay up long. Tomorrow was Saturday, meaning his practice was only open for a few hours from late morning to early afternoon. He was already looking forward to an early night and a good lie in tomorrow, as pathetic as it sounded for a 24-year-old man on a Friday evening.
“Did he not know the way? Damn confusing, only one village lane after all.”
started to show them her parchment, which was full of lists of things such as flowers, music, and a prospective guest-list.
Draco let her go without a fuss, and once Harry had finally crossed the distance between them to kiss him fiercely, he wrapped his arms around his waist and couldn’t bring himself to let go for quite some time.
Harry sighed, sensing what was coming. “We can’t cast the charms from here?”
“Potter,” Harry got a clap around the shoulder. “Are you coping?”
“You do?” Ron looked surprised and touched, exactly how Harry felt but couldn’t express.
“Potter won’t be happy.”
“Don’t go,” Draco begged, clutching at Harry’s shoulders, fingers digging practically down to the bone. “Don’t. Just... stay. Stay here. Stay with me. Let Innes handle it. You’ve done enough, for fuck’s sake; how have you not done enough?! You defeated Voldemort, you saved the world. You’ve done
“Engaged,” Potter murmured, finally perking up a bit. “She got sick of waiting for him to ask, so she proposed a few weeks ago.”
By the time Harry was back in the centre of the village to meet his partner, he was stuffed to the brim with baked goods that had been offered by most of the village-folk. It seemed to be the way of things – he was invited in almost everywhere he called on, and was promptly sat down and plied with coffee, tea, cakes, biscuits, slice… He’d polished off three of Mrs. Campbell’s fresh scones with jam and cream despite her, too, never having any recollection of seeing Yaxley.
Her mouth fell open, and someone else in the room audibly gasped. They were all staring again. Realizing there was now nothing else for it, Harry cleared his throat. Bloody Innes.
“Keep away from Draco!”
about Draco ruddy Malfoy and get out there and do your jobs, before I floo in and kick you both door to door on your arses!”
Which was exactly when Draco shouldered his way outside, shaking off a little girl who was clutching at his steel-grey robes. He came to a halt, eyes wide in surprise, with his chest mere millimetres from Harry’s outstretched hand. Harry could feel the warmth from the bare skin of Draco’s throat on the tips of his fingers as it emanated from him.
“Will they find him?” Rhona whispered, her eyes darting about the four corners of the garden, as if expecting to see Yaxley manifest next to Draco’s compost heap.
Turning back to the files, Harry perused his notes, his headache not abating as he slowly sipped at his scotch and ignored Innes’s loudly grumbled insults at his taking his time. The room around them filled up steadily with villagers as night began to descend, people coming in for drinks, a meal, or simply to gossip.
grievous injury that I’d be bound by oath to attend to, and I’ll be a happy man.”
Harry coughed out a laugh, which hurt.
“I guess so,” Potter allowed, as they stopped at Draco’s door. “We always were kind of similar, you and I. It certainly feels good to choose for myself, to dictate on my own terms how my life plays out.”
“Caught him yet?” he asked Potter, just to be a bit of an asshole.
Harry and Innes kept clear of the Muggles, focused on casting their detection and tracking charms.
Harry sighed as he shouldered his bag and led the way to the other end of the office, grabbed a handful of floo powder from the table by the damn fireplace, and climbed into it. You didn’t argue with Gawain, not even when the man was in a good mood. Harry shot his boss one last insolent scowl for good measure, then called out the name of the village inn that was his intended destination, gripping his bag tightly as the flames flared around him.
“Out there? Is that possible? Is there shelter?”
“I walked him home, Innes. That’s it.”
“Go after him,” Innes muttered, standing with a grunt and pulling on his cloak.
Harry and Innes were outside moments later, with Harry rushing to take the side of the street that contained Malfoy’s medical practice before Innes could cross the road.
“If you insist,” Draco sniffed, as if he didn’t care either way.
Several hippocampi nested on the craggy, rocky islands just off the mainland, but they’d never bothered the humans on Iona too badly.
“How do we know he’s not a
“They have a nice citrus cider,” Draco tried to placate, but she shook her head.
Harry couldn’t look up from his mentor, and Draco’s words dropped into his ears like rain, ineffectual and cold.
Innes nodded curtly. “He surprised us. It was chase after him, or protect the lad. I have to report to my superior. Help him, please. But don’t Floo him anywhere unless you want him to throw up, even unconscious. He hates Floo.”
All this time in the wizarding world and Harry still hated the feeling of floo; the lack of control as he spun and the crippling nausea and dizziness it induced. Not being able to have his full faculties about him when whatever fireplace he was using spat him out at what may or may not be his intended destination…
“Only three people stood up to defend him tonight.”
“I just thought...”
“I don’t know. I hope so. If anyone can, it’s Potter.”
Harry sighed and waved him out of the room. It was late now, and dark. From this high up he could see both up and down the street. Some of the cottages were lit up inside, while others were dark with absence.
She didn’t speak, just gazed at him with anxious eyes.
He was still procrastinating, watching the white waves rolling in the distance, when Draco threw the door open and barrelled straight into Harry’s chest. The slightly taller man yelped and leaped back like he’d been burnt before Harry could even react; his medical bag held out between them as if to ward Harry off.
The bang of the door flying open startled Draco so badly that he almost leapt clean off his stool at the pub.
“Mother! Wait!” Draco hissed, fumbling for his own wand.
? Just go in, ask the questions, same as all the other house-calls. But Malfoy wasn’t the same as all the other villagers. Harry couldn’t just treat him the same as all the other villagers, there was too much... history, too much familiarity, too much resentment, too much emotion. Harry didn’t feel the same about him, that was for sure, if his thumping heartbeat was anything to go by.
“If you like.” Draco ignored the way his heart skipped a few beats at the possibility of more time with Potter. They both ignored the scoff from the bar as Potter beat Draco to the till to pay.
“Let me tell you what I know. A hippocampus has been far too close to the island the past few days. Driven from his lair, I suspect.”
“Absolutely nothing else,” Draco agreed. “Just don’t take too long to find him. This isn’t an invitation to bloody move here.”
Potter stared at him like he’d grown a second head, but Draco stood by his reaction. Who
“Stop talking!” One of his eyelid’s was peeled back by cold fingers so a wand light could be shone directly into his pupil; Harry flinched away.
“Thank you. What can you tell me about Malfoy?” Harry asked her as she set down the tray on the desk, the question coming out completely unbidden.
