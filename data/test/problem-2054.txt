“Remember what happened the last time you said you were fine?” Qye had muttered and Harry had cracked his eyes open just enough to glower at him.
Hermione looked up at him, frowning slightly. “After you started screaming, Lest - ” she stumbled slightly over the name and Harry raised an eyebrow at its usage “ - came over to help and you just grabbed him.” She sniffed. “People started gossiping immediately afterwards, with you all in pain and everything and - ”
Qye replied blandly, taking a moment to look through his eyes before returning to his reading of Harry's memories. For some reason, he seemed to invade his privacy more than usual now, muttering something about "bloody insightful old men" and "shameful ignorance" whenever Harry begged him not to.
A strong, powerful voice broke through the crowd and the faces began to diminish. Harry watched dully as a familiar aged face appeared above him.
The redhead glowered at her, viciously stabbing a piece of sausage.  “The greasy git would deserve it,” he growled, taking a fierce bite out of the piece of meat on his fork.  “Honestly!” he said suddenly, throwing down his fork and glaring at it.  “Who the hell gives a
“Shut up, boy!” Saira snapped from across Jordan, glaring at Jacob.  “Don’t talk about things you don’t know!”  Jacob glowered at her but thankfully stayed silent.
And, instead of glaring or making a rude suggestion for the Slytherin to leave, Ron had simply turned back to his conversation.
Opacre. I’ve had to go through several training programs in order to deal with anything that comes my way and it often does. My spells can
“Did you have a nice trip?” she questioned, moving back after he hugged her back.  She looped her arm through his, leading him to the carriage waiting outside the station.
“That’ll be fixed when he is, won’t it?” Lest said coldly and Qye stilled.  “We merge the two and - ”
“And that’s supposed to cheer him up how?” Hermione retorted, standing up from her seat and fluffing up his pillows, causing Harry to smile slightly at her motherly attitude. “You know Professor Snape won’t be sympathetic to Harry and will just give him more make-up work.”
“We understand how you must be feeling,” he heard the sister say carefully and Sirius closed his eyes again as he buried the palms of his hands into his eyes, digging them in as if to push away the image of too thin bodies that Smethwyck reassuringly said were far better than they had been days ago.  “It…it’s a lot to take in, not only what has happened with Harry but what he means to us as well.”
:: Qye said, puzzled but Harry didn’t say anything, smiling at the candies and piled up get-well cards.
The worry faded slightly from Hermione, replaced with a disapproving frown.  Ron just grinned, albeit a bit weakly.  He grinned back, turning his back on them and leaving the Great Hall at the same moment a tawny owl dropped the latest Daily Prophet on Hermione’s lap.  He was already halfway down the hall when his bushy-haired friend managed to make a sound about the heading on the front page of the Prophet.
Another flick of her hand and Sprout grunted as she was forced from Neville, who struggled against an invisible force.
“Hey, Harry,” she laughed, her eyes twinkling.  “Having problems training your boy?  I can give you a few pointers if you’d like.”  She laughed again when Malfoy snarled.
Beside him, the pale boy growled, dropping his wrist.  He glanced up and saw the other boy drop the shredded leaves into his potion.
With Professor Opacre's solemn words, the following duels were focused and grimly determined. Each contestant stepped forward, in their eyes a look saying they didn't want to lose against the vampire, determined to at least break even with Lest. Yet they all seemed to end the same way.
“I’ll give second chances when I think it’s justified,” Harry countered quickly, eyeing the bitter look on the other boy’s face.  “You still haven’t given me a reason to give you one.”
She turned to the vampire she knew would struggle with this, meeting his turbulent eyes unflinchingly.
“Harry!” Qye cried, shock pushing away his anger and whirled around to see Harry on his knees, swaying.  He awkwardly wrapped an arm around Harry’s middle, effortlessly hoisting him up on wobbly legs.
Therefore, he was quite surprised when the first time he lagged behind, the pale boy had merely pulled out a book and begun reading.  He remembered staring at the Slytherin, his mouth hanging open, until the silver-haired boy had looked up from reading and raised an eyebrow at him.  He remembered flushing and turning back to his work while the other boy had smirked and shake his head slightly before returning to his book.
:: he asked the other boy wearily, raising his eyes to the crowd once more.  He stopped rubbing his hands together, giving up on the idea of getting them warm.  Instead, he bundled himself up in his coat and robes, burrowing his face in his scarf.
Before Harry could question that noncommittal response, Lest's voice brought him back to the duel and his green eyes flashed back to the vampire, hand tight on his wand. The duel was over the minute he lost his wand so he couldn't afford to slip on it.
“What’s going on here?” a new voice drawled behind them and Harry flushed slightly as he recognized it.  Swallowing slightly, he turned around to see Malfoy - ::
- only to be thrown against the wall with enough force to make him grunt.  He heard two other thumps and cries and he opened his eyes to see Petunia and Dudley on either side of him.  The crash against the wall had enough force to rattle some pictures and he heard a couple of frames fall to the floor with a crash.
“Likewise, Malfoy,” Lest hissed, stepping away from the table and folding his arms, his own winter eyes flashing darkly at the other blond.  “I was under the impression that this school was for students, not little mommy’s boys.”  The vampire sneered as Malfoy’s jaw clenched.  “Haven’t seen you in a while.  Can’t say I’ve missed you, though.”
:: Harry had replied, doubtful.  He had picked out the book with the recipe for the potion and stared at it wearily.  ::
Glancing at her brother, she clicked her tongue in exasperation as she saw the reason for their terror. Lest had lowered his hand as well but the fiercely burning look he was giving them was far from comforting.
"It's called the Mind Delving potion," he said, walking to the front of his desk.  "The potion separates one's subconscious from their conscious in a more definite manner, allowing the drinker to delve and search their subconscious.  It's sometimes used to understand oneself more clearly," he said, his mouth twisting slightly in derision and his black eyes full of contempt.   "Some Healers give this to mental patients to help them discover answers to their problems but because the subconscious is full of surprises, it's closely regulated.
“Rat,” Qye muttered, rolling his shoulders as he shifted his position on the bed to more favorably support his neck lounging on the edge of it.  “And I said the vase was a mistake.”
His thoughts were interrupted suddenly as a hand was dropped on his shoulder.  Startled, he looked up from his notes to see a pale McGonagall standing behind him.  Beside him, Ron and Hermione’s bickering slowly trailed off.
He woke to the screams of betrayal, the roars to stay away from Qye, the anger and grief flooding his head even as he couldn’t open his eyes.
There was a moment of nothing, followed by another and then an even longer one where he felt no different, felt Qye still and silent and separate in his mind.  The moments stretched so long that he could feel his disappointment growing, feel Qye’s frustration and desperation.
Ron watched one join another, and another before it finally slid off the end of the window sill and plummeted to the wet ground.
“I got them, Callie!” snapped the man as he straightened and stalked towards them.  Ron immediately averted his eyes and started shifting his feet as he backed away.
Harry jerked, drawn back from his memory.  Flushing slightly, he kept his eyes firmly on the tabletop, forcing his blush away.
“Present,” the young Malfoy heir said contemptuously, his gray eyes flashing darkly.  Marylin took in a deep breath and exhaled slowly.  She shot the pale boy a look that clearly told him to not push his limits but he just sneered.   Marylin sighed again and shook her head, thinking, ‘
Draco merely continued to smirk.  Gray eyes quickly scanned around and Harry was once again unsettled at how easily his Housemates left him alone.  Ron didn’t even say anything as he moved away, trying to awkwardly work his way to Hermione.
“And you’re looking for reasons to support the decision that we’re broken and need to be fixed, right,” Qye said bitterly, his hands curling into fists atop the armrests.
“Leon Hastai,” he said quietly, his bull voice rumbling softly.  “Representative of the Hastai family of vampires from Europe, which is the head of the middle-caste class.  Head of the Hastai family of vampires, along with my wife Margaret who could not attend because of her fever.”  He sent an apologetic look to the Head of the Opacres but Jordan’s cousin just waved his hand, indifferent.  “Loyal to the Opacre family of vampires and on the side of the Opacres,” he finished and sat down.
“Healer Smethwyck is here at my request due to Harry’s documented magical exhaustion,” Wainscott calmly said, moving her gaze to Harry, who was looking out one of the windows.  Harry didn’t turn around at her comment and Qye felt a quick surge of satisfaction at the sight of his reticence.  “He’s the most qualified to manage any of the physical symptoms which leaves me free to talk without diverting my attention to treatment I am not prepared for.  Of course, I can always ask him to leave if you would like.  He would still be privy to any notes I write afterwards but he would not be present for our actual conversation if you would prefer.”
Harder still when, despite being calm himself, he would suddenly find himself in a wave of rage and loss from Qye.
Heads up to all those who have enjoyed the daily posting, I will now be posting about every three days to possibly once a week on the weekends.  I want to make sure I have time to review the chapters and also, real life commitments and holidays.  Also, to provide sympathy to those readers who have waited literal years for these chapters. XD  Thank you all for continuing to read, leave comments and kudos!  I adore you all.
He doesn’t remember passing the unconscious vampire by the doorway or making his way back to Harry’s side and looking down at him, lying asleep and ignorant of the fact that the vampire Qye had been defending the entire time was the reason they were in this state.
“Dumbledore mentioned in his letter that there was a vacant teaching position at Hogwarts,” he said coolly.  “Defense Against the Dark Arts.  He said that no one seemed to want to take the job and if I knew anyone, he would be more than happy to take them on.  He obviously wants me to suggest a vampire for the job, I suppose his way of ‘helping’ fight against the ‘injustices’ done against us.”
“At the end of the day, let’s make this clear,” Jonas said and Libby appreciated the blunt manner he used to approach this.  “We have no history of anything like this happening before.  Both Ms. Nilsson and I have tested them in every manner available to us.  I’ve personally observed them touch and interact with one another all week, and at no point was there even the slightest opening to even begin to fathom how to merge them together.  Short of binding them and throwing them in the Janus Thickley ward for the rest of their lives, there’s nothing we can do.”  He glanced at the door and grimaced.  “Honestly, with their potential and stubbornness, I doubt that would hold them long either,” he muttered.
As he passed one of the dressers, he started having difficulty taking in a breath, and he stumbled towards it and gripped it tight with shaking hands.
“I will,” Harry said quietly and she nodded in satisfaction.  Just before he left, she called after him and he turned back, looking curiously at her.
“You know,” she started hesitantly, Lest turning his eyes back to her, “Harry and his friends didn’t seem too frightened by you.”
“Ron’s right, Harry’s probably back at the Tower right now,” Hermione said in a too-bright tone, tugging the older woman away from the lake. “We should really go back, the longer he’s away from the Infirmary, the sicker he’ll get, so shouldn’t we really go?”
“Professor Opacre?” he asked.  She hummed as she pulled back the bangs from his face, smoothing them with the liquid that faintly smelled of almonds.  “You said you used to do something like this before?”
“Because you need to learn to shut up,” he muttered back, ignoring the scowl his twin sent him.  Instead, he leaned forward and looked at his cousin who was looking at Marylin.  “Cousin?”  They both turned to look at him, expressions extremely neutral.  He met their blank expressions evenly and asked quietly, “What are we going to do?”
“As for being young,” she continued, smiling slightly, “Well, after a certain age we begin to age much slower.  However,” she sighed, “that age is one hundred and by then, you’re already into wrinkles so what does it matter if it takes you longer to get another one?  In our first hundred years, we age just like any other mortal so…” She looked around the class.  “Does that clear up the answer on how vampires age?  Yes?  Good.  Next question.”
“Really,” he tried to smile at them, a wince from a painful stab breaking it. He rubbed his forehead again. “Really, I’m f - ”
Sirius sat with his head in his hands as Healer Smethwyck recited the most recent updates on his godson’s condition.
"Now then, vampires typically engage in hand to hand combat so most are typically well versed in at least one fighting style, if at least just refined punching, kicking and dodging. But as you're wizards - and I doubt very many of you know such things, not to mention what the school would do to me if one of you broke something by just flailing wildly - you will deal with long distance duels, at least ten feet.
Their reluctance turned to surprise, then curiosity as they saw tethered horses near the edge of the forest.  There were about fifteen of them, different colors and breeds.  But it was clear what they were with their wings.
She stopped in front of him, still smiling, but now he saw the tension in her shoulders, the wary consideration in her bright blue eyes.
The elderly nurse raised herself to her full height – coming several inches short of Lest’s shoulders – and gave the vampire an icy glare. “I have been working at Hogwarts longer than you have lived on this planet,
“Do you agree, Saira?” his cousin asked quietly, voice cold as winter.  Saira sighed and nodded grudgingly.  It was quiet once more and then an absent voice called from next to the fire.
Harry sighed and nodded, knowing better than to argue with the Head Nurse about her patient’s health. She nodded satisfactorily.
He kept repeating it as she hugged him and Ron tightened his grip on his shoulder, his blue eyes meeting her brown eyes in concern.
Harry said nothing as he began to stir his potion slowly, his eyes downcast. He heard the blond let out an irritated growl beside him as added the almoss root, making the potion darker, though not as dark as Malfoy’s.
“I think we should just be grateful they’ve finally gotten some sense,” Hermione interrupted.  “And Harry has the right to look however he wants.  You look very nice tonight, by the way,” she added to a Harry who flushed even more and fiddled with the bracelet he wore.
Qye swallowed back bile and sobs and held onto his fury and threw himself at Lest, howling as he slashed down with all his strength, “
“Open to suggestions here,” Blaise Zabini muttered as he cast a shimmering spell across the corridor and forcing the vampires back again.  The first vampires that had crossed it had immediately lost their focus and began attacking their comrades before they had shaken out of it a few minutes later.  They had since been wary every time he cast it and it gave them all a brief moment of rest as they sent injured and exhausted back to the defended group and regained their strength.  His face was strained and he swayed on his feet.  “I think I’ve only got one or two more of Mother’s dazzlers before I’m done.  And unless Granger’s managed to dig her way through that wall, I think we’re truly and well fucked here.”
“Well, the last DADA professors weren’t exactly - ” Seamus cut off with a pained yelp and Harry glanced up for a moment to see Ron glaring at the sandy-haired boy, moving slightly in his seat to show that he had been the one to kick.  He saw the redhead jerk his head toward him and Seamus look slightly abashed.  Harry lowered his eyes again.
She paused, blue eyes quietly gazing down at her collection as she straightened her battered wizarding rook. Her mind flashed back to the duel between Ron and Lest and she bit her lip as she remembered those shifting feet and obvious lack of eye contact. She knew Draco and Ron weren't even the most civil of schoolmates but as she watched that duel she silently thought about how much the two might actually have in common. If she had known, she wouldn't have let the Weasley boy fight perhaps. At least it hadn't been as it could've been, say with Draco fighting.
“Did your brother leave already?” he asked softly, his green eyes looking curiously up at her as he cut his last two ingredients.
Harry frowned as he added the bettle fly wings to his potion, raising a hand to cover his mouth as he coughed. ::
They had walked through the hallway and Harry had hissed in pain as Qye’s fingers tightened when he heard Lest try to make another decision about their fucking life.
Marylin sighed heavily and picked up her fork.  He saw her glance over again at the Headmaster, frowning slightly.  “I wonder what has them - ”
Harry shrugged, grinning and hoping his nervousness didn’t show through.  “They’ve worked this far.  I’ll see you in a bit.”
“So we are in agreement,” Wainscott said, unruffled, raising her wand and waving it lightly.  Qye glanced over as he heard Sirius hiss, saw the man staring angrily at the Mind-Healer, rubbing at his throat.  “Forgive me, Mr. Black, I felt it best to let that argument run its course.”  She raised a hand, stalling his argument.  “We can discuss it later but for now, let me make sure Qye and Harry understand the full recommendation.”
Harry thought as he stared out the window of the Infirmary as the late afternoon sunlight glittered on the lake.
“Please come to the dance with me,” Draco repeated softly.  “I don’t know how to do this.  I don’t know how to make this easier.  I’ll most likely still be an ass because we’ve been at each other’s throats since the beginning and that’s hardly changed some days.  But there have been days where it
Draco smirked at him. Harry felt his own lips twitch in response. Before anything more could be said - especially about the other night - Harry heard one of his friends calling out to him. He glanced at them and back at Draco, flushing and feeling awkward again.
acting strange?” Harry replied in an incredulous voice.  “Maybe you should start taking a look at yourself before accusing other people of being weird.”
"Um," she said, blinking. Harry flushed as he realized she must've seen if not heard Ron's little intimidation. '
“Potter…Harry,” he began softly and Harry’s eyes widened in shock at the use of his first name.  Malfoy tightened his hold on Harry’s hand slightly and a flash of unsureness swept through his gray eyes.  He opened his mouth again.
“I’m sorry,” she said ruefully, her blue eyes flashing with weariness and irritation.  “He’s a bit…well, he’s a bit odd sometimes.  He’s not always like this.  I hope he didn’t bother you too much, Harry.”
“We had a talk, struck a deal to ignore each other until the other ceases to exist,” Ron said shortly.  “It’s like you said, Hermione.  It’s not worth it.”
The vampire broke his stare and turned to his sister with a mild face. She lifted an eyebrow and he shrugged. Clicking her tongue in exasperation, Professor Opacre turned back to the class and ruefully shook her head.
“Does that answer your question if I’m going to ‘bite’ you, Mr. Finnegan?” she asked the Irish boy who was one of the ones laughing.  The sandy-haired boy grinned and nodded, snickering even though Dean Thomas half-heartedly punched him in the shoulder.  He just laughed again.
so advanced and wired differently to work on these abilities, it'll be harder for such spells to effectively penetrate and work properly. Therefore, I'd advise against using such spells."
Scowling, Qye remembered the stupid acorn flung back at him, remembered it hitting the tree barely an inch away from his face, remembered being startled and losing his balance, remembered falling out of the tree, his last lone thought being ‘
“I hope he isn’t asking you to teach again!” she sniffed.  “After all this nonsense this year, we hardly need you -”
“Well,” she finally said, raising an eyebrow.  “Don’t any of you have any questions you want to ask me?”
“No, you’re just giving me a headache looking at you like that,” Smethwyck grumbled, dropping his hand and giving him a pleading look.
“I’m a medical professional,” he shrugged as he watched her glance down at the file, not even raising an eye at the label ‘
Harry looked at the swirling potion, still slowly spinning the feather in his hand.  He thought briefly of the journal entries he read and the things Qye didn’t say.
"For the love of Merlin," Zabini growled, hazel eyes snapping over to them. "Look, it's nothing personal, Weasley! It'll just make things easier if
,’ a voice hissed through the thrumming sound in his head – and it filled the gaps that haunted him for so long.  His mind echoed loud and hollow as he slowly backed from the dresser, his hand curled around a wooden hairbrush left atop the dresser and a discarded potion bottle.  He grabbed the back of a chair and silently dragged it across the room, right between the beds, angling it to face the slumbering teenager as he sat slowly and stretched his legs out, staring blankly at Harry.
“I heard,” Harry whispered and Qye squeezed his eyes shut, tears slipping free and he felt Lest shake where he still grasped Qye weakly around the wrists.  “I know.”  The arms tightened around his shoulders and Qye felt them pull him back, closer to Harry’s heartbeat, his wrists slipping from Lest’s limp hold as they stood up and away.  “He’s not worth you doing this.”
"Your potion should be complete by now," Snape snapped, looking around the classroom.  "If it isn't, it won't work and your incompetence has shown.  You've failed for the day."  Behind him, Harry heard Neville let out a sigh.
His head jerked up in time to see something horribly familiar bounding towards him, his eyes widening as he recognized it from a vision not so long ago, the twisted face and bloody mouth.
“They are to monitor their well-being,” she said.  “I recommended daily sessions to start off with but I anticipate fading those to every other day and then weekly eventually if I see progress.  I also recommended myself, as I am already familiar with the case and bound by the secrecy spell, but if you would like another individual, I can provide solid and confidential references.”
His sigh alerted Hermione and she immediately stopped in mid-rant at Ron to look concernedly at him.  “Harry, are you alright?” she asked anxiously, leaning across the table towards him.  Beside her, Ron rolled his eyes.
“The Dursleys were bad,” Qye finally said, looking away from Harry, no longer glaring at the wall but not meeting their eyes, shrugging stiffly.  “Doesn’t matter, it’s not like we’re going back to them anyway.”
His heart clenched and throat tightened when he encountered that cool, distant expression he had never seen before.
He heard the other boy let out a long sigh.  “Yes, Potter,” Malfoy said slowly and exasperatedly, “There’s a difference.  Simionwert is a plant from the Amazon, with more moisture than simeonwert.  In the potion, it’s used to help regenerate blood so the drinker recovers from blood loss faster.  Simeonwert, on the other hand, is a plant from the Sahara and therefore has less moisture than simionwert.  If you put
The vampire laughed softly and Harry felt a cool hand push his own hands away from his face.  He determinedly kept his eyes on the table, still blushing fiercely, and the vampire chuckled again.  A slender hand tilted his head up and Harry reluctantly raised his eyes to meet amused ones.
Blue eyes.  Bright blue eyes.  Blue eyes that laughed with him.  Sky blue eyes that seemed to tease him with something.  Blue eyes that loved him.  Baby blue eyes that were soft and comforting, like a sister. Blue eyes that seemed like something from the past.
“Qye had an incredibly high level of maturity and understanding,” Marylin urged, hands folded together.  “And with the bonding, we weren’t as limited in our ways of how to help him in his situation.  Please, we just wanted what was best for him, truly.”  Her eyes looked at them pleadingly while Lest sat by, silent and undisturbed.
“He did this, Harry,” Qye said hoarsely, gritting his teeth and looking away from Lest’s confused eyes and staring at his throat, where he remembered Lest told him so long ago to aim to kill.  “He’s the vampire who put me away and the reason we - ”
Hermione hesitated.  “Well…it’s been used as a last resort treatment for those with retrograde amnesia and found to be particularly effective for those without magical causes but rather physical or - ”
As Lest stumbled off, Professor Opacre cheerfully plopped down and turned twinkling eyes onto the fury encompassed ones of her brother.
Harry thought, terrified as he struggled against them. There were so many and as he began to resist, they seemed to constrict, growing even more determined to not let him go and his fear grew as that terror brushed against his mind. ‘
He heard Dean say, “I would think you would be more worried about our new professor than our old friend.”  Harry looked at them and saw them glance at the vampire professor, who was calmly talking with the Muggle Studies witch.
The potion.  Now there was another matter altogether.  Harry dropped his eyes to the floor, still rubbing his hands together.  The first chance he had after leaving the Infirmary, he had sped straight to the Library and to the section on subconscious potions and…nothing.  Absolutely nothing that could have caused Qye to suddenly pop into his head.  The other boy had suggested looking at the ingredients.
The minute their afternoon classes ended, Ron and Hermione had raced immediately to the Infirmary. They had been unable to visit Harry during the morning, been denied at lunch and now that they had finally managed to find time to see him they found Harry had disappeared.
“I can’t believe I’m saying this,” Draco muttered in Harry’s ear, “but should we take a cue from Weasley?”
“Dunno,” he mumbled.  “I guess I read it in a book somewhere.”  Then he ate his spoonful of vegetables, once again not tasting them.  The silence continued for a moment and he could feel their stares on him, confused and wary stares.  He refused to raise his eyes to meet them though.
.’  Still, she couldn’t help but wonder how her younger brother – or the families – would react to having a wizard in a vampire family.
“Good, that means you can go to the Infirmary soon,” Granger said briskly, her voice suddenly business-like. Qye glowered slightly at her, relieved when she didn’t seem startled by his annoyance.
“What are you on about, Finnegan?” Ron frowned as the sixth-year Gryffindors headed up to the Defense Against the Dark Arts room for their last class of the day. Harry kept half an ear on the conversation as he listened to Hermione highlight the notes of the days he had missed last week. It had been a week of study so he didn’t have to worry about it too much, having read the assignments that Hermione had brought over on the weekend. However, Professor Opacre always added more in her lectures from other textbooks she had but thankfully – and he once more thanked whatever lucky star he had to have this one girl as his best friend – Hermione always took the best notes.
His scream cut throughout the room as he shoved the shocked man in front of him away with one hand, his eyes burning as he tipped the chair back and made the vampire woman behind him stumble back, pivoted on his shaking feet and slashed at Lest with the jagged end of the brush, sharpened by the glass he had broken.
“I had thought…I was under the impression from others that you two had rather contradictory personalities,” Lest continued.  His eyes searched Harry’s frowning face and their color seemed to deepen.
“I suppose you would know about filth, wouldn’t you, Granger?” Malfoy said in a tight voice.  Ron growled again and Harry felt the anger of the other Gryffindors rise as well.  The tension grew thick in the corridor, both Houses ready to snap out their wands. Fortunately, Hermione kept her hand on the redhead and he stayed where he was, preventing a close fight.
Harry took a deep breath and opened his eyes, putting the book aside as he checked if the coast was clear to grab his Invisibility Cloak.
"Oh, so now you're my babysitter as well as my mother," he muttered under his breath as they turned a corner.  Hermione didn't hear but Ron snickered slightly, trading amused looks with him.
“Well, well, well,” Malfoy drawled, his pale eyes glinting malevolently.  “Look what we have here.  It’s the Dirt gang – Dirty Potty, Grubby Weasel, and Filthy Mudblood.”  The Slytherins roared with laughter.
Saira snorted.  “Yeah,” she said sarcastically.  “So long as we do the dirty work, right?”  She glared at the Pater.  “Please tell me you told him ‘hell no,’” she growled.
“I trusted you!” Qye snarled, striking back up, eyes flashing bitterly and watching Lest take another stumble away.  “You’re nothing but a fucking liar!”
Qye hardly spoke about anything except to urge him to take another look at the library, swearing that they could fix this.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione breathed, a sorrowful expression growing on her face at the sight of his eyes.  She stood up and sat next to him, wrapping an arm around him.  “Harry, what is this?”
years holding off yet another corridor that teemed with beast vampires.  They all tried to leave the trained vampires to the adults, who struggled to shield the students the best they could behind the defenses Professor Opacre had left behind for them while their numbers dwindled beneath physical and telepathic attacks.
“Well…” she said, blinking. “I suppose, if that’s what you want to do…but I thought you were positive about him being here?”
“You fucking - ” the woman’s insult was cut off as she was simultaneously blasted by the adults, grunting as she hit the floor.  She waved her hand and there were renewed shouts of fear from the students as Professor Sinistra gurgled, hands clasping at her throat.  Hermione pushed forward, muttering something under her breath to help the Astonomy teacher while the Muggle Studies teacher flicked her wand defensively against the female vampire’s telekinetic use of armor pieces.
“Much as we love you, Harry, you are not actually the center of our universe,” Hermione answered dryly.  Harry relaxed and she resumed her study of him.  “So, last night.”
’ a traitorous thought intruded into the dull static of his mind.  He blinked slowly and a trembling hand reached up and tugged at his hair, pulled at it, tried to ground himself in the upheaval of his world.
“You will do no such thing,” she said sharply, baring her teeth briefly at him.  “The Pater Nosferatu has not given approval for you to do so and if you were to even try - ”
“Don’t you think you’ve done enough?” he snarled, his words and eyes dripping pure acid.  Seamus took another step back and Harry hissed at him venomously, “
Harry frowned. Wait. He shifted around, absently arranging Hermione's tense hold so he could see better and...he blinked. Ron wasn't looking at Lest's eyes. It took a few more glances between the two of them but he confirmed it. Lest's eyes were trying to capture Ron's but Ron's always seemed firmly fixated on some other part of the vampire's face, even as he moved from one foot to the other.
her brother - who hadn't even lost his temper! - and, even she had to admit, to a small degree she stressed to the others, won.
"Maybe you should listen to your girlfriend, Weasley," a cool voice said behind them.  "Merlin knows you'll need all the studying you can get."
A long suffering sigh came from beneath and the covers were flung back, revealing an irritated Harry Potter who was glowering at him from beneath messier than usual black hair.  He groped around for his glasses and put them on, bright eyes coming into focus as they continued to glare at the redhead.
“I thought that was Mind-Healer’s job,” Qye exhaled, closing his eyes and gripping the comforter beneath his hands as he slowly started to count back from ten.  Once he finished, he opened his eyes to see Smethwyck pocketing his wand and pulling out his notebook, writing down his notes while Harry curled on his side, draping his arm over his face.  Qye watched his fingers curl in his hair, his own fingers slowly letting going of the comforter.  “You know, the Mind-Healer you said would evaluate us and hasn’t shown up yet.”
Hermione kept up her promise, looking through her guides while she made sure Harry and Ron studied.  The problem was, she had so many and hadn’t specifically marked what she had seen.  Harry felt a pang of guilt every time he came down and found her still at her table in the common room, another stack of guides beside her.
Condition.  As if Harry wasn’t split in two and unconscious for days since being attacked by vampires and cursed by the Dark Lord himself.
November had come and gone quickly this year and December was already almost halfway gone.  The slightly cool weather of autumn had gone away finally, replaced by the cold, snowy weather of winter.  Instead of just being covered in thin sweaters that kept the chilly wind away, students were now apt to wearing long, heavy scarves with at least a long sleeved shirt and thick, warm coats to drive away the burning cold that threatened to ice over their bones.
Professor Opacre's bright blue eyes cheerfully looked at her class, all of whom looked thrown off-balance. Except for Draco, who was meeting Lest scowl for scowl.
’ Jordan realized.  He only saw that choker a couple of times but he had often seen his cousin rub something on his neck whenever he was stressed or contemplating something.  It was one of the two pieces of jewelry he wore.  The other was the Opacre Pendent, which held his Jewel.  Both pieces were worn under his shirt and hardly visible, which hid the sign that he was a Head. Unlike other Heads, his cousin didn’t wear things that proclaimed his title.  He didn’t need to, not with the presence he had.
Malfoy's jaw clenched but all he did was let out a long breath and move aside with an expectant look on his face. Ron gritted his teeth because it was obvious the only way he was getting back is if he 'talked' with Malfoy. He weighed the pros and cons, the snacks hindering his movements with a wand, and how long he'd been gone.
"Look, at the level my brother was doing it, he didn't see any deep, dark secrets. All he knew was what she was immediately thinking of doing in action and even that was at an abstract level. If he went any deeper, she would've felt something, perhaps like a tingling sensation that would have grown in intensity the further he went. She might have been able to prevent him from doing so..." She paused and winced. "Well...I wouldn't count on it if he really wanted to find something out but as you may have heard, there are several laws, many of them severe, if he ever went out of line. So you have nothing to worry about either of us reading your mind."
“I’d like to know that as well,” her brother said quietly from where he leaned against the wall, his eyes looking coolly at the wizard. “Is there something we should know about that boy, Dumbledore? Perhaps something about his mentality?”
"You already promised so you can just stand in the corner until I'm ready for you," Professor Opacre said airily, responding to whatever her younger brother had said. Harry stared alongside the others when Lest's eyebrow twitched and he backed away, folding his arms and leaning back on the wall, scowling at his sister. Qye just continued to snicker helplessly.
“No, ma’am,” he said quietly as she pressed a hand up to his forehead.  He sat silently as she took his temperature and probed him, obviously looking to see if his incorrect potion had done anything to him physically.
One late night, when they were alone in the Gryffindor Common Room, Harry put down his quill and muttered about Cedric and Voldemort and the Dursleys.  They listened and when he was done, Hermione packed away their study materials as Ron jostled him to one of the couches.  They sat in front of the fireplace, exhausted but relaxed and spoke about the things they would do that summer at the Burrow.
They stopped arguing when they heard her voice, all their eyes snapping to the hallway as Nilsson came racing in.
Qye said and Harry felt the pressure behind his eyes increase more, as if Qye wanted to see this clearly even though he hated viewing when Harry was in motion.
“I hate you so much,” Ron said conversationally to Draco, his arm draped over the back of Hermione’s seat.  “I should be granted an Order of Merlin for how much I completely and utterly hate you and am not doing anything.”
“Is the end of the Dazains and a chance to fight wizards not reason enough?” Lest asked, raising a cool eyebrow.
“Harry,” Hermione said again, sighing slightly as she lowered her hand.  “I can’t say that I know what you’re going through or how you’re feeling but - ”
“Stay away from me,” he said steadily, meeting the vampire in the eye.  “I don’t care what that was about and I won’t even mention it so long as you stay away from me.”
“I’m sorry it happened to you, too” Harry said softly.  He gathered up his courage and let go of Draco’s hand.  He heard the blond slowly exhale and then still as Harry moved his hands to his chest.
He swallowed and looked nervously at his blue-green potion.  It looked nothing like Malfoy's and if there was one thing he could trust in the Slytherin, it was that his potions were always perfect.  Swallowing again, he sighed and stood up.  Arguing would only lose points and besides, Madam Pomfrey could fix anything. . .right?
Turning to Hermione, he asked in an exasperated tone of voice, “Do you have any idea what these lunatics are talking about?”
“Hmm,” he said, looking up at the castle in the distance.  The moonlight shone down on them and Marylin wondered whether the gleam in his eye was because of the moonlight or something else.
A blush crawled onto the green-eyed boy’s face as he rolled his eyes and resumed his trek to breakfast, inwardly (very) thankful that no one had noticed his moment of silliness. “So I guess the joke wasn’t funny?”
He watched as they straightened, Draco with his wand trained at the vampire, Lest rubbing his elbow with that still dangerous look on his face.
The dog whined, shifting nervously on its paws as the werewolf slung his bag over his shoulder.  He frowned down at the Animagus as he stepped off the train and carefully avoided the few other passengers, mostly shopkeepers returning from business ventures at Diagon Alley.
Dark green eyes narrowed. “Well, if you hadn’t been acting all high and mighty, I wouldn’t have had to throw things at you, now would I?”
“Oh no you don’t, we have Quidditch practice,” the redhead growled as he tugged at the covers hiding his best friend.  The young Weasley frowned and let go for a moment, looking at the bundle that was Harry.  “What did you do last night to make you this tired?” Ron asked, his blue eyes looking worriedly down at the smaller boy.  “Everyone’s down at the pitch already.  Merlin, even
Qye said quickly and under any circumstances, Harry would have been instantly suspicious.  But his eyes dragged shut as his body grew heavy and lax with sleep, feeling Qye in that similar state of sleep.
“Mayhem, mayhem, let it rain,” snorted the man.  “I wonder if the others got as lucky as us.”  He took a step towards the students and chuckled as the professors raised their wands.
All her cheerfulness and excitement was replaced by worry and tension as she stared at the harsh, competitive look on her brother’s face.
Snape called roll quickly and as soon as he was done, he smiled maliciously and drew out another piece of parchment.  Harry immediately got a sinking feeling in his stomach.
He sighed and opened his mouth to tell his friends he was fine when Professor Opacre lifted her eyes from her plate.
“We must have faith,” Albus had said gently to Remus that morning before he accompanied a sickly-looking Sirius to the Ministry, briefly opening up the Floo Network in his office while Remus stood guard, his eyes fixed on them as they disappeared in the rush of flames.
They finally found it, the last week of May while reviewing.  Ron had wearily turned a page in a Charms book and mumbled about needing a pensieve to collect all the parts of his brain leaking out.
She looked at him suspiciously for a few moments where Qye clung desperately to his best Harry-meek look. She must have been satisfied because she nodded and the same confused look replaced her suspicious one.
As the black-haired teenager turned red under the startled looks and Hermione began to lecture him on his language and he stutteringly refused to reveal why he did so, he didn’t notice the look Ron was giving the faraway retreating back of the Slytherin.
“It…it’s nothing to do with…with You-Know-Who…does it?” Ron asked, looking at him a bit nervously.   Harry shook his head without lifting it from his plate.  Whatever had just happened had nothing to do with Voldemort, of that much he was certain of.
A minute passed where they stood, barely hidden in the alley next to Scrivenshift’s, the faint sounds of other Hogwarts students heading to the dance in the distance.
The dark wizard smirked as he walked closer, lazily waving his wand at the teenager as the vampire forced Harry to a stop a few feet away from him.  “You were so gracious to spare my new friends the trouble of looking for you, Harry.  Although,” Voldemort said, carelessly waving a hand towards the castle, “I’m sure they’ll still enjoy taking in all Hogwarts has to offer.”  He smiled maliciously as he took another step closer.  “Tell me.  Did you want to live to see your friends die or die knowing your friends will suffer?”
“I was in bed all night,” Harry mumbled, changing into his robes.  Ron noted that the other boy was hiding his face from him.
Barely awake, Ron lurched out of bed and grabbed Harry as he raised a pocket Sneakoscope over his head.
“She means that the Dazains are finding another way to rebel,” Krista suddenly said quickly, anxiously.
“Wait, wait,” Harry stopped her, raising a hand and turned wide and confused eyes on both of them. “What in the world makes him – or anyone really – think I…like…him?”
Thoughts of Harry smiling hesitantly at her, letting her pat his head, asking her for help to a date he was obviously excited for whirled through her mind, alongside the memories of Lest fiercely fighting through the war, his youthful smirks giving way to cold expressions, growing harsh and bitter under the expectations of leadership, trying to get back to his best friend.
“What?” he said blankly, looking back and forth between the Mind-Healer and the teenagers.  “That’s it? We didn’t even really get to talk.”
Raising his eyes slowly from the table, he looked up to see none other than Professor Opacre smirking down at them.  His face flamed up.  ‘
“As I recall, you’re only three years older than the eldest ones here, Lest,” Marylin snorted and smirked when her brother scowled at her. “Besides, I don’t think you’re such a grand choice to see if they’re still afraid or no. Hélène, Lest, they squeak every time you look at them. Ever think of perhaps not looking or acting so much like Dracula?”
“I remember,” Draco said.  Harry looked back at him but he saw no trace of anger or irritation in the gray eyes studying him.  “The point I’m trying to make is that I’m not the same person you hexed last year.”
“However,” she continued, still using her quiet voice and continuing to hold the entire class’ attention, “I am your teacher.  And I will be for the rest of the year so I hope you will all get used to it.  I don’t say this to be mean,” she sighed, raising a hand to rub her left temple slightly.  “I just want you all to know that I plan on staying here for the rest of the year.  I don’t want to be a strict martinet as some of your other teachers, who I have already had the pleasure of meeting.  I  hope being friendly with all of you because, to be very frank, this entire professional attitude is definitely not my way.”  She grimaced.  “To be even more honest, I would rather be shopping.”
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled, looking down at the desk. He coughed again and tugged at his collar, loosening the red-and-gold tie slightly. Glancing at Malfoy, he was surprised to find him frowning slightly.
“No, no,” Marylin continued hastily, also rising with placating hands as Lest remained seated, his fingers flexing while his eyes sharply observed the two.  “I said we wouldn’t, that’s not our intention at all.  Please, we all want what’s best for him, I assure you.”
In the background, he felt Marylin coming up, flicking her shield carefully around the Hogwarts witches and wizards.  He carefully extended his mental shields over them, narrowed eyes tracking Dazain as he paced relaxed next to the wizard who looked more like an
came to visit him when he was the Infirmary. Not that he was hurt – well, not much – just confused at their absence.
’ she thought to herself, annoyed.  Taking a deep breath again, she opened her eyes and looked sternly at her class.
"I realize the silence in your head must be of great joy to you," Lest cut into their mutual feeling of coming victory. Harry focused back and the smile wiped off his face as he stared at the vampire. Lest raised an eyebrow, hands by his side. "Do you really need to smile though?"
He saw a few people grin sheepishly - not Seamus, who was still cheekily smirking - and nodded, satisfied that people got the hint.
And then he was in front of the wizard who killed his parents, killed Cedric Diggory just last year.  Listening to him taunt and insult as Qye reeled from meeting their parents’ killer.
“Progress doesn’t need to include you,” Sirius shot back as Qye opened his eyes into a glare, straight at Lest, who wasn’t even looking at him, a contemptuous curl at his lips as he looked at Sirius.
“There are other reasons as well,” Lest said, turning his eyes away suddenly. “Once I tell them, they’ll understand.”
Crabbe and Goyle both had the bright idea that wands evidently weren't going to work. It took possibly only a second, both of them taking a step forward and flexing their muscles before Lest knocked them to the ground, standing over their dazed forms and twirling their wands.
,’ he thought a bit dryly, his green eyes traveling over the Great Hall.  That’s when he noticed the other students.
Remus was eyeing the Firewhiskey bottle when he heard the soft thud of glass on wood, turning in time to see Sirius’ hands coming up and clutching his head.  Remus squeezed his hands, helpless and anxious and on edge for tomorrow.
“Alright,” he said reluctantly, turning away slowly and heading for the doors.  Ron and Hermione followed slowly, Ron moving only at a nudge from the bushy-haired girl.  Harry glanced at them and winced inwardly when he saw both of them looking at him with questions in their eyes.  Well, Ron more with that look which indicated that he was stepping – if not already in – his overprotective attitude.  Hermione merely looked at him thoughtfully and Harry mentally sighed, knowing she was probably overanalyzing one thing or another.
“Because - ” Malfoy stopped abruptly and Harry glanced over at him.  The Slytherin’s eyes were turned away from him, blinking at a piece of crumpled parchment that had appeared on their table.  The pale boy frowned, picking it up and smoothing it out.  An annoyed expression came upon his face as he read the note scribbled on it and his stormy eyes glanced behind them.  Harry glanced behind too and saw Pansy look pleadingly at Malfoy above her frothing potion.
“Any update, Healer Smethwyck?” the nervous Minister asked as his fingers clenched and unclenched on his hat.  “Has he…I mean, the recovery is proceeding, yes?”
His green eyes saw Lest’s eyes open, dazed and dark, and he balled up a fist and hit him again.  He felt the arms unwrap up from him as their kiss broke, falling away from him more from surprise than any force from Harry.
“I’ll be okay,” he replied, forcing another smile.  “Really.  Don’t worry about it.”  Hermione opened her mouth, obviously worrying and obviously intending on arguing with him.  Luckily for him, Ron intervened again with a cough that sounded too much like ‘
Smethwyck snorted and Qye exchanged a quick annoyed look with Harry as the Healer guided them up and ushered them to the door.
“I’m not interested in listening to you,” Harry said flatly.  He looked away, straight at Wainscott.  “We were told you were ready for us so there must have been a decision.  What was it?”
“Sirius, we all wish to help Harry the best we can,” Dumbledore started gently, leaning forward as if to offer comfort where there was no comfort to be found in this moment.
Marylin snorted and Jordan jumped with his twin and Krista.  “Oh yes,” she said sarcastically, looking in contempt at Saira.  “We can be judged on the same level as wizards, who can perform a variety of spells and kill us without being within ten feet of us.”
“It’s on the flyer,” Hermione stated, nodding her head to the front of the large crowd, where the chatter was finally making its way towards Harry about attire and dates.  He grimaced and edged closer to his friends as he noticed some girls eyeing him in askance.  “I think it was made by her - ”
“Losing any part of my memory is disturbing, yeah,” he shrugged uncomfortably and was it just him or did Lest just shift uneasily? “Maybe the fever did it and I was delirious so I can’t remember anything?”
"I wonder how good that concentration is?" Lest mused aloud and Harry had just enough time to see a small frown on Ron's face before all the trinkets flew from Professor Opacre's desk.
“Okay, stop,” Harry interrupted, glancing back and forth between them with narrowed eyes as Ron contemplated upending his drink on the git.  “And stop stalling, one of you needs to explain this.  I know something’s going on between you two.”
“You obviously need to know Professor Snape better,” Professor Opacre smiled sweetly back. “Everyone knows he doesn’t pay heed to those rules so why should I?”
“You can hardly blame their restlessness,” a voice said in the doorway and the vampires turned as one as its speaker drummed his fingers against the frame.  “We were used to more action when we faced the Opacres.”
Dumbledore let out a deep sigh and stood from his chair.  “I think it would be best to show you first.”
The students were quietly urging Ron on, trying not to distract him from the confusion of constantly falling and banishing and returning trinkets. Harry held his breath because it looked like Ron was even starting to get a lead. Instead of returning trinkets to the desk the redhead started to send them towards Lest, who had to dodge them, feet moving carefully on the slippery surface.
He heard Professor Opacre make an inquiring sound but didn’t say anything further, obviously waiting for him to elaborate.
“I can multi-task,” Qye shrugged, dropping into one of the free chairs facing the group, staring flatly back at the adults while Harry sat next to him, shaking his head.
"Looks like your little friend doesn't need much protecting," he heard Lest drawl as he kept his eyes firmly on Ron. The redhead's face tightened slightly but surprisingly didn't turn red. He didn't even make a comment as he kept his eyes firmly on the vampire. A few murmurs rose from the Gryffindors, surprised at his lack of temper, and Harry felt Hermione drop a tense hand on his arm.
into the potion instead of simionwert, it would absorb any liquid in the drinker and dry them out faster than you could say sponge.”
She was old, one of the oldest in the world with the rightfully deserved title as Elder of the Zabar family.  Her little gift had helped her over the years, something extra that only her family knew about and whispered secretly to each other about.  It was why she had smiled when young Opacre had reluctantly opened relations with Albus Dumbledore.  How curious it would be if through their alliance she could meet the great-great-granddaughter of her old friend Cassandra Trelawney.
Her annoyance didn’t stop her from serving Harry some sausage and fruits, despite his futile attempts to stop her and she wouldn’t let them go to Potions until he finished everything.
“I believe I can help with that,” Professor Opacre broke in and the teenagers turn to look at her curiously. Her bright blue eyes twinkled mischievously. “I can’t have that mean man picking on my favorite students, can I? I’m sure we’ll be able to arrange something so Harry won’t suffer as much.”
Lest shot an annoyed look at his sister before focusing his attention back to the offending acorn. He stared at it for a few moments and then abruptly turned thoughtful eyes to the tree.
“Sounds good to me,” Ron agreed, tugging his robes closer.  “It’s bloody cold.”  He yelped slightly as Hermione pinched him.
“Seeing my face anywhere you go, huh?” he grinned momentarily before shaking his head.  “No, come on,” he said, walking past Draco to stand in front of the fence surrounding the property.  “Are we just…not going to talk about this?”
“Is that what you call it here?” the vampire woman said innocently, and Harry blushed even more.  Taking in a deep breath, he dropped his hand from his red-tinged face.  He glowered at a grinning Malfoy for a moment before shaking his head and turning back to the vampire.
“In what, Black?” Lest snapped back, some emotion returning to his eyes.  “Managing public relations?  My apologies, I didn’t realize your stint in prison gave you experience to do so.”“Enough!”
Her brother snorted and she closed her eyes, a muscle twitching in her cheek while a hand dropped on the back of her brother’s armchair and squeezed so tight Remus could see the white of her knuckles.  “Headmaster, it might be best if you took them now.  We’ll wait here.”
And look what had happened.  Over sixty dead, some young children, others old wizards and witches.  It took all these people
“Quite well, thank you, Harry,” Dumbledore said smiling, taking a seat as Madame Pomfrey set the tray down in front of Qye. She gave him a look that said he better finish everything or he wouldn’t be leaving for a long time. Qye gave her what he hoped was a charming smile and not a baring of teeth as she walked away.
:: Qye said flatly after a minute had passed.  The boy was quiet again and then, still using that flat tone of voice, he said, ::
“Don’t worry,” he reassured, squeezing her hand as they stood to get back in.  “Let’s just enjoy tonight for now, okay?”
Marylin never knew how deep her anger could go until then.  She could only imagine what Lest’s rage must feel like, traces of his fury echoing along the mental shield he had around her to protect her from Dazain’s abilities.
The marble of another statue cracked slowly, and then exploded with the same intensity like the one before it.
Harry looked down at their hands, Draco’s pale hands warm and familiar in his own.  He thought about Draco in their first year, holding out his hand to Harry, who barely knew anything about the wizarding world.  He thought about how he didn’t even have to think about rejecting the offer from a boy who reminded him too much of things he didn’t want.  Then he thought about this year, how he hardly thought about it when he reached out every single time for this pale hand and found it waiting for him.
“You’re right,” he murmured and the Gryffindors gave off silent sighs of relief. “The boy seems too shy to do anything of the sort, possibly afraid of me. He would never - ”
“Always pleasant, Weasley,” Malfoy smiled tightly as the new butterbeers arrived while he and Harry sat down.  Ron’s scowl deepened as Malfoy sat right across from him.  “Although I fail to see exactly what I did to offend.  Is it the lack of lace I have?  I realize we’re at an event but even I didn’t see - ”
Trying to corner Ron with explanations for the sudden change had been alarmingly difficult, with preparation for O.W.L.s and Quidditch and Ron somehow managing to change the topic every time Harry tried to bring up.  Trying to get Hermione into digging into Ron wasn’t an option, not with the way she eyed him like she still wanted to know his secrets and – getting closer to April – he still didn’t have any idea of what to do with Qye.  Flat out asking her about the change wasn’t useful either.
He was silent then continued quietly. “Your uncle and aunt were murdered and your cousin was found in the cupboard under the stairs with a few injuries.  He was found by chance by one of the Aurors.  He started screaming the moment the cupboard was opened and the Auror had to stun him to keep him quiet.  He was taken to St. Mungo’s and checked.  The physical damage wasn’t great but…" Dumbledore hesitated for a moment.  “He’s being committed.  They’ve placed him in a ward in a Muggle asylum so his aunt can visit him."
Qye stayed silent as they exited from the portrait, made no commentary as Hermione and Harry lightly discussed whether or not Transifiguring liquids would be on the O.W.L.s and whether or not doing so would affect their resulting potions.  Harry sent a quiet thought of support, the same he had as soon as woke up and felt Qye’s still turbulent emotions.
“Winged horses!” Hagrid said brightly, beaming even more.  “Some are from a flock jus’ passin’ by and others are from Hogwarts grounds.  None of ‘em are dangerous so for the firs’ lesson, thought I’d see how ya’ll react with ‘em.  So, off you go!”
Voldemort reared back, a snarling grimace on his face from what must have been Lest trying to tear his mind as the remnants flickered past them, Marylin barely picking herself up.
Ron blinked as a shimmer of light cut through the beast above him, a sickly charred smell invading his nostrils as he shoved the thing to scramble away.  His heart pounded while his hand grew tight on his wand.
“My sister suggested coming to see this place,” Lest said, glancing briefly at the Shrieking Shack as he started walking forward.  “Said it was relevant in understanding the culture of the students here.  I think she just enjoys the touristy things in life.”
All the class was seated, nervously waiting for their new DADA teacher to appear.  They had all arrived to an empty class and had pulled out their books.
"What does the time of year have anything to do with the professors?" Hermione asked, looking up from her Transfiguration textbook next to her plate and raising an eyebrow.  Harry took another bite of corn, also looking curiously at the youngest Weasley boy.
“All of a sudden?” Ron said skeptically, raising an eyebrow.  “Not that you haven’t been acting funny since the dance but…” He gestured down at the floor, where there were still a few scattered shreds of parchment and quills and books.  “This?  This isn’t you, mate.”
In the next moment, he felt Harry abruptly go limp, his arms slipping free from Qye’s shoulders as he started to slide to the floor.
“For the final time, yes, I’m fine,” he sighed, refraining from rolling his eyes. Then a thought came to him and he put on an apologetic face. “Sorry if I’m acting weird or anything, I just felt a little different when I woke up, that’s all.”
At first, he had been planning on ignoring Malfoy and his comments.  Unfortunately, Malfoy quickly switched to different methods and started flicking ingredients at him whenever Snape’s back was turned.  Harry was surprised he hadn’t cracked any of his teeth as he had been grinding them while trying to work on his healing potion and ignoring Malfoy and Snape’s comments.
“Well, come on, I can’t let you lot out on your own after dark,” Myn said cheerfully, clapping her hands softly together and smiling. “I’ll lead you guys up there.”
"We're going to be late for Potions," she said in an annoyed voice.  "As I have been trying to tell you for the last five minutes."  The irritation left and she looked at him worriedly.  "Are you alright, Harry?"
Ron had come up after classes had finished.  His redheaded friend didn’t say anything when he saw Harry staring up at the ceiling nor did he ask why Dumbledore had called him.  Harry bitterly guessed that the Daily Prophet had already gotten wind about his relatives’ death.
“Why don’t you go on ahead?” Harry offered, scrubbing his hands together.  “I think I need a moment of fresh air.”
Hermione bit her lip, obviously torn between her concern for his health and determination to make sure he pass all his O.W.L.s. Finally, she sighed, her loyalty to grades winning after being reassured that his illness was not serious.
“What’s happened?” Remus asked worriedly, standing up and rolling up their maps without another word.  It had taken them a while but this past year spent as reconnaissance for Dumbledore had gradually brought them back to their former confidence and he did not question why, merely started flicking his wand to eliminate traces of their presence.
This time, she had encouraged the idea of the dance as she saw more and more students tense as the exams loomed closer.  The fact that it would also provide her and Lest with the chance to interact with the wizarding world outside of Hogwarts in a prominent wizarding village was an added bonus.  Thankfully, Dumbledore had thrown his support behind her and she was thrilled with the turnout, watching students of all the Houses mingling together, relaxing and enjoying a night away from studying.  She was enjoying herself immensely and had been thankful that Lest had remained diplomatic with the Hogsmeade council, his arm looped with hers as he answered their questions about the negotiations.
“What are you doing?” Sirius demanded, voice strangled, and Qye hunched up against it, determinedly keeping his glower on Harry who dropped his own eyes down to the wand tracing a pattern across his chest.
“He’s just trying to protect him,” Myn’s shaky voice echoed in the room and Qye’s vision blurred and he dashed for Lest again, breathing raggedly as he swiped the stake at his throat again, Lest leaning back and staring at him with tormented eyes in a stunned face.
Hearing someone clear their throat, he looked up with a detached expression to see Seamus standing in front of him, looking slightly ashamed.
As quick as they arrived, the O.W.L.s were over, fifth years staggering out of their respective final exams with glazed looks, mentally and magically drained.
“We have things to discuss, Dumbledore,” the blond male said quietly, pushing himself off the wall, looking hard at the old wizard without any hint of the surprise he felt a moment before. Dumbledore nodded serenely and with that, left the room with the two vampires following him soundlessly.
:: - gentle ones. He didn’t move for fear that he might break the moment, making the blond remember the tension and cause him to take away the soothing coolness.
“It might be better,” she said, picking her words carefully, “for all of you to accept this as the new normal.”
“Can you hear me, Mr. Potter?” Jonas asked, still using his soft voice, keeping contact with those eyes.  He watched the young man blink slowly but make no other movement.  “Do you understand me?”
“The last vampire I fucking trusted said the same thing,” Qye snarled, the portraits rattling on the walls as his eyes flashed.  “I’m fucking tired of you all, get the hell away from us.”
“What the fuck?” one of the Dazain vampires said in a hushed voice, heard clearly by all in the silent clearing.  “Was that what I think it was?”
Marylin jerked to shield him and hissed as Dazain cut across her, grunting as he pushed her away with his telekinesis all the while he dodged Lest’s desperate blows.
He waited but she didn’t say anything more.  Cautiously, he said, “I really can’t see your brother letting you do this.”
A familiar burst of bright light flashed up and the vampire hissed as her blade hit the sunlight shield, wincing and rocking back as Neville pulled the teacher back, fumbling to conjure more vines.
“As some of you may have noticed, Professor Marylin Opacre is an emissary for the vampires,” Dumbledore said calmly, obviously ignoring the horror in the room.  “She is a guest and will be one of your professors for the year.  You will show her respect and listen to what she has to say.”  He smiled at the stunned group of students.  “I think it best for all of you to remember me saying that all of you are in the safest place possible, and that includes safety from your professors.  Professor Opacre is here to teach you, not harm, so do not hasten to rash actions.  And the Ministry has approved her being here,” he added as students begin to whisper, “so do give your new DADA teacher a chance.”  He smiled brightly at them.  “Now, let feast begin,” he ended cheerfully and clapped his hands, causing the golden plates to fill.  The blond vampire sat down as soon as he did and immediately began talking to him quietly.
“Like you said, Dean,” he said quietly, his green looking at them calmly but intensely.  “Lupin was nice and he was a werewolf.  What does it matter that she’s a vampire?”
The exclamation broke the class from their enchanted spell. They all turned to him and he could feel his cheeks heating up dramatically. It didn't help that Lest shot him a dirty look as he quickly hid his necklace beneath his shirt again.
“Would someone fucking tell me what’s going on?” Sirius exploded and Remus glanced towards his friend, who still stood clutching his wand, anger and fear warring on his face.  Sirius looked at Dumbledore and stalked quickly to the doorway he had motioned to before.  “Is Harry in there?  Harry?” Sirius called out as he walked swiftly through the door, desperate and anxious.
There was power, a strange sense of power, and it staggered her, notably pushed back Lest as he tried to get to Qye.
She focused her eyes on them and Harry was taken aback by how serious they were. "If you ever have to duel a vampire, if there is at least one thing to know about dueling them it is that you
“What say do you have in this?” Snape asked coolly, standing with his arms crossed and scowling at the vampire.  Draco stood silently behind him, leaning against a wall and staring palely at the beds.  Snape had drawn the teenager to him and argued around McGonagall and Pomfrey when they tried to send him with the rest of his students.  Dumbledore had sharply sent them to their responsibilities and touched the blond’s shoulder as the nurse had gone to work.  “As admirable as your desire was to protect the boy, he is a wizard first and our responsibility.”  He grimaced but met Lest’s cold gaze without flinching.
Hermione took one look at them and promptly went over, kneeling gently down and winding her arms around their friend.
"Look," Professor Opacre said, resuming her reassuring voice. The students' faces did not change. "I told you, this has been entirely cleared by the Headmaster and your respective Head of Houses. I won't tell you how far I had to go to push it past Professor Snape," the blonde muttered the last part in a lower voice. She cleared her throat and raised her voice again. "None of your friends from the other classes are missing, maimed, or otherwise harmed. That should say you'll get out of this just fine."
She rubbed her hands together, looking down at the ground.  She felt a bit guilty for wanting their safety because of their importance to vampires but that wasn’t the only reason she really wanted them okay.  She truly did like them.
“What doesn’t he know?” Jordan’s cousin asked coldly. “Are the Dazains still a threat?”  Saira sighed irritably and turned to face her liege.
"Yes, I'm stronger than her," Lest cut in with an extremely bland tone of voice. "I can now take her on without even exerting my full strength."
He struggled against the pressure, thinking the man had pinned them against the wall with a bar or something.  Then he stilled, his eyes widening and terror completely replacing his anger.
“We’re not children,” Reya, the young girl – except she had to be older, he saw that in her face now despite being no taller than a first year – said as the vampires slowly spread themselves out.  Ron could see others behind them, one bouncing something in her hand, another so large he could almost reach Hagrid.
“Lest,” Myn whispered softly, placing a hand on her brother’s arm, her eyes slightly puzzled. Lest ignored it and continued to glower down at the innocent-looking boy.
“I’m still worried about Harry,” Hermione said one afternoon when Harry was off sending a letter to Sirius.  He had fended off their company, promising he would come straight back but needing a moment for himself.
Harry firmly said, eyes locked on the redhead and silently willing him to at least break even with Lest.
“I don’t know what’s going on,” Ron said quietly, his troubled blue eyes meeting Hermione’s own. “But why don’t we go find out?”
The leg hovered and Harry could hear the buzz of his classmates increase but it was all in a second because like Professor Opacre said, things had to happen fast, duels happened fast, like a flash of green light and lost lives. The leg shot towards the vampire's head and Harry had a flash of a club knocking out a troll and it felt fitting to end this with a move Ron had used. It only took a second, the leg levitating up and shooting towards Lest's head with a flick of Harry's wand -
“Lest,” Dumbledore said in a low voice, taking a step towards the vampire, a heavy frown on his face as Marylin shifted uncomfortably, too aware of Snape’s sharp, suspicious response next to her.
They were silent for a moment, one of those comfortable silences now rather than the tense fury of before. Then an uncomfortable thought that he had been trying all along not to think of forced itself to the forefront of Harry’s mind and he sighed, reluctant to let go of one of the rare moments of peace he had.
“What do you mean, Verna?” he asked silky and Jordan shivered.  He had almost forgotten about his cousin’s silky voice.  The last time he used that tone of voice had been when he had killed the assassin of the last Head of the European vampires.  He had been one of the unfortunate ones to be there when the Opacre group had caught the assassin.  He shivered again and felt his twin grasp his hand under the table reassuringly.  Jacob hadn’t been at the…execution…but he had heard enough from Jordan’s nightmares to get a vague idea of it.  Jordan gratefully squeezed his twin’s hand.
They had checked every book in the library that had even one sentence on any of the ingredients and they had not found one reason to explain what happened.  Harry remembered sitting in the Gryffindor common room, staring dismally at the last book.
In the distance, he heard guttural snarls coming closer, accompanied by low voices in an unfamiliar language.
“This is giving me a lot to look forward,” Ginny commented as she looked them over.  Parvati and Lavender were sitting down next to her, both with their eyes glazed over as their hands hovered their forks over their drinks.
“Here then,” Professor Opacre smiled, dropping the clothes in his arms and bustling him behind the privacy screen she erected after he tried to escape the fifth time.  “I know this is it, I would’ve gone with green but I feel like I should save that and goodness knows this will look just as well on you - ”
It was…unnerving…to see this less antagonistic side of Malfoy.  He acted almost indifferent towards them and Harry was surprised to feel a bit of disappointment at this lack of hostility.  He actually, if he was honest with himself, kind of – not really much, of course not – missed the interaction between them.
“I’m sorry about that,” she said apologetically as both Lavender and Parvati whispered their condolences to their disappointed housemate.  “I suppose I should’ve mentioned but I really didn’t think it would be issue, Lest is usually a very intimidating presence to most.  I suppose I forgot all about Gryffindor bravery,” she said ruefully.
