“Yes! What kind?” Draco replies enthusiastically. He’s staring at Harry’s bare back.
Harry scoffs; apparently, that is very much not an option.
A Thestral foal suckles in the shade across the clearing. Harry clicks his tongue, holding out his palm. A hundred feet away, the mother looks at him warily. “Who did it bring you?” He asks.
The route is physical; a series of powerful slaps up slopers involving a feet-above-the-head bat-hang and double-clutch dyno to the lip of the roof.
“I need to see a quarry,” he replied.
Draco spends the rest of the afternoon on his hands and knees, double checking the integrity of the groundwater filtering charms along the fence, and of the light, humidity, and nitrogen monitors in the beds. At one, a light rain begins to fall; by two, the skies have parted for a deluge.
“You want her opening that can of worms at Tribal? Absolutely not. Get your head back on, you infuriating, insufferable prick.”
“Me? What do you mean?” Draco asked, looking back at Harry with wide, innocent eyes.
“You beautiful, beautiful man,” Harry announces.
“That’s fine,” Iz said. “We still have the numbers.”
I’ve sat down every Wednesday night since we got a telly to watch this thing. Just because you always fall asleep doesn’t mean it’s not worthwhile. This is my
A flash of colour caught his eye, and he paused to look, moving behind her and running his hand along the rock with his finger. There, shoulder height and wedged in with a loose stone, was a neatly wrapped package.
“Land ships?” Harry asks. “Or sea ones, washed ashore?”
Draco buried his temples in the heels of his hands. His field journal lay open in his lap.
anything until you manipulate it and it induces a force. So what can store a magnetic force just inside itself? It can’t just be that the donut-hole in the Rai stones creates a polar equilibrium, it has to be inside the rock.”
“Draco, this is huge, isn’t it? If a physical structure can store magic so efficiently, we can study it, replicate it. This could revolutionize technology!” Harry said, standing to pull him into a bone crushing hug.
“I don’t understand. Was it yours? Or his? The stone?”
Better, even, is the expression on Draco’s face. His lashes are dark, fluttering as he blinks, but his lips are slightly parted. He looks entirely in the moment, captivated by his own focus in a way that is so unbearably sexy, so
“I think you’ll be allowed home now that you’re awake,” Draco replied. “I’ll go and get a Healer to come and look at you.”
“I’m unwanted by myself.”
“But--” he protested, and Harry closed the screen with an insistent hand. It was all tooth-rottingly cliche.
Draco turned his lips up weakly. “Really? You’ve barely looked at me for days.”
Harry threw his hands up. “I’m not a model of self-control, Draco. He
Harry, it’s not a new thing for me to have feelings for you. The first time I saw you at Madam Malkin’s, I think I knew. I didn’t know what to do with those feelings. I was too young to understand it, but I wanted you in my life. I longed for your eyes on me and maybe to have permission to touch your gloriously tousled hair.
Malfoy shrugs. “Weather magic runs in the family. I don’t need spells for intuition. Anyway--” He holds out his hand in expectation. “Wand? Let’s go.”
I’m sending you a copy of the Prongs’ manuscript and a Muggle book about ADHD. ADHD is not your main problem, but I can see that your aunt and uncle’s way of treating you for it contributed to your trauma.
They hadn’t figured out who Jones, Claire, CJ, and Tara were voting for, but it shouldn’t have mattered much. They should have had the majority regardless.
. When we were fighting, or in the manor, with him, I never thought that. Of course I was, I suppose, part of history, but I never thought it. And then when my aunt broke the window, I heard her laugh. I think she did it for fun.”
“I don’t know,” Malfoy says, “that sounds like a date. And dates always lead to sex when the bloke looks like me.”
Which season of Survivor did I watch before writing this fic, and therefore has the most similarities to the events, characters, and challenges that I wrote?
So, as they walked back into their own house, Draco turned to Harry with a worried expression. “Do you really think that Ichabod could have something to do with all of this?”
Day 4
“Marissa is too wily for her own good. That girl is ice cold,” Ben said, and Draco found his connotation a little demeaning. Gender equality, evidently, was not America’s forte.
Draco collapsed onto his forearms, and the manic scaffolding he had built in his brain crumbled around him. Merlin, he was exhausted.
Then, as soon as the Council commenced, Jones’ pockmarked, leathery cheeks split in a Pennywise-grin. He pulled the neat roll of parchment from the tote in his lap, slid it from it’s twine, and smoothed it out with grimy, coal smeared fingers. From the Juror’s stands, Marissa leaned forward in her seat, elbows on her knees. Ben giggled, hand covering his mouth.
He dresses quickly in the white shirt and jeans he keeps in Harry’s bottom drawer, slipping through his floo to a cacophony of hammers and whining machinery. Stopping in the guest bath to check his neck for visible hickies, he bustles towards the back porch,
Harry follows his gaze, spotting an uneven ledge from a crack in the floor. “What?” he asks.
“Will there be an advantage?” he asked.
Harry’s face lit up. “You
“Have you ever had a summer where you just did anything you wanted? Have you ever just done anything you wanted?” Harry asks.
Iz smiled innocently. “Perhaps,” she said with a friendly chime. “But perhaps only partially.” Jones stalked away in a huff.
Harry watched the door swing shut behind Hagrid and gave a heavy sigh. “Great,” he muttered, turning to Draco. “What in Merlin’s name is wrong with you?”
“Harry. Harry, really, I’ve got to go.” Draco pulls his jacket off the back of a rustic wooden chair. The cafe has been painted pale yellow and robin-egg blue, and a bucolic hum of birdsong has been charmed to play through the dining area.
“This might sting,” he said. A wound like this could have someone laid up in a hospital for days getting dressings and salves replaced. He could not bear to let that happen to Iz. Need be, he would obliviate her.
why you called?”
“So did lots of people. They thought it meant power, but it doesn’t. It just makes you feel like a stranger.”
Draco looked down at the toad in his arms and smiled to himself. It was a turn up for the books, really, he thought. He wouldn’t have dreamed of handling a toad when he was a student at the school, but there was something about this particular toad that had captured his attention. It was almost calming to see him just sitting placidly in his tank, and Draco thought he could watch him all day, if given the chance.
“The winner of Survivor Wa’ab is… Draco!”
Dear Harry,
“Um,” he says, “This week, actually.” He at least has the grace to feel embarrassed.
“It’s worked before,” he said, shrugging.
The first anomaly they came upon was a flat island in the creek where river rocks peeked above the rapids and the water split.
The screen door is open, and Draco freezes. The yard doesn’t look like much-- just a plat of soil crisscrossed with gravel pathways-- but for not looking like much, it’s
“Holy hell,” Harry said. “We’ve got to milk this.”
Draco has two weeks before Harry moves in; two weeks to transform his 20’ by 20’ terrace of brittle grass into a proper gardener’s haven. “Sure thing,” Neville says.
He was paired with Marissa, a girl so bland Draco knew nothing about her besides her name (which he hadn’t even memorized until day 6). She was assumed to be a slow digger, so they had given her the spot with the driest sand. They had tried to equalize the time all three pairs would take to collect parts, so they had paired the best digger with the toughest terrain and the second-fastest runner, and the second-best digger with the slowest runner, and etcetera. Draco really hoped it would work.
I can’t promise that you and your magic will ever be stable on its own again; I haven’t come across any record of a case where a person was a Horcrux and lived after removing the soul splinter. You are unique in this. However, I believe we can at least find stabilizing measures. If necessary, even with magico-orthetic charms or amulets and reach an increase in life quality for you.
Draco rubs his lubed up hands together vigorously, and a wet thumping fills the studio. Bill suppresses his laughter with breath, beginning to moan and whimper with increasing gusto on Draco’s cue, still entirely hidden from the audience and cameras. Technically, Draco was meant to do this part too, but the sounds he had made during dress had been deemed ‘not lewd enough’, so Bill has been brought on as support.
“Okay,” Draco says. “Okay.” The hand leaves Harry’s hair, and he can hear the dull hum of drawer tracks as Draco searches for lube.
Harry returns the expression best he can but not half as elegant. “Do you say that because you want to know, or because you think it would be good for me to talk?”
As Draco ate, he would look up occasionally to find Harry staring in rapt adoration, and burst into gleeful laughter. Harry had always had a thing for watching him work. As they prepared to leave, he slid a napkin into Draco’s lap, the words ‘
Draco shrugged. “Can’t change the experience.”
The door chimed with a lively melody at half past, and Harry opened it for Parvati, Lavender, and the twins, Rhea and Nikhil, who were best friends with Rose. Lavender’s dress was printed with strawberries and peaches, and her golden hair was piled into a bun atop her head. Parvati’s arms were wrapped around Lavender’s neck as she told Harry they planned to spend an all-day date exploring a farm and nursery that sold rare ingredients to their tea shop.
Harry climbs like he casts; raw and gritty and imprecise, but with such intentioned emotion that his sheer power never runs astray. He is surprisingly methodical, using random jugs on the wall to pull himself into position and practicing the same move over and over. Every time he jumps, another lock of wild raven curls escapes his bun.
“We watched it on Tuesday,” Ron replied grimly. It was an act, Harry was sure; he’d seen Ron enraptured, eyes glued to the screen, hand shoveling cumin popcorn into his mouth, as he watched the stampede of dogs race through the city, cops hot on their heels.
Harry’s lips twist into a sad, shallow smile. “I don’t think so.”
They did not get back.
Harry has pulled in front of the townhouse in a rickety and rusted-up white truck. The manual-adjustment windows have been rolled down, and one of Harry’s tan, corded arms hangs out the driver’s side. He’s a rugged, sexy vision, in a muscle tee and low bun, but Draco’s not about to say that.
Now to your medical history with potions. The potions you took contraindicate Garcia’s Potion, which would have been the simplest approach. In my opinion, we should bring in my colleague Nkoleka Okafor, who is a magico-endocrinologist and can examine your present hormonal state and customize your medication.
We’ve spent so many months talking about this game. I’m so glad I get to participate. Although, reality TV is so corporate. They’ll edit your whole story around and render you unrecognizable. You better hope they don’t paint you as a nitwit.”
“Let’s try not to get too persnickety,” he said. “Just share where we think our strengths are and designate roles before Jeff calls time.”
Draco’s lithe frame weaves in and out of the shadows as he arranges himself between the other members of his dance troupe, and Harry stands-- usually, he is satisfied with filling in the blanks with his imagination. This is not one of those times. He wants every detail.
“You’re not unwanted. Besides, the elves made pudding.”
“I don’t see any glass anywhere!” countered Harry, throwing his hands up. Ichibod hiccoughed from the direction of the couch.
She began to climb, pinching the porous bulges in the rock and testing each ledge before she stepped on it. “Are you--” Draco started, but thought better of it. He would probably do the same, if only out of curiosity.
The Room of Requirement is lit with spiraling fireworks. Some are neon, shaped into curly-cues and tornados. Others form the likeness of Dragons, and they swoop and flip through the air. Harry recognizes them as a batch of Fred and George’s Wildfire Whiz-Bangs that were confiscated mid fifth-year.
How are you feeling today after last Tuesday’s spell casting examination?
There was a chorus of “Yeah!” as the contestants grabbed their wallets one by one and fanned along the bleacher benches. Draco sat, as usual, between Isabelle and Harry. The three of them were creatures of habit.
She did so at the very center of camp, right where Draco was busy boiling drinking water. Jabbering constantly, she plopped down between him and the row of canteens he was filling. Sighing, he got up and wordlessly circled the fire to regain access to his task. Tara followed him.
Harry laughed, throwing his head back cheekily. “Apparition always hurts. What’s another 300 miles?”
“Okay, okay, I get it. So what's the plan?” Harry shook his head in exasperated amusement.
“You don’t have to vote for her,” Harry said, kneeling down to comfort him. “They’ll likely want to go for you at four, and they won’t have numbers if I flip.”
“You didn’t hear that Harry spent a night in hospital, then?” Draco asked, giving Harry a sideways glance. “Or that we’ve been bringing chaos wherever we go?”
Malfoy responds with a bitter shrug. “I’m not wanted.”
“Mm, well, we’ll see,” Harry said, eyes fixed on the toad once more. “Alright, a cave, you say?”
Harry’s face broke into his trademark lopsided grin, dimples puckering underneath his dark stubble. Even gaunt and tired, he had a magnetic charisma that drew every eye.
I think I should end the letter here. My mother sends you her greetings. She thanks you for asking about her and wants me to tell you that she is fine. The chocolates that I sent with this message are actually from her.
Survivors, drop your buffs: The merge is upon us.
Baring his teeth in a charming smile, Harry placed one hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Precisely.”
“Do you want to get out of here?” Harry says into Draco’s ear.
Draco took a deep breath. “Yes.”
Harry dropped the voice correcting charm as soon as they were out of hearing range, and Draco sighed in relief. The harsh American accent sounded wrong on Potter’s tongue.
Harry shrugged. “Internet research. Otherwise, I’d have no idea what was going on at those meetings with Hermione.”
“Using yours, eh? You know, my lease runs out next month.”
My magic, however, is out of control. It is as if it is restless, foreign, constantly leaping from the tips of my limbs and creating an aura around me that refuses to still. I can perform all kinds of wandless and wordless spells, shape the world as I go with an almost innate kinship to the electricity that brushes my skin. I am, in lack of a more suitable adjective, conductive.
Stomachs full, they basked in the shade of a red striped umbrella. “The Rai stones are incredible, Hermione. I can’t quite figure them out, but god, you would love them. I wish you could see. Their magic is like nothing I’ve ever encountered,” he told her.
He laughed. “You
Harry scowls. It’s a good sign; it means his resolve is thinning.
“Ah,” Harry says, nodding. “But I seem to remember a shipment coming in last week.”
It shouldn’t have been possible to cast transparency charms with such ease, but Harry had always been the exception. Something about a childhood spent fighting off chunks of other wizard’s souls had made his magical core rather robust, albeit erratic. Harry was a beautiful, broken, wild force of nature. If he set his mind to it, he could bend mountains to his whim.
“Between us, there was no definitive leader or ulterior goal. We had genuine friendship and respect for each other, and we used our compatibility to symbiotically move each other forward. It is rare in Survivor to see a player who can learn to trust others without becoming complacent, and I feel the two of us managed to achieve that.
Harry studied the spell and raised his wand arm, but Draco pressed it down. “Let me,” he said, “Your raw power gets in the way of precision.”
Jessie had flipped, and Marissa went home, leaving Draco in a minority of four.
Dear Mr. Potter,
Potter cleared his throat, and Draco shifted further away from him. “Well, Jeff, I am beyond excited to be here. I feel like I embody the resilience and positivity of the West Coast, and I believe these traits will serve me well in this game. I am here to win, but even if I don’t, I want to enjoy the ride.” Draco rolled his eyes. Potter was not from the United States West Coast-- in fact, Draco could feel the steady buzz of magic in the air as he spoke, indicating that his accent was less than real-- nor was he in any way excited to be playing Survivor. This, in particular, peeved Draco to no end. He had been preparing for months, practicing fire-building in his backyard, picking up a gym membership, and writing up scores of files detailing his fake backstory as an aeronautical engineer in Seattle. The fact that Potter hadn’t even bothered to learn to talk appropriately was a testament to how different they truly were.
Malfoy looks to his right, but whoever he could once see there must have faded into the night, because he drops his hand. “I—I just wanted—”
Malfoy laughs. “Not yet. But it gave me perspective.”
Malfoy’s laugh is the kind of laugh that floats, bubbly and delighted. He gestures for Harry to go first in a bow of playful chivalry. Harry hops the rail, sliding onto a velvet cushion. It is only when Malfoy joins him that he realizes it slants towards the middle.
Harry took it upon himself to get sloppy drunk on shitty, too sweet champagne. He’d lost about 20 pounds, and had clearly no clue where his tolerance lay. That, or he simply did not care.
When his tribe erupted into cheers as Harry sliced through the final length of twine and the aquamarine flag unfurled with a snap, Draco pasted on a belated smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. Harry grabbed his arm, pulling him in and lifting him off the ground with a whoop, but Draco backed away stiffly as soon as he was released. He winced from where rough hands had dug into the growing sunburn on his shoulders. Harry earned several slaps on the back and hugs, and Draco couldn’t help the jealous pang of being outshone. He was proud of Harry, sure, but mostly he just felt left behind.
You were the first to make me question my beliefs. When I saw you so open with your friends, it changed my perspective on relationships and humanity. I couldn’t talk openly about anything, not even with Pansy, even though she had been my closest friend since early childhood. Each of your friends belonged to a group of people I had been told not to associate with, Muggleborns, people my father called blood traitors, people who use a Remembrall, not heteronormative people like Finnegan and Thomas (joke’s on my father: I turned out to be gay myself), slightly eccentric people like Lovegood, werewolves like Professor Lupin (who wasn’t dangerous at all; unlike the werewolf my father did associate with because his master forced him to)… And they were all better people than those I was told were 'the right sort of wizard.
For how fast it is over, the impact cuts deep. Draco finishes with a final thrust and a cry. The corset has slid down his ribs, and a pale indentation is left behind on his chest, rising and expanding with each laboured breath.
“No, not pulled. I have a joint I was going to smoke. If I keep it all to myself, it’ll make me throw up.”
Ed still got voted out seven to two (and Tara and Ed hadn’t even voted for the same person), but the bickering that occurred prior was enough to impress even Jeff. Ed called Ian a ‘nincompoop’ and announced that he was ‘the best prosecutor in the state,’ and he was ‘playing as if the other contestants were defendants.’ Ian called Ed a ‘sad old man who’s convinced himself he’s hot shit because he can’t face that his existence is one long mid-life crisis.’
Draco cringes-- sometime in the last two years with Harry, he has become an awful liar. “We got an inventory shipment.”
“Ready?” Harry whispers. His lids shut, mouth shaping the vowels of an incantation. In a second, Draco is naked and slick. Harry’s legs slide up his hips, ankles crossed at the base of his spine. He is so, so ready.
On the upside, I have seen it myself now and, if you give me permission, I can send a house-elf that comes from an elf family bonded to the House of Black to retrieve the artifact, so I can destroy it.
He had learned that the magic inside was very different from that of the air around it, in both frequency and stability. While the air crackled with wild electricity, ready to latch onto whatever could channel it, the magic in the stones seemed to resonate with a quiet power, and, when Draco closed his eyes and focussed, it gave off a speckling of many different impressions, as if it held thousands of separate times and emotions and connotations. It felt at once ancient, wise, chaotic, and mysterious, but the only thing that Draco knew for sure was that he had gone into the right profession. It was fascinating.
P.S. I hope you enjoyed! Leave me kudos and tell me I'm pretty.
“We knew you’d be happy here,” Harry said, looking at the toad. “I just wish you hadn’t put me in the hospital to let us know you weren’t happy with us.”
Draco moans and tears away. Harry leans up to chase his lips and tightens his grip on the thighs across his lap instinctually. “This is a twin bed,” Draco says.
of dance class. The first clue really should have been that the lessons were 11pm on Fridays.
Ron and Harry, perhaps because they were of weak constitution when it came to denying their kids, or perhaps because they were secretly pleased, conceded in seconds. After Jake, Ellie and the twins had been picked up, and Hugo had been put to bed, Teddy even roped them into watching every single DVD special feature.
Draco
Ron paled, snatching the DVD and shoving it onto the high shelf of ‘grown-up movies’. He cleared his throat, clearly fed up with Harry’s chatter. “Oooh, is it too early to watch Polar Express?”
“Third vote: Tara. Fourth vote: Isabelle. Will not count. That’s two for Tara.”
“Draco,” Harry said, cutting him off.
Draco amended with a nod and a frown. “Lead the way,” he said. “You’re usually right.”
Harry has both his hands on the small of Draco’s back, Draco’s lean arms wrapped around his neck. It smells like sweat, and the city just before it rains, and youth.
Hermione, pragmatic as ever, called out in precise and structured  directions:  “...Take 4 long strides forward, then 2 directly left, and then 4 more back the direction you came. There it is. Okay, untie the third item on the left. No, no, not that one, one over. Okay, Draco, pause for a moment, I need to think...”
Once you have configured your gears, you will descend the stairs and fill the second bucket at the base of your platform with water from the large jug. You must then throw the water in the second bucket from outside of the roped-off circle and land it in the first bucket. Each time you throw water, you must climb to the top of your tower and pull the bucket up, regardless of whether you managed to land anything in it, and pour it’s contents into a pail. Once the pail is full, a buoy will be released and your flag will rise. First to raise their flag wins. Let’s draw for spots!”
The day did not improve after that. For one, they lost the Immunity Challenge. For another, Tara tried to talk strategy.
“The magic told me,” Malfoy says.
And Merlin, Harry was indeed gorgeous. He had shaved clean again, although Draco had asked him to keep some stubble, and his jaw was sharp and chiseled, his chapped lips full. Both of them were struggling to regain muscle mass, but a temporary soft patch had formed beneath Harry’s belly button, and Draco liked it very much. His dark hair was thick, flouncing around his shoulders as he walked, and his skin was tanner than it had ever been. Even better was their unofficial no-clothes-in-the-suite policy.
Harry lent him a hand, pulling him to his feet and Apparating them to the grassy clearing beside their favorite waterfall. It was in the lazy hours of the afternoon, and most of their tribemates were asleep in a post-Reward coma.
He had woken up that night with a sore throat and dry tongue and, wandering towards the well, had found Harry leaned against a tree. Tears stained his face and one contact was stuck in the far corner of his eye.
“Hmm,” Draco said. “You haven’t.”
They waited patiently for the rest of the contestants to gather, and Draco scowled when Harry Potter joined him on the mat, partially blocking Draco’s view. At any minute, Jeff Probst would be right in front of them, and Draco was absolutely not going to miss it.
Growing up magical takes intention out of everything. Growing up trapped takes choice out, too. And growing up the way he did-- growing up the way he used to be-- well, Draco doesn’t much want to think about it. Instead, he runs to the only places it’s not easy to go, in the hopes that he’ll become the sort of person that it’s not easy to become. In hopes that he’ll be humbled.
Harry looked puzzled. "Before Ginny? I've been with Ginny since I left school. I've never had sex with anyone else."
Draco watched him close the door behind himself, and tried to memorise his facial expression so that he could compare it with whatever he looked like when he returned.
look incredible, and you know I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true."
"Hmm. That's a good point," said Draco. "In the meantime, though, we should sleep. Let's see if there's anywhere around here we can Apparate from."
"Maybe you did, and I'm just a figment of your imagination," suggested Draco helpfully.
"As I'll ever be," said Draco. "Let me just get my bag. You do know those colours don't really go together, by the way?"
hand on my arm?" Harry wanted to know. "In fact, why
Yawning, Harry let his gaze wander round the room as he waited to be served. Most of the tables were occupied by couples of about Harry's age, although the one nearest the door was surrounded by a group of five very loud teenage girls who were showing each other things on their phones and cackling. Next to them was a young man, again about Harry's age. He was on his own; he had his eyes closed and a frown on his face, and was muttering to himself.
"Give me the guided tour, then," said Draco, dumping his rucksack on the grass.
Until that moment, Harry realised, he'd been right: the people who'd been staring at him holding hands with Draco were now fascinated by the antics of the Patronus. Now they were all looking at him again, but a moment later a silver tiger raced from the far end of the alley and stopped in the centre outside the Leaky Cauldron.
like that? If not, I promise never to mention it again. But I'm hoping."
"He calls me Draco?" But even as he asked the question, Draco remembered that he'd heard the evidence of this the previous day. He felt his face heat up again. "Fine. Hermione. Ron." They both smiled at him. "Tell me about Harry, please."
Harry thought about this. "Well, I mean, I'm at Ron and Hermione's a few times a week for one reason or another, and they usually ask me to stay for food, so of course we chat then. And I talk to people at work. And I do go to the Burrow every week for Sunday lunch, and there are always loads of people there to talk to."
Teddy's eyes were huge as he stared at Harry's cock, but he didn't comment on it. "I'll just, er… see you at home," he said, and Disapparated.
The song had begun quietly, but when Draco got to the last verse he suddenly flung his arms out and sang at the top of his voice.
"I can't tell whether that's a good wow or a bad wow," Draco admitted. "Is it a bit too much? I can go home and change..."
"No! Wait! Draco! Please!" shouted Harry desperately. But it was no use – Draco didn't reappear.
"There may have been one or two wanks with you in mind," admitted Draco, with a wry smile.
go to the toilet," said Draco. "There are only fifteen minutes left of the lesson, and you are old enough to be able to hold it in for that long, I'm sure."
"Especially if you memorised it when they weren't expecting you to," Harry pointed out. "But I'm still not clear why you felt it was so important to do that?"
"Good afternoon, Mr & Mrs Malfoy," she said when she arrived, but they didn't respond. She smiled sympathetically at Draco.
Hermione smiled, remembering. "He whispered in my ear: 'You know how I've been saying for years that there was something missing from my life but I didn't know what it was? Well, I think I've found it.' And that was only about an hour after the first time he'd seen Draco in fourteen years, wasn't it, Harry? And he was right. Ron and I have spent a lot of time with the two of them since then, and they really are perfect together."
"I should probably warn you that Ron's likely to guess, whether you tell him or not," Harry told him breathlessly. "He's got
tell you. Just not right now, because it's a slightly longer story than we have time for at the moment."
Ron raised his eyebrows. "Draco, is it now? You
"OK, leave it with me. When do you need to know by?"
"The truth, of course," said Draco. "And no, I don't mind you asking. It was awkward, though. I wanted him to understand the mistakes I'd made and the reasons why I made them, and that I'm sorry for them, but of course I didn't want him getting the idea that I'm a terrible person. Because I don't think I am, any more, but I wasn't sure I'd be able to convince him of that."
By now, Draco was thoroughly enjoying himself. “We’re halfway through my programme,” he told his audience, who seemed – even those who were strangers to him – to be hanging on his every word. “So it seems like a good point to mix things up a bit. I do have one more classical song later in the programme, but right now it’s time for some showtunes. Now, the first one is
It turned out that all Harry had to do to get a Healer to come back to the Manor with them was to ask, which both relieved him and annoyed him. He was relieved to find that the Healer in question – a harassed-looking Russian woman – did seem to know what she was doing, though, because she didn't just try to do a physical examination as soon as she arrived; she sat with Narcissa and Lucius and tried to talk to them for a while first, making copious notes. They didn't respond to her (or to Draco or Harry), but at least they didn't seem uncomfortable with her presence, which had been one of Draco's fears.
"That's quite an achievement," commented Draco. "And the second reason?"
he thought to himself,
tell you if I was. At least I think I would. I haven't yet encountered anything I'd be unwilling to say to you. It's nice – I don't think I've ever known anyone else that I could say
? They won't be pleased."
back," he said. "But you've seen me twice already – you do remember that, don't you?"
"That sounds fine, Professor. I haven't taught much Defence, though – just the odd lesson at Beauxbatons when Williamson was ill – so could you let me have copies of the current syllabus and textbooks to look at beforehand, please? I assume Potter will have lesson plans too, but I can wait to look at those till I get there."
Draco stared at his son, momentarily speechless. He handed the note back and watched as Scorpius summoned the waiter and asked him to owl it immediately; when he went on to ask for the bill, the waiter glanced at Draco, who shook himself and nodded. It wasn't until the bill had been brought to the table that Draco finally spoke.
Draco winced, and Harry was startled to feel a brief surge of sadness deep inside his chest. He somehow knew it was Draco's emotion rather than his own, and suddenly wondered what Draco could feel of his emotions.
They stood there for a moment, totally naked in the middle of a field in the Yorkshire Dales, and stared appreciatively at each other; the separation only lasted a minute, however, before they were kissing desperately, their hands exploring every piece of exposed skin they could reach. Their erections were repeatedly pressed together, and the sensation was almost too much to bear.
Draco looked up at him with watery eyes. "You'd better do it again," he said, smiling raggedly. "Because I'd been thinking about it for quite a while, but I would never have been brave enough to actually try it. Turns out that being with a bona fide hero has unexpected benefits."

"They'll want to know whether our feelings for each other only started with the bond, or whether either of us fancied the other before that," Harry said confidently. "I know how their minds work, I promise you."
"I can understand that," said Harry. "I had to do a lot of cooking when I was a child, but I hated it. Probably because I was never allowed to eat what I'd cooked, and the people who I was cooking for never said anything good about it. So I can cook pretty well, but it usually feels like a chore. It was only when I started cooking for Teddy that I realised it could be fun."
"Remember that whole not talking about the past thing?" said Harry, but he was smiling. "Please don't call me Potter; it makes me think you're Malfoy, who I went to school with. You know, the one who hated me. Draco and Harry are different people."
"No, of course not," said Draco. "I was keeping a very careful eye on it, just in case, but none of them even tried. I'd be interested to know whether or not they would have given it a go if James hadn't been sitting right there, mind you. Anyway, when he

she was thinking, bringing him for Christmas. Well, it was awful. Everyone was really polite, but you could cut the atmosphere with a knife. The poor guy had no idea what was going on, but I think we must have scared him away. Never saw him again."
Harry grinned at Draco, his head tilted to one side in an obvious challenge.
"No," said Draco. "Muggle gay blokes do, because of sexually-transmitted diseases, but none of those seem to affect wizards. At least, there have never been any known cases."
them," he admitted. "I promise I won't try to speak to them. I do want to try and wait until Ginny can be here for that. But I sort of feel as if I'll feel better if I can reassure myself that they all definitely look fine at the moment, before their world gets torn apart."
The room in which they arrived was small but cosy. Bookshelves lined three of the walls, interrupted only by windows and the door. There were two armchairs by the fireplace, but the main piece of furniture was the desk under the window, which held a computer, printer and many piles of paper.
"Embarrassed? Why?" asked Ron.
Draco was determined to beat Harry's challenge. "You just wanted some peace and quiet in the countryside. Or to do some walking," was his first guess.
Draco sighed. "Well, this will sound as if I'm feeling sorry for myself, and I'm not really," he said. "Especially not

"Well, it's so that we don't end up with the same problem we have now," explained Lyudmila. "Unfortunately it's almost certain that the patients' condition will get worse, and they will need increasing amounts of care. With two nurses, we can arrange it so that at least one of them will always be available, whatever the time of day or night, and they'll still both be able to have regular breaks. They'll sort that out between the two of them, don't worry. Of course, there may occasionally be unforeseen circumstances that mean that both of them are elsewhere and you have to be here yourselves, but hopefully at least this way we will free Mr Malfoy of some of his burden."
“I am too, as ever, Molly,” added Hermione. “You know how much I like to discover new spells, and it’s almost always you I get them from these days.”
"I live in Sorrento, on the west coast of Italy. I'm an interpreter mainly, but I also do a bit of written translation."
"I definitely prefer the regular hours I have now," said Ron. "That was the worst thing about being an Auror - getting called in at all hours, even on weekends, with no notice, and often for a complete waste of time. And, MERLIN, don't get me started on the paperwork."
"I can already see why it's worth coming here," commented Draco a few minutes later. "The sky looks incredible, and we're not even out of twilight yet. I can't wait to see what it's like when it's properly dark."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco smiled and got up from the piano stool, taking Harry's hand as they set off across the room. "We do have enough rooms that you can have your own once the bond has settled, if you prefer, and if of course you choose to stay here," he said. "But my bed is very comfortable, and you're welcome to sleep in it for as long as you like."
Harry laughed. "I'll take that as a compliment," he said. "I did it myself, but rest assured it's the only thing I know how to do to my hair. A barber suggested I should try it like this years ago, and I realised I quite liked it, so I made him show me how to do it. I don't do it very often, though – I like the look of it, but not the feel, at least not after the first few hours."

"I feel like we’re on top of the world," said Harry. "Anyway, I suppose we should talk about this stupid curse. Or whatever it is."
Draco continues his Messiah explanation.
"I could tell neither of you were sleeping, actually," said Ron. "But I figured you'd talk about it when you were ready, and until then there was no need to burden you with the fact that I couldn't either. It helped quite a bit that I knew it was happening to all three of us, though. And you know what, Harry? Your new touchy-feely-ness has made a difference too."
"You mean the Nutcracker soldier?" said Draco. "I was just thinking the same thing. That's about the sixth one we've seen since we arrived! That crepe stall has one, but so did that stall with the woolly hats, and the one with the hog roast, and... well, I forget, but there were others."
"See you in a few minutes," said Harry eventually, and Draco smiled and Apparated.
Ron stopped mid-sentence, and he and Hermione both stared at Harry. "What d'you mean? What d'you think's happening right now? You talk to us all the time!"
Harry laughed, and Draco enjoyed feeling the vibration of his chest. "I'm glad I wasn't a dream as well," Harry said. "How do you feel? You've been asleep for
Hermione sat down next to Draco. "Not that I usually condone violence, but I have to admit that it was very satisfying at the time," she said. "Sorry, though. It was wrong of me. Can I offer you some mulled wine?" She lifted a decanter and waved it enticingly.
"I like it here," said Harry, after they'd stood in silence in the darkness for a couple of minutes. "I think I'd like to live somewhere like this."
"Well, I'm very happy for you both," said Hermione. "And I'm sure you're keen to go off and do things that are oddly exciting to think about, but you
Having done this, Harry resumed his previous activity of stirring the contents of the oil vats – there were actually two, one of which was full of chips – while talking to Ron and Hermione. Draco couldn't hear what they were saying, but was fascinated to see that the woman at the till was still not doing any work, and none of the customers seemed upset at their wait. Then it dawned on him.
"Thank you," said Draco. "I can't tell you how grateful I am."
quiet - he's just thinking. Which is what I wanted him to do, so it's all good. I don't want to push him."
At four o’clock the next afternoon, Draco and Rabia were waiting in the wings at the Barbican concert hall as the fifth recital ended (with an unnecessarily operatic version of
"Well, I do, for a while… but I like you with your clothes off even more," Harry said. "Plus, I owe you an orgasm."
"That's a new one on me, mate," said the other. "Maybe she's not from round here. But it might be just in her head. She's been going on about dropping her wand since we got here, hasn't she? Definitely concussion and shock, and probably hypothermia as well by now. No point expecting her to make any sense."
Draco frowned, and then reached for his wand, still naked. He used it to write glowing words in the air.
"I had no idea," said Harry. "I'm very flattered. I don't think I've ever been anyone's secret love before."
At first, when I saw this prompt, my mind went totally blank. But then I laughed out loud as I realised it was the easiest one so far \o/
"You did all that you could, and considerably more than I had expected you to," Mr Ollivander assured him. "And I always thought it quite fitting that it was your wand that ended the war. Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. I never heard what became of it, though; did you ever get it back?"
"Yes, there's a buffet," said Oliver, "but can we get moving now, please? Neither of you are speaking until the end, so it'll be at least half an hour till then, but I need to get you to your places."
Alzheimer's. More or less, anyway. There's a version of it called early-onset Alzheimer's. But the chances of them both getting that naturally are tiny, so I think it must have been at least partially caused by either spell damage or a curse."

He was sure he was blushing all over, but Harry certainly seemed to be enjoying the view if the expression on his face was anything to go by, so Draco felt encouraged to continue.

"No, not just yet," said Draco. "I was due to be here till next Friday, and the new plan is that Harry and I will spend next week teaching together. I'm looking forward to that. But I do have a job at Beauxbatons, and their term starts next weekend, so I'll have to go then. If you'll all excuse me, though, I'd better get to my place before I miss all the food."
Prompt 25: Mistletoe
"Mr Draco Malfoy to see you," she said. "And you look as if you need more coffee. I’ll bring some in. Or would Mr Malfoy prefer tea?"
Draco walked out onto the stage to polite applause; as usual, he dreamed - for just a second - of a day when the mere sight of him would whip audiences up into a frenzy, but in the meantime he was perfectly content with his aim of ensuring that their reaction would be considerably more enthusiastic after they'd actually heard him sing. Currently he knew that the appreciative murmurs were mainly for the female soloists' posh frocks - the soprano was in a full-length clingy silver number, while the alto had gone for waves of midnight blue - but he felt good in his own full white tie outfit, although felt a bit guilty that the bass was only in black tie. As he bowed, he recalled Harry's outfit at the Yule Ball all those years earlier, and smiled.
"In that case, I definitely know the answer," said Hermione. "The next step needs to be that you take a break. It's not like you need the money desperately. But I can see now that you
"Yes. More people should hear you," said Hermione. "Have you ever thought of performing in public?"

Ginny went back to her seat, grinning, as Draco looked at Harry in amazement.

Harry laughed. "Yes, that was a bit of an unpleasant surprise. But it's actually not

Half an hour later, Harry decided that he was in heaven. He was on his settee in front of a cosy fireplace. Christmas songs were playing quietly on the radio. Draco was snuggled up beside him with his head on Harry's shoulder and Harry's arm holding him close. With his other hand, Harry was running his fingers through Draco's amazingly soft hair (something he'd been secretly dying to do since the age of eleven). The fish and chips had been eaten and the wrappings disposed of. Harry had considered having a shower to get rid of the perennial smell of grease and cooking oil, but he didn't want to leave Draco, and although he allowed himself to daydream for a moment about possible future shared showers, he didn't want to rush things. In any case, there was lots of snuggling he wanted to do first.
stop them if you mentioned it, though, don't you?" Hermione pointed out.
At that moment, a house-elf popped into the hall with a huge tray full of bacon butties and a jug of coffee.
"I'm sorry," Harry said, when the weeping seemed to be subsiding. "But you did suspect that would happen, didn't you?"
"Neither have I," said Kingsley. "But I suspect it may be something to do with the fact that there was already a bond in place."
"How the hell are your reflexes still that good, damn you?" grumbled Draco. "Typical."

"We did. I said she can keep the house – I have these quarters, and I stay here most of the time anyway, so it's not urgent for me to find somewhere else. I'll have to get a flat or something for the holidays, because I need somewhere that the kids can stay with me – we agreed that they can all spend their time with whichever of us they want to. I
Hermione rolled her eyes. "You two are such a pair of heathens, but I wouldn't have it any other way," she said. "Shall I set the table?"
"Weren't there? You'd be surprised," said Ron. "Did I never tell you what happened that year? Ginny brought a bloke home. She'd only met him a few days before – I don't know

perfect'," said Draco, as the applause from that song died down. "Well, anyone who knows him knows that although none of us are perfect, Harry comes closer to it than most. But of course there are always going to be darker times, and problems to be overcome - my history with Harry is full of those, and although I'm confident history won't repeat itself, I'd like to think that if it did then we'd get through it together. This beautiful song is for those moments. It's by a group called REM and it's called 'Everybody Hurts'." Rabia had already started playing the arpeggiated figure very quietly, and with these words she increased the volume as Draco started to sing.
At five past four, Harry was speed-walking through the gift shop of the Victoria and Albert Museum. (He'd tried to run, but got such a glare from the security guards that he thought he's better not.) The museum was busy, and he had to weave his way through the crowds looking at the sculptures in the hall after the gift shop, but eventually he burst out into the courtyard. This was much quieter – apparently not many people wanted to sit outside in December – and Harry spotted Malfoy immediately.
come back, and would keep coming back until Draco talked to him, so he needed to come up with a plan of action. Just as soon as he'd had some sleep.
Harry and Draco both laughed. "It doesn't, but I can see what you mean," said Harry. "This is American chocolate? Ours is much better."
"I love it when a plan comes together," said Hermione, with a giggle. "Hood up, Draco!"
"It's a deal," said Draco. "And thank you. Goodnight, Harry."
"I have," said Draco. "Since a few months after the war. I think, at first, I was actually trying to punish myself – I thought I didn't deserve to be with wizards. But it wasn't as bad as I'd expected it to be, once I'd got used to it."
"He's really good," said Harry, smiling at Draco. "He's a brilliant pianist, and he's got a lovely voice. Draco, I meant to ask you about those songbooks you have. They're all a particular type of song, aren't they? But is there a name for that type of song... other than 'old'?"
"I go for Sunday lunch every week or two," said Draco. "I sometimes have to work on a Sunday, but I do try to visit them when I don't. And they're fine, thank you for asking. I thought they'd have hated having to stay in the Manor forever, but they seem OK with it. They do seem to walk in the grounds a lot more than they ever used to, though."
"All sorts of things," said Draco. "Other oratorios, opera arias, Lieder, musical theatre, pop songs... just anything that's good music. I... could sing something for you now, if you like?"
"Which brings me to my final point," Harry said, triumphantly. "I agree that you'd have to pay me, because me making arrangements as your boyfriend wouldn't have the same impact as me making arrangements as your paid PA. But I wouldn't expect a very high rate at first, because I'd have no experience. We could negotiate an increasing rate - maybe my pay could be a percentage of your overall income? But also I was thinking that there might be some other musicians you know who might need a similar service. Eventually I'd probably want to spend all my time on you, but initially it wouldn't be a full-time job, and doing some stuff for others would help me get better at doing stuff for you."

"I'm pretty sure they'll be thrilled too," James told him. "Can I tell them, or would you rather do it yourselves?"
Albus beamed at him. "I am," he said simply. "It's only my dad that's not, and hopefully he'll get there soon."
Harry looked at McGonagall in surprise, and she raised her hands in confession. "Guilty as charged," she said. "And, before you ask, I should warn you that Mr Finnigan's NEWT students are extremely excited, and they have been telling everyone at Hogwarts what's about to happen.

His skin wasn't as pale as Harry had expected, but it did appear to be entirely hairless; on closer inspection, however, a very thin covering of hair was visible on Draco's arms and legs. His chest and flat stomach were hair-free, and his nipples were more prominent than Harry's; they were actually standing out from his chest, and Harry could only tear his eyes from them with considerable effort. The thought of Draco's groin was what caused him to manage this feat; when he looked down, he noted that Draco's arse was as slim as the rest of him. The buttocks were of course covered by the towel, but Harry was prepared to guess that they could be described as 'pert'; most excitingly, though, there was

"They're usually just called 'standards'," said Draco. "Strictly the full term is 'jazz standards'. They're songs that any jazz musician would be expected to know. Lots of them are showtunes, but really any song can end up being known as a standard. The only factor common to all of them is longevity."

"I believe that can be arranged," Draco told him solemnly, and flipped him onto his front.
Harry pulled him into a hug for a moment, and then kissed his forehead before setting off towards the main street, pulling Draco with him. He thought could almost hear Draco's heart beating fast, and squeezed his hand supportively. Just as he heard Draco take a long deep breath, they stepped through the gap in the wall near Ollivanders.
Draco smiled at him again at this, and Neville stared at them both searchingly. "So I see," he said after a moment, grinning. "Who'd have thought it? Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, the best of friends."
"And is Rabia playing the piano for you or are you using backing tracks? It'll be a bit much for her if she's doing a solo spot as well, won't it?"
"It's not
There was another knock, and then the door opened slightly and Ron poked his head through the gap. "Harry? Draco?" he called. Upon getting no response, he stepped into the room. He noticed the steam emerging from the bathroom. Before the next moan, though, his spotted the red hoodie on Draco's bed and rolled his eyes.

"That's good to hear, although I'm surprised the proportions are that way round," said Harry.
"It's adorable, the way you are with her," said Harry, starting to remove his clothes. "I would never have pictured you as a cat person. Or a dog person, for that matter. I don't suppose you had either at the Manor, did you? What made you get a cat?"
"Well, maybe it wasn't entirely your fault," said Draco. "But we can discuss that later. Begin at the beginning. You went home last night. Was she there when you arrived?"
"Professor Malfoy, please may I go to the toilet?"
of your legendary enmity, even if you have to fake it!"
Draco decided not to risk jumping in front of him again, so he settled for tilting his head to the side and raising his eyebrows. "And what do you hope to gain from this, may I ask?"
Harry sat on the piano stool as Draco played the last few chords, and leaned his head on Draco's shoulder. "Did you mean all of that?" he asked, not daring to look at Draco's face as he did so.
"So you left a trail of broken-hearted women behind you, did you?"
"You are. And you'll be slightly proud, I think - at least I hope so! That was my condition for agreeing to be at the Ministry's beck and call for the bid. The
Draco nuzzled his head under Harry's chin. "I don't know," he admitted. "I hadn't really thought that far ahead. The research project ended, so staying on Novaya Zemlya wasn't an option. I did consider staying somewhere else in Russia, since I'd learned the language and everything, and it was a pleasant enough place – and, more importantly, no-one was giving me a hard time. But I really missed England, even though none of my friends were here."

But I've kept thinking about it ever since you asked me to go there for Christmas.

Harry grinned, relieved. Then he frowned, suddenly worried. "You won't tell them it was my suggestion, though, will you?" he asked. "I don't want people to think that's why you're doing it."
Harry thought about it. "It was exactly a month ago today, actually," he said, realising.
"Sad but true," said Harry, although he was pleased to hear such praise of his son. "Albus and Scorpius are really good when they're together, I have to say, and the rest of the team aren't far behind them." He noticed Neville grin and then quickly straighten his face.

"Will you allow me to stay here? Ideally for the full two weeks – because, as I mentioned, I need the money – but at least until you're feeling well enough to resume your lessons."
Draco and Harry had continued to share the bed each night, but there had been no physical contact between them. From the number of times that Draco had caught Harry staring at him, though, he was hopeful that it was only a matter of time before the right moment presented itself. Hopeful in both senses of the word, in fact, because it was being increasingly difficult to find opportunities to wank. (Draco had actually been forced to restrict the number of times

"It's a... really old TV... haha! ... comedy sketch," she explained, in between gales of laughter. "I think it must have been from before we were born, but it was my dad's favourite. Every so often it would turn up on TV in some compilation show or other, and we'd always end up crying with laughter. The thing is, it wasn't even that funny, it was watching my dad that was the best bit. I never saw him laugh as much as he did when that sketch was on. He used to recite every word. Four candles? No, four candles!"

then – was just what I needed, and I'm grateful that you were here to give it to me. Plus, I'm not at all sure how they'll react to the news that Ginny's been seeing someone else," said Harry, looking suddenly worried.
Draco grinned. "I am," he admitted apologetically. "But it can wait until I've talked to you about it, Hermione."

A similar routine followed for all the other customers in the queue, which cleared remarkably quickly, until finally it was Ron and Hermione's turn. As they paid for their food, Harry, who'd been leaning on the counter watching proceedings since he'd finished frying fish, spoke up. "I'll probably come round tomorrow or the day after, if that's OK. As soon as I've decided what to do."
"Ohhhh," said Harry. "I've just remembered – when you first mentioned
They actually put some clothes on in this chapter :-)
Harry grinned. "I plan to!" he promised. "Just wake me up when winter's over."

"Sorry I'm a bit late," he said, when he reached the table. "I always forget how big this place is. Or how far it is from the tube."
"Ha! In that case I win, Hermione," said Ron. "The answer to
"I think I quite like the idea of him being my manager, actually," said Draco. "The other titles don't make him sound quite as important, and that wouldn't feel appropriate."
. Or how many times he looks down at your cock." Harry laughed. "I feel a bit bad, actually. I've never had a conversation quite like that with him. I think he realised as soon as he said it that he'd insisted I have an argument with him while I was naked, but he couldn't bring himself to end it."
to be in the Slytherin common room back in
(Draco may or may not have gone to sleep still thinking about that smile.)
"That's the main reason I wanted to talk to you both about this," said Draco. "Harry's had this idea about what he wants to do with his life, and I was unsure at first, but he's very persuasive, and I've been thinking about it since last night and I can't think of any reasons why it won't work. And if anyone can, I think it'll be you two, so if you both like the sound of it then I'm going to go for it."
to each other."
A second later, he was sprawling on the dew-damp grass, having tripped over the side of his own chair.
"I'd been to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall," said Draco. "I go to quite a few concerts. I've become quite a fan of classical music over the last few years, and
"I don't think I'm crying just because of that, though," said Harry, closing his eyes. "I'm just... I feel like such a failure at life. And I feel so
"Do you remember that lesson we had at school when we were supposed to be doing a proper meteor observation, and recording magnitude and direction and all that sort of thing, but then we all forgot our clipboards every time a meteor appeared, and everyone was just going

, and I'm finding you very easy to talk to. We have a connection, I think."
Harry grinned and hugged him. "It's good to see you," he told him. "It's been a while, hasn't it? Sorry about that. Perfect timing, though. I'm just thinking about making a meal."
"Hermione!" scolded Ron. "You can't just invite yourself to his flat!"
Draco nodded. "Maybe, but even that's a bit unusual," he said. "By the time you're at music college entry level, you're expected to be a pretty high standard already. Anyway, whatever the reason, they did let me in, and my life started to improve from that point. The more I sang, the more I felt better about myself. And the course made us all perform regularly – just small events at first, but the amount of time on stage gradually increased. Then, at the end of my second year, I got the chance to sing Gerontius."
A luminous badger burst out of the end of his wand; it landed on the floor and looked up at him expectantly. "Go to Ron Weasley and tell him that Harry and Draco will be arriving in a few minutes," Teddy told it, and it immediately scampered effortlessly through the wall and vanished.
"Lucky for you you've got such an incredible body, or I might be tempted to storm off in a huff," grumbled Harry. "Speaking of which, I really want to fuck you, but I'm getting sleepy and I want to be able to give that my full attention, so maybe not tonight. But please can I suck your cock?"
searched for that many times, but it was unsurprisingly hard to spot. (Draco said something about "just like in Seekers Notes", but just laughed when Harry asked what he was talking about.) It turned out to be in a corner of the windowsill in Sirius's old bedroom, which Harry used as one of several guest rooms, although he admitted he couldn't remember the last time anyone had stayed over.
"Just look at all those lights," muttered Draco to himself. "Ridiculous. What a waste of energy. And the stars are invisible!"
– they both lay on their beds chatting, which had become part of their nightly routine. Then Harry suddenly realised that he was still wearing Draco's cashmere jumper.
Harry was transfixed. Draco had sounded more or less like the Draco he remembered from school, all the time they'd been talking, but now there was this resonant, powerful singing voice, and it felt as if it was tugging directly on Harry's emotions. And he
Neville looked startled and then laughed. "I'm afraid so," he said. "At least, it's fairly common knowledge, I think. I'm surprised you didn't cotton on earlier, to be honest. You're OK with it, though?"
"That won't do at all," said Harry gravely. "Stickiness should always be avoided."

"Time to be illegal again," said Harry, his eyes twinkling. He wrapped his arms around Draco and Apparated them to Grimmauld Place.
"Round five in the shower it is," agreed Harry, kissing him on the forehead. "And afterwards, if we can still walk, I quite fancy going out for a bit of fresh air – are you up for that?"
Hermione had just punched him again. "Stop it," she scolded. "Don't pay any attention to Ginny. I promise I'll tell you if I think you're getting too big for your boots. And, for your information, I've

Draco grinned. "You're not the only one," he said. "Speaking of which, I have a bit of a fantasy that I'm hoping you can help me with. Please will you stand on top of the sleeping bag?"
me. Oh, God – d'you think the kids know?"
Ron laughed. "She was less surprised than anyone," he said. "She said she knew there was something not working when his kisses did nothing for her. She was relieved to find it wasn't because of anything she'd done wrong. Anyway, she's been with Neville for a long time now."
"I agree with Ron – you shouldn't have to," said Draco. "But I can understand why you don't want to report them. I've got an idea, though. Give me your hoodie."
. I really do feel much better about Christmas since I stopped bothering with them."
"Welcome to the family," said Draco, shaking his hand.
. I didn't realise it till this week, but I think it's been in the back of my mind for a while. But I wouldn't have dared say anything, because I never dreamed you might think of me that way."
"Where have you been?!" demanded Hermione. "You said an hour! We were just about to start searching for you!"
"I know," said Harry, a bit brokenly. "It's just... I'm still trying to get used to the thought that any of this is happening. The Ginny in my head is my faithful wife, and I have to keep reminding myself that the

Seamus made a few comments when they started to get really big, but he stopped when he saw how uncomfortable it made me - I always tried not to draw attention to them after that, though.

Like everything about you."

"I kissed lots of people at school, but only really at parties – I wasn't going out with any of them," said Draco. "But I only slept with two. Both in sixth year, and both were drunken one-offs. The first was Pansy. The second was Blaise."
Harry laughed. "We're going to have to have a conversation sometime about your newfound knowledge of Muggle pop culture," he said. "But, great. Let's go. Do you want to Apparate us?"
"The thing is, I don't really understand what they actually
Draco's songs:

Harry grinned impishly. "That could be arranged," he said, hooking a thumb into the waistband of his boxer briefs - the only thing he was wearing apart from a Santa hat at a jaunty angle. "Actually I was just about to get changed when I heard your voice. Draco's almost ready - I was waiting until he'd finished in the bathroom."
Draco suddenly wondered whether or not Potter lived here alone. It certainly looked that way, but it did seem unlikely. What had happened to the Weasley girl? Draco had assumed that there would be mini-Potters by now. Mini-Weasleys too, in fact; it occurred to him that he had no idea whether or not Weasley and Granger had any children. Surely Granger would have said so, if there were any?
"Yes! All those sex books
"Harry's right, though. There wasn't really anything you
got something planned. Which particular plan are you curious about, though?" asked George, who had appeared the moment they stepped into the shop. Harry, not for the first time, wondered whether George had some sort of spell that enabled him to do this.
Draco grinned. "Just as well you didn't mention that, or I would've had to leave in a huff," he said. "Now, can we please get back to the original topic? Let me sum up: the Ministry are taking advantage of your good nature by asking you to travel all over the world for the World Cup bid despite you having a very time-consuming job, because they know that you know that no-one other than you will have the same impact, because you're the only Brit that most of the other national Quidditch associations have heard of, so you don't want to say no because you hate the thought of letting people down. How am I doing so far?"
Weasley and Granger looked at each other, eyebrows raised. Then they both looked back at Draco and grinned.
"But... She has no other way of contacting you, you idiot," Draco protested. "Do you really want me to go back to her and tell her that her husband refused to come and help her?"
"I'm not stupid, Dad. It's pretty obvious when you go into a room and the people in it are in the middle of a conversation, and you two

"That makes sense," said Harry. "But, just so you know... I think falling in love is definitely going to be an option. Especially if Cole Porter carries on being such an enabler."
"I suppose so," said Harry. "Then, yes please, I'd love to hear you sing. Do you have anything I might have heard before? You know, so I can compare you to the experts?"
Several hours later, Harry and Draco were in bed, naked limbs thoroughly entangled as they lay there getting their breath back from a lengthy burst of activity. Draco's head was on Harry's chest, and he was idly fondling various parts of Harry's body.
"I have a new favourite bit," announced Hermione. "We both said at the interval that our favourite bit was the first thing you sang, but then there were so many amazing bits in the second half... but I think my favourite was that bit at the end when you finally sang with the choir. You were smiling through the whole thing, and the other soloists were kind of glaring a bit, and it really showed the difference."
is it?"
"Oh, please. Everyone knows you grew up in a Muggle household. And every British Muggle household has an electric kettle. I don't believe for a second that you've got a kettle that doesn't have a plug."
"Well, if you end up doing that with me I won't take it personally, don't worry. Anyway, you're going to be late for your Quidditch practice if you don't get a move on. When's the first match?"
"Oh, I see," said Harry. "Well, I like to get things right, so thank you for telling me that. But, go on... what else do you sing?"
"Anything," said Draco.

must have removed it, because otherwise he'd still be hiding at Gringotts. But the fact remains that I used the curse on him and then forgot about him. And, not only that, but I'd totally forgotten about the whole thing until today.
"Well, thank you very much! I'm pleased you like them. When do you want to do this, by the way? Soon, I presume?"
"You're comfortable holding onto me?" was what Draco got from that, but he refrained (with some effort) from saying so. Instead, he said: "It's no problem. So where's this campsite?"
"You deserve that too, you know," said Draco. "I'm sorry you're stuck with me instead."
Teddy grinned. "Well, I don't actually do much other than boss around the prefects and have meetings with McGonagall, but it'll look good on my CV, won't it?"
"Coffee would be lovely, thank you," said Draco, when she turned to him.

This caused both Draco and Harry to burst out laughing again. "More toast and coffee would be lovely, please," said Harry, and Draco nodded. "I'm not much of a tea person. And thank you for feeding us. You're an excellent cook."
He faked deliberation; he was a godawful liar, but manufacturing a pregnant pause wasn’t too difficult. “Jessie,” he said eventually. “I’m going to vote for Jessie.”
Harry melts. So does Draco.
“I know,” Draco said, walking away. “The git’s barmy anyway. Got a screw or two loose. The way he reacted isn’t on you. I’m just sensitive to that stuff: the screaming and the night terrors.”
“Oh, so you want Matilda?”
), and then he jumps.
Draco nodded. “Split up and search.”
Technically, they were there because of Draco’s research on ancient cultural artifacts. He and Hermione had been working for years on a theory that linked unique historical sites to the Earth’s magical core. The idea was that magic, like electric charge, was everywhere, and that wizards simply harnessed it by creating a magnetic pull on the magic in the air. This pull created potential energy, which could then be translated into mechanical energy in the material world and used to perform spells.
Harry pounces, dropping his weight across the entirety of Draco’s body and pressing a wet, sloppy kiss to his mouth.
Pansy had booked them a month-long stay in Fiji. According to the brochures in the lobby, it was a beautiful country, but Harry and Draco had spent very little time away from the bed, jacuzzi, spa, or restaurant. Draco had even convinced Harry to get a massage with him, but the fool had gone straight to the gym afterwards, and Draco had needed to give him another, more personal back rub when he wrenched his shoulder. “Well, I thought it was pretty self explanatory that you can’t exercise after having every muscle in your body pulverized!” he had scolded, and then proceeded to fuck the git into the matress.
Draco nudged Harry and shook his head. “I liked his character. He really does look happy here though, doesn’t he?”
”I think everyone is in need of a little
With this letter, I have sent you Dr. Bulstrode’s contact address and a piece of parchment that you can write your Floo address on. I will not see it, but it will transfer itself into my secretary Monica’s address ledger to enable communication while respecting your privacy. She will then send you the testing kit. There is an Unspeakable-strength Privacy charm on the ledger, so she can’t memorize any Floo address in it.
“Right. Well, we’d better get going,” Harry said, stepping backwards again. “We’ll bring the terrarium over after work, if that’s alright, Hagrid?”
,” Isabelle repeated. “Draco, it’s talking about the creek. We’ve got to follow the creek upstream. Come on!”
Draco didn’t have to worry in the end-- Claire did make her own decision, choosing to cast her final parchment for Harry, and the Tribal went to the obligatory firemaking competition. Draco spent more time watching the faces of the Jury than the contestants. Iz gave him a thumbs up, pointing to her neck to acknowledge his challenge win and tapping her feet excitedly. CJ studied Harry and Jessie’s A-frames, eyes darting back and forth astutely. Tara, as usual, was staring off in the distance. To the untrained eye, it might have looked like patient civility, but Draco knew better. Lonnie urged Harry on with a smile on his face. Jones just glowered.
"But that’s just it! I don’t want to have
He leads Draco towards Greek Row after dropping their bags off in their room. The shortcuts between buildings are unlit and unpaved, and crickets sing in the trees above.
“Don’t forget the weather,” Harry pointed out, watching as Ichabod sat stoically in his new surroundings.
When my magical core first started to become abnormal, I learned ways to hold it inside of me and prevent it from casting spells, but the buildup of magical potential energy was excruciating, so I soon gave up the practice. I can only describe the feeling as a mixture of muscle convulsants, ecstasy, red-bull, adrenaline, and mortal peril. Now, I am forced to allow my magic to flow and interact with my environment-- even though I often cannot control it.
Nearly the entire camp was awake, but no one was saying anything. The space felt lethargic and dogmatic. Doug was chopping coconuts in the corner, his face blank as he focused on the rhythmic task. Lindsay and Tara huddled next to each other in the far back of the shelter, their hair framing their faces in an uncanny resemblance to wet spaniels. Ian, as well as a man who worked as a lawyer, appeared to be faking sleep, but the cadence of their breaths gave them away. Draco was sandwiched between Isabelle and Harry, and Harry shifted to wrap his arms around Draco’s shoulders. Ever since he was a child, he had been sensitive to cold, always complaining to his mother that the Manor was far too chilly. Harry, on the other hand, ran hot.
Jeff greeted them with a winning cheese, but as he launched into the rules and requirements, Harry leaned to whisper in Draco’s ear.
Draco freezes, his limbs going tense around Harry’s waist. “Harry? Do you want to move in with me?”
“I based my decision based on how I felt I would have voted. Since my values in the game are social skills, reliability, and personability, I felt Harry was the biggest threat to my game and the closest player to my style, whereas I didn’t feel I would have voted for you if I were on the Jury.”
Unbeknownst to all but a few amused colleagues, a pale, pointy brit watches on, eyes glued to the host and boasting a blush of his own.
Day 24
Malfoy giggles, speaking in huffs between irrepressible grins. “I tripped over nothing. The notch only appeared when you caught me.
Even with the wind and distant crash of waves, the grating growl of unfinished ceramic rubbing against itself drowned Draco’s senses as the lid of the urn was peeled off. “This has been nothing if not an exciting evening. Shall we get to reading the votes?” Jeff said.
It was bold of her to mention Jones outright, but Draco thought it was rather smart. Claire had proved she could be gentle and appease a crowd; now she wanted to prove that she knew how to use it. It came across more authentic than anything else she had ever said.
She smiles. “Ah. Well, we certainly do that sort of magical landscaping. I’m happy to schedule you an appointment for a quote.” She rummages through a file cabinet behind the front desk, and comes up with a battered day planner. “What’s your timeframe?”
That night’s Tribal Council convinced Draco that he really
Draco smiled, sappy and genuine. “Yeah. Yeah I do.”
In the books, what repeated act of accidental magic did Harry perform as a child?
“Don’t worry, we can bring his terrarium over later,” Harry said. “Hagrid, there was glamour over his terrarium, are you sure you don’t know who you bought him from?”
Day 35
was the type of moment Draco had been looking forward to.
As you and I have a fraught past with each other, I would like to bring in the help of my psychology mentor, Dr. Cordelia Bulstrode, Millicent’s aunt. She is a Squib, so she studied psychology at a Muggle institute, but she still knows about the War and is part of the wizarding community. I already spoke with her, and she would gladly make an appointment with you if you choose to do so. She would give me a generalized emotion profile (only things you consent to let me know) and do ordinary trauma therapy with you, which I think could help you learn to manage and de-escalate when your magic goes hay-wire.
“Just sometimes,” he says, “I think I do.”
He takes the back door to his dorm in hopes he doesn’t run into anyone he knows, but luck must be against him because he quite nearly trips over his crying roommate, crumpled over on the steps.
A tribe swap? An idol? A villain? Oh my!
“I can win against you, too. Besides, I’d rather lose than let her get one vote.” Draco let the familiar posh flavour of indignation colour his vowels.
“Potter, I’m not sure that’s a great-- I mean, you can, but not with--”
“Castaways,” Jeff started, “welcome to your first Immunity Challenge. Both teams will navigate a series of wooden obstacles. Each obstacle is on a separate free-floating dock. To reach the next obstacle, one tribe member must dive below the dock they are currently on. There they will untie and retrieve a rope with a weight on the end. The first rope is secured 4 feet underwater, but they will increase in depth up to 15 feet. You will then toss the weighted end of the rope into a hoop on the upcoming obstacle’s raft and drag it towards you until it is close enough to step onto. If anyone falls into the water while attempting to cross an obstacle, they must restart it. The weighted ball at the end of each rope will have a key tied to it. You will collect all six of the keys and use them on the last obstacle to unlock a machete. First to use their machete to cut the twine securing their flag wins. The winner is safe from Tribal Council. Losers, I will see you tonight where one of you will be the first person voted out of Survivor Wa’ab.”
“I suppose she wanted to make a move. She’s young and dumb and figured this was the way to make her mark,” Isabelle reasoned from beside him.
Jeff nodded. “Thank you, Claire. Harry, you can go next.”
He offers her a sheepish grimace. “Sorry, I’ve been up all night doing research-- I think I’ve lost my filter and my sanity.” Standing a little taller, he adds, “I’m building a garden for my boyfriend. He’s moving in.”

“Good,” Malfoy says.
“Should I leave?” he says. “I’ll leave.”
Draco winked. “Behind the waterfall?”

Harry turns in his arms, brushing dirt from his cheekbones. “Are you sure, darling? You’re not on anything, are you?”
So it was no surprise-- a relief, really-- when Harry’s lock came loose and his tile shattered in the lurid sound of initial impact and the delayed tinkle of shards hitting the dirt.
“I believe our rational ideas and our raw instincts often come from the same place, and therefore honoring them can result in very similar outcomes. Both are social strategies that require a significant amount of risk taking, initiative, and relationship building. In order to use either successfully, you need to be brave enough to begin, persistent enough to get it done, and tactful enough to convince others to follow you.

He takes brooms and boats and planes, and the occasional lift in the back of a stranger’s jeep. There is something refreshing about the effort he puts in-- the research and down payments and improvisation. He stands atop peaks and drinks in mountain air; he wades into waves and tastes salt on his lips; he eavesdrops on chatter and birdsong in languages he’ll never know-- and all of it, every second, feels real.
Draco grins. “Just wait til you see the pole.”
“Draco,” Harry started tentatively. They sat on the beach, mild disillusionment charm over them to ward off the film crew. “Claire wants to vote out Isabelle.”
Draco’s neck snapped up, twisting wildly in search of cameras or evesdroppers. “What? No! Why?”
“Really?” Malfoy says. “I’d think it would be the opposite.”
Harry gets Draco to scream-sing along with him. Draco’s white-blond hair bounces as he lifts his arms above his head to dance. The moonlight streams in the window, and the church bell strikes 1AM, and it might just be the best night of Harry’s life.
See you soon,
When they crested the hill overlooking Omis Cave, they stopped short.
Harry, though, had always been infuriatingly good at memorization. He and Draco were a board game couple, and where Draco could kick anyone’s arse at Othello,Wizard’s Chess, and Scrabble, Harry always, always won the matching ones. Christ, he even always won Trivial Pursuit.
“How much do you know?” Harry asks.
“Do you think we’ve done the right thing?” Draco asked, glancing over his shoulder as they headed back up to the castle.
The moment his magic left his wand, a shattering crack reverberated around the clearing. Draco was thrown backwards into Harry’s chest as they both tumbled to the ground. Blinding white filled his vision and he blinked frantically, urging it away. He thought he heard Harry say something behind him, but the ringing in his ears made it impossible to be sure.
Harry’s expression morphes from confused to amused to disgruntled. He throws his hands up. “They’ve got security cameras!”
He frowned. “You can’t know that. Jones is probably back at camp scheming.”
a reassurance!” Draco splutters.
Harry fixes a bubble bath for them both, pouring in just the right amount of lavender potion and testing the water with his foot before helping Draco in. Harry steps in next, drawing Draco to his chest. “You’re pretty,” Draco whispers.
It was decided that Harry would be both the rope thrower and the first out on the obstacles and that Ian would retrieve the deepest rope, but by the time Jeff called them to regroup, Draco hadn’t spoken another word.
Mission save-Draco’s-arse was not going extraordinarily well, but it was going. So far, Harry had taken Doug’s place fishing with Ian twice and told Lindsay that he ‘had some ideas he wanted to share with the alliance, but felt Doug wasn’t listening to him.’ Then, for dramatic appeal, he had pretended to try to speak during one of Doug’s long, meandering stories and apologized meekly when the man heeded him no attention. When Draco saw Marissa and Lindsay turn to each other with curled lips, he almost whooped out loud. They had found the perfect strategy: risk-minimized balls-to-the-walls.
“Yes, I figured. Can’t we figure something out? I really need it by the fifteenth of the month--” he looks up through his lashes, attempting puppy-dog emotional manipulation-- “It’s meant to be a surprise.”
It isn’t surprising when he sends the climb in less than half an hour.
Draco sighed dramatically. “Really, Harry? You could charm a Grindylow. Tell Claire that Jessie has made more big moves in the game, and that, even if they don’t like her, the Jury will respect a player that did whatever they thought was best for their game, regardless of consequences.”
“Arse,” Draco muttered.
“Where!” Harry splutters, breaking into a sprint.
” Harry laughs bright and loud, the sound reverberating through Draco’s chest.
Draco scrunched up his nose in distaste. “Jessie doesn’t deserve to go to the final. She played like a fucking idiot.”
He cut her off. “I just said I would.”

it read.
Draco grins. “I think you must be mistaken, Potter. I want you-- just you-- very much.”
This shouldn’t be news to you. You told me that when Sirius lived in Grimmauld Place he had depression and drank too much firewhiskey. In addition to the residual effects of Azkaban and the grief associated with the loss of your parents, I believe the House itself was contributing to Sirius’s mental health. It preyed on his frustration, traumatic memories, and fear, making him hyper focused on his failure to protect his loved ones. Likely the only reason the house did not attack the two living members of Sirius’s found-family, you and professor Lupin, as it attacked me yesterday, is because the magic in the house sensed that the latent danger you were already in was more harmful to Sirius than any physical damage it could do.
“How do you stand him,” Pansy whispers into Draco’s ear. He just winks.
“I don’t want to promise,” Harry says. “I want to choose. Every day I want to get to choose. Nothing feels better than choosing you.”
“Don’t worry. We’ll get that terrarium taken over to Hagrid tonight and then we can get back to normal,” Harry said as they climbed the steps to the main entrance of the school.
After five minutes, every player was still in the game, no one having opted to eat straight out of the gate. Draco measured the seconds it took for the ball to travel one third of the track, whispering numbers under his breath to the steady chorus of steel rubbing on wood. He placed his second ball carefully, just after the first. He didn’t want them to be equidistant-- more balls would be added soon.
“What--” Harry hesitated-- “What if there just isn’t a Ley Line here. You should have found it by now.”
Yours,
“Okay! Time to cut you off!” Draco said cheerfully, gritting his teeth and yanking Harry away.
Ron had already started on dinner-- a barbeque spread of brats, coleslaw, beans, and sweet potato fries. It smelled delicious; Harry had been living off watermelon and ritz crackers since morning. Hoping Ron and Luna could handle serving the kids, Harry slipped inside through the open screen door.
therapists in business. Every time they would coax a spark to catch, Tara found a way to blow it out. In 20 minutes, they had burned through more kindling than Draco used in a month back home.
I have always been a sentimental person, and this has only been magnified in my adult life. My most effective coping mechanisms to date involve channeling my magic into objects or places of intense emotional significance. For instance, I almost always carry with me a scarf that belonged to my mother. It is essentially a security blanket, but I also circuit magical energy through it as a sort of resistor to slow the speed of the current, and therefore force, that my body creates. This is very inefficient and exhausting, and tends to leave me weak and tired, but it creates a controlled plane that my magical signature can interact with.
Only the space in front of them is bright enough to see, and the corners of the room are fuzzy, as if they could go on forever. A rickety two-railed track stretches from one side to the other, and at the center, directly in front of Harry and Malfoy, a gold and purple carriage-car idles with a quiet purr, awaiting further instruction.
“What’re you doing,” he asks, snuggling closer..
Harry gave them turquoise. It was for the best; there was no point adjusting to a new camp. Isabelle drew turquoise, too, as did Ian. Tara was already yanking an orange bandana over her head, the garish colour clashing horribly with her straw-like hair. Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
“I think so. But the Healers weren’t really sure,” Draco replied. “There was no magical trace or anything, and I couldn’t find Ichabod to bring him with us.”
“I will, then.” Malfoy’s grip on his arm is punishing, and it shouldn’t feel nearly as good as it does. A rush goes through his head when they emerge from the back door of the club and into the quiet. Even with the blaring cab horns and lights of the city, Harry’s ears ring and his skin prickles. Without flashing lights and moving bodies to surround them, Malfoy’s presence is stronger by a hundredfold.
Harry stands. If he’s shaking, he can’t tell.

Day 13
“I had hoped you were a centaur,” Harry says, “come to tell me how to read the stars.”
“Darling, do you want to talk?” he asked, taking Draco’s hand and running his thumb along his wrist in a soothing semi-circle.
Immediately after the War, I fell into a depression that sapped me to my core. I was unable to perform even the simplest of spells, and developed such vertigo when walking or running that I was unable to stand most days without blacking out.
“Well, you see, I’ve had to learn a lot of things rather quickly, with my accounts frozen and my wand snapped. But I’ve just been informed I could have paid my dues by simply ordering someone a drink.”
By the time Draco drags himself out of Harry’s arms and his promises of blueberry pancakes, it’s past ten in the morning. Neville has probably been at his house for an hour.
Suddenly, Draco could
Harry drags Draco to his feet. “Tonight’s the night, then.”
1) I can definitely NOT be present for all your therapy sessions. As much as your trust flatters me, it would be against the ethics of psychotherapy. With the exception of couples therapy or group therapy, you never have someone with whom you have a shared past present in all therapy sessions, not even your spouse, let alone a former classmate with whom you have a fraught past (and whose entitlement and bad handling of a rejection made your life more complicated than it should have been).
and the hours to sundown passed in a blink.
Luna hums as she surveills the garden. “The worms are unhappy that the soil is empty. It’s attracting Wazbries.” Draco decides that just because he’s listening doesn’t mean he has to come up with a reply.
“You know, like, sticking your fingers into the t-nuts. Like, where the shaft of a screw goes. Fuck.”
“Hey, is everything okay?” Harry asks, planting a soothing hand on Draco Malfoy’s back.
Then was CJ. “Claire,” he began, “You were part of the alliance with Jones, but you never made an attempt to play a move against him, even when it became clear he was a threat. Did you consider trying to orchestrate something on your own, or were you committed to stay loyal to him until he inevitably turned on you?”
Day 3
There was also the pervading awareness that he was being watched.
Day 26
Harry blinked in confusion. “Was it… something he did?”
Harry sat beside him in the waning golden hour before late afternoon. A rogue tear streaked his face. “They’re going to vote out Lonnie.”
I’m sorry that I talked so much yesterday. I am embarrassed by my selfish excitement and lack of succinctness. I wish I had let you say more and had not deprived myself of hearing more of your voice.
I sort of fell into working for MACUSA. I had a former FBI agent criminology prof, and he asked me if I would be interested, so I sent in an application. Six months later I was running drills in Quantico. The Magical Defense Bureau got word and pulled me in. If anything teaches you about the human race, magical or otherwise, it’s detective work. I’ve seen more now than my teenage-self ever could have dreamed in their worst nightmares.”
Potter is the first to lean in, cold face and wet clothes, and Draco almost misses it for the sake of the thought that won’t leave his head. He says it into Potter’s lips: “
We can also work with a potion that balances your hormonal situation. I can imagine that the idea of taking a potion might frighten you. However, it makes a difference whether you self-medicate with addictive potions or work with a specialist to analyze your hormonal situation and prescribe against a hormonal deficit. In addition, I have developed a potion dispenser that is charmed to not let more than the daily dose out in one day, and is virtually indestructible.
“I think it’s more than the footing that’s unstable,” Harry added with a short laugh.
Harry leapt out of his seat and into Draco’s arms, kissing him full on the mouth on live public television. Draco kissed him back; half the cast had found out anyway. He checked his watch. In exactly 13 hours, he would be on stage with Hermione and Harry, presenting the greatest leap in magical theory since the 70’s.
He takes two steps forward and hesitates on the third. “What are you doing, Malfoy?” he asks, bitter and commanding. “What’s in your hand?”
He doesn’t quite know how he is able to drag himself up from the dirt, dizzy with exhaustion and teeth chattering, but Harry’s laughter, clear as ever, greets Draco when he stumbles into the living room.
A quick note on a few subjects:
My work with you will focus on the physical and magical level. As I assume you would not want to see me too often,
Harry broke first; he had the highest pain tolerance, the most fervent perseverance of anyone Draco knew, but Draco was lighter. Had it been a game of tenacity, Harry would have won anyday.
“Draco and I,” he burst into another fit, “We’re actually--” more uproarious laughter.
Draco rolls his eyes. “You know that’s not what I was doing.”
“What?”
Draco hums. “Made you a perfect garden. Pulled out all the stops. Can be anything you want.”
“Luna,” Draco greets warmly. “Good to see you!”
“Radical!” Draco purrs. He pulls Harry towards the small booth, whispering something incomprehensible in his ear. Harry makes a choked off noise, nodding vigorously. Fred and Jason look at each other quizzically, shrugging.
Harry knocked on the door and stepped back to wait.
Harry glared and tilted his neck with suspicious affirmation. “If you say so,” he said dubiously, backing up.
“In addition, I was in the minority alliance from the start of the merge all the way until the final five, yet I am still here. This is partly due to my multiple Immunity Challenge wins.
“Oh, Harry,” Malfoy whispers, “I think we’re the only ones who can.”
Draco licks broad stripes across his hole, coaxing his cock with a loose, warm fist, gentle but sure. Sweat beads in the defined hollows on Harry’s lower back, catching the light as he rocks his hips off-rhythm to his moans. Draco sucks, soft at first, but then strong and pulsing, his laps becoming faster and deeper. His chin is slick with saliva, and the backdrop of colorful plastic holds and the hum of a fan blur until all he can see-- all he can hear-- is Harry.
When water was boiling and rice portioned into the pot, Jones sidled into Draco’s blind spot, standing over his shoulder so he had no choice but to remain seated and crane his neck.
He nodded. “I’m not an auror for nothing.”
“Mmm,” Harry responds. It hasn’t occurred to him to begin finding his feet. He hardly knows where they are. “Didn’t notice.”
Jazz, though, is about the notes left unplayed, and the moment Draco steps out on stage, Harry is suddenly very grateful for his severe lack of preparation. Nothing will ever beat the thrill of seeing Draco in a corset for the first time.
He’s wired and fidgety, caught in a cycle of fight or flight that gives the world an odd reflectiveness. For the first time in his life, no one tries to speak to him. There must be something wild in his eyes.
Harry giggles. “Some things never change, I guess.”
Harry shovels a last bite of fudge into his mouth. “Yes,” he says, “we wouldn’t want to make your other boyfriend wait.”
Motivation released, Draco let his muscles go slack. He fell, body tilting backwards away from the pole and towards the sand. Landing with a cry, he lay face up, eyes opening directly into the harsh rays of the sun. He gasped, wind knocked out of him and limbs entirely numb.
“Oh,” Draco says uncomfortably. “Well, then what am I supposed to do? He goes on and on about how he wished he had a proper yard. This isn’t much of one right now, without any greenery.”
“You don’t come everyday after work. You’re always out climbing.”
Harry leaned over and kissed Draco’s cheek. “I know you really like him, so hopefully this will be something we can fix easily.”
“Oh, come off it. I’m excited. This one’s fun,” Draco said over his shoulder.
We have no idea who Prongs was, but it’s most likely that they were a transfigurations student between 1963 and 1967, when, due to a book restoration project at the Merlin College’s library, many university students used the Hogwarts library. However, it could have been a young professor of another subject or (though admittedly unlikely) a Hogwarts student with a solid family background in Transfiguration and Potions.
Both Rai stones were still and dense to the touch. Either they had lost all magic whatsoever, or they had morphed to reflect Draco’s mood.
They Apparated to the waterfall and lay together for far longer than intended, basking in the sound of cicadas and the tropical night breeze. They were both naked, but they remained a few inches apart, their respective hands tracing over the lines of each other's bodies.
“I spent eight years in Hawaii spearfishing! I don’t know why you think you’re so superior that you can waste everyone else's time and energy. You haven’t done jack but lounge and argue since we got to this god-forsaken rock, and now you decide to go fishing and
Everyone needs hobbies. Of everyone, Draco especially needs hobbies. Harry misses him on Friday nights, but he is glad his husband had finally decided to do something besides working (or fucking). There is really only so much time one man could spend on level 9 of the Ministry of Magic before it went from unhealthy to very unhealthy. Draco loves being an unspeakable, but none of the offices have any windows, and he’s Vitamin D deficient as-is.
Harry pushed in beside him. “Hi. I’m Harry,” he beamed. Lonnie’s eyes lit up, and they launched into easy conversation about law enforcement training and youth and chess.
Harry began to shake his head before wincing. “No. The last thing I remember was going upstairs with you.”
“When I do share myself though, I am all in. Rather than finding acquaintances in everyone, I naturally look to form close bonds with a few. I am deeply invested in what I care about.
“What now,” he said with mock exasperation.
Celebrating, apparently, involved talking with Lonnie on the beach. “Go join him! He’s such a joy,” Harry said. “He’ll calm you right down. He’s the wizened mentor that neither of us ever got to have. Well, got to have outside of war zones.”
Draco stumbled to his feet, an undignified yelp escaping his clenched teeth as he attempted to take a step. Iz came up beside him, offering her arm, and he slumped against her with a moan.
“I am an engineer, a scientist, and, at my core, a listener. I don't often go out of my way to share myself with others, but it is important to me to have a strong connection to the word around me. I know you are from New Jersey. I know you live 45 minutes from New York and take your two sons there every month. I know you hate Atlantic City.
“It’s still so strange calling her that, don’t you think?” Draco asked, making a face.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Reward Challenge involved eating bugs. And grubs. And also a pig's brain. According to Harry, a reward of steak kebabs and iced tea was not worth it. Incidentally, Harry also did not seem to care if anyone
Draco made omelettes as Harry moved on to a story about Ron and Ginny having a bitter argument over who would be Bill’s second child’s godparent. Draco knew this story well; once they had started transfiguring the kitchenware into baptism gowns, he had needed to step in to remind them it wasn’t even their decision at all.
“No! The cliff. I bet it’s in the cliff.”
“Thank you, Draco,” she said. “You’ve been very candid. I appreciate the help.” Draco felt a little bad about manipulating her, but, well, he had known what he had gotten himself into, and it wasn’t like Claire was a gullible child. She was shrewd in her own right. It was her decision in the end, he rationalized. Nevertheless, a butterfly emerged from its cocoon in his stomach, reminding him that, by maintaining ulterior motives and playing under false pretences, he was actively affecting other people’s opportunities.
Hermione had used a charm to disguise her accent. Pansy just… hadn’t. The audience would think Harry had an eye for the exotic. Or the eccentric. She sprinted into his arms, nearly toppling him over with the force of it. Peppering little kisses all over his face, she squealed and wrapped her legs around his hips. She watched Draco’s face the whole time. “You smell,” she added into his neck, and Harry took the opportunity to push her away. He dusted off his shirt in mild disdain. “She’s not my spouse, she’s my roommate. She thinks she’s very funny,” he reminded Jeff disgruntledly.
It took nearly an hour but Harry dismantled the booby-trap curses one by one, first by making them visible with a charm that conjured dust that reacted to magical fields, and then by severing the web of spells patch by patch.
“Sorry, Harry, I don’t,” Hagrid replied with a shrug. “He did say he was an exotic species, that’s all I know.”
When it was Lonnie’s turn, he met each contestant with gentle eye contact before settling on Harry. “Harry, in the past 39 days I have come to know you very, very well. What I cannot understand is why you applied to play Survivor. Can you explain to me what you hoped to get out of this experience.”
Actually, I’d like to thank you for sending me that document. From the bottom of my heart, it meant the world to me. I’d tell you why here, but I’d much rather over-share in person than in a letter. I’m sure the scientific community will be very excited. Do try to keep it out of the press though, okay?
“We’re good, then?”
Draco looked around. Time was running short, and the others were catching on, beginning to listen in. “Plan,” he said.
The dulling of his mind had never been more apparent than it was during the third individual Immunity Challenge.
“Stop. Fuck, Draco, stop. Stop right now.”
The rowdy brass of a jazz band dances off the crystals of a chandelier, the beads of condensation on heavy glasses of liquor, the sequins on a flowing curtain. The club is large, but it feels cramped in the red-tinted darkness. Harry sits in the far back on an ostentatious baroque stool, balancing nervously. He takes a hesitant sip of the daiquiri a waiter had urged into his hand-- peach and lime and, honestly, rather horrible. He feels confused, uncomfortable, and impatient all at the same time. On one hand, there are far too many exposed breasts for his liking. On the other, he is starting to have a sneaking suspicion of what Draco had meant when he had asked Harry to attend his ‘recital’.
“Talking with you about—you know—this.”
The sun burns lurid through a broken skylight, refracting off every particle of dust hanging in the air until the room glows golden. In context, the beauty of the day is grotesque.
He nodded in agreement, rising to his feet and shifting his things on the drying rack so the other side faced the sun. “To be fair, I don’t think today's challenge was representative of our physical prowess,” he responded.
Lonnie gave him a long look, his laugh lines crinkling. “I know true love when I see it.”
Harry picked him up, both hands under his arse, and spun him. Green, speckled canopy whirled above his head until it looked like a tornado descending upon them. Draco let the whirling tempest whisk him away. It felt like flying.
Draco just carries on. “That bloody piece of junk was built in the stone age-- the noise it makes, that can’t be right. And what even
“How did you figure it out?” Malfoy asks.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Jason says.
Harry and Draco exchanged glances but followed Hagrid inside nonetheless.
Anyway… are you coming by tomorrow?
“That didn’t help, did it,” Harry says drily. Draco is too far gone to even shake his head.
Harry swallows. “It’s soothing here, grounding. The line between life and death is clean. They meet at a single step. My whole life, it’s been grey. Every day, every decision, I never knew. But right now, I’m choosing to survive.”
Draco inhaled deeply and nodded. “Alright. I think you’re right. I can’t deny it anymore.”
When he catches a glimpse of silver-blond on the dance floor, it’s a blessing in disguise. Draco Malfoy, 19 and haunted, is a vision, and Harry shakes his head to clear the mirage. It doesn’t fade. Malfoy’s face just gets clearer as he nears, his mouth pinching into a scowl through the waves of glimmering heat and fog-machine smoke.
Jeff’s eyebrows raised comically into his hairline. So did Claire’s. It was either a very good sign or a very bad sign. His muscles bunched beneath his clothes and his skin suddenly felt far too tight.
It turned out everyone wanted to vote out Ed, so there was little scrambling in the hours before Tribal Council. The git was clueless, so all it took was a brief meeting of Draco and Isabelle with Ian, Harry, and Doug for things to be agreed upon. Somehow, though, the moment they stepped into the thatched hut and lit the torches that represented their life, everything devolved right back into chaos.
“Aren’t Weasley and Granger around?” he asks.
“You know what I will never want?” Draco says. “Your fucking gold headboard. We’re using mine.”
Claire went next, and then Isabelle. The plan was simple; this part was not particularly interesting.
“Not now, then. When I first asked.”
only the dim bedroom, filled with Harry’s discarded clothes and trinkets and Draco’s bookshelves. Everything was in the right place. He cast a disgruntled
However dazed Harry felt before, however out-of-his-body and latent, what he is now is untethered. He doesn’t much like it. He decides to pretend the world is black and white, just so it will hurt less to look at. The next morning he wakes up and can’t see color at all. A
“Dude, take a chill pill,” Ian, the surfer from San Diego, cut in, and Draco stalled, stunned. He had an obsessive personality, but he really had thought he was keeping it in check. After a youth in the shadows, he had banked on remembering how to not overshare.
“I don’t think this one needs an explanation,” he muttered sardonically.
for nothing to matter. Why are you doing this to me?”
For each night inbetween, Harry woke with the niggling sensation of being watched.
, it was indescribably brilliant.
When he turned back to Jeff, he was wearing a massive, ear-to-ear grin. Iz gave him a cuff across the shoulder and a fidgety hug. She was clearly thrilled. Harry smirked and mouthed ‘I’m proud of you.’
It was a memory game, and a hard one at that. A ring with a 50 foot radius was enclosed by a narrow-panelled fence. On the end closest to where Jeff stood, nine cubicles lined the outer rim. Ten other cubicles were spaced throughout the loop, five on the inside fence and five on the outside. Each was unpainted except for a stripe along the top. Within them there was a puzzle, ranging from simple mental math to counting the number of fish in a tank. The contestants were required to, for all ten stations, record the colour stripe at the top of the booth and the numerical answer to the puzzle inside of it. Once all 20 factors were correctly entered in clockwise order into a very long, very ornate combination lock, a bar would release, which the contestants could use to smash their tile, winning them Immunity.
However, if he did this, it would also maximize the amount of torque needed to turn the handle, which, when the bucket was filled with water, might be too much for Draco to lift. He also had to make sure he achieved his intended gear ratio using as few parts as possible, to avoid losing energy to friction.
And so he lay like that, tossing and turning. It wasn’t until the slow break of dawn that he gave up, heaving his aching body from the suffocating mattress and onto the floor. He was so restless. He was so tired. It was only when he went to brush his teeth the following evening that he realized something had been moved; Draco’s cologne, which always sat on a proud little antique vanity in the corner, was missing.
but Harry beat him to it, conjuring an orb of pale light over their heads that mimicked the moon.
If you are still up for exploring Grimmauld Place tomorrow to see what we can scavenge of Sirius’s that might lend more information, I can meet you here whenever you get off work. I’ll try not to mention anything about ‘they were only in 3rd year’ or ‘so very illegal-- McGonagall must have known’. As much as I like hearing you talk, it distracts me.
Draco nearly gouged his eyes out. “Tara, I need to go get more water. Why don’t you stay here and discuss it with Ed, okay?” he said with strained cheer. Tara could probably tell he wasn’t sincere, but he figured she didn’t have the tact to do anything about it.
Somewhere in the distance CJ shouted, “Why can’t the
“I know, I know. But he did. I don’t know how he did it, but he was in the bedroom,” Draco said, reaching over to hand Harry his glasses. “You… tried to make a grab for him – leaving me thoroughly unsatisfied, by the way – but everything happened so quickly and all of a sudden you were unconscious on the floor.”
Potter sighed. “Was there not any other way we could have traveled to Micronesia? We had to do this stupid gameshow thing? I think I’ve seen some pretty nice resort ads in the
“Excuse me?”
He waits until everyone else has boarded before he approaches the train. This time, there is no one to run away from. There’s no one to stay with either, besides a dank and clammy bench and the din of muggle Tube-goers through the walls.
Draco leans in to whisper in his ear, the soft curve of his lips and tickle of breath on Harry’s ear. “I like it when you’re flustered.” What he means is
In a shocking feat of athleticism, Jessie won the Immunity Challenge. The game involved stacking one inch by one inch blocks on an unstable table. The blocks were stored at the far end of a balance beam, which the contestants would have to cross between each block placement while using a rope to level the table. The first to build a tower a foot and a half high without stepping off the beam won. It was beyond frustrating, and took nearly an hour as each contestant toppled their progress over and over again. At one point, Draco thought he was about to win, but a miniscule wobble had him starting from scratch.
“No, then too.”
Harry is on the couch (well, Draco is on the couch, and Harry is on Draco), green eyes glued to the screen as Billy Crystal yells “
When you wrote to me about the reactions to the potions Okafor gave you, I knew that there was something I didn’t know about. Those reactions didn’t make any sense with the information I had. But I guess I was too self-absorbed to think that it might be a terrible idea to let you go into Grimmauld Place. I should have known better. Bellatrix learned her atrocities from Great-aunt Walburga.
Day 34
It is, decidedly, not fun. The stained bench seat doesn’t even have safety belts, and Harry stalls the truck at each of the first four stop lights. Draco’s knuckles are white and sore from gripping the ‘oh shit’ handle without rest. When Harry merges onto the highway exiting London, Draco closes his eyes, and, for the first time since he was a child, prays.
He hasn’t planned to do it-- really, he hasn’t.
“No you don’t.” Draco says.
She frowned but nodded, wandering off to nag someone else. Draco only felt a little bit guilty.
“Don’t you worry, I’ll be careful,” Hagrid chuckled. “We’ll see you later.”
“I said WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT,” Harry shouted back.
knew Harry’s story made at least a lick of sense. She must have thought he was a raging lunatic.
“Clean your teeth,” Draco said. What he meant was, “I adore you.”
“Of course, of course,” Hagrid replied. “Meanwhile, I’m sure he’ll be fine hopping around the house.”
I’ll see you tomorrow, and I’m looking forward to it. But please, don’t insinuate again that you have to ply me with sweets. Consolation prizes would only make sense if they were given to me for not spending time with you. Whenever you say such things I get angry with how your aunt and uncle, Dumbledore, and our whole society treated you. They abused you and treated you as a means to an end. You deserve to feel loved, and you deserve to believe that someone cherishes every moment they get to spend with you.
I suppose you will likely require further convincing as to why a professional such as yourself should have time or interest to spare on the dissection of a single man, and so I will briefly summarize my afflictions below.
“Draco. Good to meet you,” he affirmed.
“Harry, you may choose one other person to take with you on this Rewa--,” Jeff announced.
“Wait, like, move in here?” Harry asks, jabbing Draco in the ribs as he squirms to reach the remote. He pauses
“Well, of course I’ll have him here,” Hagrid said, leaning over to peer into the tank. “I’m not sure I’ve got the right set up though.”
“Oh, true. I didn’t think of that. Well, Ichabod, what do you think so far?” Draco said, holding the toad up so that he could see the tank.
“How does it feel to be on top of the world?” she asked. “Sitting comfortably upon your throne as the peasants come to beg and grovel.”
The camp tour, too, was brief and stilted. Harry and Lonnie trailed behind, deep in conversation. Draco let Ian show off the well and shelter, sitting down beside the fire pit and starting on a neat A-frame.
Harry laughs. “Draco, I’m just taking the piss. You don’t have to tell me what you're doing. I trust you.”
3) If it is convenient for you, I would like to come by and bring you the tests today at 5 pm. There is no need to send Desdemona today to confirm or postpone the appointment. Just Floo me. Your magic was very eager to see me today, and, while I examined Desdemona and didn’t see any new injuries, I think we should not have her work before tomorrow, especially not for a message with a maximum of five words.
“Making a list,” Harry chuckles.
Upon returning to camp, there were only three hours left of sunlight. The first jury member was going to be named, and they were going to be named soon.
Malfoy sits beside him, balanced without a hand on either rope. Their seats are the twin halves of a large fallen branch, chopped down the middle with a spell. “What you did was tragic. You, though-- I have the mind to say you’re beautiful.”
Malfoy looks confused, but he sets his jaw and shakes Harry’s hand. His grip is awkwardly soft, like he has loosened it for Harry’s benefit. Malfoy opens his mouth and then closes it again. “If I could repent,” he says, “I’d try to pretend it never happened, too. Good luck, Potter.” And then he turns and walks away.
Harry had to cover Draco’s mouth with his palm to stifle the uproarious fit of laughter.
“Shut. Up,” Harry hissed between his teeth. He seemed afraid to even open his mouth at all, lest the dried-up arachnid somehow jumped its way in. It really was awful, Draco amended, all upside-down eight legs in the air. By the time the sour-faced lady had finished, Harry was still frozen with his arms crossed stubbornly over his chest.
“Well?” Harry asked after they had been left alone.
Harry pushes back from the edge abruptly with a wince. He holds out his hand. It has a tremor. He doesn’t remember when it started. “We should start over. Water under the bridge, you know. If we’re gonna be here all Summer, all that baggage will just get in the way. That’d be silly, init?” The words come out brusquer, more flippant than when he had said them in his head. It shouldn’t matter, really; they both know it is a pretty lie. Harry’s by-gones have always haunted him.
Harry finished for him. “But now we have a game to win.”
“Hey, Hagrid is supposed to be
Draco smirked fondly. “I didn’t ask you to speak, bloody Gryffindor.”
Taking the Floo would have been faster, but Harry opted to Apparate. He found something grounding about the act of exiting and locking his front door and the long stroll through the woodland garden to the edge of his wards. Just being outside made him feel refreshed.
Draco pulls a rickety stool from behind the white curtain that blocks the inside of the booth from the audience. Only the left side of the booth is open, and Harry sits facing it, turning towards the camera to check his cue cards.
Draco laughed, a goofy, proud grin spreading over his face. “See, there is a little bit of Slytherin left in you.”
Heaping carts of rich, dark dirt and stacks of two-by-fours line the fence, a wheelbarrow filled with ornamental granite stones and gravel next to them. The dying grass has been torn out, the few existing scraggly shrubs and trees uprooted and preserved under stasis in buckets.
. Can’t you see?” Harry’s eyes sting, and the rain on his face begins to taste like salt. He wants his mother. He wants his friends. The Stone’s siren call is sawdust in his ears.
“You’re kidding,” Draco says. “You’ve
I don’t know if I love you, because I don’t know what love is. There are days when I need to be reminded that I am made of flesh and blood at all.
Jones was next to go, nearly breaking Draco’s concentration when he dove in a futile attempt to snatch his ball as it hit the ground. By the beginning of the fifth round, only six players remained: Draco, Harry, Isabelle, Marissa, a stocky woman who's grey roots showed beneath her auburn hair, and a tall man that Draco and Harry had reluctantly agreed was rather fit. Lindsay and the stern-looking woman in the ratty blazer had been voted off since the original tribe swap.
This is likely a magico-endocrinological and magico-psychological effect of PTSD. Basically, your hormones read every little excitement as a dangerous crisis, and respond with fight or flight. One could say that your magic didn’t get the message that you are safe, and mistakes little everyday excitements for deadly danger. The vertigo and weakness after the War were your magico-physiological response to having been a horcrux and having been freed from the piece of Voldemort’s soul. You have recovered from it, and while your core is scarred, all connections have regrown.
you. I thought I was losing it all over again. I thought I couldn’t control my magic. Everything felt so surreal, and it must have been from hunger and sleep deprivation, but I’m spiralling, Draco, and I needed you.”
“Nge’k, getting your first look at the new Ngael tribe,” Jeff announced into the bare field of knee-high grass. The East Coasters gasped; even to an outsider, Doug had been the centerpiece of the West’s remarkably unremarkable tribe. “If anything has been made clear,” Jeff continued, “it is that players this season have brought their wits. Survivor is a social game, and the interactions between each of you are more volatile, more unpredictable, more subtle than they have ever been. The only way it could get more exciting is if every existing relationship was turned upside down. That’s right, contestants. Drop your Buffs.”
He frowned, confused. “Um, no. I don’t think so.”
“I’m not sure either of us should hold him,” Harry muttered, pulling his wand out anyway.
You deserve all the love and caring, never forget that. My intention with this is to remind you that they don’t patronize you or idolize you, but that they took you into their family. You deserve a family who takes care of you when you need it.
To give you an answer to your most burning question, I can’t fix you, but I can and would be glad to help you work on healing your magic, if you trust me to do so. While studying your case may be interesting, I don’t see you as a phenomenon, but as a person. And believe it or not, I want the man who got me out of the burning Room of Hidden Things and then spared me from spending a life in Azkaban to live and thrive.
Prongs (named after the signature at the end) describes how they and one of their friends modified the Animagus meditation process because neither of them could manage to sit still. They describe their feelings and how they managed to achieve the necessary state of calmness, and how they succeeded in becoming Animagi despite Kinetomagical tendencies. They didn’t figure it all out alone; their parents, believed to have had experience with non-European magical practises, gave them advice on meditation techniques.
“Don’t try anything.” He recalled rolling his eyes so far back in his head that his vision had been blurry for an hour. Or maybe that was later, when Harry had unceremoniously cleared the kitchen counter and laid him down, legs in the air… he was getting side tracked.
“This feels so normal,” Harry says to the forest canopy.
Jeff gestured to the Jury. “Thank you, Draco. Now that the finalists have spoken, I will open the floor to the Jury. Marrisa, would you like to begin?”
“I’m not upset, just humiliated,” Draco muttered. “What if people had seen! My mind is meant to be on the
“I’m sorry,” Malfoy says. “I’m sorry I couldn’t be that. I’m sorry I’m not strong enough to not care.”
Harry trails the nail of his thumb along the hem of the corset, tickling the base of Draco’s ribs. He traces the boning up the center of his sternum to his breastbone, follows it in a swoop below his pec. His ring finger flicks Draco’s nipple.
Three hours past sunrise, a speedboat arrived at their beach, and all nine of them clambered in. It took nearly half an hour to arrive at the site of the challenge, but when they finally reached it, it took Draco’s breath away. Dozens of colorful docks dotted the shallows of a broad cerulean bay. They were dropped off on the largest of the platforms, joined soon after by the East Coast tribe. A camera and production crew, complete with divers and boom mics, crowded on a near-bye raft, bustling about with so much fervor that Draco thought the whole thing was going to tip.
The camp was barren when they arrived except for a large white tent on the far end containing camera equipment. Upon landing, the tribe dragged heavy logs into the center of the compact dirt pad, fashioning a set of rustic benches to perch on as they sorted through the winnings from the initial challenge. Draco was pleased to see that they had managed to collect a bar of flint, a bag of rice, and a crab trap in addition to the pots and tarps. Building a shelter was inevitably frustrating, but it turned out that Ian (the surfer from SoCal) worked as a contractor, so, after several hours of fetching, chopping, and lashing, they managed to build a large, lumpy cot with a lean-to roof.
Harry raises an eyebrow. “It’s Tuesday. The apothecary’s closed on Tuesday.”
Draco huffed. “I suppose.”
“When I was a child,” Draco says, “and I visited the Leaky Cauldron, I looked out the window and saw muggle construction cranes, and I thought they were the masts of giant ships.”
“If anyone has a Hidden Immunity Idol, now would be the time to play it,” Jeff recited, returning after the short recess it took for him to collect and sort the votes.
Malfoy frowns. “That, or I never did any growing up at all.”
He clutched tight to his husband's waist as they both took one last breath and Disapperated with a deafening snap.
Yes, I must admit that diplomacy is a skill I have yet to learn. Call me selfish, but I have often felt that I do not have time for it. Perhaps it is for the best though, as, given your description of the state my letter arrived in, decorum would have been painfully transparent.
“Growing bored, Malfoy,” Harry said.
“No, no, we can’t, remember? Jake is scared of the dentist girl. Besides, frankly, the more times I see it, the more messed up it gets. Hugo’s gonna have to wait until he’s 18 to see it-- I want to make sure he can really grasp the hero’s journey themes.”
Isabelle shook her head. “Jessie must have flipped back. If he didn’t have numbers, he’d never have flaunted it tonight so publically.”
“What’s that? I still can’t hear. You say I have a nice arse?”
The second man simpered with calculated disdain. Draco recognized him as the bloke who had wrestled him for the shelter tarp at the starting Reward Challenge. If that wasn’t dislikable enough, everyone on the island had heard the shouted obscenities and flippant insults he threw at opponents and teammates alike during competitions. Majority alliance or no, Draco had the sinking suspicion that a new big dog was in the house.
“You’re--” he started.
Harry laughs. “So I can come through?”
“Oh,” Malfoy says.
Malfoy waits and watches, leaning against an archway. He hasn’t announced his arrival, but he seems to know that Harry has seen him. “What are you doing?” he asks. It isn’t accusatory, or even curious, just words to fill space.
“Omis Cave.” Harry said. “We Apparate to Omis Cave.”
“Teach, scare, they’re the same thing,” Draco said, shrugging. “As long as they learn.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, don’t worry. Here we go, Ichabod. Welcome to your new home,” he said, reaching into the tank once more and depositing the toad in front of the cave.
Isabelle’s Quantico experience, Ian’s surfing prowess, and Harry’s excellent throwing quickly pulled team West Coast back into the lead. Still, Draco stayed at the far edge of the docks and crossed each obstacle solidly middle-of-the-pack, trying his best to keep attention away from himself. The only other person that fell off any obstacle was a petite girl from the opposite tribe, and Draco felt horrible.
“You’re gonna have to listen hard. These songs are
He shakes his head. “I’d rather be shocked than sent back to old wounds. Other people’s old wounds, especially. Even if it’s horrible, I’d rather hear about something I’ve never heard before. All the other types of suffering and whatever-- remembering they exist helps. Not much feels new these days. Which is funny, I guess, because I’ve hardly experienced anything at all.”
Day 15
“I have to crawl in the bloody fucking sand? Excuse me,
When Iz dropped, he and Marissa were left alone on their side of the clearing. Harry and Iz cheered him on from across the grass, but everyone else was so absorbed in their food they had all but forgotten that the first Individual Immunity was yet to be clinched.
While the game was going-- and it went for an excruciatingly long time-- there was no way for one to tell if they were close, no way to know which numbers were wrong. The complete dissonance between each player and their standing in the challenge was disheartening and discombobulating.
“Alright, is that big enough, do you think?” Harry asked, stepping back from the table slightly. The tank now occupied a space that was the length of the table and almost as wide. It was three times taller than it had been originally.
There is a tugging in his chest, a black molasses ache seeping up from his mattress and into his bones. Harry sits up in bed, drawing his knees to his face. His eyes are stuck shut. When he shifts, every muscle in his chest feels sore. He has never considered himself particularly sentimental, but tonight everything is
I know you make me want to live again, magic and scars and love and all.
The chance to be your friend now feels like a privilege I never thought possible. I feel so comfortable in your company. Don’t worry about monopolising my leisure time; I can say no if I feel like it, it’s just that I don’t. Yes, Mother and Pansy see less of me these days, but Mother plans to invite you over (don’t worry, not to the Manor but to our London flat), and Pansy has a girlfriend now and is busy herself. She only calls my spellphone to
“Draco, stop. You have to stop,” Harry coaxed.
“Wzah? Food?” Harry murmured, gruff and sleepy.
Harry led the single-file line of nine remaining players (Ben had been voted out at the previous Tribal) as they marched into view of a rustic set of short wooden bleachers.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Oh god no. I’m not that straight.”
Harry sits down beside him. It is odd enough to make him feel alive. He is numb enough that it doesn’t make him want to run.
“But it’s
He leads them from landing to landing a step at a time. He doesn’t know where they’re going, but he trusts that it’s right.
“So how do we find them?”
There were only two votes not cast for Jessie: one for Harry and one for Jones. Jessie looked as shocked as everyone else. Clearly CJ had not tipped her off, but she smiled gratefully, nodding when CJ whispered ‘Jones.’
“So this is based purely on fairness?” Jeff questioned.
Draco had known the second they had arrived. A Reward Challenge with no challenge in sight could only mean one thing. He nudged Harry. “We need to stay on the same tribe. Can you see what colours they are wandlessly?” Harry nodded.
CJ’s handsome face was frozen in a stunned stare. He appeared to be buffering. For all Draco knew, he might have been; he sure
Harry tips his head up to the sky. A sun ray falls across his neck. The Thestrals have moved closer. The mother laps at a clear stream, content to let the foal wander in pursuit of a large hairy moth.
Harry snorted, waving in dismissal. “Let’s see-- Lion King? Mm, no, I can’t listen to Hugo trying to sing along. Last Unicorn? Now there’s the profound masterpiece-- but it’s probably a little dark for tonight. Monster’s Inc? That could work--”
“This is going to hurt like
a date.”
Draco pushes in with a swift, smooth thrust. The friction is delicious, the slight burn a white-hot flash. Harry comes almost immediately.
Jones came last..
Tribal Council was relatively subdued. Everyone besides Tara was too nervous to say anything even remotely off-colour. It was so quiet, in fact, that Doug seemingly started to realize something was amiss. It became clear as day when, asked if anyone would be surprised tonight, Lindsay stammered and glanced fleetingly towards Doug’s shoe. Draco did his best to stifle all conversation after that, urging Jeff to get to the vote.
“Shit,” he muttered, readjusting the position of his shoulders and pushing up with his hands. Draco glanced over at Harry, but he was too preoccupied to comment, his arms flexing as he pressed his chest tight to the wooden surface. His eyes were closed and beads of perspiration rolled over his lids and between his lashes. His bare torso was criss-crossed with abrasions from the pointed edges he so stubbornly clung to.
With less than 48 hours left until Harry officially moves in, Draco really cannot keep his mouth shut any longer. He hasn’t allowed Harry to come over to his house in daylight for over a week, and he’s running out of (increasingly outlandish) excuses. He’s pretty sure that Harry has caught on, and, besides, with Harry’s flat half packed-up, it’s been pretty annoying having to stay on a box-spring-less mattress every time he wants to fall asleep after sex.
Harry guides Draco’s hands away from his face. “Draco?” he asked cautiously. “Are you okay? Are you hurt?”
He wrinkled his nose. “It is? We’ve just come across an unsolvable mystery.”
Hagrid beamed, his reddened cheeks just visible through his beard. “Well, right, I’ll leave you to it. I’ve got to go and check on the Thestral herd. They’re breeding.”
On the other hand that means that I have to resign the role of your healer to Dr. Okafor and Dr. Bulstrode. It would hinder my ability to assess your state of health if I lived in such a close relationship with you. It was actually not an ideal thing from the start, what with my feelings for you, but at the point, I knew that there was no colleague who could have coordinated the beginning of your treatment. As we have found out the unknown aspect of it, (and I didn’t consider it on time), all the medical treatment can without loss be passed on to my colleagues.
To customize the prescription, I will need your medical history. What exactly did you take back then? Was it Calming Draught? Putrich’s Potion? Something different? We will avoid medications that have the same properties as the potion you took.
Harry pauses. “Someday. Not yet. If I hadn’t seen so much of it already it would be easier.”
There was a valiant attempt to vote Jones out, but an idol play later Ian was gone and the alliance of everyone-vs-the-devil was short a soldier. Draco sat criss-cross-applesauce in the grass beside Isabelle, the delicate skin of his thighs itching furiously where it pressed into the ground and pollen had prompted hives to form.
“Not much.”
Day 11
“We need to get a proper tank for him, you know,” Harry said as Draco set the small tank down on the kitchen table. “This one is too small to be permanent.”
Draco clears his throat. “I’m hoping to have my garden redone. It’s small, and I have plans drawn up here.”
“Split up and search?” Harry asked.
Draco woke with a start to the shrill screech of a starling. For a moment, he was singularly aware of an insistent throbbing that radiated through his head and down his body, twinging where the unforgiving stalks of bamboo had bruised his hips and ribs. It was only when he opened his eyes that he realized things were not quite right.
She agreed with a self conscious “sure.”
Draco appears once again in the view of the camera, fly undone, his eyes on Harry. He brings his nose close to Harry’s ear, mouthing words before running a finger across Harry’s soaked, sticky, and luridly rainbow cheek. Harry is pulled to standing, and he follows Draco back into the booth.
Beside him, Harry choked on a rolling wave on nausea, the sound making Draco cough and retch as well. “Ugh,” he said.
“I doubt he’ll have an opinion either way,” Harry replied, shaking his head as he conjured bunches of ferns in the tank. “There, it’s all done. Are you putting him in?”
Harry and Draco left Hagrid and Ichabod and began the short walk home, trying to make sense of the whole situation.
No one has ever quite figured out why, but there are some places that magic just can’t take you. Ward Deserts, they’re called. Magic works just fine once you’re there, but there isn’t a Portkey or Floo System or Apparition spell in the world that can take you to one. They were once proposed to be a product of faults and Ley Lines, hidden deep beneath the crust of the Earth, but, somehow, everyone who’s set out to prove one theory or another has given it up.
"I'm still confused," said Draco. "I understand why you haven't bought any clothes in the last year. And you've told me about how your aunt and uncle treated you, so I understand why you only had your cousin's old clothes.  But how did you manage to lose them all? And why
Harry squeezed his hand. "I like the way you're thinking," he said. "Clothes on or off?"
"I'm more likely to have shrunk, given that we were starving for most of the time we were on the run," said Harry. "But that was before I spent the summer being fattened up again by Mrs Weasley, so who knows? Yes, by all means measure me. Have you actually got a tape measure?"
“Molly Weasley, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to sing you a love song,” said Draco, grabbing her hand and kissing it dramatically. “You’d better call your husband, though.”
They got downstairs to find Lucius and Narcissa already sitting at the table, but they hadn't started to eat yet, even though there was food in front of them. They didn't seem to recognise Draco, paying no attention to him even when he tapped them on the shoulder, but when he held a piece of toast out to his mother she took it, and started eating. His father ignored the toast, but accepted a teacup when it was held to his lips.
"I'm just as surprised as you, believe me," said Draco. "Don't feel you have to talk to me, though. I'm sure you want to get back to sleep. I promise I'll stay till they get here."
Written for the Slythindor100 "25 Days of Draco and Harry" challenge. Prompt for this chapter:
Breakfast might have been slightly awkward, due to the fact that Lucius and Narcissa both sat there just sipping coffee and watching Draco and Harry eat, but they were too hungry to be put off. After five minutes of shovelling food into their mouths, both plates were clear.
Prompt 21: Christmas tree in front of stately home
in that coat, by the way – and I couldn't help myself. Now, can I persuade you to come back to bed with me? I want to see what's
Harry manages to offend Draco, but Draco can stand up for himself.
"Which is why I feel so stupid, having to ask about it when I'm almost forty years old," said Harry bitterly.
Draco finally met Harry's gaze. "I
hated me then," he said. "That was the Amen Chorus, and it's supposed to be just the choir singing, but the conductor decided at the last minute that the soloists should join in as well, so that the end of the work had everyone actually performing - he said he thought it was quite likely that that's what Handel intended, even though the score doesn't say so, and I must say I agree with him."
"I think I would feel reassured if we knew one way or the other.
"Well, Potter sounds quite a lot better than 'not bad'," said Draco. "So what is it about his teaching that prevents you from saying he's great?"
"It still sounds a bit lonely to me, but if it works for you then good luck to you," said Harry. "You said they know what you look like? I'm not surprised they fancy you, in that case. How old are they? Same sort of age as us?"
"I know you were about to say 'that their parents had died' and thought better of it, but it's fine, honestly," Harry told him. "You don't have to tread on eggshells around me. It's not as if it happened recently."
local research and found that ‘holidays’ does not mean Christmas to a British person?”
Draco had thought Harry had looked ill when he'd first seen him on Saturday, but this was worse. The preternatural paleness was again present, except that now there were also mottled pink areas on Harry's neck; these drew Draco's attention to a vein there, which appeared to be throbbing. As if that wasn't enough, he seemed to be breathing too quickly, and his hands were trembling: this was particularly noticeable because Harry had again removed his wedding ring, and was fidgeting with it.
"You're not an Auror any more, then?"
"..... What happened?!" asked Draco, still gazing at the bizarre creation.
"Why Wallington? Because I couldn't afford to live much closer to the city centre than this, and this flat suited me," said Draco. "Mainly because it's so near the station, yet relatively quiet. I realised quite early in my explorations that I wasn't often going to be able to Apparate, so transport links were important. And I moved in just before Christmas, 1998. Six months after the war ended."
"The fact that you
Hermione laughed and moved to the doorway. Ron, however, stood up in alarm. "Naked?!?" he cried. "Why the bloody hell are you getting naked? And why aren't you worrying about
"Erm... yes, but I think my partner's left some for us? Draco - he's the tenor soloist."
It's Messiah day, and Harry has dragged Hermione along with him.
about your friends."
As he reached the alley from which he usually Apparated, he wondered (not for the first time) why Muggles made such an effort to keep their roads free of ice, yet paid no such attention to their pavements. But then, he told himself (again, not for the first time), if the wizarding world was as obsessed with cars, maybe they would do the same. As it was, though, although he avoided the wizarding world as much as possible these days, he was at least grateful that regular use of the Tabidus charm meant that its pavements were safe to walk on.
By ten o'clock that night, Draco was a bundle of nerves. He'd already been quite anxious by the time Harry had returned from his surreptitious offspring-watching; he was relieved to see that it did seem to have calmed Harry down considerably. The main reason for his agitation was nothing to do with that, though; it was the thought of facing twelve classes of unfamiliar children. He spent the afternoon and evening ensuring that all his lessons for the next few days were thoroughly planned, while Harry lay on the sofa and read quietly.
"Muggles reminds me of my next point," said Harry. "Obviously at the moment your career is entirely in the Muggle world... but I think you could be just as popular in the Wizarding world. We just need to educate them. You said yourself that you were fascinated by classical music when you found out about it - I'm willing to bet you're not the only one. And that's an area where me being me might actually be a bonus, because it does seem to get people to pay attention."
"You know, I've no idea," said Harry. "Oh, wait, yes I do. We had to get new dress robes for the wedding, and she measured me and Ron. Shall I ask her if she's still got them?"
"Not so far," admitted Harry. "But I thought I'd start with Oliver - I think he would understand. The trouble is that I don't feel comfortable just pulling out completely, because I have already said I'll be part of the campaign, but if I say I need to renegotiate the terms I suspect Oliver will end up getting pressured to get me to stick to doing everything."
"Oh, I will, don't you worry," promised Draco. "In fact, I suspect this will do it. Hang on."
– and my arse is certainly well aware of
"Professor Malfoy's right," said James, who had wandered over while Draco had been speaking. "It'll be over soon, and in the meantime we'll stick together. Stay close to Al and Score and let them answer any questions. And me, of course, but I can't be with you as much as they can. You'll be on your own in lessons, but if people start bugging you then, just tell the teacher."
been cursed," Harry pointed out.
different," said Rabia. "Oh look, we're on!"
good about it, though, or it wouldn't be so popular. I wonder if they've got any here?" mused Harry. He leapt from his seat and went over to the counter, where the bored-looking barista was wiping the surfaces.
it hurt?" asked Harry.
seeing you naked?"
"Don't worry," whispered Harry. Then, to Ron: "It is, actually. What are you doing here, though? Is something wrong?"
"I know," said Draco. "But we'll get used to it, no doubt. Now, before you tell me your story, let's be practical. How about some food? I bet you've not eaten since breakfast - am I right?"
Draco nodded knowingly. "Well, it does suit you," he said. "As does the... well, suit."
"Draco, as far as I'm concerned this is just the start of what I hope could be a wonderful life together," said Harry. "It's
"I'm sorry," said Draco. "Mind you, I think I could spend the rest of my life making daily apologies to people hurt by my Mad Aunt Bella, and I'd still never get to them all. Even my mother was relieved when Molly Weasley killed her."
"I didn't actually see it happen – I arrived while the paramedics were treating her," Draco explained. "But that's what they were saying."
Draco looked at her quizzically, but she just grinned and gave him a little push towards the stage, as the presenter had just announced them.
"Nothing's wrong – at least, as far as I'm aware," said Harry. "I'm just here to get coffee. I didn't know you'd be here."
"Want me to prove it? It'll hurt," said Ron. Harry considered this for a second, then nodded. Ron promptly touched Harry's leg with one finger, and Harry jerked as a sharp pain ran through his body from the point of contact. He didn't scream, though.
"Ron's at The Burrow stuffing his face," Ginny told him. "He says the only thing he hated about the last raid was that he hadn't eaten properly first. Although I'm not sure how Hermione'll react when she hears he's gone to his mum for food rather than going home."
The mood lightened somewhat with the two Sondheim songs that followed:
find out, because I want everyone to know. And if anyone tries to tell me it's a bad idea, I will deal with that when it happens. I suspect it won't happen as much as you think, though, especially once they see how much you've changed."
"Cricket’s boring," Draco told him. "And Old Trafford cricket ground only holds a fraction of Old Trafford football ground’s capacity, in any case. Yes, I go to football. Not every week, because I don’t always have time, but I’m a member, and I get tickets when I can. It’s very exciting."
"Don't get it in here, it'll cost a fortune," Ginny pointed out.
Draco stared at him. "I was about to express my surprise, but when I think about it I realise that it's very unlikely that you
Draco leaned into Harry and put his head on his shoulder, and Harry put his arm round him. "Of course, you do realise that you're not the only one who's dreading tomorrow, right?" Harry said after a few minutes. "It's kind of a big deal for me to go to the Manor too, you know."
My work on your case will be limited on the academic side on the one hand and on the technical maintenance of your McKinnon amulet. I believe that after we have found out what aggravated your situation, my colleagues can handle everything well.
. Raised beds line the fence, and a bubbling water-feature draws the eye to the center of the garden. It is shaped like a doughnut, the water charmed to cascade in a circle, and the island in the middle primed with fresh mulch. If Draco closes his eyes, he can already see the wild explosion of flowers and lush vines and shady trees. It was perfect.
She studied his face, wincing slightly as her skin knit back together, leaving a fresh, pink, texturized layer in its wake that stood out starkly against her dark complexion. “That’s impressive. Wandlessly, too. I can’t thank you enough.”
“You don’t need to apologize. But I wanted you to know. We work best together. We help each other,” Harry said gently. He stepped forward, placed a broad hand on Draco’s bony shoulder.
“Hotel for Dogs!” Jake screeched.
“Not yet.” Harry says. “Please not yet.”
Ron, Hermione, Seamus, and Neville arrive just as the spread of tabbouleh salad and sweet potato chips are set on the patio table. Pansy, as always, is late. She makes up for it with a gift of elf wine and a velvety black pansy flower in a novelty painted pot.
Harry rolls his eyes, embarrassment evidently dissolved (but awkwardness nothing short of permanent). Picking up his chalk bag, he ambles towards the cave, waving Draco a sardonic adieu.
“Mind if I cut in?” he asks. The stranger shrugs, and Draco sighs, clearly relieved. The rest is a blur-- five more drinks, drunken shouts of joy when someone puts on
“Yes, I suppose you should,” he replied.
Sixty minutes later, only two players remained. Draco shifted for the first time, the notches in the wood having gouged angry geometric bruises into his legs. He bit down hard on his lip, his brow twisting in a pained grimace.
“Alright, Castaways, let’s not dawdle,” he said. “Today’s Reward Challenge is an old-school tug-of-war. If either tribe can pull the rope ten feet towards their side, they win. The best of three goes home with Reward. Would you like to see what you are playing for?”
“Is it uncomfortable?” Harry asks. He shakes his head. “Good. Keep it on. I want you to keep it on while you fuck me.” Draco whines, high and clear.
“It’s fine, we can just enlarge this one,” Draco said, glancing at Harry over his shoulder. “That way it stays familiar to him, just bigger.”
Harry follows Malfoy onto the fallen log, reveling as it dips and bobs beneath his weight.
They landed with a sicking jolt that had them crashing to the ground. Draco’s vision spun out of focus as he struggled to keep track of his body parts. It felt like stepping off a roller coaster with food poisoning.
“We’re sorry Ichabod,” Draco said softly. “You’ll be happy here with Hagrid.”
BONUS QUESTION! The first to get it right will receive a drabble (about anything!) from me post-reveals.
“If you would like to play a Hidden Immunity Idol, now would be the time to do so.”
“Wow,” Draco said softly. “Ichabod you look different.”
And then it was time to vote, one final time.
I think that is perhaps why it is so exhausting to try to reign in my magic; limiting the reach of my thoughts is not suited to my brain. There’s a lot of things going on up there. Very little of it is of any substance, but it is there just the same. Movement is the only way I am able to quiet my mind or ensure that a lesson or memory sticks. Exercise helps me to focus--  there is something about the single-mindedness of physical excretion that soothes and grounds me. When I am able, I love to run the country roads or bush-whack through the woods near my house. I have even considered hand-building a labyrinth in my garden.
"You have nothing to apologise for, Professor," said Harry. "We did want to be treated normally, so I feel a bit bad that we've already drawn attention to ourselves."
"Yeah. Dad said we'd better go and tell them while he and Mum went to tell Uncle Ron and Auntie Hermione. He told me that he'd asked you to tell Score, so I came back here to wait for you. He said to tell you that he'll be back as soon as he can, but definitely tonight."
Draco added this fact to his mental evidence collection: his theory was starting to look quite promising. "Right. Sorry, I'd forgotten. OK, then... What about hugs? You seem like the hugging type."
"Anyway, you still haven't guessed," said Teddy.
"Bet he doesn't know as much as my Aunt Hermione," said Albus. "Or
"Must be nice to have the power to actually improve things," commented Draco as they got  into the second lift. "And a refreshing change for you. It’s not as if you’ve ever done anything else to make people’s lives better, is it?" His eyes were twinkling as Harry punched him lightly on the arm.
life was like. But... well, you remember when I first met her, and she was totally starstruck? It feels like some of that's come back, which is a bit ridiculous. I used to love the fact that she treated me as Harry the person, rather than Harry the Chosen One. And I
"Are you giving me a love bite? It's fine if you are, but it might take a bit of explaining at breakfast," said Draco, sounding amused.
"What did she say?" asked Draco. Harry reached forward and took the note off the coffee table, handing it to him.
"Hopefully by the time you get home you'll have worked out whatever's got your mind tied up in knots," said Hermione.
"You know I will," said Ginny, "but there might be slightly fewer during the last two weeks of September, because I'll be a bit distracted then."

"This is actually quite exciting," said Draco. "It hadn't even occurred to me that I needed this, and if it had I wouldn't have dreamed of asking

made the main course properly."
They passed the Apple Store and Oxford Circus, and turned into Oxford Street, before Draco spoke. "Please don't take this to mean I'm not grateful, because I am," he said. "But... well, I'm extremely curious about why you happened to remember my parole conditions that specifically."
Harry thought for a moment. "Scar," he suggested. "Neither of us likes to talk about our scars, but no one
thoughts about Draco were not about the man's manner, however. All Harry could think about was that Draco was
"Pretty good, actually. What are you grateful for?"
Narcissa and Lucius had great fun with this, breaking into what Harry thought was possibly called a Charleston. They were both breathless and laughing by the end.
," said Harry, blushing, "please can you show us where we're sitting? I want to tell Hermione about the music before it starts."
"I know," said Harry. "I just have a nasty feeling she might take it out on you, and I don't want that to happen."
"Will there be custard?" asked Harry hopefully.
This comment did nothing to reduce Draco's giddiness, but he made himself stand up and head for the tent.
Narcissa gasped. "Teddy? Is this…"
Within a few minutes, the desks had been formed into a loose rectangle almost as big as the room, and the students were seated around the outside of the rectangle. Harry had suggested that, for safety reasons, it might be a good idea to make it very clear that the students needed to stay well away from the actual duel. The classroom's usual arrangement did have some space behind the desks, of course, where practical activities could take place, but Harry had found, last time he'd taught duelling skills, that he'd needed more room. And that had been before he had an equal opponent.
Harry laughed. "Can’t argue with that," he said. "Anyway, I take it Zabini’s still not talking?" At Ron’s headshake, he went on, "What d’you think about getting Draco to talk to him? He might open up a bit more to him. And Draco wants to ask him about my attacker, too."
Suddenly the prompts are being convenient after weeks of them being a pain! Very handy for Father Christmas to turn up as a prompt when I already had them standing a few feet from him (although you didn't realise that!) You can
"I'd like that," said Harry.
"Of course I'm bloody listening, it's you that won't..."
Harry laughed nervously. "No! I meant... you know, with you holding me. It feels really good, and I think I might be able to sleep like that. And I never
Draco moved up the bed until his head was next to Harry's, and kissed him. Harry was intrigued by the taste of his own come in Draco's mouth, and explored this thoroughly with his tongue for a while. Then he had an idea, and jumped out of the bed to get down on one knee.
Harry visits Draco's college. Very short one today as my computer is being unhelpful, sorry. Tomorrow's will make up for it. (Sorry too if you were expecting a sex scene, but I'm terrible at those so decided it would work best offscreen!)
"Fine," she grinned. "At least I'm actually interested in the academic side of it, rather than, ooh, say, the fact that Novaya Zemlya looks like an erect cock."
Our hearts were singing – it felt like Christmas time
"But what did you say that caused him to break off contact?"
"Right thigh," said Draco, kneeling on the floor in front of Harry. Harry's cock, which had been gradually regaining interest in proceedings since the start of the measuring, instantly stood fully to attention when it realised how close it now was to Draco's face. "Left thigh. Right knee... left knee... right outside leg... left outside leg. Hips... hmm, I'm not sure whether to measure under or over your cock. It wouldn't normally be up there when this measurement's being taken, so I think I'd better measure under it... but then your trousers might not fit you when you're excited..."
of an idiot for not realising that you felt you couldn't talk to us any more.
"Thank you, Professor," said Harry. "We really don't want any special treatment, but it would be nice if you could persuade the students to back off a bit. Just let us know if there's anything we can do to help you."
enjoyed doing while I was an Auror, I realised that I hated the paperwork and waiting around and being called in at all hours, same as Ron, but the bit that I enjoyed the most was when we had to go round and talk to lots of different people - either witnesses, or colleagues for one reason or another. Ron didn't really like doing that - he preferred the bit afterwards, when we sat down to compare notes and work out the next steps. But I quite like tracking people down - you remember I told you about the Marauder's Map I had at school? I was totally fascinated by that."
Harry laughed. "That's just freaky," he said. A hurt look crossed Draco's face, and Harry hastened to reassure him. "No, not
Sure enough, a couple of minutes later Harry gave the oil one last stir and then looked at his colleague. "Right, Liz," he said. "Fish is ready." He started to scoop the cooked pieces of battered fish out of the oil and put them in the compartment on top of the vat.
"Who d'you think?" said Draco. "It was some of Team GB. It's been all about the Olympics this year. Did you see any of it, by the way? My parents seemed totally oblivious when I mentioned it, but I'm not sure whether that's just them or whether the wizarding world just didn't know anything about it."
Harry sighed. "I would if they actually pestered me like they did last week," he said. "But they're not actually doing anything McGonagall said they shouldn't. They hang around near wherever I am and follow me wherever I go, but they never actually approach me."
"It seems a bit strange that you two saw him but I never did," said Harry, while trying to work out why that thought was so upsetting.
"About six months now," said Draco.
