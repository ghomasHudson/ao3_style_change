“Being dead?”
“Something happened?”
Finally calmed down from his nearly dangerous fall off the chair, he finally got to look up to see the blond haired man standing before him. “Malfoy? What are you doing here?”
Ignore how I missed an update time, school was a big ol' meanie, but I'm back and with lots of fluff! (mostly)
Draco sighed, Harry was always the type of person to just let a bloody DRAGON stay in the house, even if it was only for a month. Merlin, he was going to have to deal with her for a whole month.
Draco led Harry to a little park bench and made a little bubble of light float around them, staying close to the table to make sure no one walking by would see a random ball of light just casually hanging out.
“Potter I-”
Harry gripped Draco’s hands once more before nodding and following Draco as they slowly made their way across the room.
“Finish it up over there, let’s get going!” the other masked man yelled from near the door.
“You only had just figured that part out?” Draco tried to chuckle, “Wow, you really did need my help.”
“If you want to wait here, your order will be right up.”
With their target in mind, they started to open every jar in the immediate area, in search of the delicious snack.
“Send this to Draco immediately. Tell him to deliver it to Harry’s friends, but make sure Harry Potter never reads it.” He reached out his hand with the paper. “And don’t let anyone but Harry’s two friends read it, I’ll know.” She walked over carefully before grabbing the piece of paper and heading to send her owl off.
“Nope.” They looked down in unison to see Edes staring up at them with hungry eyes.
“If you say so.” As the light turned green, Draco could already hear the cars behind him getting ready to speed across.
Draco sprung awake, allowing himself a bit of calmness after seeing that all his protection charms were still up and running. It was only the beginning of his second day out on his own, but Draco had already had that wretched memory cycle through his head too many times to count with each repeat deepening the wounds.
As Draco stepped out of the car, he did a little stretch to finally regain consciousness in most of his tired legs. After joining Harry on the other side of the car, they made their run across the road to the other side before another car could randomly show up and headed inside, giving the reindeer a small pat on the head before they opened the door to hear the little bell ring in delight.
“Wha- what dragon, I don’t see any dragon here.” In response, the dragon let out a little puff of fire, almost like she was trying to be found, which made the corner for Harry’s shirt a nice black.
He came into view moments later with flaming red hair, matched with equally red face and pissed off expression.
Draco made a mental note to check with Blaise and Pansy tomorrow to see if they had any ideas. Thank Merlin that at least the two of them were able to fool the rest of Slytherin in order to stay in the dungeons to see if they could do anything to help.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Sure, but only to make sure you don’t die from too much sugar before we get back home.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please, if anything they took some of the pizzaz out of your appearance.”
“I may or may of not signed you up too so you can help out.”
“And we couldn’t have called Charlie to figure that out.”

“Yes I am, I’m the sneakiest sneak to ever sneak around.”
“No.” Harry stated, pulling his arms from it’s position on Draco’s shoulder. “I can handle a simple apparation.”
“Now that ya say that, it looks more like a fork.” Harry nodded in agreement, not noticing the house elf slip a new jar onto the table.
“I- I brought you some carnations and dark chocolate, your favorite combination.”
Draco though,
“Thank Merlin you have the best healer in the business to make sure that you don’t burn your finger too much.”
In front of him, he could hear a small ruffle, making him grip his wand tighter with every sound. After a few beats, the ground in front of him was stripped away in a manner all too similar, revealing a man in a black robe laying on the ground, with only a bright green color visible from under his hood.
As Filch neared their mountain, they threw on the invisibility cloak, trying to huddle close enough together so that he wouldn’t see their ankles. For the first time, Harry was kinda glad about the cloak not being able to fit two people underneath it without them standing really close to each other.
He sighed as Edes took initiative and pushed her head against Draco's spare hand, looking up at Draco with her loving eyes that almost melted his heart like chocolate in the sun, like she was trying to temp Draco into petting her more. "Fine, she can sta-" He tried to reply before he was interrupted by Potter's sudden hug and Edes trying to stick her head in the middle of them, wanting to join in. Merlin, he was only going to get to deal with her for a whole month.
“Maybe that part of the plan wasn’t the best sleep-deprived thought we had that night.”
“What do you think Draco’s doing right now?” Harry asked, fidgeting with a napkin on the table.
"Oh, Charlie left her here for a bit, said that she doesn't make much of a mess and needs lots of love." He replied, petting Edes as she crept out of her hiding spot. Finally getting to see her, she was a deep red dragon with flecks of black scattered across her body, with two small, black horns curled on his head and a little snout. Her scales looked almost too soft to be called scales, and she had two big, sparkling eyes that were a light pink. Surprising that something that so potentially dangerous could be so adorable.
All of the house-elves looked at him weird, hoping that he hasn’t gone crazy since he knows they can make it for him… right? Harry didn’t notice or care, he wanted to make the food himself, feeling like it would be more personal if he did. Maybe not as tasty, but personal.
Draco made his way to the trophy and carefully unstuck the note, leaving it in the dust free spot where the trophy once sat.
“Do you really think that he’ll throw that all out the window just because of one little fight that you can’t even remember.”
“They are too a snack.”
Harry took no time in answering like he was just waiting for someone that would finally agree with him. “We try to get more attention.”
“So, where exactly are we supposed to be going?” Draco asked, eyes still fixated on the road like his life depended on it, which it definitely did.
Harry finally broke from his position staring at the ceiling as he rolled over, stationing himself in Draco’s arms.
“Hello, welcome to the prince hotel! Please come in.” She moved over to a little desk next to a set of stairs, becoming them in. Before either of them could get another word out, she continued with her speech.“So would you like a queen bed for the both of y’all, we still have one for a good price.”
“Oh really, and what makes them so great?”
“Well do you know that mission that I had to go on yesterday…?”
“Tomorrow when you arrive at Hogwarts, I need you to talk to him more, get close to him.” He sighed, holding his head in his hands. The boy clearly didn’t understand him whatsoever, “You know, like talk more, figure out what his favorite food is, how he likes his eggs, things like that.”
Draco peeked through his little hole, and when it failed once again to show anything more than a hand, Draco surrendered some of his coverage and opened up a hole in the bush a bit more. He could still only see half of what was going on. Barely peeking around the corner, he could see a wand hopping between pointing at two different wands. The first owners wand was about in Draco’s blind spot, the only thing he could see was a slight bit of a black sleeve. The other two wands were being held by Ron and Harry, who both looked a little worse for wear, especially with Harry’s untidy hair somehow being even more tangled.
Draco could only sigh in response, wondering how Harry’s even gotten this far in life without dying more than once.
Warning: Slight blood mention
Pulling slightly into the dirt, they collected the food from the back and set off through the thick trees to get closer to the small lake before the sun could abandon them.
“Not when you have to drive through them.” Draco gripped on the steering wheel more, taking a second to mentally prepare himself before he drove into the mess of cars going in an endless circle.
“Um-” Harry started to say, trying to figure out what the right word for each other would be before Draco bet him to it.
After Harry finished covering up his scar with a mixture of a hiding spell and a few layers of makeup, he ended up supporting a long, black coat with about a million pockets along with perhaps the loudest pair of grey shoes, torn black pants, and a dirty white shirt that he found deep underneath his pile of messy clothes. Still fumbling with his hair, Draco wore a short leather jacket, an actually clean white shirt, the same looking pants as Harry, and white shoes that had a splash of different colors on the back, probably from a painting accident.
“Long night?” She finally piped up, starting on her coffee.
Harry pulled his wand out of his boot, holding it ready in his hand. “So, how long have you been driving?”
“I need your help.”
“Goodbye.” Harry slammed the door, taking a second to wait for the ringing to fade out, allowing his face to cool off a bit. Bring a bit of air back into his lungs, he didn’t dare look back at the door before throwing his small bag of items over his shoulder and apparating away.
“It better be.”
“Ah! You two must be the new members! Come on in, we got a bit of cold lemonade brewing in the back and all the animals are almost done with the naps!” the man started to lead them inside what was starting to look more like a kid’s tea party than a remote hideout.
“So like almost murdering everyone then having a smoothie?”
It took him a moment to clear his mind of the cuteness before responding, "Yea, but why is she here?"
“So... sparks would definitely means that something is wrong, but we want it to go wrong, so maybe it’s right?”
On their way to their dorms, however, they had the “spectacular” idea that they needed something to eat. Instead of doing the normal thing and just going down to the kitchen like a regular person, they thought it would be a blast to sneak in themselves. They continued to their dorms and emerged moments later in a new outfit perfect for sneaking.
“I think you can remove the probably from that sentence. He’ll forgive you.”
“He didn’t leave any way to contact him, just said if it’s an emergency, call Ron”
“Hide on top of the toilet, lock the stall door, call the police,” Harry whispered.
Today, Draco choose the same red and gold scarf, but was now in Harry’s grey sweater with a line of red on the bottom, still supporting Gryffindor colors.
“This late at night?”
“No,” responded Draco, slightly offended, “recently married,” he responded, holding up his ring, before nudging to Harry to show his.
The blond simply shook his head yes and left as fast as possible, obviously frightened for his new mission.
“Good point, it could be a hard find.”
“Harry, what are we doing at a muggle place, we have a dragon, not a dog! I thought we would be going somewhere like the Magical Menagerie.”
The next day, it was Draco’s turn to be surprised. He walked into the common room with his book, ready to try to finish up on some reading for class, to see Harry wearing his green and silver scarf, and one of his soft, green sweaters that he wears when it gets too chilly inside. He was lounging in the same chair as the day before, with one of his textbooks open.
“Hey, in our defense we were incredibly sleep deprived, which is why he would even think of buying brioche in the first place.”
Draco folded the piece of paper back up and got comfy on the ground again. He sat there until the sun completely disappeared, watching in amazement. Harry, of course, stay there out of sight, switching from watching Draco and watching the sunset.
“We found Hermione, but she’s… not doing the best,” Neville whispered back, avoiding all eye contact.
“Still got my arms though, I must have done something right.” Draco’s smile slowly fell as he got close enough to see a new addition to Harry’s face, bringing his palm close to Harry to carefully trace the new markings. Millions of little, still bleeding cuts and bruises lined up to match his scar. Draco only removed his hand when he reached a large gash on his left cheek that didn’t line up with the rest of the markings. The only one he could remember from the battle. He could have sworn it was bigger that day.
“I’m going to need to use your other grey shirt tomorrow,” Draco told him after a few minutes.
“Ron, we’ve gone over this, I’ve been planning it for weeks,” Harry replied, sitting down on his bed in his 8th-year bedroom. After the war, Professor- um… I mean Headmistress McGonagall decided to put all of the 8th years in a separate place from the rest of their houses, all together,
Draco looked up to see Harry's excited eyes, glowing with hope, matched with Edes' equally cheerful eyes.
“Well, I was cold again and I couldn’t find the shirt that you’re wearing.” He nudged closer to the already squished Harry, but neither of them minded. “What’s your excuse.”
“Can I just-,” Harry said, looking at his wand.
As he walked, Harry passed by numerous couples snogging in the hallway and giving each other gifts. Harry was both kinda disgusted and wanting that to happen to him and Draco. Hoping that no one could hear his thoughts, he walked off towards the great lake.
The heat in his face lingered from the mini battle as he landed in front of the first place he could think of, Ginny’s house. It’s was a stupid thing to do, after all, there were so many other places he could of went- Ron and Hermione’s, Neville’s, or even just apologized and walk back into Draco and his house, but that doesn’t matter now. Ginny was the one person he could think of that could maybe knock some common sense into him and force him to go back, hopefully.
Harry left 10 minutes after Draco finally walked back to the castle.
“Or maybe I could just-” Harry pulled off half of the piece left, pushing the insides out and onto his fingers, he tried folding it up a bit before sticking it into his mouth, cleaning off his fingers once he finished the piece.
Draco happily took the green side, sitting right next to Harry on the other side.
“No clue. I just woke up with my cloak over me in the forest, saw the others fly up here, stole a broom, and decided to join them.”
Draco ran towards the closest mirror in his room, before Harry heard a loud “POTTER!” erupt from the room seconds later, loud enough to nearly wake up all the neighbors.
*****
Harry made a small laugh, “Why is that?”
“What in Merlin’s name was that, Draco?” Lucius’ voice boomed over the manor walls as Voldemort circled around the pair of them before finding a spot behind Lucius where his gaze can harm both at them at once. “First, you fail potions, then you get an absence, and finally you couldn’t even correctly label Harry Potter. I don’t know how you became such a disgrace, but I am very disappointed in you.”
Potter took his splendid time walking into the huge room with quite the sour expression before the doors slammed close by the guards. All the light was taken as the door settled in. Locks clicked and footsteps could be heard trailing away. Harry was now alone.
“I should ask you the same thing,” Harry replied back sarcastically.
"That would have been a good idea, huh.”
The dark silhouette of a park appeared in front of them as the appeared with a pop as the world slowly stopped spinning. Only a few sidewalk lights shined out into the abandoned field, with the last glimpse of the sunset slowly melting away.
“It’s just… now that we finally have a house, I- I wanted you to be able to finally experience everything that you weren’t allowed to do as a child. Be a normal child for at least a few hours,” Draco replied, sitting down on the arm of the couch.
“More than three days, don’t forget the 2 days at Ron and Hermione’s for Christmas, then the trip back.”
“Thanks.” And with that Draco walked away, leaving Harry to his plan.
“Or teleport them away.”
“For the last time! The entrance should be facing the hallway for a faster route to the bathroom,” Draco argued, running around the living room collecting as many pillows, while Harry was in charge of gathering the blankets. By now, they’ve resorted to finding every possible cloth in the room, like the napkins in the other room and even Scorpius’ favorite baby blanket, which he won’t be too happy about when he gets back from his day at Ron and Hermione’s. For the first time since they had Scorp, they finally had a little extra time for a their own activities, which they deemed was the perfect time to do the most productive thing, build a pillow fort.
“Maybe fold the bottom of it once you drag it back to the top, see if that works.”
Using some of the tricks he learned from having to stay at the Manor all his life, Draco cast a few minor healing spells just to keep it safe for the road. “Come on, let’s get going, I can apparate you back.”
"So I'm assuming that the press isn't taking the news well," asked Ginny, walking into the room with a few boxes behind her.
“A leash.” She took a brief second to look up to see a confused Draco. “Sir, you need it to have a pet in here.” She looked at Draco and Harry, trying to work out how they know each other, “Are you brothers, or cousins?”
Draco started on steaming the milk. “Do you play professionally then?”
“Hey, they only moved a month ago, and when I went I didn’t need to know the directions to get there.”
Soon, they both finally left to their houses again, ready with the plan to sleep until the evening so they can make the reporters follow them around all night. Just a small added bonus to the list large list of ideas they made.
“Yep, it’s our specialty, other than being the best with animals.”
“Was that you?”
“So to get away from the papers, we get in the papers?”
“Really, you just had to pick one where I have to deal with the hell of those things.”
Summoning a cup of coffee, Harry tossed his jacket onto the closest chair, before sitting down on the couch.
Draco thought to himself,
“Trust me, I’m still trying to figure that one out too.” Draco looked away, feeling his face warm up a bit. “I guess something in my head knew where my priorities should really lie.”
“Actually, make that two,” Harry added.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry inched closer, staring at the item as close as possible, “I-I don’t think that’s a cookie.”
“Are you saying that my entrance wasn’t glorious, guess saving is just another Wednesday.” Harry grabbed the least bloody washcloth next to him and did a mini jump from his bed to Draco’s, careful not to let his leg move too much as he propped it back up on the small amount of room left on Draco’s bed. “Why in Merlin’s name was that charm up in the first place?”
“How are you alive?”
They ran out of the kitchen, occasionally doing a few summersaults in order to not be seen, before closing the door slowly, peaking through to make sure no one was following.
“Goodnight Draco,” Harry whispered back, clearly already too asleep to render anything that could happen to him now. Draco smiled, leaning back on his pillow with his book open in his hands, too tired to be surprised at hearing his actual name leave Harry’s mouth like it didn’t mean a thing.
Draco sighed, “I’ll just take that as a sign that you’ve read all of them.”
“Well, it stings,” Harry touched the burning spot, wiping the foam off. “Surely it’s not helping if it hurts me more.”
“You ready?” Harry asked, watching Draco nod in reply.
“Everything will be fine right?”
, Harry thought, but apparently he was wrong, very, very wrong. The one red wire that Draco set out on untangling just turned into more of a giant knot not to mention that the two have rarely ever had to deal with complex electricity stuff.
“How about…” Draco reached to the bottom, finding a case that looked worn out from continuous use and immediately shoved the disc into the player before holding up the title for Harry to finally read, “ Anna Karenina?”
“Yes we do, I don’t want to have to find the remote in the darkness to pause the movie, so the food fetching has to be super fast and easy.”
Draco turned back around to walk back to the kitchen, trying to think over what he just heard.
Sighing, Draco summoned their horribly drawn blueprints from the other room that they made with the nearest box of crayons on the back of a cardboard box.
“Welcome to Coffee Cauldron, may I take your order?” chimed Draco as the familiar bell once again marked his entrance.
Harry threw his hands in the air, “Fine, it is. Not my fault there isn’t any other cure.”
Draco sighed, "I may have an idea but you gotta trust me on this, okay?" Draco barely waited for Harry’s reply before he scooped Harry up in his arms, holding him off the ground, letting his leg stay raised as it draped across Draco’s arm.
“Today! You could have at least given me a few days to mentally prepare for this.”
Half a centimeter at a time, Draco slowly pushed at the gas, already trying to hide his fear as the car gradually started to move once again.
“Er, something called hydrogen peroxide or something, I heard somewhere that it’s for small cuts.”
Harry paused for a second before putting his arm back around Draco as he was helped up from the ground with his pants freshly rolled up. Draco tried to settle down his heart again, the poor thing hasn’t had a break in ages now.
“It wouldn’t be movie night without it,” Harry replied, pushing the power button on and snuggling closer to Draco on the one pillow they had left over to make the ground very slightly comfortable.
And it was.
Harry used all his strength to pull Edes to a stop when he got distraction by a bin a few feet away. Inside of it was a large, green dinosaur costume with rotating blue and yellow triangles sticking up from the back. Harry picked it up before slowly looking up, bringing out the pleading eyes no one could say no to. “Please? It would be so cute and ironic, a little dragon dressed up in a dinosaur costume, please?”
In a few minutes, they finally arrived at a cozy stone house covered with snow. Everything inside was already pitch black other than a large window at the front with a light shining brightly through, illuminating the front side of the house enough for them to get to the door to ring the doorbell. Before the ring could finish, a tall lady threw open the door holding a little clipboard, her face grinning from the sight of more customers.
“Yea, what’s this?”
In a panic, Harry pushed the small, red dragon behind his back, pretending it didn’t exist.
The log was fairly wet and cold, which was to be expected, and only ad a few little branches poking back up through their layers of pants. Covered with as much clothing as possible, Draco could fear the cold creeping in still, making his whole body begin to shiver, even though it is apparently a warmer day than usual.
Harry leaned back in the chair, pulling the blanket back over his knees. “Did you steal my socks too?”
Draco could barely get out a single word before he was face to face with Ron’s wand as Hermione helped Harry up off the floor.
Harry took a sip of his drink before slowly setting it down, realizing what Malfoy had said. “How do I know you didn’t do both?”
“Yea, but what?”
Thank you very much for reading! I'm going to keep aiming for a new chapter roughly every two weeks, so be on the lookout for that!
Already making his way over to the bed closest to the window, Harry tossed the key on the desk and flopped down on the bed spreading out as his eyes were already drifting out of this reality, the moonlight from the window shining right on him as tiredly pointed over to the other bed, urging Draco to follow in his footsteps and act like its the comfiest thing in the world, which it was starting to look more and more like as Draco’s brain finally caught up to just how late it was and that it was definitely time to head to bed.
“C’mon how did you know it was me?”
“Stop being such an idiot. The whole world knows about you and Ginny!” Draco dug in his pile for a second before pulling out a newspaper and tossing it to Harry.
Stunned, Harry pushed himself back to lean on the wall, almost knocking over a stack of books behind him. He looked up to see Draco with a cookie stuffed in his mouth. “D-draco, I lev-ah, lerv-no,” he stumbled on his words, trying to make the seemingly easy word sound right, “I loove you too.”
Harry stood up, ready to clean up the mess on the floor, before reaching out his hand to Draco, “Rematch next year?”
Draco scoffed. “What a heroic story.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How do I know that you won’t just bring me straight to Voldemort!” Harry practically exploded back, “You just
“Just what it sounds like, a bomb. When we tap a wand on it, it should go boom and cause maybe half a block to get seriously damaged, just enough for a distraction,” the guy replied, happily reenacting the boom with his hands.
"Well, it’s not like there’s any other news to talk about."
Harry went to his room to start preparing for 11. His stomach rumbled, reminding him that he missed dinner. He grabbed a chocolate frog he always kept in case of an emergency and gobbled it down, leaving a few pieces of chocolate on his face.
“Do you see either of us laughing yet?”
“I love you,” Draco whispered, as his mind slowly powered down.
“I’m feeling great, it’s just that they were all really tall and more importantly I didn’t know if they were going to hurt the cat or not.”
“The exact words were “you could call it that,” and if we weren’t the slightest bit friends, then I wouldn’t of come over to talk to you and instead maybe put a laughing potion in your drink.”
Already fairly exhausted and dizzy from all the movement, this made Harry’s head turn and turn even more. He could hear the men running around the corner, their minds racing as much as Harry’s but for a completely different reason. Harry grabbed Draco’s hands, leaning in more with him, deciding that if his mind was going to want to think about everything right now, he might as well just not think about what was happening at all.
Before he could finish planning, a slow, heavy crunch of leaves dragged Draco out of his mind and back into reality. Gripping his mother’s wand, he peeked through the little hole in the bush that only gave a very slight view of the other side, which wasn’t much help when the sound of leaves disappeared in the same hidden area as before.
“Potter! What did you do to my hair?” yelled a furious Draco from the bathroom, realizing that his appearance wasn’t exactly how it was before his shower.
Draco nodded, grabbing his wand before summoning his bag along with his book from the nightstand and stood up, leaving his empty cup on the table.
Draco made a small chuckle before continuing, “Iloveyou.” He said, his words flowing out of his mouth so fast he didn’t even fully process what he said.
Draco thought as he peeked through the small hole, trying to calm his beating heart before it gave away his presence
“Perfect,” Harry grinned, following Draco out the door to apparate away.
“Two days are barely enough time to get over a cold.”
Harry noticed how much cuter Draco looked when nervous, something he didn’t see too often, even though Draco tried to make it seem like he was completely fine. Draco clearly didn’t want to have to deal with Filch, especially not today.
Days later after Draco left for Hogwarts, he thought Harry would stop thinking about him so much, but it only got worse. From what he heard so far, it didn’t even sound like Draco tried to have a non-violent talk with the boy yet. The only good thing to happen yet is that at least now he didn’t have to hear Draco talking about the boy who lived all day. It was so irritating how oblivious those two were.
to be there in time to grab me, and you just
“I just never really cared for them, that’s all.”
“Harry?” Draco asked, trying to be slightly calmer while hanging up his jacket.
He crept forward, attempting to look harmless before Edes ran backward again, nearly knocking over a display case before Draco shielded it with his body, only managing to knock over a single can of food.
“So let me get this straight, you saw them around a cat, you were curious what they were doing, so you asked to join?”
“That works too.” Draco took after Harry, sticking the last small piece into his mouth, folding up and placing his plate back into the empty bag as he chewed.
“Um... no...”
“Not your fault that the other cure didn’t work either.”
Draco chuckled, “Well, in the meantime, do you mind passing me another candy cane?”
As soon as his feet hit the floor, Draco pulled at Harry's sleeve as hard as he could safely do before wrapping him up in a more protective case than a hug, and swatting at the guy's feet in a desperate attempt to loosen the man's grip on Harry. Finally after grabbing his wand and doing the only smart thing with it一poke the guy all over with it一he snatcher finally loosen up just enough for Draco to pull Harry out and into his arms.
Harry finished off the candy cane with a crunch. “I thought you knew?”
“Do you think Ron is alright?” Harry whispered.
“I think I may just have an idea, if you trust me,” Draco asked, holding out his hand.
to be kinder than usual.”
“No problem.” Draco stared at the light reflecting in his glasses for a few seconds before turning his attention back to the real sunset, with a little extra heat finding its ways into his cheeks.
Draco threw himself onto the couch, soon chugging down the liquid. Within moments, his hair returned to his regular, platinum blond color.
Shocked by his actual name he turned faster than usual, jumbling his head to a second, only to see a slightly blushed man.
“But then again,” Harry continued. “I have always wanted to get some of those little fake candles, maybe we can use those instead. You know, to keep to the theme.”
On the plate sat a pancake that was intended to look like a snake, but ended up looking more like a fat S, then anything else. On the top, he had Draco’s favorite topping, multiple different berries, and whipped cream. In the corner of the plate sat scrambled eggs and bacon.
“We finished up the last one yesterday, remember.”
Draco slipped back out as easily as he came in, not noticing the green eyes watching him as he disappeared. The green eyes that were convinced that the sight of the man was simply a good dream.
“That sounds nice.”
The Slytherin’s face lit up with the words. “C’mon over ‘ere for a second.”
“Did you find anything?” Draco whispered.'
“Well, we can’t get the cape without these.” Harry pulled out from behind his back reindeer antlers with a few bells on the top. Placing them on Edes, they barely covered up her horns. “What? Now we can actually have a flying reindeer.”
Even though the place was small and not well packed, the scents of whatever tasty things were being made in the back spread throughout the place, not leaving a single corner untouched by the deliciousness. The place set off such a comfy vibe with pictures of different places on the walls, multiple seats of two, and a few couches hidden in the corner with some magazines spread out on the table in front of it.
“-Harry…”
“So… I um thought that you could be helpful in case of someone getting hurt or something.”
Draco sighed, skipping over the part where Harry just assumed that they would hurt such a cute thing. “Okay, but next time maybe find a cooler gang to be a part of.”
“I will.” Ginny peaked over Harry’s shoulder as some light went off in the window. “Good luck, I’m sure everything will be fine.”
So ignore that I skipped a posting,,, school was being a big ol meanie at first, but now I think I have it back under control, so it's back to the regular posting schedule!
He stared at it for a second before scribbling down a please at the bottom of the page, folding it up, and calling up Narcissa. Within seconds, she appeared at the door.
Draco collected up all of the little scraps of paper from the bandaids before stuffing them in the bag.
"Mr. Potter, please, is it true that Ginny is dating Luna now?" Several more mics pushing their way through the crowd outside his house.
Harry huffed, “Okay, let’s do this.” He walked over to the front door, holding it open and giving a slight bow as Draco approached.
Their stomachs were already beginning to feel the effect of just one apparition as they landed on the cold pavement outside of the coffee shop. It barely took a second before the cameras flooded out of the door, surrounding them once again. Before the memories could flood in, Harry apparated again, this time to the other side of the street. If they wanted to confuse the hell out of the cameras, then they’re going to have to sacrifice a bit of comfort, strike that, a lot of comfort.
Voldemort woke up in the middle of the night to a strange feeling of warmth and happiness before a wave of nausea flew over him just like every morning. His dream came washing over him, making him wish he could forget what he saw. Voldy could never see Draco in the same way again, but that didn’t stop the dark lord from shipping his enemy with one of his newest death eaters, thanks to seeing Harry’s life in his stupid dreams. For the first time since it started, he wished he couldn’t see what Harry saw every night.
Seconds later, Harry leaped back in excitement before exclaiming, “April Fools!” as loud as he could, immediately regretting that decision.
“Maybe we can pull the TV down and support the blankets overhead with a cleaning broom? Or we could get our brooms for Quidditch and have them float a bit.”
Together, they looked a bit more like spies who didn’t know what to wear than criminals but it’s was too late anyway to find something even slightly better to wear as they collected all their supplies and headed out the door as they arrived at the meet place a few seconds after they felt the usual twistiness of an apparition.
“Thank you. Your change is $1.80.”
“It’ll stop hurting soon enough, don’t worry too much.”
It was a few hours later when they were fully dressed in what Draco described as “an abomination to the color black.” They were on a tight budget and time so instead of looking like cool guys that totally weren’t working for the government and the hospital they looked more like they fell into a random bag full of different shades of black clothing and somehow the clothes found their way onto them.
Draco climbed into bed before another Slytherin has the chance to see him up and wandering, but the thought of them seeing him asleep still terrified him.
“I have another idea!” Draco looked around suspiciously before pulling the cookie jar to his chest and holding it tight before hiccuping and continuing, “Follow meee.”
“Potter...” Draco whispered, finally able to see his partners face through the darkness of the room. “What happened to you?”
“Sometimes, you know, if the paper is sitting there.”
“I hate this holiday.”
“Again, whatever gets you in the car,” Draco chuckled, climbing in as the door was gracefully shut behind him, the calmness of it lost a few moments later as Harry closed the trunk and practically slammed the door behind him as he got into his seat.
Harry breathed out, leaning on the car before regretting that almost immediately as the coldness from the hood spread up through his fingers to make the slightly cold day even colder. “Fine, but only because you’ve already bought the snacks.”
“He hasn’t exactly been able to be here for a bit, all week actually, “Seamus whispered, “Hasn’t been allowed to.” He took a breath in as he stood back up. “C’mon, let’s get you to bed, we can show you in the morning.”
“Edes,” Draco replied with a blank stare, ready to end this conversation.
“Two trees that look like a guy holding a bag, I doubt it.”
Hurriedly, they rushed into the little place. There were only a few other people randomly placed around the room as a barista finished cleaning a few cups behind the counter.
They hadn’t had time to enjoy the cookies, much less look at them when they heard Mrs. Norris and Filch making their nightly routes around the grounds. Hurriedly, they collected up the cookies and blanket, stuffing a few in their mouth on the way. Harry noticed how Draco ate them quite fast, clearly, he also missed dinner.
Landing on a sweeter crepe, Draco cast a glance over at Harry, mentally signalling for him to start up the conversation first before the lady interrupted whatever he was about to say with, “Hello, what can I get for you?”
Draco sighed. “C’mon, are we just gonna stand around and stare or should we get Harry’s leg fixed?”
“Yea you should be.” Pansy barely lifted her head to stare down Harry, not taking her hand off of the top of the blanket pile.
Harry walked up to the door, knocking on it a few times and waiting for a few seconds before Ginny’s familiar face appeared in front of him with the door open.
Mrs. Norris neared closer, bringing Filch closer too. With each step, he could hear his heartbeat increasing, not knowing if it was because of Filch or Draco.
“I’m hungry and I don’t think you’re gonna be ready to go back home in the next few minutes so…”
“So you’re telling me that you decided to keep a dragon in our house, but you didn’t think to ask what she eats?”
It was an old, rugged building. The type that you would assume to be abandoned if it weren’t for the music blasting from the dimming lit insides, along with a few conversations loud enough that the music didn’t drain it out. Slowly, Harry pushed open the door, making a little bell at the top ring quietly. The inside looked slightly more habitable than the outside. There were a few tables, most of the seats filled by a laughing group, all with multiple drinks covering the table.
, he thought,
“Oh sorry, it just that from the way you looked it- never mind. Well then we have two twin sized beds that would be good for you two, if you don’t mind sharing a room.”
“So you do know where Pansy is?” questioned Draco, bringing Harry out of his thought.
“She -er- found out a possible way that we could get a few kids out of Hogwarts, but a -um- a Slytherin found out… she can’t really do much planning now.” Seamus replied, taking off his dirty shoes and hiding them in another spot.
Draco sighed, there was no way Harry was going to leave the store without the monstrosity, that he has to admit would look fairly cute on her. “Fine, -but,” he interrupted before Harry could get overly excited, “we need to buy this too,” he added, holding up a little red cape with a hood. “It matches her.”
A while away, they could hear the muffled sounds of other people just wandering in the building, having no clue what they were about to do, no clue what is about to happen to them.
"You good?" Draco asked, waiting for Harry to slightly nod his head in agreement before feeling the familiar, nauseating sensation of apparition. When they finally landed once again, in the very far distance they could hear a rhussel from something large, hopefully just Hermione and Ron, but it was their best guess. Draco had hoped that his apparition would of been a little more precise, but he was at least confident they were within walking distance of Harry's tent.
“I just got hired at that printing company across the street, but there’s a really good football coach that I would love to be able to learn from.”
The blond breathed in and out slowly before continuing, “I. Love. You.” He replied as slow as possible.
After the 4th apparition, they finally made it about one block away, with the nice addition of not being able to feel most of their stomachs anymore. By now, they’ve only managed to discourage one reporter and confused two cameras to the point of making the little springs burst out of it. At this rate, they would be lucky to be finished by the 80th apparition, a theory that they didn’t want to test out. No, if they wanted to come out of this with all their organs in the right place, they would need to do something risky, something that would really infuriate the press when they can’t capture the proof.
“Good, see you later.” Harry could barely say bye before she disapparated out of the house.
“I never said we would be comfortable laying on it.”
“Yea, sorry, it’s just I’ve never been very good at dates, I’ve only really had them after I broke up with Ginny.”
“A few years.” Ginny cast him a side eye as she finished off half her sandwich. “Fine, more than a few years.”
“Fine,” Harry replied as he grabbed ahold of Ginny’s arm as the world turned around them, twisting into an alley next to a little muggle coffee shop, bringing back a few unwanted memories from the last time their arms intertwined this way.
“Hopefully.”
As quickly as it started, it ended as well-known footsteps stomped up the stairs. The figure ran to his broom he momentarily stashed in the corner before draping the cloth over him and the broom, disappearing once again, leaving Draco to run to his bed, trying not to skip like an energetic first year.
(See the end of the chapter for
The world disappeared around him in an instance as he apparated towards a small muggle bar a few miles away.
"I'm gonna try to lower you to the ground, okay?" Harry did his best to nod his head as they started to sink slowly to the ground.
Apparently, the Norwegian Softmuzzles only grows to be about 18 inches long, making it one of the smaller dragons, and they're one of the friendliest, never wanting to be alone. Their eyes have the unique trait of changing as they age, being solid white when they're born, before getting darker and redder as they grow. As their eyes grow darker, their fire gets hotter and they can even breathe it as longer than a regular dragon once they reach adulthood, even with their significantly smaller size.
“Tell me again why we’re going there in a car.”
“9 hours? I thought you said it would take 3 days.”
Harry was hesitant before trying to attempt at placing the collar on Edes’s neck. It was a black collar, the most standard and cheap one possible. He nearly got it on before Edes shook her head making the collar fly across the room, falling into a bin of toys. Harry ran and slightly pulled out his wand unnoticed except by Draco who he saw sigh and hold his head with his hand. The collar flew up to his hand before Harry turned and approached her again, ready for the challenge.
“Whatever could that be,” Draco asked, sarcastically, “Is it the same cured used to make the cookies yummy again.”
Finally, Filch walked onto the same mountain. Mrs. Norris looked around, searching for someone to get in trouble. Slowly, she walked towards the invisible people, sniffing around. Her paws making almost no sound against the grass.
Also if you want, you can find me on tumblr at TheChosenFerret.
“And what would that be?”
“Uh, not near here.” Draco stuttered out, hoping that Harry can find the money quick before they have to do an unfortunate memory wipe spell.
Draco looked down at his coins in his pocket, already realizing his mistake of not bringing any muggle cash. Not really knowing how many sickles are in a pound, Draco gave up and tried to give the least noticeable nudge to Harry to prompt him to open up his wallet and handle this for them, which worked for a second before the way too long silence took over them, making the lady look through her book for a second before asking, “You do have the money, right?”
“At least if we get sick, we have a little time before Christmas to heal.”
“Yes! Should we start doing the base of it?”
Harry placed both of their books on the armrest, only to fall off when there wasn’t as much room as Draco thought there would be. Still, they sat like that, head on each other’s shoulder for a long time before Draco finally spoke. “Now why are you wearing my clothes today.”
There was a single knock at the door before it creaked open to show Draco standing at the entrance, fidgeting with his left sleeve. He could slightly see the dark outline of the snake beneath the white shirt.
“Not the break I was hoping for but it worked,” Harry replied with a slight laugh before hurriedly correcting his answer when Draco sent him a glare that could kill him once again. “... It was too dark there.”
“Well, there’s so many good restaurants out there that we need to try and if we go too fast, we won’t be hungry enough to enjoy all of them. Plus after last month at the auror office, I know that you need at least some open air, so why not now.”
________________
“Yep, that’s it.”
“So all we need to do is connect his device to the rest of the building, right, because that technically isn’t as harmful as other jobs if you try not to think about it too much. Then we can never think of this day again,” Draco mumbled, already trying to unravel the red cord just like they were told to.
“Well, maybe I can’t go back!” Draco shouted out the words before he could realize what he said. Draco looked back up at Harry’s stunned face as the fire slowly faded from his green eyes. “Let’s get going. I’ll apparate us.”
“Okay, ice cream then.”
“Or teleport them away,” he repeated.
“Yea… of course.”
“Fine, but make sure she doesn’t cause too much of a distraction, maybe have her not look like a dragon, okay”
It was already past 5 when Draco flipped on his blinker and turned into the parking lot for a little restaurant with a precious fake baby reindeer right in front of the door (which, once they saw it driving by, turned out to be very persuading.) With a few little bump from the car, Draco found an empty parking place and turned off the car for the 3rd time that day.
Ah, there it was, the little smile that showed itself for a fraction of a second at the mention of his name, soon to be replaced by pure scared expression before he tried to hide it under a relaxed look. Merlin, those boys really are as unobservant as they seem.
“Look there’s only one known cure known to wizards,” he continued, trying to change the subject.
“Don’t question me,” he glared, almost laughing at Draco’s petrified expression, “Go get ready for tomorrow. You have some work to do.”
“Now.” Draco kicked the stall, trying to make it sound like a complete accident. Instantly, they could hear footsteps run in their direction. Harry pushed himself against the wall and threw a punch the moment he saw a man attempt to walk through the door. As the masked man stumbled into the room, he unmasked his sword, starting to swing it at Harry’s legs before Draco kicked the man’s hand, giving Harry the chance to snatch the sword.
Carefully, Draco opened the note. It was completely dry except for a few spots on the corner. Harry made a mental note to himself to practice it so that it can be completely dry the next time. The Gryffindor watched as Draco's eyes moved across the paper, trying to think of where the next location could be.
"Nope, just useless facts about how it came to Europe first and how it got its name, a real help.” With a sigh, they stood up and began searching the kitchen for anything Edes might be able to eat.
Once the sun finally disappeared and they figured it was a little too dark and cold to be out wandering unknown woods, they made their way back to the car and drove to a little bed and breakfast only about 3 hours from Hermione and Ron’s house.
“Oh, I think we may have a few from last year in a closet somewhere.”
The lady put on her best fake smile and continued, “What a nice name, now if you wouldn’t mind getting her on a leash.”
"Look, you can come read about the breed a bit if you want," offered Harry, holding out a book that looked like a few pounds too heavy, "Charlie left it here for us to read about how to care for her." Draco took the book, nearly falling to the floor with its weight. It was an old, leather book, with its pages starting to turn yellow.
“I’m willing to make that risk for you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because you’re going to need mine, aren’t you.”
The man in front of them was a tall, clearly strong man, with long hair braided out of his face with his black spotted wand sticking through the top of the braid. He was wearing an actually good version of the outfit Draco and Harry were wearing along with a small pin on the corner of his jacket that just had a close up of a bunny’s face. As they looked around the room, it appeared at every member inside was sporting different bunnies all on a cute pin on their shirt, some eating carrots, napping, or just playing in the grass.
“Why would we face it there?”
Harry finished sketching all the newest ideas on the cardboard, crossing out all the rainbow colors and putting over them even more rainbow colors, making the already confusing sketch more confusing. “Oh, and we can hold all the pillows up around it by placing a layer of pillows on the ground and some boxes on the outside.”
“You ready?” Harry whispered, watching Draco slowly take another breath before nodding in reply. Harry grabbed Draco’s almost trembling hand, feeling the ring that he placed a few weeks ago on Draco’s left hand before they continued to attempt at maneuvering their way through the maze of boxes.
Harry nodded in agreement, looking as sad as he could.
“Of course, they’re hilarious. Especially the ones were it just goes on and on about the different ways you prepare your toast. Are you saying you never read about how I prepare my toast?”
“It looks a bit more serious than a flesh wound.”
“Most people get the spark espresso, but personally I would recommend the piccolo latte with a shot of caramel.”
Sitting in comfortable silence, they began to eat their food as they watched the sun began to approach the top of the water as the wind gently swept against the water, creating little waves in the still water.
“Aww, then you can jump off your broom into an erupting volcano cause your date didn’t go well again.”
As sudden as the wind, a large force slammed itself onto Draco’s back, undoing all the progress Draco has just made on his heart. Like a reflex, Draco yanked his wand out from his sleeve before turning and maneuvering around until he could hear a large “plop” fall hard on the ground. Barely worrying about the sound anymore, Draco kept his wand pointed to the noise as his heartbeat as strong as the wind.
“Well, technically we’re just finding the object, so I think we can allow it.” With Draco’s words of approval, Harry grabbed his wand and summoned the little flameless tea lights from the closet that they randomly decided to stuff every slightly unneeded item in. Once the door opened and the lights flew out straight into Harry’s hand, all of the items were sent crashing in the hallway making a huge pile that they were, most likely, going to ignore for as long as they could.
Draco walked over to Harry’s -his- bed, fluffing up the unused pillow next to where he usually curls up, his hand lingering for a second on the empty spot, feeling the coldness that would linger for the rest of his life. Draco swept his eyes across the room, looking at the four empty beds surrounding his - Neville, Dean, and Seamus’. They must still be out trying to gather what would likely turn out to be useless information. After all, they had no way to win without Harry or at least the other members of their little trio. Ron and Hermione, however, were forcefully removed from the dorm under the suspicion that they could be potentially dangerous.
Harry sat up, stretching his back before putting his first foot on the food, grabbing a new pair of clothes from his bag, and making his way over to the restroom. “Why didn’t you wake me up?”
“I couldn’t find the shirt that you’re wearing so I had to go for this.” He replied, nudging closer, making a little extra room on either side of them.
“Perfect,” Draco whispered, kissing Harry on the cheek before grabbing the antlers and dropping them into the basket. Edes’ tummy rumbled again, reminding them of their mission.
"I've been better," Harry mumbled out.
Harry open the fridge and start to search through all the different compartments, “So, what meat do we have?”
“Nah, we can figure this out.” He replied confidently walking up the place from their hiding place behind a tree, beckoning Edes to follow.
“Wait, I think there may be a map somewhere in here.” Harry remembered as he reached down, opening the glove box and rummaging through all the papers and books before pulling out a crumpled and only barely torn map of the United Kingdom.
“Shhhh, we don’t wanna let the other people know.” Harry leaned in closer to his ear, his breath fogging up his glasses. “They probably wanna steal it.”
“Okay, now hold still.” Draco cupped the bottom of Harry’s head, pulling it ever so closer as his other hand approached with the liquid soaked ball. Like a reflex, as soon as the first drop dripped onto one of the cuts, Harry flinched back, accidentally sending another drop of the liquid on the cut.
Outside they could hear a large object crash to the ground.
“We have warming charms and blankets, we should be fine.”
Harry humphed, taking another cookie.
Draco returned his handshake, “Nice to meet you Harry.”
“Okay, one night will be 40 pounds.”
Only a week ago, Harry would of been here laying with him… happy…. alive. The image of Harry being carried away by Hagrid that horrible night still sat in his mind, replaying every chance it got. It took all of his strength not to run over there, just- just to see for himself if he was fine and just pulling some stupid prank, but there Harry continued to lay, bruised and bloody, glasses thrown with no care on his face. All he could hear was Voldemort’s laugh echoing around the campus as Draco collapsed on the floor. He could feel his breath get as slow as Harry’s as a little puddle formed in front of him.
“To-go,” Harry replied.
“Why do you think that we’re going to take so long doing things other than driving?”
Finally placing his book on the table, Draco asked, ”So, did you get the chance to ask Charlie what she eats?“
“How do you know they were going to hurt the cat?”
Grabbing the food and thanking the lady, they returned to the car and pulled out the map once again.
“Oh c’mon. You’re so riled up from this and you can’t even remember why?”
“Do you finally have everything?” Harry asked, holding open the truck of the car stuffed full with bags of Draco’s belongings and a few of his own, still trying to shove a few presents into the last remaining space, before finding it slightly futile unless he wanted little shards of everything instead, finally giving in and placing a few gifts in the back seat.
Harry nodded before he pulled out his wand and sent a silver light that hit Edes in her back, covering her body in a silver smoke before it scattered, flying across the floor gracefully towards the open windows to reveal a little black and white dog where Edes previously stood.
“Yea… yea, you’re right.”
“Find, but you’re going to have to trust me on this one, okay?” Draco nodded while dialing 911 as Harry waited at the entrance of the restroom. “Stand right next to where the door will swing open and make a loud sound.”
“Good morning sleepy head,” Draco said, sitting at the desk, happily drinking his tea as the light from the window illuminated the room, watching Harry slowly sit up, rubbing his eyes before they finally fluttered open.
At the bottom, Draco started his steps into the room before finding the environment quite unsafe and hiding back in the fireplace just as light flooded the room through the now open doors. In walked Prince Potter in all his un-glory.
“Well, they… it’s hard to explain, but you’ll absolutely love them. Mrs. Weasley made them for us all the time, and Ron always helped out. They’re the best things on this Earth.”
“Let's do it then.” Draco looked up to the still ringing building, grabbed Harry’s hand once again, and set off into what is perhaps one of the dumbest things they will ever do.
“I realize that now.” Harry pushed his wand into a cleaner pocket once again. “At least there only seems to be a little bit of sauce.”
As they stepped inside of the newest coffee shop on Diagon Alley, Whirling Awake, they were flooded with different scents of coffee, hot chocolate, and of the little pastries that were floating around the room on plates.
“My lord, you can’t throw him out, he’s just a child,” Narcissa whispered, failing to be out of earwith from Draco.
He tossed the collar to Draco who caught in just in time before it knocked over the rest display case while he distracted Edes so Draco could slip it on without her noticing. It took a few moments of struggling before Draco was able to clip it shut and hook it to the leash. They breathed a sigh of relief as Edes almost pushed them to the ground, trying to jump into their arms, oblivious to what just happened.
“You’re always around somehow, so I figured I should put it up out here just in case. Guess I was right after all.” Draco reflectively coiled back as soon as Harry touched the washcloth to the still bleeding spot, the coldness of the water deciding to slightly drip down, freezing the rest of his shirt along with the wound.
“Aww, Draco, it wasn’t that bad, you looked cute.”
“We need to start doing something about them.”
“Protection for the broom, of course.”
“I still think that we need it to face the kitchen so that we have a reason to go to the bathroom later,” Harry said, coming back to the middle of the room with another armful of blankets and tossing them in the accurately named “softness pile.”
Draco ran out of his hiding spot, determination yelling in his eyes as he barely managed to grab onto Harry’s sleeve and join in on the journey. He could hear the yells of the others fade away as the sound of complete silence took over.
Harry grabbed his invisibility cloak and threw it over him, making sure not to have it touch the food. He snuck quietly towards Malfoy’s room. Knowing that Malfoy would wake up in 20 minutes, Harry tried to quickly but quietly place the food on the bedside table. Next to the food, he left an origami note and a glass of water.
With the cars behind him as angry as they could be, Draco placed his still slightly shaky hands back on the steering wheel, flipping on the radio as he pushed the gas, making the car begin to move once again as he turned the wheel as carefully as he could, feeling the wheels turn as they slide over to the next road, officially beginning the long trek.
As the two were trying to climb into their cramped masterpiece, a foot brushed across one of the blankets on their fake roof causing a ripple effect and almost all of the blankets came crashing down. As a part of an automatic reaction, Harry immediately grabbed his wand and made the blankets float a few centimeters above them. Nearly messing up Draco’s hair, they climbed backwards out to survey the damage (of both the fort and the blonde hair.)
Not waiting a second more, Harry started to ruffle through the plastic bag, handing Draco his order first before grabbing his own and placing a rock on the bag to make sure it wouldn’t fly away.
“But if we have to go to the bathroom, we have to go fast, so we don’t have to rush to the kitchen for food.”
Draco reached into another hidden hole in the wall and pulled out a little coin purse. He opened it up and pulled it to his eye, peering deep into it before reaching in and pulling out two small bottles filled with different liquids, a washcloth, cotton pads, and a few bandaids.
Not quite sure this was the best idea, Harry back away for the fear of an angry, charging Draco, before whipping off any remains of the potion he strategically placed on his lips. Blasting out of his room, he finally got to see what he looked like. Draco looked perfectly normal except for one small detail, his skin was now a bright shade of red.
Don't mind this being a day late, I was off of tumblr yesterday so I didn't want to post this before the one on there. <3
“Any emergency occasion.”
By now, the sun finally left them alone, taking with it the safety of its bright rays. All that was left now was the darkness of the moon.
“S-should we knock?”
“So what’s the first thing we should do?”
“Uh yea,” Draco managed to mumble out, “I just happened to bring the wrong currency but I’m sure we have some mugg- I mean money somewhere, right?” Draco shot Harry a glare, trying to urge him to get the hint and save the day.
“But what if he didn’t.”
“Come here.” Ginny walked over to the couch in the corner of the cozy room and patted the cushion next to her. The house was small but cozy and it served its purposes of housing Ginny while she waits for the next day she has to leave for Quidditch.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course it’s not from here, that’s why I’m asking.”
The Slytherin rolled his eyes before muttering, “Fine,” and pulling Harry into a kiss.
“Heyy… I have an idea!” He tried to make his index finger point to his brain, but missed, nearly poking himself in the eye, making his eyebrow ruffled up. “We can get a-a dragon… then fly it into the kitchen, get the food, and get out before anyone notices we’re there!”
“Where are we going?”
Ginny rolled her eyes. “Is it the same kind of fight as the one you two had over what bread y’all should buy?”
“You think?”
“Wha’?” the other one replied, a little too loud. He carefully placed down each food trying to make the least possible amount of sound. However, this was ineffective as it sent loud thumps down the corridor.
Voldemort thought, before heading back to sleep.
Harry never took his eyes off Draco as he zoomed around the place, coming closer to the snitch each time. He watched his wind swept through his usually tidy hair, making it a mess, something that was uncommon to see. Noticing how Draco tried to push it back to place every once in a while, before giving up again. The Slytherin did all this while his grey eyes stayed locked on the snitch.
“Merlin, you two are so dramatic. C’mon, follow me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well I got a permit a week ago but I haven’t use it much since then, but we should be fine…”
Draco thought to himself. Draco could only assume Hermione was just out of view having to deal with another person.
“I figured that if we are going to get caught, I would want to kiss you before the end of the day,” Harry told Draco before he got the chance to say anything. Harry checked the pocket watch he borrowed from Ron earlier that day, “Since it is 30 minutes to 12.”
“Of course, I wouldn’t want to end this day any other way,” Draco smiled, pulling Harry out the cafe, making the chimes ring as Draco locked the doors.
“I have the latte then, thank you-”
“Well, tell her I said hi.”
“Malfoy, you’re really going to ask Malfoy!” Ron exclaimed, nearly waking the whole school, including Malfoy who was only a few bedrooms away.
Draco just stared, trying to work out in his mind how this man ever graduated Hogwarts. “Potter, why would we want more attention. If you haven’t noticed, we’re trying to do the exact opposite of that.”
“Okay then, let’s just plan it all out tonight… maybe with a bit of food or something for the date. This is a real date right?”
It would have only taken a few minutes to get back at the tent with usual walking capacities, but with Draco insisting that Harry shouldn’t try to walk, the trip took close to a half hour. The journey only arrived at the end when suddenly a bubble popped up in front of Draco, sending him flying back into the forest like a bullet before finally stopping against the bark of a tree, and leaving Harry more-or-less fairly unharmed inside the once bubbled area.
“I was cold,” he replied so casually like there was nothing out of the ordinary, which there was. At least it made sense that he was cold, it was a cold day after all; the snow not yet ready to leave after Christmas, even though it has been a month.
“Look, I need to head to quidditch practice, make sure you don’t curse everyone outside.”
This chapter is dedicated to my friend Tal for his birthday! (@scarheaded-ferret on tumblr). Happy Birthday you amazing human being! I hope you have a super spectacular day!
It was an hour later when Harry went to set up the next spot. It was a bright day with a few white cloud in the sky, perfect for flying around on a broomstick. He carried a single piece of paper over to the Quidditch pitch and stuck it on a snitch, then laid out Draco’s broom and supplies with another origami note.
“Could I maybe talk to him alone for a second?”
“Draco, I hate peanut butter ice cream just as much as you, there’s no reason I would ever deliberately put it in this house.”
“Then we will just have to try our very hardest to not get sick.”
Blushing, Draco replied, “Well, it is still technically Valentine’s day, how about we go get some proper food together.”
Harry sighed, throwing the last few items into the car and closing the back door with a nice bang. “All of that just for a three day trip?”
That morning Harry peaked in through the door and watched Draco get up and look over at the food with a surprised look on his face. Making sure not to make the door creak, Harry watched as Draco unfolded the little note and grin.
“Do you think he’ll forgive me?”
“Psst, Malfoy, we’re in.” All of the house elves in unison turned to look at the two boys standing in the doorway before realizing they weren’t a threat and continued to prepare breakfast.
They slowly stepped in, immediately feeling the warmth of the room wash over them as the wind from the outside could no longer reach them. They tried to watch exactly where they put their feet before that failed as the guy bent down and put his arm around them, dragging them into the middle of the room faster than they would of wanted to.
“What if we went over here.” Harry pulled out another red pen, drawing it sloppily onto the paper. “Then we could stop off over here by the water for a fast break. Maybe we could collect some food and have a little picnic for dinner.”
“How about you, what happened to drive you to a muggle bar?”
“Wouldn’t the couch not having any cushions defeat the purpose of sitting on the couch because it’ll be super uncomfortable.”
, he thought when he saw Draco nearing the top of the mountain at exactly 11. Draco looked around, searching for the person who could of set this all up before noticing the note on the ground.
“Look,” the guy said, clutching the camera in his hand,” I was just doing my job, that’s all, just a simple job that I had to do, that wasn’t my fault, just my job.” He rambled on, slowly moving his vibrating hand over the top of the camera. “But you see the job-.”
He mumbled to himself something about how he was hoping it wasn’t going to be a bad idea, before releasing the snitch and heading behind the stands to wait for Malfoy to arrive.
With a flick of Harry’s wand, two mustaches that looked like the kind you would find at some muggle store for 50 cents came flying through the window into his hand. Harry grabbed the blond one that looked like something from a cowboy movie, while Draco grabbed the darker, French-like one.
Moments later, a server walked into the room with his plate balanced at his head level. He took one step out before spotting their table and walked right back into the kitchen. After what seemed like too long of a time, he returned, this time with an almost slower pace like he was dealing with a wild animal before hurriedly placing their food on the table and scurrying back.
“Go back and ask him yourself.”
Draco thought for a moment, figuring out what his belly wants to consume. “How ‘bout.” His eyes scanned the kitchen for an idea. “Cookies.”
Harry tried to take a step in the direction of the noise, before swinging his foot right back next to Draco's as he realized just how little support his hurt leg could actually hold.
Creeping behind a large display of china plates, Draco could slightly see the piles of food being prepared, still hot and steaming from the oven. The lady that meet them at the door was pulling things off the stove and stirring a few things while dancing around to the faint Christmas music.
“Deal,” Harry replied, passing an unwrapped candy cane into Draco’s open hand that immediately stuck it in his mouth.
“Let’s just get you back to Draco so you can apologize.”
“Because, Potter, out of everyone, you need some fresh air and open sky. Plus I need the practice.”
“What’s the problem?” she asked once Harry had finally taken a seat.
“I did, but you didn’t wake, and I didn’t really want to try to get you out of your eternal sleep with a kiss.” Harry glared at him, his belly rumbling as Draco continued. “Besides, I knew you would never forgive me if I woke you up too early.”
As familiar arms wrapped around him, Draco could feel his legs start to give out and sink to the floor before his body snapped back to reality when his arms finally figured out that they also were capable of hugging.
“Kinda does mate, but I’m sure he’ll love it!”
Clutching onto Draco’s hand more than ever, they neared a small, grey box on the wall stationed right next to what looked like every wire in the building, not quite ready to put their less than a minute tutorial to use.
“Yes, that’s perfect,” Harry thought for a second, “What if we started to do all the outrageous things they said we did in all the articles?”
“Harry. You were dead.”
Harry grumbled as Draco continued with the rest of the small cuts on his face before continuing on his neck, arms, and legs, putting a bandaid over the more concerning ones when they started to dry off. Finally, that just left them with the large, dried gash on his cheek, which was thankfully clean enough to not warrant too much worry.
“Look, if you’re this worried about Draco being fine, then he must be worried too.”
Harry motioned to the blanket laying on the ground. It was made of cotton and colored red and gold on one side and green and silver on the other.
“Ah, you two must be the new guys,” the guy commented, casting what Harry thinks is suppose to be a warm smile but it ended up being slightly too off to make them feel any less on edge than before. “Come, come. I want you both to see what true justice looks like.”
“So, in a few minutes, your initiation to the Dreaded Bunnies will be ready. We just need to wait for the bomb to be placed and for the target to head to work again. Most of the members should already be stationed at their spot.”
“No, we both need the experience of fighting with gravity to make another home inside a home. That’s the whole point of making a fort out of such a flimsy material.”
From what Voldemort could see in the darkroom, Draco’s face started to turn to a bright shade of red. “Sir, um, how is that useful information to you.”
“You okay,” he asked, as Harry froze in place.
Harry laid a few coins on the table as he took his dark coffee. “Ready,” he replied, but just as the words left his mouth, Draco apparated the two of them away, officially beginning the hunt.
Once everything settled down and the police were satisfied, Harry asked, “Are we still down for the park?”
“What if he doesn’t regret it though, w-we’ve never fought like this before and I-“
“I can’t promise-”
Draco followed Hermione as she helped Harry onto a bed inside the now visible tent, taking a seat on the bed a few feet away as Hermione dug in a little bag and began to treat Harry’s wound.
“That sounds great, thanks,” Draco replied, pulling out his wallet.
“Goodnight Potter,” Draco whispered, climbing into bed after grabbing a book from his bag to attempt at reading in what little light there was.
“He’s old enough to be responsible for what he has done.”
“STAY BACK!” a voice popped out of the silent bubble, making all the birds in the area scatter as fast as possible. Joined again were those heavy crunches of leaves, followed shortly by the familiar voices.
“What? They’re so fun.”
“Well with all of the death eater trials done for now, the reporters keep trying to find someone doing something bad so they follow me around wherever I go, just waiting for a piece of trash to accidentally fly out of the bin and blame me on it.”
Harry watched as Draco scurried off with the note in hand, looking rather excited. Pleased, Harry went to prepare the next location.
“You didn’t?”
“Oh yea, Pansy’s in the library.”
Chugging down the new potion, the Slytherin turned a bright shade of yellow before returning to his normal color.
They only had to wait a few minutes after sitting down at a small, metal table with a small vase of flowers in the center before they heard someone in the back shout “A strawberry, banana, and peanut butter crepe, tart cream cheese crepe, and two hot chocos to-go!” and their food appeared moments later at the register.
Harry sat for a second, tilting his head down in concentration. “I- I can’t remember.”
Draco reached out his arm and petted the paper swan on its nose before the swan pushed its face closer, making Draco's hand move to its head. The swan rubbed against Draco's arm like a cat, before shrinking in size and becoming the original note. It fell from a few inches up, into Draco's open palm, releasing a few sparks of gold and red a few times.
As they walked off towards the kitchen, hand in hand, Harry knew that this was a Valentine's Day they could never forget.
Harry took his finger and started to trace the lines on the map. “Umm.. North I believe so… keeping going forwards?”
Breathing a sigh of relief, Draco turned to a shade of blue before snatching the potion away from Harry before he gets another chance to tempt death.
I won't apologize for adding monty python references into sad spots, but he is a legend soooo (and this opportunity was too good to pass up, it should of been serious but my heart didn't want to okay)
“That’s why we’re going in.”
“Leave,” Draco said, not breaking eye contact with the man, his face stiff and covered with the remains of his tears.
Draco started to get eager, before realizing, “But Potter… we can’t really fit on a baby dragon, they’re like… small.”
“I’m. I’m sorry for putting you through that.”
“Both directions takes the same time, and we can easily spread out on the couch if we need a bit more room for a while. And the cushions will be gone so it’ll be short enough to crawl up on.”
Finally, it started to get so horrible that he decided to do something he never thought he would do. Ask the stupid Weasley boy and mudblood for help. He almost got sick at the idea, but it had to be done. He sat down at his desk with a piece of parchment and quill. Dipping the quill into some ink, he started to write.
“This is an emergency.”
Harry cast his I-have-the-greatest-idea-that-is-sure-to-do-more-harm-than-good smile before sneaking off in the direction of the kitchen, urging Draco to follow with a tip of his head.
“Hey honey, do you know where Pansy is?” Harry turned his head around in a fairly weird motion while in a large chair in front of the blazing fire in the 8th year common room.
“Yea, you could call it that.”
“I did nothing,” confesses Harry, trying to hide his laughter, “you must have caught redheaditis.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Did you get some for Ginny too?” Draco spit back, leaning on his blankets, trying to keep his chin up and towards Harry.
“It’s rude not to, Potter, ya should know that by now.” Harry reached for the door, preparing his fist before a hand stopped him a few inches away. “Wait, if we knock then they’ll know we’re ‘ere.”
“Wait!” At the sudden noise, barely taking time to figure out what Harry said, Draco slammed the breaks in a panic, making them jolt forwards and causing a few cars behind them to attack their horns. “We need to go Southwest, actually, so go left.”
“Do you really think I would do something as crazy as that?” Ginny stared back while grabbing her Holyhead Harpies gear. “Or teleport the house.”
“Bingo.”
Hi! Thank you for reading! I'm hoping to have a schedule of a new chapter every 2 weeks, and they will be much longer than this one, so be on the lookout for that <3
“But you would go in without any protection?”
At the exit of the castle, he saw Draco checking the time every few seconds, clearly quite nervous about what will soon happen. Trying not to waste too much time staring at Draco being all anxious, Harry took off to find a good hill.
"Hey, Potter, how are you holding up?" Draco asked when Harry looked like he was finally coming back to reality while still being supported by Draco's shoulder.
Draco simply put on his cup of tea and began heading back to bed, not wanting to deal with his husband’s lovely stupidity this early in the morning.
Once he reached a dry spot on a mountain, he took off his cloak and began to lay out a blanket, well out of Draco’s sight. After making sure the blanket wouldn’t fly off, he set up the cookies in the middle of the Gryffindor colored blanket. He set them up so that there were 4 cookies in a trapezoid with about 10 other cookies winding around the plate like a dragon’s body.
Harry laughed, fidgeting with the end of his sleeve, “Yea, yea that makes sense.”
“Those men, walking to the door, I heard about them, they- they come in and rob places with swords. They say they’re more dangerous with them than if they were to have guns. They’re known for never leaving any of the staff alive.”
Without any word on what was actually going on, the man began to walk towards the building with the rest of the people follow right behind him without any instruction. “I guess we should follow that random person that is clearly very dangerous, huh,” Draco asked, placing the earmuffs around his neck.
Ginny sighed, pulling her wand out of her pocket, sending two cups in the other room flying across the room and making a pot on the stove fill up with water and begin to boil.
After a few slightly concealed breaths of pain, Harry finally noticed. “You idiot, couldn’t handle me having more attention so you got hurt too, huh?”
“Wow, we’re like reallly good at this.”
For what felt like a perfect eternity, Draco stood there, his neck safely hidden in the black robe as he dared not to move just in case it was all a wonderfully mean dream. They both stayed there, tears collecting on the other’s shoulders.
“Just… not yet, okay. I can’t go running back immediately after.”
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and looked down at it in his lap. “So Voldemort stormed the castle... killed a few, demanded that he saw you in the forest, we -er- had our first kiss,” Draco added as soft as possible, “you went out there, came back in Hagrid's arms, dead, then were thrown in the forest to rot, and now you’re here.”
“No.”
“Lovely,“ She asked, trying to change the subject as fast as possible, placing Edes on the ground who ran over to Harry, "What’s this girl’s name?”
Draco pulled up a chair as the bartender started to shake up Harry’s drink in front of them. “So,” the guy started to say, making sure a wave of awkwardness won’t hit them, “Old friends?”
Draco practically ran out the door at the opportunity, only to be stopped at the door by Volde’s voice. “Oh, and at some point, I would love to meet your soon-to-be new friend.”
“And if we don’t,” Harry removed Draco’s apron, “I’ll at least know you’re safe.”
Ginny walked up to the counter, stared at the faraway menu on the wall trying her hardest to not pretend that it was clearly slightly too small to be comfortably read, before ordering and paying for a chicken sandwich and two espressos. She grabbed an empty table in the corner and beckoned Harry over.
“I’m not leaving you out here by yourself.”
“So what should this meeting our be called this time? A second date or just pure mischief?” Draco asked, walking through the entrance to Diagon Alley with Harry, drifting into a crowd of people to try to stay hidden for a least a few more minutes.
“What did you mean saying we’re friends.”
Harry, still holding Draco’s hand, squeezed it tighter. “Trade outfits with me then.”
Finally getting a good chance to look at the box, which Draco could kind of remember being called a fuse box or something, they could see exactly what Grimle meant when he said that the building had too many important wires all in one place as Draco creaked opened the door, displaying practically millions of wires all slowly gaining back their much needed space as they pushed out into the open air.
Draco raced down the hallways the sound of his feet echoing throughout the halls, not stopping until he reached a blank wall. Harry came up behind him, panting, “W-wha’s this place.”
Gliding near the direction of the smell and the counter, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled him along as they both stared up at the menu, reading it all carefully and hungrily. At this point, Draco was just about ready to have anything. The little sandwiches that they “collected” from the hotel were good enough to tide them over till an hour ago (they would of been even better if Draco didn’t have to keep pulling fluff out of them, but even then they still made his tummy dance around with happiness), and the mini candy canes could of only held off the hunger for so long.
Just as the cameras started to get close enough for them to take a clear photo of them being so close, Draco took the lead and apparated them away to a dark entrance to a small alley between a toy shop and a small restaurant.
“I went undercover and asked to join.”
From what their imagination made up, they were expecting it to be cool, dark, maybe a bit smelly but instead they saw what looked like the room of a cheerful child. There were sunflowers lining each wall, wooden table scattered across the room, each with about a million beer cups on them. The room itself was a light brown, illuminated with bright yellow lights, giving the room even more of a cheerful atmosphere. From what they could see from the door, there a huge chimney with a fire going, and a bunch of pictures of the people inside flying on brooms, group pictures, and a bunch of cute animals.
“For a little over a year now, but I’ve come here every day before that when I was in college.” Draco leaned against the counter as he allowed the machine to work it’s magic. “So, what brings you here?”
“Pleassse?”
A sharp knock on the window sent Draco right back into reality. He peered over to see a hand waving through the little cracks in the curtain. Wiping his cheeks down, Draco ran as quietly as possible over to open the windows to do his best to everyone get off their brooms and into the room. Once Draco closed the window again, Dean, Neville, and Seamus were already silently hiding their brooms away.
Following him in, Harry also hit his head on the same place with a loud thump, then finding a place on the small green carpet tossed on the floor. Draco already found a spot and started to munch on the sugar cookies. Harry reached into the jar and collected two cookies for himself, holding one in his hand while he stuffed the other in his mouth for a moment while getting comfortable.
After wandering in and out of his bathroom, Potter emerged in an old pair of red pajamas with a pattern of yellow accompanied by the nation’s beloved lion crest, which, Draco has to admit, was much more pleasurable to the newest version that now sports just a small stack of gold coins. Still, one has to guess that Potter would wear something made in this century, but apparently the precious prince couldn’t possibly get his hands on the newest fashion, let alone one that wasn’t holding itself together with a few threads. The same couldn’t be applied to Potter when Draco could finally see his face right before he crashed into his pillow. The prince was a mess all up until his eyes drifted asleep.
This sheepishness from people wasn’t as rare as they wished it was, but nothing seemed too out of the ordinary (or their ordinary) for them. Just a regular fan who didn’t grow up with Harry visiting them whenever it was time to teach them about the war.
“Welcome to Coffee Cauldron, may I take your order?” asked a young, blonde man behind the counter as Harry made his way to the register only slightly staring at the menu, not really registering what was written, he’d hate to admit this but that man was taking up a bit too much of his focus at the moment.
“Well I’ve still never actually been there before, so I was hoping you would know.”
“Why can’t we just use just a little magic?”
_____________________
With a little nudge on his arm, Draco looked up just in time to see Edes covering up the book with his body in the middle of finding a comfy spot on Draco's lap.
“I should ask the same to you.”
“Harry.”
“Yes, exactly, Potter.”
Harry thought he would get tired of watching it, but he never did. After 5 minutes, Draco sped up and caught the snitch in his hand. Holding it tightly in his enclosed fist, he lowered his broom and hopped off of it, but not before casting a smile almost in Harry’s direction. Harry ducked down, trying not to be seen.
“Harry, we probably should have chosen a better marker.”
“Oh.”
“Um, no-” Harry replied, looking over at Draco in an attempt to have him explain it all before placing a one small bag he brought on the floor so that it could fall over onto Draco’s bag- “we’re just friends.”
“Holding the door open like a gentleman, you know, spread a little kindness, you know.”
“Great, cause I have no clue how to get this thing to stop sliding back down.” Harry’s crepe was rolled in a paper plate, and after being half eaten, it kept getting harder to pull to the top so he could easily eat without getting paper in his mouth.
“Brilliant!” Harry thought for a second, figuring out what they would need for the plan. “W-wait,” he chuckled to himself, “But won’t they notice a dragon?” Harry’s face glowed from a sudden idea, “We can get a BABY dragon! They’ll neeever notice that!”
“Found wha’?”
“You know, we should get some extra food for the road before I end up sick from the stacks of candy canes.”
Just as he pulled them around, making them face towards the large building, they could hear the faintest click before all the lights flashed on right as a giant explosion type sound bounced off the walls, causing the place began to give off a faint ringing.
“I’m still trying to understand that too.” Harry looked around the room, looking at the occupied beds. “Wait we should go wake up the others too. Just wait till Ron hears about this.” Harry’s eyes scanned the room, going across each bed before landing on Ron’s empty, organized bed. “Where’s Ron?” Draco once again reached for Harry’s hand.
“Hopefully.”
Harry simply nodded slowly, rethinking his decision, ”Was there anything in the book?“
Once Draco’s shoulder was all bandaged up and Draco released a “small” info dump on Harry, Harry finally piped up again, “There’s something I’ve been wondering since er- that day. Why did you not tell your dad that it was me?”
So I kinda failed in my plan of finishing this before Christmas, so I’m going to try to finish before the new year.
“This is a date right?” Draco asked, placing both of their cups on the empty table sides them, then pointing his wand near Harry’s glasses before casting an impervius charm on their so Harry can see during what’s about to happen.
“Piss off. To have you know I would of used a cheaper broom for that instead of the newest model they advertised conveniently on the same page. I wouldn’t be so careless as to hurt a new broom.”
After that dreadful night, he wasn’t really sure where exactly he was going. He just had to find anywhere but the place he once called home. The only option left was to keep walking. With his mother’s wand at the ready, Draco continued into the darkness.
Getting another 2 person room, they fell asleep the moment they arrive, barely having the energy to take their shoes off when they finally fell into the comfy beds, which, even though they would feel uncomfortable to any awake person, felt like the thing on earth to the two of them as they dozed off with most of the lights still on.
“Yea… totally safe,” Harry rolled his eyes, reaching into the backseat and pulling out a mini candy cane before pulling the wrapper off it and sticking it whole in his mouth, making his cheeks extend to look like a little chipmunk before mumbling, “You ready?”
“Yes and I would die for you. Next question,” Harry replied, carefully taking Draco’s hat off and putting it on himself.
“No, but... why would Ginny want flowers?”
“Should be?”
“It’s just joining a few wires with different connectors then hurriedly running out of the place, it’s not that hard.”
Counting the money under her breath, she put it in a little container before turning behind her and grabbing a key from a drawer in the desk and handing it to Harry. “Have a good night’s sleep, your room is just up these stairs and the first door on the right.”
Finding a small log right in front of where the sogginess of the lake creeps up, they took a seat, finally getting to connect the delicious smells of the food to a sight.
"Mr. Potter, are you aware that the kids of future generations will always remember you?"
“See this is why we should of went out to eat.”
“Past noon. You missed the breakfast downstairs, they had some strange muggle foods that were surprisingly delicious.”
"What do you think, genius?"
Draco attempted at calming himself down from his name being thrown in. “Yea?”
“Not with that leg you can’t. Doctor’s orders.”
Slowly, Draco looked to the ground, staring in disbelief at the scattered pieces of glass soaked in a pile of purple liquid, before lifting his head back up to reveal his grey eyes that had a glint of the passion to murder someone in them. As silently as he could, Harry whispered, “April fools…” before pulling his other hand out from behind his back to reveal an identical potion.
Draco could hear the faucet beginning to run as a tired, “Thank Merlin you didn’t,” was chroaked before the water sounds were replaced by the sound of Harry brushing his teeth. When Harry emerged from the restroom a few minutes later, he had already changed and somehow gotten his hair more messed up than before, which has, quite honestly, grown a lot on Draco over the few seconds of seeing it. “You ready?”
“Harry, wh-what are you doing here,” she asked, opening the door a little wider, making a casual invite for him to come in.
Harry slid along the wall until he right next to him, with two more cookies for the two of them. Immediately after he gave Draco another cookie, he held it with his teeth and his head fell softly onto Harry’s shoulders.
“Like running out of hair gel or a thread comes loose?”
___________________
“Only a small one don’t worry.”
At last, Draco arrived next to the lake. Looking at the sunset reflected on the still water, he sat down near the edge, right next to the spot Harry left in the dirt.
“I can agree to try them, but I can’t say I will fall as head over heels in love with them as you have.”
Harry collected his breath before he pushed the rest of the door open with his shoulder.“Draco, I-” he began, immediately stopping in his words when he saw Draco covered up on millions of blankets on the couch with Pansy and Blaise stationed like guards on both sides of him. “... I’m so sorry.”
“Thank Merlin I have you.” Harry pulled Draco’s hand closer, bringing it inches away from his face so he could lean down and kiss it. “You ready?” Draco only had to nod before Harry pushed his blue wire in all the way, creating a few more sparkes as they ran right towards the exit, keeping themselves low and behind the boxes.
Catching Harry’s eyes at last, Draco spoke up, shuffling a little closer together again, “I think I have one more idea, now that we lost them for a few seconds.”
“Some first years managed to sneak out a few extra portions of food for a few muggleborns,” Neville replied, “... that’s the only good thing we could find.”
“Over a year.”
“Of course it is, Potter. Why would I ask for an actual date if I didn’t want to actually date you.”
Draco pulled off the piece of paper that was attached to the snitch and put the golden sphere away, with the wings folded nicely at its side. He attempted at fixing his hair before opening the note and reading it.
“Huh, who would have guessed your anti-Draco charm would actually be useful,” Ron sneered, making sure not to let Draco out of his sight as Draco put his wand away, ignoring the pain in his shoulder as it moved, and got as close to the tent as he couldn’t without being thrown again.
Flopping down on the couch next to Harry, Draco started to flip through the pages, a little dust flying in his face every once in a while before finding the page a few minutes later.
“What was the part in the middle?”
A few hours later, recipe in hand, he raced down towards the kitchen and started to throw a bunch of eggs into a few pots.
Draco pointed down Harry’s wand on after they were safely out of the fallen structure, making the blankets fall back to the floor. Harry simply looked at Draco before placing his wand on the small table they had supporting one of the pillows that forms the entrance.
Gradually, they walked towards the door, the sounds of laughter and something sharp hitting the wall echoed softly throughout the small alley. Finally reaching the door, they only made it through one knock before the door was flung open, sending every colorful scent possible right at them. From what they could make out, it was a strange combination of tea, pumpkins, sugar cookies, some other type of sugar, leather, and steel. After having their noses knocked out from the sheer amount of smells, their vision went away moments later, all of the light of the place overwhelming all other senses.
And just like that, reports from all over the years came bursting into Harry’s brain like a bomb. Millions of unsolved bombings from all over that were rumored to be from the same person. Millions of deaths, millions of places blown apart, millions of animals missing from every site. It was said that even the best auror couldn’t find them, and now he was about to be apart of the group.
As their eyes got use to the lack of light, they could slightly make out a dark alleyway, with a lighter door down the hall, slightly hidden with a few trash cans.
“Are you ready for tonight?”
More lights went off outside, trying to get a photo through any crack in the window. Not wanting to give them any chance to get a photo of him, he disapparated away towards one location that he was 99% sure he wouldn’t see another wizard.
“Throw in a few flowers too, those are always appreciated.” Ginny finished off her food and got up, pushing her chair in. “I should probably get going, Luna’s going to be home soon and she can definitely benefit from some chocolates after the week he’s had.”
“I know,” Harry continued, sitting down at the small table next to Draco as the sun slightly blinded him for a second as he sat down. “But they asked if we could show up today and I was too scared to say anything else.”
“Same as you, I rather not keep getting stared at all day, it gets rather annoying after the first few times.”
Draco looked over at Harry again, regretting for the second time that he didn’t bring along any muggle money. Harry reached into a small bag in his pocket and pulled out a few green papers before handing them to the lady.
Ron sighed. “Why do the teachers always have things due on Valentines Day?” He commented before running to the other room, with a roll of parchment in his hand, ready to face the disappointed Hermione for leaving the paper for the last minute.
Harry told himself that he should wait a day, even half a day, to text him, but he couldn’t stop himself when he texted the number asking if he wanted to go on a date. He also couldn’t stop himself after Draco replied yes to ask if tonight would work. They agreed on Harry picking Draco up after he was done with his shift in order to have a casual date at the park at the annual light festival where Draco said that it becomes as bright as day.
“Harry?” Seamus almost yelled, crouching down to the floor as he quickly realized his slight mistake, bringing his voice to a whisper. “I thought you, ya know.” Seamus took his thumb and traced his throat, sticking his tongue slightly out before snapping back to a more serious mode.
“Are we still going to do it then?”
“Since as soon as they write every article about us, the public will grow bored fast, with every article being about how you and I are eating ice cream or watching a movie.”
Harry sighed, he never thought that dating Draco would mean losing all his clothes. He guessed that he needed to do something about that before he didn’t have anything left for him to steal.
“Draco… honey, it’s not like that, we’re not dating again.”
“Their only hobby now.” There was a bit of silence before Harry finally spoke up again. “So, you actually read all of them?”
“Fine, come here,” he sighed, leaning closer Harry before reaching to the back table and pulling out a mini bottle full of a light blue liquid out of a small jar.
Draco looked down at his hands, watching as he forced them out of their tense state. “Let’s just say that my father didn’t think that any person siding with you should continue living in his house.”
The lady picked up Edes and started to pet her back, making her tail go crazy, before grabbing the nearest collar and leash and handing it to Draco. “Hi, welcome to PetSmart, is there anything I can help you with?”
This dream was like all the others, it was always Harry thinking about Draco, talking to Draco, or talking to other people about Draco. It’s like all he ever thinks about is that Malfoy, and Voldemort was getting really fed up with it. He would go to bed and have to hear about Draco most of the night, then wake up and hear about Harry almost all day from Draco. Merlin, can’t they just kill the boy who lived already.
Harry nodded in agreement. “I know just the place.” Harry grabbed Draco and Edes and before long they felt the familiar, stomach-turning sensation of apparition. At last the world stopped spinning enough for Draco to look up and see a giant building with the words Petsmart across the top.
“Is everything okay?” Harry whispered, close to Draco as they leaned on the restroom door.
Inside, the room was painted a lilac color with a a few walls painted a more whitish color. In the room, there was a door which they could only assume went into the bathroom, a little desk, a window, and two twin beds on the wall. The beds both had a fake gold outlining and white sheets that didn’t look too comfy but it was better than having to share a bed, right?
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry laughed, getting up to refill his cup, “Cooler than a gang huddled around a cat?”
Harry finished off his drink, placing some money on the counter. “Hey, how about we go somewhere a little quieter to hang out on like a date or something? To um- you know… confuse them. They’ll go crazy with figuring out the title too like Has Harry Potter Moved On From Ginny? Or Draco Malfoy, the Man who could soon be a Potter.”
“What if they stab their sword through the door first?”
_________________________________
“They’re comfy.”
“I’m thinking a scavenger hunt.” Harry thought for a second. “Merlin, that sounds so lame.”
“Fine. Fine. I swear I won’t curse them.”
As much as he was ready to run to his bed himself, Draco’s mind drifted to earlier.
“Harry, scoot over,” Draco told him as he started to walk over and squeeze into the limited chair space.
“Mind helping, I’ve never really been bothered with these,” whispered Draco as he poured what could only be assumed was water onto the washcloth before handing it to Harry. As Harry started to remove all the dirt from his face and the little cuts, Draco dropped a little bit of the liquid on the cotton pad.
Draco thought
“Well, that would be the smartest thing we’ve done all day.”
“No, it would clearly be You’re Gonna Die When You Hear Who the Boy Who Lived is Dating Now!”
Wanting to be hugged, a little red nose nudged Harry’s hand, almost making him laugh. “Fine, meet Edes, she's a Norwegian Softmuzzle."
“So Malfoy, I’ve never got to ask you, so.” Harry cleared his throat nervously. “Will you be my valentine?”
“...Yea, but of if you were in my position would you of asked?” Harry set the kettle back on the stove for a bit of warmth, making the small amount left swirl around as he moved it.
It was a dark night in the castle, the flickering lights barely illuminating the halls and the moon wasn’t helping much with it either. A breeze flying through the open windows sent a chill through the two boys stumbling along the corridor, mad that Hermione took away the rest of their firewhiskey claiming they had to “go to sleep for tomorrow’s test.”
The blonde sat on the edge of the bed for a few seconds, holding the note with both hands, trying to think of the place. It didn’t take him long before turning his attention to the plate of food and starting to gobble it down.
It wasn’t noticeable at first, just the occasional missing socks, but then it started being bigger items, like his shirts. Harry always just brushed it off as Hermione trying to help the house elves. That was the only reasonable excuse after all. But that was disproven really soon.
They could hear the shouts of anger from missing the perfect shot for their article, being so close to having actual proof of their crazy tales, something the rest of their stories mysteriously didn’t have.
“-No, no you’re not,” Draco said, tossing his blankets to the end of the couch, allowing him to sit up completely.
They heard a rustling of papers and numerous books opening and closing. “Ron! Have you finished your essay yet!” They could hear Hermione yell from the other room.
“Last time I checked it was.”
Merlin, he definitely wasn’t going to regret this tomorrow.
"Yep, even after a few months. Can't believe they're still talking about it."
“Probably regretting whatever made you leave.”
“Because you’re the only one that calls me Malfoy.” Draco turned around to see Harry taking off his cloak. “Besides, you’re not sneaky at all.”
“I’ll have a strawberry, banana, and peanut butter crepe and-” Draco glanced over the drink menu, trying to find the warmest thing- “A hot chocolate.”
Draco sighed, “C’mon let’s go to the store.”
Seeing the slightly confused look on Harry’s face, the bartender finished the drink and carried on to the next person, not wanting to get into their business too much.

“Come in, boy,” He growled, trying to look intimidating as he pushed the dream out of his head, “We need to talk.” He motioned for the seat in the center of the room, right in front of the desk he was sitting at. Draco glanced at Nagini who was still asleep in the corner, before tensing up more, if that was even possible.
“You got your chocolate chip cookie in the end, right?”
“Hey,” Draco chimed, checking the door to see if any more people were coming in before going to the other side of the counter to greet Harry and switch the sign at the door from open to close.
With that out of the way, Voldemort happily went to interrogate a few fellows.
Out of the blue, Harry leaned closer and kissed Draco full on the lips, in the process, dropping a few cookies on the ground, outside of the cloak. They landed on the grass with a soft thump, but not soft enough to not be noticed. They hurried away from the stray cookies, wishing they had eaten them before this happened.
“Have you realized how late it is, all the shops are most likely closed by now, let alone have journalists near them.”
"And why exactly is Edes behind you right now?"
“Thank you Draco.” Harry extended his hand, “I’m Harry.”
“Uh huh. So, there’s really no dragon behind you right now?” he asked, moving his head left slightly to get a better glance before Harry scooted the same way, trying his very hardest to keep it hidden.
“Sure, anything else?”
“Are you okay.”
“Hmm. Maybe we can have it facing the couch?” Harry asked, grabbing a blue crayon and pointing towards the middle of the couch drawn in purple.
Still not letting go off Draco’s hand for some stupid reason (one that Draco didn’t try to argue too much about), Harry’s eyes scoured the board before landing on one item, glancing towards Draco afterwards to wait until Draco gave any sign that he knew what to order.
Thank you so much for reading this!! Happy Valentine's Day!!! <3
“Trust me, okay.”
“Of course, the rest of the staff is gone by now, so I can go and get changed then-” Draco cut himself off as he caught sight of the outside before grabbing Harry’s hand and running to the restroom.
Lights flashed across the dark, night sky. The sound of each camera taking a picture ringing in his ears as much as the lights blinded him. Another mic was shoved in his face. "Mr. Potter, why did you break up with Ginny?"
Just then, a figure made their way across the room, almost bumping into the pair of them by accident. “Excuse me, just making my way to the restroom.” Seamus peered down, his face twisting from confusion to pure joy.
He slowly made his way over to the bar, where the bartender sat, fixing up another guy’s drink. Most of the seats were either falling apart or taken makingHarry scouted the area until he found a half decent chair. Finally getting used to not being noticed without some sort of disguise, Harry settled in, calling over to the bartender to get a drink.
“Voldemort gathered every student’s wand so now he can track when they’re in use, so now it’s illegal to practice out of the designated times.”
“You met me yesterday.”
“I’m always cute, Potter,” he glared back.
“For?”
“You’ve eaten these before, right?”
“Um, it from…” Draco glanced over to see Harry hurriedly rummaging through his bag, “Harry, where exactly is it from.”
“Then chances are that he did too.”
“Couldn’t you of just asked?”
