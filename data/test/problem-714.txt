Malfoy looked disheveled, like he had run here; Harry had to admit to himself that it was kind of attractive – that
He didn’t mind that nobody cared about him being appointed new Potions Master at 26. All he wanted was to get out of the apartment he’d leased four years ago and had barely left since.
At Hagrid’s request, Harry sat down, and agreed to a cup of tea. “Can’t stay long,” he sighed. “I have a pile of essays on Defensive Spells from the fourth year students to grade. A nightmare, truly.”
Harry thought bitterly. What a great way to start a conversation. He wouldn’t be surprised if Malfoy took it as a sarcastic comment.
Harry did exactly so, stepping into the extremely familiar cabin in which Hagrid had lived for more than six decades. It was as pleasant an experience as it always was; the cabin was warmer than the chill, late autumn air outside, and it smelled, surprisingly pleasantly, of a kind of stew.
The young man in the mirror was nothing like the boy who strutted into Hogwarts on September 1st, 1991. That boy had been arrogant, immature, selfish, convinced the world would bow to him; instead, the world spent the next decade teaching him how wrong he was. About everything.
For a while, after the War, he’d grown sickly. The trials ensured that, beating on his body and soul alike. He felt as if he was being eaten alive. Dementors were no longer as popular as they used to be, but it took a very long time to get them out of Azkaban.
He even managed to get half-through telling the story of breaking into Umbridge’s office to a fifth year Slytherin before he realized that perhaps that it wasn’t very
“The first time I was introduced to this class, I was being taught by the late Severus Snape. He promised us that if we only listened, we could learn ‘how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death’ – and I promise you, that’s an exact quote. Professor Snape was a truly unique man.
Eight years after the Second Wizarding War, seven years after being acquitted of all charges, four years after moving out of his parents’ mansion in Wiltshire, Draco Malfoy decided enough was enough and visited an owlery.
“I can imagine,” Hagrid said. “I remember me firs’ term… And yer on’y in yer second year teachin’, Harry, don’ forget that.”
He hadn’t been around this many people in years, and it made him nervous. He was startled when Professor McGonagall introduced him. He was sat at the end of the table, thank God, but he was unfamiliar with the middle-aged Transfiguration teacher sitting by him, and she would not
, however, will not teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, prevent death. At least not at this moment, and for most of you, not ever. At this point, most of you can barely lift a wand, let alone tell the difference between a kidney stone or a proper bezoar. And
Harry gratefully accepted the tea, but only held it, for the time being. “How’ve you been, Hagrid? I haven’t had time to really talk to anyone at all over the last few weeks.”
What had he been thinking? How could he possibly survive this year with Potter opposite him, besting him at every opportunity yet again?
One week had passed, and both of them had managed not to kill each other yet. In Harry’s opinion, that was the best it was going to get. He was more than fine with it. Well, he was slightly more than fine with it. More accurately, it was a passable experience.
And he was sick of the way people’s eyes were always on him, as if he was going to take out his wand and attack the nearest Muggleborn. He may not have been front page material anymore, but he was still Draco Malfoy, the boy who…
The room was empty when he arrived, as was to be expected with the feast only just over. He spotted his students’ essays on a coffee table at the opposite end of the room, but, instead of leaving after picking them up, he decided he fancied a cup of tea, and decided to make one before making his way to his rooms.
At this moment, he regretted every decision he had made in his life that led him to this moment, to this place, to this job. He thought -
His bathroom was simple, yet elegant. He’d been given the opportunity, before the school year had begun, to make any adjustments to these rooms he had been assigned, but he’d elected to make very few. The bedroom remained as bare now as it was a month ago, in neutral off-white and brown colors; the sitting room/kitchenette now had a smattering of books lying about, but nothing precious or even really good, mostly potion books and dictionaries and a cooking book, and there was a half eaten green apple from earlier he had left on the counter, the flesh of it now a dark, sickening brown. The bathroom, however, had been subtly redecorated. Where previously there had been emerald green, there was now a warm, light orange. The silver, now black. The shape of it had stayed the same, but the meaning behind it...
The staff room, a warm room with a kitchenette, a large table, and several comfortable chairs, was one of his favorite places in the school, now that he had the right to spend time in it. He honestly preferred to spend time in here, conversing with Neville over a cup of tea, than be in his office or room. He was even sort of looking forward to going there right now, no matter how short the visit was going to be.
, but as he had realized earlier in the year, his shoulders had certainly filled outl just past his 26
. Harry had never, not once, told a single detail of his life’s story to any reporter, but he gladly shared with his students. And not just big things, either, like the DA, or defeating the Basilisk; no, he told them of little things, too, which they shared among themselves like little pieces of gold.
As if echoing Harry’s earlier actions, Malfoy nodded in response, then, wordlessly, turned around and exited the staff room.
“For many of the people we have tried since the War, there was a choice. Many of them had been children during the last War, barely even old enough to Apparate. But now, they were adults. They had the presence of mind, the maturity to make their choices.
And then, once the Daily Prophet and the wizarding world had largely calmed down about the news, they all came back, and the school year was two weeks away. Then those two weeks past, and Harry Potter had his second first day at Hogwarts.
And then he’d been acquitted. And then he’d been home. And then, so many days later he had lost count, he had gotten out of bed and began looking for his will to live.
think about it. The way his pulse immediately began racing, an old, familiar reaction to an old, familiar rival…
“Yeh, I think they jus’ migh’ be the bigges’ I’ve ever grown,” Hagrid replied cheerfully, and for the next fifteen minutes the conversation continued in this vein, Hagrid doing most of the talking, with occasional one word replies supplied by Harry. At last, however, Harry sighed regretfully and said that he really had to leave, now; the pile of parchment on his desk was taunting him, and in the back of his mind a voice, which sounded remarkably like Hermione, was reminding him to never leave anything to the last minute. For once in his life, he decided to listen to that voice and, regretfully, left the warmth of Hagrid’s cabin in favor of making the trek back up to the castle. He passed the greenhouses on the way up, but Neville was nowhere to be seen – Harry looked at his watch and realized that dinner had already begun. He decided he wasn’t hungry enough to brave seeing Malfoy again, and besides, he had some food in his kitchenette, and so, as he entered the castle, he turned away from the Great Hall and made his way a couple flights of stairs, down a corridor, around a corner, and then found himself face to face with none other than Draco Malfoy himself.
He hadn’t seen that white-blond hair, that pointy chin, nor those clear eyes since he testified at the trial.
True, they now had their own rooms and offices into which they could retreat should they please, but their circle of peers was now rather smaller, and they had to – quote, unquote –
“Unicorn hair has a variety of uses, mostly relating to healing, but mostly in extremely difficult potions which will not be studied in this classroom until N.E.W.T. levels. Aconite – also known as wolfsbane and monkshood – is poisonous, but its root is fairly useful in a variety of potions, including the Awakening Potion. Snake fangs – “
“But this child, like many others, had never had a choice. He was raised in a home where murderers, such as Bellatrix Lestrange, were the accepted members of the family. He lived with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named himself, and only he himself can know what kind of pressure that placed on him.
“I… This is stupid. Forget it.” He turned his face, and looked intently at a tree to avoid Harry’s gaze.
Harry: Ron is on Hermione's side now, telling me to look for help because I can't go on like this. But this is normal. I looked it up on Google and it said that mourning lasts 6 months.
Harry ruffled his hair a bit, and sighed. He went back to his earlier position next to Draco and held his hand again. Draco inwardly sighed in relief too.
“You’ve told me you’re gay, so I guessed it was a boy. Do I know him? Is it Blaise?” Harry asked, with too much interest in Draco’s opinion.
“I meant your mum, Scorpius, I’m sorry,” Lucius finally says. “She was a boy before. I always forget she’s a woman now.”
“I’m trying to look over my essay, can you shut up for a second?” He signed a bit too fast for Harry, and he was glad to see how he furrowed his brow while he tried to decipher Draco’s signs.
Harry: I think they're trying to make me an alcoholic. I mean, I cried while hugging  Goyle, and I'm pretty sure I told Blaise I love him.
“Do you think I should talk to someone about Michael? Like a Mind Healer or something like that? I’ve been thinking about our relationship and how he made me feel, and about what Weasley and Harry say, and… well, what if they’re right? What if it was… abuse?” He said the last word with a grimace. It was a serious accusation, and part of him was still sure it wasn’t that, but it couldn’t be right that his relationship felt like a suffocating place where he couldn’t be himself around Michael.
He visited other patients in the ward, leaving Mr. Robinson for the end as he didn’t want to deal with him so early in his shift. As usual, the man insulted him and reminded him of how great the Dark Lord’s reign had been. Harry attended him in silence, as he wasn’t in the mood to discuss.
“Do we go to bed then?” Harry asked, and Draco saw how his eyes darkened with lust. With any luck, they were thinking about the same thing.
“It’s you, you idiot!” He felt tears in his eyes, but he didn’t bother to wipe them. “I was so worried you had another soulmate, so jealous! But it’s us! We can be together! If you want.” He finished with trembling fingers.
I go to the garage and the sight of his dirty car welcomes me. Doesn’t he know that there are ways of tracking someone’s location by the dirt on their shoes? I clean the car until it’s as good as new. As I clean it, it starts raining, which fills me with joy. It’ll destroy the car’s tire marks near the lake.
I know it wasn’t Ron who called him. Ron’s in France with Hermione. It amuses me that Harry lies so badly. It’s “Yours” who called him. I’m sure. He goes to the garage and starts the car. He doesn’t like Apparating. I go out just after him and get into mine. I’m going to follow him wherever he goes. Just out of curiosity. I want to know who “Yours” is.
The right side of the bed was even. That was it. The blankets weren’t piled up in weird ways, and the pillows were fluffy, as if no one had slept on them.
“Are you… Are you scared sometimes that Mother secretly hates you? Because of the war and all that?” he whispered, looking at the liquid in his glass.
“Don’t you have a husband and two children to look after before they destroy my garden?” Her father asks annoyed, although she knows him well enough to know he’s teasing her back.
I go to her bedroom and wonder if Harry had sex with her in that bed. I look at the sheets closely, looking for marks of semen or pubes, but they’re clean. I cast a cleaning spell on them, just in case. In her bedside table, I find more notes like the first one: stupid, sappy messages written in red lipstick and signed with “Yours”. I have to breathe deeply for a few seconds to calm down. This woman was such an idiot! What did Harry see in her? He hates all those cheesy romantic things. I find pictures, too. Of the two of them, naked, kissing, smiling, hugging, cuddling. The pictures and the notes go together in my bag. They can be useful in the future.
Harry: The Burrow is so full of people, I’m sleeping in the living room with Charlie. I think they put us together because we’re both asexual and alone, so Molly was sure we weren’t going to do anything inappropriate in her house, unlike two certain girls I know.
“Thanks,” Harry said once he had swallowed. “Not only for the chocolates, although they’re amazing, but for saving me.” He looked curious at Draco, and blushed. Then picked another chocolate.
“Can I ask you something I’ve been wondering since I learned you were my flatmate?” Draco asked suddenly.
“Fine. Okay. You’re right. I’ll let him know that I’m okay with him being Potter,” Draco muttered, still unconvinced that he was making the right decision.
Harry: Ron and Hermione are here and they're cooking dinner in my kitchen. I don't want to know the disaster they're making.
Draco hadn’t expected Harry to be there at every treatment, and he wasn’t. He couldn’t possibly be there twice a week all day. Sometimes, he would come by Draco’s house with either a book or a meal or just to check-in and ask how the treatment was going.
Before long Draco fell asleep, and when he awoke it was turning to dusk. Harry had his feet propped up against the wall, scuff marks against the paint, his hands were folded against his belly, his head was tilted back and he was asleep.
His only vice was two fingers of the finest whiskey at night. He allowed himself that. He drank it slowly as he stared up at the sky from the balcony of his flat. Sitting there in the evenings, he would obsess over the constellations, finding and naming as many as were visible.
Several days as he walked into treatment, Draco saw his father outside St Mungo’s. Sitting on a bench. Waiting for him and then just watching him walk in. He didn’t know what his father wanted, and he didn’t care to know, at least not then.
Harry let out a laugh through his nose and shook his head, hair falling out of it’s haphazard place. “No. I am just curious about your days here when you have your…”
Draco could see that Potter tried to lie low now, now that he’d done what he was destined to do.  If Potter came to speak to him about something other than work, Draco would speak, but as minimally as necessary. He never knew what Potter’s intentions were. He certainly wasn’t about to be the man’s new task or a charity case or whatever. And, truly, the other auror had never done anything to make it seem like that was the case; Draco just had a shit attitude about it. He knew this about himself, and he accepted it for what it was.
! Momentarily, Draco shut his eyes as the footsteps approached, the sound echoing louder with each second.
Harry pulled back a bit and with his hand lifted Draco’s chin. Draco was looking up at him, his cold grey eyes meeting Harry’s brilliant green. Harry shook his head not understanding, “Who? What is going on?”
The only person who ever attempted to engage him was Potter. Draco found this, like everything with Potter, annoying. Potter had always just been someone else his father compared him to; he was golden and everyone loved him, and that in itself sickened Draco. It wasn’t Potter’s fault. Draco didn’t dislike Potter for anything Potter did, exactly. He disliked everyone else for how they viewed Potter. The idolization of the boy and now the man.
When he wasn’t exercising or sitting on his balcony, he was working. He’d proven himself a worthy Auror, and he was respected in a cold manner. He didn’t go out to pubs with his coworkers. He didn’t get invited to birthday parties for their children or Christmas dinners. They left him alone which was fine by him.
Harry nodded and his lips were pursed together, and Draco was desperate to ask why he was there, what was he doing, what was he thinking, why he wasn’t at work, and the like.
He turned to see the other man coming out into the cold night. Draco turned, walking backwards, pointing a finger at Harry and said, "Don’t follow me.”
It was difficult for Draco to admit to his mum that he was dying, that his treatment wasn’t working, and so he didn’t tell her; he was ashamed that he’d been lying to her, but he couldn’t bring himself to tell her. He couldn’t bring himself to even say the words out loud to himself, to say, “I’m dying. I’m going to die.”
At first, he had expected the dark messy-haired wizard to have walked into the wrong room. His ears strained as he listened for his footsteps to descend out of the room and down the corridor, but they never did. They just grew louder, Potter’s dark brown, always scuffed, boots slamming against the floor. Often, Draco had wondered how the man had ever gotten through certain parts of their auror training; Potter wasn’t clumsy but he walked heavily, noisily, slamming his feet to the ground with each step. Very little stealth.
“So what if there’s me?” Harry shrugged and Draco realized that he must not have been willing to admit what Draco was making so plainly obvious, and that was fine. He was allowed to.
They were in the middle of a Sunday tea when he felt faint. It wasn’t rare that he felt faint these days, but he had many excuses and reasons for this. For starters, he seldom slept. He refused to take sleeping potions for his nightmares, refused potions for his anxiety, refused potions for his depression, and refused to speak to anyone about any of it. He had handled so much alone already; he could handle this, too.
Harry looked at Draco, looking at the sky, the building behind them, his own hands and said simply, “Yeah. I mean, we didn’t really...did we have the chance before, Draco? Were we ever given a second to be who we were together? Were we ever given the chance to even get to know one another before now?”
For the remainder of the day, Harry worked on case files while Draco read. After a lunch of broth and potions, he helped Draco move from the window to the bed, when Draco’s bones hurt too bad for him to move by himself. He had been so hesitant to let on that he needed to move but couldn’t. Harry noticed. Of course, Harry noticed. He let Draco put his weight on him, he wrapped his arm around his waist and slowly they moved to the bed, where he helped Draco sit.
Stretching, Draco noticed that for the first time in a long time, his body wasn’t screaming with pain. Instead, there was a dull soreness in his joints, in his neck—a soreness that would bother someone else was a soreness that Draco was grateful for—and he sat up, raising his arms high above his head before slipping out of bed and making his way to the balcony.
The morning he was told that treatment wasn’t working, that they were going to have to try something else, something experimental if he was willing, Harry wasn’t there; Draco wished he had been. He wished that Harry could find out that Draco was going to die without having to tell him.
His bare feet hit the warm cement on the balcony, and he took in a deep breath to smell the ocean air. Harry had insisted they take a vacation. They spend some time somewhere warm and salty. Draco thought he’d hate it. He liked the cold. He liked the rain. He liked grey days. Yet, he found that with Harry, he didn’t care where he was, he would love it simply because he was with this man that loved him so wholly, this man that carried his heart in the pocket of trousers—so trusting of it with the world, with Draco.
“You’ve always been there. Always. Now you’re here and you’re so warm and alive and...I am so tired. Harry. Harry. Harry. I’m so tired.”
“This is where you’ll be for the whole treatment, yeah?” Harry asked, walking beyond Draco now, and pulling out a chair to sit in.
Draco nodded at Potter, eyeing him, studying him. Potter was handsome, there was no denying that. Draco was handsome, too—he was not ignorant to this. He had always had girls in all houses sending him love letters, flirting with him, asking him to Hogsmeade and so on, but he wasn’t interested. He never had been. Draco’s first love had been Theodore Nott. It was another reason he struggled so much to gain his father’s affection; he knew the older Malfoy harboured disdain at his son for not “carrying on the bloodline”. It didn’t matter, he supposed. He wasn’t going to argue that there were ways for him to have a child and be a homosexual. It wasn’t worth his time, and, he thought, it certainly didn’t matter. Not now that he was likely going to die.
“I’m usually here until five. It depends on how my body responds. Sometimes I get quite ill, and I wait until that passes.”
It had been a few months now since that morning Harry showed up at St Mungo’s. Anytime a healer came to give reports to Draco Harry would excuse himself. There were a few times that Draco wanted to tell him he could stay. That it wasn’t that private, and that it didn’t matter, anyway. Soon enough, everyone would know, it’d be in the papers for sure.
In his head, Draco had a list of the things that improved, the things that grew worse, the things that stayed exactly the same. After a week, they released him to go home. He wasn’t to return to work. He wasn’t to exert himself. Twice a week he had to come in for treatments, a combination of charm work and chugging bitter potions, that would last almost all day.
He’d always woke up early, even as a young child, even as a teenager, beginning his day before the sun rose, even on the longest of days.
The room he was in was chilled, and much like a cat sunning, Draco sat, leaning against the window. The morning light pressed against the left side of him, and his cheek and shoulder grew warm. Hearing the footsteps stopping on the threshold of the room, he turned his head slightly and glanced over his right shoulder to see Harry Potter standing in the doorway.
Draco never intended to kiss Harry, not on his lips or his cheeks and certainly not his neck. But he did. He let himself go for a fraction of a second, and it was a second he could never get back. He’d exposed every inch of himself to Harry in that moment and the moments that followed.
Draco wouldn’t have gone to the fucking healer if not for his parents, well if he were being honest, if not for his mum. He truly didn’t give two swollen testicles about what his father thought about the whole thing. After the war, after the trials, and after his father returned home from his stint in Azkaban, Draco couldn’t quite understand why his mum hadn’t divorced his father.  He only tolerated being around his father for his mum, anyhow. Sunday tea. Wednesday evenings for dinner and chess. He would nod curtly to the man he so resembled—the man he had spent so many years trying to impress and appease—and then the rest of his evening he would speak and listen solely to his mum.
“Please, don’t touch me, Potter,” tears were already forming in his eyes, and he had to get out of his flat. Quickly, he slid into his boots, not bothering to tie them, and ran down the stairs and out into the cold night. The cold was a shock. They had heated the balcony; he hadn’t realized just how cold it had gotten outside. He saw his breath in front of him, his teeth began to chatter, and his tears felt as if they’d been boiled when they spilt onto his cheeks.
Immediately, Draco was admitted to St Mungo’s. The healers spoke to him in numbers, and he appreciated it. Numbers he understood, and they obliged. After every infusion and every test and every pinch of a needle, they would run the numbers with him.
Draco shook his head, refusing to answer. Refusing to admit to Harry everything he had to admit. “Voldemort. All of this. I’m being punished, Potter. Punished for everything, and I deserve it. And now there’s you on top of this sickness and, Merlin, if it was just me it would be so much easier to accept this fate, but now there’s you.”
She didn’t come with him after that first time; he’d gently told her not to. He told her that he didn’t want their time together to be spent there. That he’d see her at tea on Sundays and for dinner and chess on Wednesdays, like always, as if nothing had changed.
In an hour, Draco would make his way to the kitchen. He’d eat some toast with apple marmalade. He’d take five different varieties of potions. Five seemed like nothing these days. He’d go for a run, he’d take a hot shower, then he’d crawl back into bed with Harry and he’d thank him over and over and over.
Potter, though, was handsome in a way that was messy, very different from himself. Draco was clean lines and sharp edges, crisp collars and shined shoes—cool like stone. Harry was rough and curved. His hair was never fixed. His glasses always seemed to have a smudge on them. Even though he seemed to shave every morning, he always had scruff before he even got into the office. Draco often wondered if the man just trimmed it down or perhaps shaved before bed, just so that he’d always have a rugged look. Harry was messy—wild like fire. And, seeing him now, sitting there in front of him, his fingers laced together as he leaned over, a half-smile on his mouth, Draco felt an odd wave of attraction towards him. As if, seeing him in this context was not like seeing Harry James Potter, but just seeing a handsome man, someone entirely separate from their history together.
Draco shut his eyes against the other man’s warm body, and felt Harry’s hands underneath his armpits, bringing him up from his knees. Wordlessly, he let Harry lead him inside, let him take off his shoes, let him unbutton his shirt, let him put him in bed. Harry sat next to him, and the tips of his fingers ran along his forehead and nose, over and over, lulling Draco to sleep.
He had begun to believe that all of this was punishment, the universe aligning in a way to ensure that he suffered for every ill-thought, every cruel action, every sin committed. And that was fine, he thought, in many ways, he thought that succumbing to this illness would be more peaceful than fighting against it, than trying to matter, than trying to act as if he deserved to live among the rest of the world. His mother would be sad, yes, but she would be okay, too. She had friends. She had friends with children she cared about. She’d find comfort elsewhere. If his death caused his father to suffer, then that was another benefit of dying. As for Potter? Potter would be relieved of whatever saviour-like duties he had saddled himself with. He could go back to whatever life he had outside of his visits with Draco.
Harry continued to step forward, he held out his hand, “I don’t know why you’re suddenly so upset, but we have to get you back inside; it’s far too cold for me out here, let alone you.”
For weeks, he spent his treatment days alone. He would read early on in the day, he’d then sit very still with his eyes shut trying not to retch, he’d drink bone broth slowly before the second part of treatment, then chug at least twenty different vials of whatever—he had tried to keep track of them at first, but he didn’t have the energy to do so, and so he just took whatever it was they gave him, swallowing each drop with neither enthusiasm nor reluctance—then he would sleep as best he could while he waited for them to run follow-up tests, and then he would go home and stare at the sky.
Potter wasn’t just a loud walker, he also took up space. Unlike some men, it didn’t appear that Potter did this as a way to assert dominance or to shout that he was an Alpha male, it was more that he didn’t know what else to do with himself, so spread out. His legs were spread wide as he sat in the chair, and even though he was shorter than Draco, he was still a big man. He had broad shoulders, muscular limbs, and his thighs were thick, straining against the material of his trousers. When Draco sat, he was far more relaxed than Potter seemed to be. Draco had always been tall, always been lithe and lean, and he sat poised, his legs crossed with his arms in his lap and his back straight and regal.
Draco collapsed; he dropped to his knees, at his height his forehead reached Harry’s belly, and he pressed his face against the other man. His mind felt blank, an empty chasm, blank and dark and hollow. His hands shook and he gripped onto the other man’s legs, his fingers tight against the fabric of Harry’s trousers—clinging to him.  Trying to steady himself, Draco drew in a deep breath through his nose, the way his healer recommended he do when he felt particularly nauseous after treatment; he found that it was the deep breath that steadied him at that moment, but the distinct warm smell of Harry, who smelled of coffee and clean laundry and mahogany. Part of Draco hated how good it made him feel to smell him. He began to cry, his tears soaking through the other man’s shirt. Against the material he muffled through sobs, “He takes and he takes and he takes. It’ll never go away. Never.”
“For next class, I’d like a roll of parchment discussing any of the ingredients I mentioned. Choose one, then write about its usage throughout Wizarding history. Feel free to spend two or three lines summarizing rather than adding more information. Dismissed.”
I decided I was going to write this fic after seeing a dramione fic with a similar concept (which I never actually read), which I thought this would work much better as a drarry fic. For one, I could never see Hermione as a teacher. There's both a reason that she had Harry teach the DA, and a reason that AO3 has an entire tag dedicated to "Teacher Harry Potter". In addition, I thought putting Draco and Harry as adults in Hogwarts would be the best place for them to reexamine their relationship. I'm a big fan of parallels. I also wanted to try my hand at writing another longfic - and not taking four and a half years to finish it this time. I've managed to complete most of my multi-chaptered works over the years, but it took 107k words for James and Lily to kiss in OTT, and I want to see a little bit more of the relationship in this slow burn. So here's what you can expect from this one: retrospection; atonement; slow burn; relationship development; and, if the past is at all an indicator of my writing style, lots of time jumps and dialogue.
It was as if they were doomed to mirror each other, as if one is always carefully examining the other to make sure he was doing the exact opposite.
“Right,” Malfoy said after a few moments of silence. Harry realized he’d been staring – and oddly, Malfoy had been staring back. “Well. Good night.”
“Thank you. Since this is the first lesson of the year, I’d like to talk a little about what to expect from this year.
No matter what he wishes he had done different, however, he was here now, and he had to calm down. He would wash his face, and he would breathe, and he’d change his clothing into something Potter hadn’t touched, so his skin wouldn’t feel like it’s on fire. Maybe he would even take a shower.
Draco snorted. Who would’ve thought a decade ago that he would be thankful for Neville Longbottom (who had been in the staff room that morning when he received his correspondence), of all people. Or that he would be so desperate to hide his mail from Harry Potter, for that matter.
His face had grown thin then, along with his entire body. He looked like a walking skeleton, with his thin, almost translucent skin, and those sinking gray eyes. He couldn’t eat for a long time even after the trials. It made him sick. For weeks after his pardon he sat in bed, the last words of the trial repeating themselves in his head:
He thought he could finally get away. He thought he could avoid Potter. He thought, for some foolish reason, that it would be different this time.
In July, a column was written about him. It was printed on page 7 of the Daily Prophet, consisted mostly of details of his trial, and mentioned his new position once in the very last paragraph.
He knew what he was doing when he applied to the position. He knew he could teach this class. He also knew that Potter would be there, every day, sitting at the same table as him. It was unavoidable, and he would simply have to confront his own anxiety head on.
Perhaps, with time, it’ll get easier. For now, all he had was resilience and power of will, and, well. He was a Slytherin. He knew how to persevere.
This new year, however, did not have the slower pace the previous year had started with, but instead jumped straight into the immense speed with which the time had passed during the second term of the previous year. He mostly managed to avoid Malfoy, never being alone in a room with him except for that one awkward encounter at the beginning of October. By the time Halloween arrived, Harry had gotten used to Malfoy’s constant presence – at least, for the most part. At times he could swear he felt his gaze on him, causing his entire body to feel prickly; but whenever he turned to match his gaze, he found Malfoy deeply engaged in conversation with another teacher, or grading papers in the staff room, or focused on eating his meal,  no sign at all that he had even glanced in Harry’s direction.
Harry nodded, and that seemed to break the trance they had both been in; Harry found himself suddenly able to move again. As he and Draco passed each other moments later, however, Harry could’ve sworn he heard Malfoy inhale sharply as they accidentally grazed each other’s shoulders, as if Harry’s mere touch, mere proximity, caused him pain.
Later, when his face looked healthy, if older than it should, he went looking for work. But it turns out that an ex-Death Eater, even one that had been acquitted on all charges, was not a popular man in today’s Wizarding World. If anything, the only reason he wasn’t outright put out on the street and burned on the pyre was because he was a Malfoy, and even after the war, after the trials, after the ministry seized so much of their property and funds, the Malfoys were still incredibly rich. In fact, if Draco had wanted to sit in bed for the rest of his life, he would have had the funds to do so.
The morning of Halloween passed pleasantly, and he spent most of it going over material they had already studied, to give the students – and himself – a brief break. The feast was wonderful, of course, Hagrid’s pumpkins looking particularly fantastic. At the end of it, however, full to the brim and having thoroughly enjoyed himself, he realized he had left the fourth year Gryffindor students’ homework in the staff room, and although he was already halfway to his rooms, he retraced his steps and made his way there, instead.
And he could feel Potter’s eyes burning a hole into the side of his head, which made it very difficult to eat.
“We cannot blame him for the path his life took, because none of us here can possibly know that we would have not followed the exact same path had we been in the same circumstances.
Harry was surprised, however, to hear him respond, in a quite sincere – and reserved, in a quiet way – tone, “Thank you.”
Harry couldn’t help it; he glanced at back at Malfoy, who was steadily walking away from him. Perhaps he had imagined it.
School started, and I'm a bit busy, so updates are going to be as slow as... well, the updates were on OTT. Well, maybe not that slow. But y'know, they're not going to be every week. Although I'm trying to write a little bit more, in honor of NaNo (as usual, I am too busy and tired to participate).
His letter to one Minerva McGonagall was answered promptly, and over the next month they corresponded regularly. At the end of that long May she confirmed that Slughorn was, in fact, retiring that year, and that the position was his, should he want it.
(Harry still had trouble with the concept, despite being her colleague for more than a year now). He swiped them up quickly and stuffed them in an inside pocket of his robe, and Harry noticed that the pile was rather thin – only a few pieces, five or six at most. Maybe it was essays from his N.E.W.T. classes. Harry didn’t know what minimum grade Malfoy demanded from his post O.W.L. students – Harry himself only accepted Es and Os, but he wouldn’t be surprised if Malfoy was even stricter and only accepted O-level students.
And true, at first there were a couple of stumbles. He got halfway through a lecture and realized he’d forgotten where he was going, or had been unable to properly discipline a classroom. But if there was one thing Harry Potter was good at, it was in building trust. And by the end of that first year, nobody could imagine Hogwarts without him.
Draco stammered for a moment, unsure of what to say, when Harry spoke up. “He’ll be here Ted. Just head on to my bathroom and I’ll meet you in there.” An excited squeal came from Teddy before he hurried off down the hall. Harry turned to look at Draco, and his face was a light shade of pink from what Draco could see from underneath the mess of flour and egg that covered most of him. “I apologize if I overstepped with that. I just know he’s had so much fun today and I couldn’t take that from him.” He shrugged, leaning against the kitchen wall.
He stuffed his hand in his pocket and it brushed against the card that Potter had given him. He pulled the card out of his pocket and turned it over again between his fingers.
Harry walked over to the sitting room and stared back at the blonde man looking back at him, he wasn’t sure what was happening, but he nodded anyway. Malfoy walked through the fire and into the sitting room. He looked around and then his eyes landed on Harry, cold and grey as Harry had always remembered them being, but there was something different about them, they looked, pained.
“Well?” Draco sneered, but Harry detected a slight change in his tone though, it didn’t seem as arrogant and distasteful as usual. Harry thought Malfoy seemed, put off in a sense.
Harry laughed, “It was this very bright lime green. It reminded me of Fudge’s old bowler to be honest.” Harry leaned back in his chair remembering the morning, Teddy’s bright green hair flailing around on top of his head. “I guess you’re right Ron.” He smiled. “It didn’t seem to carry on to this morning.”
But, standing in front of him, was not the same Harry Potter that Draco had remembered. The man in front of him had long almost black hair pulled up in a bun, secured by his wand, a few stray groups of hair that probably didn’t go all the way back hung gently in front and around the frame of his face. He was no longer young and skinny, in the years since they had last laid eyes on each other, Potter had aged, Draco couldn’t tell whether it was from time or from everything that they had gone through during and after the war, but it was definitely noticeable. He had gone from skinny and somewhat lanky, to having a toned and muscular build.
The day was just like any other, closing out cases, chatting with Ron though lunch and meeting up with Hermione before he went back to work after.
Malfoy entered Harrys flat quickly and suddenly. He stepped out onto the rug in front of the fireplace looked directly at Harry. Harry, being surprised and dumbstruck, just stared at Draco.
Harry slapped some muggle money on the bar, enough that he knew would be more than what he and Eric had drank. “Keep the change Bert.” Harry said as he rushed out the door of the Pub.
Harry rolled his eyes at the child and pulled him down off the counter. He set him at the table and made himself a plate. Once finished with breakfast, Harry cleaned up and changed Teddy and himself and dropped off his godson to Andromeda’s house. After what seemed like an hour of Andromeda complaining about his job, Harry finally set off to work.
“Wait, Draco.” Harry stood up and placed a hand on his shoulder, which sent shivers through his spine, something that he had never felt before and surprised him. “Molly invited you to come for dinner as well.” Harry smiled widely and held the parchment out in front of him for Draco to read to confirm his suspicions that Harry could clearly see play on his face from his statement.
“Um, well, I’ve been okay I guess. Harry’s probably told you all about my problems, being his best friends and all.” He shrugged and sat down in a puffy armchair that was just behind him.
Draco went to go sit with his mother after being at the hospital for an hour, Astoria’s labor was taking longer than either of them had predicted. He looked up from the floor as he entered the guest waiting room to the suite and saw his mother, eyes wide with worry, her hands running over themselves in nervousness. He had never seen his mother this way in his life. Narcissa was always a look of calm for as long as he could remember. Even at his father’s trial, she had a look of calm about her that, to be honest, unnerved Draco. The only other time he had not seen his mother calm, was their own trial, but this was not the look she carried that day.
“I wanted to make pancakes again Daddy.” The boy smiled, turning back into the kitchen and showing Harry the giant mess of flour, eggs, milk and bowls everywhere. “I watched you yesterday and I wanted to make some again, but you were sleeping so good I didn’t want to wake you up today.” Teddy turned away from Harry as he was saying this. He walked determinedly back to his bowl of batter on the counter which had a chair pressed up against it. Teddy climbed up in the chair and took one of the many measuring cups that had been sprawled out across the counter and scooped out some batter and put it into a pan. Harry watched as the boy kept his eyes on the pan, watching the bubbles form on the uncooked side of the pancake, and when he thought it was ready, he took the spatula that sat next to him and very carefully flipped the pancake. Teddy watched closely again for a few moments and then turned the pancake over once more to check the other side, and after deciding that it was good enough, he put it on the plate he had next to the batter, put some syrup on top, placed a fork in the center, and walked over to Harry, who was still standing in the entrance of the kitchen, surprise still on his face as he watched his godson in front of him with amazement. Harry took the plate, took a bite of the pancake, and smiled at his godson, who was watching him with expectant eyes.
“Astoria’s resting, it seems to be taking longer than –,” Draco was caught off by a healer walking into the room, silently nodding to him. “I’ll be back.” He kissed both the women on the cheeks and hurried back to his wife.
Draco read the note three times over to make sure that he was reading everything correctly. He was, and with every word he read, his heart sank even more. The happy, comfortable feeling that he had previously felt coming home had disappeared. He sank back into his chair, waited for the takeaway and drank himself into a slumber. He was just done with the day at this point and didn’t see a reason to do anything else.
Harry sat back down on the couch and smiled at Draco and Teddy. “Well, I guess I’m going to have to believe you.” He shrugged. “So, what’s next then?”
“Meeting up at the Cauldron after work mate?” Ron’s head had appeared through the crack in Harry’s office door, smiling his usual freckled grin that he typically wore at the end of the day. Harry sighed and looked down at his desk, he still had 3 more cases that had closing paperwork that needed to be drawn up and filed. He knew that he would be here for at least half past end of business day.
“This weekend? But Daddy, I’m going to be at Grandma’s this weekend.” Harry turned to look at the boy and saw him with his head buried in the pillows sighing heavily. “It’s no fair.”
Draco almost laughed at his mother being called Aunt Cissy, but he held his composure for the sake of the child. “Yes, yes I am. And you must be Teddy.” Draco smiled at him, realizing the boy was only looking at him the way he was to make sure his memory was serving him well.
Teddy jumped in Draco’s lap and Harry had moved to remove him, but Draco looked up and just shook his head at Harry, letting him know that it was okay, he could stay where he was. Harry nodded and moved back to where he was sitting. Draco looked down at Teddy and the boy returned his gaze. He didn’t say a word, he just moved his stuffed wolf into Draco’s hands.
“Teddy made us do it. He said since I don’t call either one of you by your last names, I shouldn’t call Draco by his.” Harry shrugged it off and turned back to his cases.
Harry laughed louder at this and leaned back on the couch. “I feel bad for McGonagall.” He shook his head at the realization. “I mean, she’s going to be in so much trouble with him, he’s as smart as his father was and just as much of a rebel as his mother was.”
invite you.” He laughed softly to himself as he said this, still trying to figure out why he did in the first place.
“True, you did marry and have a child with Ron, and honestly, how wise of a decision is that really?” He nudged her playfully as she swatted his arm.
“You made it.” Harry said with a smile, but the tone in his voice hinted surprise, seeing as he partially didn’t expect Malfoy to show up.
Teddy giggled as he watched Draco’s face while he changed his hair and finally handed him the book in his hands. “Uncle Draco, can you please read me this book? It’s my favorite.”
“I really am sorry Meda.” Harry looked down at his feet and shuffled, he really hated coming by late to get Teddy, it always made him feel bad.
“If you ever need to talk or anything Malfoy,” He heard Potter saying, his voice slowly backing away, “Just reach out.” Draco heard something move next to him, and when he turned his head after it went silent for what seemed like a reasonable amount of time to assume Potter had left, and noticed a card on edge of the window to the pub. Draco grabbed it and saw the same scratchy handwriting he remembered from his childhood.
“Right.” Ron nodded, finally remembering what Harry had told him yesterday. “How is the little guy? Feel like I haven’t seen him in ages.”
Granted as the days had gotten easier to get out of the house and being able to go and do small errands such as shopping for food didn’t seem as if he was going to be mobbed, he started to finally feel the effects of the war on him. All the loss in his life had started to finally hit him, the faces of his loved ones crossing his mind daily, at random times, during random events. But when he went to sleep, that’s when the worst of it happened. The dreams had started out of nowhere, small ones at first, flashes of his childhood at the Dursley’s, the random mishaps at Hogwarts, the banters with Malfoy and Snape. But then the dreams got worse, full scenes of the war would play out in his mind, reminding him of everything that happened in intricate detail. His mind kept playing the deaths of his fellow students in front of him, and he could hear everything, all their screams, their tears, saw their eyes as life escaped him. He woke up in a pool of his own sweat on a constant nightly basis.
“Only if you needed it.” Potter shrugged, he looked taken aback by Draco’s words, looking as though they stung him.
“I don’t want to talk about it Potter.” Draco spat; he really didn’t want to talk about his problems with Potter. “Change the subject.” He turned to Harry and his eyes were like daggers towards the man.
“I watched you when we went to Grandma’s house with the cup of dirt at the fireplace and so I grabbed some of that, threw it in the fireplace like you do, and then I just said Uncle Draco’s name out loud and his face just showed up in the fire! It was awesome.” Teddy giggled at the action and turned to look at Draco.
“Okay, that I can understand, you always did have the need to help people even when we were eleven. I mean, it made no sense, but you still did it. But what I never could figure out, is how the hell you and Weasley had knocked it out?” Draco leaned in and grabbed the cup of tea that Harry had set in front of him, but he never took his eyes off the man, intent on finding out the end to this story.
“Something wrong Malfoy?” He had eggs clinging to his beard, but he didn’t seem to notice, or care, much to Draco’s disbelief.
“Mornin’ Malfoy.” Draco looked up at the voice and saw his boss, Mr. Elowite, was cleaning a couple of potions vials as he walked in. Draco nodded and walked over to his desk.
The rest of the week seemed to fly by, with Ron and Hermione finally letting go of their constant questions and Draco still making his nightly 10 o’clock visits, Harry was shocked when he woke up Saturday morning to the smell of…
Harry walked into the Ministry feeling lighter than he had in years. He walked into his office to find a mess of bushy brown hair directly in front of him. He stopped suddenly and closed his door, making Hermione turn suddenly, Ron sitting directly behind her in Harry’s office chair.
Harry picked up Teddy and placed him gently in his lap, they boy had slunk into Harry’s chest, holding the photo even tighter. “Can you tell me the story Daddy?” Teddy whispered into Harry’s chest softly.
“For?” He put his cup on the table and leaned with his hands clasped in front of him, elbows on his knees.
The corners of Draco’s mouth lifted as he watched the boy laugh, wiping tears from his bright violet eyes.
“I DO!” Draco was screaming now, and he didn’t think he could control his anger anymore. “You’re the fucking prat that turned down a handshake of an eleven-year-old boy who just wanted to be friends. The arsehole that decided that making a classmate’s life a living fucking hell for 6 years was a good fucking idea. You let Granger PUNCH ME IN THE FACE! YOU TRIED TO FUCKING
It was the lightest Draco’s chest had felt in months when he walked back into his home from the fireplace. He looked around his home and noticed that it didn’t even look as dark and dreary as it had before. He smiled to himself before the realization of why he felt this way had finally hit him. Harry Potter. The one person who used to make his stomach twist in anger. The reason his words used to be filled with venom in his childhood. The one person that shouldn’t make him feel better about anything had made him feel better about, well, fuck, everything really.
He had grown a beard, more of a five o’clock shadow more than anything, but from the looks of it, if he went more than a day or two, it would be a noticeable beard. He could still see the scar above his right eye, but the lightning bolt was slowly faded in a way that if you didn’t already know it was there, you would look right over it, granted the change in length of the hair probably helps hide it like it used to do when they were younger. The thin gold circular framed glasses were still there, but they seemed to either fit his face better or he had finally gotten a pair that wouldn’t slide off his face.
“Nah, not a boyfriend. Haven’t had one of them in a long time.” He looked up at Draco, who now had an eyebrow raised, obviously questioning this whole conversation now. “Well, I might as well tell you now, seeing as I’ve already let the crupe out of the bag.” Harry stood up and walked into the hall, Draco was worried he might come back with something to hurt him. When Harry walked back in the room, Harry was carrying a photograph in his hands. Draco could see the occupants moving from the distance, but he couldn’t tell who they were this far away. Harry handed Draco the photo and he looked at it closely, and he saw Harry, must’ve been not too long ago with how long his hair was in the picture, but there was a boy in the picture with him. The boy had vibrant purple hair that stuck up in multiple directions, and his eyes, Draco had to do a double take to make sure he was seeing them correctly. The boy’s eyes were a bright, almost bone chilling silver. Draco looked up at Harry in shock. He raised an eyebrow at Harry to explain. “He’s my son.” Draco’s shock changed to surprise, his eyes wide and taking in Harry’s face, which was now showing a look of unconditional love. “My godson actually, Teddy.” He took the photo from Draco’s hand, beaming at it.
“What are you getting on about?” Harry shook his head in disbelief. They had started this, and Harry saw no end to it. “What do you mean by, if they knew who I really was? You act as if
“Then why not come at the same time today? Did you just know that I would be home in the middle of a Saturday?”
“And Malfoy?” Harry called after him. Draco turned around on the spot. “Please shave. I’d like Teddy to see what the Draco Malfoy I grew up with looked like. He doesn’t need to think that half-ass grown beards are something to be proud of. I’d rather him think beards like mine are something to aspire to.” Draco almost went off when he noticed Harry had a huge grin on his face, trying his hardest to hide his laughter, and Draco smiled.
Harry shook his head, smiling slightly at Hermione and her need to constantly mother him. He dove back into his work and before he knew it, it was time to leave. He packed up his cases into his filing cabinet and headed out to meet Ron at the Cauldron.
. Draco looked back at the man once more and while noticing the pride in his face, he saw something completely different in his eyes. It was a look Draco had only seen from his mother, a look that she only reserved for him, never shown to anyone else, not even his father. It was
in the school and you and Weasley just so happened to knock the damn thing unconscious. What were the two of you
“Anytime Draco.” He squeezed Draco’s shoulder gently and headed down the hall where they could both hear Teddy calling for him.
“Well, McGonagall,” Harry laughed slightly as the words sounded odd when he said them out loud to her. “It’s just that, well, I’ve had an old classmate that’s been coming by my home nightly. But what’s odd about it, is that they come by at the same time every night, they don’t say a word, they have a couple of drinks, and then they leave. It’s happened every night for the past week and I’m not really sure what to make of it.”
Harry sat down at the bar and ordered a Scotch, took a small sip and the tension that he hadn’t realized he was holding in his shoulders, released. He sighed, leaned back in his seat and smiled again.
“You alright Draco? You seemed to have gone paler than usual, which I honestly didn’t think that could be possible.” Harry had placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder and was looking into his eyes with such intensity that Draco could see the small flecks of gold that flitted in between the deep emerald that he knew so well.
Draco and Teddy both looked at Harry, who was now doubled over, clutching his stomach, laughing so had his breath kept catching. Teddy turned back and looked up at Draco. Draco raised an eyebrow at the boy and looked up at Harry and then back down. Teddy, who seemed to catch on to Draco’s thoughts, smiled mischievously and nodded subtly so Harry couldn’t catch on. They both grabbed a handful of flour and looked directly at Harry. He saw them staring at him and straightened up.
“Good Morning Draco.” Professor McGonagall started walking towards the three of them standing just in front of the fireplace.
He shook off the thoughts once more and finally headed for bed. He didn’t need to think about these oddities tonight. He finally slipped into bed after a relaxing and thought removing shower and fell peacefully to sleep.
“Sorry Teddy, I’m just the Uncle. Your dad wins this one.” Draco laughed and looked up to receive a mouthed
“I meant to ask, you seemed as if you knew the story quite well.” Harry questioned, raising an eyebrow. “How is that?”
“I heard a lot of them, I thought some of them were pretty great to be honest. I think my favorite one that I had heard was that Ron and I had bribed him with sweets that we stored in our robes and then hit him in the head with a broken toilet.” Harry laughed as he remembered hearing the story cross through the halls back in his first year.
“Long day mate?” A voice next to Harry said gruffly, startling him. He snapped his head up, worried it was someone that knew who he was.
“Draco, it’s so good to see you, how’ve you been?” Granger shook Draco’s hand gently and sat down on the couch that was just on the other side of the room, where Teddy ran over and jumped into her lap. Draco looked her over and noticed that she didn’t look much different than she did back in school, a head full of bushy brown hair, a stern but careful look in her eyes, and an air of sophistication that only Hermione Granger could have. The only thing that was different about her was a thin gold band on her left ring finger that could have only meant one thing.
He had liked Harry since before he knew he was his soulmate, although he hadn’t been able to make the other boy know that, and instead began an enemies relationship that lasted until Harry found him crying in a bathroom in Sixth Year. That was when he  had told Harry  what happened, what the Dark Lord had wanted of him, and Harry had helped him as best as he could, even when Draco refused to talk to Dumbledore about it.
He moved a bit on the sofa where he was laying, with his legs on Harry’s lap and his head on a pile of cushions, but he was still uncomfortable. It didn’t help that his usual slim body had changed to imitate that of a whale.
“DRACO!” Michael screamed again, and this time Harry heard steps from behind. He turned and saw Draco coming slowly, very pale and with scared eyes. “Finally! Let’s go home! I’ve had enough of this nonsense!”
Harry headed happily for his bedroom — or should he say their bedroom from now on? It was a good idea. Besides, he needed the money.
Michael greets me with a nod, and I nod back at him. He’s an idiot, but he’s smart enough to figure things out if we get suspicious. I see today’s copy of
Draco nodded. He too looked at Harry as if it was the first time. He looked at the bright, green eyes that he had always found so beautiful; at the full lips that were smiling so kindly at him; at the tanned skin with two moles near the nose… Was it that easy? All the waiting, all the crying, the shattered hopes and dreams, and they have been soulmates all along? Happy endings seemed too unreal for Draco, but it made sense. His dreams finally made sense too.
Harry: Ron says that I have done enough grieving, and that I should get back to our daily training, and to work.
“It wasn’t that hard.” He shrugged. “I may have gone there and they saw my scar and almost forced me to book a table.”
“I’m sorry, I —” Harry felt how he blushed too. “I didn’t intend to stare. I just — I had forgotten about it.”
In spite of the winter weather, sunlight bathed the room, making it look cosy. He had often mocked Draco about how serious it looked, like an old lawyer’s office. However, Harry felt a pang of longing when he saw the mahogany furniture, and the dark green leather sofa. They were another reminder that Draco was far away now.
“You’ve told me that,” Draco interrupted hastily. “But when are you going to do that, eh? What’s the difference between telling them now or next week?”
Draco left work early that Tuesday, so he, Pansy, and Greg met in a café in Diagon Alley to enjoy the summer afternoon together.
With a sigh, he tried to focus on the Transfiguration class. They were supposed to transform a toad into a cat, but only Granger had managed to make some hair grow.
“At different times,” Draco reminded her. “I’ll use it at night and he in the mornings, and I’ll have the flat for myself on the weekends too. It’s perfect! And cheap. I can’t afford anything else, and no way I’m paying for that mouldy flat we saw in Knockturn Alley.”
The two of them go down, but somehow it feels different now. She knows it isn’t much and that her father should have tried harder since the beginning, but it’s so strange for him to apologize that Draco wants to believe him this time.
“Uh, Draco… the towel!” He hid behind the shower curtain, and Draco seemed to snap out of his staring too, as he turned to find the towel.
“You’re going to share your bed with a stranger!” Ron said, still looking at Harry as if he had gone nuts in front of him.
“He says it’s fine? He knows who you are too?” Hermione finally snapped out of her astonishment. “Was this one of those notes of yours?”
Draco smiles to herself. It always makes her happy to see Harry and her mother getting along so well. It was one of her biggest fears, back when she and Harry started dating, that her family and he would fight. However, her parents, especially her mother, were wonderful about it. Lucius has always been special though.
Harry: Goyle's going to be my partner now, although he takes half an hour to draw even the simplest things, but no way am I pairing up with Pansy! She's scary, and so is Blaise. And I wouldn't dare break the unstoppable force that's Hermione-Ginny.
“No, sorry. I have something to tell you, and I don’t know how you’re going to react,” he said, which immediately made Hermione’s eyebrows relax.
“Yes! There was a vase in the kitchen table, another one in a small blue cabinet he put next to the fridge, another one in a huge desk he brought, and another one in the bathroom! And don’t let me start on what he did in the kitchen! He reorganised everything because apparently, he was unable to find anything in it,” Harry ended with a shake of his head.
“But you are!” Harry’s eyes still shone, and he looked at Draco as if it was the first time he saw it, like trying to learn his face by heart. “The song I’ve been hearing in my dreams is this spell! I can’t hear you, so the soulmate’s magic must have found a way around it, can’t it?”
“It’s the most beautiful voice I’ve ever heard! It was singing a song, you know? It was so soft, and sweet! Like a lullaby, only… sexier too.” Harry’s cheeks had gone red in his excitement, something that Draco couldn't help but found adorable.
Draco woke up with a start. It was the first time Harry said something like that in his dreams. In all the other ones he’d had, he made it clear that they belonged together. Was this some twist in the soulmate dreams, or was it just a normal dream fed with Draco’s fears?
I can help Harry. I can end this. When he comes back, he’ll see how much I love him, and we’ll be as we were before, with the sex, and the passion, and the kisses.
“Michael. He comes here a lot and asks me things about you. I’m tired of fixing your relationship, Malfoy. Merlin knows why I bother.”
“A mistake my arse!” Thomas said. He had his hand on the head, and Draco saw that he had a bit of blood on his forehead. “You did it on purpose! I don’t know what’s wrong with you lately but you’ve been an arse.”
“Vega. It’s the brightest star in the Lyra constellation, so it’s like a peace offer: it’s not Lyra, but it’s close to it. Do you like it?” He looked at Harry hopefully.
Harry: As I’m sure you know, I haven’t been feeling well since Thursday, so I’ve been too busy eating buns with chocolate chips and feeling pity for myself. So I couldn’t talk to Ginny about Pansy until today.
“It’s not my fault you’re a greedy git that took like all the subjects,” Blaise said, scratching something on his parchment with anger.
Harry: Sorry about that. Hermione caught me texting you, and asked me who I was talking to. My phone fell and she saw. I had to endure an hour of her explaining that you're… that you're the d-word. As if I don't know! As if I am not painfully aware of that every second of my life.
“Who would have thought,” Draco said. Harry looked at him and saw that a small smile played in the corners of his mouth. “My crush thinks I’m pretty.” He blushed too, and turned his face to the window.
Harry: Maybe I'm too weak for this. Do you think I'm weak? I destroyed Dumbledore's office after Sirius died…
“We leave notes to each other.” Draco shrugged. It had become so normal for him, that he hadn’t thought that other roommates didn’t have tiny notes all over their flats talking about day-to-day things and some other deeper stuff.
“What?” Draco’s blood had gone cold. Then he realised, all made sense then. “You told Michael where I live, and did you tell him I was meeting my friends in that pub too, didn't you?”
“Good evening, Sarah,” he said, smiling. Her second full moon would be that night. Her parents had chosen for her to spend the night at the hospital, as she would be better cared off than at home, and Harry was very happy about it. “How are you?”
Draco had pressed himself to the wall so Harry, Weasley, and Granger couldn’t see him while he listened to their conversation. When he couldn’t handle it anymore, he ran to the Eighth years common room, where he found Pansy and dragged her to his bedroom. Luckily, none of his roommates were there.
“She harassed me, Draco. Sexually. She kept insisting and insisting, and I— It was an accident. I pushed her and she fell. She broke her neck.”
Harry: Luna was studying a magical species indigenous to Finland! That's why she was there! And drinking mulled wine, the most amazing drink on Earth! Don't worry, I'm not actually becoming an alcoholic, in fact it doesn't have alcohol at all.
The three of them went to see those rooms. They were small too, but Draco loved them instantly. There was a big tub in the bathroom, and the bedroom was very luminous, with a window that occupied an entire wall.
Draco’s hands touched Harry’s torso, marvelling at the soft skin, and then, after glancing at Harry for permission, he took his pants off.
“Can you leave us alone?” Michael looked at his friends like they were dirt, and Draco knew he wasn’t going to give up until he had what he had come to get.
He knew accepting had been a bad idea. But the night before he had been too tired to think properly, and after such a good day with Draco, he hadn’t wanted to go back alone to Ron and Hermione’s house. It had felt nice, going to bed next to someone. He smiled, remembering how Draco had warned him that he was a hugger in his sleep. Now Harry knew how true that was, as Draco’s arm tightened a bit more around his chest. He picked it up carefully and left it on the bed. He was free, although it didn’t make him feel better.
“And finally, remember to get out of Bakshi, their new beater. I don’t want any of us to end in the floor with their brains scattered all around us. Alright?” Weasley asked, frowning at all of them. “And most importantly, I don’t want to lose against my sister’s team!”
“A sexy lullaby?” he signed, with his eyebrow raised. “Who the hell is your soulmate, and what the fuck is that kink of yours, Potter?”
Harry picks her up upside down and carries her to the gardens while she screams and laughs red faced. Scorpius follows them and Narcissa, after squishing Draco’s shoulder, goes out too.
Harry: Because if that exists, you’re there, no matter what you think. You’re not evil enough to go to Hell.
Harry: However, I missed you a lot, especially at night when I had to go to bed alone and didn’t have anyone to cuddle with, knowing that in the next room Ron and Hermione were doing exactly that (I don’t want to think about what other things they might have been doing).
“Fine. So at least be kind to us. We didn’t do anything to you.” Blaise continued eating his grilled vegetables with his eyebrows furrowed, so Draco knew he would have to deal with him later.
“You’re always so serious, Lucius! Congratulate your granddaughter as you should! Hug her, for Merlin’s sake!”
4.- Harry is coming back. Everyone has affairs. They’re part of marriage. Harry is going with Yours to Spain for two days, but he’ll come back, because I’m his husband and he loves me. We made our vows long ago, we’ve been driving each other mad and been obsessed with each other for ages, we love each other.
“Do you think you’re better here with him?” Michael glanced at Harry, and a second later his eyes widened in recognition. He burst out laughing. “You’re dating Harry Potter? Dee!” He laughed again.
Angrily, he made a mess with the sheets and blankets. They ended on the floor. Soon enough, the pillows followed. He got up, and made an effort to not look at the picture on his bedside table.
“I was. It was just that one time. Way better than you, if I remember correctly.” Draco gasps feigning offense, and Lucius raises an eyebrow at her. At seeing Lily’s eager face to know more, he looks at her and continues. “Your dad always forgot to do the Writing homework. Narcissa and I had to bribe him with sweets so he did it.”
"Father, it would have been okay for you to try when I first came out. Mother tried. Pansy, Greg, Theo, Blaise… tried too. Even Harry made mistakes! It took them some time to adjust, but they all eventually did it. But it has been ten years, don't you think that if you were to really try to understand and respect me, you'd have done so years ago?"
She finished her drink and went back inside. She was right, of course, Harry didn’t remember the last time he had really talked to anyone. He was alone, and lost.
“I didn’t. I was… distracted. I mean, you were wearing just pants… your arm wasn’t something I noticed at that moment.”
Harry: I went with Ron, Hermione, and the unborn baby that is not my godchild to an Indian restaurant.
Harry only glared at him. It was too much effort to explain why he couldn’t go back to work after three weeks; how something inside him broke every time he looked at the right side of the bed; how he was scared of losing Scorpius if he went back to Hogwarts; how something was missing inside of him now. He supposed that when his husband had died, the part of Harry that belonged to him died too. It wasn’t like what had happened with the Horcrux, it was something subtler. He wondered if it was real, if healers could fix it.
“I didn’t confirm nor deny if it was Weasley.” He got up and picked up the trash bag. “Let’s get brewing. I’ll warn you before Apparating this time.”
“It’s a man. His name is Dray, and he’ll move in tomorrow, so you two can stop trying to convince me that this is a bad idea now,” Harry said, getting up and stretching a bit. He had had a long shift at St Mungo’s. He needed to rest.
“Okay. So no Greg or Vincent. Do you think my mother would work? What about when I came out to her and she hugged me?” He asked. It was one of his happiest moments with his mother. It had happened the summer before his Fifth Year, and he was so nervous, so sure she was going to reject him… However, she had hugged him and had to promise him a hundred times that it was fine, because Draco couldn’t believe what she was saying.
The summer was too hot for London, but it made the ice-cream at Fortescue’s all the more enjoyable. Harry took a spoonful of his chocolate sundae, and looked at Scorpius, who was happily eating his and reading one of his new school books.
“Dean’s right, you know, you’ve been playing badly all day too. I’ll look for someone who plays as chaser against Hufflepuff if you’re going to be like this,” Weasley said. Draco thought he was a bit worried for him, but he wasn’t sure. Ron hasn’t forgiven him as easily as Harry for the war. “Training’s over.”
“Mother is old and doesn’t remember things very well. Shall we sit down?” She takes her seat at the table quickly, and the rest follow soon after.
Harry: Okay. I know you don't care about Luna, but you do about our Leo. He whined A LOT. It's surprising how he behaves so like you without having met you. I gave him a dog biscuit afterwards and he's happy again.
Michael can’t think there was anything more than a boss-secretary relationship between Padma and Harry.
, Draco thought. With a sigh, he got up and closed his eyes. Harry was the last person he could tell his problems to. The idiot would feel guilty and go out with him or something.
Harry: He's deaf. I couldn't leave him there with all the other dogs barking and ignoring him, could I?
“How do you do it?” he asked. “I feel guilty just for being here, like I’m forgetting about him because I’m having fun at a party.”
“It’s one I found in an old Charms book,” he signed. “I haven’t tried it before, but the usual gliding spells weren’t working, and I was desperate. You were right, by the way,” he added with a smile. “Happy memories make magic work better, not only patronus.”
After some small talk, he left the room to visit his next patient. It would be easy to help Sarah and others like her. If only they had the money to buy the potions they use in other countries.
Pansy and Theo looked offended at him, and Blaise muttered something like “whatever”. He left, knowing that his friends would copy everything they could before he returned. He wandered the library until he found the Charms section. He wanted to add a bit about protective spells against dark magic, as it had been a handy knowledge to have during the war. He was about to pick
Harry: I had to do paperwork ALL MORNING. I'm this close to snapping at someone. But apparently, I'm not ready to do field work yet.
He fixed the bottle, and with some other more complicated spells he managed to restore most of the potion too.
Harry: This week reminded me of when we went to that cottage in the north of Spain. Remember when you thought you had seen a bear, and even insulted me when I told you it wasn’t, and then we did a magnifying spell and saw it was a cow? Or that time we spent all night awake, looking at the stars and almost freezing to death because it was November and we forgot we’re wizards and can cast warming charms?
“Then that’s their problem, if they can’t support their friend in his relationship.” Draco tried to say it calmly too, but it irked him a little imagining Weasley and Granger laughing at Harry because of him.
“No,” he signed. “I've just  stopped thinking about it all the time. It’s not like he’d love me back, is it? Have you learned anything new about your singer?”
“You idiot!” he snapped at Martin. “You should learn manners! Screaming doesn’t make you right, don’t you know that?”
“I should go over the contracts for the trip,” he says, picking up a blue folder, opening it, and reading whatever he has inside.
“Excellent! Ten points to Hufflepuff.” Professor Arias said. “Now, you know what I’m going to ask of you! Get up in a line and think of your happiest memory. Then say the words
Lucius looks at her, as if looking for help, but she raises her eyebrows awaiting his answer. Then he looks at Narcissa, who smirks at him, and, finally, he looks at Harry, which shows how desperate he is. Obviously, Harry just glares at him.
“I’m going to sleep too. I’m too tired to write this,” Draco signed. He didn’t bother to put his things away, knowing that none of his classmates would dare to touch them. Well, maybe his friends would, but he didn’t mind that.
He looked around and saw that most of his classmates had done it. Harry was petting a big stag with a proud smile, and a bit to his left Granger and Weasley were looking happily at theirs. Blaise was looking in astonishment at the big leopard that had appeared next to him.
Harry: Yes I know it’s bloody early for this but I couldn’t sleep because I needed to pee and then Leo woke up and followed me around so I put him on the bed with me and I don’t know how it happened because he’s tiny but now I only have a little space in the bed for myself so I can’t sleep
He raised his gaze from the pans, but lowered it almost instantly again. It was difficult to look at Scorpius. Harry focused on the food.
Draco lets her gaze wander down her reflection on the big bathroom mirror. She’s naked, and her long hair feels soft all the way down her back. Her eyes stop at her breasts. She smiles, happy, and keeps looking. Her chest is crisscrossed with scars of a long time ago, and her belly looks softer than it looked in her teenage years, but who has the time to exercise with a full time job and two little menaces roaming the house? She shrugs. Her penis is flaccid against her tight, that is marked with stretchmarks and a bruise (she had told Harry to move that stupid little table after using it, but he keeps forgetting and she keeps bumping into it). She looks at her feet. They have always looked too masculine to her, too big. Even the pale pink nail polish she uses on the toenails doesn’t hide the fact that they’re male feet. She sighs, and picks her knickers from the bench next to the mirror.
“Once the baby is born you can’t,” his mother said, at the same time she flicked her wand casting a nonverbal spell to ease his pains. He sighed in relief. “Better?”
He walked from the door to the armchair where Greg was sitting and back. His nervousness didn’t let him be still.
“You usually write better than this, you know. Okay, wish me luck finding all these things!” Harry laughed and went away.
Harry wandered from room to room as if he were a ghost. The house was too big when it was just him, but the people he needed the most were too far away. One in Scotland and the other one… He wondered if Heaven was real. Was he… Draco up there?
She rested her back on the banister of the balcony, and looked at Harry. He had come outside when he couldn’t stand the party anymore. These were Draco’s friends, not his. It felt wrong to be there without him.
He parks near a lake and gets out of the car. A person is already there waiting for him. I park, too; close, but not enough so they could see me. They talk. I think Yours is a woman. Padma. It’s Padma Patil, his coworker! I can’t believe he’s cheating on me with
“I did. I cast a locking spell.” He moved his head a little, so his mouth was just where he wanted it to be, ready to kiss Harry.
“Have you decided on a name already,” his father asked instead, finally putting away the newspaper he had been reading since he and Narcissa arrived, “or are you going to keep calling her
“I want to ask you something, but I don’t know if…” Draco bit his bottom lip and didn’t move. He had gone straight to his father as soon as he decided that he needed advice, but now that he was there, he didn’t know how to ask.
Spending a whole day with Harry had been better than what he had thought at first. He already knew his flatmate was funny and a great cook, but he had forgotten how bright his eyes were and how cute he was when he talked, moving his hands a lot. In spite of Harry’s distracting presence, Draco had done his work and was now impatient to see if he was able to replicate the new Wolfsbane Potion.
“It’s easy for you to say it, when you know your friends will be there for you no matter what,” Harry said bitterly.
He was so focused on his shower that he didn’t realise the bathroom door had been opened until he heard a gasp. He opened the curtains and stared at Draco Malfoy, who was standing in the door with his mouth agape, only wearing pants.
“What a nightmare!” He signed to Harry, and Thomas that were with him in the locking rooms. He was sitting on a bench, putting on his shoes, and Harry and Thomas were getting dressed after their shower.
She took a big sip from her cup, and Harry properly looked at her for the first time that night. As always, she had put an effort on looking dashing, but he could see the pain in her eyes. He realised that they had both lost the person they relied on the most: his husband, and her best friend.
“Fuckers,” Pansy said a bit too loudly, which earned her another glare and a throat clearing from Pince.
“They’re like rats,” Draco said, side eying Harry to see the annoyed expression he was sure would appear on his face. He smirked when Harry frowned.
“I have enough money,” Harry said, “but I spent a good amount of it for Hogwarts and then with my Healer courses. I also began a renovation at Grimmauld Place — the house I inherited from Sirius — but then stopped because I realised I didn’t want to live there. So I bought this flat instead. And now I want to buy this Wolfsbane Potion, or to pay someone to create something similar. So there, I’m not a perv. I told you.”
Harry: As I was stuck at home with Cassie, I watched a lot of shitty TV shows and I realised that they're liars. The police told a woman that her husband had been killed, and did she break into a thousand pieces and sob uncontrollably? No. She let out two tears (I counted them), and then told the police about how wonderful her husband was. That's bullshit! The healers told me my husband had… the d-word, and it took me A MONTH to feel like a normal person again and to start talking about you!
“Maybe it is,” Draco signed with a blissful smile. They looked at the lake for a few moments, until he gathered all the courage he could muster to ask what he had been dying to know. “You haven’t answered me, who is it?”
It always amazed him how he had Harry now; how they were each other’s, and how it seemed to be a thing that would last for a long time. If only they would decide to make it public.
“But, Grandpa…” Scorpius pipes up, furrowing his brow. The rest of them look at him, surprised, as it’s so strange for him to speak directly to Lucius. “You’re Mum’s father, not Dad’s. Why were Grandma and you so worried about his homework?”
Harry: The Ginsy thing went pretty well, if the two and a half hours I had to listen to Pansy talk about it are anything to go by. They’re going to meet again, this weekend, and they’ve already kissed. Isn’t that a bit too fast for you? We didn’t kiss on the first date. But I don’t think we’re better, because on our first date, we fought like 4-year-olds and the restaurant staff ordered us to leave.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Draco was screaming now, but he didn’t care. “That’s personal information! What gives you the right to tell anyone that, let alone Michael? You’re really as stupid as you look.”
“There it is!” Draco said, ignoring Harry's words and pointing to the little restaurant in front of them. “Get ready to eat the best fish and chips you’ve ever eaten.”
“Let’s dance!” Pansy exclaimed, getting up too, and taking Blaise’s hand. She looked at Draco with a smile and her eyebrows raised, but he shook his head. He didn’t want to dance.
“Can you shut up for once in your life and listen to me?” Harry almost shouted, which shut Draco up immediately. He moved in front of Draco, and looked him in the eyes. “I want to do this right. I want them to understand what we have—”
And that’s it. There’s no other possibility. He’s having fun with Yours, a few days away to relax and forget, but then he’s coming back home to me. I know.
“The bloke almost pushed me out of the door to enter. He wanted to see if Malfoy was here, and when I told him he wasn’t, he told me I wasn’t good enough for him.” Ron shook his head and sat on his chair again. “I had to remind him that he couldn’t go inside other people's houses without their permission, but he was out of his mind.”
Harry laughed and finished preparing the ingredients while Draco focused on the work at hand. He loved potions, and the thought of discovering the formula for the improved Wolfsbane excited him a lot. From the corner of his eye, he saw how Harry was looking curiously at the shelves full of jars, liquids, potion ingredients, and books. He moved in silence, as if trying to make the least noise possible to not bother Draco.
He hesitated in the doorframe of Draco’s studio. He hadn’t gone inside since Draco asked him to bring him one of his books to the hospital. That had been a lifetime ago, when Draco was ill, and Harry had hope. The book was in their bedroom now. Draco hadn’t finished it, and Harry had left it on his bedside table, as if he would come back some day and read it before bed.
“Malfoy,” Martin muttered. He had been even more insufferable since he learned about his and Radwah’s success. “Late again.”
Harry: She doesn’t approve of my plan of adopting a duck, by the way, but I’m not listening to a woman who thinks it's a good idea to get up at 7am on the weekend.
“Yes, you idiot.” Draco pecked him on the tip of his nose, which earned him a bigger smile. “I’m sorry for pushing you.”
“Of course. The only problem now is the pain she’s going to go through. We’re trying our best to relieve it, but werewolf transformations are very painful.” Harry turned and looked in the cabinet for something to ease Sarah’s pains. When he found it, he turned again. “Here. Drink this. It doesn’t taste like lavender, promise.”
“He lost his mother when he was four years old, and seven years later he lost his father, and got stuck with a stranger, what do you think?”
Harry: Draco! This was amazing! We ran in the park and then sat on a bench looking at the ducks! They were so cute!
“Yes. He’s pretty stupid to be a Healer, isn’t he? It was midday! The full moon isn’t even near!” She giggled.
They laugh. Draco has the article and the picture framed in her study, although she moves it to the living room whenever Ron is visiting. It’s one of the little pleasures of her life.
“I heard, but I see you have it back.” Harry read the notes on her bedside table. “They’re pretty sure it’ll stay this time.”
“Blaise is right, you know?” Pansy said with a spoonful of soup half its way to her mouth. “You’re being a dick to us. More than usual, I mean.”
“Can you eat those pork chops at the other side of the table?” Hermione asked as soon as she saw him. “The smell is making me sick. It’s too early for food.”
“Thanks,” Draco said. “I needed to buy some groceries, and I bought some potions books too that I think might help us today.”
Harry woke up sweating. The sheets only covered his waist, but something heavier and hotter was pressed to his back, and something else was wrapped around his chest. He looked down, trying to understand, but his brain was still foggy with sleep. A pale arm was hugging him. Draco. Draco was cuddling him. A soft snore on his back confirmed it. Well, at least he was still asleep. Maybe Harry could disentangle himself and Draco wouldn’t notice the erection he had.
Also, I noticed that I haven't added some tags before! I'm a mess at tagging, but I think I covered the main triggers. I'll add some more if I remember them (and if you think I should tag something else, please, let me know!).
“Where is he?” the man asked in a strong voice, taking a step forward and invading Harry's personal space.
“Yeah,” Draco said. “I think so too.” He took a sip of his pumpkin juice, and after a few minutes of silence he spoke again. “I’m meeting Harry this Saturday.”
“I… On Monday, the phone call I received wasn't from Ron. It was Padma. She and I…” He looks at me and hesitates.
“You don’t even know him!” Greg exclaimed. “The man wants to share his bed with you. Maybe he smells it when he arrives home.”
Harry noticed how two soft pink marks appeared on Draco’s cheeks. Apparently he wasn’t the only one nervous about it.
Harry: We missed you because we're an odd number now, but we decided that it was fair that the team that had Hermione had less people.
“Flitwick said ten inches,” Theo hissed in a voice loud enough for Pansy, Draco, and Blaise to hear, although it looked like Madam Pince heard him too because she glared at him.
It’s very late when Harry finally arrives. He looks awful, and nervous, although he tries to hide it.
They stayed in the living room together sharing stories about Draco, and for one glorious night, it was almost as if he was still with them.
“I’m sorry about yesterday,” Pansy said in a hushed voice. “Feles!” Her toad jumped a bit, and two whiskers appeared on its face.
He nodded, and got up. He had to finish his homework too, but that wasn't his priority. If Pansy asked, he would say he needed to find some information for some subject that  she didn’t take, like Ancient Runes.
Harry: I couldn't find Leo when I got home (yes, I went back to training with Ron). I was so worried! I found him curled in one of my slippers. Isn't he adorable?
“Your friends risked their lives to defeat You-Know-Who. They’ve been with you through a lot of things, and now they’re going to leave you because you’re dating me? Seriously, Harry! I think I know them better than you do.” Draco was glad to see Harry’s mouth turned a bit upwards.
“And don’t you forget that!” Harry said, still perched on Draco’s stomach. He smiled and bent down to peck Draco’s nose.
“You what!?” Pansy and Greg screamed at the same time, making Draco laugh, and he told them everything about that delightful encounter in the bathroom.
“Who’s carrying her? Who’s given up beauty for her? Who’s suffering dysphoria for her? Exactly, not you, so I can complain as much as I want until the little monster is born.”
Harry: That’s how you say I love you in Hindi. So you see, I love you in a lot of languages, and want you to forgive me for my slip.
And there are Harry’s suspicions… That night at the lake, he thought he saw Draco’s car there, too. At first, he thought he’d imagined it, but then, when he arrived home and saw the nervous wreck Draco was, that confirmed it. He had done his best to keep him out of this, but maybe it’s time to confess and gain an ally.
“No, it’s fine. Although you can eat the clams, I don’t like them.” He picked them with his fork and put them on Draco’s dish. It was beyond him how anyone could like such food.
“Sure. Our last match is in just two weeks. He’ll be insufferable,” Pansy said with a dramatic pout.
“Because he’s a jealous prick,” Ron answered. “Seriously, I have seen this before. Tell Malfoy to be careful and to call the Aurors if something happens.”
Harry: I'm trying to be cheerful. That's what I decided last night while I cried myself to sleep. That this month, I'm going to be happy! And meatballs make me happy.
“Me too,” Draco answered, looking at all the things they had and at the list, making sure they had bought everything they needed. “You pay, right?”
I give Michael some excuse, as it’s not usual for me to go to Harry’s shop, but he doesn’t pay me too much attention. Good. Then, I go to his office. I take the gloves out of my bag and put them on. I’m not leaving my fingerprints here, even if they’re my husband’s things. Besides, that way I can explore Padma’s things, too. I could clean them with magic afterwards, but I don’t want to miss anything by mistake.
“Ugh!” He tried to change positions, as he was becoming uncomfortable again. “I’m going to call her Pain. Fuck!”
Harry sighed. There was too much at stake in his relationship with Draco. There wasn’t just their past, but their living arrangement that would become uncomfortable if he said anything about his feelings. He remembered that Draco had said he was his crush, but a crush was just that. It wasn’t real liking — love. Was it? And maybe Draco had been talking about the past, about Hogwarts. Then there were the notes. After the bathroom encounter, they had exchanged some notes praising each other’s bodies, but they hadn’t meant anything, right? Harry had meant them, of course, although he had hoped that Draco thought he was just joking.
“I don’t want to go back to Hogwarts,” Scorpius said on the second day while Harry was making dinner.
Ps. Please invite Draco for me as well, Ron and Hermione told me the two of you have become friends recently and we would love to have him over as well and get to know him.
Draco hung his head low in his hands, setting his glass aside, and felt a sudden heat rising from his chest. He had tried to push back the emotions for so long about all the shit that he had gone through in such a short time, but he felt as if he was finally at a breaking point that couldn’t be reversed. The card was still in his hand and he looked it over once more.
“Draco!” They heard a voice yell down the hall. They both raised their heads at the voice and saw Pansy rushing into the room. She looked out of breath as though she had been running, yet her presence would say different. She still looked the epitome of calm and pristine. She walked over to him in a hurry and pulled him into a large hug. “What’s going on?”
“I wish you wouldn’t have though.” Draco spoke softly now. He couldn’t look at Harry now, but he knew the expression those emerald eyes would have. He knew that Harry would have pity in his eyes, and Draco didn’t want to see that. He didn’t want Harry to pity him.
“Oi mate, you never showed up at the Cauldron last night.” Ron had popped into Harry’s office within minutes of him arriving at work.
“Well, I’m happy to hear that.” Harry smiled, “Why don’t we take this conversation into the kitchen, Molly says dinner’s ready.”
The dreams never stopped no matter what he did. He had tried dreamless sleep potions, and all those did was distort the dreams in a way that made them worse than they were before. He had bought a pensieve and tried to move those memories out of his head, but all that did was turn those dreams into ghosts, turning the dreams into a haunting image of the original, making him cold and terrified to wake up. Nothing he had done worked until one day he was greeted by Andromeda Tonks at his front door.
Draco decided to ignore the jealousy he felt at not being one of Harry’s happiest moments, and focused on his words.
Draco closed his eyes for a second and let himself feel the warmth of the hug. It was nice having Harry comforting him. He missed his friends a lot, and he couldn’t help that part of him agreed with Gregory about who was to blame for Vincent’s death. He wriggled a bit so he could face Harry to talk to him, and Harry let go of the hug, although he was still very close to Draco.
“What are you going to eat?” he asked, looking over the menu. “I don’t know what half these things are. What the hell is
Harry: Sorry, Charlie threw a cushion at me because the light of the screen doesn’t let him sleep. Good night, Draco, and Merry Christmas!
“Oh.” He felt a bit sad, with the nice evening they were having ending so soon because of his discomfort. “Okay.”
“A little, thank you. I can’t wait for the little monster to get out already. She’s a pain in the arse just like Harry.”
I look in every drawer, in every folder, and in between the pages of every book, but I don’t find anything. I do the same with Padma’s desk, and here, I have a little more luck: I find a spare key to her flat.
Harry: I miss you so much, Draco. I don't know how to keep living if you're not here. What am I supposed to do without you?
He turns right, onto a strange street, and stops, double-parked. I do the same, wondering what he’s doing. For a moment I fear he’s seen me, until I remember that I don’t look like myself, and the car isn’t mine either. Then I see her. Parvati crosses the street and gets in the car with Harry. I tighten the grip on the wheel and drive after them.
They didn’t hear screams this time, only a soft whimper. The night seemed to last forever, until finally another soft whimper made them listen with attention. When they entered Sarah’s room, they found her sitting and smiling, although she looked tired.
And then there was Michael. Harry didn’t think it was right to ask Draco out just after that Sunday’s episode.
“You’re in a hurry, aren’t you?” Harry whispered, pushing him towards the bed so Draco was lying on it.
Draco’s heart beat wildly, and he cursed the universe for his rotten luck. Everybody else, even his best friends had called him rude, a prick, and worse things in the last days, but only Harry had realised that what was wrong with him was that he was sad.
Harry: At this point, I laughed at her, obviously, but I quickly begged for forgiveness and told her how beautiful and perfect she is. I'm going to hire Goyle as a bodyguard anyway. I don't trust her.
“The Ministry took it as war reparations. I don’t know what they did with it,” he said. “They took the manor too, although I don’t mind that too much. Too many unhappy memories there.”
The shop is as dark as I remember it from my youth, and hopefully it’ll be as discreet with its customers' demands. I wait, observing the shelves until the other clients leave, and when I’m alone with the shop assistant, I buy a bottle of polyjuice potion. I leave fifty galleons as a tip. I can’t have them babbling that I was here.
“Yes, don’t worry. It was some shitty thing at work. It took us hours. I’m sorry I couldn’t be back sooner.”
The restaurant staff guided them to their table in the little terrace at the back as soon as they stepped inside. The night was warm, perfect to have a long dinner while listening to the fountain in the middle of the terrace. Little pixie lights lit up the scattered tables.
“Mine?” he asked, panic rising from his belly, and making its place somewhere in his throat. He tried to swallow it, but it stayed there. “It’s… a boy.”
“You’ll need a potion master for it,” Ron said. “It can't be that expensive to contact one and ask them, right?”
“Are you alright?” Ron asked a second later from the bedroom entrance. “Malfoy? Michael’s in Auror custody now.”
“Greengrass with the quaffle.” The commentator’s voice reached Draco’s ears. He looked at the terraces and saw a girl he didn’t know sitting next to McGonagall. “She passes it to Malfoy, who passed it to Thomas, who passes it— Ouch! That must have hurt! A bludger thrown by Peakes hits the Eight Year student who drops the quaffle. Weasley with the quaffle.”
On the other hand —and now that his friends had pointed out all the failures his dreams had he allowed himself to think about it for the first time since the thought crossed his mind weeks ago—, it was Harry Potter. It had been very arrogant of him to think that he of all people would get a happy ending with his soulmate. Harry deserved someone better, someone that wasn’t a Death Eater, someone that hadn’t torture innocents, someone that hadn’t been very close to become a murderer. It was fair, he thought, that he got Harry as his soulmate, but Harry got someone else, probably someone wonderful, brave, and kind. It was poetic justice.
