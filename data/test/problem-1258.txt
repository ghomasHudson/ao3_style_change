“What are you on about?” He asked his godson.
Harry should have tried harder to hide his sour mood from Draco.
Sirius took a deep breath.
“No, Potter, she just calls me that for the fun of it,” Draco replied sarcastically. “Yes, we are cousins, you dolt. Why?”
“It’s lovely, Pads.”
Sirius sighed.
“Today we are doing something special. Today, I have planned one of the greatest surprises and you will ever receive in your life, Harry!”
“Sirius, I think you need to have this chat with Harry soon.”
Harry slowly nodded. He studied the girl standing beside them. She wore a frilly lilac dress, sky blue stockings and large doc martins. A necklace made from every variety of beads was strewn across her neck and as she stood there swaying, it jingled and clanked.
“What, would you rather I had let your dog roam the streets by itself?”
“Adoption?”
Harry looked back to Sirius, ceasing his own movement. The colour had drained from the man’s face, and his mouth was agape. Sirius eyes were locked ahead of them, so Harry whipped his head around to see what had caught his godfather’s attention.
“I got it real cheap,” Sirius gestured around the room. “I mean, I think I did. The agent said it was a good deal.”
Sirius quirked his lips.
Sirius didn’t have to think.
“Congratulations, mate,” Harry bumped his shoulder against Ron’s when he sat down. He leaned over the boy. “You too, ‘Mione. Knew you would get it.”
The smell of popcorn was the first thing Harry noticed as he entered the lobby. He took a deep breath, closing his eyes as he savoured the enticing scent. There was no line at the ticket counter, just a bored looking worker staring at nothing. He didn’t even look at Harry and Draco as they paused in the middle of the lobby. In the corner sat a small arcade. A boy a bit older than them was aggressively playing the pinball machine. It chimed and pinged each time the boy pressed the buttons.
Still, walking into the courtroom led by Mr. Malfoy, Sirius’s hand on his shoulder, Draco by his side, Harry couldn’t help but notice how cold his hand was now, and that worried him.
The man raised his eyebrow. His lip quirked and he glanced over Harry.
“This is not how I thought seeing you again would go.”
“There are plenty of other lawyers you could be bothering with this. I hardly see why you have come to me.”
“Oh my god, you’re as oblivious as your father was.”
At the word assaulted, Harry jerked.
They spent the rest of the morning floating awkwardly around the house. Harry tried to keep busy, but he couldn’t keep his mind on one set task. He went to walk Snuffles, but
Harry shook his head, a small smile finally growing on his face.
“Come on, Potter,” Draco said, grabbing a handful of presents from the table before making his way inside.
“Mother,” Draco Malfoy said. “When we get to Paris, will we be heading straight to our vacation house, or can we visit Grandmother first?”
Harry glanced towards the couch, shifting on his feet as he decided whether to sit on something that looked so expensive.
“Can I please borrow a pair of your skinny jeans?”
Harry held out his hand to Draco, waiting for the other boy to shake on it. The startled look Draco gave him shocked Harry, until he remembered their First Year, when Draco first offered his hand to Harry. He nearly expected the other boy to reject the handshake from pure spite.
“It would be a terrible shame for me to turn down an invitation to dinner with the Malfoys, don’t you think, dear Pads?”
“Will we go in now?” Luna asked in her dreamy voice.
“I promise,” Harry said standing straight. He held onto Snuffles lead. “I can even bring him back for visits if you like.”
“ENOUGH!” The Judge smacked his gavel repeatedly and began speaking over Vernon.
“Wouldn’t miss it.”
The security guards wrestled Vernon out of the room kicking and screaming. Harry was surprised they were able to carry the man considering his weight. From the corner of his eyes, Harry could see Draco was now also standing, sneering at his Uncle’s behaviour. Heat rose to Harry’s cheeks. Harry was used to this behaviour from Vernon Dursley, but he had always dreaded the day Draco Malfoy saw the way his Uncle acted, ever since First Year when the blonde boy was insulting Harry about his upbringing. The embarrassment welled in his chest, until he averted his eyes from Draco to look at the carpeted floor.
“Well, surely you know about Harry’s relatives. How long have you been teaching him?”
“Fucking typical.”
Sirius shot back an amused smile and Harry mumbled a response back to the other boy.
“Of course, I still love you, you prat,” he pressed their foreheads together over the café table.
“Huh,” Sirius laughed. “You actually won’t believe this. Lucius, the git, asked us to dinner Friday night.”
“The Custody Hearing…against his relatives.”
“Luna Lovegood. I’m in the year below you and Draco.”
“Thanks, Moony. I can’t believe we made it through. Honestly.”
“Do you think they won’t be your friends anymore or something?”
“I have to agree with Harry there, Luna. Don’t worry though, I’m a much better friend than Harry.”
It was Potter who noticed how low the sun had sunk in the sky. The light of the afternoon had taken on an orange haze that slipped through the cracks in the treetops.
I had an awful time trying to figure out how to use italics, so if the formatting is wrong I apologise.
“Oi!” Sirius exclaimed, with no true heat in his voice.
Harry felt heat explode across his cheeks. He placed the plastic apple back on its pile, avoiding meeting Draco’s eyes.
Harry looked over to Sirius, who nodded. Harry nodded as well.
“He’s been driving Narcissa up the wall since school ended. I was hoping you wouldn’t mind him coming here with me a few days this week. We think it would be good for him to be around people his own age. Also, it will give Narcissa a break.”
Once inside, he shut the door behind him and stepped onto the wooden floorboards. He removed his shoes, and gently placed the keys on a small wooden table. With soft footsteps, Harry made his way to the kitchen, where he could here soft muttering and the flipping of paper.
The man gave him a tired smile.
Harry cut Sirius of by throwing himself into the man’s chest, wrapping his arms tightly around his body.
“Well, you are crazy smart,” Harry smiled at her. “Thank you for that. I really needed to hear what you said.”
“You’ve come to know my son over these past weeks,” Malfoy’s voice had undeniably lowered. His eyes surveyed the room in a calculating way. No one was around them. “So, if you must know, Draco played a large part in my ... what did you call it … increased tolerance.”
He swirled around pressing his back against the mahogany door.
Harry stood at the desk, quietly waiting while the woman finished typing on her computer.
“Would you like to know more about them?” Sirius asked. “I’ll tell ya, I have some stories about your father that’ll leave you pissing yourself. Oh, sorry, language.”
If Harry were being honest with himself, he knew this mood had been developing for weeks now. Because, despite all the amazing things he now had in his life, his unconscious mind refused to get with the memo. Each night over the past few weeks, Harry had woken screaming.
“I would love to,” Luna beamed.
“That’s not what I meant, Sirius,” his expression was stern, like he was talking to one of his students. “You have Harry now. That means everything comes down to him, and what he is comfortable with. He is the priority right now. Not us or our feelings.”
“They sound like wankers,” is the response Draco went with.
“Right, well. I suppose we better get going Harry,” Sirius’s eyes hadn’t left Professor Lupin, and neither looked ready to say goodbye. “This dog isn’t going to pick itself.”
Slam! A door slammed shut behind Harry. The sound of heavy, pounding footsteps came closer and closer, closing in on Harry. A deep chill filled the hallway, raising the hair on his arms. Without hesitating, Harry threw open the door to Draco’s room slamming it behind him and holding it shut.
“Sir,” a young woman burst into the room, her hair in disarray and her breath shallow. “Sir, you can’t be here. I am so sorry Mr. Malfoy, I tried to stop…”
“Hey Sirius” Harry called.
“Is everything alright? I know you usually don’t like summer, but today feels different. Your more upset than usual.”
“Hey Moony,” Harry said.
(See the end of the chapter for
He whipped his head to Hermione, humming in response.
“Finally,” Ron groaned. “I’ve been starving since history. Let’s go to the canteen, Harry. I managed to sneak some change from Fred and George this morning.”
“You know about Harry?”
“It was all about choice, and they chose not to use it. It was really quite beautiful.”
“I told Remus I would have dinner with him,” Sirius found himself replying. Not that he owed the other man an explanation. Truly, it had just slipped out.
Harry was sweeping the wooden living room floors in jagged, frantic movements when Sirius came flouncing into the room.
Petunia scoffed and shrugged.
“I mean, come on Potter. Weasley and Granger are your friends. As much as it disgusts me, you three are really close. They aren’t about to dump your ass after all the shit they endured with you, just because you got a new family."
It was a few minutes later he heard his bedroom door creak open. He stayed facing the white wall. He heard the patter of Snuffles footsteps and his bed shook as the large dog leapt up to be beside him. He stuck his cold nose into Harry’s neck drawing a small smile from the boy.
Snuffles settled in well with Harry and Sirius the following week.
“I don’t know Potter. I was about to ask you that.”
“You answer mine first. Aren’t you meant to be in a meeting?”
“No,” Remus said firmly, his head shaking in jagged sharp motions. “No! Don’t tell me Harry wasn’t treated like that. Don’t tell me he was living in an abusive household, and I didn’t do anything to…”
When the day was finally ending, the sun starting to sink in the sky through the window and stories between the two thoroughly told, Sirius brought up the topic of Harry’s homelife.
Sirius walked into the kitchen and set about filling the kettle with water. When it was full, he placed it on its base and flipped the switch. The water started gurgling. Remus joined Harry at the table, sending the young boy a grin. Harry gave a small smile in return. Together they watched Sirius search the kitchen cupboards.
Harry huffed, managing to finally extract Snuffles from the intoxicating scent of the bush. He refrained from answering Malfoys question. He still felt guilty about not telling his Ron and Hermione about his custody hearing. He tried to console himself by thinking they were off enjoying themselves without having to worry about Harry and his troubles.
“Just go already!”
“And I am pleased to announce, this year’s Gryffindor Prefects are Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weasley.”
“Know what, you prat?”
“Yes?” Draco responded to his father automatically.
“No!” Harry exclaimed, his head shooting up to look at Sirius. “I don’t… I don’t think so.”
Luna smiled brighter after he said her name. She nodded.
“Honestly,” Lucius sighed. He reached into his pants pocket and pulled out a black leather wallet. “There was an ice cream shop a few blocks over. Don’t come back for a few hours.”
The television blasted a tune that drew Harry’s attention. On the screen, an animated show was playing, its opening credit filled with robots and explosions.
At this, the boys act dropped, and Harry was graced with one of the few genuine expressions he had seen from Draco. Furrowed eyebrows, concerned eyes, and a tight smile.
Draco sat directly behind Harry. He was being painfully quiet, and the only reason Harry knew he was there was because he had watched the other boy sit down. Draco was the only one in the room apart from those appearing before The Judge and the security guards standing beside the doors.
“I just got that!”
He walked over to the makeshift living room with Sirius. Melissa split apart from them, heading to a chair in the corner of the room.
Potter let out a bark of laughter and Draco felt his face heat up.
Harry scrambled to retrieve the remaining presents, ignoring the laughter of the adults as he followed Draco inside.
Remus had agreed to meet for lunch with Sirius. By themselves. To talk.
When their laughter died down and they had caught their breath, neither spoke. They just smiled at the other, content with this time together.
Remus sat back in chair. He took a deep breath, closing his eyes as though physically hurt by the words Sirius just spoke. When he opened them, Sirius noticed how glassy his eyes were, and his chest ached to see the man he loved so close to tears.
“I thought maybe I would punch you, tell you off for being an idiot,” Remus mumbled. Sirius eyes dropped to the ground in disappointment. “Then I thought about kissing you, telling you how much I fucking missed you. God, I missed you, Pads.”
Sirius ran a hand over his face, feeling the scratch of his stubble has he dug his nails across his chin. Remus hadn’t looked away from him. Sirius was actively avoiding eye contact. He watched a stray newspaper blow across the road, the pages separating as they flew in a multitude of directions.
“And you have proof?”
“We have a few classes together, I think,” Ginny frowned at him.
He rewrapped his sandwich in its clingwrap, shoving it back into his bag.
For the life of him, Harry had no idea what that meant. Still, he pondered over her question. For some reason, talking to Luna seemed easier than with other people. He never felt judged by her in the few conversations they had, and she seemed to have no interest in gossiping. Nodding to himself, he decided to confide in the weird, friendly girl.
“Shut up, Potter!” Draco snapped.
“This is new,” He said, pointing to the pin board stuck to the wall covered in photos. The photo Draco pointed to was of him and Harry standing in the backyard in soaking wet clothes, covered in soap after trying to give Snuffles a bath. They were smiling at the camera, Draco trying to act annoyed, his arms crossed, and eyes rolled, but a sure smirk painted his face.
“And Harry, how lovely to see you again,” she moved over to Harry, cupping her hands over his cheeks, raising his head up to look into his eyes.
“Put down that broom, my dearest godson!” Harry stilled immediately, propping the broom up against the wall.
“Come on, Potter, give me some credit. My insults are way more original than that.”
The cover of the staircase didn’t last long, and soon he was facing a long, daunting hallway, with a roof abnormally high and white carpet that looked like it would stain by one simply looking at it wrong. The portraits and pictures lining the walls were kinder at least, and Harry recognised a few photos of a young Draco. Most were school pictures Harry had already seen, however, there was one photo of a baby Draco wearing nothing but underwear standing underneath a sprinkler on the manner grounds, laughing at the camera with unbridled joy. The picture was the only unguarded smile Harry had ever seen on Draco, and he couldn’t explain why the sight made him smile.
“No?”
Sirius looked up from the papers he studied, his expression turning from troubled to joyful as he saw Harry. A smile adorned his lips as he looked at his godson.
“Um, yeah. And your… Luna?” Harry scratched his head.
When things had first come out with meeting Sirius, Harry had refrained from telling his friends. There was a barrier in his mind that cut of his words whenever he thought of telling them. Ron and Hermione had faced everything with him. They were the closest people to him and the only people that knew how the Dursleys affected him. He knew he should have told them he was safe with Sirius, had been for the past months, but something stopped him every time. Something inside him thought telling them everything would cause it all to disappear, a jinx, that would break the spell and send him packing back to the Dursleys.
“Very well. As I was saying, we have matters to discuss, that being, an application for legal custody of Mr. Potter.”
“I wish you would call him Remus, or even Moony. I watched that twat pull pranks on Professors when we were kids and there’s no way he should’ve been granted the title.”
When he finally caught sight of Potter, he saw the boy’s frame slumped against the trunk of a thick oak tree in a small clearing. Snuffles was standing over him, blocking most of Draco’s view. He stepped forward to get closer to the two, and as he did, Draco stepped on a large branch. The branch emitted a large snap, and tripped him, sending him flying into the open space. He didn’t notice Potter or Snuffles look at him as he stumbled over his own feet.
The voice sounded distant. Like he was swimming, floating on the surface and the noise was filtering through the water to his ears. He didn’t respond. He sat with his head in his hands, his glasses pushed onto his head as he pressed the palms of his hands harshly into his eye socket. He felt like screaming.
It was in the silence that Harry thought about his life with Sirius. Harry remembered when he had first stepped into the home and how content he had felt, how safe. He thought of Snuffles and the nights Harry had snuck him up to bed with him, and how Sirius definitely knew what was happening but let him do it anyway. He thought of the spontaneous dances Sirius would pull him into, or the stories he told about Harry’s parents. He thought of leaving all this behind for the cold, locked room that held promises of punishments and pain.
Each day when Lucius came to discuss business with Sirius, Malfoy came to. The two boys, while under no circumstance claiming to be friends, acted exactly as friends would. They hung out, talked about football and their favourite teams, walked Snuffles, and became regulars at Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour. Malfoy’s favourite flavour was pasticcio, while Harry always stuck with simple hazelnut. Malfoy claimed the other boy was boring, but he always obliged and bought Harry whatever flavour he asked for.
“So, Harry,” Sirius voice was teasing. “How was your day with Draco?”
“Well, yeah I know,” Harry said defensively. “It’s just, she’s always like touching you and stuff.”
“Oh Harry,” Remus smiled softly. “That’s our job. If your parents were still alive, we would have been right there next to Lily and James, dealing with every nightmare. Don’t you dare feel guilty for things you can’t help.”
“Why don’t you two get out of the house and take Snuffles for a walk?” Sirius suggested.
“I see. What was it you were talking about just now? It seemed rather serious,” Remus paused. “Don’t tell your godfather I just said that. I never want to hear the Sirius/serious joke ever again.”
Soon the footpath ceased to exist, and all that marked the path for Draco was the patchy grass and dirt under his shoes. He walked until the trees became larger and dead leaves soon covered the earth’s floor. His head jerked each time he heard a new noise, his eyes searching for the threats around him. The large black dog was still attached to Draco by the rope, and he held it tightly, like it could be used as a shield should the need arise.
Harry paused, running through what he just said. Sirius let out a sharp bark of laughter.
“The kennel,” Sirius said automatically at the same time as Harry responded,
“Its standard. You don’t have anything to be worried about. He just needs you to answer some questions,” Sirius voice was strained.
Draco shook his head, his eyes squinted and angry, his lips pursed. It was a look Harry knew well. The ‘Potter you fucking idiot, how can anyone be so stupid’ look. It was an expression he had been receiving from Draco since First year, and now that Harry thought about what he had said, he realised he deserved it this time. Of course, Malfoys house didn’t have ghost. He was being stupid. Any minute now Draco would open his mouth and tell him so.
Italics hates me, so sorry about that formatting crap.
“We grew up together,” Sirius started. “He went to school with your parents and me, and well, we were close. Did he never mention knowing your parents?”
Potter picked up the lead still attached to Snuffles and together the boys walked back into town. When they reached the beginning of the footpath, Potter asked another question.
“Looks like someone is waiting for you.”
Sirius was gearing himself up, ready to tell Malfoy he could shove it, when the man said something truly shocking.
“I know you and your Godfather will work this out.”
Harry blinked.
“It wouldn’t have anything to do with your nightmares, would it?”
“You wouldn’t be replacing James, Pads. Just keeping Harry a bit safer. But, if you don’t want to do it, there are other ways we can try.”
“Regardless, it is a possibility,” Lucius rubbed at his temple with long, slender fingers. “Honestly, I don’t understand why we couldn’t have just offered a settlement for the child? It is not as though you don’t have the money, considering the fee you are paying for my services.”
Smiling to himself, Harry walked over to the welcoming sight of Luna Lovegood, glad to have found someone to eat with. When he approached her, Harry noticed she was reading a magazine upside down, her sandwich sitting untouched beside her.
Sirius didn’t say anything when Harry entered. He sat across from his godfather at the table, the scrapping of his wooden chair along the floor the only noise filling the room. They sat there until the sun came up, and the clocks chimed for the fifth time.
Harry smirked, watching the growing blush build on the pale boys’ cheeks.
The shock of the situation kept Malfoy from acting immediately as he watched Potter disappear from his view. Instead, he played the interaction through his head, uncomprehending to what had caused Potter to react so bizarrely. It was a large booming bark that broke him out of thought. He noticed Potter’s beast barking at him, its eyes focused on Draco as though rousing on him.
Inside was a small leather-bound book. It looked old and Harry ran his fingers along the front.
September 1st meant a lot of things. It was the end of summer where the heat filled days slowly began to fade. It was the beginning of fall, when leaves would begin to brown as children counted down the days to Halloween. And, each year without fail, it was the first day of classes at Hogwarts. Now to Harry, who usually looked forward to this day all summer long, September 1st was a day to be celebrated. Since his First Year, on the 1st of September he would rush through his morning routine, before running from Number 4 Private Drive to the bus stop he knew would take him home to Hogwarts.
“Are you upset Weasley is Prefect? Because I can come up with a way to have him removed.”
Sitting at the worn wooden kitchen table sat Sirius Black, his godfather. His hair was pulled back in a messy bun that had strands falling out at various angles. He wore black jeans and a black shirt, his feet bare against the linoleum kitchen floor. His skin was pale. He was biting his lip as he held up a sheet of paper. The table was covered in documents and folders and books, all open at various pages.
Harry and Draco sat shoulder to shoulder on a bench in the corridor. Neither talked. Harry stared vacantly at a spot on the wall, while Draco surveyed the people walking past them with sharp eyes and an upturned nose. Harry could feel himself nodding off as they waited. The events of the day had left him truly exhausted.
Malfoy threw the remote away from him and the TV settled on something called The Love Hospital. The actors were dressed as doctors and nurses and their acting was dramatically
Harry quickly agreed and hung up. He could hear Sirius and Professor Lupin chatting in the kitchen, their words low.
Sirius turned to face Harry his movements becoming more exaggerated as he looked to his godson. Sirius brought the dishes scrubbing brush up to his lips to use as a pretend microphone.
“I apologise. I’m rambling.”
“What?”
Harry remained still. From the doorway to his bedroom, Sirius sighed, before slowly pacing away down the hall. It was only once he heard his Godfather banging around in the Kitchen that Harry decided to move from the safety of his blankets.
They rode to the city in mostly silence. Sirius tried to start up a game of spotto, but only one yellow car passed them on the short trip. The bus smelt stale and the engine sounded dodgy but the two never complained.
His panic was noticed by Draco, who elbowed Harry in the side, causing him to wince in pain.
“That sounds really good.”
Ron let out a humph of air next to him.
“Oh, hey Ginny.”
Sirius felt like laughing. Like running through the streets screaming at the top of his lungs. Like serenading his Moony right then and there. He did none of those things.
“Are you and Luna really cousins?”
“Another thing, Black,” Lucius paused in the doorway, gesturing for Sirius to exit the room. “Narcissa has decided she would like to have you over for dinner, so she can properly meet Mr. Potter. We were thinking Friday night, if that suits you both.”
“What about Harry then? Why is he with you?”
“Yeah, course. Now get going!”
They joined the crowd of students flocking through the opening corridor. Harry noticed Dean and Seamus walking ahead of them but made no move to greet them. Hermione and Ron walked beside him, talking through Harry to argue with one another. He kept an eye out for distinct blonde hair, tyring hard not to make it obvious who he was looking for.
He trailed off towards the end, eyes scanning the hallway like said man would appear at the mere mention of the insult. They were nearing the Science room and could hear the chatter of their classmates echoing through the hall.
“See you tomorrow, right?”
“Alright, Sirius?”
Malfoy had the remote and he never paused longer than a minute before clicking onto the next channel. It was nearing the half-hour mark when it got the better of Harry’s patience.
Draco opened his mouth to launch into a tirade of insults. Before he could start though, the dungeon doors slammed open.
“Has anyone ever told you that your crazy smart, Luna?”
Sirius rubbed the back of his neck.
“Hey, guys,” Harry bumped against Ron’s shoulder. “How was the meeting?”
“It simply must be wonderful for you to a free man, Sirius, and to have Harry all to yourself finally” Mrs. Malfoy led them through a massive, spacious room, fit with a crystal chandelier. If he had to bet, Harry would guess this to be a ballroom. “Heaven knows I never thought I’d see the day you were let out.”
Harry unclipped Snuffles collar, and the dog took off towards his water bowl.
“Well, I mean, your dad cares so much about you, he tried to have me off the team just for punching you. But, like, if my relatives ever saw you do that to me, they surely would have baked you a cake or some shit… or made me bake it.”
“Sounds like something you would do,” despite the teasing nature of his voice, the words were soft.
It didn’t take long for Harry and Sirius to make the decision. Snuffles was the dog for them. The adoption process was quick. Fleur was close to tears, kneeling and hugging Snuffles a number of times before the papers were signed. When they were finally ready to leave, Fleur having set them up with everything they could possibly need into two paper bags, Fleur made them promise to take care of her big boy.
“Not really.”
“Hello, you two,” Professor Lupin greeted them with a cheery voice. There were deep bags under his eyes and the scars on his face looked irritated. “What are you up to? Out for a walk with your new dog?”
“Very well. Now before we continue, I need you to tell me everything your relatives did to you. We will not use all of it, but to represent you to the best of my abilities I need to cover all bases. I can’t do that unless I know all the facts.”
The two fell silent, and Harry felt the need to apologies for never mentioning Professor Lupin to Sirius. It wasn’t that he didn’t like him as a teacher, in fact he had become one of Harry’s favorites. It was just the topic never arose. Harry opened his mouth to say something when Professor Lupin started talking.
Harry and Remus bid the boy goodbye. Draco gave Harry a final small smile, before his expression dropped into the indifference mask he usually wore when at school and he exited to castle in the direction of the pickup zone.
“We didn’t do much. Mostly watched movies.”
Thanks for all the comments and Kudos! <3
“Uh,” Harry cleared his throat. “Yeah, we, I mean he, didn’t think our friends would approve. So, we are just keeping things normal at school.”
When the bus arrived, Sirius payed for both his and Harry’s ticket, and ushered Harry to the back seats.
“And I forgive you! Harry, please, nothing you do could make me hate you!” Sirius ran his hands down to squeeze Harry’s shoulders. “Besides, you weren’t the only one that said things they regret last night. So, I’m sorry as well. I shouldn’t have brought the topic of therapy up like that. I didn’t know you would take the suggestion so bad.”
The two began to bicker, falling into a comfortable pattern they had established throughout the summer break. Time passed quickly, and soon they were called for supper, late by a whole five minutes, much to the dismay of Mrs. Malfoy, who reprimanded her son for such rude behaviour. He merely smirked at Harry before offering his mother an insincere apology.
When the door open Harry saw a man sitting inside on a small armchair. Upon hearing the door open, the man jumped to his feet and smoothed his wavy black hair down with his hand. He was dressed in a button up white shirt and a pair of black skinny jeans. He swayed on the spot as he looked at Harry and Melissa, and Harry was unable to read his expression.
As they chatted, Harry found it hard not to noticed how close Sirius and Remus now seemed. His godfather no longer looked like he wanted to bolt every time the other man spoke. Now, he laughed and joked with Remus, and he used any excuse he could to touch the sandy haired man. A pat on the shoulder. Sneaking food from his plate. He even once tried to go for a high five. Harry had facepalmed as his godfather held up his hand, but Remus begrudgingly high fived Sirius.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s the Potter family crest.”
Harry watched Draco pace the room, shaking his head at Harry’s words. He knew they were heading into a dangerous topic. The air in the room was no longer light and playful. Rather, the tension that usually surrounded the two boys during a fight was building. He regretted ever asking about Malfoys friends.
Sirius opened his eyes, ready to start screaming at the man in front of him, before he saw Malfoys reaction. His jawline set and his eyes narrowed, Malfoy looked the angriest Sirius had ever seen the man. Even his cheeks were tinted pink again his pale white skin, something that Sirius had only seen once on a prank gone wrong against Malfoy back in High School.
Harry tried to ignore him, but when he looked up Malfoy and his friends were all looked at him in various states of amusement.
“Our relationship?”
There was shuffling on the other end of the phone.
“We are talking later!” Draco pointed to him, before rushing out the door of the abandoned classroom.
Harry sighed.
“No.”
“Can you promise me?” Harry breathed the question, unable to make his voice go any louder. At Sirius and Malfoys looks he continued. “Can you promise me if I make a statement I won’t have to go back there.”
Harry scowled, and moved the rest of the way to the other couch. He slumped into the seat. His face was red, and his thoughts swam to how ridiculous Mr. Malfoy thought he must have looked. Harry tried to avoid the man’s gaze, instead watching Sirius pour tea into a mismatched tea set. When he was finished and had handed out beverages to everyone in the room, Sirius sat next to him. Mr. Malfoy held his cup in his hands, before putting it down on the table without taking a sip.
Draco looked up and down at Sirius, an unamused expression adorning his face. Harry felt his chest start to burn with anger. He clenched his jaw and ground his teeth together. He was so caught up in his anger at his high school arch nemesis, he didn’t hear the groups conversation until his name was being spoken.
“What?” Ron frowned. “It’s lunch.”
Remus simply shook his head. His eyes were wide.
There was a litter of small sandy coloured dogs in one kennel, the mother dog overlooking her four pups with disinterest as the young ones yapped and fought each other. Next to the litter of pups was a small white ball of fluff that Harry couldn’t be sure was a dog. A few cages up there was a droopy eyes elderly dog that had large droplets of drool accumulating in its mouth. The cacophony of barking was becoming overwhelming and Harry struggled to think.
Harry watched the sun sink low in the sky, a haze of orange and pink stretching across the city. He had caught the bus into town where the nearest cinema was. The entire trip he hadn’t been able to keep his legs from twitching, his nerves keeping him unfocused. He had nearly missed his stop, to busy staring out the window as he thought about meeting Draco. Thankfully, he realised just before the bus door slid shut, and ran up isle, ignoring the glare he received from the driver.
Harry sat up in bed. The covers fell to his waste, and his bed-shirt hung of his shoulders. The morning air formed goosebumps along his arms. He pulled his legs to the edge of the bed, his bare feet hitting the wooden floor. He could feel the accumulation of dirt beneath his feet and made a mental note to vacuum his floor later in the day.
They fell into silence, each awkwardly sipping their drinks dry. Once again, it was Remus that broke the silence between them, speaking more into his cup than to Sirius.
“Oh,” Ginny’s mouth hung open. “Um, well, do you mind if I join you two then?”
Sirius knelt beside him. His godfather’s face was pale, eyes glassy, and his hair was pulled back into a frizzy bun.
“We can’t do this like we did last time,” Remus said.
“So, Granger and Weasley don’t know about all this?”
“A movie?” Harry asked suddenly. “I haven’t been to the cinemas in years.”
“Ok, Pads.”
Harry groaned.
The other man was stunned for a moment, before laughter bubbled out of his mouth. The longer he laughed the more it sounded like tears. Remus ran his hand over his face, scratching along the stubble building beneath his chin.
“I missed you too, Moony. So fucking much.”
After a few minutes, a lady with kind brown eyes and black hair walked down the corridor with a clip board. Glancing around the waiting room, her eyes stuck on Harry, the only person there. She smiled and walked over to him. She wore a name tag that said Melissa.
“Shall we start?” Mr. Malfoy said with a drawl. He sounded bored. Like he would rather be doing anything but this.
She looked about to say more, but Harry quickly cut her off.
“Will he?” Harry whispered. He looked at his socked feet, one of his toes sticking out through a hole.
“I mean, if you don’t like it, you don’t have to have it,” Draco spoke quickly. “I can get you something else-”
Neville nodded solemnly.
They were gathered in the hallway outside the court room. People paced past them with hurried steps, dressed in suits and fashionable dresses. Harry stood beside Draco, facing his godfather, who was trying his best to make eye contact with the security guard standing down the hallway.
“We better get to bed, Harry. Tomorrow is going to be a long day.”
Harry hesitated before nodding. Sirius didn’t waste any time, wrapping his arms around Harry’s small frame. Harry stood awkwardly, unsure of what to do with his arms. His head was tucked under Sirius chin, and he could smell the man’s cologne.
“It’s not about that!” He snapped.
Draco shrugged.
Harry thought over what Sirius said. His heart ached for the man in front of him who had to endure so much heartbreak in his life.
“No need to get snippy,” Malfoy had the audacity to look like Harry was the crazy one.
Potter was smirking at him and Draco couldn’t keep the amusement from showing on his own face, even as he tried to remain stoic.
Harry shook his head.
Draco quirked his head.
Harry swallowed, trying to drown the lump building in his throat. Luna swayed her head side to side, seemingly contemplating Harry’s words.
“I thought you were calling me crazy,” Harry mumbled.
“Harry,” Sirius smiled at his godson, a sad look in his eyes. “Don’t worry about that. Take your time. Besides, if you end up on the phone with Cissy your going to be a while. Trust me.”
Sirius sent a surprised look to Lucius. The other man looked just as shocked and sent a single nod back to Sirius.
Harry began shaking his head. His hands slipped, and the messy tie came undone. With a frustrated groan, Harry threw his head back in defeat.
Mr. Malfoy stood again.
“I know why he is representing you,” Malfoy finally shot back. “Your godfather is handing over the family mansion as payment. It becomes ours even if you lose. In fact, I doubt my father is even trying to win your case. Why would he bother?”
Just as he’d given up hope and was planning on re-entering the abandoned classroom he’d just exited; Harry spotted a sight of familiar silver hair. Squinting to get a better look, at first, Harry was sure he had spotted Draco. However, upon closer inspection, Harry noticed the blonde locks were much to long be Draco’s, and the person they belonged to, wore a rumpled skirt and bright blue knee-high socks.
“Right, yes, well… there wasn’t anything else to do and all my friends are out of the country, so I thought I would try something new. It seemed like it would be easy!”
“Sure. Top drawer of my dresser.”
Harry felt a twinge of guilt building in his chest. He glanced over to Draco, who’s blonde hair was distinct, making him easy to spot. Almost immediately, Draco’s eyes met his, and the boy gave a subtle shake of his head, indicating that he could hear their conversation, and knew from Harry’s expression he was about to defend the boy.
Luna didn’t say more. She simply swayed some more, causing her frilly dress to twirl.
He shook his head slightly.
Aunt Petunia tsked.
“Of course, of course,” She knelt with Harry to unlock the cage. “Like I zay, he is a lovely boy.
The floor felt like it had dropped beneath Harry. His cheeks flared with heat and his chest tightened.
“Don’t act so high and mighty. How many times have you dragged Weasley into one of our fights?”
Harry scratched his neck and wondered who he was speaking to.
“Is Mr. Black present today?” Sirius put his hand up. “And Mrs. And Mr. Dursley?”
“I think so. Do you mind coming?”
The boy hummed.
“This isn’t a case you can win, especially if the family Mr. Potter has been living with for the past 13 years refuse to sign over guardianship. I am sure they would do a much better job at parenting the boy than you, anyway. Its best you give up.”
“Sure. Let’s go,” Draco handed her back the box of popcorn.
“Forbidden Forest.”
“What’s wrong with you seeing a therapist?”
Harry looked up from his shoes to her face, seeing concern and sadness.
“Well I fucking do, so deal with it, you self-hating prat. I’m meant to be the drama queen in this relationship, not you, so sack up.”
“What’s wrong Sirius?”
Remus walked closer to him. They stood facing each other under the archway connecting the kitchen and living room.
“Very well,” Mr. Malfoy started. “I am unsure how much your godfather has told you Mr. Potter, but I have reviewed your case and come up with a way that will grant Mr. Black with full custody.”
“I know… I’m sorry. I didn’t want you seeing me like that.”
“Oh, wonderful,” Remus said, his voice soft. “Shall we go now then?”
The thought remained with him though, and for the first time in his life, Harry wished he could go shopping for new clothes.
It was on the Saturday morning when Sirius had enough.
“Yeah, Moony took it with his disposable, remember? We just got it developed.”
Minutes seemed to pass. Sirius watched as Harry gradually began to relax. Finally, Harry smiled, a small, timid smile. He uncurled his tight body, spreading his legs out. He chewed his lips as he thought over his next words.
“Are you nearly ready?”
They sat together like that for a few moments, listening to the sounds of nature around them. Draco could appreciate the serenity that came with the place. The fresh air blew past them with a hint of chill, pushing leaves from the forest floor and sending them flying. The bark of the large tree brushed against his back, but it didn’t hurt. It was simply a reminder of the tree’s sturdiness.
It didn’t come off as a question, more like a summoning. Sirius opened and closed his mouth before responding. Lucius was already walking away, down the hallway to where the kids were waiting.
“Remus.”
"I'm going to meet with him tomorrow. See if he will take on our case."
After a pause, Harry nodded. With a final squeeze to his shoulders, Sirius guided Harry into the living room to sit on the couch. The cushions were worn, making them more comfortable and softer than a brand-new couch.
“They wouldn’t-” A sharp look from Draco cut Harry off. “Ok, they might.”
When he walked into the kitchen, Harry thought Malfoy looked as pleased to be there as Harry was having him here. His eyes roamed the house in disgust and his lip was curled as he surveyed each room. He looked like a miniature lawyer, dressed in Khakis and a button shirt. Mr. Malfoy looked much the same as he usually did, dressed in a three-piece suit and carrying his cane and briefcase.
Draco snorted, flashing Harry the same ‘you’re an idiot’ look.
Begged was an exaggeration. Narcissa had screamed at him he was unworthy of the family title and assets. He could still remember her saying she wished in were him who had died, rather than Regulus. Sirius had never said as much, but he agreed with everything she said. Still, the slight exaggeration was enough to interest Malfoy, who sat down in his leather chair, eyes assessing Sirius.
“Hey,” Harry jumped when he felt Sirius rest his hand on his shoulder. “I’ve got you Harry.”
“Mate, I flooded the second-floor bathroom in our Second Year after setting off firecrackers as a distraction. Why would you think that?”
Ron’s mouth fell open, and he shot Harry a scandalised look. Harry hunched his shoulders, throwing his hands up in a mock surrender.
“I’m sorry.”
Harry laughed at that, a mix of relief and satisfaction.
“Hey!”
Sirius leaned back, and exhaustion fell over him.
“Yeah, I’m pretty sure Ron and Hermione are going to say the same thing. The thing is, I don’t want to go back to us hating each other. I just,” Harry took a deep breath. “I don’t want to tell them just yet. I doubt they are going to understand, especially since the last time they saw you, Ron got detention.”
“I’m just asking! It really isn’t that difficult a question, Potter.”
Draco didn’t know why he felt disappointed by those words. The thought of leaving the clearing and heading back to the real world didn’t seem so appealing when he thought about Potter and him going back to their old ways when they left. But, Draco knew they couldn’t stay here forever.
“You don’t have a plan, do you?” Draco must have heard him umming over the phone.
“Because, you’re my priority now Harry. I’m your guardian.”
Potter gave him an unamused look.
“Do I need to know anything about today, Mr. Malfoy?” Harry asked.
“I know, buddy.”
Harry spent most the day there with Sirius, Melissa patiently watching over the two. He learnt about his parents, and why he had never been able to meet Sirius until now. He learnt how Sirius had been falsely accused of murder and had spent the past twelve years in prison. Sirius told him about how when he had been released four months beforehand, he had wasted no time. He spent the time between then and now undergoing psych evaluations and different procedures all in hopes of finally getting to see Harry again.
“You’re inviting Remus and I for dinner?”
The man took a deep breath. He frowned, glancing over at Harry.
Then, Harry remembered he was facing a guardianship trial which would soon decide his future, and he felt stupid for worrying about something as dumb as holding hands with Malfoy. There were much more pressing matters demanding his anxiety and stress.
“What! Preposterous,” Vernon spluttered. His face was turning the alarming shade of purple. “The boy is lying!”
“Its fine,” Harry said too quickly.
“Look, don’t worry about it, Pans.”
“Hey,” Draco said quietly.
“You’re an idiot.”
“I’m not a fucking criminal, alright!”
“I had a fight with my godfather last night,” Harry decided to tell her in a hushed voice. “It got pretty bad.”
Though they rarely properly fought throughout those days, there was always the escalation of tension that could become more if they continued. Despite Malfoy being a large distraction for Harry, the upcoming trial was becoming a deep source of stress for the other boy. It was two days before the court date that his stress and Malfoy’s stubbornness met head on.
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Ron whispered.
“Why is that?”
Sirius barked his trademark laugh, throwing his head back.
I got your letters. Hermione’s as well. Sounds like you are both having a wonderful time, which I am glad to hear.
“Bye, Mrs. Malfoy. Nice chatting with you.”
Harry felt numb. They day was moving fast, and he was struggling to keep up with everything that had happened. He couldn’t remember much of anything after the judge spoke, just that Sirius had hugged him tighter than he had ever been held before.
Sirius nodded along to the words. He handed files over to Malfoy. Harry began washing the plates they had used for lunch. When Malfoy had collected all he needed, he stood up straight and looked to them both. Harry was expecting to hear the usual goodbye. However, Malfoy said something unexpected.
“Harry,” Draco reached out, wrapping his hand around Harry’s forearm.
“Yeah, she is. Most people just can’t deal with the weirdness though,” Draco started walking up the street. “Where should we eat?”
Remus expression stayed blank, a false blanket of calm. Sirius knew Remus though. He saw the twitch in the other man’s hand, the tapping of his foot, the glint in his eyes. Remus was anxious. Yet, he was more patient than Sirius. He always had been. So, they sat in silence, Remus staring him down with a raised eyebrow and thinly pressed lips until Sirius couldn’t stand it any longer.
“I know right! Nearly couldn’t believe it myself.”
“Um, excuse you, Weasley got himself detention.”
“No, this year I am off to Australia. Something unexpected, but Mother’s new husband owns a beach house on the coast. I intent to spend most my summer by the shore, see who can catch my eye.”
As they walked down the corridor lined with a number of doors, Harry wondered about what she had said. Someone wanted to meet him. His godfather wanted to meet him. He felt like fireworks had been set off in his chest. There was a wave of nerves flush over Harry, his palms still sweating, and his heart racing. He still felt cynical about the whole thing, but the idea that this was all some practical joke was slowly fading from his mind. It was all to elaborate.
“Did you catch the latest Premier league game, Potter?” Draco asked, his voice lowered to keep from interrupting the adults.
“I understand if you want to stay with your Aunt and Uncle but-”
Harry waited down in the lobby on the seat Sirius had asked him to wait on. To pass the time, he watched the people coming into the lobby through the revolving doors.
Tracking down Potter proved a long and tiring process. Malfoy would have surely given up by now, if not for the insistent pull of Potter’s beast. The dog had its head low to the ground sniffing, completely ignoring the person that held his reins. Each time Malfoy tired, the beast pulled harshly, causing him to jump forward and keep walking.
Sirius paused. Harry didn’t speak, sure the man had more to say.
“I’ve already lost to much of my life trying to forget you, Pads. I know now you are all I will ever want.”
“Ouch,” Sirius jumped and rubbed his side. “Uh, yeah we’re just out for a walk. Needed to get out of the house.”
“Yeah,” Harry strained to force a smile in return. “Fine thanks, Moony.”
Harry released a shaky laugh. He grabbed his godfather’s wrist before he could continue fussing.
“Apologise and hear him out. Apologise and hear him out. Apologise and…” the keys jingled against the wooden door as he inserted the house key.
“Pads, I think you need to deal with this one on your own,” he muttered, before standing. The buttons on his shirt were askew.
Sirius leaned against the doorframe, his eyes searching the room, avoiding Harry.
Ron winced. He went to say something but was cut off by Hermione.
Eventually, the ceremony ended. Students were given their timetables and were rushed out the door to get to their classes. Ron and Hermione were flocked by the other Gryffindor’s, all offering words of congratulations.
He played the interaction through his mind, pinched himself to check he wasn’t sleeping.
“You know what I mean.”
Finally, the car pulled into a driveway that closer resembled a roundabout. The Driver stopped, and the engines hum lulled to a finite stop. They were stopped at the steps leading to the front door, which Harry thought it larger than any door had a right to be.
“Father thinks Black and you need a break before Thursday.”
It was while these swam through his head, a man approached the table, completely unaware of the inner dilemma playing through the Sirius’s head. It was the sound of the metal chair scraping against the cement ground that drew Sirius from his thoughts, causing him jump. He knocked the table, sending packets of sugar flying everywhere. He quickly scrambled, shoving them back into their allotted spot, hopping he didn’t look like a total loon. A familiar deep chuckle sounded in front of Sirius, and he willed himself to keep from blushing.
Most adults see him as the savior of the wizarding world, but for Sirius he has always just been Lily and James' child, his godson, which is what I wanted to show in this chapter.
“I’ll be fine, guys,” Harry laughed, small and honest this time.
“Guess I will find out when I get home.”
An awkward silence fell over them.
“Whatever! So, did Luna help you today?”
The question sounded like something you would ask a child, but Fleur managed to avoid sounding condescending, her tone closer resembling excitement on Harry’s behalf. Harry nodded, this time managing a true smile.
While he worked his way through his current dilemma, Harry failed to notice the Dursleys approaching. His Aunt and Uncle walked right past him, failing to acknowledge his presence, as they turned to enter the court room.
“I don’t want to talk about this anymore.”
“But you are freaking out.”
“Thank you for having me, Mrs. Malfoy.”
Sirius turned his eyes to the ceiling, tracking the cracked lines on the roof.
Draco picked off a few weeds that were clinging to his pants. He could feel Potter looking at him.
“What makes you think my wife would be interested in that silly stuff?”
The movie was better than both Harry and Draco expected. It was full of major fights between different mythical creatures and the graphics were the best Harry had ever seen. They walked out of the cinemas, happily chatting with Luna about the movie.
“Are you alright?”
Harry and Sirius passed down the street shoulder to shoulder. Sirius held onto Snuffles leash, who trotted along the pavement with his head high in the air. They walked through into the city, crossing down a small street lined with quaint shops. The midday sun kept most people indoors, leaving just Harry and Sirius to walk along the sidewalk. They had not spoken to each other. They merely walked with sombre expression and slow steps.
“MUM!” The shout from the other end of the phone caused Harry to jump.
(See the end of the chapter for
“How about this. Whenever you feel comfortable, we can start small. I can come over after school, join you both for afternoon tea, maybe dinner, and we can work our way up to me staying over the night with Sirius. Only once you feel comfortable, of course. How does that sound?”
Harry nodded. Neither moved. It was another thirty minutes, two chimes, before they moved. Again, at Sirius’s instruction.
“I’m sorry-”
Harry looked to Luna, shrugging.
The soft snores from the class was hidden by the monotone commentary running over whatever documentary was being played.
“No, you dunce. You got guardianship. This is different. And if you want to make it impossible for the Dursleys to regain their guardianship over Mr. Potter, you have limited options. The most suitable being adoption, though there are other avenues we could explore.”
“In the midnight hour, I can feel your power,” Sirius sang along to the words, his voice growing louder and deliberately bad. “Just like a prayer, you know I’ll take you there.”
Ginny’s eyes narrowed in on Harry. He tried to maintain eye contact, but he couldn’t hold her gaze.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fine,” he sighed. “If you want to know, I had a fight with Sirius last night.”
Mr. Malfoy stood, buttoning his blazer button.
“It so was.”
Fuck.
“Let’s go Malfoy.”
Harry couldn’t help the small chuckle escaping him, a dopy smile building on his face. He shook his head, trying to wipe his amusement from his face before he left the classroom.
“He, uh,” Harry stumbled for the right words. “He seems less of an asshole.”
“Everything is happening too quick.”
Harry watched them from the kitchen table, sipping on a juice box Sirius had picked up from the supermarket. It was the good brand. The one Dudley use to lord over Harry for never being allowed to have. The sweet taste filled his mouth and trickled down his throat.
“So, I was trying to bake a cake, because how hard could that be? And then, I, uh, kind of, accidentally, set fire to the place.”
“Alright, Black. Tell me, if I were to take on your case, what makes you think you could win. Who in their right mind would trust you with a child?”
Draco shook his head, trying to hide his growing smile from Harry by shifting to the edge of his bed.
“What do you want me to do, Malfoy?”
“You ready, sweetie?”
Sirius opened and closed his mouth. Dread was filling him. He wasn’t even sure how to bring up the topic with Remus, let alone explain everything that had been going on with Harry’s home life.
“It really is…”
“Don’t be stupid!”
“Look, I won’t tell anyone, Potter. I promise.”
“It’s a piece of shit,” Moony smiled, startling a laugh out of Harry. “But it’s what I can afford.”
“Oh, for god sakes, Harry. Turn around!”
Harry waited, anticipation running through his body, making his hands shake.
The question surprised Draco, who stopped walking.
“STOP BARKING! Please!”
“Right, uh, well. Are you living near here now, or…?” Sirius stumbled over the words.
“Never! That was the first time I have ever seen Harry care about what he wore. And I mean, it makes sense that he came to his fashionable and good-looking godfather for help, right?”
Finally, Malfoy looked back, smirk on his face, ready for whatever retort Potter would respond with. He expected to see anger in the boy, unbridled and fierce like he always looked when they fought. He was not expecting the pale, shaking boy he saw.
“Fine!”
Remus gave Sirius a knowing look, aware of his old friend’s diversion tactic before simply nodding his head.
“Like what?”
Slow nods seemed to be the only reaction Harry could force from his body. The other man turned around, frantically buttoning his white shirt. Harry saw the bright red face of Remus Lupin staring back at him. Everybody seemed to hold their breath.
“I said, of course it’s haunted. It’s an ancestral home, you dunce.”
The group laughed, spending the remainder of lunch chatting. Luna and Ginny got on quite well, and Harry was happy to let them run most of the conversation, only contributing when it was asked of him. When the bell rang for the end of break, Harry bid goodbye to Ginny and Luna, who barely spared a second to say goodbye to him, before continuing their heated discussion about flower crowns of all things.
“Come in, come sit,” Sirius said, gesturing his hands to the couch and coffee table.
Despite the abundance of money Sirius had hinted at having, he had never wanted to indulge in anything more than the simple life. Or so he had told Harry. This was why instead of moving into his old family home, which was practically a mansion, Sirius had bought the small unit they now lived in. It also explained why they took public transport. That, and Sirius was still working on fixing his bike’s engine.
Draco looked to Harry.
“I know, I know. I was a right prat about everything, and young and so stupid-”
“Supper is at 7 every night, Potter. I hardly need you reminding me about it.”
“What the fuck do you mean, Malfoy!”
“Harry’s friend made him take photos. I have a copy of them,” Sirius stated softly.
“I’m sorry.”
“Lucius thinks I should replace James. Officially adopt Harry. Make sure his relatives can never touch him again.”
The question was answered with silence. Harry knew what Draco was getting at. There was a reason he hadn’t told Ron about them in his letter, and with a glance at Harry’s face, Draco knew Harry hadn’t told him for the very reason he was implying.
Sirius hands were shaking, and the room suddenly felt colder. He dreaded the question he knew he had to ask.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry woke up on Tuesday morning sweating. His window was open all the way and he had only slept with a sheet, but a mix of the summer heat and nightmares had left his bed shirt soaked. He headed straight to the shower to clean himself, knowing he would have to do a load of washing throughout the day.
He had nearly finished getting dressed when Sirius knocked on his door. His godfather was dressed in a well-fitted black suit, his hair gelled back into a perfect slick style. As expensive and good as he looked, Harry could help but feel it was wrong to see his godfather in something that wasn’t jeans and shirts.
With that, Lucius shut the pale folder in his hands, paced over to Sirius, and handed him the papers. Then, he opened the door and began to stalk out. Sirius scrubbed his face. The idea of adoption hung like a stone in his chest. He didn’t think he could ever forgive himself for replacing James in Harry’s life in such a permanent way. He wasn’t sure James would either.
Thank you for all the kudos and comments, you guys! <3
Each day Harry walked Snuffles through the park across the street, played with him in the backyard, and fed him the vet approved amount. Snuffles, it turned out, ate quite a lot.  By the following Sunday, the dry food had all but run out, and so had the last of the wet food.
“Wait, Draco,” Malfoy stilled. “Don’t go. I’m sorry.”
“Harry, don’t you dare say that,” Sirius placed his hands over his shoulders and shrunk down to view Harry’s face. “If something has upset you, it isn’t stupid. Please, I want to know what happened.”
Then the matter of the custody battle had arose and summer was quickly approaching, Ron and Hermione already planning to leave, and Harry had shut them out. He tried to convince himself it was for their benefit, to protect his friends from the shitfest that was his life, but there was a part of himself that knew otherwise.
“French, of course.”
“I couldn’t believe it, either,” Hermione chimed in. “Malfoy has been acting weird all day. Don’t tell me I’m the only one that’s noticed.”
Harry blinked in shock. Draco’s eyes were narrowed on Dean and Seamus. The two boys looked at each other before burring up.
Each time Sirius patiently explained that no, this wasn’t a joke, yes, he was sure, and yes, they could really get a dog. He even said Harry would be the one to pick it.
‘How are you today?”
“Yeah, you idiot. We love you,” Ron bumped his knees against Harry’s. “Just don’t lie to us about this shit again. We could have helped you!”
“I’m fine, Mione. Promise,” he coughed. She didn’t look convinced. “It’s just, Ron going away is going to be different. That’s all.”
Draco smirked. Harry walked past him and into the cinemas, knowing without looking Draco would follow him.
He was just beginning to close his eyes, head lolling towards the other boy’s shoulder, when he felt Draco stiffen next to him. Harry’s eyes snapped open.
“Oh my god,” Ginny gasped. “Are you two dating?”
“I don’t know if you noticed, Potter, but she isn’t exactly normal. No one at Hogwarts is friends with her because she’s weird. That’s why everyone calls her Loony Lovegood.”
“I am not!”
Harry couldn’t help how wet his laugh came out. It sounded like a sob, and Sirius quickly shoved Snuffles from his lap, standing up to approach Harry.
Harry walked towards the dresser and carefully opened the top drawer. Everything inside it was black. Carefully, Harry sifted through the mess of unfolded clothes until he found what he was after. He quickly tried the black skinny jeans on, shoving his legs into the pants, hopping to pull them up. He quickly walked out of Sirius’s room, shutting the door softly behind him.
The two adults walked quickly into the living room, already discussing the business of the day. Harry and Malfoy loitered in the hallway, standing a few metres apart.
“Ze noise can be a bit much,” Fleur said over the barking. “Don’t worry though, take your time. If you see someone you like, I can let zem out and you can get to know zem a little better.”
When he finished, he hung his head, shaking it slightly. Sirius was too stunned to respond.
As much as he tried, Sirius couldn’t keep his voice from seeping disappointment.
“Could you be more careful?”
They sat in silence again, the only noise in the room the platter of rain on the window and snippets of conversations resonating from the television.
Remus nodded.
“She practically begged me for it when Mother died. Didn’t you hear?”
Remus huffed and rolled his eyes.
They sat in silence after those words. Harry stared into space, his eyes unfocused. A deep fear settled within him, twisting his stomach and making him nauseous. Distantly, he could hear Sirius talking to him, could feel him rubbing his arm. The touch made his skin crawl, but he couldn’t bring himself to shrug Sirius off.
“Then tell me what’s bothering you, bud. You don’t look comfortable with this, and it’s worrying me.”
Harry felt his face heat up. He wondered what Mrs. Malfoy meant by that. He let out a nervous laugh that he hoped Draco wouldn’t hear.
All it lacked was a television. Harry noticed sitting on the small coffee table was a red and gold wrapped box.
“I guess I’m worried they wont like him, or something. And our whole friendship they have been helping me deal with the Dursleys, this time, I just. I thought I could do it without them. To show them… I don’t know, that they didn’t… I don’t know.”
“One of my cousins’ husband. He’s one of the best lawyers around. Hopefully I can convince him to take our case.”
She took a deep breath, before walking the last steps to Harry. Draco was still on high alert but was kept at bay by Harry’s sharp tap to his forearm.
Harry looked at the sign above the shop when Sirius walked away. It read Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour.
Even saying the words physically pained Harry.
“It’s simply lovely. I’ve already seen it five times this summer,” she smiled again, the same soft eyes staring at Harry. She held up five fingers for Harry to see.
“I just don’t want you to get hurt.”
Remus paused, tilting his head to the side.
“You got me a present?” Harry couldn’t keep the disbelief from his voice. His birthday had been a few days ago. He had only even received presents from Ron, Hermione and some years Hagrid, Hogwarts agriculture teacher.
“What should we do then?” Malfoy asked.
Harry finally took notice of the room he was in. It was like the top floor of a grand hotel. The entire layout was silver and green, just like the Slytherin house colours, Harry noted unhappily. It gave off the aura of rich and spoilt. A couch that looked more expensive than anything Harry owned was pushed up against a wall, and in front of it, a table fit with a fruit display. An opened door showed off a walk-in wardrobe filled to the brim with designer clothes, and another door led to a bathroom nicer than any spa Harry could ever imagine going to. In the centre of the room was the canopy bed which looked so extravagant, Harry thought it was something only seen in movies.
“Mum!” Draco whined in the distance, before talking into the phone. “Sorry about her. My parents don’t really understand boundaries.”
“I need a verbal response, Mrs. Dursley.”
Their first class of the day was torture. Double history with Professor Binns and the Ravenclaws. Ron and Hermione were flooded with congratulations still, each still riding on the excitement of their new roles. Even Hermione was struggling to pay attention, shifting in her seat and smiling to herself.
His godfathers’ eyes were ablaze, and while looking at Harry, he kept the Dursleys within his range of sight. Sirius’s jaw was set. His back straight. He looked like the murderer he had once been convicted as. It was in that moment, that Harry saw the dangerous man Sirius had once been in prison. This was the man he had heard hushed stories about, shared between shocked social workers who couldn’t believe Sirius was the same man they had been warned about. This was the man who survived twelve years in Azkaban, by himself, despite his innocence. Anyone would have been frightened by the murderous glint in the man’s eyes. However, rather than feeling scared by this side of his godfather, Harry felt safe. Protected. It was in that moment, Harry realised Sirius would never let him go back to the Dursleys. Not without a fight.
