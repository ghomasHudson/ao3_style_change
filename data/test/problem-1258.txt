" Draco just kept his hand up, and reluctantly, Harry leaned forward and slapped it. "Okay, fine, now tell me, how am I going to-"
Weasley stepped out of the way. Draco was gratified by the knowledge he hadn't seen Weasley in all his shallow Gryffindor glory, so Weasley shouldn't able to see whatever vision the mirror conjured up for him. He was doubly glad Weasley couldn't see, when the suggestion of his reflection disappeared completely, to replace it with only Harry Potter. He looked as he had in the dim light of the Quidditch shed, when he confronted Draco over Finnigan, poised right on the edge of saying or doing something irrevocable- except it was Draco on that edge, but Draco had disappeared. Potter looked out at him from inside the mirror, with that fierce look that never failed to split him in two, that look that Draco could travel seven or a hundred years and never escape-
Not now, though. Remus had told Harry as soon as he reached them on the mirror not to hand over his wand, and not to leave the house, but Draco had half a mind to Apparate over there himself. He might have, if he wasn't certain that a lecture would then be upgraded to a full-scale nuclear meltdown.
Draco maintained his intention to avoid the Yule Ball at all costs. The news that Ron and Potter had secured the Patil twins as dates only reaffirmed his belief that everything would go perfectly fine now without his intrusion. But he changed his mind on Christmas Eve, after Luna found out that Neville had asked Ginny Weasley.
"You might as well come, Krum," Draco said loftily. "Otherwise, everyone will think you've gotten too scared of my obviously superior Seeker skills."
Draco began to nibble at the croissant in Harry's hand, enjoying the feeling of Harry's fingers against his face as much as the sweet taste. "Spoiling me," he mumbled, and licked the first round of crumbs off Harry's fingertips. Harry let out a soft moan at the feeling.
"Because I watched you kill Wormtail?" Harry whispered, and Draco tilted his head at him, giving him a deliberately manic, twisted smirk.
Voldemort was as revolting a thing to behold as always, a monster that Draco had dreamed of never having to see again, much less helping to make.
Muggle or not, victory had a halo effect on the Kingsnakes hoodies, as they made their triumphant entrance to the common room after all clad in the dark green and silver. Yes, they received a fair number of insults and casual death threats for emblazoning the sacred name of Salazar Slytherin on such an ignominious article of traditional Muggle-wear. But they received just as many whispered requests from their housemates wondering where they could buy one for themselves.
"Really?" Harry breathed. Draco took Harry's glasses off, putting them aside, and then it felt like casting a wall of fire, the way those green eyes took hold of him and wouldn't let him go.
When Severus came around with the list for students staying, Draco didn't even know why he bothered asking Draco. Father had ensured the whole school knew Draco wasn't welcome home, and no message had arrived from Mother to offer anything in contradiction. He took her silence as a cue and gave the Howler no reply. It was one of the longest conversations he'd had in weeks, other than with Severus and Granger, when Theo came to the dorm to let him know Severus was in the common room taking names. "Um, Draco, you aren't going home for Christmas, are you? Professor Snape is making the list, so..."
"I will," said Remus, and Draco's hand went out of his pocket, resolving not to be feeling at any kind of weapon at the most sacred moment. For his part, Sirius seemed to visibly relax, as if even after that, some part of him had still doubted that Remus would really hitch his wagon to such an unreliable ride. But he had said the words, and now he took Sirius's hand and slid on the ring, the snowdrop a spark like sunlight on the ocean as it slid into place.
"You- you're giving me extra Potions lessons?" Draco had finally found someone worse at punishments than his father. "That's what detention means?"
There was the list Draco had made, written out in big proud letters as if all self-evident. But he frowned at the last two items, not knowing how he hadn't noticed the contradiction there. He had thought his mind was so collected and resolute these days, but it must be more scattered than ever, to make such logical errors. He crossed out
"Theodore Nott sent you a Black Dagger," Severus breathed, almost a real gasp from such an unflappable man. "Before sixth year even started. And you neglected to so much as inform us he-"
Even if he hadn't heard the prophecy, though, Periander's warning about not using his wand anymore should have sufficed to mark him as too dangerous to be that close to someone that irreplaceable. He should have known it even without Periander, the dark magic he had done already, all the strangeness and power of his wand, the strangeness of his arrival in the red line to begin with, the blue loop's warning that Ginny Weasley was who Harry Potter would
He followed his old self, watching him run with the others behind the fountain, and Harry direct them to go around and surprise the Death Eaters with stunners. Harry was magnificent as ever in the face of danger. But Bellatrix's voice made it impossible to enjoy anything about the nightmare that Draco had been foolish enough to plunge himself back into.
Father turned on his heel, and perhaps he would have gone then, to the popping sound of elves disapparating, in the wake of witnessing one of their own receiving the worst punishment a master could give save death- perhaps, in most of their eyes, worse than death. But not Dobby's, and Draco was laughing. He couldn't help himself, laughing and laughing where he lay shaking on the floor. Because he knew Father could make awful decisions, and been weak or even cowardly, but he had never thought Father could be this
professor. "I should not have thought you so elated, given that you and your cousin received a retrospectively
"Like Hagrid? Come on, with the war on, would they ever have seriously expected me to meekly submit to having my wand snapped? Or even if I did agree, that they could succeed at it, with
"I'm not the problem," Draco complained even as Severus seized him, taking him to his study and sitting him on one of the armchairs, while Luna trailed them with a look about her like the Grey Lady of her house. "I'm not here about
"I'm going to be an Unspeakable," Draco told them all loftily, "So I will have no time to speak to my fellow children, and intend to dedicate myself exclusively to my studies in preparation for this difficult but illustrious occupation. I would appreciate it if you do not bother me further trying to interfere with my goals."
A look from Hermione silenced her. It took Draco a second to remember that Remus's condition had only been spread around Hogwarts in the blue loop. Millie had no idea she was giving Draco something poisonous to one of his new guardians. But all the Gryffindors did. A new level of awkwardness rose in the air, as Millie looked hurt at Draco's non-reaction, and then at the forced gratefulness he produced, knowing he would have to get rid of it as soon as possible.
"Theo," Draco said, leaning forward and touching his thigh, "I haven't brought you in here to debauch you." Even if the way Theo's eyes dropped to Draco's hand showed a certain skepticism towards that assertion. "This is just the only place in Hogwarts I can be sure we won't be seen or overheard. Theo, I've never known anyone better at keeping a secret. Or at researching-"
So Ron got his wish after all. He showed up only a bit behind Draco and Krum. When he saw not one but two figures flying about above him, one in the robes of the Bulgarian national team, he let out a shriek more high-pitched than any he had produced since first year.
Draco hated his rush of instinctive protectiveness then, but he couldn't help it. "You don't know anything about it, so hold your tongue!"
Potter's face went the most fascinating shade of Gryffindor red. "I'm sorry, I just- I didn't mean to eavesdrop, I'm just excited about flying lessons tomorrow, too," he mumbled, and dropped his book and positively fled the library. Granger watched him go rather analytically.
"You saw me play Quidditch against him," Draco said impatiently, "And even if you hadn't, surely you can do
"Kreacher?" Remus called, and with a distinct grumbling sound, another place setting appeared. Remus cut a generous piece of lamb and began to serve the sides. Severus cast a derisive look down at the snowdrop ring on the hand serving him, before taking his knife and bringing it down in the way.
So either she was so ignorant she would be of no use, or she was just playing dumb, lying to his face and insulting his intelligence. Either way, he found himself just about as angry at her as anyone else in the world. If she knew Father was planning something at Hogwarts, that meant putting her own son theoretically at risk, pureblood or not. This was the woman who had once lied to the Dark Lord about Potter being dead. Where was that woman now?
an incantation, Potter," Severus reminded him. That was admirable charitableness, assuming there would even be a spell to block.
name away or Father's- you took down the wards and got him in to take Harry, and you set those monsters on my friends-"
Time passed before Sinistra's enchanted note could summon Severus from his chambers, and he came soon enough that he must not have been sleeping yet. He took one look at Draco's shivering form, sick and the talon wand strewn around him, and began to bark furiously at Sinistra, saying she should have canceled the whole class, sent the others away to give Draco space...
Ron was called upon to help set the table, and they headed back, Ron a few steps ahead. Hermione explained that she didn't want to get Ron and Harry on his back again like last year with references to Draco being involved in dark mysteries.
And sure enough, there was shock-disbelief-panic on that unusually expressive version of Theo's face, before Potter could muster up a weak, "Yeah, I don't think Snape much likes watching his students snogging."
"I know you hate the man," Harry hissed, while Draco tried and failed to hide his pleasure. "But this is important!" He lowered his voice and glared. Likely his ire was really fueled by resentment he couldn't join taking the test. "A lot could depend on those lessons. On that memory I need from Slughorn. So don't look
He almost thought he didn't want Harry there, would rather just lie alone thinking vicious things about himself. Except Harry offered, "Maybe I could, um, massage your head?"
"Look at me," Draco said, grabbing both his hands. Harry stopped pacing. "I know how much your parents mean to you."
"Okay, fine, fine, if it means that much to you, I'll go to the last DA meeting this semester, alright?" Draco groused.
if I don't go. That's the one thing that makes me... I don't know, hopefully they'll just torture him a lot..."
"Well," Charlie said with a cheeky grin, "Very covert, top-secret business. Really shouldn't be here, but I couldn't miss the chance to stop by and maybe catch my favorite little brother-"
Dumbledore's laughter rocketed down from the High Table, and the laughter of the Weasley twins joined it painfully from the other side of him. Such a grand time they and Potter seemed to be having with the cheap little wizard crackers, which Draco hadn't needed anyone's teaching to know were for peasants. The Great Hall grew less and less great as the dinner went on, Hagrid trying to kiss McGonagall and making Draco's vision fill with the image of Hagrid led into the Hogwarts courtyard carrying the dead-looking body of Harry Potter. So he looked in the other direction, and he still could not decipher which of the twins congratulating Potter on his new wizard's chess set was the one that Draco's fellow Death Eaters were going to kill.
He felt as lamentably helpless as he ever had, as the Ravenclaws regarded Theo and then Draco with none of Draco's paralysis of guilt. Michael brashly asked, "Draco, is that true? Was it Bellatrix Lestrange, or was it Narcissa Malfoy?"
Potter didn't let him for long, though, hand clamping down on his with a fervor that seemed to be pleading in a way his words couldn't.
in the medical sense. He informed Draco that these were called panic attacks, common among people who had suffered terrible things, especially at a young age. He said he'd known more than a few people with them, and that Draco shouldn't have been ashamed to ask for help. But Draco was mortally ashamed, all the more so when Severus said those brutally kind words. This was
"Well, on that bright note, I think it's my time to go," Draco said drolly, "Have fun, you lot," and brushed off the trio quickly enough to follow Myrtle as she fled through the Slytherin labyrinth he knew like the back of his hand. Admittedly, she did have the advantage she could float through walls, but when he cast Lumos maxima, it drew her attention enough to float back through the nearest one to him. Maybe she thought he was another ghost from it- which, in one way of thinking, wasn't entirely false.
They all fell to chattering then, Draco teasing Luna mercilessly, until finally Hermione noticed a quiet Potter staring off broodingly into nowhere. "Oh, cheer up, Harry!" she said sadly.
They took Harry on a walk around the lake on the 12th of January, working to bring him around gradually together to the idea of lending the Marauder's Map for not hours but weeks. But the moment he heard what they were planning, he suggested it himself, without them having to ask. He fished it out, insisting that they would need it not to get caught. He seemed impressed by Hermione's rule-breaking, though unsurprised by Draco's. "So you'll be spending hours in our Potions class every week, Draco," Harry reckoned out, "Plus three hours extra with Snape on Sunday nights. And now you're brewing another complicated potion on the side as well?"
He made a few token attempts to feign ineptitude, which turned out harder than it sounded. Eventually, he saw the risk of drawing more attention by bad acting, and changed to lowkey uninvolved mode, buried at the back of each classroom when they were allowed to choose their seats.
Draco noticed his audience had stopped listening, but Potter leaned into his ear and whispered, "Why are you so good at lying?" before either of them noticed Charlie was there, only seeing when Hermione elbowed them.
think it made me stronger?" she asked, a ruefulness in her pale eyes that made her look more rare and unusual than ever, as separate a changeling in the riotous waking world as he was. He put an arm around her while keeping her hand in his, and tugged on her long pale green hair.
"That one wasn't me, Harry," Draco sighed, "I don't know how many times I have to tell you," and Harry looked unspeakably glum.
"I ate earlier," Luna said, pulling her knees up tight to her chest, and rested her chin on them to stare out the lake. Her very long hair at least gave her some form of wind shield. She pulled Draco's cloak all about her as another shield, though with how long she could have been sitting out here, he didn't know how much it would help. "Don't worry, Draco. I've just been thinking."
"Do you know anything about them?" Weasley asked impatiently, and Draco nodded. Part of him was surprised his head didn't freeze on his shoulders. But maybe the threshold would only be crossed if he tried to say something like,
Lockhart did turn pale then, though that might have been the blue cast of the flames. "I didn't mean to- the Quidditch accident, right- and the girl in the Chamber- I didn't know. I'm sorry. I- is she alright?"
Harry had little luck in his Slughorn project after, but with Draco's help alongside Frank, Alice, Sirius, and Remus, the citadel was coming together more nicely. What an indignity, to give so much aid to the one of Dumbledore's projects that was actually working.
"The day of the Third Task?" Draco asked weakly. At Severus's bewildered look, he mumbled, "We took it all really early in the morning. It wore off by the time fake Moody got to me."
Draco was appropriately unenthusiastic after that, and secured the pass with a promise of the infusion's delivery soon. Severus had one more question, though, before he left Draco wrapped up in his bedcovers to rest. "Your father," Severus said, with a guarded look of pain on his face, "Told me that the Assessor forced you to perform the Killing curse for him, although you were reluctant." Draco nodded, wincing. "And that you were successful in it. You must promise me, Draco, that in whatever situation you find yourself, you will never use that curse again. Even in self-protection, the most desperate circumstances, there are other curses. But Avada Kedavra... promise me those words will never again leave your lips as a spell."
When Draco reached the eagle knocker, it had yet another riddle that felt pointed, although that could be Draco's paranoia talking. "Why is an evil man like a cloud?" it asked.
Dobby stared at Draco with earnest marble eyes gone almost misty, helping to prop him up with a meticulous gentleness. "Master Draco is so kind to Dobby. Master Draco is good. Master Draco- Draco- Draco Malfoy is like Harry Potter."
"Okay," Potter said, lips turning up into the sweetest little smile, and then he bit the lower one and looked down bashfully. "So, um, what you said before- the notice is up that there's a visit to Hogsmeade this month, so... would you want for us to go together? Just the two of us?"
"NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!" cried the witch, which gave the interesting information that the creature was called
"I don't drink," Harry said, who seemed to think it far more festive to sit there alone doing nothing in the dark. "Shouldn't you be out there celebrating with Charlie Weasley?"
"I think that's why he really took me away, when he knew he was dying," Draco said, pressing his advantage to get it all out while Dumbledore was still listening, and not trying to leave or murder Draco for the affront. "He wanted to confess what he'd done back then. He wanted y- wanted the world to know the Dumbledores were innocent."
He'd given up on the idea of hiding the talon wand fairly early in his personal planning process, since he couldn't use any other, and didn't need to have not using magic as another thing to think about. And Grindelwald shouldn't be able to know just by looking what it was. Even if his gaze did stay on the wand and not the water. Once Draco had lifted the cup to his lips and emptied it, Grindelwald's eyes returned resentfully to it finally.
"I told her what we'd done as soon as you lot were off," Draco reassured him. "Luna and Neville heard too. We
him as easily? Draco knew it was the sins of the blue loop in his head, not this younger Theo ignorant of Draco's real resentments, but he couldn't believe it still.
"Yes, that's what she said," Draco said eagerly, only to pull back as he reached the hard part. "And she said... um... listen, sir, I know you aren't going to like this, and you showed me that memory for a reason, I really do know that, and I don't want to ever, ever do anything that would make you think I'm your enemy-"
"Um, hi, Draco," Potter said gingerly, "You, uh, you and Hermione's potion, er, you looked great today." It seemed friendship with Granger meant he was
"If it's Hermione Granger," Draco sighed, "I'll come. If it's Potter, tell him the way to Gryffindor Tower is up the stairs, and he should consider a map if he keeps getting lost on his way."
"That's the one I wanted to show you," Taylor said proudly. "No name yet, but here's the sweetest of the bunch. Never snapped those pointy teeth at no one, not even once."
"Draco, he's not going to," Hermione began, but Harry had already leaned forward and eaten the spoonful. "Never mind," she sighed, while Ron sniggered.
His arm remained draped over Draco's shoulders on the way down towards the dungeons, although less in an affectionate manner and more like he thought Draco might bolt. "Boy," he said, stopping at the entrance to the Slytherin dungeons and taking him by the shoulders with a serious look. "How did you know about the diary?"
"You're robbing my brother," Aberforth surmised, before leaning forward with a gleam in his bright blue eyes. "How can I help?"
He avoided Gryffindors until their first shared class, Double Potions on Friday morning. He remembered Severus's classes as a highlight of his week, both from the impressiveness of Severus in his brooding theatrical element, mastery of his art apparent for anyone with brains, and from the even higher theater that had been Severus's continuous persecution of brainless Gryffindors. Draco's anticipation was tempered, though, by the realization he would have to spend a considerable time in the same room as Harry Potter. Yes, they had both been in the Great Hall, and with Potter craning his neck in Draco's direction once or twice, but that barely counted. This did, and though Draco timed his arrival to avoid socializing before the start of class, he still felt increased proximity to Potter as an infinitely self-proliferating wound, trapped by late arrival into one of the nearest desks to the Gryffindors, which meant nearer to his least favorite person alive.
"Why does this photograph not move?" Karkaroff asked, running his fingers over the image of him and the Grangers at Highbury. Draco didn't know how he could have imagined those hands were Severus's. Draco had never seen Severus wear a ring in his life save the dragon Ouroboros one, let alone one on every finger like that.
The dog was staring across the room at Potter, longing as visible as any dog's face could ever have shown it. There was recognition on Potter's face as well. "I've seen you," Potter said slowly. "Outside Privet Drive. And at the match against Slytherin. Professor Trelawney- you're the Grim-"
It didn't take long for the meeting to show just how far everyone had come in Draco's absence, Neville most of all. As they spent the session just reviewing past ones, watching Neville navigate Impedimenta was a revelation. Draco kept going over to compliment him on it, until Neville was blushing ear to ear in happiness. He started regretting coming to the meeting when they started up on Stunning spells, and Luna's proved a real whopper. For his part, he wanted to stun Luna so little, he found the spells not even working half the time.
After a baffled silence, Ron startled them all with a laugh. "Oh, right! See, Ginny, Luna, we found out You-Know-Who might not really be dead, and Draco said Harry had been slacking on the job! I'll never forget how angry Harry got. He was hopping mad, saying that if You-Know-Who wasn't dead, he'd just kill him again."
He was pleased to find he could Apparate directly into the cellar storerooms without any issues. Father hadn't closed the wards against him. Maybe just because he didn't know Draco could Apparate, but still, kind of him. And Draco found the myrrh, black quicksilver, and pickling solution and equipment all soon enough, in perfect-looking order and condition.
His eyes weren't leaving Draco for a second. Just the sound of his voice tied Draco's stomach in knots. It was like after so long apart, turning over the idea in his head everyday of breaking it off, it was back to when they were first getting involved, the same suspicions of his own insufficiency. But Harry's gaze held him just as spellbound. Maybe more, now that he seemed was Draco was bound to and yet refused to lose.
Draco reminded himself, and yet his feet still stumbled back, talon wand rattling in his hand, practically falling over something too burned to be recognizable. He didn't understand. He just
or whatever between them, the worse it seemed to get. Seeing Harry this jealous made him want to be somewhere truly alone, so he could let Harry take it out on him...
"Oh, right!" Ron snapped, turning with a wild savagery on his best friend then. "I suppose Draco told you to say that! You'd say anything
It was enough of a disguise that even Theo didn't seem to recognize him that night, though Theo was quite distracted at the time. Astoria was making such a scene at the top of the steps to the dungeons, it seemed Draco might not be the first of the archenemies being dumped after all. Well, Draco would ask Ginny for the gossip on it later. He quickly walked off, after instinctually fitting himself into the front of the crowd to gawk. He'd done enough eavesdropping recently.
"Yes, it is," Draco said, "I'm very fond of dragons, show him, Striker," and had to practically drape himself over Potter to drag Hermione's wrist with her bracelet over to show Charlie the baby dragon tooth on it. Charlie was obligingly impressed by the bracelet, though he sounded more impressed by the transfiguration when Hermione told him it was Draco's. The period of inspection left Draco leaned over Potter, his side and thigh braced on his. Luna handed over Potter's glasses to return to him. Draco automatically put them back on his face for him, and might have fallen into the fire when he felt the back of his knuckles happen to brush Potter's lips.
"You don't think you've changed at all since then?" Harry said earnestly, and Draco somehow doubted he just meant today's birthday.
He stared pointedly at the brand on Karkaroff's hand. "It's got some things in common with the Dark Mark, you know, my personal brand. Except it isn't meant for friends, but for enemies. You are
He'd wanted to show Luna these at some point. They were most beautiful at night like this, all the more with their year-long enchanted bloom frosted over with snow. The frost had a heartbreakingly lovely eeriness to its glow, with the silver icicle lights strewn over the nearby terrace gardens reflecting down upon them. Draco sat on the first bench he could find to look over the scene and properly drink in its beauty. He finished off the champagne flute he had taken with him, casting another Ninguifors to turn it to snow he could watch drift down over the nearest roses. They were all golden, and the shiver the sight of that color sent through him showed he had gotten drunker than he had meant to. He should have known better. This body was only thirteen.
"You know that pureblood families," Draco began, and stopped himself. It wasn't the same, Harry had gone through so much worse. Harry had been neglected, while Draco had been given everything material he ever wanted, the only child, the heir, and he'd actually done things to deserve getting punished...
, who had somehow come to believe in him still, at the worst possible time. And here Draco was, irresponsibly chasing more of that belief. "I brought proof, if you want it, anyway," he said as planned, and deposited a Polaroid in Harry's grasp. Harry peered at it with bemusement, while Draco used the opportunity to seize the parchment with the family tree and look at the story it told: the invisible red lines trailing up and then down again, from Dantanian and Dorian, to where they met and proved themselves to have just been one line instead all along- in the person of Draco Black.
And then his half-sleep was broken by moonlight, as they reached some sort of break in the trees that looked artificially cleared. That made it all too easy to see what the moonlight revealed: that perhaps Draco had not been right to be so sarcastic in forecasting a spider party after all.
Before they could attend to party business, there was the exhaustive examination to undergo of Draco's favorite book for anything useful,
The sign read, in Dobby's distinctive large block handwriting, painted in merry red and green: MISTLETOE IS MAGICALLY BINDING! NO ESCAPE WITHOUT REAL LONG KISS! HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS, DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY! There was an adorable caricature of two non-gendered stick figures smooching beneath, a cartoon heart shooting out between them.
"It matters a great deal," Hermione said tensely, "Since if Professor Dumbledore won't talk- you said Aberforth already searched and questioned that Bagshot woman- then I'm sorry, but the only other person we know who could
"Dumbledore shouldn't have left him alone," Hermione fretted. Draco deactivated the map and put it away with a sigh.
"Kiss me again," Draco ordered. Harry climbed onto the bed and pushed Draco down onto his back. Then he kissed him like he would never get the chance to touch him again. The nervous desperation was palpable, unsteady like he hadn't been since the first few times they kissed, like it would be his last chance to ever feel Draco beneath him.
Draco let out an aggravated sigh. Was he about to be obligated to curse a fellow Slytherin on his very first night back, just to keep up the protection his reputation gave him? "Didn't mean what, Theo? You'll have to be
No doubt Potter had taken this punishment better. It did feel like a punishment, for all of his fumbling about with the diary that added up to nothing changed. Or for trying that feint against Potter, though that was within Quidditch rules as far as he knew...
Severus pulled back, giving him a dubious look. "Is this such a surprise, vain boy? I knew this would be the result when I made you captain. Even in such an unbalanced sport as Quidditch- ultimately, when applied properly, the day will always be won by the most
Hermione and Luna had stayed behind, with Hermione insistent on scouring the house for any books or evidence that could help, and Draco reluctant to leave Hermione alone. He'd left them a Portkey for two hours later that would take them to Hogsmeade, and he was sure if they fell in enough peril, Hermione would be desperate enough to use her Apparition lessons to get them out of there sooner. He was more uncertain about the reaction of Xaphan to his arrival.
Wooky and Nissy's stares burned into the backs of their heads at that. But Draco could only shake his head laughing and agree.
"We want you to be winning, Mistress Pansy," Nissy said anxiously. "Dobby said that no one is believing a Slytherin team with girls can win. So Nissy wants Mistress Pansy to prove them wrong. Nissy wants that very, very, very, very, very, very much!"
"Pammaque Periander," Harry read from the large curved face of the gravestone. "1955 to 1995. No inscription." Harry seemed to be waiting for an explanation, and Draco just corrected his pronunciation. "Sorry, but why are we here?"
Harry could not have looked less afraid of Draco's words. If anything, he was starting to look hungry, like when he wanted to drag Draco off and make out for as much time they could steal- but not just that anymore. "I want you any way I can get. I always have. I want-" He leaned close enough for Draco to feel his breath, foreheads resting together, the warmth of his skin an indelible brand. "You don't know how bad I want you-"
"Grateful for my acceptance? Your standard payment for kindness?" Severus said wryly, and then more forebodingly, "Or perhaps you mistook me for someone else."
"Oh, he will not," Father growled, and took Draco's stained shirt and flung it at Dobby, who caught it with widening eyes. "You will get him into no further disgrace, because I will not have a house elf on these historic premises who will disrespect them and endanger my son. Let this be a lesson to all of you. Follow my laws or you too will be cast out into the cold. Dismissed!"
"Worse," Draco said, "He's worse than Quirrell, and that's saying something." He lowered his voice. "I reckon Quirrell would have had a fair shot at being a decent teacher, stutter and all, if he didn't have the darkest wizard in history camped out on the back of his head. At least in comparison to
Lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the rescue. Severus looked more likely to keep goading it on than have a chance of heart and come to his secret admirer's aid. Draco hadn't seen him look this pleased with himself in years
"It was a lie, though," Gilderoy said anxiously, as soon as the memory had ended and Draco pulled his head out of the Pensieve. "I tried to avoid it- tried to dig under it- but I didn't get far enough, and in the end we had no choice but to risk it. And myself and all those little girls swam and struggled through half of that terrible lake and its cold, but once I was out of it, in time, my magic returned. I can't remember how long. Only that they wanted me to make a fire, and I could. So I told the Catalan ministry, but they don't
, he reminded himself, trying not to stare at his mother's name on the family tree, right above his own.
Had Potter actually left his favorite Weasel to deliver this counter-productively painful shoulder-clutching apology? Draco cast a look back and there were the three remaining Gryffindors from their boat a step or two behind, Weasley looking none too happy at Potter going to him, though it was a Gryffindor thing to do. Raised by Muggles and not sure if it was true about Draco, all Potter knew was that Weasley must have hurt Draco's feelings.
Luna and Draco exchanged blank looks. "Does that mean I'm not allowed to catch snowflakes on my tongue?" Luna asked dubiously. It had begun to snow lightly, and she had indeed been engaging in such a sin for minutes on end.
It was what he always did with danger, freeze up if not outright flee. He didn't think he had in the Forbidden Forest, but the centaurs had saved him before he would ever know, and now he could see his own true colors. With meticulous planning, he could accomplish things, like with the Vanishing Cabinet, but in heat-of-the-moment confrontation, he was worse than useless. The passive approach had suited him best, because that was what he was-
this wand? Unless he turned into or melded with Astaroth..." He laid the talon wand on Severus's table, and stared at it, thinking,
"Excuse me," Dorian said poutily, "If you notice, I've uncovered your secret, Dionysus. I know your true identity. It explains why you weren't very close to her, until she was in trouble and ostracized, and then you stopped keeping your distance-"
He had never thought he would end up in the cellars like this again, stripped to the waist on his knees with his father's walking stick battering his back, not even bothering with stinging jinxes and going straight to venting a very personal rage. Draco had thought himself too formidable a wizard to submit to that treatment again. But he couldn't have fought off a first-year in this exhausted state, and the bonus of that was that he kept drifting in and out, never fully registering the punishment.
Draco led Harry out of the library hand-in-hand and up the closest flight of stairs, ready to be told off once they reached their destination. "Where are we going?" Harry asked, though he didn't seem to want to stop holding hands.
"It was a joke, Father, I'm fine, none of it's my blood," Draco said shakily, and Father stared in his eyes long enough to wrench at Draco's heart, with that face he had used to venerate more than anything-
There was another motive to Krum wanting to hang out with them, as quickly became clear, once Krum questioned him the next weekend about Hermione. He'd learned how to pronounce her name correctly, and taken to sitting near them in the library, doing a bad job of hiding his staring at her. Not that she ever noticed, except to complain about his presence, which drew giggling girls spying on Krum in turn with no interest in studying.
"Filthy Mudblood presuming to speak to Kreacher, oh, yes, this place has gone to the dogs, if Kreacher's mistress could see, but the invert blood traitor sliced up her portrait..."
Harry's pupils dilated, green eyes darkening, but he only dignified that sensual memory with a mutter of, "Evil dragon. Just do it."
over and over along the way. Severus had been a Death Eater, a spy, in both the first and second wars. He would know Wormtail, and if those others were Death Eaters, he might know those names too. Severus had been around Wormtail more than a few times in Draco's sight in the blue loop, never seeming especially fond of him. But who was? Aunt Bella had made the nastiest jests against Wormtail when not comparing him favorably to Father, and he had been fair game. Even though, without Wormtail, it was hard to think how the Dark Lord would have risen again...
?" Draco drawled, setting Neville into nervous laughter at the memory of dousing them with Stinksap. As the Hogwarts Express moved, Draco thought he ought to dislodge himself from Harry's lap, but when he made a half-hearted effort, Harry's soft protesting noise gave him the excuse to stay in place. So Draco just turned to face the others, letting Harry pull him close from behind. He snuggled back against Harry, as secure in Luna and Neville's presence as if they were alone, and Harry wrapped his arms tightly around Draco's shoulders.
"Why did he do that to you?" Draco asked bleakly. "You never would have imagined he would have sent you to your death like that, even though he was a Black- he was a Gryffindor
Draco was, and he immediately began to concoct any desperate excuse he could to skip proceedings. Hopefully Apparition testing would somehow go long.
"He's still alive," Sirius said happily. "Looks like reports of him not caring about his hair were exaggerated. Thank Merlin, if he'd given up on that, I
There was a pathway remaining to get out of the foyer around the lake. Draco led the way, pulling Grindelwald with Harry while Dobby and Severus shielded Gilderoy with their wands. The ceiling of the foyer had already begun to cave in. They barely managed to dodge one of the last remaining stones overhead once they were in the entrance hall, the sight of bright blue sky open to them with only a slender path forwards, but they were taking it. No one seemed to be coming after them. The only one he'd seen for sure intact with his magic was Theo- but no, there were a few more footsteps after them still, dark silhouettes crossing the same threshold and climbing after them over broken stone...
The stands were rather more exciting. The crowd became one great mass of intent, heads turning back and forth to follow the course of the ball over the pitch, which Hermione refused to let Draco use his Omnioculars to see. The excitement was palpable as the people around them rose to their feet and sat depending on the action on the pitch, or sometimes the savage Muggle chant they had chosen to join, which Mr. Granger informed him were particularized to each club, and were varied or even altered in the moment depending on the state of the match. At one point, various parts of Arsenal's own fans began to sing defiantly in opposition towards one another, in some sort of arbitrary partisan loyalty to their North End and Clock End. Draco feared an incidence of fisticuffs until Mr. Granger informed him this was all perfectly normal and in good fun.
Most importantly, there was Severus. Draco's heart brightened to see him, looking the same as their last meeting from a distance. Severus didn't meet his gaze, making small talk with Sinistra at his side. Draco reminded himself that Severus had a cover to keep up, a matter of life and death. He would be different when they were alone. Things would be as they had been. Or as much as they could be, with a different color around Draco's neck.
Unfortunately, Neville was off somewhere, so Luna was fully attentive to Aragog's plight. "I don't know, Hagrid has been awfully kind to-"
"Pyritaverum. Aurulaquerum," Draco whispered, looking around, and cast Aurulaquerum a few more times. After turning bronze to the realest-looking fool's good he could, he cast a shine that should hold the plaque untarnished for decades. He had used the charm many times giving the shine he wanted to Harry's golden rose ring, which Draco had not seen since the night of the Third Task. For all Draco knew, Harry had thrown it away... no, he should pay attention to delicate transfiguration...
When Draco was woken by footsteps on the stairs, he lifted his head to see Harry already sitting up, eyes wide open. He didn't seem to have slept for a minute, and he slid out of bed beside a still-sleeping Ron to pad out. Draco followed him, and they came face-to-face with a frantic-looking Mrs. Weasley. Her usually friendly, ruddy face was dead pale, but her gaze relaxed with maternal affection when she saw Harry. Draco stepped aside to let her catch Harry in one of the warmest hugs he had ever seen, only to suppress a squawk when her arm shot out and dragged him in with him.
Lockhart spoke of Sade in the past tense. It seemed he knew of the brutal death Sade had met, at the hands of the Bruixots de Sang. But from the dozen and a half dark purple-red fang marks that littered Lockhart's throat and wrists, those just where Draco could
"I'm sure that's true," Lockhart said, puffing himself up. "There must be a reason the man's never gotten the Defense job, and Dumbledore's had him stick to Potions."
doing here?" It would have been hard to tell if he meant Ron or Dobby, had his gaze not turned towards the latter.
The room seemed already to be spinning around him. Even though when he looked at the only real distinct break in the blackness, the blue candles, they were unmoving. He could hear distant crashes and screams, but he could not make sense of any direction or which door. He felt lost and impotent, remembering the last sight he'd had of any of them: Luna's adorable face slicing open... It hovered before his mind's eye for a paralyzed moment, mixing with his mother's pale tortured face until he remembered Harry's ring.
"No, no," Potter said, waving his arms all flustered, and made himself look very suspicious to an ornery Filch checking them for permission to head out of the entrance hall. "No, you look, um..."
"Easy. I'm kind to those who deserve kindness, and cruel to those who deserve cruelty." It was like a trick question.
Luna waved her wand to make the stubby candles around them burn brighter. Which was a mistake, as it further highlighted the composition of the floor. It looked like one of those enchanted swamps the Weasleys were working on. But Draco's feet didn't sink into it like quicksand as he had feared. It just seemed liable to ruin his fifth-best leather shoes.
You must stop these letters and presents. They are unasked for and unneeded. We cannot be together again, no matter what new arguments you try and assail my conscience with, clever boy. My conscience is clear on this point. It is not safe for you to be near me anymore.
Draco followed the figures before Severus did, predicting the memory would take him there. The woman was familiar-looking, but it was only her clothes that let Draco place her as a younger Madam Pomfrey, the sheen and smoothness of her hair different but not the garb. Draco's first assumption was that the boy beside her was Sirius Black. But he had lighter hair than the raving lunatic on the Prophet covers, and so much more of a mild diffident face and air to him, it was hard to think even decades could transform the boy beside Madam Pomfrey to the Prisoner of Azkaban. Though he did look about Severus's age, and wore a Gryffindor tie.
Griphook shot them a suspicious stare, before pressing his hand to the vault to open it. "Did you know," Draco said brightly by way of distraction, "Harry once fought a dragon? A Hungarian Horntail, not an Ukrainian Ironbelly like this one. It was in the-"
The telephone box took them into the ground like a Muggle lift, the voice wishing them a pleasant day. Harry looked awed by the dark wood and blue ceiling of the Ministry, the Floo ports, and even the large fountain. "Stop gaping, it's embarrassing," Draco hissed in his ear. "Everyone will be staring at you, because you're Harry Potter. You don't want them to see you looking like some yokel tourist seeing the Bruixots de Sang in Barcelona for the first time, do you? Especially not for the Fountain of Magical Brethren. Ugh."
So Draco knew that Black was enemies with Bellatrix and an outcast from that family, but no one had ever given Draco any more information than that, and he'd had more worries that summer than a dead man. Namely men he was supposed to
I've turned all the girls to Squibs- but even if it had, they agreed it was preferable to keeping them in place..."
Harry collected himself enough to get a bit of a smirk back, though that face on him was always a cute one. "Oh, so this is a date?"
It was Monday that week, when Draco failed to turn in any sort of essay on Dementors, and Severus chewed him out in front of their entire Defense class. Draco just sat back and tapped his foot, though Harry's worried stare did give him pause. In the end, all Severus could do was give him detention, and all Harry could do was keep worrying. Draco skipped the detention, and put Harry on the back burner.
The table came to a hush before breakfast finished, even Peter's indignant prattle faltering, as Draco joined Ron in retelling the story of how his 'cousin' Luna Lovegood had been enchanted and taken down into the Chamber instead of Ginny. Draco thought himself gracious playing up Ron's share of heroism, claiming Ron had distracted the Basilisk with his rooster calls, when at best he had only mildly confused it.
"It was all a lie, wasn't it," Draco said with a start. "Needing to help more with the citadel's reconstruction, that was just an excuse to get Severus here, to research, once he found out the place could be
"Oh, did he bring you and Anthony Goldstein food too? In the Room of Requirement?" Harry delivered this fact like he had uncovered some great secret. When Draco just blinked, he grimaced. "Don't lie to me. I saw the two of you on the map, going to the seventh floor and disappearing."
Apparently Dumbledore had said Severus was a Death Eater who had turned sides before Voldemort fell, and had been a spy subsequently. That wasn't news to Draco, but it had been to the others. And Harry must have questioned it to Dumbledore, because Hermione said Dumbledore had repeated the same assertion of his faith in Severus to Harry that afternoon.
The bad news was, the words didn't seem to be coming out of the wood anytime soon, despite a number of attempts by both students and professors. The good news was, it gave Draco his own seat at Slytherin. For some reason, no one else seemed to want to sit there.
"I am very glad you're not dead. And I hope you've gotten the answers you wanted. But if you were successful, that means- there
He rested for a moment after, while the Potter in the mirror pushed a stray broomstick back into the rack without taking his eyes off Draco once. Draco was grateful to Father and Severus and even Aunt Bella for every spell that came to his mind to blast at that face. "Aqua eructo!" The jet of water that expelled from Draco's wand wasn't swallowed this time, though the water seemed only to pool out over Draco's feet, and not the soon pristine-again surface of the mirror.
, except memories. And he'd already changed them. He should have known when Granger started sitting at his table, when Longbottom's cauldron didn't melt- when he'd ordered Dobby to disobey his Father, and found Aunt Bella's wand in his hand. The wand was proof of the malleability of his memory, and of the power he had been granted. He had thought himself unsuited to making even the most basic decisions, and now so many were thrust into his hands, he might as well have had none at all.
"Draco?" his mother's voice called up. "Draco, this is the last day we can go to Ollivander's! You'll be back on the train tomorrow! Draco, are you coming?"
"You can, dragon," Harry agreed, voice hitching. When his fingers went to pull off Draco's shirt and jumper, Draco let him, hands going for Harry's clothes too. He kissed Harry after each thing taken off, each bit more of bare skin melting against each other's with another press of their lips.
"Finite incantatem," Severus cast, ending the jinxes on the students each in turn, with the awful laughter that had afflicted both Potter and Draco sliding to a holt. The air above them was green with smoke, which made Draco inclined to suspect a Slytherin behind it. Longbottom and a Hufflepuff were on the ground, Finnigan was rubbing his stomach where a similarly successful Tickling Jinx from Ron seemed to have felled him completely. The two first-year girls who'd been unable to find a partner in their own houses, Girl Weasley and Lovegood, had seemed to manage to cast nothing at each other but tufts of smoke, while the pair of girls beside them were a different story. Hermione was down on the ground with Pansy jabbing her wand in her face, having cast Salazar knew what. It only took Draco calling out Pansy's name, though, to make her back off.
Whereas Draco had transfigured some of the beads on Imoogi's original necklace, along with wood chipped from his bed and pieces of pipes and metal purloined from the Slytherin bathroom, into tiny crystals instead of diamonds, and African turquoises instead of the opals. But the effect of it didn't strike him as too different, not after he mottled the turquoises and used his wand to carefully carve one to a charm like his mother's instead of just a sphere. And turquoises were supposed to be stones that gave mental clarity, so that fit Granger.
The passage through Gringotts was familiar, caves and dragons that had used to fascinate Draco as a child, now mere background to Harry's furious face, pulling him close to whisper in his ear, "What the hell have you gotten me into?"
Her face paled as she realized. "Maybe about seven in the evening," she said weakly, and let go of him.
make, theoretically? For the right amount of money, under the table?" Draco persisted, wondering how long it might take for Umbridge to make another. Except hopefully, if it was her own invention, she would blame the burning on a problem in the magic, and give up the concept. But she seemed to have connected the burn's shape with Draco. Maybe she would give up on it then anyway, if she thought it too liable to be hijacked by another's magic... "How would you go about making it? How long do you think it would take?"
He was only startled out of self-pity when he heard brash Gryffindor voices approaching, and he had to snatch up his wand and pull himself behind a snowbank. It seemed unlikely that Potter and his quartet of Weasleys would have noticed Draco, though, as they launched into a snowball fight that filled the air with hurtling clouds of white. Even the prefect had joined them, and even he abstained from using magic, instead choosing to freeze his hands through his cheap poorly-made knit gloves by throwing like a Muggle. Draco remembered balls of snow hitting him out of nowhere one year in Hogsmeade, an incident he hadn't put in his notebooks. It must have been before he knew about Potter's invisibility cloak, or surely he would have guessed what was happening. Figured that the Weasleys would have taught Potter that special talent.
in dark magic, I can assure you without any doubt, that there is no way to willfully stop yourself from caring about someone, magical or otherwise. Even if they do happen to be a Gryffindor, this object of one's affection," he added, lip twisting, "Which you would expect, whichever cruel gods govern the laws of magic, to have them admit to be awful enough to permit an exception to their rules on such grounds."
Okay, so one of his goals for the year had been no more blood magic rituals, and he'd broken it before the first week of classes was out
Luna got that darkness in her pale eyes for a moment that mention of Tom always seemed to put there, before she put on her usual false cheerfulness. "Tom didn't corrupt me," she said brightly. "He educated me and expanded my mind. And made me a murder puppet, but no one's perfect."
"It's Mr. Wilberforth," Pansy said, closing the flap hurriedly. "Millie's cat. Or I mean, it's Mr. Wilberforth's carrying case. You know how that cat can be, how many times it's slipped away at King's Cross, so this year she got a reinforced case with all kinds of spells. And I've borrowed it, because it was Mr. Wilberforth who found him, out behind the gamekeeper's hut. Millie and I were chasing him, and we found him menacing the ugly thing. She wanted to just let him eat him, but I said we couldn't, and had her get the case, so here... look inside, but be careful, he's vicious..."
"No need to talk me into it this time," he agreed. "No cousin of a Malfoy is going to die somewhere whose entrance is a
"After Luna's mirror failed to deliver Sculptor his dream of Estella reborn, he left the house of Eros. Sculptor took his own life soon after, throwing himself into the river where a bridge had once taken him high over the grasp of Death. But the river was swollen over the banks, so Sculptor's body was not found for some time. Before then, Pavo was the only remaining of the brothers, in this world
"Yes," Draco said, in a lie that felt true. "Yes, I wanted to find the Resurrection Stone with Grindelwald's help, so I could bring back Mr. Nott, and make things with Theo- I know they'd never be right again, not even with that. But so- so I could give Theo his life back. Make him Theo again. He's like a shade of himself. He's- he's a good Death Eater, isn't he? He'll do well... the perfect little dark wizard, he can already brag about Grindelwald to Voldemort..."
"The Sword of Gryffindor," Potter said sharply, and half-tossed the sword, loosening and tensing his grip again before it dropped. "Ever heard of it? Not as flashy as Slytherin's Basilisk. But it did the job."
Draco nodded along, feeling more like an imposter than he had since that first week in his old body at the Manor. She smiled and squeezed his free hand. "From what she's told us, she had some trouble fitting in at first at Hogwarts. Even with Harry and Ron at the start of first-year. You're the only one who was her friend right from the start, even though your family is so different than ours. You've really helped her come out of her shell and become more confident."
it!" Theo protested. "I was trying to say what I thought would hurt him the most! He started it! Draco and I were just talking about the game, and he showed up-"
"Neville would never," she sighed, smile faltering. "I don't even think he really likes me that way. I'm not sexy like that. Not like you-"
"Yes! He seduced me!" Lockhart exclaimed, the first hint of his old dramatic side coming back, with the plaintive way he threw his hands in the air. "I was enthralled, but not by enchantment! By
"Did you see me kick Dean?" Luna was asking Neville excitedly in the background, while Neville seemed to lack the nerve to explain to Luna that she shouldn't exactly be proud of kicking shins instead of the football. Seamus had taken some of the ice from Neville's cup and made an ice pack for Dean, rolling down Dean's sock and holding it to his calf, but Dean hardly seemed to feel it, gloating there in his dirt and grass-covered West Ham shirt to his exhausted friend.
Draco felt a tug, like the pull of Avenseguim activated. He wondered if Harry had come to find him. He'd last cast the spell on the golden ring before the Third Task, naively thinking that even if Harry did end up kidnapped, there was no way Draco would be with him. He hadn't activated it himself, and he didn't think Harry would be wearing it. He hadn't seen it on his hand once since the graveyard. But he thought the pull might be Harry, so he followed. Even when he saw that it was leading him towards a closed ward, and he had to spell the doors open, he followed.
"No, no," Grindelwald laughed, swatting a hand playfully through the air, as if all of this was child's play, purely intuitive. "There is a Muggle term- see, I am well-versed in the works of those such as Freud, whatever you think of my believes on Muggles- known as
His thoughts were rambling and undisciplined as he picked his way out of the cellars, looking around for any sign of his mother or house elves to give away his newest small sin of passing out down here. He was lucky enough not be hungover or even feel stiffness in his limbs from sleeping on stone, but his luck ran out on avoiding elves by the time he had climbed the stairs into the house and come face to face-
Draco was left in the sculpture garden, the talon wand almost seeming to purr displeased as he put it back in his pocket. He hadn't let loose any of the dams on its power, nor leaned into any spells, not like he would have thought he'd need to with the likes of the mysterious Periander. If the assessor could defeat or fake death, one would have thought him more accomplished in merely dueling, but it
He laughed at Theo's expression before pulling him in, drawing the curtains shut and casting Muffliato and Spelunca secure. Theo kicked off his shoes with instinctive politeness, looking nearly as awkward to be trapped here as he had in second year, when it had been Harry Potter behind that aloof aristocratic face.
But if Draco took Dumbledore down, what would that do to the blue loop? He had been lacerating himself for changes that worsened things- what would it do, to sever Harry Potter from Dumbledore's plans and guidance, from the
"Only," Severus corrected mildly, "Unwittingly so. You try to conceal, but against your own judgment, you reveal all your treasures. So answer the question, Gilderoy. Why?"
Draco kept a close eye on the time as he began hastily at the Transfiguration, thinking he could finish it before the hour got too late, but he was nowhere near the picture in his mind by the time all the other boys were in bed. He barricaded himself behind more charms than usual and stayed up sitting with Imoogi over the necklace turned bracelet and his first-year Transfiguration textbook, which proved absolutely useless. "No good, huh?" he told Imoogi, before firmly telling himself to stop talking to a stuffed dragon, and sneaking out from his personal cocoon over to Theo's bed. Sure enough, Theo had some more advanced Transfiguration texts inside his trunk, and it was a ridiculous surge of triumph to successfully summon the trunk to him in silence, extract the books he wanted, and slide it back in place with his wand unnoticed.
"Around my brother," Aberforth said grimly, "You'd be far better off saying Voldemort's name. The Order has been using the passage into Hogwarts, and-"
Dantanian could not be said not to have made an effort. The question was whether that was a good thing. He had been virtually incognito in fourth year, remarkable only for shabbiness and the length of his hair. But his time, he proudly escorted Lamia to the top of the stairs.
accept you as a student," Flitwick frowned. "And although Firenze is taking some of the Divination classes this year, Professor Trelawney is the one teaching the sixth-years- oh, and you are banned from the Divination Tower?"
it!" Their gazes were lit with flame together, green flame leaking through sterile silver cold. "I wish we could tell Blaise-"
"Draco," Potter said, making a clear effort to sound the reasonable one, "Why did you get me a music box that kills plants?"
Draco shrunk back across the floor, no one but him and Aunt Bella in the room anymore, no room anymore except for somewhere in Malfoy Manor, and maybe down in the cellars, from this cold deeper than Dementors, fouler than the breath of Fenrir Greyback, meaner than the vacant stare in Voldemort's cold unfeeling snake eyes, the cold that cut into his mind, tearing out secret after secret because it was supposed to, because he had to be frozen from the inside out to be anything at all, he had to
He closed his eyes and tried to brace himself for the next strike, only for it to hit hard enough to send him face-first into the stone, where he found himself vomiting, retching out nothing much but bile- he hadn't eaten since the morning- on stones so much like he remembered watching the brandy he had poured out for Vince pooling golden over, flowing smooth and hypnotizing and a world away from these helpless expulsions corroding each time through all his lungs, burning at his chest and throat. The acid was as strong as if the very liquids in his body had been cursed and turned on him. He didn't know why it hurt so much. He sobbed and vomited and Father raised his walking stick over him again, and maybe if he was a different person, he would have reached for his wand. Maybe he should have. But he didn't. He just cowered on the ground and prayed for it to be over.
"Not even Albus? With your confession or not... if you've been his student for this many years, and have ties to the Boy Who Lived... how could he
Knowing what Draco knew, he had a suspicion it might be profane. Remus looked curious, as if he didn't actually know. His face broke into a giddy and very young-looking smile as Sirius told him, "'This isn't just anyone. This is Remus. So you'd better not fuck this up.' And I did, and I probably will again, but I'm going to try, because you're
die, or you will lose someone you loved enough to once prefer their life to your own. Oh, poor boy. I will try and help you to understand this."
But he would never betray Hermione. That was his rock, his only cornerstone. They remained on the same side, waiting to hear from Black, and waiting.
you to get back with Luna," Draco said impatiently, at the risk of seeming a meddler. First Lockhart and now this, like Draco knew where everyone belonged and what everyone deserved. But acting to protect those nine names wasn't just about recruiting protectors, or even inventing curses. It was also about giving those nine names something more to fight for. "You're my friend too, Neville, and you've been miserable since she dumped you-"
He got to witness a truly spectacular screaming match between Mother and Father then, alternating between caressing his wand he now kept exclusively in his pajama bottom's side pocket, and half-heartedly shoving rosemary lamb into his mouth, one of his favorite meals turned tasteless.
As Draco flew out of the Chamber of Secrets, he threw the liquid Fiendfyre behind him. It shattered over the bodies and consumed them, but he didn't turn back.
"Neil Palmer," Dantanian said, voice in something of a daze. He picked up the newspaper in its carefully laid preserving plastic, ensured he had dislodged none of the plastic, and then took it along with himself to the furthermost corner of the library. Lamia followed out of curiosity, settling beside him where he sat at the very dregs of the History of Magic section, under tomes about fourteenth-century wizarding skirmishes in Anatolia. "Neil Palmer," he repeated, and let Lamia take the paper from him. She gave him a tense look and cast a dictation charm.
"What?" Harry demanded, eyes glinting hot and almost wet. His shoulders were all tensed up, holding his breath, and he had looked less frightened facing the Dark Lord. "What is it?"
Draco cried out, and Grindelwald eyed him with a grandfatherly dubiousness. "Really, what is this show of morality? So blasé before, and now you grow squeamish?"
"Of course," Sirius said proudly, "Everyone is invited. We'll find a way to make it safe, whatever the Death Eaters claim. Snape is overreacting. If Dumbledore says it's safe, it's safe. Don't worry, Harry, the whole Order will be there-"
"Finestra maxima," Draco snarled. He had to try there times before there was any effect. But on that third try, he saw the light erupt from his wand and spark in the glass before it shattered it. Except there was only the sound of a mirror breaking, sight of light splintering across the surface in patterns of cracks like sparks disappearing underwater, without anything falling from a surface as smooth as an undisturbed lake.
"Oh, alright," said Neville, turning redder, and leaned down and gave Luna a peck on the lips, with a self-conscious look over at Harry and Draco. Luna settled back in her seat with a small cute pout, which deepened when Neville sat beside Harry instead of her.
His planning really had suffered, it turned out, when it came to academics. Not only was he severely behind in all of his classwork, after disinterest and outright missing a month, his memory of anything regarding memorization and dates was the worst of his Hogwarts years. No wonder, given the greater interval of time, as well as his greater distraction this year in the blue loop. Unfortunate, though, given that the work was now NEWT-level, meaning anything beyond practical and spellwork seemed outside his usual intuitive grasp. Some classes, he'd simply stopped trying. After all, he'd never had to face sixth-year
Sirius's voice broke on the last words, and Draco stepped forward and hugged him as hard as he could. "I'm sorry," he gasped, burying his face in Sirius's shoulder. He could feel Remus join them, hugging them both. "I'm so sorry. You're right. You're right. I'll go back to Hogwarts. I'm not tired anymore. I'll go back. I'm sorry."
Draco hadn't wanted to laugh, but that forced it out of him, deep from his stomach, derisive and mocking. If it sounded a bit like Aunt Bella, well, he had spent an excess of time with her in his formative years. "Are you serious? That's pathetic. You don't need the Resurrection Stone to make Inferi. And even if you did, what a waste of time. I'm surprised Grindelwald would waste his time with that. He should have been too powerful, even at that age, to ever need them." Draco tilted his head, and made himself the very picture of Grindelwald reborn, as he drawled, "I know
Dorian's friends in the crowd nodded and made agreeing noises, enthusiastic in their resentment. It sounded as though Dantanian must have been immoderate in class, demonstrating his command over fire. It must have rubbed many wizards of more illustrious bloodlines wrong, to be 'shown up', as Dorian had at least had the grace to openly put it, by a mere quiet 'Muggleborn'. For his part, Dantanian did not seem inclined to explain that actually, in this case, Incendio as a charm might even be superfluous for him, as a blood-born pyromancer.
"Why did you have to keep yelling to him again?" Ron groaned. Draco flicked his wand and rolled Ron right back over, wiggling his eyebrows and making a silly face to mollify him. Potter looked sullen to be the only one to have to roll himself back. He ended up closer to Draco's feet, with Hermione by his head and Ron by his side. He sat up anyway, pushing up his glasses, with a flash of green eyes behind them that made the thought Draco was about to sleep near him suddenly seem fraught with more than a question of protectedness
"I didn't mean to," Black began. Thinking of the words seemed a real effort, let alone forcing them out. "I thought of it as- it was like it was just another prank. A clever way to scare you and get you to leave Remus alone. It never entered my head you might die."
The Slytherins and a fair number of the Ravenclaws broke into laughter. Harry, being Harry, did not shrink back, but stiffened up straighter at that. He glared at Severus to show he wasn't intimidated. Even if he didn't offer a retort. That might just have been because he couldn't think of one.
"I don't get it," said Ron. "Why would he be that angry? So Draco will have a bit more of an edge in Quidditch, so what? He had a Nimbus 2001 before, that's not that much worse, and anyway, we've already got playing Slytherin over with..."
that, Draco? Don't you care about becoming an Unspeakable anymore? It's like you're- I don't know, self-destructive! It's like you've just stopping caring about what happens to you!"
"What's that," Draco sighed, and both her hands shook where they were holding onto the chain, clinging so hard all her knuckles were white.
Miss Alba holds hands with her friend as they speak of their ordeal. "It came out in the middle, and we all had to swim. It was very cold. Paula and our friend Núria nearly drowned, and Gilderoy swam them on his back to the shore. Then he cast spells to warm us all. It took us days to make it down to the town of Lleida. We were all so exhausted we could barely walk. Sometimes we had to carry each other down the steep bluffs. The vampires were on our trail the whole time, but when one caught us, Gilderoy used the Obliviate spell and stole the memory of finding us."
, do you know that? I'm just better at hiding it. And I'm depressed and miserable, and honestly pretty reckless and violent, and generally fucked up beyond repair, so bad my own parents don't want me anymore-"
"I would never have been on their side if I could help it. I still don't care a thing about blood supremacy. But I didn't have a choice. I couldn't let what you did go. I'll never-" Theo's voice threatened to break before he recaptured it, impassivity more of a facade when he spoke of his father. "I'll never betray my father again. I swear it. By Hecate, by my magic, by any god that's real, I swear it."
"Okay," Harry said, and then reached out and smoothed Draco's hair out of his face, showing where his focus was perhaps being stolen. "I'm sorry. I just..."
Dobby had outdone himself with the cake, a massive tower of red velvet and cheesecake buttercream that even two dozen attendees couldn't put much of a dent into. Dobby put a fair dent in himself, sitting with Luna and Draco and chattering happily, although the absence of Wooky and Nissy was noticeable to anyone in the know.
didn't? I thought you were the one who knew the most about him! I thought he'd have told you! He expects you to die for him, and he never even told you about
He must have fallen asleep, because he had to be shaken awake by Severus, asking him if he had packed. By then, Karkaroff was nowhere in sight. On the way down the stairs after he got dressed, Severus explained that Father had taken Karkaroff away, but had still agreed upon Mother's insistence to let Draco return to Hogwarts that night.
One item robbed from the Manor that proved more successful was the dragon decal. Its presence baffled his dormmates. The thing seemed to have taken a particular dislike to Blaise, sending the non-deadly flames his way at any opportunity. It was a constant reminder of Dobby's impending birthday, so Draco eventually ordered a box big enough to put it in and wrap, invited the Gryffindor trio and Luna, and planned a surprise party. He invited Harry through Hermione.
"I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower," said Professor McGonagall heavily. "I need to address the students in any case." She turned to Draco, and lay a hand on his shoulder as well. "Mr. Malfoy, chin up. Miss Granger is only petrified. We will have her back again, I promise. I will send for your Head of House to escort you back as well." She began to walk off, only to stop when Ron and Potter didn't immediately follow. "Gentlemen?"
"Then, when she was fourteen... see, I wasn't there. If I'd been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn't as young as she was, and... it was an accident. Ariana couldn't control it. But my mother was killed."
It was and then some. "So is Theo still being sketch with Astoria?" Ginny was asking. From Millie's lack of offense at the question, it was not their first time gossiping. "Did he call her a different name again?"
"Yeah," Draco said, with a slow smile. "Yeah, Luna. I think you can grow up to be dangerous." Then his smile faltered, as he remembered when he'd cast Protego Diabolica, and the sight of Harry Potter walking into blue fire once again filled his chest with an acidic, rueful sort of pain. "But you know, you'll never be as dangerous as me."
Father was spitting mad as they made their way out of the stadium, into the woods along the lantern-lit path. Mother headed towards the Apparition point like last time, and Father directed Draco to follow her, unlike in the blue loop, where he'd told Draco to wait in the woods for him. Draco didn't know whether that was lack of faith in Draco's ability to stay out of the conflict this time, with his manifestly divided loyalties, or just punishment for the comeuppance he'd served the Minister. Draco just smirked, nodding obediently, and had every intention of obeying.
"Like I said," Hermione sighed, "Not everyone thinks like you. If we look at it from probability, based on their magical abilities and what they might have been casting, it's a dead wash too. Grindelwald and Professor Dumbledore were both very powerful, far more than Aberforth. That might mean their magic would be more likely to kill. But Aberforth also would have had less
Draco stared, and then slowly, as if in a dream, traced his fingers down Harry's tense back- just a trace, before he let the touch fall away. "It's something I never could."
"He said you'd already worked out methods for that," Draco said, rolling his eyes. "And-" He steeled himself, though he was not the one about to be hurt, and waited until they had climbed out of the secret library before he broke the news. Gilderoy hurried to fluff some pillows and set them in Draco's chair before he sat. "It's not a portal, Gilderoy. It's an enchanted mirror. An important one, which I need you to keep secret from everyone. I mean
"Luna!" Draco called, running over in defiance of the sheets of rain between them. "Luna, your hat! Merlin, Luna, your hat!"
"What?" Draco breathed, and dropped down to hug his cousin's other side. "You were so excited about your date! You got all dressed up!" Luna was still in the flowy pink and blue dress he had helped her pick, but she'd taken her hair out of the complicated updo they'd done. It hung limply in its great mass around her, looking as glum as Luna. "How could he do that to you?"
"You have someone in your head already," Draco offered logically. "It's just a question of whether you want it to be me or the Dark Lord rummaging around up there."
in the House of Black! Animals, eyes unfit to see the wizard Yuletide!" Kreacher stalked into the room and snapped his fingers, sending the Christmas tree sideways. Ornaments cracked and flew about, Mrs. Granger leaping aside to keep from getting hit. Kreacher snapped his fingers again, and the new painting of London and the Arsenal flag fell down. "Muggle excrement and contamination on the walls! Kreacher will not suffer it! KREACHER WILL NOT!"
"Don't look at me like that," Theo laughed, although he flinched aside a little as the Basilisk's rotted tongue flicked out beside his hand. The full coiled fifty feet of the beast shifted behind him, prepared to move at his command. "It was your idea. And I found the way in your book. Thank you, Draco. It's all thanks to you, from start to finish. Now. My Kingsnake." Theo closed his eyes a long moment, as if even now he had to work to get out the words, but come out they did all the same. "Kill him for me."
"No!" Draco exclaimed. "I just- I don't know what to say. I'm glad you care so much. That makes me happy." He put a hand over his mouth. "It just- it didn't seem like a big deal to me after a while. I've always known Theo wanted me dead for what I did. It was just obvious. And it was right he did-""Did you mean to
. "Yeah," Draco said uncomfortably, "And Voldemort broke the protective circle with one spell, I don't even know how, so it's not actually much to write home about..."
"In any rate, it's done," Draco cut in cheerfully. "He's stuck at Citadelle Xaphan regardless. He won't be any bother to you. So it's just in
to be cursed." Draco hugged her around the middle, resting his chin on her shoulder. She took his affection with a smile, though when she unfolded the note, she had a contemplative look. "Shall I read it to you?"
Draco shrugged, refusing to let himself or Luna wilt under the pressure of a gorgeous, inexplicably distraught Potter, who had abandoned his date as if she'd vanished into thin air. "It may be unusual, Potter," he drawled, "But you can't say it doesn't
He was held up on his way back to the Slytherin common room, though, by the presence of someone waiting for him on the bottom of the steps. "Theo?" Draco frowned, startled at the sight of Theo in his Kingsnakes hoodie and black jeans with his dirty blond hair all mussed, and pale face flushed from alcohol, an open bottle of what looked to be sake in hand.
"I recognized it," Lupin said quietly, "After your first Defense class. Naturally, I raised concerns with the headmaster, but he told me you are bound magically to this wand, and none other will function for you."
When Harry asked if it hurt, Draco lied and said it didn't. It didn't really, the blunt ache of being stretched wider and wider almost imperceptible, compared to the satisfaction of that stretch, that warmth permeating, pressure driving deeper inside to where he needed it. An itch he just couldn't scratch by himself, taken in hand by someone else. "Put it all in," Draco whined, not caring how shameless and debased he must seem in Harry's eyes. "I want to feel all of you. Wanna feel how big you are- want you so bad..."
..." He began to breathe hard, tears instantly springing to his eyes and leaking down as the memory of Aunt Bella's Cruciatus swept through him, aftershocks spasming at his fingertips. "No, no, no, no..."
Percy Weasley, coming up to take his place near Fudge's side, did a double and then a triple-take at the watch. So did a number of the press and the Wizengamot, recognizing the custom piece that Fudge had worn daily for years. Fudge himself nearly lost his balance in front of everyone from jumping so angrily to his feet. But he could only stand there impotently, at the spectacle of the prisoner he wanted to condemn, flaunting his own trademark at him.
"If you didn't want people to know the Heir of Slytherin had returned," Blaise asked slowly, "Why did you write it up on that wall?"
!" Draco yelled, own temper snapping like a rubber band. "I'm judging the Order of the fucking Phoenix! I'm judging everyone who's fine sending you off to get tortured for them and still treats you like an outsider! Haven't you suffered enough-"
Draco couldn't resist sticking out his own tongue to lick one out of the air. Then he cast guilty warming charms on them all. "Well, we can only get poisoned and die once."
"You wouldn't tell on him, though," Harry said with a newly miserable sort of confidence. "Don't try to scare me. I know about the two of you. I've seen the rings Draco's making the two of you, the ones he doesn't want anyone to know about."
"I don't have the time right now," Draco sighed. "I think we've hit a dead end. But I'll try and do some more research over the summer..."
"Her name, though," Draco mused, "Is it just Maledictum, after the Latin for curse, or could this creature be a
"Now, then, Draco," Dumbledore said, resuming his seat behind his desk. "What is it that is so urgent for us to see?"
"All of it?" Severus said doubtfully, then opened the notebook and began to flip through, with what seemed an alarmingly flippant approach to contents that at least should be making Severus question his godson's sanity. Finally, he stopped on a page and read aloud, droll and unimpressed. Draco was filled with unspeakable relief before he registered what Severus was reading. "'Showed Finnigan what becomes of tongues that speak ill of Draco Malfoy.' What is this, Draco, your Christmas confession? Will you be disappointed if I do not make the effort to feign surprise?"
Mud clung to Draco's elbows as he pulled himself up, pushing leaves and twigs from his eyes as his gaze went instantly to see if the others were safe. The Nimbus was at least, the sleek black length of it gleaming intact as ever in the filtered moonlight, but the same could not be said of Severus's school broom, only one half of which had even fallen all the way down with them, the rest presumably still trapped up in the trees.
It was a hospital wing study session then, as all the academic help that they hadn't been giving Potter and Ron was compressed into one evening, to ensure Potter didn't have to stay with the Dursleys forever, and Molly Weasley didn't hang Ron from the top of the Burrow and set him on fire. "What?" Draco asked, in response to the Gryffindors' shocked looks, "She might," and Ron looked likely to vomit on Draco's hospital bed. "Don't worry, Ron, it's
Hermione caved as expected, and for once was the one to advise secrecy about it with their friends beside Harry, who they needed the map from. "They'll want to help," she sighed, "You know Luna definitely will, and just get in the way. But never tell them I said that!" Draco nodded, very much in agreement.
you recognize it, Professor?" Draco asked, unable to keep a nasty edge from his voice, and Remus sighed.
Harry rolled them over, flipping Draco on his back and leaving him a bit winded. Harry didn't mind Draco on his lap, but when they were lying down like this, he always seemed to like to be the one on top, as if winning a fistfight, always clear who was in control. "Don't," Draco gasped, "Leave any marks, or... make sure you remember to remind me, so I can... mmm, spell them away,
"Exactly," Seguinus hissed, the dark glimmer in his lovely eyes more sinister for a moment. Not long enough, though, for the eye not to question whether it had seen it at all, on the face of such a sweet and kind man. "Immersion in aigua infernal robs a human wizard of his magic, once and for all. There is no reversal, no appeal, no authority or power in the world to restore what has been lost. Even Death. Even
Draco sent off notes to Hermione and Luna cancelling all their plans, and then snuck out of Hogwarts into Hogsmeade to find Padfoot. He'd feared he wouldn't locate Padfoot, and he'd have to leave a coded message in their usual appointed gutter, but he came upon Padfoot in person within minutes. He took it as a good omen, and urged Padfoot not to bother finding somewhere he could change back to human for them to talk, because he couldn't stay for long.
Each time Draco presented Madam Pince with Severus's note for the Restricted Section, she looked more and more unhappy about letting him in, like he was exactly the kind of student who shouldn't be allowed there. But he decided to stretch out the visits anyway. He persisted as if he didn't see the looks she gave him, taking out only one book per session, and spending as much time as he could reading other books while inside the section. After all, Severus hadn't specified how much time he could spend there "looking for" his books.
"Tell me," Father said tightly, after a wand of holly and phoenix feather was as impotent in Draco's hand as the rest, "That my son, my only son and heir, is not a Squib." He cast a sharp glance to Mother, who darted to secure the perimeter against potential observers, for what Draco's parents seemed to be preparing to face as one of the greatest-ever shames to the name of Malfoy.
They had a Valerian root tea on Saturday morning with Severus, which he agreed to serve Hermione as well, on the grounds that Draco would whine for days if he did not. Otherwise, they did nothing but revision. Except it seemed like half the population of Gryffindor Tower mobbed Draco on Sunday night begging for help with Potions revisions. And he obliged, offering the most soothing platitudes he could think of to Neville, all while inwardly fearing he didn't have a prayer.
At least, he told Dobby, he was teaching the elf basic research skills. "Just think, Dobby," Draco would tell him wearily. "You'll be better at researching than Hermione soon. Wouldn't she just love that?"
Grindelwald nodded in acknowledgment to Draco, then his gaze went back with fierce, almost longing intensity towards the moonstones, and perhaps the concentrated power and danger they embodied. They would need to keep an eye on that urge in the dark wizard, to be sure. And his reckless curiosity, to immediately walk amongst the stones towards the circle's center.
"Don't worry. I'm in control of the fire." Dantanian walked forward, flames leaping a bit with each time his foot hit wooden floors that somehow did not burn. "Remember, I gave you the chance. You could have just let me take the paintings.
"I have what I took from Aunt Bella, though," Draco blurted, and it was true. He had more gold than he knew what to do with, just sitting around Grimmauld, stolen but no less useful.
"I was told he was the most advanced student in his year by far. I wanted to give him the chance to succeed, just like everyone else, and I expected he would succeed-"
He didn't elaborate, but he didn't need to. If he'd played the victim card, so to speak, at least he'd played it too well for Draco not to at least stop and take notice of his point.
"Draco, perhaps you might put away your wand- or- the blade- or, um, not point them at your godfather so, er, energetically-"
He turned back to Draco, with a look more bemused than gloating. "Didn't you ever wonder how I knew about your trips to Nurmengard? Dobby's old friends followed him every time. It's actually not hard, for house elves to follow each other's Apparition trails. They got me in to eavesdrop, the day you broke out Grindelwald. I thought you might have assumed already, from how much time I spent with Pansy. She's the one who convinced them to help me, so they could find a new household to serve."
Severus at least would have been more coherent than Hagrid in his criticisms. Hagrid's proceeded naturally from the perspective of considering Potter's feelings, droning on about
So the Gryffindors ended up facing no consequences for their impromptu sleepover, thanks to Severus's apparent guilt, as if getting his godson nearly killed could be made up for by not giving his friends detention. But hey, it was better than still
"Mr. Potter," Scrimgeour said, facade of paternal helpfulness falling. "This spite is extraordinary. Try and control your temper-"
For the pity that had been on his face as he waited for Draco and his mother at the door of the courtroom afterwards, not even seeming to notice all the stares on him. He'd just handed Draco back his wand without a word.
Draco had always heard that the way time travel worked was that the past was unchangeable. That there was only one timeline in actuality, two ends of a string folded to meld together and make one as if they had never been disparate. All the changes the time traveler made in their trip had already happened in their own past. There was never any change to events that the traveler apprehended as past.
"Because I'm angry, you pillock!" Draco screamed, and drove both fists against the glass, shaking physically with rage. That gorgeous face was just making him more frustrated, in every way imaginable. Being near Harry, sharing friends with him, a school, a cousin, an
"Harry, what's going on?" Remus asked. Harry got an evasive look on his face, turning to stare at the Christmas tree instead, a faded blue-green decorated all in golden baubles and red and gold lights. The glow of the lights off Harry's face showed the strain there all too well. Harry's scarlet pajamas were stiff with dry sweat, like he'd been woken not by McGonagall but a nightmare.
"Alright," said Neville, and then took a deep breath, with the belief in his eyes that he was going to die, and said, "Luna, I-"
Dantanian Noir." Severus looked unwittingly pleased to draw a shaky laugh, for what he hadn't meant to be a bon mot. "You would have had means to support yourself, if not reach the levels of wealth and fame you-"
Draco laughed himself sick the first time he heard what happened with Millie's cat. "It's not funny!" Hermione kept insisting.
"Listen," Draco said heavily, "I know I changed a lot, okay? I know I've been a different person at Hogwarts than I was before it. But I had to be, after I got this wand." He took the risk of drawing it and panicking them, but they all seemed to understand. Theo knew more about it than the others, but their gazes all went just as grave as his. "You all know whose it is. What it's done. Of course getting this wand changed me. It picked me and I couldn't get rid of it. I couldn't replace it. I've tried loads of times."
"What should I write it about?" Draco laughed stridently. He would have thrown his hands out, if he hadn't been making for the stairs up from the dungeons posthaste. "I have so much unique
Humiliatingly, Draco felt tears come to his eyes. "How? House elves don't have healing magic, do you?" Draco remembered some faceless house elf, back when he had only been four or five, tearfully pleading his inability to help when Draco fell and skinned his knee, although Draco's infantile fury had certainly made the elf go off and punish himself for it.
Draco felt a rush of fondness more than anything go through him. He tried not to be too harsh or wounding as he let his dam on the talon wand's power slip, and drove Ron's red light back to his body. Ron's wand sailed into Draco's waiting hand. Ron gasped and fell to his knees.
It all went so much worse than Draco could have even predicted. For starters, he was thoughtless, and woke Severus up barging into his chambers. Severus informed Draco that he would speak to him at noon, when he would wake up for lunch, and went back to bed. So of course Draco used that opportunity to scour the shelves of Severus's private library, on the off chance there was anything that could help with this or the challenges of the whole year, but shockingly enough, the books were almost entirely about potions.
"Why would you even do that?" Potter pleaded. "Is it to go off and meet a boy? Someone in another house, or an older year of Slytherin? Hermione's helping you sneak around with some
"No I don't," Dantanian whined brattily, "I never did, you just thought I did when I was little 'cause I couldn't talk." To make his point, he stopped before one of the tables near the exit, which was selling wizarding paintings, tableaus of Paris streets. The closest was a vision of the Champs-Élysées from another century.
"You- you don't mean all that, it was just a story," Gilderoy said breathlessly. "You wouldn't be- having me so close, playing with it like this, otherwise-"
She wasn't. The results were not pretty. No girls were even trying out. He didn't know if that was because of a dictate from NEWT-flunking captain Montague, or a more general counterreaction against the person who'd integrated the team, given what else Draco had done to fellow Slytherins. Millie, Pansy, Astoria: all three female parts of a historically successful Slytherin team were not even at tryouts. Meanwhile, all the players who had quit last year and were still at Hogwarts had come back. The selection of players, especially the ones Montague was watching and favoring more, seemed to be the bulky bruiser type. Well, the blue loop's sixth year had been a disastrous Quidditch season for Slytherin. And Draco wished them only ill this time.
friends. But he could never trust any friendliness on his part not to be taken as giving him false hope.
When Draco left Hagrid's hut more than an hour later, sun nearly set in the sky, he had the simultaneous feeling Hagrid had told him too much, and yet had left out almost everything Draco would needed to know.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Because I thought you'd run and go tell Diggory, obviously. I was going to tell you last minute so you couldn't, but now I see a chance to get something out of it, so..." Draco was rather proud of that lie's plausibility. "Take the note. Do we have a deal?"

"Captains, shake hands," Madam Hooch ordered, and Draco exchanged a far more civil handshake with Johnson than Flint ever had with Wood. Madam Hooch still eyed Draco warily, as if she even now wasn't quite sure what to make of him. "Mount your brooms..."

tutor. Far from it. Harry used all the visualizations that Draco had taught him and everything, Bill was just less
"It was only right that I investigate your claims," Phineas sighed, looking between the letter and the sixteen-year-old that it called a murderer at birth. "I have since, and this fire. The conflagration is real, whatever its cause. Over three hundred Muggles died in it. Your mother, though, you say." He seized upon the excuse for Dantanian, as if an infant at the time would even know. "But yes, I do believe you truly Dantanian now- unless you have directed your grandparents in this..."
Bluthers looked to have an unhealthy relish in his dark eyes as he reported, "It was a strong curse. Cast by a very powerful wizard. Very dark. It was fast-acting. Stopped his heart in an instant."
from my... talented son." His once-handsome, unshaven face had the strained, shattered quality of Bellatrix's. "You could have joined us. You could have been great. You could have, for your
Green light shot from Draco's wand for a third time in his life, out from nearly point blank range, past Theo's shoulder into Igor Karkaroff, who was flung high enough into the air to block the sun for a moment, before he crashed down dead at the feet of Bellatrix Lestrange. Bellatrix shrieked and jumped back from the body, falling against her sister and screaming out Draco's name. Theo's brilliant deep blue eyes went huge in horror as the body crashed by him as well, staring mutely at the sight of a man killed, by the same man who had killed his father.
He was awoken the next day by Severus casting a Lumos right above his eyes. "It is three in the afternoon, Draco. It may be a Sunday, but there are
Severus stopped by his cauldron, narrowed his eyes at his ingredients all already in the cauldron, but could no doubt read in the spreading blue the perfect electric green that the potion would turn out to be. That left Draco amusing himself recalling Longbottom's face back then- he could remember the old Longbottom more clearly now- as panicked as if the sky was falling when his potion overflowed. He reflexively pulled his shoes up, remembering how the soles had been ruined, and that gave him an idea. This was no real test, but he could conduct another experiment. To what extent could he change the past, if only in something this small?
, well, that would have been simpler. These fallen angel names cropped up with similar regularity to the constellation names in Black naming traditions through the genealogical records, at one time even more common before seeming to fall out of fashion, and disappearing completely around the time of the headmaster Phineas. There had even been a Dantanian Black- one and only one, centuries and centuries ago, a man who had never married or borne children, a man of whom the records gave no information, save that he had been the founder of Citadelle Xaphan...
Harry frowned and pulled out the Marauder's Map, and Draco couldn't help the gasp that escaped. Heading away from the Quidditch pitch, at a rapid pace, was a dot marked
, now that I- now that I'm faced with a choice. In a year, but things do tend to sneak up on you. There will be a war in between, a real war before too long. I won't have much time to think then."
"I'll never dump you," Harry said. With Ron gone, he seemed to feel comfortable letting his appreciation of Draco in Gryffindor colors show. "Look at you. I can't believe you're wearing a Gryffindor scarf." If Draco had been successful with the Sorting Hat, Harry would have seen Draco in a Gryffindor tie every day, but this seemed to do. "You
"It's Black now," Draco reminded him, "And I'm sixteen, and queer, incidentally. So if you're trying to tell me Seguinus seduced you, there's no need to hide it."
"Draco," Gilderoy said, face taking on the first bit of reserve it had shown that night, "What is this mirror? Where did you get it? And why must I keep it secret?"
He could be whatever he was inside, though, as long as the hat didn't call it a Slytherin. He'd personally always thought the other houses far more beast-like than Slytherin, after all, if only because of their inherent self-deception and hypocrisy, Gryffindor most of all. So, yes, not Slytherin.
"Who's to say there isn't?" Draco said softly, caressing Harry's lips. "Right from my fingertips. Go on, then, Chosen One. Give a kiss to the shadow."
Hermione listened to his rendition of Black's incredible tale with a patience Draco knew Ron and Potter would never have shown, though he could see in her eyes the one question that was the hardest to explain, without being able to admit he had future knowledge:
him, but he was as mediocre at Potions as he was generally at classes- except for Defense, much to Severus's disgust. It was harder to pick on Harry for incompetence when Harry was the best in the class. Not that Severus didn't make an admirable effort. Who could have Severus beat for persistence?
will not wield it properly. No, the Elder Wand might more aptly be named after its fellow Hallow, not a cloak of invisibility, but one of invincibility, a cloak that can be taken on and off. Because when you take off an invisibility cloak, any eye can see you."
What a place! What a singular place, with such interesting gargoyles and their flame-making things! The last castle where I resided was in far worse condition upon my arrival, and it was in better shape by the time I departed- though your uncle informs me there was a battle between the residents and the Spanish Aurors that decimated much of it again. Ah, well, c'est la vie. Your uncle has been involved in a great deal of complicated warding for the Isle of Xaphan, so hopefully, my work here on this far lovelier castle will not meet the same fate.
. Draco could feel the rushing through the midnight air of their cabinet prison how very much the creature wanted...
Draco shrugged. "There are a number of complicated factors that go into this ranking, too intricate for simple minds to follow..."
And then there was staff-tapping, not ideal at the best of times, and Crouch was one of Draco's least favorite users of that technique. Crouch came limping up towards the stairs with a ratty old cloak over his nightshirt. "Pajama party, is it?" he said, and Draco had the bad feeling he was about to witness the infuriating sight of someone addressing his godfather with disrespect.
"Do you mean Terry Boot?" Draco said skeptically. "Or Tony Goldstein? They're both sixth-year Ravenclaws. You have the right age range, give him that at least, Severus..."
"How were you convinced of this fact?" Dumbledore asked, and Ron recited the same story as Hermione, though not producing the exact words. Eventually, Dumbledore dismissed him, and Umbridge came up, with a clear agenda, probably the same as with Hermione. Discredit him with her insinuations, namely by his ties to Harry and Draco, who both had family ties to Sirius to make them want him free.
Some part of him had doubted, even if it did work, whether he would actually be able to make himself go through with it, given his old damnable
Harry's mood cast a pall on the proceedings for all of them, with the chipperness of their chatter growing somewhat forced, even from the twins. They all seemed grateful by the time the feast was winding down and Dumbledore stood up at the front of the high table. There was an unusual solemnity to his manner that had the Great Hall falling silent rapidly.
With all of the staring Dantanian did, one would have expected him to be gratified, when Dorian broke off from his latest partner and strode over resolutely towards him. "May I cut in?" Dorian asked Lamia. She stepped aside with a poorly suppressed laugh, while Dorian's head whipped to watch her leave in shocked betrayal.
"I know you'd all rather think it was me," Draco sighed, sagging back against the stands with a bleak look out at the February sunlight. "But I don't know
. You and Hermione have your studying, you and Ron have your flying, you and Luna hang out with Dobby and the other house elves and read the Quibbler together. The Slytherins live with you, you help Neville in Potions, and Seamus and Dean even get to play football with you. I'm the only one who doesn't get any special time with you, Draco. I mean, I know I'm your least favorite, but still..."
wouldn't help me this summer," he whined, and Severus led him over to one of the desks to sit. "Don't be mad. Please, Severus. I can't stand these Dementors around the castle... the things they make me remember... I don't want to play Quidditch while they're here, I don't want to go
"Oh, no, it's just because I was a criminal and he helped me abscond from the law," Sirius said, and blinked at the Grangers' pole-smacked bug eyes. "Oh, Striker, you didn't tell your parents about me? Wow, that's rare, someone who hasn't heard about all that. See, I was innocent. There was a retrial last year. Your daughter was instrumental in my defense, she was amazing, you should be proud..."
Fred and George seemed in exceptionally high spirits, in part surely because of the great success they alleged so far for Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. Draco knew from the blue loop that it would be successful, even through the war. He wondered if they had in stock Peruvian Instant Darkness powder yet. But if they didn't, it wouldn't do to go asking them for it.
How well Potter had played that afternoon, swooping around the Quidditch pitch triumphantly haloed by the sun, had almost made Draco inclined to forgive him anything. That resolution that lasted all of about twelve hours, before Potter came to him breathless with a story about following Severus on his broom into the Forbidden Forest, and seeing him terrorizing Quirrell. Potter seemed convinced this was all perfectly sane behavior on his part, stalking teachers at night on broomsticks into the Forbidden bloody Forest. Just another Saturday night for a Gryffindor. And this escapade had further proved in the eyes of Potter's trio that Severus was after the Philosopher's Stone, and trying to get Quirrell to help him.
"I don't have this to memory," Karkaroff groused. He eventually produced the page, which had an entry several pages long in the encyclopedic catalog of peculiarities: early, since Dantanian too used the word
"Harry," Draco breathed. Harry took a step closer, face uncertain. Either he still didn't have a clue what to do about Draco, or he didn't fully believe Draco was actually here.
He went up to his room and drafted owls to Hermione, Ron, and Potter. They were little better than hasty apologies for not intervening, peppered with weak self-justifications, and assurances he did not personally feel the same about the Weasleys. He spent longer drafting a letter to Severus, underlining everything he safely could about his suspicions. He laid out Father's actions at Burgin & Burkes and the bookshop, the transfer of dark objects from old places, the Ministry raids, Father's hostility towards Arthur Weasley heightening- lies about eavesdropping or seeing papers in Father's office about the Chamber of Secrets-
Draco actually expected Neville to be successful, if only because any fourth-year was Luna's ticket to the ball. He was nonplused to find Neville arriving at the library the next morning, glumly telling Ron that he could wear his dress robes to the Yule Ball, if his were really so bad, because Neville wouldn't have anyone to go with anyway. "Luna said no?" Draco asked, and got a crushed sort of nod that showed how much Neville must have been hoping she would say yes. Maybe an actual crush there. Luna could do worse. There wasn't a mean bone in Neville's body.
But Bletchley did. Montague followed, and then Warrington, and then Pucey, and then the third-year boys, and a moment later, Vince and Greg. Greg said something to Blaise, and then he and, yes, even Theo began to walk off with them, a mass of tall broad-shouldered shadows leaving them in the fading light. In an instant, it was only Draco and the girls left standing there.
"To me?" Dorian said, arching his head playfully. The light from the chandeliers caught on his beautiful moonlight hair. Dantanian did stare then, and at Dorian's eyes for a moment, the silver sheen of them in the flamelight.
"But Mother," Draco called back, stepping in her way to keep her from accidentally treading on one of a half-dozen wand boxes filled with smoking ash. "If I don't, we're going to have pay Mr. Ollivander even more money to compensate for the wands he's losing."
sign made its return, although it was Vince and not Pansy helping Millie hold it up. Draco tried valiantly not to scan the stands for Potter, failed, and spent more time staring in his direction than the Ravenclaw Seeker's before the match started. Better than at the Ravenclaw section, where Luna Lovegood probably awaited him, blissfully ignorant she still made him jump out of his skin not just at the sight of her, but even the sight of hair almost as bright as hers. Which made catching sight of his own reflection unawares a very fraught pursuit.
"Severus is just being overprotective," Draco sighed, "It's just magical exhaustion, and I should be able to be back in classes in a day or two. And have practice this weekend. We
"We think he fell because of the Dementors," Hermione said, "You know how sensitive he is to them, he passed out even before he hit the ground... Dumbledore did something to make him fall slower before he made the Dementors leave, did you see, Draco?" Draco shook his head with that numbness creeping through his whole chilled body, thinking bleakly of how very differently he had always imagined it would feel, to finally beat Harry Potter. "Don't worry, he should be fine, they're taking him to the hospital wing now- there's Ron calling, I should go."
He'd thought Hermione would abhor anything Divination-related, but she seemed too giddy with a sugar-high and life high to complain. In fact, when Draco refused to take his turn, she demanded he go find Harry, so at least
Draco leaned forward, taking on as conversational a tone as if they were gossiping in the Three Broomsticks. "See, I had just won the minister's pocket watch off him, betting on the outcome of the cup final. Me and my father were at his box as personal guests, and I bet our watches that Krum would catch the Snitch but lose the match. So the Minister had to forfeit that lovely article you see on my handsome uncle over there, the dapper young man in all the fetching chains-"
"So vengeance against me isn't a top item on the agenda?" Draco asked weakly, though the sound of Sirius's name gave him misgivings. Whatever detente had been reached between Sirius and Severus, or at least
They were both careful to keep up the appearance of their normal routines, with the only real divergence Ron's fault, as he refused to keep coming to flying on Saturdays if Draco was to have Krum there. So Draco tried to uninvite Krum, he really did, he told Krum he couldn't come and the boy nodded. Yet the stubborn Seeker was still there waiting glumly outside the dungeons at 11:30 prompt that Saturday night, as if Draco had never said a thing, so there was no help for it. Ron was the one cut from them.
me you'd been hearing voices, Potter, at least after you stopped thinking I was the Heir, I could have figured it out a lot sooner..." Potter looked down, flushing guiltily. "
Draco realized once Black shoved his singed hand in Draco's face that it was a question, one that Black could not ask with a cursed tongue. The Langlock still held, but Black could do wordless magic, at least of the less complex kind under stress. Black couldn't lift the Langlock, though, not that he seemed concerned right away about that. Instead, he gave another wave of his hand, which looked much like Mother's after their visit to Ollivander's. Except it was darker, closer to black than red after the moment of impact.
"How dare you," Remus started saying again, "How dare you." He seemed to be saying it for something more than just the Potters' murder, when he reached into his patched bag and threw a wrapped bunch of drooping white flowers on the ground before Black like a gauntlet. Their blooms all faced downwards, two or three wing-like petals hanging from each like an albino dragonfly. Their sight unsettled Draco almost more than ropes, even before Remus whispered, "Do you think anyone but you at Hogwarts would gather me wild snowdrops for Valentine's Day?"
Remus's scream drew Draco's attention, and his gaze and wand hand jerked up as he finished the word. Dark marks ripped across the wood, tearing it to tracks of splinters, rather than hitting Bellatrix. In the distance, Draco could see Sirius and Remus, alone, clumped away from all the others in white. You could tell the sides apart in a single glance, with the Death Eaters all in black robes, and DA and the Order in the wedding party's Muggle clothes of sullied white. There were two Death Eaters down on the ground between Sirius and Remus, unmoving. But Sirius and Remus were down as well, separated, with their wands banished halfway to Draco, and a single Death Eater standing between them-
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words, a knight, a bishop, a castle, and a pawn turned their backs on the white pieces, and walked off the board leaving four empty squares for them to take.
"You know if he tells Hermione all his emotions," Draco drawled, "He might start fancying her, she's very pretty, she's his age, in Gryffindor and all- if he doesn't fancy her a little already..."
Severus was not what one would call a friend, to Draco nor anyone else. Only his godfather, and luckily enough also a human being with inherently vested interest in seeing the future not disintegrate thanks to a misplaced Malfoy. Severus's pillar of black, black robes, black greasy hair, dark and yet so incredibly young-looking, so incredibly alive, that was the only hope in all the ceremonial trappings here.
He ran, too afraid to look up long enough to cast anything directly at Black. "Fumos!" he gasped, and the smoke that rose in the air was cover enough for him to stagger out in the direction of the door. "Ventus!" he yelled, and heard the door blow off his hinges, giving him a large enough hole to make it through even unable to see properly. He could tell himself it was the aftermath of Pansy's curse making it so difficult to flee at any speed, but really, it was his own smoke...
Except then he remembered when Father had summoned these twelve and Dobby to watch him punished, and realized it was not
"Hang on, there's a PS," said Potter, and read, "'I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it's my fault he no longer has a rat.'"
Draco hugged her from behind, wishing he could see. "Will you try touching your wand between the words? That's what made me think this was tied to my wand, that it worked for me but not Ron..."
Father had seemed occupied at the counter with Mr. Borgin, but when he called Draco's name and looked back, Potter panicked. "Close the door!" he hissed. When Draco just stared, he grabbed Draco by the Slytherin crest on his chest and hauled him into the cabinet with him.
As he had the morning after the Auror ambush, Draco awoke to the sight of Severus's face peering down at him, a black blur that resolved into a once-trusted face. Except this time, there was a wand between them. And Draco's arms and legs were bound to a chair.
The Gryffindors seemed to enjoy their newfound celebrity, as even Blaise, free of his splint but still favoring his hurt arm, had gone up to Patil and Brown to ask what was going on. Head Boy Peter started trying to hustle everyone into their places, eager to deprive everyone of any incidental fun that could come with the occasion. It was a stark change in circumstances, from the freedom of Apparating between his family's ancestral homes, unwatched and unnoticed, to becoming yet another schoolchild clumped up like a refugee for his own supposed safety, while Peter bloody Weasley got to lord it over him. He couldn't stop being thirteen soon enough.
"Sanguirenere," Draco snarled, and the doors opened. Unfortunately, they'd beaten Severus down from the Great Hall, so they were left to wait, Draco set to pacing about the cold rooms. Luna walked over to the blank stretch of lighter wall at the center of the sitting room, touching it curiously. Maybe it would have been better for Severus to hang up Lockhart's tapestry there after all. "No, Luna, don't get near there-" Draco had to separate her from the blocked-off fireplace. As if he needed more reminder of Fiendfyre after the Dementor.
"Draco," McGonagall said firmly, her use of his first name pronounced enough to make him start. "As Professor Flitwick says, you are one of the most talented students we have ever taught-"
Draco had put a tracking charm on Luna's necklace, he realized, and felt even more foolish than the night had already shown him to be. "Avenseguim," he whispered, and the talon wand pulled him towards the Manor, though he had to take the long way around to be sure to avoid any guests. "Lumos," he cast, to make sure his one eye was receiving enough light to not fall over in his best Christmas robes, which turned out useful. The tug of the charm led him towards the cellars.
