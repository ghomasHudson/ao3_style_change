"Not to worry headmaster, they at least do not require my close observation at all hours of the day, however I will take my leave as there is much to prepare, hand over the boy to the headmaster Black and we will begin our tasks, be sure to inform Lupin of the situation when you see him and bring him back with you" Severus said, Albus moved aside his papers and withdrew the correct forms signalling Sirius to take them "You will need to take these both to Familial Affairs and Gringotts respectfully, please bring back the Vault Key they present you with and the approval letters upon your return, we will be waiting" he smiled as Sirius handed over the boy how promptly woke up and started crying as Albus took him "Oh dear you are a lively one aren't you Harry? Let me see if I don't have some spare dragons' blood for you to sip" he said as he rummaged through his draws to withdraw a small crimson vial, he pulled the stopper off and gently fed the contents to the child "here you go son, that's nice isn't it!" The others left his office in hurry once content he was in good hands.
Ha ha Umbridge got caught! I wonder how the trial will turn out though, it does seem to be thick with political manipulations within the Wizengamot and its ruling.
"Do it, I want to know how deep I have been played!" Harry nodded and slit his palm again to drop more blood on the parchment handed to him, showing a list of things currently affecting him.
He stood up quickly and dusted off his cloak before turning to greet his rescuers, only to find Kingsley Shacklebolt standing beside him, looking both vaguely amused but also tense about the explanation be knew was coming.
Meanwhile Albus Dumbledore was sat at his desk ideally examining notes in his itinerary for the day ahead, he had hoped Pettigrew would of sent word of his little excursion however he had to concede 'if I was a filthy Death Eater that just potentionally brought his master to his death, he would lie low as well, I wouldn't be surprised if Sirius Black and Remus, once they heard of their friends betrayal would go on the hunt for the Rat, we will see what happens later in regards to the boy' he thought, his mind whirling with schemes depending on the outcome of the days events.
Sirius sneered as he approached the intersection between Diagon and Knockturn at the Rats reaction "You aren't escaping this Peter this I will assure, for I was actually James's best friend and will avenge him for his and Harry's sake, I bet you haven't even seen the boy, just fled the scene leaving a poor defenceless child to rot along with your master!" He snarled in accusation.
"My boy I saw fit to make sure the ritual is the only time people will see his correct form due to the way the ministry is likely to come searching for him as well as others before hand, James was already deep within the Vampire High Court's grudge list for his many accomplishments as an Auror, without his Sire, Harry is vulnerable as he is, this will protect him from prejudice in the meantime before the ritual takes place" he said projecting his grand fatherly aura as if he were the wisest of the two.
"Specie Alis! Specie Sanguinis! Magicae Obstructionum! You would be too powerful without the proper precautions" he murmured as Harry's form became Human in appearance, both his true appearance and his wings glamoured and anchored via blood magic to prevent him from being retrieved by one of his kind so easily and his magical ability restricted with a block on his inherent abilities, due to the previous metamorph into his mothers appearance, he was now stuck looking like a human young child with bright green eyes and dark red hair, making him every inch the appearance of his mother, until the block was removed, this would be the only appearance he will ever know or others.
"I accept you Po-Harry however you are right I am dating Blaise and this could present a problem given certain aspects of my life" he whispers in response despite the muffling charm, Blaise butted in "If you wish me to jump back into a platonic relationship I am perfectly fine with that and it would not affect our friendship Draco, I am very happy for you and did you see Pansy's face oh Salazar it was priceless as the port key hit her!" He laughs again which caused both Draco and Narcissa to smirk slightly.
It didn't take long before a bright flash of green flame enveloped the tense atmosphere between Remus and Albus, drawing their calculative gazes towards the new occupants now appearing in the headmasters study.
Dolores gathered herself before the Aurors came looking and simply strolled confidently towards Sonia's office, intent on finding out the information herself, smirking slightly as she neared the end of the corridor.
~A goodd pointss my sssweet I believe he isss telling what he knowss to be true, however he doesss not posssesss the sskillss or magical sstrength to casst the charm, I will need to be careful on thiss excursion dessspite it being certain victory the old fool will not bessst me~ Voldemort replied thoughtfully.
"Yes, sorry the weirdness of that is astonishing, let's go and talk to Auror Black, if you will follow me Mr Diggle" she says as they walk past the Auror office, apparently in uproar seeing Dolores being dragged in 'this scandal will be in this evening's Daily Prophet at this rate' she thinks as they glance at the rushing around between the Auror cubicle's, before they could pass however Kingsley shouts at Sonia "Wait a second I need to talk to you about this particular case!" He gestures to Dolores who's red and angry face is still struggling with the binds on her.
"Albus and Severus hold a vast knowledge and positions high enough to take care of such a child though I wish to escort you back up to your office and talk to Auror Black myself and also request to see the child myself to do a full risk assessment, given I am aware of the adoption rituals backlash of turning the sire into a half blooded creature, if the child is one so I will ask to also be present with two of my staff on hand as well when it is pushed through, we will go back up in a few moments I must send a memo to my staff about this before I meet with Sirius" he said as he smiled and penned a note to his subordinates, requesting a meeting in two hours to determine the risks after he visited young Mr Potter.
As Harry collapsed unconscious due to the influx of receiving the power of the mysterious Shaytan, Osiris ran to him exasperated "The one fool to help me escape this place and he's allowed himself to over tax his magical consumption.. this idiot has damn near killed himself before he could even get me out of here!" He raged, much to the amusement of the Goblins stationed around him.
Albus Dumbledore eagerly retreated back to his study after his brief farewell to Madam Pomfrey and Severus in the hospital wing.
"Who the hell is knocking at this time of night it can't be Remus, He's with the werewolves as far as I know and if it were Sirius we would of heard the motorcycle by now, bloody monstrosity it is!" Lily whispered to him worridly clutching her son tightly, who began to cry slightly at the rough handling, "I'm sorry baby, mommy didn't mean to crush you, I'm just scared, James check who's there I will lock this door in case with the strongest thing I can think of, hurry!" James nodded and stood up to open their door as quietly as he could.
Albus disapperated quickly, whilst the wards repaired themselves in Gringotts and fled to Order Headquarters. As he apperated into the square of Grimmauld Place however he was greeted with Sirius holding him at wand point whilst the others apperated back in, surrounding the old man.
Her companion a thin, deeply cloaked figure with blue soul fires illuminating a skull like visage under its hood, a tell tale sign of being graced in the presence of a Lich, two of the most powerful forms of undead now reside in their company shocking even Albus Dumbledore into a stupor.
Griphook then twisted the cart leaver sharply making their cart speed off deep underground but not taking the usual route or passing any known vaults just sharp lefts and rights before hitting an underground waterfall which splashed everyone causing Harry to gasp "What the hell was that!?" He shouted over the roar the wind and the sound of the tracks beneath the cart, the goblins just grinned "It is the thief's downfall, for the older vaults protection, it washes away all enchartments if you were not whom you said you were it would have been a very nasty surprise even if you know about it, not long now before we get to the feeding area" Griphook murmurs with a nasty grin on his face at Harry's question.
She took a moment to gather herself and breathe more calmly than she felt before knocking, "Enter" a rough male voice said from inside, she steeled her resolve as the door opened to reveal the man inside, sitting at his desk writing, what seemed to be a long report, occasionally scratching his sweaty head.
Kingsley laughed and shook his head "Dumbledore is wise, having that department under his thumb is imperative if you want them to let this go through, as you know it will do if you do not let you anger at bureaucratic paper shuffling get the best of you" he said and patted him gently on the shoulder, "we will need to continue your recount after this meeting is over, before I let you leave to attend your godson, warrants will be needed I just hope your's won't be, for strangling Diggle in a minute." He smiled but his eyes remained deadly serious, letting Sirius know he would not walk away if he didn't hold back his temper.
"You invited war with a magical race that controls the financial security for Wizarding Britain just because you wanted to get to my godson Albus? You best have a damn good reason however guys I believe this discussion needs to be held in my home before some Aurors track him and by extension me, it would not do well for Tonks and Kingsleys careers to be seen here with both of us, at least you can explain away not knowing is plans against Gringotts and fleeing when finding out, I suggest going to file the report at the ministry" Sirius added angrily, his wand trained on the headmaster, who tensed at the idea of Kingsley and Tonks leaving.
"Finally some mail!" I walk quietly over to the mysterious note only to find the Gringotts seal 'Well that's disappointing maybe they know something?' I pick up the letter and begin to read.
Voldemorts' crimson gaze fell on the retreating wizard, contemplating on his servants motives before disregarding it for another time. "Wormtail you best not fail me if you want to be rewarded for this, you will have all you desire if by tonight I am the only one alive in that house, now be gone and collect any materials you think will be needed!".
They all blinked owlishly before Draco answered "I will await you at home then love after your Gringotts visit, come mother, Blaise, we have other matters to attend to as does Harry if what is to be believed we will meet him later" they all got up as Harry cast a silent disillusionment charm again "Harry non-verbal and wandless? I must say you are astonishing already!" Narcissa murmured to the invisible grinning Harry before disapperating with the other two, leaving him once again alone and heading towards the imposing grey stone building housing Gringotts.
"Suit yourself just be aware I will be dominating two tonight and I want you scarce when that happens!" Draco said with a snort as he snuggled further back into the seats and Harry's oblivious embrace.
James looked down at him and as their eyes meet, he could of sworn they repeatedly changed colours 'is my kid a metermorphamagus at well? Damn Tonks will have a run for her money if that is the case, what doesn't my boy have skill in? It already seems endless potential' he mused as he gently laid back down with them both under the covers and listen to both of them sleep with his little Harry in his arms.
Ragnok actually smirked at that, "Be that as it may he is our client and went willingly to remove blocks placed on his person by none other than yourself Dumbledore" his smirk widened at the various gasps and the furious blue eyed gaze attempting to petrify him where he stood.
She cursed quietly as the elf fumbled and squealed his apologies 'Paddy just had to take James seriously and botch the job and my efforts to calm little Harry' Lily thought a touch indignantly as she took the crying boy into her arms to try and calm him again.
Sirius and Remus were silent for a moment at this, before Sirius asked "Flora if we are to care for the boy other than Severus how are we to keep up with his immortality? I may not be his new guardian after this but I do still love the boy and have a duty of care for him as my best friends wanted" Remus nodded at this too, Flora cocked her head at this "Hmm you have a point human and I do admire your determination to keep our Harry safe, you will be given a choice though Remus has limited options given he is already a Dark Creature and has the limitations of his kind, though we do have a solution, for you we can turn you into an immortal being depending on which Creature you wish to become, you could even allow Harry or myself to bite you if Vampire is your choice, however I expect a choice brought to us before we leave with them both. As for Remus we can give the potion to fuse him and his wolf as a start and we can even persuade Nicolas Flammel to give him monthly doses of the elixir of life, it is the only way he can stay alive but be warned it is an eternity of loneliness if you wish to stay in the mortal world with immortality, those you love turn to dust while you remain, can you even handle immortality to care for young Harry?" She asked with a raised eyebrow.
After a while of stopping and starting Stan starts observing me more closely in my bed "Say Nev or shoulda say Harry? What's up with ya eyes? Weren't they green last time?" He asks inquisitively, I just shrug and say I'm wearing new contacts "It's a cool muggle item Stan, changes your eye colour to whatever you want for a select amount of time!" I smile abit to make it believed, "Heh, that a thing? Well I mus' say it's very allurin' might have to try some meself!" He laughs, "I recommend going to alternative fashion and trinket shops in London maybe like Camden Town to get those Stan" I reply with a slight smirk, He just nods in acceptance and the ride resumes its silence despite the crashing sounds as the bus tears through random roads as it passes along well until its next stop when someone heavily cloaked got on and sat with their hood up right beside him on the opposite bed "Didn't think you would be so bold to get on here Tom" I sneer at the figure who let out a dark chuckle and lifted his head to meet my eyes, "looksss like your inheritance has given you more gall Harry, I am not here to kill you for once providing you don't try my patience asss we both know I have very little, I found an unscheduled raid on your previous premisessss and was intrigued that you even knew my little calling card ssspell, I alssso happen to know what you are, are you intrigued to know?" He asks coldly, "now you mention it Tom I was just going to Gringotts but if you can save me the trouble with minimal risk sure, what's the catch? Want my fealty? Well I won't give it you murdered my only family after all and unless something drastically changes I will never".
Dumbledore stood up and conjured a cot for the boy and promptly set him inside satisfied that the spell he had cast was successful before sitting back down and focusing on his piles of work with a smirk.
They walked out, vaguely aware of some memos flying out to zoom off to the correct doors littering 2 metres apart on each side of the corridor. Sirius gestured towards the end of the corridor, as they strode past Auror Headquarters, all of which waved from their cubicles if they weren't busy buried in mountains of paperwork.
"S-sorry s-sir it-t s-says I na-need Bat Spleen yet I took a Bazour oops" she said shakily, "Oops indeed, if you had used that with the potion and made the ingredients volatile without the Bat Spleen at least when you test it, you would have something to counteract the poison you would have ingested, 10 points from Hufflepuff for failing at adhering to simple instructions, get back to your seat and start brewing or you will be in detention finishing it tomorrow night!" He shouted as she practically ran back to her seat to prepare her brewing station and cauldron, 'it's times like these I am reminded of how little, children follow the instructions and care little for their dangerous errors, I would leave this place now that the Dark Lord is on a undetermined leave of absence, if not for Harry needing me now and what Dumbledore is likely to do to me, if I left his service, I would also leave his protection and given the court's and the ministry will be after us, we could use all the backing we can get, if I want a less risky life for the boy' Severus thought as he walked around the room eyeing the cauldrons many stages of premature disaster in distaste.
As the cool lift voice chimed "Level 2: Department Of Magical Law Enforcement, Auror Headquarters, Familial Affairs Office and Improper Use Of Magic Office" the grills opened for its occupants to see and hear a screaming Umbridge, getting toed along towards the auror office by Kingsley Shackelbolt, they could only stare in wonderment "What the hell is this about?" Sonia muttered, Dedalus just started laughing.
"You are disssmisssed, Wormtail face me, I wish to know everything.. Legelimens! I see Godrick's Hollow has been placed under a fidelius charm by the old fool and you were named secret keeper" he smirked "We will leave tonight to avoid issues, Ssseverus? Did you wish to ask ssomething?" He met the beadle black stare of the other dark figure looming over Wormtail with a questioning gaze.
With a second of genius Harry wordlessly layered a triple cast of 'Divina Secundum Aspectum, Visus Scelerisque and Feles Oculos' to make sure he could see all the creatures even if they were under some kind of Spectral concealment.
The next chapter will feature the reason behind Harry's sudden appearance and what happened when Albus went to capture Harry.
"Madam he speaks the truth, you should have known not to do this especially in front of us Aurors, you can come quietly so that you have a lenient sentence or you can make it worse for attacking your colleagues of law enforcement" Kingsley stated in a smooth voice, eyes hard with conviction, also holding his wand aloft ready for rebellion.
As the sun split the horizon an audible thump split the calm silence, within the centre of town and as if out of thin air a hook nosed man appeared at the noises source, clad in greasy black silk robes, clashing equally with his stained black hair, carrying a wand outstretched in his right hand.
Sirius kissed his head and said softly "Don't worry heaven and earth will not stop us from finding him, I'm sure Albus made a fail safe to find the boy, he might even have a vial of blood to use as an anchor for location spells in case this happened we know the bastard has always been crafty and thinks many steps ahead until today when this caught all of us off guard!" He squeezed his mate softly in reassurance before turning and bolting down the stairs towards the kitchen.
"Erm Griphook is the Lactura safe around anything in this room? They have a much stronger appetite for magic than even I do" Harry asked nervously staring at the sleeping beast.
"Interesting he seems to have taken on the characteristics of Dark Elves like his companion here, the boy has rune patterns that are brimming with untapped power, from what I can see these patterns improve his magical control, some are even elemental based, I have never seen them on common creatures so he must have found something powerful, what truly intrigues me is the golden glowing Deathly Hallows sign on his chest, that is the mark of a Higher Necromancer and of the house of Peverell no less, he will be a true asset to our side if his talent is cultivated, assuring his allegiance is paramount but first I must assess the circumstances, chain the Elf here in the dungeons with the other prisoners I wish to interrogate him more thoroughly, his resistance is impressive, contact Severus and bring him to my room's young Blaise, Draco take your new partner to your rooms and inform me of when he wakes, dismissed!" Voldemort intoned darkly before walking back up the stairs and out of sight.
"It seems our purpose for meeting has been cancelled by a higher authority Dumbledore I will be leaving now to inform the minister of this occurrence" He walked shaking slightly to the floo and disappeared before Albus could even comment, he just sat there in rage causing the all the various instruments and even the portraits to scream as they rattled under the pressure of his aura.
As all floo occupants stumbled into the floo room, cries of Lily's agony could be heard down the hall, they took a brief glimpse of the floo room before a house elf greeted and introduced itself "Misters and Misses I am Paddy! My mistress needs you hurry! Poor master Harry is stuck!" It wailed and squeaked before it took their cloaks and popped away.
She reached his desk and swiftly slammed a copy of the Daily Profit under his widening and calculating gaze and glared at him approvingly, the image showing number four Privet Drive burnt to the ground with a hanging Dark Mark present above the building, coiling slowly in the sky.
"The Potter's have been murdered by the Dark Lord, Sirius is investigating and thinks Peter helped the insane bastard! Leaving their day old boy Harry an orphan, somehow the boy killed Voldemort as well, Sirius saw his body with his own eyes this morning if you haven't yet read the paper" he barked in a voraciously feral whisper before stalking off towards the direction of the castle, not even giving her a chance to reply, minutes past as she just gawped owlishly at his retreating form, it took a patron to tap her on the arm for her to come out of the daze she apparently was under as if someone had wordlessly stupified her and it was only just now wearing off.
Sirius snarled at Snape for the barb though disregarded after a moment to glance at Harry wriggling in the mans cape on the bed, his bright Avada eyes and red hair made what little of his heart still there, break "Aww you poor kid, how dare they do this to you, how dare they do this to your parents.." as if to prove the point he gathered magic into his hands and punched the Voldemorts face, breaking his skull with the forces impact, it did nothing to alleviate the despair and anger he felt but he had to do something, his body was aching to destroy something and take revenge against the injustice.
"Please put on the rings of your house's Lord Potter and then we shall leave for the Ritual to remove your blocks and go select some Dark Creatures for you to feed on, you also have to realise this ceremony will hurt a lot, removing blocks is no small thing and putting them on is potentially lethal to a person let alone a child".
Sirius walked out of the house with cage in hand, leaving Remus standing there struggling to control his anger and agonising in despair over the loss of one of his oldest friends and the potential of losing another to the Dementors Kiss, 'How could the bastard do that to his friends? What had James done to deserve it? We took the Rat in.. had so many memories together, hell we created the map together.. he was our best friend' "Why arghh!" He screamed as he punched the wall repeatedly in a fit of boiling rage, though he calmed quickly and sunk to the floor in grief, crying softly into the gloom as he reminisced what would forever be lost.
They approached the last door to the right labelled 'Familial Affairs Office, Mrs Sonia Kettleburn' and knocked briskly. "Come in!" A cheery voice called, they opened the door and glanced inside, the room was the same as all of the small offices, it seemed, one short desk stood in the back of the circular room, lined with a book shelf to the right side, numerous filling cabinets to the left side of the room, a book open on a pedestal listing all the names of Wizarding Children's lines, their blood status and addresses if known, an enchanted window lay stripped across the wall on the left side of the door, showing a bright summer day, 'it seems Magical Maintenance, in charge of those things were not angling for another pay rise', Sirius noted before taking in the woman gazing up at him from her desk.
"You will be the first to know his testimony, please go see Harry I don't want him to be so close unsupervised with the headmaster, he is at risk from anyone being a dark creature only a day old, please old friend go to him, protect him whilst I see to this trash and the legal matters for getting his guardianship changed" he gestured to the cage.
During the commotion downstairs Lily crawled off the bed crying as she did so with her Harry, she managed to cast but one spell before the the silencing wards dropped "Vita Sanguinem Praesidium!" She choked pointing her wand at her baby boy who glowed ethereally under the spell for a minute before the door burst open.
"Dumbledore should have protected you all!" He spat venomously "How did that traitor Pettigrew conceive the nerve to even oust the Potters location? How did he even know it! I was not aware of the change, I thought that little bastard Black would be his ideal candidate for the task, not the Rat! I will find out what he knows when I find him I vow it!" He shouted angrily.
"Blaise I trust Osiris is held in the dungeon? And that you used the correct cuffs to chain him? If not you will be punished should he portal here" Voldemort said crimson eyes trained on him with a strongly questioning gaze.
Harry wasn't having it a second time, he wailed even in her grasp, though did become quickly sidetracked into sniffles when he glimpsed her throat and made a wriggle for it. Caught off guard Lily became more angry "James how dare you give him to me without feeding him! He's after me now and I'm too weak to fight him come and get him!" She shouted down the hall.
Thankfully it was fading fast as Harry absorbed its gift, making him actually immune to the strongest poison, besides Acromantula venom and Nundu spit, in the world.
"Ah you little bugger, you already want feeding hmm? You can't have mommy, she's off limits because you can't yet control either thirst or your ability to pass on your condition, so come 'ere you!" He laughed and lunged at the wriggling little one tickling and picking him up, to which little Harry just giggled slightly and Lily smiled tiredly before falling back to sleep.
'So that's whom Tom meant when he said he had suspected my mate's identity, oh this will be fun!' Harry smirked delightfully under his disillusionment near them and contemplated the risks of giving into his instincts to jump them all and move his friends away from what was Harry's in all senses of the word.
Sirius just stood there for a few minutes patiently and ideally until the goblin he was dealing with returned, watching the other occupants as they were being served for any suspicious behaviour.
Most of these curses and spells are my inventions though a few are property of J.K Rowling's official spells.
Griphook pushed the door inwards and turned to see Harry's slightly stunned "I'm sure you are wondering why I must do that, standard procedure hex on vaults, if one tried to open their vault without a goblin present it would swallow them whole and we only test them for thieves once a year to see who's stuck inside, you will die through starvation way before we check it" he let out a voracious grin at him which was returned after a moment.
Will Peter stay put? How will the Wizarding World take the news the dark lord was defeated by a dark creature infant? How will the adoption affect Snape and his position as Potions Master? Will they be condemned or appraised? Stay tuned!
He sighed and completed the steps with ease before placing it under a stasis charm for later, making it just in time for his next lesson with the first year Hufflepuff's and Ravenclaw student's, he quickly hurried to the classroom, once in there he meticulously went around whispering "Evanesco" vanishing the remains of any problematic concoctions left by the untidy seventh years "I can rely on them not to blow this room up, yet I have to be their maid after every brew? This is getting ridiculous, I will need to have words with Minerva, Filius and Pormona about student's and their sloppy cleanliness after the day's potions lesson's are through, before I meet the others for the ritual" he said to himself with a scowl, he had just finished when the first years began to arrive and take their seats, they knew well to remain quiet as he shut the door and made his way to the chalk board.
"I do not doubt you have a lot you could give him at your disposal Sirius, however only another vampire could sire this child, unless you wish to perform the rites of blood adoption, infecting yourself with the curse to raise him as a Potter-Black heir and having your Auror license revoked due to contamination, you are unfit to be his guardian, if he was human the circumstances would be entirely different and he would also have relatives to choose from if it were the case as well but it sadly isn't so.." Albus parted the mans leg as he stood up in sympathy, who incidentally looked pained at having the concede that point, he would be throwing his only means of supporting Harry into ruin if he took up the mantel James had past to him, he despaired in silence realising it was another of his failure's.
"We will need to apparate despite how young he is as this place will be searched very soon, the village is now awake, that means the ministry will send someone, I only came here early to congratulate James and Lily on the birth and to see the boy" Sirius said in a pained voice, "you suggest splinching the infant? You incompetent fool! No we will get to Hogsmead via my private portkey, I had this made to visit Lily when I could and I am glad it proved so useful until the end, touch the insignia ring on my right hand and be ready Black" Severus waved the ring in his face to show where it was to the fool in front of him.
Putting his new sludge ability to use, Harry suddenly imploded like tar and fell to the floor, becoming the black sludge he saw before.
'I hope Peter is innocent of this however, despite what my gut tells me is the truth and the lies he told before he tried to run, I can't lose anyone else' he thought miserably as he trudged past Honeydukes, Madam Rosmerta eyed him warily as she stood outside it, taking her patrons orders.
Sirius thought for a moment before nodding "What's been asked?", Molly answered "He cursed Tonks and Kingsley so he could get away from the Auror's, he was going back to Hogwarts, apparently he made a fail safe vial of Harry's blood to anchor and locate him, he ran for him this morning because he knows the boy has turned into a dark creature, apparently his inheritance was starved off intentionally".
We are pleased to inform you of an unexpected creature inheritance, please come see your account manager Griphook at your earliest convenience, we have much to discuss, some of which may be knowledge pertaining to your rites to succession of your house(s) line(s), Discrepancies, as well as what is owed to you and what the details of your inheritance are and it's given abilities.
'Thoigh this is a logical arguement, with Albus and his position within the Wizengamot, he would be able to overwrite even Fudge should the boy be present in the ministry, so while true if they were alone, his reasoning is entirely too suspicious' Severus thought as he tightened his occlumens shields "If I may Headmaster, I believe the boy would be best left in the care of Remus Lupin instead while we see to the preparations for tonight, he would be adequate protection and does not teach lessons here so holds no prior obligations? Black here could call for him to mind the boy instead as I am sure you are teeming with duties that demand your attentions elsewhere" he drawled in insinuation and subtle threat.
Severus merely eyed the child speculatively and snorted at the mans anguish, beside him and also the heavy dose of fake sympathy Dumbledore said to sway the petulant mutt next to him, 'if he can't do that to save a child he really isn't a man and is truly unfit for this extraordinary child, I would do it just as penance for not being able to save his mother' he thought.
The goblin in question nodded and handed a third piece of parchment detailing recent business transactions and vault estimates.
The goblin smiled at his discomfort "you are certainly Mr Black it seems, we apologise for doubting you now let me go find the Potter's case manager to grant your request of this change, I will be back in a moment" the goblin said as he walked off to the side and through a door inaccessible to the customers.
"Wait Blaise please do not tell me you used our normal magic sealing cuffs on a Dark Elf.. you do realise they don't work on magical creatures!" As the look of horror dawned on his ex lovers face he realised with a sinking dread that is exactly what happened and was startled when another knock struck the door followed by Lord Voldemort and his father walking in with a decidedly evil smirk on their faces.
Severus made a soft incision with a wordless Sectumsempra and Albus spelled it bloodless so Poppy could reach in and grab the baby out of uterus sack, she popped the sack quickly to grab hold of the baby when an inhuman shriek reached their ears and a powerful magical backlash rose through the room throwing the occupants into the wall with loud thuds, James was the first to recover and pick the baby out of her before sealing the wound and carrying his screaming son to his mother softly groaning on the bed.
Remus slowly stood to place Harry in his cot as was asked, being very careful not to wake the infant who fell asleep sheltered in his arms, sometime after Remus started stroaking him, his golden irises dimming as the waves of quiet anger left him.
You could hear her screaming all the way down, it caused quite a steer despite Sirius being vaguely happy he had finally caught her for something 'that's one less evil to contend with, now I have to wait for that bastard Diggle to have final say on Harry's Adoption, I will hex him if he says it won't be done, Azkaban be damned!' He fumed silently in his head as he awaited the door to open again.
He quickly found himself at the end of the alley and walking up the steps to the Remus and Pettigrew residence, he knocked briskly and waited for a sign of movement within the dwelling, after a moment he could hear subtle shuffling towards the entrance and muffled "hold on whoever you are!", as the knob turned and the door was wrenched open slightly to reveal Remus looking haggard.
The room went silent for a minute before Albus said "I was actually present at his birth not two days before, you could taste the dark magic rolling off the boy, it almost made even myself weak kneed, curiously however this is probably just the combination of magicks setting in and he is yet to unlock his full potential, all I can be certain of is without a steady hand he will be a threat to even himself later on, he was able to somehow even force some protego variant to expel Lord Voldemorts curse it seems despite being new born, it is a sign few will be his equal when grown, this is why I stand behind Severus being an appropriate guardian and not Sirius mainly due to temperament and lack of facilities, do you agree Dedalus?".
Remus's eyes flashed gold again as he threw a full body bind at Albus, who deftly fell to the side and rolled outside the spell path, "You are making a mistake Remus" he said quietly, "If you let the boy run around leaking his powerful presence the court's will sense him from miles away this is for his own and others safety!" Albus spat.
"We are here to monitor your adoption of young Harry and to take you and others with us for potential training should you wish it, they are all on the floor mainly due to Dumbledore's aggressive reaction to us protecting Harry from his manipulations though we aren't discouraging his Wizarding heritage just because he is one of the immortal clan, he will be returning to this school at 11 just like every other wizard he will just have a must higher aptitude that needs prerequisite training before he is allowed to mingle with mortals, did you bring the adoption potion like a good boy Severus? My name is Flora by the way, though let me make it clear Immortal does not mean invulnerable, he is still delicate until his majority given his creature inheritance will only give him his full powers then, I suggest Dumbledore we find some teaching staff later on to cater for his aptitudes when we realise the extent of his abilities, at which time you will be informed of people sent with him to teach him extra classes than the rest of your school though you won't have to pay these new staff members and we will not meddle in what's not our affairs it is simply to allow him the best education of both worlds".
Severus stood in his store cupboard rummaging through his stores to find the specific ingredients for the Adoption Ritual potion he needed to brew before the idiot Black came back from the ministry "Half a gram of Dragons' Heart String, a pinch of Asphodel, Flobberworm Pus, Diced Scarab, a litre of Moonshine and an ounce of Gurdyroot to ward against the acidic toxins, all that is left will be the final ingredients of mixed blood" he said as he gathered each ingredient before heading to his private potion lab 'before any of the obnoxious children see him' he thought with a sneer.
Both died kind of quickly despite the struggle at first leaving only a one on one with the Hydra who seemed like it wasn't having none of it, it raged stamped and threw duel breaths of Ice, Fire and also a strange type of cyan Lightening at him as he attempted to drain the beast, the power of elements combined morphed into Ray's of pure annihilation power before hitting him, the phenomenon only possible when multiple chaotic elements meet and are focused before exploding, it would of destroyed the entire bank and all its occupants if Harry wasn't continuously sapping all the magic as it was released as well as through the piece of him attached firmly the beings body.
"Draco you have our blessing to bed him and court him, he will be an asset and I promised him you if he chose to join us in our hunt to take down Dumbledore, you are his mate, it will bring more than glory and prestige to your house with this union, it will bring a new magical era with no distinction of light or dark animosity, the empire we have wished for, though I do hope I can convince him to kill off the mud bloods or at least the blood traitors, it is not a hard feat with his abilities on top of being a higher Necromancer and not the measly ones I've had to use before, you have my permission and I do hope you give him a child as he is very capable of conceiving, his species if you are unaware is a legendary Dark Chimera, though its rarer still being a humanoid one, it is usually a familiar to a wizard or witch than one with the capacity he has for in depth thought" Voldemort said slowly with a slight smirk gracing his lipless face.
Abilities: Parseltongue, Wandless Magic, Non Verbal Magic, Blood Magic and Dark Magic Affinity, Mind Magic, Alluring Aura, Vampiric Touch, Inherit Magical Gifts, Animagus Affinity, Enhanced Hearing, Enhanced Smell, Lifeforce Detection, Petrifying Gaze, Higher Necromancy.
The next chapter will reveal their first times and it will also show how the ministry reacted to Dumbledore's rash actions!
'It seems the dunderheads live to brew another day without my explicit guidance' Severus thought satisfied he could attend to more pressing matters, as he walked back the way he had come, back to his private lab ready to brew the adoption potion for his soon to be son.
'He's going go fucking rape me! And then leave me for dead! Well I would rather live with my magic as an outcast than die in this situation!' I pour my magic into the internal wounds hearing the bone snap back into place and the lung reverse its damage, being able to breath again I let out a short sigh of relief before spinning around and kicking Vernon in the face, given he tried to press his dick into my exposed ass, it the hit made him fall backwards making the other occupants scream, as payback I extended a finger and yelled with every fibre of my being "Separate Confinia Alvum!" As I watched in strange fascination that the entrails expelling curse actually worked wandless on the fat bastard of a child rapist, blood splattered the floor as the mans stomach ripped open under the power of the curse, organs fell to the floor as the life suddenly died in Vernons eyes and the other two ran outside screaming, I turned dispassionately to the others and cast strong memory charms on them as they ran down the street and made sure they wouldn't ever return to Privet Drive, reminding me slightly of old Lockhart, before dressing and collecting my things and setting the house ablaze with a nice added touch of shouting "Morsmordre!" 'Strange how that spell works without a dark mark' and leaving the street.
"On second thought, I best check the student's before I start this, they had best not have blown up anything with their poor excuse for potion making!" He said and turned behind him to the bookcase, he paused for a moment and deftly attempted to pluck the book titled 'Darkest Arts Of The Mind by Michael Ainsworth' out from its' careful placement along the shelf, however as he pulled it loose a click could be heard and the section of the wall and case gave way to reveal a hidden passage behind it, smirking to himself Severus strolled into the gloom towards his class room's secret vantage point, he only used this at times when he was too busy with volatile ingredients to supervise his seventh years therefore his attention was needed elsewhere, under the guise of self study sessions he would walk through this passage and spy on the students to make sure they didn't blow anything up in his absence.
They nodded in silence as they strode up to the boarded up door to cast a brief Alohomora in order to gain entrance, carrying the whimpering child into the darkness of its' depths and towards the school to meet its' headmaster.
Harry does so before walking briskly out the office with him, heading into the depths of the bank, thinking over how to best get revenge over his precious headmaster and old friends.
He quickly put on his abandoned half moon spectacles as well as cast a refreshing charm on his robes, before stretching and clicking his tender and aching muscles appropriately, though a sudden urgent knock on his door brought him out of his mundane musings quite abruptly.
After snatching it up to examine the rude request he gasped and rushed to his store room to find the appropriate potions, 'Lily is going to have an heir to the vile Potter line? if it has contracted that bastards' vampirism, I will butcher him for potions ingredients regardless of if I get sent to Azkaban for the deed, no child of her's should have to deal with the scrutiny despite it being a Potter' "I will be there momentarily Fawkes go back to the office if you must".
'I can't believe I am going through this, to have James Potter's son my ward, if Lily hadn't run off with the bastard, I would not be doing this or if I hadn't met Harry the moment he were born and felt his power being worth such a risk as this, letting me become the hunted of Fae, Death Eaters and Vampire alike, he is making more work for me in a day than even the hundreds of student's manage in a year, I will at least raise his many gifts and potential right I hope for all our sakes' he thought as he began chopping ingredients and stiring the simmering concoction the precise amount of times as he mentally went through the steps.
Albus caught up to the trio along the forth floor staircase as the student's began to disembark from the Entrance Hall towards their respective lessons, he gave a tender smile and wave to Harry who had poked his little head out from beneath the folds of Severus's robes, his eyes wide in curiosity, as if he could see the very magic constantly thrumming in the air around them usually invisible until made corporal through the manifestation of one's will.
Sonia walked briskly towards the lift grates at the end of the corridor as they slid open to reveal Madam Umbridge in her usual obnoxiously pink robes, before she could pass her by hoping not to be caught in conversation with them woman, Dolores tapped her on the arm with a simple "Heh hem" trying to gain her attention, 'What does this woman need from me?' Sonia thought in frustration, she made eye contact despite this, offered a polite smile with her eyebrows raised in question.
Albus eyes riveted sharply to her own before interrupting "We are leaving for Gringotts in half an hour, gather the Order and meet me in the Leaky then" before she could reply he spelled the ink off his face and poked Fawkes awake, who squawked indignantly in slight outrage before jumping up from his perch on to Dumbledores outstretched arm "Old friend, take us to Gringotts", in a flash of flame he was gone, leaving a stupified Minerva in his office.
"Ah! Albus, I trust you are well? I am here to evaluate the risk of young Mr Potter and his new adoptive guardians transformation, am I intruding?" Dedalus asked with a calm smile, "No dear boy we were just awaiting news from Sirius here" Albus gestured to Sirius and pointing out Harry "However the boy is in Remus's arms safe and sound as you can see".
"Well it was very tough to capture that and we are only safe whilst the thing is sedated and feed magic through the complicated rune patterns, I do advise it be one of your forms simply because it is unmatched in its element, an easy kill given it is too sedated to fight back under its seal" Griphook responded.
As I walk down the stairs I hear the usually background noise of the TV 'Vernon must be watching the news whilst Petunia is in the kitchen' figuring that out I walk to the kitchen intent on getting some breakfast at least before I leave for Gringotts.
'She better not have done what I think she tried' she thought as she replied "Sure Kingsley, why would I need to be informed of this investigation?", he walks to her and lowers his voice "Because she was caught attempting to steal the book of addresses for young wizards and witches in your office" Dedalus sucked in a sharp breath.
Harry just gulped as he put his hand through barrier and touched the creatures face, he sighed as he felt no sudden reaction to his draining of the creatures life force, it visibly withered unmovingly floating in the water and died under sedation, even the goblins sighed appreciative of that threat being dealt with 'I'm helping them remove threats to them it seems but I can still choose my forms and strengths' Harry thought now brimming with renewed hunger.
The goblins just laughed darkly, before adding "You have another four choices from our selection Lord Potter we decided give you an extra choice as I believe we have a few more powerful creatures to help you in your endeavor and we wish to see how your Lordship will withstand it", reminding him to keep his wits which was extremely difficult now that his senses became over crowded with other entities merging their instincts to his, almost like a mental patient with multiple personalities were suddenly devised in his head all talking to him at once each with a different and more gruesome personality.
"My lord, could you spare Lily Potter your wrath if you only need the boy?" Severus pleaded, Voldemort laughed coldly "ahh Sseverus you surprise me with your rather bold request, I will spare the mudblood if she yields, if she fights I have no patience and will kill them all, this isss a promise Severus" "Thank you for indulging my impertinence my Lord" Snape bowed and left the audience chamber in a hurry.
Sirius could be seen trudging silently through the depths of Knockturn Alley, carrying Peter in his new cage, as the milling shady occupants eyed the auror in both fear, hostility and open disgust before disregarding him completely as he walked steadily towards the Alley entrance.
Severus withdrew a vial at the prompt "Yes Flora, we can begin it once the blood letting is done but we have scheduled this for tonight in an enclosed space to minimize danger to the children currently attending".
Harry contemplated for a moment about what he would do but after the agressive snarl that was sent his way he just stepped forward and drained him too until he combusted from the strain leaving a rather messy display of dust in its wake all over Harry royally pissing him off.
"Alright let's finish our meal then and I will feed him before he sleeps and I go to the study to finish what I should have this morning, you might want to get some more rest too you look considerably tired Lil's" she was about to nod when she felt a faint tremor in the wards as if someone had just been admitted, her gaze snapped to James when they heard a knock on the door downstairs.
Murmurs rose around the Great Hall as Severus purposely strode up towards the high table, locking eyes with a scowl at Dumbledore, who's deep blue eyes merely twinkled rapidly at his potion masters approach.
As if cursed by the gods a black portal burst to life inside the room, seemingly connected to the dungeons and in strode a confident Osiris, smirking slightly at Blaise for his naivety.
"Move aside you silly girl, give me Harry Potter and you shall live, give me him and you shall be rewarded" Voldemort said as he loomed over them with his wand trained on her chest and Harry bundled within it, She pleaded "Not Harry! Take me instead! He is but a child!" "Lord Voldemort doesss not give second chances, Crucio!" He snarled angrily "Hand over the boy!" She wails in agony on the floor as she begins to convulse under the spell and Harry cries louder as her grip tightens unintentionally, "To think thisss brat sssaid to destroy me is a mere half blooded vampire it seems I will yet again conquer immortality with its' demise, Lord Voldemort grows tired of your filthy mudblood gamess Avada Kedavra!" She slumps lifeless with Harry crying hysterically in her lifeless arms.
"Hun, I think he wants some attention he's had enough of keeping me company this morning" James said softly as he walked over to kiss her on the forehead and grab Harry before he started to do her more damage.
Suddenly a very loud noise could be heard outside of the Great Hall, including a muffled wail and an even louder shout of angry voices, one could be easily distinguishable to the occupants as the chattering stopped to hear the explosive arguement outside.
Sitting around, casually chatting in its dank and dusty depths, the smell of stale food, smoke and alcohol immediately assaulting his now heightened senses, causing him to grimace darkly, the only partial comfort being the boundless power fluctuations he could feel, emanating from the cores of each occupant, strengthening his desire to reach for it and sap it for his own.
"Come in!" He called slightly apprehensively, 'nothing good would come from such an aggressive knock' he thought privately as the door opened. "Ah Minerva, to what do I owe the pleas.." before he could even finish his sentenced her rumpled and seemingly pale appearance stormed over to him in a flurry of deep green tartan robes, waving her wand viciously as she went.
Griphook actually smirked at the squawk of dismay Osiris let out at being bound and held at wand point, "Think you are leaving before Lord Potter has finished his ritual? Think again, we will also make you bound to him via contract and telepathic bond, we do not take cheap words as assurance unlike this Lord, you will be bound, forced into an Unbreakable Vow to ensure allegiance and suffer to telepathic bond, he will know your secrets as we do, you will not betray his kindness, as we wish for amicable ties with him that is the only reason we are allowing you freedom but it will still come at a steep price thief!" He spat as he climbed out of the cart with the other goblin guards.
"You've knackered her out you know?" He sighed and bopped Harry on the nose with his finger gently for it, eliciting another soft giggle before taking his nail to his upper chest, making him bleed gently for Harry to latch on and have his first feed contently.
"Guess we will find out how much shit I am in at Gringotts, speaking of which.." the bus stopped and opened "The Leaky Cauldron, Harry this is your stop!" Stan says jubilantly remembering the last time Harry was on, "Thanks" I mutter as I rise and tap my trunk and follow out the door with the trunk floating behind me 'note to self wordless is another ability I have seemed to awoken'.
At hearing that Peter was home Sirius eyes blazed in repressed fury and suddenly his wand was in his hand as he walked in past a dumbfounded Remus without explanation, he walked through the deep green corridor into the lounge directly in front of him and spotted Wormtail obscured by this mornings edition of the Daily Profit, the front page was bearly visible to Sirus standing silently in the door way, he could make out the familiar gate emblazoned with a large P in the moving picture, atop read 'Potter's Sacrifice Brings Dark Lord Downfall!' "I don't know why you bothered reading that Peter you already knew it happened, didn't you!" He shouted at the Wormtail who shakily placed the paper down on the chair he sat it, "SsssSirius.. I don't know what you are talking about! James and Lily are our friends! How dare you insinuate my involvement with their murder!" He stuttered and fidgeted as he tried to defend himself, Remus turned sharply to Sirius at this "I would like to hear your reasoning first Sirius, weren't you their Secret Keeper, that's what we were led to believe?" He enquired with blazing gold eyes of the werewolf within him, Sirius laughed at absurdity "I was Remus but then I suggested to James that I was too easily a target as they would expect his best friend to know their location should I be caught, I suggested Peter to take the role of Secret Keeper, so is the only one able to bring Voldemort through the Fidelius Charm! I was there this morning with Snape of all people, I saw their bodies including the dark Lords, what the paper will tell you is Harry is missing because we had him taken to Dumbledore, I was coming to ask you to go and take care of him at Hogwarts as I have to get to the ministry as we decided to have Snape and the School Harry's guardian given he has been born a Dhampire, but as the Rat didn't bother to run I will take him for questioning too as it is highly suspicious!" He shouted as lunged for the man in the chair.
"Yes it is, Headmaster we must talk now in your office this is of the upmost importance, we will wait for you there with your permission" Severus said tightly, trying to keep a hand on the infant to prevent it from falling out of his grasp.
The snake now awake and attempting to struggle and bite him with deadly Basillisk venom, which would actually kill his cells if it landed despite his resilience, poison of that calibre was only negated by beings like Hedwig and Fawkes who weren't presently here.
Plenam Pecunia Solvere - Silver Full Body Bind, Auror's use this hex to ensnare and capture rogue werewolves.
He strode idly through the halls as the groggy inhabitants of Hogwarts steadily filled the corridors, heading towards the Great Hall, he occasionally overheard snatches of conversation as he traversed down to the main entrance "Do you remember what we had to do for Flitwick's essay on Cheering Charms?" A third year Hufflepuff girl asked her friend as they walked slowly to the hall, "Oi! Do you think Slytherin will win again? I really hope the Quidditch cup goes to someone else this year, the snakes have been unbeaten for years!" A fifth year gryffindor shouted down to his friends from the fifth floor staircase.
"A recent homeowner present beside the famous Harry Potter's muggle residence, namely Squib Ms Arabella Figg (41), alerted the Auror's of a disturbance within the neighbourhood of Little Whinging, Surrey at the early hours of 9am this morning."
"I would rather how talented son be studious and embrace and hone his abilities than be as dangerous as Sirius can be or learn to prank others so carelessly, if they could balance themselves I wouldn't have a problem with them but I fear 'Dog-father' will go the mutts head, we will have to talk with them soon if they want an active role in the child's development, that being said if anyone is up to the task its them" she murmured as she stroaked Harry's red mop of hair lightly as he lay in her arms watching her sleepily.
Upon closer inspection into the room it had appeared Harry Potter was awake and panting heavily trying to remove the leather straps keeping him in place along the alter, Ragnok moved to stand beside him, surveying him clinically before nodding and saying "Lord Potter if you are aware of the previous event outside it would be wise to not linger here whilst you recover your magic, Griphook has that thief Osiris taken the vow of loyalty to Lord Potter? Is he mind linked?" He enquired, Griphook himself just smirked voraciously "It is done Ragnok, they can leave".
Stretching I pull on my usual faded jean's and oversized t-shirt, making sure I'm at least presentable before heading downstairs to find out what the fuss is about besides the obvious.
Hearing this Harry banished the charm and nodded to Ironfang as he entered and was escourt down the marble hall, attempting to ignore the subtle interest shown by all the Goblins present working their way through the days clientele.
"I targeted both their memories of the recent day and attempted to both fry the memories of me and their inherent magical gifts, if they could not establish a connection with their gifts, they would lose them, in Ms Tonks case her metamorphamagus ability and Mr Shackelbolt's wandless casting ability making them virtually useless and easy to dispose of if the need arose, neurology is always intriguing when combined with the mind arts despite how muggle the concept is" Dumbledore said with airy tone.
His golden eyes slanted slightly at the irises becoming akin to a cat's, giving him the accompanied night vision (an impressive feat of transfiguration ol' McGonagle would be proud he thought), as well as glowed with a tinge of red and silver as the other thermal and divine sense spells layered his senses giving him a full view of all the occupants hiding within the shadows of the chamber ahead of them.
As the pain hit it's crescendo, I blacked out, the last thing I hear is a crash from down the hall, it seems I woke them up after all..
"Wow so Hagrid cursed my Hedwig, my clever girl is more powerful if her block was removed and I have a family that is still alive though missing despite most of the names I can see being known Death Eater's it seems, what's the bet on grandmother Euphemia hiding in Malfoy Manor Griphook?" Harry inquiried after skimming the names briefly.
Albus nodded and stowed his wand away content with his spell work and sat down in his chair once again to appear busy until the wolf barged into his office.
"In any case I want him to take out that Soul Reaper in the bank to give him more than the ability to steal magic but to use Soul Magic at a higher level than us beings can, I will train him including his Necromancy until his next year starts at Hogwarts and I will introduce him to three members of the junior night court that is sometimes held at my residences, they are of the Vampire, Drow and Lamia races so I have no doubt they will be useful if they are adolescents that can be glamoured to attend with him, good day gentleman and remember to inform me when he wakes" he swiftly left the room leaving Osiris, Lucius, Draco and Blaise to stare awkwardly at the door he departed from.
James didn't go straight to the door, he picked up his invisibility cloak before edging along the hallway and down the stairs, he sensed a cold blooded and warm blooded creature on the other side of the door, putting him on high alert, no one he knew was cold blooded but he could guess from the scent the warm blooded of the two was the rat Wormtail, the other was thick with the stink of Dark Magic, he could only guess who it was knocking.
A Messorem is the product of a hybrid birth between a Dementor and an Elder Lich or Higher Necromantic Ritual, it is a variation of the legendary Soul Reaper that Death himself is meant to be, it's bloodlust is unrivalled as well as it's instinct to behead, some say these rare beings are the reason for the fabled Headless Horseman to exist as even in undeath, the victim of a Messorem will still be struck from its shoulders.
"You would be correct it is a telepathic loyalty bond, they wouldn't let me out without some kind of chains to prevent hindering Harry only strengthening him".
It only took a few minutes to find the correct one, number 21 stood at the far end of the alley and was easily the one most unkempt and in need of repair, it was clear how the two could afford it, it was incredibly cheap because it was so close to falling apart in it's degree of disrepair, as the ministry took it upon themselves to add the bylaw restrictions on lycanthropes working in normal society, Moony suffered with the depravity of his situation as if it was as normal as breathing, having very little of his own despite being qualified as a master of Defense, 'it is outrageous but not much could be done to fight that ridiculous law', he thought, though Sirius saw it for what it was, a direct attack on those with creature blood, 'heading the charges was the ministry hag Delores Umbridge!' He hoped she would croak sooner or later she seemed to a vendetta against werewolves.
"Harry is in danger Remi if not by Albus then maybe Voldemort, I fear he might have came into his inheritance and it might end up a shock for us rather than how it ended up for James and Lily, you remember how powerful they ended up being instead of the small power boost a wizard normally earns, maybe their mix unlocked his creature blood line, only a pure blood would have those dormant Gene's maybe Lily mixing was enough to activate it?" Sirius added with a touch of fear in his voice.
"Now boy's let's see if my abilities can make you delirious from sexual pleasure despite it being my first time and with men of all things!" Harry said with a smirk.
"SILENCE!" Albus shouted at the remaining occupants in the room, cutting off the chatter effectively, "I believe it best if you all could go about your day like any other quietly, I understand you have questions but now is not the time, I expect some will inform their parents of this but I beg you not do so until the end of the day as you have classes and I expect you all to be in class on time at nine am, for your first lessons of the day, staff I will debrief you of what I learn later, good day to you all" he finished in a calm voice as he confidently hurried out of the Hall to his office leaving the rest of the students to grumble as they picked up their bags and headed towards their first lessons, the teacher's took a moment to eye one another in worry as they followed suite out of the Hall.
He put down his list, stretched and stood up "Breakfast will be shortly it seems, I hope the Elves have made a nice selection of spread today" he mumbled as he proceeded to walk out the his office and towards the whinding staircase.
"Mrs Kettleburn is it? I would like to know if James Potter ever had the child he was expecting, can you find records of this? It is imperative I remove the threat it could place on the ministry!" Dolores stated trying to intimidate Sonia into giving the information.
As he handed the cage to a grateful Sirius, Remus mumbled "We can't have you running from this therefore Obiecto Speciem! Obice Transfiguro!" Warding the cage against Peter's Animagus transformation and Apparition, effectively trapping the stunned creature in place, "Sirius, let me know what happens with the investigation?" He said with a lump in his throat as he punched the nearest wall allowing it to crumble in the wake of his strength.
Peverell Vault: 700,200 Galleons, 20 Sicles and 70 Knuts (Unlockable), 300 artifacts and 50 rare tomes remaining.
"Damn girl now that is an even more beautiful form, I will curse them all for what they did to you my love, things will be changing shortly, I know Fawkes can flash out, how do you?" Harry asked intrigued, Hedwig jumped off and spun in the air creating a mini blizzard of snow before disappearing in response causing Harry to laugh, "Now that is dealt with shall we proceed Griphook?" Harry asked as he turned back to the Goblin who was slack jawed clearly astounded he got to meet a legendary Ice Phoenix, one of the rarest among Pheonix types.
"I will be sure to not anger the man too much, he is a good werewolf despite the times they are under, there's not many good ones these days!" Dedalus beams, "Can we use your floo Sonia?" He asks gesturing to the grate next to her, "I doubt it is keyed to Hogwarts, you will have to use the Atrium floo to get there as it's big enough for the both of you too, mine is only used for urgent messages, it's too small for actual transport, sorry" she says as they laugh and walk out towards the lifts.
Sirius Black, was a pure blood in every sense of the word even in utter despair as he was now he looked ravishing beneath those dark dangling locks and short stumbled beard, his crystal blue eyes alight with angst, hostility, betrayal and some other intense emotions Severus couldn't read at first glance, though he would be a fool to misinterpret or underestimate the man before him, he was still in every sense the aggressive young bully he encountered on that first train ride to Hogwarts, experience told him Black would do something drastic right now and only experience told him to keep his guard up despite being the innocent here, he thought maybe he shouldn't have bated the man however he was also the perfect opponent to let off the tension he had acquired since leaving the school.
Severus finds little Harry, Sirius intervenes, they both wish to find Pettigrew and protect the last of the Potter line!
He noticed the guards tense as he neared "How strange" he muttered as he walked up the marble steps towards them. "Stop, You will be searched magically before entering!" One of the guards shouted at him holding up a whirling rodded instrument in one hand and a spear in another, threateningly. "Besides this rat cage spelled to keep the occupant inside I am not carrying anything illegal and am not here to foolishly attempt to steal gold! Do you dare accuse a Black of attempted robbery or an Auror for that matter?!" Sirius shouted back in equal rage, the goblin guard just smirked "No sir it is simply protocol in this time of unease surely a pure blood of such a prestigious noble line would sequest to our security procedures, we mean no offence after all" he said calmly this time but with his eyes gleaming in amusement, "Fine hurry up, I have business to attend to, do not attempt to remove any enchantment on this cage it is an Animagus I am bringing to the ministry for interrogation after my business here is concluded" Sirius sighed, the goblin nodded its' ascent before scanning him head to toe with the rod, whirling irritatingly in Sirius's face, "He is clear, he may pass" the goblin said to the other stationary whom nodded and opened the gold door for him in a short bow.
Everyone shivered at this with open disgust on their faces, Remus snarled with his eyes glowing gold despite being in his human form "You dare do this to my cub! Mark my words Albus you have lost allies this day!" Both Remus and Sirius shouted, when Sirius managed to calm down slightly he asked "What are your goals towards my godson now he is perceived as a threat to all of the ministry?" Onyx eyes glaring hard at Albus with repressed fury and his occlumency shields tightly bound.
As the Goblins watched the scene they detected a faint burning smell before the magic levels surrounding Harry dispersed, clearly it really was etched into him though the faint glowing of these new patterns never dimmed, they could only guess the magical abilities that Harry had gained needed time to adjust in his body, meaning this was probably the first of the noticable changes yet to come, one couldn't say how long it would take him to perfect and assimilate these changes though, he could be asleep for a very long time or he could wake however they would need to perform the ritual to remove what was blocking his innate gifts immediately or he would probably never wake with a cap on his abilities as strong as Dumbledore had placed on him it was dangerous to leave it.
"Poppy start a C section it is the only way to save them both! Albus focus on spelling the blood from expelling, I will keep healing the current uterus damage and making the clean incision until the little fiend is out of her!" Severus shouted, James glared venemously at this but couldn't stop him or they would both die, all three quickly got to work.
After what was only a few minutes she stood facing the entryway to Familial Affairs, her expression, one of hunger as she pulled the door handle and poked her head in the office. "Ah Aurors Black and Shackelbolt? I was not aware some one would be here apart from Mrs Kettleburn, did I just miss her?" She sighed in a girlish manner making the occupants' hairs stand on end, "What the fuck are you doing here Umbridge!" Sirius growled darkly, his eyes flashing dangerously.
He stumbled and fell towards her crying silently in anguish, trying to embrace her and the probably dead child in her decaying grasp. "Fffuck no Lily, my sweet Lily, I tried to have you spared my love why! Why did he mean so much to you that you threw your life away for some vampires brat, you silly girl, why did this have to happen I loved you dearly, ever since I saw you showing that disgusting muggle sister of yours those pretty flowers you made just for us, why!" He half screamed in shaking in anguish as he grasped her cold body tightly to his chest.
Paddy attacked Voldemort as soon as the door opened, engaging in a voiceless battle with him, shooting purple jets of electricity from its hands at the dark lord, intent on removing the threat to the new young lord of the family.
Pulchritudo Sanguis Ligatis - Blood Bind Glamour, it casts a glamour our the biological signature of a person so that they may hide in human form unless a person of their blood removes it, the caster or themselves.
Griphook led Harry silently through the golden double doors beside his office with a troop of a dozen armed goblins, intent on descending into the bowls of Gringotts, as they jumped into cart as if they were heading to a vault he turned to Harry and said "We are first heading to the feeding room for you to select some creatures before we take your blocks off, you will need your strength before you go through that ritual Lord Potter afterwards if you wish we can also unlock the Peverell vault where a number of Dark Magic and Necromancy tomes are held for you, it is imperative at least with the gift of being a Necromancer, you collect your personal book from the collection to aid you in using the ability properly, some may call you a Death Master as that is another term related to your art, only Death's chosen children may learn the language and the art, you are one such destined for it, we know nothing more of it ourselves however it is a long lost skill of very few".
Dumbledore chuckled to himself as he watched the little one play, "Now Harry it is time we got down to business" he said as he gently pulled the rattle to gain the child's attention, "I assure you this will not hurt a bit! You will thank me later I'm sure, we can't have you running off now can we? I do this to protect you, Liga Animo!" A jet of silver light hit the boy square in the temple, who promptly fell into sleep and slumped in the mans grasp, dropping the rattle with a thunk under the mans desk.
