“Is that what I have been doing?” The old man looked thoughtful. “It would hardly be a waste of my time, now would it?”
A few sniffles sounded this time; some of the younger students were growing teary-eyed. Ron’s hand descended on her shoulder.
Ginny nodded. She couldn’t keep from staring at him, just looking and looking as though she’d never looked at him before. It was like watching a sunset right at the perfect moment when the hues of orange slipped in between pinks. To look away would be to miss it forever.
And now she was Ginny. Not Weasley. He wasn’t sure when that had happened.
Harry held it off for a final beat of his heart and then lurched forward, throwing his hands up. He was gratified to see Draco flinch back at the movement. “Fine. Fine, Malfoy, here it is. I have nothing to offer you. Is that what you’re looking for?
Beside Harry, Draco shivered.
Utter shock stabbed through the lattice of Veritaserum in those grey eyes, but just as quickly a tangible relief flooded into its place. “I can’t. I wasn’t there to see it.”
Hermione propped her head on one hand and let the other slide over his chest until she felt the rumpled sheets beneath him on the other side. The line of his waist curved nicely under her fingers. “You know, I think I am too.”
The room was deathly quiet. The people above him were holding their breaths. Malfoy’s voice was deafening in the stillness. “It was…”
Harry went to the hearth. “They got here early this afternoon. Luna’s calling everyone in. Oliver’s been here for days. It’s…” He fidgeted. “Well, you’ve arrived. So.”
“Just fulfilling your bloody duty to the cause then, are you?” Draco’s fingers tightened around Harry’s wrist to the threshold of pain. “That’s so magnanimous of you. Let me be the first to thank you.”
He made his way quickly back to the doorway and peered out, adjusting the aperture so that the door was only open about a foot. He would have to close it with a spell; it wouldn’t do to get too close to the snake. Blaise stuck his head out and hissed again, the sounds made bolder by his growing control over the situation. Control… Not nearly. But he could pretend. He left the doorway and circled the room again, running his hand over the wall. It would take precision; he’d only get one shot at this once the snake arrived.
Seamus failed the first time he attempted to speak, and tried again. “Found them with him. They…” He didn’t like the memory, any of it. “Spells.”
Why, why couldn’t he have just loved Theodore in return? Then at least it would be done, and it would have been pure, and he wouldn’t still see his friend’s face in his dreams and know that he’d tainted him.
*		*		*
“Does it hurt less?” She had to swallow before she could go on, and for a few seconds, all she could do was gesture. “When he’s near you. Does it…”
“It’s too high, Draco,” he muttered. Bonds made and then snapped. Made with the intention to snap them later. He couldn’t look at Draco anymore and looked at the floor instead. His legs felt weak. “And yes, I am going to be the judge this time.”
Harry actually smiled at her, much wider and more adoring than anything she’d seen this night. “I’ll thank him for the both of us.” He crossed toward the door and glanced back, eyes warm. “Be back to take you to your room.”
Hannah’s wand… Luna’s… where was it? Perhaps someone had— Hermione searched the littered street, looking everywhere except at the body in front of her. It wasn’t Hannah. It
“We’re fine,” Fred said, smiling gently. “We’re fine. Gin’s here, too.”
*		*		*
Harry took Draco’s chin in his hand and turned his face to the right. “There. See it?”
“Thank you for not leaving me.”
Harry smiled. “Yes, it can be.”
When Harry finally led her back down the hall, Ginny couldn’t think of a thing to say. There was plenty, obviously, but no way to utter it. The halls had grown darker and Luna’s voice echoed off the stones like a murmur in a cave. Ginny had no idea what time it was, but she could hear the roll of thunder outside. It almost sounded like the grinding of staircases.
Was Harry courting such a loss? Ginny was on her way, with every intention, as far as he knew, of going through with the spell. Their bond would not only be spiritual, it would be tempered by the oldest linking spell he had ever heard of, set to aid in the defeat of the most powerful enemy anyone had faced in centuries. It would bring Ginny and him together in such a way that the idea woke Harry in the middle of the night with his knuckles white from clutching at his sheets. He had read through the spells over and over, committed them to memory and then shoved them from the dreams they invaded. Should the two of them be ripped apart after undertaking such a fearsome binding… Harry’s body physically hurt from the implications.
This time Harry tugged Draco down to the sheets, flat across the bed at all the wrong angles, intent upon the peak he knew was coming. His own foot hung over the edge, toes cold, Draco’s legs a tensing twist around his sides and his abdomen taut with the effort of raising his hips off the mattress. Harry found his mouth, his tongue, even a vocal sigh at the contact. He pulled back to breathe, just touching Draco’s lips with his own as they moved, air rushing in hot, uneven gusts between them.
The spell was off Goyle’s wand before Blaise heard the words. He dove out of the way, rolling into the hallway he’d just left. A muttered curse sounded around the corner and Blaise pulled himself painfully to his feet. He couldn’t use his wand. It was only a fool’s chance, but if Gregory Goyle was as dim as he remembered him being—and Blaise was beginning to doubt this—then there was the possibility that the rest of the Death Eaters still had no idea there was anything amiss. If he used any magic they didn’t recognise, however, they’d be on him instantaneously.
The quiet was too much. Draco made himself move, made himself walk around the bed, past Finnigan and his stunned expression, past Pomfrey on the right. Harry caught his arm, but Draco forced him away.
He wanted to tell her it was all his fault. But he couldn’t stomach everyone else in the room looking at him like he’d personally struck Blaise down. In the end, Harry nodded and let her think what she wanted to think.
But even that thought was repugnant now. The suspicion made her feel unclean. Ashamed. She’d seen real fear in his eyes; it had driven extra force into her swing, sparking hotly through her and leading her to slam a branch into the head of another person. For all she knew, she’d killed the girl. For Malfoy.
Draco picked his way along, running a hand over the smooth chalkstone, and nearly stumbled over what he’d been seeking. Surrounded by a close circle of thorny shrubs, there was a narrow recess in the rock, low to the ground and darker than the night sky. Draco halted outside, heard Ginny stop behind him, and studied the opening. The bushes had been undisturbed for some time; no broken branches or scattered leaves. Unless the last visitor had been very, very careful, no one had been here for months. Draco crouched down and turned to Ginny. He was gratified to see that she was already perched low on the balls of her feet, swaying slightly to keep her balance.
Noise. So much noise.
Ginny had pulled back almost before the Healer responded. She tucked an arm tightly around herself, looking as though she wanted nothing better than to become part of the back of her chair. “Nothing,” she whispered. “Never mind.”
Still… he had one other avenue that he felt he must take. He had saved his own questions for last.
She didn’t know what Hannah had told them. But it had been a trap. A Dark Mark woven into Hannah’s very flesh, set to erupt at the slightest touch. Perhaps rigged for Hermione’s specific touch. She pressed her hands over her face. They couldn’t have set it for her, could they? Did they know her that well?
He broke off, the crack in his voice evident. Ginny wanted nothing but to kiss him, soothe the fear out of the body she knew so well, allow strength and vitality back in where it belonged. She splayed her fingers over his shoulder, giving him the slightest urge downward.
Everyone seemed to know in much too short a time.
The other girl glanced up and then away. As if… Hermione frowned. As if she were avoiding looking at her. “Is something wrong?”
“Hold her. Whatever you do, don’t let her stop playing!”
He turned down the long hallway, and the voice rang above, echoing off thick stones and arches in bell tones. So fragile. He could almost hear the person behind it, a shadow very familiar to him but with the untouchable grace of enchantment.
The rest were out there, perhaps moulding in Grimmauld’s deserted corridors, or scattered across the world in the hands of people who had fled England. Perhaps in Voldemort’s clutches, as his father had always intended. Draco wondered briefly if those intentions had changed at all in the dank cells of Azkaban, and then the stab in his chest was too great and he pushed the thoughts of his father away.
Movement in the forest behind her caught Draco’s eye. He made out another robed figure, coming between the trees. An unexpected shard of fear spiked through him.
didn’t even know the meaning of such an emotion. It was impossible to imagine this circumstance in anything but her wildest dreams, and she would not allow her stresses and fears to catalyse it into reality. She knew Draco Malfoy.
Draco paused for the briefest of instances. Harry thought he might turn.
“I can feel how exhausted you are.” Blaise’s voice was hoarse, but wondering all the same. Again, Seamus felt a stab of the surreal. It was as though he were fighting off a bad dream that kept sneaking him into the realm of sleep when all he wanted was to wake up.
“I respond to what I see, Potter,” Draco rejoined immediately, lifting his head off the sheets. He resembled a snake, lithe and gorgeous. Spitting angry in a mortal flash. “I suppose this is all part of it.” He gestured, a furious sweep of one hand, and Harry’s irritation flared. He sat back and Draco winced slightly at the movement.
Luna’s voice came pleasantly into Hermione’s head. She could almost see the strange, flighty girl’s smile.
Harry’s shout was desperate. “Seamus, stop!”
Seamus was there to get her, he said, to bring her to the castle. She’d never been so glad to see anyone in her life. It was easier to move on when someone was there moving on with her. Hannah’s death was easier to face. She gave the news in breaking, rasping words, and Seamus… Seamus squeezed her hand. Rubbed her arms. Gathered her close when she collapsed under the weight of it. Afterward, walking, cautious Apparition—with no sign of pursuit—and simple conversation calmed Hermione so profoundly that the last few days went dreamlike in her memory.
He heard Ginny shift suddenly, and dragged his head up. “What is it?”
It felt damned good to be inside Draco again, like a taste he hadn’t been able to catch as it evaded the tip of his tongue. He suddenly found it full-bodied, all over the inside of his mouth, with barely time to exhale his relief, to start at the shock of having it before it slipped away again. He reached between them, nudging his fingers against Draco’s soft belly and sliding down, wrapping his hand tightly around him, and feeling the wordless, desperate sounds Draco made. Draco’s entire body hitched against him. Harry could feel all five of his fingertips digging into his side.
And after today, Blaise would be finishing his own mission. The end of the war was marching ever nearer. Harry rubbed his face, breathing as slowly as he could manage.
“No.” His mind was a blank space, white and full of nothing. He shook his head slowly.
“Blaise, I don’t have him,” he muttered, pulling his hand away and breaking the physical connection. “I don’t… It was sex. It doesn’t make him mine. You damn well know that.”
“How did you get her this far?” Moody’s gruff voice sounded. Fleur blinked as though she’d forgotten there were other people present.
“As you did when Draco first arrived at your godfather’s home. As you did when you were unable to save Lucius Malfoy, a man you detested almost as much as Voldemort. As you did, Harry, when you chose Draco’s friend to find Nagini. But it was never to do with Draco’s arrival, or his father, or Blaise Zabini. Draco Malfoy himself was at the centre of it all.”
Ginny swallowed, wondering if the strange light in his eyes was really for her. She’d thought it would be easy to tell, but now that she was faced with it, she had no idea.
He couldn’t rely on his wand. A spell wouldn’t stop her for nearly long enough. The best he could hope for was to continually startle her, and he hadn’t time for that. There was no way to know what would happen if he tried the Killing Curse. It might hit home. It might just as easily rebound and hit him instead.
“You fucking bastard!” Draco hit him, a solid punch to the shoulder, another to his ribs. Harry would have staggered backward if not for the renewed hold Draco had on his shirt. “No! Not on your damned life, I’m not going to—
Malfoy looked away. Shut his eyes as if remembering. “Infernus Hex. Caught and killed in Diagon Alley by Aurors.”
Harry shifted fitfully. “I just want to know they’re safe.”
He was two for three now.
Moody’s beady eye narrowed fiercely. “Just what are you insinuating, Potter?”
She would have found some modicum of satisfaction in that if not for the wrenching hurt in Harry’s expression.
Luna shuffled around in her seat and pointed. “I think I’ll go play that.”
And they don’t get remembered, they just bleed to death on the ground, and I watch them and I don’t die. Because it’s always about everyone else. It’s about you. When is it going to be about me? When is it going to be about what happens to me?”
At least this time Dumbledore had not hissed at him like a snake in the emerald-spangled darkness:
Harry jerked upright. “What am I supposed to do? Tell him to dial it back? It doesn’t work like that, they didn’t bond the way they were meant to and now it’s all wrong and broken and—” He shook his head, even more frustrated by her helpless expression. How could he possibly articulate something he only understood in a place where words didn’t exist? He stared down at his hands, as empty as hers and so much less capable. Shook his head again. “It doesn’t matter. It
Gregory Goyle dropped like a sack of stones.
Hands lifted him, trying to pry his fingers free of Blaise’s hand. Seamus snarled and lashed out, catching his antagonist hard across the face.
Neville and one of the Bulgarians who had arrived with him left to bring news to their followers, while Anya added a much needed freshness to battle strategising. The army that sat at her heels shoved the cliff face open a crack, and the other side wasn’t as dark as Harry had feared. They had numbers now, able bodies and experienced minds, and with that came hope, and the rousing of more able bodies from the refugees within the castle. Harry knew fighters: they would pull themselves together when there were others to stand with them.
“Irresponsible, slipshod, unconscionable behaviour!” Moody snapped. His good eye glowed fiercely, the other rolling wildly in its socket. “If he makes it back here alive, he’s going to regret it once I get hold of him!”
“Then why did it feel like I—” Draco didn’t finish the sentence. Harry was struck suddenly by the memory of Draco in pain, on the bed beneath him and babbling nonsense, grasping for him and yet curling away like it burned to touch.
Harry had never been so thankful for that as he was these days.
“I’ll be alright,” Hermione answered. It was still disorienting, to see Harry assuming his role right in front of her. In all these months, she’d never gotten used to it. Harry squeezed her hand and stood, drawing his fingers away and turning for the door. He looked first at Ginny, then at Malfoy as he exited. Ginny glared back blatantly, a fixed thinness to her mouth. But Malfoy didn’t look at Harry at all. And then Harry was gone.
Hermione nodded, her nose bumping his head. Likely they would have to tell everyone in the top echelons. Strategy would be formulated with this at the center. It was the loneliest Harry had ever felt.
Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. Her face went passive, and gradually, Luna’s song changed. Hermione’s mouth curved back into a smile and she opened her eyes again. As Luna’s voice filtered down around him, Harry felt muscles he hadn’t even realised were tense smoothing, relaxing. His jaw ached belatedly.
Draco was silent, but it was too late; her bristles were out. Not because he was being a prick but because she was right. Why in Godric’s name was he being so difficult about this? Her old penchant for competition fluttered to life. “You do know it. He trusts you for some weird reason, after all.”
“Seamus!”
It was in the way Draco carried himself as he passed them on the stairs, and the way Harry nearly turned. Nearly. She hadn’t looked, but she knew he’d glanced back.
Malfoy turned away. “You ask the questions.”
**originally posted 8/2/13**
“I have information,” Fleur managed at last in a steadier voice. “Things she told me. As soon as she found us. She said it was better, better more than one person knew, so she told me. And Alain. She would have told us more, but…”
“Yes. And how do you feel now?”
Harry stirred the coals, dispersing the heat, and shut the door quietly on his way out.
*	*	*
He’d known what was expected of him for years. But his own death had never felt so real.
Harry shifted sideways into his path, forcing him to stop once more. “Wait. I wanted…” Harry drew a breath that echoed in Draco’s ears. “Ginny told me about your head.” He gestured and Draco’s hand flicked up involuntarily to touch the wound. “Do you need Pomfrey?”
But she could feel sleep tugging. She arched, stretching her back. Talking at least would keep her from keeling over for a time. “The place is shielded,” she stated without a lead-in. “I’ve heard even Moody wouldn’t be able to find his way back in if he stepped out the front door.” And then she realised she hadn’t a clue what kind of building she was talking about. “It does have a front door, doesn’t it?”
“Go, go!” Shacklebolt shouted. “Go after them, for Godric’s sake,
“It’ll be all right,” he said softly, not to her, but to them. “Listen to me. We’re going to get you out. I promise we’ll get you out.”
Harry lifted the flute. “So I’ll play it. This song—”
But looking at the man sagging in the chair, Harry could see that sincerity was all he had left.
This chapter's music: I'm afraid I couldn't find an audio version of this song to link to, but Seamus and Blaise's theme is "Away" by the Mediaeval Baebes. The song is absolutely haunting. Lyrics are:
good to have found you.”
There was nothing else to wait for. At any minute, the snake could—Blaise inched inside the black room, hugging the wall. The chamber felt huge in the darkness, an impossible abyss gaping at his feet. Blaise clenched his teeth, shut his eyes—it made no difference—and forced himself to keep moving. Slow steps, one and then another, a strange sideways shuffle toward… He had no idea what. The wall’s plane changed against his back as he went, an obtuse angle to another identical stretch of wall. The room was circular, then, or at least meant to appear so. The faint light streaming through the open doorway only made the rest of the room darker. Moving away from that pale shaft felt ludicrous. His palms began to sweat as the light got further and further from him.
“Draco.” he tried. His mouth felt so dry.
Draco stepped forward, backing Harry up a pace. “Oh, so we’re friends now? Potter, I was never your friend. You don’t even understand—” He jerked himself free of that dangerous tirade and pounced on another.
As for those younger than Pritchard, Malfoy could not give names.
Harry’s mouth opened and shut, and Draco caught the ripple of his throat as he swallowed. Harry glanced down, obviously reaching for composure of his own. But when he met Draco’s eyes again, there was little of the uncertainty Draco’d counted on. “No. I don’t think you’re alright.”
Harry lifted the cigarette, but did not bring it to his lips. The thought of smoking made his head reel. It would smother him, choke him, even if it were in a far kinder way than Seamus himself was doing. “It won’t heal him?”
Hermione followed her finger. “Wow, how long’s that been here?”
The words fuelled an anger they shouldn’t have; Harry heard accusation there and didn’t care that it was his own accusation against himself. He jerked away from the table, seeking some way to release the sudden gust of energy.
Hermione stared at Harry. At Ginny, and found her cheeks inexplicably red and her eyes downcast. Over by the door, Malfoy fidgeted uneasily. He wasn’t looking at anyone in the room, rather pointedly, Hermione thought. But before she could ponder further, Harry gripped her wrist insistently enough to startle her.
Death Eaters.”
“You.” Theodore took a gasping breath. “Have to leave, Draco.”
Except
Blaise turned away. “Draco, it’s done. It’s over with, whatever we do.”
“I brought something for you, too,” Harry said after a moment.
don’t say anything, Potter. Your waste of words is so typical.”
Ginny bristled at the flatness in his voice, and struggled to calm herself. He was right. He was always fucking right. The git. If he were going to turn her over to Voldemort, he would have done it already, and if he were planning some special betrayal for later, there wasn’t much she could do about it. Luna wouldn’t just let them run around in circles outside the hidden… fortress? They needed her. Harry needed her.
The old spells, however, did not emerge through wand usage, and they exacted a much higher toll. With age came strength; Blaise could feel it rising through him, stealing his senses. And it wasn’t his strength; it was Finnigan’s, flooding Blaise’s body, Blaise’s mind. There was no real way to research what was happening to them—the Order’s libraries were woefully inadequate and under siege—but Blaise had simply known. Perhaps that was part of the magic. He felt it in his marrow: his body changing when Finnigan touched it, pleasure he’d never in his life imagined, but poisoned by the shards of confirmation. Terrifying; he didn’t love Seamus, and this bond was bigger than what they had. What they
Harry was beginning to see that magical bonds were surprisingly easy to forge, and that they didn’t always break when the magic that had fashioned them did.
She said nothing for a long, ragged moment. “Harry, I swear on my life.”
Madam Pomfrey had approached quietly. He turned to her, but Finnigan stood up, blocking his view.
She stayed there on the floor listening to her brothers breathe, and Harry remained beside her, silent as snow. She couldn’t put a price on this. A thanks to Luna for calling them home, to Harry and Madam Pomfrey for taking care of them, to… to Draco for getting her here in one piece to see; the danger was nothing compared to knowing she wouldn’t have to say goodbye to yet another brother. They were both here, safe for some time at least. The relief left her weak. Even if she had no idea about her other three surviving brothers, at least this moment was unfettered by their absence. Fred and George had been returned to her.
The hand touching Draco’s face dropped, landing palm-up on the trampled grass. Draco dashed a hand across his eyes. Theodore’s pale irises went unfocussed, looking blindly into the rain. His body settled heavily in Draco’s arms.
Blaise stuck one of the candy bars in his mouth, and tucked the other two into his trouser pocket alongside his wand. He hardly tasted the chocolate. It was simply a source of energy at this point, and he wasn’t stupid enough not to partake. His body felt frighteningly devoid of protection, but it couldn’t be helped. He had to go into that fortress un-magicked or risk being caught immediately. Seamus skittered around the edges of his thoughts, but he pushed him away with days of practice and the knowledge that he had to do so.
“Find a way,” she gritted out. Harry looked up, startled by her tone.
She had fifteen minutes until she had to be in Llangollen. That was where Ginny had last been ‘seen.’ Then twenty minutes until Wensleydale, with Luna’s wand instead, provided she could find Hannah in time. If not, Hannah would simply go to Wensleydale herself and wait for her. There was a sign with a green dragon on it.
Draco rubbed at the vague bruise lying behind the bridge of his nose, shutting his eyes against all the grey and green. The wind coming in across the flatlands had turned chilly, hinting at more rain. His cloak, already wet, made an icy shell over his limbs. He longed for water, but hadn’t the energy to reach for the canteen.
Blaise crouched in the shadow of several bushes, eyes trained on the landscape below. The waters of Loch Ness shimmered like sapphires, and the cloud-studded sky carved periwinkle over the hills. The Muggle visitor centre down the slope was dark and caved in, all tumbled pylons and cracked roofing. Wind whipped through the new ruin, bearing ash trails away as it reached into hidden nooks and crannies.
Finally, he felt like he was invading and turned away, drawing a deep breath. Katie… It was horrible. But somehow, getting Fleur back alive and into her sister’s arms balanced it a little. He was too tired to handle more pain; the arrival of good news was so desperately needed that it was all he could react to just then.
But if Pansy had been right—and he knew she was—then this was exactly what the Death Eaters had been aiming for.
She looked back without flinching. He could feel the weight of her hand now, soft and comforting around his arm. “I don’t know.”
Su fired again, her expression much closer to trepidation this time, and immediately lunged to the side, throwing her wand toward the windows. The spell hit Morag’s arm and exploded right back off with a whine that jarred Harry’s teeth. The magic shot the way it had come, zooming after the wand, shattering it into splinters in midair.
“I have to do what will get the job done! I have to…” He faded out, took a deep breath.
“Harry.” Krum flashed him a small smile. He, too, glanced back, then turned to Harry again. “Do you have room for five of us?”
Harry pushed the door wide, and was gladdened by Hermione’s shriek as Neville leaned into the opening behind him. Hermione pulled Neville through the doorway, hugging him so tightly he let out an ‘oof!’ Whatever she had to say was lost to further hubbub when she noticed Krum, and by the time they all actually got inside the room, both Su and Morag were looking impatient.
For the first time, he wondered what Theodore had thought of himself.
Sorry that the princess wasn’t getting her prince after all. Ginny let out a laugh. “Well, I’m glad. Can’t say I really like the idea of this bond, now that I know so much more about it. I’m bloody relieved. And I’m damn well ticked off! Of all the bloody times for him to—” She was having no trouble with jealousy, but she
“Yes, he did.”
Absorbed.
Seamus stood alone near Blaise’s head. The others had given him a visible berth. Even Ginny stood slightly away, though she looked as if she wanted to be as close to Seamus as possible. Her entire body seemed to sway; over and over she would right herself only to lean toward Seamus again. Harry dropped his eyes. His gut hurt.
“It was ridiculous,” Hermione continued. “I mean, we’d not
Her singing voice rose, drifting up an octave and back down. Harry shook his head. “You give too much for this.”
But he couldn’t let him go. Everything inside was screaming against it, knowing that to open that door was to let Draco… “No.” He clamped down on the thought, hard. He wasn’t going there. Fuck Moody’s bitter little vengeances.
He felt it again, as faint as a dream, crawling along his inner arm.
Remus let it go, whether he believed him or not. He rubbed Harry’s back, up and down. For several moments, his breathing was a steady rise and fall against Harry. “Don’t bottle this up, Harry,” he whispered right in Harry’s ear. “It’s alright to give in. It’s alright to grieve.”
Draco said nothing. His hair was a tangled mess, full of light and the damp of sweat. His hands ceased their relentless adjusting and fell to his sides. He glanced up once, as though he couldn’t help himself.
Luna’s voice swept over his skin in rivulets, an effervescent embrace. Harry took a deep breath, shoved his hands into his pockets, and tried to think. He still didn’t know for sure, and as trustworthy as Hermione was, rumour was still rumour. What he had to do first was neither find Draco nor apologise to Seamus, but find out from Madam Pomfrey what the exact situation was. Even if it was dire.
Seamus’ dream woke him screaming, clutching at himself desperately. Too loud; Hermione remembered the utter horror his cries had stabbed into her. She’d calmed him as best she could, terrified at not finding a wound or any reason at all for his sudden explosion of fear. And it did not fade as a nightmare should have. For one nerve-wracking hour, Seamus grew more and more agitated, until finally he turned devastated eyes on her under the rising sun and said he had to leave.
As if she knew what he was thinking, she stepped back and snicked her wand up to point at his head. “All I have to do is cast one spell,” she warned. “One little spell and they’ll be all over you like the carrion that you are.”
Draco dashed rainwater and blood from his eyes. Ginny’s grip on his hand had become feverishly tight. He quickened his pace, pulling her forward through the trees, felt her fingers clench around his, and wondered briefly at the fact that he was still holding her hand. Days, even moments ago, this would have been intolerable. Now, her palm was a comfortable heat against his, containing more strength than he’d expected.
An Order member—younger than Draco—tore past him, her robe flapping behind her. She shouted, and piercing yellow flames rocketed out of her wand. Draco saw two Death Eaters down the main thoroughfare writhing and shrieking as the flames engulfed them. But there were more, dashing into alleys, flinging up wards to protect themselves. Heading for the oldest part of the city.
If he’d been in even the slightest bit of control, perhaps it would have felt better.
She should have said it.
“It will if I can figure out exactly how they infused the weld with the other two.”
She tangled her fingers in his hair. The room was swimming. “Rain check?”
a snide voice whispered.
Harry sat back, feeling the familiar twinge in his chest. “He told me,” he murmured. “It’s well in hand.”
He didn’t bother answering. His chest was seizing. He could feel the snake’s poison working through his blood, clutching at each muscle, devouring nerves. He didn’t know the end result, but he could guess. The anti-Apparition ward was going to drop at any instant and… he refused to look past that moment.
The closed doors of the Great Hall exploded outward, and the force of it flung Hermione into the wall behind her. She crouched over two students, shielding them as flames roared out into the new flush of oxygen.
*originally posted 7/8/07**
Harry sighed and rubbed at his knuckles. It was not his business; doubtless Malfoy would take offense should he even approach the subject. Harry had wondered at his own sanity when he first realised that he longed for that inevitable fight, the jarring punches, the splintering pain, the rage that left perfect numbness in its wake. Was that release for him, or for Malfoy? And what right had he to speak to Draco Malfoy about this, of all things? He had no right. Theodore Nott had been Malfoy’s friend long before there was more to it, years before the possibility of pain became the loss of a lover. Even had Malfoy and Nott parted as friends, Harry would not have had the right to ask. As lovers… well, it was a warm, tight, private place that Harry had no business being near. But he couldn’t escape it. It felt very important that he acknowledge Theodore Nott’s death to Malfoy.
Draco spun away from the books, feeling more than hollow, feeling absolutely barren inside, and headed for the door. It was still open and he slipped through it, yanking it shut behind him. It closed with an empty knell.
“Why should I trust you?” Harry asked bluntly.
Harry nodded grimly and left the room again. The Healer laid her hand gently against Blaise’s heaving chest and began to touch her wand to his side again and again, just at his ribs. One touch after another. Seamus felt his own mind buck, but they weren’t his thoughts. Or…
Her feet hit earth, and her knees followed. The smell of rain-soaked pine assaulted her nostrils. Another crack sounded just behind her. She staggered upright, Apparated again without thinking, and there was a hamlet, a tiny church, all dark, crumbling, deserted.
“No, physically he’s fine. A little tired. Remember that he’s been on the run for over a day, and before that, he was chasing after Ms Granger. I’m going to wait until this evening to wake him, unless he wakes himself up first. I imagine…” She paused. “I imagine it’s somewhat disconcerting for him with Blaise in this state. From what I gather, they are a fairly steady presence in each other’s minds.”
“I don’t understand you, Potter,” he stated.
Draco’s hand settled over his heart. Harry’s pulse hammered in his ears.
She nodded slowly. Blaise licked his lips. His gaze didn’t waver. “I can’t tell if it’s his fear. Or if it’s my fear. Or both.”
Her words faded almost immediately.
Draco felt the wall hovering at his back. There couldn’t have been more than three feet between them and the space rippled as if full of currents. He felt hot around the throat, suddenly sweating, glad he’d put the jar down before it slipped from his damp palm. Harry’s eyes pierced right through green into something else, a colour so deep Draco didn’t have a name for it, but all hells, it was enthralling.
After St. Mungo’s itself had been destroyed, it was the only method of coping she had left.
“Of course I do!” Hermione answered hotly. “And Ginny’s, but—”
—face, he had wiped it clean. Her words of a moment before twisted her innards like some vile leviathan.
“Don’t,” Harry whispered. “Don’t think about that.” He wasn’t entirely sure what it was, just some way that Draco had failed his friend, a wan ghost bearing a dead man’s eyes.
Just for an instant, Pansy lay on the bed in front of him, her face equally grey, eyelids fluttering and muscles jerking in building spasms. Theodore followed, his mouth curved in a sleepy, final smile, blood colouring his chin and throat. And then it was Blaise again, pale and sick and still alive. Draco let out a moan and squeezed Blaise’s fingers, needing to feel the warmth that proved his last friend was still there. Not finding it. “Blaise,” he rasped. “Oh gods, what’s happened to you?”
with poison that I can’t—”
“That’s all right,” Seamus whispered. Blaise’s gasps covered his words over, yet Seamus knew he’d been heard. Or felt. It didn’t matter. Thoughts or speech, he could hear Blaise, and he loved him, holy hell, he felt things for Blaise that frightened him; he knew they were massive, those things. He was afraid of what might happen if he ever lost his grasp on them, let them fly loose.
“Yes, Hermione.” At least this he could be sure about. “More than anything.”
“Hermione,” he interrupted, knocking on the table just forcefully enough to halt her words. And draw the eyes of everyone else in the room, he was sure. He stared at his best friend and she stared right back. “It’s well in hand. Please just… trust me.”
It wasn’t until night had again fallen that Blaise woke, opened his eyes, and asked in a rasping voice for Seamus.
Blaise shut one eye until Orion strode full into his vision. The silence pressed, but restfully. He knew Seamus was sleeping, somewhere.
Pomfrey nodded. “What else?”
But he had nothing to spare for Sirius tonight. Kingsley Shacklebolt’s penetrating gaze lowered from above as well, and Griselda Marchbanks’. The woman’s diminutive stature did nothing to decrease her presence; she gazed down from the upper level with a crooked eyebrow, lips already a thin line. She’d arrived just before Minerva, asking only where they were keeping the “youngest of the Malfoys.” Now, seated stiffly beside Shacklebolt, she exuded an incalculable age into the room.
The woman saw her and startled, stepping in front of… Hermione squinted into the drizzle and made out a child standing in her shadow. Hermione raised a hand cautiously and straightened.
It seemed to last forever. His clothing clung to him in a chilly mass, but Ginny’s body was warm, her fingers five points of heat pressing into his arm. He didn’t remember breathing, or thinking. Just staring out, watching the landscape fog over and refocus. As though he were seeing some dream world.
“And to save his mother and father, the most precious of those he holds dear, he risked probable death and turned to you.”
“Shouldn’t have come,” she mumbled. Her jaw ached from holding back all the frustration. Here she was, playing at some romantic story, and when it all fell down around her, she could only weep for her folly. Seven hells, what sort of person had she become?
He did wonder what
Harry wished he had been there to stop her. Too many people had given too much already. The more peaceful years before the war seemed like some sort of advance compensation for what the world was going through now, and the shards of normality that still thrust their way through the mire were tainted. Ginny Weasley was on her way to restore the balance. Harry could barely remember the exact colour of her hair, the playful quirk of her smile. But the price of his—their—happiness was already being collected. Luna was paying, and Hermione, and… Harry could picture the sharp, fatigued features of Ginny’s guide more clearly than he could see Ginny’s face. Draco Malfoy had already paid more than Harry had ever wanted to see anyone pay.
Ginny moved stiffly away, edging around the jutting rocks. Once out of sight, she stopped and leaned her head against the stone. Tears leaked down her face and she smacked a fist against the rock.
Seamus couldn’t answer. There was nothing in him but a void. No words, no emotions. No solutions. Her arm came around him. And there they sat, the three of them, as the afternoon sun worked its way slowly lower.
from me, Potter?” It was cold enough to surprise even Draco, but he drew himself under the cowl of his frustration. For a split second, the old mantle felt natural again.
“It’s
him, in his veins and under his skin. He wanted Draco to feel what he was feeling, to know why he couldn’t speak, why he couldn’t even breathe properly.
He shook his head. “Go away, Potter. I’ve a headache.”
don’t. Just.” Harry pulled Draco tight to his body and devoured his mouth. His hands razed over Draco as though trying to pull him in. Draco’s mind tumbled, his head going light and dizzy. He could do nothing except cling to Harry, cling and realise that his body hadn’t in fact had enough and was again spiralling toward arousal.
“He just stood there, listening. Didn’t say a word. Just taking it all in, and when they spoke about the first wave, the way we might launch an attack, Harry, he—that’s when he unfolded. That’s when he came to life.”
Harry released him, scrabbling for something by the side of the bed, and the room filled with white light. Just as quickly, it was gone again. Draco didn’t want the light, he wanted the darkness, wanted it wrapped back around him where it always was now, shoved down his throat and smothering him, no, that wasn’t right, that wasn’t
“Fuck off, Lovegood.”
The next weeks had been a glaze of pain around the edges of his mind. Finnigan was there, but not within his grasp. Blaise locked himself away and refused to search Finnigan out, until his nights were nothing but a mass of fever dreams and aching sorrow that
Malfoy inclined his head. “Weasley.”
They were all on borrowed time. He was nothing special. It just felt so immediate.
“Explain, Harry. Now.”
Harry stalked forward. “I thought we agreed that—”
“I mean that by all rights, he shouldn’t be. He’s had enough poison to kill a young Horntail. I found three broken ribs and deep bruising all over his torso. One of his kidneys just isn’t working anymore, and that’s saying nothing of the spell damage to his nerves!” She drew a shaky breath. “I’ve stabilised him as best I can. Everything I can fix right now is healed. I just… I have no idea why he’s still breathing, but he is.”
“Do you understand what we would do to him?” At Malfoy’s silence, Harry elaborated, letting years of hatred bleed into his words. “He’d never be brought here. He’d be spelled into senselessness, at the very least. He wouldn’t move, he wouldn’t speak. He wouldn’t
He could hear Harry’s voice, but it was the words from his dream that battered inside his head. The words he’d spoken:
Harry sat, weighing the leaden tone of Seamus’ voice. “How is he?”
Gods… What had he done to Draco? He could have lost him to this war any number of times. He could still lose him, in so many ways, and he’d already been the instrument of more of Draco’s pain than he ever wanted to think about. His heart warred with itself: How could he feel these things for Draco and send him to his death at the same time?
The detonations grew deafening and Hermione’s fear spiked. She grabbed the nearest students and yanked them to a stop.
This time his brain actually did it for him, shut down on the extra pain. Harry was grateful beyond belief. They already had one funeral today; he couldn’t handle the thought of others soon to follow.
He couldn’t sleep; he wasn’t tired. Or maybe it wasn’t him at all anymore. Instead, he scooted onto Blaise’s bed and began to talk.
She’d spent the morning smiling, wondering at how normal it felt to be in the same room as Fred, George, and Harry again. Certainly, they were missing some familiar faces. But this was the Harry of her fifth year and all the years before, tossing jokes back and forth with her brother, running a hand sheepishly through his thatch, and genuinely happy to be in her presence. Ginny had blossomed into it, let herself tumble because she knew this ground, and she knew she would be caught.
Pomfrey’s voice snapped between them: “Stop it at once!” But Finnigan had his shirt sleeve now. Draco grabbed the hand around his arm and wrenched it off, digging his fingernails into the Finnigan’s palm.
“Ron—”
“Too many of them,” Harry said softly. Fleur shuddered, looked down at her companion’s glassy stare, and shut her own eyes.
No, he had not alerted the Death Eaters accidentally,
Draco began to move again, less carefully. No magic; they’d know immediately that it was a trick. But they could hear, as he could. And they could obviously track. He’d just make it easier for them.
She didn’t need to shake her head. The answer was plain, invading the entire Infirmary.
The windowpanes shook; something beneath Harry’s feet wavered.
He gestured toward the door and a strange look crossed Harry’s face. Amusement? Relief? Well, then. Potter didn’t want him to go. Hoping to make something of a nasty situation, no doubt, drawing all of his lackeys back into the fold before the final battle. Of course he’d never let Draco out. But even Draco’s anger couldn’t stand against the desperation tying a sour knot in his throat.
*		*		*
Twice, she found herself on the verge of demanding to know where Parkinson had snuck off to anyway, and if Ron had seen which charming person had slipped away with her, before remembering that Pansy Parkinson was nowhere near the castle tonight. And it wouldn’t do to think about where she actually was, either. They all had their parts to play after all.
“No! Good god, Harry,
“It’s all right,” he said and reached out.
It was too quiet. Draco could hear his own heartbeat. “What?”
Harry rose and stirred up the fire, then sat in his chair to watch the embers disintegrate. As if called forth by a spell, Malfoy’s face took shape in the orange coals. That night… and during the interrogation… and the evening he’d first arrived. Harry shut his own eyes, but even that did not block it out. Not all of the dull glaze during the interrogation had been caused by the Veritaserum. Harry didn’t want to remember the expression on Malfoy’s face, but he’d known then that he would see it in his mind for a long time.
“I’m telling you, she’ll do it. She’s got more control over that thing than any of us know. She was just in there healing Hermione alongside Madam Pomfrey!”
What if he, Draco Malfoy, truly held the only key to this war in his hands?
Where had his strength of will gone? Had it finally been kicked out of him back in the woods, in the damp caves, staring down the length of that Death Eater’s wand? He squeezed his eyes shut, feeling the protest of the muscles in his back and legs. Such a steady ache. And he knew where each tiny hurt had come from, could name the stroke or the thrust that had given each one to him. His left shoulder felt as though it still bore the print of Harry’s fingers, five lasting bruises to keep him from forgetting what he’d done.
But Ginny was scared that she
“Gin,” Harry said, hand poised over the door handle. “Fred might be sleeping and George’s potions put him under. I don’t know if—”
“Why,” he whispered raggedly into the bricks. “Why, why, why, why…”
Seamus blinked up at him and shook his head. “No… No, I’m not sick, Harry,” he answered in a puzzled tone. Harry peered at him. It was like Seamus wasn’t all there, taking twice as long to comprehend half of what Harry said and then suddenly lucid once more. As if timed, it happened again, and Seamus’ eyes cleared. And narrowed. “Harry, wait. What? What do you—”
Draco’s unspoken thought came as keen as a slice.
He rounded the corner of the corridor that led to the Infirmary, and found it occupied already: Harry stood at the end of the hallway, slumped against the door and staring at the floor-stones. It was appalling how such a little thing could stagger Draco, inside and out. His mind blanked. Before he could think whether he should slow down or even turn around, Harry’s head rose. His eyes widened; he pushed off the wall and came forward. Draco could see that he was unsteady, even shaking. Draco stepped back, uncertain of the hand that reached for him, but Harry only gripped his sleeve.
“Then I’m staying up,” he whispered, cupping Blaise’s nape. He leaned his forehead to Blaise’s and cherished the soft breath against his chin and mouth. It was such a simple thing, taken for granted. But for the first time, Madam Pomfrey’s certain future stood back in the shadows, and in the light, there was only Blaise, living and breathing, speaking. With him again. And it was all right.
His eyes opened again on their own. Blaise swam up into consciousness as though surfacing from a dark, dank lake. He blinked. Sunlight streamed in shafts through the dusty windows. The warmth of the room was almost overwhelming; he knew without thinking that to move would upset the balance, make him too hot. Blaise inhaled. Exhaled. Became aware of an indefinable ache. He touched his temple with one hand. No longer his head aching. Seamus’ arm was a limp, sleepy mass around his middle. He rubbed over his lover’s fingers. Seamus did not even twitch.
There was no one on the seventh floor, and the sixth floor was eerily dark, all the torches snuffed out. Ron opted not to cast a Lumos, but they didn’t meet anyone, friend or foe. Beneath them, the castle kept up a heavy, hollow thudding, forcing their feet in time.
Someone behind Harry moaned. Harry’s mind fought for images of brooms, arcing Quaffles, the swoosh of a tightly knotted braid.
He kissed Draco into silence, and drew out of it slowly, feeling Draco’s panted breaths rush over his face. His own body was beginning to shake; he was closer than he thought, always so much closer than he ever thought. Harry forced himself to stop moving and nearly broke his resolve immediately as Draco lifted his hips to meet him.
He didn’t want to have this conversation. No amount of waiting would make it palatable. Draco’s knowledge of what was coming was a bad taste in Harry’s throat, but so was his grim determination to get it done. They still weren’t concrete images, not unless Harry and Draco were joined together in sex, but the emotions were growing more and more potent.
He could feel Harry standing only yards away, and there was no comfort in it. He hadn’t realised he’d been expecting comfort until it was denied. Finnigan was a darker spectre; Draco couldn’t quantify the strange foreboding at the other man’s presence, but at that moment he didn’t have the wherewithal to care. Pomfrey and Weasley faded to mere wisps as he ran his fingers over his friend’s ashen face, uncertain where to put his hands, uncertain even of what he was doing, just needing to move. Needing some sign from Blaise. His friend barely breathed; his eyelids remained firmly closed, his limbs still.
“I don’t know how he’s still alive,” she said weakly.
It was biting, not in tone but because of what it meant. Harry’s calm flowed into that one word and Draco’s hand slipped right off the door ring. His palms were sweating. He sighed, feigning an exasperation he was nowhere near feeling, and turned to face Harry again. But Harry had come even closer, only a few yards away now, and Draco was not prepared. His eyes skipped down of their own volition, to Harry’s stomach and the naked hollow of his hipbones above the line of his trousers. The memory of being held against that stomach, his own thighs sliding up to grip those hips, rocked him. Draco shut his eyes, but the sensations remained, called into existence by each horrid little thought. He remembered the warm flush of Harry’s skin beneath his trousers and the slick flex of muscle as he—Something small and delightful curled deep in Draco’s loins, threatening to shoot out through his body, and he felt heat begin to climb up his spine.
There was no space left for hunger. “No,” he said, and made to go around the other man.
She had not lost a lover; she’d lost a brother. But she had never been apologised to by someone she truly might have blamed for his death. Now, looking at Malfoy’s shaking hands and hearing the snap of his answer, Ginny felt worse than she had in a long time.
If she could only make sense of it herself first... perhaps the rest would venture forth. But she had no idea what form it would take. Couldn’t decide between bursting anger and wretched disbelief.
She longed for the days before, when she hadn’t known that Harry had slept with Draco, or how deeply Draco’s feelings for her intended went. When she was just nervous and excited by the prospect of knowing Harry intimately again, of seeing the end of this war in sight at last. Blaise and Seamus with her by the fire, sharing food and telling stories, awaiting the next turn of the road, the next step in whatever plan was being hatched for them all. It was just a game then, and everyone was alive and healthy and together. Scattered physically, but together somehow in a way they weren’t any longer. She knew it was stupid, that people had been dying left and right no matter what she understood about Harry and Draco’s relationship, but at least she’d felt safe.
“Harry, we lose people in war.” There was the tiniest break in Remus’ last word, the cracking of a façade that was much older than this conversation, older than this war. Harry squeezed his eyes shut, gripping onto Remus. Seeing his godfather’s final, surprised expression as though Sirius stood again right in front of him, and loathing himself.
Harry stared at Draco until Draco stared back. He touched Draco’s hand, ghosting a finger over his wrist. “I can’t ask you to do this. I don’t have it in me.”
And. It would take Harry, too.
Seamus looked at her, feeling empty. She waved her wand in gentle sweeps. The silver glow changed gradually, turning a ghostly purple and bathing the Healer’s face. Her eyes widened, and suddenly Seamus was looking at a face full of sorrow. Of awe. She laid a thin hand on his arm.
only to be struck down by the truth later.
Hermione couldn’t remember lifting her wand, uttering the spell. But she must have done it. Must have.
He heard shouts; dueling spells one or two streets over. Potter gripped him, easing him off the wall. “Come on. Not safe here.”
“What was that?” he whispered. “Was that…”
Harry... Harry was not Malfoy’s. She clenched her fingers tightly into her cloak. Damn it all, Harry cared for her, not him. Had never cared for him. She was the one fated to be with Harry, by Harry’s own words. But these thoughts were an old path: she’d walked down it over and over again, and what followed was just as well-trodden as what had come before.
And what was he really grateful for?
The question he couldn’t answer was what Draco would have done.
Harry fought back the sigh, a full-bodied release. “We’ll need them. All right, let’s get your friends settled and get you two up to Moody and Kingsley. I have a lot to tell you.”
He was betraying Ron.
“Safe as of two days ago,” Harry managed through a too-tight jaw.
A very peculiar expression passed over her face. But a second later, what it turned into shocked Harry to his core. Luna’s hands abandoned the harp and reached for him, fingers curling. Darting back. She blinked rapidly, her head twitching. Harry lunged, snatching at one of her hands. “Luna.”
Harry took Draco’s hand and drew him forward until he could place Draco’s fingers on his scar. Draco froze, his wrist rigid in Harry’s grip.
“Draco?”
“Tell her,” he gritted out, “that I’ve places to be. She can’t keep me in here. Moody’s orders.”
Pomfrey’s eyes went hard. “Yes, but that alone could not have done this! What else? It is necessary that you remember. Even the slightest detail—”
It was a helpless understanding, gone in an instant, but it razed a wide swath in its wake. Ginny shut her eyes, keeping the tears at bay.
What would Harry say if she told him she had been the one to save Draco’s life? She didn’t think she could witness that. Oh, she was such a coward: the moment of truth was at hand and she couldn’t even manage the questions to see it through.
“You do not trivialise it!” Harry stabbed a finger out and almost hit her. He got right in her face. “You have no idea how much I need him, how much I owe him, just for still being here. You know what, without him, Ginny wouldn’t even be here, so don’t you dare call this ‘little’ or—or anything, Hermione!”
Pomfrey looked away from Seamus. “They’re gone.” She gave a shudder. “One of those monsters shot him with Agonimorphus. That was what was building in his chest and throat, but they didn’t have the opportunity to lock it into a pattern. The bezoars are cleaning out the poison, and I’ve healed everything except his arm. I’m not sure what Skele-gro would do to him right now.”
He tried out a word in the stillness. Sound slithered from between his lips like scales over dry earth. Another word, and another. He would get no response tonight; it was much too cold. The language tasted sinewy in his mouth, and he spoke the words again, grateful for the perfection of intonation.
**originally posted 7/26/07**
“I could not just leave her there,” Fleur said, somewhere between calm and frenzy. Her fingers tightened around Katie’s shoulder. Katie did not respond. Fleur cast about, and then fixed on Harry again and caught her breath. “Harry, they were in Newcastle.”
The ache intensified into a harsh burn in his own side, and Blaise moaned out the belated horror of it. He couldn’t breathe properly; his lips struggled to form words, and finally one arrived, laden with a hope that this time, this time, the occupant of the next room was actually there to hear it. “Draco!”
He shook his head. The granola bag dangled from his fingers. “We stay in the woods. Until closer to dawn.”
“Being tossed headlong into maturity is not the same thing as maturing, Malfoy. Just so you know.”
strong. But it’s almost as if there are pieces missing. I wish by all the Founders that someone back then had written a better description of what occurs! I have next to nothing to go on.”
She said nothing else, and he went on, hallway after hallway, down a flight of stairs.
Pomfrey looked between them again. “Then it’s old. As I feared.”
to… tomorrow. H’mione.”
“Oh gods.” Ginny’s fingers rose to her mouth. She turned away, hunching her shoulders. Before he could think about it, Harry touched her arm to steady her.
Draco’s every nerve was instantly alert. But only the wind through the grass met his ears. “Hear what?”
“Obliterati detonare!”
Moments passed. Draco’s heart thrummed, beating down even the sound of the wind. He squeezed Ginny’s fingers, pressing both their hands to the stone. The green seemed to devour their flesh and the scent of sage teased Draco’s nostrils.
As soon as he was gone, Hermione sat back and smiled at Ginny, relieved to once more be in the company of her friend. “It’s good to be here,” she sighed. “There were times I thought I’d never reach the castle.”
her brain supplied. Ginny glowered at the ground. No sense in denying who she’d dreamt herself with; his smell was too familiar to ignore, the memory of his kiss far too cherished. Her mind had filled in the rest with the memories of what had often followed, and then left her shuddering with it, yearning for a finish that would never come.
Blaise had not said a word about what was happening; he didn’t need to. Seamus felt each internal failure as it occurred: his leg muscles, liver, stomach. Blaise’s heart tripped on. His lungs heaved in time to some inner rhythm. Seamus felt each breath as it came and went.
“Why the hell did you save me if you don’t care about anything?” Tears pricked at her eyelids. “Why are you even doing this? Do you think you owe him something? Because Harry asked you to and you—”
“She came close beside me and this she did say…”
“Getting to know the area?” she tried, not really knowing why she was pursuing this.
“Harry—”
She belonged here.
They all had a vested interest in this, and Harry had not attempted to keep them out. Whatever came of it, whatever was spoken under the cold light of truth, it was best they hear it for themselves.
“Describe your mother’s death, Malfoy.”
“Alright,” Moody said. “Alright, then. Hold still and let me see what they…”
The look Harry gave him was frightening. His mouth opened and he just stared at Draco, seemingly oblivious to Pomfrey’s response.
Harry’s hand closed over his again.
matter.”
“Thank you,” was all he said. Malfoy stared blankly down at his hands, wallowing in the residual grief. Harry looked up at the others, who had remained oddly silent throughout the final scene.
He took a breath, and then his lungs were heaving, spilling sounds into the rain.
But Blaise? And Finnigan? He’d known they were together, everyone knew they were together! It had to be a mistake, a lie or a trick. How the fuck had he not seen it? How had he—
“Try this again, shall we?”
The wave of Death Eaters through the wall trickled to a halt.
*	*	*
He’d been encircled by a giant, freezing fist. He stared at Madam Pomfrey, breathing in and out, Blaise’s fingers interlaced with his own, and felt cold.
The cruel orange of melting twilight swept into her eyes, banishing the dream. Ginny sucked in another breath. Her legs spasmed before she could stop them, and she sat up, tossing the cloak from her. Her hand climbed to clutch her shirt.
more comfortable.”
be here. He did not deserve the chance to make peace with Blaise’s passing. He deserved to suffer for every single person he condemned to death, past, present, and future.
He found the streets blocked entirely near the city wall and resorted to climbing the steps, hunched low, breath rasping in his ears. The remains of St. Mary’s Abbey, still wreathed in fog, were charred, with dark splashes of something Draco did not want to think about across the lower stones. He could see bodies in the soupy mist. The abbey was the focal point of the wards protecting the west side of the city; Draco felt no prickle of magic as he skirted by it and descended the wall again. Faint booms echoed further within the old city. From time to time, Draco heard the clack of running feet, the cries of people. But he saw no one.
There was something else out in the darkened hallway. A fifth and fading presence, once human. Malfoy’s filmed eyes stared up at him from the floor. Harry shivered.
A glimmer intruded at last, the sallow light of day, or fire. Blaise forced his eyes open once, and then slipped back into sleep. In and out. In and out. Had he left anyone behind in the forest? Had he killed any of his pursuers? He thought he had, but couldn’t remember the spell he’d used, or even the feeling of the wand in his hand. He shouted in his dream, heard-felt Seamus drifting there as if tossed by a breeze. In one coherent flicker, he wondered at the confusion he must be pushing into his lover’s head, wondered if Seamus were not scrabbling for purchase in a miasma that was not really his. His skull throbbed dully.
“Can’t feel it,” he whispered.
The crowd settled, looking spellbound, and Gabrielle, wearing a silver-lined tunic and a matching hair-band, joined her sister on the next verse. Their harmony was perfect. Ron prodded Hermione’s thigh. “Oy. What’s she singing about?”
“Th—” She inhaled. “They’re gone.”
There was a castle somewhere in this field. Right in front of them, maybe. He had mere yards left of his journey, but for once, the end held no scrap of solace. He’d been able to feel something like joy at the prospect of being safe again, of having reached… what he wanted to reach. But there was no reason for it now, and he should have seen that coming, from the instant he stepped out on this mission. The end had always been the same and he’d fooled himself into thinking it might turn out differently.
Luna asked one day during a lull. Everyone straightened, looking to the ceiling as though they would see her face there.
“He’s remained the same overnight,” the Healer said instead. She looked relieved at her own words. “I’m hopeful that physically being around Seamus has helped. Will help. It’s been centuries since anyone knowingly entered into a binding like this. There are many holes in our information.”
“Do you realise what this means? What will happen?” The words gritted from Harry’s throat atop the roiling in his gut. He could feel Dumbledore’s flat portrait eyes on him.
He sagged back against Blaise’s bed, staring up through filmy eyes. “Can’t breathe,” he whispered. Harry’s eyes flickered to the left, where his hand was still tightly entwined with Blaise’s.
Draco’s fingers began to ache; he found he was clutching his cloak so tightly his knuckles were stained white. Suddenly he was so furious he could barely see. Why was it his responsibility? Tears pricked at the backs of his eyes. He had no desire to see Potter again, to watch the gratitude unfold in his eyes when he dumped Ginny Weasley into his arms. It wasn’t Draco’s duty or his place, and he’d be damned if he sat here and stared at that disgusting pity in the Weaslette’s expression, had his memories rifled by her apologies about Theodore. She had never known Theodore. She had no right to speak to Draco about his pain; she was going to be bound to the love of her meager life and she’d never know what it felt like to have him die in her arms, because Perfect Potter wouldn’t
Hermione struggled to find her voice while murmurs rose around her. “No, you don’t understand,” she hastened, clutching the tabletop. “It wasn’t like that at all. He—”
“Viktor.” Harry reached out, took his hand.
Ron’s voice came from behind her. “Safe?”
Couldn’t have been more than twelve.
He wanted to be able to quantify the loss, and yet it felt blasphemous to try. Draco was not the only person to have lost someone. But it was the breaking caused by that sort of loss that made Harry want to howl inside. He had seen Malfoy stretched to breaking, more than once. And then he had seen him… break.
“They will remain intact,” Harry snapped. “She knows what she’s doing.”
In all his days of fighting, running, hiding, and killing, Blaise had never had time to just sit and think about what the end might look like. He’d imagined a huge battle, with plenty of potions-slingers and a hundred or more Death Eaters. Spells whipping the air into static, the shouts of a thousand other people through the smoke. He’d never pictured it as a solitary event, bunkered in the hillsides of an ancient lake with no one near enough to see. He was alone, and this
Luna soothed him, her singing feathering along his skin. He wanted to shove her away, hold on to his fear. If he got some of it dealt with now, he thought irrationally, it couldn’t all overwhelm him later.
He squeezed her shoulder. Her mouth curved into a very frail, very watery semblance of a smile.
made Hermione cry, not because of something he’d done. She’d cried on his shoulder many a time, about many things. But this? Damn it all, how could he feel so self-righteous and so guilty at the same time?
“Gods, are they all dead?” Blaise whispered. “We’re the last ones left?”
Harry and Draco had always had a mystifying sort of connection. Their fury toward each other knew few boundaries, even in school, and Ginny had spent many an evening arguing with herself—and in fifth year, with Harry—about why they should both fixate so heavily on each other. Why Harry felt the need that year to immerse himself in everything Draco Malfoy did, when Draco didn’t seem to know he existed. The loathing was palpable, an entirely separate presence in the room with them. She remembered being ridiculously jealous that Malfoy still incited more feeling in Harry than she, his girlfriend, could, and also recalled how stupid she felt afterward for being envious of hatred.
They followed him into the dining room, but in the end, it was Dean who removed Katie from Malfoy’s vicinity, guiding her up the stairs with a hand on her shoulder. Harry could hear her spitting angry responses to his low tones as they receded into the darkness. He turned from Sloper, not caring for the sullen twist of his features.
But Draco wasn’t about to do it. Not for this, not for such a wretched, wretched turn of events. This mess was none of his doing, he’d already decided, and even if he didn’t quite believe it, his determination and selfishness were still louder than his conscience in this, at least.
There was some stirring in the upper level. Harry narrowed his eyes and moved even closer.
Malfoy pushed off the wall right away, pulled open the door, and was gone. Hermione blinked. Ginny sighed and slouched lower in her seat. Opened her mouth, but closed it again without saying a word.
“Draco.” He hesitated for one more second, then leaned slowly back over Draco. Draco’s eyes narrowed. His legs bent, sliding higher up Harry’s hips. Harry knew he was feeling the movement inside as well, saw it pass over Draco’s face in a strange sort of shiver. Draco’s cheeks flushed so gradually Harry couldn’t pinpoint exactly when it began. He braced himself on his arms, a hand either side of Draco’s head, and shifted his legs closer against Draco one at a time. Draco shuddered bodily, his eyes fixed on Harry’s.
It was better, but not enough. The itch dug deeper, wrenching from side to side. He felt his skin might split. “Get it out, oh fuck, get it—”
Potter might have used whatever pull he had to demand this sacrifice of Ginny Weasley, this surrender of self. But Ginny was right once again: Harry Potter would never force this on her, even if it meant the difference between Voldemort ruling the world or not. He had to want it too, the bastard. Didn’t they just make one big happy fucking family?
Luna’s crystalline voice shivered around the room soothingly, but Hermione clutched her chair. Her head began to pound feverishly. “She just lets the wards down? Just like that?”
“You’re caught,” Goyle intoned. “I’ll just call the others and then we can all hunt you down together.”
once. And then he had bloody well gotten to know her a little better, and that, apparently, had been his first mistake.
And it was true.
He hated being their leader. He hated the fact that they all looked at him as if he were the bedrock of their operation, even Mad-Eye Moody, who had more than enough right to tell Harry to shove off, stop making all the damned decisions. And what had he to show for his leadership? Fred and George, exhausted and deathly ill in the Infirmary respectively. Ginny, somewhere in the castle with only the cold walls and her own thoughts to distract her, which were surely no distraction at all. An army scattered Merlin knew where, perhaps all dead or rethinking their agreement to follow a mere boy into battle. Hermione and Hannah, out there risking their lives for a bond Harry couldn’t even get excited about anymore. And an enemy that was winning handily, picking them off one by one by one while Harry hid and ‘built up strength.’
—know you are here?”
Remus gave him the tiniest shake to get his attention and looked intently at him. “We all keep living, Harry. We go on without them. All right?”
Seamus rubbed his face, turned his back. Blaise felt him collapsing just as surely as if he were the one falling. “Fuck you, Finnigan,” he ground out. “You think I wanted this? You think I bloody well wanted to feel it every time you got hurt, to have your damned nightmares every night? What if you die before this thing finishes? What happens to me?”
In the entire scheme of things, what was the purpose behind killing a snake?
Draco reached up with one hand to gain purchase on the wall, staggered upright, and felt Potter’s arms under his own.
Luna’s face was bright despite her hollowed eyes. She lifted a hand from the harp and reached into the folds of her robes, pulling two of the candies from it. Harry took one; the other went into Luna’s mouth. She sucked on it, humming.
Ginny’s eyes widened, and for the first time since they’d stopped, Draco saw the fear in them. The helplessness. He stilled, watching the play in her face. She studied him for a tense moment, so close that her exhalations skated over his face. And then she nodded.
Draco’s face went white. He stood in front of Harry, eyes beyond injured, falling toward fury. Harry had never expected his statement to cut so deeply. He had no idea why it shouldn’t; everything about this made a warped sort of sense. But actually seeing it on Draco’s face—loss all over again, that perfect mouth twisting, the mouth he’d kissed and breathed into, the body that he’d touched now completely rigid and trembling—It hurt so much worse.
“Fleur?” It was Fred. Harry looked at him blankly, but Fleur’s head shot up. She moaned something in French and grabbed hold of him.
........
No one said anything. Eventually Kingsley moved to her side and thanked her. Pomfrey retreated, shutting the door behind her.
He had no idea where they were.
But Malfoy only handed her a cold biscuit and an apple, then suggested their imminent departure from the glade. Ginny stuck the apple in her pocket and drew her cloak back over her shoulders. The colour in the sky was fading fast into deep blue. The first pinpricks of stars twinkled amidst the expanse. She picked up her knapsack and followed Malfoy through the trees, taking the apple out again as they walked.
Around the next corner, the street opened into a wide boulevard. Hermione didn’t know if it was by design or destruction. Far down past the street’s end, she could see the torn cathedral. It looked eerily lovely, carving blackly against the clouds above. The buildings were taller here; Hermione ventured away from the walls, simultaneously glad of and frustrated by the deep shadows. Her footing was uncertain enough, but the concealed heaps of rubble and uprooted stone made the going especially treacherous.
Harry stared. He could see Nott’s face in his mind: thinner, darker. His hair less wild, his eyes… paler. But green. A pensive, dangerous man with magical abilities the Death Eaters feared enough to make attempts on his life whenever they could. And Harry could see Draco, standing at a fresh grave in the roiling mist, eyes haunted but dry. Snarling furiously in a darkened castle corridor, seconds away from kissing Harry. Beneath him—gods—and staring up as if he’d lost something, as if he’d gained everything but could not… could not quite bring himself to…
“I’ve been touching him the whole time!” Seamus cried. “I haven’t let go once. I can feel him pulling himself up!”
“Why haven’t you called them, then?” he whispered. The girl’s face ruptured into a heave of triumph.
Draco caught his breath and looked around. The front hall was cavernous, with a grand staircase made of stone curving upward along the far wall. Torches lining the walls and staircase cast a yellow glow, and Draco could see heavy tapestries clinging, bathed in daylight from the windows high above. Luna’s voice gradually slipped free of his bones, and Draco shuddered, bereft. Now he could hear her in his ears, and it was raw and beautiful, but it was only sound.
“Don’t.” Draco lowered his forehead to rest on Harry’s shoulder. “Don’t even say it.”
Harry stretched out an arm and gathered her near, but she didn’t miss the way his lips brushed her forehead again. Chaste. There was nothing behind it except for the concern she’d never before had reason to question. Harry’s breathing was rock-steady under her palms.
“Agreed.” Seamus told him about finding Hermione, about being so relieved to see a face he knew, a friend. About being so fucking lonely. He didn’t need to voice the fact that he’d been scared; he could see Blaise had been there. Seamus stopped when he got to the part where he’d left Hermione again. He drank from his own cup, and then sank back onto the bed. “But you… You were even more heroic.”
Now sunlight crept into the sky, and Ginny sat in the shadow of the ridge and glared hard at the soil beneath her shoes. Her fingers were numb around the bag of granola; she hadn’t opened it. Food was trivial in the face of this new... Well. She hadn’t even decided what to name it.
*		*		*
“Why were you hiding?” Harry whispered again, as soft as rain.
“If I wake up, maybe you’ll be…” Seamus knew his words made little sense, but he also knew Blaise would know what he meant. Where they’d come from. He didn’t even feel like he needed words anymore, not with Blaise.
“I didn’t do anything, I didn’t… I’m just here, like everyone else.” Tears choked his voice and he shivered, fingers digging into Seamus’ back. “Seamus—What do I do? What happens when—”
It was so shameful, mostly because he knew damn well that all the man before him had to do was ask and he would fall right into his bed again, just so he could feel that skin against his. Smell him.
(contains spoilers for chapter 2)
“Harry?” Draco finally croaked. He reached out, trying to get his hand free of the sheets, and then Harry’s fingers were there, warm around his.
Someone stood in the blackness where the dawn did not touch. Draco saw a void behind, an empty, sucking hole. The person standing there did not move. Draco felt eyes on them. He shut his own eyes and knew who it was. “Nothing we can do.”
Hermione leaned forward and grabbed his hand, squeezing it tightly. The pressure grounded him and for one blessed moment, his mind burned off the fog. “I asked if there was any pain. Seamus described pain, in the beginning.”
It was late; the sun had long gone down, the staircases illuminated by torch after torch. The hallways echoed the new population of the castle. Harry passed the flask of Firewhisky back, one Sirius had left behind ages ago, and wiped his mouth. He tried to ignore the darkness in his head, that space where Draco should have been. All that was left was the hitch and tumble of Seamus’ torn bond. Draco had doused the only light.
“We will,” she said, and he heard the slightest of reservations in her voice. He took a breath and went on before he could demand to know what was bothering her. No time for any of that, not yet.
Ron would have beat him bloody for even thinking about using his sister in such a fashion. Harry’s chest hurt at the thought of his best friend. What had he promised that last night at Hogwarts, knowing that he wasn’t going to see his friend outside the crumbling castle? He’d promised to protect Ginny. To make sure she made it through this war.
Draco’s hand fluttered helplessly; his fingers tightened around Theodore’s already loose collar, slid over his rain-slicked cheek. “Grimmauld. I can Apparate us both.”
At Hogwarts, during school—that had been years ago. Six years of classes, cloaked in the rancor of what being under the same roof meant for both of them. But sixth year was not the last time they had dwelt in such close quarters, and he couldn’t compare their school years to this.
“No, as I understand it, he’s quite the same as he was yesterday,” Moody grunted. Pomfrey sat up straighter and Moody waved her off with a resigned nod. “Barring what has already been healed,” he corrected.
She listened. Ron’s hand tightened on hers. He picked up her shirt from the floor and pressed it into her arms. But—
There was a shout, a flash of long, red hair on an upper floor. Harry was running down the staircase, leaping the last banister. Hermione stumbled toward the stairs, and then she was in his arms.
He remembered the shivery, dwindling feeling of the Siren’s Ward as it wavered. The knot that had clenched in his throat when Lovegood’s song actually failed for an instant had not gone away until he’d fallen asleep last night.
The war might nullify any chance of Luna getting out of it at all. It wasn’t something Harry wanted to think about. He continued his trek across the battlements, turned a corner around a turret, and found Seamus sitting against a wall with his legs pulled up, staring off into the grey mist. His right hand rested limply across his knees, and his left rose, bringing something to his lips. Harry was momentarily stilled by the sight of a cigarette.
Blaise Apparated.
“We’re fine.” Ginny licked her lips. Glanced again toward Malfoy. Hermione frowned, unable to place the weird conflict in her friend’s face. Ginny continued. “Really, Hermione, we are. Only, they intimated that…”
Harry’s fingers wove back around his wrist. Then the other hand, on the other arm. Draco stared at his sometime-lover, caught, his breath coming fast in his lungs. The grip against his upper arms tightened and eased. “You need to hear this first.”
“Draco. I wanted to thank you. For what you did. You’ve no idea—” Harry’s chin dropped and then rose again. “Ginny and I both want to thank you.”
“So,” Ron said, coming to a stop once the doors had closed behind them.
“Blaise—”
Harry’s stomach was full of lead. He’d forgotten, somehow, what a fearsome foe Dumbledore was. Had always been. Behind the grandfatherly kindness, the befuddlement and the half-moon spectacles, there was an intellect capable of driving despair into the hearts of the worst of wizarding kind. Of smashing them into utter oblivion. Hermione, Ginny, Luna… They were the most obvious choices for a bond, so obvious that few would look again and wonder. Voldemort had their magical signatures. He certainly had Harry’s. He had Draco’s right in the palm of his hand, and yet the connection would never be made.
Moody clunked up the stairs behind them, and Ginny wanted to stop, wait for a moment, an
And held.
“I almost could not do it,” she whispered. “For a moment, I thought I was dreaming, that I had not Apparated and I was still there. With them.”
“That’s why our next step is the weld. We figure out the combination, we should be able to protect anyone at any level of power equally.”
He could see it in his mind’s eye as Draco answered, in trembling tones that wavered as though they would drown under their own weight. Narcissa’s skin, pale as the moon’s wash, eyes open, as glassy as pools of water. The singe of charred flesh in a smoky room, with the minty hint of the killing spell still hovering. A massive Dark Mark, burned into the silken threads of her nightdress and the flesh of her breast. Delicate fingers curled in a plea.
Dead silence except for the fire. Hermione’s fingers dug into Harry’s arm. Madam Pomfrey exhaled and looked around again as if her answer lay somewhere in the room. “It’s not working,” she repeated in a whisper.
He was behaving like a child. He was the only one left who could have got in here besides Draco himself, now that Theodore was dead, and they would have caught Draco anyway, Blaise knew it as well as he knew anything. The Death Eaters knew Draco’s magic. They weren’t as familiar with Blaise’s.
Any second, Hannah would walk up behind her and touch her shoulder, and they would exchange identifying words and then begin picking their way out of the city, heading north because that’s where Luna tugged them when Hermione concentrated hard enough, and that’s where Harry was, and
Maybe none of them would survive this war. Not him, not Blaise, not Weasley or Seamus Finnigan. Or Harry Potter.
Hysterical laughter threatened. Draco pushed away from the door and stared at up it. Surely behind it lay the answers to all of his problems, if he could just get through. Harry didn’t need saving, especially not by Draco Malfoy. It was Harry who saved, and maybe that was it: the previous night had been about trying to rescue himself from the mire he’d slogged into, to cleanse his body inside and out with something he would never really be worthy enough to deserve from Harry Potter. One night was all he’d had a right to, if he’d had a right to anything, and he’d wasted it pretending it was something else.
The absolute necessity of the thing gripped him. He’d never thought they would all reach the end of their long, long rope, but this was it. This was the only solution left. A spell of such magnitude that the people involved were all secondary. Their last hope lay, of all things, in a marriage. A loneliness scratched at his heart. He and Ginny would give everyone hope, or so it went. Something to sustain them all. But the thing that really kept everyone going was so fragile, so easily shattered. A few souls already taxed to their limits.
“Come on,” he muttered. Ginny heard the new listlessness in his words. “Only another few hours.”
“I—” Harry could barely speak, his breath was hitching so badly. “I s… sent him… to his d—his death—”
the one that bastard bonded with! Why can’t he just take me and be done with it?”
Harry shook his head. “You think this is about being a martyr? This whole thing? Fuck.”
“Malfoy,” she started. He gripped the knapsack and gave her a quick, piercing gaze, and Ginny’s words nearly failed her. “I… I’m sorry.”
Hermione dropped to her knees on the wet pavement. She could not stifle the sob, and the cry echoed like a baby’s discordant wail. Rain pit-patted in the darkness, swallowing the sound.
“It feels like he’s at rest,” he said finally, and looked up at her. A small frown dwelt between her brows. She nodded belatedly and performed her usual routine of spells all down the length of Blaise’s body. Afterward, she turned to Seamus, and he lay back and let her weave the same magic over him. As she always did, Pomfrey brought out a glass phial, whispered a single word, and tapped the side of the phial delicately with her ring finger. A drop of deep red blood appeared inside: Blaise’s. She produced another phial and did the same for Seamus.
“Wode,” Hermione said neatly. “And the red is madder. We made the dyes last night, from the plants in Minerva’s stores. It’s not as pure as the original paints the ancients used, but as you can see, it has huge potential for the containment of magical properties.”
Draco nodded, but Harry could already see the way his demeanor had changed, as if he’d found a chain to bolster him at last and had set himself to following its links to the end. Harry’s lungs squeezed. He shut his eyes. Opened them when he couldn’t delay it anymore.
He hadn’t even cried when Theodore died, not for the right reasons anyway. There was no reason why he should be crying over this.
Blaise’s expression changed abruptly, eyes sharpening in spite of the permanent haze they now carried. “Ginny,” he said. She didn’t answer at first, so he said her name more forcefully. She returned his grip on her hand, unwilling to let him strain himself any more than he already had.
Draco held one hand over the stone and felt warmth seeping up into his palm.
Harry had never felt so used. He’d never felt so helpless to stop himself from
He couldn’t meet her gaze for long.
I’m not going to just—What kind of person do you think I am, Malfoy?” Her voice rose to a thready squeak, but her eyes sparked. Draco gave her a quick, hard shake.
“Draco.” Blaise gripped his hand again. “Stop doing this to yourself. Not tonight, please.”
“Sir, are you feeling well?”
(See the end of the chapter for
And then, on the other side of the wall, a rushing roar swept into his ears; the icy tingle of Potter’s magic—something immense—slammed into the stones. Several agonised screams sounded. Cruciatus, perhaps, among whatever else.
She stood at the open Infirmary door, one hand pressed to the jamb. It was much harder than she’d expected to take the next step. Daylight streamed in, the rare sun throwing bright yellow into the room. Ginny shoved herself off the threshold before she could think about it and was forced to catch herself in a graceless hurry when her feet followed too slowly. She gained her balance and stuck her chin out, not looking at whomever else might be in the room. There were beds occupied, people she should know, those who had staggered in over the last few days, dehydrated and sick and wounded, but she was too full of her real mission to care much. Maybe that made her monstrous, but… Well, they were all allowed time to shake apart, she decided.
