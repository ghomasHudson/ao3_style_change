But in a few key moments, Draco had acted to help Potter—or failed to act to harm him—and apparently for a Gryffindor sap that meant they’d testify publicly to keep you and your mother out of Azkaban, give several interviews to the Quibbler and the Prophet detailing how mother had saved his life, and generally go to considerable trouble to stop them from paying any price whatsoever.  Absolutely vintage Gryffindor logic.
Draco laughed at the idea that he or anyone would make a “pet” of Persephone. “She’s the best of the year—probably the best in the House. We owe the alliance with Hufflepuff to her efforts.”
Draco felt like he acquitted himself acceptably, especially in dissuading his fellow writers from a dreadfully cliched and out-of-character development for Mercury, but privately he was close to panic. Bringing Antonio was absolutely brilliant and a real coup for Slytherin, but the obvious success only increased the pressure that he fully deliver on his side of the bargain.
Draco pointed at the list of rules posted beneath the names of the club officers. “First names only,
Draco felt a hand on his and looked to see Harry next to him. Draco squeezed it back and then closed his eyes and leaned his forehead against Harry’s. He didn’t want to lose this.
How was he doing it? Just his voice seemed to goad the desire, the desperation, higher.  Draco’s cock was straining, his balls were tight, everything felt like it should be on the verge of coming, only it was frozen, like it couldn’t advance without some spark.  For a second he felt close to panicked that he might stay this way forever, churning with desires and emotions and longings that couldn’t be released. But behind him, Potter’s thrusts were getting sharper, faster.  “Hold on for me for one more second. When you feel it, let go.”
“Of course not. I’d never do that to a friend, Draco—well, not unless we both agreed.  I’ve never used it on you. Now are you ready to tell me what happened?”
“Not that with that fucking attitude. Merlin, you really are a piece of work. They’re Slytherins. If someone hits them, they hit back. That’s the way they think, the way they’re raised. Half the school is hexing them on a daily basis. But we both know who will get blamed if things escalate. Forgive me for thinking if they could actually protect themselves, we could nip the whole shitshow in the bud. At the very least, I was able to persuade them there was no way it had been Gryffindors, not third years certainly.”
Draco nodded his approval at Persephone, who practically glowed with her triumph. Antonio—the rule at Moonriders was first names only—looked a bit panicked as he was swamped with commission requests, but Persephone took charge of organizing the workflow, announcing that Luna would get first pick as club co-founder—clever girl knew that would most please Lucy. Luna ceded to Lucy of course, who requested the scene of last week’s rescue from the dungeon.
He walked back to the common-room and started his review. “Too formal, Tabitha; Caradoc, too casual; Persephone, good; Moira, that will do; Vikram, excellent choice.” He moved quickly through the rest of the club members, sending three more back, but allowing a few outliers, including Marcus’ otherwise too casual choice of a hand-knit Shetland. It wouldn’t do to give the impression of excessive planning or coordination. “Antonio, I believe a drawing of Lucy enjoying herself among the Moonriders would make an appropriate gift—the composition should be relaxed and unstudied. If it can reveal some notable characteristic in Lucy that her parents would value that would be ideal of course. Above all, the quality must be such that it could be framed and hung in any private family room in any of their residences, otherwise we shouldn’t bother: can you do that?”
“So sweet,” he murmured and then called out firmly, “Lube!” apparently to the room. A moment later, Potter’s slippery fingers were deep in his ass, quickly but thoroughly getting him stretched and ready. There was absolutely no way this was his first time at this either.
“I plan to seduce, enrapture, and ensorcel every last Slytherin upperclassman—and woman—until they are eating from the palm of my hand and pining for my least crumb of attention.”
He finished in less than the allotted time, sure he’d gotten all the questions right, but dutifully checked them against the answer key. All correct, which bizarrely left him disappointed. This was going to be a bloody endless year if he’d nothing to do but cram for a not-especially difficult test.
The strain in Potter’s friendly act was becoming more blatant by the day, as were the circles under his eyes.  He barely paid attention in class, and seemed trapped in his own thoughts, which Draco guessed were brutal.
“Feel free to save my life again, should it be threatened. But we are not going to have a relationship based on your need to save me.”
“Don’t be preposterous!  Potter showed up—and he seemed to think I was doing something to her. He was rather… aggressive.”
Of course, Professor Slughorn seemed intent on putting as much distance between himself and his House and immediately blamed the Slytherin students, despite it being obvious that they’d been the victims of a malicious prank. Without even investigating he’d sentenced the entire year to a month’s detentions and docked all the remaining points from the House, enraging the Quidditch team, who’d miraculously won their first game against Hufflepuff, and leading to an hour-long dressing down from the Prefects.
. Pansy had been looking for revenge for months and here was her chance. “Oh I don’t know,” Pansy said. “This seems like the perfect time for all of us to become very good friends.” She was casting around, but of course she had Blaise there to make sure she landed her prey.
“You should come back to the Great Hall,” Potter said, all iron, practically grabbing her by the elbow.
Still, Theo, Astoria, or Millicent should have stepped up. In the past the prefects and seventh years would have rallied the House to concoct a suitable revenge for anyone who attacked another Slytherin—how could they expect to maintain the House’s reputation if they didn’t viciously punish all slights, real and imagined? And in only a few days the bullying had gone well past “slights.” School work was being sabotaged, possessions stolen or vandalized, accompanied by an entire raft of newly developed hexes designed to be undetectable by faculty.
Duessa Borgia had bought them some time and a measure of goodwill, but it was only a start. It would require all of their skill—all of Draco’s skill at least--and something approaching genuine cooperation from Harry to turn the story to their advantage. Draco wasn’t prepared to sacrifice that possibility on the altar of Harry’s stubbornness without at least trying to get through to him. It wouldn’t be fair to either of them, however much Harry might think he preferred the old method of shaking his fist and yelling “fuck you” at the heavens.
in his voice. Draco felt the Veela power adapt to it—filling him with a sense of belonging, of connection. He
For centuries, Slytherins had measured success exclusively according to the Byzantine criteria that had ruled the House since the founding. For all their cleverness, it never seemed to occur to Slytherins that they might try to cultivate students from the other houses.  It was a weakness, Draco now recognized.  During their fifth year, Potter had caused Dolores Umbridge to fly into daily apoplexies through the simple act of amassing and training a group of random nobodies, every last one of whom was thoroughly unimpressive (minus Granger, he conceded), not a one with any talent for strategy or leadership.
And to their credit, once his Housemates were able to identify a comprehensible motive for their presence at the Moonriders meeting, they turned their attention as any proper Slytherin would to working the situation to their advantage. It was clear to any idiot that the way to win over Lucy Borgia was to win over her friends, so the young Slytherins applied their considerable intellects to solving the puzzle of how to make friends with a Hufflepuff. And they quickly discovered, as Draco had, that by far the easiest method was to join in their celebration of Fury Moonrider.
“I see we’ve gone a whole two hours without you mentioning Potter,” Blaise added slyly. “Planning to have a go at that?—he’s filled out
He noticed that the new housemate was standing awfully close—was he planning to sit in Potter’s lap, perhaps?  Why did Potter put up with this nonsense?—he was the fucking chosen one.  Gryffindors were so bloody infuriating.
They’d gathered in the Room of Requirement that Saturday morning; all signs of the Moonhouse were gone, and he suspected it looked much as it did for Dumbledore’s army, though now with Slytherin colors and snake emblems on every possible surface.
His time living with his beloved Aunt Bellatrix had given Draco new levels of self-control, and having literally zero sexual desire for either Luna or the Hufflepuff princess, he realized it was probably best that he practice accessing the power now, when he wasn’t at risk of making a fool of himself.
“I very much doubt it, unless you can miraculously convince Lucy to take advice on her wardrobe choices. No, I’m here to discuss your situation and see if there is something to be done.”
Blaise had somehow moved behind Draco and put his hands on his hips. “Draco didn’t mention we’d be here?” he winked at Harry. “How very naughty of him. How shall we punish him, Pans? We’ve a few minutes before the brats arrive.”
He suspected it would take a single floo call from the Borgias to have half the Auror department here in minutes. He prayed that Persephone kept her head and kept the Slytherins from doing anything foolish. There was no point in praying Harry do anything helpful: Potter would act as he always did, without strategy, ignoring advice, on whatever impulse was spurring him that particular second. And no one would be able to stop him.
For the first minute, Draco was too overwhelmed to even think about what Potter had asked, but then he felt a growing sensation that somehow mixed coolness with white-hot lust, the one he associated with the Veela power. He forced all of his concentration into keeping it on the leash.
Pansy on the other hand… What rotten luck.  Astoria was going to think she’d strung her along, and generations of Greengrasses had made an art out of holding grudges. Pansy brazened it out of course, smirking at Astoria like she’d been deliberately mocking her, but Draco could feel something like despair encroaching on his friend.
Harry Potter, the chosen one, was blowing off his N.E.W.T.s but he made time for Fury Moonrider, time he mostly spent lying on the floor dreaming up lurid sex acts he and Draco could perform once they had the club room to themselves.
“We’ve lost much of our influence,” Draco said diplomatically. “Now is not an easy time to be in the House.”
Standing in front of those pinched faces, it occurred to him that the House really was chock full of obnoxious little gits. And not just Marcus Rutherford. They were all excessively skeptical of everything, questioning him in that sneering, derisive tone that he’d heard from his own mouth countless times.
He was actually in a half-decent mood as he left the Moonhouse as they’d taken to calling their Club headquarters. Luna was so delighted she kissed him, which was exceedingly awkward—for him. Lucy seemed to think it adorable and feel no threat whatsoever.
At least the sex that followed surpassed the already very high standard that had been set. But now the number in on the secret counted twelve Slytherin Moonriders, Blaise, Pansy, and of course Luna, who’d they’d already established was plenty observant, which meant Lucy must be added to the tally. It was a ludicrously high number. The only surprise was that it hadn’t made the cover of the
“I absolutely was. I don’t blame you for how you reacted. But it’s hard not to wonder what would have happened if you’d taken my hand that day—just like I wonder what might have been different if there had been Slytherins in Dumbledore’s Army. Neither of us can change that past, but we can want something different for the future.”
they worked well together—and Potter couldn’t begin to fathom how effective--and dangerous--those two would be if given the chance. “Stop getting so annoyed: I’m trying to pay your students a compliment.”
Oh fuck. Draco let out a loud groan. “That’s right—let’s hear more of that,” Potter said, his lips against the tip of his cock. He sent several short breaths along the ridge, nuzzling with his nose and cheek. Fuck!
“That was generous,” Draco said as soon as she was gone, but Blaise had slapped down his magazine and sat forward.
Duessa rolled her eyes. “How very Gryffindor of you. I was told you were quite capable.” She left off the ‘
“Have you gone mad? I am not afraid of you, Luna.” He prayed Merlin for patience.  “You know, if you were in Slytherin House, I would chalk this entire conversation up to an especially clever and spiteful act of vengeance.”
, Welcome to the Moonriders. Obey the rules or fuck off.” Draco waved his hand to release the barrier and stepped out of the corner, to find the entire club in a tumult. Instead of engaging in their various activities, everyone was standing around the drawing table where several were squealing over pieces of parchment.
, but he didn’t—he couldn’t. It felt like he’d be claiming too much for himself, though Luna hadn’t hesitated to claim him as a friend only moments before. But that was Luna. It was not in him to assert that their accounts were somehow balanced—they weren’t. They’d probably never be.
“Such a pity that so many got caught up in the all the Dark Lord nonsense. So much talent wasted. But Hufflepuff is more her level anyway. The Slytherins would eat her alive.”
Which was when he felt the caress of hot breath on his neck, followed by the pressure of teeth. And then Harry bit down.
Just fucking great. Of all the times to get hard. Potter could be stunningly oblivious, but Blaise and Pansy were
“And I meant what I said: I’m happy to keep exploring this with you for the time being, so long as you understand that this is not the only thing I like.”
Draco stared at him, checking to see if there was anything mocking in that, but when he couldn’t find anything he conceded, “Clearly the same could be said of Slytherin House.”
“Potter is my problem—whatever he does won’t reflect on you if you don’t let it. The Borgias are Slytherins—your sole job on Saturday is to show them the best of our House. Persephone stay, the rest of you off to class.”
“Don’t be daft—of course I didn’t.” Draco believed him. Blaise wasn’t stupid and making an enemy of Pansy the day school started before securing any other alliances would be the definition of stupid. Pansy could hold a grudge as well as anyone in the House and her cursing was probably better than Draco’s.
“Where are you going?” Draco demanded.  It was an understatement to say that emotions towards Pansy and Draco especially were unfavorable at the moment, and while he knew Pansy could take care of herself, the last thing they needed was for her to hurt someone foolish enough to try to hex her.
Draco tried to squelch any jealousy as Persephone, followed quickly by Moira were the first to succeed. Any negative emotions were soothed by Potter’s obvious amazement at the sight of Moira’s lightning-fast falcon diving and soaring alongside Persephone’s prowling jaguar. Of the rest, only Antonio managed a fully corporeal Patronus the first day, a watchful chameleon that when it moved, darted with breathtaking speed about Blaise’s graceful sandpiper and Pansy’s ferocious badger.
More reason to be grateful for the Borgia Princess. She would distract the Slytherins—and one never knew. He doubted Salazar Slytherin’s descendant would care that he’d been a Death Eater. Perhaps she’d come up with some fiendishly clever strategy that depended on winning him over. He could hope.
Draco’s head swayed with dizziness, but he reached around to hold his ass open, which was when he really took in that he was completely naked, with Potter still dressed behind him. He felt a sudden panic. He could feel how easily he was slipping into this mode with Potter—these domination games—but if this wasn’t real, he didn’t think he could bear it. “Don’t…” he whimpered, but stopped himself when he realized what he was going to say.
. Potter really had put the club hours to good use. It would never have occurred to Draco to try to do that. He wasn’t even sure he could, but he was positive holding back that side of himself would be harder than holding back an orgasm.
. The best artist at Hogwarts spends his afternoons taking commissions for images of Fury and Bez. And now it appears she got her parents to travel from Italy to employ their personal publicist to further the relationship of two of her friends. Just, when it comes to wielding power, Lucy does not require help. In fact, if she weren’t dating Luna, I’d say she was the most dangerous person in England.”
“So I’ve gathered,” Draco snarled. “But under the circumstances it seemed rather risk free, and she asked it as a favor.”
Blaise made an unconvincing front at holding out before dropping all pretense.  “Oh alright,” he said as if they’d threatened him with the Cruciatus curse.  “Well, now that you-know-who is gone, I’ve heard from a very reliable source, that His Royal Highness, Prince Nero of Borgia, is allowing his daughter to finally attend Hogwarts.  She’ll be in the seventh year.“
He was surprised that the second meeting of Moonriders, as his fellow club members now called it, wasn’t… awful. Everything they did struck him as totally pointless: there was no prestige or potential advantage to celebrating Fury Moonrider, no money to be made or useful connections. But there was something in the very pointlessness that made it soothing. He realized he’d never in his life engaged in an activity just for enjoyment. He’d always needed a motive to justify it.
Most of all Draco recognized that he was long past feeling wretched over the destiny of a Hufflepuff princess. Living constantly under that reign of horror and abomination—there had been days he was sure the despair and terror would outright kill him or at least drive him as mad as dear Aunt Bellatrix. He still had nightmares and hated being reminded of those months, but they offered one advantage: being despised by a bunch of teenagers, whatever their house, felt trivial.
From the horrified looks, Draco thought his words had made an impression, but then he realized in his agitation his sleeve had ridden up, revealing the Dark Mark.
“Boys, I’d like a word.” He looked up to see Duessa Borgia, who was gesturing towards the entrance to the pub. Nero Borgia was shaking Antonio’s hand, and then whispered something to Lucy, who shouted, “Papa says there’s cake!” Long tables appeared at the far end of the garden, groaning with layered pink and violet cakes covered with sparkling blossoms.
If Draco ever succeeded in restoring the Malfoy family’s influence, he would expend all of it trying to get Persephone elected Minister of Magic. The girl had more political talent in her big toe than her grandfather Cornelius had in his entire cabinet.
Pansy seemed too depressed to act but given her rock-bottom social status, it wouldn’t have helped—though it would have been nice if she’d at least tried. Blaise was never one to go out on a limb on his own, but again, he’d largely ceded any influence he might have by staying friends with Draco and Pansy.
All things considered, that day’s meeting wasn’t a disaster. Cece and Poppy were positively beaming, and Draco had for once managed to win a major argument with Lucy about a critical plot point.
Though in the normal course of things, Draco would condemn as an abject fool anyone who gave an open promise, he also knew he couldn’t bear to offer anything else to this particular girl. “Of course, Luna. I’ll do you a favor—you just have to ask.”
. Instead of throwing Potter against the opposite wall as it once had Fenrir Greyback, the spell only forced Potter back an inch or so, but it was enough to let Draco slip out of his grasp.
“I don’t mind,” he said quickly. “Of course—if, if it will please, uh, you both, it would be… my pleasure.”
Draco was actually a week ahead on his assignments, so it felt especially pointless to be missing dinner to “study,” but he forced his way through the Arithmancy Study Guide, and began the first sample test. The problems did not strike him as especially challenging. All those years he’d had to listen to seventh-years whinging about how impossible N.E.W.T.s were: but the last year had taught him a ruthless focus. Anything he needed to learn, he did—thoroughly and the first time. Another gift from his dear aunt.
Though, actually Potter looked seriously displeased. He stared at Draco intently and then silently waved his wand back and forth in what appeared to be a complex of diagnostic spells. “Activate the shield again.” Draco felt his instinct to rebel evaporate under Potter’s hard stare. He took a breath and then flared the shield like he’d just been jinxed. After a moment Potter said, “It’s tied to your magical core. Like your magic itself has become a protection spell.”
Draco threw up his hands. “I wouldn’t have chosen that phrase, but I was outvoted. It’s muggle or American or something—anyway it’s the spirit of the thing.”
“It got her out of this bloody carriage,” he snapped, all traces of boredom evaporated. “Now spill!”
Which of course made it all the more incongruous that she and Nero Borgia had somehow raised this particular child. Lucy was at her most exuberant, talking non-stop during the walk to Hogsmeade. She and Luna had opted for coordinated outfits—appalling frilly, satin things, Luna’s in pink, Lucy’s in violet, that bore the hallmarks of Luna’s
So I kind of imagined Persephone Fudge as a young Fiona Hill, who testified in the impeachment inquiry on November 21. 2019.
Lucy’s eyes went demonic. “Brilliant. Now you owe me a massive favor, and I’m collecting it right now! Bez finds out about Fury at the Battle of the Bands. You can figure something else out that Mercury blabs about for your precious Muscovy plot. Do not ever argue about it with me again!”
So they’d had all the terror of being locked in the dungeons while the school practically collapsed around them, but helpless, unable to fight, and reviled as traitors or cowards when the battle was over.
instead of coping with his own struggle to figure out how to live in the world now that Voldemort was dead, now that it was actually
But shagging Draco Malfoy was not the same as shagging Ginevra Weasley.  Draco could just imagine the outraged headlines. It made him appreciate in a new way just how fucking impossible it must be for Potter. The truth was Harry wasn’t always the noble Gryffindor. He wasn’t always fucking safe, marrying where he was supposed to, staying within the lines that had been drawn for him. Draco had a line of livid scars down his chest that proved it.
The Borgias were visibly more curious here, as well they should be, because unlike Lucy, they did not consider Harry’s resemblance to Bez to be an adequate explanation for his membership in a club where his supposed arch-enemy was Vice President.
Harry wasn’t helping matters by acting like a besotted sex addict. The next day he skived off class again—apparently they were done with all pretense that Potter had come back to Hogwarts to pass his N.E.W.T.s. However, he did show up for Club Hours, which should definitely help the prosecution’s case at Draco’s trial for illicit ensorcelment of the Savior, and possibly Harry’s hearing for involuntary commitment to St. Mungo’s.
Draco shrugged, out of habit refusing to show he was impressed. If anyone could squeeze its maximum value it was Pansy, and they would all profit if she could create even a tiny thaw among the rest of the Slytherins, who were mercilessly blackballing them.
“Speak for yourselves.” Blaise didn’t even bother to look up from an appallingly garish muggle magazine, fittingly named
“You’ve been so perfect and obedient for me, Draco,” Potter said softly. “But I want one more thing. I want you to hold the Veela power back until I tell you to let it go. Do you think you can do that for me?”
Except--the mere act of challenging that side of himself made the Veela surge up, like it was suddenly the strongest force in the universe. A bizarre sound was forced from him, something between a groan and a whinny.  Just letting the sound out seemed to make the power grow stronger, like it was rushing to escape. He clenched his teeth, and redoubled his efforts to control this side of himself, but then it seemed to turn on him, like the power that was meant to seduce other people was now going to torment him. Lust flooded through him, seeming to permeate every square inch of his body.
Everyone thought the Boy Wonder was so bloody nice and honorable, but Draco had the scars to prove that Potter could hit back plenty hard when provoked.  And why did Potter always feel so obliged to be “nice” to everyone, anyway?
She seemed to be opening her mouth to say ‘of course,’ but stopped herself and said, “What kind of spell?”
Draco snatched the drawing he was working on: Fuck. It was him and Harry, appearances barely altered to represent the battle of the bands episode when Bez and Fury almost come to blows. Of course Lucy had gotten it into her head that it should be because Bez finds out that Fury is part Veela, which would wreak havoc with Draco’s meticulously constructed plotline about Mercury revealing Fury’s secret as a way to drive the lovers apart.
“Not necessarily, but she’s gifted. She takes initiative. She identified a promising younger student in Moira and instead of treating her like a threat, worked to push her forward and help her develop her talents. She was the one who saw the real potential in Moonriders and pushed her classmates to work together to turn it to their benefit.”
And while everyone there was aware that Draco and Harry were shagging, that did not make Potter their ally. Like Lucy, Potter was a vector of chaos—unpredictable, uncontrollable, blundering about with no strategy or sense of his own interests. Potter had nothing at stake here, no reason to care if the Borgias approved of him or not. He was perfectly capable of mortally offending them, either because he got his back up or just unintentionally, and he would be indignant at the idea that he should show them deference for any reason, let alone because it would benefit Slytherins.
“Not that I know of, not with you,” Draco said, “but if I ever say “stop,” then everything needs to stop right away.”
If they could marshal public opinion, they might head off disaster, but the chances of that were sadly nonexistent. Potter’s method of dealing with the press and public was to lurch incoherently between brazening it out, making inconsiderate comments that were easily twisted against him, and flat denial of reality. When it hadn’t affected his own life, Draco been content to merely laugh incredulously at the sheer incompetence of it. Draco knew well how easy it was to manipulate the press—he’d been doing so since he was fourteen. But his skills in that arena wouldn’t help him while he remained one of the most despised people in England.
The Slytherins were doing nothing wrong: so what if their motives were not as noble and selfless as suited Gryffindor morality. They were behaving—more than that, contributing. Antonio’s arrival had brought something of real value to their fellow Moonriders. They were building something here, something that he’d never seen before at Hogwarts, that most would have said was impossible.
“Don’t be daft: Of course it wasn’t them. The spell was much too advanced, and anyway, they’re Slytherins. They would never do a prank that ruined their own belongings.”
Harry looked like he might object, but Draco put his hand out firmly to quiet him “We’d be grateful for your help, Your Highness--Duessa.”
. The Borgias had managed to stay out of the “late unpleasantness” as Draco’s mother now called it. But Draco rather suspected that ‘staying out’ in the Borgia’s case meant rampant profiteering and exploitation of both sides while staying safely behind the ancient wards that hid their kingdom.
“Even still,” Potter said thoughtfully. “It’s a gift, right? That power. Seems like he should be supportive.”
A glance at Blaise and Pansy showed that matters were progressing exactly as he’d known they would. Blaise was laughing flirtatiously with his group, coaxing them with winks to think of their most
As the class wrapped up, Draco did not attempt an uplifting pep talk or words of insincere praise: this wasn’t fucking Gryffindor. He simply gave the date and time of the next lesson. Unfortunately, Blaise and Pansy were annoyingly obvious ushering everyone out, leaving him and Potter.
“Finally, something that isn’t green,” Potter grunted, and pulled Draco over and pushed him down so he could climb on top, thrusting their cocks together. Draco tried to reach for Potter’s trousers, but Potter caught his wrists and pinned them. He gave Draco a deep, filthy kiss and then sat up on top of him. “Please tell me I can get my mouth on that cock of yours—before I go mad.”
He was pleased to see the young Slytherins would never be stupid enough to enter a deal blindly as Draco had with Luna—no matter how desperate they were. Draco smiled cruelly. “Something suitably humiliating—it’s the only way you’ll properly respect the trouble I’m going to. I want you to attend the meeting of a club. Every hour that you attend, and conduct yourselves properly and courteously to your fellow members, is an hour I will spend teaching you protection spells. If anyone says a word to distress one of the members, a single disdainful or hurtful remark, you are out, and you and I are enemies.”
a flattering style.  And were those freckles or spots?  All those millions of galleons and she couldn’t buy some skin potion? He quickly congratulated himself on seeing through her disguise. Obviously this was a form of camouflage and advanced mental warfare—deceiving rivals and enemies into underestimating her, the better to smite them and leave them wishing they were never born.
Draco seethed. This was not a discussion he would have chosen to have with Blaise, who’s attitudes towards sexuality were … complex, and frankly unfathomable to Draco. “It’s that obvious?” he said, choosing the only safe course available at the moment.
Draco had no idea what to make of that and finally admitted, “I suppose that’s why I was having trouble teaching it.”
This really was a joy to write. So many thanks to those who have left encouraging comments--they mean the world to me.  I am working on a sequel from Harry's perspective which I hope I'll finish in the next few weeks, so keep an eye out.
, he’d been taught by actual Death Eaters disguised as faculty.  Professor Quirrell, first year, Bartie Crouch, fourth.  And let’s not forget Remus Lupin, a closeted werewolf.  Oh and Gilderoy Lockhart—there was a real winner.
“Oh honestly: haven’t you noticed him chatting up bloody Dean Thomas?  They’re on the best of terms—real chums--his girlfriend’s ex-lover. Doesn’t exactly reek of territoriality if you ask me,” Draco said scathingly.
“He lived in your house!” he nearly screamed. Draco got close enough to put his hand on Harry’s arm. “He was just in my head, but he was in your
Potter’s growing alarm at the obsequious hero worship so he smirked when Potter’s gaze met his—some things never changed.  Without really intending it, he let the Veela power off the leash—just a tiny bit, hardly noticeable--and Draco was thrilled to see that Potter’s eyes widened to huge green saucers.
“Through and through, but she’s the best strategist in the house—well the only one, but they did win the war.”
It wasn’t that Draco disliked that album—and ‘Demon Eyes’ was quite a decent song for the solo work. But it simply wasn’t possible for an ordinary human to match Poppy and Cece’s passion for ‘Demon Eyes,’ and it would take the rest of Club hours for them to explain the trauma they believed had given rise to it. He gave a pointed nod at Persephone to keep an eye on matters, with a half glance towards Marcus, not that Persephone would need the warning to keep him and Potter separate.
suggested lacing the Gryffindor potion supplies with Acromantula venom. “Could any of you spell those cauldrons? Ten galleons says it was a fifth year—and if you think it was a Gryffindor you’re bloody daft. And seriously: Acromantula Venom? It’s a level four controlled substance: which means it bears tracing spells that will lead right back to whoever bought it. You’d be caught immediately, and if you’re lucky you’d only be expelled. Given the way this fucking year is going you’d probably kill someone and end up in Azkaban.”
memories. Pansy was terrorizing her group with threats of what she’d do if they showed her up in front of a fucking Gryffindor.
He almost wished the spell had blocked his ears, because for the next 15 minutes he was forced to listen to the useless rantings typical of powerless people. Apparently, during Potions that day, all the third-year Slytherin cauldrons had been tampered with to explode foul smelling oil. This was no Weasley Twin prank: the oil proved caustic, burning through textbooks, clothing and supplies that in their reduced post-war circumstances, many Slytherins could ill afford to replace. More seriously, an unlucky Muggleborn Gryffindor got a drop on their skin and ended up going into seizures from some kind of allergic reaction and was still recovering.
” he glared in warning at Potter. “Make sure to tell him your theory of what Fury was going through when he wrote ‘Demon Eyes.’”
“Nicely done, Pans,” Draco said. He meant it. Astoria was a real coup: family in the Sacred 28, impeccable manners, wealth, a bit dull but unimpeachable otherwise. Best of all, her family was less implicated in the “late unpleasantness” than the average Slytherin family but were in just enough to escape the charge of trying to play both sides.
The injustice of it made him angry—watching not just Pansy’s present but her future be dominated by a single mistake. In the normal course of things, Pansy had nerves of iron, and he’d trust her to fight doggedly by his side even in a hopeless battle—which made her sound like a bloody Gryffindor. She’d suffered a short-lived, highly understandable lapse in courage that day—a day he himself had spent practically paralyzed with terror--as
By habit his eyes wandered over to the Gryffindor table. Potter was sitting with Thomas and Finnigan, congratulating some bedazzled new tyke who’d been sorted to the house. But Draco had years of familiarity with Potter’s every expression and knew instinctively that he was faking his enthusiasm.
Draco looked at him, curious if Harry had begun to inhabit reality and actually confront how his big news was going to go over with his own circle. Draco really wished he could push Harry to bring in Granger: beyond her effectiveness in handling a crisis, she was the lynchpin. If they could win over Granger, she’d deal with Weasley and the rest. But Draco’s injuries to her were such that he could not ask anything of her.
Draco steeled himself. “Your highness,” he murmured as he bent over Princess Duessa’s hand, a model of perfect pure-blood breeding. Nero Borgia held out his hand to shake, so Draco adjusted smoothly, “Sir, thank you for inviting me.”
“Like they would have joined!” Draco felt a little mean pleasure that Potter actually sounded nettled by that.
He suspected that without Lucy’s influence, Luna would not have occupied her free hours in contemplation of the many virtues of Fury Moonrider and the music of
Draco just rolled his eyes—as if he’d need to use his power on Blaise, who’d been shagging him on and off since 5
“I know,” he said gently. “I will help you in any way I can—I hope you believe that. But denying reality is not a viable long-term strategy. You don’t get to choose to not be Harry Potter.”
'M-Madame,' Draco answered, voice trembling slightly. Whatever she was about to say; it wouldn't be any good.
'You're using it!' Is Potter's immediate reaction. A smile appears on his face, making his lightning bolt scar a little more crooked. Draco never noticed that before, but it's an interesting detail to the man's face.
‘Because they suddenly stopped sulking doesn’t mean I don’t want you around anymore, Draco. And they can help me in different ways; Hermione with her books and Ron... by being Ron I suppose.’
'So you're like an expert on dragons or what?' Harry asked, surprised and still a bit shocked at the same time.
Draco pushed Harry away from him, shocked by the woman's words. 'And you are?' he asked as he faced her with crossed arms.
A shiver crawls over Harry’s body at the though. As much as he despised Malfoy during his years at Hogwarts, as much as he hated him, he still would never wish him to be dead. Dead was final. Dead left wounds that would never heal again. Besides, Malfoy couldn’t possibly be dead — perhaps ill, but by the looks of the Manor, it didn’t appear as if only Narcissa Malfoy was left with a house elf. Somehow Harry just felt that the Manor would look a whole lot different with an owner less living inside.
'Stop it!' Harry shouted. He had drawn his wand without realizing, now pointing it at his Potions' professor's head with a trembling grip.
They both lowered themselves in the warm water of the bathtub and immediately a few of the many taps the bath possessed shot colorful soaps and foams into the liquid. Draco smelled the scent of pine mixed with that of lemons. He knew Harry carried the pine scent and he himself had always been told a faint lemony scent lingered around his presence. The taps worked accordingly to whom entered its waters; adding the scents they liked the most. Harry seemed to relax at smelling the scent of pine and Draco watched as his green eyes disappeared behind his foggy spectacles.
had to remain a secret, right? Fleur glanced in his direction but seemed to be more focused on the purple bag Crouch held tightly in his hands. Smoke rose from its small opening and circled through the air above their heads. Whatever was inside; it was trying to come out.
Ron chuckles a little, holding in a laugh as he probably also thinks about the fellow walking around; thinking he's the Minister himself and all that. 'Anyway, he
He nods at his reaction, pouring in some tea for the both of them; the scent of bergamot tickling his nostrils in seconds. He's always been rather fond of Earl Grey tea; it relaxes all his muscles perfectly. There's a whole cabinet in the Manor's kitchen providing every kind of Earl Grey tea you can find in both the Wizarding as the Muggle world. Collected over many years; only the finest tea gets served at Malfoy Manor.
knew him or not. 'You know Draco's father,' he said to Snape. 'You should have known the boy in my memories was his son.'
'Hagrid?' Draco reacted, bolting forward to take the boy by his hand. 'You have to go to Slughon; get the memory!'
'Is that what this place is called?' Harry asked and Tonks nodded. He took another look around the room, noticing it's decay. It seemed as if no-one had lived in the house for centuries and that now there were inhabitants, it seemed to protest against every gesture of improvement.
Harry waved Draco's finger away from his lips, a gesture that surprised Draco slightly. He had never been interrupted by anyone before. 'Apologize later. Right now, I
'Harry,' the same voice whispered again — louder this time, but still Harry ignored it and lifted his right hand to point his wand at Voldemort's laughing face.
about this boy made him more willing, made him unable to ignore and neglect what he got told to do. "Alright…" he answered, almost whispered, and slowly turned around before closing his eyes.
'Didn't know you were either,' Draco answered, biting his teeth a little. He had to meet Castor enough times already; could he seriously not enjoy one single evening without the bloody bastard?
Crawling off his bed he hurries to the window and takes the small note from the owl. The parchment is wrinkled and Potter's handwriting is messier than ever.
The table of the yellow house, of which Draco still didn't know the name, burst out in applause as the boy with the yellow scarf from before stood up amongst them. Seen from a closer view, he was actually quite handsome, Draco realized. A strong jawline but soft eyes, determination visible on his face. Dumbledore gave him a handshake as well, followed by a hug and a bright smile. Of course he was the happiest with the Champion from his own school, it was only normal.
Waking up again, Draco's first reaction was to reach out to his left, only to find an empty bed. The right side was the same; no Harry there nor anywhere in his room. His mind didn't know why it had hoped he would've been there at all — it was unlikely that the boy would be found at the Manor. His mother wasn't in his room either; had probably left to catch some sleep herself. A pale moonlight shone in through his window and with much difficulty, Draco sat himself up straight to crawl out of bed. He could feel the scars on his stomach and chest move and itch with every step he took, could feel how they were about to burst again and cover his pajamas with blood, but still he moved his feet.
Draco faced Harry again, his back as straight as a piece of wood. 'I'll follow,' he replied. 'Take this.' With those words said, a sharp object poked into Harry's stomach. As Harry looked down, he saw Draco's wand pointed at him with the handle first.
Draco thought to himself, once again proud. He watched as the boy gave the painting a confused stare, hung it straight again and put his glasses back on, forgetting about the incident as if it had never happened.
he said and kissed him on his forehead. He stroke a few stands of hair out of Harry's eyes and gave him a beautiful smile; one that made Harry's knees go weak. Draco walked away as if fluttering, throwing another encouraging glance over his shoulder and hurrying himself to a nervous looking Fleur. She was dressed in blue, of course, and seemed to sigh out of relief at the sight of Draco. Her thin arms wrapped themselves around the tall blond and a feeling of jealousy hit Harry hard even though he knew there was nothing to worry about — just the sight of someone else hugging
They joined them, warmed their hands after having them held up into the cold wind for almost ten minutes without lowering them once. 'Looked impressive,' Ron commented, getting an agreeing nod from Harry. Draco glanced at Hermione, holding in a laugh.
. But it will never happen.' He then looked at Harry, grey eyes only a shade darker than the snow around them. 'Especially now that I have you.'
Harry gave him another soft smile and took one of Draco's hands. Draco was sad to end the embrace, but as long as he could be by Harry's side, he realized it was fine too. Harry guided him over to a long table decorated with ice sculptures of different Wizarding creatures. Many drinks in many different colors were placed upon it as well as tiny desserts Draco remembered seeing at the morning of the first task. This time they were all decorated with little chocolate ribbons or the smallest candy canes he had ever seen. As they both took something to drink and Harry filled a whole plate with desserts for them to devour, Madame Maxime appeared by Draco's side.
Draco shook his head, a little smile gracing his porcelain face. “An angel does not drink nor eat — nor breathe nor sleep.”
'Aha, I see. And you want me to help you clear your thoughts away?' Raphael smirked, as if he already knew Draco wanted to talk about Harry with him.
'Don't go do anything stupid, Draco,' Harry protested immediately. You see, always trying to be the hero. Bravery
Harry blinked a few times with his eyes and pushed up his spectacles again that were starting to slide down his nose. 'I-I'm sorry,' he said as he wanted to climb off of Draco. But Draco wrapped his arms around the boy again and held him down, Harry's head falling upon Draco's chest.
Draco thought his plan had worked out greatly as he entered the carriage, the twins by his side ready to go home as well. 'So you're not
Lowering his head again, Harry was about to lower another rung when another thought struck his mind, and he looked up at the boy once more. "What is your
The most terrible feeling spread through his body as he felt the impact against his wings, his head hitting the ground. For a moment Draco was dazed, unsure of what had happened. Suddenly afraid, Draco folded his wings in, even though it was incredibly painful, and closed his eyes to take a moment for himself. He was sure he'd pushed Harry to the sidewalk, into safety — and he was sure his Mortal was alright. But himself… What had happened? Was he hurt? Why had the car been able to collide with him and not go right through him? Why—
'Charms; I've always been obsessed with learning new spells and different techniques to cast one. That's why I also learn a lot of spells without a wand, you know.
went to Hogwarts but he remained under the House of Slytherin,' he told her. His father had never really spoken of his time at Hogwarts, but he knew he belonged to the House of snakes. Green, views upon the Lake from the dungeon and a cunning way of handeling everything.
, as he got second place for arriving at the Merpeople's village first and saving two candidates instead of one. Fleur had been under the attack of grindylows and had to pull back before finishing her task, which made her score no points at all. But it hadn't mattered to the French girl anyway; the safety of her little sister had always been more important and worrying than her score.
peaceful. He felt a hand on his shoulder, looked into the face of Hermione Granger. She was crying. And he couldn’t help but cry as well. Finally giving in to the tears that had wanted to escape already so many times.
Harry let out a sigh. The poor boy had tried already many times to talk to the potions professor; but it almost seemed as if the man didn't let any conversation go in the direction that Harry wanted to take it in. From the second Harry said a word about Riddle or even just a memory; Slughorn would change the subject dramatically and act like Harry hadn't mentioned anything about it at all. The Christmas party would be another opportunity for Harry to talk to the man and perhaps finally get something out of him. 'It'll probably be a failure once again,' the boy admitted with another sigh. 'Why has Dumbledore given me this task anyway? Isn't he more capable of it himself?'
At those words, the heart of the raven-haired boy started beating faster. His parents were up there, living where Draco came from — where Draco often visited! A sudden excitement overwhelmed him and the boy sat up straight in bed, startling Draco a tiny bit. "You must've talked to them, no? You must've seen them, at least?" He pushed, his eyes as big as fishbowls.
; I am one of the few students who can open the gates for important visitors or whatever — it doesn't really matter why — but it granted me the ability to let Dumbledore in; to invite him onto the grounds of my beloved school. He smiled at me and told me exactly what had happened with that same smile still on his face; as if it all had been a big joke he was the starter of. But he turned serious when explaining to me he had to hide — hide away from the Ministry. I then told him I could help him with that, but that he at least had to tell Madame about it. It wasn't a problem and before I knew I was helping the headmaster of Hogwarts hide away in this school; bringing him food three times a day and making sure he was alright.'
'Shut your mouth you filthy betrayer!' Called the boy's response. Pure hate was readable in the boy's eyes like a fire that was unwilling to be extinguished. He noticed Draco staring at his burn wounds; at his face that had once been as pale and porcelain-like as that of Draco himself. 'Take a good look indeed, to what
A grumble from underneath the hood followed, followed by a sip of a damping liquid. 'It's not my fault, Dolores. Today's Witches and Wizards tend to be on
Lifting his shoulders, Draco gets up to his feet and retrieves the book from his desk. As he hands it over to Potter, their hands touch slightly; the warmth of Potter's fingers radiating through Draco's leather glove. It makes his heart skip a beat; he felt that! He felt the
'You could say that — and very impatient with me, I believe. And I hate having him in my head; it's almost worse than looking through Voldemort's eyes. He saw all my memories, you know; even some of us together.'
"Thought humans weren't able to see angels? So how would you know when you've never communicated with one."
Carefully placing the dead bird on a soft velvet cushion which laid deserted next to the cabinet, Draco started to study the strange object a little more. He sincerely hoped Harry was looking at it as well; studying it with Draco's eyes for once. 'Is it supposed to keep something alive?' Draco guessed, wondering why else Castor had been so disappointed to see the bird dead.
Shouting and applause broke free from the Slytherin table as all the men of Durmstrang rose to clap their hands for their Champion. Of course it had to be Krum; if it had been someone else it would've been ridiculous and a waste of the celebrity's time to come in the first place. Krum made his way to Dumbledore who congratulated him and gave him a pat on the shoulder. Krum didn't seem the slightest surprised by everything at all and followed Dumbledore's guiding hand to a door in the back of the Great Hall.
Breath was catching. Couching. Soft breathing in his ear that wasn't his. Draco was still alive, but was he himself again?
It all pushed him even more into putting effort in getting his hands on Dolohov’s body, and sort out what this damned curse was all about. It would help of course if the blond git would actually want to talk to him, and didn't just kick him out of his house. Well, it actually was Ron who stormed out of the Manor
The twins their attention seemed to be drawn by Draco's words and their hungry eyes for gossip shot from Harry to his friends, their clawing hands taking ahold of Luna and Ron — Hermione, Ginny and Neville jumping away just a second fast enough. Luna didn't seem to mind but Ron rather seemed to feel uncomfortable; pulling a face and glancing at Hermione for help. Seeing it as his one and only chance; Draco pulled Harry away from the others and dragged him a bit further down the hallway — in the direction of Madame's door.
Dazed, Harry tried to make sense of the current situation but found himself unable to. "Because I'm not,' he started, '
'Just — just some thoughts,' Draco said as an excuse for his over-poetic self. Or for trying to be at least a little poetic.
, Malfoy,” Harry tells him. Last week he’d already wanted to mention it, but hadn’t, and now he somehow felt like making a comment about it now — especially when seeing him in his current sate.
Harry sat himself down beside Draco as well and took his hand in his. Softly stroking the pale skin, he laid down his head on his shoulder. 'Of course it doesn't matter,' he whispered to Draco as if normal said words would hurt his lover. 'You being safe is all that does.'
I want to help Harry; what matters is that he succeeds in his next task. And I think you're willing to help him with that as much as I am,
Fury seemed to reach its peak as Umbridge her face turned the color of a tomato — perhaps even brighter. 'Fine,' she concluded before turning around and making her way through the dining chamber again.
, it broke free as if a vase had burst and its water streamed out — unable to hold it in any longer.
Harry was now the one to sigh. 'And at Hogwarts? Come to Hogwarts with me and we can try to hide you there—‘
Staying behind Dumbledore Harry followed him further through the house; into the living room where a chaos of the same caliber appeared in front of their eyes. The only thing that seemed untouched was a striped blue sofa in the middle of the room — old but spotless and in Dumbledore's eyes apparently very interesting as the man kept his eyes locked on it. 'Slughorn', he then said. 'I know it's you.'
Folding the map again with a sigh, Harry tucked it away in his jacket's pocket. 'We'll just have to go and see for ourselves, I guess.'
With eyebrows frown, Harry took a step closer. 'Is that why you want me to become friendly with him, sir?'
As Harry was about to comment on that matter, Hermione took a step forward of her own. 'By destroying this.' Salazar's locket swung from left to right in her hand; then fell still to get observed by a handful of eyes. 'It belongs to
‘Never do that to me again,’ Draco said to Harry. His voice sounded weird — out of place in the silence.
'That we're destroying the horcruxes. He must've felt it, he must feel that pieces of his own soul are being destroyed… there is no other way.'
Tonks nodded. 'I am indeed, but I'm also an Auror.' A feeling of amazement went through Harry's body as he had always wanted to meet an Auror; had always imagined Aurors to only be tough Wizards with a strong physique and eyebrows always set into a frown. Tonks, the Auror in front of him, was quite the opposite. Curiosity welled up as he wanted ask her for stories about chasing evil Wizards and what it was like to work at the Ministry, but he kept his questions to himself as he knew there would be another time for that. 'And you must be Draco Malfoy,' she then said, reaching her hand out for Draco.
which way he had to go. Perhaps it was a side-effect to the gillyweed. Large arches doomed up in front of him. He saw a few small hills covered with a kind of green moss, but as he neared them, he could see it weren't just hills; it were the Merpeople's houses. Everything was draped in a green light; casted upon the evil faces of a few of its inhabitants. Gold and silver, jewels and shiny stones; he saw them all on the bottom of the lake — but even when he just took a quick glance at them, he could already feel the presence of one of the village's Merpeople getting nearer.
‘Oh. I understand,’ Harry sympathised as he looked at his hands, a slight blur underneath the water's surface. ‘Sometimes, I also hate my lightning bolt scar. People know it’s story without me being able to hide it.’ The boy sighed at those words. ‘At least you
Mimicking a voice to make his friends laugh, he snatched Draco's letter out of Harry's hands. 'What’s this? A letter from Cedric your boyfriend?'
'Well, if neither of you is going to say anything.' Draco picked up one of the shiny apples that were displayed in front of them. 'Then shall we go for a walk through the snowy landscapes of Scotland, Harry?' A single bite out of the apple caused the three boys to wince. The way his teeth bit into the apple, his lips enclosing it so slowly afterwards. And as he chewed, he let out a moan as if it was the best thing he had ever eaten in his entire life. Yeah, definitely enough to make Harry's blood stream to the wrong places again.
'No, we're going to Malfoy Manor,' Harry replies, rounding a corner and jumping into the Ministry's rickety elevator.
'Why don't you give the boy some privacy, Hermione,' Seamus then interrupted. Harry could almost hear an angel sing in his ears at his words. 'He's also not asking you about your love life with that Krum fellow.'
'You kept glancing over at the Forbidden Forest, Harry,' Draco admitted with a smile. Not only clever anymore; also extremely observant.
Harry looked as if he wanted to disappear through the floor, slowly melt away and never face the twins again, and Draco realized he had to say something to save his poor lion from becoming a prey. 'You should meet his friends as well,
And off they went, running the other way again to the Forbidden forest with a plan in their heads on how to get there but still making one on how to actually get in. As they ran from the castle to the trees, Harry couldn't help but ask where his three friends had suddenly come from. Ginny explained that Hermione had called for them using the enchanted Galleons; that they were the only three brave enough to answer the call for help. Harry glanced over his shoulder at Hermione, cheeks a crimson color making her face glow. 'Knew you wouldn't stay here — that you had to go save him. Might as well take some extra wands with us, right?' Harry blessed his friend right there and then; for just how clever she was and always seemed to know what he was going to do next.
Had he ever been dead, then? Words that would have normally caused him to panic now made him exhausted; the few things he had taken in too much for him to handle. He had to close his eyes again, had to sleep and forget about everything that had happened.
At least that was something he didn't have to worry about, Draco thought to himself. He already had to worry about Harry who was going to try and fight a dragon by summoning a broom.
’ It escaped his lips before he had known, had come out in French without realizing. It tired him. Exhausted him.
*Takes a deep breath* F I N A L L Y! I've been stuck with writing this chapter since February, and personal life and its issues have been keeping me from figuring it out. It first looked completely different, but last month I got this sudden vision of how I wanted it to be. Finally, tonight, I have proudly finished another chapter.
The wall behind Malfoy's bed displays the cycle of the moon, painted in a crescent shape, almost like a grotesque rainbow. And as Harry's observing this wall, Malfoy clears his throat a little too loud. Obviously drawing Harry's attention, the git points at the two uncomfortable chairs and sits down in one of them himself. Harry follows his example, but jumps almost immediately off his chair again as Malfoy draws his wand. At least, his Mother's wand.
Malfoy nods and stands up, avoiding Harry's eyes again. In complete silence he guides Harry back towards the entrance hall, to the giant wooden door with the peacock, the snake and the rose bushes.
It took a few seconds, but a vague smile appeared on Draco's face as well. 'Me too,' he replied, even though it sounded very off.
So as he got back to the carriage, he found all the girls had returned already as well. With the door swung open, he immediately heard a silence fall. All their eyes were pointed in his direction, blank expressions on their faces. Draco stood frozen in the door, unsure of what to do or how to react. Madame sat on her purple sofa by the fire, her eyes fixed upon him as well.
'I see... You might've needed that after last night, didn't you?' A few other girls joined her in her grinning and Draco felt his cheeks flush slightly. 'Now, close that door will you, before we all catch a cold.'
But it soon became clear that it wasn't because of anger — rather because of effort for trying to smile and talk while being in such pain. It was a strange look, having a black eye but smiling at the same time. 'Harry Potter here saved me,' the man began, his voice sounding a bit hoarse. He lifted his hand slightly to point in Harry's direction but Molly pushed it down again, not wanting him to exhaust himself. 'If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here with my family tonight,' he continued.
care, Ron?' Harry heard her mumble softly. It was probably too silent for Ron to hear as he stormed out of the Great Hall, his jealousy too much to handle. Hermione let out a deep sigh and rose from her seat as well. 'I'll go talk to him,' she said to no-one in particular and followed Ron's footsteps.
' to too many things. That's mainly because I always got refused everything when I was a child,' Potter says. 'But I'm happy I at least have him.'
'I've always had enough Pureblood girls to choose from when I was younger. But after the War every Witch and Wizard knew what I had done and what I had become; a pathetic Death Eater. Fighting at the wrong side had made it impossible for me to find anyone willing to marry me,'
You have two boyfriends now, Harry?' His friends laughed even louder as they took a peek at the letter over Dudley's shoulder. 'He writes that you're in danger. I don't know about that, but I know that his letter is.' Without hesitation Dudley tore the letter in two, the sound of it's rupture welling up the anger Harry had tried to suppress so greatly.
It doesn't take Draco long to choose what music piece he wants to play. His hand almost immediately reaches out for one of his favorites;
Draco himself waited eagerly for the right moment to ask Harry. It had been clear to him from the start that he wanted to go with the boy; even if it was just as friends. He still wasn't certain if Harry would ever return his feelings the way he would want them returned. Did the boy even like other boys? Draco had no idea and therefore kept postponing the moment he would ask Harry to go to the Yule Ball with him. On the other hand he was also waiting for Harry to ask
to take it. That very day when he was called to the drawing room, seated upon one of the chairs. Father entered the room only minutes later, placing a hand atop his son's shoulder.
Draco lingered in the back, stared at the trio in front of them whom were struggling not to fall. Nobody seemed to want to walk the forests of the Wizarding village; and Draco could gladly understand why. Harry nearly fell as he climbed over a large branch with smaller ones attached to it; its nettles stinging him and making him bite his teeth. 'Be quiet, will you?' Hermione hissed at him, followed by a roll of eyes in return.
' the portrait called out and Draco heard Harry chuckle behind him. He hoped with his dear heart that non of the girls had heard it as well.
What surprised Draco the most of all was how Harry's best friends also didn't seem to believe him; at least the ginger-haired boy didn't. This Ron stormed off every time he caught a glimpse of the boy. And when they ran into each other, they seemed to fight a battle neither of them could win. Hermione on the other hand didn't seem to not believe Harry, but Draco could see the doubt in her eyes every time she was around the poor boy.
Throwing a glance at his watch, Harry noticed it was almost time and waved off his friends, watched them sit in between the other cheering Gryffindors. Yellow banners with Cedric's name were covering most part of the Hufflepuff section and they seemed to have had the same idea with the paint, all their faces yellow as they cheered for their own House's Champion. Cedric himself was talking to Cho, a smile upon his face as if he wasn't nervous at all. His father was also by his side, a hand on his shoulder as he looked at his son with loving eyes. And for the second time that evening, Harry was hit with a feeling of jealousy.
Another chapter! Finally, right?! I've just been super busy lately, but I'll try to upload another chapter a little sooner next time! ;)
Without waiting for a second longer, he stormed away from the crowd into the castle again. He pushed students aside, heard more explosions and the screeching voice of Umbridge demanding the twins to come down and stop immediately. Harry quickly glanced over his shoulder, noticed that his friends were following and felt his chest fill with a warm feeling; they always had his back, no matter how absurd his ideas may sound. He didn't know where he was running off to — perhaps to find a Floo somewhere to take them to the Ministry.
Taking his round glasses off, Harry washed his face with some water while trying to think of something else than the negative comments floating around in his head. His mind drifted off towards school again, and a slight nauseous feeling filled his stomach with dread. Lifting his face again, he dried it with a clean towel — kept it rested against his eyes for a moment longer. As he lowered it, and his eyes grazed past the mirror once more, he caught something moving in its reflection. Did the painting behind him just move a few inches to the left? Whirling around immediately, Harry took a step closer towards the very painting. The seascape depicted on it still looked the same, but its frame definitely didn't. With a little push, Harry hung it straight again, took a step backwards and gave it one final look before turning around again. A shake of his head.
A fire of ginger hair then appeared in their sight, storming directly at them and Harry pulled his hand away again. Ron Weasley looked furious as he crossed the dance floor, pushing a few couples out of his way to reach Harry and Draco. ‘I can’t believe it!’ he almost yelled at them. His face had gone as red as a tomato and it blended in perfectly with his vintage looking robes.
As they returned the scrapbooks to their shelf, he said awkwardly, “I appreciate how you’ve welcomed the Slytherins. I realize I probably should have asked beforehand.”
“I’m amused by the two of you,” Harry scoffed. “Your daughter lacks political sense? We are talking about the same Lucy Borgia who got Draco Malfoy to be Vice President of the Fury Moonrider Fan Club? She’s got the entire third-year class of Slytherin racking their brains for new ways to praise the music of
“You’re going to let me fuck you now, aren’t you, Draco? Because I have been lying over there thinking about exactly what I want to do to you.”
If the Ministry or Wizengamot or the DMLE decided that Draco was some danger to the Savior and tried to interfere, it was going to get very, very ugly. To Harry, it would seem like they were trying to destroy his happiness after everything he’d done for them; he wouldn’t forgive it. Just the suggestion that they might charge Draco with besotting him with his Veela power caused Potter’s magic to flare so high it shook the entire wing of the castle. He darkly suggested that anyone who touched Draco would regret it.
Before she could answer, an accusing voice called out, “Luna, you left dinner.” Just wonderful: Potter was stalking her now.
Both Melody and Duessa’s eyes lit up. “Even better—she’ll be perfect.” Melody and Giovanni rushed off to their various assignments. Draco was feeling rather dizzy at Duessa Borgia’s speed and sheer bloody brilliance in attacking their problem.
All things considered, Draco recovered quickly from the appalling image of Salazar Slytherin’s descendant taking her seat at the Hufflepuff table.  Lucy Borgia had been a consideration in his strategy for less than three hours.  It was no great sacrifice to watch those hopes die.
.’ “Ah, here we are. Melody, my publicist; Giovanni, our photographer. Melody, we’ll need a rapid response to prepare the public to accept a relationship between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. I’d estimate at least 17 people know, so there’s not a moment to lose. If I might suggest a strategy?”
By the end of the following day, Draco marveled that he thought the challenging part of this would be integrating the third-years into Moonriders. How was it he’d never realized how impossible it was to teach Slytherins?
Draco shuddered at how very much he wanted this—craved it. It took less than a minute for Potter to shoot all over him. Blaise hadn’t been kidding: the instinct that drove this was blatantly, aggressively territorial.
Draco’s face burned. He couldn’t meet Potter’s eye as he forced himself to say, “The power can be activated by a ritual. It doesn’t… It’s a choice.”
“Riiight,” Draco said, rubbing his hands together. “So Pansy will take Marcus; Caradoc and Pollux, you can join them. Luna perhaps you could work with Tabitha and Damian. Jasmine, you as well.”
Draco hated how much the words stung. He tried to shove Potter away, but Blaise was right—Potter had filled out during his year fighting the Dark Lord and easily kept his grip.
year—though the warning was timely since there was always the possibility that he might be tempted to practice on him.
More surprising was the arrival of a rather bewildered Slytherin fifth year, Antonio Maldonado. With a firm nod from Persephone, he took a seat at the drawing table while she shoved photos of Fury and Bez in front of him. He took out his wand and spelled the paper and then began drawing.
“Blood hell!” Potter shouted. Draco hummed over him, making small pumping motions with his entire mouth, that elicited more shouts. Now that he had Harry good and hooked, he let the Veela power off the rein.
“The first time I saw her, I thought her appearance was a form of camouflage—mental warfare designed to disarm her enemies. Apparently, I didn’t understand the half of it.”
Everyone there was used to being judged by the rest of Hogwarts: behavior and attitudes that to a Slytherin were self-evident and the barest common sense, were treated by the other houses as sneaky, manipulative and ignoble. No one embodied that moralistic, judgmental attitude more thoroughly than Potter.
He had no choice but to praise her acting skills because she looked intensely nervous as she sat upon the stool.  He could practically feel the breath of anticipation at the Slytherin table, the plots and jockeying just waiting to be unleashed, as the headmistress lowered the sorting hat on the girl’s head.
Private tantrum over, Draco took a deep breath, regained his aristocratic sang-froid, and turned to Persephone and said, “Common room, everyone.” There was less than twenty minutes before classes started but this couldn’t wait.
Luna aside, it was past time his two friends got off their asses and helped rebuild the House. He was not inviting them to join the club: Moonriders was not ready for Blaise, and he didn’t trust Pansy not to yuck on the Hufflepuff’s yum. But they both knew their spells.
again--why the chocolate had meant so much to her. It was about believing—with genuine, bone-deep conviction—that you could get back to some state of happiness, recover a sense of yourself after your enemies did their level best to obliterate your last shred of hope.
“You know,” Potter said, as if challenging him to run. “If I had to guess, I’d say you expected me to react like Bez.” Draco started back, but Potter wouldn’t let him pull away. “Moira might have explained a few plot points to me. He sounds like a prejudiced ass, if you ask me. Should probably be more accepting, especially of something a bloke is born with.”
“Even better. We’ll get some shots of that as well. This way we set the narrative; any subsequent stories will sound spiteful—adults refusing to let bygones be bygones, forcing their bitterness on the young—Melody will come up with the best language—she’s very good at what she does. Do we want
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Well, do let me know if he’d be up for a threesome before you head off to Azkaban, because that seems to be where the wind is blowing.”
Draco tore his arm away and shoved Potter back. “It’s not a spell, and it’s not your concern,” he mumbled. Forcing himself to at least pretend to be calmer, he said in his most clipped tones. “You’ve been invited by a member so you’ve the right to stay if that’s what you want, but all guests must obey the club rules, and if you won’t then leave.”
After throwing his outer robes over his shoulders and letting a hand smoothen his white strands of hair, he makes his way downstairs to the tea room. Double doors, black and trimmed with silver lining, doom up in front of him. He hears soft voices behind it, whispering about something he can’t understand. It brings him back to a time when he would pass these doors — when they still belonged to a drawing room, not a tea one — and would hear the Dark Lord whisper grotesque instructions to his followers.
With Harry's wand now pointed at the monster, he didn't even get the time to pronounce one of the many spells he knew — Voldemort simply flicked Harry's wand out of his hand without even trying. 'So — weak,' he said, staring into green eyes with red ones.
Standing up again with a lot of effort — either from exhaustion or of old age — Dumbledore walked over to the portrait of the girl. He spoke to her in whispers, drawing Draco to the edge of his chair to hear what he was saying. But it was to no avail; they spoke too soft and swift to be heard. 'That is Ariana, isn't it?' Hermione then said, freezing Dumbledore's whispers. 'Your sister.'
Draco turned to see that Harry's friends had gone quiet while throwing Draco confused glances. Harry on the other hand still smiled brightly and threw one end of his red and yellow scarf over his shoulder.
, one could read the speculation to why the distinct color of the school was a pale blue — it's founder had seen the newly-built chateau finished for the first time under a midnight's moon and had seen it's white color transformed to a blue so pale it was simply mesmerizing. And as Draco looked at the chateau with the same eyes as its founder; he couldn't agree with him more.
Tonks turned out to be a metamorphagus, something Harry found extremely fascinating and Draco even more. They had spent the next hours in her room watching her change her face in that of an animal or of a person they had requested. Tonks had also told Harry his Auror stories that he so keenly had wanted to hear and when they finally had been called in for dinner, his friends had apologized for their behavior. Of course Harry had forgiven them, how could he not have? And when Sirius had finally told him about the Order, he had understood why they hadn't been able to sent him any letters or replies. But that didn't mean he wasn't at least the tiniest bit angry at them anymore.
The Thestrals greeted them as if they had been awaiting their arrival, half of the group looking around the forest aimlessly to try and find the animals Luna had so animately been talking about. 'I can't see them, can you?' Ron asked his sister but Ginny shook her head.
But of course, he couldn’t go with anything so subtle as a boner. No, the next moment, the fighting suddenly stopped, and all three of them were staring--because he was
It would be absurd for Draco to apologize to the Slytherins for a starting a relationship with the person he’d been obsessed with for almost half his life. He tried to console himself with the hope that Moonriders itself might offer some insulation. There were a few encouraging signs that it was helping with the bullying, independent of the new protection spells he was teaching them. Inevitably, relationships built in the club spilled out into the rest of school hours. A Slytherin chatting with a Hufflepuff Moonrider on the way to class was far less likely to be hexed.
But of course, Luna had to go and ruin it. She smiled and clapped. “Yes! I hoped it might make you feel better if I asked it as a favor. Lucy said it would.”
But this wasn’t the old days, when Slytherins would have treated an event like this as an opportunity to sabotage and humiliate not just other houses but their own Housemates. Draco had deliberately crafted a strategy to maximize the benefit to the whole group—even including the Hufflepuffs—and trusted that their weeks in Moonriders had taught everyone present why it was the superior approach.
After a moment, he said, “There was no question that I was going to be in Slytherin, and not just because of my family connection. We all just knew. The night before I started Hogwarts, my mother told me I should always have my eye out for anyone in the House who seemed to wield particular influence, who was gifted when it came to politics or power, and I should make a point of befriending them.”
Surely there were virtues that Slytherins were unable to discern, and thanks to that blindness incapable of profiting off of.  Though when he contemplated it, Ravenclaws could be tolerable, barely, but could he seriously endure being friends with a Hufflepuff? Merlin save him.
Draco always loved when Blaise petted him, and right now it felt wonderfully soothing.  Except… ”Are you using your power on me?” He flipped around, batting Blaise’s hand out of his hair.
Draco could practically feel Harry trying to wish away certain hard facts, to change the impossible, turn back time two years or five years or eighteen years. Harry knew better than anyone how hopeless that was.
Duessa clapped her hands together, the first gesture Draco had seen that actually reminded him of Lucy. “Perfect! Brilliant—remind me to give you a raise.”
Though they had power to transform the Three Broomsticks into a fairy-tale garden for their daughter’s friends, the Borgias could not transform themselves so easily. In contrast to most Hogwarts parents including his own, the Borgias apparently travelled with an entourage of assistants and bodyguards, who lurked menacingly in the background.
Hexes and counter-spells and even a few curses started flying between the three of them. Draco realized this was probably the most efficient way to clear the air. What he didn’t count on was getting a close-up look at how bloody good Potter had gotten in his year wandering the wilds. Pansy and Blaise had always been top of their class, but Potter had no trouble holding his own. All those years the Boy Wonder had seemed to trip and fall into totally improbable victories—clearly that was all in the past now. His wand work was confident and flawless and blazingly fast.
'Who did this to you, Draco?' Fleur then demanded. In her anger she sounded like a younger version of Madame Maxime, which drew Draco out of his haze and made her figure become more clear. She looked utterly shocked.
,’ a voice then whispered to him. Looking over his shoulder he caught the glancing eyes of Raphael, probably still awake to await Draco’s return. A smile lingered on his lips, the key fluttering its wings slightly.
But it wasn't that simple as Harry was nowhere to be found. Not by the Lake where they still practiced the Bubble-Head charm three times a week, not by Hagrid's hut whom Draco knew was Harry's friend, not in the clocktower courtyard nor at the library. Draco started to become frustrated when he ran into Harry's ginger-haired friend. He was easy to spot from a distance as he was taller than Draco and therefore always towered above the other students.
Draco bowed his head at her demand. Of course he would guide the girls; she didn't even have to ask. It had already become clear to him that he had to take care of them during the entire trip; it was the main reason why Madame had invited him to come along in the first place. The thought of a large bathroom also made him glad; he had used the smaller one the carriage held the night before and it wasn't much larger than his small compartment had been. Knowing that all the girls, including himself, were rather keen on taking good care of their hygiene and hair; a decent bathroom was a must.
Wiping away the sweat from his forehead, he sat up straight and looked around his room. The pale moonlight shone inside through the small window, assuring him of no other presence than himself. Relieved, Draco laid his head back down on his pillow.
Draco swallowed at the second hug; he just didn't like physical contact, not even by the girls whom he adored so much. And of course he understood Fleur's worry; he himself had been scared of the dragons as well. ‘Don’t worry about it. I’m sure you’ll do great!’ he assured her anyway, but his words only seemed to worry her more. She seemed lost in thought, suddenly — probably thinking about what she could do to win from a giant winged creature that spitted fire.
She blinked slowly with her eyes at his words. 'Dumbledore?' She asked, now turning herself to Draco, who confirmed her thoughts with a nod. '
With that said, the woman with her wild curls stands up and leaves the room; probably on her way to the library in their house with Rose still in her arms. Ron stares at the spot where Hermione sat for another few seconds before facing his best friend again.
But there he was, Harry Potter, willing to give Draco his cloak to keep him warm and dry. Draco's heart jumped again at the thought of it alone.
, spread around by a Ministry that wasn't in the hands of the good anymore. They had realized that soon enough, as they had read the Daily Prophet and seen its cover with a smiling Dolores Umbridge depicted on it. Hermione quickly speculated that Voldemort was behind this sudden new election. Even though Umbridge had seemed so highly against him, they were all convinced they would match perfectly evil-wise. The cruel woman was in charge of interrogating Muggle-borns and Half-Bloods now — of which most ended up without a wand or in Azkaban if they really were a disappointing matter in the eyes of the pink toad.
— and held drinks in their hands that were spilling all over the place. Hadn't they left them alone for what — two minutes? 'We're hosting a party for our British guests,' Ansel explained, gesturing towards Harry's friends whom were animately talking to other students again. Only Hermione was sulking in a corner; probably finding the party as unjust as Draco did. 'And of course celebrating the defeat of
I'm so pleased to have wrapped up the Half-Blood Prince part because it seriously has been a rollercoaster for me on how to find what I wanted to do with it. Should I include the Sectumsempra or not? But, I realized, I just had to.
Blinking rapidly a few times with his eyes, Harry had to put a hand against the wall behind him to ground himself. How on
be by her side. Staring at the rain he just felt abandoned and suddenly alone. When was the last time he had felt so lonely?
'Then explain who killed all those Muggles with the single flick of a wand; who caused that mess in the woods a few weeks ago — who
While the Wizengamot had had a discussion in whispers about possible punishments and/or a sentence to Azkaban, Draco'd felt a terrible itch on his arm for the first time. It had been more like a stab, really, than an itch. It had been so painful that he had to pull up his sleeve, scratch his skin to just do
, there must be something!' Harry seemed to be on the verge of becoming hysterical and it pained Draco to see him that way. A little voice in Draco's head told him Harry had probably been completely lost without the help of him nor any of his friends. It therefore wouldn't have surprised Draco if Harry hadn't come up with any sort of plan; just hoped he would be able to fight a huge fire-breathing creature
'You dating Viktor Krum! Harry's rival!' Ron suddenly shouted at her. Draco and Harry both took a step back, surprised by his loud voice but Hermione didn't even flinch.
'But how do I stop him from killing me? How's giving him an opportunity to hurt me going to help to take the locket away?' He had already been alone with Draco the night before, but it had seemed as if the locket had waited for him to fall asleep before devouring its prey. It had seemed as if it had been waiting for Harry to come even closer to him, to trust him. But Harry didn't trust this new Draco at all — the Draco that was possessed by a part of Voldemort's soul. He had to destroy it, as he simply had gotten lucky last night, but doubted if it would be the same for the one to follow.
With his eyes opened for only a quarter of their size, he started to tell in as great detail as he could about his vision; how he had seen Voldemort in a furious state. 'He's upset. Upset that we have destroyed so many horcruxes already. He had no idea.' Apparently the monster had visited every location of the horcruxes they had already found; only to find them gone, taken away from him while he had remained in the unknown. 'I saw a flash of a castle as well,' Harry then said. 'Hogwarts.'
Blue in the palm of his hand, accompanied by shining silver. Snake-like hissing and whispers; demanding him to put its physical form down. The voice came from behind him, somewhere in the distance. It was too faint to draw his attention, so Harry continued to look at the shining item in his hand. The diadem was simply mesmerizing and seemed to enchant him bit by bit. Why did Voldemort have to choose such beautiful items, he wondered. It was simply sorrowful to destroy them.
'So, you walked all day and night?' Hermione then asked, leaning close to Harry to be able to look into his eyes but Harry didn't let her. He nodded, even though he knew it was totally impossible he and Draco had been casually walking for hours on end. 'You're such a liar, Harry. Why don't you just tell us where you really were? Is it that big of a secret?'
Draco looked down at his wrist, noticing that Seamus had never let go of it. 'Oh, sorry,' the boy mumbled and let go, smiling a bit awkwardly. 'I'm sorry about the other day as well — you know, when we didn't say anything to you. You were—‘
It only made Dumbledore sigh. 'You always have.' He rose from his seat again, opened a cabinet to his left and took out some glasses. After drinking their stomachs full, Dumbledore sat down again as if satisfied. 'What is the reason for your foolish behavior? You say you had no choice; well, explain to me why not.'
But their moment of victory got disrupted quite fast again as Dumbledore and Voldemort came closer to them, destroying the atrium's statue in their way and making it clatter to pieces on the tiled floor. Harry and his friends had to jump away to not get hit by gold, their hands on their heads as they waited for it all to be over. Voldemort produced a snake of fire from his wand, filling the whole room with burning flames. The heat was almost too much to handle but fortunately Dumbledore extinguished the flames with water before anyone could get burned by it, their clothes now soaking wet as they crawled to their feet and tried to find a better place to hide.
His vision became blurry, and made him stumble over something on his way. He hit the ground face first, and head quickened footsteps hurry themselves over grass behind his back. Harry’s footsteps neared as he crawled to his feet again as fast as he could, unwilling to let the boy see him cry. But the boy was faster and took ahold of his arm. ‘Draco,’ he started, but Draco roughly pulled his arm away.
Ron isn't really feeling happy about the fact that they're visiting Malfoy, he told Harry that just when they’d arrived. Not to mention that it was written all over his face.
“It was alright. Petunia’s cooking has never been the best, let’s face it… And Dudley was acting all strange." Draco's lips curled slightly, and there were no explaining words needed for the both of them to understand why exactly he'd been acting that way. "I was wondering though," Harry continued, "should I have brought something for you as well? Foods or drinks?”
Both Harry as Ron smiled brightly at Hermione's cleverness before getting fresh, casual clothes thrown in their arms and hurrying themselves out onto the busy street again. The adventure — the hunt — had finally begun. It was an unexpected start on an unexpected day, but it had started wether they liked it or not. They were maybe going to have to change location every week, perhaps every day to stay safe — but it was a mission that had to be done, that had to be completed in order for their loved ones to survive and live on.
It also wasn't as if Draco himself went unnoticed; he got approached multiple times by both girls and boys. A group of Hufflepuff girls had been following him on his way to the library, asking wether he already had a date. Draco had answered with a simple
His best friend now hurries over to his side of the cubicle, leaning against his desk. 'So, you do remember how we put away all of the left-over Death Eaters a few years ago, right?' He asks.
Feeling worn-out, Draco lowered his other hand as well and nodded his head slowly. He then glanced over his shoulder at the others; most of them with tears in their eyes and the girls their heads resting on the boys their shoulders. 'It's all my fault,' he then said, whispered.
The girl didn't seem to know what was happening to her nor to why Draco suddenly seemed to hate her so deeply, but she also didn't dare to ask him why. Draco even made her trip in a crowded hallways once, and didn't feel the slightest guilt for it. She had stolen
physical yet,' he told Harry with a grin, quickly flushing a bright red again. The boy looked up into his eyes and smiled hesitantly.
Disclaimer: I don't own anything Harry Potter. Also this is my first ever Drarry/Magical fic and my Mother language also isn't English so please excuse any mistakes I made.
One boy from Durmstrang had also dared to approach him. The boy had marched through the hallway all alone, face set to determination. He had stopped in front of Draco with the sound of clicking heels and the whole approach had frozen Draco to the spot. He had been alone as well, books clutched to his chest. 'I,
Harry lifted his hands in surrender. Ok, maybe that one had been on purpose. 'I don't know, alright?' he said with a shrug. 'Probably an elegant animal or something; maybe some kind of bird?'
He had also written long letters to Sirius, explaining everything that had happened the past year, but every response he got had been short, only a few sentences long and very prompt. It was as if everyone who mattered to him, beside from Draco, were avoiding him.
Draco now was the one to laugh and turned his head to look into Harry's eyes; to capture their smile. With one of his long fingers he wiped away some dirt that was still stuck to the boy's face; a reminder of a battle they had fought only a few hours ago. But even though the thoughts of evil and danger started circulating through his head again; he couldn't help but feel happy and glad to have Harry by his side again — to be able to lay down on his cloud-like bed and have the only person he truly loved next to him. '
Harry apparently seemed to know what his strength was as he didn't have to think about it for longer than a few seconds. 'Flying. I'm good at flying,' he answered.
Another nod followed as Dumbledore poured the distorted memory of Slughorn into the pensieve. 'Take a look for yourself, my boy. Perhaps you will then understand what I mean.' Before Harry did just that, he glanced at Draco behind him — still aimlessly staring at something on Dumbledore's desk. 'Don't worry too much about him, Harry; he has worries of his own as well which are much greater than you may think.' Looking in the headmaster's bright blue eyes, Harry couldn't quite decipher what the old man was trying to say by that.
As the silence grew to its peak and Draco decided it may have been a mistake to follow Harry to Hogsmeade in the first place, Harry finally opened his mouth. 'I do, you know,' the boy said. It came out only a little louder than a whisper.
looked like an imbecile! Unless Harry thought his tailored trousers, expensive cotton jumpers and exclusively made festivity robes were what an imbecile wore. Draco could even win awards for best dressed Wizard if he wanted to! 'What did you just call me?' he asked, chin held up high to defend his pride.
'Because I-I didn't dare to tell them to you, Harry. I knew you would react like t-this,' Draco stammered and felt the first tear run down his cheek — but Harry didn't want any of it, pulled his hands easily out of Draco's as he had always been
, at least tell me why you're meeting with him almost every night — always on the seventh floor — always in
Harry's eyes are still focused on the door's art when someone pulls it open from the inside. Unlike last time, it's Malfoy himself who opens the door. On his face isn't the normal scowl as usual, but an expression as if someone just died — the vision of a fading soul still visible in his eyes. It wasn't exactly the mirror of Harry's small smile that he put on as the door swung open, expecting a welcoming house-elf to greet him like last time.
'So; I had been thinking — as I connected it to the visions you have from the eyes of You-Know-Who — what if that prophecy has something to do with you? Or what if it's about you?'
seemed to count. Yet Draco knew this moment of peace couldn't last. Outside of their little circle, outside their safe-haven of spells; there was a war going on. The monster wasn't defeated yet, nor were his followers. There still was a lot that had to be done, and Draco knew Harry had been given a task — a task of finding certain things that belonged to Voldemort — objects similar to the locket he had worn. Why else had they been so desperate to retrieve it?
He could feel Harry's heartbeat raise at his words, the cheeky gleam he had seen earlier returning to his green eyes. The boy smirked before pressing his lips against Draco's, deepening the kiss with a clumsy move of his tongue. 'You look
.' Draco's heartbeat fastened, the sword now raised above his head, his thin arms trembling under its weight. '
'Yes,' another voice now added. Cho Chang came into the picture — still making a certain feeling of jealousy and anger well up inside of Draco's chest. 'It belonged to the founder of Ravenclaw. But it's lost, Luna. No-one has seen in it years.'
Potter shakes his head. ‘I’m sorry, Malfoy, but neither I or any other Auror is authorized to examine Dolohov’s body. It’s currently being examined by a special department for cursed corpses.’
inch of you.' The most wonderful smile Draco had ever seen graced the boy's face shortly after, and he wasn't able to say anything more.
Another glance at Draco, sitting there lifelessly and showing no affection nor emotion at all. 'I wonder wether that part of him is still there,' Harry replied. From what he saw, the current Draco wasn't interested in being kissed or hugged at all — simply seemed as if wanting to destroy everything around his very figure.
'Pointing a wand at a professor, Potter? Twenty-five points from Gryffindor. Now sit back down and concentrate!' Snape spat out as a response but Harry didn't even budge, bit down on his teeth again and felt more anger leave from his heart to the tip of his wand. 'Fine; then stand.' A new legimency spell got casted from Snape's wand; its pale white color bursting in Harry's direction — but with the single flick of his wrist, Harry casted a
Harry sighed as he thought about his words. Was he really the only one that could defeat Voldemort? Well, he was his archenemy and he had been part of his earlier defeat and rebirth so perhaps — perhaps he
Draco's head turned towards professor Severus Snape, seated next to his father with his eyes focused on the table. He had heard the Order talk about him being on the good side — only pretending to still be a Death Eater to help the Order. Yet, Draco found it difficult to believe the man's true identity after murdering headmaster Dumbledore. 'Mister Idel had indeed kept something from you, my Lord,' he stated. 'He had forgotten to inform you about the help that Draco had provided him with. Help with the Vanishing Cabinet which was supposed to be his task
A weight; fallen off his shoulders but stuck in his stomach now. A part of his task might be taken away but he had Dumbledore's cursed self to worry about now. Another lie added to the bunch; another thing he wouldn't be able to tell Harry about. But Dumbledore had said he had his own task for Harry; would soon tell him about it and maybe tell Draco about it as well. Would that help with taking more weight and worries away? Would it be able to set things right again and destroy the Dark Lord for good? Defeat him?
Draco didn't care; he only cared about the boy. Wether he was smart or brave or evil. As he looked over his shoulder again, his eyes found the boy's greens — but this time the boy quickly looked away, almost feeling caught glancing at Draco himself. He felt a slight blush appear on his cheeks but it disappeared as fast as it came when Dumbledore cleared his throat to make an announcement.
Slightly surprised by this new information, Harry gave Draco a strange look. “You don’t sleep either?” Another shake of his head. “Then what do you do the entire night?”
It was Sunday and Draco had left the girls behind in their carriage's common room. He had decided to go for a walk. A white scarf graced his neck upon a pale blue, thick knitted jumper and of course he was wearing one of his many hats again. He’d passed by a part of the Black Lake and Hagrid's little cabin to then return back to the castle itself and follow the natural path towards the clocktower courtyard. And it had been then that he had found Harry, talking to his friends as if no argument had ever happened. He’d felt betrayed at first, but quickly reminded himself that he’d been the one to actually
Dark clouds seemed to clear from Harry's eyes and the sun shone brightly through his emeralds. He took off his invisibility cloak and held out his Golden Egg to Draco. ‘Is that why I had to bring the Egg?’
'I thought you wouldn't push me anymore!' he shouted, giving Draco a vile look. Noticing that Draco wasn't holding his timepiece either, seemed to make the boy even more furious. 'And you weren't even timing me? What's wrong with you today? Have you finally given up on this
Letting out a sigh and suspiciously glancing at the twins talking to the others, Draco quickly knocked and hoped he could escape into Madame's office before the twins wanted to join them as well — it would become quite the fiasco with having the duo by his side while trying to explain something serious. 'Are you coming with me?' Draco then asked. He might not need the extravagant support of his best friends; Harry's support was always welcome.
'Don't touch anything!' was Hermione's reaction immediately, but not even a second later Harry touched a candle holder with his foot; multiplying it as well.
Making his way downstairs, he was met with the smell of bacon floating through the air. It made his painfully empty stomach grumble. Briefly, Harry looked into the kitchen where he found his nephew, aunt and uncle around the table, eating the very bacon he smelled and knew Dudley so desperately wanted. Nobody noticed him, and even if they had, neither of them would've invited him to come have breakfast anyway. Vernon had never changed his mind in sixteen years, and he definitely wasn't going to that day.
Harry followed his eyes to the mermaid and shook his head. 'Beside from them having a fin and living in the water; I have no clue.'
Harry shook his head, confusing Dudley even more. 'But — but he said we had to leave for safety. Will he be alright?'
— that didn't give Malfoy the right to refuse him from returning, did it? He was an Auror, wasn’t he? Didn’t he
Sixteen years later nothing much had changed. Harry was still the black sheep of the family; a kind of disease in human form that was kept to be a secret — as much as it could be. The only thing that
? A true Death Eater? A child's fantasy, it was. Draco's fantasy. But that day; it wasn't his fantasy anymore. It had become like a duty; a way of protecting his family.
There was something about Draco that felt so intimidating at that moment; perhaps the way he could basically
Voldemort slowly nodded his head. 'Indeed, but it has recently been returned to me.' His eyes quickly wandered off in Bellatrix her direction. Draco followed his eyes to see a satisfied and a look of pride gracing Bellatrix' face. Was she perhaps the one to have returned it to him? 'And I am not planning on ever having it stolen again. Therefore it must be guarded, protected by someone's life.'
Footsteps then silenced his thoughts, resounded through the Hall of Prophecies like landing feathers; soft and silently creeping towards them in the dark. He felt the eyes of someone luring at him, at the prophecy he held in his hand. They still had their wands drawn, a bright Lumos enlightening a circle of blue light around them.
Harry sighs. 'The curse that spreads from his Dark Mark slowly turns his entire body into the color black. It has spread quite far already; leaving no spot on Malfoy's left arm nor hand the pale white shade they once were. It's quite… frightening.'
Lucius was now the one to bite his teeth out of anger, and to hit his son right in the face — a hard slap that made the boy stumble backwards and fall to the floor. Draco could feel a painful feeling spread over his stomach, could feel his scars suddenly hurt more than before. He swore that he could hear them rip as he laid there — his pajamas slowly coloring themselves crimson. Looking up at his father again, he was met with disappointment readable on the man's face instead of worry for his hurt son. 'I have been protecting you all along, Draco. You and you mother. Why can't you simply see that this is the only way for me to do so? That obeying the Lord is the only way for me to protect this family?'
Lost for words, Harry remained silent for a good minute. He just needed a moment to let it all drench into his brain; let all this new,
'But what if he doesn't? I can't tell him anything… I can't tell you anything,' Draco replied. Thoughts were racing through his head; memories of Harry and him mixed with the few fights they had multiplied by three times. What if he wouldn't be able to find a way to avoid his task? What if he would
With a sigh Harry turned himself to Ron in order to get a reaction from him; but all the red-head seemed to be interested in were his chocolate frogs and how fast he could eat them. 'I just wish I would stop worrying about him — but I can't.'
Obeying Hermione's words, Harry approached Draco by the night's fall. The sun had made its way above their heads, slowly sunken away into the night. A few stars were already coming through, and Draco hadn't moved at all since the morning. He hadn't eaten, slept, or done anything but sit by the shore and watch the waves pull back and forth. On the exact same spot, his back scary straight, his eyes never blinking once.
Draco braided one side of his hair into multiple braids, making an intricate design. The rest of his long, silver locks he tucked away underneath a white hat he had bought especially for formal occasions, and which matched perfectly with his beautiful robes. They were a delicate pale blue with intricate silver and golden accents. The fabric glittered in the right light, and they were simply more mesmerizing than any of the girls' dresses. Draco liked to brag with that fact, quite a lot.
'Anything,' Ginny's voice declared as she came into view — her orange Weasley-hair as vibrant as ever. The others agreed with nodding heads, whispering the same word that had left the girl's lips.
His grey eyes find Harry's again and within them there's nothing close to a lie; only truth and sadness. 'I'm sorry about that…'
Draco thought to himself. And at that thought, he suddenly didn't feel so sad and lonely anymore; Harry was still his friend. Harry still needed his help…
Footsteps neared, but Draco's head was spinning and he didn't feel so well. Voldemort stopped in front of him, looked down upon his helpless figure with an almost cheerful look in his eyes. ‘Stay away from him!’ Draco heard behind his back. He didn’t look to see whom had said it, nor who grabbed him by his robes and pulled him away from the monster in front of him. It could’ve been Hermione. It could’ve been the twins. He truly didn’t know.
With a soft thud he landed just outside of the Manor's gates; their iron dooming up above him and making it feel like a cage. Draco's hands were sweating — his palms warm instead of their usual coldness as he waited for his parents to notice his presence and for them to open the gates. It seemed to take them longer than usual and Draco's nervosity only increased as he stood there and waited to be greeted in any way possible. Would he be hugged as all the years before? Or would a hand greet him with a slap in the face? Perhaps a curse would hit him before he would see either of his parents appear — putting him out of his misery for good or turning him into a statue of stone to decorate their entryway.
The healer replied with a sigh and guided the man to a door at the end of the hallway. Harry and Ron followed a few seconds laters. What they saw inside the room made both their stomachs flip.
,' he said with a grin before getting drawn into a kiss — finally feeling Harry's soft lips against his again.
and his followers while making their future, macabre plans. 'Ah, Draco,' a voice then said, one he recognized most of all. 'I am glad to see you have healed well.'
Aware of how close the other man finds himself to his former archenemy, he takes a step away from Harry's chair.
Catching for breath he'd not been able to breathe during the short moment, Harry let his head hang. "What was that?" he asked, slightly afraid to look at Draco once more.
Well, clever the girl was for noticing that but Draco couldn't help but feel that it wasn't all she wanted to say. Hermione remained quiet, awaiting Draco's answer as she closed the old book she had been reading. 'I just want to help him,' Draco admitted.
Harry's eyes found their way back to Draco’s scar which had become fully exposed again as the foam had slowly melted away. ‘But—‘ The boy cut off his own question, perhaps too afraid to ask.
'Innocent? I don't believe it!' Another student now shouted. 'Besides, he hasn't even been sorted properly, has he? Just because he's Harry's boyfriend doesn't mean he
. He turned around to call for the boy but noticed that he had already disappeared, left Draco to storming off. Draco took a deep sigh. Tomorrow there would be time enough to tell Harry he was sorry and had misunderstood his words; misunderstood his feelings.
Nothing happens for a while; he doesn't feel anything nor see anything special he isn't supposed to see. He just feels the same as he did before; empty, hollow and still on the verge of Death. Potter stares so intensely at him as if to make the spell react by his fearful look. After another few minutes he relaxes his intense stair and his muscles, slumping his shoulder and taking a step closer to Draco.
His fingers slowly slide over its strings, listening to the faint sound lifting from it. It has been a long, long while since he played. Probably since the day the Dark Lord decided that the Manor would become his house, his headquarters. Draco hadn't dare to touch a single string of the violin, afraid it's sound would annoy the Dark Lord and make him pay a high price for that annoyance.
The boy had dragged him into a deserted classroom and had blocked the door with his body — pointing his wand in Draco's direction. Of course Draco had drawn his own wand as well; and together like full-on enemies they had thrown vile glares at each other for a few seconds. 'Who are you?' Draco had then asked.
In less than a second Draco had drawn his wand again, pointed its intricate golden tip at Harry's best friend. '
But his fame wasn’t as big of a problem in France as it had been in England — which had also been a part of their decision to move away. In London every Wizard or Witch would recognize him immediately. They almost couldn’t go anywhere without anyone wanting an autograph or picture with the famous wizards —
Pulling his blanket a little closer to his body and closing his eyes, Draco didn't even blame himself for going back to sleep. Lucky Harry would probably do that as well, eventually; Draco knew his luck had definitely ran out now he was on the floor next to his bed — regretting everything he had done the last few seconds.
Memories returned to him — memories of which he wasn't sure were even his. It were his hands, it was his reflection in the mirror, his voice — yet it didn't seem to be truly him whom did and said all those things. He wanted to apologize again, but quickly understood it wasn't his fault, but that of the thing Harry was holding onto so dearly.
Umbridge frowned her eyebrows and straightened the bow on her head a little. 'And that matter may be?'
Telling the girls to go ahead of him, that he would catch up later, he let himself fall down at the bottom of the stairs. He watched the rain fall slowly outside the entrance's doors, the drops falling down faster and harder by the second. Water bubbles hitting stone; coloring the ground a shade darker than usual. In only a few minutes the faint drizzle had become the downpour it had been a few weeks ago. He watched it in silence as he thought of what plan Fleur might have come up with. Whatever it was; Draco wouldn't be a part of it. Of course Fleur wanted him by her side before and after every task, she had made that clear even before she became a Champion — but Draco had thought and hoped he would
'It's not important… But Malfoy's case is. He's suffering from the same curse as Dolohov and probably all the other Death Eaters before they died.'
, he thought to himself. Harry still didn't know wether Draco had survived the curse he had casted at him — wether he was safe in the hands of Snape or in those of whoever he had taken him to. It pained him to think about it again, and quickly Harry tucked the timepiece away.
As Madame had told them, the Headmaster of Hogwarts had a grand entrance planned for the two foreign schools. The man himself was currently talking to his own students in what they called the Great Hall but could be found similar to the dining chamber back at Beauxbatons. Draco and the girls were waiting on one side of the wide hallway, the boys of Durmstrang on the other side. Positioned in front of the girls, Draco tried to block the view on his lovely ladies from the Bulgarian beasts. Beside keeping his chin up high, he also kept his eyes locked with that of the youngest Quidditch star in history;
It had been terrible, to see blood wherever he placed his feet. To see the whites of ones eyes as they stared into a void of dreams that weren’t there. Shouting, screaming, crying. His ears were deaf. His eyes were blind. He only focused on the ones in front of him — the men, the enemy that had broke trough the walls created by the greatest wizards combined.
Harry grumbled a response and dragged himself down the stairs, passed his aunt fanning herself with a magazine and uncle Vernon slowly melting away on the couch. August the second marked the hottest day of the year, and it was clearly noticeable. He sauntered down the street, past the old lady from across who never stopped talking about her cats. She waved at him while strolling along, back to her cat-filled home. As he neared the small park in Magnolia Crescent, he could already spot his cousin and his friends from afar. They were teasing a child again, probably asking for his money or just annoying him out of boredom. Harry sighed, knowing that he couldn't do much about it as his nephew was twice his size.
' followed by an exclamation mark, a badge that every Hogwarts student seemed to wear. Draco even caught a few of his girls pinning one on their chest, but at the sight of it alone — them making holes in their fine silk robes — Draco had banned them from their figures, carriage and overall life immediately.
The furious look from Draco's eyes now filled his whole face; his eyebrows frown and his mouth a thin line as he took a step closer to the monster without hesitation. 'I will never join your side,' he said to him with hands balled to fists. If one could spit flames from his eyes; this definitely would have been the moment where Voldemort would've caught fire.
'Are you on your way to Hogsmeade?' Draco asked him, tilting his head slightly and clutching the books he brought a bit closer to his chest.
An overload of crimson awaited Draco as he entered the Gryffindor common room, his hand in Harry's and his best friends lingering behind them. The picture of Harry flying on a broom he had seen two years ago greeted him again with a smile and Draco felt at least a little at home. Students who hadn't seen him in potions or in the hallway gave him a strange look; questioning what a blond boy in blue was doing in their common room. Not daring to look into their eyes; afraid to see the hate they felt for both him as his father, Draco looked at his feet as he immediately took the stairs to the boy's dormitory.
It unfolded in front of his eyes, grew bigger and scarier by the second as it towered above their figures — then above all the large piles that surrounded them. Draco's eyes found Castor's, whom faced the fire with a fear in his eyes Draco for once could understand.
'I believe it is,' Hermione said. 'And maybe not from the Draco we know, but from the evil one controlled by the locket.'
'I know a way,' Harry answered, taking out the timepiece he got from Draco. It moved slightly, but Harry noticed it was just ticking seconds away like a normal clock would do. 'It's not working,' he said with a sigh — but it was too early; the big hand moved to number twelve all of a sudden, staying there and pointing to the dark aisle in front of them. 'This way!' he announced, already running in the direction the big hand was pointing him in. His feet couldn't keep up with his adrenaline, with his need to bring Draco to safety. He was there; it hadn't been a dream. Turning right and then left again, passing rows and rows of glass orbs in their way, they finally came to a halt in the center where four aisles met. Harry watched how the big hand kept spinning around in circles, declaring that Draco was exactly there were they were standing. 'It doesn't make sense,' he said, sighing deeply. 'He should be here.'
'H-Harry?' A whispering voice, a cold hand upon his face. Harry pushed the hand away; he himself too busy with fighting against the enemy in his head.
As Madame left the room, Draco sat himself down on one of the sofas. He had a lot to think about; especially about Harry. Perhaps it was good that they had had a small argument earlier; maybe it would be easier to ignore him now. He had helped him with all the information he had on dragons, hadn't he? Surely he would find
. His cheeks were burning and he felt dozens of eyes casted upon him; the silence from the dining chamber disturbed by Draco's fury. 'What's wrong?' Ansel asked him, pulling his robes to get him to sit down again. Whenever the twins were making a scene; it didn't really matter — but when their best friend was making one; it was possibly the end of the world. And it worried the boys, Draco could see that by their facial expressions. Draco sat down again and balled his hands into fists, the parchment of Harry's letter crumbling slightly underneath his fingers.
Tall grasses were surrounding them, the wind whispering unknown words in their ears. The Burrow could still be seen from where they stood, the roof of the structure rising above all. He had drifted off again; searched for a calm and quiet place amidst all the chaos of having the entire Order at the Weasleys' their house. Nodding to Fleur's words, he rose and followed the girl dressed in blue.
The last thing Harry remembered was feeling a soft, warm breeze blowing over his face — followed by the darkness of sleep.
great of a support in the first place; he simply wasn't strong enough to help the boy. A few kisses were shared before Draco helped him crawl through the portrait hole, into the equally loving arms of his friends. He could see Seamus and Dean hurrying themselves over to Harry to help him, as well as a boy he had never seen before. A funny looking plant he held in his hands with great care but was put aside immediately as he noticed his hurt friend. How wonderful they were, Harry's friends; caring for him like Draco knew the girls cared for him as well. He waved at them and they waved back before guiding Harry to one of the sofas, pushing a first year off of it to make room. Yes, Draco could definitely be friends with those Gryffindors.
can't certainly see me here in London!' he told him, glancing over his shoulder to only see some confused Muggles stare back.
'It's a French book, actually,' she replied. 'One with special spells and curses that were invented and are mainly used in France.'
Harry gave him a smile. 'I don't care what your hair looks like, Draco. What only matters is you as a person; your soul of gold and blue,' he told him. 'And if you really want to know what I think about it — I find it truly adorable.' Harry's hand messed up Draco's with a single movement of his hand, making it a resemblance of his own.
Harry couldn't help but laugh, but as he let himself fall down on Draco's actual bed — his smile disappeared and a loud moan escaped from his mouth as if he had just fallen onto a cloud. 'Heaven!' he declared and stretched out his limbs. His green eyes searched for Draco whom had seated himself on the edge of the bed; was watching the raven-haired boy slowly sink away into the many pillows and blankets and make an imaginary snow-angel in the sheets of pure white. His greedy hand then took ahold of Draco's arm and pulled him down, closer to him before he wrapped his entire body around the blond. 'Now heaven's complete,' he whispered and kissed Draco on his cheek.
“I know I don't look exactly alive, but I most certainly still am. And still would like to be,” Malfoy says to him. Again, his words come out in whispers. And before Harry has time to react to those words, a few tears roll over Malfoy's cheeks, leaving glittering trails behind.
The boy's grip was tight, and indeed terribly hurtful. It was extremely hot, as if he was pouring boiling water on his own skin. Still, Harry kept his lips tightly shut about it, and bit through the pain. The boy needed help, needed to be supported or he'd fall. "What was all that?" Harry then asked, out of breath as he tried to fight the pain he felt around his arm.
The rest of the day turned out clumsy as well. Draco'd accidentally pushed someone's pencil case off their table as he'd roamed through one of Harry's classrooms, followed by him bumping into someone's locker and sending the loudest bang metal could make through the hallways. The students, however, hadn't seen anything weird about it and had just glanced around to see who'd been idiotic enough to bump into one of the lockers. Draco'd always been clumsy; even before he'd become an angel. His brothers told him he was the most elegant looking of them all, but when it came to elegance in
Was there really nothing to be found about that place? Wasn't the Malfoy-line one of the most prestige Pureblood ones in history? Surely there would be
Grabbing a chair for himself now as well, Harry sat himself down and stared out of the window. There were a lot of stars tonight. Tiny dots of fire, thousands and thousands of miles away. He placed a hand on Draco's thigh, drew a few circles with his index finger as a loving gesture. 'What now,' Draco asked, a sigh escaping his mouth.
Stumbling towards the door, he took ahold of the handle and tried to turn the knob around — yet it wouldn't open. He pulled, he turned, he pushed —
Harry shrugs. 'I guess I hated you back at Hogwarts… but that has changed. The- the moment it changed isn't really a good memory to the both of us, but- do we have any good memories of each other to start with?'
Harry pressed his lips against Draco's again and brushed softly through his long hair with his fingers. Draco himself let his hands go through the boy's messy hair as well. He had always wanted to touch it; mess it up even more.
It felt as if his body got split into two. As if his scars were ripped open again and warm, dark blood was seeping out. He tried to breathe, but his lungs protested. He tried to understand, but his mind was failing. His eyes saw the truth; they saw the lifeless body of his lover held in the arms of a man. His face set peaceful. His eyes closed.
As they both had moved onto Draco's bed again, keeping each other tightly in an embrace, they had slowly drifted off into a wonderful sleep.
Harry smiled weakly again. 'At least Hedwig won't have to fly such long distances to deliver a letter to you then.' Draco grinned at his words and kissed the boy on his cheek.
Right that moment Ron came walking in again, nearly dropping the bowl of water at hearing Hermione's speculations. 'Are you sure?' he asked while handing the bowl to Draco.
wand pointed at the old man's face — ready to cast the spell of Death and complete the task he was so desperately trying to get rid of.
'No idea. Ran into Draco yesterday evening and he basically shoved me a piece of parchment in my hands and took off without a single word.'
Standing still in the doorway for another moment, Harry faces Malfoy again and finds his grey eyes. They once again looks sad and lost. A soft frown of eyebrows. His right pale hand placed on the wooden door with much delicacy. How could a man be so gracious without even trying?
She shakes her head. "I'm just… worried about you, Draco. You haven't been outside in five years, you know that?"
… Let's see what rooms Madame has provided you with so we can all fresh ourselves up a little bit. Maybe get some rest — I believe your headmaster won't be returning any time soon.'
The boy now pushed the attic's ladder down, through the hatch and heard how it hit the carpeted floor of the hallway with a bang, then climbed down its wonky rungs. He yawned, let a hand ruffle through his hair and slowly shuffled his way to the bathroom. However, halfway through the hallway a door to his right opened and slammed him in the face. "
He stormed out of the Great Hall, chin held up high as he tried not to sulk over Fleur's words. Just because she didn't want to communicate with anyone from the other school, didn't mean Draco couldn't. Of course he kept the girls as far away from the other students as he could, but that didn't mean they couldn't be friends with any. It was just a precaution to try and avoid hearts getting broken. Did no-one understand?
It had been so clear; his mother's trembling hands as she had read her newspaper and sipped from her tea. A second chair that was drawn back a bit from the table and her grey eyes that had been glancing at the door behind her the whole time. She nodded her head as an answer and as if on cue, the same door she had been glancing at opened up a bit; a gleaming red eye staring in Draco's direction from the dark.
The boy, named Harry, sighed deeply. Every morning he got woken the same way, every morning he woke from his dreams so suddenly that he forgot them instantly — forgot an imaginary world and all its secrets. Instead he was given a life at his aunt's house, in a world were things were unfair for orphans like himself. A world where he was slowly going mad because of it. He'd been keeping up with it for about sixteen years by now, and looked eagerly forward to the day he could leave. Gone from the noise. Gone from a family that never liked him in the first place.
‘Like a nervous fourth-year that was forced into a Tournament of Death,' was Draco's reply. The boy sighed deeply and kept glancing at his time-piece, afraid they would run late even though they still had more than an hour left.
Now Draco was the one to laugh. 'Well, he has been known to be a Death Eater as well — together with
*wipes away tear* It's over... It's the end... I'm a bit sad, not going to lie. I truly enjoyed writing my French!Draco and everything Beauxbatons themed. Perhaps I should something similar but Durmstrang style, haha? Or just move the whole thing to Beauxbatons, what about that? I seriously am not ready to let anything from this magical, Papillon world go. But for now, I say farewell and thank you all for sticking around and reading my story. I truly hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
The leather glove also gets thrown somewhere on the floor and black slender fingers curl and uncurl themselves in front of Harry's eyes. Harry can see the curse hover at the skin's transition from his shoulder to chest, ready to take over another part of Malfoy's body at any given time.
Draco didn't know what to say; he had already tried to get the idea out of Harry's head ever since he had told him about Castor being a Death Eater and to why he had been going to the seventh floor so often. All he had told Harry was that there was a special room; the Room of Requirement which held many objects that were either lost or hidden away for strange reasons. He hadn't dared to say a word about the object they had been working on; a cabinet of which Draco had no idea of what it did. All he knew was that there had to be certain spells cast upon it of which Castor wasn't powerful enough to do so himself — and apparently, Draco was.
Three sugar cubes disappear in the hot water again, the peacock on the china cup slightly shaking its head in disgust. It makes Potter snort and Draco look up in confusion.
Harry's arm slipped around Draco's waist and on the tips of his toes, he bend a forward a little to whisper something in his ear. 'Would you like to see where I sleep?'
Draco's eyes immediately found Harry's as he turned a corner and walked towards the group of Champions and their dates. The boy was wearing bottle green robes that matched his eyes perfectly, even Draco could see that from afar. His hair wasn't as messy as usual but he slid a hand through it at the sight of Draco, messing it up to its usual disaster again. His lips were slightly parted and his eyes opened wide; almost as if he was awestruck by the sight of Draco, just as the girls had been. But apparently, everyone seemed to feel the same way, as they looked at him rather than at Fleur.
Harry now slammed the bathroom door shut, locked it and left Draco outside whom still had his eyes cast upon that chubby uncle and nephew of Harry.
Harry once again pushed up his spectacles and stared at the ground as if he found the grass underneath his feet
in the same sentence. Didn't he think about those two words together earlier this evening? He doesn't remember. But why does he always get this strange feeling in his heart when he sees Malfoy? His thoughts wander off to when he waited at Malfoy's door earlier; taking in the intricate design of the wooden door again. It took him only one knock before Malfoy had opened the door; staring at him with parted lips and a look on his face that almost seemed to radiate '
Slowly, Lucius shook his head. 'You are indeed still a child, I see,' was all he had left to say, before turning around and leaving Draco's room.
But even though there was no escape; Draco knew that he would never truly obey his orders. He would try to please him for as long as he could; make it seem like he was obeying him but in the end figure out another way. Because there always was another way, right?
For a moment the little girl hesitated, unsure who this strange figure was that had joined her family. Until she finally grasped who and
. Something was there shining bright daylight. Draco followed her eyes from the globe to the dragon in front of her, still cornered and chained to one of the marble pillars of the underground structure. 'You don't mean—,' Draco began, but his voice was cut off by a certain fear. The French had never liked dragons very much, even though his name meant
A fury rose to his head before it started spinning of exhaustion, his body having to lay itself down in order to stay wake. In those moments he heard Voldemort say something — laugh again — but on his face was still readable that he was confused by what Draco had done. That he felt defeated, somehow. Or weaker than he had done before.
With hesitant steps, Draco entered Madame's office with Harry on his heels. Many times already he had been there; learning new spells or just to talk and clear his head. Walls painted a lilac shade greeted them as they turned a corner, the golden decoration from the chateau drawn through and making the ceiling look a little more intricate. Little lights like those of stars floated around everywhere; making tiny magical sounds which reminded Draco of Headmaster Dumbledore's office he swiftly got to visit the year before. A desk of pure marble was placed in the center of the room, joined by a comfortable looking chair cushioned in purple velvet — Madame Maxime was seated atop that exact chair, a quill in one of her hands and a long scroll of parchment placed in front of her. Behind her back one could see the beauty of the French pyrenees and a glimpse of Beauxbatons' gigantic Quidditch pitch next to its maze.
that he saw. The fog of panic then faded away a little, and his mind was quick to make out a person, a boy around his age, on the street. Skin as white as the snow around him, hair the same shade. Clothing an ethereal white too, from his silk shirt to his trousers. Barefoot.
The trio fell silent. Non of them knew what to say. Maybe Ron and Hermione did, but whatever they had to discuss with each other didn't seem to be meant for Harry's ears. The veil of silence covered the old sofas, bookcases and brought with it the insufferable scent of mold. The ticking of rain against glass could still be heard, as well as muffled sounds from an angry portrait in the hall. As Harry was about to drift off to the kitchen, to find something to eat, Hermione sighed deeply and opened her mouth again. 'I believe it's time we choose a date to visit the Manor, Harry,' she said. 'We've waited long enough — nothing will change.'
Draco felt like a child as he stamped with one of his feet, his anger trying to burst out of his body as well as his tears. 'I am not my father! And I'll never,
'So where are you going with this? Is there someone inside Azkaban that murdered all the Death Eaters in secret or something?' Harry starts to lose his nerve. Could Ron please just come to the point?
'No — not at all.' Shaking her head far too many times, Hermione looked away from Draco's eyes. The draping got drawn aside again, startling now both Draco as Hermione. To their relief, it was Harry's face that doomed up between all the glittering gold.
Placing a hand on the boy's shoulder and giving him a kiss on the cheek, Draco threw him a smile and gestured for him to follow. 'We should go before we're late.'
'Take me away? To where?' Harry frowned his eyebrows as he went through every possible option in his head. Hogwarts? The Burrow? Draco wouldn't take him to the Manor, would he?
did he know his full name? Shaking his head a little now, Harry opened the hinge again, pushed the ladder down. "Get ready to answer a million more questions when I return."
"What if you just relax and sit down so you don't wake up my cousin with your back and forth pacing."
And off they were; hesitantly leaving their safe spot to face the streets of Hogsmeade. They immediately hid themselves behind another house's facade after taking a few steps, peered around the corner again to then move over to the house on the other side of the street. But as they did, the same ear-deafening alarm they had heard in Wiltshire went off — was blasted throughout the entire village. 'Oh Merlin,' Draco heard Ron say with a sigh before they ran off — into a deserted alleyway.
,' he suddenly heard. It was Madame Maxime's voice; there was no doubt about that. He leaned against the opened portrait, eyes on Madame as she seated herself next to the fireplace in a large purple sofa. 'Hopefully you are very
'There is something there!' Castor said again as he pointed at the spot. He then bowed his arm, and as his hand was about to throw the object into Draco's direction again, he suddenly grabbed for his stomach and fell to his knees. An expression of pain appeared on his face as he let out a high-pitched cry.
Noticing that Draco was starting to get confused because Harry had stopped, Harry quickly kissed him again, and felt a cold hand take ahold of his shoulder, pushing Harry onto his back. The roles had changed, and there was no way in looking around those raven eyes as they stared at Harry from above — almost the same color as the night sky.
Even more curious to know where Potter was able to find a book that actually would be quite helpful; he quickly reads the letter.
Their flight seemed to last for hours, and soon enough Draco felt frozen to the bone. Harry's body was shivering as well, his breathing rapid. He couldn't see Hermione and Ron from where he sat, but he knew those two were probably freezing just as much.
Draco gave him a glare before lifting a single finger, and sending his father flying through the room — hitting a wall and falling down in a heap of misery. '
A few moments later Potter’s wand is directed at his chest, green eyes serious and eyebrows frowned. Heavy book dangling in his other hand, eyes flicking from the page back to Draco. Why did Draco agree to this again?
Draco noticed he still had his hand upon Harry's shoulder and slowly lowered it, only to get taken into Harry's. ‘Want to dance?’ the boy asked as he stared at Draco's pale hand and too long fingers.
“I’d say guarding you is about all that there is to it. Of course I have my powers, I can fly, I can communicate with my brothers and other immortals from the beyond — but I don’t think there’s anything more to it, no.” Draco shook his head, lifting his shoulders slightly again as if Harry'd just asked about the weather and he'd answered with 'sunny as always', or something alike. It didn't quite add up in Harry's mind, but he tried his best to understand.
The small smile Harry saw around Malfoy's lips before now appears again, staying there for a few moments longer than previous time. It's an appealing sight, actually; Malfoy smiling. He almost looks healthy and… not like a pointy git.
But the mention of the Dark Lord's name seemed to anger her even more. 'You and your silly talking,' she started. 'You must stop immediately with spreading rumors of his return! Now that I know you're here as well I will tell the Minister and he-'
'When Draco gave you his wand, wanted to come here and therefore fought against the people on his side — I believe it was all the locket's idea. I believe it was its plan all along to be together with you
The carriage was nothing like it had been the year before; was now just a large room that looked like that of a train station's waiting hall. Rows of benches were placed against each other, storage for luggage under and above, and students dressed in casual wear seated upon them. The windows were enlarged, showing off the beautiful winter landscapes of the French pyrenees. How much Draco was looking forward to seeing Harry again, to wrap his arms around the boy and tell him everything would be alright — his favorite thing to say, as it was something the boy
Fleur nodded. 'He already drew its design when he was in his third year — I never knew why but I'm glad he did.
It makes Harry let out a short laugh; just present enough to make Malfoy frown. Apparently the blond isn't used to making people smile. But it's true what he said; Harry never really liked studying. Maybe if there wasn't a man-slaughtering Wizard he had to defeat throughout his childhood, he would've had more time for studying. Or at least; for trying to study
Harry seemed utterly shocked by his words and it was also readable on his face. ‘But- isn’t Madame Maxime worried that-‘
to a person!' His voice raised slightly, and Draco could see he was panicking by remembering how idiotic he had been. Harry's eyes left Draco's to glance at the scars on the blond's chest — but the emeralds seemed too afraid to take them in. To look at them longer than a few seconds. Then Draco remembered it was probably the first time Harry saw Draco's scars as well. They had been separated on the Astronomy Tower, and hadn't seen each other since.
Still focused on his shaking hand, at least two minutes pass in silence. Malfoy seems to be thinking — doubting wether it was a good thing to invite Harry over or not. Harry can simply
