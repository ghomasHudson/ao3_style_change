Tim withered against the table.
“Nice to see you again Potter.” Pansy greeted.
And all the while, Harry keeps fucking him.
Harry lifted his thumb to brush Malfoy’s cheek.
“What do you want?”
“You can say that again.”
Malfoy pulled his tongue away and head back, choosing to watch his fingers plunge in and out, Harry’s tight hole hardly stretching enough to fit them all.
“And you couldn’t just pass him over to the ministry?”
“Are you sure it’s safe?”
“Oh Merlin!”
At times like this, when she seemed worried, Ginny reminded him a lot of Molly. Her eyes swam with care and her bright hair complemented them perfectly, the warmth of it all almost shook the cold out of Harry’s heart.
It wouldn’t have worked on people.  Draco assumed.  Really, his father was not a fruitful topic for conversation.
Æthelflæd rubbed a painkiller salve into the skin inside the Mooncalf’s ears, saying it would spread through the bloodstream and work better than trying to get the frightened beast to swallow a potion. She splinted the leg and stabilized it.
Rutherford offered them some fresh caught mice to express her gratitude, but they said they preferred deep-fried tofu.  There was no accounting for taste, so she thanked them again and flew off to Osaka with the message clutched firmly in her talons.
Harry continued, unable to keep from laughing a little.
“Sun Wu Kong is a Chinese cultural hero, I tell you.  And we are his spiritual kin.”
“Er, no, it was just last night,” Harry said. “I was camping wild on a walking tour. I startled it and it broke its leg running away.”
Æthelflæd nodded. “Very well. Mr Potter, come with me to show me where it is, so that I can stabilize the leg to move it safely. It will need time to recuperate while the bone heals, so we’ll need to bring it here. Draco, stay here and find a secluded place to make a shallow burrow for it to rest in. Ms Lovegood?”
Draco needed to salvage this situation somehow.  He still didn’t know why Potter wanted to meet him in the first place.  He wasn’t eager to find out, to tell the truth.  No point antagonising Potter any further than could be helped.
Draco flinched, then sighed.
An apology from Potter?  Would wonders never cease.  On the other hand, Draco was delinquent on quite a few apologies himself.  Perhaps it behooved him to be polite.  “Yes, well.  Thanks for helping,” he said.
Draco was silent a while, considering.  Finally he said “All right.  If you can get them to agree, we’ll try it.  You have to help with the cooking, though.”
No, Harry wasn’t afraid.  He said goodbye to the South Wind and slept the night, so they could have a fresh start in the morning.
Embarrassed, he looked at Draco, who was trying not to laugh.
!  Cousin Draco gave it to me for my birthday.  I can read a little of it!”
“It’s ….”  The bear sighed.  “It’s another thing I can’t tell you about.  Yet.”
that relationship to work, he protested fiercely to himself.
Gabriel regarded him with wide, earnest eyes, the picture of innocence.   Harry squinted to read the scrawled signature, and then snorted.
Harry remembered his reunion with his own wand. The feeling of warmth, of relief, of rightness restored.  “Sorry for the delay,” he said.
“That’s not today, dear,” Narcissa said gently.
Despite what young Ronald Weasley thought, my life’s not boring.  Just staying here in the Headmaster’s office I witness interesting things.  At feasts, I’ve listened to the thoughts of thousands of 11 year-olds – repetitive, but helps me gauge the temper of the times.  And I never know when I’ll be called upon to deliver the sword of Gryffindor – swooping off in the beak of a phoenix to the Chamber of Secrets, or summoned and crammed on the head of brave young Neville Longbottom and set on fire.  Both times so the sword could lop the head off some serpent that Tom Riddle was using to make trouble.  I remember sorting him – a most unpleasant mind, I got out as soon as I could.  He said rude things about me too.
“Do you want to feed Hester here?  Her teeth aren’t so good anymore, so I bring her mince.”
That was intriguing, at least.  “Thank you,” Draco said, turning to go.
“Mine is not to reason why, mine is but to heal and let it cry,” Draco said. “But I wouldn’t object if it found somewhere else to do its moaning.”
“What do you care?” said Harry.  “I’ll bet you never spin.”
“It is?”
“Fine.  Where should we start?”
“I don’t want to,” Draco said.  “But he’s threatening my family.”
“There are taverns for house-elves?”
Padma laughed. “Draco tried for a while to go under the name Wystan Wyvern, but everyone figured it out. And then he got a bit obsessed. That car’s a – what is it again Hermione?”
“Quite well, I think,” Draco answered.  “Not many people came, but sometimes people are more willing to open up in a smaller group.  There were some good questions.” Draco had begun offering workshops on coping with disability for other survivors of curses.
He swallowed.  “Look, I wouldn’t expect – but everything’s hell out there – maybe we could just - let ourselves have this?  This once?”
Draco had no idea what to say.
“No, I’m the groundskeeper while Hagrid is away.  Not that it’s any of your business, Malfoy.”
“Neither, although I’d love to learn to drive.  My grandfather died young, and my father never learned.  Your team is magnificent.”
Harry scowled, and finally snorted again.  “You think
“Precisely what I was saying.  The snow is snittering snartly and the werbeling winds are wapping.  Therefore I need tea, at once.  Darjeeling.”
Padma snorted.  “His loss.  I’m all for reading originals, but with all the languages there are in the world….  What kind of topic are you looking for, Harry?”
“You begin well, Draco Malfoy.”
He woke up when the bed shook as if someone had bumped into it.
Draco began humming Celestina Warbeck’s recent hit, “It Was That Spell You Cast on Me” and Harry swatted him.  “Actually, I pretended that I lost a game of Truth or Dare.”
“He made an appointment for the next cold day in hell.  I can fit him in sooner if he wants to reschedule….  But really, Harry, what can I do?  I’m not going to grovel.”
He could hardly wait.
“Yeah, it has,” Harry smiled at her. “You two should come for dinner.  I’ll fire-call you and we’ll figure out a date.”
When Professor Snape visited him later in the afternoon Draco confronted him.  “Where is my wand?  And why was Potter allowed in here?  He could have tried to kill me again.”
And meanwhile he was trapped in some stupid set of rooms with Harry fucking Potter.
Draco rolled his eyes.
“Shut up and kiss me.”
“You’ve never fancied anyone?”
“Well, I’d had those before.”
Malfoy?”
, and what other spell begins with that?”
The bear peered at Harry’s swollen, blistered feet, and gave them a few unexpectedly gentle licks.  A queer warmth spread through Harry at the touch of that tongue.   He buried a hand in the bear’s thick soft coat and shut his eyes until the bear nudged him.  Harry clambered onto its broad back, wrapping his legs around its solid warmth.
“Together,” Padma said, slipping an arm around Hermione and kissing her temple lightly. Hermione blushed slightly and nodded.
“No, she couldn’t have ever met any actual goblins; that poem is very sensual. The goblins go about tempting people to suck on luscious juicy fruits.”
“Ah, an old friend from school!  Talking over your happy memories?  What was our Mr Potter like back then?”
The chocolate frog began jumping from his lap to Draco’s and back again.  “Why is the frog doing that?”
Harry pointed again.  “See that little smudge of light?”  He turned his face slightly, inhaling that scent he had smelled on Draco’s pillow.  He caught his breath and couldn’t help leaning back slightly against the chest behind him.
“Is that fungus growing on his chest?”
Harry laughed as a thought struck him.
Potter had appeared, all foolhardy with no head protection, his wand aimed.  Draco interrupted Potter’s stunning spell and hauled him under the umbrella.  “Don’t jinx him – Greg is….”  Well, harmless was not the word.  “Well-intentioned.  Toward me, at any rate.”
“Verse has meter, a certain rhythm,” he explained. “For example, you could say
“Cool! It’s my first Chinese dragon in my collection.”
The bear shrugged.  “It won’t make them happy anyway.”
Draco climbed the stairs toward the Owlery one Wednesday evening. He might not manage to argue with Father to his face, but he could send a letter.
“It was an ignorant boy who did that to you,” Harry whispered.  “Who regretted it as soon as he’d done it.”  He laid his fingertips gently against Draco’s skin.
Draco had to laugh too.  “Thank you, Kreacher.  It was a fine adventure.  And it worked out very well.”
“Lovely to see you too.  Won’t you come in?  Can I get you some tea?”
how you treat them.”
“It’s a Chinese dragon. It has whiskers, see? They don’t need wings to fly. They can swim, too.”
Lines from a poem in
“That’s the term.  Parliament of owls, gaggle of geese, unkindness of ravens, party of peacocks.”
“Better get to bed then.”  Draco loosened his arms, but took one of Harry’s hands and led him inside.  They stopped inside the door, hesitating.
Potter swore without any real heat and asked about the make of the broom, which Draco had bought on the Continent when visiting his mother in France.  Draco may have shown off a little with a few more stunts on the way to the pub.
“Am I interrupting something?” Harry heard himself ask, his voice low and husky.  His mind had gone on a detour, wondering how much snogging it would take to bring color into Malfoy’s pale face.
Harry scowled. “Look, Malfoy, just give me my glasses and let me get out of here.”
“What was good about their school?  What wasn’t good?  Do you think it was a good school, overall?”   It wasn’t good, some students said, because it wasn’t safe.  It was too close to the war, classes were interrupted, children got hurt.  It was a good school, others argued.  The teachers and soldiers and doctors cared about the students. They taught them. They tried to feed and help and protect them.
Still a bit dazed, Draco followed him to a place private enough for Apparition.  “Side-along me?  I’m kind of distracted,” he said.  Harry tucked him tenderly against his side and soon they were walking through the Hogwarts gates.
After a slightly bumpy Portkey trip they arrived, in the steamy capital of the northern Oro province of Papua New Guinea.  They set off on their brooms for the nearest stretch of rainforest.  The snake, now much more cheerful, asked to be let off at the top of a tree, so they dipped down enough to let it slither into some branches.  In moments its brilliant green coloring had blended into the leaves and it was lost from view.
“Go even earlier.  Hagrid is the one who welcomed me into the Wizarding world. You called him a savage, when we were getting fitted in Madam Malkin’s.”
“Must be the room.  It does things.  Are you – how are you, Malfoy?”
The next day dawned fine for flying, so they brought brooms, took a Floo partway and then flew.
“What are you up to this afternoon?” he asked Harry.
so that their conversation would not be overheard, and addressed them all. “My office might be a better place for this discussion, but I’d rather not postpone it longer.  I think it’s important to have a better understanding of what happened the day that Draco was injured in the bathroom.  Draco, would you care to tell us about it?”
“Where is Wessex anyway?” Padma said, sticking her head out of the kitchen.
“So eat a lot of them,” the bear grunted, efficiently stripping a mouthful from a bush.
and wondered if he’d ever get to see that look on Potter’s face again.
Eventually the heat and humidity began to sap Draco’s energy.  He couldn’t seem to think clearly.  “You look to be wilting,” Harry said, and sent a delicious blast of cooling charm Draco’s way.
Over lunch Harry explained that it would be the full moon again soon, and he’d been wondering if the Mooncalf was ready to return to its herd for their dance. However, Æthelflæd didn’t feel the leg had healed enough yet.
Draco smiled as she disappeared into the forest.
His father’s voice was cold and brittle as an icicle snapping.  “I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam.”
The bear flicked its stump of a tail.  Gold coins appeared from nowhere and clattered to the floor in heaps.
But when Æthelflæd came, she had no solutions.
Draco must have looked blank.
Potter was silent for a moment before answering, “Yeah. It would be.”
“Hi,” Harry said.
Draco looked surprised and pleased.  Harry supposed Draco’s parentage seldom won him favour any more.
“Our apple trees?” said Harry, deciding to push it.
He flew and flew on the invisible horse, until they were slowed by a strong wind blowing toward them.
The smile fell from Draco’s face.
Draco emerged from the forest in a mood of unfamiliar lightness and excitement.  He wanted to share it with someone, and Potter, working in the pea-patch, was the only one around. “I did it, Potter!”  Draco called as he approached.  “I met a hippogriff and it was fine!”
“A, Potter, is for Ask and ye shall receive.”
Whatever Draco might have tried to say would not come out. Suddenly tired, he decided to go home.  He nodded slightly, turned, and left.
“I want Hogwarts castle!”
The owl turned and flew toward them.  Draco caught a glimpse of the heart-shaped white face – a barn owl.  This time Fern took a flying leap as the owl passed by.  Draco ran to pick her up as she landed.  For the first time, she struggled in his arms as he carried her inside.  Outside, he heard the screech of the owl.
“Transport is going to be a problem,” Æthelflæd said. “I don’t think it’s safe to Apparate with it, there’s no telling where the nearest extra-wide Floo is, and a broom stretcher isn’t practical over long distances. If only flying carpets were still legal here. Mr Potter, if you can find the nearest road, I can give the poor beast a sleeping spell and levitate it after you.”
“She was a poet. Possibly the author of the plays and sonnets attributed to Shakespeare.”
“No, we were fishing in some cold sea. You dumped a load of fish on my feet.”
“Not everything. I kept the really good things, like my memories of you, and your parents. I kept them safe. But maybe I didn’t look at them enough.” Harry squatted down to Teddy’s height. “Maybe we could make some new good memories together?”
“Oh – well, the Slytherin rooms were under the lake, you know, and some of them had windows. I suppose that’s how I got interested.”  Malfoy was becoming more animated. “The fish here are gorgeous.  Indigo, electric blue, gold, purple, red, all sorts of stripes and speckles and blends of color.”  His hands darted through the air like the fish amid the rocks.  “There’s one called Dragon Blood Peacock, how could I resist?”
“Am bound by them.”  The bear turned away sharply, his head down.
“Naps are good.  Right now, actually, I was just going to ask if you wanted to listen to something.”
“Certainly,” Draco said, trying to squelch his sense of foreboding.  “Owl me with a convenient time, and I’ll send you my current address.”
“Car.  Blue.”  It had come charging up and when a door sprang open he scrambled inside, devoutly grateful.  It rumbled through the forest and spat him out nearly at the edge.
“A broad glade, through which a wood-cock might dart,” Draco explained.  “And be caught in a net.”
“Yes, because you stopped dead in the middle of the street, Potter. So I’m here, because I can’t go forward, because you’re there. Blocking my way.”
“He isn’t eating,” he said. “I cooked his food until it was soft and cut it up into little pieces but he won’t eat.” He passed his hand in front of the dog’s face, but the dog didn’t react. “I put his eye drops in but he doesn’t seem to see at all.”
After that conversation, their old animosity seemed largely defused. They had a tacit agreement to share the Owlery, and when they found themselves there together, they would often talk a little, gradually becoming more relaxed with each other. One evening in early spring they leaned side by side at a window, watching owls go forth and stars come out. Harry couldn’t help asking Draco again about the arranged marriage.
“Oh, are you studying hippomancy?  How interesting.  I’ve always suspected we could learn a lot about the future from horses.”
Kreacher looked smug.

“You can stop me, right?  You know you can stop me.”
Draco’s face became rapt.  His chest rose on a long in-drawn breath and his head fell back.  He came with a series of small cries, and a look of peace drifted across his sharp features as he melted back onto the bed.  When he turned to Harry, his smile was so warm and open that Harry felt his heart expand.
Draco clamped his legs around Harry’s waist. “You stay here. That’s what wands are for.” He extricated his, and with a deft combination of Summoning and Cushioning Charms managed to get the tuba back without it smacking into them. Then he brought the billiard stick sailing over.
Harry grinned.  “You wish.”
He laughed.  “Anything’s possible.”
8888888
“Are you suggesting I ride one?”
It wasn’t completely dark outside; the moon was full, somewhere behind the snow clouds. The night was peaceful, with the snow drifting gently down, muffling the sounds of their steps. But Potter was bending down to scoop some up into a ball. “Good packing snow,” he said, turning with a mischievous smile.
Memory swirls again and Lily is walking through the Forbidden Forest with Harry.  James and Sirius and Remus are with them, they are all there to keep his courage up as he goes to meet his death, death that they have met already. Harry is so brave, and she tells him so, and they gaze at each other.  “Stay close to me,” he tells her, and she does.
After a moment Draco spoke gently.  “Maybe she had owlets before you met her, Harry.  Maybe one of her great-grandchildren is out there just waiting for a good home with you.”
Charlie exhaled. “It’s hard to say – it depends on the breed, their history in the area. You can do research, but a lot is intuition. I wish I could help, but I have to get back to Romania. Do you know anyone with an affinity for wyverns?”
“Mind if I sit down?”
would someone put snakes in Harry’s taps?”
“Why can’t your father wait until you choose your own wife?”
him in the sunlight, just moments earlier, and now here they were in the dark, and that memory was his alone.
He hadn’t been, actually – Harry really never danced and it hadn’t occurred to him that the music mattered much.  He tuned in and heard the singer crooning
“One last carol for the Humdinger.” Draco rang the bell and with their arms wrapped around each other, they hummed “Joy to the World.”
Time to let Harry have his privacy with his beloved.  Lily can go now.  All’s well here.
“There’s the music of the spheres.”
“Well, maybe if you stayed put somewhere, you could make a fresh start – do something you could be proud of.”
“You’ll get your biscuits later.”
“Merfley is happy you are here, Harry Potter! Mr Draco will be feeling better then.”
glasses!”
“So I should thank you.”
“What?” Draco said. “Why me?”
“Thanks.” Harry had no idea what to say to Malfoy. His eyes landed on Malfoy’s fountain pen. It was cigar-shaped, a striking marbled green and black with a gold nib. “Nice pen.”
It  could.  Later, it did. (Draco Harry Potter Malfoy, Harry Draco Malfoy Potter.)  But nobody was looking.
“You can meet my cat.”
“Greg!  What are you –“
“That’s right.  Thank you.”  She was polite but cool.  Draco was curious, though, and Ravenclaws could usually be tempted into conversation about whatever they were reading.
“What’s a hippalectryon?” Harry asked, but Luna was gone and Draco had no idea.  “What kind of hippomancer are you?” Harry teased, so Draco suggested they go look it up.
“Make me,” Harry said, still giddy.  Then a very unbearlike nose was bumping his, and some warm, soft, very human lips were pressed against his own, and soon Harry stopped laughing because kissing was even better.
“You should find out, don’t you think, before you go through with a marriage.”
“Got under it.”  The voice came from the Deluminator Harry’d borrowed and forgotten.
were born in 1980.  This guidebook to China talks about the Chinese zodiac, and that’s the Year of the Monkey.  It’s not a bad thing. People born in a Monkey year are known to be highly intelligent.”
“What’s enker?  Some kind of ink?”
The first time, Draco found it clear. “We” meant families who’d followed the Dark Lord, uniting to glory in his returning strength.
Draco rolled over with a lazy sunny smile that startled an open smile out of Potter in return.  As Potter stroked his feet, shins and thighs, Draco found himself looking fondly at the mess of black hair on his head.  But then Potter moved to his torso, where Draco could feel again, oh how he could feel – around his navel, across his nipples, Merlin did Potter have no idea what he was doing to him?  Potter noticed something – maybe Draco’s quickened breathing – because he asked again, “All right there?”
It was almost summer, and though the stone wall of the Owlery was cool against Harry’s back, the air was warm, and so was Draco’s skin against his own. Their leisurely kiss was heating up nicely and all was well in Harry’s world, until he heard a gasp and looked up to see Lavender Brown in the entrance. She stared at them in horror, dropped the letter she’d been carrying, and ran back down the steps.
An hour later, the Puffskein was clean, dry, fluffy and sweet-smelling. Merfley had trimmed off the scorched bits and sculpted the shorter fur into a floral design. The Puffskein hummed in contentment, Merfley beamed, and Draco decided that washing his own rather neglected hair would be a good idea.
Just then Fern sprang up to Malfoy’s shoulder.  She purred.  Malfoy closed his eyes and smiled faintly.  “Thank you, Fern,” he murmured.  “I’m glad you approve.”
“Lovely language they speak here,” Draco mused.  “Still, when it comes to seduction, Potter, you could use some lessons.”
“Draco!  You’re here!”  Awe lit Harry’s features.  “But I have to go back. It has to be me, I have to try to finish this.”
It occurred to Harry that he had no idea how Malfoy had got hold of his glasses in the first place.  As an Auror, he should check up on that sort of thing.  So it was only logical that he turned his footsteps toward Malfoy’s flat.
Draco thanked her, relieved.
“Yeah, he took a chunk out of Snape’s leg.  Come to think of it, that year was also my first time in the Forest, and the first time I met a centaur.  Again because of you and your snitching, Malfoy.  Considering how you behaved on that occasion, I’m surprised you ever wanted to return.”
“Of course it’s me.  What are
“Here he is. Ignatius, you remember Harry Potter, of course you do.  Harry, this is …”
Years in the chosen solitude of the Zhongnan Mountains of China had left Harry unprepared for the bustle of the International Portkey Terminal. But at least he would be able to relax at Ron and Hermione’s, in the accepting warmth of their friendship. “Our Floo is always open for you, Harry, you know that,” Hermione had always said, and though he hadn’t been in touch for a long time, he trusted her promise.
“Want to hear it?”
“You said your name is Merfley?”
Harry was looking shy, he still turned uncertain sometimes for no reason that Draco could understand.  Draco felt a tender protectiveness.
“But that’s at Banbury Cross,” Harry said.
“There’s something in your hair,” Draco murmured.  His fingers moved lightly across Harry’s head, then briefly grazed his cheek.
“All right, now we move on to the feet and calves,” Baines said. “These muscles aren’t being used, so it’s particularly important to maintain the circulation here.  We have to use a much lighter touch to avoid damage, because the patient can’t tell us if we’re being too rough.”
“I’ll do it,” Draco said, rough voiced.  “You strip.  I need to feel your skin on mine.”  He coated his fingers with oil and breached himself until he was moving against his own fingers, gazing at Harry with eyes heavy with desire.
Harry woke in the middle of the night and poked his head outside. The full moon had come up and the world was awash in silvery light. Something called to him.
Draco continued smoothly, though Harry suspected it cost him a great deal more effort than he showed.  “I owe both of you apologies and reparations, for past vile behavior both personal and political. I repeat my offer to be of assistance in any way possible.  You may consider it at your leisure.  Meanwhile, Ms Granger, perhaps you also would like a serenade?”
Travel truly was educational.  She wanted to tell someone about it.  Someone back home.
“May I?  Can’t kiss you properly with these on.” Draco’s voice was low and warm.
The next day, the bear came by to see if he was ready to go back to their castle yet.  “Yes!” said Harry, and back they went.
“Look, something else fell out of the wrappings.” Draco bent and picked a sprig of leaves and berries off the snow.  It was mistletoe. He held it over Harry’s head. “My chance to kiss my boyfriend on another continent.”
Oh no – that sounded like a leave-taking!  Rutherford swooped down toward him with all speed and saw his startled look just before, once more, he disappeared.
“Hmm.”  Harry couldn’t see anything, so he thought he’d better check.  He stretched a hand over to feel for fur.
“Professor Snape taught it to me.” Draco’s mouth twisted. “He thought I might need to know.”
“Did we invite him?”  The girl looked puzzled.
Harry wrapped around his lover, warm and alive.
“Why should I?”
“What? No. I don’t want you dead too. That would be terrible publicity.”
“I don’t have anything,” Harry repeated.  Perhaps zipping his wand inside his pack had not been the wisest move.
“I should have asked.  I don’t understand why none of my spells worked on the birds, though.”
“I’ll give you this pair of mittens when they’re finished, then, since you don’t have the others,” Mrs Weasley said, breaking in on Harry’s thoughts. “Should I knit in the same charm that I put on the Russian ones?”
“You can’t see it if you won’t look.  Hermione – I know it’s a lot to ask…”
Potter just smiled lazily at him, sunk back in the sofa cushions, his legs sprawled out so one nudged against Draco’s. A little spot of warmth from Potter’s leg. A little current of warmth from Potter’s eyes.  A little warmth rising in Draco’s cheeks.
And then Harry was standing on Diagon Alley, alone in a jostling crowd of strangers.  Aroused, confused, bereft.
Teddy’s hair was shifting through a succession of colours. It settled on a vibrant pink that reminded Harry of Tonks at her most cheerful. He grinned at Teddy and Teddy grinned back.
“Mmm,” Malfoy said.  They watched as Fern loped back to the meadow and Gabriel followed in the air.
He did really want.  He did.  He pulled Draco onto the dance floor.
When Malfoy opened the door and saw Harry, something flickered briefly in his eyes, but his face was impassive.  He stood aside and waved Harry inside, but Harry stood in the doorway and spoke stumblingly.  “I, er, don’t believe I thanked you for returning my glasses.”
,,,^..^,,,~
“You call this getting out?”
“And why should you care who I eat? Go away now, or I’ll make a snack of you.”
“Was it ever all over with?”  Malfoy sighed.  “I was rather hoping never to have to ask you for anything again.”
Harry sat.  “Tell my parents not to trust Peter Pettigrew. Expose Tom Riddle and clear Hagrid’s name. Tell my father not to be such an arrogant berk around Snape, when they were at school.”
Harry turned, scanning the skies, but much was unfamiliar.  He gestured to a spot that looked like someone had spilled a little heap of stardust there. “Do you know what that is?”
Potter raised his head again.  “But you know I only did it because you cast the
Merfley and Herman seemed to understand each other fairly well, and Draco gathered that the final battle at Hogwarts had left a lot of curse residue in the lake there. As a result, the squidlets’ growth was delayed and they had lost some of their ability to change color, crucial for camouflage. They needed a safer place to recover.
“Come, Fern.  Here, sit on my lap.  No?  Do you want some milk?  Play with some string?”
Merfley’s face fell.
“You didn’t hear?  Well, my father – didn’t do well going back to Azkaban, you know, he was - broken.  My mother was trying to appeal his sentence, but I knew that wouldn’t work, and I was angry with him for - turning our whole lives over to the Dark – madman. And, and then my father got sick in prison and – died, and I hadn’t….  Well, and then we didn’t do much of anything because we didn’t know what to do, and then my mother was sick and I tried to take care of her – but she – now she’s gone too.  And then I didn’t know what to do because it didn’t seem to matter.  And then they took the house.  So I left.”
“Well, I don’t know what the clock was like originally,” Andromeda said, “but now it only has two settings: ‘In Mortal Peril’ and ‘Not in Mortal Peril.’ Molly kept an eye on it after you left, and sent weekly reports to the newspapers.
“I am sorry – it’s just that Andromeda – ”
Finally they set off uphill toward Harry’s house, with Draco trying to balance the market basket on his head, to the amusement of several teenage girls who did the same with no effort at all.  “How do you do that?”  Harry asked.  “Nothing ever stays up for me.”  Draco smirked and Harry swatted him.  “No rude comments, you know what I mean.”
“It was, of course.  People there thought I was very odd.”  Draco shrugged.  “But at least they didn’t hate me on sight.  And clearly the beliefs I’d been brought up with led to very bad ends, so I thought I’d better try to start fresh.  See what Muggles knew about magic, back in the Middle Ages when they still believed in it.  Read the way they talked about Merlin and King Arthur.  And then I just found I loved the poetry.”
“The Ministry took it over, after – well, they let my mother stay there until….   It was too big for one person anyway.”
8888888
“Well, the job doesn’t exactly seem to play to your strengths.”
“Herman, this is Harry Potter. Potter, this is Herman the giant squid.”
“Yeah,” Harry returned. He felt, in fact, profoundly right, cared for, here with this man. He let his fingers drift down the side of Draco’s face. “Are you?”
“Oh, you
“You might have told me those wyverns you kept talking about were just brand names.”
“Oh no! It seemed quite shy and I didn’t want to scare it. They’re said to be quite solitary when they aren’t raising a family.” Luna frowned. “I’m not sure how it would find a mate—their habitat is shrinking, and another Humdinger might be far away and difficult to locate.”
“I don’t dispute it,” Draco answered levelly.
The long, smooth, polished table cool against his back, and Harry warm and tight around him, above him, rocking slow and then faster and faster, galloping, flying.
“I put the pain salve on,” Draco said. “He can’t get up. Should I give him Pepper-Up?”
“Nngh...”
You learned how to greet and thank people in Chichewa?”
When he woke the second time, he was alone and had energy to get up and wash.  Then he swapped the cleaner sheets onto Draco’s bed.  It was the best he could do.  When he went outside he saw Draco sitting under a tree some ways off, not reading but staring at the water.  Harry wandered over. “Sorry I used your bed,” he said, unable to look Malfoy in the face.  “The other net was torn and I was too tired to do anything about it.”  He waited for iciness, derision, scorn.
“No, the curse is not continuing to act upon the patient.  It will not cause further damage, and his life is not threatened.  But the major nerve damage that has already taken place is, at this point, irreparable.”
“I have never had the opportunity.”
The other Mooncalves, noticing, came running, making crooning noises. They stopped abruptly when they saw Harry and Draco.
Soon the silvery hare of Luna’s Patronus came lolloping up. “Oh, the poor Mooncalf! Luckily there is a magical beast hospital and sanctuary that just opened up. Here are the Apparition coordinates—you can go there first and they can come and help you to transfer the patient. Moving anyone with broken bones is tricky.”
“No, thanks.  I thought we could just take them outside and let them run around, and see what happens.”
Harry came running.  “I heard you casting, what happened?”
“Turns your head into a vegetable.  Of the cabbage family, usually.  In your case, perhaps a Brussels sprout.”
Draco stared at him. “Of course. Squid live in the sea. So do merpeople, that’s what their name means. I forgot that the Great Lake at Hogwarts was salt water.”
Harry was spared having to comment by the arrival of a barn owl at the open window – the one that had brought Malfoy’s original message to his house. It surveyed him with disfavour.
“Is that a crime?”
“You kept it!” Draco exclaimed in delight as he examined it.  “I’m touched.  Didn’t know you were so sentimental.”
“Well, and then there were all kinds of crazy things second year, when Dobby was trying to protect me by keeping me away from Hogwarts.  He managed to seal Platform 9 ¾ against me, can you believe it?  There’s really no telling what house-elves can do….”  Harry frowned.  “Kreacher!”
“I should thank you for that too,” Harry said.
“I want to,” Rutherford said, “but it’s a very long way.  I’m afraid my wizard there is wondering what happened to me.”
“It seemed clear that I had to rethink everything.  Father had made it sound like there would be a glorious reign of the Dark Lord, protecting the wizarding traditions, but what I saw up close – it was hellish.  And if he was wrong about that – what about all the other things I’d accepted?  I started to think that the things we’d insisted on the hardest were the ones that had no support but prejudice, the ideas that wouldn’t stand up to close examination.  Pure-bloods were supposed to be superior, but Granger was clearly the best student in the school, regardless of how clueless her parents must have been about anything magical.  You wouldn’t know a pure-blood tradition if it bit you, but your raw magic was ridiculously powerful.  Never mind what you could do on a broom.  I was supposed to be the best because I was a Malfoy, but best at what?  At annoying you, maybe, but I couldn’t even be truly effective at that.  Sic a snake on you, and you start a conversation with it.  Do you have any idea what a frustrating person you are, Potter?
“Are sexy as hell,” Harry said.  “But you do smell delicious.  Like treacle tart.  Mmmm.” He nuzzled Draco’s neck.
This was nice countryside, when it wasn’t full of dark wizards.
Harry found himself reaching forward.  He had the strangest impulse to skim over the scar with his fingertips, trace the line….
“Oh, he brings Lavender’s potion every month.”
Then they headed to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, where the Meteorites had a match against the Haileybury Hammers scheduled in two days’ time.  While they waited, Harry and Draco flew out to Buffalo Pound Provincial Park, where they saw big shaggy bison and admired the pelicans with their long pouched beaks.  At least, Harry and Draco admired the pelicans.  The garter snake hid.
“Gird my loins?”  Harry snorted.  “I don’t even know what that means, and I bet you don’t either.”
“Are you sure that it’s a good idea to wake one up, even if we can do it?” Draco said.
However, experience with Ginny had taught him that questions about attending family gatherings were rarely simple. He studied what he could see of Draco’s averted face.
Malfoy lay back and Harry did too, looking straight up at blue sky. He flung an arm up to block the sun, but kept the other hand touching Malfoy’s, little fingers just grazing.
“When did you meet Harry Potter, Miranda?”  It was hard to imagine; Potter was known to be reclusive.
Potter kissed back until Draco was in danger of going all sweet and soft, like a Chocolate Frog left in the sun.
Potter turned to go, but somehow Draco’s hand shot out and caught his.  Potter looked at his hand.  He didn’t say anything, but handed Draco his glasses and got into the bed on the other side.  He turned his face to the wall and soon Draco could hear that he was asleep.  Draco fell asleep.  Potter was gone when he awoke.
Something landed on Draco’s back, silent but solid.  Fern climbed up to his shoulder and rubbed her chin against him.
“Alive,” his father repeated, as if that were all he had ever hoped for.
It occurred to Draco that both Millicent and Luna might have found animals kinder than people.
A cluster of customers entered and Harry left to attend to them.
you sixth year in that loo, I didn’t mean to but suddenly your blood was all over and I was horrified – and afterwards I just blocked it from my memory. I got involved with Ginny and forgot about that fight – or maybe I got involved with Ginny to help me forget – and I never apologized to you.”
He flung the scrap aside and turned back for more.
Potter just looked at him, eyes huge, face so close and vivid.
“No, your EX girlfriend.”
❄     ❄     ❄
Gabriel was not happy about being inside the carrying cage – he didn’t really have room to move about.  “It’s just for a few minutes,” Harry told him.  “The Floo isn’t as fun as flying, but I don’t know the way there by air, even if you do. Or by Apparition.  This cloth will keep the ashes off.”
“Æthelflæd, this is Luna Lovegood. She has an interest in some of the most, er, uncommon magical beasts. Luna, this is Æthelflæd, our veterinarian.”
“I – I’m sorry.”
No answer came, and eventually he headed back out of the forest, his thoughts buzzing.
“I believe there has been good progress, sir.  My centaur contact will have more information for me in a month.”
“It’s not safe for you, either, is it?  You think I want to sit around while you’re off risking your neck?”
“What?”
“This is ridiculous.  You can stay in my room, we can fix up that net somehow.”
“No, sorry,” said Harry.  “I’m trying to get to the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon.  Do you know the way?”
“I’m just imagining what Snape would have said if someone had tried using one of those in potions class.”
“There was a poet named Wystan,” Padma said. “Wystan Hugh Auden.
“Head in the clouds, eh.”
“If you get too pure you’ll end up like those Jains who won’t even pull up a potato because it kills the plant,” Parvati said, passing by. “No onions or garlic, either. For that matter, no taro. And you’d all have to go home without today’s other pudding too.” She was carrying bowls of something fragrant and creamy.
“Bear?” Harry mumbled.
“Do I know you?”
Just then Draco played a burst of oom-pah silliness, like Harry had always expected tuba music to be. Harry laughed. “That sounds like a kids’ concert.”
When his Aunt Andromeda Floo-called the next Saturday afternoon, Draco was considering whether the weather was cool enough for his favorite blue robe, the one that (he hoped) made his colouring look striking rather than washed-out.  Not that it was important what he wore to dinner, really.  It’s not likely Potter would notice.  Probably.
“Unlike yourself?  Now if you’ll excuse me.”  Draco took back his letter, turned and headed down the path for the forest.
“I can’t be bought,” Harry said.
“Lady, God, Diva.  How much plainer can it be?”
“Exactly.”
“Thank you,” Harry said, climbing off the horse and giving it a farewell pat.  The East Wind picked him up and swirled him away.
Draco’s eyes gleamed. “I can’t put one over on you, can I, Potter? Very well, it’s a car.”
“You can stay.”  Draco put an arm around Harry’s shoulders and ruffled his hair.  “You can just sleep here, you know.  It doesn’t have to be wild sex every night.”
“I thought I’d start small, and just try to do no harm.”
Malfoy set the book down, his eyes fixed on Harry, his face expressionless.  He moved his head an infinitesimal fraction that Harry took to mean yes.
“All right.  Maybe I’ll go look for them after lunch.”  Draco frowned.  He hadn’t thought to bring food and wasn’t in the mood to Apparate all the way home again.  “Do you think the Hogwarts House-Elves would fix me something?”
“Nine or ten inches, maybe.  Oh look, orchids!”
A Chinese magical healer had told him that his magical energy, though strong, was not flowing freely, as if it had been contorted around some other shape that was no longer there. Even though the sliver of Voldemort's soul was gone, an imprint was left. In the calm solitude of the mountains, Harry’s spirit had gradually uncrumpled. Eventually he felt at peace. And then, in time, lonely.
Harry snorted. Draco smiled. Harry swung their hands a little. “And was I there?”
“So, you, you’ve missed some news then. Ron and I – aren’t together anymore. Padma and I are…”
“Look,” Harry whispered to Draco. Draco turned. Hovering at the edge of the field, watching them solemnly, was the Mooncalf.

And felt wind and sunlight on his face. The bells on the sleigh rang sweetly in the frosty morning air. The horses—
She beamed, gap-toothed. “It means ‘Amazing Flying One’.  I’m going to play Quidditch someday.  Do you like Quidditch?”
“Well, Chaucer is famous for good reason.”
The light was changing. The sun would be coming up soon. Harry sent off a Patronus, hoping Luna was an early riser.
One day Harry came in to find Draco sitting at a mass of papers. “Bills.” Draco sighed. “Do you know how much single malt whisky a full-grown Abraxan goes through in a month?”
Draco took a long, uneven breath, then approached Harry slowly as one would a wounded animal, speaking in a low voice.  “I’m sorry.  I didn’t know, I was stupid.”
“Hey!”  Potter clutched him as they spun upside down.
Draco looked at Potter, whose face was softening out of a frown.  “Yeah,” Potter said, “do.”
Draco, shaking, turned his head to give Harry a desperate kiss.  Then Harry was kissing him fiercely, nipping, pressing Draco back against a wall.  Suddenly he couldn’t get close enough.  Draco grabbed his arse and arched into his body, baring his neck to Harry’s mouth and gasping his name.  “You in me or me in you,” Harry rasped, sinking to his knees and nuzzling Draco’s groin, pulling at his clothes.
“And for what, in particular, are you sorry?”  Malfoy bit out.
They leaned forward and kissed again.
Draco clucked to the horses and flicked the reins, and they began to run. The bells on the troika and harnesses sang out a melody to the cadence of the horses’ galloping hooves. Sunlight sparkled on the snowy fields. Joy lightened his heart.
,,,^..^,,,~
Draco reached out and tucked a lock of hair behind Harry’s ear. “Are you really all right?” he asked quietly.
Her discretion and matter-of-fact manner helped somewhat to ease his humiliation. Somewhat.  She left.
She and James had each other, and their laughing child, to live for.  To die for, if necessary.  As it had been.
Harry laughed.  “They’re playing.”
Harry put an arm around him and then Draco Malfoy was sobbing on his shoulder.
Caught by memory, Harry shut his eyes. True, nothing about Draco that night had seemed reluctant. Hesitant only at first, then passionate. Someone like that had probably had many lovers since then. Probably still did. He sighed and opened his eyes.
He heard Draco take an unsteady breath.
“Good heavens,” Malfoy said surveying the feast, “do you cook?”
“Merfley studies the art of the dance,” Draco added.
“Yes, but
“Payment in kind.”   His toe pressed onwards.  Draco was starting to slump back in his chair, but with an effort struggled to his feet and pulled Harry with him into the cabin.
Harry smiled at him.  “How did the workshop go?”
“I have, actually.  The centaurs of India are the Ashwini Kumaras.  I took an interest because they’re divine twins!”  She laughed.
Malfoy sighed and moved back.  “Fern, meet Potter.”
“You’ll have to do better than that.”
An excellent question; if Draco knew of one, he’d move right in.
“Aren’t we all?  Though as I have some responsibility for how he got those scars, it might put a damper on things.”  Malfoy sighed.  “Leaving aside my love life, there should be a little information about your flowers in here.  It’s a rather basic guide.”
Harry shrugged with a half-smile.
.  Honestly, who would be stupid enough to transfigure his own feet?”
“I’d have loved to see that dream.”
“What?” Draco said.
The Floo roared and Draco stepped through.
“Now,” gasped Draco, pulling his fingers out and turning to bend over the table.
“A witch?”
“We’re moving,” Harry said.  He could see the banks go by out the window.  He stuck his head out and looked in front and behind.  As the
After dinner Harry and Hermione sat on the sofa and traded tales they’d heard from Luna about her latest adventures, while Draco and Ron played chess at the table.  Harry looked over now and then, but he couldn’t really follow the game – they were either moving faster than he would have, or sitting for long periods of time studying the board. They weren’t conversing, but they weren’t throwing hexes either, which was promising, he supposed.
Torn by the sadness in his voice, Harry wrapped his arms around him and began to nuzzle his neck.  From there, unthinking, he started to kiss Draco’s throat.  Suddenly Harry wondered if he was being selfish, turning comfort into sex.  “Draco?  Is this all right?”
“Apparently Weasley plays chess.”
Malfoy paused and then looked up with a private little smile. “Why, so it is.”
“Are we kissing?”
“Sorry,” he said when he could talk again, aware that a wide grin was belying his words.
“What if it rains?  It’ll go through the lathes – if he doesn’t tear those off too.  You could have the ceiling come down around your ears.”
“Of course, wine if you prefer…”
He shut his eyes because they were suddenly stinging. Then Draco felt a warm arm around him and an open kiss pressed to his neck. He opened his eyes to see Harry – Potter – Harry smiling at him, as he scrambled off the bed, still blushing, and scooped up his clothes.  So, he was going to bolt for his room.  But first he turned back and gave Draco’s hand a squeeze.  It was the wet sticky hand, and Harry looked startled at his own come now on his hand, then laughed a bit incredulously and wiped it on his thigh.
Draco snorted. “Well, maybe we can bring Teddy a moose call instead.”
His initial concern evaporated.  “Don’t mind him, Gabriel,” he said.  “Malfoy’s always been a whiner.”
His class bent over their shared books in groups of two or three.  They took turns reading aloud, and together sorted out who the characters were and what happened.
Well, Harry thought, it’s true that he was the one who got Draco’s shirt dirty.  And he had lots of experience doing laundry for the Dursleys, though candle wax was hard to get out.
Hermione giggled, Padma kissed her cheek, and Harry smiled to see them so happy.
“Is it working?” Harry said hopefully.
“It scans and rhymes.  Not bad, Potter.”
“The war was traumatic for all involved,” Malfoy began. “But surely Pot— … Mr Potter, as the prime target of the Dark Lord’s wrath, and the chief hope of those who opposed him, would have felt the stress greatly. He may have felt a need to seek the quiet of the countryside in order to recuperate. Was your walking tour restorative, Potter?”
“Good-bye.  It was an honor to meet you.”  Draco bowed.
The squid flounced its arms and zipped around the cauldron in agitation.
“… Ignatius.  And you seem to have offended him already.”  Malfoy sighed.  “I’m afraid it’s rather easy to do.  Did you give him inferior owl treats or something?  Never mind, we’ll bribe him with gingernuts.”
Draco rewarded him with a small but grateful smile and a quick kiss, pulling him in close and Apparating them both to the front door of Malfoy Manor.  The door Harry had been kicked through as a prisoner of Fenrir Greyback.
Malfoy considered.  “Tell my teenaged father that Voldemort was a jumped-up half-blood loser who would drag his followers down with him?”
“I told you my name is Draco.”
them here.”
“Then tell me,” Harry said.
“You are not going to tell me that you know Dudley Dursley.”
“I said I would.”  Draco looked puzzled and a little apprehensive, rising slowly to his feet as the cat, sensing trouble, jumped away.   “I can go, if you’d rather….”
“Oh – did we say we’d go flying?”  Draco had been working on an updated version of the Broom-Cat.  The double-handled broom he’d invented, with a seat suspended in-between, was easily controlled with the arms alone.  Now he was trying to improve the speed and responsiveness, without sacrificing stability.  He’d wanted to try out his new prototype.
“Yeah, I want to see your pieces go down.”
Draco laughed. “I’m sorry I missed that.”
Harry and Draco both gaped.  Harry thought the monk shot them a knowing smile.
“Alluring, yet elusive?”
“Don’t hold back on my account,” Harry said sourly.
Harry grinned like a loon.  “You think I’m yeast in cloud loaves?  Why did they throw me out of sky’s pantry?”
Bear Draco looked alarmed.  “What?  You can’t be serious!  You want to live with those horrible people again?  And leave m- … And leave?”
They buried Old Timer in a sunny spot.
“ – he must have gone out.”
“Ah, come on, Hermione,” Weasley wheezed. “Don’t… be a… Fluffengrumple!”
“You were laughing at me,” Harry said, handing over his own broom.
Hermione was looking at him steadily.  “You know I don’t like him and you know why.  But he hasn’t made any trouble since the war, I’ll say that for him, and his reparations service seems above board, from what I hear.  If it’s important to you, Harry…”
“We don’t know precisely what happened, but he has been this way since he returned from Azkaban.  Some days he has more of a conversational range than others.  We have tried various healers and remedies, but little has changed.  It is hard on my son.” She walked on.
make it?”  Like a logjam breaking, he thought, watching the light pour again out of his lover’s eyes, dazzling and warm.
,” Malfoy snapped.
“Do I know you?”
“But I – but that can’t be.  Snape stopped the bleeding, he healed the wounds….”
Harry was less impressed. “How do you know she’s not going to try to lure you to your doom?”
“I’d say we have to find out!  It’s practically on the way home, anyway.”
“Not just me,” Potter said. “Dumbledore said Ron played the best game of chess at Hogwarts for years.”
“Do ferns have seeds?”
He bowed. “Greetings.  I am Draco Malfoy, the Ministry’s Centaur Liaison.”
Finally Draco gave a small, surprised “Hmm.”   Ron had tipped his chair back on two legs and was grinning.
“So don’t go home,” Malfoy said absently.
“Rumor has it that if you carry fern seeds in your pocket, you’ll be invisible.  You could give them the slip.”
That night the pug-nosed lassie returned and took Harry back up to the bedroom where Draco was sleeping.  Harry gave him a kiss and called to him:
“You’re apologizing to me, now, in Chichewa, for calling Hermione a Mudblood all those years?”
Draco gave him an inquiring look but didn’t press him. After a while he said, “It was a sleigh where I went.”
He could tell that Harry was restless.  They would probably be gone soon. Granger was continually poring over books in the library; she declined his help with research, but she was polite about it.  He tried to distract his great-aunt from shrieking at her in the hallway.
As a short-eared owl, Rutherford had a nomadic nature.  It was a calm night, and gliding across the English Channel by starlight was a pleasure.
“You know:
Regulus, his mother’s other cousin, was a star in Leo – a strange constellation for a Slytherin, but then he was a mystery.  When Draco had been made Seeker on the Quidditch team, his mother had smiled and said “Like Regulus,” then stopped at his father’s frown.  When Draco asked, his father said that Regulus had displeased the Dark Lord – and that was all.
Longbottom looked surprised but finally spoke. “Wasn’t she on your side?”
The Manor’s own house-elves had been freed by Ministry insistence, and fled. As for the ancestral portraits, Draco no longer cared what they thought.
“You wish!” Harry retorted.
“Just – take these things off,” Draco muttered, trying to unhook Harry’s glasses.
“All right….
He felt, suddenly, that he’d been freezing, and could only be warmed by Malfoy’s body heat.  He wanted to draw Malfoy’s hands across his body, let them thaw his skin.   Guide those clever hands down from his shoulder and across his chest, down from his waist to…  Just the thought was making him hot.
Draco noticed an odd motion in the water.  “Look,” he said.  “Something is cockling the water.”
When they could pause from kissing, Draco said, “I found your ring, and then I knew my aunt must be giving me a sleepy potion, so I didn’t drink it.  How did you find me, all the way East of the Sun and West of the Moon?”
If Draco had understood then that he’d never sire an heir, he could have been spared the humiliation of his failed marriage to Astoria.
“Of course not,” said Draco. “But he’d never have kept it in any case.”
“Real wyverns.”
Potter made a strangled sound.  Draco shoved him.  “Come on, I need space on the bed to do your front.”  He started to lever himself out of the chair onto the bed, and Potter finally rolled over to give him room.
Potter said, “He knows about flying cars and motorcycles, he might have some ideas for the chair.”
Harry wondered what the writing said.  Perhaps it was verse by the poet Xue Tao, who had lived here more than 1000 years ago; the park was created in her honor.
Perhaps Potter wasn’t a complete idiot after all.  Even if he was a hypocrite and would-be murderer.
“I think the Taoist monks get the better hairstyle,” said Draco as they headed up the mountain behind a group of elderly women pilgrims, who were swinging their walking sticks with gusto and chatting cheerfully in Chinese.
It was disturbing.
“A distant one,” Draco smiled.
“The Malfoys lived in Wiltshire, didn’t they?” Harry said.
He didn’t know how long he had been just smiling foolishly into those Fern-green eyes when he recollected himself.  Draco still didn’t know what the plan was – nothing formal, he guessed, given Potter’s clean but slightly shabby clothes – but as host he could always fall back on standard courtesies.  “Would you like some tea?”
“Yes, although the Malfoys have been in England a long time.  But my great grandmother was French, Aurore Chevalier; her son was my grandfather, Abraxas.”
“Yeah.  Anything you do want to say, Malfoy?”
“They would if you asked, but they don’t lay in supplies to feed people during the summer.  And you really don’t want to eat what House-Elves fix for themselves – they have very odd tastes.   I’m heading in to Hogsmeade myself to pick up some bread and things.”
”  Fury had finally helped Draco find his voice.
Harry left them to it.
“Brilliant, Cassia!  I doubt Draco reads medieval Welsh.  Dafydd ap Gwilym is a great poet and wrote mostly love poems.  Some of his racier ones may not be translated in the printed anthologies, but you can check the internet – do you know how to use it?”

“And Susie, Charles, Teddie Neddie Eddie Freddie and Sweetie-Pie!”
“Oh, all kinds of funny things happened when I was a kid – I inflated my Aunt Marge like a balloon once, didn’t even know I was doing it.”
“Ow!” Someone swore in the darkness, and then the bed dipped.  “Budge over,” said a familiar voice.  “Do you expect me to sleep on the floor?”
“Oh, Harry and Draco should do it, I think,” she said smiling. “If you’re willing?”
“’Potter Smells Really Pretty Good After All’?”
“They already know how,” Draco said.  “It’s only small children who wobble around learning.  I’ll look like an idiot.”
“Extraordinarily bad luck?” the man said, half under his breath, then squared his shoulders.  “Honestly, Potter, why would I go traipsing around the middle of Africa to look for you?”
Potter sighed - as if it were Draco who was being annoying - but sat.  “
Harry felt the light touch of Draco’s fingers on his hair.  He shut his eyes and nudged his head back against those hands that always felt like home.  They hadn’t finished, not by a long ways.  Even with his eyes closed, he could see.  Joy lay before him.
“Everyone is related if you’re willing to acknowledge it.  There’s a Potter on my mother’s family tree somewhere, I’m sure of it.  There’s even a Weasley, for that matter.”
“It’s a deal,” said his uncle.
“Oh, I would love to meet her!” Luna said.  “I wonder why I haven’t heard of her before?”
The infant in Harry’s arms whimpers again.  Lily softens as she looks.  An innocent child.  And Harry has survived it all, the abuse and neglect and the Dark Lord’s curses.  Lived to love, and let others live and love.
, Potter, not at me.  What do you see?”
“Treacle tart?  Seriously, Potter?”
“Why would I let you try to crash into me?”
“I know you like to be tickled under your left ear,” Harry said, demonstrating.
Potter was laughing. “What’s fortune-telling by reading smears of chocolate called?”
“He’s my cousin,” Draco said. “And I’d been making the Wolfsbane, so I had an idea where to start.”
“Oh.  Just as well.  It looks like rain today.”
“He’s a bit rough around the edges, but his heart is as big as the rest of him,” the West Wind added reassuringly.
“I don’t – that is – it’s not about
“Hmm.” Harry’s eyes searched Draco’s face. Then they dropped to his lips. “Do you think we could, uh, negotiate another kiss?”
“You could bring Ignatius.  Or if you were more comfortable on your own turf…”
“If only you could have waited a year, I would have been free.  My wicked aunt put a curse on me to be a white bear in the daytime and a man at night, because I wouldn’t marry the troll princess with the nose three ells long.”
“Well, then you know more about it than he does, apparently.”
“It’s not some cock-and-bull story, it’s true.”  Draco fished out the letter to that effect that he had brought to show the centaurs, complete with its Ministry seal.
Finally they came out of the forest into the sunshine.
“Oh, because
“An admirable pursuit,” said Draco.
“You’ll learn fast.  Look how well you balance on a broom; it’ll transfer.  Come on.  I’ll keep an eye out for a rental place.”
“Sure, that’s no favour -”
“No need to listen to him,” Uncle Vernon told the bear, “we never do.”
“Truce?”
"One can never have enough socks."
A young Draco, about seven years old, sat in a chair with a tawny Kneazle on his lap.  He had a small smile and dancing eyes.  He looked happy, mischievous, adored.  Adorable.
“Italy, last I heard, but that was some time ago.  He didn’t … keep in touch.  That wasn’t an English word, though, Potter.  Focus.”
Draco dragged his eyes up to Harry’s and was held there, a moment out of time. “Giddy. Like I’m floating.”
“Not the birds. Someone is sobbing,” Potter said.
“Did not,” Draco said automatically.
“You thought I wouldn’t

Here’s Lily’s son now, Harry – one of those I brought the sword for, and an interesting case for sorting.  Looks like the Headmistress has called someone else in too…  ah, the Malfoy boy that Dumbledore was so worried about.  He seems worried himself, looking at Dumbledore’s portrait.  See him square his shoulders.  He’s apologizing to the portrait!  Harry and McGonagall look surprised.  The air in the room is thawing.
Prompt:
what you said.”
Malfoy’s flat was above a flower shop.  He answered the door with the sleeves of his robes pushed up to his elbows, a tea towel in hand, and an inquisitive look.  Pretending to be washing up, part of some elaborate ruse to make him seem harmless and domestic, no doubt.
Party to a lawsuit, Draco thought.  Avian assault and battery.  “I am sorry.  I didn’t realise you thought I was still living at the Manor.  It’s been shut up for some time.”
“You’d never had pumpkin juice before?”
“Yes, do you—”
“Yeah, I work at a dragon reserve in Romania. It’s a great place, but there’s no broom shop in Romania with a selection like this one has. It’s always a treat to stop by here when I’m in town.”
by Zimbabwean author Shimmer Chinodya.   It described a school in a refugee encampment in the bush, run by guerilla fighters during their war for independence.  Maybe that would make a good lesson.
There was a moment more of silence and then an eruption of cries and cheers. Draco guided Rosemonde to land in a clear spot.  Harry kissed him and then was pulled out and hauled away to be hugged – Weasley and Granger were there, and Lovegood, and Longbottom, and McGonagall.
“Maybe we should find a Sichuan restaurant in London and practice before we go.”
They flew on and on as if they wouldn’t stop until the world’s end, and the North Wind began to tire and weaken so he could barely keep them above the waves.  It was night by the time the North Wind threw Harry ashore beneath the window of a castle.
The game was good but Harry was distracted.
“If she was the daughter of Alfred the Great… about a thousand years ago?”
“You cannot defile our traditions!” said his aunt.  “This wedding will link our family to the house of the great Lord Trolldemort!”
But instead of joining Harry on the sofa, Draco moved to stand by the window.  “Harry … sexual favors aren’t part of the reparations, offered or owed.”
“Mother is too.  She has been in hiding.  She’ll be able to come out now.”
“As slow as you need,” Draco said, holding his eyes.
“Well, if you’re
“In this sun?”  But he was gone.
Maybe that was the problem – that he had expected it to be easy.  That they’d thought they already knew each other.  But actually, their relationship baffled him.  He’d fought against acknowledging that.  He didn’t want to be alone, now that Ron and Hermione were preoccupied with each other; he dreaded the idea of starting over, remembering the fiascos of his other dates with girls.  Ginny had to be the one, because who else was there?
“Understood,” said the bear, facing him again.  “But don’t you want to get out of here?  See the world?  Have an adventure?”
One evening he and Draco were snogging on Draco’s sofa when there was a green whoosh in the fireplace.  To Harry’s confusion, Luna Lovegood’s face appeared in the flames.
Harry didn’t mind.  It was just so fun to be in the air again.  He regained his balance and started to test the broom, trying different maneuvers until he managed a loop-the-loop around Malfoy.  Then he pulled alongside for the pleasure of seeing Malfoy roll his eyes at him.
There were few things Harry wanted less than to pay a social call on Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy.  He had never understood why Lucius was out of Azkaban already, after serving only a few years after the death of Voldemort.  And Harry would be perfectly content never to see Malfoy Manor again.

“Get on with it and post your letter if you’ve got one, Potter,” Draco said. “Otherwise why don’t you go and find your own tower to brood in, and leave me alone?”
“I suppose we can manage the humming on our own,” Draco said. “Is there only the one mince pie?”
“Yeah.”
brain fuzzy, Potter.  I’m quite lucid.  I said they’d been flying around near
“Why should he?” said Uncle Vernon.
“Ah.  I, er, haven’t seen you around for a while, Potter.”  Of course, that could be because Draco hadn’t much felt like going anywhere.
Malfoy threw a gingernut at him.
Ron looked to be torn between indignation and amusement. “Would you stop flirting with my girlfriend, you wanker.”
“There was a boat,” Harry said finally.
“Mmmm?” Draco teased, taking Harry back into his arms.
“What does he look like?”
“That’s good,” Potter said, husky-voiced, licking a finger and stroking Draco’s cheek.  A smudge of chocolate came off on his finger.  Potter dragged his finger slowly over Draco’s lips.
Alaska, they found from the map, was enormous, though sparsely settled.  “This must be seven times the size of Britain,” Draco said.  “Where do we begin?”
“Zmey Gorynych? Sure.  Most famous of the Russian dragons. Mean, green, and many-headed.”
The title is from this
“There, near the mountain!  See the smoke?”
“When is your next concert?”
“That was interesting,” Potter said, looking after Baines with a small frown.  “Seems like there should be more, though.  I mean, I don’t exactly feel qualified to do this yet.”
“No, no,” Draco said.  “You two don’t count.”
“…suck…”
Draco snorted.
“No.  It was a place where they used to burn witches.”
“Since you come bearing strawberries, you may enter,” Malfoy said, plucking the little basket from Harry’s hands.
Terrestrial Guests Welcome – Make your Own Breathing Arrangements
When Harry opened his eyes again, a few owls were looking at him. He didn’t have any post for them to carry, or any owl treats to give. “Sorry,” Harry said with an apologetic shrug. But he felt a little lighter as he turned to go.
“Hole in the toe and threadbare heel – I think you can get rid of this one,” Draco said, holding up a lone sock.
In the long hallway Narcissa took Harry past one portrait after another of haughty-looking Malfoys without comment.  When she paused, it was to point out some resemblance to Draco.
Harry took off his raggedy hand-me-down clothes and sank into his bath.  It was so pleasant he let his eyes drift shut.   When he opened them, he saw that his old clothes were gone, but there was a big fluffy towel and a linen night-shirt laid out for him, and a door leading into a fine bedroom.
When all of these other birds promised to seek so faithfully, how could she, an owl and professional messenger, fail to complete her mission?
“I think that’s Lady Godiva, not a goddess, Luna,” Harry put in.
“Cats and owls, though?”
“I’m here to be diplomatic.  I’m not going to cock a snook at them.”
Draco gave a little protesting groan.
Apparently Potter did enjoy communing with the owls, because he turned up there again a week later. This time Draco had been looking out one of the high windows when Potter appeared and paused in the doorway, empty-handed.
Feeling newly capable, he began looking for more things he could do.
The words stuck in his throat – but he had to tell someone, sometime.  “I poisoned him.”  His voice was hoarse.
“Really?  Can I see it?”
“I like to give her options.  And I think those lizard heads are for you.”
“And you had pumpkin pasties and chocolate frogs!”
“Liaison to the centaurs, now there’s a real honor.”  Spinks snickered.
“Maybe they didn’t know after all,” Draco murmured.
“I – it was a date?”
“Er, well, I’ve been appointed Centaur Liaison.  So the more I know the better, I suppose.”  He held very still as a bony little half-grown thestral sniffed his robes and shuffled its leathery wings.
“Cock-tease is a word too, Malfoy.  You’re a terrible flirt.”
And then Potter turned and left, and Draco could let out his breath and finally turn to look for his wand.  It wasn’t there.  How long had it been gone?  He’d been too weak to try to do anything since the fight – could his wand have been gone that long?  Surely he’d have known?  And why had he been left unguarded with Potter on the loose?
“Hello,” said Harry gently. “I don’t have any food for you, but it’s good to meet you.”
It would have been awkward to refuse. But it was at least as awkward to sit there next to Potter with nothing to say, while Weasley and Granger were absorbed in talking something over.
Her eyes took on a martial glint, and he amended, “-gle-borns?”
“You must have had some idea,” Draco said.  “I notice you didn’t randomly choose a spell that showered me with buttercups.  Just what did you know about it?”
Parvati tilted her head and cupped Lavender’s scarred cheek in her warm hand. They pressed their lips together, and Parvati’s body was soft against her own. “Oh,” Lavender breathed.
So he invited Draco to dinner at Grimmauld Place, hinting at a task for the Magical Repairs and Reparations service.
name!”
“How about a pudgy dog?” Potter moved his hand to stroke the shaggy brown dog sitting at Draco’s feet.
The Hippogriff, watching, pranced its own version.
“Er – I didn’t know that would happen.”
That night, after a dinner of Sichuan dumplings in spicy sauce, he spent half an hour blowing into the flute without getting more than a couple of squawks of sound.  At least it looked nice.  In time, maybe he could coax music from it.
Draco explained his position as Centaur Liaison.  “I’d better go look for them again,” he said.
“I’m glad you don’t carry a camera and work for
“How am I supposed to get down there?”
“I thought of a poem,” Harry said.
“Look for me again in a month’s time.  I may have something to tell you then.”
Harry snorted and considered what kind of drink to make for Malfoy.  Something pretentious.
Draco drew him close, nuzzled his neck.  “Mmm-hmm.”
“It’s a partial truth, and not the point.  It’s misleading.”
“No, thank you.  I prefer my penises attached to bodies.”
“Smuggling what?”  Potter looked suspicious.
“Mmm.  I’d like apple orchards and rosebushes, myself.”
Harry thought.  “He’s not dirty,” Harry said.  “And he stays outside when he’s a bear.  He’s not a bear when he’s in bed.”
8888888
“A boat?”
he thought, oddly comforted.
Draco gave up on trying to find diplomatic replies, told Merfley where to look for a bottle of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky, and went to sort out a place for the Abraxan to stay.
No one came to Malawi for the cuisine.
The man arched an eyebrow at them.  “Sounds like a date.”
A tide of longing swept over her and she sank onto a bench.  She found herself crying.
Harry grinned.
remember. All week I’ve been trying to figure out how that could be.” Potter began to pace back and forth. “I almost
One head was definitely drooping.
“I don’t understand the rush.” Potter frowned, staring out the window.  “They ought to give us time to figure things out. Relax and explore, now that there’s no war on.”
“We can talk about the war if we need to,” Harry said.  “But do we need to?  You’ve said you changed your beliefs, and I believe you.  I wasn’t a saint either.  If we have to go back and apologise for every single thing….  There was something Chaucer said.  Let me find it – I marked it.”
One day Draco came back from a ride unusually silent.  “Where did you go today?”  Harry asked.
They had seldom spoken in the years since the war ended, but Draco felt a need to at least be civil.
Then she is in this bedroom again with her son, and it chills her for a moment, to see Malfoy-blond hair on this child with Harry’s eyes.
Harry knew he wasn’t much of a dancer.  “There’s no music,” he said.
, he told himself.
The owl looked smug.  “You can find your own way out, I’m sure,” Harry told it and Apparated.
Had Malfoy cast a wordless
Prompt:
That jolt of desire again, drawing him toward those laughing lips….
Harry tilted his head so his nose rubbed along Malfoy’s jaw line and his mouth almost touched that pale smooth throat.  “What?” he asked, so close to Malfoy’s skin that he felt the reflected warmth of his own breath.
“Who’s this then?”  Potter stretched out a hand to Wombat, who roused himself enough to sniff the fingers.
For you I crossed a stormy sea,
Draco
“I didn’t leave you.  I didn’t know what to do, but I didn’t leave you.”
“I don’t want to live there,” Harry said.  “Just visit.  Just have a little change of scenery, talk to some other human beings.  In daylight.  Is that too much to ask?”
Would it have changed Draco’s decisions?  But he would still have been a Malfoy.  Draco tried to imagine who he would be, if he hadn’t been his father’s son.
“I have some things to attend to.”  Malfoy moved to the window and looked out.
“What are you talking about?  Rule over the local merpeople?  No, Potter, I don’t think I could keep a bubble-head charm going that long.”
“Yes,” said Harry, wondering how Malfoy knew all that.
Luna nodded gravely. “It would be a diminished world.”
“If you’re going to be named for a constellation, shouldn’t you be Ursa Major at least?”
“Magic tends to come in threes,” Draco said.  “Is there an outside tap?”
“What?  No, I mean, of course you can – go wherever, I guess, just – it would be too strange to run into you here of all places and then not talk any more than this.”
“I need to take a walk.”
Now Potter looked puzzled. “A marriage? But your father’s already married.”
—tossed their heads as they galloped along.
my father with his
“Oh – sorry about those.”  Harry didn’t mind them, really, and they were convenient in the absence of refrigeration or cooling charms.  But he could see that the orange color might be a little off-putting.
“What the fuck is wrong with this room?”
“I think we’ve served our term.  I imagine we could get the Room of Requirement, though.”
Herman bobbed vigorously.
“It’s serious,” Draco said.  “But at least they are talking, we are talking, trying to figure something out.  If we can listen, and respect each other, and work together….”
“That whole business with Dumbledore’s wand – that was strange, though.” Malfoy frowned.  “I’ve never understood why it was so easy to make Dumbledore lose his wand that night.”
the laddie that ought to have had him!”
“Should I be jealous?”
A smile gleamed in Malfoy’s eyes.  “Good.  Want to get breakfast and go snorkeling?”
Harry opened his mouth to answer and found he wasn’t sure what to say. Indeed, how was Malfoy?  Just before the fierce fun of the snowball fight, there had been that odd moment when Malfoy seemed to have gone somewhere else but left his body behind.  He’d looked so shaken afterwards.
“No!  He – I don’t want him to – Get away from me!” Draco said, pushing himself to the farthest corner of the bed.
But for now, flower designs were extremely distracting.
“Yeah.”
“Just a Gin and Tonic.” The man turned around and began pouring it.
“So what do you think?” Harry asked impatiently.
“Cole?” Harry interrupted. Malfoy’s eyes shot up.
Now that Harry looked at Draco properly, he could see that his hands were still shaking and he looked a bit like a hurt puppy dog. It reminded him of the young Draco being rejected of Harry’s friendship. Harry waved his hand at Draco. Making him come and sit next to Harry on the couch.
But he felt Draco’s hands begin to fiddle with his belt buckle. The small compression of the belt against Harry’s cock made him almost scream out. He was so sensitive.
“You look like a Harry.” He commented, a glint in his eyes.
“Are you okay with this?”
“Hey Draco, this is Andy.”
“I was just leaving actually, but hopefully you two will have fun.” Hermione replied, slowly beginning her walk towards the gate.
“It’s a bit of an accident really, I got in an argument with a friend and just apparated away. Wasn’t really intentional.”
!” Draco cries, lifting his hand to grab onto the poster of his bed to stop his head being rammed into the headboard. He arches his throat, eyes rolling back into his head, Harry can hardly take his eyes away from the show he’s putting on.
“Not yet. I want you to be stretched out and ready for me. I don’t want you to feel a second of pain, just pleasure.” Malfoy returned his tongue back to Harry’s hole, finally pushing a third finger into him, this digit slipping in easily along with the other two.
He laid the shirt out on the bed and began removing his black button up and jeans. Once his button up was off, he heard Malfoy shout from the bathroom.
“Yeah, we were room mates for a while back in France.”
“No worries!” Draco shouted back to him.
"Well then here's Teddy."
Either Ron or Hermione came over before their work to check on him and Teddy. There was still some awkwardness between the two boys but it was nothing that a good quidditch conversation couldn't remove. The subject of Ginny was avoided like it was Voldemort's name itself.
"It's already late and I don't want to impose any longer so tomorrow it is."
"There is always chocolate", Harry omniously.
Andromeda stared at him in sympathy, holding a sleeping two month old Teddy "Edward" Lupin in her arms. Teddy, who would soon be coming to live with him because he was Teddy's godfather. He could do this. He had to! This little boy who had lost his parents to the war would not be growing up a orphan. He would have all the love Harry could give to him.
"How about this? We both go and get some ice cream right now, you can even get double scoops, and then we go home. Deal?", Harry offered, luring Teddy in with the offer of delicious ice cream, effectively distracting him and pulling his attention away from the broomstick.
"Oh yeah. Sorry. Come on in. Food will be here soon. We're having pizza and salad", Harry replied.
"Fine," Teddy drew out the letters in annoyance and then brightened, "Pizza for dinner please?"
The floo lightened. Malfoy had decided to come after all. He stepped out of the floo gracefully and nodded at them. He was dressed casually, in muggle clothes in fact! Black jeans hugged his long legs and a loose grey shirt hung from his lean shoulder and his hair looked soft and fluffy. He looked like he had put in no efforts in dressing up but still had come out looking cute. Harry stopped that train of thought immediately. This was not something he wanted to think about right now.
"Hungry Teddy? Lets have dinner.", he asked Teddy.
Harry Potter could absolutely not believe that this life that he was living, this moment that he was experiencing was completely true.
It had been a few long months since Teddy had come into Harry's care. The first few days felt like pure torture. Changing a nappy, feeding baby, getting a baby to sleep and looking after a metamorphagous child were not Harry's cup of tea. However, he had slowly adjusted to having Teddy there and now, being as familiar with Teddy's routine as his own, Harry felt like a professional baby caretaker.
"Are you sure you will handle having Teddy? He can certainly stay with me," Andromeda started, cooing at Teddy when he startled awake and drifted back to sleep, "You have done enough for our world. Take some time for yourself. Maybe enjoy the simplicities of life for once."
"Potter,
"Uh yeah Malfoy, could you watch Teddy for some time while I go do some shopping?", Harry sloped his eyebrows towards Teddy as he said that so that Malfoy would get the gist of what he meant.
They had put Teddy to bed and come out into the living room. There was a moment of awkward silence between them. Neither one was sure of what to say. Draco pursed his lips, and looked around for a few seconds while Harry looked down, interested in his shoes.
And so Harry called out to Malfoy who turned his head around sharply at the sound of his name. His gaze locked onto Harry and Teddy and the stoic look on his face softened just a bit. Weaving through the throngs of witches and wizards on the road, he made their way towards them.
Harry made a face at the combination but relented and the pair made their way through the crowded Diagon Alley to Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour. Harry bought the two of them their ice creams and they sat down at a table.
P.s. I couldn't wait until next week to post it so here its is!😄
He honestly did want to know more. His father had blinded him to the muggle culture and practically ingrained in him that sense of hatred. But after the war, he had tried to change his perspective. He had kept an open mind and it really blown his mind how muggles functioned and the way they had evolved.
Harry stood there in regret. He had just come to a realization. It had hit him in the face with the force of a truck. He was attracted to Draco-bloody-Malfoy. Merlin, if one was a schoolgirl, they might even say that he had a crush. He had to fix this.
Draco Malfoy stood across the street, back facing the duo, staring at the windows of some shops. His neck was wrapped in a scarf that was adorned in Slytherin colours. His wore a black coat that fluttered gently in the wind. His blonde - almost white, hair moved in the wind too, occasionaly setting on his forehead that he pushed back with annoyance.
Draco stood shocked. Had Harry just relented to the fact that Teddy would not be a Gryffindor? He had expected a fight for Merlin's sake. His brain had already come up with atleast three responses for what Harry could have said. It was practically a reflex to think of responses to their fights.
(He ended up taking too much time, returning with no pet but a broomstick, and so Teddy stayed the night with Draco. He was informed by a little bird - Teddy, that the tradition had been  followed had been followed down to the last step.)
Then, he and Teddy took the utensils to the living room so that they could enjoy the television with dinner. Teddy looked a little sad that he couldn't go over to Malfoy's but he was in for a surprise soon.
"Oh! Um, would you like to stay for some dessert?", Harry blurted out. He didn't want Draco to go so soon, not when he had enjoyed his company so much when he didn't know he could.
"Hey! It's not as if you Slytherins are any sharp either. If anything, the entire lot is you is as dumb as a Niffler." replied Harry.
"Just as you went from a blushing idiot to a shocking idiot," replied Draco. He mentally scolded himself, what a pathetic comeback.
But Harry was not moved. This little rascal had been with him for four years now. Those eyes no longer swayed him and he prided himself at that.
"The wizarding world is too outdated. They could really benefit from muggle tecnology should they decide to more accepting of them," replied Harry.
"You can have just two presents this year Teddy. We don't want you growing up all spoiled and rotten now, do we? And besides we had already decided that when we left home. You promised too."
"Teddy, how would you like to spend some time with Draco?"
And with those words, Draco swept of the room, his robes fluttering behind him, not unlike Snape. He was gone before Harry could even utter a single word.
"Yes."
"Can we have ice cream afterwards?"
He looked like someone who had free time on their hands as far as Harry could tell and the problem of leaving Teddy alone had been solved too. Harry had complete faith that Teddy would be safe in Malfoy's hands. He had, after all been babysitting him quite often for the past year.
Malfoy smirked at him as if reading his thoughts. He then looked down at Teddy and hugged him.
Draco scowled at him for that as he answered,"Electricity."
"Please Harry. Pretty please with a cherry on top and some chocolate sauce too?", Teddy begged. His had his eyebrows raised high, his face bent down as he looked up at Harry through his eyelashes, his eyes wide and his entire being giving off innocence.
"I am sure you didn't mean it like that Potter. No subtlety can be expected from you Gryffindors anyways.  A drunk thestral would be more subtle," Draco bloody Malfoy quipped back.
Soon, they had finished eating and Harry had taken the bowls to the sink for washing. He was lost in his thoughts, thinking about what Teddy and him would have for lunch tomorrow and how he had to visit Hermione tomorrow for their weekly Monday get togethers. Ron would be there too if he would be free from work. He thought of telling them of this craziness, of the fact that he was practically-
Harry had to admit it was surprisingly pleasant. He liked seeing Draco and Teddy interact as they guessed answers to a quiz show on the television. He liked seeing Draco and he especially loved the way he glanced at Harry and commented on something Harry had just said. He loved the way they kept up a witty banter throughout dinner and eventually put Teddy into bed together. He loved the fact that Draco read Teddy a story while he stood in the doorway. Maybe he was attracted to him and the promise of domesticity and family he brought with himself.
Teddy looked up at him with wide eyes, begging silently for just another present. The broom had caught his eye just as they were passing the shop. Its perfectly polished handle twinkled in the afternoon sun and Teddy was absolutely captivated by the sight of that amazing piece of wood. It was love at first sight honestly.
Boy did he have an unhealthy obsession with ice cream. Harry looked at him thinking. They had had ice cream just the day before. Teddy would definitely get sick if they had it today too. So, he just raised an eyebrow at him, looking at him with that look that made Teddy absolutely question his desicion.
Harry just ignored him. He did not want to go picking fights right now. Whatever Draco had to say he could say it if he wanted to. It wasn't as if anyone was stopping him.
The morning were slow. Harry had always been an early riser, wanting to cherish the few moments of silence that the morning offered before it was overcome by noise, either because of the Durseley's, the Hogwarts boys dorm room or a crying Teddy.
It had been a month since the end of the Second Wizard War and the defeat of Voldemort. The Ministry was in complete shambles, building back to a new glory under Kingsley Shacklebolt. The Daily Prophet had convinved the public that Harry was literally Merlin on earth, after all how could a person survive against the darkest lord of all time so many times.
"Merlin how did we even go from sexual innuendos to Teddy house?", asked Harry.
"Electricity," Harry repeated," There is an entire grid of network that supplies current to homes so that electronic devices can work. I don't really know the finer details but it is the muggle equivalent of magic, I suppose."
"Yeah I know. I don't need the entire lecture on being punctual and responsible from you after Andy has already saved you the trouble"
Hey guys! Please leave some comments to let let me know what you think of the story so far.
Malfoy continued to look at Harry with smugness as if knowing exactly what Harry was thinking. He probably did too! He may have caught them last year, but Harry would deny that to his last breath. Teddy was not staying up until midnight on his birthday. No sire, absolutely not. How preposterous of Malfoy to have had such a thought and put it into Andy's mind!
Harry thought back to his reply. Bloody hell, he had just asked Malfoy to dinner. And yes Teddy would be present, but still Malfoy had asked for Teddy and had gotten the both of them in return. That was forcing his company wasn't it? But still, Malfoy could always decide not to come. They may be amiable after this much time, but that didn't mean they were friends.
He tried to rectify his mistake,"Uh no I didn't mean it like that. I was just-ugh!"
Hi! I know this is a really short chapter bit I literally couldn't make it longer. I promise the next one's going to be so much better and longer.
Malfoy."
As Teddy ran to wash his hands, Harry placed their orders. He was bringing out the plates when a tapping interrupted him. An owl was at the window and by the look of it, it was Malfoy's. He opened the window to let in Aristo - an ostentious name really, and removed the letter from him. Aristo nipped at his fingers at the lack of a treat and flew over to Teddy, who had just entered the room, and looked at Harry expectantly. Ah! So Harry had to reply to the lettter too.
"Call me Harry, Malfoy. You practically have joint custody of Teddy and now you are over for dinner. We might as well call each other by our first names."
Hi! Please leave Kudos and comments if you like it!
"So you've decided then? It is certain."
Harry wanted to buy Teddy a cat and had decided to buy it as a secret birthday present. However, he would have to leave Teddy alone at the table to go make his purchase, something that he was not comfortable doing. Just as he thought of what he could do, the solution presented itself - or rather, himself.
Harry however took Draco's statement in the wrong way. He thought that Draco was looking down on the muggles, insulting them for being themselves.
Finally Harry replied with a yes and Teddy and Malfoy got up and made forward into the crowd, going Merlin knows where while Harry started on his quest for a pet.
They ate in silence. Draco glanced up frequently, his gaze questioning as he glanced at something behind Harry. He looked like he wanted to ask something but then thought better of it.
"Electri- what?"
Mostly, they avoided any and every topic of their life before the war. Thus, their conversations strictly revolved around whether Draco could look after Teddy when Harry was busy and whether they could go out that Sunday for a picnic or to a park, since Teddy liked to be with the both of them together.
I know that this is probably too late of an invitation but it would be amazing if Teddy could join me for dinner tonight. Mother is out socializing and. I would love for some company. Reply quickly.
Harry wished the earth would swallow him up. Merlins bloody balls, where was Voldemort when you needed him? Not so great now, was he? Anything would be a sweeter alternative than standing here having embarassed himself to the end of the world.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows and smirked, "A little late to be shopping right now Potter. Don't you think so?"
He unrolled it and read.
Then, while Harry worked in the living room, Teddy played and gurgled and entertained himself. Sometimes, Harry would visit Bill and Fleur. Teddy and Victoire were practically inseparable when together, cooing and dissolving into fits of giggles over jokes that only babies understood.
Andromeda, called Andy by family, had introduced Draco to Teddy and Harry had been dragged into it. Initially, things had been extremely frosty between the two of them. But then, without the constant threat of a war looming over them and the combined mission of taking care of Teddy had eventually united them. Atleast, it had united them enough that what had been angry glares had turned into awkward silences. They had turned from enemies into some sort of acquaintances, barely friends.
So far he had brought up his hand exactly thirteen times to knock but then backed off, knocked so pathetically that the sound didn't even reach his ears five times and was gathering all of his Gryffindor courage to knock properly when the door swung open and he jumped back surprised.
But maybe there was something he could do. He quickly grabbed his pen, wrote his reply and sent it off with Aristo.
Draco glared at him,"You shouldn't be calling your godson Teddy that. He is a future Slytherin."
So, Harry said,"What's it to you? It is not as if you want to learn about the muggle world. Why would you?"
"Okay. Lets ask him then."
They moved to the kitchen and Harry removed two bowls and handed them to Draco, who set them on the table. He then removed the ice cream from the refridgerator and scooped it into the bowls.
"Yes. Now, all of Teddy's belongings are in the living room. Would you like to take them now or have me someone take them to you tomorrow?"
The trio went into the living room. Harry and Malfoy, no Draco, sat on the sofa while Teddy climbed into Harry's lap, switching the television to a channel of his choice. Soon the food arrived and they had it.
Harry couldn't help but think how pitiful he must look, standing there outside Andromeda's house in the rain. The raindrops rolled down his face, frequently coming into his eyes and irritating him. It was his fault however that he hadn't put on the impervius charm before leaving home.
"Uncle Draco?"
"As certain as I can be. Don't worry. I'll take proper care of Teddy and you'll be there to help me through with it, won't you?"
“Really? A staggered time jump is exceedingly rare. Can you tell me a bit about what happened?” Lucius sat down opposite Harry.
“Malfoy.” Harry whispered into the circle.
So instead he crossed fifteen of the houses off the list, leaving only the top five left.
Harry is suddenly aware of how much his legs hurt, and how his stomach feels a little bit raw.
“Touché.”
“Woah.” Harry whispered, lifting his hand to pat on the windowpane. “It’s beautiful.”
“No actually, just me.”
Harry turned back to his small table and took a seat. He pulled out the photos of the old cottage and his notebook and began scribbling down what he was going to change and sketching a few ideas for the new décor of the rooms.
“Was that lightening?” The man asked.
“Of course, oh holy one.”
“like what?”
“But what about our date, for tomorrow. Are we still on?”
Whilst her words seemed accusatory, her face showed her amusement.
They did look lovely though. His shipment of flower bulbs had come in this morning and were currently resting up in the attic, ready to be planted.
“Ya’know, a date?”
He leant forward and kissed each of Draco’s cheeks, softly moulding his lips onto the tear mounds, kissing the wet away. He could taste the salt on his mouth now, a bittersweet flavour that lured Harry back towards Draco’s mouth again. When his lips were only a hairs-width apart he softly whispered “I know” before leaning into Draco’s pout.
Harry gasped, parting his lips, Draco took advantage of the opportunity and pressed his tongue inside, stroking and sliding and plunging, until Harry’s head flew, making him grab onto the armrest behind him.
“We can when the delivery men leave, anyways, muggle furniture is made better. Magic furniture is just… weird.” Harry explained, peeling away some of the sofa’s cover-up to marvel at the grey plaid fabric underneath.
That was a
“Are you sure?” Christopher speculated.
“What about the Weaselette?”
“Wanna bet?”
“So when are you planning on bringing your stuff over then Malfoy?” Harry questioned, attempting to interrupt the catty blanket that had settled over them.
Draco blushed, feeling his ear tips redden.
“What?”
Harry sat down on the floor, ignoring how cold the concrete felt against his bum.
Draco nudged Harry’s elbow, he took the prompt and lifted up the jewellery box, opening it to reveal the shattered time turner. Lucius curiously looked into the box, his mouth opening slightly.
“I think I owe you an apology, Harry.” Hermione said, guilty. “I was really acting out-of-order last night.”
“I already told you. Because I nee-“
“That’s a really good idea Draco… But who would I rent it to?”
Harry’s softening cock slips out of him. He can’t even conjure the energy to summon his wand and clean up the mess, so instead, he tentatively rolls to the middle of the big bed onto his back, panting. Draco does the same next to him. They lie there breathing together.
The blond glanced at Harry one last time for confirmation, Harry nodded and took a step closer as Malfoy looked inside.
… it couldn’t be…
“I just broke up with my boyfriend.”
“Like a little puppy-dog,” he explained. “It makes me nervous.”
“Good.” Harry replied, doing up the last button of his shirt.
Maybe
“These chocolate biscuits really are lovely though.” George said, appearing out of no where from the opposite side of the table, three large biscuits resting in his palms.
After a second, they were both stood at the end of the dark alleyway, Draco a few steps ahead of Harry.
“You alright there?” She dropped her eyes back down to the magazine she was reading, not listening out for Harry’s answer.
James grimaced. “I thought I’d never have to see his face again.”
Ron’s body came flying through the door, a draft of wind blowing into the room after him. He clutched a toothbrush in one hand and the Daily prophet in the other (not to mention the very appetising trail of white, frothy toothpaste that ran down his chin).
“We never got that far actually; he was a bit of a dick. Some other guy got rid of him for me.”
Next time Draco looked up, a delicate blush was sprinkled over Harry’s cheeks.
Draco let go and took a step back to look at Harry. Harry’s skin prickled, knowing how exposed he was to Malfoy.
“Hey!” Draco flushed, as if he wasn’t feeling enough shame and arousal already.
Malfoy seemed to turn back on and caught up with Harry across the road, where he took them into his flat block and within five minutes, Harry was unlocking the door.
“Really.” Draco replied, taking a big gulp of water.
“Harry, tell him!” Andy shouted, standing up from the table, even from this distance his height stacked over Draco. “Tell him that I’m your boyfriend.”
At that, Malfoy let out a puff of air, using his left hand to stroke his own arm in a comforting gesture.
After undoing the wrapping with upmost precision, a white shoe box lay inside and when he opened the lid, on the paper scraps, sat an aggressively pink fedora.
Draco cried out. And when Harry does it again, Draco muffles a string of wordless sounds from his throat, pressing his moaning mouth against his own arm.
“Yes.”
Draco felt like screaming.
“Why?!!” Draco strained his words, still shocked at Harry’s ask. Although he knew exactly why Harry wanted to see it, because evem the thought of Harry watching him pleasure himself sent erotic shivers down his spine.
Luckily, the couch just fit through the front door and they could place it in the living room.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, settling down on the arm chair of the sofa further.
Harry stood in front of the group without moving at all for a good ten seconds before Pansy shouted, “Get on with it, Potter!”
fine.
“What do you want to know?” Malfoy shifted above Harry; fidgeting his feet.
Draco came out of the bathroom, opening the door slowly.
“Doesn’t matter, you look hot as fuck like that. I could hardly contain myself in front of Mae.”
After the quick bang of apparation, Harry found himself back at home, once again.
“Really?”
“Well, isn’t that exciting?” She asked.
“Surely -the boy who defeated the dark lord- isn’t too scared to say the word prostitute.” Harry felt heat rise to his cheeks at his lack of maturity. He pretended that Malfoy’s words had no impact on him.
Why couldn’t Harry stop thinking about Malfoy?
It’d have to do.
“Yes! Of course I do! It’s just that uhhh…” Harry ploughed his mind desperately for an excuse. “I um…” Oh Merlin, how would he get out of this one, “I ya’know…” Harry made a lewd wanking gesture with his hand, his eyes shooting down to his dick as he whistled.
“You do to.”
Nothing particularly interesting then.
“She’s seen worse.”
Which reminded him of his current situation. He was getting dressed to go to the yearly Weasley Christmas party, which he was extremely nervous for. Perhaps he was friendly with most of the Weasley’s now that the war was over, but he had never been able to break through the hard exterior of Molly Weasley. It always made him uncomfortable when he could feel her disapproving gaze set on him from across the room. Whilst she’d never said anything directly to him, Draco got the vibe that she still didn’t trust him.
“What a nice owl.” Harry announced, he’d gotten to use to other owls wagering to get a second treat.
“That’s it, the womans gone bloody insane, sticking up for a Malfoy!” Her glance fell to the floor. “At least Harry agrees, the prick got what he deserves right?”
It was time for Harry and Draco’s weekly date to Draco’s coffee shop,
Harry furrowed his eyebrows.
. He needed lube.
“What?”
“Yes! And even if you don’t get good – which is unlikely – you obviously find drawing entertaining, otherwise you wouldn’t be sketching so much.”
“Are you sure you can’t forgive him?”
Cole.
“It’s a basement, no windows, very dark.” Harry explained, Malfoy’s eyes immediately widened.
Draco pulled back slightly and squinted at Harry’s cheek. He swiftly lifted his finger to his cheek and began rubbing at it.
The door chimed as they walked through, the small bell echoing through the café.
Harry just shrugged his shoulders.
“Do you want to come in?” Draco asked, leaning the door open slightly more. Harry fell out of his daze and immediately thanked Malfoy, pushing passed him to get inside. He flicked his shoes off next to the stairs.
Surely not, Draco must be misreading the situation. But
“Sorry for wasting your time.” She apologised to the estate agent. She was obviously now in a horrible mood.
After the next few spins, Harry still hadn’t gotten landed on.
He lifted his hands away, resting his head to the side.
“Well, it’s lovely doing business with you Mr Potter.” The agent held out her hand.
“What about the article?”
“It’s okay Draco.” Harry comforted. He pulled away slightly, so his eyes could meet the blond’s. “We can also talk to Hermione and Ron about it, I’m sure they wouldn’t get you in trouble. They could help.” Harry stroked his cheek absentmindedly with his thumb, and Draco snuggled into it.
His skin was the same colour but his eyes bore a brilliant blue instead of their usual green.
That left enough time to have about seven more dreams about Malfoy before he had to wake up for the morning. His first dream had been tame enough, just being of Malfoy giving him a blowjob. The second, however, made Harry’s head ache as images of him thrusting into Malfoy’s arse shuffled through his head. The third of the night was definitely the worst, it detailed leather whips and Malfoy being tied up against two wide bedposts whilst a dildo pumped in and out of his hole. Harry groaned, his length becoming impossibly harder.
What would even be at the top. Maybe a bedroom or a lab or a prison or a red room or a… well that’s it really. Harry looked behind himself to see Malfoy was following him up the staircase from behind.
“Of course.”
“We better get back to the flower plans.” Mia prompted. Harry quickly looked between the clock and Mia herself.
“Thank you.” Harry complimented. “For making my first time perfect.” Harry smiled as Draco wrapped an arm around Harry’s body.
“You taste like grass.” He commented, cringing his nose.
, just to feel something.”
“You might be exaggerating a little, Draco.”
Harry suddenly remembered why he used to love Ginny. Well, perhaps it was more of a sisterly love than one that brimmed with romance, but still, his heart ached slightly at seeing her again.
“How often do you go there?”
“Bedroom?” He continued the kiss immediately, desperate not to lose even a second of the taste. Harry settled his hands on Draco’s chest, before softly moving one hand to grab Draco’s and pulling away.
Harry pulled his wobbly legs off of the bed, almost falling over when he went to pick himself up.
“Honestly Harry, I really don’t care about any of that. You may have led me on” He paused, popping two sugar cubes in his own cup of tea , “–which wasn’t cool, by the way– but I’d only met you once before. I don’t really have any feet to stand on to be angry.” Cole explained, twirling his teaspoon in his cup.
Draco looked just as vulnerable as Harry felt in that moment. He took three steps closer to Harry and turned to sit next to him on the bed.
He’d managed to make the whole day avoiding his evident attraction to Malfoy, but at this point, he couldn’t avoid it. He was used to having about one wet dream a night about the boy, which was how he’d lived for the past week, but three was just too many. The result of these dreams left him with an extremely hard, and painful case of blue balls.
“You don’t care?”
“Ooooooh let’s play a game!” Catherine offered.
“Really?”
“Okay then.” Harry half-heartedly agreed.
Actually, why was Malfoy following him up the stairs instead of showing him where to go?
When Harry looked up, he saw that Ginny had already poured him a shot.
“How about a bit of truth or dare?” Cole suggested.
“It’s okay.” Draco snuggled in further, whimpering slightly when Harry pulled him back an inch, his arms still wrapped around Draco, but now dropping to rest on his lower back.
Harry frowned at the table, there in itself was a reason why Harry could never date Cole. Harry didn’t want to date someone who would swoon whenever they saw Harry or would think themselves to be lucky to have Harry as their partner. Harry was only wizard after all, he had a lot of flaws.
him, but he treated me so well. We would go out to all the best restaurants and he would buy me jewellery and cakes and wine and anything I asked for.”
He was at the cottage, sipping on his morning coffee when an owl knocked on one of his windows, from it’s leg, Harry could see the Daily Prophet, with a large red bow pinned to the top.
He tagged the letter onto the owl’s leg with care before waving the owl away. It waited for a few seconds just like the previous owl. “No treats, sorry.” The owl hooted a disgruntled hoot before flying away.
“We literally live together, Harry.”
“What are you-“
When Harry looked down, he saw Alex staring at his now exposed penis.
“Ron!” Hermione scolded. “Malfoy’s sexuality – whatever that is – has nothing to do with Harry!” She said, slapping him around the back of the head. Ron raised a hand to pat at where he’d just been hit.
Harry nodded, and lifted himself from the creaky office chair, leaving Kingsley’s office to walk to his own.
“Are you sure you don’t want to come and sit dow-”
The door creaked open a second time to reveal the face of Narcissa, looking at the two boys from a crack in the door.
“I’m busy tonight, I’m meeting Mia at my house to bring in some new furniture. How about tomorrow night, 9pm.” Harry offered, Malfoy quickly nodded.
Draco chose to ignore Harry’s sub-par cooking skills and instead settled on quizzing Andy, who was now sat opposite Draco.
Was Draco talking about Harry? To Harry. But more to a random stranger he didn’t know, who also happened to be Harry.
“No shit, Potter.” Malfoy bent down, picking up his wand with his non-injured hand.
“Well, here are a few modern pictures.” The agent handed over a stack of photos, along with some documents detailing the property.
“Do you realise how hot that is?”
What we think so far?
Malfoy pulled himself off of the beds, the sheets draping away from his body elegently. He took a few steps towards the wardrobe and the subtle wobble of Draco’s arse made Harry’s already spent cock attempt to fill once again.
.” Draco spat. He didn’t quite know why he’d said it like that, it’s not like he was
“Okay.” Harry reluctantly agreed.
“How have I been so blind?” Harry chucked the shirt on over his head, angrily tugging at the sleeves and getting stuck in the neck hole for half a second.
Harry felt bad about asking Hermione for help on another of his problems, but he knew that her lack of activity from being pregnant was driving her crazy, so she’d probably accept it happily. So, Harry strolled down to the living room and chucked the paper at her resting body.
“Yes.” She turned back around, pulling the kettle away from the stove. “I’m just so excited!” She exclaimed, enthusiastically getting the teacups. “I can’t wait to see her!”
Draco left his spoon alone, abandoning it in favour of running his hands through his hair.
Harry stopped his internal monologue. He was sure Malfoy wouldn’t think any of that.
Draco rolled his eyes and poured the expensive alcohol into two mugs.
“Boring.”
“Go out then, find something else to do… Do you like roller blading?”
“Promise you won’t leave me Harry.”
Harry smiled, “I knew you’d come arou-“
Now he wasn’t even sure he had a plan. His only plan was Malfoy, not that he’d ever thought about them having a family consciously, but in the back of his mind, the thought had settled, even if they had only been together for a short time.
The two boys answered “Crap.” And “Good.” In unison.
Harry rubbed his eyes at the sun streaming viciously through his moth holed curtains, straining his hardly adjusted pupils at the sudden light. He admired the way it lit up the dust particles for a few moments in his sleepy haze.
“I know, saint Malfoy does sound like quite a worthy title, doesn’t it? Far superior to Mr Malfoy.”
“What?” Harry grunted; his eyes wet.
Now here was the question:
“Cool, See you then.” She waved.
happening.
Harry didn’t know how he was ever going to be able to sleep when Malfoy’s breathing was so loud. He tried to anyways, pushing his head into the pillow and shutting his eyes, his body rigid as a post.
Harry glanced behind Malfoy to see a group of people that Harry was sure weren’t there a second ago. He squinted at each of the faces slightly more. Were they-
“No need, I’ve already done that.” Malfoy grinned, Harry’s mind was suddenly ambushed with images of Malfoy in a toilet stall at work thrusting his fingers inside himself to the thought of Harry.
“Hi, I’m Damien.” He held a hand forward for Draco to take, Draco accepted the handshake (he probably deserved a warm welcome considering how Draco had rudely interrupted them last night).
Draco hid his jealousy;
A new revelation of his past.
“Sit back.”
Harry turned around to his bedside table where his wand lay, he pointed it to Draco’s body and half-heartedly mumbled a spell. Draco felt clean in an instant. Harry slumped the wand back on the bedside and turned on his side to face Draco, lifting his head up on a bent arm.
Bonjour.
“You could’ve lied.” Malfoy gulped.
“Can I just have a regular americano?” Harry ordered. The man nodded slightly and turned to the machines. “I’ll ask for the rest later.” The cashier turned his head to shoot Harry a wide smile. Harry felt very stupid.
Cole dragged him through to a less densely populated area of the house, that maybe only had about ten people in the room.
“He hasn’t told you yet?” Harry asked, ignoring the twinge of jealousy that Cole could talk to Malfoy.
“Yes.”
Once Malfoy was all the way back to his tip, he pushed back in, filling Harry up again, this time, the pleasure hit Harry tenfold. “Merlin.” He mumbled, letting a wave of pleasure crash over him as Malfoy thrusted deep inside.
“Well I have been struggling to sell it, but mainly because I’m too picky about who’ll get it.” She explained, casting Harry a shy smile.
“You know what?”
“That’s Malfoy, he’s a mate. Why? Do you like the look of him?”
Harry pushed Draco, his back now against the bed sheets as Harry pulled his leg over him, to sit next to him and pull down the zipper of his own pants. Harry tugged the jeans off of himself and was faintly aware of Draco doing the same next to him, until they were both in only their underwear.
Except, he wasn’t staring into a wall, he was instead staring into a blond head of hair.
“Well, I went to Beauxbatons Academy.”
“Oh, no! We’re not like… dating.” Narcissa tilted her head to the side before laughing.
Harry turned around to Draco. As soon as he turned, Draco sprung up from his seat.
“It’d be nice to see a familiar place, I guess.”
“You’re sick.” Harry dragged the fabric over his shaking legs. “What about everything you told me earlier? About your hard work and research!” Harry’s stomach twisted. “Instead you just drugged a defenceless man and stole his life’s work then made it off as your own.”
After this the three set to unpacking everything, setting up chairs and sofas and blankets and tables and counters and kettles and beds and cabinets. The cottage finally appeared to be coming together, and Harry couldn’t be happier.
“I’m Harry, and this is Hermione.” He put his hand out towards Mia. She reached to shake it.
Harry flicked his eyes back to the dance floor to see that Malfoy was still grinding up against the man, except now he was standing up with one hand wrapped around the back of the man’s neck and the other reaching behind his own backside. Presumably to palm the other man’s cock. Harry felt his own erection fill a bit more at the view he now had.
Harry grabbed his wand and lit a small lumos on the tip before bending down beneath the bed.
After a few minutes of waiting, Cole walked over with a tray of food and drinks.
They stood silently staring at each other for a few seconds before the world around Draco came back to him. The dull thump in his ear swapping around to take in the sound of a roasting oven and bubbling pans.
But by the end of their visit, the two begrudgingly accepted that maybe,
Their conversation was interrupted by almost obnoxiously loud Christmas music blasting through from the Livingroom.
“They wouldn’t Malfoy.”
Harry’s question was quickly answered when a welcoming face appeared on the other side of the door.
“Harry?” Malfoy questioned, watching as Harry walked to the door.
“Do it! Do it! Do it!” A random voice began chanting, causing a chain reaction where within a few seconds the whole crowd were shouting “Do it!” in Harry’s direction. He could hardly think over the noise.
“So when are we leaving?” Harry asked.
“Fine, maybe I only noticed what you had for dessert.”
Harry felt like screaming out of frustration, he just knew today was too perfect, and of course Malfoy had to come in and ruin it. He’s not too sure what he’d expected to happen, but he should’ve known it’d be Malfoy. It's always Malfoy.
“Can we meet up again?” Tim asked. Draco felt his blood boil.
“Are you sure?”
This time when Ginny turned around, her eyes were round like a puppy’s.
of research. Like a lot.” Malfoy began, his eyes shifting along the room and his body language exaggerated. “There were
“First of all, I do not get jealous, secondly, that is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”
A knock on the door made Harry jump where he was standing.
“Sorry, what did you say?” Harry asked through misty eyes.
“Do you not recognise any of them?”
Which is how he found himself now sat on the living room floor with the radio on full volume and a (still incomplete) puzzle resting before him. He had reasoned -in desperation- that if he played music loud enough, he wouldn’t be able to hear these ridiculous, incessant thoughts. However, Harry’s antics appeared to be driving a heavily pregnant (and hormonal) Hermione Granger to madness.
“Because leaving him has obviously put you in a lot of pain.” Harry felt his own eyes roll. “I just thought that maybe you should give him a chance. He obviously made you happy.” She began and Harry felt some small little thread inside him break.
“Don’t get too ahead of yourself Harry!” Draco turned back around to the bed; Harry was suddenly aware of what must’ve been ten bags of shopping on there.
Malfoy had always excelled in anything he did back at school, and Harry could now easily confirm that that fact had not changed at all. Except, now he seemed to be excelling in making Harry the hardest he’d ever been.
Harry shot his eyes back to the table, feeling his own stomach tying knots in and around itself. He hadn’t felt like this since he was a teenager. It was enough to make him want to throw up. He took a deep breath and let himself glance up again.
“I wasn’t expecting to see you here.” Malfoy began, ignoring Cole.
“And you thought hooking up with someone else would make you feel better?”
“Umm…. Unless you want to go to bed wearing jeans, I’m afraid that’s the best you get.”
He would do the same if he were her.
“Malfoy, that’s brilliant!”
“Right… And have you made any attempt to get back home?”
“For you, Harry.” She explained, “Anyways, they’re normally more fun than straight clubs. Less grimy men feeling you up.” Harry nodded in understanding, even if he felt a bit naïve for asking in the first place. “So, we better get going then.” Ginny prompted.
“Yeah… I’m ready.” Harry answered, looking into Draco’s eyes and seeing that same tangled look of lust, filled with a nurturing glaze that Harry had remembered from last time. Draco pulled his fingers out and shifted, lying with his full weight on top of Harry, groin pressed to groin and chest on chest, until he was staring just as deeply as before at Harry’s eyes.
He glanced over the front page when one article caught his eyes.
His eyebrows furrowed.
“Oh… Yeah.”
He shook his head.
“Oh merlin. Malfoy, I would accept defeat now and just not go if I were you.”
Then it hit Draco. The severity of what he’d just done.
His whole body bristled as he heard Malfoy begin to stir.
Malfoy took a step closer to the gate and sighed.
“Do you like both equally?” Harry asked, pulling out the chair opposite her and taking a seat.
“Oh Merlin, sorry, Malfoy.” Harry shuffled above the covers and attempted to get over Malfoy and off the bed.
Why was it there?
“Most of the time.”
. Now Malfoy was really asking something. Harry had always slept in his underwear, he’d never had the need for pyjamas, but he definitely didn’t want to be bare next to Malfoy. His cheeks painted pink at the thought of it.
“Hello there, take a seat.” Harry introduced the customer, who currently housed an overgrown mullet. “What can I do for you today?” Harry asked, taking a step back and looking at his customer through the mirror, his eyes dipped slightly to the button-up floral shirt, which had a dangerous number of buttons undone, exposing half the man’s chest.
“I would hope so.” Harry looked just as nervous as Draco, worriedly squeezing his lip between his thumb and forefinger. “As long as you don’t run away screaming afterwards.”
“Oooooh Pancakes.” Harry observed. Hermione turned to look at her creations.
“It’s really busy!” Harry shouted over the loud music; Ginny took a second to understand what he’d said.
“You know I want this, you remember truth or dare.”
“That’s not my problem, Malfoy.”
“Get me my tea, slave.”
Did Draco think of Harry as more than a client?
“I’m sorry! I’ve had a lot of work.”
“Would you like some tea?” Malfoy asked, twisting his fingers in endless knots.
“Bloody hell, Harry.” Malfoy mumbled, his eyes glazed over as he thrusted his fingers into Harry’s mouth.
Now how did you even paint?
“You were perfect.” Harry leant forward and pressed his lips to Draco in a loving peck that made Draco’s heart sore. “For a virgin.”
, Cole didn’t actually want to know how Harry felt, he just wanted a gossip update.
“No.” Malfoy refused. “Go buy some.”
“No, Harry. I’m sorry but, I have some paperwork to finish.” Malfoy lifted his hand to Harry’s jaw and ran his thumb along the bone.
“What was that?” Harry asked, brushing his nose against Malfoy’s and listening out for a second hitch in the blond’s breath.
The blond suddenly chucked his head back, shaping his mouth as if he were letting out a loud moan. Harry felt his cock twitch again. Malfoy’s head bent back down to meet Harry’s gaze before running his eyes across the small amount of Harry’s body that was visible over the table. He bit his lip. Malfoy moved the hand that was fondling the other man’s cock to the small tent that was now forming in Malfoy’s own pants. Malfoy rocked his hips into his own hand and Harry could’ve sworn he felt some drool pool out of his mouth.
“I know it was wrong.”
He reached into his pocket for his wand, instead pulling out two halves of the wood.
“You’d better take your shot to get rid of the taste.”
Harry half heartedly pushed Malfoy away, doing nothing more than disconnecting his lips for half a second before they returned to Harry’s neck.
“Then let me leave.”
“How rude! Is it not completely obvious that I made it all!” Harry announced, putting his hand flamboyantly on his chest. “Well, everything apart from the pastries, I ran downstairs to your café to get them.”
“Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck.” Harry gurgled as Malfoy moaned around Harry’s erection, almost as if he likes it. Malfoy lifted up furthur to tease Harry so that the only thing touching Harry’s dick was the occasional kitten lick of his tongue.
“What about the toilet, Harry?”
“So, how’s your week been going, anything interesting?” She asked.
“What, where?”
Harry diverted his eyes to another direction to see a dirty-blond head in the crowd. This man was a bit more feminine than the others. He wore pink eyeliner and mascara on his lids and his cheeks appeared to be glowing. Harry thought the boy was stunning but also definitely not his type. Harry preferred a more masculine looking guy.
“We should head over to your house, I’ve got a few things to put up in the basement.” Malfoy explained, chugging his coffee down.
A smile lit up Harry’s lips.
“I’ll have the Treacle Temptation Tart, please.”
“I have no one to blame but myself for that really. I was very close to my Grandfather and when he passed on, I couldn’t bring myself to come back here. Brought back too many memories. Then we had that massive storm about ten years ago, it made all the ponds overflow and turned it into a marshland. When I came back to check on the property five years ago, I was horrified to see the state it had gotten into.” She finished pouring the tea and handed them to Harry and Hermione.
“Do you need a new pair of glasses? How can you not see how similar you look?” Lily’s smile filled her whole face as she turned back to Harry. “You see it, don’t you?”
“Obviously, I can get there on my own, I just thought you might need my help to get over there.” Draco justified, offering his hand out for Harry to grip onto. Harry snickered at the small stumble Draco made just to unfold his hand.
“Definitely.” Draco answered immediately. “He would’ve still liked me for what I was. We would’ve gotten around it. But I guess I just never felt good enough for him. He was always such a great guy. I mean everywhere he went; everyone would just be in awe of him… And it’s hard to stand by someone’s arm when you feel like you don’t even deserve to crawl next to them.”
“Bye Harry.” Ron waved, walking out of the kitchen. “Have fun!”
“May Dobby ask you name, sir?” Harry felt like crying at the elves voice.
Harry just replied with a strained smile.
Suddenly, his glasses gave up holding onto his face and they slipped off down to the ground, choosing to rest next to the bed.
“Thought I would come out a bit early, talk to you for a bit.”
Draco shook his head and stepped around Harry into the flat.
“What teas do I have?”
They tried again and easily lifted the furniture up, slightly surprising the two delivery men who’d stopped to watch.
“Holy shit.” Draco muttered, reaching his other hand into the bin.
“and he’s just as much of an arsehole as he always was.”
In just under two hours he would be meeting Malfoy at his house.
Malfoy accepted Harry’s reasoning with a small shrug.
“Okay, Fuck off, Draco.” Draco chucked his head back with a laugh.
His room was dark, the only light coming from the street outside. It felt almost inappropriate to turn the lights in his room on at this hour in the morning. He felt a shiver run up his spine, his room definitely wasn’t this cold when he’d left.
“Of course.” The small girl shuffled over to let them past. Harry was marginally surprised by the good order of the interior of the house. There appeared to be no damp smell and the walls seemed to hold in some heat relatively well. However, that didn’t hide the darkening walls and copious number of cobwebs around the hall. However, Harry persisted that there was nothing a lick of paint couldn’t fix.
“Like maybe, I don’t know, go clubbing?” She beamed. “There’s a really cool place that just opened up,”
“Not really, no.” He was surprised how clear his voice sounded.
Harry gulped.
Harry looked around himself, he had some brushes set out and a palette. He’d even gone crazy and set up some painting knives, not that he knew how to use them.
Then Harry freezes.
The blond stepped out of the bathroom, the shirt hit just above Malfoy’s hip, like Harry had thought, but his eyes were instantly drawn to the bulge just below the hem of the shirt. Harry quickly averted his eyes and turned around, hoping that Malfoy didn’t catch him eying up his crotch.
“Do I have to get dressed?” Malfoy moaned.
But, Draco Malfoy is gay… and Harry is definitely… not
Harry paused his painful rolling and looked up to Draco, the worry on the blond’s face seemed like the funniest thing Harry had ever seen. He couldn’t help his laugh from escaping.
Then the living room.
“It seems the festivities have begun.” George fled passed Harry and Draco, Ron quickly following in his footsteps.
“I’m sorry.”
“Can you not just give it a bit of time here? I really don’t want to go back.” Harry suggested, watching as Malfoy rubbed his temples with his fingers.
Ginny, however, looked shockingly unperturbed by the outburst, her face settling on a curious expression.
“Why?” Harry furrowed his eyebrows.
Once they reached the end of the hall, Harry looked through one of the doors to see Narcissa’s pregnant form sat in the dining hall.
, one step into being an adult.
But then Malfoy smiled, crooked and deadly mischeivious, and lifted his finger to teasingly pull at his bottom lip.
Harry sighed. He needed to be sympathetic. He can hardly imagine he would’ve handled this information well when he first got here.
One week.
The two haphazardly skated towards the wooden floor, Harry a bit more gracefully that Malfoy.
He pulled one off of the wall and placed it on his stand.
He suddenly paused with his movements, causing Harry to thrust his hips up to create some. Draco moved both his hands to push Harry’s hips down and still, leaving Harry’s dick sprung up like a tower between them.
A cold chill ran over his body without warning when a memory flashed into his mind. He remembered how he’d jacked off in front of that door (which was enough to make his hands shake) but he was more worried about what he couldn’t remember. He never remembered cleaning up his spunk from the floor, but when Draco looked at the wooden floor now, there was no sign of the white liquid.
Harry dropped his hands back to his sides and now he could see that the light that was once gone had returned to Draco’s eyes.
“Maybe. What year are you trying to get back to?”
“Don’t worry, I will definitely not be brewing potions anytime soon.” Harry reassured, causing Hermione to flash him an amused smile. Whilst Harry did have immense respect for his old potions teacher, he had managed to make Harry resent even the thought of the subject.
“What?” He mumbled, squinting his eyes.
Harry felt his legs begin to shake.
“Where do you wanna go?” Malfoy gasped. “Bedroom, livingroom…”
3…2…1…
“And, what do you normally have clients pay?” Harry awkwardly stuttered.
Malfoy couldn’t hold back his shock, now shaking Harry by the shoulders. The movement didn’t have any effect on changing Harry’s mind.
Malfoy opened his mouth again to take him in. And he sink down… down.. down… his mouth wrapped around the root as he gives a soft hum of pleasure. Harry is breathless just watching it, the feeling of Malfoy’s hot, warm mouth stretched around him.
“Do you want another hug?” Malfoy asked, Harry wanted to punch himself.
“Oh Merlin save us-”
Harry blinked.
Harry couldn’t read the article anymore, his coffee cup discarded next to him, beginning to turn cold. Was this Malfoy’s way of showing that he regrets what he did?
“Okay then… well. It started in like a – I dunno – green-ish bedroom with velvet and… stuff.” Harry began, causing Malfoy to nod along. He swiftly moved his hand to rest his chin on, feigning far too much innocence for the conversation’s topic. “And I was shirtless… tied to a bed…with some rope…” Harry wanted the floor to swallow him up whole. Why couldn’t he be less awkward about sexual topics?
“It’s Draco.”
“Good.”
What do you all think about the Draco situation? Does it make sense? Did you expect it?
“I can show you some photos before we get there though, it may not be like what you’d expect.” He offered.
The two fingers twisted gently inside him, making him flinch a little bit when the same sensation hit him. The fingers rooting inside him were now surprisingly comfortable, warm and wet, moving smoothly. Now he was aware of Draco’s erection pressed against the inside of his thigh -he hadn’t even noticed that he’d taken his pants off at some point.
It was
Malfoy winced as the scratchy fabric touched his burn, but he quickly schooled his pained features.
How should he knock?
He glanced to his side to see golden, silk rope tying him up to the posters of the bed. He pulled against them, but they only got tighter, pulling his hands even further into the restraint.
“I think we best stick to cereal today.” Draco looked up, meeting Harry’s gaze for the first time that morning. It felt awkward. Harry’s mouth slid into a frown.
Draco panicked as he pulled himself up from the ground, his legs silently wobbling beneath him in objection.
“I’m sorry that these Christmas parties never end well for you.”
“No, they’re too hot and I need to dress them first.” Hermione warned. Harry chuckled as he imagined his stack of pancakes wearing a tiny, little dress. “I’ll go get you the house folder whilst they cool down.”
“Of course I’m not serious, Harry.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Meanwhile, I was expecting to have your cock in my arse by this point so can we leave the small talk for later.”
“I’m Draco Malfoy, and I need to speak to my Father.” Narcissa opened the door further, showing her pregnant stomach.
“I haven’t.” Harry felt guilt build beneath his skin at his failed attempt of a one night stand.
“Thank god, I’m starved.” Ron praised.
Her eyes skimmed through them without a question, but that didn’t stop her eyebrows beginning to furrow after a few seconds.
“My friend Mia might be, but I think it’ll probably just be me.” Malfoy finally pulled his fingers away from Harry’s nipples and stoodup away from the bed. Harry pretended he didn’t see how obvious Malfoy’s erection was in his trousers.
“Painting?” Malfoy questioned, settling his cup tantalisingly close to his crotch. Draco didn’t ignore the way Harry’s eyes followed his mug.
A loud crash from across the street pulled him out of his thoughts. He paused in his cutting to look out of the window.
“Shall we try again? But no falling over this time.” Harry suggested, placing his own hand on top of the one Draco had rested on his knee. Draco only seemed to become aware of where his hand was in that moment.
Harry moved over to his hair dressing station and caught sight of himself in the mirror. God, he looked a state.
Harry looked around himself. He didn’t actually know how to get out of Malfoy’s house. He didn’t even know where this bedroom was. But he did know that the mattress beneath him felt like a cloud and that his eyes must’ve had weights draping them shut.
“What’s your name?” Harry asked.
“Okay?” Ginny asked, patting him on the back.
“Well, I obviously wouldn’t let my clients blindly pay for me without having a preview, would I?” He lifted the globe and passed it to Harry, it was surprisingly light. “When you’re ready, all you need to do is tap your wand on the orb and it will show you the preview, it’s very simple really.” The man explained, quickly walking past Harry and down the staircase.
“Yeah.”
“It’s really not a good idea to fuck your tenant.”
When they pulled away, Malfoy was watching him with deep, longing eyes once again.
“Of course not, at least now people won’t be quite so surprised when I tell them that your down in my basement.” A smile lit up Malfoy’s face.
“No, it’s only a five-minute walk away, and I want to see what the Christmas decorations look like in town.” Ginny informed him, Harry replied with a quick nod and chucked his coat on.
How Harry had ever found him attractive, he didn’t know.
The blond moved his hand behind Harry’s back and slowly began shoving him out of the door.
Draco stood in front of their dinner table and looked over it. There were stacks of pastries on one side, filled with custard and cream. There was one large pot of coffee in the centre of the table and a pile of pancakes, topped with butter and syrup next to it. He glanced up to where Harry stood to see that next to the Gryffindor were two plates filled with hash browns, beans, scrambled eggs, sausages, toast, tomatoes, bacon and finally, the fried eggs that Harry gracefully placed on top.
“Partners in crime.” George shouted out from the opposite end of the circle.
Harry could hardly look away as Malfoy curved his back against him, pushing his arse into the other man’s crotch. Malfoy began softly bending forward, slowly grinding his back side into the man’s prick. The other man stared down at the crook of Malfoy’s back, almost hypnotised by the rhythmic movements of the blond in his hands.
“Apart from that stupid puzzle.” Her hands reached down to three of the puzzle pieces as she picked them up and swiftly clicked them into the correct places on the board.
“Fine. I’ll help you get home. But I’m staying here.”
Also, we're getting scarily close to the end of this fic, it almost makes me emotional :'(
“Anyone would think you’re sex craved, Draco.” Harry commented, attempting to ignore how appealing the sound of sex with Draco was.
Draco grinned.
Harry mildly began to grind down, the heavy weight of their dicks pressed against each other heating Harry’s face. Malfoy let out a whimper beneath him.
“Um.. So,” Harry coughed, “do you want left or right side?”
The were both breathing in short pants, their hands gripping onto each other’s. Harry stood, dragging Draco up with him as they walked hand in hand to the staircase. They descended slowly, almost as if they were scared for what was about to happen, but by the time they reached the bottom, Harry was punched with a wave of emotion.
“Harry?”
“Are yer sure, I ‘ad a lotta plans for us-”
“What?” The owl calmly lifted it’s leg up and towards Harry. Harry glared at the blasted thing whilst he untied the note from its leg.
“I really don’t think we should talk about the future too much.” Harry jumped in; Malfoy gave him a thankful glance. “More things to obliviate.”
Harry was amazed at the bathroom, there was a large jacuzzie-esque bath in the corner, with a shower on the other side of the room. Both were large and slightly too on the luxurious side for Harry but, he supposed he would have to spoil himself with something. Although he did still need to call the plumbers to fit everything up to the water supply. So perhaps he would still be showering at Ron and Hermione’s for a while.
The first few months he was here, he’d attempted to look for the man, despite his dislike of him. He was so desperate to see a familiar face, he would’ve done anything to find him. But alas, Malfoy was no where to be found.
“Bye.”
“Erghhh, that’s mank.” One exclaimed, much to the amusement of Harry.
Harry nodded.
Which left Harry where he was now.
After five minutes of an endless internal debate, Harry realised what he was doing and wanted to slap himself silly.
“I thought you said you’ve done this before?”
“Thank you …” Draco swiftly turned back again, “What’s your name? I don’t think I ever asked.”
Draco’s breathing was harsh as he laid next to Harry, and when he turned his eyes to meet Harry’s, Harry felt like crying all over again.
“Hungry?” Draco laughed.
“I am!” His shout left silence in the room for a few seconds before his sighed, and in a weaker voice, he continued.
“Oh well. I’ve got another date tonight. Hopefully he’s alright.”
Harry’s heart sunk like a rock.
“It’s stupid.” Harry replied, suddenly insecure at how vulnerable he felt.
“Jesus fucking Christ, Draco.” Harry cursed, before bending down against Draco until his own face was level to Draco’s arsehole, his eyes watching from an inch away.
“How exciting!” Cole interrupted again. “If we all know each other, let’s forget about trivial greetings, how about we get straight to partying?” Harry was now extremely thankful that Cole was here in order to alleviate any tension between the two groups.
Harry rolled his eyes and stuffed another cherry tomato between his lips.
“You know what… Last night.”
“Sorry.” He swiftly raised his hand and twizzled the knob of the radio to put the volume down.
Instead, he had chucked it all away, he had fallen out of love, realised he was in fact - not straight and had forgotten all the plans he had made in the process. And what great plans they were.
Harry felt his throat dry up. Ginny had never done anything like this.
Malfoy’s lips worked on Harry’s neck whilst his hands fiddled with his nipples. Flicking over the peaked nibs again and again, making them stand up hard. Harry was sure he could come just from this as he became aware that he was a moaning mess beneath Malfoy, whispering an incoherent string of appreciative mumbles.
Harry just showed her another strained smile.
“I still have no idea what the hell is going on, Potter, and I’d like to know.”
“Just because I’m gay doesn’t mean I’ll go out with Seamus.” Hermione rolled her eyes.
Malfoy whispered another spell, and suddenly Harry’s underwear had disappeared.
– Harry liked Draco back!
I haven't written anything for a while, but I've had this saved on my laptop forever and never ended up posting it.
Across the table from him was an older looking man -
“What? How?”
The stranger winked at Harry.
“Who are you trying to- Ah!” Harry grabbed Draco’s arm to pull him down to the chair opposite.
“Of course you don’t.”
“Don’t be so boring Harry. We’re young!” She removed her hand to forage in her hand bag, before pulling out a small bottle of what Harry assumed to be muggle whiskey. “Drink some of this, all your worries will just slip away.”
!” Harry exclaimed; mouth agape as he slammed his hand down onto Kingsley’s desk.
So, this is the introduction, it is far shorter than a normal chapter so don't worry, upcoming updates are far more substantial.
“Because I’m straight, Harry.”
Draco had given him a list of items that were meant to be in each box, Harry was to tick them off once he found them. It was extremely time consuming, to say the least. He didn’t really see the point of it, after three boxes of ingredients, you’d imagine Draco would figure that whoever had robbed him hadn’t touched the ingredients. Especially when they were all left in pristine condition and in the correct place.
“You remember Pansy and Blaise, right Potter?” Malfoy asked, waving a hand backwards to his friends.
“I have… Obviously.” Harry scratched his head, feigning nonchalance.  Which was quite a difficult task when his flaccid cock was hanging out of his zipper right in Alex’s face. “I just, it’s a bit dirty.”
With that
“Of course not.”
The view from it was insane, fields stretched beyond him for what seemed like miles, with a few lakes intertwined in the rolling hills. He could see the entirety of the garden from this space -while it was not a very pretty garden- the view of this amount of land still seemed amazing to Harry.
“But I want to learn.” The soft pad of Harry’s thumb brushed over the V of Draco’s hips.
Harry wrapped his own fingers over Malfoy’s hands and pushed on the skin slightly. Pushing the butt plug in deeper.
“Oh.”
The other man’s hands gripped onto Malfoy’s backside and squeezed into the muscle, making Malfoy’s hips jut forwards. Swiftly, the man reached into his own pocket and pulled out a large wad of ten-pound notes that he easily transferred into Malfoy’s back pocket. Immediately, Malfoy grabbed the man’s arm and began to tug him in the direction of the toilets. Harry watched in fascination as the man followed Malfoy, his eyes glazed over.
Malfoy’s cock was flushed and pink and very, very hard. It strained up towards the ceiling, standing so tall that Draco almost had the nerve to feel embarrassed.
Draco shrugged his shoulders in response, a small smirk residing on his lips. “Well, I haven’t had sex since you left, maybe I am.”
“Hey! I thought it was legit.” Harry defended, glaring at Cole.
“Hey Draco. What do you want then?” She smiled broadly.
“But then how have you- oh.” The realisation ran over Harry’s face. “You mean you’ve… fingered yourself before?”
As soon as the two boys stepped out of the floo into their own apartment, Harry was back on Draco like wildfire, pushing him against the wall next to the fireplace.
“Is Mae there?”
“I just… Are you not… A couple?”
Draco immediately retracted all the good things he had said about Damien before.
“Thank you.” He showed her one of his billion dollar smile with sparkly eyes. In return, she raised her mug to Draco and sent a nod his way.
“Huh?”
“What, really?”
“No, he deserves far worse.”
“What?” Harry thought about denying it but he couldn’t lie to Ginny. Not even if he tried. “How’d you know?”
Sometimes Draco wondered how he knew more about muggle life than Harry. Draco had prized himself on quite how self-sufficient he was. After the war, he couldn’t bear to live in the Mansion off of Lucius’ money, the idea of that almost made him sick. So, he’d left them and moved into the muggle centre of London. It’s taken a long time – and a lot of confusing trips on the underground – but he’d eventually adjusted. Harry, however, was useless at living on his own. He burnt just about everything; Draco was sure that Harry would be dead by now without him.
Harry scoffed. “Out of us two, I’m the mature one, okay?”
“It’s okay, Harry.”
“Bye.” Cole said, slightly too enthusiastically.
He unpinned the canvas from where it was hanging and chucked the unfinished piece onto his easel and watched it now from afar, his sadness swapping for anger.
Harry moved to look out of the window. The pub was situated in a town centre where there was a large group of men setting up some Christmas decorations. Suddenly, Harry noticed the soft Christmas music playing in the pub. He did think it was a bit early to be playing Christmas music but, he enjoyed Christmas well enough that it didn’t bother him, instead he began quietly humming along with the more recognisable songs.
Harry just smiled back at her.
“You’re not wrong!” Catherine laughed, chucking her head back.
Harry closed his eyes. Maybe if he just pretended it wasn’t Alex, he could do this. He imagined the hands as not being there, Alex’s groin instead being the plump mattress of Harry’s bed.
“Side-along me?” Draco asked.
“So are you.” Draco explained, absentmindedly fiddling with his own nipples. “I don’t need prep; you can just go straight in now.”
But Merlin was the curiosity in his bones tingling with a need to look under the bed.
Harry let his body settle further and emptied his brain, think of random nothings as his body drifted into sleep.
“Yes, that sounds… Wonderful.” He took a sip of his suddenly bitter coffee.
“So, did you get the milk?” Malfoy asked.
They had both decided to rest with each other on the couch. Malfoy lazily resting his legs on Harry’s lap, laying his head down on the armrest. Harry seated his cup down on Malfoy’s ankles. His legs were far too long for the couch, so his feet drifted off the other armrest, dangling above the floor.
“And not a window.”
“A hot chocolate and an americano, please.” Her smile deepened.
Harry stared at the mirror, self-evaluating every inch of his clothing. He really hadn’t left the house much in the past few months and it led him to forget how to dress in anything other than pyjamas.
“I’m not doing that again.” Draco shivered.
“I think I’ll be fine.”
“Don’t be so boring Potter.” She started.
“Nope. Almost died.”
“Just one more thing.” Malfoy paused, making Harry chuck his head back in exasperation. “My names not Malfoy, it’s Draco.” He announced, Harry could hardly believe his ears. He could however feel how hard his dick was and how much he just needed Malf- Draco to get on with it. So he just nodded in reply until Draco seemed content enough.
Draco felt a bead of sweat on his forehead.
“Hopefully you’ll be back to him soon.”
He went back to his table and sat the Prophet down in the centre. He didn’t have the paper delivered, he hated reading it. Someone had to of sent it to Harry.
Draco took the two plates over to the table and placed one in front of Harry and the other in his own space. Draco chuckled at Harry’s expression.
It smelt like oak and peaches, making goosebumps raise on his back.
Harry growled and pulled at Draco’s hair, he kissed him whilst Draco’s hand stroked up and down Harry’s erection, slightly restrained by the fabric covering it. Harry pulled at Draco’s hair again and spun them so that now Draco was pushed up against the wall. He kissed him once more, hands pinning Draco to the concrete as he thrust into Draco’s hand, until suddenly Draco withdrew all contact and almost pushed Harry backwards.
“Harry, truth or dare.” Harry had no idea who’d even asked him the question when he looked back into the circle. He really needed to pay more attention.
“Fuck!” They screamed in unison, clutching their foreheads in pain. Harry collapsed down onto Draco, making the man squeak out like a dog toy. He swiftly rolled off him onto the floor.
Draco sighed.
“They will. They were made hundreds of years ago.”
“Malfoy, can you make a coffee, quickly?”
“You really are something special.” Harry announced, watching Draco with a strange glimmer in his eye.
Harry in Draco’s house right now, making him laugh about his dirty talk?
Harry turned his head to see the white blond head walk through the door. His stomach exploded with butterflies.
“Plebeian? Oh, not the time. Look, he’s seen me.” Draco began turning his head. “Actually, don’t look! Just keep looking at me.” Draco turned back around. “Plus, he was-” Harry pulled his hand up and made a very crude sign that Draco presumed to be reference to the lack of length of this man’s certain appendage.
Harry looked to his Dad, it felt like looking in a mirror.
Harry walked back into the cottage, careful to not drag any mud through the hallway.
“I hope so.”
be able to tell otherwise.
There were a few ponds spread out across the green with some stone statues dispersed near them.
This is the end dun dun DUN
Now he picked up a steely grey, one that swam with hints of blue and splatted again, similarly to the black dots. But this time, instead of random swoops of colour, they somehow looked more like teardrops against the green. On a few of the drops, a black swoop would outline them, resembling dark eyelashes wrapped around cold eyes.
Excitement bubbled up in Harry’s heart as a sudden missing of Molly struck him. He quickly turned around and the excitement in his heart plummeted into a stone cold lake.
There was no response.
So that’s why he was so not-awkward.
She placed it out on the counter in front of Harry, he smiled at her and reached into the cupboards to pull out two shot glasses.
He read over the letter again, and again, and a fourth time just to be sure. He didn’t even know what to think. He wasn’t angry at Draco anymore, he knew that. If anything, Harry was ready to go back to Draco.
“Actually, my colleague here showed up two and a half years before me.” Draco explained.
“He’s been a bit sombre lately.”
“Are you okay with bottoming then?” Alex asked.
“Merlin, that’s quite the jump.” Harry wasn’t comforted by the panicked look on his face.
Harry’s orgasm lasted for what felt like minutes, he was sure he’d blacked out. He couldn’t even remember what had happened until he looked up to find himself calmly lying next to Malfoy, an echo of his orgasm trembling endlessly in his thighs.
He gulped.
Harry looked up at Malfoy to the blond looking at him with an inquisitive stare. “You okay?”
“Oh Merlin, I love this song!” He announced to Draco’s blank face, Draco lifted an eyebrow in return. “Don’t tell me you don’t know this song?”
It was hard for him to not just rip the fabric in two and come in his pants like a teenager, but he knew that this time, they needed to go slow. So, he shivered as Draco’s hands ran over him and by the time he had half-way undone Draco’s shirt, Draco mumbled against him.
Luckily enough, Hermine had only gone shopping yesterday so Harry could easily pull together two ham sandwiches for himself. He calmly plonked down onto the kitchen chairs and began devouring the food.
“Come on, mate. Don’t be such a tease, you can’t bring me all this way just to bail out.”
“Thank you, Harry.” She stood up from the table. “Would you like a tour of the house?” She asked, Harry practically jumped up at the opportunity to see the property.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, budging closer to Hermione.
“Look at that Harry, maybe you’ve got more in common than we’d first thought!” Ron joked, pointing to the photo Harry was just looking at. Harry stared back at the photo, wondering what Ron was talking about.
“Do you think we ever could’ve been friends?” He asked, unable to meet Harry’s eyes.
“Hey! Hands off.” Draco snatched it back. “What is this doing in the bin?” He dangled the watch from it’s chain, watching as it slowly span around.
I hope you liked it, leave your thoughts in the comments, I'll try to reply to questions and stuff.
“Is everything okay?” Harry asked, looking down to his own manhood, becoming slightly insecure.
Harry proceeded to have this internal argument with his mind for the remaining duration of his walk.
“Then how about Ginny?”
Whilst the largeness of the room made Draco’s lab look very small, it was beginning to come together. There were countless bottles arranged along wooden planks that had been screwed into the concrete wall. Four cauldrons were centred on a worktable in the middle of the room, enough workspace around them to make the mixing easy. A large array of mixing rods were hung up on the wall and Harry was sure that it wouldn’t be long before Malfoy would start brewing his own new potion.
However, that only lasted fifteen seconds before his mind was swamped once again.
“Pull those pants down to your knees.” Draco instructed, Harry moved the fabric down, taken aback by the sight of Draco stood above him, stroking his cock up and down, watching Harry.
“Did it work? Did you get away?” Harry asked, ignoring how his voice wavered.
Poor Draco :(
“No. I think I like it open.” Malfoy froze where he was standing, a small gasp fell from his lips.
been a one hundred piece puzzle, but at least he was trying to do something productive with his time. Only two weeks ago he had done nothing except slouch around on Ron and Hermione’s couch watching repeats of old cooking shows.
Harry and Mia stayed in a still silence for a few seconds before meeting eyes and shaking their heads in unison, with a small chuckle.
“Yeah, sure. You can just buy me a drink at the club.” She grinned; Harry smiled back at her.
“Can you let go?” Harry squealed out. She immediately released her grip, making Harry take in a big gulp of air.
He tucked the pieces away into his pocket for safe keeping, he’d need to bring them back for examination.
“Your order?” Cole reminded, causing Harry to awkwardly backtrack a few steps to the counter. He let out and awkward chuckle before asking for a white coffee and a lemon tart.
“How long have you done this for?”
“I can recognise one of my own.” He joked. “Can’t explain why, I can just feel it.”
Draco sighed in acceptance.
“Draco?” Malfoy interrupted, meeting Harry with wide eyes. “Since when did you call me Draco?”
Harry had kept the spare bedroom fairly sparse as well, nothing more than a white bed and a bed side cabinet. He wasn’t likely to have many people staying round anytime soon.
The Gryffindor pushed himself up from the bench and promptly skated onto the rink floor. He’d been skating a ton of times with Ginny, although, he remembered how difficult he had found it when he’d first tried, and how Ginny had watched him flounder about trying to get to the skating floor.
“How’s the research going Harry?” Hermione’s voice interrupted. She strolled through the door of the cottage; her black overalls now stained with flickers of white.
Malfoy was still stuck in a daze staring at Harry’s dick. In an attempt to get Malfoy out of it, Harry moved his own hand to wrap around the base of his erection and slowly stroked up, making a gasp fall from his lips.
“It landed on you.” She replied, Harry felt butterflies spur from his belly at her words.
But then it shot up again, and again. Harry attempted to move slightly to see the face of the bobbing head. It almost appeared as if the crowd had parted specially just to give Harry a view of Malfoy’s face bopping up and down, eyes searching for someone who might be interested. Harry could hardly look away.
“Again, it’s not your fault Harry.” Cole comforted, Harry felt like this was the wrong way around, surely he should be comforting Cole. “But, that leads us up to the present day, he still comes to visit me once a week, we go to the same parties, other than that we’re just friends.”
Whilst, according to the Auror handbook, Harry should really conduct about five more checks, these cases usually turned out to be nothing, and he didn’t really want to waste the time and effort on them. Especially with the pressure of Malfoy’s eyes carving a hole into his back.
Draco Malfoy trying to impress Harry Potter with his toned midriff. How
“I’m sorry to hear that Cole.”
“I thought you hated me.”
Draco hadn’t woken up yet, and Harry couldn’t bring himself to wake the blond. Their legs had gotten wrapped up together during the night, and whilst Harry should definitely take his legs away, feeling another person’s bare skin against his own was… nice.
“Hello, Mummy.” Draco greeted, she turned around and upon meeting Draco’s eyes, a large smile casted across her face.
“What’s wrong Harry?” Ginny asked, noticing the atmosphere change. She moved a hand over the low table to rub Harry’s knee.
“You’re perfect, Draco.” Harry whispered, pushing his lips down to meet Draco’s, still wet with saliva. Now when Draco kissed Harry, it didn’t taste as much like Harry, it tasted like something new. A musky taste, almost metallic in flavour. It hit Draco that in that moment, he was tasting himself on Harry’s tongue, he should be disgusted, he really should, but instead his hands found themselves gripping onto the strong muscles of Harry’s arse.
A grimace adorned Draco’s face.
With this image, Harry could now arch his back against the man and lean forward, showing his back off to him. Harry didn’t even protest when Draco’s hand found it’s way to palm Harry’s hardening dick.
Harry was sure his lungs had stopped working; he could feel the water works turning back on.
He felt no lift of elation, his heart beat stuck as the same monotonous beat, his stomach didn’t twist and if anything he just felt a bit awkward.
“What did the sandwich ever do to you?” Draco asked, Harry was glaring daggers at the sandwich. Maybe it’s because he’d used wholemeal bread instead of white. Harry liked white bread.
“I’ll show you it, soon… I just need to… make some changes to it.” Malfoy explained, his eyes darting everywhere but Harry.
Harry and Ginny began their walk to the large oak door and swung it open, to reveal a small hanging room for jackets and then a slightly thinner set of grey doors. They swiftly walked through the smaller doors to see old-looking, wooden flooring and dangling lights from the ceiling.
“…and what are you planning we do?”
“This house hits temperatures colder than the arctic at night, of course I want to.”
Malfoy left Harry lying on the edge of the bed as he shuffled off of it. Kneeling between Harry’s legs on the floor.
He picked up another bottle of cologne and read the label
Harry smiled fondly at the man, he looked through the reflection of the mirror to see Malfoy sat on his chair with his arms firmly crossed and a light red flush on his face.
“Fuck Malfoy, you’ve got such a sweet arse.” Harry thrusts in harder. “You like me fucking you?” He’s not even aware of his words as they come out. “Fucking your pretty arse, you like it rough, don’t you?”
“And then they just left me there. It was horrible.” Mia rambled on about some date or something whilst Harry watched his biscuit soak up the tea from his cup.
“I mean, I’ve never asked.” Harry looked to where Draco had just left the room. “Why? Do you think he’s gay?”
Harry stalled in his reply.
“Oh?” Draco replied, not trusting his voice to speak.
“What song?”
“Fucking Merlin!” Malfoy screamed again, his leg shaking on Harry’s shoulder.
Harry’s face suddenly fell.
“I’ll stay here. You go show me something.” Draco gripped tighter onto the bar, his skates slipping from beneath him another time, but he was far quicker to recover this time round.
