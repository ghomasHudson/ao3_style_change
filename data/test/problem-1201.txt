Harry smiled, his hands sliding down to caress his inner thighs and Draco moaned, his eyes closing, "D-daddy"
Dracy gasped when she saw a tear rolling out of his eyes. It broke her heart to see Harry in such a state. She pulled him to her chest and shushed him. He’s strong. He’s definitely strong for holding for too long.
She walked into it and smiled when the man gently pulled him into his lap before leaning his head down and cooing at her tummy, “Hello, bunny. How are ‘ya?”
He yelped when he was slammed at the car, his ass hitting the car door handle. He tilted his chin up and sweating profusely at the expression on his face.
This pregnancy thing is not what he anticipated when he started this, this whatever it is. Impregnating an omega is surely what he doesn’t have in mind when he brought her to her house.
“Night, daddy” he vaguely heard Draco whispered as he hugged the boy by the waist and took the smell of their aftersex into his sleep.
“The thing is we’re not those people before. You aren’t my Slytherin. You’re my Phoenix. That’s what we are now, isn’t it?”
Fuck, he’s just swimming in. How is it even possible? Harry parted for a moment to remove his tie and his sleeves, letting Draco see a view of what he offers as well. All muscles and rigidness, all strength and power, all the possible stamina stacked in that body.
He saw how his eyes were stuck on his ass before sweeping it back up and it's thrilling. It's so good to see the obvious desire in those emerald eyes but trying so hard to hold back.
He’s one hell of a racer too. Like a speed of light. Dangerous but exciting. Intriguing and enticing. The lion tattoo that symbolizes his mark on his properties. One inked diagonally on his left pec that goes to his shoulder to a part on his back and the ones painted on his biker gang.
For the second day, he really did convince himself that Harry just have something very crucial to do. He convinced himself that because Harry Potter is the Head Auror, surprising disappearance like this meant emergencies he need to deal with asap.
"We'll leave our son in your hands, Harry" Narcissa spoke gracefully and she gave him a small smile which he returned easily and nodding, "Expect a good guard, Mrs. Malfoy"
“Ssh” Harry shushed her, hands trying to soothe her as he let the woman cry on his shoulder, “I wanted to make you smile, baby. Not cry”
“Fuck me” she begged, whimpered when Harry grabbed the base of his cock and rubbing the tip across her labia, “My name, tiger. Say my fucking name” he growled.
Her giggle rang all throughout the library as they settled themselves on the settee, with her sitting between his legs and holding a book Harry told her to pick.
Distressed of where she could be, he proceeded to go inside his bedroom to change clothes but as he stepped inside, he stopped at the doorway upon seeing someone that should not be in any way inside his room!
It's early to be thinking these, he can say that, but Draco is nothing but a decisive Malfoy heir. He knows his goals and his wants with a single thought. He smirked and hummed playfully.
It was Harry who proved him he wasn’t the freak he thought he was for desiring to be someone rather than be someone his birth dictated him to. He was so accustomed with sneering that he had problems smiling at Harry at first.
He pulled her to the kitchen and led her to sit at one of the dining chair before he got to his own thing. He pulled ingredients out and began to peel and slice. Dracy watched him as he cooks. Harry is cooking for her. Such a nice and sweet gesture.
Harry had never met Dracy before until last week but he’d met Lucius quite dozen of times. Ministry balls, Wizengamot meetings, conferences with other high-ranking officials, and business meetings Harry always turned down.
Harry took hold of his wrist and put it on his shirt for Draco to grip on as they walked inside. Immediately hearing the noises, smelling the smoke and alcohol and the chaos that is the dance floor.
But it was hard. Either Tom is just that good or he was really innocent or he’s aware of who they are and hiding what he do in the dark.
Dracy had a little thought to mind the gossip but Harry was squeezing her waist, pinching every minute as if to calm and comfort her. From his touch, she can feel how rigid his stance has become and the sound of his jaw ticking.
Her heart gave a tug and she breathed heavily for a few times. Thoughtfulness is not something she had expected from him.
"Draco" Lucius called his name and Draco stood up, approaching him and offered his hand, "N-nice to meet you, Mr. Potter" he ignored the way he stuttered and gulped. He's still a few considerable inches away from him but he can very much see how broad and muscled he is. Can easily yank his lithe form and have him buried in his chest.
The  baby growing inside her is something that’s also helping them to move on from their pasts. One that brought him publicity and one that brought her shame. The baby will bring them another level to be the Wizarding world’s topic and he, for sure, is ready to face and deal with that. As long as he has the woman to come back to.
Her heart fluttered at the thoughts she was thinking as she tried her best to focus on the moment, to the man she choose to love.
He sighed and before he could dwell on it further, he heard the noisy roaring of motorbikes approaching the streets.
Harry inhaled and exhaled deeply. Reminding himself to remain calm. He didn’t speak and let the silence reign for a moment. Giving themselves an enough time to calm himself down.
Her hands began to caress Harry’s biceps as she pondered for whatever for a moment. She didn’t know what’s going to happen after this pregnancy but it’s still months away. What she needs to know is now.
This secret has ever been with him ever since he discovered what his sexuality really is. When he realized he doesn’t want a cunt. He wanted a cock even when he already possess one for his own. He wanted to feel a huge cock up in his ass, fill him up so good he forgets his own name. There used to be a time he wanted to be a woman because he thought that’s the only chance he can have his own boyfriend.
Draco bit his lips to control his insides. Why the hell is he acting so adorable? And mon chou? Really?
Harry winked, “Since you slapped me. You a hot doll, sugar. Makes me want to pound into you” he whispered so sexily and huskily Draco had to clench his thighs under the table to control himself.
It was only after a minute when Malfoy’s face contorted with confusion as he peek inside the cauldron. Curious as to what he was seeing, Harry mimicked the action and found that the supposed natural color of the potion have turned green with a tinge of red, glowing and bubbling furiously.
He stomped his feet on the pavement and weighed in enough questions to what’s happening in front of him. He clearly doesn’t know why his daddy is doing this and even if he does, he doesn’t like it.
A person whose name is loved by most, idolized by all, and had successfully garnered the mass media’s liking.
They were both shattered from their own stories. Dracy was hated that she suffered and Harry was so loved that he was caged within his own emotions. The public didn’t let them move on because they always ask and intruded.
When they reached a white door with a name plate at the center, OB Andy. The woman knocked on the door before a faint
Draco followed even when he wanted to lick his abdomen way up to his rigid pecs. He sighed softly loving the feeling of soft silk beneath him.
For the next moments, she was blushing as they eat their foods and blushing even more—something she didn’t know she’s capable of— at the way Harry fed her with a smile, doing his best to really ignore the eyes that she’s sure was watching them.
Harry’s eyes widened, thinking he’d done something wrong but Draco simply pushed him into the chair and straddled him, “Can’t wait, Harry. Need you” he cried, grabbing his cock and the small bottle of lube.
When they began to eat, he noticed that Dracy was about to speak but he beat her up to it and opened his mouth, “Anyway, my friend’s are coming”
Draco raised an eyebrow. That isn't what he wants to see right now. He played with his fingers around his hair and boldly stepped forward, minding the way his hips sway enticingly side to side, his steps languid as his heels clacked to the floor, “You can very well do things to me—I mean, for me, Senator” he winked, leaning on the desk,
Harry’s voice last night have told him he would make sure they would talk. He has to listen. He can see there’s no bad blood between them and it’s making him feel even worse.
“C’mon! Please?” he fluttered his eyelids and tightened his hold on him, “Please? I just want to have fun and show you one of the places you’ve never been in”
“No one denies you” he murmured before walking out of the bathroom to get to Harry’s office and continue doing his moves and charms.
The two remained strong, determined and stoic as they took in what the other is giving. One fueled by the knack of natural control and the other just because. Even from the distance between them, considerable feet away from each other, the heat in his gaze melted the cold ones in her own.
He looked back up and Dracy’s lips parted. She knows her cheeks are burning with shame, color and surprise already, “It’s nice and comfortable” she said without even really feeling how the pumps are to her feet.
But as an equal? She didn’t know. Many people have reduced her into someone to be called like a slut, a hole to fuck. Harry had brought her for thousands of galleons from that shitty bar she used to work in and she had fully expected that she was going to be treated worse.
He fought of the devious grin as eyes looked at him from head to toe and the expression that told him he very much have gotten the man right in the hook.
Harry nearly choked on his water for what Draco had answered. He cannot tell! Fuck! They cannot reveal!
Draco watched Harry walk out smiling before he closed his eyes and took a well-needed nap and hopefully dream about him.
Draco bit in his shoulder in return, his forehead glistening with sweat, “Yes, yes. Like that, Alpha. Fuck, fuck”
He went back in and straight to his bedroom where he saw Draco no longer there. He shook his head and showered. Afterwards, wore his Auror robes.
Draco can see even from the distance that glistening sweat on his forehead sliding down to his jaw to his neck as Harry jogged around the open area. He was only wearing his trainers and a muggle sweat pants he once saw Blaise wore. It us hugging his arse, thighs, and that huge cock perfectly.
The next thing Harry realized, his head was turned to the side, grasping his cheek in surprise but also with a sprinkle of heat in a moment, he looked at him.
When he heard a groan, he ignored it. Not wanting to talk with the reason why he’s in the hospital wing right now.
She needs her alpha but he keeps on ignoring her for some unfathomable reason. If only she knows how flying kick works.
"Bye! See you!" Draco hugged Pansy and kissed her on the cheek as they bid their own goodbyes, "Bye darling. Be careful"
"Would you like to take her place? Only if you how how to, of course. I am not forcing you, Harry. After all, I am just a little boy. I shouldn't demand things from the Head Auror"
He sighed blissfully. He knows he can create family with her and until then, they have each other. But how could he seal it? When is the best time to seal it forever? Now, he’s giving a thought about seriously marking the omega and for him to be marked in return. Provide her the same exclusivity.
“Draco” he begged and Draco sobbed and pouted so adorably, looking at him with those googoo eyes that drove him to be so fucking bad.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up in amusement and there was a glint in his eyes Draco cannot seem to pinpoint what, “Well, good morning to you too,
That’s what he sees as Harry walked in to his office to see that particularly glorious sight of round globes, clad with a pink leather skirt that’s surprisingly deemed appropriate. That swell that Harry would love to feel on his palms, he knew he’s every bit of the definition of what could be referred to as an Omega hunter.
What would he do? He let his mind wander for a bit. He’s sure Dracy can take a lot. The woman is an embodiment of strength and capability. She’s skilled and talented but what can he do? A lot actually. One of which she’ll love by the end of this lifeless gala. Throw in some interesting fun and have every way with her.
All he wanted is to impale himself and reach his own orgasm, putting all frustrations on his actions.
“So wet for me, Dracy” he whispered and inserted a finger which hugged him immediately and he felt the wetness and heat inside her. Her slick is dripping to his thighs and he felt the sharp throb of his cock.
She did not let herself be defeated. After all, this game has to be as competitive as possible. If she so just give it up easily, what would that make her? Her name, as infamous as it may be, she centered as someone who’s hard to tame. Like a lion, tiger or a python.
This is his third time getting book on the The Lounge but this is his first time getting booked for the whole night with no specific requests of what to expect from him. Normally, they would utter out what they would want from him.
Draco nodded and hummed, "I am single too" he implied with a smile. And that phrase is enough to send Harry's mind into insanity. Draco have been implying things since yesterday and fuck, he really is fucking bold.
“Good morning” Harry whispered, sliding down to kiss Draco on the jaw and giving him another love bite on the neck.
His confusion must be displayed all over his face because the bartender chuckled and winked at him, “You probably need it, Mr. Blogger”
At some point, Draco may have felt good with it. Good like c’mon, Harry is attraction itself. He may or may not have fantasize him in bed when Harry’s away with his gang shit. May have reminisced the days he took his huge cock and blew him off wonderfully.
Draco is to give Zayan fucker a lap dance? Harry swore he started to see red. He sighed when Draco nodded and stood up.
“Will you marry me, baby? I love you so much. So so much and to our little beanie and our family and our home”
“You know the Potter household tragedy, I presume?” Harry stated and without looking, Dracy shook her head, “Harry, you don’t have to”
“I am now” Harry winked, dipping down and pulling him into a searing kiss. Draco moaned and whimpered when he felt him his hands slid down to his butt and lifted him off.
He found Harry drooling on the couch and for some reason, he found his sleeping form so serene. Almost as if he wasn’t the mood destroyer, destructive threat and just the usual idiot who feeds on annoying him with his mere presence.
Harry busied himself for the next minutes trying to keep his sanity at check. He’s not looking over at Draco’s seat every minute. No, no. Of course he’s not.
His parents were the one who told him what respect is but how ironic that they do not harbor any. Yes, yes, he understands this is some kind of sacrifice but it’s like basically offering him to a complete bull!
With his eyes covered and hands cuffed above his head, Draco felt his other senses heightening, his back arched once more, keening as Harry pulled away from the kiss, mouth hovering over his cheeks to his jawline until it reached his ear,
“I’ll protect you, okay? I’ll never leave you. I’ll be beside you along the way, taking care of you, and doing everything you want me to do”
Harry blinked and gripped his seat tight as he watched Draco turned around so his ass is facing Zayan and it took every ounce of invisible restraints for Harry so he wouldn't storm and kill the mood.
He doesn't know why but there's this sudden something that clicked inside him and it told him he's interested. He'd never been with older men before and this is completely new to him.
Fuck. Fuck. Draco arched his back as he raised his legs to hug around Harry’s thighs. His hands slid down and gripped Harry’s muscled butt and pinched onto the flesh.
“I should punish you being for breaking a rule” Harry snarled, “But we have the time of the world, right?”
“How does that work?” Harry asked relentlessly. Unlike Ginny, he do need answers. He promised Draco that, "How will it work?"
“Harry” she tugged on his hand to still him and thankfully, he stopped and turned to her, “That’s too much”
And it’s still morning. He chuckled and stepped inside the elevator, “Morning” he winked at everyone in the lift.
“Exhausted expression, tensed shoulder, pursed lips, and a furrowed eyebrows. So what can be the problem, little prongs? My nephew too much energetic for your old skills?” his godfather tried to lighten the mood but Harry was too serious to even joke back.
Draco who nearly jumped off the chair, choked on his own spit before he pushed himself to nod, “Make sure you keep your hands to yourself”
Tom accepted the coffee before turning back with that glint in his eyes seemingly directed to Draco, “Well, welcome to the neighborhood, Leo and Mark. I hope you’ll settle in nicely”
Harry smirked at her as he chuckled darkly as he stood up, taking threatening steps to get closer, noticing the way the woman flinch and the regret that washed over her features.
This part is perplexing too. Why is Harry being so casual with all of these? As if things aren’t skeptic enough. They had a potion in them, something that has pearl dust in it. This is dubious.
He cried out as white spots began to take his vision, his thighs quivering and he began to feel like slipping off again. He felt like floating and as Harry particularly gave out the hardest thrust for the whole night and the familiar feeling of chapped lips to his, he cried out and came unexpectedly.
The owner of the bar made an unbreakable vow with him, never to tell a thing. He doesn’t fancy people bombarding him questions. His private life which consists of  his life and Dracy from now on should be left alone. Away from cameras, papers, gossips.
It didn’t matter if it cannot reach her g-spot because it was all too arousing. She basically melts in her place, her grip on the couch loosening as she cries back in pleasure. The sensation shooting down on her like arrow.
“Don’t start with me” Lily glared at him but leaning onto his touch, “He should be here for lunch. He needs to meet his fianceé”
All in all, it is nothing but magical. He was right. The man in Harry is so mindblowing. To be able to successfully have him on his bed, Draco wished next to have himself on Harry’s bed where he would be atop him and ride that huge hard cock. Feel those muscles for the second time around and hopefully, have a third time and more times.
He's got the complete package to crack the bubble that obviously holding Harry back. It would be much more delightful if Harry is holding Draco back and not himself.
Sure, he can excuse this for all the things he have done to him since they started their relationship but where’s the fun in that? Draco learns his lesson again and again and again.
“I am no Potions master. I do not get in the way of what Potions do and what happens after it’s gone. But as I’ve told you, with all my knowledge, things are fine”
Draco nearly yelped in shock when a voice suddenly appeared from his left side. Looking wide eyed, he saw Lovegood watching the friendly match. Her blonde hair flowing behind hair smoothly.
He moaned loudly when Harry inserted another finger, his whole body shuddering at the sting and the pleasure and all the sensations invading his being. The pain combined nicely with how amazing Harry was preparing him. His spit useless as a lubricant and it was such a delicious burn that Draco found himself liking.
She sighed. She had lost the confidence that was once glowing in her and Harry, the Alpha that can get anything he wants, decided to have her and took her out from that dirty place she used to be in.
“H-Harry” she said anxiously. Sitting up and covering herself with blanket. She saw breakfast at the bedside table.
Harry sighed. There’s just one thing Ron doesn’t understand here. Mating and marking is a huge commitment and it wasn’t Harry’s purpose to when he got her out of that bar. His intentions were good and it maybe isn’t pure in some aspects but he believes that claiming should be consented in both sides.
“More. Touch me, want you to touch me” he tried to order firmly but his voice came out as a breathy moan, barely holding back a sound of plea.
“If you’re unsure on the process, there are books you can read on to help and guide you” she recommended before flicking her wand again and the image disappeared. Harry helped Dracy to sit up and slid an arm around her shoulder, running his hand up and down her arms in a soothing manner.
Why was it not easy to let go? And really just follow what he wants to do? It was a good feeling to touch Draco and witness him cum with only just his fingers inside him but when Draco screamed, he realized what he did and cursed himself.
Dracy didn’t think much of it when she crawled to Harry’s lap and encircled her arms around his nape. She shook her head, still trying to stop him but Harry didn’t budge and continue. He encircled his arms around her waist and pulled her towards his body
He tried to forget the moment he just shared with his former counterpart as he focused on his food, trying to distract himself by thinking about the eight year tower they’ll be staying in.
“Get the fuck out!” he exclaimed and tried to push Harry out but as his palms landed on that rigid chest, he found out how much strength it holds and
His palms glided along his pec, hard planes of power rippling against his graceful palm, “Let me help you” he blew hot air in his ear, fighting a grin when Harry groaned huskily, “I can help you soothe your body”
He remembers the number one of the House of Potter morals he grew up with. The one his grandfather had him memorized.
"Damn, let me hit that snack" Draco grinned but wiped it off immediately when he heard the familiar voice.
Sirius gulped. No matter how much he pretends to hate being called a kitten because he is fucking Padfoot, he loved it. Makes him feel so small in comparison to Moony literally being a werewolf.
“Want you off this dress. Want you in your panties only, kneeling in my bed and wait for me” he ordered firmly, command with no position to oppose. His tone went from stern to definitely serious with a hint of gentleness.
“Hands on the wall. Safeword if anything makes you uncomfortable. Remember, it’s you who controls this, little one” he whispered, “What’s your safeword?”
She nibbled on her lips, left foot tapping in the ground. How is she going to say it without offending the alpha?
She can feel him at her buttocks. The hardening length, huge and surely, powerful. She can feel all of him above her and his clothes. She can feel him.
“I remembered I have a problem to fix, Sir. Can I be dismissed now?” he smiled cheekily at him and Kingsley sighed once more before he shook his head tiredly.
Her eyes rolled back and her chest heaved. She’s going to faint. It’s all so good. The way his tongue delved in and fucked her slowly but sensually, she shivered.
As they were locked within an arms length inside the bedroom, Harry did not even had the chance to look around as his back came contact with the wall and Malfoy’s barreled roughly on the bed.
Draco had watched him gracefully flick his hands while calmly reciting incantations and it was something he had never seen in other Aurors. Harry is a Head Auror for a reason, he can see and feel that very well.
He was definitely in shambles now. What does this man have that crumbles him like the ashes of his cigarette falling to the floor?
Surely within a second, his eyes are back to him. Tears are beginning to well at the corner of his eyes as he started to imagine all possible punishments he could receive.
Harry growled and wandlessly spelled his fingers some lube and within a second, he felt the smooth and soft liquid on his fingers, having it poured over to Draco’s ass to his perineum and he moaned.
“Dray” he heard Pansy called him but his eyes were elsewhere. He was staring straight ahead, at the Gryffindor table where Harry and a slutty seventh year is sitting beside his Harry! Closer than he’d like to see and closer than what’s necessary between a person who for the love of Merlin is already taken.
It didn’t take long before Harry slid, groaning at the feeling he misses whenever he’s away from pouncing on Draco. His eyes threatened to clench shut but he needed to watch Draco come apart, greedily needed to watch his expressions and the ecstasy written all over his face.
Flirting leads to romance and romance is nothing but a joke and if you fall to a joke, you’d be treated as a clown and clowns aren’t silly, they’re scary and if you’re scary, you’re left alone and if you’re left alone, you’re lonely and if you’re lonely, then die. That’s Draco’s ultimate advice beginning now. Very effective, he’ll probably try it.
"Wow. Parties that ends at six? There are no parties that ends at six because they start at six" Draco cut him off once more. Emphasizing his point and bit his lips when Harry's eyes turned a shade colder.
His left hand tease his pert nipples, thumb rolling at at them playfully. Draco arched his back and cussed a million times.
“So desperate for me, huh? Fuck, you’re so fucking hot. Soaking and just letting me do whatever I fucking want” he pushed the tip in, stopping for a moment as he watched the way her chest heaved and her mouth parted, "That's it, darlin'. Taking me so well"
And what? Do not act but also do not NOT act? Hmm, now, he might just rely on his cock in the end because he just did a while ago.
“What happened?” Lucius asked, his eyebrows furrowed in deep concentration in the same way his usually composed wife is currently doing.
Dracy woke up sweaty and feeling hot all over her body. She feels sudden cravings of certain foods and wanted a certain Alpha beside her to cuddle her while the other part of her wanted to scream at the top of her lungs and be wrapped in a thick blanket and curse the world.
Not even five years to the marriage and this man is full of secrets already. Well, not like this is something true, right? He grumbled and waited for minutes until the front door opened.
He gulped as he felt Harry slid up even more and licked his inner thighs. Draco tried to buck his hips up but Harry held him back, “Stay still, baby”
Dracy was undecided and let Harry pick. She was trying to calm herself down because she’s feeling itchy at both of her breasts and the heaviness that’s beginning to take in it. She doesn’t even have huge breasts but it sure feel like it.
Wait… What is Harry doing inside? He furrowed his eyebrows and squinted his eyes as Harry turned to look back and waved a hand with a smile before making his way to the apartment.
That's something that his great great grandfather created and taught the Potter family members because his son nearly bedded a young teen.
He wanted to roll his eyes and waved his hand to call for the server. When a server arrived whose nametag says Limo, he handed them the menu.
He bent down, beginning to gently lap on her jawline, tongue sticking out to lick the contour of it as he thrust his hips to Dracy’s clothed core. She trembled in need as her scent brushed up his nostrils and he growled.
Harry took his fingers out and begin to leisurely lap the cum off of his fingers, producing slurping noises and Dracy blushed deeper when she realized what he was doing.
His parents have been so happy for him and so accepting he cannot believe it. When he got those words out, he started to show the public who he is. He began in Hogwarts where students ridiculed him for being such a freak but it didn’t matter what he has gone through because one day, his whole life shifted.
Harry growled and clenched his jaw. Draco gasped when Harry spanked him suddenly. Feeling the slight rippling pain and the delicious burn it had afterwards.
It didn’t take long for his newly uploaded blog be flooded with reactions and comments and decided to read some of them.
He was so sensitive that a few strokes can probably get him off but he knew Harry was far from done with him. He was clearly taking his time, enjoying controlling to have fun with him like he had said. Now, he’s coming to regret letting those words out of his mouth.
Harry was dressed to the nines and it didn’t hurt Draco to admit this is his first time getting attracted to a victim of his seduction. Harry is everything Draco likes in a man. Regardless of how ‘good’ he is at pretending he didn’t like Draco’s attention or if he really doesn’t like it, he is gorgeous. Neatly styled hair that Draco had managed to see be a rat’s nest at times, expensive tuxedos, three piece suits, a style that rivals that of whole generation worth of fashion.
Draco rolled his eyes. Tipsy his ass. The way he staggered on his feet says enough. He rested his hands in his sides, caging Draco in. Leaning a bit forward, Draco stared at the color of his eyes to the line of those lips.
Harry raked his eyes all over her, hands grasping a bouquet of flowers and smiling widely, “You look so beautiful” he complimented, extending his hands.
“It’s a baby boy, darling. It’s a James” he may have let out a sob and series of thank you’s. Ignoring the eyes that are watching them, he stared at Dracy who has her eyes half open,
“Fuck” harry swore, holding him by his hips to guide him up and down, not bothering to muffle their noises. The outside is as noisy as them and it’s not like his gang is going to judge their choice of location.
“Fuck” Harry grunted, eyes glued to the way Draco’s chest heaved, feeling his hands against his rippled chest and with a whisper of an incantation, Harry’s upper clothes tore itself away.
Harry smiled up to him, presenting that small black box and when he opened it, Draco may have exploded right then and there.
Harry can feel the excitement surging in but also the desire to quicken things up. Ravage her in a way she doesn’t even know she wants but he does.
He's dying to touch Harry in any places his hands could reach. He's been wanking on his bed with the thoughts of Harry's hands touching him and fingering him open. He never had an intense orgasm like he did just last night.
Simple phrase with thousands of meanings. She blinked, trying to control her emotions. She lost her mom before and when she thought it’s just going to be just her and her father, she had lost him too.
He was raised with kindness and rationality. He developed his own good sense of judgment and taught himself to rely on his mind. He’s a man. He is a fucking man and Draco is still a boy.
, to decorate the tree?” he said, crossing his arms over his chest, glaring at everyone doing anything but the task at hand.
“But the two of us have always been running around a bit strange. Why acknowledge this to be weird now?”
His vision was assaulted by a huge mansion, green, adorned with colorful flowers and a fountain with a statue right in the middle. The place was huge, scattered all around the area were people cleaning and sweeping dirt.
Draco watched Harry leave the Manor interestedly. His minds going in circles and thoughts creating chaotic possibilities to enjoy the time and the Auror his parents hired to guard him.
Oh, fuck. So hot. Sirius cried out, moaned as Remus thrust into the hilt, driving him crazy. Not really caring whether they are in their home or not. James’ house is good as any other because if it has a bed, they will fuck on it.
He’s sweet and all kinds chivalrous. The hope giver to the ones who’ve lost the ability to and the goodness of the world they thought have been consumed by darkness. He was the one who made Draco believe there’s still beautiful ones in a place full of monsters.
As soon as they came out of the fireplace of the grocery shop Harry brought her into, eyes immediately settled on them as their mouth began to work before their minds do.
“Kitten” his husband spoke, taking his attention away from admiring his muscled torso. Even at their age, Remus is still the most beautiful.
Sirius moaned, beginning to roll his hips to feel more, hoping to chase the friction that just won’t come.
He started slightly feeling awkward when he felt the man gazing at him intently and as minutes pass by, he’s sure the man is inching closer to the counter and the fingers tapping above it are crawling back and forth, as if trying to tell him something.
“Don’t think I didn’t know your plan, Draco” he leaned down to level his head, his hand slid up from their position on his thighs to his hips, squeezing in warning, “Don’t think I can’t see what’s going on inside that pretty little head of yours”
“You must be the cousins” his voice was kind but Lucius learned not to condescend it. After all, he had learned it from his father how kind people tend to be even more dangerous.
Harry turned around and raised an eyebrow at him. Draco stood beside him, hands rubbing up and down Harry’s back, “Sorry. Had to finished some household chores”
Harry’s soft gaze turned a shade darker before clenching his jaw. As if he was merely holding himself back fromm completely pouncing on her. He straightened before tilting her chin back up while the other began to creep underneath the loose shirt she is wearing.
Draco bit his lips, somehow in those eyes that greeted him with warm and loving embrace, he found himself turned on. After all the roughness he loves, all those intense orgasms last night, he desired a soft one for the morning. One that could sing him the same soft lyrics that used to be his lullabies when he was a kid.
Harry smiled, “You may do chores around here, you may have been sold like a slave but you deserve to be treated as equal”
He brace his arms on either side of her face and bent down to give her a kiss on the forehead, lips subtly dragging to her pointed nose and to that cherry red that he has been addicted to and surely, will always be addicted to.
She laughed like a bomb that exploded, Harry was quick to cast muffliato, “You’re still as oblivious as ever, Harry. It’s no wonder Ron managed to have a girlfriend before you did”
McGonagall as firm as ever had the strict expression on her face and one eyebrow raised. She perused them for a moment, standing in front of them and clearing her throat before speaking, “How are you feeling?”
“They aren’t just words, Harry. Words led me to rebel, words let me take the dark mark, words let me be this way. Words led me be beaten up by hundreds of crucios and canes. Words led me think so badly of myself. Words led me to a certain stage in life where I thought of something harmful”
He winced, scrambling to get down and pull Draco up, “Sorry” he apologized, kissing him on his cheeks.
She never had a child of her own blood but the students are who she considered her own. She’s grateful of how they have grown, improved and moved on. She’s happy they are now able to be the child they are, the kids they should be.
She yelped when he scooped her up in his arms and carried her to the bathtub. He settled her down nicely before he began to tear his clothes off of his body. Dracy sighed, finally she gets to stare at all those muscles hugging his upper body and that view of his hard cock, wanting attention but her view disappeared as Harry joined her, thighs spread apart to accommodate her in between.
No matter how much Draco hates how much of a fucker this Alpha is, he would not deny such defining qualities that sets him apart from all the others out there.
Harry merely hummed and before Draco can even prepare for it, Harry began to fuck him with earnest. His fingers beginning to pound harder and Draco cried out, gasping after and knees buckling.
He took a deep breath. It will do him no good if he is to be swallowed for whatever it is gnawing inside him. This is his job, this is what he should do.
The eyes staring at her lips or specifically, in the corner of her lips, was intense and almost flaming.
Draco bit his lips and sighed. He nodded after a while. There's really a foreign air of captivation when it comes to Harry's presence and he felt his body reacted with Harry's little one.
Draco salivated as he watched him rolled the sleeves to his elbow before sinking himself to the chair in front of him, his legs slightly wide open and Draco began to wonder how would it feel to ride those powerful thighs, to feel the muscles stabbing his ass and he had to breathe heavily so he wouldn't moan loudly at the thought.
Harry looked at himself, tied to the chair, unable to do anything but to sit still as he looked at Draco with slightly wide eyes, “What are you doing, baby boy?” his eyes serious but there was a grin.
They were having a simple date night inside Harry’s house. It was a surprise from the Alpha when he arrived from his stroll to somewhere he wouldn’t reveal to her. He was holding a pack of her favorite chocolates she happily ate before taking a nice shower.
Harry laughed for the cute action and pecked his lips for several times. Fuck. He felt like floating above the clouds.
He shook his head. This is his first time seeing it even. He’s not into books as much but the delight in Draco’s face was something he cannot forget easily as he shuffled closer, “Want me to read it to you?”
She wiped the sweat on her forehead, starting to feel slick dripping out of her hole into her sheets. She whimpered and cried out. Harry. She needs Harry. She wants him.
That explains maybe. Probably or hopefully. But for a first timer like him, he seemed to be doing just fine. More than fine actually.
He enjoys the aftersex silence the same way he enjoys the noises they make. It just felt so blissful and no doubts of his could ever top that.
“I hate you so I’m not going to give you anything” he answered as he accepted the flower. It looked nice in all honesty.
And for that kind of bravery and courage, Harry admired him for it. He doesn’t cower neither does he does feel ashamed to show to everyone who he is as he wanted himself to be seen.
Harry waved his hand and turned around. He approached Draco absentmindedly as he thought back to the conversation with Luna.
He opened his eyes after a while. He didn’t stare at him and against all things, he bent his head down and kissed him.
He saw him focused on his works with expressions hunched up in concentration while muttering something under his breath.
Harry nearly choke at Draco's shameless questions. He knew there's a hidden message to it somewhere, some message for him to uncover and he easily did.
. So easily and freely spoken but soft as a feathery touch, something haven-like but also, risky. Never did he have someone gave him the chance to decide, to choose what he wants to do and be respective as he can be considering Draco’s line of work.
P.P.S. I don't have a beta so I sincerely apologize for any errors and mistakes that may have been able to escape from my eyes ♡
It was something she never experienced before. Simple things, simple things but thoroughly thought of. Thoroughly planned and considered. It’s nothing too fancy but definitely too touching.
“Thank you” he heard her whispered and he let out a small smile before turning his head to give her a kiss in the forehead.
She thought it was her who needed loving but in reality, it was him who needed it the most. She bound the Alpha with her. Now, she will love him.
. He wasn’t able to voice out his apology so the least he could do was to show Lovegood he wasn't the person before and that he was wearing the bracelet. Now, his bracelet.
He thumbed at her nipple, pushing back before gripping it between his fingertips. He rolled and pulled on it, giving both pleasure and a tinge of pain in her. Her pussy reacted and throbbed. She was so sensitive, few kisses and touches and she’s utterly spent.
Dracy moaned, one of her hands gripping his head tight while the other held at the couch for support. Her legs began to feel like jelly and seemed as if she have no energy to keep up with his pace.
“Harry, please, please” the sound of her like that, needy and begging, it was enough for Harry to drip enough of his precum down to her pussy and mixing with her own arousal, he slid his hips up and down, coating his hard cock before diving back down and playing with her breast.
It’s him Harry can refer he comes home to. The reason this small town is still worthy to be called his home. The purpose that Harry intends to always keep and he, in Harry’s words, his angel. He doesn’t know how Harry can see in that way. It’s obvious he doesn’t have wings nor this soft glow that hugs his presence.
He moaned, senses heightening as Harry deprived him of touching him. Both of his hands bound above his head as he took what Harry is giving him. His lips parted in pleasure as his eyes stared at the messy hair. His legs trembling when Harry’s fingers grazed through his perineum, his tongue prodding at his hole.
Remind him to change such attitudes and traditions in their house. He looked down at his papers and felt himself get dizzy at the realization that he has other ten cases to handle and Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy's insistence is delaying him to finish an actual work.
The trail of fine hair across Harry's chest leading to his defined abdomen trailing down lower and pretty sure to that cock is fucking sexy.
Harry and his friends fell into an easy conversation, eating now and then a small portion of rice and some fried chicken legs. He pulled their hands above his leg and held it there, giving Draco some attention by rubbing his thumb on his skin.
He gasped, taking one step back. Suddenly, everything felt too constricted. He grabbed his robes and tried not to thrash around. What? How could he say it so easily? He’s wrong. He’s wrong!
He used to be shy, dubious, and very afraid to speak for the fear for Harry’s judgment. Not knowing how to begin and where to even start or how to answer if he is to be bombarded with Harry’s endless questions. Or the fear of his thoughts coming into reality, thinking Harry will break up with him once he gets to know what has been in his heart’s desires.
“Whoa. Calm down there. Though I like this attitude, it turns me on. But what’s the matter, sugar? Didn’t have enough coffee?”
“’mione” he cut her off, keeping his voice secure and his patience at bay, “Thank you but I think I can handle this my own”
James laughed at his wife, his right hand grazing the softness of Lily’s cheeks. Sirius pouted. Why is it so hard to find that kind of love for his own?
He pouted adorably, running his foot up and down on Harry, acting innocent of what’s happening underneath. He smirked at the shiver Harry tried to suppress and the splotch of red on his ear going down to his neck,
“’arry” she whimpered as she felt him pushed her panties aside and the tongue that’s teasing across her vulva, his thumb playing with her clit in playful manner.
“Jump” Harry whispered, tapping his butt and Draco obeyed right away. Harry caught him with one hand. Draco’s legs hang loosely because of his jeans on his knees, not really removed, constricting him of locking his ankles around Harry’s back.
For once, he saw an uncontrolled Draco, unrestricted and letting him see what he is feeling. After a while, Harry entered another finger to scissor him, easily stretching the tight hole and loving the squelching noises his fingers produce as he thrusted, his fingers lightly grazing the prostate as Draco clenched down on him.
Currently, before the day for the Christmas feast comes, they decided to gather around the common room to have some pre-feast fun. Hannah and Neville took some food in the kitchens and Dean and Seamus went to grab some alcohol.
Can you believe that? He’s a mess. The head of the Roaring Lions is in a mess. Pansy who’s been wondering when to see him crack have arrived though the woman is out with Hermione with their usual couple’s night few rooms before his.
How he would love to be on his knees for his daddy, feel his erection on his tongue and maybe for Harry to even slap him with it, praises shooting out between those lips and fuck him hard to the floor but no.
“Harry” Draco whimpered, wanting to feel his weight above him, pining him down on the bed. Make him his because Draco knows, deep inside, he wanted to be. To be the one Harry always think about.
She looks so beautiful kneeling, hand steadily keeping her slow pace while the other held his abdomen and when she bent down, closing her lips on his cock’s head, he grumbled. His hand tightened around her head.
“Alright, alright little prongs. What did you do?” Siri asked and Harry sighed as he bit on his tongue.
He did immediately. He kept his eyes open, watching and calculating what Harry’s next movement is going to be. One hand leaned on the car while the other held the side of his left leg, slowly sliding it up and down to his thigh, “Was that your plan?”
More so when the reason he cannot sleep is the man beside him. The spontaneous trip to Hogsmeade where they had fun and he actually enjoyed Harry’s company. The laughter he shared with the man because of a rather funny butterbeer accident with the patron.
However, it seemed as if Hermione had other plans because she started to rumble about things he could do to make it up to her. He appreciates the sentiment, he really does. He’s grateful for the help, Hermione have always been selfless. She, most times, tries to take care of others before she takes care of herself. But other times, she’s just downright intruding.
“The service here always sucks” he had a nice timbre. His voice wasn’t cold or husky like Draco had expected. There was this controlled tone in them, almost as if masked by kindness as not to give away.
He just touched him, maybe not too sexual but it’s fucking out of line. For the love of Merlin, why is he this horny?!
He smirked as he looked at Sirius’ wide eyes. He knows he still want his cuddles but Sirius just had to suggest something.
He didn’t bother when he heard Remus chuckled darkly, clearly loving the way he is reacting. He wanted to grind his erection to his but he is not letting him.
“It’s alright, Miss. I’ll handle this. Thank you” he waved a hand to dismiss her pleasantly before bidding goodbye to whoever was on the phone.
She took a deep breath, her left hand going to rest on top of Harry’s thighs for support, “So you could move on with your life as well. . . I forgive you”
He’s drowning in it. That he can feel so. His arms tried to pop Harry’s buttons, wanted to get him off of the confines of his clothes, want him bare even if it’s just for the physical aspect. The man revealed he can bare Draco without trying and he will do his best to bare him back, even just a sliver of the mysteries in his name.
He looks handsome and well-put, casual with an air of nonchalance. With the poise of dominance but relaxed. He was broad and a feet or two taller than him, dressed in tight pants and black shirt that clung to him just right. Gorgeously well-endowed. Pansy picked the right one.
Harry sighed and looked at his wrist watch. It’s already time for breakfast and he had asked Wily to cook them their meals. He didn’t bother waking the omega up, thinking she needed a thorough rest.
, need you” she whispered, feeling as if her world is about to crumble down in desperation, the slick oozing out her cunt dripping on her panties. Fuck. She’s so fucking turned on.
He tried not to say anything else about how his chest thundered when he speaks, to the way how his fingers trembled on their places when Malfoy raised his head and rolled his eyes.
He downed his coffee in one gulp and sighed. Looking over two folders of cases in the Malfoy kitchen table. He slept here to familiarize himself with every corner of the Malfoy Manor and would be going home later to get his things and inform his family he would be staying somewhere for the meantime.
He shrugged, holding himself back from preening. Might as well he call both of them first timers. Harry's first time in the club and Draco's first time to decide what happens in the private bookings.
He’s a force to be reckoned, emboldened moves that even the most heartless person cannot resist. He’s got the power to shift attention to him, walks with a purpose and long legs that just rules.
She tried to buck her hips up. Desperate for his mouth on her but Harry laid a hand on her and stopped her from her movements, “Stay still”
"Merlin, did I just leave the door open?!" Draco frantically asked. Harry raised an eyebrow at his reaction.
“Who doesn’t know this famous blogger who recommended to spread hate than love? You’re all over the internet, love”
“Sssh. Don’t mind them, love. Don’t mind them, okay?” Harry tried to impart, “I love you. Don’t mind them. They’re just words. Just words, love”
His back arched when Harry opened him up with both of his thumbs and inserted his tongue inside. Exploring and tasting him beyond. At some point, he might have drooled a little when his fingers joined his tongue and mercilessly toyed with his prostate, milking him of his precum cascading through his lower abdomen to the side of his hips.
Harry gripped the glass full of whiskey tight to his hands. He was seated at a single couch of some sort of a cheap motel room, enjoying his pity party with Ron and Blaise while the thin walls are filled with the lustful moans of his bikers. They can’t even have the decency to have sex far away.
What is happening? This must be a dream. She shouted at him last night and she was pretty sure it might take days before Harry decides to return.
But it won’t hurt anyone if she just lay down a bit with the oddities. He’s not calling her weird or what, he’s labeling the mystery she shows off as odd.
Like hell he would let this opportunity slip away. Harry is very handsome. Manly and he wants to feel his beard stab his skin and how would it feel if he scratch it in his hands.
She had dreamt about him. Her omega side had dreamt about the man touching her in inappropriate places once again. Wanting to feel her bare skin against him.
Dracy smiled at what she saw. She may not fully recognize it yet but it was doing things to her to feel emotional. The life. The life inside her womb. It was just too much and fuck these hormones.
When Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy hired him, he was expecting a child. Maybe still seven or eight or even younger. He didn't expect to see someone completely far from his imaginations.
He gulped, gripping the glass a little too tight. Both liking and disliking the feeling of having no way out of Harry’s arms. There was no tension between them, there was just this relaxing atmosphere around them. The kind that has Draco wanting to lean closer, meet Harry halfway and kiss him personally.
“I love you. No questions, no doubts, no problems. If you want to say no, please do so” he smiled softly, “I want to spend my life with you. The whole world may be the kingdom but you’re my home.
“Hmm?” and the way he responds like it was really his name makes Harry feel all the butterflies in his stomach.
He grinned when Lucius seemed to emanate that dark rage around him, his fingers stopping and his whole body tensed. He saw the way Cissa tried to calm her husband down by putting a hand on his thigh, “Lucy, darling”
Draco proceeded to talk to her and tell her how it happened in a nice detailed story. He left some parts of it unsaid because some of it was only for between them both. Especially how Draco felt having to feel Harry’s bare muscles against his lithe form.
His jaw dropped when Harry stepped away. Unclasping his hand around his neck and putting it inside his pockets. What is he doing?! No, no.
There was no other way to describe the suddenness of it all. Draco’s head is swimming in subspace as he let Harry take what he wants. His lips are chapped and rough which easily complement Draco’s soft and plump ones.
Draco tried to recall whether he had encountered blibbering humdingers before or Luna are spouting out her weird creatures again.
The guilt holding him returned and Draco shuddered. He cannot avoid this. He cannot. He took a deep breath and gathered enough courage to really talk. Like how Pansy wanted. Like how Harry wanted. Like how he should’ve wanted.
Silvery eyes stared at emerald ones. Intense, seductive and equally calling in. With no ounce of signs of who’s going to look away or who’s going to give up.
“Dinner’s about to be cooked and we’ll go rest after that. Sounds good, love?” Harry checked in, giving a kiss to his forehead. Draco nodded and  hummed contentedly.
“Oh, yeah? Then how would you explain the thousand hickeys I saw from your neck from the day I was hired with this job?”
Harry nodded and gave her a kiss on the cheek, “How was you day?” he willed himself to ask, not wanting to open the subject of her question last night.
“How are you feeling, Mr. Potter?” McGonagall asked as he sit down inside her office. Glasses falling a bit on her nose as she peered at him with observant eyes.
“I didn’t say that” Harry stated, not really keen in talking about something so personal in his life to Hermione. He knows how Hermione can be. She’s smart and intelligent but there are times that she can be one-sided and favor what she thinks should be favored.
Harry leaned his face down a bit. He stick his tongue out and lick Draco’s bottom lip, “You taste so good, baby. So smooth and soft for me”
Sure it broke Harry’s heart to see him so sad and hopeless but fuck, didn’t Draco ever consider how hard it was for him to control? He’s the adult here and he should act like one.
Malfoy looked at the leftover squill bulb juices on his hand and felt the color in his face ran pale. His mind seemed to stop to process.
“No” he bowed his head low. This whatever this is had turned around three sixty degree southwest. Fuck. This is completely out of anyone’s expectations. Out of his expectations and anything he may have thought will happen.
Draco had welcomed him again even after leaving him like a fool for three days and acting like a complete bastard.
“Yes, fuck. Now, get me out of this binds and I will ravish you over and over again. Let me love you”
“So good, little one. So good” Harry whispered as he pulled out. Draco whined at the loss immediately and Harry shushed him gently. He cleaned them both with a spell as he zipped himself up.
“Fuck,” Harry cursed as he gripped his jaw tight as he began to thrust slowly, “You’re clenching around me so tight, baby. So precious”
“I’m leaving” she harshly announced and walked away, wanting to begin packing right away and return to where she used to be. Back in that crampy place. Who cares?!
“You’ll see, baby. Trust me” he winked and carefully guided her inside it before dropping the floo powder and murmuring a location she’s only hearing for the first time.
“You’re pregnant” he murmured, “We’re parents. We may not consider ourselves to be family now but I know we will in short time”
"Not so bad" Draco answered smoothly and shrugged. But he knows his insides are rejoicing because finally, he doesn't have boring Aurors to guard him.
Harry hummed before diving in, mouthing on his balls as his fingers teased on his sloppy rim, feeling the way the hole throb on his touch and the way it adjusted to clenched around him as he entered.
Have they really downgraded Draco that they would let him marry a muggle? A muggle! What is he going to do for the rest of his life? Hide the fact that he has marvelous magic in him? Is he going to hide he is magical in all aspects?
Draco shook his head before he performed another spell and tied Harry to the chair, hands at the back of it and with no way to escape, only perhaps by Harry’s own magical powers.
"I've noticed that your luggage is still not settled. Let me show you your room" Draco stood up and began walking. Harry had no choice but to follow him.
He didn’t even bother to look up to see who it is. That voice is practically ingrained on him already. But the beating in his chest didn’t familiarize with him. That feeling, restricting feeling that makes the Great Hall feels smaller was still there. But a lot less weighing.
"We need to go back to the Malfoy Manor. But don't hesitate to continue the game" Harry glared at the teen named Zayan who is fucking stupid enough to match his stare and smiled at him tauntingly and Harry cannot stop himself from threatening, "Do be careful though or you might find yourself with a cell in Azkaban"
He needs some loving, he needs to see how grateful she is and she wants to show him how beautiful he made her life even when they started at a slightly rough patch. Turning her body to face him, she smiled at the perplexity on his eyes.
He coughed. His eyes widened and he blushed worst than ever. Did he just? He gasped and looked away, trying to convince himself it was the firewhiskey pushing Harry to act like this. It wasn’t of decision or choice but the alcohol alone.
Harry was sitting in the dining chair, blankly staring at the coffee in front of him and didn’t  even look up when Remus and Sirius went inside the dining.
“I want you to listen carefully, yeah?” he yelped when Harry turned him around, his front pressing into the car.
“You won’t get any, Parkinson. You don’t have to worry” Seamus said sarcastically, smirking when Harry laughed loudly, nearly spraying his juice in his face.
He heard Draco gasped and wrapped his hands around his nape. Harry groaned roughly and held him by his hips and lifted him up. Draco encircled his legs around Harry’s legs.
The handsome man is seated on the center of the crowd, alone in a table with a glass of whiskey in front of him. His right leg is crossed to the other and his left hand was resting in the vacant chair beside him, holding a cigarette between his fingers, eyes blazing like fueled fire.
They were eating in silence, Harry sparring him glances every now and then to make sure Draco was still comfortable on his seat.
Hello! I just wanna share that I removed my end note in the chapter 1 because it keeps on appearing in every chapter.
Her morning sickness have gotten worse for the past few weeks. The cravings and all of the demands Harry makes sure are met. She felt like she’d been blessed with the world and maybe, she is.
She pulled him forward and kissed him full on the lips. She felt Harry grinned at her lips before he pulled away for an inch while gently sucking her bottom lip to his mouth. She moaned at the action.
“Well, as you see, I bumped into Tom while I was finishing up with my jog and luckily for us, he invited me to his place. Nothing suspicions but the surprising amount of bank transfer from various people” he held out a flash drive and smirked, “And I got his schedule in there. He’s pretty busy”
He tried his best to ignore his daddy’s husky voice because he should learn his lesson. He took hold of the dildo and while trying to build anticipation, he suck on the huge thing, doing his best to wet them as his hands trailed down lower.
"That must be him" Narcissa said and stood up and went to let boring Potter in. Draco glared down at the table and started to sulk. If his parents leave, he will rush to go and stay at Pansy's.
His forehead creased and his lips pulled down. Looking away, he met Luna’s eyes who offered another of her dreamy smile.
He, not once had commented to the topic embedded next to his name. Easily ignoring people wanting to know, wanting to prod every little detail they can in his life, to uncover that smirking exterior. Harry let them say what they want, write what they want because everyone knows how these rumors go away in a blink of an eye.
Little by little, he spoke of his desires. Slowly, he opened up what he wanted and what he have been dreaming of by midnight, imagining by sunlight and wishing for by sunset.
Her legs opened on their own accord. She could feel how ruined her panties are and how wet she is from her own arousal, slick sliding out of her cunt.
. He wanted to shout and yell but didn’t want to risk it. His eyes rolled as he tried to move his hips, thrusting it to Harry’s and moaning when he felt his clothed erection bumping to his naked one.
He heard the small grunts and heavy breath from him, can feel the weight he was holding to keep himself from crushing him and with his covered eyes, staring into the abyss of darkness, Draco can almost see what is currently happening.
He will get what he wants and leave him like all the others. Surely, one day ‘good’ Harry will eventually cave and fall to the pit of the seductress.
“This is our son, Draco. Son, these are our new friends, Mr. James and Mrs. Lily Potter” his father introduce.
His ears were flooded with those sensual phrases. Touching him in a way, caressing his whole body as he was hugged with nothing but his husband.
“So. . .” Sirius started, the ghost of his usual smirk resting on the corner of his lips and that familiar glint of mischief behind those eyes that’s usually fixated on Remus’ biceps and abs, “Do you have a boyfriend, Draco?”
It’s already seven in the evening and Harry told her his friends will be arriving in any minute now and the longer she stares at reflection, the longer she grows agitated. What if she makes a mistake? Or what if they ask her about something and she doesn’t know the answer? What will Harry do? What will she do?
Luke was speechless as he took in the sight before him. He opened his mouth to try to say something but Harry stepped between them, taking his wallet at his back pocket and slamming a few dollars on the counter, not once giving Draco and Luke a glance.
Harry understood and his hands slid to hold him under his thighs and Draco might have screamed when it was Harry who was suddenly pounding roughly into him. He cried out, hand grasping the dogtags and pulling on it.
Harry clenched and unclenched his jaw. He walked over to her and crouched down. Dracy immediately encircled her shaking hands at his nape and kissed him, moaning instantly. Harry inhaled, pressing his clothed erection to her wet pussy and grunting.
He blinked and waited for several seconds. Waiting in Merlin’s name if this is some shenanigan Harry has in his sleeve. Who knows this man is still salty with the game of Spear’s Gamble? It was quite the sight.
“They’ll protect you the same way my necklace protects me from Nargles” she smiled and waved a hand, “I think you’re fine, Pansy. Just needs to eat some pudding”
“Harry” she complained. Her hands began to dip down to feel Harry through his jeans. Her own action stuttered for a bit when Harry sucked, sending jolts of desire straight to her core, drawing more slick from her pussy. She’s sure she would be dripping by now.
Merlin. He loves this. Harry really is magnificent. He gathered what strength he had left and pulled Harry to face him. They smiled at each other when their eyes met and Draco closed his eyes when Harry bent down, brushing his nose to his before kissing him full on the lips.
“See something you like?” Harry teased, noticing the way Draco’s eyes lingered on his abdomen to the bulge in the center.
“Well, I got my gift this morning so it’s alright” he winked and Draco had the audacity to blush like a teenager, “Shut the fuck up, ugly”
Dracy tilted her head, she didn’t answer as she stared over to the man. Her eyes wandering  all over his towering figure. The bulge in the right places and the way it flexes even just the littlest of movement. Her mouth watered almost immediately.
He had already purposely avoided to talk about what had happened but Draco is trying to stir things again! He gritted his teeth and ruffled his hair in frustration.
“It is as easy as easter egg hunt” he began, “I’m going to touch you all over,” he leaned a little closer, licking a stripe up the side of his neck. Draco’s eyes fluttered the action, not failing the obscene mewl he let out,
Sweat dribbled down on his temple as his chest heaved. His breathing gets heavier as minutes tick by and by the fourth finger, Draco gushed out more precum. The burn all more obvious now. He ignored all of them as his ears felt as if they were ringing neutral noises.
“Okay, I admit I am kind of a playboy but I like you in a way I haven’t liked others before. I know you may not believe me for all the ruckus I showed but yeah”
She washed her hands and wiped it on her long skirts after, it was old and loose on the side. No matter how much she wanted to magically fix them, she doesn’t own a wand and she’s too ashamed to ask Harry to do it for her.
Draco sobbed. Feeling so wrecked by Harry's mere words, his presence, and the delicious aftertaste of the way he let his control go and allowed Harry to take over. A tear rolling out of his eyes as he felt his cheeks began to flush and the growing need to see and look Harry straight in the eyes. He wanted to fucking see it all.
Harry immediately responded, his hands tightening around her waist and pulling her into him even more. He took control of the kiss and deepened it.
He grabbed Draco’s lacy panties discarded to the side of the couch and put it on his back pocket as he stood up. When Draco cried out, Harry was quick to get to him and turned him around softly. He put a hand under his thighs and upper body and easily carried him to his bedroom.
Draco, on the other hand, cannot describe how he felt. Those words. Words that never seemed to rest whenever he or they go out, wherever he or they go. They’re always present and like usual, it was no better than last time.
Fuck, fuck. Harry huffed. He gulped before closing his eyes and opening them after a second, “You’re playing with me”
He decided to push it a little bit further and gently trace his abdomen with his forefinger. He encircled each muscle after another and pressing it firmly a few times.
“So, lookin’ like a snack. Is someone expecting a dessert?” Pansy wriggled her eyebrows, running her fingers in her hair.
It's easy to guard actually. What's not easy is the person he is guarding. That seductive young boy. He would be pouncing willingly if not for the morals he should value.
“How dare you!” before she could even stop herself, she raised a hand and slapped him! Harry’s head turned to the side with the impact, the loud smack resonating throughout the room and Dracy didn’t even feel an ounce of guilt. If ever, she felt better.
Draco giggled by the ticklish sensation, his hands trying to pry Harry’s lips away from the side of his waist. He would not stop pecking him with kisses, spoiling all of him on the lovely morning the next day.
Harry opened his eyes and immediately noticed he was face-down on the floor. He turned his head and looked at his bed beside him.
Dracy stepped back. Startled from how rough Harry shouted. What Dracy sees is the Alpha and not Harry. The strict expression on the face and this invisible wall Dracy felt begin to distance them apart from each other and the hard clench of his jaw indicated that Harry is not pleased with her outburst. She’s not either but she’s pregnant and moody.
He gulped, hesitating for a bit moment before he gulped whatever nerves that suddenly goose him up. He closed his eyes and bit back a moan at the familiar ones that overlapped his vision. It was as intense and fiery, almost felt like he was looking at him directly.
He hated the way he was praised while his husband is being cursed. If he can have it any other way, he would pick to be cursed as well, to be hated, to be despised.
Sirius rolled his eyes, his hands not knowing where to hold onto, as he scrambled noises after noises.
Harry nibbled on his thigh as he pulled back a bit and reached for the lube in the nightstand, pouring a huge amount on his fingertips and began to circle his puckered hole, winking and clenching around nothing.
“Hmm, kitten?” Remus hands travelled along the side of his legs, sliding it up and down, feeling the soft skin that’s well taken care of with the well known Black body care.
“No one comes into my room but me. Do I need to remind you of that thrice?” he asked gravely, “Leave”
“Let go. I’ll let go but don’t stop” he submitted, hands trembling as he let it wander around Harry’s front, sliding to his pecs and toying with one darkened nipple.
Harry pushed in until he bottomed out. He gave Draco time to adjust first before he started to move, slowly, loving the way how tight Draco still is. His hole clenching around his cock and pulling him in even more.
One command, one order but Draco immediately complied. He took his blouse off and tossed it to the side.
You see when you have a perfect night, you wake up on the right side of the bed. But the problem is, the others do not.
He gasped and closed his eyes involuntarily when he felt those familiar lips nipping on his skin with no care in the world, not even for the people around them who’s too busy flashing jewelries and wealth to one another.
He felt his own temper flaring up and he glared, “Wow! Thank you for gracing me with your presence! Good day!”
There are many meanings Draco thought about the word but the warmth of his hands, the smoke and the smell of cigarette and the beauty standing in front of him caught all of his attention.
He was about to cum then when Harry stood up, rolling him to his elbows and knees. He heard the sound of Harry’s belt and the next minute, he was sliding inside him. His cock hard and thick against his tenderness.
“Sexy legs, sexytary” he whistled seductively but he’s pretty sure Draco views it nothing but an implausible perversion.
She nodded absentmindedly. Eyes looking all around the building in front of them. St. Mungos. She’s aware of their law on confidentiality but given how her name have been the center of attention and the fact that she’s Dracy, people can be mindless and invade her like they do back when she’s still in that dirty bar working.
His cock can hardly wait. He wanted to be sensually touched, be kissed like the most precious, be pounded mercilessly. He wanted Harry to crush him not with his weight but by how excellent he can fuck.
When he rode out his high, his knees gave out and he laid down beside his beloved. He gathered him on his arms as they took deep breaths. He took Draco’s wrist to rest on his chest and massaged it, “Are you hurt?”
Shock and surprised, Draco coughed. He grabbed the glass of water and raised his head to see who it was that suddenly stepped in.
His knuckles brush at her smooth cheeks. She looks lively, livelier than she was before and the glow in her presence makes those days delightful. And all those activities he got to do with her, he chuckled lowly at the thought.
Kingsley smiled and chuckled right after, “I want to say no but you have not asked for any leave for the past two years. I’m inclined to let the best man here take all the days that he needs”
“This is what you want isn’t it? Things to be a bit more exciting? Fall into your liking?” Harry chuckled, the sound going straight to Draco’s hard cock.
He was supposed to rationalize for the both of them especially when Draco cannot but he’d given away. As fucking always. How many times have he done this?
“I d-did” he stammered, eyes fluttering when Harry began to gently massage the back of his head. Fingertips dragging along his scalp in a soothing manner while the other hand snaked around his waist.
Patience. Patience. They’re both lucky Harry had long realized he harbor an unbelievably longest stretch of patience for this particular omega. It’s one of the reasons Harry managed to handle the words he had heard from him and maybe, that sexiness too.
“So, what surprise you have for the guests tonight?” Draco tried to speak, ask, something so he wouldn’t let Harry do all the talking. They cannot afford to rouse any suspicions.
She chuckled, eyes falling to look at his and Harry’s laced hands. She greeted Harry when Ginny pulled away to go greet the other ones.
The lunch went nice. The occasional talks with his father and answering some of his questions, all the while feeling the piercing stare of Remus’ on him and Draco beside him. His mother would also butt in at times to ask Draco a question, their conversations going smooth.
Draco cried out, tears cascading down his cheek. He sobbed in frustration for not getting what he wants and not having the ability to move. He tilted his head higher and tried to kiss Harry on the jaw.
He looked up and let his eyes roam to take in every contour of his face and with renewed energy, grabbed him by the nape of his neck and clashed his lips to him.
He wanted him again. Not in the same way he had this morning but that Harry from last night and maybe, even rougher if it’s possible. Right now, in the Potter house, in Harry’s bedroom, above Harry’s head, take him, pound him, fuck him in the ass, make him cum for several times until he can no longer.
Draco’s forehead creased, confusion ebbing his expression as he took a step back when Harry took a step forward. The man still have a civil smile and polite demeanor but his imposing aura contradicted all of it.
Even at such an age, Remus is still the hottest man ever to be seen in the whole Wizarding World. People may disagree but Remus will always be his choice. The cutest man he’d ever laid his eyes on. The one who can do all the fucking, take control but not restraining Sirius’ own preferences. Their story doesn’t only fall onto the lines of angst, for the challenges they have to face under his mother’s wrath accompanied by Regulus’ indifference but it also falls under every possible form.
She watched him as Harry stood up in his seat and kneeled beside her. An arm immediately encircled to her waist to pull her body close to him while the other cradled her tummy, “I’ve been an asshole, baby. Let me make it up to you”
He sighed before waving a hand to wandlessly open the window. The owl flew to his place and stretch his leg. Harry took the tied letter with one hand before thanking him, apologizing when he doesn’t have any treats to give.
“Shit, feels so good” he cannot stop moaning as Harry cupped his balls, toying and massaging it and giving it playful slaps while groaning. The vibrations sent waves of pleasure up his spine and nape, desperate to be released from the handcuffs. Wanting nothing but have his hands close to Harry's skin.
“But seriously, there might be issues and running away isn’t the solution. You’re my friend, Dray but he’s more like our superior. Until I do not hear your reason, I stand with him”
Every end of the week, Draco receives a personalized bouquet of flowers, carefully arranged with a sappy note of Harry's handwriting stashed inside it.
“Want some, daddy?” he grinned at Harry’s dark gaze, the desire and intense intent to put him in his rightful place delivered jolts through his spine and he fidgeted slightly on his spot. He wanna be so stuffed so bad but still, not today.
Dracy gulped. Thinking the way how serious his tone was with a hint of gloominess in it. Dracy wiped her eyes and pouted sadly. Is everything ruined?
“Do you want something?” he asked as they turned by the snacks section. She shook her head, unable to think of something.
“We should take extra precaution and avoid stressing the mom. No to skipping meals and make sure to eat healthy. If you think there’s a problem, owl or floo me immediately. There are chances that apparition makes the mother dizzy so if we could avoid that unless it’s a matter of urgency and emergency, we avoid”
“We need to finish this. I hate you, jerking face. You just fucking aggravate me, I wish I could just throw you outta the window” he paused, “And do fucking shut up”
Instantly, she shook her head. She cannot afford to appear in the public. A Malfoy pregnant out of wedlock? It would certainly be a topic of the century. Her palms began to sweat, remembering how alone she is. Where even is her father? He is absolutely nowhere.
But Harry’s different. He’s different. He’s cryptic and unreadable. He’s calm, collected, and too private to easily crack. He’s unreadable and mysterious. She cannot see what’s in the eyes but she can see the reflection of the depths within it. The depths where his story lies.
The look on her face was from from feral because all Harry can see was the desire seeping in her eyes, the way her breath hitched and the way her breast jiggle. Something he’s been noticing for the past few days. And if didn’t wake something inside him, he doesn’t know what to say.
“W-what I want?” she asked, not wanting to because she’s afraid to state what she wants in life ever since things have fucked up. People berated her for her desires.
"Stop this, little one" Draco stilled at Harry's cold and authorative tone and begrudgingly followed.
Harry nodded, not knowing where this is going to go. Or if she’s buying him some time to gather his thoughts.
“Come on, Dracy. Cum for me, darling” he spoke, the new endearment rolling of his tongue easily as he gripped her wrists tighter, pounding and thrusting hard.
And certainly not this, guard a pureblood child just because the pureblood parents can pay for it. It doesn't matter how much of a million they can pay him. His services aren't to be downed within the boundaries of being a bodyguard.
“Love, come on. You’ll have me later” Harry whispered, urging to pull Draco’s head away from his shoulder, “Straighten up, baby. I need to feed you first”
His ears strained trying to hear a noise, one that can indicate someone’s coming in but he cannot. Must be a soundproof then. Every minute that goes by, the anticipation starts to build into anxiousness, nausea, and flutter of a panic attack.
If Draco and Harry on the other room moans, he for sure is going to moan louder. After all, his mother did not teach him to be a sore loser. If they’re kinky, Sirius can be more. All hail to him and his husband.
She turned around and walked away from the mirror to dress. She just had finished taking a half bath to calm her anticipating nerves. She put on a simple shirt and shorts before going out of the room to begin preparing for dinner.
“Ohh!” she whimpered when he gripped her by the hips and pulled her closer to his face then she was moaning as he began to eat her like a tasteful dinner.
They watched for what felt like hours, ignoring the way Harry was still holding onto his waist and wrist. It felt nice. Hmm, yes, nice. But he’s not going to admit that. Because it's not.
“Aah, faster” she urged, trying to raise her hips to meet his thrusts but Harry pulled back and looked at her sternly, “Let me fuck you” he whispered and she was whimpering loudly as Harry suddenly set up a punishing pace.
“I’ll call Arthur or Molly, okay? Calm down. He’ll join, I know him. He’s a curious man” he kissed her by the temple and hugged her after, “Now, come along. They’ll be arriving in a minute”
Which may have gambled more than they could handle. As the newly appointed Minister of Magic, Valsken Vokbin, have said to them in different occasions,
When Harry leaned back on his chair, Draco took a breath and started to approach, making sure to stare at the man straight in the eyes as he gazed at him. His emerald eyes were intense but still held a semblance of softness. And beneath it, it held a little bit of mystery, one that Draco had a hard time reading.
He tossed the tissue along the already messily scattered around his living room and harshly tap the enter and he watched as his new blog is being published on his site. Who the hell cares if someone describes him as someone embodying pessimistic behavior? Everyone deserves to know that bastard Jake cheated on him with some bimbo on the street!
It’s intriguing. Why those hands can turn him on so much. How he finds that dark and husky voice appealing. He would do everything to hear it forever. Have it only and only will be directed to him.
The way her lips parted and blushed. The crimson color on her cheeks looks cute but ravishing enough. He wanted to let his Alpha side take over then but held himself back. It has been days since they went out, days since his mind kept on rearing back to slightly intimate moments with her. And countless nights where he had began to seek her scent and her on his side.
And he is very much happy to reap the benefits of that. He bit his bottom lip, already feeling turned on by the holy sight, his holy grail, his holy holy.
Harry caught his head with his right hand and chuckled in disbelief. Damn that appeal. Fuck. Draco Savage Malfoy is definitely a thing.
Harry was silenced for a moment. Not knowing what to answer honestly but didn’t want to worry him more than he already does so. But it wouldn’t do them good if he lies with words than admitting what should be heard.
Harry opened his eyes on alarm. He sat up abruptly, forgetting the weight above him as it fell on to the floor with a thud and a resounding
Harry’s eyebrow shot up and just then, they heard another ring of the doorbell, “Stay here. I’ll go check”
He rubbed his cock across her cunt, coating it with her juices and growling at the sensations prickling in his shaft. He clenched his jaw as he slapped her clit with his cock repeatedly, loving how she jumps at the sensations hauling her senses.
“Eyes on the mirror” he demanded darkly before grabbing her chin and pushed her to stare where Harry is already staring at, “Look at yourself writhing, Dray. Look at how pretty you are when you’re like this, how hot you look moaning”
He had an earth shattering orgasm last night and he had slept with Harry which speaking of, he smiled. He turned his head and was slightly disappointed when he found himself alone in his bed. Where is Harry? Why didn’t he wake him up?
Sirius all covered in his cum has always been a sight. But eventually, it has to be cleaned up. Abandoning his softening cock, his fingers wiped the cum off of his face before letting Sirius suck on them like he did seconds ago.
He’s got this fiery intensity and not to mention, the ability to drive everyone insane. He got this laid back aura at times but have this clawing hotness often seen at nights when he’s out there, having fun, having to bed every willing omegas out there.
“You’ve been a very bad daddy, Harry” he started, eyes not looking away from those emerald ones, “Flirting with someone when I was in the same place. You could’ve just flirted with me, touch me under the table but you didn’t” he fakes a sad tone and took a step closer.
Draco yelped when he was suddenly thrown. Eyes going wide as he took in his surroundings. He bounced on the king sized bed as Harry towered over him with a cold expression, rage filling his nostrils as he slowly began to unbutton his sleeves.
He rested his chin over his palm and waited for Ron to arrive. Fortunately enough, the man appeared within a few minutes and sat down from where Hermione sat a while ago.
And he doesn’t want to upset Dracy with emotional turmoil if he fails to meet her expectations to be her Alpha lover. Maybe marking her is something he really didn’t consider before he made a decision of getting her out of that stinky bar.
Taking a few muggle breathing exercises, Harry took a step and stirred himself towards the stairs, easily finding his name and Malfoy’s attached to the wall. His hand hesitated for a moment before he pushed the door open and walked in.
His footsteps caught Harry’s attention as he raised his head up and gave him one gentle smile, tossing the cigarette to the pavement and stomped on it with the black chelsea boots.
Harry spelled his fingers some lubricant and circled over to Draco rim, feeling the way the hole quivered against his touch. He let Draco’s cock off with a pop and roughly inserted a finger.
“We’ll have each other forever” she smiled before sealing her statement with a soft, gentle kiss on the lips.
His arms tightened around his wife as the man slowly lowered his newspaper and came in view, the man Sirius told them about.
Harry pulled away, tucking Draco’s hair behind his ear as he removed his shirt off before him. Draco gulped as he took in the blessed sight in front of him.
Claiming is easy. He can claim her in various ways but if Ron meant claiming her and bond with her is something Harry should ponder seriously. Bonding meant mating and mating meant lifetime.
He was quick to call back and delighted that Harry answered back, “Where the fuck are you, sweet? I had Blaise track your phone. We’re coming”
Harry sighed. If only it would be that easy to not worry. He’s spent years of his life doing just that, it is not so easy to give up old habits. He was pretty sure he’d also been called
“He didn’t catch you?” he took the flash drive away from him to send them to Pansy as a report later.
“Yes. Just along the corner from here.” he answered and Harry was about to speak when a woman interrupted them and handed Tom his order.
Wanna see Harry, wanna see him full of his cock, wanna see the expression on his eyes as he dazedly watch him take matters in his hand or in this case, his mouth.
She’s lost count of how many nicknames Harry had used for the last month and will surely lost count of the new ones for the next months.
Dracy smiled and was about to answer when she felt a slight wince on the underside of her boob. How bad. Sooner or later, she’s sure she’s about to lactate.
He smirked, doing exactly just that and she preened loudly, hips bucking to meet the slide of his fingers, the stretch even from just having two fingers was already too stimulating, the tightness of her pussy as it hugged him and the throbbing of her clit, she was far too deep. Too focused on the need to cum as she demanded again and again.
Dracy smiled at him almost too innocently. She looked at him while batting her eyelashes, blush tainting her cheeks. Harry clenched his jaw, eyes darkened as he realized what she wanted to do but before she could even kneel down, he quickly stopped her by her arms and shaking his head.
Draco’s lips tugged coyly while he kept his eyes innocent, “Nothing, Senator. Just having a little bit of fun”
Professor McGonagall tutted, “You have a small amount of a love potion ingredient in you, Mr. Malfoy. Not a love potion per se” she explained, “There’s no antidote to a potion you two accidentally brewed by combining Ashwinder eggs, horseradish, and pearl dust. But I assure you, it’s harmless but different”
It was no later than five pm when Harry arrived holding a stem of roses and smiling slightly at her. Hermione immediately bid her goodbyes and went home.
Being bestfriends with Prongs for years and having been beside him witnessing all the family matters he had to deal including his businesses scattered all over the country, he knows how the Potter couple works. They aren’t Lily and James on the field but Mr. And Mrs. Potter, two sides of the same coin.
As they set on walking in a normal pace, they fell into a comfortable silence. Luna have always been a cool woman. Her sense of self and the way she’s the kind of
Draco felt the heat all over his cheeks by the compliment he just had received. He’s used to receiving compliments and oftentimes, they’re backhanded but to this man, it seemed to be sincere.
"Alright, alright. Just be sure to appear on his party. I think that's a good chance to play some dare games and have you dancing wantonly in someone's lap" Pansy grinned devilishly.
. Draco fought the urge to rut his lips like a horny teenager, legs beginning to tremble with all the promises Harry was whispering add to the heat that’s coming from the larger man. The voice that sends tingles to his spine down to the crack of his ass, "You'll remember this day. Think about how you let me touch you, whisper you all the filthy things, made you my needy little slut"
And she did not deny him of that. Not if he’s making her feel this good. She had never felt so wet in her entire life and Harry haven’t reached to the serious business yet. Like fuck, her body shivered and reacted with every little thing Harry does.
Sirius whimpered, pushing himself closer to Remus, leaning satisfied with that dreamy smile plastered on his face.
Yes, the omega had stunning physical attributes, qualities that can tempt any hungry Alpha around, and drive every rutting males on the street insane. She can get easily manhandled for how frail-looking she currently is.
His jaw dropped as he took in his appearance. He was still wearing his usual leather jacket and jeans outfit but his hair have been styled and is he wearing some lip tint?
He should’ve asked Sirius or Remus for some script. Lines to tell. Yes, he admits he’s at fault too but the issue here is Draco leaving without a word. He’s eighteen for fuck’s sake! Harry was hired for a reason.
“Want to see the baby, ‘arry. Please” she forced her eyes open and he contemplated for a bit. She clearly needed to rest but he wouldn’t want to forbid her of this moment right now.
“How rough you want me to be?” he allowed himself to ask as he put pressure on his palms and pushed it over that petite frame. He can do this in any way or better yet, every way.
Draco gulped, hands trembling from their places, inching to just reach out and take what he can because
Harry shrugged easily. Ron and Hermione cannot stop asking him about Dracy and whether he thought about what she said about giving the omega a home. Truthfully he didn’t but in order to shut her up, he told her that he’s thinking about it.
It’s because Draco is nowhere in the house. The boy is nowhere in any corner of the Manor. Not in the garden, not in the living room, library, ballroom, bedroom, dining, kitchen, broom cupboard, not even under the stairs or the attic.
Harry looked over at the papers he has at his home office. The papers stack to one another as he tired to read and reread all information provided in the documents. He needs to have them sent to the Ministry urgently.
He turned his head to see Zayan looking at him in the most sexual way possible, he always have been a great actor. Zayan is a great friend who studied in Durmstrang.
“No cumming until I say so, bunny” he reminded, his fingers playing with his perineum, his touch making his skin sensitive as it prickled through his system.
He smirked as he was successful and began to walk to seek his penthouse office. It didn’t take him long to find it as he opened the first door he saw and celebrated when it was what he is looking for.
He has Harry and as for the meantime, has the three loyal staffs he has to take care of the pub. He took a deep breath and holding on to the dog tags Harry let him wear for today. He smiled around before walking out and locking the door.
She cannot believe they were performing such an act inside a place they don’t even own and rather than being disgusted, she surged on the thought. She whined, hands tightening at Harry’s shirt as she occasionally pulled on it.
But fuck, Harry is 30 and Draco is probably still on his teens. It's obvious that Harry shouldn't be admiring something that is forbidden in the House of Potter. He shouldn't think how his hair complimented his color well and it would look great against Harry's skin. He shouldn't think how innocent those silvery eyes are, innocent but definitely indecent. He shouldn't think how his petite body will go greatly above him. He shouldn't think how he looks gorgeous in that dress and shouldn't wonder how he would look in a tight skirt. He shouldn't think how much purity Draco emanates in his being and shouldn't wish to corrupt every root of his integrity and morality.
She whined and hugged her pillow. She knows Harry must be looking where his dinner is or maybe breakfast, or his lunch or whatever because she’s not aware what time it is already. The last thing she can remember was she was reading a book about muggle fantasy. It amazes her how muggles can think of something so magical despite being clueless.
Harry kept what happened a secret for the next two weeks. All of them adjusting to the new school year with a lot harder subjects and more advanced studies they needed to master.
Harry had impulsively called in a date night right after their cuddle time session. Which may not really be a date night when the others have invited themselves.
Oh, shit. This is almost as good as his intense orgasm. He smiled and went to open drawers and looking through the folders stacked at the desk. He looked around for anything useful until he came across a brown envelope that has a label that came as ‘Senatorial Plans’.
Draco slowly opened his eyes, blinking the bleariness away as he took in his surroundings. He freaked out a little when he saw an unfamiliar bedroom. Until what happened before slowly started to flash through his consciousness.
"This is where the library is. Thousands of books if you want, many of which are from my favorite writer Valsken Vokbin, have you read his new book entitled 'Love between boundaries'?"
Dracy’s eyes turned to Harry at the question. That’s something she wanted to ask from him but decided not to when she saw Harry put the crib in his room. She was expecting that Harry wants the baby in the same room as his and who is she to complain if he wants that?
“Why aren’t you asleep yet?” Harry asked as he walked inside the common room, finding Draco hurdled over the couch, staring at the fireplace.
He felt so heavenly. Harry’s mouth is hot and so good. Merlin, he’d never felt this way before. Only Harry can give the real man experience and he knew only he can sate what he realized will be and currently is, insatiable.
Harry finished his song and waited until he can feel Draco's breath has evened out before he slept as well.
“It is why it’s called Spear’s Gamble, you idiot!” he said, finally gotten a hold of his wand and casted his own refreshing spells, doubling Harry’s efforts.
She whined, taking all strength she can and pulled the shirt off of her, grunting in annoyance when it stuck on her head.
“Doll, get down” he said with absolute patience as he ignored the gossips that is surely going to breakdown The Daily Prophet tomorrow and knock Diagon Alley in insanity.
He took a step closer then another then another until the man raised a hand and signaled him to stop. He did instantly. But he wanted to step back when that feeling came back, stronger and pulsing like blood rushing through his veins.
His breathing is shallow as his nails dig into Remus’ muscles. The electricity he can feel from their fucking is sending jolts not only to his own neglected cock but to his heart as well, swelling for the love he has for his husband.
She smiled, “Yes, please” she quickly answered, questions of what he’s been doing flew out of her mind.
Harry sighed and even though he knew this was going to happen, he began to stare at the moving picture of him and Draco talking to one another.
The Weasley Twins took it upon their duty to be in place by the bar and served everyone their drinks, Draco’s close friends on the gang, Pansy and Blaise settled with their love ones, Hermione and Ron. Some other men letting their girlfriends sit on their laps and some others started to play cards.
He sobbed even more when Harry merely chuckled at his desperation, “Isn’t this what you want, kitten?”
Draco pouted, letting go of his stuffie. His delicate fingers began to trace shapes and numbers in Harry's shoulder, "Miss you Daddy. Let's go sleep, already?"
“Fuck, so tight, kitten” Remus grunted, his hips rolling slowly, trying to get used to the way Sirius is clenching around him, still wet from their morning fuck.
Dracy moaned at the words as his mouth went to suck on a nipple. And just the feel of the touch had her feeling slightly better. She wouldn’t tell it to Harry but these past few days, she have grown irritable at the new sensations on her chest.
Draco gulped, eyes wide as he took in Harry’s appearance, closer than a second ago. He was even more handsome up close, really broad and surely, the strength in those muscles can do whatever they like.
Tom snarled and was about to go attack him when Harry grabbed the collar of his shirt and delivered one strong punch to the face, followed by a kick on his stomach.
The way those hands will grope her like no other and softly cradle her stomach after, not failing to coo at it and kisses all over the part. She remembered she was giggling before they both let sleep take them, in the arms of each other.
He cannot stop looking at her breast, the milk sliding down to the side of her breast and it was such a sight that Harry wasn’t able to control himself. He stick his tongue out to catch the milk, gathering it inside his mouth and groaning at the taste.
Two years ago, at age eighteen, Draco is the flavor his dull life was looking for. Having no fun at all, his time buried in work, almost have no control of his life at all.
Of course because he was busy showing off those goods. Draco gulped but before he could say anything else, he saw something locked around his wrist.
He soon realized they have arrived at the dining. When he looked around, he saw various meals placed on the long dining table with porcelain plates and all and more drinks than necessary.
He needed Harry to open him up, stretch him so good and fill him up full. He needed to have him completely.
“They do because in this scenario, you’re a cheating bastard and you’re sleeping in the couch!” he messed with his hair and lifted Harry’s luggage and threw it to him, “You’re not sleeping in here with me”
There was a chuckle and there was this strange tingling in Draco’s stomach. He needs a drink. Or maybe he fucking needs to pee.
Harry did not respond but he hummed, squeezing their interlaced hands and slowly increasing his pace before gradually returning to normal had Draco’s cock throbbing inside that wet heat.
He shoved her bra up, not bothering to remove it from her body as he lavished her perky nipple with attention. His mind imagining that day it’ll be so full of milk. He groaned at the idea, matching Dracy’s moans.
“Cum inside me, Harry. Want you to fill me, please” she whispered seductively in his ear. She turned her head to nuzzle his neck and peppered it with kisses and gently nips, “Harry”
“That’s it, love. Your pussy is adjusting so nice. Tight around me but I will loosen it up for you, would you like that? Would you like Daddy to finger your pussy and make you cum?”
The silence that followed was nothing of appreciation or understanding. His friends looked at him as if he was way out of his mind. Disbelief written on their faces as they waited for Draco to drop the bomb and tell them he was only joking.
Draco cried out as his hips buckled before coming into a stop. His cock bobbed as he came messily across his stomach, chest and Harry’s torso.
He felt kisses on either of his ass cheeks before Harry pulled away and stood up. He gently turned Draco around to face him and smiled down at him.
"My bedroom, Harry. As my guard, don't you think you should see every corner of the Manor including my bedroom?"
He gulped and stood up. He wished he had a peak hole but no, he has to open the door to see who’s. Taking a deep breath, he willed himself to relax and he was wrong.
He tilted his head and stared in awe, the magnificence of a man. The one he had dubbed to have the savior’s complex. But he wasn’t wrong, Harry did kind of save him. He saved him and now, doing things for him.
“Harry” she moaned when she started to feel this unknown one that tightens her insides and a fuzzy feeling swirling inside her head. She gripped his arms and looked up at him to see him already looking down at her, “Fuck. So good. So good” Harry whispered and brushed his nose to her cheek.
He made the bold move to ease his own hand up to the senator’s thigh, nails digging to his inner thigh. With bated breath, he let it rest inches before his cock. His palm rubbed at the spot leniently, keeping what was happening under the table.
Draco was shocked when Harry instantly turned his demeanor back into being the Head Auror. No pillow talk, no post-sex kisses.
She looked back and gasped when she saw him staring intently before completely disappearing from view.
She chuckled as his fingers tickled her side and lightly squirmed at her spot. She wasn’t always ticklish but her pregnancy have made her to feel slightly ticklish than usual.
“Please, please” she plead, unable to brace herself on the sink and decided to lace it around Harry’s biceps.
His body jolted as his orgasm took him by surprise, spurting streaks of cum down Harry’s throat who happily swallowed all. Not letting a bit get past his mouth. He lapped at his spent cock, pulling back before sliding his tongue all the way to the bottom to make sure he’s all cleaned before finally, letting go of his softening dick.
He’s very excited for this night. It was so incredibly easy to convince Harry to go to the bar. After giving himself one last once-over, he heard a buzz from his door.
“You’re one to talk! How dare you!” he snapped angrily. He can feel his rage bubbling up inside him!
“Go to your room and I’ll bring you your sobering potion” Harry spoke when Draco didn’t answer his question but sobbed.
He was speechless. He didn’t know what to say or how to decide but when his mind screamed to join him, he sat down beside him on the floor and took the book away from him. Ignoring the searing sensation inside him that felt as if it was quelled with its desire. He also tried to ignore how close they seem to one another as they fell into silence.
He gulped. Unable to pick one instantly. What’s it for anyway? If he pick the former, he’s still bound to this obsessive behavior that ties him inside the cabin. If he pick the latter, one can obviously see it is still a punishment. A much more endearing punishment Draco wasn’t sure he will hate or he will love.
He felt so ridiculous when his parents nodded in confirmation. His head cannot grasp this idea at all. None of these make any sense.
She bit her bottom lip and looked back at him before she hesitantly nodded, “I wanna go along with you. I’m going to be beside you all the time”
His fingers danced along the strong thighs, skimming along the expensive material of his trousers, nails grazed along the expanse as it danced in time of the speech before them. Draco sat beside the Senator, he had made sure to book the seat when he learned Senator Harry is coming to join the silly nonsense event of the elites.
If only Harry had checked the ingredient twice and Draco checked it for the third time if it was really a squill bulb— then they wouldn’t have this problem now. Their thoughts falling to one another, thinking the unimaginable.
He took his time. Hands peeling his jacket off and removing his waistcoast after until he’s left of his sleeves, ties and trousers.
Remus grinned, “Come here” he said, chuckling when Sirius was fast to crawl on his knees until he was close for Remus to touch.
Dracy stared at her reflection in the mirror. She had been standing in front of the mirror and staring the changes she’d noticed on her body physically.
Draco is drooling. He felt himself gulped from the morning view that greeted him when he awoke by the sound of Harry opening his bedroom door a little louder than necessary. That body is a wonderland. It's a magic on its own. Harry really is perfect and his past lovers or sexual partners must be left utterly satisfied. Draco frowned at the thought. He didn't quite like the idea of Harry bedding other people. He should be exclusive and highly confidential. Not just for anyone because that body is luxurious, expensive, extremely high-end.
Draco told him he'll come to the party and he can only imagine what wild things the youngsters have prepared to enjoy the night. And what plot Draco has in his mind to rattle every bit of Harry's reserve.
“Daddy” Draco tilted his head back but his eyes stayed to Harry eyes and puckered his lips, “Ooh, please”
Her heart fluttered and she sighed gratefully, leaning her back on his chest and tilting her head to look at the man who was nothing but a man of pain. She knew he is now very willing to move on and be a better alpha for her.
"Bloody hell. I should've check it twice" Draco pouted, playing it cool and fighting a smile. He walk towards the door before finally smiling at Harry.
He’s acting all this mighty as if his sudden disappearance without a proper explanation is okay. Huh! Harry must think he’s easy!
He felt like suffocating by the sound of that voice, feeling strong arms holding him firmly as he let another sob wrecked through his whole being.
She turned around, throwing her arms around Harry and sobbing. Fuck these hormones but fuck Harry more.
Harry’s kissed were rough to the point he can taste a bit of Draco’s blood but both of them didn’t complain.
. Dracy’s eyes widened and a red taint have the bravery to appear on her cheeks. She knew everyone would be having their own conclusions and no sooner than later, she’ll be the protagonist of tabloids again.
Draco huffed when Dobby started to beat himself with the plate on his hand. He grabbed the plate away from his hands and spoke, “I forbid you to beat yourself. Understand?”
He tilted his head, looking at the sky as they settled down the open field, waiting for the promised meteor shower to rain. He was wrapped up in Harry’s embrace, hands cased between Harry’s to give some heat. He offered his mittens to which he decline, wanting nothing more but Harry’s physical touch.
To say that Dracy was shock is an understatement. Her eyes glued to the spot Harry was just standing a second ago as she momentarily forget the pain she’s experiencing right now.
"I just need to tell them I will be going home first to grab some things" Harry informed, his voice more restrained than usual.
She didn’t know how long they were walking around before they walked to the counter where more wizards and witches are gathered in, looking at them and eyeing her almost dirtily. She was sure if there isn’t a certain Harry Potter beside her, people would have been spitting batshit words against her and her runaway father.
They cheered and inspected the thing. And when Draco saw the lot taking their wands out, he stared horrified. He took his own wand out and summoned all of their wands to him.
His eyes traveled down and grinned when he saw a bulge so good in the eyes. He surely caused that. And it showed that Harry's been standing there long enough to elicit such reaction.
Could it be the dom stood him up? Someone who doesn’t swing his way? Disappointed? Dislikes him? Or is he really too stiff? Too uptight?
One that doesn’t normally appear in The Daily Prophet as it was much more interested in writing about his family’s tragedy, his possible lovers and concluding that he might already have the ‘special’ one because they haven’t seen him with anyone else.
He also saw a bottle of perfume in the bedside table. It smelled strong and distinctly Harry and Draco had a thought that maybe the perfume is specifically made just for him.
She was slowly taking a walk while keeping her eyes on him. The glint in her eyes held the expectations of awaiting victory and he gave her this moment to think she will.
He cracked then. He exploded and he kissed him. He kissed him so hard, he tastes the young blood and fucking hell.
He was standing in the other side of the common room talking with Parkinson animatedly and Harry’s forehead knotted in confusion when he realized he’d been staring.
He sighed and faked a smile to Flitwick who huffed and walked away, letting the Headmistress fixed the ugly decorations.
He had Cho Chang in the same age and a woman. A decent woman. He had Ginny Weasley a year younger than him. A beautiful and independent woman. He had Penelope Ashgrey two years younger than him. A strong woman. And just five months ago, he had Greene Blue a year older than him. All possessed their own qualities that had Harry interested.
Harry felt Draco come up beside him and he hastily closed the folders. "These are not for the public, Draco. These are confidential" he informed and Draco hummed in response and sat down in front of him, holding a cup of hot tea.
A person who never has to work a day in his life oozes with appeal and strut around like he owns the world. He wore his crown like pride and confidence like his jewelry. He never is bad of anything, everything he can do.
No matter how much Dracy’s mind shouted she is not a property, there was nothing she could do anymore. She had lost her freedom the moment her family broke apart.
And even when Draco didn’t want to, he salivated at those muscles and that aura to walk out so sexily. It’s no lie that Harry is extremely hot and still a very powerful man under that playboy exterior and just that knowledge is enough to keep Draco in his knees—toes, in his toes.
“Daddy will spoil you, little one. Over and over. I will taste every bit of you until you’re sated, floating in your space then later today, fuck you hard on the floor, in every surface I could get you on”
He only needed to wait for a minute or two. Some customers looking out the windows and talking to one another about the arrival of the infamous bikers.
“Come on, kitten. Need to see you cum” Remus whispered huskily, continuing his endless dirty talks. Ones that never failed to elicit such vulgar reactions out of him.
Just what in quidditch’s name happened? He knew it was a wrong idea to pair him with Potter in the first place. He was aware the man is hopeless in Potions and Professor Slughorn must think it’s something funny.
Harry gave one powerful thrust before he stilled, bottoming his cock and spurts of cum shoot out inside Draco. He slowly buck his hips in and out to let all his seed out and slumping his weight on his angel after.
“Get up for me, my sweet. Get up” he tenderly prompted, lightly tugging at his hands. Draco whined before he tried to. He managed mid-way before he felt like sagging if not for Harry’s agile reflexes and catching the boy by his waist.
He didn’t bother to answer but gasped when he felt himself being lifted up easily. His legs moved on instinct and locked them around Harry’s sturdy waist before he sat on the chaise lounge, letting Draco sit astride his lap.
“Are you going to be my good boy now, baby? I want you to be my good boy” he whispered and his eyes flashed dangerously when Draco didn’t answer.
But as he stares at Draco smiling and joking around, shadowed nicely by the faint sunset, orange hue coloring his pale skin— Harry wanted to capture it. Every detail of his beauty be soiled in something everlasting, be painted for it is deserved. Wanted to memorize how lovely it is to stare at Draco this way.
Draco isn't a kid but he's young. Young in a way that would be a devious sin. Young in a way that would be a delicious mistake. Young in a way that would be a worthy second. And most, young in a way that would be tasty.
He smirked and unlocked the door, to breathe fresh air, only it didn’t budge like he expected it to. His brows furrowed as he made sure it really was unlocked and tried to push and pull.
and firm. All power displayed visibly as it echoed through his being, shooting tingling sparks to his stomach down to his cock.
“Yes. Some biker gang just tried to mess with us but nothing to worry. We got this, go see your lover boy”
Sirius’ mind felt like splitting in two, staring straight in his eyes, they looked at one another. Remus’ gaze was hot, firing him with intensity, steam, and overflowing stimulation as his own gaze felt soft to Remus’ eyes, his eyes were glassy with tears, begging, drawing him in as he clenched around Remus’ thick monster cock.
He had blow dried his hair, put on some light blush and lipstick. He grabbed his tight leather pants that accentuates his buttocks and a simple pink crop top before grabbing his pumps. He smiled seductively and laughed.
Alone at the house, she contemplated what to do. She wasn’t in the mood to do anything right now but she needed something to pass the time. Grabbing a book from the library, she laid on the couch and began to read.
He half expected him to be upset for having to keep this thing a secret. But oh well, aside from the title, he knows Prongs is quite kind. If not, dashingly beautiful.
Thankfully, Luna did not bother him of her mysterious statements yesterday. They simply bonded like old friends and conversed about how the bracelet looked nice on him. He agreed at some point, only because it looked nice on Harry.
He wanted to be a princess, not a prince. He wanted to be a girlfriend and not a boyfriend. He wants his future to be called a wife and not a husband. He wanted to be taken care of, to be cuddled between a man's legs, he wanted to sit in someone’s lap, wanted to be carried and wanted to be taken on dates.
Although he did not meant to be vulnerable like that, he didn’t regret speaking up. It had a nice feeling when he let the words out. He didn’t understand why but it felt nice.
What was starting to became anxiousness went back to anticipation, a sprinkle of excitement and little bit of hustling fun experience. He stopped until he was few inches away from him, “Well,”
He didn’t know what he was doing nor did he stop to think about what he was saying. He just knew he has to please the person who robbed him of his freedom so could earn it back.
“That’s it,” Harry agreed, “That’s it. Let ‘em out, baby. Let those pretty little noises out. Wanna hear ‘ya moaning for me. Hear the effect I have on you”
“You’re going?” Ron asked in surprise as they settled at Weasley Twin’s apartment— just above their joke shop, “I thought you received an invitation from Robards as well for Auror training?”
“Hmm” Dracy whimpered, tensing in his arms and Harry groaned and helped her to move her hips harder and thrusted his hips upwards to meet hers and after a few seconds, Dracy shivered and tensed.
Fuck these pregnancy hormones. She had found she wanted to kick him in the balls but wanted his hug as well.
“You’re staring again” Pansy’s voice rang from his left side as they sit at the Quidditch stands, watching at the friendly match Harry and co was playing against the seventh year Gryffindor students.
“Be with me. Will you, alpha?” she asked so sincerely that a real smile blossomed on Harry’s face and for the first time ever, he blushed.
Harry is so hot. Draco sighed and attempted to calm himself. He is so turned on. He wants more. More, more, more. He wants to feel Harry’s hands and lips everywhere on his body. His palms on his ass, his lips on his, to his neck, to his nipples to his cock and to his ass. He wants to sit on his lap, he wants his fingers to open him up, feel how fast and deep they can go. He wants everything about Harry. Draco longs for the man in him. The man that Harry is.
“Little prongs! Nephew!” Sirius stood up, giving Draco a hug before engulfing Harry in a tight embrace and whispering over his ear, “Bendy, right?”
The man took the cigarette between his surprisingly red lips, taking a mouthful and puffing out in a controlled manner.
“Harry” Remus called him and leaned on the kitchen counter facing him, “You’ve been silent for hours. Sirius told me yesterday you have something to talk about. It’s already lunch and you still didn’t speak”
He gurgled an incoherent phrase when he felt Harry pecked a kiss on his lips, hands massaging his hips, “Still ready to take my cock, doll?”
He breathed heavily as he lied there. Eyes closed and trying to regain his normal breathing. Fuck. That was so good.
He sighed at his meal, sitting alone at the table as Pansy fooled with his girl friends at the Black lake.
"I think I'll go look around the whole area" Harry stood up and is about to walk away when Draco stood up and stopped him. "Why don't I show you around, Harry? After all I should be hospitable enough to tour you around"
“I want you, yes” he paused, his tongue peeking out as he licked a striped in Draco’s clavicle, “I want you so I’ll have you in the way I fucking want”
“And you know how omegas are, bud. They never ask unless it’s what they really need and want to. You must have been an amazing alpha partner. She needs you and trust me, you’ll regret it if you don’t”
Harry deliberately lightened up his expression and smirked deviously because two can play a fucking game, “Come in then,
“You’ll be fully stuffed of my cock for the rest of the night, little one. Warming it up until the next day, you’ll be ready to take it. Begging for me to make you cum, drooling, desperate, trembling, so full of love bites”
He has messy hair, with eyeglasses and a nicely trimmed beard. He was wearing a navy blue threepiece suit without a tie, his wrist sporting an expensive watch as he stood on his feet, the woman on his left side following. The woman had a red hair and Lucius wouldn’t deny the beauty she possess but Narcissa is much more of his kind of beauty.
Both kneeled on the bed. He did not falter as the other hand slid down to her pussy and began to draw circles on her clit. She gripped his arm that’s on her waist and tugged on it. Harry understood what she wanted and he gently wrapped it around her throat, gripping it not too tight but enough to ground her.
There was silence that followed and Harry spoke before Remus could lecture him for it, “I know you’ll tell me that I shouldn’t but I did. And I'm kind of, sort of—no. I'm utterly freaking out"
Harry stayed at her neck for a few minutes before pulling back. Dracy gasped when he lifted her off of the floor and helped her encircle her legs around his waist.
Upon arriving back at the department, he saw Draco munching on the chocolates while doing his work. He smiled at the sight. He wasn’t kidding when he called Draco sugar. He’s sweet on his own way.
“Get on, Potter. I know how horrible you are with Potions. Just hand me the ingredients, will you?” he didn’t snarl but his tone was biting enough.
Harry regarded him as if he grew two extra heads, “Yes. And don’t call me loose asshole, sweetling. I am anything but I am not a bottom”
He felt a hand in his chest, fingers rolling his nipples between them, pulling and tugging on it as teeth dug its way to the other, “Tastes so good”
“Ssh” the man shushed, thumb wiping the tears that’s continuously sliding down to his cheeks, “You’re hurt, love. You’re frustrated”
He barely made it six steps when she huffed and rolled her eyes, “And if I want to?” she challenged, successfully stopping the man from completely retreating, “Pay for it that is”
One glass of wine turned into two to three to four until he controlled himself for the fifth one. He needs to ‘cause he cannot afford to do something so rash because his eyes suddenly decided Harry looked like a tasty loaf of bread, smells like a newly baked goods, delicious strawberry tart.
He lied there, breathing heavily. He felt fingers collecting the cum on his stomach before he felt those wet digits over his mouth. He opened his mouth and without being told what to do, he sucked the fingers, his tongue wiping the cum off as he moaned, tasting himself. Hearing the lewd noises it created as he lick Remus’ fingers, lapping all of his cum.
Harry got in after. He sat behind her and pulled her body to his. He kissed her shoulder blades as he massaged her wrist.
Draco had the urge to give it all and just let go. Maybe for one night, he can cross those lines he set for himself. Maybe he can ignore them, forget about them. Maybe he can let loose for a few hours or for a selfish flash of moment.
But he cannot focus because his mind keeps on going back to that moment when he held her skin, his fingers feeling how smooth it was despite the rough and heartless months she’s been suffering from having less than what she was accustomed to.
“So beautiful for me, kitten” Remus praised and it was all he needed. So beautiful only for Remus, his Remus.
The windows were opened and curtains drawled to the side. He can make out a wide array of space in Tom’s apartment, not too much furniture and other than that, he doesn’t know what else is there.
The excitement that’s not normally seen on the Wizarding World, considering how strict their mother is and how restricted Regulus is, he saw it from James. His muggle bestfriend that’s definitely not lesser than a wizard.
She hesitated. Heart beginning to race with her thoughts. This is where she makes a decision. This is where she’ll be giving up her teasing and all of her fire. Fuck, what would it be?
“Yes, yes. I get your point. Why don’t you go over there and show him what happens if Draco is jealous” Blaise creep in beside him, smirking and urging him by waving his hand.
He wasn’t able to answer as Harry pulled him to kiss. Draco moaned and hugged him, lips moving in sync.
Dracy closed her eyes as she savored the sensations. She can feel Harry’s huge cock and the knot filling her up even more. She smiled. Merlin. That was utterly perfect.
Harry leaned on the wall and contemplated his whole life. Never in his life he encountered something this hard. Fuck. He’s righteous. Why cannot Draco see that? Why can’t he convince himself to still be righteous?
He was sipping on his coffee and trying to control his thoughts when the boy who walked into his life and apparently, his dreams, walked in. He was about to ignore him and he thought he can but when he saw Draco’s innocent smile, his mind and cock recalled the dream he just had.
In the past few weeks, Harry had started to read her stories before bedtime. Though it was dedicated to their growing baby. From time to time, they would both lay their palms on her stomach, waiting for the sudden kick that would arrive, the little movement that will not fail to bring joy.
He's just gonna stay at their house and occasionally visit Pansy and Blaise and have parties. So what kind of harm will arrive? Nothing because Draco can kick some serious balls if people try to harm in any way.
“You’re beautiful” he complimented completely out of the blue. He was not really conscious of what came out of his mouth as he continued to stare that’s beginning to be borderline creepy.
They now settled at the living room, sitting across another. He had his whole attention to her but she wasn’t looking back. She’s just looking down and Harry slightly pitied her for it.
But, Draco is fucking hard to resist. The way he would walk near him and the way he drunkenly sob when he can no longer hold himself, he begged Harry to touch him, make him his. No matter the age gap, regardless of the principles and rules Harry set for himself, regardless of decency and rationality, regardless of all that's holding him back in tasting him.
That rough voice with a certain thick accent he couldn't quite classify is something quite unique and Draco found himself drawn in. That sound is fucking good.
Kingsley had a look of surprise before his stare turned into a questioning one, “Is something the matter?”
His nails scratched at the wall. Harry licked around his rim, tongue teasing and mocking. He moaned and tried to hold himself up, fight the urge to clasp his hands on that glorious mane and follow what was ordered to him.
How is this the same person he used to bicker with? They’re both different now. Both different growing adults that managed to fit with each other amidst whatever conflict they may have had. Despite their irregularities, it was somehow so right to have him
Headache. That's what's Harry's starting to feel. What was the other things the House of Potter taught him? A fucking gentleman. Be a gentleman and be courteous as fuck.
She gulped and toyed with her fingers. There are a lot of possibilities that could happen and she doesn’t think she can handle to be outside with Harry, the whole world to see and newly gossip about.
“What are you doing?” he tried to hide his nerves, the peculiar beating of his chest was in no way provided answers to his unsaid queries. What the fuck is happening?
. That’s his statement before, isn’t it? He hinted at it. He needed someone. How could she be so dumb not to comprehend?
Dracy didn’t know how but she felt amazing. She felt so good and nice. His fingers inside her started to scissor her open, all the while fucking her. She kept on moaning, the possibility of having to see and personally experience what she’d heard from other people is exciting her.
He gulped, fighting a whimper in his throat. His hands scramble to steady himself causing is palms to land on Harry’s chest and it was strong, too strong. He stumbled back and spluttered.
“And what are you doing here?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow though the way his chest heaved told Harry otherwise.
Dracy cried out at the feel of his wet tongue licking at her nipple. It was all too stimulating and only if she can find the energy, she knew she would’ve been humping on the bed right now. The itch was still there but as Harry proceeded to intentionally scratch his beard on her nipple, she gasp and trembled.
Perhaps this was the start of what McGonagall said ‘acting a bit strange’. But no, it wasn’t just that. He’s thinking a bit strange because not only twice he caught himself raking his eyes over Harry’s, letting his gaze wander and take the view in front of him.
And being one influential Harry James Potter, he made sure to land himself the kind of Omega that can treat to his needs. Not just sexually but physiologically and definitely not emotionally. That’s out of bounds. The omega will just have to keep his Alpha traits at bay. Her scent can relax him especially when he wanted to be wild or reckless or in some secretive words, suffering with the issues inside him.
When she was all tucked in, Harry dressed into his pants and swing the shirt over his shoulders. He eyed the woman and smiled, he really doesn’t know how to say no without offending the omega so he just bent down and kissed her on her forehead, to her nose, to her lips.
Andy smiled at the sight before clearing her throat, “I know this is a very private matter, Sir Potter. I assure you no one would hear about this”
Oh, fuck. Draco moaned loudly, his breaths coming in and out fast. His nails dug through Harry’s flesh and no doubt leaving marks on its wake.
Draco has a small smile on his parted lips, panting and gasping now and then. Harry began to make his way to his boyfriends cock, starting to nudge to his balls, softly playing with them on his fingers, earning a nice little whimper.
“G-green! Keep, fuck, going, please” Draco answered as best as he can. His mouth hanging loosely as Harry began to fuck him with his fingers relentlessly, prodding at his prostate then avoiding it for the next minute.
“Doll!” he approached, sporting his wank-material smile as he handed Draco the sweets, “I was thinking if we could go grab some nice lunch?”
Ron gave an awkward wave, Hermione studied him and Blaise smirked at him, “It’s nice to put a face on a name. I’ve heard a lot of things about you”
Yes, karma for annoying Ron. He just got burned. Someone call the fire ward. He just got his soul fucking burned. Ah, fucking straight to third degree burn.
He opened his eyes at the sudden thought. Carefully tilting her head up and he stared. Eyes admiring the view. From her eyelashes to the smoothness of her cheeks to the loveliest of lips. The woman who listened.
As days pass by, she would not deny the gnawing anxiousness inside her. For this being her first time pregnancy, she was very adamant she’ll be a good mother but Harry had assured her that everyone starts somewhere and this, this is where they do.
Draco let a lone tear out of his eyes before the others followed then he was sobbing. He cannot believe this huge man can be so sweet, so effortful, so kind to him.
Harry smiled at his work before slowly thrusting his fingers in and out to let her ride out her orgasm. He lapped all of her come before he pulled away and sliding up to her tummy and peppering it with kisses,
“Just so you know, I never do things without consent, Draco especially with omegas” he said seriously. It doesn’t annoy him when people call him playboy but surely, he finds it somehow offensive when they assume he’s some kind of an asshole who doesn’t know what consent is.
His fingers dug at the side of her hips, pulling her flush to his hard body. She moaned at his already hard cock pressing into her butt and whimpered when he began to roll his hips.
“Come on, kitten. Fuck, clenching around me so tight. Doing so good and begging so beautiful, bunny” Harry whispered roughly, harsh breaths puffing out of his chest as he stared at the pretty sight before him. Draco’s tears wetting the blindfold followed by the moans falling from his mouth. And it was such a glorious sight.
So whenever he could, he allowed himself to bask in the things Harry gives him. Whenever he has time to act, he enjoyed those fingers, that mouth, that tongue. He let him take him in any way Harry wanted and although it pained him to remain mute, he never speak up.
Harry shrugged but nodded in agreement. He encircled one arm around her shoulder and fell into a comfortable silence. He felt like he haven’t seen her for years too. For how busy they seemed to have become with their own kind of company.
Senator Harry was talking to some of his associates, obviously going over some things in the office as they eat their lunch. There were two men and one bushy haired woman with a stern expression on her face.
Harry helped her get into the hospital bed and guided her to lie down. He grasped her hand as Andy asked for permission to hike her blouse up before she get on with her work. She flick her wand and began to chant some incantations Dracy had never once encountered in her life before.
Dracy pouted, “I want to” she whispered, “Please, Harry?” she begged because she knows how her words of plea have such an effect on him.
He bit his lips as they walked to the car. There was still the apparent mischief in his eyes but it had faltered a bit when he saw how tense Harry’s shoulders are and how tight he was holding his wrist.
He wore a black ripped jeans that's a little tight to the ass, a fitted plain black shirt, and his chelsea boots. He let his hair messy and sprayed some perfume before going out of his bedroom.
He glared at the Potter spouses, not appreciating the question and surely, whatever reason is behind it.
It was by far too intimate to care for anything. Not just physically but for the moment they are both sharing and are both mentally and emotionally present. Dracy realized something more.
The flowers, the dresses, the attention, all of the spoiling. He was so needy and Harry was so kind he never get tired of giving what Draco wanted.
She hasn’t really been in the public much since Harry took her out to Diagon Alley and she’s not complaining. To stay inside the comfort of Harry’s house is enough for her. She wouldn’t trade it for going out but circumstances have made her compromise.
Now, the question is, who’s the boss here? Because the way this sweet omega glares at him seems like such a boss move. There’s no problem really. Harry likes an independent omega, strong, resilient, unable to be taken by a futile arrow of nonsense.
The lot stopped on a nearby tree shed, taking their places to sit down. Seamus and Dean challenging the others a game of Gobstones.
Harry sighed. Why is it so hard to try to talk to one person? He just yelled at a lot of Aurors days ago. Though the situation is different. This is much personal.
For others, marking may be a necessity. But for her, her love and his love would be enough to tie them together.
He is officially corrupted by his own mind, of his own sexual urges. Fucking hell! He groaned and stood up.
Why was it so hard to crack Harry’s control? He has been doing his best and everything. He tried so hard to break in, destroy the binds that’s holding Harry back. And overall, have him.
Draco felt half of his sanity flew away when he finally sheathed his cock inside, stretching him widely. Harry bucked his hips slowly, “Color, baby boy?”
The one he dreamt he kissed. The one that kissed his forehead. The one he imagined would feel nice with his own. He's probably being too unrealistic but being near him like this was taking things out of his control.
Draco sobbed, desperate to do just that as his pace falter. The familiar recoil on his stomach surging to his balls, he whined loudly and let go. He spurted his cum on his skirt and his lace panties that were now drenched in his own juices. He moaned or probably screamed, as white dots invaded his sight and his mouth hang open.
Draco raised a hand and it was him who hold Harry by the cheeks, he smiled and brush a strand of his infamous rat’s nest away from his forehead, his fingers caressed the scar.
He turned him around once more, his chest pushed flushed to Harry’s. Draco buried his face in his chest, loving the immediate comfort it gave but moaning helplessly as he felt him pried his ass open, fingers easily finding his hole clenching around nothing.
Dracy moaned at the glint on the alpha’s eyes. They were almost dark but never scary. She was instantly wet at the sound of his voice and the unrelenting hands that touched her wherever it could.
He wanted to ask, wanting to prod whatever it is Luna means but fought not to. Harry forced himself to nod as he toned down the noises around him.
“Take a seat for a few question before I get you checked” she motioned to the guest chairs, “So, when was the discovery?”
Seriously? All these paper works and meetings and whatnot?! It would be better if he just applied to be a bartender. Serving drinks and serving looks.
Draco felt a throb inside him. He crossed his arms and tried to distract himself from the blossoming
But if he doesn’t win this, he’ll still get all the kisses he wants from the enemy. No one can say no to him, not even those goddamn lips of the modern generation. He smirked and hid from view, inspecting for security cameras, maids, or any shadow.
Draco moaned, hips rutting unceremoniously to try to get something, feel something from a man whose name is the only thing he knows but fuck, it felt as if he knows all things he can and he should. There’s this invisible pull he feels, the call, the ties. There’s something in Harry his body reacted from.
He sighed. He’s getting used with Luna popping out of nowhere. Considering she’s Ginny’s girlfriend, he knows he’ll be seeing her a lot more in the future.
“Alpha” he moaned, his nails digging as he his body moved up alongside Harry’s hard pounding. His hands supporting himself as to not crush Draco under him as he writhed and squirmed at the blissful stimulation.
“I’m sorry for making you think I am disgusted” he kissed her chest and played with her nipples. He bit and sucked on them and Dracy had felt little milk coming out of her breast. She moaned and gripped his back tight.
I have chapter 5 finished which is a lot shorter than this but I'm thinking of editing and adding some stuff in it to set the mood (I have no idea what mood I'm talking about but maybe just for the sentiment haha)
“I’ll come back tomorrow with them in tow” Sirius delightedly bid his goodbyes before apparating in front of them, smirking the way James spluttered and nearly fell off his seat.
He bit his lips and impatiently waited, “D-daddy” he closed his eyes when he felt a hand touched him on his ankle, the fingers gliding smoothly around the area, gently caressing it and coaxing more mewls on his side.
Harry regarded him for a minute, making sure he wasn't going anywhere. After a while, he nodded and went outside to begin his warding process.
The man is practically walking around with oozing appeal. The way he still held humbleness but with careful spot of pride. There is more with Potter the moment their eyes met and that interaction in their room.
Slowly, Harry lifted the towel off, just enough for them to take a glance. He smiled joyfully at what he saw before returning the towel back to its place. His hand wormed its way around Dracy’s head while the other gently pulled them closer to his.
A movie night! Can you believe that? He, a goddess of the gorgeousness temple, had a movie night with the bastard of the century. He had a dream of the kiss as well and it’s messing up his head. He wasn’t able to get back to sleep and now, with the dark circles around his eyes seemed enough for an evidence.
Draco rolled his eyes at her bitchiness. This woman is as frank as she can be. Whatever comes to mind, she blurts it out. She can be both a good role model and a bad example.
Harry ignored his statement as he beamed when Draco stood up and walked inside his office so he followed. He was about to seat on the guest chair but Harry stopped him, “No, no. Sit on my chair, doll”
It’s merely the pearl dust pushing him too. He’s not staring of his own accord, it’s not his choice. It was the pearl dust.
Draco cannot properly see his looks but he is sure how hot he can be as evidence by the gazes he’s throwing over his place at the stage, taking in his steps unblinking and unfaltering. It roused a suspicious desire in his abdomen when he noticed a movement in his rigid jaw.
The man didn't give in right away. He smiled, politely declined his advances even when Draco have caught his lingering glances many times now.
Harry had noticed it too and would smile whenever he catches her doing it. To see her going all mama bear even when there’s no harm around, he feels his heart fluttering at the thought of her being such an amazing mother.
“You blew me a kiss” Harry stated, head leaning a little closer and eyes not straying away, “You  blew me a kiss” he repeated.
He sighed dreamily. The moon shines bright every night. It glistens every time Remus exercise in their home, it flexes as he cooks. He had it memorized in his mind. Every contour, every shape, every lining, every muscle, every lines on his body is embedded on him.
“There’s none. Just massage me” Draco answered breathlessly, he doesn’t know what to feel but excitement and much more desperate need to have Harry wrapped around him. Something that could be dark to others but not even an ounce to him because it felt right to be with Harry.
“Cause you’re such a slut, right?” Harry smiled, letting go of his throat in favor to touch somewhere else, “Such a slut for me”
“Baby? Are you alright?” Harry frantically asked, standing and pocketing the ring as he immediately rushed to her side.
“Harry” her voice small and soft. Harry looked at her even though she seemed a little blurry in the eyes. However, he can still make out what she is wearing, a simple flowery dress he bought from their shopping trip in Diagon Alley.
Harry smiled. What an angelic omega. He nudged him by his thigh and winked, “I like the endearment but I would prefer it be said with fondness”
He never get any cuddles like Harry had said. The man cleans him when they finish, sure. He never denied him of any orgasm, never one to make him beg for long. It was never too much kinky, never explored much but tried twice or thrice.
When they arrived, she saw two people sitting at the couch with held hands. The woman had a bushy hair and is smiling kindly at her. While the man has red hair and freckled skin. Unlike the woman beside him, he isn’t smiling but instead just looking.
He shivered as he did let himself go. His thighs trembling as he came between his body and the wall he’s getting support from. His body nearly collapsed into a puddle. There was an onslaught of whirring and hissing.
After the brief wandering, he went to where Harry disappeared to and was mortified when he discovered there was only one bed. One bed! Hell fucking no!
” he whimpered, feeling the straining erection over the lace panties he’s wearing, staining a wet patch on a certain spot, “Want you, daddy”
After sitting for a minute to gather his wits, he stood up and fixed himself, a smile plastered on his face, “Ah, fuck. You’re in it, baby” he murmured before he, too, walked out, chuckling and whistling mischievously.
He rewarded her a passionate kiss, starting the play. His tongue danced with her, coaxing another noise from her before pulling away.
Where is that damnation by the way? He left just an hour ago and hasn’t come back yet. If he was out to gather some information, then good good. If not, then bad bad.
“Fine, fine. I’ll behave” Harry raised his arms in mock surrender, “Though I’d prefer you do that instead”
Harry sighed and pulled him close again as they trudge towards the higher floor. The second floor was dimmer than downstairs and a lot silent. There was several couches and tables spread all over the place and couples making out as if it’s the last day on Earth.
Harry sighed once more. He has a strong instincts and intuitions when it comes to things and this, this is something that his gut told him is a bad thing.
Lucius raised an eyebrow tauntingly, “How about we reveal to the Ministry you’re an illegal animagus?”
Several heads turned to look at them, some were looking in disbelief, some were guffawing in amazement.
They cheered among the crowd, faces not really visible for how dim the lights are above them but it didn’t deter him. More so, he was even motivated to give it his best like always.
“Fuck” he cursed and giving a particular hard bite on collarbone, causing for Dracy to yelp in desire, pussy clenching around him that Harry thought he could come for how tight she was around him.
“Don’t you dare, Potter or you’ll see what happens” he warned, eager to finish putting up the decorations.
He fasten his movements when Draco urged him on. Pounding in and out roughly, pinning Draco into the bed and just gave him what he wanted. They both groaned in unison.
But he still came back because he thought of him. Alone in the night. But now, he sees how dangerous it is. Draco wouldn’t stop and his own mind won’t stop.
Merlin. That sounded so good. Draco moaned, his arms winding around Harry’s head, his fingers gripped Harry’s hair and pulled on it. He felt Harry’s cock pressed to his own, his precome wetting his dress.
“Fuck, angel, so good, always so good for me” Harry groaned, eyes stared at his fiancée’s back, arched and trembling.
It was too hot. The room felt too hot but he loves it and still wants more. Selfishly wanting more and more. Want to feel Harry’s cock inside him. Wants to feel hard thrusts and want his hand choking him with delicious burns.
The first thing she noticed upon their arrival was a cozy living room. Easy to the eyes, refreshing, and definitely homey. It felt like the safehouse they went to in France but even more relaxing. It was absolutely spacious and wide.
She loves the way she makes him feel. She loves the control she has on him. She loves his reactions when she touches another man. She loves riling him up if it meant having her way after. She giggled at whatever the man was saying as they danced in the middle of the dance floor.
Draco led him to roses, “Roses are pretty and commonly, it’s what people likes. However, I can also suggest the tulips”
Draco keeps on pouting. He misses Harry and wants to be with him again. How long is he out already? This is their official first day being together but then, Harry have to go to his work in the Ministry. This day is important and they should’ve been together!
Harry growled and turned him around, Draco gasped. His chest pushed into the couch while his arse was in the air. He whimpered, growing more needy. Harry hiked his dress up, exposing the pale expanse of smooth skin, his ass cheeks covered by the lacy panties he wore. It was too much for the both them, they both knew how they needed each other.
“I’m not participating in this. Go to sleep” he took a step away but abruptly came to a stop when Draco cried and put a hand that held Harry’s arm to stop.
He watched her hand the lingerie to the staff packing what they bought and specifically asked her to hide it from view on the excuse of personal privacy.
Once he arrived on the Malfoy Manor by his motorcycle, he parked it at the side of the Manor and went in. He found the Malfoy Family in the living room where Draco is giving his parents a hug and he is fucking wearing another dress this time. A dress that should be considered inappropriate in daylight.
“Fuck. Wanna see you come apart, baby boy. You’ve never been so pretty, so fucking hot. Want to pump my cock into you, milk you and want to feel you around me”
Something that was kept with a mouth shut. Away from Lucius and Narcissa's consciousness and what a pretty sight it was when they saw him fucking Draco.
He scowled and looked back when he thought he heard some rustling back in the bedroom. Hiding the envelope in his back, he walked back at the bedroom, demand some answers as to why he wasn’t able to get out.
“Harry” Draco whimpered when he felt his lips biting down his neck, leaving him another set of love bites when the ones he left him before had faded away.
P.S. Draco is 18 when this started and Harry is 30 (just a bit of reminder not to confuse from the earlier chapter so this chapter is basically two years ago)
This party is going to be a disaster. Harry knows it. His Auror instincts know it. Everyone knows it, the smile on Draco's lips know it.
Somehow, the idea of being controlled didn't annoy him. In fact, Draco likes it. The thought of being controlled by the Head Auror is turning him on. Because he can very much see how skilled Harry is and how he would love to be manhandled by the experienced. Teach him things guys in Draco's age don't know. Show him things guys in Draco's age are not aware of. And make him feel things guys Draco's age are incapable of.
They didn’t care that someone might hear as they enjoyed the time being on each other. He loved the whimpers and mewls coming out from Draco’s lips and the tears welling up at the corner of his eyes.
He was right. The feel of Harry’s beard is magical. It’s incredible. So wondrous. It scratches his smooth skin marvelously, it convinced him that this isn’t a dream, that this really is happening. His hands wandered around those rippled shoulders, feeling some scars and the hard chest, to his back and abdomen, Harry is so gorgeous.
“Ah. Okay, work your magic, Harry” he whispered to himself before wandlessly casting a cleaning charm all over his body and his mouth to make sure there are no remnants of the kisses he had with someone.
He looked up and he sucked a sharp breath. Fuck. Mr. Harry Potter is a god. What he quickly noticed are the keen emerald eyes, glowing and to that perfect body that could tower him in a way he would feel so little, Harry is sexy.
Draco would’ve love to kiss him and would’ve jumped to cling onto him by now but stilled when he just noticed a bruise just beside Harry’s lightning bolt scar and a wound at his lips.
Draco stopped at the door before he turned around but Harry didn’t look back up, “I rescheduled so you have a lunch meeting with Mr. Cockybee today. I will be coming with you to ensure you’re presence and stop looking at my bum!”
“I have a hypothetical question” Harry began and Dracy perked up and nodded, urging for him to continue, “If I say we’re staying here for the night, do you want to?”
She noticed it too. She became a little hornier and needier. No harm because Harry’s attention is focused on her 24/7, she gets to kiss him whenever she wants but there’s not even just a single time she was the one to initiate some things. And never did Harry ask.
Smooth motherfucker. Draco tried not to roll his eyes. Words won’t get him anywhere but why is there a tingling sensation at his nape? Code black. Some serious shit is going on and Harry’s causing it!
“Alpha, please, please” Dracy shut her eyes tight as she savored Harry’s lips on her pussy, sucking at her clit gently while his fingers explored her sloppy entrance.
Draco thought for a second. Seven in the evening and his curfew starts at nine. He'll just be in the party for two hours?
“I’ll leave you two for a while” she winked before shaking hands with Harry and walking off, closing the door behind her.
“Nothing. You look good as always” and all these compliments and pet names are stirring him up but he cannot let himself go. It's breaking his control.
His eyed nearly dropped out of its socket when Harry spun his body to face him, hands gripping his waist to lift him up and kissed him. Like with the complete intensity, desire, and strange kind of pleausre shooting out from his spine like a cannon.
For the next few days, she was sure Harry seems a bit distant. He’d be gone early in the morning with a simple note saying he have another emergency with Ron then just thirty minutes after she wakes up, Hermione would come and give her some company.
“You noticed Draco and I are getting along, Professor. But I just worry it’s the potion that’s making us get along. What happens then if the effects wear off?”
When he was all fixed and is pretty decent to walk back to the Great Hall, he blew Harry a kiss before walking out, his hips swaying dangerously sexy and giggling when Harry groaned in annoyance.
Harry responded instantly. Understanding what Draco needed. His strong arms hugged him by his waist and pulled his body flushed to his. He groaned at the way their body seemed to fit one another, a complement of something, an equal of the opposite side.
Harry looked at it before extending his hand and offering it to her. She contemplated for a second before accepting it.
Harry groaned huskily, dipping down as they let their joint body fall onto the mattress. He pushed two fingers inside Draco’s wet mouth to muffle his moans, “Cum for me, kitten. Wanna see you cum for me, baby”
Harry felt like he melt at the sight. A happy Dracy is driving him insane, just wanted to forego with this early lunch and just go to the place he planned they’d go to next after eating. However, Dracy needs her meals and Harry vowed to make sure she eats her foods and guide her through the process.
He turned his head to the other side, refusing to look anywhere else, waiting for someone who can explain what the hell is happening. The wait didn’t take long as the doors burst open, Madam Pomfrey and Headmistress McGonagall came barging in.
She blushed when Harry’s attention turned to hers but returned the smile when Harry let out that gorgeous grin as his eyes sweep up and down her body. Up until now, she cannot help the tingle that runs through her core at the look of utter adoration in his eyes.
Draco stopped and thought for a minute. Does he want to go somewhere else? Or spend this day with Harry in the Manor? He could continue getting to know him, right?
His ears began to ring as his soul felt as if it was laughing at him. He looked at his father in disbelief. Surely, he’s jesting? He gulped before turning his eyes to her mother who looked just as serious though her eyes held some sympathy.
Harry ignored the call. He separated from Draco’s lips but quickly connected it with his jawline, nipping at it softly before it slid down to his neck and bite harshly.
Harry hummed as he enclosed his hand around his cock and began to slid his hands up and down, “You’re not going to cum until I say so, kitten”
“What do you think? I’ll help you relax those muscles and spoil our little beanie with kisses” he whispered, head leaning down.
Dracy blinked in surprise and chuckled humorlessly, “That’s all what you have to say? I’m distressed? Wow. I didn’t know an alpha like you could be so insensitive”
“This calls for a celebration!” Pansy exclaimed excitedly, “Dray we’re going to your house. We’re talking about that ring later!”
Draco immediately turned his back and smiled, "I was just reaching for a cup" he pouted and tried to reach again but Harry noticed the way he stick his bottom out and Harry isn't sure if the wiggle is intentional or just something that happened because Draco tried to reach for a cup.
Now, now these are obviously intentional and Harry cannot really snap here. But if there are no morals holding him back, he would have had Draco on his knees already, looking up to him with those pretty cherry red lips wrapped around a sinful hard cock.
Hello! I want to apologize for the inconsistent updates. This chapter have been in my laptop for days but I forgot to post it because I've been so focused on (spoiler alert!) writing a female Draco AU oneshot. I am so excited for it so I hope everyone can have the time to read it when I finish it! :)
She felt his warm breath at her neck and smelled the manly scent that invaded all her rationality and sensible judgment.
She bit her lip as they came to a halt. What rests in front of them is a blanket laid on the pavement with a basket full of foods. There’s one cushion placed on the left side and they have such a nice sight of the city.
