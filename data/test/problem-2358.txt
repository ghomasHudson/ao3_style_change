“Mate,” Seamus flung his arm over Harry’s shoulder. “Did we really see you sitting with Loony Lovegood?”
“I don’t,” Sirius coughed. “But hopefully we can work something out. This particular cousin is a little more reasonable than the others.”
Harry squared his shoulders, and jutted his chin, ready for whatever his Aunt was about to say. He stared at the woman who had spent so many years tormenting and demeaning Harry every chance she got. Now, he knew he would never have to endure anymore of her comments after today. The thought was relieving. Euphoric even. He knew he could take one last comment she was about to throw his way.
Sirius heard Remus inhale sharply.
“Well, I mean…” Sirius trailed off, looking up at the cloudless sky. “Fuck. That’s why I called you. To talk about us. To see if we could work things out…I don’t know.”
“What?” Harry repeated, completely lost.
After checking his schedule, Harry groaned, before entering the castle and beginning his decent to the dungeons for double Science. Deep into the castle, there were few if any windows lining the walls, leading the hallways to be shrouded in darkness. Harry stuck close to the wall, brushing the rough brick against his fingertips as he walked. Ahead of him, another boy walked, shoulders hunched over, neck hanging low, looking like he was walking to his execution. After a few moments, Harry noted the boy was none other than Neville Longbottom.
“True.”
“Huh,” was Harry’s response.
Why was Draco letting him hold his hand?
Harry watched as panic washed over Sirius the closer Professor Lupin got. He felt a twinge of panic himself, watching his godfather freak out.
Harry wore the same shirt and jeans he had been wearing the day before. His hair was even messier than it usually was and there were smudges on his glasses that he was too lazy to clean. When he looked at Sirius, Harry noticed for the first time in the week, the man had pulled his hair back into a ponytail and shaved his face.
“No, Moony, us as in, you, Harry and me.”
Though the other boy would deny it, Harry saw the pleased smile that crossed his face.
“Ok?”
The class settled. Harry quietly unpacked his belongings, setting himself up for the class, glancing sideways at Ron who was rolling his eyes. The lesson passed agonisingly slow. Snape lectured the entire time, pausing only once to reprimand Neville for whatever issue he had taken up with the boy that day. Towards the end of the lesson, his eyes strayed over to Harry, and the boy waited for the insults to start. Instead, the man merely narrowed his eyes and continued his talk on modern vaccinations.
“It’s true,” Remus laughed. Sirius soon joined in.
“Why wouldn’t they sign the paperwork?”
Harry rolled his eyes.
Sirius stepped into the office. His eyes were locked with Malfoys. Behind him, Sirius heard the patter of running footsteps.
“Alright,” Sirius sounded disappointed. If Harry were to look up, he would see the concern simmering in his godfathers’ eyes. “Have a good day at school, Prongslet.”
Yet, there was also a touch of something else, something different, that Harry could only describe as Draco’s touch filling the room. A poster of Draco’s favourite football team (Harry would deny ever knowing it was Tottenham) was stuck to the wall above the couch. A bookshelf bedside the bed was filled with nerdy books he knew only Draco and Hermione would enjoy. Even the way Draco held himself, relaxed and lazing about in his boxers, showed how casual, safe, he felt in this space.
The drive to the court room was awkward and stifling. The music played on the radio was irritating. The driver was stoic and uninterested. Any other time Harry would be happy the trip to their destination had ended. But not this time.
Draco shot him a look which Potter responded to by rolling his eyes.
“Mr. Black,” Sirius dropped the murderous glint in his eyes. “Recently, you served twelve years for a murder you were wrongfully committed of. Considering this, do you still believe you are fit to act as guardian of Mr. Potter?”
“How about we get out of the house for a bit?”
“Yeah?” Sirius’s voice echoed up the staircase.
“What the hell was that?” Harry spoke just above a whisper.
“Come on. We can do this Prongslet. You need to get dressed now.”
“Literally, all I’ve done is sit with you at the movies and whine about my problems. I think you should raise your standards a bit, Luna.”
“Excellent,” Malfoy picked up his suitcase and cane. “Draco and I will arrive in the morning at 10 30, if that suits you both.”
“Well, yeah…”
Sirius led them over to the two Malfoys. Draco immediately dropped his disinterested gaze when he spotted Harry. He shot to his feet, widened eyes looking over Harry, who was still mulling over this strange urge he had felt.
Those were the words practically shouted by Professor Snape as he entered the classroom in his usual dramatic fashion. Behind him the door slammed, and it took everything in Harry not to flinch from the noise. He refused to give the greasy git the satisfaction of his fear.
They sat like that for a few moments, Harry gently running his hands over Snuffle when something seemed to click in the dog’s head. Snuffles leapt to his feet, knocking Harry’s hand out of the way. Harry started to panic at the sudden movements, jerking his hands to his chest, when Snuffles long wet tongue ran itself over Harry’s face.
“Well, as long as your current guardians sign the legal documents required, it should be fine.”
“I am glad to hear you will be adopting from us. Is this your godson you were telling me about?
Malfoy scrunched his nose in disgust and even Harry, who loved walking Snuffles, thought the idea repulsive. Yet, it was better than sitting around the house where Malfoy could potentially overhear details about the case Harry didn’t need him knowing. With that, Harry rounded up Snuffles.
“If you take on our case, I will make it worth your time,” Sirius said through gritted teeth, trying to keep the desperation and anger out of his voice.
“I kind of told him to fuck off. Said he wasn’t there to like…stop it when shit was bad. That’s it’s not his problem, just because he feels bad about it all now. I really didn’t hold back…”
“It’s where the cool kids sit, Harry.”
Draco chuckled.
Malfoy Manor was the biggest property Harry had ever seen. The driver crept along the road at a slow, steady pace, showing off the property in its entirety. The driveway leading up to the Manor was long and winding, showing of the display of freshly mown green lawns and well nurtured garden beds. Harry was sure he even spotted a peacock rustling around in the bushes, before it escaped his sight.
“It’s nice to meet you. I’m Melissa. How are you doing today, sweetheart?” She held out her hand to his.
Harry took that in, shifting on the couch.
Draco rolled his eyes. They fell silent as they walked up the street into the city centre.
Harry nodded. His eyes prickled, and lips pouted.
The question only made Potter laugh harder. All the stress pent up in Potter seemed to be seeping out. He still looked exhausted, but the tension within him was not as intense. Together they laughed at nothing and everything, unsure what it was that seemed so funny in the first place.
Sirius smiled a small, unhappy smile.
“Whatever is on your mind, just sort it out already. Your making me nervous and you suck at cleaning.”
Lucius tutted, glancing at the papers now scattered along the floor.
Sirius looked to be racking his brains for an excuse out, but before he could think of anything, Harry responded.
Draco opened his mouth, and then shut it. He felt a chill rush over him despite the heat of the day.
“What!” Any breath Harry managed to breathe left him.
The day continued much the same, Harry staring forlornly in class, Ron shooting his friend concerned looks, Hermione forever attentive to the lesson. After History was English, then Maths, before finally lunch break.
He flung himself back down on the couch, crossing his arms over his chest. He stared down Harry with a petulant look on his face.
When they finally left the house at 9:08, they walked side by side to the bus stop. Sirius was dressed much like he had been when Harry had first met him, button up shirt and jeans. He had his hair pulled back into a bun as he usually did, and his face was clean shaven.
“What, us as in you and Harry.”
“Well, after everything that happened, your parents dying and me being sent to prison, he and I lost touch.”
“Moony, relax!” Harry said, noting the man had failed to take breath since he started speaking.
“Go where?” Remus asked, lifting his eyebrow.
Hopefully an update soon, and Remus I promise!
“Harry,” Sirius spoke.
Lucius gave him an unamused look. The room suddenly felt warmer, and Sirius tugged at his shirt sleeves and collar.
“Are you quite done?”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said before pulling him in for a hug.
Harry started to protest, but Sirius shot him a look that told him it would be useless. He laughed at Sirius’s determination, before running up the stairs to the bathroom.
Harry sealed the note in an envelope, carefully printing the address Ron had left on his letters. He quickly wrote out a similar letter to Hermione. His hands shook as he finished stamping them.
Harry thought for a moment. He picked at his nail beds, tearing skin from his fingers absentmindedly.
“No, Potter, why would you think that?” Draco rolled his eyes. “Just open it, you dunce.”
“What are you on about, Potter? I just met your godfather. I’m pretty sure he would get sent back to jail if he saw me hit you. That man was giving off some serious overprotective vibes.”
“Bloody hell,” Remus sighed out another laugh. “That’s fantastic Pads, I’m so happy for you both.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you Harry?” She smiled at him and Harry shifted on the waiting room lounge.
Draco, bullies Harry: Is this flirting?
So, some of you may have noticed, I am no legal expert, and all knowledge I possess is thanks to google. This is also why everything I write seems American crossed with a bit of uk law. I by no means am writing from experience and so this fic is not realistic by any means. Sorry haha. That being said, I probably wont be able to change anything if it is majorly wrong, so apologies again.
The wallpaper was pealing throughout the entire house, the floorboards creaked with practically every step, and dust had covered the place. When Harry saw it for the first time, he had nearly cried from happiness.
“Wait, what?”
However, on the 1st of September 1995, Harry Potter woke with a scowl already on his face, and a ball of unease boiling in the pit of his stomach.
“Ah.”
“Seems odd.”
From the fridge he pulled out a carton of milk and eggs. He opened one of the cupboards and pulled a pan out tactfully to avoid making any noise. He had much experience from making breakfast for the Dursleys, who did not appreciate early mornings. Gathering all the equipment, he set about making scrambled eggs.
“How are-”
Harry could hear Draco groaning on the other phone and had to suppress his laughter.
“Sometimes, I forget what your like at school. Like most of the summer, you’ve been a really great friend to me, and I can forget how we are at Hogwarts,” Harry sighed. “But then you say shit like that and… I don’t know, I guess it reminds me how much of a dick you can be.”
“I know. It was unfair of me to put this on you so soon. That’s on me.”
Remus cleared his throat and looked to Sirius.
Harry stood as still as possible. His eyes were wide, and his mouth had fallen open. He was struggling to decide if he should sneak past them and head back to his seat, or to slink back into the bathroom, when he heard the elevator doors ding. From the opening doors emerged Sirius and what looked to be an adult Draco Malfoy. Harry figured it was Draco’s father.
Harry told him about his life with the Dursleys. He spoke of the daily chores that were too much for any four-year-old to handle and the punishments he received for not finishing. He spoke of his Aunt Petunia and her frying pan, and his Uncles punishments that usually entailed a few punches and days locked in his cupboard. He told Malfoy and Sirius things he had never told anyone, such as the time his Uncle put him in hospital with a concussion and three fractured ribs. Harry had been forced to tell the nurses he had fallen down the stairs. All the stories led up to his final night with his relatives and him running away to Sirius.
All Draco could do was nod and pray the other didn’t notice the effect the hold was having on him.
Harry nodded.
Silence answered Snape’s question.
Harry frowned at the words.
Harry gut felt like it had suddenly developed a career as a gymnast.
Harry’s chest felt constricted and he looked down to his shoes, counting the stairs as they walked down them. He noticed his shoelaces were untied and had a fleeting thought of tripping, letting gravity take over and violently pull him to the earth in an unforgiving and painful manner. Hermione and Ron flanked beside him, chatting about something Harry wasn’t paying attention to. Once again, the thoughts about what faced him this summer wondered through Harry’s thoughts. Fear pumped through his veins and he could feel his heart rate increase simply envisioning his Uncles enraged face blotched red and purple.
“If you can’t decide on a movie, I suggest you see that one,” A dreamy voice spoke beside him, causing Harry to jump.
He was saved from further conversation on the matter when the assembly bell rang, causing the students standing to take their seats.
Harry stood, pushing off Snuffles and heading to the living room to speak with his Godfather. He opened his mouth to respond but before he could answer, Sirius continued talking.
“What are-”
“I’m not some… I’m not a nutter, you know. It’s just a few bad dreams. I don’t know why they’ve been so bad lately, but they’ll go away eventually. So why would he say… I’m not crazy!”
“Bye, Potter,” He mumbled instead. Then he looked to Sirius. “Thank you for having me over, Mr. Black.”
“Ok,” Fleur started. “Harry, would you like to take ze lead.”
“I haven’t told Ron and Hermione because I don’t know how they would react,” Harry picked at the hem of his shirt. “I never even told them about Sirius’s existence.”
“Well, I don’t see a problem with that…” Sirius said, completely baffled at the request. “Harry, what do you think?”
“That I was like what, Harry?”
Enjoy the rest of your holidays,
“Alright,” Harry murmured. “I won’t tell them right away. But I am not keeping this a secret from them forever. There’s also a condition you have to agree to.”
Sirius pulled him back into his chest. Then man’s arms were shaking, and Harry could feel his godfather’s breath hitching against his ear.
“Christ, I could never hate you, you dolt,” Sirius pulled his godson to his chest swaying him back and forth until Harry cracked a smile. “How about this. Remus and I avoid getting too serious for now. Just try and become friends again before anything else. Would that be alright with you?”
Though he could never admit it to others, Draco had always been disappointed by Potter’s rejection. It was why when he saw Potter with Weasley and Granger at school Draco didn’t hold back. He sniped at Potter and his friends until the other boy rose to the bait. Draco knew well how to get a rise out of Potter, and he always enjoyed the fight given by the other boy.
Sirius sighed, and gave Harry’s shoulder one last squeeze before heading off.
“What’s wrong?”
“JUST GIVE ME THE PHONE!”
Remus Lupin strode towards them, his brief case swinging by his side. He was clean shaven, his brown-grey hair ruffled as though he had run his hands through it several times that day. His suit was worn, and his shoes scuffed, but he looked comfortable and calm as he walked towards the boys.
He found them seated at a table on the side of the dancefloor, both looking absolutely miserable. Ron was oddly still upset by Hermione going to the ball with Krum and Harry simply did not get it. Krum was clever, talented, an international Quidditch star, not to mention fit. Why would Hermione turn him down? He watched the pair dancing and laughing together. They looked happy. Harry was simply happy for his friend while Ron grumbled about the age difference and language barrier. Harry didn’t even bat an eye when a boy from Beauxbatons asked Parvati to dance and she said yes without hesitation. Padama deserted them shortly after that. Harry and Ron were commiserating about their mutual displeasure regarding the ball when Parkinson approached their table. Ron froze, staring at the Slytherin in her deep magenta robes. She had her dark hair piled on top of her head but whisps were falling down in curled tendrils that framed her face. She was a bit pink in the cheeks as she collapsed into the seat beside Harry. He couldn’t decide if the pug-nosed girl was pretty or not. He supposed she was. At least for tonight, anyway.
"Fuck, Malfoy! Fuck yes-" Harry closed his eyes as he was about to go over the edge.
“You look fine, it’s almost time!” His mirror chirped at him and he gave it a sullen glare.
“Malfoy filth.” Someone actually spat at him, phlegm landing mere inches short of its mark.
“Then you just up and decided that catching the bad guys wasn’t your thing anymore?” Malfoy sneered.
“Oh.” Harry blinked, looking a bit lost.
“It is.” He inclined his head towards her in thanks. He didn’t bother to wait for further questioning that may or may not come, he launched right into the tale of his time with the Dark Lord. “As the head of the Malfoy household, it was my duty to attend the Conglomeration of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. We would meet once a month as needed to discuss business dealings and such. During one of our meetings, we were informed that we had a guest of honor, but that he wanted to meet with us individually. I can’t speak for the others, but when I refused to espouse his childish views...he wouldn’t take no for an answer. Before I was even aware of what was happening it was too late. He was always rather good with nonverbal magic, even in school.”
Happy reading!
“Do you feel you should be pardoned?” The same witch asked.
“You’re right, I’m sorry. That was rather unprofessional of me.” He looked as if the words took a great amount of effort to say.
“It’s a brand new artist, actually.” Pansy pulled Draco’s painting out of her bag and placed it on the counter. “This is his first work and he’s convinced that it’s worthless.”
The unmistakable buzz of patrons filling the theater could be heard all the way backstage and Draco felt uncharacteristically nervous. He had been so preoccupied with avoiding Harry the past two days that he had forgotten to panic over his father attending opening night. The butterflies in his stomach worked double-time to compensate and Draco rather felt like he might be sick.
"Oh, er…" Harry glanced anxiously between Draco and his father and Draco's heart skipped a beat.
Some of the dialogue for this fic is taken directly from the books. If it isn't broken, why fix it? I do not own Harry Potter nor do I intend to make any money off of these characters.
"You were amazing." Draco cleared his throat, unsure how to proceed.
"Er..." Harry started, but he had no idea what he was supposed to say. 'Surprise, I'm bi?' 'It's not what it looks like?' This was exactly what it looked like and Harry knew it.
\“Go get the boy, Potter.” Zach said seriously. “Anyone who has the power to make you this much less of an irritable grump deserves a medal. You better lock him down fast.”
“You are?” His voice cracked annoyingly again, but he hardly cared. He had been striving to hear those words for nearly his entire life.
“Thank you, though I doubt I’ll need it.” Draco stage whispered before dashing back to where Dean was waiting for him at the billiards table.
“You talk to Kreacher?” Harry blinked in confusion.
“Right.” Draco narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “As you’re well aware, blood purity does not necessarily equal power. There are muggleborns and halfbloods that are immensely more powerful than most purebloods. Great examples of this being Hermione and yourself-”
“I haven’t seen you in a couple months, how come you never come round anymore?”
Draco was already there, sipping a coffee and avidly reading a large book that he had propped up in front of him. Harry blinked a few times to make sure he wasn’t seeing things. Was Draco wearing eyeliner? His hair had grown out while he was being held at the Ministry, but it looked like he had gotten it cut recently. It was still longer than he had worn it at school, though, and it seemed to be missing the copious amounts of product he used to use. Harry thought it looked better this way, softer and more natural. The dark purple of his shirt offset his pale skin and the shirt clung to his shoulders in a way that made Harry's stomach do a weird little flip.
“What, answering my floo call or chatting with my mother?” Draco seemed amused.
“I think you’re human, Potter.” Draco teased.
“I hope you weren’t waiting long.” Harry blinked.
“Well, if you insist.” His father looked hopefully towards Harry.
“Search me,” Ron threw his hands up in mock invitation, glaring at Harry.
If only the rest of the wizarding world would be so accepting.
“Lemmings?” Draco arched an eyebrow as they heard multiple voices shouting excitedly and getting closer.
“Harry Potter! What an honor!” A small wizard squealed excitedly and Harry’s heart sank.
“Harry James Potter, Deputy Head Auror.” Harry said flatly.
Hello my lovely readers! This chapter is a tad long, but it does cover A LOT of time so I figured you wouldn't mind! If you've stuck with me this long, thank you. If you're just joining in, welcome! This chapter is very fast-paced and you don't get a break from the feels at all, so strap in! It's going to be a bumpy ride.
“He thought he was. Dumbledore and I had just returned from hunting down one of Voldemort’s horcruxes. He ordered me to put on my invisibility cloak and then petrified me so I couldn’t move. Draco didn’t know I was there.”
He stared defeatedly into the dancing blaze, watching the fire curl the covers of his sketchbooks before consuming them entirely. That part of his life was over. He watched it burn for what felt like a century before the panic started to bubble up.
“He is my friend, in a manner of speaking. We’ve been through a lot together. He actually hated me when we first met.” Harry waxed nostalgic and Draco was no less confused.
Harry did his best to obey. After a small bit of fighting and a fair amount of name-calling, George finally had Harry’s face in the right position. He kept up a running commentary on proper application technique and how to get the most out of each tube while he worked on his left eye. He applied it thicker on the outer corner and very lightly on the inside, wiping off any excess with his thumb until he was satisfied.
“Er,” He struggled to think of vague symptoms that would get him out of the party but not carted off to St Mungo's.
Chaos.
“Are you always this needy in bed?” Harry laughed breathlessly, obeying regardless.
While Draco was busy feeling sentimental Harry had polished off his chips and was preparing to leave, completely oblivious to how his words had affected him. Draco couldn’t control the delighted laugh that escaped before he leaned over the small table and kissed him. Harry made a surprised sound but returned the kiss, placing a hand on Draco’s cheek to prolong the moment.
“Enough.” Pansy shrugged unabashed. “I wasn’t trying to overhear, I was just looking for a book on nonverbal magic and this sodding library doesn’t have a single one that can help.”
"I'll survive." He said grimly. "It was quite enjoyable till you crushed the air from my lungs."
The Weaselette had seemed particularly put out. She clearly hoped to engineer an intimate moment between them and Harry brushed it away like it was meaningless. Then there was the mystery of the matching pair. They had seemed to suggest Harry might possibly have feelings for him with their incessant humming and snide remarks about love being in the air. Could it really be possible? There was only one way to find out. If Harry refused to dance with him, he was most likely just being considerate. If he agreed….
“You can’t unless he invites you, you know that.” Pansy snapped, pulling Draco into a tight hug. Theo closed him in and suddenly he was enveloped in a group hug.
“I was told my work could wait and that this dinner was much more important.” she said breezily.
“No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.” She replied monotonously.
“Right. Thank you.” He took a deep breath before closing the door behind him.
He was treading water, but there was no light.
“You ready to go, then?” Harry’s face lit up at the prospect.
“Wouldn’t your sister help you? It's  my understanding that she joined you at your residence upon her breakout from Azkaban."
“You alright?” Ginny sank next to him on the couch with two glasses of fire whiskey. She handed one to him before sipping delicately on the other.
“Well, that just leaves us cool kids.” Blaise reached out to wrap an arm around Luna’s waist as she flitted to his side, decked out in a bright yellow and purple dress and red radish earrings. “Anyone up for a pint?”
“Oh, I don’t know. It’s not so dank and musty anymore. He’s been renovating it.” Granger shot Pansy an amused smirk.
“Her failed Polyjuice transformation into a cat in second year.” Harry snickered at the memory.
He couldn’t look away, no matter how much it hurt. He didn’t even notice when the server came back to drop off his drink. When the song had ended he looked down at the table and was surprised to see a tall glass filled with a light brown liquid in front of him. He pulled the straw out and chugged it in one go. His throat burned but he didn’t care. The warm numbness that accompanied the last swallow was very welcomed.
Harry ambled over to where Neville, Ron, and Seamus were sitting and took the last chair.
“Miss Pansy! To what do I owe this pleasure?” A lanky, magenta haired wizard exclaimed as he caught sight of her. He quickly closed the distance between them to embrace her and brush his lips against each cheek.
As soon as he was outside he apparated to the alley next to his favorite muggle coffee shop. Draco had said meeting somewhere muggle would be better, considering Harry’s lemmings and the fact that most of wizarding Britain still hated him because he was a Death Eater. Harry had been mildly surprised Draco knew the shop he was talking about when he suggested it as their meet up spot. Then he remembered bringing Pansy here on more than one occasion and he realized she must have brought Draco.
“See that you don’t.” Harry sniffed. After a slight pause, he decided to bring up something that had been bothering him ever since he got his hands on that book. “Did you know we were distantly related?”
“Yeah, I think so.” Pansy beamed. “Look, everyone is getting along and having a good time. We did good.”
“What do you want, Uncle Vernon?” He asked warily.
"You're wishing for a cock in your mouth, I'm a willing participant. What's so confusing about that?" Malfoy arched an elegant eyebrow at him.
“Hello, gorgeous.” Draco smiled as he opened the door to reveal a sharply dressed Harry Potter.
The list was considerably longer than Draco’s, but they shared one common thing that the Dark Lord had stolen from them: A normal life.
"Just… all of it. The whole bloody thing." Draco pinched the bridge of his nose until it hurt. It distracted him from the pain in his jaw and cheekbones. Harry and the Weasley twin had done quite the number on him before they had been pulled off. His ribs gave a sharp pain so he sat back against the lockers with a grimace.
“Get him inside!” Severus’s voice rose above the din of chatter.
The entire table burst out laughing at the innuendo, slapping Dean on the back as they gave him a good, if somewhat unintelligible, ribbing.
“You will?” Harry’s heart hammered with excitement.
“Please!” Draco gasped in between breaths. “Just go!”
“Here, I brought you this.” Ron pulled out a take away container, sliding it across the desk.
He derived a sick sense of pleasure at the way all four of them flinched at the use of Voldemort’s name.
“Oh.” Harry looked taken aback. “Are you sure you want me to have these?”
“Yes.”
"Which part?" Theo crossed his arms, unimpressed with Draco’s answer. “The part where you let Potter catch the snitch? Or the part where you pitched a bitch fit about it and goaded him and the Weasley's into beating the absolute shite outta you?"
It had been the game he was looking forward to the most. He didn’t even care who actually won. So why had he acted like that?
“I try not to work weekends, so that should be alright. Sometimes I get called in, but I can probably tell them to sod off if that happens. The head of the MLE is a Potter-rotter.”
“Oh, that looks wonderful! How does it feel?”
“It seems the three of you had fun.” Andromeda offered him a small smile.
The edges of his vision started to cloud and he almost wanted to laugh.
Harry
“I just never pegged you as a cat person.” He smirked.
The stairway that had been lined with severed elf heads was now an elegant cream color with forest green trim and framed pieces that represented Harry’s favorite Blacks. There was the picture of his Dad, Remus, Sirius, and Peter that Sirius had stuck to his wall, Regulus’s letter to Voldemort that had been in the decoy locket, the schematics for Sirius’s motorcycle, and Regulus’s Quidditch pictures. Farther up Harry had framed drawings from Teddy, endless pictures of Teddy, and pictures of Tonks and Andromeda. Draco seemed especially interested in these, and Harry made a mental note to talk to Andromeda about the possibility of a Black family reunion.
“Alright, fine. But you’re buying.” Ron pointed a finger in Dean's face as they all vacated the booth.
“So! Eyeliner. Where do you want to start?” George rubbed his hands together excitedly, looking over at the array of colorful sticks he was sitting next to on the counter. “We have a lot of options.”
He followed the feet up to their owner and cursed his luck. It was Harry quickly moving towards the crowd from half a block away. The last thing he wanted was for Harry to see him like this. Draco gathered his strength, pulling magic to him like a dragon hoarding precious gems. He was a Black and a Malfoy. These weaklings didn’t stand a chance.
“I mean all of the Gryffindors from our year.” Harry looked over at him guiltily. “Sometimes George or Bill will come along too, and occasionally Lee Jordan, but for the most part it’s just the five of us.”
“Oh, is that how it’s done? And here I’ve been wearing every drink I’ve ever had. Boy, that’s embarrassing.” Draco quipped, trying not to grimace. That had definitely sounded better in his head.
"He yelled at me a bit, so I got defensive and yelled back. Then he told me he doesn't need me to protect him, called me a hypocrite, and stormed off." He said miserably.
“No.” he said stubbornly. When he met Pansy’s unimpressed stare he ran his hand through his wet hair and tried again after a heavy pause. “Yes. Maybe? I don’t know. How can you love someone who hates you and everything your family stands for?”
“Potter! Didn’t expect to see you here.” The sandy-haired Slytherin grinned at him.
“No.” He sighed.
His hand jumped across the page as he abandoned Granger and started drawing his favorite subject. Harry was easy. Draco could probably draw him in his sleep. He smiled faintly at the thought as he sketched Harry’s heart-stopping smile. He was never more alluring than when he was laughing with his friends.
“I hope not, or you’re going to be rightly pissed when you wake up and find out I’ve been snogging you in your sleep.” Harry snorted, taking a step back to give him some breathing space.
“Well aren’t the Malfoy’s just a rotten bunch.” The Dark Lord hissed, slowly advancing on them. “You’re a disgrace to wizardkind, killing your own kin. I believe it is high time I took out the trash. Avada-”
“I’m alright. Maybe I can catch up to you while you’re gone.” Harry smiled sadly.
“Of course not. No person in their right mind did.” He scoffed.
“Thanks, Pans.” He snorted.
“I am taking it seriously.”
“You alrigh’ mate?” Ron’s sleepy voice came from the other bunk.
“That’s a pretty even match. When those games are done, I want to play Harry one on one though. He’s the only one of you sorry lot that can keep up with me.” Dean shot a quick wink at Harry.
“It’s alright, I know you had court. I don’t blame you, I know you would have been there if you could have.” He smiled sadly.
She had been on holiday in Spain with her mother since the beginning of the summer and had only just returned.  It should have been no surprise that she immediately noticed Theo’s absence.
This is why he and George had to break up. It was simply too painful for both of them. They kept reminding each other of Fred. And every time it happened it was an agonizing blow.
He was a failure.
“Thank you, Kreacher.” Harry reached down to pet the elf on the head. It leaned into his touch and Draco was flabbergasted.
"My apologies, I was caught up with a problem customer." Draco intoned as he took the proffered gift. "This is beautiful. Did you make this one yourself?"
“Something is happening.” Draco’s voice was clipped.
Draco looked hot. There was no other word for it. His heart was hammering at the mere sight of him. Draco had traded his ghastly green healer robes for a rich maroon shirt that he had tucked into rather tight looking black pants that put his hips and perfect arse on display. The red looked good on him, complimenting his pale skin and giving him some color. Harry gathered his resolve, gulped down the last of his drink, and stood up.
Harry has a lot to learn about Pureblood customs and history. Draco might just have the patience to teach him. What started as a form of tutoring has lead to an unlikely friendship, and Draco is rather peeved to discover it's possible to fall even more in love with someone.
“Luna Lovegood, Garrick Ollivander, Dean Tomas and Griphook the goblin. Without information from those prisoners, I would not have been able to defeat Voldemort.” Harry’s tone was constricted. Draco marveled at how well he was keeping it together as he was forced to relive such traumatic events.
Harry's date idea is somewhat unexpected this time- he's taking Draco to the club! Jealousy and steamy smut ensue.
Daphne and Theo joined in and before he knew it Draco was being smothered by all of his friends.
Fear took over as his main emotion as he remembered that the Dark Lord was on his way here, expecting Harry to be waiting for him like a sitting duck.
“Ah, you might not like the answer.” Harry grimaced as he opened the wine with his wand.
“Er, you’re familiar with plays, right?” Harry didn’t seem to mind explaining the intricacies of muggle things Draco didn’t understand.
“I can get them for you, sweetheart. Which ones do you need?” She stroked his face gently before giving his shoulder a reassuring squeeze.
"Not to worry! I have just the thing." Harry rummaged around in his pocket and pulled out two New You amulets that George had sent him.
“You cut me off earlier. I was going to say I’m glad you’re not my healer anymore because now I can do this.” Harry took a deep breath and launched himself out of the chair before he could overthink it.
He shut off the car and rushed inside, grabbing a blank envelope from the stationary desk in the den. He slipped the tickets inside and scribbled a quick note before tucking the flap in. He left the envelope blank. His father would know the tickets were meant for him and Narcissa.
“You,” Voldemort turned his wand on Narcissa and she flinched, bracing for the pain. It came in the form of a shouted command via the imperius curse and a quick burning hex to the shoulder. She cried out briefly at the double onslaught, then collected herself. “Examine him. Tell me if he’s really dead.”
Sixth year has passed in a blur. So much has happened. Fear has become a constant companion for our two boys. Will their friends (and boyfriends) be enough to stop their spiral downwards? Only time will tell
“I’ve been looking for you all night!” George screamed over the music, shooting him a maniacal grin.
“Charmed, I’m sure. Go on, I know you’re always starving.” She waved him off and he disappeared almost immediately. “It’s good to see you, Potter. We miss you in the Auror division.”
“He did, but he said that he would not be able to do so again because King Galbatorix knew his and Thorn’s true names and he would forbid them from showing such mercy in the future.”
“Calm down mate, you were just dreaming.” Ron said softly.
“We shall see.” Draco gave him a quick grin before slipping off to the bathroom.
“Why would I be? You were right.” Draco could afford to be generous if it helped Harry forgive him.
Harry makes a call to Sirius and Draco gets orders from home. Life is just starting to get harder for the both of them and they each react in unique ways. This chapter moves rather fast, bringing us from the last half of 5th year into the summer before 6th year.
“Harry?” He asked somewhat incredulously. “What are you doing here?”
Harry stared helplessly as all fifty some odd wizards all started shouting over one another. It was chaos. The head of the MLE tried calling them to order but no one paid her any mind. After a moment of feeling lost and overwhelmed the pandemonium reminded him of something. They all sounded like angry Quidditch fans!
“Is that when you…?” Draco wasn’t sure how to phrase it.
“Why?”
Draco swore softly under his breath and looked up at the ceiling, squinting to keep the water out of his eyes.
"I suppose it's not so bad." He grinned.
This tournament seemed a lot more bearable with Ron on his side. Ron grinned back nervously, shifting his weight at the uncomfortable display of emotions. Hermione made a strangled noise and Harry was surprised to see that she was crying.
The very air around them seemed to explode, cutting their small little reunion short. Harry was thrown backward and it was all he could do to keep hold of the thin piece of wood that was his only weapon in this war. He could hear the other’s screams but had no way of knowing what had happened to them.
His cheek earned him a backhanded slap from his aunt, but he had been expecting it. He was somewhat proud that he hadn’t cried out at the pain. His eye felt like it was going to explode from the sheer force of the slap and it physically knocked him sideways. He had to stumble a little just to stay upright. If it saved Harry’s life, it would be worth it.
“That sounds lovely. Did you want to do tea this afternoon?” His mother shot his father a quelling look.
“I’ll do it.”
“Oh, erm… I was sort of… saving it.” Harry suddenly broke eye contact with both of them and Hermione frowned.
"That's it, you've got it." Harry smiled encouragingly. "Now let go of the wall and skate out to me."
“Guess I’m special.” Harry chuckled, wincing as she started to knead his bare skin. “I don’t get any softer, pretty kitty. I promise.” He poked at her paws until she stopped.
“Because then life would be too easy, and we can’t have life being easy for once now can we? That’s just preposterous.” Draco said dryly, hoping to elicit a smile.
"It has been." Harry hummed.
Happy reading!
“Why can’t I just be happy? Why do I have to feel like I’m a constant disappointment- an inconvenience to everyone around me?” Harry let out a shaky breath and Draco realized he was crying.
He had renovated the upstairs the most, re-building some rooms altogether. The musty old drawing-room had been completely re-done. He tore out the carpet and the doxie-infested curtains, gutted the hideous chandelier, and trashed the furniture and strange artifacts. He had painted the room in soft yellows and bought furniture more suited to his tastes. The Black Family Tree tapestry had been pulled aside to reveal another magical window that changed its scenery to fit the mood of the occupant of the room. Draco had scoffed at the color scheme and tapped his wand against the door frame to turn all of the yellows into varying shades of blue. He had used yellow because he had wanted to make the room as bright and cheerful as possible, but Harry had to admit it looked better with blue. Perhaps Draco would help him finish renovating the top floors.
“Surely there is an amendment that allows the wizarding world to be revealed to muggle partners. They can’t expect us to keep our very essence from a significant other.” Draco didn’t sound very hopeful.
Draco schooled his features into a mask of indifference as he followed his parents upstairs. Perhaps if he were allowed to go he could find a way to save Harry.
“That’s where you will be the safest.” She muttered distractedly, still resolutely refusing to let Hermione’s hand go as they descended the stairs into the dungeon.
“Why don’t you team up with Dean?” Draco asked Seamus curiously.
"What's wrong with me, Sirius?" Harry hardly whispered. Sirius still heard him.
He’s dead.
“Am I though?” Pansy smirked, sipping her drink. “Think about it. Over the years, other than you and Hermione, who is the one person Harry spent the most time worrying about?”
As he walked he mulled it over. Maybe dying wouldn’t be so bad. Maybe the pain would finally stop.
He could normally read Draco fairly well, but he wasn't familiar with this new face. He didn't look offended or upset so Harry stuck with honesty.
He braced for impact as Daphne Greengrass rushed over to him and all but tackled him in a hug. She was soon joined by Tracy Davis who wrapped her arms around both of them.
"Bullshit. Tell me." He frowned.
“Oi, they’re basically the gods of punk rock. They revolutionized the music industry in the 70s. That album’s practically a national treasure, I’ve never seen an actual copy before. I’ve got to buy this.”  Harry grabbed it from him, flipping it over to check the price. “Figures it’s bloody expensive.”
“You saw Snape?” Hermione blinked. “You saw into his mind again, didn’t you? Oh, Harry! I told you to clear your mind!”
“I’ll remember that.” Draco brightened at the prospect.
“I wouldn’t have been able to kill him without you.” Harry said softly.
“I know, I get it! Me too. It’s harder for you because your family is the most trusted, but I get it. You’re not alone in any of this.” Theo frowned.
“I think it’s good, but I might be biased because he is a friend.” Pansy chewed on her lip nervously.
“You made me feel stupid, actually. Talking about houses and Quidditch when I’d only learned I was a wizard not even twelve hours before. I was just wishing I had something more interesting to say than ‘no’.”
There were people dancing under the canopy, people sitting around the blazing bonfire, and others were running around chasing each other and being drunken idiots. It was nice seeing so many different personalities meshing into a cohesive unit.
“Well, come on then.” Draco stepped back and swept his arm in a grand gesture, inviting Harry inside.
"Ah, Harry." Sirius smiled and got out of the chair, bringing him over to the sofa. "Sit with me, they won't miss us, I promise." He motioned for Harry to join him as he sat down.
He had never danced with him like that.
“We were all so worried about you.” his voice cracked on the last word and Draco rubbed his thumb over Theo’s cheekbone in a soothing repetitive motion. Silver eyes met gold and suddenly Theo was outright crying. Draco patted the bed next to him and Theo climbed in gingerly, careful to avoid jostling him.
Harry watched his form get blurrier the farther away he walked and sighed. That was not how he hoped that would end.
“I doubt it.” Harry squinted up at the rotating pods. “They’re supposed to hold, like, thirty-five people at a time.”
Malfoy jumped off the counter and crowded Harry till he had him pushed up against the wall. Harry got lost in fathomless depths of liquid mercury as Malfoy stared him down.
“Same way I know your favorite Hogwarts meal was the pot roast, but you never took the dinner rolls and that your favorite dessert is pie.” He shrugged unashamedly.
It would have been wonderful to have the Boy Who Lived in Hufflepuff. Their house was vastly underappreciated and they deserved some recognition. Cedric Diggory becoming the Hogwarts champion was like an answer to prayer, but Ari had already graduated at that point and hadn’t gotten the chance to see him bring glory and honor to their humble house. Then he had been murdered during the third task, immortalizing him as the first victim of the second Great Wizarding War. It wasn't exactly the legacy Hufflepuff deserved.
“Right. That makes me feel loads better." Draco huffed. "Has anyone brought an outsider to this thing before?” he asked dubiously.
Was she listening? He had quite literally just told them. He was under the influence of truth serum. Did she think his answer would change?
They had a unique ebb and flow of graceful power, perfectly portraying the antagonistic relationship between siblings. Blaise played Marvolo Gaunt flawlessly as well, and Draco had to commend Madame Juliette for her impeccable casting.
🎂🎉Birthday surprise!🎉🎂
“Crucio!” A cold, familiar voice boomed over the dreamscape and Draco crumpled on the ground, screaming.
Harry squinted at it and then looked around. It took a moment for Draco to realize he was looking for his glasses.
He could see, hear, smell, and taste everything around him. He could hear the swish of fabric against fabric as the Death Eaters scurried to and fro. He could hear his heart beating in his chest and the blood pumping through his veins. He could smell the putrid stench of Fenrir Greyback. He could taste the air like it had been charged by lightning. Yet he still could not move, wand arm still pointing at Dumbledore’s heart.
“Of course, that is being no problem.” It bowed deeply.
“Coffee?” He looked up hopefully
“I’ll take that as a ‘yes’.” She smirked, grabbing Harry’s hand and dragging him onto the dancefloor.
“Safety first, son. Orders second. Don’t martyr yourself for him.” He whispered so softly Draco hardly dared believed he had said anything. Something about his words echoed Pansy’s mantra of 'sod the world save yourself’ and Draco gave a small nod.
“You’re joking.” Draco deadpanned.
“No! You don’t get it! You don’t wake up every day wishing you hadn’t. Your mind doesn’t constantly tell you the world would be so much better if you weren’t in it or that your friends only put up with you because they pity you. You don’t constantly think about how easy it would be to just end it and put everyone out of their misery, save them the burden of having to deal with you and your issues! Don’t you dare try to tell me that my life is perfect! It’s miserable, it’s worthless- it’s the farthest fucking thing from perfect!” Before he knew what was happening he was being enveloped on each side by a warm embrace.
“There will be no more sorting at Hogwarts school.” The Dark Lord said conversationally, stroking Nagini’s snout as she coiled around his shoulders. “There is only one house now. All of the others are obsolete. The emblem, shield, and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone.”
“Give him time.” She sighed.
“He was only hit with a stunner! I saw it!” Stan’s mask was already off.
Malfoy and Nott didn’t look disgusting together. No one else seemed to regard them any differently than the other couples dancing around them. Properly paying attention now, he noticed numerous same-sex dance partners flouncing around the floor. No one seemed to think it was weird or indecent.
Then night falls. Then everything goes quiet. A hurricane of loud thoughts and bottled up grief and fear and anger rages. He can't sleep, and even when he could he was plagued with nightmares about Cedric and Sirius. Everyone thought he was so strong. That he was Harry freakin Potter! He should be able to handle anything. After all, what was life if you weren't constantly fighting Voldemort? Sirius was gone. There was no one left for him to talk to. He felt like he was suffocating, gasping for breath. It was all getting to be just too much.
“And how do you know that?” Draco grinned, glad he wasn’t the only one to notice the small details.
The rest of the dorm was gathered around him with matching expressions of shock and fear. Harry felt like throwing up. No, he was going to throw up. He leaned over the edge of his mattress and let the pain overwhelm him for a moment. When he was done he pushed himself up in bed and cradled his head in his hands.  He had to tell Ron! He had to warn him!
"You'd look really good with gauges," Harry said without thinking. He felt his cheeks burn when he realized he had said that out loud.
“No, because then she wins.” Draco refused to let him go. “We’re allowed to love whoever we want. I’m not ashamed of it, so why hide to make wankers like her feel better?”
The stupid old bat was exchanging pleasantries with Death Eaters. Just as Dumbledore was expressing his shock that he had invited the wolf here amongst his friends he finally found his voice.
“I think I just needed to hear you say it.” Harry placed several chaste kisses on his lips, nose, and cheeks.
Malfoy gripped his thighs tightly while he swallowed every inch, stroking him with his tongue in wonderful and impossible ways with each pass. Harry was aware that unintelligible sounds were erupting from his throat but he couldn’t be arsed to stop them. Malfoy made a pleased little hum in the back of his throat that sent vibrations through Harry’s cock and up his spine in powerful waves of pleasure.
“Maybe next time we can see if it’s possible to rent out a private pod.” Harry suggested as they moved closer to the platform, coming to a stop on the bottom step.
“She wanted me to wear a necklace.”
Dumbledore looked rather stressed as he stepped back from the podium and rushed out of the great hall. It was a testament to his mental state that the speech was so short. While Dumbledore never gave particularly superfluous speeches it was obvious that this one had been cut quite short.
“My what?” Harry eyed her wand dubiously.
“I want a black trench coat,” Draco smirked. “And the main character was rather hot.”
“Keep the questions relevant to Draco’s case.” The minister boomed, obviously fed up with having to keep reminding the court to stay on topic.
“Here,” Harry picked up another ball. “You have to put a little more power behind it to get to the higher numbers.” He released the ball with a flourish and it bounced into the fifty-point hole.
"Right." Draco glanced around as anxiety rose in his throat. "No big deal."
Draco sent a silent prayer to whatever gods were listening to keep Harry safe. He was good at getting himself out of tight spots. Merlin, please let him get out of this one too. Before the Dark Lord tortured and killed him.
"Maybe Quidditch won't be so bad?" Pansy gave him a playful push.
“You can’t go on your date with Harry looking like that.” Pansy scoffed.
“Did you win?” Draco elected to ignore the insincere apology.
"Harry?" He gasped. "What are you doing here?! If he finds you he'll kill you!"
“It’s not George.” Ron snorted, burying a knowing smirk in his own mug. “Just trust me.”
They were almost there, but Greg was getting rather heavy. He stumbled down a secret passage that was, blessedly, free of stairs. It had a steep incline, though, and Draco struggled not to fall. If he could get him to the infirmary he could patch him up. He was no expert, but he had done extensive amounts of research into healing magic. He could at least make sure Greg wouldn’t die too.
“Sorry for the disturbance, boys. I hope she didn’t harass you too much.” The officer gave them an apologetic smile.
His reflection looked haggard. He had stubble on his chin and his eyes had black circles underneath them. He needed to clean up if he was going to have to endure an entire night of people shaking his hand and clamoring for his attention. Maybe Hermione knew a spell to make him look better rested. He used his wand to shave quickly and even pulled a brush through his rat's nest that barely managed to pass for hair before scrubbing his face and brushing his teeth as quickly as possible. When he looked semi-presentable he pulled on the clothes that had been thrown at him and opened the door to find Ron and Hermione snogging on his bed.
The two spells collided in mid-air, sounding like cannon fire. Draco watched the Elder wand arc high, dark against the brilliant sunrise. It spun across the room, sailing towards the master that it would not kill. With the unerring skill of a seeker, Harry plucked the wand from the air. The Dark Lord fell backward, arms splayed, killed by his own rebounding curse. He hit the floor with anticlimactic finality and total silence fell.
Christmas dinner was looming ever nearer and Draco was terrified. That left only two days before he would be introduced to The Dark Lord. He knew what this was. This was the preliminary meeting where Voldemort would basically interview him and decide to make him a death eater. He knew it would happen some time, but why so soon? He wasn’t even sixteen yet. He was supposed to still have a year! What happened to that rule?
“That’s remarkable. You were privy to you-know-who’s thoughts?” the wizard squeaked.
“Loads.” Harry let out a heavy breath, already feeling lighter.
“What would you call them, then?” Harry challenged.
“Here, help me eat all this before the sun spoils it.” He plucked a grape from the bunch and offered it to Draco.
“I can tell them to go. I know you and Ron don’t get along, and I’m sorry. He was just so sad, and Pansy said you wouldn’t mind, but-”
“Merry Christmas, Draco. How was your holiday?” He said in a patronizing tone.
“But…?” she prompted, her indigo eyes probing his for answers he didn’t want to give.
“That’s quite alright.” a very familiar voice huffed and Pansy’s heart started pounding in her chest. “Why are you in such a rush?”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Draco took a refined sip of his own coffee with a masterfully constructed innocent expression.
“Please state your name and occupation for the court,” The Minister’s deep voice was like a soothing balm.
“Because you looked lonely, Pott- er, Harry. And I wanted bragging rights for having danced with the boy who lived.” She shrugged, glossing over her little slip-up. “Don’t worry, it’s all in the leading. Salazar knows I’ve danced with Draco enough times. I can take care of us, don’t you worry your scarred little head.”
“That’s perfect. Set one aside for me and I’ll be back for it in a bit.” Harry ran a running calculation on how much time he had before Draco was expecting him.
“Potter.” Harry grinned when the man gave no reaction. He really loved the anonymity of the muggle world. “Harry Potter.”
“I’m sorry.” Draco placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder.
“Oh! Draco! Just the man I wanted to see.”
Madam Maxime rushed to greet her champion, wrapping a large blanket around her shoulders. Snippets of rapid-fire French floated back to where Draco and his friends were sitting and he strained to catch the conversation.
“This is incredible, thank you.” He said softly.
“Yeah, it’s brilliant actually. I hope you didn’t wait up for me too long.” Harry said as if it were normal to be questioned by your house elf.
“Are you sure?”
It was strange that they only spent a single day together as a couple yet Draco felt as comfortable with Harry as if they had been dating for years. He supposed some of it might be due to how long he’s had feelings for the prat, but that didn’t explain all of it.
“It was nice chatting, Potter!” Nott called over his shoulder as he happily let Parkinson lead the way.
“I woke up on time for once.” Harry shrugged.
“Come on, you’ve been wanting to ask him out for years! Now is your chance, so take it.” She goaded.
“Not really, our paths never really cross.” He said warily. Had Pansy told her about the bet?
“Well? What did you think?” Harry grinned, placing the still unfinished candy in the now-empty popcorn bucket.
Harry shook his head in an effort to focus. If he didn’t master the summoning charm this lesson Flitwick was sure to double his homework. If he was too much of a coward to kill himself then the least he could do was learn this bloody charm. How hard could it be?
They could die and it would be his fault. He wanted to run. He wanted to rant and rave and force them to turn back into themselves, but there was no point. If anyone got hurt….Harry didn’t think he would be able to live with himself.
Draco’s fingers crinkled the paper as he frantically turned to page seven. Harry had told the press everything. They had discussed what Harry had said in their defense at the trial and then some. The article even held quotes from each of their own testimonies. Granger was also cited as sharing details he had previously been unaware of to clear their name. Harry had even gotten Luna Lovegood to collaborate, adding her story of what it was like being held prisoner in their cellar. She insisted that none of them had been cruel to her personally, and she even shared how Draco had done what he could to take care of her and the other prisoners. Draco almost died when he reached the end of the article. Harry ended the interview by challenging the Ministry. He claimed that he had done some questionable things during the war, just like Draco and his family. If the Ministry decided to send them to Azkaban Harry said they should send him as well. He had rather eloquently argued that if they insisted on punishing good people for the bad things they had done in such uncertain times then they should do it thoroughly.
“Yeah?” He turned around with a resigned expression. Harry and Granger stopped with him but they made no move to walk back towards the Slytherins.
“Fleur invited me.” Malfoys silver eyes flicked over to him while he fastened his cufflinks. “We became rather close during the Triwizard Tournament and she asked me to be a Bridesman.”
"Too right." Andromeda nodded. "Please, continue."
“Yes, but you’re the host so you have to look better than everyone else.” Pansy glared at him, her violet eyes flashing playfully.
“No problem, you’re not my type!” Harry called as he and his cronies headed towards the open front doors.
“What my darling girlfriend means,” Hermione gave Pansy a fond glare behind her back “is that she wants to fix your red eyes so it doesn’t look like you’ve just been crying.”
“You normally live for the bust- can’t get you to shut up about it. Every time we get back from one you immediately seek out Ron to give him a play-by-play, and yet here you are- Harry James Potter, willingly starting paperwork.” Zach stared at the file in his hands in mock horror.
“I did. It was wonderful, thank you.” Draco frowned, his silver eyes searching his face for something. "You didn't like it?"
“What does Harry get to call you, then?” Dean asked with a wicked grin.
Blaise clapped him on the shoulder consolingly and Draco gave him a ghost of a smile. Without another word, he took off for the Vantage. When he was finally, blessedly alone, his eyes started to brim with tears. Harry hadn’t explicitly said it, but that certainly felt a lot like a breakup. He took a moment to collect himself before turning the engine over and pulling out of the parking lot. Harry was just climbing into Luna’s hatchback as Draco passed. The look they exchanged as he drove by only confirmed Draco’s fears.
Draco’s shoulders sagged as she withdrew her wand from his throat. Without any warning, he was falling face-first onto the decorative rug in the family room. Every muscle in his body was frozen.
That was most definitely not the case now.
“There’s nothing you can do?” Harry asked helplessly. The last thing he wanted to do was be vulnerable with Draco sodding Malfoy.
So here he was, at Draco’s home, knocking on his door at eight o’clock at night after fighting with the higher-ups at the Ministry all bloody day. He probably looked like a wreck.
“I suppose we better go find Ron before he eats everything.” Hermione sighed as they made their way down the hall.
“Do I?” Harry was slightly taken aback by the abrupt subject change. “How so?”
The pie was delicious. They both ate two slices before Draco wrapped the rest and put it away. When they were both settled with mugs of hot coffee Harry pushed the gift bag towards him.
"She's...interesting." Draco said with the strangest expression on his face.
Pansy plays both sides of the fence, Hermione drags Harry shopping, Harry picks out a thoughtful gift, Draco finds that Ginny Weasley is actually sort of funny, and Harry and Draco bond at a beach party.
“You do.” She shot her a cheeky smile and Pansy felt like her chest might burst. “Oh, but hold on, what about Draco?”
“Insanely.” She sighed. “It’s over now, though. Thank Merlin.”
“Yes, my Lord. Thank you for this most gratuitous opportunity.” His father knelt before the Dark Lord and the others followed suit.
They took off down the stairs and the guards' angry shouts followed them. They ran as fast as they dared down the deadly winding staircase, laughing at the thrill of the chase. When they reached a landing Harry pulled Draco through the door and down the brightly lit hall. Just as the stair door opened Harry spotted a janitor's closet that was slightly ajar.
Theo couldn’t possibly hold him accountable for what he said in his sleep. He would gladly be rid of his inane feelings for the Gryffindor. It wasn't his fault!
“We should split up. Follow the sound of their footsteps, alright? Remember, we need to bring Potter back alive.” He whispered. Greg and Vince nodded, each taking a different flank. That left Draco to go down the middle. He grimaced as he passed the vanishing cabinet he had used to sneak Death Eaters into the castle last year, the night he almost became a murderer.
“I really don’t want to hear it, Pans.” He said with just a tad too much bite.
“I care about him too.” His voice faltered slightly and he hoped Bill didn’t notice.
Harry couldn’t bear to maintain eye contact so he looked down instead. As he watched, his dried blood lifted from his skin and clothing and then vanished.
“Have you ever had McDonalds?” Harry looked at him expectantly.
“Good! Now we’re getting somewhere.” Pansy smirked. “What issues could the poor Golden Wanker Who Lived possibly have?”
“Nev got you an Old Fashioned.” Harry held the rocks glass out for him, happy to have a valid reason for calling him over.
“Is this true?” The officer looked at the wizened old man that was standing next to her.
“Good morning! Can I help you?” A kind-looking middle-aged man greeted him as he came out of the back with a fresh tray of coffee cakes in his hands.
It took ages to go over the terms and conditions of their release in the Minister's stuffy office. Draco had never imagined being pardoned would entail such copious amounts of paperwork. When they finally exited the Ministry he half expected to see Harry waiting to greet them after the intense emotion displayed in the article. He found Pansy, and oddly enough, Granger waiting for them instead. He had to admit that he was a little surprised. He thought Pansy had been having him on when she wrote to him about getting together with Granger.
"It was." Draco sighed. "Luckily I had Pansy or I don't think I would have survived."
"Really?" Harry sounded pleased.
“Yeah, that sounds great actually.” Harry tried to shake the melancholy that had settled in his chest, but it wouldn’t budge.
Harry chuckled and apparated them back to Draco’s beach house. As soon as they arrived in one piece Draco let go of his arm and cast a finite incantatem over the both of them.
“What happened in your sixth year?” the same bored sounding wizard from earlier cut off the others questions, clearly eager to keep things moving. Draco was immensely grateful. “Mr. Potter said he nearly killed you in a duel. Walk us through what happened.”
“What’s wrong?” Harry automatically reached up to stroke the back of Draco’s head, marveling at the soft texture of his hair.
Draco immediately pushed back from the table and raced into his living room. An ornate easel was set up in front of his bay window with a blank canvas resting on it and a large jug of linseed oil was on the floor next to it. Pansy always knew exactly what to get him. He returned to the kitchen and picked up the next present. This one was from Hermione and it was oddly shaped. It was a struggle to get the wrapping off without ripping it, but he managed. When he finally saw what it was he was pleasantly surprised.
They just might survive this.
“What is your best guess?” they pressed.
“How did you survive?” another witch asked.
And smut! Sweet, stay the night smut.
"Draco?" He asked tentatively.
The Slytherins immediately broke into smaller groups, the older students making a beeline for the couches and armchairs by the roaring fire as the room filled with excited buzzing.
Andromeda made a surprised sound so he paused.
“Are you kidding? They would never be able to accept a Slytherin champion.” Draco snorted bitterly. “I’m honestly shocked the real Hogwarts champion wasn’t a Gryffindor. Something to be said about the goblet being impartial, I suppose. Dumbledore would have never picked a Hufflepuff over someone from his old house. Biased git.”
“I’m sorry.” Harry followed her lead, staring at the amber liquid in his own glass instead of making eye contact. “I didn’t mean to worry you, I haven’t been too much for company these past few months.”
“They haven’t, but I’m sure if they looked they would find them.” Harry greeted her with a warm smile.
His father looked like he was in shock. His jaw was hanging open and awe was evident on his face.
"Come on, people skated on the lake all the time at school. You can't tell me you never went." Harry was clearly more familiar with these contraptions he had informed him were called ice skates. Draco watched as he wrapped the long laces around his ankle twice before tying it off.
How could he stand here so calmly and discuss the intricate mechanics of his own death? Draco fought the now familiar wave of nausea he associated with being a Death Eater. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latter’s heart. Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, “I had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one’s used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.”
“I… I can’t think past the pain, Theo.” Draco’s voice sounded weak even to his own ears.
The number of muggles on the ice slowly started to dwindle as it grew nearer to eight o'clock. Draco came to a stop by the wall gap that led back to the rental counter, bracing for impact when he saw Harry barreling towards him. Instead of slamming him into the wall, Harry used his momentum to wrap his arms around Draco in a forceful hug that almost drug them both down onto the ice but Draco steadied them before they could fall.
What do you get someone you used to hate, that saved your life, and now you’re on awkward terms? It was a weird line to walk. He moved slowly through the aisles, occasionally picking something up to inspect it before discarding it as too shallow or too weird. He even gave some of the tea sets a cursory glance before moving on. They were all flowery and bright, garish colors. Malfoy would probably hate those. At the end of the aisle, a black set that was sparkling caught his eye and he had to back up because he almost passed it.
“I never really had ice cream growing up.” Harry shrugged.
"Hey, Draco!" A voice sounded behind him and he jumped.
If you've stuck with me this long, thank you!!! If you're just joining, welcome! If you like what you're reading, leave kudos and a comment! They fuel my writing fire. If you don't like it, leave a comment on what I can do better. Happy reading!
“How am I supposed to ask him? We never cross paths.” Draco seemed delighted by the obstacle.
When Fred let him go to the sound of wolf whistles and gasps of shock, George took over and Harry lost all sense of reality again. George was much gentler than Fred and Harry appreciated both ends of the spectrum. The burning, searing kiss from Fred, and the soft, loving kiss from George. They balanced each other out perfectly.
He didn’t even know which way was up, but he fought against the current, struggling to break free. Time was meaningless. Each second lasted a lifetime. The next thing he knew for certain was real was the sound of quiet voices.
That’s how the Dark Lord had survived the rebounding killing curse all those years ago. He had committed the greatest atrocity known to wizardkind. He had made a horcrux. The Weasel’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts and he immediately became nauseated. He said another horcrux down. As in the Dark Lord had multiple. The thought of it was enough to make him gag. Greg and Vince shot him worrying looks but he shook his head. There was a massive explosion nearby and a high pitch scream cut through the sounds of battle.
“Come on, boy wonder. For me?” She batted her eyelashes at him and he sighed.
The very same eyes that were growing less and less patient with each passing second.
“Are you done with these?” Draco motioned towards the mess he had made of the sketchbooks and Harry felt the heat spread from his cheeks to his neck.
It made sense, he supposed. Dumbledore had said he didn't trust anyone else to keep Malfoy safe and Harry had begrudgingly accepted the task.
Harry had a house-elf?
“The bad news is, that means this will be our last session.” Draco frowned.
“Is that so?” Draco’s silver eyes flicked over to meet his in confusion.
“Level two, Auror Headquarters” the smooth disembodied voice announced and Harry filed out with a couple of other wizards.
“Well, we’re fixing that today.” Harry said brightly as the queue moved forward.
"I know, these are phenomenal. Thank you so much."
“Our records show that Draco Malfoy was alone with Dumbledore on top of the tower until other death eaters arrived.” A bespectacled old witch arched an eyebrow at him.
“Do you want me to run through anything again?” He pressed, trying his best not to sound pushy or rude.
Other than Harry, Nev had always been his favorite dorm mate.
“I don’t know.” His voice was shaking and he kicked himself for appearing weak in front of the others. “I can’t tell.”
By the time Draco and the ginger made it back inside Theo was on his third Long Island. He watched as Draco ditched the redhead and started flirting with a burly man wearing leather by the billiard tables.
“Exactly,” Draco waved his hands about. “Just because Pansy and I hang out, doesn’t mean we are dating. Boys and girls can be friends, you know.”
“Don’t be stupid!” Hermione threw her arms around Harry’s neck. “We don’t hate you.”
“Your father said he would make sure we won,” Harry said, shaking his head.
As he opened his drawers, Harry realised how limited his options were. Stained shirts and baggy jeans seemed to be all Harry owned. Most of his wardrobe still consisted of hand-me-downs from Dudley. As Harry dug around for something new, he realised Draco had already seen him in all the clothes he owned. He wondered if the other boy thought he were a slob. Then he berated himself for caring so much about what Malfoy thought.
Harry laughed at the man’s vulgarity and nodded his head.
“Yeah, but it was implied.”
He made his way down the stairs slowly, careful not to make any noise. He walked into the open living room and paused. Sirius was sitting with his back to Harry on the couch watching the television. The room was dark, only lit by the dull light emanating from the television which played a generic quiz show. Harry took a deep breath. He walked to the side of the couch and placed himself in the edge of Sirius’s sight while making sure he in no way blocked the television. That had never gone down well with Uncle Vernon.
It was definitely Potter. Draco was sure, even if he could barely hear the other boy over the excited yaps of the beast.
Remus took a breath, his head nodding slightly.
Harry saw the determination set in Sirius’s expression, and nodded.
“What? What’s wrong?”
Harry nodded, thinking over the blonde’s usual attitude before the summer.
Another head shot up next to him, honey brown hair sticking out at various angles. Harry’s eyes widened. Words escaped him. He stood stock still, his mouth agape.
Harry and Remus shared a look behind Sirius’s back before making their way up the marble staircase. The building became more intimidating as they approached. The pillars lining the walkway looked like Greek ruins before they became ruins, white and unchipped. When they finally arrived at the top of the stairs, Sirius straightened his shirt and brought a hand up to knock. Before his fist could connect, however, the doors were thrust open, startling both Harry and Remus.
“I can’t believe its already the first day of our Fifth Year!” Hermione was speaking so quickly, it sounded like she was humming. Like she had already drunk three cups of coffee. “Do you know how important our exams are going to be this year? I feel like I’m already behind.”
“It’s about my boy, Draco,” Malfoy said. Harry’s furrowed his eyebrows. “Ever since we cancelled our holiday, he’s been… testy.”
Sirius wiped the counter again.
“Yeah alright.”
The three stared at each other, embarrassment clear on the faces of everyone. Remus cleared his throat, breaking the awkward moment.
It was a simple statement. Bare. There were no extra words to hide the implication of what was said. Harry flinched.
Yet, it didn’t take long for Draco to place his hands in Harry’s, his soft skin touch steady as it brushed against calloused fingers. They held onto each other for longer than both knew socially acceptable, staring at the other with a confusing mix of defiance and trust.
“I’ve got one flat white and two hot chocolates,” the waitress was standing at their table balancing a tray with three mugs.
“Harry, tea?”
“So?” Remus sighed, his face downcast, sombre. “The trial didn’t go well?”
“Your the one that brought it up. Excuse me for being interested!”
As soon as he said it, Harry expected a fight. He expected harsh words, screaming, maybe even fists. What he wasn’t expecting, was for Draco to do nothing.
“We aren’t really sure what we are after,” Sirius answered. “But I bet Harry will know when he sees them.”
A meeting had needed to be organized by a social worker the first time. Harry had gone to an office based in London without the Dursleys knowing. He had dressed himself up, wearing his best jeans that only had one hole in them and a shirt that, although still big, didn’t hang off his shoulders like his others. He used the spare change he had found throughout his daily chores to buy a bus ticket and prayed the phone call he had received a week earlier was not just a practical joke. He truly hoped his godfather truly wanted to meet him.
Harry had first met Sirius in July when he was 14, just having finished his third year at Hogwarts. Sirius was fresh out of prison and Harry was living with the Dursleys. It was at the end of their first meeting Sirius had asked Harry if he wanted to come live with him.
“Thank you,” Harry smiled at Draco at he took one of the boxes. “You didn’t have to buy me popcorn though.”
“You can choose. Nothing fancy though! Just somewhere that does takeaway, alright?”
“Why is Harry calling Draco Malfoy?!”
“Yeah, I went to the movies, by myself,” He emphasised the last word too much. He prayed Ginny didn’t pick up on it. “Um, and, I couldn’t decide what to watch. Luna told me to watch um…”
“What do you want to do?”
“What, really?”
So, not able to find an excuse to say no, Harry found himself in a dinged-up maroon Volkswagen with two doors and one broken, taped up window. No students loitered on the schoolgrounds, all the buses gone by the time Harry and Remus left the castle and no parents were left to pick up children. All that was left were a few cars in the teachers parking lot, each varying in levels of expense.
“I don’t believe it. He’s probably just waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Give it a week, he will be back to his usual shit, I bet.”
Harry responded with a similar greeting.
They entered into a large lobby. It looked to be furnished like a rich person’s house, with gold trimming along furniture and luxurious cabinets. Ahead of the them was a receptionist desks.
When he returned to the lobby, he started to head back to his seat when her heard a voice he would recognize anywhere. An unmistakable drawl that had Harry’s skin crawling.
“What are you doing?” Hermione asked. Not in the way that meant she was curious, but in the accusatory, ‘you better not be serious’ way.
“I keep screwing things up with the people I’m meant to care about the most. I never believed you when you said you were innocent. I never noticed anything about Harry’s relatives. I mean, I just thought he liked the Weasleys better. And now I wouldn’t be surprised if you don’t want me in your lives. Either of you,” he finished with a shuttering breath.
So, thank you guys so much for all the support you have offered for my FIRST EVER attempt at writing fanfiction. I fucking loved writing this story and I will definitely be writing more in future. Until then, I hope you enjoy this chapter.
“It’s fine.”
A startled laugh escaped Harry and he soon had a lapful of dog as Snuffles buried his nose into Harry’s neck and started sniffing. Harry’s laughter got louder and soon Sirius was joining him with loud joyous barks of his own. His neck felt completely wet as the large dog ran his nose over Harry’s face.
“Isn’t that a bit quick?”
“Well, are you just going to stand there or are you going to sit down?”
“Don’t worry, I don’t feel like that for you either,” He looked to Ginny. “We are just friends!”
“Because, I tell you what, I have had a fantastic day. Snuffles and I, well we went for a walk this morning, then after we came home, I thought I’d give baking a go,” Sirius continued prattling on, bursting around the room as he spoke, moving books from the book shelf and ruffling the throw pillows.
“What language is that even in?”
“We’ve got this, Harry,” Sirius repeated his mantra, sounding like he was trying to convince himself more than Harry.
“Nothing!” Harry rubbed the back of his neck. Another awkward silenced passed before Harry remembered Mrs. Malfoys words. “Um, your mum said supper is at 7pm and to not be late.”
“Yeah, we should probably head back.”
Harry looked around frantically, and then, without warning, took off sprinting, leaving Malfoy with Snuffles on the side of the road.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, Ron, I’ll be fine. Besides, it’s not like I have the money to go overseas. Or even a passport.”
The Malfoys all followed Sirius’s gaze, Lucius and Narcissa delicately turning their heads, Malfoy straining his neck.
“Do you want to order a coffee?” Sirius asked.
“It’s against the rules,” She had hissed at them, while Harry and Ron shoved soda cans and lollies into their pockets.
It was Tuesday and the rain outside came down in thick drops. The sky was a hazy grey that showed no hints of clearing. With Sirius help, Harry had hauled the television up to his room. That was where he and Malfoy spent the day, perched on Harry’s bed mindlessly flicking for anything that might catch their attention. However, day time television was a not a formidable opponent for boredom, leaving them with nothing but mindless cooking shows, and soap operas to choose from.
“Did you see that?” Hermione ushered them into seats towards the middle. “Malfoy saw us and didn’t even say anything. How bizarre is that?”
“Well then. I suppose I better chat with Harry about the possibility of a new Dad,” the words came out drier than they were meant to, with less humour and more awkwardness. The chuckle sounded forced and pained.
“Cousin Sirius,” Mrs. Malfoy threw her arms out, greeting Sirius in a soft embrace.
“Fuck you,” Sirius spat, leaping to his feet. The anger he had been repressing for the past few months came surfacing up and was bellowing out of his mouth before he could think.
Lucius tutted, his patience was wavering thin.
“No, actually,” Potter shook his head. His eyebrows were scrunched. “I think I would like it if you came over again.”
“Oh yeah, of course Harry,” Sirius inspected two black mugs as he spoke to Harry. “Do you know his number?”
When they ate, Harry was seated beside Draco and Sirius, listening as Remus and Mrs. Malfoy discussed the gaps in Hogwarts curriculum. Mr. Malfoy sat at the head of the table, sipping red wine from a crystal glass. When he noticed Harry looking, he sent the boy a small, barely-there smile, before tucking into his dinner with stiff etiquette. Harry shot a look to Sirius, watching the other man stare smitten at the teacher as he rattled off the topics he was wished to introduce to his classes.
Basically, I am no longer living with the Dursleys. I haven’t been for about four months now. I swear, I meant to tell you, but with everything happening at once, I just didn’t know how to. The past couple of weeks have been really intense. My godfather Sirius Black has taken me in after he got out of prison, but I swear he is totally safe and nice! He went through all these checks and we did meetings through social services and its totally fine. I just never told you guys because I guess I thought it would make everything disappear. Anyway, yesterday we had a guardianship hearing against the Dursleys, and Sirius won! I never have to go back to the Dursleys Ron! Its insane.
Despite everything, Harry found himself laughing along to his friends’ complaints. The sun beamed down on them and Ron had long since shed his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and untied his tie. Harry had loosened his own tie and removed his jacked, leaving his sleeves rolled down. Hermione’s uniform was untouched, immaculate as ever. The three of them walked across the grass fields to the bus pick up zones, where most the school was now gathered. The rowdy mood was unmistakable.
“I don’t know if anyone told you,” he started. “But before your parents died, they made me your guardian.”
It was a few moments before anybody moved from the doorway.
Harry laughed.
“Um, I don’t know, where… or what…” Harry stumbled over his words.
“That’s not the word Uncle Vernon used.”
Absentmindedly, Potter ran his hands through Snuffles hair. He didn’t respond, and irritation was swimming in Draco’s chest.
Sirius froze.
“No! I refuse to let those fuckers get a cent after the shit they put Harry through! Also, could you imagine if Harry found out? That I practically bought him, like a goddamn animal!” Sirius shook his head and spoke through gritted teeth. “It was never an option.”
“Oh Harry,” Sirius breathed, his eyes rushing over harry, taking all of him in. “You look just like your father. Except your eyes. You have your mothers’ eyes.”
Sirius jerked. He moved to bolt out of his chair but was stopped short when Harry grabbed his arm. He wore the same murderous expression from before. Harry looked to Mr. Malfoy for help but was surprised to find the other man looked just as disturbed by his Uncles comment. Mr. Malfoys eyes were narrowed and his lips thinly pressed. He looked ready for blood.
“I mean, there’s no way he couldn’t hear those fuckers. No, no, its only me he hears. Wanker.”
“This conversation isn’t about me, Harry. If you aren’t comfortable with me dating Remus than I will leave it. I understand you just learnt about us and haven’t come to terms with it yet.”
I know it's been way too long since my last update, and I apologise for making you guys wait. I started full time work at the start of the year and it's been more intense than I anticipated. On top of that, this Virus has been a real shit kicker that hasn't given me any time off whatsoever, and only increased my workload.
Harry laughed, but his grin was genuine. It was like he still wasn’t used to being told yes. And he wasn’t. He stood up and made his way to the hallway where their landline was hanging.
“My dear godson, you set the bar very low.”
“What’s so hard to believe about it? They can’t be that bad,” Sirius frowned. “…right?”
Harry pulled a face.
“Lucius,” he greeted, shaking the man’s hand.
Harry.
A hand lightly touched his shoulder causing him to jump. When he looked up, his eyes were still blurry from the excessive pressure he had applied to them.
“Oh, I’m sorry I’m a little bit stressed about the fact that I may not be living here in a weeks’ time!” The sentence started through gritted teeth but escalated into sharp words.
Next chapter has Remus, I promise. Sorry for making you all wait.
Sirius rubbed the back of his neck. He crossed his arms.
Harry noticed Ron’s stare was stuck on the very person Harry was looking for. Standing at the doors of the Great Hall, Draco Malfoy stood in the centre of his Slytherin friends, an amused smirk adorning his face as he listened to Pansy Parkinson prattle on.
Heat flared across his cheeks.
Harry looked over to Melissa as well, pleading with his eyes for her to say yes. She looked between the two of them, and for the first time, Harry noticed she was not smiling. She stared at him, and Harry couldn’t decide what she was thinking, only that something was puzzling her.
“Oh, yes, I remember. I just never thought you were telling the truth.”
“Fine. I was thinking about calling Remus. To chat.”
“Pansy, she is my cousin,” Draco turned his attention on Parkinson, his eyes narrowed. “Not only that, she has had a shite time of it. You know what happened to her mum. Stop giving me shit for trying to be a decent relative for the first time ever.”
It wasn’t long before Sirius joined the two, sandwiching Snuffles between them as he reached over to hold Harry’s hand.
“Has the kid told you?”
“No,” Sirius agreed. “But I am not paying money.”
With that, he practically skipped to the front door. Begrudgingly, Harry ran a quick hand through his hair and followed him.
“What the fuck!” Harry yelped as he twirled around to face his captor.
“Ok, Ok,” Sirius held up his hands in a peaceful stance, attempting to calm his panicked godson. “I had to check. I want to know if this is going to be a problem. It was stupid of me not to think this would become an issue sooner.”
In history, a menial, mind-numbing documentary was played, which in truth was just as ineffective as listing to Professor Binns drone on, on any normal day. Harry and Ron had a running bet with Hermione the guy was a ghost. The man was ancient and looked to be over 100 years old, his pale grey skin too abnormal for him to still be alive. In history, Harry tried to catch up on the sleep he had lost the night before. Many others in the room had planned to do the same. Neville had started snoring within ten minutes of the class, and Nott and Zabini were attempting to shoot paper wasps into Goyle’s open mouth.
Draco groaned.
“It is best to meet away from other puppies. Too overwhelming, oz’erwise.”
She gave in once they were safely in their seats, taking the packet of Oreo’s Harry had stashed in for her. After the movie they had gone home to Ron’s house. They spent the night in a tent they had set up in the field, trying to convince Hermione the stars they saw were the fictional planets shown in the movie.
They both started to walk away together, glancing back at him from time to time. Harry knew they were talking about him in hushed whispers. It hurt to think about what they were saying.
“Oh, I love this show! Ron and I used to watch it in first year,” Harry exclaimed.
The house he stopped at was small. It looked like every other building in the street, with only a small space between the neighboring houses, and a small garden in the front yard. A large window with a seat on the inside of the house covered the front allowing him to see into a small living room. A footpath lead through the front yard, to the red front door. Across from the house was a park, lined with trees and park benches. Harry smiled at the sight of the house, his heart skipping a beat. The anxiety that had swarmed his chest calmed down as he entered the front gate.
A bark of laughter startled out of Harry.
His room was not large, nor was is small. A double bed sat against the wall furthest from the door and above it was a square window. The duvet was a simple blue colour with matching sheets. Opposite his bed was a dresser. Despite having four drawers, Harry had only managed to fill one. When he had moved in, he had only brought his school stuff; homework, uniform, books, and the photo album Sirius had given him for his birthday. Sirius has since taken him shopping, but Harry refused to get more than was strictly necessary. A spare set of clothes and his school uniform was all he had needed at the Dursleys.
“Yeah, it’s fine.”
She finally looked up at Harry. Her blue eyes sparkled, so like Draco’s and yet, completely different. The kindness she gave away so freely was never something her cousin could replicate. It was unguarded, and fierce.
The booming words echoed through the hallway, making many people pause. None reacted more violently than Harry though. He immediately recognised the voice. Blood drained from his face and his body went rigid, like a corpse entering rigor mortis.
Harry scowled. After a few moments of silence, he pushed his cereal away, scraping the chair as he stood.
“No!” Sirius said emphatically, forehead frowning. “Harry, god no! Don’t ever think that. I love you. Yes, I will admit, I was hurt about how things went last night, but I do not hate you, nor am I mad.”
She chuckled at his reaction, not cruelly, but in a nice, understanding manner.
“No, I’m sure it wasn’t,” Sirius scoffed. “But, Harry, I need you to know not everyone is like your Uncle. And nothing is going to happen to me. I have been like this my whole life, so I would know. You don’t need to worry about me. That’s not your job. It’s my job to worry about you.”
Remus slowly nodded. His lips were thinly pressed, as though he was trying to keep himself from crying out. He swallowed deeply.
“What are you, six?
“I don’t fucking know anymore, Moony!” Sirius exploded, throwing his hands into the air. “What do you want me to say? That I’ve adjusted well to life outside of prison? That I don’t wake up from nightmares every fucking night? That I’m not pissed about the fact I missed out on twelve fucking years of my life because of a fucking mistake I made when I was twenty? What is it you want to hear?!”
“Surely you have other friends,” Sirius said every time, to which Harry always responded,
“I’ve been having trouble,” Harry mumbled, turning away from Remus. “Not Sirius. I’m the one keeping him up.”
“Professor Lupin,” Harry shouted before he could stop himself.
“Nothing was breakable.”
Harry blinked.
“What, he hasn’t told you?”
“What a dick,” Harry mumbled instead, cold shame building in his stomach.
This is for all the Wolfstar fans!
through another.”
They boys laughed.
“Hi,” Harry responded.
Ginny slowly sunk into the seat beside Harry. She continued shooting the two glances, her eyebrows scrunched.
Harry tried to argue with him, to insist he could pay for his own tickets, but Draco was already off. Harry kept an eye on him as he walked away, noticing his sullen attitude. The lag in his steps, the slight slouch in his usually perfect posture. Harry shook his head.
Sirius hummed, looking concerned by the words. The conversation halted. Sirius pointed to the kitchen.
At that, Harry laughed, loud and sharp.
“What?” He asked.
“…yeah.”
“Honestly, I raised you with more patience than that,” she sighed. “Ok, then. It was lovely chatting with you Harry, but Draco is absolutely dying to talk to you, so I best be off.”
They were sitting under the shade of a white and red swirled umbrella eating their ice-cream when Harry remembered their earlier interaction with Professor Lupin.
Sure enough, they had arrived at hells gate itself. Inside loomed a more prominent threat than Harry had been envisioning. Inside, a vampire who did not understand or care for the use of shampoo, awaited them.
They both stopped talking to let the other go. Harry could feel his cheeks heat up, and he hoped his blush wasn’t obvious to the other boy. When neither of them started talking
Potter looked at Draco with calculating eyes. Draco tried not to twitch under the stare.
Harry thought about the offer, before nodding.
“What were you thinking, mate?” Dean chimed in. “You could’ve come played Football with us!”
When the boys finally returned to Harry’s house, Sirius and Mr. Malfoy were still stuck into paperwork. The clock in the living room read it was 10 past 5 and the afternoon sun soaked the house, the orange light seeping through the living room window. Snuffles collapsed on the living room floor immediately, his tongue lolling out the side of his mouth as he panted. Harry and Draco walked quietly into the kitchen while the two men sitting at the kitchen table continued their discussion.
Sirius stood from the couch, and Harry was relieved to see he still wore his plain black shirt and jeans. However, he did notice red and purple marks scattered across his godfathers’ neck. Gross, he thought.
Sorry I had to indulge in a bit of background. The next chapter is back to it all.
The second the words left his mouth, Harry knew he had made a mistake. A flash of hurt crossed over Malfoy, before his face became blank.
Almost instantly, Harry’s attention drew back to his friends. Panic seized his throat. Did they know who he was looking for?
“Please don’t hate me,” Harry mumbled, chin on his knees.
When his eyesight refocused, he was expecting to see Sirius hugging him from behind. He was not expecting to see a ragged man dressed in an old suit with rushed patch jobs fixing the torn fabric. The man had sandy brown hair and kind hazel eyes. He was encouraging Harry to breathe, demonstrating the breathes by counting.
After her words, Luna picked up her apple, taking a small bite. Neither spoke for a few moments. The crowds of student’s chatter, and laughter flowed through the lunch grounds. Harry’s mouth parted, and it took him a few minutes to think of a response.
“Mrs. Figg has also written that she witnessed you throw Mr. Potter from the house that night. There are also details relating to countless other moments where she has seen you physically and verbally assault your nephew,” The judge stared down at the Dursleys. “Is there anything you have to say about that?”
“Thank you, Mrs. Dursley. I only needed to know yes or no.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Never mind. You’re not pale anymore.”
“I might pop off to the loo first, if that’s alright?” Luna asked.
Sirius opened and closed his mouth. He quirked his head to the side.
“Harry,” Remus said, his voice hoarse. He coughed. “I’m sorry. We didn’t hear you come in.”
Remus studied Sirius closely, running his eyes over the other mans face, taking in his hunched shoulders and bitter expression. He gently reached a hand across the table, taking hold of calloused fingers.
“Wait, you mean Harry is calling Draco Malfoy? As in Lucius’s kid.”
Sirius walked towards the desk and sat in one of the armchairs without invitation.
Harry looked at Draco like he had grown a second head.
“I’m worried about it, Draco. You haven’t even spoken to her since we started school. Why now, did you decide to declare that your related to…that!”
“I’m sorry, I just can’t believe Draco Malfoy agreed with something I said. I really should mark this down on the calendar or something.”
“Excuse me,” Harry said once she finally looked up. “Is there a bathroom I can use?”
“Would you like a cup of tea?”
before he could find the lead, noticed dirty dishes in the sink and set about cleaning them. After that, he headed upstairs to help Sirius with the washing, but got halfway up the stairs when he remembered he was about to walk Snuffles. He never did find the dog lead.
Finally she nodded, pointing to the end left wall where a pair of doors resided in the far corner.
Finally, Sirius noticed the other person in their presence. When his eyes caught onto the man, Sirius’ body stilled. He no longer looked at Harry. Instead his eyes were locked on Professor Lupins. Sirius’s expression was harrowing, and Harry was taken aback by the heartbreak that crossed through his godfathers’ eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course not. This is nothing,” Mr. Malfoy inspected a piece of paper he pulled from his brief case, ignoring the two boys in the living room.
“Are you coming with your dad again tomorrow?”
Harry paused and mulled over what Sirius was saying. On one hand, it shouldn’t concern him, but on the other…
“Yes, Harry.”
“But I yelled at you,” Harry shook his head, trying to break Sirius’s hold on him. “I said horrible things about you.”
Draco stared at him, his posture stiff, eyes still wide. He nodded.
Draco thought about lying, about making some grand story up that made him sound cooler. But, as he thought to what Potter had told him, he realised the other boy would not care for his lies.
Harry dropped his spoon in the bowl. He struggled to swallow the cereal in his mouth.
“And Mr. Potter, Black. Are you even listening?”
“Don’t tell me your afraid of ghosts, Potter.”
Malfoy hummed, closing his eyes.
Remus turned to Harry, shooting him a bright, calming smile.
Harry was upstairs pacing in his room when he heard the knocking on the front door. It was Mr. Malfoys usual rhythm; Tap, tap…tap. Harry’s heartbeat spiked, and his hands clenched at his side. He heard Sirius greeting the Malfoys and knew he couldn’t stay up in his room any longer.
“Remember, Black, that’s only a last resort. We won’t be pressing charges unless they force our hand.”
Harry spent Sunday afternoon unsure how he was going to tell Sirius. After already having spent so much adopting Snuffles and buying all the things he needed, Harry was starting to worry Sirius would think it was all too much. There was a small part of him that thought perhaps Sirius would send Snuffles back.
“I have to go talk with Lucius to sort out some stuff,” Sirius hand rested on Harry’s shoulder. “Stay here with Draco and stay near a security guard, ok?”
He had no idea why Potter was mentioning it now.
“Don’t do that!” He demanded.
“No!” The answer was practically screamed. “I still want to live with you! Please!”
Hermione emerged victorious from her bag a moment later with a white tube, something that looked suspiciously like tan lipgloss, and a round compact with a bronze-colored powder. He stared forlornly at his ceiling as she dabbed at his eyes with an oddly shaped sponge.
“That’s fine by me, it’s my turn to buy a round anyway.” He grinned before loping off towards the bar.
Ron rounded the corner, scarlet robes clashing horribly against his hair.
“Please… I feel so... empty without you…” Harry’s voice was weak but they both still heard him.
“What happened the night Mr. Potter was captured and brought to your home? What were you doing when he arrived?” The stern witch cut in over the mutterings of her cohorts.
Draco swallowed hard. When Harry strung it all together like that it sounded so impressive. Harry made it sound like he was some form of unsung hero, but he was nothing. He could have done more. He should have done more. He didn’t deserve to be released. He had earned a one-way ticket to Azkaban when he took the Dark Mark.
“I just feel so trapped, you know? They both expect me to be the perfect little pureblood son. To marry a perfect little pureblood witch and have perfect little pureblood children and to live a perfect little pureblood life.” He sneered at the thought, laughing mirthlessly. “Everyone just assumes that I’m going to continue on my father’s legacy of amassing power behind the scenes and having important people in my pocket. I just don’t want it. I haven’t even told my parents I’m gay. I’m too afraid of how my father will react.”
“Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted Ron. He took several steps toward Harry, who did not back away. “Didn’t you hear what they said about my sister? Death Eaters are running Hogwarts! They tried to steal the sword of Gryffindor FOR YOU!  But you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you? It’s only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I’ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn’t care what happens to her in there — well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff —”
“Oh! Harry, you’re brilliant! I had forgotten about that.” She was looking at the desk waterfall with renewed interest. “Between Pansy and myself I’m certain we can figure something out.”
“You’ll stay with me?” He looked each one of them in the eye. The resolve he found in each pair gave him strength.
“Merlin, Sex Pistols?” Draco pulled out the violently yellow album.
“It is?” His heart felt like it might explode in its second panic attack for the day.
“Isn’t he your...aren’t you two… together?” Hermione blushed.
“Might as well be.” Draco drew in a deep breath, bracing himself for an unpleasant evening. He was going to do his best to get along with the idiotic Gryffindors, for Harry’s sake, but he didn't have high hopes.
“You’ll want to save some of that to chase whatever unholy shot Seamus plagues us with in the next round.” Neville warned him with a sage expression.
The shrill whistle of the kettle broke him out of his thoughts and he rushed to pour the tea. He finally had the chance to use the beautiful black and silver tea tray his mother had given him after the first time she had come over for tea. It matched the set Harry had gotten him perfectly. Draco moved quickly, suddenly eager to get back and make sure this all hadn't been an insanely realistic daydream.
“Er, I haven’t really thought about it.” He fidgeted with his glasses nervously.
“It would have been too much to ask to spend an entire day without bigotry of some form rearing its ugly head.” He said instead.
Why would Dumbledore ever see him as capable of handling the truth?
Before he could think of a response Harry felt a tap on his shoulder. When he turned it was the boy he thought was called Nott with Malfoy hovering behind him looking either terrified or livid. Possibly both.
“Draco is fine.” He prickled at being called Malfoy. That name had been sullied beyond redemption during the war.
"I love you, too. We will see you at home." She shot him a conspiratorial smile, linking arms with his father who looked politely puzzled.
“Yeah?”
Theo sighed and rested his chin on Draco’s shoulder as he recounted for the umpteenth time what had happened after the others had gotten off the train. He still marveled at the novelty of being able to touch Draco like this. His scent was intoxicating. Theo closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, relishing in the smell that was all Draco.
He had trusted Dumbledore, yet all Dumbledore saw him as was expendable. A means to an end.
“You don’t know what I’m capable of.” He hissed.
Harry grabbed his hand and whispered “Run!”
“I can and I am. Unless you want a hair removal potion mixed in with your sleek easy when you least expect it, I suggest you sod off.”
“It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate.” Ron chimed in their defense.
“I’ve got you.” He whispered. “Let it all out.” Draco was mildly surprised when Harry obeyed, letting loose a loud sob as he buried his face in Draco’s chest.
He didn’t see Harry again until Care of Magical Creatures. He took a deep breath when he caught sight of the idiotic Gryffindor already outside of Hagrid’s hut. It was one thing for Pansy to know. Draco couldn’t bear the thought of anyone else finding out he was in love with The Prat Who Lived. He hitched a condescending sneer onto his face as they drew closer, appreciating the fact that the wonder twins were flanking him on either side. Their solid presence behind him made him feel like he might actually be able to pull this off.
When Harry shifted his weight so that he was straddling Draco's lap Draco pulled away. Harry let out an involuntary whine of protest. He had been quite enjoying what was quickly becoming the best snog of his life.
“You can smell dark magic?” Bill arched an eyebrow at him.
“It’s Hopsin’s vacation home. Brilliant, isn’t it?” Hermione had clearly had a hand in the planning of this party. It was well put together and she was positively bristling with pride as green lights joined the blue and white, giving everything a strangely comforting glow.
"Ingenious." Draco marveled, taking the amulet Harry held out for him.
“Too many people?” He asked tentatively.
“He kept pushing me! What was I supposed to do?” Draco backed up several paces in light of Pansy’s fury.
“Trust you to be in the thick of the danger.” Pansy admonished, gesturing for him to slide into the last empty seat.
Harry learns some earth-shattering news and Draco has a hard truth to share. Some old favorites make an appearance and the Dursleys get what they deserve.
“Of course not, Nev. I never mind helping you.” Harry punched him playfully on the arm, causing them both to sway unsteadily.
"Fuck, Potter." Malfoy gasped when Harry sucked on a particularly sensitive spot on his neck.
“Is that why you willingly tortured other people?” The haughty wizard chimed in.
“You’re right, it is easy for me to say. I wish I could fix it and make them see the truth but I can’t, so ignoring them is our best option.” She huffed, glaring at the offending Hufflepuffs as they passed.
“Unfortunately.” Fred grimaced.
"Yeah." Harry grinned sheepishly.
“Yeah.” Draco smiled, leaning down for a quick kiss.
“What?” Harry blinked rapidly, trying to bring himself back into the conversation.
"I know you are preparing to fight. Your efforts are futile, you cannot fight me. I do not wish to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood, but I will if necessary.” There was a pregnant pause and Draco felt his anxiety skyrocket. “Give me Harry Potter, and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will all be rewarded beyond your wildest imaginings.”
Sirius shifted in his seat. His eggs were barely touched. Harry’s plate was cleared.
She led them out the back through a small door behind the reception desk. As they walked through the corridor, Fleur chatted about the dogs available for adoption.
Reaching the end of the hallway, Sirius quickly scanned the various doors and their name plaques. On the left, he saw the name he was after; L. Malfoy. Without thinking twice, he ripped the door open.
“Honestly, you need to pay better attention to your surroundings. We’re here.”
Potter scoffed.
Sirius was going to murder him. That fucking git.
“Well, yeah?”
“She can be, when it suits her,” Draco said. “So, what’s wrong? Has something happened?”
After their coffee’s arrived, Harry had come around the corner and made his way to their table. Snuffles trotted alongside him and resumed his position laying, as Harry took his seat. Sirius had pretended not to notice his godson’s sly smirk. The three of them spent the rest of their morning at the café. They chatted over coffee, and when that was all gone, decided to order lunch. Remus ordered a salad, while Harry and Sirius had burgers.

Harry threw his head back in frustration.
The sharp clicks of heals hitting the tiled floor grew louder. Draco jumped to his feet, and Harry quickly followed. Towards them marched none other than Petunia Dursley. Her face was sour, her back straight, arms swinging quickly at her sides. Draco looked ready to start screaming for a security guard but stopped short when Harry shook his head. Petunia stopped her march mere metres in front of them.
“Honestly, boys! Prefects are meeting today at lunch to go over our duties with Dumbledore.”
“Apparently I have papers I need to sign.”
“Do you want to work things out? After everything?”
“What? How the hell do you even know the right number!” Sirius scrambled with the phone, shoving it to his ear in time to hear a familiar, soothing voice.
“I am fine Sirius, it was nothing. I just tripped over.” he lied.  “Professor Lupin helped me up.”
sure Sirius was about to cry, his eyes watering and his sniffling giving him away.
Harry nodded. He wrestled with his red and gold tie, his shaky hands refusing to cooperate.
“Nice to see you haven’t changed a bit, Sirius,” Professor Lupin said.
“Harry?”
“So, what do you think?”
“Are you sure you don’t want to tag along, mate?” Ron asked for the hundredth time, his eyes full of sympathy and something to close to pity for Harry’s comfort.
The walk to school was occupied with thoughts of how badly Harry had screwed up. By the time he set food on school grounds, he had convinced himself that by the time he got home, Sirius would have all his things packed, ready to send him away. Harry continued fixating on the notion, panic clawing at his throat, making him swallow excessively.
