"Yes Pans I'm getting there," Draco attempted to placate her. "You see..." Fuck where does he go from here. Honestly, he just thought the first thing that came up in his head.
"Oh?" Draco questioned, "You've been keeping tabs on me Potter?"
Draco had no clue, but her voice filled in the aching silence. For once he thought maybe, just maybe, he could find peace despite the heaviness in his chest.
Blaise stopped and looked back at him. He was about to shove the letter into his pocket, when Pansy swiped it off.
But now...maybe he's just tired.
Blood traitors.
He took in a sharp breath.
They'll only go to the clinic if all their bones were broken or some bloody stint like that.
The bird propped its leg up which held an envelope with the Malfoy crest. Draco took it as the bird nibbled on his toast.
And with them, a few drops of blood.
Potter's gaze narrowed at this, "So you really are up to something."
At least Draco didn't look any more crazy than he already did.
"Mr. Malfoy we are not finished talking!"
"Well actually ignoring could–"
"What? What do you mean Pans?"
Potter stared at Draco in confusion.
"No! Of course not! Definitely not. You're probably the last person I would treat as a charity case to be honest," Potter laughed at the last sentence, as if it was really unthinkable.
"Draco, we just have to find out who that person is and change their opinion of you!"
Potter nodded, finally getting the message and turned the flame to a lower heat.
He sighed. "Fine, have the toast you bloody glutton." At least he still had his tea.
He was already on board with the idea of surgery. After all, if money was an issue, it would definitely not apply to him nor his family.
Draco really wished he didn't have to deal with a worrying Pansy. Angry Pansy was scary and terrifying. She could make your life a living nightmare. But worrying Pansy was just as bad, constantly fretting over you like his Mother. She would hover over you and if you snapped at her well...Anyway, at least it wasn't a mix of angry and worrying Pansy. That one was the worst.
Draco decided to make a run for it before he catches whatever they were on. He bloody hoped it wasn't contagious. Perhaps he'll be awarded for warning the staff about this outbreak. And if not, he'll be owed a favor by the trio which is obviously a benefi—
"Hmm?," the Gryffindor hummed while dutifully clenaing up their area.
And there it was again, the same unreadable expression he saw on Potter's face.
"Think about it Malfoy! Think with your fucking head. You're second in our year when it comes to brains. Did you never bother to look properly at the ranking? There isn't exactly a clearcut line between purebloods, halfbloods, and muggleborns. You don't see all purebloods taking up the top rankings and you don't see all muggleborns taking the bottom."
Draco tightened his hold on Pansy and Blaise. His body shook at the thought.
He scowled and busied himself with cleaning his station.
"Hey Potter," he spoke up.
The rest of the words blocked off Draco's head. He didn't know what he was expecting. Was he honestly expecting something else? Words of comfort? Even just a pat on the back? Was he actually expecting Snape to show some strange form of care?
It's true. He wouldn't understand half of Draco's problems. The actual weight he carried with the Malfoy name, the position in Slytherin, the necessity to hide stupid life-threatining magic disea–
Pansy gasped, going red in the face. "WELL SORRY FOR BEING A FRIEND WHO DOESN'T WANT YOU TO DIE."
He spoke, "Perhaps...blood may not actually define us."
Pansy then stood up from her seat, causing Blaise and Draco to nearly tumble out of theirs. "Wha–""Pans, what the hell!?"
Draco shook his head. "Not long, or at least I don't think so. I only noticed recently when the coughing got a tad worse and you know," he gestured, "the...blood..."
Draco wiped at his mouth and held out a wand to cast a scourgify and vanishing charm when Blaise stopped him by gripping his arms again with shaking hands.
Fuck, she was already getting suspicious.
He then gave one last look at the speccy git and his lot. "Maybe you should stop and realize that the world doesn't revolve around you or your expectations. People change Potter. Perhaps I and my friends decided that everyone else isn't worth the attention anymore, especially not you three."
you're good at potions, a bloody genius."
Draco watched the professor, through the corner of his eyes, walking towards their cauldron to peer at it.
That gave Draco pause, luckily the potion had reached its needed color. He looked over his shoulders back at Potter. His eyese were wide, honestly not believing what he'd just heard. "What?"
Ah. There's the usual glare.
"Really," Blaise added, "I didn't think that the role models of Gryffindoric righteousness would stoop so low as to ambush a couple of unsuspecting students."
"Malfoy?"
Shit. "Professor–I didn't mean–I was just–"
And eventually, it unsurprisingly led his mother to become even more worried.
"I believe we have professor. Stay out of my life. You didn't even want to be a part of it in the first place."
"We can still–"
Draco tried to pull out of Potter's grip to no avail.
Draco didn't know how long he was there for, but the sky was now taking an orange hue. He had to go back soon.
He sighed. Whatever. Didn't matter. Stupid potion or stupid spell, whatever it was was definitely temporary.
Draco peeked at the walls and ceiling, as if actually expecting to see something.
Draco mentally shook his head at the thought. He was sure that the other two knew that even without his Hanahaki, that scenario wouldn't happen...But sometimes, it was nice to dream that it was.
He hoped this wouldn't take too long.
If it wasn't for Blaise being so sure, Draco would've feared that it wasn't and that they would discover who it belonged to. He definitely could not let it get out that the Malfoy heir is... afflicted with some stupid disease for unrequited love.
"Pans no–"
He was now pacing in circles. "Potter actually did have decent points. And surely if we looked into it, we could find evidence to support his and the other bloodtraitors' stance. But for our beliefs? We never bloody had something like that! Where did we learn about it? Why are we so set on it being the absolute truth!? We've learned from our parents who just learned from their parents who just learned from their parents. No fucking evidence. Just books written about traditions by our bloody ancestors!"
"The giant squid of course! They prefer the solitude, but they still enjoy some company from time to time. Of course the gillies, snicklesnaps, and mermen are good company too. But they also like to see land dwellers like us."
They couldn't have stopped her if they tried. She had the determination of a dragon that had set its sight on a pile of gold. Not even an army could stop her.
"Draco you don't–"
"Oh! I believe this is where we will be parting ways." She stopped at the entrance pointing to the direction to the Ravenclaw tower, different from the Slytherin dungeons. "Good night Draco. It was nice discussing nightly creatures with you."
"YOU'RE JUST BEING A SELFISH CUNT WHO WON'T EVEN LISTEN TO A DYING FRIEND'S REQUEST"
Draco opened his mouth in protest–
Blaise rolled his eyes. "Pans has just learned some new gossip and is practically skipping with fairies from the news."
But right now, 3 Slytherins cried in each other's arms, babbling on how they would get through this and promising to do whatever they can so that one of them won't die.
"Blaise, it's fine. To be honest, it was a miracle I manage to befriend you two idiots. For some reason, you actually came to like someone like me."
And of course there was no one to talk about it to.
"They do, they've been laughing at you and suddenly your friends don't want to hang out with you and—"
But Francis had the smile that was usually seen at those stupid Pureblood balls he had to attend. It was plastered on the politicians and higher ups. It was something he saw on his own father's face.
He rolled his eyes and used that opportunity to excuse himself to the bathroom.
Draco's brows furrowed. Was Po–Harry, was Harry actually agreeing to this? "Fine."
"Well I don't want to waste my life doing shit that will just make feel the magnitude of how fucking impossible it all is!" Draco found himself face to face with Pansy.
He didn't even know why he was bringing it up. He could have just as easily left her right there and made his way to the Slytherin dorms.
"Look..." his voice had an edge to it. He's been thinking about this ever since he discovered that it was Hanahaki. Unrequited love to the point that he would cough out blood? Why? What exactly determined something to be unrequited for this affliction? He eventually came to a conclusion.
"Because it doesn't take a genius to realize that there isn't," he grounded as he shoved the letter in front of her face. "If even a magical research center with all its data and instruments don't see a cure, then why the hell do you think three teenagers can!?"
"So Chang isn't with Diggory?"
"No," Pansy cut in, "I just...I mean...I don't know..."
Draco noticed some of the other Slytherins stop their conversation to listen in on Pansy's new juicy bit of information.
Draco spared a glance at Potter to give him a glare. "Watch me."
The two then stared at Draco.
"Potter?"
Before Draco knew it, he bursted into the most unsophisticated giggle. Honestly the whole thing was ridiculous. Just saying each other's name had them floundering around like blast-ended skrewts. But if he was honest, he wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world.
"There's no need professor," Draco spoke coolly. "I wouldn't think a halfblood like you would understand."
He folded up the letter and put it in his pocket.
Ah. He forgot to lock the door.
And how broken they'll be when they come up with nothing.
And it was like a switch had been flipped.
"Good," Draco glared at him. "Maybe that'll convince you to stop wasting your bloody time saving this 'insufferable' friend."
He focused on his breathings and the ripples on the lake instead.
His eyes fell on the last sentence.
"Of course because I definitely want to speak more than 5 minutes with a halfblood, bloodtraitor, and mudbl—know-it-all"
Draco gave an offhand wave to a random area at the side, making it look like he was just swatting something in the air.
"Sod off Blaise," Draco snapped as he finally released himself from Pansy's grip. "Now can anyone explain why I was just ambushed with this madwoman's bloody grip?"
So why...why did magic think he needed to be afflicted with a life-threatening disease?
Draco stayed silent.
Even the Gryffindors looked at them in confusion.
"I..." Pansy spoke up in an unusually soft voice, "I still don't think it's necessarily wrong."
Draco buried his head into his hands. He did everything right. He upheld the traditions. He cherished it gifts and taunted those who didn't.
Draco looked at his two friends. He could imagine it already, how desperate they'll be everyday. How they'll hole themsleves up researching for even a sliver of an answer to help their friend.
"There is, either we'll find another cure or the person comes to love you back!" For once Blaise looked...angry.
He remembered emerald eyes for once looking at him with—with concern. Which shouldn't be possible, which he was definitely reading wrong.
A hand started to make a shoo-away motion near his head. "Too many wrackspurts...I didn't think it was possible for more to appear."
"You have to admit though, this really does sound crazy," Blaise said.
"Wha–I wasn't"
All three of them went silent.
It sounded like there were numerous students heading through the corridors.
Draco wanted to laugh. How one simple paragraph basically turned his whole world upside down and gave him his own death sentence.
Blaise gave Pansy a deadpan stare. "If none, then we'll just have to do this and
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but the root cause has some relation to your...current predicament with Ms. Parkinson and Mr. Zabini."
Even if his bag wasn't as secured on his shoulder.
Of course, a user can break it if they choose to do so, but they will be left with an irremovable magical mark on their face for a week. Nothing could be done to hide or remove it. This was due to the mark acting as a sign, a reminder of the Slytherin's failure to uphold their honor.
"Erudeus?"
"You don't know that! Just as you said, there's still the fucking object of your affections. We'll just have to find out whoever it is and–"
He looked down at the cup of tea in his hand and sighed. "Don't tell me you two actually believed otherwise, that it was something else, something less...severe. I think it was already getting quite obvious from the information we got, depleting the Hogwarts library."
But as soon as Lu–Lovegood had said her piece, she had left of in a flitter as if already knowing Draco's answer.
Harry grinned at the word spoken a second time.
He might as well be talking to a bunch of blast-ended slrewts with the way the trio just stared uselessly at him.
...He really needed to write a reply soon.
"Then... you can rest. Blaise and I can research a bit more."
Acknowledging that it was wrong, acknowledging that
Blaise went a bit red. "Ok so...er..."
And his smile was wide and confident and–Draco didn't know the right word to say it.
First Potter gets to participate in the bloody tournament, which he must add is against the rules. He should know since he wasn't allowed to enter despite Father being on the school board. Then Potter decided to damage everyone's eyesight with his abhorrent flying skills, stealing the golden egg with an inch of his life from a dragon like the bloody Gryffindor he was.
"That not what I–"
"You're hiding something Draco."
Draco closed his mouth. He didn't that that was the reason Potter hated insults about his scar. He thought Potter was just conscious of his appearance but now...
Potter himself didn't look any better. In fact he somehow managed to look even more rumpled as he moved his hands around and mouth opening and closing like a guppy fish. "I–er–I didn't–"
Not if he won't even have one.
"So am I going to be the only one left in the dark?" Draco questioned after an annoyingly long time of silence.
"Oh," Lovegood covered her mouth with a hand, "so you are aware that it's my name."
"And Mione is the brightest witch of our year! Even if she wasn't, her blood doesn't make her any less of a person."
"Well then obviously there could still be a wrong diagnosis..." Blaise added.
Groans sounded out around him, most definitely the Gryffindors, and loud cheers echoed from the Slytherins.
Draco was lying belly down with a pillow in his hands, facing Pansy and Blaise who were at the foot of his bed.
"You–er–you sort of did everything. So I might as well do this."
"No excuses Mr. Potter. 20 points from Gryffindor for your tardiness and speaking up against authority," Snape sneered.
"I know. I know that someone like me isn't exactly a person anyone would fall in love with. Because you know what? I'm the son of a death eater who believes in blood purity. I'm the heir of the Malfoy family, one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. People on the opposite side abhor me, and the people on our side fear me."
Pansy opened her mouth in protest but closed it again. "My grades aren't that bad, honestly," she muttered. But she let herself be dragged along.
She then skipped along ahead as if that was that.
Lun–Lovegood giggled into her hands. "Perhaps so, but it could also mean that you won't go through it in the end. They..." She stopped and stared at him, as if waiting for a sign that this was ok.
After a few minutes of Harry dying at the floor, he calmed down. Though a few giggles slipped here and there. And if Draco was going to engrave the memory of Harry so free and happy? Well, no one will be the wiser.
Draco continued, "You know, a spell? A potion? Charm gone wrong?"
"Yes, that's why you need to–"
A tentacle soon popped out of the lake and...gave a wave?
"Ohh I touched a nerve there didn't I?"
During the exchange, the sixth year Slytherin had slipped out of the common room.
Draco thought this would be a great opportunity to inform Granger and weasel to immediately take Potter to Madame Pomphreys, or even St. Mungo's. So he nodded.
"And I still don't hear anything that supports your claims."
Draco felt a burst of pride. It was rare for his godfather to give a compliment, well a compliment by his godfather's standards.
Then in the Great Hall, he'd wait till all the seats were occupied before he would squeeze himself next to them. They just ignored him.
Lovegood cooed and started making conversation with the damn bird while Draco opened the envelope to read the letter inside.
Draco frowned. Just his luck, it was Looney Lovegood. Perhaps if he ignored her long enough, she'd go away.
He took deep breaths trying to piece together Francis' words. Was it true? If Draco had to be honest, he hadn't been paying as much attention to the other slytherins lately. It most likely had to do with the whole Hanaki business and the incident with his friends.
"They hate me. They have to hate me to a point where my feelings for them won't even reach them. It's to the point that magic believes that I deserve this."
She closed her mouth.
"For the upcoming Yule Ball, I'm debating between this traditional satin robe and this spectacular new silk robe I found at a shop," Pansy squealed. "I honestly would've just gone with the silk robes. They actually have this nice gradient of a deep purple to a molten pink. And you should see the embroidery! But sadly, satin robes have been trending lately and I–"
"Makes sense?" Blaise drawled as he stared at Pansy again. "Do you really think it makes sense because it does? or because it was drilled into our heads?"
meant to be cherished," Pansy cut in. "Since forever, we have uphold the traditions and kept the bloodline pure! It just makes sense that we deserve it most!"
After only 1 week of this, he'd had enough. They were walking through the corridors and he could hear the click-clacks of the Gryffindors' footsteps.
"Ah, it appears Mr. Potter is without a partner for his potions."
"Oh?," a voice drawled from the side, "is the Slytherin Prince having difficulty dealing with a hug?"
Draco shook his head at this. Of course they are. It's just a little fight. And anyway, it's only been a few days.This is nothing. They've fought before.
He scoffed. "Oh really? What gave it away?"
Draco rolled his eyes and made his way back to the castle.
Since none of the Slytherins wanted to pair with him, then he'll just do the bloody potion himself. Draco felt slightly gratified that one of the Slytherins ended up at the clinic due to dragon pox, leaving the class at an odd number.
He knew this.
"But–"
Draco rolled his eyes, "well if you have any counterarguments, be my guest."
"I'm honestly shocked. Didn't think that Hufflepuff would have it in him to execute that plan," Blaise spoke in awe.
They weren't even anywhere near the library. If they weren't in class, the dorms, or the great hall, they were gone to the world. It's like they just suddenly vanished.
He didn't want to do this anymore. It was like talking to a fucking wall. Draco turned his back to them.
But Draco couldn't feel the excitement.
"Malfoy, for the last time, I'm not sick or charmed or potioned," Potter huffed. "Just, look, there's still a reason I wanted to talk to you ok?"
But before they left that bubble, the briefest of touch and the softest words were exchanged.
"Oh er...sorry," the Gryffindor then took the vial from Draco's hand and brought it towards the professor's desk. Draco felt a lingering tingle at his fingertips, where Potter's fingers brushed. Honestly, Potter really had no control of his magic.
Pansy paled at this. But soon her eyes alit with determination. "We're going to get through this Draco okay?" She placed a hand on his shoulder.
That was when Pansy stepped in. "Shut up Potter. Just leave us the fuck alone." But her voice shook at the end of her words. Draco felt that she too didn't know what to with Potter's points.
Draco shook off their grip and proceeded to walk ahead of them. Fine, they can talk on some random corner, but he was definitely not going to be dragged about like some heathen.
He coughs and coughs until finally, he can breathe.
The trio made their way towards the slytherin dorms when they were blocked by someone.
Their friend huffed as she glared at the two of them.
...Sadly, that happiness was short-lived.
"Of course not professor," Draco grumbled.
"Well I'm glad to see that you support how I'm not exactly lovable. And see?" He pointed with his index finger, "that leaves only one conclusion!"
Draco could feel the itch still there in his throat. He coughed and coughed, trying to get it out. But it wouldn't dislodge. That just made it all the more irritating.
Surprisingly though, this time there wasn't even any blood and there was only one petal. Draco looked at it in confusion.
Draco skimmed through the rest which only elaborated more on the disease and tests used to research the sample.
"Don't think I don't know you think the same," Draco seethed. "You were hiding that letter for a reason after all."
Draco continued to crunch on his flavorless toast as he peeked again at the Slytherin table. Maybe, he was just expecting even a little thumbs up or a small quirk of a smile from–well from the Slytherins of course. He wasn't searching for–
A test perhaps? Maybe the object of his affections was pureblood and together they would bring forth a powerful child meant to pave the way for the future of purebloods to rise up higher in society–no. Bloody hell, that's stupid.
The 2 looked at Potter in shock but eventually sighed.
Draco ignored it and pushed pass the trio. He needed to go somewhere, anywhere.
"Draco–"
In the classrooms, the library, the great hall, the corridors—everywhere, just everywhere he could spot the golden trio not far off.
"Well the interesting bit is that I heard from a source who had a source from Hufflepuff that Diggory also had a crush on them!"
The professors were also much more lenient in their classes as students discussed about the upcoming ball and weren't paying as much attention. Merlin, even the heads of the houses had to teach the students how to waltz, including Snape!
"Look Potter, just stay out of my way unless you want a potion exploding at our faces due to your abysmal skills," he snapped.
Draco laughed, but he didn't have the heart in it. "No, I didn't discover this from her nor did I go to the clinic."
He looked at the possible ways to cure it:
They were actually three people: one with thick bushy hair, the other with short red hair, and the last one with a bird's nest.
At that it looked like all the energy left out of Pansy.
But at some point, he just couldn't.
"What?" the Weasel finally spoke up.
"Mr. Malfoy, I believe you and your friends have classes to attend to?"
"Ha! You liar! Now c'mon, give us the truth."
"Bullshit!"
Of course Francis decided to still have the last word, "It's François! And take this as a warning Malfoy. Don't get too comfortable with where you are right now. I wasn't lying about anything I said."
But it was nice.
"I'm getting there!" Pansy snapped. "As you know, over half the school likes Diggory. I mean who wouldn't. Don't think I haven't seen you making eyes at him."
Draco raised a brow, "What makes you think that we're even up to something Potter. I doubt you even have evidence."
He watched Potter slump down as he made his way towards the Gryffindor lot.
Draco could see Pans bite her bottom lip while looking down at her own drink. Blaise was now crumpling the paper in his hands.
He joined in the hug while muttering things about how un-slytherin-like they were being.
"Pans," Draco voice was shaking, "look at me."
"Well Professor, if that is all–"
It'd been a while since he'd seen only one petal, and with no blood at that. It reminded him of the first time he got it. He remembered how he was thinking he accidentally swallowed it on that Hogsmeade trip. If only that were the actual case.
He then found himself enclosed by a monstrous grip, er embrace.
Based on Pansy's and Blaise's performance, he could tell they were affected too.
Draco frowned and just nodded.
He thought of his friends (maybe not anymore), his stupid disease, his father's scorn—His problems were but a small fucking drop?
An owl came in, extremely late compared to the others.
He tried to rewind the conversations in his head, but it all just seemed like a blur of words and anger. The last thing he remembered was saying something about how pointless it was.
"WELL GOOD, I WANT YOU TO LIVE, NOT DIE BECAUSE MAGIC IS BEING A BITCH AND SHOVED STUPID FLOWERS DOWN YOUR THROAT."
Honestly, Gryffindors.
"Oh my, the derulites will be coming any moment now. We really must head back inside." And with that she stood up in some sort of floaty motion. Draco didn't know how that was even possible.
Draco rolled over in his bed and took another peek at the door. He tossed a diagnosis spell to check if the wards they put up were still there.
was initially the abandoned crup. Of course not, that would have been absurd.
Draco flushed at this but motioned her to continue.
"Pans," Draco gently grabbed her arms. "I haven't been hiding anything from you guys. I really haven't been having much of these fits lately and..."
They protested. "But professor–!" "We didn't do anything–" "They were the ones who–"
Draco raised a brow, "So when you spot them, that still means you're going to go through something bad?"
"Er...what?"
He knew it was selfish to ask for this. It was so selfish and he shouldn't have said it in the first place. Not when it was all going to go downhill very soon. Not when after this moment, they were going to have to pretend that it never existed in the first place.
Draco turned on his heels to glare at the three people behind them.
Draco felt rage pool at the pit of his stomach like lava returning deep into the magma. "I," he gritted out, "am not a charity case for you to–"
Draco gulped, but stayed silent.
"You have quite an infestation of wrackspurts."
The Gryffindors sputtered some more but eventually went quiet. They glared at Draco and his friends.
His godfather didn't care. It was only because Draco was a Malfoy. It was only because he was Professor Snape's godson. No, he didn't care. Snape only cared about how it would affect his reputation if his own godson was failing at potions and in Slytherin in general. He won't care even if Draco has only a few years left. He didn't care. He won't ever care–
"What?" Draco stood up from his bed. "This is what we were going to talk about! It's bloody ridiculous and so fucking insane. But..."
"Pans, the only cure is either having my love requited from a person I don't even fucking know or having surgery which leaves only a small chance of survival and even then, I would lose the ability to love. Love in general. That only leaves the inevitable!"
"Draco! What's taking you so long? I need your input on my robes. Blaise said that I should–"
His words echoed throughout the room.
Draco sighed.
2 to 3 years.
Draco found an empty room and locked himself in it.
"We missed first period..."
It swooped into the Slytherin table, causing a bit of commotion among the Slytherins.
He sighed. "Fine, I swear on Slytherin's honor," he held up his wand, "that I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, will ask for help when I go into a coughing fit with numerous petals and blood."
It was one thing to have that niggling thought in the back of your mind. But it's another thing when spoken out loud. It just made it more real.
He felt a hand on his arm.
Draco scoffed.
Pansy nodded. "Yep, it turns out it was all a ruse to get their crushes to notice and stop being in denial. From what it looks like, at least Diggory will be reaping some success from this."
It was definitely not a pleasure at all. Francis was a 7th year who was a constant thorn on his side. Let's just say that if Draco had not arrived at Hogwarts, Francis would have most likely taken the spot of Slytherin Prince.
"Flowers" Fuuckk why not just mention he's come up with a rare fucking disease while he's at it.
"And so while those creatures are believed to bring bad omens," Draco registered Luna's words, "they are actually only attracted to objects that already have one."
He didn't know why he was talking to her. He wanted to be left alone. But well, it wouldn't hurt to have someone to actually talk to. Plus, no matter what he tells her, no one would actually believe Looney Lovegood if she decides to expose him someday.
Blaise shook his head with a "no".
He didn't know why but he followed that stupid instinct which led him to now, in the middle of the library holding the answer in front of him.
"You're right. It's Cedric who deserves to participate, not me. I didn't want to take part in this stupid deadly competition Malfoy," Potter spoke in an unnaturally cool manner.
Draco then proceeded to clean the area but was stopped midway by Potter.
The other two nodded so Draco continued.
"Honestly you can't be..." Draco furrowed his brows in confusion.
Before he knew it, he was already making conversation with her. He didn't know when it had started. Perhaps when he asked some questions about what she had said, in disbelief, or when she decided to inquire about simple things like his favorite food.
He looked away and coughed into his hand. It wasn't his business whatever Potter was up to.
Harry's hand tightened its hold. "I wish we lived different lives and were different people," he said in a near whisper turned silent.
And just like clockwork, Draco felt something tickle in his throat. On instinct, he was about to make his way towards the bathroom when Blaise and Pansy gripped his arms, their faces full of worry.
But all runs eventually come to a stop.
Draco scowled as he muttered the password to the walls and passed through the barrier.
Draco knew how the world was meant to work. It revolved around magic. Magic which was borrowed from the earth to create wonders out of nowhere.
He didn't know.
"Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter, I expect at least a sub-par potion from you two. If all of us are lucky then Mr. Potter won't cause the potion to explode and Mr. Malfoy won't be too busy arguing with him to fix it."
When he finally caught his breath, he began coughing, hacking out whatever was stuck in his throat and lungs to no avail.
And it was like the magic broke at the other meaning of his words. But they ignored it.
"Malfoy, you and your Slytherins are definitely up to something. You better think again before we–"
"Potter, what part of 'stay out of my way" did you not understand?" Draco bit out.
"So do you agree with it?...Do you believe that blood purity is wrong?"
No one cared. Draco felt his chest go heavier, whether with dread or flowers, he didn't know.
Draco was now alone in the corridors.
"It just takes a while Draco," Pansy added, "you always put up these walls and–"
He groaned.
Blaise smirked. "Please, it's definitely in the Ravenclaw tower."
"Did you get the results yet?" Pansy spoke to Blaise over Draco's head.
"Fine, but this stays only between us"
was wrong, made Draco's stomach churn. It suddenly felt like he was now going into everything blind, no longer knowing truth from lie.
"So you're right. The only way they would like someone like me is through an image change and even then, they wouldn't actually like me."
His wand gave a little glow then dimmed.
"Look, we can't rule out that perhaps it's something else. I mean look! You don't even know the person you apparently have unrequited love towards, to the point that magic wants you to die!"
But just for one moment, for one brief moment, Draco wished that it was. He smiled at Harry and returned the same force of tightness on the hand he held.
He then saw them, one taller than the other with dark skin and neat clothes which contrasted against the other's short stature, fair skin, and obvious modifications to the uniform (how does she get away with bedazzling sequences to the school robes?).
He could hear the door shut and watched as Severus casted a locking charm and no doubt an anti-eavesdropping charm as well.
"Enough you two!" Blaise had casted a charm that silenced them.
Tired of what, he didn't know.
"We can't be so certain. We'll just have to improve your image in general. I mean we're already questioning our blood purity beliefs. Why not go all the way? We'll show everyone that you can be–"
"I JUST WANT TO ENJOY WHAT I HAVE LEFT!"
A wish that was impossible for the Boy-Who-Lived and the Boy-Who-Had-No-Choice.
Pansy still had her eyes narrowed. "Let's see this charm."
"And by distractions, do you mean Ms. Parkinson and Mr. Zabini?"
"Fine then. Do your fucking research," Draco waved his hands in the air. "Leave your dying friend to spend the rest of his life alone."
Draco had no fucking clue where she was going with this but it was midnight, he was trekking through the school trying to not get caught by Filch, and he needed the energy to get through Mr. Binns' History of Magic.
Why did magic decide this needed to happen to him?
Confused, Draco motioned for her to continue and then she bloody beamed at him, teeth and all.  "The reason they're attracted to bad omens is because they are delicacies for them. So–"
Everyone turned to see a flustered Slytherin from 6th year. She immediately cooled her face down back into the Slytherin mask, but everyone already heard her outburst.
"Ah, if it isn't the Golden boy who has decided to grace us with his presence," Draco could already hear an extra layer of wrath on top of what Draco had caused a few days ago.
The two turned to Blaise.
-o-O-o-
Draco glared at anyone he could and kept walking in the usual dignified manner.
Draco shook his head.
"Have any of you heard of Hanahaki?"
"It's definitely better compared to others' lives."
Blaise looked from Pansy to Draco. "I think what she means is that, we're still at the top."
"I'm not blind. I've also seen how the other Slytherins have been looking at y–"
Potter looked at him for a second, again something unreadable in his eyes.
"Draco stop–"
"I already cancelled it."
It wasn't even just romantic. It included love of all kinds.
"No I didn't mean–" Draco heard a rustle of clothes. Potter was most likely grabbing his bird nest of a hair and making an even worse mess of it–"Malfoy, I'm not trying to challenge you or anything. I
Pansy silently handed him the letter.
He noticed the other two exchange glances.
Draco's grip on the stirring rod tightened. He fucking paid attention to the potion. It was just a few bloody seconds addressing Potter's stupid bloody question–
Whatever, it's a selfish and stupid wish, but he was the one who asked in the first place. And if Harry was going to agree to it? Might as fucking well. "Harry..."
"Draco fucking Lucius Malfoy, this better not be a prank or I'll–" Pansy was red in the face.
Draco was at a loss for words.
And of course, the stares just came back full force. The hairs on the nape of Draco's neck stood on end as he felt the boring stares from everyone.
we can ignore it for the rest of our lives."
"Swear it," her tone left no room for a compromise.
"We won't let you."
"..."
"Maybe, just maybe, you Gryffindor lot should leave us the fuck alone. We're finally not doing shit to anyone and there's a saying, 'don't thank a fairy for its gift'. In other words Potter, if your little tiny peanut of a brain didn't understand, don't shove your noses into other people's business once everything starts to look up."
"What is your evidence Potter?"
Draco ignored whoever she was. She sounded familiar though.
Potter looked back at him. "Yeah?"
"I just–I don't know. You were alone and–"
"Well then are you saying that magic isn't meant to be cherished either? That it's something so simple, that it could be shared with just anyone, even those of filthy blood?" Pansy forged on.
Draco could already imagine what Pansy was seeing before her, him standing by a sink holding a blue petal.
His godfather pinched the bridge of his nose, "I will not be repeating myself. Your performance has been falling and you have not replied to any of your mother's letters."
"Harry, bloody hell mate. Really?"
It was silent.
Even just thinking of it sounded ridiculous.
"Just this once," Draco said with a smile but it sounded like a plea. "Just this once, let's believe that wish was real."
"I hid it," Blaise narrowed his eyes at Draco, "because I knew you were going to be a git about it and whine about how your life really is going to end."
"Just leave me alone Potter, " he whispered.
"He..he has a point Dray. Maybe it isn't..."
The sky was already getting dark and stars were popping up in the sky.
Draco was really on the verge of smacking the idiotic Gryffindor with the stirring rod. But no, like a good potions student, he was still stirring the damn thing. "The–the thing... It's bloody obvious. Once, I could excuse, but twice is already too strange."
-o-O-o-
He doesn't continue the thought.
And the stares. The fucking stares. Draco could've perfected that transfiguration spell soon if not for the fact that the golden trio were practically boring their eyes through his skull.
Draco was glad he still had some leeway as he saw Francis turn red in the face and leave.
"We've only been researching for a few weeks. Why are you so adamant that there's only one way!"
"But you'll also have to call me by–"
His two friends were now looking at him with worry and confusion, but he forged on.
The owl turned to him and gave a squawk.  It then flew towards his outstretched arm. Its amber eyes stared at him with most likely confusion as if to say 'why for bloody's sake are you sitting at an entirely different table? Do you know how long I was searching for you?'.
He looked at Pansy as she nodded in approval.
Before, he would have easily been smug about the achievement and gloated at the golden trio, practically rubbing it in their faces. Made some remarks, made them rise to the bait, especially Potter.
Potter looked like a toddler who finally fitted the pieces of a 4-piece puzzle.
"Draco."
They quietly shoved passed him through the doors, leaving him behind.
He watched her disappearing figure as he casted a disillusionment charm on himself and made his way to the dungeons.
Draco raised his hands in frustration. "Argh! You two should just get it in your head that I'm actually going to die!"
–and look! There was definitely not a single bloody thing wrong with the potion. It's in the right bloody color, the right bloody consistency–
Draco stopped in his tracks, sputtering. "Wha–Lovegood, what on earth–"
"Vilmont..." Draco thought aloud, "Do you mean Edmund Vilmont?"
Both Blaise and Pans stared at him with wide eyes abd open mouths.
She furrowed her brows in confusion and opened her mouth in protest.
"Maybe because they're not Slytherins or they didn't have the right resources! I don't know Draco. I just don't want my friend to fucking die!"
Draco had to admit, he might have crumbled if not for Blaise's interruption.
Draco waited as class ended and he fixed on his satchel.
The three Slytherins were in their dorms after finishing classes. After the incident with Snape, the Gryffindors finally left them alone. But that just left them with another problem.
Draco peeked at his friends. He had to admit...Potter did have a point. Blaise was somewhere in the top 15 but Pans was just around average...and of course there wasn't even a need to mention Crabbe and Goyle. And he himself had been beaten by a mudblood...
"Mr. Malfoy."
"You've never–"
"Oh for the love of–Luna!"
He sighed. "I don't even know where to fucking begin."
His hand wavered on the place on his arm where Potter gripped. It still jad tinge of warmth.
Pansy's eyes widened. "Just you saying that is already making me freak out! What the fuck Draco."
"I understand that you are going through your own personal 'teenage drama' but do not let it get to your head and interfere with your life. You can't let it affect your grades and your position in Slytherin. You are my godson and you are already upholding the Malfoy name......"
Draco merely rolled his eyes. "No Potter, we aren't up to anything. We just came back from our studying session in the library and are–were–heading our way back to the dorms for a good game of snap. Well, until you lot decided to show up."
As he panted and tried to get his breathing back to normal, Draco took in his surroundings.
He did not have the energy to deal with this. "Just bloody explain where you're trying to go with this."
When he was done, he curled into himself, hugging his knees.
"Yes of course, Francis. What do you want?" Draco kept on a calm demeanor and had one brow raised.
Draco gritted his teeth. A feeling of dread pulled at the pit of his stomach, Francis' words echoed in his head
He frowned and kept on walking.
Potter was at a loss for words, undoubtedly trying to think up a proper excuse.
And now...this!?
"Alright so what the bloody hell is Potter on?" Draco crossed his arms and faced the trio the minute they were alone.
"Of course!" She beamed at him.
But now that he had the power? He honestly didn't want to do it...
"Er..." then Potter raised his hand, "yeah?"
"Look I still don't understa–"
Harry returned the gaze, but his hold of the other's hand still held tight. "I just want us to be Harry and Draco." It was spoken like a wish, that couldn't be made.
Blaise and Pansy turned to him with eyes slightly widened.
Pansy and Blaise nodded at this.
Draco scoffed and put up the usual glare. "Well Smith," he sneered, "I don't exactly remember there being a rule against sitting at another house's table. Might I add that it is also very interesting to see that you are quite passionate about keeping to the
Draco gave a wolfish grin. "How much do you bet he's already snogging Vilmont in the Hufflepuff entrance."
Draco groaned. He'll go bald if they kept going at this rate.
And there it was, the reaction he always  anticipated from Potter. The magic in the air, the fire in his eyes. But it easn't as exciting. No, Potter just seemed tired.
"You two need to calm down. We're Slytherins, not roaring lions. Or did you forget?"
"Excuse me," a pitchy voice spoke from above their heads.
"Well looks like the Slytherin prince has lost his throne," a voice called out in the corridors.
"Buffoon. Never heard you use that before."
He picked himself up and dusted off any dirt on his robes.
The stares had gotten 10 times worse. People were whispering and pointing at him in a very bloody obvious manner.
Lovegood gave a hearty wave back while Draco watched the exchange in growing confusion.
"Look at me Pans. If whoever I liked doesn't like me back, there's a large chance they never will."
Because he's not—they're not—
"I–first?"
He then looked over back at the weasel and Granger. Luckily they were peeking over as well. They seemed worried as their gazes followed Potter then back at him.
Blaise casted a muffliato charm and locked the door. Meanwhile Pansy casted some anti-eavesdropping charms.
College is hard, tests suck, and I am dying in groupworks.
They've most likely concocted an abysmal potion that would burn the bottom of their bloody cauldron (It wouldn't be the first time).
Draco glared at him as he rolled his eyes.
It went exactly as Draco had predicted, no, it was worse.
Whether that was actually the truth or a comforting lie, Draco didn't want to acknowlege it.
"Flowers?" Pansy had an eyebrow raised.
"We still have the books from our manors," Pansy supplied.
Everyone was excited for the upcoming Yule Ball.
Draco was already at the door. He just needed to use his wand and remove the–
First it was in the Great Hall, with them staring and whispering. Draco and his friends tried to ignore them but the food just tasted bland in their mouths. And it just continued on from there.
"Draco," he smiled at the name like a kid who was allowed to have a sleepover with his friends. He spoke it as if he had opened the first present under the Christmas tree. As if he had just casted his first spell.
She hummed again as they continued their walk.
"Hanahaki..." he spoke the words aloud. Draco was glad that there wasn't anyone in the library at the moment.
Draco saw red.
And for once Draco may have felt a tiny tiny bit guilty for that one.
Should he tell the weasel and mudblood (er, muggleborn) about it? Perhaps he needed to inform the professor—no, even he knew that Professor Snape is the last person to ask for aid when it came to Potter (Draco still didn't know where that burgeoning hate came from. He himself had his reason, but why did Snape have it out for Potter compared to the other Gryffindors?).
"We," he took in a sharp breath, "we've been taught all our lives how...we're at the top. We're the ones who are superior. We're the ones of supreme bloodline who deserve magic's gift."
," he let the last two words slowly roll off his tongue.
Some shut up and looked away while others still gave a mocking sneer.
She kept humming.
"Oh? Guess we're going for another group hug?" Blaise called out from the bathroom's doorstep.
Draco was about to ask what the bloody hell Therusians were and how exactly was he supposed to greet them.
Draco grumbled as the small girl gave him a wave and flittered off.
Once in there, Draco casted a muffliato, and tried to cough out the bloody petals. For some reason, he hadn't gotten much hectic fits since the moment with Pansy and Blaise. It was far and few in between. He hoped it stayed that way.
Draco didn't want to think–he didn't think that they would...what? Abandon him? Just like that?
Maybe everything.
He felt exhilarated at the thought that he actually got the last word and left Potter and his minions a sputtering mess. And for once, he didn't even have to do anything! Just slap cool logic right back at Potter's face.
Draco waited for the usual comeback, the raise in his voice, the furrow in his brows, the way he would tower over him and look ready to punch.
"So do you want to explain your little excursions to the library this past week?" Blaise spoke up.
Blaise, meanwhile, really did get the sample (the blue petals and blood) sent to be analyzed at a magical research center. He had immediately used one of his contacts (undoubtedly related to one of his dead dads) and made sure it was anonymous.
"Don't bloody change the subject! And that still doesn't explain the breaks to the bathroom!" Pansy was fuming.
Draco shook his head, keeping the thoughts at bay. Right now he needed to focus on his potions.
"And I'm not talking about what happened a while ago at the table, though that did cement it. I'm talking about how you haven't been
"Can you...raise your hand?"
Draco heard the Slytherins snicker and cackle. They really weren't hiding it anymore.
"Nope," Draco took hold of his two best friends by their arms. "If I'm going to rest, then you're going to rest too. And honestly Pans if your grades drop too low, you'll be assigned more homework and that will just make it so we have less time to spend on the research."
Draco looked down at his hands, blue petals and red liquid mixed together.
"Harry," the words felt like gold spun upon the tip of his tongue, something divine yet forbidden. Harry looked back in shock.
Draco didn't have anything to say, at least nothing that wouldn't let on his issue with his disease which was the bloody source of all his problems.
He'd been trying to talk to his friends. Or were they still friends? Draco hoped they were. But as time passed, that hope seemed to fade.
Draco didn't–he couldn't live like that.
They flinched and Draco turned back to the table, preparing for the next step. Potter followed him, but just awkwardly stood to the side.
"Would it honestly kill you to not put your nose into other people's business?" Draco whined.
But that didn't lessen the whispers and stares all around. In fact, it probably made it worse.
Draco realized what exactly he had just said to his godfather.
"And that's juicy gossip because..."
"Go on then," Draco rolled his eyes, "rub it in why don't you."
"Hello there," a soft voice echoed from behind.
Blaise rolled his eyes. "We get it Pans. Not exactly a nice thing to face."
And that even with its success, the victim would be left without ever feeling the emotion of love again.
He noticed the idiot at a loss for words. "You...you've been acting strange. You've been keeping to yourselves, no longer insulting any of us. And you've been spending your days in the library, even more than you usually do."
Only for a few blissful seconds.
"You don't even know half of it!" Was this it? Had his own godfather not been able to see, to understand him from the very fucking start?
They soon left the room and were about to go off into opposite directions down the corridors.
Potter shrugged with that stupid sheepish grin on his face.
Strangely, Harry was really silent next to him. He checked to see why until he saw the most idiotic grin on the gryffindor's face. "Po–Harry, I don't know if you realized but you look like a downright idiot."
He sounded stupid saying it.
Draco rolled his eyes, "Anyway, that's all the reason I had to stay and bloody chat with you lot. Take Potter to the hospital wing and whatnot. Ah, and think of that as owing me a favor." With that, he turned to leave.
Draco and Pansy kept their mouth shuts. They then peered at Blaise like ducklings looking towards their mother duck.
He heard a hum then the echoing of footsteps.
"Mr. Malfoy, stay behind. I need to discuss with you about the essay you had passed."
Draco watched as Severus settled behind his desk and look Draco in the eye. "Do I need to ask you or will you save us both the time and inform me of what is actually going on?"
He chanted this in his head as he watched the slow ripples upon the lake's surface.
Draco wrote this off as typical Lovegood and listened on, providing input from time to time.
Draco looked around. That meant other students were also having classes. Luckily, no one with a free period were outside at the moment. Draco sighed in relief.
"Bloody hell—Potter!? Let go of me before you actually pass on whatever contagious ailment you have going on."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I have no idea what you're talking about professor. If this is about my performance in class, I assure you that there will definitely be improvements now that there are less...distractions."
They continued to talk. Harry's head leaned on Draco's shoulder while Draco complained about the discrepancies between some of the potion books in the library.
"It's François you little–"
Because while Slytherins may be cunning, they will keep to their word to the very end. It is in their pride to follow through with what they've promised. A Slytherin who does otherwise is merely a disappointment of their house, especially if they don't even have a decent excuse for it.
"But doesn't each require a different wand motion?" Blaise pondered.
Draco watched as Potter continued to clean the area.
He couldn't hold it in anymore and coughed it out. Draco felt the two let go of him as he kept coughing. He went into a bit of a fit until a few petals dislodged from his throat.
"It really is...Hanahaki..."
But as time passed, the tipping point turned into an entire glacier flipping a 180 in the ocean.
Draco felt the usual heaviness in his chest. He'd started getting used to it but he discovered that gradually, ut was getting heavier and heavier.
Draco couldn't have stopped it if he wanted to. He smiled.
Blaise tried tor pry the two from each other. But they were having none of it, hurling words over his head.
"Potter," even spitting the name out lit a fire within Draco, "it appears that you still don't even have the words to give a legitimate excuse as to why you and your sidekicks are in the dungeons."
He waited. And waited.
Slytherins don't cry, not usually, not like this. They don't let their walls down and allow themselves to be vulnerable to others around them. They stay cold. They keep up the walls so no one would know that they've been broken.
In the dorms, he tried to meet up with Blaise, but Blaise would quickly enter his bed and close the curtains. Most likely, he'd already put up the wards. Draco'd even tried to catch him in the mornings but Blaise had miraculously already taken his shower and left.
Draco smirked as Smith paled. Let's just say that Smith was not quite the model student he presented himself to be.
"Mr. Malfoy! You have been zoning out too much which has increased the necessity for us to discuss this–"
All Draco could do was nod. The trio then wrapped each other in one big hug while Pansy and Blaise muttered assurances. They were going to get through this. They'll live until they're fucking 150 years old and die peacefully in their sleep surrounded by loved ones.
Draco knew he would regret it. But he said it anyway. "Thank you Harry. I love you," it was a whisper but it might as well have been a shout in the quiet halls. Their backs were already turned to each other as they were heading their separate ways. But Draco knew Harry heard it from the hitch in his breath and the stop of his footsteps. But before he could hear a reply, Draco ran.
No. Francis had to be lying.
Draco noticed Potter move next to him, looking over his shoulder at the potion. His throat felt an itch.
He thought last year was a wreck what with a serial killer entering Hogwarts and him nearly getting killed by that bloody Hippogriff.
Granger broke the silence with a guffaw of laughter. She was then followed by the Weasel while Potter just kept staring at him.
Draco could see Granger beaming at Potter.
Draco and Luna looked up to see Zacharias Smith giving them a narrow glare.
"You're so fucking insufferable," Blaise remarked.
Then there was the faint sounds of footsteps across the doors.
Draco flushed as he began to mutter, "It wasn't that funny. Honestly Potter, your sense of humor is atrocious."
For how long does he need to care?
He glanced at the Slytherin table and noticed their snickers and mocking sneers toward him.
"Yes!" Pans had a glint in her eyes that made Draco feel sorry for the poor soul that Pansy had her gossip on. "Did you know Vilmont from Ravenclaw likes Diggory?"
Draco stiffened but forced himself to act nonchalant.
"I'm not an idiot," Draco spared a glare at him then turned back to the potion. Just a few more turns and the bloody potion will be done.
Draco flinched having let his guard down from the new gossip Pansy shared. He forced his shoulder to relax. "Obviously it's for homework," he rolled his eyes.
"But I can't–you can't honestly be doing it by yourself."
"So...that happened."
"I don't want to die," he whispered.
Draco then took a step forward towards Potter. "What? Want to remind us of your superiority as the Golden Boy who got to take part in the Triwizard Tournament? Come to brag about your pitiful excuse of a participation when we already have our own champion who got his right to participate fair and square?"
"Mr. Malfoy, I believe there are matters that are in much more need of priority."
She also stopped and peered at Draco, as if trying to find something (Draco didn't know what that was). Perhaps she found it since she suddenly smiled and spoke, "Well Draco, we're friends and friends don't call each other by their last names."
And there is only so much comfort one could get reading books in a room dim with its only source of light being candles rather than the usual daylight in the library.
"...then what?"
"Stop it Draco! Just stop! You can't be giving up. We're slytherins for Merlin's sake. Where's your self-preservation? Your ambition? Don't you want to fucking live!"
Huh, perhaps they did know of Potter's predicament.
He knew the bird was told to wait for a reply and was glad that it would disobey its orders for him.
But it never came.
"...alright then?"
The other two still didn't say anything. He turned around wondering why, when he saw their mouths set in a hard line.
"They started the fight Professor," Draco heard Blaise pipe up when no one did. He was pointing at the Gryffindor trio.
"I wish it didn't have to come to this," Harry spoke as he held the other's hand. "I wish it was different. I wish we didn't have to do the things that were forced on us. I wish..."
Pansy looked him the eyes like she wa searching for something. After a while, she narrowed her gaze. "Swear it on Slytherin's honor."
He desperately hoped the 3rd one, falling out of love, would work.
"But see, no one's scared of you anymore. Maybe you haven't realized, but you're no longer at the top."
"I DON'T WANT YOU TO ONLY HAVE SO LITTLE LEFT!"
Anyway, this year was definitely the worst, even compared to the last. Draco hoped that it would stay that way. He really didn't want an even worse year than this. Then again, there is the eventual year he would...No he'll fall out of love for sure. Surely, this disease will disappear any moment now.
Harry in turn talked about the DA and about homework in general as Draco stroked his hair. Draco's hands played with the curls, which were even more soft than he ever imagined.
Draco gave a shaky smile. "Then they would only love the image we faked. It wouldn't actually be me and this magic disease will still continue."
Draco scoffed. "Patience? You know what fine! I won't test your patience. I'll be taking my leave so you don't need to deal with me or my stupid small  problems!"
That proved to shut the Gryffindor's mouth up.
Finally satisfied, he went right into the the classroom.
-o-O-o-
"You'll see. I'll give it a bloody week. You'll see my point and you'll come running back telling me how I was right. You'll see that there's nothing else you can do about this," he spoke.
Draco looked up to see the blonde girl still standing from where she sat. She was smiling at the lake despite the lack of tentacles in the air.
Draco sighed. He didn't know what he was expecting. Maybe a glance from them? A snicker or two at the Gryffindors' expense?
Draco found himself standing by a lake, overlooking the rippling water, no doubt by the giant squid.
"Enough Pans!" Draco was tired. He was tired of his friends doing this. "Just drop it. You don't need to do anything. It won't even help."
The silence in the room was deafening.
His words echoed throughout the room.
"Harry, I hate to admit it but Malfoy has a point. What you did was...strange."
He put on the indifferent mask, kept his chest out and head up. Draco knew he couldn't show weakness. He was a Malfoy. Malfoys don't slouch. Malfoys don't get hurt. And Malfoys don't get affected by the concept of friendship.
Draco groaned again. "Yes Blaise you too."
"Pans, I swear I'll ask for help if it gets worse again. Ok?"
Draco looked up to see Pansy and Blaise.
Draco had no idea what to do with this. Perhaps in their first and second years he would take undoubted joy to have this, a moment when he could order Potter around.
"...promise you won't freak out."
Draco was going to be sick.
He casted a tempus and found that it was exactly  midnight. Draco somehow knew that these would be but one of the many cases that couldn't be explained when it came to Lovegood.
They will eventually get their comeuppance. And only then will they see the truth.
Draco nodded with the other two.
Pansy and Blaise relaxed a bit at this. Draco knew he was definitely going to be screamed and shoved to Madame Pomfrey's once he told his two best friends the news though.
Everyday, Pans would question Blaise about the results. And everyday Draco could see the tension building up on his best friends' shoulders.
And Francis looked so fucking smug.
He stared at her in shock.
"As your godfather, it's my duty to ask you to inform me of–"
He felt another slight itch in his throat. "I can feel it."
Lovegood just continued to stare there for an uncomfortable amount of time until Draco had enough and coughed into his hand. "Lovegood, I thought we were going back inside?"
"Yes, but does it really mean it's false? Magic
"Alright I just," Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, "look I just found out today so bear with me if I also need time to gather my thoughts."
"Well, Mr. Malfoy? I would like to believe that you are not foolish enough to think that I was actually talking about your essay."
Severus walked towards Draco and Draco flinched. He stopped. "Draco."
Blaise had finally gotten the results from the analysis.
Then there was even quidditch. Draco was also doing quite well there. Pansy was good if she had the motivation. And Blaise...well Blaise was abysmal.
Then he kept coughing out more. Perhaps a jinx.
"My name's not Prat, it's Draco or did you forget?"
Draco gritted out, "Yes, Potter? Anything else you can do besides getting us into trouble with the Professor and further ruining the potion?"
"Well Malfoy, maybe you should've thought about that sooner, before you tormented everyone with your bigoted blood purist beliefs," he seethed. "You and your slytherins always throw your words and hexes at us, pointing out non-existent flaws and insulting the people we love."
But then a hand gripped his arm.
As it turns out, the Golden trio took that as a provocation to keep a close eye on them.
"Look, I don't know why you decided to play make-believe aurors and stalk us at every corner. But me and my friends aren't doing anything. No, we're not planning to take over the school or Wizarding Britain. No, we don't have some diabolical scheme that would harm or put people's live at risk. And no, I'm not going to give you information on why we're doing this. Because you know what? It's none of your fucking business." Draco realized that he was seething and rising up to meet Potter in the eyes.
"And how many 'exceptions' do we need to make?" Blaise spoke with one eyebrow raised. Leave it to him to stab through the weak arguments.
"I don't–"
Draco was thinking of pointing out how this time there wasn't even any blood! But...he didn't want to bring her hopes up, not when he didn't even know why it became like this. Is it random? Does it have intervals where it goes on one extreme then to the other? Or was there an actual reason it became this way?
"Well," Draco added while lowering his wand as if it wasn't there in the first place, "even if I ever do no longer hold the Slytherin throne, I hope you don't expect that someone with less athletic ability and inferior lineage to mine can overtake that position?"
Ah. He still had classes.
At that, Potter finally let go of him. And his throat felt clogged.
Everyone turned to see Professor Snape with his usual scowl.
Draco shook his head and prompted Merlin to leave. It stared at him, huffed, and then left.
Pansy shut her mouth. Blaise was also avoiding his gaze.
After all, he didn't even know who he was bloody in love with.
Pansy and Blaise shared a look. "Please tell me it's not something you discovered from Madame Pomfrey," the worry in Pansy's eyes were no longer concealed.
"I..." he looked down at his hands.
Draco gulped but kept his face impassive. "I've just been researching a new topic on charms. Did you know that charms can actually be layered if they have the right compatibility?"
Excitement was buzzing in the air.  Everyone was talking about their dates and their suits and dresses and robes. Draco could hear the annoying squeals and loud chatter coming from all corners. There were even a few public proposals (annoying bloody confetti...).
Draco didn't know why, but it felt both unsettling and comforting hearing her dreamy-like voice. He stayed silent.
Since they were being that way, then Draco thought he might as well enjoy this.
If not for the need to be quiet, Draco would have screamed.
"Alright, straight up Potter. What the fuck is going on?"
He made his way towards the dungeon and hoped to Merlin his day wouldn't get any worse.
"Yes...I do know your name is Luna Lovegood..." he spoke slowly, wondering why she was beginning another conversation with that.
And it definitely didn't warrant the beast's execution...
Plus, there was definitely less chances of fucking up the potion because of a useless partner.
"Er...anything else I can do?"
How much time did he have to spend studying to stay at the top? How many times did he have to deal with stupid balls and people who spoke with hidden intentions, trying to find his weakness? How many choices did he have to make for his family, for their reputation.
Harry snorted. "Prat."
It was Potions. Draco was glad that at least something was turning out right in this fucked up life. One of the Slytherins had ended up in tbe Hospital Wing due to a small case of dragobpox which had left their class with an odd number. This left Draco to be happily aline when everyone paired off. He didn't want to think what would've happened if he had to work with a Slytherin if...what Francis said was true...
