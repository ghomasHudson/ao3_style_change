- "Malfoy you bastard! Obliterate myself from the inside. Ooohohhhh" - He was not given to finish because Malfoy sped up his movements and Harry lacked the ability to speak. Scarhead shivered with delight as he heard the series of curses and groans behind him.
- "Stick out!" -Scarhead wanted to groan at how dominant Malfoy had said the words. The boy could not give up his desires. He didn't want to miss the opportunity to have a foreign body nine inches into him.
- "So what, Potty bath time?" - Draco wanted was going to ask him if Harry wanted to be his boyfriend after washing themselves. Judging by the face of Potter, he will agree, because who would not want a huge-dicked, handsome, tall blonde Slytherin from a respected family. Potter nodded and tried to get up from his knees. Grey-eyed laughed silently as he saw Potter having difficulty getting up and getting into the tub.
The nest-haired boy decided to take matters into his own hands and struck up to undress. The undressed brunet quietly laid the clothes on the floor and from the other end slowly and silently entered the bathtub. Pleasant grunts reached his ears. The wrapped in cloak swam between Malfoy's legs and carefully approached his crotch. Malfoy felt his breath warm for a moment against his thigh and held his breath.
- '' More ... ahh '' - and got more. He could see the tears trickling down from the green-eyed brunet's face. Even then, he didn't want to come out of him with strong thrusts. Griffindor's back arched, and a loud scream came from his mouth. He took him hard and brutally.
- "Aren't you tired?" - Malfoy raised his eyebrows and laughed
- "It's not me Severus !! Potter parades with his bare body in front of the whole school and no one notices it! I am not hallucinating....." - he took a deep breath and looked at his godfather hopefully - "You saw him too, right? - Snape shook his head and smiled, which was not normal. The blonde felt as if the Potions Master had treated him like a child.
The Pure-blood's member rubbed Scarhead's prostate with each subsequent move. In the classrom, you could hear bodies hitting each other, moans, and sometimes even screams of pleasure. The huge-cocked grip on his buttocks was making Golden Boy shiver.
- "And you chosen one, Get your shit together and calm down!" - Draco growled with authority.
The boys did a lot of quick numbers, switching positions, but Harry was always the one at the bottom.
*Another Slap*
- "Ride me, Potter!" - Potter did not comprehend how you can still have strength after such an exhausting activity. The bouncing tip against his entry did not help.
The feeling of fullness was wonderful. Harry felt like he was going to explode at any moment. His own cock was hard and throbbing painfully. Nest-haired realized that Draco loves him pleading with him. He didn't know where the need for it came from, but at all costs he wanted to show Malfoy what pleasure he was getting. He wanted to moan with all his might.
- '' Faster, Hardeerrr, pleaseee .aaaahhh.....'' -
- ''Haven't you seen enough yet? ''- A malicious smile appeared on his face and he directed the boy's face slightly upwards so that he could look into his beautiful, green eyes. He dreamed so much that he would look down at those eyes as he knelt down before him. He tugged Griffindor by the hair, but Potter broke free for a moment. To fight the inexperience, he straightened up and stroked the blue head with his thumb. He did not feel the passing time and did not know how much he was kneeling and caressing the blonde's body. He sighed as the scent of green apple and expensive perfume hit his nostrils. He decided to taste it immediately and remember it. With his other hand, he gripped the hanging balls at the base of the shaft. His eyes were still focused on the head.
Each hit produced beautiful moans that he could give anything for Draco. He struck fast, hard and decisively. He wanted to drive Potter crazy. He had been dreaming about it for three years. He wanted to bring him to the brink of fulfillment. To the very center of this pleasure.
- "What?"- Zabini's snickering made Draco want to punch him well.
- "I am all yours, pleaseee.." - The last time Prince of Slytherin used his belt, it hit Griffindor's flushed back as hard as possible.
After some time, incomprehensible words escaped from the mouth of the huge-cocked boy as Harry stepped closer to understand their meaning. The Slytherin spoke the name, or rather the surname.
Potter tensed. He did not expect such a move from the enemy. But what happened next exceeded his expectations. The blonde took his hands in his and began to cut this crap into equal 2-centimeter strips.
AND he's not just any boy. It was HARRY POTTER!
Harry didn't know how to react. Meanwhile, Malfoy took up raising his hand and ran it over the green-eyed's chest. He placed his hands on his shoulders and lunged at Potter's mouth with animal passion.
- ''Let me help you. I will be happy to help you with the problem''.-
-"Mr. Malfoy, Thank you for presenting your sound effects and I would ask you to go to the hospital wing to see if your limbs are fully functional " - Pure-blood huffed and stood up saying:
- ''Don't play a fool. I know what you were doing. Draaco'' - The visually impaired boy specially stretched the syllables in the name of blonde's to sound very seductive. At the end, Potter showed a grin.
Even better. Potter was in his trap.
-"Don't make me do it for you, Pottah!" Harry wanted to nod, but the large volume in his mouth made it impossible for him. His jaw ache was taking its toll, but he didn't care. He wanted to please the man he was kneeling behind. He squeezed his eyes shut tightly and his tongue ran over and around the tip. More salty taste and cold spread over his mouth. He felt slender fingers stroke his head.
- "Pull out what you've been staring at" - Scarhead, never taking his eyes off Draco, slipped his pants off him, and the two fifteen-year-olds showed a nine-inch penis trying to tear the fabric of the red boxers open. The green-eyed Griffindor reached down slowly and slid the fabric of the underpants that now hung loosely around his calves.
- "You don't see it either? BUT HE IS COMPLETELY UNCOVERED? SHOWS HIS BLOODY BRILLIANT CHEEKS ALL THE SCHOOL!" - Draco couldn't stand it.
- " Just do it!" - Draco's low self-control went fuck. White underpants reached his ankles. At that point world could spot the 9-inch pale monstrosity with flowing veins like a river bouncing up and down and as hard as a rock with leaking pre-cum on top. As Harry spotted an enormous boner, got goosebumps at once. Draco instantly spread his legs as far as possible. Potter imagined he would get what he'd wanted so badly for the past few minutes. He was not much wrong. The pale hand gripped a huge prick and directed straight against Griffindor's tight entrance.
- "Good morning, Draco. Severus informed me of your delusions and inventions. I would like to go with you ..." - He was not allowed to finish, because the son took his hand like Severus's one and dragged him to the fireplace. On the way he said:
Scarhead thought.
Suddenly, the nest-haired teen experienced severe pain in the area of his back. He felt as if he was undergoing the Crucio series. It caused terrible suffering and made it impossible to think straight. He did not control the work of his legs, which made him limp in an unknown direction.
- ''Why the fuck did you stop? ''-he shouted excitedly to the limit. Potter moved even closer and parted his lips again and wrapped his lips around the blue head of the cold prick he sucked. Malfoy didn't think Potter's lips were so wonderful. He did not know that these lips gave such pleasure. He looked into those beautiful eyes and stroked green-eyed's cheek with his hand. Scarhead made circular movements of his tongue around the tip and the throbbing vein under the shaft. It made Malfoy groan uncontrollably and shudder with mounting excitement. Draco wanted to muffle the sounds because he knew the boy would suck harder then.
As he headed for another room, he realized that he would never get rid of this sight.
- "Potter, how tight you are! Aahhh! I'm packing to the balls! Ahhh! "  - Potter thought he had another hole in the underside of his spine.
A hooded figure pushed him against the wall! What if it's a Death Eater? A familiar voice broke him out of his trance:
- ''I wonder what Dumbledore will say that his favorite and innocent the Chosen One is watching the Slytherins and offering them himself?''- The blond's pinching or not great arrogance caused spasms of chills down Harry's spine.
- ''I will not do it''
- ''Who's there ?'' - Grey-eyed exclaimed. Then Potter decided to make his presence known. And thus from the cloak through the blond one none other than the golden boy appeared. Malfoy froze.
He tilted his head back to see Draco bared his teeth like a predator to prey, gray irises completely obscured by pupils and arousal.
He smiled to himself that his dream was about to come true. The shorter boy obeyed and knelt in front of the huge-cocked boy, which pleased the blonde very much. The pure-blood braided his slender fingers into his black hair, where he clenched his fist.
The body of the taller trembled with pleasure, and Griffindor felt a salty taste on his tongue. He closed his eyes and purred softly, trying to swallow everything. He sucked the penis in his mouth, and as he felt it soften, he let it out of his lips. He looked up and ran his tongue over his swollen lips. Malfoy stared at him with fire in his eyes and stroked his cheek tenderly.
The nest-haired boy had to rest and pulled the drill out of his mouth.
Draco moved his hips, and tears welled up in Harry's eyes. The blows were strong, fast and very deep. Harry couldn't catch his breath. He was choking and didn't want it to end. The groans that escaped the Prince of Slytherin's mouth were melody to his ears.
- " Please, what? " - A sly smirk appeared on the aristocratic face. Pure-blood took his monster in his hand and directed it towards the narrow entrance and rubbed against the walls between haunches.
The teacher decided to prevent further such activities and suggested:
- "Harder?" - teased fled from his mouth
Aristocrat felt he couldn't take it. Not to think what he was doing pulled the teacher's hand and yanked and pulled out of his study.
- "No. It seems I avoided death again" - Harry chuckled and felt asleep on his back on the desk. Malfoy was sensing the scent of sperm and sweat. He always craved that smell to reach his nostrils and of course Harry lying beneath him. Draco made up his mind not to clean them up. He wished to make a mental note of that essence, connoting and evoking passion. Blond  pressed the side of the boy to him and placed his head on his chest. Malfoy nuzzled nose in his black mop and kissed her forehead briefly before turning in.
Well at Hogwarts there was a cool and rainy evening. Green-eyed size queen was about to come back to the Griffindor Tower after detention with Snape. Walking down the corridors he spotted a mop of blonde hair shuffling his feet forward. Tall blonde was heading towards the Prefects' Bathroom to take a calm bath after tiring day. After following and coming closer to the guy, Harry realized who was being tracked and felt thrill all over his spine when he noticed where Slytherin Prince stopped. Draco Malfoy waited a second and the huge door opened, letting him in.
- ''Like that? ...ohh''
Now it's James Potter who has competition in the grave and rolls around.
Well, Everybody makes mistakes.
Visually impaired boy shifted his hand from the balls to the hard and thick shaft, then steered it straight into his greedy mouth. The first thing he hit was salty taste and coolness. He was right.
It was too much for an excited aristocrat. His crush, which he has been dreaming about for the last three years, wants to suck him off. He couldn't miss it. Draco bit his lip when he saw Griffindor's ass. He couldn't take his eyes off his firm cheeks.
- "Shit. Shiit" - Malfoy moaned, feeling the slippery interior tightening. Potter subsequently spun his hips to insert more of Draco. Griffindor filling him deeply, began to jolt on thick and long prick. Draco's forehead glistened with sweat, and there were the same blushes on his cheeks as the color of the Griffindor emblem.
"YeS?"
Harry just had a sad smile and asked him if he was ok because he heard what sounded like glass shattering.
"He's probably swallowing Theo's tongue," Hermione answered as they made their way to their second period.
"What about you Harry?"
"Are you sure about this?" Harry asked me, holding my face with one hand while his forehead was against mine.
"Sorry, Moony wanted to know if I'd be home for dinner or no-" but he never finished his sentence.
Once Harry walks in, he notices that the teacher isn't there yet and that Hermione is in a seat in the front row. "Hey, Mione, why're you here? This is PREcalc."
Why? Why does he suddenly want to meet now? He knows what he wants but he thought that, by now, he would have found someone else.
Not even a minute later Draco came out of the door, looking around. "Potter, you've still got that damned cloak on, dumbass."
💜Him💜
"What's wrong with you?" Harry doesn't answer, he just looks around the room, noticing another door which he assumes is a bathroom. Draco gently grabs Harry's face, turning his head to look at him.
I was frozen for a second before I realized what was happening and started to kiss back. He tapped my thigh, so I jumped up, guessing he wanted my legs around his waist.
The bell rang, signaling the end of the day. Harry met up with Ron and Hermione. "Do you guys wanna come over and just hang out today?" Hermione shook her head.
"First hour?" Ron started.
"Don't look so surprised, it's obvious that you are." Draco just shook his head.
So, why'd you jinx m-" but I was cut off, by lips on mine.
After about 5 minutes of kissing, they pull away and just stare deeply into each others eyes. "I love you" Harry mouths, not wanting to break the silence.
"I just got my schedule fixed and I have newspaper," she groans. Both Ron and Harry looked confused, Harry speaks up.
“Let’s.” Harry agreed, laughing. The sound of Harry’s laughter was a sound that he would always love.
“You’re very difficult when it comes to Harry.” Sirius stated firmly, “The guy had to go through some weird lengths to get you to even talk to him. Do you know how difficult it is usually for someone to court someone they don’t even know? It’s extremely old school. We’re talking about early wizards that literally just bred with each other for power and name.”
“I always had the feeling you had an invisibility cloak.” Draco stated, before removing the fabric from his face, “So Weasley seems to have this idea that I’m too good for you?”
He was having an internal meltdown. Draco didn’t even want to look at Harry. If he could crawl into a hole and disappear for the rest of his life, he would. This was no how he wanted to confess his feeling to Harry. Life was just so cruel.
“Harry, I didn’t know you were a regular visitor here.” Sirius said, Draco couldn’t help but snort at that. His cousin was well-aware of the fact that Harry liked to visit him. Everyone was aware of it, “Did you know that Draco can do wandless magic?”
I know it has been a while since I last updated. Life has been hectic, I have a new job and everything seems to be going right. I'm thinking of ending Muggled - Muddled, so the next chapter will be the last. Thank you all for being so supportive.
The day had started off pretty normal, he had bought all the necessary foods and drinks for a party. But he did not even consider the fact that Pansy and Blaise would also bring alcohol. And it didn’t help that Harry bloody Potter had purchased quite an array of Muggle alcoholic drinks for him to try. His apartment had enough alcohol to satiate a small town. It was a surprise that they were not dead considering the amount of alcohol they consumed.
“Fine. I’m just saying.” Ron started, “If you want I can ask Draco out for you. Then the guy’ll reject you and you can finally start on an actual healthy relationship.”
“I believe we have. But that’s something that I’ll have to talk to Harry about later.” Draco answered, with that answer Harry felt like he was on the verge of a panic attack. They were having the same dreams? He had never heard of anyone having linked dreams. This was a first for him, “So shall we jump into business? I have a few ideas of helping the business thrive.”
“It’s okay. I forgive you.” Severus grinned, it was a melancholy look he only seemed to have whenever he remembered everything stupid that Harry had done while he was living with him, “And I believe Sirius and Remus scolded you enough.”
“So where’s Sirius?” Draco asked, “I think he’s been running away from his problems.”
“Remus? What’s going on with him?” Sirius frowned, “Harry, is he pulling my leg?”
He rushes towards the castle.
"What was a dirty trick?" Came a voice right behind Blaise. It was Neville, he came up behind him and hugged him around his waist. "Potter was being mean," Blaise smirked in victory,  something Neville couldn't see.
"Shove off, Malfoy," Ron retaliates. Hermione just rolls her eyes at their dumb freud.
Fred just said, "I wouldn't put it past her, honestly." Everyone agreed.
They both take the ends and spread it out. Draco puts the basket in the middle as Harry sits down, crossed legged. Draco does the same.
"Babe-" he was interrupted by yet another kiss as he's trying to get off the couch. "I need to," and another, "go."
"Why are you not in your robes, Harry? You're going to be late to breakfast. Ron is already dressed and in the common room." Hermione immediately started lecturing me.
He was his partner. He knew he should be excited but he was, honestly, he was ecstatic, he never get to just be around him. Ron and his fucking hatred for one another, it's fucking stupid.
Lily and James had left their best friends to babysit their 7 month old baby, Harry, so they could have a weekend to themselves.
"I've never really been the one to reach out, acting like my life was squeaky clean now."
"First off, when did you begin to tell ME what to do, it's the other way around. And second, I don't want us to do anything until you tell me what's upsetting you, I don't care if it doesn't matter, tell me." Harry was surprised, the blonde is acting like he cares.
"And why do you need to?" Harry asked, putting more emphasis on the word, 'need,' pulling him into another kiss.
Harry laughed while shaking his head, knowing that George was driving so they probably won't be there for another 15 minutes.
Hermione just looked at me, or more like studied me, then nodded. "It seems like you've been hit with a jinx, any idea who did it and don't say Malfoy-"
I hope that is what they understand. I'm not going to change just because it's crazy to them.
"So, now that I know how you feel. Harry?" Harry had an idea about what he was going to ask, and he was about to explode in happiness but he had to wait.
"Oh, I'm so sorry, I should have watched where I was goi-," but no one was there, he was confused until he looked down. It was Malfoy, he was on his knees, picking up his books.
Harry arrived at the dungeon just 5 minutes later and walks in after saying the password that Draco had told him.
The bell rang, shit, he didn't hear a word about what the project was about, he was too busy staring at Malfoy. He was turning around to ask Ron, "hey did you hear what the project was abo-," but he was already out the door. To go see Theo no doubt. Whatever.
"Can you just get it?" Harry chuckled but nodded. Harry leaned over to him and licked the chocolate off his chin.
Potter, you awake?
Harry takes Draco's hand and drags him to his bed. He pushes Malfoy on said bed and climbs in next to him. He wraps his arms around his waist as Draco puts his head in the crook of his neck.
"No, that's not my name and you know it, now, expect a punishment when you get back," he tightens his grip on his neck before fully releasing him.
They've never understood "why" I was gay, why I love who I love, it was a weird concept to them. Never wanting to even try to understand, just keeping their opinions without real reasons behind it.
The car ride to school was filled with laughter and pain filled whines from Ron when Hermione decided she didn't like something he said or did and hit him in the chest or back of the head.
Draco stayed behind while the others walked ahead. As Harry was walking past him he lightly elbowed him, "The name's Harry."
The bell rang as everyone else started coming in.
"Ah~ so-sorryyyy, Daddy~" Draco moans, trying to apologize but kept getting cut off by his own whines and moans. "Yesyesyes~ feels so good, don't stop~" Draco squeezes his eyes shut.
He just walked off waving me away.
Ron was just confused, as always, but brushed it off. "Whatever, let's just go." Harry just shrugged and nodded.
Harry was asleep when he felt a slight vibration in his hand.
"Oh, has Potter not gotten praised enough today?" Blaise asked, scowling at him. Harry was glaring at him, about to retort but stopped. He looked behind Blaise, smirked, and started waving, "Hey, Neville!"
"You got a little," Harry said while pointing to his chin, trying to tell Draco there was some remaining chocolate. Draco just rolled his eyes.
This is based off of a Reddit post I saw.
It was currently 3:27pm, they had gotten out of classes not too long ago. Harry groaned and stretched as he stood up. Dinner started at 5pm so he had some time to do whatever.
This is my favorite thing that I've wrote.
"Yeah, I'm just waiting on you dipshits."
He hears a honk from outside then an automatic barking. He grabs his phone and bag, then goes downstairs. Dobby his dachshund was barking at the door. "I swear, if they don't stop honking, one day, I'll beat them with my glue gun." Harry chuckles, "Of course you will, love you mum." Harry kisses his mom's cheek, pets Dobby's head, then is out the door.
They sat down next to each other but didn't say a word. Other than that, class was just the same as the others, only Snape didn't care about introductions and just went over the syllabus until lunch.
"Spanish."
"Harry James Potter, will you be my boyfriend?" I can't believe this is my life! "Yes, I'd really like that. And we're still going on that date."
"Yeah, I would have believed it if I wasn't, you know, your girlfriend," they heard Luna come up behind Ginny, pulling her away from Harry and in for a hug and a quick peak on the lips.
"You sure?" To which the blonde just nodded.
After lunch Hermione and I headed for transfiguration as Ron went to charms.
"I am completely in love with him but you don't need to know tha- oh shit I said that out loud, didn't I?" Hermione just started laughing at me.
Clear
"I don't think you even deserve to get what you want," Harry says darkly, smacking his ass once more.
Ron was rubbing his side when they started settling in at a table. Snape stopped them in the process, "no need to get settled, you'll have assigned seating and partners." The class groaned.
He was about to go back to sleep when he heard a male voice that sounded like he had been crying. He can't sleep, thinking that the man could be hurt or something.
Honestly, I think I might start crying if he doesn't say something soon. Actually, I think it's best if he doesn't say anything at all. I turn around, ready to high tail it out of the great hall and run to moaning Myrtle's bathroom when I feel a hand gently grab my arm.
Harry pulls his tongue out, sliding out from underneath the blond. Draco whines at that but is smacked in the ass for it.
"Monday, it's only Friday, I have to wait two whole days?" Pansy rolls her eyes.
"Will you-"
I sat down on the stool, noticing that my parents were sitting in the back. Just seeing them makes me want to cry or scream.
"What's this store right here?" Draco asks, looking at what appears to be a brand new, recently opened antique jewelry store.
"I know, love but you need to bring it down a notch, at least until we get there." Draco just nods and sits still.
Harry snapped out of it and hugged the blonde, pulling back only far enough to hold Draco's face in his head, checking for injuries.
"Harry, hurry up!" Draco yells to his boyfriend, becoming impatient. He's been standing by the door, waiting with the weaved basket, for almost 10 minutes.
Harry just sighs, "you'll hate me more than you already do."
"'Mione, stop laughing it's not funny."
"Baby, are you ok? Did he hurt you at all?" Harry asked, frantically.
"Ah~ Harry~" Draco accidentally moans out, getting too into the tongue that was currently going in and out of him rapidly. The name earning a harsh bite to his left arse cheek, that will definitely be leaving a mark.
"What? Oh, yeah, I'm fine, just tired," he yawned to push his point further. Ron just nodded.
He knew he was going to regret that.
I assumed I was correct when he put his hands under my arse to hold me up. He licked my bottom lip, asking for entrance, but I decided to decline, wanting to know what he'd do.
"That's not what I- nevermind. I'm going to ask Blaise to help me." Hermione scoffed.
"What is that supposed to mean?"
Draco pulls his messages up to Blaise.
Once they got to lunch they just got their food and sat at a random table. Harry looked around, hoping to spot the blonde, when he did he noticed that he was sitting alone, reading a book, not eating.
Was he was home he was so exhausted that after dinner he went straight to bed (which Sirius totally didn't tease him for and Remus totally didn't reprimand Sirius for doing so).
"Tell me what's wrong?"
Blaise's eyes widened, he started quickly turning around and rushed out, "I'm sorry, Nev, I was only joking, I-," but immediately stopped, realizing that there wasn't anyone behind him.
"YOU DIDN'T! " Remus shouts while attacking Sirius by kicking his legs and smacking the back of his head repeatedly.
He had just walked into their shared apartment they had just started renting a month prior.
He huffs.
Don't forget to wear that outfit you know I love.
"Yes, you do." Ron rolled his eyes and elbowed him in the ribs.
"This is perfect! He's sure to love it," Blaise says, excitedly.
Harry finally got up and got ready for the day. He put on his gray AJR, Neotheater hoodie, another pair of black, ripped jeans, and his pair of black and white high top vans.
Harry nods, "yeah, that works, I'm guessing you'll drive us?" Malfoy nods. "Ok, I'll meet you at the doors after school."
He looked like he was about to speak when the girl spoke up, "Hello, I'm Hermione Granger. And I've heard quite a lot about you, Draco Malfoy."
Blaise scowled at her, "I told you not to call me that."
"Ronald, that was only three hours ago," the girl rolled her eyes at the red head.
Come sit on daddy's face
"No, I don't think I will. But just remember, my name's the only one you get to moan out, alright?" He speaks, wrapping his hand around Draco's neck, getting his face really close to his boyfriend's.
"I know, but I can't. I'm just so excited, I've never been on a picnic before," Draco sighs.
After about 20 minutes of waiting Harry started getting confused, Draco should have been back by now. It usually only takes 10 minutes to get his broom.
"It really isn't," I said, becoming very annoyed.
Harry hits his chest hard but not hard enough to actually hurt him as his tears start to fall. "That's not funny, ferret."
Harry himself is just wearing a white button up, the sleeves rolled up to his elbow, which makes his boyfriend just fucking melt, black ripped jeans, and his all white vans.
You see, it's their 8th year, they had to do an extra year due to the war. Draco and Harry have come to a mutual agreement that they aren't enemies anymore but they don't have a need to interact with one another. That agreement actually applied to the entirety of the Slytherin and Gryffindor houses.
"So, let's go to my dorm, yes?" Ron nods, picking up his bag, and taking hold of Blaises' hand while they also leave through the portrait, leaving Harry alone.
Oh. Harry knew what this was about. Draco and Harry aren't friends, even if Harry really wanted them to be more than that.
"4," she answered bluntly.
"That's not what I-, stop telling jokes right now." Harry rolls his eyes.
I take a deep breath as I grab my guitar and slowly start to walk out onto the small stage of the night cafe.
Draco rolls his eyes, "whatever,  we done?"
"You're going to get pneumonia, you know." He shouts as Harry had just jumped from one puddle to another. "No I won't, and even if I do you'll take care of me no matter how much you say you won't!" Draco just shakes his head while laughing, knowing very well that he's right. Harry knew it too.
I'm so bloody terrified, he is surrounded by all of his Slytherin friends and I know for a fact they're gonna laugh at me, but I don't care, I've put this off for way too long. He's sitting at the Slytherin table in the great hall.
Harry made a disgusted face, "didn't need that image, Hermione." Hermione just shrugged her shoulder, not caring.
"It really is," she just continued laughing.
Draco gasps, immediately feeling himself harden at that thought.
"Yes, love, of course," Harry says as he gives Draco a peck on the cheek, taking the basket from him, and opening the door for him. Draco happily skips out of the house.
"Why should I? You don't even care."
"English 2."
The car ride was silent, not an awkward one though, just peaceful.
He wakes up to Draco carrying him inside of their loft. He smiles to himself, falling in love with him all over again, then falls asleep knowing he is in loving arms.
That's when I realized I had said that out loud, I started panicking and trying to make it seem like I said something else, but of course, it didn't work.
He got out of the elevator and walked down the hallway until he found the right door. He nervously knocked on it.
Once they had eaten, Harry tried to feed a strawberry to Draco but he was turned away so when he turned back around he got it smooched on his face. They both just laughed and Draco grabbed a napkin from the basket to wipe off the chocolate.
"I've fallen in love with you, and before you yell or hit me, I know. I know we both agreed to this. I know you specifically told me not to. I know you will never love, or even like me back. Trust me, I know," at this point Harry is breaking down, sobbing, and trying to look anywhere that isn't at Draco. "I know this is my fault and that you'll probably never talk to me again, not that you do anyways but-" Harry was cut off by rough lips against his.
Harry was sitting up, looking down at Draco who was laying down with his head in Harrys lap. They were just talking about random little things, learning some little stories they didn't know about each other, which isn't much considering that they've been together for six years.
"Wanted to taste," Harry replied like it was normal. Draco just scoffed but let it go. They ate the remaining strawberries while just admiring the scenery.
Once the bell rang, he packed up his belongings and was met by Ron at the door. "Not eye-fucking Theo today?" Harry asked, teasing Ron. Ron blushed and punched him in the arm.
Pansy comes up and puts her arm around Blaise's neck, "hey, Blasil."
They both start to take the food out of the basket and set the stuff out. They didn't pack much as it was just a small lunch. Harry had made them both a turkey sandwich with doritos on the side, Harry liked his in the sandwich, which Draco thought was disgusting but didn't say anything. They both brought a water bottle of tea, Harry's being sweet while Draco's was unsweetened. They had also packed some chocolate covered strawberries, one of Draco's favorites.
At that moment Harry had lunged at the boy holding his boyfriend hostage.
"Ronald!" But he ignored her.
Daddy🥵:
Fuck, this is what I've been waiting for.
Yeah, I'm up
Ron disecretly taps Harry on the shoulder to make him look at him from behind Hermione's head. He raises his eyebrow at Ron. "Period," Ron mouths to which Harry just raised his eyebrows in realization and nods his head in understanding.
Once they had eaten, Harry tried to feed a strawberry to Draco but he was turned away so when he turned back around he got it smooched on his face. They both just laughed and Draco grabbed a napkin from the basket to wipe off the chocolate.
"Blaise-" the name made him growl. "And I are going to Hogsmeade, his and Nevilles' 2 year anniversary is coming up and he wants me to help him find something special for him. And stop growling at every males name that comes out of my mouth."
"Be patient, she's almost always on time, but today she said she's bringing her friends with her."
Draco let's out a small smile and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck saying, "thank you, and I was thinking more of an emerald green color?" He says more like a question because he IS considerate of Harry's opinions. Well the ones that matter anyway.
“Yes. You will still get your wine and chocolates if you say no.” Harry answered flatly, his face was blank. But Draco had read enough people in his lifetime to know that the other wizard was panicking, “I’m not going to force you into anything that you don’t want.”
Rubbing up against mine
“Oh, Pan.” Draco cooed, pulling her into his arms. The brunette in response let out a loud wail. Draco was going to kill whoever caused her to feel like this, “What’s happened?”
“And don’t forget to tell your friends that this happening.” Narcissa added, “I’m happy for the both of you. This means that marriage is in the cards.”
“What look?” Draco queried, before smiling widely. Harry had planned a family dinner that Draco was sure had something to do with his birthday and all his friends and family were invited. The blond had a feeling that they were going to try to make it seem like a surprise, but Draco knew when his own birthday was, “I guess we should get going.”
“Can’t let anyone know what?” Harry asked, popping out of nowhere like normal. Harry finally took notice of Sirius, “Hey Sirius, I didn’t know you would be here.”
“Well, I think it’s time we went to consummate the marriage.” Draco stated, “So enjoy the open bar, take as much as food as you want. Take the damn cake too if you want.”
“Harry’s a numpty.” Draco sighed, relaxing a bit. The brunet could be infuriating sometimes, “It’s worse that you played along with it.”
“Don’t you think that’s kind of excessive?” Harry frowned, “If you’re not doing anything later, do you want to meet up?”
“Magic is magic is it not?” Lucius shot back, he wasn’t challenging Harry. It was more of a discussion and Harry didn’t necessarily think of anything bad in regards to the dark arts, “But why the sudden curiosity in my son? He refuses to come back to England and has relocated to France. I’m surprised that you were even aware that he existed.”
“Come on. I’m only saying that if you do end up struggling, you can always contact him. You have that option.” Blaise smiled all-knowingly, “And he was the one that offered to help you move out here. But you decided to be stubborn and get us to help instead.”
“That doesn’t make any sense at all.” Draco frowned, drumming his fingers on the arm of the chair. He had a feeling he knew exactly what she was trying to say. But he wasn’t going to accept something that he had never heard of before. Draco would need to see more evidence of similar situations. And he would probably have to find a way to discuss this with actual scholars, “I don’t understand what you’re trying to say.”
I know it’s pretty clever, but it’s got no soul
“Guy. I found this little guy.” Sirius beamed, thrusting a kitten into Draco’s hands. It was an ebony cat with the clearest green eyes that Draco had ever seen. The blond was smitten straight away, “Harry, why are you looking at me like that?”
The food was often enchanted to not get cold, so Draco had a feeling that his father was helping him out in his own little way. It was embarrassing to think that it took him this long to realise his feelings for Harry. Everything was starting to make perfect sense. Like why he didn’t feel a connection to Andy at all. It was obviously because the man wasn’t Harry. But he had no idea how Harry felt for him. So it kind of felt like a losing game.
“No. No. Draco we cannot keep a cat in the house.” Harry groaned, Draco just gave him a look and it was clear that Harry had already lost the battle. The cat was now a part of the family, “Fine. Jesus. The cat can stay.”
“Well… I guess I can’t get you to change yourself.” Draco laughed, “That’s fine. If you’ve always caused trouble, that’s just who you are.”
The blond smiled as he popped the croissant and latte in front of Harry, the brunet looked a little confused at the croissant.
“I know that you’re not completely comfortable being in the presence of Remus yet, but it should get better if we ease you into it.” Severus tried, “You were best friends and I’m sure it’s possible to get to that stage again.”
Harry was expecting a visit from Draco a lot sooner. Maybe Draco was really as estranged as his father made him out to be. But that didn’t change the fact that Harry wasn’t surprised when the blond finally did make an appearance outside his door. It gave him great joy to see that Draco finally appeared to be able to feign something other than indifference. Harry was going to make Draco regret leaving him in the alley.
"Harry, I've liked you since first year, I'd love to go out with you. Hell, I'd even just be your boyfriend right now, Merlin knows we've known each other long enough, " Draco smiled even bigger making me grin back, his words finally hit me and they make me beam with joy.
"That's what I did? Merlin, you made me think it was serious!"
"I'll see you after the show, yes?"
💜Him💜
They go on a picnic date.
"Never."
"Don't be like that. Let's just stay here and go to bed." Harry thinks about it and nods.
When they walked in they saw that Snape was already there and so was Malfoy. Ron just groans at the sight of Malfoy and Hermione elbows him in the ribs, tired of his unnecessary freud between them.
Draco leans back up and pecks him on the lips. "Ok, now let's go get those curtains!" He says excitedly.
Harry himself is just wearing a white button up, the sleeves rolled up to his elbow, which makes his boyfriend just fucking melt, black ripped jeans, and his all white vans.
They then realize that both Ginny and Luna had started walking to wherever.
Harry starts to scream but it's not heard. Remus walks in, rubbing his eyes, and says while yawning "Is he back to sleep already? That was fa-" he pauses
Daddy, please, I'm sorry
"Dobby woke me up." Lily just nods.
He sighed and looked down at his own nails but gasped.
"Draco, you need to calm down, I'm coming," Harry called down the stairs, smiling while rolling his eyes.
"I wanna see Dudley soon, when could I?" He asked, standing by they microwave, heating up his food.
And who do you think you're talking to, slut? Should I even tell you where I am if you're going to act like a brat?
Harry gives Draco a gift but gets laughed at.
Harry looks around the common room, it was empty except for Seamus and Dean who had fallen asleep in the chair sitting diagonally from the couch Harry was currently sitting on.
"Let's just head inside." Everyone agreed. They all started to head inside the little café.
Hermione suddenly hits Ron's chest, "I HEARD THAT." Both Ron and Harry look scared. "But I didn't even say anything!" Ron says exasperated. "Oh, don't you pick up that tone with me, Ronald." She really does sound that a mixture of Lily and Molly sometimes.
Of course everything I did was the bad thing, to my father, that is. Although, he never told others, too ashamed that his son was never going to live up to the Malfoy name.
Don't get an attitude with me, bitch.
Hermione just sighed, "they mixed my schedule up and it'll be fixed by lunch." Harry just nods.
"Just going to do some flying, want to come?" Draco smiled and nodded his head.
Harry freezes at first but soon melts into the kiss. Draco is the first to pull away.
They go on a picnic date.
Draco had brought his polaroid camera to capture some cute pictures of their picnic and the flowers around them.
Once they arrive at their destination they get out. Draco waits as Harry gets the Basket out of the back and locks the car once all the doors are shut.
"I'm bisexual," Harry smirks through the tears. He hears Draco give a small chuckle.
After practice Harry noticed that a certain blonde was seated in the stands, he was about to call out to him when his coach came up to him. "Good practice today, Potter," Oliver patted him on the back, "now go shower and go home."
Harry just smiles and continues to drive.
At this moment Harry looked around to find all the people in the common room staring at him. He looked to the person that pulled him away from the other boy, who was currently being carried to the hospital wing, Draco.
Ron raised his eyebrow, "what's the difference?."
"Sorry, hon, Ron made us stop for food," a bushy haired girl said as she hopped out of the driver's seat.
"Huh? Oh, yeah. I just need to go to the bathroom real quick. You go ahead, I'll meet you there," he says, not giving Blaise a chance to tell him what store he's even heading to.
What he saw made his blood boil. Theodore Nott, trying to kiss a obviously very uncomfortable Draco Malfoy.
Hermione scoffed and glared at me, "well, I'm sorry that I just want to be able to get to your classes on time, excuse me for caring."
Once they got to the school they all went their separate ways. Hermione met up with Pansy and they went to class. Same with Ron and Theo. Which left Harry to walk to class by himself.
Nott didn't seem surprised at all and just smirked at Harry, not letting Draco go.
Harry knows that Draco doesn't like him because he never acknowledged his presence, he never texts him just to talk, he hasn't actually talked to him at all for the past month and a half.
Pansy just acted like she didn't hear him, "so, Blasil, you do know you really are whipped for him though, right?"
Harry and Draco also had a different agreement. Well that was until Harry started catching feelings for the blonde. Their agreement was, what some would say, "fuck buddies".
"I said that even when you're  being an arse you're pretty. I didn't mean to say it out loud of course, obviously, why would I have wanted you to know that I'm in love with y-" but I quickly put my hand over my mouth and ran towards the great hall.
If you don't come to me or tell me where you are I'm going to just get my toys and do it myself.
So he decided he would just make sure everything was ok even if it was weird that he didn't even know who lived up there. He left his apartment and took the elevator to the second floor.
"I don't hate you, Potter."
"Wanted to taste," Harry replied like it was normal. Draco just scoffed but let it go. They ate the remaining strawberries while just admiring the scenery.
He stands next to Draco who is moaning like crazy, he then slid a gag into his mouth. He bends down real close to his face, turning it so he can stare into his pretty gray eyes.
After he hears Fred honk. He puts his plate in the sink and ran to the car. "You guys have to stop honking, you're lucky mum wasn't home. Yesterday she said that she'd "beat you with her glue gun." They all just laughed.
Whatever🙄
He was all alone in his first class, he did have a couple of his teammates in it but they weren't close. Precalculas went by slowly but it was fine because he was actually good at it.
He heard Lily call Dobby downstairs, to which he immediately jumped off of Harry and ran downstairs, the sound of his nails against the hardwood floor was all that was heard.
"Get a room she-weasel," and there it was, the voice from his dream.
I stand up, the audience applauding. I walk straight for my parents, my mother sobbing.
Even when he's being an arse he's pretty. I thought, trying hard not to stare at him for too long. Malfoy's glare turned into a look of confusion.
Where the hell are you?!
Once he was dressed, he grabbed his bag and phone, and ran downstairs to eat some breakfast. "Wow, you're up early," his mom commented. Harry just shrugged.
Harry pulls out of the driveway and they head off. Draco turns on the radio, not too loud but just loud enough for some background music. Harry puts his hand on Draco's thigh which makes him beam with delight. He has told Harry how much he adores the little touches here and there.
Draco walks into his shared apartment to find something so horrendous.
"Yeah," Harry urged.
Harry realizes that he really does only have about five minutes to get ready now. "Fuck," he whispers, knowing if it was any louder his mom would hear. That woman's hearing was scary sometimes. He then hears it, his worst nightmare.
They both smile and Malfoy thanks him and he'll take the offer when he's ready. They both fell asleep knowing that they'll both be fine.
"Well actually, asshole, it reminds me of your eyes." He says in an matter-of-fact way. Harry smiles with love in his eyes and leans down to kiss him with passion.
"Oh, seriously Ronald, he isn't Satan, you need to get over your grudge against him, what is it he even did?" Hermione had a point, he always hated him without explaining why, he just told Harry he hated him one day and he just went along with it, no questions asked.
We sat and ate in silence, luckily the silver trio hadn't come into the great hall.
"Probably this weekend, when you both don't have school." Harry nods, taking his plate out of the microwave. Lily walks out the door, Harry hears the car start, then drive away.
"Potter, I saw you crying, can you just come out?"
Harry smiled down at him, rolling his eyes because he's gonna have to wake him up in 10 minutes to get him out of the car, but Harry just let him be.
💜Him💜
"You really shouldn't, I think it's rather cute, you rambling."
It's another five minutes before she points to a car pulling in while saying, "that's her, come on." She takes draco by the wrist and drags him to the car.
"What do you want, Potter?" Malfoy asked but it came out quieter then wanted and with no malice whatsoever.
Hermione grabbed Ron's wrist and pulled him out of the room with a "get dressed now and meet us in the common room and if you're not down there in 10 minutes it's a detention." I groaned but got up.
Draco gasped and hit her with a pillow, "but you said-"
"Oh, did you happen to catch what the project was about?"
Harry and his friends all busted out into laughter, Pansy and Draco also trying to hide their amusement. Blaise slowly turned back around, continuing to glare daggers at Harry, "that was a dirty trick, Potter."
After Draco got all the pictures he wanted, which was three 10 packs of film, much to Harry's displeasure, Harry found it adorable but wouldn't admit it, they sat back down on the blanket and just talked.
Hermione changed the subject, "I'm going over to Pansy's after school." Harry laughed, "you gave in, huh?" She just pouted and crossed her arms, "you knew I would." But she got over it quickly and they both started laughing.
"Who?" The boy just scoffed and rolled his eyes.
To: Redheaded dumbass #7
"Really? Let me see!" Draco goes over to where Blaise was standing, wanting to see what he was holding, only for him to turn away.
Once I was dressed, we were on our way to breakfast. We turned the corner and bumped into Malfoy and his friends, Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini.
"they're actually really cute together," Hermione said while smiling. Harry sighed and whispered a quiet, "yeah." Hermione looked at him questioningly but decided to push it aside, knowing the cause.
The interior design of the place was beautiful. Everything in the store was beautiful. There were great crystal chandeliers hanging on the high raised ceiling. There were shelves upon shelves of old rustic looking necklaces, bracelets, rings and earrings. Everything was just so beautiful.
"That actually sounds really good, I'd like that." Harry nods, takes his boyfriend by the hand and leads them to his dorm to take a nap.
"Oh, you're going to your classes or that'll be a two week detention for you."
Harry smiled down at him, rolling his eyes because he's gonna have to wake him up in 10 minutes to get him out of the car, but Harry just let him be.
When he heard the words he had a faint smile, he just knew he'd be ok. Harry knew from there what exactly he wanted to say.
He was just expecting to find his boyfriend doing something he does everyday like cleaning the dishes or taking a shower. What he didn't expect was to find the tragedy awaiting him in the bedroom.
When I turn around I just stood there shocked. I can feel that my eyes are glossy from the tears that were about to spill out. A box of chocolates are right in front of my face, and not the ones I bought him. They had MY name on them.
He grabs a plain white T-shirt, a pair of black distressed jeans, his favorite rainbow checkered vans with some no show socks, and to top it all off, his red varsity jacket.
"I wonder?" Sirius thought to himself. "Don't hate me for this please, no hard feelings?" He took his wand out and "Silencio" he whispered. He smiled when the sound stopped and looked at a confused baby Harry.
"Wha-" but he was cut off but Harry stood up.
Hermione comes storming back to the table, obviously upset. Ron just looks at her questioningly, "I thought you were-," but she interrupts him.
Once they were on their way back home, they were just listening to music and enjoying the others company. Draco soon fell asleep, tired out from all his excitement.
"SAME, ok, third?"
I do love my mom but she's still part of the problem, I hope she doesn't hate me after this. I honestly don't give a shit about what my father thinks, though.
"Be my-"
"No I don't, but anyways, no, he has to help Smith with his books, him being on crutches and all." Harry just nods his head in understanding.
"H-hey, Mal- Draco," I still haven't gotten over the fact that we're friends now so I mix up his name a lot. "Oh hi, Harry, are you feeling ok? You look really pale and flushed." Draco says, putting his hand up to my forehead which only makes me blush harder.
"We actually need to do the project now." Draco groans.
He sits on the toilet, contemplating what he should do. If he goes through with what he wants to, he's most definitely getting punished. He decided against it, knowing it'd be better to just get to Harry as fast as possible.
"Almost, I need to pay and then I want to get him some candy from honeydukes and maybe some stuff from Weasley' Wizard Wheezes." Draco holds back a groan, wanting to hurry back to his da- Harry, hurry back to Harry, and nods.
By the time he reaches his dorm he's out of breath, bent over and huffing.
But immediately started laughing so hard their stomach started to hurt. "That was a really believable one," Ginny laughed.
Draco just scoffed and turned to walk out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, pulling out some Firewhiskey. Harry had followed him into their kitchen to continue questioning what he had done wrong.
"Yeah, at least Hermione knows so it's not as heavy on me."
"Yeah," Malfoy whispers, pushing past him, rushing out to get to his next class.
This part right here, if they get anything from this, I want it to be this part. They need to understand me and my thinking.
He whines.
Daddy🥵:
As Draco was dragging him to a couch that was in the room he started becoming upset. He started thinking about how this was what all of their interactions will be like. He started getting a bit angry but tried to not let it show.
As they turned the corner to their classes they saw Theo leaning over Ron, against the lockers. They were both just smiling and laughing together.
"Lay down, arse up."
"Hey Raven, where're you going?" Draco questioned, placing a small kiss on Harry's cheek, making him blush slightly.
"No, I don't think I will, I like the view," Draco says as he smacks Harry's ass. The smack causes Harry to squeal.
Oi, Potter watch where you're going, you great prat," he spat.
"Yeah, that's what I thought."
"So? Last year you loved newspaper, what's wrong?"
Harry puts the basket in the trunk as Draco gets in the passenger seat of their car. Once Harry closes the trunk he gets into the car and starts it up.
He happened to get a glimpse of the ravens nails as he walked ahead of him.
When they were getting ready to leave, it was around 2:00pm. They packed up all of their belongings and started heading back to the car. On the way back they were just holding hands while laughing, stealing little kisses here and there.
"You're actually going to work with him? I'd thought you'd just have Malfoy do all the work." Hermione elbowed him.
"Yes, yes, I know Draco, you've only said that about a thousand times before. Honestly, what's the rush?" Pansy questions, sitting on the floor in front of the blonde.
"World History."
"No, Fred and George are picking me up, along with Ron and Hermione."
"Only because you asked so nicely," Harry smiled and pulled Draco in for a kiss which he returned. The kiss was slow and sweet, but it was also short, much to Harry's dismay. He groans which causes Draco to laugh.
"Oh, and who is this cutie?" Draco looked around, looking for who he was talking to.
Harry laughs softly, "Honestly it's been 3 years since Hogwarts and you're still very much obsessed with your house colors." Draco punches his arm, but not enough to hurt him.
"Now I'm on my own, I've lost my magic, dealing with your bullshit now I'm over it."
He put me down and said "meet me by the Slytherin dorms tonight at midnight, don't be late or you will have consequences."
"No I'm not!" Blaise was getting really mad at this point.
Of course Sirius and Remus had said yes immediately. Wanting to let them have time together without any interruptions and they just wanted to spend time with Harry.
"Harry, hurry up!" Draco yells to his boyfriend, becoming impatient. He's been standing by the door, waiting with the weaved basket, for almost 10 minutes.
Come sit on Daddy's face, I want my tongue inside of you so badly
Neville stops him, "calm down, Ron stop it, I have Molly on speed dial." That shut him up.
When you say what you want to say, the words will just fall out.
"We just watched a movie marathon in her room, her parents are gone on a business trip this week. We just cuddled and fell asleep." No one made a comment and just nodded.
"NO, I DO, I JUST-" but Blaise didn't know what to say. But, Neville calmed him down. "Stop, Blaise, just smile and wave." Blaise did so while Neville dragged him away to wherever. Ron, Harry, Draco, Pansy, and Ginny all yell "WHIPPED," at the same time.
He soon had learned that green was his favorite color. Even if the only reason was because his soulmates eyes were green. It didn't matter, he loved the color.
Draco just rolled his eyes and threw Harry over shoulder.
Harry grabbed his invisibility cloak, the Marauder's map, and his phone, then he was off to the ROR. Harry put the cloak on and opened the map, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
"And you took a part of me, left me with the memories oh, we were never a family, now you're standing in front of my door, like none of this happened at all."
"Yes, I'm actually going to help, I like English. Oh there's Malfoy now, I gotta go, bye," he said while jogging up to Malfoy "Ready to go?" Malfoy just silently nodded.
Harry smiles at his adorable boyfriend, admiring how he looks in his outfit. Draco is wearing a pastel pink cropped sweater, high waisted, white jean shorts with pastel pink fishnets underneath, his pastel pink converse, and to top it all off, a pastel yellow, pink, and purple flower crown sitting on his head.
"I asked you a question."
Daddy🥵:
Harry just took the elevator back to his own floor and went inside his apartment. He went into his bedroom lying on the floor.
He said he needed to go back inside. "Wish I could explain the sound but I didn't hear anything." He explained. He said it must have just the wind.
"Oh, come on, pleeeeaasssee?" Harry giggled and jumped into Draco's arms.
Harry pulls out of the driveway and they head off. Draco turns on the radio, not too loud but just loud enough for some background music. Harry puts his hand on Draco's thigh which makes him beam with delight. He has told Harry how much he adores the little touches here and there.
Just then a knock was heard, Hermione came bustling in, not waiting for an answer.
He gasps as his door swings open and he's thrown on the bed. He's quickly turned over, ass in the air.
"I do want to continue speaking with you mother, as for father." I gather up all my courage.
This be a High School AU.
Right before he gets in the backseat, his mom yells "LOVE YOU, HAZ, BE GOOD." He smiles
Draco grumbled saying something about catching a cold but stands up nonetheless. "Fine but only for 5 minutes, then we're going home." Harry smiles widely and shouts "deal!" Draco grins at his child-like personality.
He got back on the elevator, went to his door, and knocked once more. When Malfoy opened the door he looked annoyed but before he could speak Harry started playing "lean on me" on his phone. So he knew he could lean on him.
"Why were you being mean to my Blaise?" Neville asked in a scolding tone.
"I don't even know, but she's really annoying and nosy." They just nodded and left it at that. After lunch they headed back to chemistry to finish the syllabus.
"Yes, sir," Harry soluted at him, mockingly. Oliver just rolled his eyes, playfully, and chuckled.
His eyes widen when he sees a silent but screaming Harry. Everything is silent until..
Once they arrive at their destination they get out. Draco waits as Harry gets the Basket out of the back and locks the car once all the doors are shut.
"YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH MALFOY?" Ron asked, wide eyed.
Once he got to the door he texted Draco that he was there. He waited for the door to appear.
"Nothing, can we just get this over with?" This surprises Draco, Harry usually hates when they get finished too fast, he likes it to last as long as possible.
"Oh." His dad answered simply, then walked away.
He lubes it up and shoves it in, turning it up to speed 3 on a 5 point scale.
"I'm sorry, I was inconsiderate of your opinion. If you want we can go back to the store and exchange it. What color did you want, babe?" He ask calmly, trying to please his love.
Harry whines, "nooowww?" Draco answers back with a, "Yes now, the store closes soon, now let's go!"
The loud sound of a smack reverberates around the room.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to say that out loud, I meant it but didn't mean to tell you to your face. Also, I'm not going to classes to day, I don't feel like it. I was going to lie and say I was sick but for some reason, that's not what's happening," I smack my hand back over my mouth.
He was about to respond but saw another text
They fall asleep wrapped up in each other, a smile on both of their faces.
"Rita Skeeter, she used to write for "Private Eye," the magazine, but was fired when they found out she was giving false information," Hermione explained.
"Sorry, Mione."
"He only gave us 2."
Harry was about to ask about his first hour when he realized that Draco was standing in front of them, staring at the floor awkwardly. "You need something, Malfoy?" Which seems to startle him a bit, making him flinch.
He was sitting on the curb of a random street, Harry had told him to pull over as soon as he saw puddles of rain form on the road.
"My family always said I was the bad child."
"Like everything I do is just a letdown, feeling like I always do the wrong thing. Telling all their friends I'm the bad kid. Now I'm on my own, I've lost my magic, dealing with your bullshit now I'm over it. And you took a part of me, left me with the memories oh, we were never a family, now you're standing in front of my door, like none of this happened at all. I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child, I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child, cause you will never understand my weird mind, my weird mind. And to every single person here that doubts me, telling me that they could live without me, cause they will never understand my weird mind, my weird mind."
"No, something about being jinxed blah blah blah, now back to Malfoy," he stared at Harry, waiting for an explanation.
"Seriously, Ronald? That's all you got from that?"
It was a small little park in the front but as they walked down the trail behind the playground there was a huge flower patch.
Right before I finish this off, I look straight into my father's eyes, trying to make him feel my emotions, just this once.
Fred and George had already gone to their next class, probably to prank their newest teacher, or as they called it, their "newest victim".
“Draco! I came as soon as I heard.” Narcissa voiced excitedly, pulling her son into her arms before pressing kisses onto his face, “So have the dreams started?”
“But I’m your plonker.” Harry laughed, in turn making Draco laugh.
“This wasn’t a test.” Andy smiled, “I’m sorry if I made you feel that way. It’s just the store manager was bragging about your work and I wanted to see it for myself.”
“Yes. I haven’t received a response from her yet.” Draco started, “I was just wondering how the Slytherins were being treated. After the war, I don’t imagine that they’re on equal grounds as the other houses. They’re probably even considered evil.”
“Don’t tell that to Hermione because she will actually kill me.” Draco laughed, “I guess I should thank you for telling her to give me a chance at friendship.”
“Why’s Draco red?” Harry asked, taking in the scene. The brunet was unknowing as ever and Draco couldn’t help but feel relieved. From the way his parents were talking, the blond made his affections obvious before he was even aware that there were affections.
“I’m not pitying you.” Harry promised, “If anything, I admire you.”
“And vanity.” Draco added, “Let’s hope that Ginny is frightened off by your personality.”
The brunet then found a table in one of the far corners of the café in hopes that he wouldn’t be noticed straight away. When Draco came back into sight, Harry couldn’t help but notice how he seemed very friendly with his coworker. And for some reason that made his gut twist painfully.
I’d sleep on a bed that’s made of concrete
Draco ran over to Harry’s collapsed body and started incanting every healing spell he knew, anything to make sure that Harry would be okay.
Just the two of us and no sheets
“I guess that’s true.” Harry sighed, in a way it did make sense. And it wasn’t like Draco would call him unless it was absolutely necessary, “So what are your plans for the day?”
“The thing is. He’s my boss.” Draco breathed, “I don’t want to end on bad terms because it wasn’t that bad of a place to work. There has to be something that I can do for the time being.”
“Harry?” Draco frowned, rubbing his eyes, “Next time I’ll be the one picking the film. This was just downright dreadful.”
“So you figured it out?” Hermione smiled, rubbing his shoulders, “Are you okay?”
“He’s not my friend.” Draco said softly, earning an incredulous look from Harry, “H-he’s my boyfriend.”
Draco loved his mother. He really did. But the idea of marriage at this current moment was terrifying, the blond turned to Harry and noticed that the brunet had also paled at the comment. It was good that they were both on the same page.
“N- no. I was staring at your socks, not your feet.” Harry defended himself, “They just look really cosy.”
He let out a long sigh and debated on whether to wake Harry up or not. Draco turned his face to take a glimpse at Harry’s face. The brunet’s eyes were bruised. And that could only mean one thing. He hadn’t been sleeping well.
“Wow. Draco knows your house a lot better than you know it.” Remus teased, in turn making Harry turn redder, “I should get going. It was nice seeing the both of you.”
“Wow. Ron. That’s actually good advice.” Draco said, he tried not to sound astonished, he really did. But luckily Ron didn’t seem to notice, “I still have no idea how I’m supposed to confront him about it.”
“Of course there is.” Harry argued, “The odds were against you. Both you and your mother still managed to do what was right in the end. If that isn’t something that isn’t to be admired, then I sure as hell don’t know what is. And I wouldn’t have been able to take Voldemort down without everyone’s help. It was your wand that I used to destroy him.”
“No.” Hermione voiced, “Harry told me that you’ve taken an interest in Muggle activities?”
“Sure.” Draco smiled, pressing his lips against Harry’s own in a chaste kiss, “Yeah. It didn’t feel as weird as I thought it would.
“Are you telling me you can do wandless magic?” Sirius questioned, sitting up straight. It was weird to think that his cousin was so interested in this.
“Are you crazy?” Draco hissed out, forcing his way into Harry’s house, “Scratch that. Of course, you’re bloody crazy. That’s the only thing that can explain how you would go to my parents hours within meeting me to request to court me.”
“Fine.” Draco agreed, “Just one date.”
Sirius sighed before apparating off. But Harry and Draco decided against christening the house and instead opted for drinking wine in front of the telly.
“Okay. I’ll try to pop by soon.” Harry agreed, “But if I get hexed, I’m not going to be too happy.”
Staring at the picture on the wall
But I just wanna walk
“If I tell you this. You have to promise to not tell another living soul. This means even your boyfriend.” Blaise stated, waiting for Draco’s affirmative nod before continuing, “I am interested in a certain witch. But I don’t want to pursue her.”
“I’ll let him know.” Harry smiled, “So what do you think about christening the house.”
“I know.” Harry smiled, taking a sip of his tea, “That’s why we’re friends.”
“Spit it out. What are you trying to say?” Draco frowned, folding his arms over his chest. He didn’t like where this conversation was going at all.
“A potions master?” Lucius questioned, “Are you sure that’s a career path that you want to do?”
“Okay.” Draco sighed, “I’ll talk to Ron as soon as I can. But I’m going to need you to calm down. I’m sure it isn’t as bad as we think it is.”
“Severus dear, can you please show Sirius the wine cellar? My dear cousin had a recommendation but I, unfortunately, can’t remember the make or year of the bottle.” Narcissa smiled, “And Draco. Can you follow? I don’t want Sirius to get a hold of my other wines.”
“Why waste the time?” Draco asked rhetorically, “It takes less time for you to just apparate here and see for yourself.”
“I’m glad that you seem to be fine with this whole thing.” Harry sighed, “I can’t believe he hit you.”
“I’d like that.” Draco smiled, “But Ron, I have to say that I really am sorry for everything. I take back everything I said about you and your family. It was really degrading and not forgivable.”
“Because he hasn’t seen Remus in a while.” Draco pointed out, “That sounds like a man that’s running away from his problems. And I’m sure he’ll feel a lot better if he just talks to him.”
“What do you mean no one knows we’re dating?” Harry frowned, “Everyone I know, knows.”
He would finally be able to live a relatively normal life.
“Of course.” Draco smiled, he felt like he was going to cry. For the first time in his life, he believed in soulmates, “I’ll spend the rest of my life with you.”
“I don’t know. I just thought that you would try to date a Muggle while living here.” Harry commented, “I’m sorry for assuming.”
“Harry lets go.” Draco said quickly, “I’m sure someone’s already called the police.”
That’s why Draco had to pull Harry off of the guy. If he had it his way, Draco would have let Harry continue to beat the shit out of Andy. But he didn’t want Harry to get arrested.
“Were you a part of Harry’s life?” Draco had to ask, he knew that his cousin was awful to Severus. His father had often commented on it and made sure that Draco wouldn’t grow up to be a bully, “Did Severus let you be a part of his life.”
But that also meant that he would have to do something else for the year, he had already quit his Muggle job and he wasn’t entirely sure if he should get another one, or try to get something in the Wizarding world. He had so many options to pick from.
“Actually, it was within minutes of meeting you. Lucius Malfoy ran into me when you decided to apparate off without agreeing to have a conversation with me.” Harry corrected. The brunet was going to do everything in his power to make sure that Draco would not get away from him this time around. The dreams continued, but Harry wanted this to be a part of his reality, “Your parents have invited me to Malfoy Manor to discuss courting arrangements.”
Draco let out an embarrassingly loud sound, he wasn’t sure what it was. But the blond sunk his face down into his hands to hide. He knew he was bright red and he didn’t want his parents to see him like this.
“I didn’t actually think that far because I didn’t think that this was going to happen.” Harry admitted, “Er. I guess we can just continue doing what we were doing?”
“Oh. No. Draco it’s when you have sex in every room.” Harry explained, “I never realised how weird it was to say that until you asked me if it was something religious.”
It took a moment for his parent's words to sink in. The knowing looks from everyone, Hermione, Sirius, and his parents. They all seemed to know something that he didn’t know. And now it made perfect sense. He finally understood what was going on.
Apparently, that was the wrong thing to say. A fist collided with his cheek, was it bad that he was so used to getting punched that he wasn’t surprised anymore.
“The dream-walking stop as soon as you meet the person.” Sirius said sadly, “Draco. This dream-walking thing is not trying to take control of your life. It’s only showing you possibilities.”
“Drake. You’re a real professional.” Andy smiled, going in a little too close for comfort, “Should I take you out tonight?”
Maybe helping Draco was what he needed.
“Oh has he now? A friend of mine has mentioned your son in passing and I came across a picture of him. He’s a handsome fellow.” Harry smiled, so Draco hadn’t even told his parents that he was back in England. Maybe he could try and get Lucius’ approval to court Draco. That would make it easier to get in touch with the younger Malfoy, “I want to know more about him because I fancy him and I intend to court him.”
“A little bit late with the warning considering I just married the guy.” Draco snorted, watching as Harry made his way over to them, “Speak of the devil. Here comes my husband.”
“Of course he would.” Lucius answered, “You are his Godson.”
“Maybe it is.” Draco grinned, he was going to do something to help Blaise out.
“Harry. We haven’t seen you in a while.” Hermione smiled, hugging her friend, “Ron seems to think that you’re blowing us off for a girl.”
“Great.” Harry responded, “This isn’t a regular latte. What did you add? It’s pretty good. And I’m not even a coffee drinker.”
“Oh, Merlin.” Draco groaned, he had a feeling he knew exactly what his father did. But it wasn’t something that he wanted to say out loud, “Of course my father would do something like that.”
“You do understand.” Narcissa sighed, “I think you should visit your cousin, maybe you will need to talk to someone else that’s a Black.”
“Please kill me.” Draco said to himself, he felt bloody awful and he had no idea where everyone else was. Well. At least he now knew to never mix different alcohols. Draco was a wine drinker. Now he kind of liked everything. But that didn't change the fact that he was sure he had never felt this bad in his entire life from consuming wine.
“I guess I can do that. It’s not like I have anything else to do.” Sirius snorted, “Harry doesn’t even visit these days. He found his own circle of friends.”
“Our chains?” Draco frowned, it was clear that the man was not a regular customer, “Who are you?”
I need something real
“It’s okay.” Hermione said firmly, “You don’t have to say anything.”
“You were a menace. And yes, you did have us wrapped around your little finger.” Severus sighed. Tousling Harry's already messy hair, “I should probably get going. But Harry, take care of yourself and maybe get a haircut. Your hair is getting a little out of control.”
“The joys of having seven brothers.” Ginny said offhandedly, and Draco took note of how she seemed to add an extra person. Which could only mean that she considered Harry to be similar to an older brother? The blond almost let out a sigh of relief before stopping himself. He didn’t want to draw any attention to himself, “Harry. I’m going to tell everyone soon. I just wanted to tell Draco something.”
“Padfoot.” Remus greeted affectionately, “It’s been a while old friend.”
“Mione, you can’t tell anyone.” Harry sighed, “I’ve been getting to know him and he’s not that bad of a person.”
Backtracking on what happened earlier made him question where everything went wrong.
“Do you think he will mind elderflower wine?” Harry asked cautiously. He had heard of Superior Red, but surely Draco wouldn’t be too happy being gifted the wine that his family manufactured, “Or do you think he would hate it?”
- "Shut it, Pottah and get to work" - Slytherin muttered, feeling slippery gripping his prick.
The grey-eyed boy hid his face in his hands. Blaise gave him a friendly touch on the shoulder and said:
-" I'm not going anywhere, "the Slytherin said confidently, and his voice showed no mockery or malice.
- "Potter is all naked" - he whispered into space. However, everyone around seemed not to pay attention. He turned to Blaise, who was eating scrambled eggs and seemed to be absorbed in the dish rather than the surroundings.
The teacher surreptitiously looked at the Slytherin Prince in disgust. The huge nine-inch lump was way too noticeable from his perspective. Fortunately for him, everyone else was busy working in the classroom. The professor did not want to pay attention to the godson so as not to make him more "delusional".
He watched the beautiful blonde wisps fall over his forehead. The pale body pressed against him with all the force it had, until his testicles hit the cheeks of the younger brunet.
- "Idiot, can't you see that the golden boy is not wearing clothes? Look at him!" He turned to Nott, who was sitting to his right.
-"Potty, deeper .. I know you can!" - Harry felt Draco's hand pulling his hair. He grabbed the rest of the shaft in his hand and opened his mouth wider and wider and wanted to contain every inch of the enormous prick. He stopped controlling his reflexes. He sucked his cheeks hard and tried to make the Slytherin feel as much pleasure as possible. Potter wasn't pleased that the Slytherin wasn't moaning as loudly as when he was jerking off.
Draco, shocked, stumbled over his legs. He rubbed his eyes in disbelief, but Potter was no longer there. As he reached the entrance, he slowly started walking towards the Slytherin table. The Slytherin Prince's jaw dropped involuntarily, and even considering the distance between the tables, he realized he was staring at The Chosen One.
- "I will fuck it out of you, Potty".
- " Then let me go so I can go to my dormitory"
As soon as the water was full and foam covered every possible surface, Grey-eyed sat on the edge of the tub. Griffindor suppressed a groan of discontent. However, moments later, the Prince of Slyterin took the imposing penis in his hand and started teasing it with his hand.
It was better for Draco than his daily wet dreams starring Harry. He pleased not only himself, but also Potter, writhing on his stomach in front of him. After a series of moans, Harry felt a warm stream spread across his thighs. At that moment he heard the grey-eyed fingers tightening on his thighs, and behind Scarhead it seemed that he heard a loud, long, low groan behind his back.
Malfoy decided to take off the chameleon spell and reveal his presence. He had a great urge to kiss the brunet. Scarhead got goosey.
Potter was shocked to feel his teeth against his tongue, but then there was a great feeling. Half-blood didn't know you could do it that way. Then his body felt a strong slap on his right cheek. Malfoy started to rub his long foot against Griffindor's calf, sending a shivering chill straight to his nine-inch monstrosity.
Scarhead had a beautifully shaped and slender body with a slightly tanned complexion. His hair, tousled in all directions, added charm to him. Playing Qudditch kept his arms and chest well-muscled, but not overly. Then his eyes met firm cheeks. Slightly muscled thighs made the blonde's pants tight. Malfoy had to stop himself from jumping the table of his house and shagging Griffindor. He blushed all over and unconsciously licked his lips.
- ''Potty, get it to your lovely full mouth. Ahhh.. That's right, Pottaah. Swirl your tongue. OOooh... ''- Brunet perceived it was his chance to lose virginity.
-"Oh yes, Harry ..." - he pulled closer, so that he could take him deeper into his throat. He was surprised that the brunet does it so well. Had he been doing this to someone before? I won't let him go that fast. Malfoy gently stroked his neck.
- "Do you like dementor's kiss?"
- "Dracooo, ohhh, ........ aaahhhhh, give it to me ....." - Draco's thrusts became more and more brutal. He got up from his knees and began to enter the brunet from above at a different angle. Tip registered that he was stabbing at his point. He began to push harder against him to make HIS chosen one feel more painful and more pleasant.
