Draco Malfoy can make a Harry Potter question his sexuality. Harry closed his eyes, imagining how good it would be when Draco finally gave into his arms and begged him. Harry glanced at Draco, and...
His vision was getting darker because the thick leaves in the Olympus forest had covered the moonlight. He had been on that road for thousands of years, so it didn't matter to him. Herion's pace stopped because Ares suddenly saw something and pulled the reins.
"Your Majesty, there is one thing that has been bothering me since Your Majesty's entourage came to this kingdom." The series of sentences that Natalie had just said to Draco managed to gain his attention. "This may sound a little personal, but honestly... I'm curious."
He must meet a mysterious Oracle named Cyllenius, who was strongly suspected of having planned this all on Troya. From there, Draco would force him to explain how to get his soul back to his old perfect life.
Regardless of the politeness he'd maintained so far, Draco hurriedly pulled his face away in a rough motion, so Terence's index finger was no longer touching his chin.
"Lie down," Harry helped straighten the pillows behind Draco, then slowly laid Draco down on the bed.
An arm pushed the door closed and locked Draco's back. He could feel the breath falling on the back of his neck as the man spoke again.
Because of the cold, he didn't want to stay in there for long. Draco drowned himself quickly and rose quickly as well. In that instant, his lips turned pale.
Cedric looked at Draco in surprise for a few seconds because he heard Draco's slightly unreasonable words. "Fine, then, let's just bring it back," Cedric decided when he could see Draco's eyes flashing an intense worry.
Draco could see the vampire's sharp fangs sticking out through her lips. Other people certainly couldn't see the fangs, of course, if the vampire didn't want it. But not for Draco. He could see the immortals who were considered mythology to humans.
Suddenly Draco smelled a burning scent from his phone, and he threw it off spontaneously. Draco turned his gaze to Harry, who just stared at him flatly and then turned his back.
He picked up the passed out blonde lightly and carried him out to his bed, where he proceeded to towel him off. Harry hummed a tune as he did so, admiring the marks he had left on the boy’s pretty skin.
"But what if the Oracle is telling the truth? God Ares' messenger will arrive in three days to get Troya." The King said.
"But... you're not attracted to him, you're attracted to me. That means I'm prettier, right?" asked Arabelle with a happy smile and looking at Harry with hopeful eyes.
"I'll take you later. Right now, there are more important things for you to do, prince of Sparta. Take a shower. You are very messy right now. Today is your first dinner with Ares." Alastair said in a serious tone as if he was preparing Draco to go to war.
"Yeah... If I had a wife as beautiful as Your Majesty Draco, just by looking at his pretty face, I'd be happy." joked the King of the Delion, which was met with a light laugh from Draco.
Draco got out of bed and walked toward the door. As he remembered, last night he was looking around, then his body felt weak and may be passed out? Draco didn't remember. He grabbed the doorknob and opened it.
Harry glanced at the glass Draco had placed on his desk. He knew he was poisoned. Draco was too inexperienced in his first attempt at killing people. His hands were shaking, and his eyes were nervous, repeatedly glancing at the glass. Also, don't forget that ridiculous fake name. Draco didn't even notice that his disguise had been exposed from the start.
"Where do you think you're going?" Harry asked, clearly irritated despite the attention he was paying to Draco's smooth skin. It looked like the predator had come back to play. "I told you I was going to punish you. This was just the beginning, darling."
Draco could bear it all, but not his mother. His mother from childhood used to wallow in wealth, like a princess. Even until she married his father, Lucius used to treat her like a queen, with many servants surrounding his wife. Narcissa was devastated when she was forced to cook by herself with those fragile, unskilled hands — because she had never cooked in her life. And it gets more and more devastated when they get poorer, suffer more. Finally, the suffering was unbearable for his mother. She started getting sick, getting thinner, crying more often on lonely nights. Then one morning, his mother just died.
Natalie clung to the arm belonging to the King of the Delion, who no longer looked so stout. The man's strength had been eaten away by time. Even so, Natalie managed to show everyone that she was a woman who loved her husband, even though Draco knew very well that she had been playing with her stepson behind her husband.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief, removed the blanket that covered him, then tried to get up from his position. But suddenly, as if shaken by the electric shock, a flash of pain ran up his spine, hips, and buttocks, even his knees decided to give up supporting his entire body. Draco groaned in pain and collapsed back powerlessly on the bed.
Draco was surprised at the moment, though he tried not to show it. Maybe for ordinary ancient Greeks, the Titans were just talking about their home in heaven. But for Draco, who lived in the modern era, he also suspected something else. Did they just say that the Titans were an alien race?
"You always challenge me until I have to hold myself to the limit of my patience. Your attitude makes me sick!"
Rumors have been saying that he was secluded and timid. But now Troya knows and laughs with his soldiers at dinner. He was telling jokes that caused laughter without diminishing his princely grace. Ares could see that the palace dwellers liked him. The Prince of Sparta was probably his only lover to receive that treatment. They often hated lovers of the War God, including Aphrodite.
Draco swallowed hard when he heard the price. Who wants to buy a guitar for 250 Pounds Sterling? "Is there anything less than 100 Pounds Sterling?" Draco asked.
Harry frowned at him carefully, then his long fingers suddenly stretched out and pulled Draco's chin closer so that he could observe Draco's face closely. "I've never seen your face here before."
Hermione's husband seemed to love his wife very much. The man looked at Hermione like she was the most beautiful woman in the world.
"Quiet short, but you don't have to worry. Olympus is a lot of fun. If Ares pleases, you can even take a walk to another city. You won't get bored living there," Lasonas responded.
Draco frowned. After thinking for a moment, he thought that this man who claimed to be a lawyer looked convincing. He put down his knife, and he opened the door warily.
The pure white body looks very soft, the long blonde mane that tries to cover him, the two long legs that bend each other as if the owner needs warmth.
But, when Draco kissed Harry, he actually felt the dark atmosphere getting stronger. Draco's vision seemed to be brought to look into a dark, dead, and damaged place. Draco saw a glimpse of a future. The wings of angels were cut and scattered on the ground, the corpses of humans were covered with blood, and the dark sky was bathed in red light.
For whatever reason! Damn the vulgar novel Draco just read! That crazy novel must have affected his brain.
"I thought so too," the woman in the group, in the pink dress, replied in an equally sarcastic voice. "Considering the history of Harry's lovers has always been extraordinarily beautiful. But look at her. She doesn't seem like she belongs here. She definitely isn't a woman of class!"
Pansy turned to Blaise. "Confused that we already know that he likes Potter." Pansy's casual answer took Blaise by surprise again.
"We're about to enter Olympus!" Alastair exclaimed and immediately forced all of them to return to focus on their goal.
"Good night to you too, Your Royal Highness," Draco replied with a gentle smile as he looked at the face of the crown prince of the Delion Kingdom.
"I didn't hear any news about him. He suddenly disappeared like he was swallowed up by the earth, even though some time ago I still met him to discuss some of our cooperation, and now he has disappeared so that our cooperation is canceled. Even the secretary didn't know where he was. The business media didn't give any comments either.”
"What's wrong with you?" asked Harry, whose voice could somehow be heard in Draco's ear while Professor Trelawney's voice was still not heard at all.
Not wanting to waste any more time, Draco bowed respectfully. Harry did the same. Harry was just about to turn around and leave the majestic ballroom, but the annoying voice of the man he had thought of as an enemy made Harry growl in annoyance.
The prince was shocked when he heard that. At that time, he was still observing the atmosphere of Ares palace, which was shady and well lit. After wandering for a long time in the dark forest, his eyes felt comforted.
Draco guessed that Ares' charm was also influenced by his charisma and thousands of years of age. He was more confident, sounded intelligent, and made any mortal creature defeated and small in front of him. Draco was intimidated. He was a real God of War—one of the most powerful entities on the Greek domains today.
"Right now, Athena is often spying on you and looking for your faults. Maybe Zeus will never step down, but you will first lose the title of god because of Athena's trickery. You have to admit that you are not serious enough about your divine duty, Ares. I don't ask much of you. Just do not break Zeus' rules and don't let Athena find any flaw to bring you down." Hera explained again.
Harry was getting ready to visit Draco at the hospital. Early in the morning, he decided to see Draco before he headed to his office. Harry ordered Alden to stop by one of the flower shops and buy Draco a beautiful carnation.
"Because you're enough to meet the criteria of being—disguised—as a Mate. Besides, I've been trying to find someone else to stand with me, and it's not working as I expected." Harry sighed. "And I think inviting someone from the packhouse is easier because people like you are familiar with events like this."
Goddess Hera—the queen was sat half-lying next to her furious husband. She shook her head in concern. When she saw Athena came with a satisfied smile on her face, she immediately guessed that Ares must be doing something wrong.
He’s getting more and more confused. Draco had spent the night in many forests when he went hunting with his husband, but he had never seen such a bluish spot. In fact, Draco was sure that he was also bitten by insects there.
And I wanted to say thank you so much for the kudos and comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you so much for 500+ kudos. This is my first fic that ever reached this milestone.
The maids immediately returned to their individual jobs. They did not want to linger under their master's tantrums any longer. Harry became even more confused by himself. Now his mood was twice as horrendous as before. He becomes very sensitive with anything related to Draco.
Harry grinned even wider. "You get nervous when you're around me. Don't you, Malfoy?" he turned to face Draco.
Harry threw the towel angrily onto the sofa. “In the past two days, you have made your own decision and opposed me twice. Listen to this carefully, Alden,” Harry's voice was deep and menacing. "Once again, you make a fool that troubles me, not only the punches you get, and I will finish you as fast as I can." The threatening voice still echoed in the darkness, like a devil's promise calling for life.
While Cedric was forcing his brain to figure out a way, he accidentally looked at Draco's servant, Glenice, standing right beside the white horse Draco was riding with her head bowed respectfully.
“One more time,” Harry said, both of them were lucid enough now, “I want to fuck you one more time.”
Who wouldn't want this extraordinary handsome man? All women must dream that they can be in his arms. Everyone must imagine what if a mischievous man like Harry behaved gently. Oh, Draco had witnessed it several times instead, and the memory of it made his body heat up. But Draco was a man, so he shouldn't felt that way.
"Wait a minute, Hera! I'm not done talking yet. What I mean is, we're going to give Ares a series of tests. All this time, he had been too negligent in his duties as a god. He had to prove himself that he was still functioning well as a war god. If he fails, then we have to revoke his title," Athena explained.
Draco straightened his face and looked back. He ventured to examine Ares's face. It seemed like what he said was sincere. At least in the near future, his life is not in danger. "Why do you want to marry me?" Draco couldn't help but ask.
After all, Draco had to remain gentle and polite to the man, even though he had openly forced Draco into a relationship these past few days.
Harry turned his head and caught Draco watching his body. His sensual gaze radiated, hot, and passionate. But then he found Draco's eyes circling all over the bathroom.
One day, when Tom is as annoying as the plague that must be put down, Harry himself would take care of him. But not now, maybe Harry's reputation for cruelty made Tom very cautious about his actions. Harry wanted to see how far Tom was moving. Only then did he decide what to do with the trash.
When Draco woke up, the first thing he felt was the tightness in his chest. He writhed in panic, trying to breathe rapidly, trying his hardest to get as much oxygen as possible.
"Of course, I will give it to you. I will give you everything you need. You don't need to ask anymore," said Cedric with his hand that was already outstretched to gently stroke the top of the horse's head.
Draco regretted it later. Did that mean he would never sleep in the same blanket as Ares again? He thought he would be relieved, but surprisingly he was very sorry. He means, spending the night with Ares wasn't bad. If Draco hadn't made a rule of postponing the first night or something—it might have been a good night.
He was like a toy or pet cat of the God of War. But as mere property, he would get luxury and a decent life. Besides, meeting a god face to face was a scarce life experience. The God of War and Draco had now arrived at the door of the prince's room. Ares dropped him off after dinner while taking a walk and getting to know each other.
Harry's face turned into a worried look. The man stepped quickly towards the source of the crying sound as if he didn't care about other people's opinions of his impolite behavior.
"So what if we are both males? Is that a sin? Immortal beings can make anyone their partner, regardless of gender. What became sin is the forbidden relationship between angels and demons. That rule has been expanded extensively between heaven and hell."
Harry seemed to be thinking. He was considering whether to send Draco home or not. Draco knew very well that Harry was going to kill him. But why Draco? Does Harry know that Draco is a demigod? Is this fate? Were they really mean for each other?
But as soon as he remembered Elle's name, it all vanished. Draco didn't know why saying that name made him feel sick and angry. And that made him wonder, who is Elle? Why does Vlad always say her name?
"Forgive me for disturbing Your Majesty and Lady's leisure time, but I would like to speak to Lady Canterbury alone." said the crown prince while staring at Draco's silver eyes that had bewitched him for a while.
The Crown Prince chuckled amusedly when he saw that the husband of his dance partner tonight had hurried out of the ballroom.
The God of War was right. Draco knew nothing about royal family dining etiquette in ancient Greece. That era was still arguably primitive, in contrast to the more modern medieval ages. Maybe dinner activities in the royal family are more flexible than they are today. Draco could see Ares' subordinates eating with them in the same room. They chat, joke and laugh. They ate greedily and devoured all that bland food without any leftovers. Their way through the dinner was messy but fun.
Harry looked at an invitation letter that had been delivered by one of his soldiers with a distant gaze.
Draco was even more confused by Arabelle's words. His eyes that had been staring at Arabelle's long neck also moved to his personal maid, who was currently staring at Draco with unreadable eyes.
"I'm sorry, but it looks like Your Majesty's request will not be granted. I can't have children until I die." Draco's words in his soft voice that managed to make the King of the Delion breathe a sigh of relief, at least, the older man's life wouldn't have been lost if Draco were by Harry's side.
"Who is he?" Draco was amazed to see the painting of a man who was so handsome. The man reminded him of someone he felt had been very close to him. But Draco couldn't remember it.
"No, Troya. I've just been thinking about a lot of weird stuff these past few days. Sorry that I seem to have blown it to you," Ares smiled. He certainly wasn't willing to admit that it was his wife who made him like this.
Alden stared at Harry. There was a surprise in his eyes, even though he immediately put on a flat face in an instant. "I accidentally let him escape,"
"Oh, come on. This pack isn't as large as your study room. Don't think negatively before you try," said Ron. "Well, stop all your activities for now because, during the next session, we will be busy adventuring!"
The King turned to Hector, who had been speaking presumptuously without the King's permission. "Then what about you, Hector? Do you think I'm crazy to let you escort him? You're just like other men. You want Troya! It's possible that you poisoned Troya and planned all this. No, Hector! I won't approve of your plan." The King said firmly and coldly.
Athena smiled at him and chuckled as if disdainfully. "Later, Ares, later. We will meet again in battle soon. This time I will confirm who was worthy of the title of God of War among us," She disappeared after saying that.
Hector did not remain silent while Troya fell sick. He went around many places looking for evidence. He even tried to find Cyllenius, the mysterious Oracle, even though he failed to find him.
Now Draco was even more shocked. As if it was something that the immortal man often did. "Take me home right now! I will never love you!"
"How many times have you been in a relationship with?" Draco wanted to know because Ares seemed convinced and prepared for the worst ending in their relationship. It's as if he has been through it so many times that he now can guess the scenario of all the relationships he's been in.
"Prince Cedric! How can you speak so rudely to a woman?" Harry asked, disapproving of Cedric's words.
The young man looked at the noble couples on the dance floor belonging to his kingdom. His eyes noticed the happy expressions of the noble couples, and for some reason, he also felt happy.
Harry's head shot up as if it had been jerked. He looked at Ron warily. "Oh, yeah?" his tone was relaxed, but the tension in Harry's voice couldn't fool Ron.
A happy smile spread across the face of the King of Delion. "If Your Majesty likes it, I can send it to the Shinia Kingdom. Maybe it will cost a little more—"
When Draco finished his work, it was almost noon. Draco remembered that he had to go to the Bank. Draco hurriedly grabbed his jacket and was about to leave the house when someone knocked on his door. Draco suddenly became alert. He has several close friends. After all, in his disguise at the time for plotting revenge against Harry, no one knew that Draco lived in this tiny house. So, it couldn't be his friend who was visiting.
looks very adorable. His hand moved to brush away some of Arabelle's hair that had fallen over the sides of the girl's face.
Along the way, there was not a single conversation surrounding Harry and Draco. Draco kept his mouth shut as the man riding the horse chose to enter the Delion Kingdom palace through the castle's back door.
Gasping for the adrenaline rush, Draco leaned back against the bathroom door, closed his eyes, unconcerned by Alden's angry pounding on the door.
“This share of the stock, according to the sale and purchase agreement, will be given to you once you are 23 years old,” Alden looked around the bustling surroundings and looked uncomfortable. “Please come with me. I'll explain to you."
Cedric tilted his body and supported his head with his own hands. Cedric looked at Draco from the queen's hair to his toes with a playful look. "Shouldn't I be the one asking that, Your Majesty? What are you doing, hm?" Cedric asked, restraining himself from bursting out into a loud laugh.
Glenice's answer made Draco's eyebrows knit together, "How did you know?" Draco asked, glancing at her.
Draco jumped in shock, listening to the hissing sound, he turned his back and faced Doctor Jason, who was standing still in the shadows. The man smiled, as usual, but his current smile was not a smile as bright as the sun, but a grin of terrifying evil.
With hasty steps to nowhere, Draco suddenly stopped when his eyes caught Harry's figure leaning against the large window. Alone, looking straight up at the sky.
Harry nodded faintly as the man lifted himself up. He stepped in quick motion towards the small house near the guards' training area, a special treatment house for the guards injured while doing the practices.
Draco couldn't help but scream as his horse panicked by the earthquake now galloped off in an unsteady direction—separating himself from the envoys. Then took him to a dark part of Olympus, which was not at all friendly to humans like himself.
Harry looked around disinterestedly, staring at all the women and men who were almost like ants around him, with gazes wishing to be selected.
Sparta's palace was nothing like he had ever imagined. Not as simple as the image shown in the movie 300 or as grand as the medieval castles in the Game of Thrones series. Sparta was a respected kingdom in Greece and was known for the toughness of its warriors. Draco didn't know if the boys here were really trained in martial arts from an early age because he was still reluctant to ask too many questions.
Over there, on one side of the wall was full of pasted photos. And those are not ordinary photos. They are pictures of Harry doing his activities, some of which are Harry, who is with Draco. And seeing Harry's expression over there, it seems that the photos were taken with a hidden camera, without the person's permission in the photo.
"I didn't approach him. He was the one who always appeared and somehow found out where I was. And who the
"I only got paid to be his boyfriend," Draco smiled at the doctor's increasingly surprised face. "I'm sad thinking about my father and mother," he said.
"Just curious, what are you cooking here?" Dion sat beside him. The Titans and Demigods gradually moved elsewhere.
After Harry left, Draco cast a frustrated look at Cedric, who seemed busy wiping the blood flowing from the corner of his lips.
Draco frowned in denial. "But my dad's company was fine before he made a deal with Harry. We're not broke at all!" He remembered the fancy dresses and jewels his father had bought for his mother, the servants who came and went to meet their needs, their luxurious, comfortable houses, cars, and all the other luxuries that his father provided at that time.
"Hmm, I even have a plan crazier than that, more than you can imagine, you will find out later," his eyes fixed on Draco intimately. "But for sure, the tension between us is so intense, and I'm not hypocritical to admit it in front of you, I'm always excited when I see you. I get aroused when I think of you. I want to fuck you all the time..."
His hand then moved to touch the girl’s neck. He wanted to be sure what insect had left that dirty imprint on Arabelle's neck.
She gasped as if she had just realized that her cries might invite the nobles to come to this place. If those gossip-hungry nobles came to that place, Arabelle was sure, the reputations of King Harry and Queen Draco would definitely be disgraced.
Draco tried to recall his life before he got lost in the forest of Olympus and was almost eaten by a wolf. He's an actress, but not an ordinary actor who contributes to extra roles. He started his career as a teenager and had his own drama series on the Disney channel. Now that he was 23 years old, he only appears in feature films and occasionally voices animated films or commercials.
"Your Majesty Draco, what do you do to make your husband happy?" Natalie asked formally as she gave Draco a big smile.
Harry's blush and nervous look disappeared in an instant, replaced by a big goofy smile. Maybe he was too happy that he just kissed Draco on the lips, making Draco's eyes widen.
Draco ushered him in, and he sat watching the man pull out important-looking files from his briefcase.
"Maybe the weather's cleared because the guy who loves you finally has a chance to be alone with you."
Draco was thoughtful in his room, all of Alden's words ringing in his ears over and over again. The story of the beautiful and perfect Seraphina Potter and how much Harry loves her.
"Of course," Draco answered confidently, staring at his reflection in the large mirror in front of him.
"I'll see you later, Luna. I have to work." Draco took his bag and left Luna in the cafe. Harry followed behind him, walking out of the building.
And Harry's fingers touched there, into Draco's tight hole, skillfully playing Draco as he pleased. Draco's body struggled unbearably at the sensation of Harry's fingers, but the man's arms firmly held him. Then Harry's lips followed his fingers.
Cedric didn't know whether he should be happy or sad because he had again managed to become the first person to see Draco's various expressions.
Draco stared straight into Terence's face. The man was very to the point, and more impressively, he said something that sounded personal to a queen who was his royal guest.
A bitter smile replaced Draco's gentle smile. His father will never understand him. His father will keep a close eye on the fact that his son was thirsty for love. His father wanted Draco to be the ideal queen and give him an heir to Shinia Kingdom.
"Stop! Don't come near me!" Draco unconsciously gripped his chest in a protective motion. Harry had forced his volition on him before, the bruise on his hands still aching, the scar of the harsh tie on his wrists.
"Mr. Draco has a high fever and low blood pressure. It seems that it is the result of fatigue. But don't worry, he will be fine. I suggest not allowing him to do strenuous activities and rest for a few days." The senior doctor sighed softly. "If his condition worsens, Mr. Draco must be rushed to the hospital." He added.
Draco bit his lip, which he did out of nervousness. That behavior made Ares triggered and turned his face away. The Prince of Sparta before him, dressed in perfume and a gown of limp silk. The curves of his body were not too pronounced but caused curiosity. His white but not pale skin looks glowing.
Cedric hummed happily inside. Draco was very obedient, and Cedric liked it. This way, he wouldn't have to be afraid if Draco showed another side of himself to others, especially the king.
“You are no substitute for anyone!” Harry interrupted, looking menacing. They stood facing each other, measuring each other's strength.
"Your Majesty can punish me once Draco has received treatment. I will accept my punishment openly without the slightest refusal,"
"Calm yourself, my son. Today we will be with you all night. You must prepare your heart. Tomorrow evening, the envoy of Olympus will pick you up and take you away as the bride of Lord Ares," the king explained again with a tone of despair.
"Harry against it?" Draco imagined a woman with a weak body but capable of challenging the entire world for the sake of the child she was carrying. What a strong and extraordinary woman.
No one dared to help when Draco screamed in Harry's drag. It looks like Harry's anger is commonplace in this house, and no one dares to fight the man. Harry led Draco down the hall to the second-floor glass window that led directly to the balcony.
Water dripped drop by drop and then spilled in great numbers from above the very gloomy sky. In an instant, the drizzle had turned into a small storm.
"Do you think he's ready for me?" Harry put on his black silk robe and sat on the sofa in his room. A full meal was available to him at the table. Calmly, the man took a sip of his wine, then looked at Alden, his personal bodyguard and assistant standing in front of him with his trademark expressionless face.
In fact, Harry had decided to laugh at Draco in secret, pretending to drink the poisoned drink. But those lush lips and Draco's incredibly sexy appearance brought out a demonic side in him, a thirsty devil side. Maybe it's time this pretty boy received a lesson for his recklessness.
“Sir,” Seamus interrupted, ready to leave the house. "I'm just relaying what I've been assigned. If you have any questions, maybe you can contact Harry directly." And Seamus left, leaving Draco still dumbfounded and confused, looking at the files in front of him.
Everyone knew exactly what Arabelle's position was in this palace. She was the mistress of their own king. Everyone also knew very well that the king had always spoiled Arabelle. Still, they couldn't understand. How could the girl run around and smile happily like that?
Everything feels so empty. Draco's feeling is drained. It hurt so much that his heart started to numb.
"I was in the mood to eat out, and you..." Harry studied Draco with a 'watch out if you dare to argue' look. "You are my lover, so you must accompany me."
Ares wasn't a god with a character who cared about culture, let alone the constellations of stars. The Titans built a stargazing tower because of its high enough location and perfect for observing the sky.
Draco slammed the door to find Harry and Icarus wrestling on the floor, locking each other up. Draco approached them and tried to intervene, but it was tough to separate them.
Wait. Not necessarily immortal, right? Like werewolves, they are not immortal. But Draco still called them immortal. Yes, at least Harry
Quickly, Draco rose from his seat. He immediately bowed for a longer time than usual, a sign that he was expressing his apology.
"Yes, Ares. You have a chance. You are the only child I gave birth to from my relationship with Zeus. If indeed one of Zeus' children will take his place, I hope it will be you." Hera said seriously.
Draco ran until he almost fell on the floor twice. The people stared at him as he passed them. Draco didn't care because he had to stop a fight of strange creatures that shouldn't be his business. But it became Draco's business because one of them tried to connect himself with them. What a pain in the ass.
Draco turned his head toward the source of the sound, and so was Harry. "Ah, you…" he said. "Sorry, I forgot your name," Draco chuckled nervously.
Glenice pursed her lips. As usual, she couldn't fight Draco. Until accidentally, both of Glenice's eyes stared at the garden, which was already far away from them. Glenice's eyes narrowed at the crazy sight.
Feeling desperate, Draco sat up, hugging his knees. In this case, how can he get out of this house? Meanwhile, he could not even leave this room. His eyes glanced at the bedroom door. The locked door was the only way. But the only ones who could go in and out of the door were only Harry, and also a cold-looking man named Alden, who was always beside Harry every chance he got. The cold-looking man seemed to be assigned to deliver the food.
Draco turned his head, looking for the source of the unfamiliar voice that had answered Alastair's words. A young man who looked the same age as Ares walked up to Alastair with a leather bag hanging from his waist. He had blonde hair and carried a bow and arrow. His appearance was exquisite, in contrast to most of the men in Ares Palace, who were dominated by muscle and battle.
Without realizing it, tears had poured out and flooded Draco's lids. He sobbed, and his mother turned her head, staring at him in confusion. "Are you crying?" she asked.
And what made Draco more devastated was that Harry opened his heart back to her and instead made Draco his number two.
All of this is because Draco is a descendant of Demigod. His mother, Narcissa, is a human, while his father is a god. Yet, Draco did not know who his birth father was. What kind of god would leave his wife when she was pregnant? At first, Draco didn't believe his mother because Narcissa didn't want to say who his father was. But all of that explained how Draco could see these immortal creatures.
The King of Delion could only sigh tiredly, but a smile was evident on his old face. He liked the spoiled behavior Natalie had on him. The spoiled behavior made him feel like he was back in his youth.
When Harry was already in the small house, the noise made by the people there greeted him. For some reason, worry began to fill the king.
Perhaps, Harry thought Draco wanted to steal his expensive books instead. What an arrogant bastard. But Harry's invitation to read a book in the same room felt so intriguing. And Harry had clearly tested him, realizing how much sexual tension between them, and forcing Draco to show himself whether to be cowardly or dare to face Harry.
Even after he got into a relationship with Blaise Zabini, one of his close friends, he still couldn't get over his feelings for his first love.
Harry positioned himself so precisely as if he had known every inch of Draco's body. And Draco felt Harry's hot, hard body merge with his, giving a tantrum of pleasure that grew even deeper.
Even though Harry had made it clear to himself that he would never think dirty about Draco, but when the man saw his wife naked with a sad face, Harry's crazy brain rebelled. Harry desperately wanted to take Draco's innocent-looking body shaking and warm him in his way.
He continued to gently stroke the top of the horse's head until his two senses of hearing caught the footsteps of someone who seemed to be approaching him. As best he could, Draco kept himself calm and acted as if he didn't know the sound of the footsteps.
Tom Riddle is one of Harry's business enemies. The man was hypocritical because, in front of Harry, he was always kind and friendly. But Harry knows that the man has an intense hatred for him because his business is getting worse due to Harry's expansion.
He turns around, and he found Cedric's eyes staring at him with admiration. Come to think of it, since when didn't that guy give Draco an adoring look?
Harry fell silent. He seemed to be considering. "All right, you have ten days." then he disappears in the blink of an eye, and Draco is back on the road just as he wants to cross.
With a laugh still escaping from his mouth, Cedric rose from his position. It seemed that the other man wanted to leave Draco's room.
Draco just shook his head, unable to answer. The memory of the incident in the bathroom had mixed feelings. By the way, as promised, Harry was just taking a shower. After Draco finished soaping his back, Harry continued to bathe and then, with a presumptuous look, offered to wash Draco — which, of course, Draco refused him outright with a bunch of swearing that exploded from his lips.
Draco let out a choked gasp, his head hitting the tiled wall harshly. His pants and cries filled up the room as Harry continued probing his prostate sadistically. Without warning, Draco came again, his legs trembling. If it weren’t for Harry supporting him, he would have fallen. Not discouraged, Harry continued to plunder Draco’s prostate with his finger and tongue.
The King contemplated on his throne, which was ornately in gilded corners. He scratched his chin in thought. The King has acted quite selfishly today. He held a special meeting to discuss the fate of his son and gathered all the advisers and wise men he trusted.
Draco groaned. He could hear Harry’s breath above him, could feel Harry’s fingers digging into the flesh of his thighs, could feel the movement of the man’s cock inside of him. As Darco slowly came back to earth, his hand unconsciously moved to his cock, not surprised that he was hard again even though he had come so many times. He moaned as he felt Harry hitting his sweet spots; the feeling felt fresh again after he took some rest.
Draco never interacted with Alden again after yesterday's cases, and it doesn't seem like the man intends to talk to him either. Besides, Draco's guilt was too big. Because of him, Harry beat Alden. The beating marks are still there from the bruises on Alden's face and a broken nose.
Draco becomes tempted by Harry's offer. No, not tempted to be Harry's lover. But tempted by the promise that Harry would not treat him as a prisoner, which meant loosening the tight security that had guarded him.
Harry brought his mouth down to bite Draco’s neck, drawing out an aroused cry as he broke the skin for the umpteenth time. Draco shook at the feeling. He didn’t know if he had ever wanted to come so badly after his previous tenth orgasms. He attempted to grind his neglected erection against the tiled wall, but Harry growled and squeezed his arms to keep him in place.
If you can speak French or genuine French, feel free to correct me about French food if I made a mistake :)
"No. But that sounds unfair, you're so obsessed with everything I have, and I allow it, but why don't you let me obsess over what you have?" Cedric asked and looked at Draco with an indescribable look.
But again, Draco had to finish his breakfast somehow because he needed energy from last night's activities. Remembering what happened last night, Draco's cheeks started to warm up and creep up to his ears. A maid came into his room to clean up the empty plates and glasses.
"I'm just curious. You must know that His Majesty is crowned the most beautiful in this whole kingdom.”
Draco thought to himself. He was fighting for his life, and this man was sitting here laughing at him instead. But was it really Harry who jumped into the pool at that time and saved him? Why? Wasn't it obvious in his anger that Harry had decided to kill him? Why did that man change his mind?
Draco started to feed the food into his mouth. "I don't have blood for you guys, sorry…" he finally made a voice as they continued to stare at him.
Accepting fate as the bride of Olympus sounded more intriguing to his ears. At least he had a chance to find out how his soul got lost in the past and find a way back. He sighed, reminiscing about his perfect life as Draco Malfoy he had left behind. As long as he doesn't know how to go back to his time, all Draco can do now as an actor is to act reasonably in order to portray Troya perfectly.
Draco made his signature rosemary roast chicken. The prince was assisted by several Satyrs who had been busy catching dozens of wild chickens and slaughtering them since this morning. Draco seasoned the chickens with spices and sea salt, then roast them in a traditional stone oven with lemon, onion, and a handful of Mediterranean herbs. Draco served it with spiced mashed potatoes. The residents of Ares' palace were not used to chicken dishes. They usually eat red meat such as deer, wild boar, or beef.
"What are you doing here, Prince Cedric?" Draco asked, furrowing his brows when he saw his brother-in-law's handsome face not far in front of him.
Arabelle's small hand gripped Harry's large palm tightly. She tried to get up with all her might, but unfortunately, the girl shook violently and felt that her legs could no longer support her body.
"Why are you that stupid, huh?!" Harry's voice sounded calm, but the intensity of his anger made the hairs of two of his men stand up.
"Don't worry, Harry," Ginny put her hand on the collar of Harry's shirt, "That ugly woman won't be able to satisfy you, better let me accompany — ouch!!" Ginny shrieked in pain because Harry grabbed her hand that was in his collar. Harry's fingers gripped her hand with less than half force, hurting her until it felt like they were stabbing into the bone.
"Which restaurant? There are lots of restaurants here." Harry walked off to where his car was parked.
Shortly thereafter, the movement of Harry's hips began to become abrupt and irregular. The mattress continued to squeak beneath them. However, when the sound grew stilted with each of Harry's jerky thrusts, Draco became aware that the older man was getting close to his release.
Narcissa raised an eyebrow. "As you wish, my prince. You will soon have your breakfast." Her mother is now becoming childish.
Harry James Potter… Draco thought he knew him very well. Everything about Harry, Draco thought he was perfect until he had to repeat the mistake and fall into the same hole a second time.
After the second class finished, Draco went quickly to the bookstore where he worked. Mr. Flitwick talked to someone in the corner of the room when he entered and glanced at the books that had just arrived. There are several new titles that he hasn't read, and from the synopsis he saw, it feels like the book is quite interesting to read.
This was their first dinner. It was also their first official meeting as a couple. Ares chose his palace hall, whose floors were covered in shiny marble, as their banquet area. The God of War told the satyr to place a long table made of shiny volcanic rock. Draco sat there next to his husband, who occasionally looked at his wife curiously.
"No, it's impossible..." Draco immediately denied while laughing disdainfully. But this time, there was doubt in his words. Did God Ares really exist? Then Draco was dealing with a real god now?
"You look sad," The sound made Draco jump. He turned his head to find Doctor Jason standing at the door, staring at him anxiously. "Are you okay?"
If this were all just a setting, the producers would have gone crazy. First, he will make his company went bankrupt. Second, they had broken the law by doing all that to him. Kidnapping and drugging and the application of plastic surgery without consent. All of that was enough to keep them imprisoned for a long time. Moreover, just for a prank event, that was not how much profit. That doesn't make any sense at all.
"Sorry, I don't have time to play with your people. I won't be more than a hundred years old if I am lucky, unlike you who have lived thousands of years. So, I have no interest in playing your game." Draco walked again and ignored the man.
Draco still remembered standing next to his father, who froze at his mother's skinny and pale face. Her expression was asleep, and he felt sad at the realization that his mother was probably happier now that she had passed away. After the death of his mother, his father was devastated and destroyed.
Harry was thoughtful. Seven days and Draco is in a pretty dangerous public area. His brain was spinning over what kind of security he should implement to protect Draco. Tom was still on the chase, and Hyde was somewhere, still eyeing them. Harry needed to be extra careful with Draco.
"It wasn't this bright earlier..." Draco grumbled as he used his hand to block the sunlight from hitting his eyes.
"Are you serious?" Ares chuckles. "Why? Do you care if I love another human? This is not like you, Aphrodite," He continued.
Harry entered the house furiously. Alden and the others had surrounded the white villa. The villa was quiet and lonely as if no one was there. Then Harry's eyes turned to the door at the end of the hall, which was half open, and stepped out of it, then entered in a rage when he saw what was happening there.
"I'm currently wearing the royal crown. I won't let my head down with this crown on my head," Draco said calmly.
Draco followed Pansy's index finger and found Potter having breakfast with the other Gryffindor kids. "Then?"
Draco realized that there was now a thick forest with towering pines and a wide enough path to enter in front of him.
A frown of displeasure appeared faintly on Harry's forehead when he heard the answer. For some reason, Harry's anger was boiling when he heard that answer.
"Right now, I'm feeling better. I can't possibly miss the royal agenda." Draco replied, made Arabelle purse her lips, and nod in understanding.
"Did Your Royal Highness just see something funny?" Draco asked as he caught the crown prince's amusement.
Draco smiled shyly. Really, he was so happy now. Draco pecked Harry's lips briefly, making the glasses boy excited. "Then what do you want now?"
Professor Trelawney took out her book. "I can't say your answer is wrong or right because it all depends on your beliefs. Then what if the angels and demons had children? What would they look like?"
The Goddess of Beauty didn't care, even though she knew Ares was in another relationship. Ares was her, her property, and her allies. There was a kind of unwritten contract that made Ares almost always powerless to refuse her. That's why he always told his lovers that they should be ready to see him spend the night with Aphrodite and share him.
"I've been waiting for you, My Lady..." the man kissed the back of Draco's hand. "So long." He continued.
"Maybe he's just waiting until dinner is made. He's probably worried about what people will say if he divorces me too soon,"
He clearly could not persuade the messengers with the gold in his pocket was not much. Because if they wanted to, they could just steal the war god's gift and run away. In addition, the tame vultures he had met yesterday were also with them. That was one thing that was unique about the messengers. They brought Ares’ bird.
"Don't you feel lucky little boy? You can be in the same room with the main gods of Olympus like us, Ares and I Aphrodite. Then there is Eros, our son, the God of Love. Now you're even having a friendly chat with Dionysius," Aphrodite greeted Draco. She took Ares to their table because she was interested in the interaction between the two of them.
Draco sank further through the forest, the only shortcut to the main road, although the risk was that if he wasn't careful, he would fall into a fairly deep ravine.
"Elle, she was my wife," Vlad said suddenly, reading Draco's mind. "She has a face that looks a lot like you."
Harry walks into Draco's treatment room at midnight. By then, Draco was fast asleep. Harry made his way to the edge of Draco's bed with slow, silent steps and stood near the bed and watched Draco. So peaceful this young man was doze in his sleep as if he did not realize that now a great danger was lurking around him.
"Draco... trust me, we'll be fine. We just need to take it slow without anyone knowing, that's all."
The now gigantic vulture shrieked again and arrogantly flapped its wings, creating a strong gust of gust that knocked down many things around it. It then flew back to Alastair and stood beside him with a look ready to hunt.
Another surprise. Draco didn't like that he had to owe his life to that demonic man. But somehow, the feeling that Harry's blood was running through his veins made his chest rippled with a strange feeling, as if a part of Harry was now inside his body, inside him.
All the guards who were right there on guard bowed their bodies without daring to look at Harry as the man walked right in front of them. Well, that was indeed one of the royal regulations that have been implemented since this kingdom was formed.
Spontaneously Draco became nervous. He didn't want to see Harry for a while. Just looking at his face, Draco wanted to throw up. "No need. I just felt a little dizzy and nauseated, maybe because I ate late. I'm sure that by resting for a while, my dizziness and nausea will get better soon." He said with a convincing tone.
Was Potter worried about him? Impossible! That man was just concerned because Draco was someone with the same face as the wife he loved, someone he hoped would replace his wife.
The man with white long hair looked at Draco's arrival with his usual bored stare as if the older man wasn't looking forward to Draco's arrival. Only God knows if that man always sent letters to Draco asking Draco to visit him.
For a moment, Draco forgot his frustration at Harry's coercion and lost himself in fascination with the beauty of the dress on his body. Harry watched Draco for a moment in a beautiful dress. Draco looked like a forest goddess descended from heaven, extraordinarily beautiful.
"No, they're expensive. I'm not sure you'll take care of them and not damage them." Harry's words seem to offend Draco.
Draco had always loved the planetarium during his school days. It was one of those places where he could lay down, looking up at the ceiling and watch the stars move and the fantastic and lifelike animations of the sky. He didn't feel sleepy even though the narrator explained it in a flat tone. To be honest, he wasn't listening either, and he was just interested in the projection. He was busy from a young age and felt he found peace there even though he was there for his science assignment.
When he reached the gate, Draco took a deep breath to grab the iron and climb over it. The burning scent started to be emitted when he had just raised one leg. Though, Draco was still able to hold on to it and continued climbing. When his two feet had climbed onto the gate, his body seemed to resist, and his body was thrown back away.
After all, she was married off by Zeus by force. Zeus worries that the Gods were scrambling to marry her and create war. He eventually forced Aphrodite to marry Hephaestus, the disabled blacksmith god. Why Hephaestus? Why didn't he marry Aphrodite to another child like Ares? Even though Ares was known as a loser on Olympus, Ares was still better as a lover than Hephaestus.
Draco was just pensive, trying to absorb Alden's words as best he could. Was Alden lying? But the other man seemed straight and honest. Draco just couldn't accept the image he had of his father had just shattered. If what Alden said was the truth, Draco would have to accept that his life with his father in a fairy tale was mainly a lie.
"My goal is not to apply for a job," Draco was starting to feel irritated at the receptionist's disdainful stare. "Please arrange my meeting with Mr. Potter,"
"Draco," called out a voice Draco believed was not Harry's. If not Harry, it means the other one — Icarus. Yeah, who else was bothering him beside the two of them.
Maybe if he peeks a little at what the food… No! Draco scolded himself inwardly. He would not eat. It would be better for him to starve than to have to surrender to Harry's rule. But if he drinks, it may be okay. Draco glanced thirstily at the drink on the tray. Fresh orange juice that looks so tasty.
The sun was scorching too hot today until Draco felt the ground he was stepping on was a rock that Vesuvius had just spewed out. Luckily his soft soles and heels were protected by wild cowhide footwear, so he still feels comfortable. It's just that it's a little difficult for him to find shelter because the Sparta palace was a little dehydrated. But he was hesitant to go inside because the air was like in a sauna room.
Ares didn't answer right away. His hand touched his young wife's chin and looked at him intently as if he was observing him. Draco felt uncomfortable staring that close. His mind immediately reminisced a while ago where they kissed for the first time. Draco's cheeks now were turning red without him being able to stop it.
Draco tried not to be afraid. But his mind was getting more and more confused because he saw the man's eyes that seemed to be hypnotizing. "I'll let you know the fact that I can't love you," he declared, and he began to approach Harry.
, Draco muttered to himself. Feeling annoyed because he couldn't help but admit the truth that was plastered in front of him.
Draco stayed silent. He didn't know what cruel thing he wanted to say to Cedric so he could understand that the love he gave to Draco would be in vain. Draco remained sitting where he was when he saw Cedric taking quick steps to leave his room.
Humans since prehistoric times have made stars as directions and even worshiped them. The sailors saw the stars to return to the mainland. Slowly they saw patterns and formulated constellations and created astrology. The stars became very important in human civilization.
Was this some kind of prank on television? The producer was outrageous for making jokes like this. After all, he was Draco Malfoy—a popular actor whose name was nominated for an Oscar yesterday! Draco, who was furious, promised to sue the producers, including his manager, who let this happen to him. Draco might still be able to tolerate ordinary pranks like being in a hidden camera magic show. But they even knocked him out and maybe even poisoned him to the point that he had difficulty moving his body.
Draco was a little taken aback when he met Hadreda. She has a beautiful red mane and serene blue eyes. There were spots around her nose that gave a sweet impression. Her thin jaw gave the impression of being firm and wise, but the look in her eyes showed a friendliness.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco beckoned Glenice for her to follow. Because Glenice was following him on foot, he couldn't bear to rush his horse. Not far in front of him, he saw Cedric stop his horse. It seemed the man was deliberately waiting for Draco.
Armageddon or Harmagedon usually refers to the end of the world's prophecy or the apocalypse due to the great war. In this story, Armageddon is a prophecy of the apocalypse caused by the war between angels and demons.
"Sshhh... You're going to hurt your arm if you keep struggling like that," Harry's lips crept up and landed on Draco's.
"By Athena! Prince Troya! Aren't you afraid of being cursed by the gods?" The servant also presumptuously tried to stop Draco from speaking.
When he looked at Draco's face, the man's eyes immediately fell on his silver eyes, which looked very sad. It seemed his wife had lost a lot of blood.
A rule required all commoners not to make eye contact with the Emperor and his family when they were not on a special occasion.
"Did Your Majesty not catch what Arabelle just said? Arabelle would definitely feel bad if she showed her legs to someone else—"
"Icarus? An angel who died from flying too close to the sun?" Draco tried to bring it up with the mythological history he knew.
After several hours of awkwardness, Draco finally reunited with Alastair and the other envoys. Draco, Ares, and their horse entered the palace of the war god, which was not what Draco had imagined before. The messengers greeted Ares in a half-bowed gesture. Their heads bowed in regret. Ares helped the prince get off his horse then saw them.
"His fault for not trying harder for me. I'm Aphrodite, the Goddess of Beauty that everyone worships. Hephaestus should have put in a little effort to make me like him," grunted Aphrodite.
Draco gritted his teeth. He desperately wanted to fight his father, but he realized that he would lose his position as queen if he kept fighting. Not only would he lose his position, but Draco would also lose the love of his people.
Draco begins to remember the moment he touched Harry for the first time. He saw a wing on his back and at the same time a horn on his head. "Is he half-demon and half-angel?" He asked Luna.
Draco turned pale. Shouldn't he have said it? He had remembered that the envoys had said there was no need to tell Ares about the betrayal of the king of Sparta. "That—" Draco thought evasively.
"Mr. Draco doesn't want me to report it to you, master. Mr. Draco said that he felt just a little dizzy and nauseous, and he would feel better if he had rested for a while…” said the maid in a frightened tone, her body suddenly stiffened as her master's face grew darker.
"The followers of Ares visited the palace of Sparta and brought their prince to Olympus," Athena confirmed once again. The Goddess of Wisdom stood before her father and looked at him confidently. At that time, she wore an ivory white dress that gave a graceful impression, but a formidable aura still radiated from her beautiful self.
The Prince of Sparta was both revered and hated. He was born very beautiful when compared to his sisters. The Spartans were stern and serious, but Troya looked like a Goddess. Moreover, his hair was blonde and beautiful. Not many Greeks have blonde hair. When he was born to a black-haired father and a brown-haired mother, rumors about the queen had an affair were heard. But when the king carried little Troya in his arms—he didn't care about any of that.
Can he escape from here? Draco wanted to scream in panic, or should he just kill himself? But Draco was certain Harry wouldn't let him. Oh, with Harry's ruthlessness, he might let Draco die, but he'll make sure Draco suffers before that happens.
"Draco," Harry called out to Draco with great emphasis, making Draco finally want to look him in the eye.
"This is my lover's room," Harry finished Draco's sentence calmly. "Yes. You're my lover, Draco. You must accept that. You are here to satisfy my lust."
A delicate frown then graced Cedric's forehead at the refusal. His brain was thinking fast; he was looking for a way so he could take Draco to his favorite place without having to make his husband angry again.
"Ah, I know! I have a brilliant idea," said Ron excitedly for three seconds, but then he fell silent again and shook his head as he reconsidered the idea he was about to convey.
"I heard your screams." He hissed in anger that he had been holding back for a long time. "And I won't apologize about that."
Cedric raised his eyebrows high when he heard the words Draco had just said. While he saw the fire of sincerity burning fiercely in Draco's eyes, he realized that Draco wasn't playing games right now.
The problem was that the Gods of Olympus didn't seem to know what self-respect and decency were. Especially for matters relating to love and marriage. It was useless if Draco made a fuss because they wouldn't care. Draco decides to accept the unfair relationship between Aphrodite and Ares and act casually so that the God of War would not easily throw him away.
Then in a flash of lightning, Doctor Jason raised the knife, then made a stabbing motion to stab Draco's neck. Draco closed his eyes, waiting for the seconds of his death. But then he felt no pain. Is it true that death doesn't hurt?
Hermione looked at Draco again and smiled. "You are the only 'woman' he has been invited to stay in his house and didn't even go out until now. They all feel jealous because what you are going through is their dream, living with the most wanted bachelor here."
“You need my cock inside you, don’t you? After going through a few orgasms, you're still able to harden, huh? How pervert.” Harry purred, content patience settling on his face.
All need sacrifice. Draco realized that revenge took great sacrifice. Like when he had to dress up as a cheap woman in a mini skirt and sexy clothes. Sometimes night after night, he had to endure the torment of the noise and frenetic music, or he had to endure because of the many flirtatious men always thought he was a cheap woman to buy.
Harry twirled Draco's body. He couldn't possibly keep his wife dancing with him. In any case, when they weren't in Shinia, Harry couldn't break the royal rules at will, even though technically, Harry had already broken some of them.
"Prince of Sparta, there's no need to think so complicatedly. Be happy with the life I gave you. You should be proud because you will be the first human I marry."
"Anyway, shut up. Don't talk about it at all," Draco ordered. He may have been being cheeky, but he's Ares' wife. He thought he could take the lead here a bit.
Draco never felt jealous or angry when he saw Harry, his legal husband, alone with his mistress, and it made Draco's image as a queen with a heart as big as the ocean be praised constantly.
With a sudden movement, Cedric pulled Draco's hand so he could enter his room. Of course, Draco was surprised because Cedric's actions could invite suspicion from anyone who saw it.
While running, Draco occasionally looked back to see if the werewolf were still chasing him. And, of course, he's still after Draco. Draco could also see Harry, who was standing at the end of the road. He saw the werewolf too. As the werewolf gets close to Harry, he makes a net of fire. The werewolf kept running, and the moment he broke through the net of fire, he disappeared.
Harry put his eggs on the kitchen table, then he stood facing Draco and saw Draco's face burning with angry flames. Then Harry started walking toward Draco, his green eyes suddenly turning dark black. A dark aura rose from him. Now his black eyes stared at Draco, intimidated.
"Yes, prince Troya. How are you going to punish them? They've failed to protect you." Ares confirmed.
Ron's expression brightened slightly. "You must have received an invitation from Hufflepuff, haven't you? I'm here to confirm whether or not you want to come to the event tomorrow night."
"You're not safe here, Draco." Harry ruffled his hair in frustration. "No one has ever seen Hyde, and no one knows whether he's men or women. He can be anyone. Even now, I can't trust my own bodyguards, except Alden. Your situation here is very risky. In my house, you will be safe." Harry watched Draco pensively. "I think you're healthy enough to go home. Tonight I'll take care of your return from this hospital."
"My son, are you awake? How's your head?" The man in the armor he'd last seen asked worriedly. Draco didn't answer right away. It might be better if he just followed their scenario. Draco guessed that the dashing man was playing his father. Beside him was a beautiful woman who seemed to play his mother.
Draco's jaw dropped. "Are you crazy?! If you want me to look like a woman, why don't you just find a real woman, not me!" Draco spat out angrily. His pride felt abused as a man.
This morning Harry was usually off to work at this hour. Draco decided to pass his time by exploring the entire house. He decided to explore the right-wing area of the large house. A week had passed since a high fever had knocked him, leaving him helpless and unable to do anything.
Bullshit. Draco knew she was the girl who had rejected Harry in the past. When Harry was already Draco's, the girl came back to get Harry back, whatever the purpose.
Draco bit his lower lip which was starting to tremble. Did Draco have to give it a chance? Draco didn't want to be a hypocrite either. He wanted to feel the thing called
"Your majesty, are you really going to fight Prince Cedric?" Glenice asked worriedly as she folded Draco's hair up high so the soft mane wouldn't get in his way when he fought later.
Ugh! Draco really wanted that sword! He clutched his two satin gloves when he saw Cedric had started to fight the last guard to win the preliminaries. The sound of swords clashing so beautifully made Draco's amazement soar even more.
The woman pointed to a place close to the altar of worship. "One of the oracles found you there just as dawn had just risen. I don't know why you went to the temple when it was dark. Your body was as cold as death when I touched you." The female oracle explained.
"We've managed to track the car," Alden came breathlessly, approaching Harry, who was waiting while pacing nervously in his room.
"Have you forgotten that hurting the wife of a king is strictly forbidden? You could be sentenced to death by beheading for your actions," declared Harry coldly as he shifted his gaze from Draco's droopy eyes to Cedric's face.
It was one of Ares' duties as a god. He had to prevent the monsters from running amok in human settlements. Olympus kept the monsters to repel and frighten humans. But there's always something out of control. Humans remember the monsters in legend, like the nine-headed serpent monster named Hydra, who Hercules fought, or the Cyclops in the story of Jason and the Argonauts.
"Take care of him," Harry didn't look at Draco anymore. The man immediately walked out and slammed the door behind him, angrily.
Draco lay on his back as he felt mischievous fingers dance over his naked body. In the middle of the dim room lit only by candlelight, Draco couldn't see the figure squeezing him over the bed. The man's big hands are pressed against his chest, moving in circles, squeezing and sometimes twisting his nipples. While his head, he buried it in the recesses of Draco's neck.
Draco glanced at the guitar the shop owner pointed at. Draco tried to play the strings and touched them gently. "I'll take this one,"
Instead of being angry, Ares was disappointed in himself. The young man, being obedient and sweet from the first time they met. Ares thought he could understand him. He thought he had read his attitude and knew how to control his heart.
Cedric was startled by Draco's sudden shout, it was the first time Draco had shouted, and his shout was aimed at Cedric. He didn't know if he should be disappointed or happy because he had placed first in Draco's life once again.
And with all this, Draco thought for a moment, could he survive without Harry by his side like he used to do?
Ron sat quietly and took a sip of coffee, his eyes still on the door Harry had disappeared behind. Harry's behavior reminded him of his old self. A smile appeared on Ron's lips. Harry might have gone through the same thing as himself if he hadn't been careful of Draco.
He's still scared. This was all too strange for him. He's definitely not Troya, yet everyone calls him
Did Harry really think of Draco as his lover? Draco's cheeks flushed at the thought. Was all of Harry's kindness purely driven by desire? Draco should have felt insulted, but no, his feelings were warm without him noticing. He shouldn't feel this way.
Draco felt his eyes become heavy, and he couldn't feel his body from the waist down. The last thing Draco remembered was a hand reaching to him, and then he was knocked unconscious afterward.
Charles proudly led Draco to the center of the dance floor. He seemed to want to show off his victory because he had successfully brought the number one person in this kingdom down from his throne and spent his dance with Charles.
"I didn't do anything. You tried to injure yourself by climbing the gate, do you remember?" Harry took out a box of his egg supply.
It would be a lie if Draco said he wasn't depressed. He's heartbroken. He cried for a long time, not knowing whom to hold on to because only Harry had his heart, and he had him lean on it at that time.
Draco briefly heard Greyson take a sharp breath before the man speaking again. "So... You two are a thing?"
Draco breathed a sigh of relief when he managed to hear Cedric's apology. That means the guy has given up on chasing Draco, right?
Ares stopped and turned his head for a moment. He didn't feel sympathetic at all. He was just amazed to know that a Satyr dared to call his name like that.
Showing off to each other in informal events like this has become an open secret that can't be doubted. The nobles will wear the latest luxury clothes from famous fashion designers. They will gather and form their own association as a place to show off each other.
"Ah... Is His Majesty Draco going too?" asked Arabelle. She wrapped his arm around Harry's forearm, watched Draco walk gracefully toward them with Cedric beside him.
Draco's doctors and nurses turned their heads in unison and were a little stunned when they realized that at the door to the emergency room stood the figure of an extremely handsome man, wearing a white shirt covered in blood and looking so angry.
Draco glanced at Luna and then glanced at Harry. Someone raised their hand, and Professor Trelawney invited the person to speak.
She knelt, trying to make her eyes meet one of the messengers. She hoped that the envoys would feel her sincerity and refrain from reporting Sparta to Ares. If the king was a little wiser, he should have chosen to be safe. No matter how dear he was to Troya—still nothing compared to the curse from Olympus.
Cedric clenched his jaw. Quickly, the man took wide strides toward Draco. "I will never tire, Draco, because this is my fight for my love." Cedric looked at him with a frustrated look.
Since Draco was born as the only descendant of the Malfoy Royal family, Draco was destined to marry and become the queen of the Shinia Kingdom. Draco's father had neatly arranged everything. Of course, Draco, who was obedient, wouldn't refuse it because his father always said that it was for Draco's own good.
"Thank you, Glenice. Don't forget to take my clothes back to my room without anyone knowing. I don't want the nobles to look down on me." Draco glanced down at his luxurious clothes piled up like a pile of junk on the hay.
After making sure Draco wouldn't switch sleeping positions again, he instantly moved his feet towards a large cupboard at the end of the room. He opened the wooden cupboard engraved with gold ornaments. His hand reached out for one of the neatly arranged scarves in the closet.
"Oh, of course, I can. If you don't know, I am the owner of this hospital." Harry chuckled in amusement at Draco's surprise.
"Your father seemed to have been very desperate before asking master Harry for help. Hope you understand,” Alden sighed. "You are the only treasure he has that he can offer to master Harry, considering that master Harry's reputation as a
Draco swallowed hard, sitting nervously on his bed. He smiled as he occasionally brushed his long, flowing hair. He should have forbid the god from entering his room, but he was the God of War! Ares’ character was hard to predict. He could have been angry at being rejected and killed.
"We're discussing whether or not it's true that I'm dealing with the God of War! That's why the only way is to prove it! Three more days is the time. I've decided to confirm it by way of war. I think God Ares would like that instead. Let's say we have a party welcome in the way Ares likes best." The King gave an order.
Draco turned his head, wanting to know what had so caught Daphne's attention, and once again, he was blown away. In Daphne's hand, hanging on an elegant coat hanger, was an extraordinarily beautiful dress.
He sat on a long bench covered with goose-down cushions in a patterned cloth. It was night. He lit a candle in his room. Other than that, the sky was clear enough that Draco could clearly see his beautiful physique. Ares was too perfect. He must have used thousands of years of his age to take care of his appearance.
"Toy, you say?" Harry took a step forward, and Draco automatically stepped back. “You wear that dress, or I'll rape you right now on the floor, so you know how I treat my toy!"
Draco could see Cedric was staring at him with a... longing, maybe? The man's gaze didn't move an inch from Draco's beautiful face.
Draco wasn't the type to spend money on unnecessary things. But lately, he really wanted a guitar. He can play the guitar because Luna taught him. Luna taught Draco until he could play it so well, and also Luna said that the fairies really liked the singing and the sound of the guitar.
They had all only been a few kilometers into Olympus when the ground around them suddenly shook violently. Draco even swore at the sight of the ground in front of him rolling like ripples of a river. Several trees appear to have fallen due to the earthquake. Their horses panicked, and Attica fell to the ground.
"I can't, Draco! I can't!" shouted Cedric while shaking Draco's arms so hard with the enormous power.
After all, at this point, Arabelle was the only one who wasn't full of deceit in this kingdom. Draco didn't want to lose a friend like her.
The boy was nervous. For the first time in his life, he felt his chastity was threatened. One thing Troya had in common with Draco was a man had never touched them. Troya was probably purer than Draco because of his protective father. Draco had kissed or let some of the guys he dated touched him a bit, but it never ends in bed.
There was a moment of silence, then Harry sighed. "Get some rest. If you need anything, you just need to press the button near the bed." And then Harry went off to close the door quietly from the outside.
Harry did another experimental lick and then pulled away to raise his eyebrows at Draco. “Then let me clean it, hm?” Harry hummed, eyes flickering playfully.
"I wish I were in hell, but unfortunately, they say I'm not strong enough to live in hell." The man said with a sneer.
"What do you mean you're fine? Your guardian angel doesn't know how to dispel the devil's whisper. That's why you feel pain in the brain." Harry then returned to focus on looking at Professor Trelawney again in front of the class.
Harry cleared his throat deliberately to fill the awkwardness that overtook him. Harry's snort also made Draco seem self-conscious. The young man spontaneously stepped back so that there was some distance between himself and Harry.
He had been trying to keep his heart for Harry alone even though many men were trying to win him over.
In the mythology he knew, the Titans were a group of early gods who ruled the earth. Kronos was the first ruler to eat his own children for fear of falling into power. Then Zeus, who his mother saved—arranged a plan to free his brothers who had been eaten—then took revenge. Kronos was defeated, and Zeus became the main God of Olympus.
"Of course I would. Dancing with this future royal leader must be a wonderful thing." Draco said no less politely as he welcomed the crown prince's outstretched hand.
All the guests and the royal members instantly drank their wines. After that, the ballroom was again filled with voices belonging to the guests. They started to enjoy the party that the King of the Delion Kingdom was throwing.
From that conversation, Draco knew that Natalie wasn't what a lot of people thought. Maybe many people believe that Natalie used her body to get to her current position... yes, although it's still possible, Natalie's excellent knowledge was also a plus point why she was able to level up from an ordinary concubine to the main concubine in a reasonably short time.
, a gorgeous dish of cream that is burnt on the top to form a crunchy but soft caramel layer on the bottom.
What was on his mind now was his marital status. Ares was mad at him, and so was he. But Draco was willing to compromise and give in. He couldn't force feminism and modern-day equality in Ares' court. But it seems the war god was getting sick of him. Because he didn't want to meet the prince of Sparta at all. Even when Draco asked to meet, his bodyguard admitted that he was busy.
Draco just kept silent; again, their conversation led to that. He wasn't stupid. He knew that Cedric had liked him for a long time, but he closed his eyes to that fact. After all, Draco wouldn't let his family down just for his love. His family wanted him to be
The bodyguards stared at each other, trying to make a sound, but couldn't. They are blameworthy. Alden, as their superior, has instructed them to check anyone before entering and exiting Draco's room.
Ares rubbed his face. He was confused. All the skills to seduce and flirt with humans for thousands of years seemed just to evaporate. He should praise, seduce and pamper his wife, but right now he had a hard time doing that.
During this time, Harry had always kept himself away from any kind of interaction with any Omega. If necessary, he only interacted with them as necessary, and Harry ended the interaction first. He couldn't imagine himself lingering with another Omega and treating them as his surrogate mate. Although for a while, Harry felt it was impossible to do. Also, he felt like he was breaking his sacred bond with Ginny.
Without preventing it, Draco quickly cast his sharp gaze on the man who was currently walking his feet towards Draco with a slight smile on his handsome face.
Harry shook his head nonchalantly. "He wouldn't dare, and even if he dared to do anything. I will finish him myself."
It felt like the young man wanted to curse himself. Only one day had he expressed his emotions freely with Cedric, but he couldn't control his feelings anymore. Draco didn't want to be branded as incompetent by anyone.
, citrus slices, and bread baggage. The presentation is beautiful, like a stretch of desert on a plate complete with an exotic atmosphere.
. Draco's eyes met the dark brown eyes of Harry's mistress. Suddenly, she was startled because her hiding place was already known to others.
Draco stood calmly, but he quickly removed Cedric's sword right in front of his face with a rough motion. As quickly as possible, he again left some distance between himself and Cedric.
"I want to get to know you better. I don't want to be bedded because we are married. You haven't even kissed me yet," Draco spoke carefully.
Draco covered his ears from the regretful words of the guards arriving late. He was much more interested in the shiny object the bird had dropped. Were vultures similar to crows who like to steal and collect shiny things?
As much as possible, Harry controlled his sentiments. He didn't want the anger that was currently filling his heart to ruin the party that the Delion Kingdom had prepared for them.
"Isn't that the sound of crying?" said the King of the Delion. Despite his old age, it seems that that man has not lost his ability as a perceptive knight on the battlefield.
When Draco just nodded, Harry landed another slap on the top of his ass, sending Draco another high-pitched yelp. "Understand?" Harry growled.
Was this how Narcissus feels when he sees his own reflection? His reflection was so perfect that he fell in love with himself. But Draco wasn't that naive. He was a modern young man who wasn't easily swayed by someone's beautiful face.
Draco's body was burning all over, hot with anger and fever with passion. This man was clearly so skilled at flirting with his partner that even the inexperienced Draco was carried away by his passion, overcoming his hatred.
Draco let out a sigh of relief as his buttocks touched the very soft feel of the glorious chair. He relaxed his back to the throne. His two slender hands had moved to hold the elbows of the throne that looked very majestic.
Harry pulled out and flipped him around, so now he was on his four, cock hanging. Harry didn’t waste time before he pushed in again. He moved, this time slower than the other times. He leaned down on Draco’s back, pushing in deeply. One of his hands touched Draco’s stomach, pressing in and making Draco whimper at the feeling.
Draco woke up a second time in that strange place again. This time, however, he was calmer and felt much saner. A bitter taste in his mouth. It seemed that the old healer had fed him that disgusting potion when he was unconscious earlier. His body felt lighter. Draco got out of bed and was now in a better room. The bed was quite soft and had good ventilation, so he didn't feel hot or cold. Draco saw several beeswaxes burning to indicate that night had come.
One of Cedric's freed hands then moved to caress the side of Draco's face gently. Again, the man pampered Draco, making Draco more indecisive.
Luna's eyebrows furrowed. "I know this prophecy from a warlock. No one knows how it started, but the warlock says there's a creature that originally does not take sides to start this war. Whichever party they choose, it will be the future of humankind."
Draco seemed to be pacing back and forth in his room, and Harry was staring at the young man with interest. Then Draco moved to open his clothes. Harry swallowed hard, glanced around his deserted surroundings, and started to feel uneasy about making himself a pervert peeping-tom peering into the silhouette of a man changing his clothes.
Draco just watched the man as he walked and sat there. Taking a deep breath, Draco begged him. "I know an immortal like you can live for thousands of years. But I don't, so I don't want to waste my days just like that," he said softly.
Draco's starting to feel uncomfortable, so he might as well tell them that he recognizes them in their true form. From their face, Draco could see confusion and surprise.
"God, you taste so good," Harry was getting more and more excited, smooching Draco's hole, which was twitching as if asking to be filled with something hard and big.
"I'm getting married, Aphrodite," Ares announced. His almost naked body lay half-asleep on his bed. The moonlight peeked in thinly from his bedroom window, illuminating his perfectly sculpted physique.
"I thought you were a spoiled prince who would keep crying over your fate all the way to Olympus. But you turned out to be quite strong. So I'm giving you some advice so you can live long enough on Olympus. When you arrived at Ares palace, the other envoys and I will return to our work area. But you can meet Hadreda. She lives in the planetarium. You can learn a lot from her," said Attica again.
Draco became alone, and the resentment buried in his heart grew even more after his parents' death. All of this has its roots in Harry Potter. Ever since that man appeared in his family, everything was destroyed. Draco must take revenge, at any cost, to avenge his mother's grief and his father's futile death.
Draco pulled his hand from Cedric's grip. He took vast strides toward the bird. The blonde gave a slight grimace as he lifted the defenseless bird with both hands. Cedric followed Draco and knelt beside him. The man's index finger moved to gently stroke the little bird's head.
Draco ran as far as he could, ignoring the soles of his feet which were sore scratched by the sharp gravel. He had to act fast, he didn't have much time.
"I'm not young anymore. My body isn't aging, but my mind isn't as bright as it used to be. One of my children may have to take my place at Olympus." Zeus explained.
"I'm fine, Prince Cedric." Draco held both of Cedric's hands that were cupping his face, and with a gentle motion, Draco tried to remove them from his face, but unfortunately, Cedric tightened them instead, as if he didn't want Draco to pull his hands away.
Harry breathed out in a huff. He stepped into his room. Draco was resting on the bed soundly. His face looked flushed from fever, and his forehead sometimes wrinkled to indicate that he was in pain. Harry suddenly felt guilty, remembering their activities last night. The result of his ego to satisfy his pent-up desires. Maybe that's why Draco caught a fever because of exhaustion.
At that instant, his burly bodyguard let go of Draco, almost knocking him out from the exhaustion of struggling. They stood face to face in the eyes of the many waiting people. Harry was still standing with a cold, expressionless face as he rubbed his cheek, where Draco had slapped him.
"No, but I'm sure that angel has a goal of loving a demon. Otherwise, they wouldn't have dared to take such a big risk." Draco didn't even know where the words came from.
"But you have to keep eating. I'll order another menu for you. Maybe hot soup and fresh juice can arouse your taste?"
Cedric looked at the blonde with tenderness before his lips moved to answer the question. "If you want to thank me, don't give me words that I might forget when I wake up from my sleep, but give me words that allow me to tell the world that you are mine."
Slowly and cautiously, Draco stepped down the stairs. He had managed to cross the room and hold the large door handle when the cold voice he began to recognize was heard right behind him.
"Did I make you wait?" He asked Ares, able to see that he was carrying a bundle of cloth in his hand.
"Don't put on a face like that. You're an Empress. It's not good if your authority is lost in front of your own people," Cedric was powerful enough to make Draco return the shape of his lips to their original shape.
"What is the purpose of these angels and demons of loving and having children? That is my question now." Professor Trelawney put down her sketchbook and then sat on the edge of the table.
"You're a married man, in case you forgot, but you visit a young woman instead of your wife every night. And what's worse, no one knows what you've done with that
Draco buried his face in Harry's shoulders even more — realizing that Greyson could see his naked body, which was now sitting on Harry's lap. The heat immediately creeping up both sides of his cheeks, realizing that Greyson saw himself in the vulnerable state he was today.
"He's just a human. He will not return to Sparta and live forever on Olympus. After all, many Titans live to mingle with humans and even marry them. Why can't I?"
Draco then averted his gaze to the side. He didn't want to look at Cedric. Even though he was currently looking at him with a piercing gaze and shouting at him harshly, Draco could still find a glimmer of frustration and sadness that was so deep in Cedric's eyes.
"Greetings, Prince of Sparta. My name is Alastair. I am here to fetch you." A young man in a red robe bowed respectfully before Draco. Alastair has black hair and a handsome face. Like the clothes of the Greek knights, the young man wore leather trousers with his upper torso exposed. He carried a bow and arrows and a short sword with a deerskin glove.
Draco snorted in disbelief. Because of that man, Draco's mood was broken. It seemed he would stop reading the vulgar novel and resume it when the moon was shining brightly. No one would disturb him at night so that Draco could absorb every neatly written sentence in the vulgar novel. With a light motion, Draco took the book from under his pillow.
"Your Majesty! Is it time for you to challenge the gods? This is Ares we're talking about!" The Queen said in a panic.
And the same thing repeats itself like a cycle that never ends. Draco's relationship with Blaise finally has to run aground because Draco has not been able to forget everything about Harry.
Troya slept on the floor. He was reluctant to spend the night in the same bed as the War God on their first night. That was not normal behavior for a human being. After all, he's a prince. Generally, if they're not comfortable—they'll go on all night without speaking. At least they tried to convey it to Ares.
Harry glares at the nurse who was sedated to replace Draco in bed. The two bodyguards who had been guarding Draco's room stood terrified, their faces wounded from Harry's beatings.
"Why are you standing on the balcony at night like this?" Harry frowned as the torrential rain began pouring down. Even the water splashed and started to wet Draco, who was standing while looking down at the yard.
"This forest is not your territory. Why are you here?! Did you sent the bull to me?!" snarled Ares, annoyed.
It's a leech! He immediately raised his hand to pull the leech off the white horse's hooves without the slightest bit of fear or disgust. The horse let out a small cry at Draco's rough movement.
He didn't know since when the sight that many people might think of as a gruesome sight had become such a fantastic sight to Draco. Maybe... since his father forced him to abandon love for the throne.
"Same," Harry replied calmly. "I never imagined it either, because I only imagined you with your bewildered expression when I said I like you,"
If Draco asked him for help, would Doctor Jason understand? From what he said earlier, it was clear that Doctor Jason thought Draco was Harry's boyfriend.
Coffee was served, a sign that the casual meeting was over. Several men opted out to smoke, while Ron sat quietly on the edge of the sofa, watching Harry, who was still busy studying the files in his hand.
He didn't want himself to be judged solely for his physical beauty. Even though all humans had a choice, and of course Draco respected it—he just wasn't used to it. Maybe he should accept it because he lives in the era of ancient Greece. Draco also guessed that Ares' character might not be as old-fashioned as the majority of men in ancient Greece.
But for some reason, seeing Cedric moving leisurely while displaying a crooked smile, annoyance filled Draco.
"Looks like she needs you, Your Majesty," Draco told with a meaningful smile and gently pulled his hand from Harry's shoulder. Harry nodded firmly with his eyes now filled with a shimmer of happiness.
Cedric's smile still on his handsome face began to steer his horse towards the place he wanted to show Draco. Before Draco started his horse to follow in Cedric's footsteps, the blonde took the time to glance at Harry.
Draco's mind was spinning…it seemed impossible. But if he doesn't try it, he won't know. As expected, the room's door opened, and Draco sat straight up in alert, waiting for whoever would enter. Alden appeared carrying a tray of food, his face as flat as ever.
Every time, every day, the pain in his chest came. It reminded him of the good times he and Harry loved each other.
Somehow, Draco wasn't comfortable hearing that. "Sorry, I think you have harassed Attica," said the prince furiously.
Draco didn't know the meaning of his mother's words, but it calmed him down. Draco knew that at least he had people he cared for and cared about. At least Draco knew that. But Harry doesn't, and he doesn't have anyone to share with. Draco didn't know how old the man was now, but that wasn't how Draco actually felt earlier. He sensed everyone's suffering. It was as if Harry was telling him that the demons would win against the angels.
Draco suddenly didn't know what to do. He should have left immediately, but finding Harry just standing still, made him want to stay quiet too.
Vlad helped Draco to sit up, but because his head was still dizzy, Draco accidentally leaned on Vlad's shoulder. He could feel Vlad's arms reaching his body. Comfortable, Draco likes this convenience. The comfort he never expected from someone like Vlad.
Draco tried to remember. It didn't seem like he had done anything wrong yesterday. Ares was still smiling and kissing the back of his hand when they parted. He was nervous because he didn't think that Ares' invitation to relax in his private cottage might be the end of his life.
Draco felt left out because instead of accompanying him, Ares sat next to Aphrodite, who was clinging to him. Ares probably hadn't greeted him at all today, and Draco refused to look sad because of it. He raised his head and smiled at the guests. He was already familiar enough with the residents of Ares palace that he wasn't too worried about being lonely.
"Unfortunately not, although Hermione sends her regards and hopes to see you at another time," Seamus shrugged. "Harry sent me."
"Thank you, Your Majesty," Draco said as he passed the little bird in his hand onto Harry's hardy palm with a stiff motion.
A crumb that does not correlate with the main story. It took place in chapter 10, where Harry was burning with jealousy seeing Draco and Greyson together.
"Good," the man then placed his hands on the bottom of Draco's thighs, leading the blonde to start moving up and down his lap, his lips finding Draco's lips that began to let out a delicious moan. "Tell me you're mine," the man whispered, yet to stop his activities, making Draco move up and down on his lap.
Draco didn't want to see Harry today because he saw the man's past concerning wars thousands of years ago. So, Draco put his guitar next to him to make space between him and Harry.
Draco gasped when he felt his waist being grabbed tightly by a pair of sturdy hands. This was not dancing etiquette. He lifted his head to look at the owner of the impolite burly hand. He was just about to say his disapproving sentence, but when he saw the owner's face of the hand, Draco stopped his intention.
Draco stared for a long time at Potter and Cho, who were sitting next to each other. So close that Cho would occasionally steal opportunities to hold Potter's hand. Draco was sure he saw Potter uncomfortable, and he hoped it was
Draco and Greyson suddenly turned their heads and found Harry, who was already standing there and glaring at them. His face looked cold and firm, as if he was holding back from exploding. With brisk strides, Harry approached them.
"Aren't you tired of talking about that all the time? I killed Diomedes in a fair fight after I recovered," Ares said, refusing to be humiliated. He fought using human weapons at that time. Diomedes turned out to be quite tough as a fighter and had time to defeat him.
Cedric always followed Draco's footsteps with the same happy face as Draco. Cedric felt happy because he managed to make Draco happy.
Draco could feel every curve and every tendon of Harry's cock buried deep inside his body. Even though it had been more than half an hour, the other man still didn't want to move and give Draco what he needed, what Draco wanted.
Draco was surprised at the sudden question. "Ah, um... Yeah, I'm fine..." Draco smiled nervously. His heart was thumping quite fast.
Maybe he's having a good time with his new lover. Draco sneered, trying to ignore the pinch in his chest. But if that was the case, why didn't Harry let him go? Was it because the man knew Draco intended to kill him, so he kept Draco here because he thought Draco was a dangerous threat? Then why didn't Harry kill him all at once?
Draco woke up when he felt his arm sting. He opened his eyes and stared at the young man with glasses who was very handsome and friendly.
"It's not poison, Draco, it will stimulate you until your cravings get out of hand, and you will be in pain if you are not satisfied."
Draco's got the most beautiful pair of tits Harry has ever seen, and by some blessing, the beautiful boy was super sensitive there. So Harry played with them, eliciting gorgeous, desperate sounds from Draco's pretty mouth.
Unexpectedly, Draco doesn't have a morning class tomorrow. So he can do other work besides maintaining a bookstore. His mother worked in a restaurant as a chef, her cooking was always delicious, and Draco never doubted it. But, he didn't want his mother to work too hard to pay for his college tuition. So Draco worked in three places at once so he could pay for it himself.
A wet and warm sensation fills Draco, and the boy whimpers out weakly, tightening his pussy around the sensations. Harry keeps filling him with thick semen and holds on to his baby tighter, thrusting weakly before stilling and sinking his weight on top of Draco's softer, much more pliant body.
Draco still didn't answer his question. But inwardly, he continued to grumble. Who also wants to know? And who cares? Draco thought.
"His Majesty is confused. This drink will make him better." Draco saw the 'Healer' approaching with the earthenware bowl. The disgusting potion he stirred with his wrinkled bare hands earlier was likely to be drunk on him.
"Put me down, crazy villain!" Draco shouted loudly, trying to grab the attention of anyone who might be around him. Draco saw several servants witnessing the kidnapping but was reluctant to take action. After all, Hector was popular as one of the top Generals. Moreover, there were rumors that the prince had turned insane since he recovered circulated in the palace area.
Draco kept his relaxed posture. He didn't want to give the impression that he was interested in the current direction of the topic of Terence's conversation. "Why do you say that? Aren't you the future ruler of Delion? You will be known as a King, not a rebel."
"What are you doing?" asked Draco irritably. The people around them kept looking at Draco with strange looks.
Harry swallowed hard when he could clearly see his wife's innocent body shape for the first time after five years of their marriage. Harry didn't want to admit this. However, his wife looked so mature and seductive compared to Arabelle.
Cedric's mumble managed to make Draco pull his gaze from the sky to Cedric's eyes which turned out to be staring intently at his face.
The King was even prepared to keep his son from marriage and let him devote his entire life to serving the temple of Athena. Faced with a fate like this, the King regretted the proposal after proposal for Troya by princesses around Greece—including princes and kings, which he had always refused. Now his son will be married to the God of Olympus with the worst reputation. Troya will be brought to a different realm, and his father may not see him again.
The touch of Draco's soft hands on his back made the situation even worse. It turns Harry on to the levels he couldn't bear it. Draco frowned at Harry's moaning sound. He couldn't see Harry's expression, could only see Harry's back hair, which was black and now wet, attached to the nape of his neck.
Draco’s pupils dilated, and he whimpered. “Yes. Yes, I need it.” He cried, feeling embarrassed and humiliation spread across his cheeks.
"He's asking me a favor," Hermione winced as she rested her head against Ron's chest. The man was still lying relaxed with his eyes closed, enjoying quiet moments cuddling with his beloved wife.
Purposely, Harry caressed Draco's back where the guests in the ballroom could see. Of course, Draco got little goosebumps from his husband's touch. After all, he had never felt that man stroke his back.
Draco turned and looked at him, causing Harry to frown. Draco's face was pale, and his lips dry. He looked weak.
When he regained consciousness, Draco was in the white room, and he closed his eyes again. Never before had he felt so grateful to be in this room. Terror still crept over him, imagining the blade flickering across his face, on his body, on his arms…
"What flower is this? I have never seen a flower as beautiful as this in our royal land," said Arabelle in awe when she saw Draco's embroidery.
In a swift movement, Harry was standing. He twirled Draco around and pressed him against the wall. “Ready, darling? I'm gonna fill you one more time.” Harry declared, his hands already spreading apart Draco’s arsecheeks in preparation.
The first time Narcissa did that for Draco was when he was seven years old. Draco asked his mother to treat him like a prince on his birthday. And then his mother decided to treat him like a prince every Draco's birthday. But now that he was twenty years old, he wouldn't ask for that anymore.
From where he was, Draco could see the guards cheering with joy as they stared at him. It seemed like Cedric had already informed them of his willingness. He replied to the guards with a charming smile and a very graceful wave of his hand.
"Are you kidding?" Draco whispered, holding back his laughter. "A person like him will never fall in love,"
Draco narrowed his eyes suspiciously. He temporarily concluded that someone was strongly suspected of deliberately harming Troya. Because the temple of Athena was located in a crowded residential area. There were barely any trees and shrubs there. Snakes are cowardly animals. How could a snake roam the temple and bite Troya? Moreover, he said there were six bites.
"What do you want?" Draco asked disapprovingly when he heard the crazy remark Terence had just said.
"I have to go. Arabelle needs me," said Harry as he pulled his hands that had been holding Draco's back.
"What if His Majesty finds out?" asked Glenice worriedly. She looked at Draco from the mirror's reflection.
A warm hand caressed his sides, and then it slipped between them, and Draco inhaled sharply when it splayed over his stomach, just inches from erection. When a thumb brushed his clit, Draco jolted at the sensation, body tilting forward as he forced himself to rut against Harry's hand.
Harry returned his stare with a sweet, evil smile. "If you promise to be good, maybe I'll offer you a comfortable place, next to me in the car."
The first thing Draco noticed was, the sturdy building that stood tall in front of him looked unkempt and creepy. No other buildings were standing around it, only some wild bush that Hagrid, the keeper of the mansion, had probably just mowed down.
Since Draco was released, this is the first time he has been able to enjoy the rain in person. Back then, when he locked in that white room, Draco could only enjoy the rain from the window without touching it. Now when he could feel the rain soaking through his body, it felt so wonderful to Draco.
"Hey, I know—but it's less risky than looking for an Omega in public! Plus, no one will ever know who you're taking—unless you uncover it yourself, of course," explained Ron.
It felt like she wanted to cry right now. In fact, she had hoped that the man would meet her and take her out of this room filled with nobles. Unintentionally, her glazed dark brown eyes collided with the Empress' silver eyes.
"Ah, yes, sorry, I was rambling around but forgot to introduce myself." the woman stretched out her hand and smiled. "I'm Hermione." Her friendly smile was contagious.
The man calmly removed his tie, his movements so slow but threatening that Draco unconsciously shuddered and inched away.
“It’s — wait!” Draco gasped, feeling too overwhelmed from his multiple recent orgasms. His cock stayed hard as Harry continued to press harshly against his prostate. Draco let out another cry. “It’s too much. I’m going to fall.” He cried, barely able to keep standing even with Harry’s help.
Draco let out a sigh of exhaustion and satisfaction. Harry wrapped around the blond’s middle. Draco’s entire body felt sore, especially his stomach and now limp, oversensitive cock.
His eyes stared in surprise at the owner of the hand. The owner of the hand was none other than his husband, Harry.
Did Draco do something wrong? Shouldn’t a queen spend the night sitting on a makeshift wood and looking up at the beautiful sky?
Ron scowled, displeased that his attempt had been dismissed before he had even tried. "No." He shook his head firmly. "I'm sure my idea this time—will come to success. But above all, you must be willing to give it a try. As the last opportunity."
Draco wails as he cums, curling up into Harry's neck as his hips thrust a few times sharply. His cries sound tortured now, bordering on pained as Harry plays with his little cock. He's being pummeled in the best of ways, and it's like euphoria when he cums, soaking himself in his own juices.
Harry immediately shook his head firmly upon hearing the place slide out of Ron's lips. "No. Somewhere else sounds better." After all, Harry also did not want to get a temporary replacement partner who was careless and haphazard.
Finally, Draco could breathe a sigh of relief. Now, Draco felt himself getting sleepy and decided to go straight into the room to rest after turning off the television and washing his bowl. After cleaning himself and changing into pajamas, Draco lay down on the bed and fell asleep just like that.
Harry gave Draco a quick glance. Then he stood up from his place and just disappeared without saying a word.
Prince Cedric, in his night robe, walked hastily to Draco. Ignoring Harry's presence in the lounge chair, Cedric led himself to sit on Draco's side of the bed. Cedric's strong hands moved to cup his pale face in a gentle motion.
Draco stared in confusion. Then he just realized that there were a pair of wings adorning the man's back. Draco's eyes seemed to be tested whether it was real or not. They resembled the ones Draco saw when he touched Harry. The difference is, the wings really were stuck in his back.
Then he saw Harry standing in the middle of the demons. His face looked really scary, but Draco could recognize him. Draco didn't know why he recognized the man. Then Draco saw himself, lying on the ground covered in blood. And the vision brought him again to see him kissing Harry, and the man stabbed him in the chest.
The red stain on the bed bothered him so much that Draco violently grabbed the sheets and slammed them on the floor. His breath was heaving, and then his body collapsed to the floor, crying with emotion. Draco's memories drifted to his father and mother, to his unanswered hatred, and his fate to be trapped here in the clutches of his great enemy. Now he was slumped here, in Harry's grasps, and what the worst is, he was helpless against that man.
A hug woke Draco from his reverie. The beautiful blonde turned his head and found his husband behind him.
"It hurts! Help!" Draco screamed without restraint. He rolled on the hard bed, curled up, holding his head. A loud buzz rang around his ears. It sounded like a swarm of bees swarming and about to attack him, but its form does not exist. After a few seconds of struggling, he passed out.
Harry tightened his jaw even more. This was one of the things he didn't like about Draco. The blonde always put the kingdom above anything else. He stared at Draco and Cedric with furious eyes before the king’s legs moved to kick Cedric's stomach and left the room violently.
Harry bowed slightly, then lightly touched Draco's cheek. The young man groaned softly and then changed his sleeping position but did not wake up. Harry took the risk by bowing down and kissing Draco on the lips, tasting the sweetness of them. Until then, he dissolved in his unsteady passion and crushed Draco's lips.
"I've decided to have you, and the only way you get away from me is when I choose to let you go, or when you… die,” with his cruel closing words, Harry opened the white door, and pushed Draco inside, then locked it from the outside, leaving Draco banged and kicked the door hysterically.
"How did you get along with His Majesty's mistress?" Natalie asked without a second thought which made Draco slightly raise his eyebrows. "If Your Majesty doesn't want to answer, that's okay. I know if this question sounds inappropriate. Your Majesty can forget this question." Natalie continued quickly when she saw Draco's silence.
Draco's mouth opened very wide, staring in disbelief. "My phone!" he shouted and then hit Harry on the shoulder. When Draco hit the man, he felt an intense sting that made him even more curious. Draco then hit Harry again, and the feeling of the sting returned.
Aphrodite's anger made her reluctant to be loyal. She was the goddess of Love and Beauty, and she has the right to share her love and body with whomever she wants. No man in this world has the right to claim ownership of her beautiful self.
Harry looked away. A moment later, he put his hands on Draco's head, right and left. And suddenly, it was as if Draco felt a great pull. His memories come back. Starting from his twentieth birthday, which is today. Then it went much longer, his seventeenth birthday, next his eleventh, fifth birthday, and until the first day, Draco was born.
Alden seemed unfazed by Harry's words. “You ordered me to make that boy surrender. He really hates you and will surely resist like hell. Drugs are the only way to make him give up." Alden looked Harry in the eye. "You can leave this room if you don't want to take advantage of it."
Harry stared in disbelief as he saw his wife now in the arms of his own cousin, Prince Cedric, and the disbelief grew even more when he saw the fresh blood already soaking his brother's hands and… his wife's shirt.
Draco then sat on the edge of the bed, closed his eyes, then opened them again. Still in the same place. Then Draco closed his eyes again and opened them again, still the same.
The young man looked back. He had obtained enough information that seemed to help him survive safely in Ares palace, though still confusing.
"You... Aren't you from Prince Cedric's palace?" asked Harry, slightly surprised when he saw the four guards with yellow stripes on their chests.
Draco took a deep breath as he sat on the toilet, then calmed himself down before entering the classroom. After finishing, he immediately walked out of the bathroom. When Draco came out, Harry was leaning beside the door with his arms crossed over his chest.
"Why do you say that? You haven't even tried it yet," said Cedric with a delicate frown that had graced his forehead.
Draco took his lunch with a quick move and ran to the room where Professor Trelawney was teaching. He had to hurry before Icarus killed Harry. Before, Draco also ran out of breath because Harry tried to connect himself with him.
"Good," Harry muttered with satisfaction, then called the waiter over for dessert and coffee. "I want a truce."
"Y-yes?" Draco flinched. One of the main Gods of Olympus spoke to him. "God of Wine, I'm sorry if I'm rude. How can I help you?" Draco straightened his back in a polite manner.
Draco was surprised, of course. It wasn't unusual for Harry to hold him by the waist when many people didn't surround them, but as much as possible, Draco remained casual, acting as if he was used to Harry's touch on his body.
It was quite a night, and the sound of crickets was loud. Draco could see the clear cloudless sky and the moon giving off a romantic feel without them asking. Everything was clear now. Troya wasn't having bad luck. The God of War would not torture him. He was instead given a new life that would probably make him happier.
"No. Vampire blood is very effective in healing humans. You are drinking too much of my blood. And it affects the function of your human senses."
And, the happiness inside Cedric was getting more and more intense when he again managed to enjoy another side of Draco that no one would ever see. Even Cedric was sure his husband wouldn't know about that other side. Cedric felt relieved and proud because he was the only person Draco trusted to see all his emotions.
"My prince!" The waiter looked worried. He was carrying a papyrus scroll in his left hand. "I heard that a vulture approached you! The guard told me about it. Are you hurt?" The chatty pumpkin spoke worriedly.
The man grabbed Draco's hand and hugged him. Then he flapped his wings. He took Draco flying, entirely off the ground. "What the hell! Hurry up and put me down!" shouted Draco frantically.
"I know about the Goddess Aphrodite. You don't have to worry. I won't mind it," Draco nodded firmly.
," Draco said while mocking his name. "I have other business, and you should better find another mortal." Draco walked toward the door and down the stairs.
Draco looked at their faces one by one. They were all physically very human, but there was something different about them. Even though they were all tough, there were wise eyes full of depth of knowledge from them. Unlike Draco's earlier image, Ares' envoys were not barbaric and quite polite.
In front of him at this time was a bull. Buffalo monster that was still related to the Minotaur. It's just that it was not very smart and has three horns. Even so, its strength was no less difficult. It could knock down a hundred-year-old oak tree with just a single jolt.
Athena, like most of the other Olympus goddesses, was born beautiful. Her hair was curly black, and her skin was slightly pale. Somewhat different from the other goddesses, Athena wore a half-faced war helmet and did not wear a dress. Athena looks like a female warrior from the Amazons.
"You think I'm stupid?" Harry's voice sharpened, as sharp as his stare. "You are my most experienced bodyguard. There is no way that boy can trick you unless you really let yourself be tricked."
"I want to get out of here as soon as I know everything. You have no right anymore to use me and keep me here," Draco lifted his chin arrogantly.
"I know you're a little sorry, Ares. I forgive you," Draco confirmed. The War God laughed again. He then leaned half-knuckle against the wall and carried Draco on his lap. The boy shrieked softly in panic.
Draco left Harry and Icarus, letting them continue their bickering because he was not interested in their conversation while his stomach was starving. Draco brought his own lunch that his mother had prepared and looked for a seat with a table near the front garden.
Draco's eyes roaming around the room, looking for a way to escape. There was a large window at the far end, lined with white curtains so that Draco could find a way out. Carefully, Draco stepped towards the window to examine it, but he was also disappointed in an instant.
"Before ending this fight, I want to ask you one thing," Cedric stared intently into Draco's silver eyes, which seemed to glow in the sunshine.
Draco tried to grab the man's head by grabbing his soft black hair. But unfortunately, Draco's actions only made the man kiss his neck even harder. Gasping and desperate, Draco finally could only observe and feel.
"In that case, will Your Majesty spend such precious time together with a lowly noble like me?" Cedric asked as he stared intently at Draco.
"Wait a minute," Hermione took out a little gold card from her bag, "This is my card." She held it in Draco's finger. "Call me whenever you want. I thought we could be friends."
Hearing that, Harry grunted loudly and leaned back against the car seat, hoping this would all be over soon.
The King of Delion looked stunned when he saw Harry carrying a weeping woman in his arms. As a man who had been drugged with love, he was, of course, aware that at this moment, Harry was worried about the young woman in his arms.
"Near the cliffs, there are a lot of beehives. He entered the wolves' area. I saw him about ten minutes ago when this damn Cyclops swing me around,"
Ares Palace's kitchen was stocked with a wide variety of high-quality ingredients. But no human has ever set foot there. The Demigods and non-titan nations, even though they were human, were educated in the Ares Palace as warriors. They can't cook.
"You're so pretty, Draco. I even thought you were a girl earlier." Daphne said with a slight chuckle, polishing Draco's face, who's still closed his eyes in front of the mirror.
Before Harry actually burst out laughing and woke Draco up, he put the book back where it belonged. Then, Harry stepped out of Draco's room with a faint smile.
"Geez, how much work did you do that you forgot your own birthday?" Narcissa shook her head in disbelief.
Alden glanced at the painting on the wall. Draco thought he saw a glimmer of sadness there, although he wasn't sure because when he looked at Alden again, the man had a straight expression back.
It wasn't that Draco was the type of person who rarely clean himself, but considering the sky had started to turn black, Draco couldn't even guess without dipping his feet into the puddle of freezing water.
He admired Cedric's courage. Cedric still dared to approach him even though the man had received blatant threats from Harry; it seemed that the prince had never been afraid of his sibling, even though his sibling was a king who might be able to put him to death even though they had the same blood.
"You need to adapt to living here. Otherwise, it would be a bit of a hassle if we were in the same room. Aphrodite could visit at any time and—" Ares stopped talking. "About Aphrodite, she is—" Ares wanted to explain.
That night, Harry was clearly protecting him. But why? The questions made Draco's head hurt again, and he closed his eyes again.
"Good afternoon. It looks like you are feeling better." Doctor Jason said hello again in the afternoon after examining Draco. "And I see your dinner is still intact. Why don't you eat them?"
The prince turned his face to the side, and he could see Draco, who now looked a little different. The young man's blonde hair was still dripping with water. Well... Cedric took Draco for a walk into the woods when he had just finished cleaning up. Cedric didn't even give the blonde a chance to dry his hair because they had to take the opportunity.
"We love playing games, but that's only in certain environments," Draco responded. He anticipated that Dionysius would one day try to check the truth with Sparta and find out about that, in reality, the Spartans were too severe and rarely partied.
"Draco," Harry's voice startled Draco, who was pensive on the balcony. The same balcony where Harry threw Draco horrifically into the pool underneath him a few days ago.
His only chance might be to negotiate with the entourage who would pick him up later. Hopefully, they weren't real Ares' followers because if they were from Olympus, all the gold pieces he had would be of no value to them.
"You can't control me. Supposedly, you can't control me anymore since I left this house," Draco gritted his teeth.
Without saying anything, Harry spurred on his horse quickly. The sky had darkened, and the sounds of wild animals were starting to dominate the forest as if they were forcing the husband and wife to hurry out of the woods.
Ares was the God of War, the only son born of his marriage with his consort Hera. Ares should be one of the most revered gods on Olympus because of his bloodline, but the God of War was never tired of made trouble. He did not openly show his true identity to humans, but he sent gifts and messengers and announced that he had taken a human Prince as his wife. Zeus had made strict rules about it. The titans are not allowed to interact with the humans carrying their true identities.
"Oh, I'm rude. You must be very thirsty, prince of Sparta. Here, have a drink," Ares handed him a leather bag filled with water.
It turned out that not even Harry's fiery desire was directed at him. Draco was just a substitute for the woman Harry really wanted. Of course. How could Harry Potter suddenly be attracted to him as a man? Draco smiled bitterly, holding back the pain in his chest.
Draco stared at the other man stubbornly. "Then explain to me who this woman is, why her face looks so similar to mine and is this why Harry kept me captive?"
Harry took a step back, then stretched out his hand in a half bow, "Let me help you out, princess." He said mockingly.
"Yeah... So beautiful..." Cedric muttered incoherently. His eyes still faithfully enjoying Draco's face from the side.
"No... It's... It's itchy. It's itchy." Arabelle whined and gripped Harry's oversized shirt as the young man again wanted to scratch his skin roughly.
"Yes." Draco nodded his head, clearly embarrassed. "I changed my mind. Do... Do I—we—still have time?"
Draco was still walking backward when he suddenly bumped into someone. "Aaaaa!!!" he screamed. "Help—" His mouth gets covered before he could scream out loud again.
Harry ruffled his hair in frustration. "Okay, what do you want?! Do you want to be free? Good! You will get what you want, as long as you want to eat!”
Alden was silent, staring at Harry with a flat face, completely ignoring Draco's presence. Draco frowned. Did this guy really have no expression?
Attica was an Amazonian female knight. Her short wavy dark brown hair, brown pupils, and firm facial structure make it seem like she's an unapproachable person. Draco noticed that her steps were as firm as a man's. Likewise, her back and shoulders and her athletic upper arms.
Draco's eyes suddenly turned dark. He took a few staggering steps back from Harry. Draco returned to where he was, staring at Harry, whose eyes had now returned to normal. Seeing Draco's terrified face, Harry started asking him.
Draco frowned slightly when he heard the answer. Does what did he mean by 'jealous husband' was Harry? If he was, then the Delion Kingdom was unfortunate. How could the Delion Kingdom have a potential leader who wasn't good at reading the situation?
He hadn't had time to collect all the threads yet, but a call from his personal maid stopped Draco's actions for a split second. Draco smiled sweetly, but he didn't stop his actions. He collected the various colored embroidery threads and put them in the basket one of the maids had prepared.
Doctor Jason seemed to know that Draco was wondering. He shrugged his shoulders. "Don't tell Mr. Potter that I'm talking about him behind his back, okay? Until now, I still have goosebumps remembering his murderous look when threatening to kill all the doctors and nurses here if they don't save you," he stared at Draco regretfully. "Really, anyone who saw his behavior yesterday would have come to the same conclusion, that Mr. Potter is a boyfriend who loves and worries about you very much."
Draco raised his eyebrows, interested. Harry never asked for anything. The man is used to order, and then when it is not being obeyed, he will force whatever he wants.
"Shut up! Your presence beside Draco will only keep him from enjoying the fresh air." cut Cedric quickly.
The strategy might work. Draco felt at ease from their first meeting. He who was afraid and worried now even began to underestimate the ability of the God of War. They were husband and wife, and sleeping together was almost always the main focus of the bride and groom.
Harry cast his piercing gaze from Cedric to Draco quickly. The king's chest heaved up and down erratically to indicate that the man was already emotional right now.
"A lot, I'm not going to lie," Ares replied with a smile. "I won't pretend to be a saint, let alone seduce you by lying that you're going to be my only lover or the last human in my life. I'm an immortal, and you have to understand that we can't do that at all."
Draco made his way to the courtyard of Malfoy Manor with hasty steps, where his carriage was waiting for his return. Before Draco got into the carriage, Draco gripped the glass bottle his father had given him.
"Oh, come on, Attica, you are almost 300 years old. One day you will also get married. None of your amazon friends here, it's okay to be spoiled for once in a while," teased Lasonas, another messenger with short haircuts and scars on his face, near his ear.
Draco also understood why Alastair had doubts that he could befriend Hadreda since she was a Centaur.
The carriage door opened, and he saw Hector. He immediately grabbed Draco and made him run. It didn't matter even if he was wearing a dress and footwear that made all his movements slower and more graceful. The man who had been on the carriage seemed to have fallen because Hector was forced to stop his horse. He was one of Ares' emissaries.
Without thinking, Draco took wide strides towards Cedric. The blonde raised the sword in his hand and pointed it hastily at Cedric's neck. And as expected, Cedric was able to dodge so easily.
"Master Harry never destroyed your father's company, let alone bankrupted your father," Alden shrugged. “You may not believe it, but you can look for information anywhere. What master did was not bankrupt companies. He helped companies on the verge of bankruptcy and revived them. Many of the companies he has taken over have become many times more advanced thanks to my master's greatness."
Draco dragged his trunk back and entered. Inside was worse than outside, a creepy impression was thick Draco felt. The floor was dirty and lots of leaves were coming in through the side of the large windows in the wall that had been broken for some reason. The tall pillars that supported it made the old building appear proud and cold. On the roof, there is a painting of clouds covered in thick dust and looks dull.
Draco flushed again at the comment, mouth opening and closing in shock as he tried to come up with a proper response. Harry seemed to take that as a sign to continue, as he leaned back in to continue playing at Draco’s entrance. Without warning, the tongue forced itself inside.
"No wonder Abaddon is looking for you. He knows you have no protection. He wants to kill you for power. Your blood can give him ten million strength against angels." Harry settled his hands on his hips as if too excited.
Draco was not sorry about everything that had happened. Instead, he felt grateful. Because with all that he went through with Harry, he is now a strong person. He became a person who could survive alone, without any support from anywhere.
The King of the Delion Kingdom took a long-legged glass that had been on his throne chair. The drink was filled with dark red wine. The King of the Delion raised the glass high with a happy smile decorating his wrinkled face.
Zeus was said to be able to transform into a swan or any creature and secretly sleep with the humans he likes. Why did Ares have to go too far for this? Draco still wonders what reason Ares wanted to marry Troya honorably other than the fact that Troya had the nickname 'the most beautiful man in Greece'.
Natalie answered Draco's words with a fresh laugh. A few moments later, the two people spoke to each other. Sometimes they talk about royal life, sometimes about politics, sometimes gossiping, sometimes about the military, sometimes about flowers.
Draco suddenly felt sad about the journey of his life. Confronted Doctor Jason, who always looked cheerful and unburdened, made Draco want to cry, and his eyes began to fill with tears.
"But Ares has broken the rules! I want justice to be served, Zeus!" Athena spoke out loud. She wanted Zeus not to waver.
Slowly, Draco opens his eyes, waking up to the sound of birds chirping. He gathered his consciousness, then wake up and sat on a large white bed. Draco's mind wandered. He tried to remember the reason why he could be in this room. Instantly a flash of memory crossed his mind.
“The famous Hyde never fails. He will become obsessed with his victim if he can't kill them. And now, he will definitely come after you. You have to be careful because, until now, we don't know who he is."
The Prince's expression changed his cheeks slightly flushed red. Ares felt it was natural because he knew that he was the bride of God Ares. He was used to dealing with anyone who turned awkward and shy in front of him, but he didn't lose his confidence. But this time, somehow, his awkwardness was contagious to him. Was it because he regretted being too slow to save the prince? or because of the guilt of having spied on the prince's behavior?
Ron had a serious look on his face. Watching him, Harry hoped his partner's head wasn't blowing smoke. "I think it's necessary. You in this region are known as the Alpha of the largest pack and are well known by many. It will give a strange impression if you don't come."
Luna stared at her best friend intensely. She cast his gaze in the same direction as Draco. But Luna looked back at him as if in shock. "Is he here?" she asked in a whisper.
After wrapping the scarf around Draco's neck, Harry pulled himself a few steps away from Draco. The man stood up and stared at Draco's calm face with an intense gaze.
"My clothes accidentally got into the river. I couldn't possibly wear wet clothes. I don't want to get sick and neglect my responsibilities. However, Your Majesty is looking at me in this embarrassing condition. Forgive me, Your Majesty."
Draco was a little pale at this point. Can he trust the man? Hector was obsessed with Troya. He was supposed to be the last person to get close to the blonde prince. The prince realized that Hector had taken him to a quiet place away from the sight of those busy securing themselves or ganging up on the envoy.
"Harvesting some ingredients for the Love Potion. Only in Ares' garden can I find vanilla. I came with Aphrodite earlier," replied Eros casually.
"I was sent to hand you the documents," Seamus cleared his throat at the thought of something, "You may not know me, but I'm a friend of Ron and Hermione."
"Prove that you are indeed messengers of God Ares and not messengers from other kings or princes," Draco said as he looked at Alastair firmly. Alastair's face turned serious. He didn't seem to like the Prince of Sparta challenging him. Yet, Draco had to do it because he didn't want to end up in the bed of a lowly noble who wasn't worth it for Troya.
Harry came out of the bathroom, still angry. His hair was soaking wet, and all of his wet clothes sat on the floor.
