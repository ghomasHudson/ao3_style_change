The only thing Harry could think of that might help was if Sirius talked to the portrait of his parents. When he first heard about them during the Will reading Harry had been ecstatic at the thought of talking to them. But then the anxiousness hit.
Remus coughed, getting everyone’s attention. “I know where Sirius is…” Harry also couldn’t figure out why Remus was blushing, but he decided to speak up as well.
Dumbledore reached out to try and snatch the folder up, but Fudge was surprisingly quicker. Paling as he scanned through the documents, face going slightly green. That was when he whipped towards Dumbledore, eyes burning with an inner fire. “Albus, explain! You were his guardian, how could you have allowed this?” Fudge demanded, face red with fury.
Someone also asked me how I stay inspired, personally, I go and add a bunch of pins to
“But the removal was rather sudden, and as the Minister, I have a right to know such things,” Fudge tried.
Harry walked around the room, scanning the sparse bookshelf, the old Quidditch posters, and knick-knacks that cluttered the many shelves. On top of the desk, sitting in a place of pride was a snitch on a pedestal next to a picture of three young boys standing with their arms slung around each other. Harry reached out to lift it, the strange feeling of having something in his hand that should’ve taken some effort to lift but was surprisingly weightless. He studied the picture, thankful Sirius and Remus were allowing him to explore for himself. The boy in the middle was obviously Remus, a vivid scar splitting his eyebrow that now, as a man, was only a thin white line. The boy on the left had to be Sirius, something dog-like about his grin even then. And lastly was a boy with curly hair that somehow proved to be messier than Harry’s own.
“You were younger when we met, at least you get to know him before Harry does.” Anna scoffed rolling her eyes but still undoubtedly fond of her young mate.
Harry couldn’t help but to beam up at her, her excitement infectious as always. Shooting stars danced around the dark blue paper and Harry opened it as carefully as he could. Before he could really get a grip on what was in the box, Issy was speaking up.
Harry decided that while he was gay he couldn’t see the appeal, it was rather strange looking.
Harry was surprised at how fast Remus could move, his body tensing in preparation to attack if there was a threat to him. That silent act showed Harry just how much the other man cared for him, and he couldn’t help the tear that fell from his eyes, he was wiping it away with the back of his hand when Remus took a large step to the side. Harry looked up to see Neville standing in the doorway tensely. Harry barely recognized him, the other boy had suddenly shot up like a sprout and the baby fat he carried, especially in his face, having melted away.
Sirius coughed to clear his throat, “Yes, a little pain during sex can be pleasurable. But that depends on the people involved. Some people enjoy it and some don’t. It’s just something you will have to try to see if it works for you.”

I leave to Francis Augustus Longbottom and Alice Helen Longbottom nee Smith of Cornwall, England, if they shall survive me, Vault 584. In the case, they are unable to accept this bequest it is to be held in trust by Augusta Corvus Longbottom nee Black of Cornwall, England, for Neville Francis Longbottom of Cornwall, England. Frank, you were always a brother to me and I am sad I will no longer be there for you when Alice kicks you out of the house for being too risky at work. And Alice, you have become like a sister to me as well, please promise me if Lily and I are both gone to help raise Harry. He will need a woman’s touch with Sirius and Remus raising him.
Harry looked over to his Daddy who had his mouth hanging open in shock, Harry wasn’t sure why but Lyle didn’t offer the information and just left the room with a thoughtful look on his face. Harry just went back to reading, ready to put down the weirdness to the stress of moving.

Harry looked up at his Papa in confusion, “It’s beautiful, but… what are they?”
Tiptop suddenly looked at the bed, brows furrowed, causing everyone else to look over. A vortex of flames appeared over the bed, but none of them worried about it, they had already seen it enough to know it was the Phoenix.
Godric put an arm around the other man, pulling Sal into his side for a quick hug. “Well, my love, first we have to visit a pair of wonderful ladies and then we have some sneaking to do.”
Issy huffed, face turning into a pout. “I know that! I still don’t like it. He’s my baby, and he is too young to be looking for mates.” Issy whined.
Thank you to the lovely Will and mldeal89!
’. Harry looked down at his lap, warmth pooling there in a way he had never experienced. He would have to talk to one of his parents about it, worried something might be wrong with his body.
“My mate accidentally misrepresents my work. As it is now, there is no real cure for infected lycanthropy-” David was quick to continue as he saw the hope dimming in Remus’ eyes. “What we are researching is essentially a workaround. You see, we found the recipe for the potion that was given to Peter Stubbe and one of the main ingredients was the blood of a born Werewolf. The problem was that since the blood was taken unwillingly, it corrupted the potion’s intention and made it Black magic. We feel that if it wasn’t for that, the potion would have worked as intended in this case. As for the workaround, the team I am a part of are close to developing a method to purge the Black magic taint in conjunction with a blood adoption process to replace the infected blood with healthy blood. Theoretically, the blood adoption process is used to introduce willingly given Were blood to purge the Black magic that drives the wolf insane during the full moon. During the following full moon, the transition is complete as the wolf becomes a part of the host.”
Let me know what you think and if you see anything wrong please let me know so I can fix it.
Harry had no clue where his Daddy might be, all the adults were running around the house, making sure everything was finished before the move. He could be anywhere in the manor or even at the new home, but luckily, Harry knew just who to call, “Tiptop?” The House-Elf popped up before him, waiting for him to ask his question. “Could you tell Lyle that his brother Siles is here to see him?” Tiptop nodded, ears flapping against her face and popped away again.
If you are curious about how things are going consider
But here they were, Molly staying home every day and Arthur spending twelve hours a day at work. And it hadn’t been until he became head of his department four years ago that he finally got a day off. So now he spent every Sunday devoted to his children.
Harry looked as if he had been struck by the question. Like he had never realized he had even thought that until this second. Sirius relaxed, realizing what was happening as the two adults allowed Harry all the time he needed to think.
“By your disownment of the three, am I safe to say you had no clue of their plans?” Helix asked, still looking at the others with suspicion.
David understood completely and was quick to agree, going over what they would most likely ask of him. All they needed at this point was willingly given infected werewolf blood to test their theory on. Theoretically, it should work, they just wanted to do all the double checking they could do before they risked people's lives. Remus and Sirius accepted the Claremore's invitation to move into the manor, both because they wanted to be closer to their cub and because Dumbledore’s actions had scared them.
Sundays were Arthur’s day off, and even though he had the chance to sleep in he never did. He liked to be up for as long as possible to spend as much time as possible with his children. When he got out of bed Molly was still asleep, the line of pillows that separated their sides of the bed like a metaphor for their marriage. Arthur was still unsure of why he had married her but he knew the reason he stayed. He stayed with Molly for his children. Three of his older boys were now living on their own and had all come to him once they moved out to ask why he had married her. It was when Bill first asked that Arthur really started questioning it. Sure he hadn’t been happy since before Ron was born but he never questioned why.
Bartok flushed, clearing his throat before speaking, “Yes you have, when we adopted you. Please understand Harry that I did not make that promise lightly. Remember the circumstances, you were blind and unable to read a magically binding contract that could have said anything. It could have made you a slave. Swearing on my life was the correct Oath to make in such a case, it guaranteed that we were in no way trying to trick or harm you. If I had lied I would have been struck down immediately and you would have known you weren’t safe with us.”
“I vote for going home!” Lyle cried, clearly wanting to leave this all behind them and get back to their regular routine without the risk of Harry being taken. All the paperwork was finished, and the House Elves had finished moving the two beds during the meeting. They all said their goodbyes to Percival who bowed towards Harry and said it was nice meeting him. Harry was quick to thank him for defending them, and then they were being swept away by green flames.
Harry stayed like that, growing bolder by the second, fingers brushing through soft brown hair. Heavy eyelids started fluttering open, lashes caressing sleep reddened skin. Neville smiled before his eyes even opened, a large hand coming to cup Harry’s cheek. Neville finally opened his eyes, all melted chocolate, and affection, fingers sweeping across Harry’s face, lingering over eyebrows, dimples, moles, and lips, finally starting to scratch blunt nails through sleep-mussed hair.
I'm just gunna leave this here.
Remus had rested a hand on Neville’s shoulder to try and comfort him but now decided to speak up about another subject. “I know you said Harry’s illegal marriage contract was dissolved but have you considered calling upon Lady Magic to pass judgment?”
Each took their turns to state clear No’s, the crystal not turning red at all.

He would get to the bottom of this mess as soon as he could.
“Why are you here?” Severus probed, eyes narrow.
“I, Arthur Septimus Weasley, do hereby removed Molly Muriel Prewett, Ginevra Molly Dumbledore and Ron Billus Dumbledore from any right you have the Weasley vaults, and properties. I strip you from any connection you had to the Weasley family.” All three were dragged violently through the wards, screaming the whole way.
The marrow deep emotions they were all feeling was enough to let Bartok know that they had no clue of the plans and strongly disapproved of them.
“When I came home from my workshop, mother told me Vippy was helping you move, I wanted to come to see what was going on.” Siles leaned forward, obviously worried for his brother and his family.
He was mesmerized by it. Without his sight, he had forgetten the fact he now had a tail and ears, but now he could no longer pretend to still be human. But it was so soft and pretty that it almost didn’t matter to him.
… and where his Mother’s hair had once stood up in rebellious spikes it now clung to her scalp, slightly greasy. She only turned when Augusta gently pulled on her shoulder, her once cherubic cheeks now hollow and her lips white and chapped.
“Abuse?!” Fudge stuttered out, watery blue eyes almost popping out of his sockets as he looked over Harry in a whole new light.
Arthur slumped in his seat, absolutely shell shocked. “You’re not the woman I married, your not the woman I fell in love with,” Arthur whispered, not even meaning to utter it.
them of this conversation, we don’t want them running to Dumbledore.”
“Is something the matter Arthur?” Molly asked, expression as if butter wouldn’t melt in her mouth. Her hands anxiously smoothing down her dress, gaze locked slightly over Arthur’s head so that it looked as if she was looking him in the eyes but she really wasn’t.
Charlie and Percy arrived seconds after each other, rushing over to Bill to try and figure out what was going on. Bill was quick to summarize, handing the spiked pot of tea over to Charlie to try and figure out what Ron and Ginny knew of the situation. Charlie filled two mugs and rushed up the stairs, taking a few seconds to school his features to not let anything show.
Thank you to the lovely Will, and Amycat8733!
That was what Harry hated about his long hair the most, his curls tended to find their way into his fox ears, tickling him until he removed them. He wanted to take a pair of scissors to the hair on the sides of his head but couldn’t get the image of what his hair had looked like while Petunia had done that to him. Harry sighed, making a mental note to ask Lyle for a solution tomorrow as he brushed his teeth, he knew there was a charm for it but it always made his gums hurt and felt like it didn’t do the job. Harry felt the same about cleansing spells used in place of showers.
Severus ran as fast as he could, muscles protesting at this unusual treatment. He desperately needed to get to Hogwarts before the Headmaster could. Now that he was free, he didn’t want to risk being under that man’s control again. But all of his worldly possessions were in his chambers and there was no way he could survive without them. Severus crashed through the front doors, too rushed to try sneaking about. He practically flew down the stairs into the dungeons, wand at the ready the entire time.
(See the end of the chapter for
Before Remus could start telling Sirius about what they had found out about Severus, a vortex of flame appeared in the middle of the room. All the Claremores looked nonplussed, while their guests were all shocked.
Griffins were by far one of the most deadly races, and Bartok never forgot that.
There will be a lot of polls about the fic.
There Harry was, bright green eyes glittering at him, wild hair now more curly with the added length. But the two things that shocked Neville the most were the new additions, a beautiful pair of ears and a fluffy tail waving out of control behind him. Then there was how healthy he looked, and all the tension Neville had been holding since he first realized what Harry’s home life was like melted away.
Molly laughed cruelly, her eyes wild as she hissed, “We’re not married, you stupid man.”
“Harry, there is no way we would allow them to take you from us; I even have an Auror friend who will be at the meeting to make sure they don’t try anything. Trust us, we will protect you with all we have.” Harry buried his face in Bartok’s neck, allowing his Papa to shelter him within his strong arms. The warmth lulled him to sleep, drool soon dripping down the side of his mouth.
They were now in front of wooden double doors, Neville taking in a shaky deep breath preparing himself for disappointment,
They all went up to tuck Harry into bed, the young sub curling around his teddy and soft blanket, a small, almost nonexistent smile on his lips.
“When this crystal is activated it will glow red if someone is lying, myself and Mr. Claremore will be included in this. If you do not wish to answer any questions asked you do not have to but know depending on what the question is, it may affect our view of your intentions and actions.” Helix set the crystal in front of him, tapping it with one long boney finger, causing it to glow a brilliant green.
"Go grab Malfoy!" Someone said and in the next seconds, Cedric was trying to help him to breathe again. When did he stop? Why did he stop? Why couldn't he brea-
Miss you and love you, mom. Send my love and hugs to dad, Sirius and Remus. Also send them to Cissy and Lucius! Love you all, xoxo.
"Bloody hell." Ron muttered and put two chocolate frogs inside his mouth.
The wizard world had felt in shock when it went out that "Harry Potter, the only child of one of the most important families to the Wizard World, a fourteen year old boy, was going to participate of the Triwizard Tournament". People were confused, mad, happy and they all had a lot of different ways and emotions they felt about the situation.
"I'm sorry, i was thinking about something. Yeah, I'm okay, Ginny."
His thoughts wouldn't stop, they wouldn't stop torturing him - torturing him with all kind of pictures and scenarios of what could happen in the next two months, what could happen during the second task.
"hey..." Harry muttered softly.
"How are you, love? Besides being exhausted." Draco brought his hand to Harry's chest and started drawing small circles there.
"What is... happe... him?!"
"What the hell?" He heard Draco saying at his side, wide eyes, looking as frightened as everyone else he knew that cared about him.
Harry could feel his lungs burning, he could feel and hear the beats of his heart, how fast and irregular it was beating. He tried to say something, but what came out instead was a sob, a raw and painful sob.
Don't forget to leave kudos and comment, please!
And things went pretty fast for Harry - and everyone else too - from that on. The task was hard. Harry felt like he was going to die multiple times while that dragon followed him. How was Cedric? Fleur? Krum? How were they? Were they okay? How was he? He didn't even know if he was okay and safe, for Merlin's sake.
TRIGGER WARNING: Panic attack!
"What was that?" Cedric asked, still worried about the boy he considered a brother.
"I'm sorry, i don't... i don't know what happened. I was thinking and then i... i couldn't focus on anything anymore." "You did nothing wrong, don't apologise for it." Blaise said, he put his hand on Harry's ankle and caressed it a bit, a small worried grin on his lips.
Harry's heart was beating so fast, he was so fucking scared. So fucking terrified. He felt the adrenaline running through his entire body.
"Are you okay?" Draco asked, his voice was so desperate and shaky. The younger boy nodded.
She frowned.
"I'm really fine, besides being exhausted. I really want to play quidditch again, though. And, what do you think about going out this weekend? We both deserve a break from reading books and thinking about the task."
The tournament was not going to be any easier from now on, but they had each other, they had their friends, perhaps they were going to be okay.
"Hey.. " He felt warm hands softly hold his face, making him look at it. Draco was holding his face, looking at at him with so much love, fear and... concern on his eyes.
Quick reminder: english's not my first language, so if there's any mistakes, I'm really sorry. You can correct me if there are mistakes, though.
"Yeah, i did. I hope they're not going to freak out." The younger boy said after breaking their kiss with a soft peck on Draco's lips.
"I'm... confused, to say the least." Harry said.
He knew he had to find the egg, so he tried to put his mind away from everything else and tried to focus on the damn egg.
The boy stood up, his legs were shaking and his lungs were burning. He ignored the calls of his friends, he ignored the scared looks they gave him, he ignored when someone touched him. In fact, that made everything worse, if felt like their touch burned him.
He needed to get out of here. Out, out, out...
The Library Night was when all of them stayed in the library all night long, reading, talking, just keeping company to each other, eating, watching some muggle movie or literally doing anything all of them together. Usually they did it when one of them was feeling down or stressed, tonight, it was all of them.
I think that's all i needed to say for today.
"Well, let's do adventure then."
"I thought about maybe just going to the lake, we could sit there, i could play a song with my guitar and sing, we could dance, eat a lot, kiss a lot. I just want to spend a great day with you, just us."
"Yeah, i do. Don't worry, I'm fine, really."
"I'm fine. Are you?" The older boy nodded, too and then he hugged him tightly
Draco moaned in a low voice when Harry moved his body, pressing it against Draco's. Fuck, how dared he to be so beautiful? Harry was a tease. A bloody tease that Draco loved and needed.
Everyone loved Harry, literally everyone. Everyone was protective over him, everyone just wanted to see that boy happy. So yeah, everyone was going to freak out about the situation.
They stayed in a comfortable silence while the girl was looking for the book, before she asked:
He and Harry were on his bed at their dorm, their curtains were closed, a big and comfortable blanket was covering their bodies and they were side by side, the blonde was reading a book, same as Harry.
"Yeah, but now they have the chance to study and learn about the task too." Hermione said while eating a pudding Luna gave to her and everyone else.
He saw his friends there too, they were all looking at him and he noticed how they were all holding themselves from hugging him too, letting Draco do it first.
"Not really, my boy. Not really." Well, now that's messed up.
"And they always have great ideas." Harry said.
Truth is, he wasn't fine. Not at all.
When Draco, Theo and Blaise told them all about what happened to Harry that night, they all kinda freaked out and said he should go to see Madam Pomfrey, perhaps even Severus or Mcgonagall. But Harry denied and said he was okay now, said he didn't had another attack after that and he was fine.
As usual, english's not my first language, so if there's any mistakes, I'm really sorry.
The other boy hummed softly and nodded, before closing his eyes and letting his body relax on his boyfriend's safe and warm arms.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
"No drama tonight, not tonight, please." Neville said while looking through one of the book sections and they hummed in agreement.
"Who wants to start reading?"
Staring at the ceiling, Harry took a deep silent breath, feeling his entire body as if it was made of rocks, he felt so heavy, like a huge weight was pressing him down.
"That's amazing! I mean, we don't have to worry about that anymore, right?" Ginny said, looking around and seeing how they nodded, relieved looks on almost everyone eyes.
"In fact, even my mom will freak out." Ron said and then, they all giggled.
"I'm right here, Harry. I'm here." He was starting to feel less like the weight of a huge rock was standing on his chest, he could breathe a bit better again. He tried to take a deep breath, it hurt, but he did it. He could feel Draco's fingers touching the back of his hands, making soft patterns there - like he always did, knowing how it helped the boy to feel calmer -.
"I'm fine, Mione." He smiled softly and stepped closer to Draco, who put his arm around his body, pulling him closer.
"Maybe we can find books about dragons." Hermione said.
"You need to rest. I know you want to help Cedric and I, but i need you to rest, okay? I need you to take care of yourself too. Or to let me take care of you, at least." Harry muttered, his chin resting on the top of Draco's head.
"What are you two talking about?" Hermione asked and Harry took a deep breath.
Cedric chuckled and shrugged his shoulders.
"That's okay. We're going to be okay." He said in a low voice.
"What!?" Harry chuckled, confused and Draco looked at him with a deadly look.
They were all at the library, Draco, Hermione and Theo were reading books; Cedric, Neville, Luna, and Ron were writing something - probably homework -; Fred, George, Ginny and Blaise were talking about a new prank they were planning and Pansy and Harry were talking. About the first task.
"You should send them a letter, just to make sure." Theo said, but Blaise rolled his eyes while staring at them all.
4) I will write smut, BUT it won't be so explicit (since i prefer to write a soft and fluffy sex rather than a harder and savage one). But, yeah, I'll write it, although it will be only in the next history.
"We love you, too. A bloody lot, mate." Ron said and they all agreed.
"Okay... " He yawned "i love you."
Harry closed his book - the one about mental health; it ended up being extremely interesting and it really was helping him to understand what was going on in his mind, at least a bit - and glanced at his boyfriend, a soft look on his eyes. Draco was putting so much effort in finding out something that would help Harry and Cedric during the task - that, by the way, was going to happen in less than two weeks -, he was reading so many books with Hermione and Theo, and honestly, they already found out a few things that could help the boys, but they were not sure about them. So they kept researching.
"The tournament was not going to be any easier from now on, but they had each other, they had their friends, perhaps they were going to be okay."
"How was your weekend?" Theo asked.
He wanted to go back, he wanted to get out of there with his boyfriend and make sure he was okay and safe, but something stopped him. He didn't know what, but something stopped him from getting out of there. So he waited, and when he noticed Fleur was nowhere to be seen, he started panicking. His hands were shaking while he held Draco's body, while he looked at the little girl.
"Good. Come here." Luna stood up and helped the boy to do the same.
"We'll never know. Or we'll have to find out."
"I think now, more than never, we should keep an eye on Harry... he'll need our support and we have to be there for him." Ron said while Pansy said a "accio hot chocolate" and five mugs showed up on their hands.
Draco was really exhausted yesterday, but he slept a lot and today I'm making him taking a break from the books, to rest his mind a bit. He's kinda angry, but he's like a cute kitty when he's angry, so i don't really mind it.
"I'm shitting myself because of this task too." He muttered and Cedric nodded, chuckling softly.
Here's another chapter! I hope you like it!
She pointed at the plate in front of him and frowned a bit. She was right, he didn't eat.
They always asked when it was about Harry - since the boy tended to always bottle his emotions down and keep everything to himself - but a quick look to Cedric and they could see that he and Harry had talked, so they wouldn't stress the boy making him talk about it again.
"I know, that's what i'm... worried, about. I don't want them to worry. I didn't even want you guys to worry. I hate feeling like I'm a fucking burd-" he cut himself before finishing the sentence and sighed, a deep sigh.
"Harry. Love. Angel. Harryyy!" The boy groaned softly and only held Draco's hand, who was shaking him, trying to make him wake up.
He loved the feeling of home that Harry always brought to him. Harry was his home, he was his safe place, he was his favorite place.
He was okay, wasn't he? He was just nervous about the second task, nervous about his boyfriend staying underwater for an hour and Harry needing to take him out of there. He was scared Draco would die. His mind was terrifying him with all the scenarios - the awful ones - of what could happen. He felt - all the time, all the fucking time - like a giant weight was being pressed on his chest, preventing him from breathing, making his heart beating faster because he was scared he couldn't breathe. He couldn't sleep well for a few weeks now, he was using charms so anyone would worry about how pale and tired he looked... but he was okay. Yeah, he was okay. Or he was going to be, at least.
Hi, sweetheart! How you're doing? I hope you're doing good!
"Thank you, Luna." He managed to say, his voice was so low, but the girl heard it and slightly nodded.
"I hate you having to do this too, Harry. Merlin, we all do. But i don't want you worrying about me. I want to do this, I'm going to be okay. And you are going to be okay too, but i don't want you only thinking about the others, you need to worry about yourself too. Okay?" He felt Harry nodding against his shoulder.
"Same, mate. We all know she hates Harry the most amongst all of us, we don't know why, but she does. And she's always looking at him with that creepy and disgusting smile on her bloody ugly face." Draco subconsciously tightned his grip around his boyfriend and pressed his lips on Harry's head, leaving a kiss there.
"Not really, think i barely slept two hours. Couldn't stop thinking about... this stupid situation." Harry sighed slightly and caressed Draco's hair softly, before kissing his lips quickly.
Both boys spent all the weekend together, seeing their friends only during breakfast, since they had lunch and dinner together outside or at the room of requirement on Saturday and Sunday. They also slept in the room of requirement, wanting to enjoy time together as much as possible before the start of the week.
Yes, it is an angst fiction, but it is also really fluffy.
Harry was sitting on Draco's lap, the blonde was hugging his body like he was a big teddy bear, making Harry feel safe and protected without even knowing it. Cedric was at Draco's right side and Ron was at the blonde's left side; Hermione was sitting on the other couch, Pansy was at her side, holding her wand, thinking about it all. Blaise, Ginny, Fred and George were on their feet, walking around the room, talking about what they could do to the person that put Harry's name inside de Goblet; Neville, Theo, and Luna were on another couch and they were silent. Theo had his wand on his hand, holding it strongly, wanting to kill whoever put the younger boy's name inside that thing.
The boy always took care of them, always made sure they were comfortable, safe; that they were fine and that they felt loved and happy. But it had always been hard to let Harry let them do the same for him.
Harry shook his head and sighed softly.
"You're safe now. You're here. I'm here. We're safe." The blonde muttered, more to himself than to anyone else. He felt so scared after Harry ran away from the library.
On Monday morning, they walked towards the great hall, going to the Slytherin table where their friends were.
See you next chapter! ❤️❤️
"Unfortunately, there's apparently nothing we could do to take Harry away from the tournament." He said coldly, while staring straight into Dumbledore's eyes.
And PLEASE, read the final notes, they're really important! I need to explain some things about this story.
"Hopefully yes. And hopefully they'll find someway to not having you participating of the bloody thing." The blonde said, before putting a piece of cake in his mouth.
"Let's get out of here, the poor boy is looking like he's going to faint at any second." He heard someone saying, he recognized the voice as Fleur's. Suddenly, he was being - carefully - dragged out of the great hall, out of all that noise and mess.
"Is everything alright?" The girl asked and saw how Draco, Theo and Blaise shared a look. Harry looked at them and sighed before saying:
"Huh, right, people are looking for you two, you mostly, Harry. The tournament will start in thirty minutes, they want to talk to you first." The boy sighed and Draco put him on the floor.
In the next seconds, the library had all the pillows and blankets they always used for those nights. A warming spell was cast in the room and it had a comfortable temperature now. Luna and Ginny made the hot chocolate as usual - their hot chocolates were the best ones - and Fred and Neville made the popcorn. They made the popcorn just appear in the room, but it tasted great.
"I love you, too."
He could hear his heartbeat, it was beating so fast. He felt so scared. He felt so fucking scared. He put his head between his knees and tried to breathe, but it was fucking hard.
"We'll be okay. I promise. Now that i can actually think about, it will be a bloody life experience. The tournament and everything."
"I love you, guys. All of you. A lot." Harry said calmly, looking at his friends, his family.
"Do you feel better?"
"Mimicry!" Fred and George said together and high fived.
"Hum... oh fuck!... about going back to our room?" He finished his sentence and Harry stopped the kiss, only to look into his eyes, before saying:
"There he is!" He heard a voice, lots of them actually.
He didn't sleep that night.
"Did you sleep well?" The brunette nodded and kissed his cheek.
They started walking side by side, a comfortable silence between them.
Draco, in fact, did not. He, same as Cedric, Theo, Ron and Pansy stayed awake almost all night, thinking about the whole situation, the five of them were exhausted.
"Hey, what book is it?" He practically jumped when he heard Ginny's voice.
"Morning... " Harry yawned again and he put his arms around his boy, cuddling closer to him. The blonde pressed a kiss on his forehead and kept stroking his soft hair.
He felt Draco kissing the top of his head, he felt him caressing the back of his neck, drawing small patterns there with his fingers.
They stayed in a comfortable silence for a few more minutes, before Harry took a deep and shaky breath and closed his eyes for a couple seconds, before opening it again and looking at his friend.
"Here, chocolate pudding. It always helps me to feel better after a stressful event." She gave one to Harry and one to Cedric, who started eating few seconds later.
"Hagrid told me. He said he wanted to tell me something, i put my invisibility cloak on, walked to his house, had a cup of tea, a few biscuits and he told me I'll have to fight dragons, the four of us will." The boy explained while glaring at his friend.
"I know." The brunette mumbled and that made a soft smile appear on Draco's lips.
He swam closer to his boyfriend and honestly, the image of Draco's pale and dead looking body was something he never wanted to see again. It was... horrible.
He could hear parts of muttered words, he could hear Draco's voice. He had to focus on that, because of how calm it was, because of how calm it made him feel, how it made his heartbeat calm a little too.
Sirius winked at Harry and in a fast way made a sign of a mirror, telling him to keep talking to him through the object and Harry rolled his eyes and smiled.
"For fuck's sake, no."
Draco rubbed their lips and pecked his lips softly.
He felt a touch on his hand and he looked down, seeing the girl was holding his hand, sitting in front of him, a patient and not even a little bit scared look on her eyes. She seemed calm. And honestly, that made Harry feel a bit better. Seeing she was so calm, it meant everything was okay, right?
"What?" He looked at his side, seeing it was Pansy who was talking.
"Hot chocolate and that salty muggle thing you like?" Draco asked, while he and everyone else started adjusting their positions.
"I'll do, dad."
"I... I didn't put my name there. Draco... love, i didn't.." it was the first thing he said soon as he calmed down, and Draco only kissed his lips softly and then hugged him tightly, caressing his hair. He rested his head on the blonde's shoulder.
"You bloody sleepy assess, wake up!" Everyone opened their eyes and looked around. Harry yawned and pressed his hands on his eyes for a second, before grabbing his glasses and putting them on. The boy shaked Draco's body a little and the said one woke up too.
2) Umbridge is going to be more of an addition during the FOURTH YEAR, that is, during THIS story.  In the fifth year (next story), she will appear much more, and it will not be for good reasons, no! Really far from it, actually.
"Great then. What we're gonna play tonight?" Cedric asked, filling his hand with popcorn and then throwing it inside his mouth.
"I know, my love." He turned around and now he was facing his boyfriend. Said one who was smiling and looking at him in such a sweet way.
"I'll talk to Fred, George and Ginny. They'll want to help me."
Later that month, Harry found himself looking through one of the book shelves of the library. It was night already, his friends were there too, but they were on the couches, doing homework, reading, talking.
Constructive criticism is always welcome!
All of them had been reading about spells and researching about the topic since they found out about the task, but Theo, Draco and Hermione were the ones that were focusing more on it.
And yeah, that's right: "almost everyone". Harry didn't feel any better knowing it.
Constructive criticism is always welcome, though!
"Many things are wrong at the moment, my boy, but right now, both yours and Draco's parents are here. Professors Snape, Lupin, Mcgonagall and I were having a... conversation with them before we decided to call you." Draco grinned, feeling satisfied their families were here now.
He wished he could feel like that all the time.
"Me three."
"Good. Okay... okay, i believe you. But you know you can always talk to me, to any of us, about anything, right?"
"You are really dumb, but you know that, right? I mean, Harry, Remus, your godfather is - literally - one of our professors, Severus, Draco's godfather, is also one of our professors, they're part of your families and you really think that they didn't tell the rest of your families about it?" The boy said like it was obvious - and it was -. Harry stayed in silence for a few seconds before slapping his forehead twice.
The younger one moved his lips from his boyfriend's mouth to his neck, starting kissing that sensible spot on his body.
"You scared the shit out of us, mate. For a second i thought about getting Madam Pomfrey or literally anyone, but Draco got here and started talking you down." Blaise said, he moved from where he was standing and went to Harry's bed, he sat on the end of it and Theo did the same, but he sat a bit closer to Harry.
Stay safe, love! 🥀❤️
"Do you feel uncomfortable here?"
"Me either." Cedric also considered Harry a little brother, he cared deeply about the boy, he loved him. And then there was Ron, who felt the same as Theo and Cedric about Harry. And he knew that his siblings - Ginny, Fred and George - felt the same too. Harry was family. Harry was family for so many people, for so, so many people.
Later that week, Hermione, Theo and Draco had started studying and reading lots of books about dragons, their weakness, anything that would help Harry and Cedric during the task.
"But i swear I'm gonna kill you if you ever give me the feeling that I'm having a heart attack again." Draco threatened - he literally stopped the kiss just to say that while looking into Harry's eyes - and his boyfriend laughed.
He kissed Harry's lips and then hugged the boy again. They stayed a few minutes in a heavy, but comfortable silence, before they heard their friends approaching.
Draco's here, he's here now, he's safe, he's fine. He's alive. He's safe. He's alive, he's alive, he's alive...
"Yeah, you?"
He could hear voices around him. He couldn't understand anything they were saying. Why couldn't he understand anything? Why did everything sounded like he was underwater? Why did his lungs hurt? Why was his heart beating so fast? Why couldn't he focus on anything? Who was this person in front of him?
Someone helped him and when he noticed, he had two blankets on his shoulders. He looked around and suddenly a body crashed against his. Draco.
"How are you feeling, my love?" Draco asked, he cupped Harry's cheeks and looked into his eyes, searching for any sign that he wasn't hurt or something else.
"Well, hello." Draco said, trying to hold back his laugh seeing how Harry couldn't barely breathe between James and Sirius and both Narcissa and Lily rolled their eyes.
The brunette slid his hands to the blonde's ass and gripped it, making a soft groan come out of Draco's mouth.
"Let's... what do you think about... " He tried to speak, but Harry cut him, kissing his lips again.
"This is my son we are talking about, Albus. He's going to participate of this stupidity, but if he gets hurt, you'll pay for it."
Don't forget to leave kudos and comment if you want to!
5) The Yule ball will happen, but it will be in a different time and way than the books and movies! (Thought i should let you guys know it.) Since it's my version of the history, things are really different.
"That's right." The old man said and the other adults had to control themselves from rolling their eyes.
"I love you guys, too. Thanks... "
At that moment, with the person he loved the most, while listening to the voice he loved the most, while looking at who he loved the most, Harry felt in peace. He couldn't think about his problems; he couldn't think about what he would do next week; he couldn't remember the awful feeling of not being able to breathe; he couldn't focus on nothing that wasn't here, right now; he couldn't feel anything, but love and care from his boyfriend. He couldn't feel bad. Because, right now... right now, Harry could definitely say he was fine. And that would be true. Because, he was. Right now, with Draco, just two people who loved each other so, so much, Harry was fine. He was safe. He was protected. He was loved. He felt that way. Draco always made him feel that way, no matter what; the situation, the moment, if Draco was with him, he knew things were going to be okay.
"Candies always makes we all feel better." Blaise said, thinking about it out loud.
"I'm shitting myself because of this task. How are you so calm about it?"
"You're going to be okay." Draco said when they got at the place the needed. "I know. You, Hermione and Theo told me all i could ever know about dragons for the past weeks. But I'm still nervous."
Hi, love! How are you? I hope you're doing well!
"I loved it, angel." Harry got closer to the blonde and put his hand on his cheek, before bringing Draco's lips closer to his and starting kissing the other boy slowly.
They all looked around, glaring at each other and they didn't have to say anything. It was true, they all knew it.
"True." Theo said and they all fell in silence, thinking too much about what would happen next.
"Hmm, the task's going to start in the next hour. I think we shou-" The blonde stopped his talking by kissing him again.
Said that, have a good reading, my love! ❤️
The older boy loved the taste of Harry's lips, it tasted so good, so sweet, so... perfect. He loved kissing his lips, feeling his taste, how good it was, he just loved Harry. So, so much.
"He was having one of that attacks again!" Blaise.
"Well, whoever did it, they want me dead." The boy said like it was nothing while putting a chocolate frog inside his mouth. Draco strengthened his grip around his boyfriend's body and rested his chin on his shoulder.
"Why don't you just ask her the name?"
"Merlin, Harry.. !" Draco gasped, feeling when his boyfriend started making back and forth movements on his lap, more specifically, on the top of his dick.
Harry was holding Draco on his arms, still recovering from the bloody panic he felt during all the day. Luna and Ginny were also holding each other; Neville, Blaise, Pansy, George, Fred, Cedric, Hermione and Ron were eating chocolate frogs, also laying down on the floor with blankets covering them;
"- us on me! You're..fe.. it's... Luna!"
"There's only four more days, I'm fucking shitting myself." Cedric said, receiving empathetic looks from all of them.
Harry stopped the kiss as he rubbed his lips down Draco's jaw, starting to kiss that spot, one he knew was a sensible one for the older boy.
"I know it sounds dumb, but Dumbledore." Pansy said in a low voice and Cedric agreed
"I'll go with you, love." Ginny mumbled
He tried to take a deep breath, it hurt. He tried to focus on something, anything that wasn't the awful feeling. He looked around, seeing his friends, seeing their mouths moving, talking. He heard their voices, but why it sounded like they were under bloody water? Not again. Not again. Not again. He could still feel Draco's touch on his knee, his warmth, but it wasn't enough. No, no, no, no... he needed to get out of here. He needed air. He needed to breathe. Why did this keep happening to him? Why couldn't he just fucking breathe?!
The boy walked towards the other participants and he stood by Cedric's side. How did he get into this situation?
The blonde boy shouted as he started running after his boyfriend.
"I... think i am."
Harry started stroking Draco's hair and nodded softly.
Harry felt so in peace at that moment. Like he could actually breathe and just have a good moment with the person he loved the most. He liked that feeling.
"I have no idea, but I'll kill them when i found out who they are." Draco said, and Harry mumbled something and rested his head on his shoulder, letting a soft sigh out of his lips.
Sitting on the bathroom floor, his back pressed against a wall, ignoring the confused looks for Myrtle, Harry was pretty sure he was going to die.
"I thought about him too, but my first thought was on Umbridge." Draco said and Ron nodded.
Draco laughed, before putting his arms around Harry's waist and bringing his body even close, if that was possible. He then, quickly changed their position and made Harry lay on his back and he stayed on the top of him, both his arms on both sides of the younger one's head.
"I know you didn't, dumbass. Don't worry about it now, okay? We're gonna fix this. I promise."
"It tastes so delicious, bloody hell!" Draco said, eating the said cake too.
"Professor, what is wrong?"
And while you're searching ponder this;
Leave kudos and comment if you want to!
The three of them had read about a lot of spells the boys could use, but they were not so safe, that's why they kept researching about a solution for the second task. They needed something safe.
"That's too soft. I'm not a soft person. Ew." Pansy said suddenly and they burst into laughter. In fact, yes, she was a soft person, but only with the people she loved, same as almost all of them.
His friends were okay, too. Cedric was okay. Theo was okay. Everyone was fine. For fuck's sake, they were all okay. Harry felt like he could finally breathe.
Harry finished writing his letter and took a deep breath. He seriously hoped his family wouldn't freak out because of what he said about the attacks.
Alex. 🍂
He noticed when Cedric got there too, he looked at the people there and after a few seconds, he swam closer to Theo and started holding the boy. He looked at Harry and they nodded at each other, then he left.
"Morning." Draco said, bringing his hand to Harry's head, where he started caressing his hair.
I hope you had a great reading!
"I mean, it's pretty obvious how Cedric is way more protective around Harry, Ron and Theo." Pansy explained and they looked at the said boy, who just looked back at his essay and cleared his throat. They laughed.
"I have chocolate frogs. Who wants?" Luna asked and Harry, Ron, Pansy, Fred and Neville asked for it. She threw a little box to every one of them and they started eating. Harry adjusted himself on Draco's lap.
The book says a lot about Panic and Anxiety attacks, and i don't know, but perhaps that's what i had. A panic attack. But, I can't be sure. I didn't have another one after that night, although if i go through another one, I'll let you know and I'll go to Madam Pomfrey. But i don't want you to worry about it, please. I'm fine, okay? Promise.
Harry took a deep breath and rested his head on the top of Draco's, who was laying against his chest, his head on his shoulder. The brunette kissed the top of his head and he felt Draco grabbing his hand, so he could hold it on his own.
Doing things like that was really normal for them, they always spent a lot of time together, just enjoying each other's company. Usually Draco would play a new song he wrote - but would only let Harry listen to it - and Harry would just look at him with so much love and affection it would make Draco's heart skip a beat. And he would do the same with Harry when the boy would play songs and just dance around - his boyfriend was a great dancer. He was so honest when he was dancing, you could feel every emotion he felt when he was dancing; it was so, so beautiful, - even angelical - to watch Harry when he was dancing -. Draco loved it.
The brunette sighed and nodded.
"That's okay. I can talk for you, if you want me to." Harry looked at her and she saw how tears were almost falling from his eyes.
"Wow!" A suddenly scream was heard around the bathroom and Harry and Draco separated their mouths. The blonde - still holding his boyfriend on his arms - turned his neck a bit and saw Ron standing there, looking like he was going to explode seeing how red his face was.
"What?" Fred asked.
"Please, it is too early for me to have to hear so much shit." Ginny said while she stood up again, after all, she just wanted to wake everyone up and go to breakfast. Harry chuckled and he got up too, helping Draco to do the same. "I'm starving." Fred muttered.
"Honestly, your relationship it's, literally, a life goal. I mean, if i don't have a relationship like yours, i don't even want it." Pansy mumbled while putting a piece of cake inside her mouth.
"Do you think our families already found out about the tournament?" Harry asked, while Draco was putting food on both their plates. The brunette grabbed a croissant and started eating it.
"Library night." They said.
Harry was looking at his boyfriend in such a passionate way while listening, carefully, to the words that were coming out of his mouth, while listening to the melody he was playing with his guitar, while feeling such a warm and lovely feeling inside him.
Since the library of Hogwarts was never used by anyone except the ones that were there at the moment, it had became their place since first year. No one would bother, fight, confront, judge, annoy or do anything to and for any of them there, cause it was their place, only them would stay there, it had became a safe and comfortable place for all of them.
"Really important details." Pansy said, mouth full of cake.
An hour long you'll have to look,
Here's another chapter, i hope you like it!
"Mom.. " Harry closed his eyes hugged her back.
"I don't think i can sleep tonight." Ron said.
"What happened?" Neville asked, they all noticing Harry's red eyes and how concerned Draco and Cedric appeared to be.
They didn't ask the reason.
"Or worse." Pansy pointed out.
"I have to tell my family... Sirius and my dad are going to freak out."
I appoint my spouse to be Guardian of Hadrian James Potter until he comes of age at eighteen. If my spouse predeceases me, then I appoint Sirius Orion Black of London, England as Guardian of Hadrian Jame Potter until he comes of age at eighteen. If Sirius Orion Black of London, England, is unable to take Guardianship, I appoint Alice Helen Longbottom nee Smith of Cornwall, England as Guardianship of Hadrian James Potter until he comes of age at eighteen.
The Floo flared, and Molly stumbled out, ash covering every inch of her. The moment she arrived she was shrieking, voice like claws on a chalkboard. She was obviously frustrated by his lack of response and she finally reached out, shaking his shoulders violently.
The light that emitted from them was blinding but Harry couldn’t look away, the gold flickering across Neville’s face, turning his eyes to warm honey. Neville stared right back, their foreheads pressed together as if they were trying to become one.
Dumbledore’s voice was flat, his fingernails cutting into the meat of his palms, blood rolling down his hands. “Each year, we have many students who wish to stay over the summer, but we have no right to keep them from their legal guardians. Nor do we have the staff to supervise them over the break. All students must go home to their families.” Towards the end, Dumbledore tried to sound reassuring, but it came out as condescending.
“Neville, he- he asked me to be his brother-” Harry started between sobs, shaking his wrist. Harry didn’t realize both Remus and Sirius were now even more confused, brows knitting into frowns. Harry continued, “And what if- what if he doesn’t accept me now?!”
Lyle spoke up, anxious to change the topic. “Remus, you probably don’t know but, David here is currently working on a research project to cure infected werewolves.”
Fred and George let the tension in their body ease, their hands finally loosening in each other’s grip, hands tingling with the restriction of blood from holding each other so tightly. They smiled over at Bartok as Helix put away the crystal, and passed over a green journal that had Harry’s name in gold on the front. When Bartok looked at them both questioningly, George spoke up, ”It is one of our inventions, it’s a connected journal so that we can talk to Harry while we are apart.” Fred looked over to his twin, George’s smile blinding and Fred couldn’t help how his heart fluttered at the look.
Harry rolled over, face pressed into black wool as he groaned, he had been so comfortable and now he was awake. Harry just wanted to bury himself into Neville’s warmth and fall right back to sleep. But when he heard his friend
The Minister was now just sitting back in his chair, arms crossed and face red as he took in all that was said. Molly looked just as furious, but more so because Harry had dared to yell at the Headmaster. Ron just ignored everything that was happening, sporting the same look he did when he was daydreaming about the Chudley Cannons, and Harry felt nothing but disgust towards the other boy. Here they were discussing the horrific abuse Harry had gone through, and all he could do was think of himself.
“I also have something to give to you that might upset you a bit,” Bartok’s rich baritone commented.
Harry noticed how Draco was staring at him unblinking, he couldn’t help the flush as he looked away. Draco’s ghostly gray eyes had always felt like an arrow through his body, and right now he couldn’t muster the courage to glare back. Instead, he looked over to Neville again, who was still watching Harry, eyes so warm.
Neville just waved his hand, looking sheepish as he answered Harry’s question, voice cracking on the last word. “A bee just landed on me is all.” Harry nodded in understanding, while bees were harmless it was still startling when one landed on you unexpectedly. Harry sat back across from Neville, legs outstretched on either side of Neville’s body and arms behind him holding up his weight. Neville giggled for some unknown reason but soon Harry was following him, both laughing until their bellies ached and their eyes were brimming with tears.
It had been so long, so fucking long, eighteen years.
Harry steadily reddened through their explanation, but he listened carefully, taking mental notes. Harry was reminded of how nice the bidet felt as it cleaned him, and realized being touched there was something he might like. Though he didn’t say this out loud.
Godric was quick to point out that just because his mate was bonding with more people that it didn't mean he would be romantically involved with the others.
Harry turned in Issy’s arms, needing the comfort they offered. Bartok held a small black velvet box with his large hands. Holding it as if it was something precious and it was all Harry could do but to shakily reach out. The box was a little bigger than one of his hands, and it took him a few seconds to open it, fingers running over the soft fabric. Inside was a delicate gold bracelet, attached to the links were small charms that looked like crests. In fact, he noticed that one of the charms was the Ravenclaw crest, a bright sapphire dangling from the bottom.
So this chapter has no Harry so I hope you are all okay with that. Fawkes is revealed though so I hope that makes up for it.
Godric nodded, and even though he was much older than the woman in front of him, she reminded him too much of Rowena for him to not automatically defer to her. Godric had a healthy fear of angered witches. “Yes, Ma’am, I felt the bond that formed earlier and wanted to know what was happening. I assume by your presence Dowager Lady Longbottom, that the bonding I felt earlier was between Harry and your Grandson?”
Bartok looked between the two of them, trying to figure out why they were being punished. They both went pale, Bartok would have no problem telling Anna what happened. “I don’t want to know, do I?”
“Good evening, Minister. I can spare a moment of my time to talk,” Bartok replied even though he wished he could just pop away. If he didn’t do this now, it would only get worse when the man undoubtedly cornered him again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded vigorously, calming draught stopping his ability to cry. Bartok hooked the charm on, the bracelet momentarily glowing silver. Harry jumped up into his Papa’s arms, the older man catching him with ease and holding him tight.
Healer Lorraine seemed to understand Augusta's hesitation to accept her treatment plan, so many others had proposed treatments, promising resulting only for nothing to change. "You probably do not know this, but your son saved my great-granddaughter during the last war in Britain. She was only eight. As a Were-Horse family is the most important thing to me, the least I can do is make sure I do everything I can to see him, if not healed, at least living the best life possible for him."
“How long has it been?” Salazar whispers, trying not to break the contentment but needing to know the answer.
After the man left, Dumbledore made his way back to his office, hoping to try to use the floo to get back into the school, and if not he could try and get Minerva to open the wards for him. But the nervous form of Dedalus Diggle was hunched in front of his door, wringing his hands violently. Dumbledore motioned the man in, summoning a House-Elf to get them tea. Dedalus took in on shaky sip before speaking.
Harry didn’t understand why, he turned to Remus, who only had a light flush to ask a question. “Moony, what is masturbation?”
Anna stayed behind to inform Healer Charlotte of the move while the two Longbottoms solemnly made their way down the well-known hallways. The picture Neville had drawn of his parents with their names below the stick figure renderings of them from when he was six was still on the door to their room. A small stick figure Neville between them with Augusta looming behind them all.
(See the end of the chapter for
His hands skittered away, his dusky nipples already so hard that they ached too much to touch. His flat stomach was shaking, his muscles burning.
Bill had just shushed him, running his hands over his Father’s back.
Finally, five days later, Godric was able to pull him aside to start helping him learn more about what the world now had to offer.
Helga and Rowena, both understanding, sent him up to the sleeping chamber. The old man was so presumptuous in his superiority that he didn’t even have an alarm ward on his chambers to alert him to intruders. The old man was lying on his side, in bright purple pajamas, and Godric wished he could just kill him now. But he knew the truth, and it would be no use to do that and make the man a martyr, for now, he would live. The wand that rightfully belonged to his mate was lying on the nightstand. When Godric gripped it, it buzzed unhappily before realizing his intentions.
Anna sounded just as furious as Harry, but she hid it better, clutching onto her son, trying to comfort them both. “But you, Mr. Dumbledore, were Harry’s self-proclaimed Magical Guardian. When he came to you with accusations of abuse, it was your job to take care of him, both as his Guardian and as Chief Warlock. But obviously, you did nothing to investigate these claims.” Anna snapped.
When he got home, he would need to talk to Sirius about this. When Helix said that the Lupin ring was next, Harry was even more surprised, Harry had never heard that the house of Lupin was one of those ancient houses that had Lordships. And he was confused about why his teacher wouldn’t at least buy himself some new clothes. Harry had noticed just how uncomfortable and embarrassed Moony felt about teaching in his tatty robes, and Harry knew that feeling so well that if he were in the man’s place, he would never be able to be half the teacher Lupin was.
Anna pulled off the silver chain she wore around her neck, obviously used for just this reason as she tapped it and turned it into a Portkey. They had to guide Alice’s shuffling form over to the bed so they could all hold onto the chain. They coaxed Alice into bed, getting her to scooch as close to Frank as possible, and then Anna cast a spell on both Alice and Frank that healers used to stabilize their position for when they moved. And soon, they were being whisked away.
They had yet to talk about what had happened, but Remus suspected, that after the revelations of last night that the distance had not been Sirius’ idea. Remus wished he would have realized it sooner. But there was no way he could. It had been an emotional time for all of them, the world consumed with loss. Each day they listened to the radio and read the papers, worried if they would see a friend among the long list of the dead.
The second one is to swear on your magic, never do this lightly because if you break your Oath, The Lady will take your magic in payment. And while we can live without our magic you will always feel the void where it once was. There are cases of people being driven mad by the loss.
He had spent all his years in Azkaban imagining what they would say to him, their accusations and looks of loathing and disappointment. That more than anything was what the dementors caused him to feel. More than the Cruciatus his Mother had loved so much. More than the look of disgust his Father had worn anytime he saw his son. More than the memory of kneeling in rice, knees bloody, as he learned to read and write.
Sirius wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder, pulling his pup into his side. “Yes, Harry, eventually you will be able to bear children. You won’t be able to until you reach sexual maturity at eighteen when you go through your last magical boost. And if you never want to bear children, or have children at all, that is also perfectly okay.” Sirius wanted to be as careful as possible with his words, wanted to make sure they didn’t push Harry into anything he didn’t want.
“Yes, it was created in such a way that compassion instead of hatred can also fuel it. While it is outlawed, people in certain lines of work have permits to use it. Such as livestock farmers and some healers.” Anna interjected.
“Thank you for meeting me on such short notice,” Bartok reached out to shake his old friend’s hand.
Harry’s mind went straight to Hedwig, and he knew that was who he would be sharing this potion with. Especially since according to David she was his familiar and would be able to speak to him after they visited a Magizoologist. He would have to speak it over with Hedwig once they were able.
At least with all his heart, Harry wanted to believe they wouldn’t take part in such a thing.
But when he tried to open the doors the wards flung him back, causing him to land in the middle of the muggle street. He was quick to cast a Notice-Me-Not ward and start blasting at the door. But the Black wards were ancient and formidable. The blood of every Black born sacrificed to strengthen them until it was an unbreakable fortress. That, however, didn’t stop him from trying.
“Worry not Godric,” The oldest painting in the room spoke up. “You know what we truly are and that we are not loyal to the old man.”
Harry looked down at his plate, not sure he wanted to be the one to talk but wanting Sirius and Remus to know the truth. Bartok looked at him searchingly and Harry nodded slowly and grabbed Remus’ hand within his. Sirius sensing the mood and scooted closer to Harry wrapping an arm around his shoulder for support.
, to ease his fury. None of the men across from him looked anything but approving of his protective urges. With how closely the Weasleys had been linked to Dumbledore, Bartok had expected them to be disgusted by the reveal of him being a creature. But they weren’t and this was another point in their favor.
Anna’s forest green eyes were piercing, making anyone she looked at feel like a specimen she was studying. Her eyes roamed over every part of Harry and David, checking for injuries, ever the healer. Her brilliant red hair, which made Harry miss the twins keenly, fell down to her back. And her moonlight skin was speckled with constellations of freckles. The milky way mapped across her body.
“Back to judging Magical Contracts. The Lady, if called upon, will judge illegal contracts, but she can only do it if called upon, unlike Oaths. And if you were to sign the contract thinking there was no way out, it would then become legal, no matter if it was false, to begin with. We believe this is what Dumbledore was hoping would happen.” Remus laid a hand over Neville’s tightening fist, Harry not noticing, too busy questioning how he could have been so wrong about the Headmaster. Ron and Hermione had never mentioned such things to him even though he was sure it was something they both would have known, especially Ron.
“Of course not!” one of the twins said, obviously upset at even the thought of doing something like that.
Molly was obviously panicked but the potion did its job and was soon spilling her secrets. “The only reason we are being charged is that he turned into a filthy creature!” Molly screeched.
Bartok marched out of Courtroom Ten, trying his best to hold his rage in. He was escorting his clients out of the Ministry, they were haggard and scared of the wizards around them. All wizards and witches who were blood traitors, those who betrayed their family history by standing against creatures, were glaring at their group.
Lastly was Lyle, he also had freckled, but they were lightly spattered across his nose, much like David. He was clean-shaven with long fingers cradling his strong jaw. Eyes as dark as coal, lite with the inner fire of mischief. At first glance, one might think him ordinary, but it was the light in his eyes that changed all of his features.
, do not forget that.” With a flash of green and a hasty utterance, they were gone.
It was utterly still in Harry’s hands, and before any of them could try and warn their son to wait, to give Lyle the time to scan it for dark spells, the box was open. Everyone held their breath, watching in fear as Harry reached in and lifted what was inside.
“That is the end of the Will reading, keys will now be distributed.” Helix stashed the two Wills in his top desk drawer. Neville and Remus approached Harry, David, Bartok, and Anna vacating the couch so that the two could sit on either side of Harry. As soon as they were in reach Harry latched onto one of their arms each, holding them close to his chest. Harry noticed the blockade Bartok, David, and Percival made in front of the couch hiding Harry from view. He was immensely thankful, as he started to break down in tears, Remus pulling him into his lap and Neville resting their foreheads together. Neville had tears running down his face as well, but his eyes were full of care.
“Then what was he doing?” Harry asked cautiously. If he needed to Harry would protect Sirius with everything he had.
This is one of the things he couldn’t abide, so with a heavy heart he spoke again, “Bill will you
"Good morning, Neville, did you sleep well? How is Harry? Bartok told me what happened last night when he retrieved the cloak." Anna asked, leading the way towards the dining room where his Gran was the only one sitting down, sipping her tea.
He made a decision and swam towards the girl. He grabbed her body and held it closer to his. He tried to swim again, but something held his foot and when he looked down, he saw a creature holding him back.
"I love this idea. It's been while since i last listened to one of your songs. I miss them, they're always so sweet."
Harry always made everyone feels valid, worthy, he always made anyone - literally anyone - feels like they are not alone and that they belong anywhere they want to be, that they can be anywhere they want to be. Harry always made everyone feels loved and cared for, and he - without even realizing or knowing it - made everyone love and care about him. The boy was the real definition of a happy, safe, protected, comfortable and love place. Cause that's how he made people feel around him - happy, safe, protected, comfortable and loved -. If there's something anyone can say is that his family, friends, - for Merlin's sake, even someone who had just met the boy - wants to see him happy, comfortable, safe... the people who knew Harry, they all just wanted to always see him smiling and being the incredible person he had always been. And they would do literally anything to make sure that that's what would happen.
"We could play something. It is always fun." He said and looked around, everyone agreed.
They stayed in a comfortable silence for a few more minutes, before Harry glanced at the table and asked in a low tone:
They all nodded. They were good.
"You are more than capable to succeed this task, Harry. We know that." She held his hand again and squeezed it softly.
"Please, come up here, Mister Potter."
"Love?" The boy heard his boyfriend's voice, he heard it, but he couldn't focus on it. His thoughts going to what he would do if he gets hurt - if he dies - in the second task because of how Harry couldn't save him. He couldn't - he couldn't - lose Draco. He just couldn't.
"That... actually would make sense." Draco agreed and he glanced at his boyfriend. Noticing something was off, he touched Harry's knee with his own, and he saw how the younger boy relaxed a bit at the touch.
"Not at all. I mean, i love all of you guys, so i really don't know." Cedric answered.
Reminder: English's not my first language, so if there's any mistakes, I'm really sorry, love!
(See the end of the chapter for
They stared at each other for a few seconds, thinking how lucky they were to have each other; thinking how badly they loved each other.
The others did the same.
"Indeed i am, my love." Draco answered, smiling.
"It's the same as Luna and Ginny's. I mean, they also spent the entire weekend together here in the castle, doing cheesy and romantic stuff. How are the four of you so lucky?" Blaise pointed out, putting a piece of fruit inside his mouth.
"He gave you a prank ideas book?" Harry asked, amused.
"-kay, don't try to talk, just focus on me and try to breathe with me, okay? You are safe, Harry. We're all safe, love." His boyfriend was in front of him, kneeled in front of him, holding both his hands.
"It was good, they're scared now too." Harry explained and held Draco's hand, bringing it closer to his lips as he pressed a soft kiss on it.
Draco nodded and held his hand, squeezed it a bit and leaned his forehead against Harry's.
"Who wants chocolate frogs?" Neville asked all of a sudden, breaking the comfortable silence the room had fell in.
"Do you want to talk, Harry?" The boy only shook his head and she smiled softly, an empathetic look on her eyes.
That was when the Claremores finally stepped forward, Lyle stealing Harry back, mumbling under his breath about how Harry was his, and the rest just greeted Neville and his Gran. Harry continued to stare at Neville from over Lyle’s shoulder giving a small wave and smile.
Once they finished Fred and George cleaned up while Arthur headed to the living room so they could talk to each other. Arthur took up his old, but plush chair and the boys were soon sitting together on the loveseat. Arthur knew the twin’s relationship wasn’t that of normal brothers. But he also knew they were magical twins and that they shared a soul like his best friends, Fabian and Gideon.
Godric just watched this byplay with a small smirk on his face. Issy was now climbing into Anna’s lap, arms crossed.
“All abuse cases are handled quickly and as privately as possible. Madam Bones worked the case herself, and if she didn’t feel like you needed to be informed, it was not our job to do so.” Anna continued as if the man hadn’t even spoken. Harry curled further into Anna’s side, not liking that his treatment was being so openly stated but knowing it was one of the only ways to assure he wasn’t separated from his family.
Arthur was the first to gather his thoughts, only able to whisper out a broken, “What?” He was absolutely devastated. His children were his life. And it wasn’t that Arthur wouldn’t love any of his children if they weren’t his, the reason it hurt so much was both the way he found out and that Ginny seemed to not consider him to be her parent at all, even though he had done all he could to raise her.
He was in his Hogwarts robes, top two buttons undone and tie hanging loosely around his neck. His grin reminded Harry strongly of Fred and George, that same mischievous streak they had. His glasses were just as bulky as Harry’s old ones had been but somehow on his much more masculine face, they seemed right at home.
Harry nodded, cheeks a dark red, “And you’re sure… it’s okay to be gay, and that no one will hate me for it?” Harry seemed so much younger than he really was at that moment, like a child who had just broken a vase and was worried his parents would hate him for it.
“Mistress Anna told you two not to be too rough with young Master Harry,” Tiptop scolded.
Harry gently reach out to lift the parchment, the same magic he had felt moments before making his fingertips tingle. He lifted the perfectly circular seal as delicately as he could as to not destroy it.
Helga gave a battle cry from her spot, looking more like the Viking princess she was then she did even on the battlefield. “Onwards!”
The skin from his forearms down was slowly turning black, red sales bursting through his skin and fingernails turning to talons that could disembowel in one swipe. “When I saw Harry at the Welcoming Feast I knew something was very wrong. But then you used that damned spell to make me ignore it! And beyond that, you ordered me to treat him no better than a worm. You dared force me to belittle and insult him!”
Harry was surprised how short the new contract was but then it was straight to the point and Harry couldn’t imagine what else would be needed. Harry then realized something, “Why would Mrs. Weasley’s last name in this be Prewett?”
And suddenly Remus was alone, his parents having died long ago and the family he had built for himself, destroyed from the inside. Werewolves were not meant to be alone.
Lastly, they blood locked the room, only allowing direct kin to enter the room, and even then they wouldn’t be able to make any changes to the wards.
Augusta looked over at Neville, silently asking for his opinion. Neville was surprised she had even thought to include him in this but he was glad she did. “I think we should listen to Mrs. Claremore’s advice, she knows more about the healers in Terradore and healing in general.” Augusta nodded at him and Anna, who told both Longbottoms to call them by their first names, and started planning a trip to the clinic in question later that day. Neville asked to go along as well, a proud glint to his Grandmother’s eyes when he asked.
Neville watched impatiently as his Gran settled her hat on her head. He would have tried to rush the women along if he didn’t have a healthy fear of her. Once they exited the floo they had to wait for a Goblin to lead them to the meeting room. Neville’s hands shook more violently with each step they took, soon he would see his friend again. And maybe… he would have the confidence to tell Harry just how he felt.
“That was my last question for you,” Bartok stated, looking at them to see if there was anything else they needed to question. There was nothing else they need to know, all relaxed that these strangers only wanted what was best for Harry.
It took Dumbledore a few seconds of furious blinking, in which time the creatures rathered up their belongings and started to leave, for him to get together enough to drag Fudge and two Aurors after them. Now more than ever it was essential to confront Bartok Claremore, hopefully just being confronted by their party in the Ministry itself would be enough to get what he wanted.
For so long he had ignored his wolf, had even thought it was trying to drive him insane with its nonstop howling for its mate. Remus had been so confused as to why his wolf would mourn the man when he was the reason they had lost their alpha pair and their cub. But his wolf, in its animalistic way, insisted that Sirius would never betray the pack.
The blonde was caressing the back of the younger boy's hand, it was a sweet, simple gesture he knew how much Harry loved and appreciated.
"Yeah, i mean, what is this charm?" Ron asked.
All of them had camomile tea cups on their hands, drinking it to feel calmer after the stressful day they all had.
"You were supposed to only take ME out of there! You fucking reckless idiot! You could had... i don't know!" He punched his chest again, he was terrified. He felt terrified when he opened his eyes and didn't see his boyfriend around.
“Thank you for taking care of him,” He had to restart multiple times because of how hoarse his voice was from centuries of disuse. When he could finally speak, it was barely above a whisper, but he knew all the Claremore clan could easily hear him, the room deadly silent. He looked at the man who he had first meet and pulled away to help his mate. “And you, I owe you a life debt beyond anything I can ever fulfill, but I will try my hardest.”
Sirius barked out a rough laugh, face messy with snot and tears but a gentle smile on his face. “It looks like Moony and I will have to give the pup the talk.” He smiled at Remus, still heartbroken but seeing the silver lining in the fact that he could now be there for his Godson and that Harry was safe. Sirius realized Remus was looking behind him and he turned to see what it was.
Ron was the one to speak up, mocking smile in place, “You aren’t our Father.”
Augusta sipped her tea, looking over the rim with piercing eyes, “Mr. Claremore, I assume we will be welcome in your home for a while to allow the boys’ bond to settle?”
Arthur was surprised but he didn’t think there was anything wrong with Harry if it was true. He couldn’t believe Molly would think such a thing when both of their families had a history of creature members.
Bartok grinned at his son, knowing Harry wanted to do his best to respect the gift he was given. Ever since they gave Harry the Claremore charm for his birthday, their son had done everything he could to learn about their family, all sides of it. They had all spent time telling Harry about their respective families, Harry had been fascinated. Lyle had sneakily told Harry more about his little brother Siles because they all knew that they would be married one day.
your boy,” Harry hissed. When he first met the man Harry had enjoyed that Dumbledore called him that. It gave him a connection he had always longed for, but now the thought of it made his stomach churn. Dumbledore ignored this entirely though as if Harry never even said a thing.
“You dare send Lily a letter saying I didn’t wish to speak to her! After all you made me do, made me turn against my friends and loved ones, made me treat the students like dirt! Made me turn a blind eye to abuse and injustice. Made me brew extremely dark, Black magic potions. I didn’t think you could fall further. But to dare allow Lily to die thinking I hated her, and then to make me seem like a monster to her son, that is your greatest sin!”
“Have him killed of course,” Ron said completely nonchalantly, as he scratched at his stomach.
That was the only time he ever saw the wonderful key that opened up a world of possibilities.
With all the guests gone, Issy seemed to finally have enough of holding her tongue. She began squealing loudly, causing Harry to jump from his place on her chest. But she was pulling him back in, Lyle and David joining them in the sudden group hug. Harry was very confused at their excitement, but she soon cleared that up. “Oh Harry, seeing you bond was spectacular! He is so handsome, and we are all so happy for you!”
After a while, Harry’s tears long since stopped and a satisfied smile back on his face, David finally spoke up. “Come on, we have to get up for the day, Tiptop planned a really nice breakfast for you.”
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter. While it's not much on the plot it has a bunch of world-building and background information.
By the time he had collected himself his joints all felt wobbly, like if he didn’t balance his weight just so they would collapse under him and his left third toe was tingling strangely. But all he wanted was to crawl under the covers and hold Harry. But he couldn’t so he just scooting a little farther onto the bed until his hand was touching Harry’s, too tired to consider what he had just done with that hand.
... of the day he would be free to make them in real life.
In his closet Arthur kept a locked box, in it he kept mementos from each of his children, a picture from Hogwarts of Fabian, Gideon and himself, a vial of liquid luck his Father had given him on his deathbed and a vial of illegal truth serum.
“That and doing this will make sure there is no way they can legally take Harry from us. All we have to do is get through this meeting.” This was when Bartok noticed how still Harry had gone, his hands in tight balls on either side of his empty plate, the worry in his eyes dulled by the calming draught. “Harry, come here,” Bartok instructed, motioning for his son to come sit in his lap. Harry obeyed without any fuss, crawling into Bartok’s warm embrace.
“Really?” Harry asked once again just to double check.
When they reached the front gates she enfolded him within her deceptively strong arms, reaching up on her tiptoes to press a kiss to his forehead. Severus was startled, unsure of what to do. But she soon pulled back, hand open and waiting for him to return her wand. Severus pulled out the fir wand, looking at it for a moment before returning it, handle out.
Also, note in this story Hogwarts begins at 13 and ends at 19. Their first year combines the curriculum for the original 1 and 2 year since they are older and can handle the busier schedule.
When the door to the room opened once more Remus turned faster than anyone, hackles rising at the thought that the person entering could be a danger to his cub. But it wasn’t, it was just another one of his previous students and their guardian.
Also, Oliver just happened, I don't know how, he just decided he wanted to be part of the harem.
Neville was up early that morning, Harry still sleeping against his side with an arm and leg wrapped over Neville's body. He wished he could just stay in the soft bed and enjoy his mate’s comfort. But Anna and his Grandmother scheduled an appointment with his parents’ healers early this morning to discuss their findings and what they planned to do to help them. Augusta had given Neville the choice of whether to go or not, but he had quickly insisted he wanted to go with them.
They stood there, enveloped in each other and enjoying the company.
First Albus went to Grimmauld Place, ready to capture the two men inside and deliver them to the Ministry. He planned to claim Remus, a dangerous beast who had almost killed students at the end of the year was now hiding mass murder, Sirius Black. He was sure that Fudge would be too overjoyed to finally have caught Sirius to ask any questions before throwing them both to the dementors.
Harry sat in shock, Professor Snape had only acted horribly towards him because of Dumbledore. It was too much to consider. He hated the Professor and to now find out that hatred was misplaced Harry didn’t know what to do about it.
“Will you be staying until Harry wakes?” David asked, wondering what his son would think of this man suddenly showing up.
Lastly, Dorea went over both male and female pregnancy. Harry was shocked to learn that certain men could get pregnant when Sirius saw his confusion he was quick to pause the memory once again.
Harry just stood there, unsure of what to do and how to feel. Ever since he had been rescued by the Claremores, he had been constantly overwhelmed by their generosity and care. At this point, he shouldn’t be surprised but he can’t help it. Harry wiped his eyes where tears were starting to form and instead pulled both of his Mums into a hug, whispering thanks as he did. They just assured him there is no need for thanks but Harry wanted them to never doubt how grateful he was for all they did for him. Harry never wanted them to think he took all they did for granted.
Harry was still focused on the grounds outside, more so on the abundant number of Juliet roses. Petunia had kept a magazine on the most beautiful gardens in the world on the coffee table. Harry had often snuck glances at the pages inside and he distinctly remembered seeing that particular species of rose before because of the lengthy article that mentioned just how expensive the plant was.
He clenched and unclenched each muscle, getting used to their movement under his skin.
Godric flamed back into the Hogwarts’ Headmaster office, the school wards welcoming him in like a child would a long-missed parent. When they first built the castle and made the wards she wasn’t sentient, it hadn’t been until after 500 years of absorbing wild magic and the excess from spells being continuously cast that Godric had first heard her voice. He tried to speak to her, but she couldn’t understand him in his Phoenix form. The best Godric could do was to sing to her.
Salazar was then bouncing up and away as if nothing had happened. As if Godric’s come wasn’t smeared across his lips, merely licking it away with Godric still laying on the floor, sweaty, panting, and with white spots filling his vision. Salazar had pranced around both the lab and the library, giggling away at everything he found like a child given a new broom.
As soon as it had started, it was over, and no matter how they tried, none of the older Claremores could move to try and protect their son or each other. But as the foreign magic faded, they all regained the use of their bodies and were rushing towards Harry who was still within Issy’s arm.
Time started moving again and they were running towards each other, Harry jumping into his arms and wrapping his legs around Neville’s torso. Their foreheads came to rest against each other, eyes both tearing up as a golden light burst from within them, surrounding them like a warm blanket, Its embrace cozy and comforting.
Augusta's fist tightened around the fabric of her robe. To know that her children spent all these years in a state of stress so bad it had weakened their hearts, made her furious at the healers of St. Mungos for never realizing this. But at the same time, she wasn't mad at them, they had always done their best, their best just hadn't been good enough.
So, for now, Godric was slowly easing Salazar into the new world he would soon find himself in. He bought Sal sets of Muggle and Magical encyclopedia that covered a hundred years of history and development a book. Salazar had always possessed the same thirst for knowledge that Rowena did, though his want wasn’t just for knowledge for knowledge’s sake, so he was making his way through the books quickly.
David went back to the original question when he saw Harry’s mood start to drop. “As for the wand itself it is said to be the strongest wand ever made, and considering some of what the Peverell family achieved, I am inclined to believe that myth. No one knows what it is made from other than elder wood, it has been a puzzle wandmaker have tried to solve over the years. But because of this, the wand has had a bloody history. The last known Peverell to wield it was Antioch himself, rumor says he was killed for the wand. Myths also say that the wand gives its loyalty to those who conquer their last owner, but it is also said that as a Peverell artifact it is only loyal to the bloodline of those who created it. And considering the earlier spectacle, we can now assume this is also true.”
“This was your Father’s childhood room in Potter Manor, the memory is paused if you would like to look around.” Sirius was gentle in the suggestion, not sure if Harry would want to look around or just move on to the talk.
“What… Can I?” Harry asked, unable to finish his question but needing to know. One of his most secret of dreams was to have a large family. So even though he was terrified at the thought of bearing children, it also as delighted him, though he was nowhere near ready for children. Harry didn’t think he could take care of himself, let alone a helpless child.
Neville had a hand wrapped around one of Harry’s thin ankles, grip just short of bruising but Harry didn’t complain, it felt grounding. That was when Neville leaned forward, hands coming together as if he was cupping water within them. Harry watched closely, curious as to what his friend was doing. He watched in awe as calming green magic pooled into Neville’s hands, slowly taking shape and forming into a single rose.
“We can talk about it later, for now, we have people to heal.” Anna’s tone was whip-like in its intensity. Godric wasn’t offended because he understood her laser-like focus on the task at hand. “Though if he went through anything like you, he will also be needing a checkup.”
Godric and Salazar stayed with Bartok, David, and Augusta in the sitting room, taking the now vacated sofa. “I assume you both came here to do more than tell us about Lord Black’s previously unknown condition?” Augusta asked, curiosity not completely stamped out by her protective streak.
The reason I haven't gotten much writing done is that I can't take my Adderall so it is hard for me to focus. Along with that my depression has gotten worse, I will be going to get my anti-depressants upped, and so I have been sleeping a lot and feeling unmotivated. Along with the heart meds making me sleepy in general.
Bartok relaxed back into his chair, he had asked his question in such a way that anything they might know would set it off. The money theft, abuse, or the contract. But since they had all been telling the truth his mind eased. He only had a few more questions he needed to ask to make sure that these people would be safe to have around his son.
"I still can't believe i won." Harry said suddenly, his voice was sleepy, he was. The blonde kissed the top of his head and smiled softly.
"How do you know that?!" Cedric seemed like he was going to faint, same as everyone else.
"I already freaked out when Hagrid told me, don't worry." The boy glanced at his boyfriend and sighed softly, seeing how terrified Draco was. He took his hand on his own and kissed the back of it.
"Come here." The brunette said, he softly took the book Draco was reading away from his hands, closed it and put it away. He brought Draco closer to him, letting him lay on his arms, his head on his chest and put his arms around his boyfriend's body.
"Very well. Boys, we just wanted to say that there's nothing we can do to stop it from happening and that Harry will be participating of the tournament. He'll have the same help as the other participants and the same chances and opportunities during the tasks. End of it." He said, his eyes moving towards the adults in the room, who were practically murdering him with their looks.
(See the end of the chapter for
The blonde sat by his side and put his hand on his cheek, he caressed it softly and kissed Harry's lips. It was a passionate and soft kiss. It made Harry feel good.
"What histories can we read tonight?" Theo asked while adjusting soft pillows and blankets he and George had "acciod" around the floor with Hermione and Cedric.
The boys sat down and Draco started adding food on his and Harry's plates.
"As you should." She muttered and looked at Draco, arching her eyebrow.
"Hum... morning." The blonde said while he yawned and he sat up, looking around. Everyone was almost falling back asleep. He looked at Harry and held his cheeks softly, before pecking his lips calmly.
"Details still." Draco said and took a sip of his juice.
Too late, it's gone, it won't come back."
"Harry, my boy, would you follow me, please. And yes, Mister Malfoy, you can join us, my boy." The two of them followed the professor around the castle.
"I love you, too." They kissed again.
"Good." James took a deep breath and he brought his son closer to him again. "I love you, if anything happens, send us a letter and we'll come here right away."
"Perfect." And Draco did at the same time. They looked at each other and chuckled.
"Or worse." Blaise grinned.
"Mate, you are not at all a burden to any of us." Harry looked at his friends, noticing how all lf them had a worried look on their eyes.
"I love you."
"I promise." He said and a small smile appeared on his lips.
"Are you threatening me, Lily?"
"Shh, just a few more minutes... " Harry muttered, sleepy as fuck.
Said that, i hope you had a lovely reading and i hope you're safe and well! Have a good day/night, my love!
"Who would do that?" Hermione was the first to say something soon as they arrived the library.
"Me too."
"We're starting!" The twins said, together again.
Harry felt a hand on his shoulder, but he couldn't concentrate.
The boy sighed silently and stopped in front of a book, he grabbed it and stared at it. 'Mental Health: disorders, diseases and what we need to know about it' was the name of the book. He opened the first page and decided he was going to read that. He wanted to know - to understand - what was happening to him.
We've taken what you'll sorely miss,
1) Harry's mental health will get much worse before it gets better. I put that on the tags, but i think it is important to remind you of that.
The older boy pressed a kiss on Harry's shoulder as he cuddled closer to him.
"I'm exhausted." Draco said one night.
The boy was caught out of guard, he didn't know how to answer.
Draco kissed his boyfriend's forehead and caressed his hair, a caring look on his eyes.
"I think I've never been happier for reading that prank ideas book that Fred gave to me few weeks ago."
"You're lucky i love you more than anything." He muttered in a fake annoyed voice and laid by his boyfriend's side, back hugging him.
"He and George. But not the point. The point is, i think we should have a little bit of fun with dear Umbridge. If she's just gonna walk around and punish us for doing nothing, we could do the same."
Everyone else was out too, some went to Hogsmade together and others went out with their families or something.
"Right? I mean, imagine spending an entire weekend with the person you love the most, doing all you both, or more them two people, i don't know... that's not the point! But just imagine... fuck, that's romantic and cheesy as hell." Blaise said, a funny look on his eyes.
"Maybe some adventure." Fred said and he threw himself on the blankets, George did the same and in a matter of minutes, they were all on the floor, blankets covering them, lots of pillows around, it was comfortable. And when Luna and Ginny got back and laid there too, they all felt at home. It was home. They were all each other's home.
"Untill that happens, we all just want you both to keep taking care of each other and making sure you and your friends are safe and okay." Lily said, putting her arm around Draco's shoulder and squeezing it softly. Draco could see through her eyes how concerned she was about Harry, he understood.
"Umbridge's looking at us." Theo said.
We cannot sing above the ground,
"Actually, we were too concerned about it all to even remember these... details."
"I love you." Harry smiled and put their lips together for a few seconds, before pulling apart and looking at Draco's eyes.
"You're with me again?"
He felt his boyfriend's other hand fingers running through his hair, stroking it gently.
"You're with us again?" The boy only nodded, not noticing the concerned looks Draco and Cedric shared.
6) This chapter got sooo long i had to separate it in two parts! Next part will be posted next week, i guess.
"It, hum... it provides the person who uses it an airtight chamber of oxygen, it's the best option and spell for breathing underwater. If that makes sense." Luna explained calmly.
"I think that until now, Dumbledore is being an idiot. He definitely could take you out of it." Fred said and George nodded, before saying:
Draco wouldn't stop reading books, trying to find something that would help his boyfriend and Cedric during the task. Hermione and Theo were doing the same. Everyone was.
"Do you have any idea about who's your host?" Fred asked the boy, who denied.
"I love you." Harry said, while carefully caressing Draco's hair. The said one smiled and looked into his eyes too.
"I mean, all the shit that happened first and second year, he could had stopped it, avoided at least. He knew about everything all the time." Theo said.
"Ah! Come here, I'll help you." He said after recovering from the laughing attack he had. Harry was staring at him with an offended look - and honestly, when he saw his boy's look, he only laughed more - all the time.
"You're kidding, Potter. It can't be bloody dragons!"
"Well, i wish i was kidding." He mumbled and grabbed a chocolate frog.
"Hey, let's go to the library, shall we? It's calmer there." Ron got closer and he put his hand on Harry's back, who nodded and leaned his body a bit against his best friend's. Cedric followed them all and Fleur and Krum had disappeared at some point, probably went to the discussion on the great hall.
And he knew Harry felt the same for him, because they had always been like that. That's just how they always worked.
"We're so dumb." Draco chuckled and rolled his eyes.
"And i need to take care of you. I need to find something that'll help you."
Leave kudos and comment if you'd like.
"Hey, look at me. Harry? Love, please don't do that again." Draco said and Harry glanced at him, making him sigh in relief.
Of course, he didn't tell any of them about the constant pressure he felt on his chest; he didn't tell them about how his heart was always beating so fast he was scared it would kill him somehow; he didn't tell them, he felt already so guilty about making them all worrying about him so bad, he didn't want to make it worse.
"Hey, I'm doing good, mom. How's everyone? I miss you, all of you.
Things were not completely lost.
"I don't.... !"
Draco pressed Harry's body against the bathroom wall and put his hands on his waist, kissing him in a desperate and passionate way.
and went with her when Dobby got there.
"Definitely, and then we can study them a bit and understand better this whole situation." Draco said and he kissed Harry's lips before standing up and walking towards one of the book sections while Hermione walked towards another.
Lots of love and hugs for you! ❤️🥺
Harry shared a look with Cedric and they look at the three of them again.
Suddenly, Harry felt more arms around him, around him and Draco. It was their friends. They were all hugging him, a group hug. And for now, that's all he needed.
"Library night?" They all looked at him, before a crowd of "yes", "sure!", and "Of course!"'s were heard around the room.
"You stupid thing! Do you have something against me? Argh!" The brunette cried. And Draco laughed. Badly.
Harry and Draco only listened to their friends with a soft smile on their lips. Well, they weren't wrong. It was cheesy and romantic as hell, their relationship.
"Thank you so much." She said again and let him go, going back to her sister.
I also hope you had a wonderful reading!
Harry chuckled a bit before yawning.
Dumbledore started talking, and Harry couldn't focus on anything he was saying, but at some point, the man said something and then, a discussion started amongst the professors, at the same time, the great hall erupted with too much loud, everyone going crazy because "why was Harry Potter, a fourteen year old boy, going to participate of the triwizard tournament?".
"That's good."
Hermione's eyes went wide and she slapped her forehead.
He felt so in peace, so loved and so safe during these moments. In fact, he always felt that way around Harry. Since they were just little kids, Harry always made him feel safe, loved, protected, in peace. He always felt so lucky to have his boy in his life. He loved him, so fucking much.
So, yeah, Draco and Harry definitely had all the day for themselves. That felt good. Peaceful.
"Damn, morning, bird lovers." Pansy said, a funny look on her eyes and a grin on her lips.
"Good, me neither."
"You are all idiots, honestly. I'm starving more, now come on, I don't wanna die because I'm hungry." Pansy said and they all cast a cleansing spell on themselves and went to the great hall.
"My mom's going to freak out too." The blonde said.
"Well, i did, but she doesn't remember." Both teens chuckled.
In a desperate act, Harry grabbed his wand and cast a spell on the creatures. When they stopped moving, the boy started swimming back to the surface.
"Can you breathe?" The girl asked, seeing how Harry's breathing had slowed down and how tired he seemed to be. He nodded.
"I love you." He replied in a soft tone.
A soft moan cut his thoughts and he felt Harry moving, without stopping their kiss and in a matter of seconds, the younger boy was on his lap. Both legs on each side of Draco's waist and his arms around the older one's neck.
"I love you, too."
I don't have much to say today, just, you know, next chapter is going to be SO GAY AND FLUFFY (sorry, not sorry)! Oh, and just saying, I'm having such a good time writing this work, like, idk, i just feel really good about it. My writing is not the best, the plot is also not the best, but I'm proud of myself and I'm happy.
The blonde rolled his eyes and - he didn't even notice - pouted.
"He could and should, but he won't. Why?" Fred finished:
"Love...?" His own voice sounded so raw, it hurt to speak, it hurt because his throat felt like someone had strangled him, although nothing had happened.
"I will, but it was not my name who was forced by someone inside the Goblet, i want to participate, i want to do this, Harry doesn't."
"She's warning you that if anything happens to my godson, things are not going to be pretty, specially because if there's someone who can change the tournament rules, the said person is you." Remus said.
"Do you want to read, watch, play..?" Ron asked, sitting at Harry's left side, Pansy did the same and sat at his right side.
"I knew you'd won. And i told you. Multiple times, in fact." The other boy looked at his eyes and a soft smile appeared on his lips.
"They're probably gonna worry a lot, just like we do." Hermione explained, looking at Harry with a soft look on her eyes.
"Yeah, we should do that... " He agreed, the ghost of a smile on his lips. Although he didn't think he was going to rest that night, he was exhausted for sure, but something was still wrong inside his mind, keeping him from even closing his eyes after Theo and Blaise went to their beds and he and Draco laid down, his boyfriend holding him tightly, caressing his back and just being close. Draco fell asleep, but Harry hadn't closed his eyes yet, he couldn't.
"It's sweet. I like the idea, i want to live it one day with someone." Theo thought out loud.
"I will." Draco said and they all knew the blonde didn't really like reading out loud for all of them - just for Harry - but tonight Harry was not okay, and Draco just wanted to comfort his boyfriend. And they all also knew how Harry loved and felt in peace when his boyfriend read something for him.
"You're scared because of the task, right? Having Draco there for so long, i can imagine how you must be feeling." The tears fell from his eyes and she put her hand on his face, whipping the tears from there.
They all hated how he always did that.
"No matter what, if we have candies and we're all together, we're going to be okay." Ginny added to the conversation, finishing it.
Harry wondered what Siles could be looking for when the man answered Harry noticed Siles looking at him out of the corner of his eye. “Yes, recently in fact,” Siles drawled.
He said goodbye before being swept through the floo once more.
Hedwig bobbed her head in answer and began chattering at him.
“How could you?! Harry is like a son to us?” Arthur screamed at her, still unable to believe what Molly had done.
The reason why Bartok was so irate was the hearing had been scheduled for tomorrow, and this had been planned for months now. But this morning, an hour before lunch, a letter arrived from the Ministry informing him of the change.
But Tiptop popped in, putting their discussion on hold, another feast behind her. She sat, table setting itself. They all made their plates and started to eat, but David picked back up the conversation.
Arthur pocketed the vial and headed back downstairs, studying both Ron and Ginny’s closed doors as he passed.
Godric wasn't sure how Salazar would take the idea of sharing Godric with more people. He had already had problems with the idea of Godric having another mate, and that was the only reason Godric had yet to tell him about Harry. But he couldn't put it off any longer.
I am on everyday.
The trance was broken, and suddenly he heard the commotion his family was making. He looked up into Issy’s wide, terrified eyes. “Mummy? What’s wrong?” Harry started to panic in the face of his families terror. Head spinning around as he looked into each of his parent’s face. They all look like they had just seen someone be mauled, and Harry didn’t understand what was going on.
Harry was about to go on the attack but he was stopped by the sound of his Godfather laughing, he looked down, Sirius rolling around under his feet, smile wide and eyes bright. The laughter was like the barking of an overly excited dog. Harry frowned, and looked over to Remus who had a hand over his eyes while his face was red. Harry looked back at Sirius who was now wheezing between laughs, yelling that if it didn’t stop he would piss himself.
“Fudge was clearly blindsided,” Bartok noted, rubbing at his chin.
On the day before the meeting, Harry was sitting bundled up in a pile of blankets in the Floo Room with a good book. Harry didn’t realize it, but Tiptop kept sneakily refilling his drink and plate of small nibbles, and because of the distraction of a good book, he didn’t even notice how much he ate.
Anna suggested they eat the cake and ice cream Tiptop made while they all calmed down. Harry was relieved she suggested that because if he didn’t have this break, Harry was sure he would break down.
“Mr. Dumbledore, you will find that, since our hosts have committed no crime and have already asked you to leave, you are now trespassing. And I, as a Head Auror have every right to take you into custody if you do not vacate these premises within a minute,” Percival stated calmly, raising his wand a fraction and shifting into a dueling stance.
Tiptop was the one trying to keep them all together, going about her knitting as if nothing was going on. The yarn, a fuzzy baby Alpaca fur, she was using the same color as Harry’s gem-toned eyes. She was also quietly humming to herself, an old song she would sing when Issy woke from a nightmare in her youth.
And that was when Sal asked to know more about Godric's mate. At first, Godric was hesitant in what he said, but the more he went on, the easier it was to talk about Harry. Salazar didn't seem bitter as he asked more questions. His curiosity real and the more he found out, the more Sal seemed to like Harry, at the end when he said he would really like to meet him there was nothing but true happiness in his words.
By the time Molly finally came back Arthur was at his seat at the head of the table, a pot of tea in front of him and newspaper at his side. Arthur had had to take a calming draught to make sure he didn’t give the game away.
“And this is your sitting room, that door-” Issy pointed towards another set of double doors, “Leads to your study. There is a small library within, you and your mates will have to fill it up. But there is plenty of room for all of you.” She then led them over to another set of doors, turning to him and smiling like the Cheshire Cat. Opening the doors slowly as she said, “And this, this is your bedroom!”

returns.” Severus had rarely heard Minerva use her native language of Scottish Gaelic, and he was sure whatever she had just said wasn’t a compliment by the venom in her tone.

With the news of Dumbledore's threats planned to be released to the public, Percival had been appointed to be a bodyguard for Harry and the rest of the Claremores. They didn't want to risk Dumbledore or any of his followers going after any of them in retaliation. They all doubted anyone would be able to get into Garden Hill both because it was well guarded and because no one knew that is where the Claremores were currently living. Regardless, they all didn't want to take any chances and being family friends with the Claremores, Percival was the first to volunteer.
Arthur still blushed when he thought back on it, ashamed he had fallen apart in front of his child. He was a parent and he had to be strong in his children’s eyes. It had been something Arthur had strived for every day. When Molly quit her job when she was pregnant with Ron, Arthur had been understanding. And when Ginny followed not even a year later, it had made sense for her to stay home, she had already had five children after all and Ron and Ginny’s pregnancies were much harder on her. But then she never went back, and Arthur was left to pick up all the slack. When they first got together she and Arthur had promised each other that they would both contribute to the household income so that they could both spend time with their children.
When they entered the courtroom with fifteen minutes to spare, he could see the disappointment and disgust on the faces of many of those present. But, what caught him off guard was the feeling of rage he felt when he saw Dumbledore sitting in the Chief Warlock’s stand. Not coming from himself, because ever since he found out who put Harry in the situation he had been, he had felt that bubbling rage, begging to be released on the man who dared to hurt his child. But there, barely hidden on Dumbledore’s face, was a bone-deep rage that if Bartok wasn’t as strong as he was, would have cowed him.
“Hello, Harry, my name is Siles. I am looking for my older brother Lyle, do you know where I might find him this evening?” Siles smiled softly, eyes slightly far away as if remembering something.
“I, James Fleamont Potter, presently of Godric’s Hollow, England, hereby revoke all former testamentary dispositions made by me and declare this to be my last Will.
It took them a little more than four hours to run scans on the thirty-six prisoners. Other than having atrophied muscles, magical exhaustion, and low vitamin D, they were all surprisingly healthy. Godric conjured them all plush squashy chairs to collapse into. Anna was sorting through a large stack of parchment, scribbling away all her observations.
But they didn’t, they just held Harry tighter and reassured him over and over that they accepted him, that the Claremores would accept him. And that was when it hit him,
The innocuous black box started to vibrate, bucking harder and harder as Anna tightened her grip on it. It wasn’t until Harry reached a hand out, over ten feet away from where Anna was wrestling with the box, that is jumped out of Anna’s grip and flew towards Harry.
Harry sat, the porcelain surprisingly warm and went about his business as usual and when finished he reached towards where the toilet paper should be, only to find nothing before he could start to worry something shocking happened. Warm water was shooting at his privates, the water hitting his ass, causing a strange tingle to shoot up his spine. He yelped in surprise, jumping up and rounding on the toilet which was still there looking innocently back at him. The door behind him burst open, Harry spinning on his heel to confront the intruder, but his bottoms were still around his ankles and he barely had time to catch himself on the wall before he fell.
“We will begin with the Will of James Fleamont Potter, the Wills will read themselves and we ask you to remain quiet through the proceedings.” Helix picked up a scroll and broke the seal, and from the paper, words started echoing around the dead silent room. Harry’s breath hitched, throat tightening and eyes beginning to water.
The man was shocked, realizing he had yet to introduce himself. “Oh, sorry, Godric Gryffindor at your service.” He bowed towards the Claremores, hair falling in front of his face, hiding their shocked faces from him. “I shall take my leave now, please take care of my little mate while I take care of what I need to.”
Harry was already at the dining table with Bartok, a plate of cheese and crackers between them, Harry munching away. David and Lyle joined them, reaching out to take a cracker but Tiptop popped in and smacked both of their hands with a wooden spoon. She glared at them both, but it was better than the wrath Anna could bring down on them. Especially considering they slept in the same bed.
His control was barely hanging on by a thread. And that was when a pitch black Eagle Owl soared through the open window. Albus sighed at the sight, the familiar owl breed that only Gringotts owned, the owl dropping the thick letter atop his head and then zoomed back out the window. Albus wasn’t quick enough to curse the filthy beast, so he ripped open the parchment, the top of the letter ripping in his anger.
Harry looked up at them, eyes bloodshot and puffy. “Really?” His voice cracked, every emotional easily seen.
A loud groan snapped him out of his daze, the sound coming from the door closest to him. Harry ran to the door, throwing it open, worried about someone being hurt.
Harry was surprised when Siles moved in front of him, holding out a hand for Harry to take. The boy did so hesitantly, not sure what Siles was doing when the grip wasn’t that of a handshake. Instead, the older boy bent nearly in half and kissed the top of Harry’s hand gently, barely a brush of lips before he was pulling away. He waved goodbye at the two and flooed away without another word.
“Dorea always had a flair for the dramatic,” Remus commented wistfully as the woman pulled out her wand, flicked her wrist and pillows floated from the bed to rest in front of the settee a House-Elf popping in with a tea service with two mugs of cocoa and a plate of cookies. Finally, the two boys rolled from under the bed, Harry watching them both eagerly, drinking in the form of his young Father. Harry could see why so many people compared them to each other. But the longer he looked the more different they seemed, his Father’s features were sharp where Harry’s face was much softer, lips thin where Harry’s were full, hair pitch black where Harry’s was dark brown. At first glance, they were almost mirror images, but once you saw them side by side they looked nothing alike. They did, however, share their curly hair and tanned skin tone, their noses the same straight line that Dorea shared with them.
Anna decided to move them to the guest room Remus and Sirius would be using, now that the bindings had been removed Sirius would be too tired to stay awake. Remus took over levitating his mate, face filled with worry.
Severus sat back onto the bed in the guest room that he had been given by Lucius, the bedspread the finest Egyptian cotton that caressed his skin. The soft fabric tickling his balls, making him squirm at the new feeling.
Until I am healthy again I will be posting shorter chapters more sporadically, I hope you all understand.
When Harry next woke he was surrounded by a pile of warm bodies, the room he was in completely dark. He could hear the slight snoring of David and Issy’s nonsensical mumblings in her sleep. A large hand reached over to rub at his scalp.
“Of course, we all want to be there to support you, Harry,” Anna assured, Issy, clutching his hand within hers.
David nodded, “There aren’t many infected werewolves in Terradore so we are having trouble sourcing blood to test, but I am sure we will eventually-”
This serum, unlike veritaserum, was a subtle compulsion that made one think they wanted to tell the truth. The reason it was illegal was that it was much easier to make than veritaserum and its nature made the person spill secrets without having to be prompted. The ministry had made it illegal since it was so much more damning than veritaserum and they were afraid of being forced to spill secrets. And while it was easier to make the ingredients needed to make it was much more expensive.

Arthur knew how Molly felt about her brothers, so when he recognized the signs of Fred and George being magical twins when they were only a day old, Arthur had sworn to protect them. So when Molly started looking at them strangely he was quick to distract her.
It was another twenty minutes before Fudge and his posse strode out of the floo as if they owned the place. He didn’t even wait to be invited to take a seat. Everyone else was tense, even the two Aurors the Ministry brought with them as they eyed up Percival.
Godric would see all things stolen from his young mate returned, no matter how long ago they were taken. Harry deserved to have the life works of his family safe in his hands. Godric couldn’t bring back the young man’s family, but he could at least do this.
They finally looked away, placing an alarm spell on her bed to alert them when she woke. It would probably take months for her to recover, but they hoped she would have moments of lucidity.
Bartok knew that the plan for Harry involved line theft and theft of money and property but the thought of those people planning to kill his son was just too much. His wings burst from his back, arching high up into the air and instincts screaming to go kill those people and then to go and protect his son. The only thing that stopped him from killing the men across from him was how disgusted, furious and ashamed they looked when Bill was speaking of their ex-families plans.
If you wanna talk about the fic
He smiled, face almost split in two as he pressed his forehead against her smooth stone walls. “Oh, my darling, how I have wished to comfort you.” There had been many times when the school was under attack was Godric had to continue fighting with her screams echoing against his heart. It wasn’t until Dumbledore placed him under a slavery spell that he was forced to sit idly by as the students were and danger and his daughter cried in fear.
So it is Acute CHF that means that with time it can heal completely and hopefully a heart transplant won't be in my future. I still have to take a bunch of meds to help my heart take a rest and heal and have a lot of doctor appointments. On the 15th I will have a full heart scan to see if it has improved any since I went into the hospital.
Sal blushed as he always had when either of the women ever complimented them. It was the only time outside of bed Godric ever saw the other blush, and it always made his heart pound.
“Sal, please listen to me, I wish we could kill him, I truly do. But it’s not so simple.” Godric tried.
After dinner, Issy led the two young boys to Harry’s room, Harry curious as to why. Neville’s hand was in his and Issy was babbling about the history of the house and some of its more interesting features. By the time they made it to his room, Harry was exhausted from the long emotional day, his feet shuffling against the hardwood. Neville’s bags were set on the bench at the end of Harry’s overly large bed.
“I am so sorry Boudicca, I only hope one day you can forgive me,” Godric whispered, forehead pressed against the tip of her snout. He wished he could have saved her, but the dark magic Dumbledore used on her corrupted her beyond belief. Godric had also heard the old man say he had feed many of his enemies to her. Even if they could fix her mind, Godric knew once she remembered what happened she would soon try to kill herself and there was nothing they could do to heal her from that.
“I am sorry Mr. Longbottom that you had to find out this way. We talked about it on the night you first arrived,” Bartok spoke up, voice even, trying to calm down the rage growing within Neville.
Bartok squeezed Harry’s hand before heading over to the section that held the paintings. He gently flipped through them, all of the portraits deactivated for now. Until he found the late Potters. Lily and James were standing next to each other in a library, both beaming and Lily obviously pregnant one hand on her baby bump.
Remus spoke up, allowing Sirius to gather himself. “There are many things like this, that some people find enjoyable while others don’t. These are called fetishes and sometimes go by kinks. Like with anything involving sex, if you don’t want to do something don’t allow anyone to convince you otherwise, but also keep an open mind. And as long as all parties are of age and consenting there is nothing to be ashamed of if you enjoy it.” Remus wanted to make sure Harry knew that consent was paramount.
There was a loud thump of Harry’s tail, which was now wagging out of control, and hitting against the wooden wardrobe. Harry swallowed thickly and made a mad dash for the restroom, his heart beating against his ribcage like a jackhammer. He pressed his back against the door, nervous and bewildered with his body’s reaction. Harry took a few deep breaths, steadying himself and his wobbly knees before walking over to the sink. The moles that liberally peppered his olive skin were clear in the mirror above the sink. His hair had grown out so his curls no longer were so short they looked like fluff atop his head but were now clearly defined ringlets. When wet, his hair was now down to his chin but as the curls dried the length shrunk up to about mid nose. Harry splashed cool water onto his face, a curl moving out of place and into his upper ears, causing it to flick in agitation.
The blonde placed his hands on his boyfriend's hips and stopped the kiss, just to start kissing Harry's jaw and down, going to his neck.
"Candies and having each other companies." Neville complemented, gaining soft hummers as answers from everyone.
