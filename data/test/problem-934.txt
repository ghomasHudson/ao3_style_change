"Sir? Sir are you ok?" She dropped down onto her knees next to me, a hand on my shoulder. I took a second to look at her. "Oh my goodness." She gasped. Her face softened. "My name's Alyssa, I'm going to get you some help, ok?" I nodded slowly. "Can I ask your name?"
”I’m sorry I doubted you. Want me to do it?” I nodded, and explained briefly how to injection it. “You sure you trust me?”
"I will throw you back on that bed if you're not careful." Is all he says, but he's smiling. He grabs my hand and drags me out of the room. I'm cautious, checking to make sure no one is around as we walk down the landing.
Draco made a mental note to see about having more air conditioning units installed because if his employees couldn't stand the heat, the customers definitely wouldn't.
Draco was not childlike in the way he unwrapped the gifts. He was meticulous, unfolding paper and carefully removing tape like it was an exam.
"Morning to you too, daddy." I walk past him, pecking his cheek on the way, and head into the kitchen to get a drink and some painkillers. I pour a coffee from the pot in the corner of the room, taking a sip as I look out the window above the sink. I jump when someone speaks to me.
He picked up a book from his small collection, laying on the sofa with the kitten curled in his lap as he read through the evening.
Harry found the bedroom easily, surprised by the amount of personal decor it had for a guest room. He took a minute to look at the picture frames on the dresser, images of Draco and his two closest friends throughout the years after high school.
As softly as I could, I pressed my lips to his knuckle, letting all my love for him pour out through the kiss.
I began to stroke myself slowly, letting images of Malfoy and handcuffs take over my mind. His icy cold eyes looking down at me as he used me how he wanted. Tied up, at his whim. Following every order that fell from his lips.
“Neville, I think Mione has your share.” He looks at me with a nod before exiting the kitchen and heading off to find the girl. We all notice Zabini staring at his ass as he leaves. As soon as Neville is out of ear shot, I quickly grab Zabini’s collar and shove him against the wall.
I sent a silent thank-you to Blaise. "Thanks, but I think you two should probably have a day to catch up. He's always with Nev and you're always with me. Have a great day, though."
"Harry?" He calls, and I immediately rush to see him. He encases me in his arms and I nuzzle into his chest. "Sorry I had to leave for work, baby. I really didn't want to." He pecks me on the forehead before looking up and seeing the other two officers, as well as Zabini. "Officer Hughes, Officer Meade." He nods to the woman, and then the man, before turning back to me. "By the way, Harry." His tone was serious. He was speaking to me as a gang leader rather than as his boyfriend. "There are some Serpents outside. I don't know what they want, you ought to be careful."
“Mr Joseph, hello, I’m detective Marcel. I’ll be interviewing you about the events of earlier.” She spoke with a tone that made it clear she was in charge of the room, but it was interlaced with the warmth of a mother. I felt a little more comfortable. She sat down, placing a notepad and tape recorder on the table. “I’ll be recording this for future reference, and in case it needs to be used in court.” She jotted down a few things at the top of her page, before beginning the questions.
"Daddy!" I moan loudly as I tip over the edge. I tighten around Draco, and it sends him over the edge, sending ribbons of cum into me as he moans my name loudly. We collapse back onto the bed, breathing heavily.
”Well, dinner’s here now so if you want to-” Teddy gets up and pushes past me, before running downstairs. I give Scorpius a strange look.
I threw him to the floor, a grunt of pain coming from him. I kicked him in the ribs, and then in the balls.
”Really, Daddy?” I barely hear the muttered ‘Jesus fucking christ’ before he pulls me against him by grabbing my hips and slamming his lips on mine. I smile against him, and open my mouth to let his tongue slip in, completely dominating me.
The Griffins owned a small estate on the far side of town. Before I took over from my godfather, they lived in a caravan park in horrible conditions. With the money my parents had left me, as well as money from our… business, I had bought the gang a series of houses on a small estate. Several large houses, with several people living in each. It wasn’t a family gang. People who joined were people who needed a family, who needed the support. But there weren’t many actual families. Sure, we had the odd sibling, but the lack of parents and children made it so housing was much like Uni dorms – or so I had been told. I had left school after college and didn’t get a further education. Or at least I didn’t plan on it. I still had some time, I suppose.
As we sit sullenly in the holding cell, I look around to see who’s been caught. Ginny and Lovegood sit huddled in the corner, and a Rook member is standing at the bars, watching the officers who walk by. A couple of Bloodskull and Serpent members are dotted around, and opposite me is the guy I was dancing with, who is also a Serpent.
"Can't satisfy you for long, can I?" He chuckled, wrapping an arm around my neck and pulling me down, meeting me halfway to capture my lips in a soft kiss. His other hand slid down to my clit, rubbing it softly. I moaned into his mouth, quickening my grinding onto his hand, feeling myself get wetter. "Fuck, baby. You like it when I touch you, huh?" I couldn't answer, but I'm sure it was rhetorical. He quickened his hand movements, and moved to sck on the hickey he had given me last night. I leaned back, trying to push myself over the edge of climax as I felt the heat building in my stomach, my breath heavy and my heartbeat fast.
“Woah.” They say. It’s a male voice, perhaps a couple years younger than myself, but I don’t know who it could be. Our clients always book an appointment, and there were no scheduled for today. “Is that the Aston Martin DB11? Sick!” The footsteps approach and I feel obliged to greet the person. I slide out from under the car, which had been lifted a foot or so off the floor, and stand to meet them.
The rest of the afternoon passed with Melissa nudging Draco, throwing looks towards Harry and raising her eyebrows. When she finished her shift in the early evening, Draco was almost glad to have the shop to himself.
It took a while trying to position myself in ways to take good pictures, but also trying to keep myself calm and not alert my housemates. The bruises were now deep hues of purple, extremely clear to see.
Once we reach the station after an awkward car ride, I’m taken in for questioning, mostly so they can get my details, but the officer who’s interviewing me – Not Blondie, but some big fucker who’s an absolute dullhard – is making me infuriated.
"You'll have to be careful wearing my clothes like that. I'll have to take you upstairs for round two." He smirks.
“And I’m King of the Griffins. I’ll have every fucking gang in Britain on your ass before you can make the call. Don’t forget the power I hold. There’s more of us than there is you. We’ll fuck your life over before you tuck yourself into your prissy bed tonight, got it? Don’t think for a fucking second you can get away with shit just because you’re a police officer. Hurt him and we’ll come right back at you.” I glare at him for a second, giving him a final shove before I step back. Zabini looks shaken, and quickly leaves to find Longbottom. I turn to face Draco, who’s staring at me with wide eyes.
“Nice one, doll.” He smirks, wrapping an arm around Neville’s shoulders. Seeing their closeness reminds me that I need to have words with Blaise. I have to protect my own, after all.
”Yes, daddy.” He hums to himself, and leans over me to grab something from the table. I here the flip of a lid and I smile. Finally. Two cold, lube covered fingers press at my asshole and push in with ease, scissoring my entrance and stretching it for his cock to fit. I’m surprised when, instead of undoing his flies and turning me so I can ride him, something solid and hard fills me. It’s long, but not as long as daddy, and I can tell that it’s wider at the base than it is at the tip. I let out a sound of disappointment as he pulls my panties up.
"Ok, what do you want them to say?" Blaise asked as the men were entering the room. Blaise and I were stood behind a one-way mirror.
He sighed, giving a glance to James who was sitting a few feet behind him, and let the woman in. She squealed, throwing her arms around him quickly before heading into the flat, excited to explore the small house.
"I think she was called His Right Hand." George answered, smirking. I made an unimpressed expression towards the both of them.
“The She-Weasel is in on this charade too?” He guffawed. He stepped back, crouching before the kitten who looked at him with those innocent little emerald green eyes. “Ok, James. Last time we’ll ask. You want to go home with the Granger-Weasleys and see the ginger devil herself, or do you want to stay here with me?”
Coffee machine on and last night's dishes put away, Draco thought he was in for a peaceful morning when a tapping at his window proved him wrong.
"Sorry," Harry apologised immediately, despite having nothing to apologise for. "Do you mind if I have another drink? I can pay you back later-"
The kiss was soft yet rough. It was everything and not enough. The clatter of the broom falling to the floor wasn't enough to make Draco flinch, whose mind could only think about Harry's lips on his. Draco's hands quickly found themselves on Harry's waist, pulling him impossibly closer.
Draco stayed with James, forgoing dinner, that evening, keeping the kitten company until he got tired himself. That night, he wrapped an arm slowly around the kitten, who snuggled into his touch.
"Mm, baby. You're so tight. Fuck, Princess, this is amazing." He moaned as he pounded in and out of me sloppily. "I bet this is your first time, isn't it? My Princess is still a virgin for me. That's so hot. I'm the first guy to breed you, huh?" I was silent. Tears were coming out of my eyes faster than I could produce them. Dropping onto the floor every second, each time a little of my dignity disappearing into the asphalt with them.
, and you go horizontal then around clockwise,” she explained, showing him the movement. “So you can do it yourself.” She smiled innocently at him.
"Who killed Marcus?" Someone shouted. Others murmered in agreement. This time Draco stepped forward to answer.
"What am I supposed to do with this?" Harry called, turning around for his eyes to follow Draco. Draco yelled back something about a heated rail in the bathroom, to which Harry rolled his eyes because of course Draco Malfoy has a heated towel rail.
When Harry returned to the living room, Draco was sat - sprawled, really, if posh tossers could sprawl - on the sofa where he had been a minute ago, a mug in each hand. Harry tentatively sat on the opposite end, taking one of the mugs which Draco offered him.
Next was a bottle of 2000 Malbec from France. She gave him a smirk. He hadn't had a good bottle of wine in years and she'd somehow known his favourite.
”That was amazing, baby. I’m so proud of you. We’re definitely doing that again.” He smiles, before leaning in to kiss me. He wraps his arms around me before switching our positions, making me lie back on the bed. He motions for me to scoot further up, so I shuffle until my head hits the pillow. “I think you deserve a little something.” He grins. He signals from me to lot my arms and pulls my shirt off, taking a minute to look at all the scars.
He spent a few minutes watching over Harry before reluctantly tearing himself away, leaving a note before heading back down to the café and his waiting coworker.
"Haven't properly dated anyone since my split with Astoria. That was, what? Seven, eight years ago now. Not only that, but mother always complains about how dirty this place is when she comes over. Which is unfair, seeing as she has fucking maids and I have a seventeen year old kid living here."
Harry shook his head before cutting Draco off, "No, just waiting for you to come to bed." He was silent for a moment. "That doesn't mean what you think it means."
Draco searched quickly around the lounge, heading to his bedroom when there was no sign of the kitten.
Time went by quickly. She had me describe a lot in detail, the weather, the alleyway, what I was thinking as I was walking to the location. The actual event she didn’t pressure me to describe in as much detail though. It was hard, so hard. And exhausting. I was in the brink of tears the entire time, still feeling his hands on me, everywhere. His lips on my face, his hands at my throat, my wrists, my hips. When I was done talking we sat in silence for a minute. She had been taking thorough notes the entire time, but put her pen down.
”Two things. One, Teddy mentioned to me on the phone that you need the Irish kid’s number for Dean. I did some digging, and I found it. Secondly, I was wondering if you’d like to go on a date with me. I was thinking a lovely little Thai place in town, but maybe we could order in instead?”
"Yep," he answered, "one sec" he added under his breath. He sat up and got out of the tub a little too quickly. Glasses still sitting on the counter and rendered almost blind, Harry's foot caught on the side of the bathtub and he was sent flying, or would have been at least if it weren't for the pair of arms which wrapped around him, saving him from the impending crash.
"The guys at the café clubbed together for this. It's not a lot, but..." Melissa trailed off with a shrug, holding a bag out to Draco.
"Merlin's sake, Potter," Draco chided, but there was no real bite to his tone. "Saviour of the wizarding world and yet can't come to reasonable conclusions. It really is a miracle." He added under his breath as he tidied up their breakfast things.
“Let’s leave the two lovebirds alone.” Granger suggests, pulling Weasley out the room with her. Malfoy takes a step closer to me, towering over my small frame.
As I’m driving down the long stretch of road, I check the time and see I’m behind schedule. If I was late, it was to be assumed something had gone wrong and the others would be out looking for me. I had to get back on time before they started crawling the streets in search for me. The police were already getting pissy with us. I press down harder on the throttle, going up a couple gears and speeding down the road at 90. I turn my music up and focus on getting back quickly.
I took out a new needle and syringe, filling it up with the clear liquid from the bottle before pinching some skin on my thigh. Before I could lazily stab it in, a hand grabbed my wrist.
”Draco and Harry are in a relationship which encorporates BDSM themes, such as the use of punishments when the sub goes against a rule by the Dom. One of which would be making the sub sleep in a separate room or denying them... sexual pleasure and instead having them watch as the Dom brings himself to release. A lot of subs find pleasure in doing acts for the Dom or  generally being near them can bring them a sense of calm.” I’m blushing like mad and rest my head in my hands.
“Lovely weather this evening?” He asks once he’s near enough. Although we were stood in a dark alley, the sound of rushing cars travelled from far away. The question prompts me to answer with the code I was given.
After she left, Draco sat down on the stairs next to James, resting his head in his hands. James perched up, his front paws on Draco’s leg.
He led them through to the living area, where Millie was explaining Irish Cream to Pansy and James was trying to get into the paper bag.
”Harry?” Daddy shouts. I run over to appear at the bottom of the stairs, mug still in hand. I look up to where he’s standing at the top, stark naked. I blush at the site and he rushes down to hug me. “Jesus I thought you’d left.” He explains when he pulls back. “God, you look so adorable in my hoodie.” He adds, taking in my appearance.
"Nothing's coming up," the vet came back to him. "Must be a stray; no collar, no chip. It's very healthy for a stray though, especially this young. It can barely be a year old, and it's very small even for that age."
"If you say so..." she trailed off. Perhaps I wasn't as seamless as I had hoped. "While you're here, I was wondering if you wanted to come to dinner with the family tomorrow? Charlie's back in town, so's Percy by some wild luck, so mum's having a big lunch. Invited Ron and I obviously, and she wanted to extend an invitation to you too. She knows you're busy with everything but she hasn't seen you in years."
"I'll just get this packaged up and then I'll try and see if there are any hairs there to collect." When she turned her back to head over to the countertop at the side of the room, Blaise began whispering to me.
When I walked into the station after my days off, I noticed an odd atmosphere about the place. The officers around me were quieter than usual, people making odd glances at each other.
“That’s ok. If you take me from behind you practically won’t see my itty bitty penis.” Seamus scoots up close to the dark skinned boy, and I mean
A voice started shouting from within. "If there're carol singers at this time of night I'm going to- Potter?"
”You’d better clear your name, otherwise you’ll have the rest of the Serpents wanting your blood.” Hermione adds. “They’re in the kitchen.”
”He’s into a fair amount. I’m surprised he only ever did missionary with Astoria.” I frown, but assume it’s his ex-wife.
"Where've you come from?" He softly asked the thing, locking the door behind the creature before crouching down to see it. In the soft lights of the cafe, Draco could better see the cat. It's fur was jet black, but there was a small scar on the top of its head, most likely from a fight a long time ago, despite the fact that the cat itself was clearly not that old.
"Go have a few minutes outside, I'm sure it's cooler out there," Draco offered, understanding how they felt.
"S-s-sorry," Harry stuttered through chattering teeth, shivers wracking his body. "My c-c-car broke d-d-d-d-d-down and-" he paused when everything started spinning.
“That’s right. You’re so good for me. So good for daddy.” I blush at the praise before he begins to thrust into me at a slow yet sharp pace. Nice and hard but drawing out the pull out. “So tight for me, baby. I love your ass so much.” I mewl in response, not knowing I could make such a noise. Out of nowhere he smacks my ass again, but it’s welcomed this time, the pain adding to my pleasure. “Hmm. Such a little slut, aren’t you?” He hums. “My little cockslut. So good for me.” I don’t know what does it, whether it’s the spanking or the names or the praise or just the fucking, but I’m sent over the edge into one of the biggest orgasms I’d ever experienced, moaning Daddy’s name like a whore.
Draco cried out in pain, his hand shooting to the area to feel a little warm blood already spilling out.
"Scorp, it's half nine now! Kid, you're awful." Scorpius beams at this though. "Alright, make yourself look presentable, at least. Is Teddy staying?" Scorp shrugs and heads back into the kitchen, leaving Draco to drag me upstairs quickly.
”The Griffins don’t really have a hierarchy. And I don’t want them fucking up a deal.” I shout in reply. “They don’t need to know about my extras, anyway.” I pat my pocket and the guy raises an eyebrow. I pull out the clear bag that contains the pills I got from my last deal before taking out a couple. I offer him one and he shrugs, taking one. We place them on our tongues before swallowing them, chasing them with a drink. “Shouldn’t be long.” I shout with a wink.
“Oh, Ok. I’ll leave you be.” His voice was... off. Like he knew something had happened. Of course he would, he’s smart and pays attention.
”No way. Shower. Then clothes.” I frown at him. “You reek of sex. Not that I mind. Little Edward might.”
"Don't be so hard on yourself. I'm sure you're a very hard leader when you need to be, confident when to take charge." I sucked in a breath.
“Fuck.” I mutter under my breath. I turn my music down but don’t lower my speed, instead turning off down a road into a housing estate where I know I can lose them. I zig zag down streets upon streets of houses, my engine roaring loudly through the small town I’ve ducked into. By now I was going to be back way too late and I was too far from home to get there quick enough. Still, I’d rather be late home than caught by the pigs.
“Are they just things to you? Property you can destroy as easily as you’d throw something in the rubbish? Do you even know their names?”
Harry stares down at their hands with unmistakable surprise, looks back to Draco, and smiles so radiantly Draco loses sight of the rest of the room.
“My honour, Auror Robards.” He swallowed back the hint of bile that rose in his throat as he forced deference. “When do we begin?”
Shocked, Draco whipped his eyes up to look at Harry, who took in the flowers, met Draco’s gaze straight on, and held it.
“Mmm, yes. There was a pair of sheets, Gryffindor red. I went to levitate them and they were absolutely stiff in spots.”
Ignoring the implied request, Draco leans forward, his brow furrowed. “And it’s been strictly casual? The whole time?”
A confusion that, Draco realises, is about him. About wanting to know how he is. About wanting him to be more than fine. Draco swallows. Tries to wrap his head around it. “Yes. You’re on me, it’s rather…you’re warm.”
“That’s it?” Robards asked into the ensuing silence. “Running more tests? No disrespect, Dr Malfoy, but aren’t we bending over backwards here because you’re supposed to be the best?”
Draco woke one day in mid-April to find that the sun was already up, and he was beginning to sweat under two down quilts. One his way to work, he noticed that daffodil leaves had pushed through the earth, and a few buds were beginning to swell.
“Of course.” Potter steps away and drops Draco’s arm as they step off the staircase. “It’s the least I could do,” he raises his voice ever so slightly, “for someone I care about.”
With a groan, Draco slumped back against the upholstery, sprawling sideways and taking Harry with him, until they were wedged together on the settee.
On pure instinct, Harry extended a hand, cupped the sharp line of Draco’s jaw, and pulled him in. He could feel Draco’s pulse pounding under his fingertips. Draco’s lips were firm and warm and pliant and he kissed back fiercely. He pulled Harry to him, and Harry slipped a hand under his coat, and the heat of him, the knowledge that it was Draco’s chest under his hands, Draco’s lips against his, thrilled Harry to his core.
Mission accomplished. I am now in possession of half a dozen photographs of a naked, turgid Neville Longbottom.
Draco scoffed. “The waiter’s arse was the only thing he couldn’t keep his eyes off of, and I doubt they’re foes of any sort. Rocks, Blaise?”
He doesn’t expect Potter to run, but he does. He doesn’t expect to be left, flushed and hard, against a shelf of kitchen knives in the one place he’d thought he’d made his own. But he is.
Then they’re laying shoulder to shoulder, the full length of their arms pressed against each other. Draco has to close his eyes against the onslaught of feeling. It’s as though something passes through their skin, as though, pressed against Harry like this, he becomes permeable.
Draco rose and ran a hand down Potter’s side and grabbed his hip, pulling him back and pressing up against him. “We could do so many nicer things with your arse, Potter, if you’d only play along.”
, just like Draco said – and trying to pretend he gives a Galleon about the arrangement of furniture chosen by people who hated his godfather and would’ve hated him too.
Draco’s objections are pre-empted when he realises Harry’s slipped out of generalities. “I think we are.”
. A command, a plea. Between his body and Malfoy’s, his cock was full and aching with want. He stilled his hips. Malfoy followed immediately. He wrapped his legs around Malfoy and levered himself up, until they were face to face, Malfoy still deep inside him. The grey of Malfoy’s eyes was barely visible around his pupils; he started to ask, “Wh—?”
“I’ll pass your compliments on to the kitchen. Though the elves might be mortally offended if you don’t find room somewhere.”
Draco’s eyes were trained on his screen. He unlocked it with his thumb and read the message again. Draco couldn’t help the beginning of a smile that crept over his features. Lee’s words echoed back to him.
He is aware, in the back of his mind – or, just as frequently, the front of it – that Draco may not show up. He never said yes, never even picked up the parchment. Harry is aware that he may have told his friends for nothing, or for something that’s about to be a bit of egg on his face. But if Draco does come, and it does come up, he can tell him with a straight face that he’s already keeping his promises.
Draco moves so quickly that Harry has to rush to keep up. They don’t pause or exchange a single word all the way around the dais, past books, until Draco halts at the end of an aisle. “Bookcases.”
That I made it through breakfast without killing anyone is a testament to the kind of Malfoy I’ve become. Which is to say, the kind that values long-term goals over passing outbursts.
He pushes until his fingers have disappeared inside of Harry, then slips them out, and in again. Harry stretches his legs even further apart and cants his hips. He almost grabs for Draco’s wrist, barely holds himself back, settling instead for a murmured, “Harder.”
,” Draco bit out, ”I think I understand perfectly. You’re here because you need me, because I have an expertise that no one on your team has, and you need it badly enough that you were willing to come here and, not insignificantly, at least for Granger here, swallow your pride and ask me for something. If my observations are correct—and, Minister, they almost always are—you need me more than I need you.”
“I know her pretty well and I don’t think she’d stop being friends with me or anything, so we talked it over and thought it was a good choice. If that makes sense?”
“No, that’s fine. Draco.” He said it slowly, testing it out. “Draco.” He hummed. “It’s a bit strange. Not your name,” he rushed to add, ”but saying it. Was it weird for you?”
. Trying not to think about how good Draco Malfoy made him feel, or how hard he’d come, or how much he wants it to happen again. Trying to think, instead, about those nice girls he’s supposed to end up with, who would never tie him to a shelf and suck him dry. Thinking about whether it’s their girlness or their niceness that leaves him wanting. Deciding that it doesn’t really matter, because when he thinks about nice boys and not-nice girls, none of them make him instantly hard the way his irrepressible, Draco-related daydreams do. None of them, not even his own made up fantasy people, are as interesting as Draco Malfoy.
Draco takes Harry’s bollocks back in his mouth, tugging gently, giving him a hint of teeth that leaves him gasping, drawing away and then shifting down for more.
Draco can’t. He’s sure of it. It’s all terribly suffocating all of a sudden, this cavernous space he’s got so used to. He can’t spend a day here with Potter, with Potter kissing his neck and holding his waist and calling him Draco. Something will happen, something dangerous. He just knows it. It’s a certainty. They’ve always been a disaster together, and this…
Malfoy stands, brushing a streak of dust off his robes with unreserved disgust. He huffs. “This way.”
To her credit, Granger noticed and pulled back, searching his face. He started to look away and then seemed to steel himself, force himself to look back. He took her hand and squeezed it, and said something to her as he gestured towards the tea tray. She nodded, and when Harry turned away Draco saw anxiety overtake her features. Liking Granger was bad enough; empathising might be a bridge too far.
The house wasn’t as I remembered it from childhood. Or, it was, but with the dust and decay of the intervening decade. It was all macabre gloom, redeemable only because he gripped my hand harder in the shadows and pulled me ahead, and up the stairs.
“So I started a new foundation. Which might sound mad, I know, when I was already up to my ears in them, but there wasn’t one for this.”
“Bugger.” Draco ran a hand through his hair. “Fine. Can it wait for the 3rd, so I’m not elbows-deep in entrails?”
was best suited for lining birdcages. He went to clean the last of the spoonbill’s blood off the pavement where it had fallen; it was a matter of dignity, he thought, and of not scaring children, and those were things he was very much in favour of, right alongside not hurting things. He cleaned a stubborn spot off the hem of his Auror robes and admitted that the statement might need amending, but it was still true that he wouldn’t hurt a living thing if he could avoid it. Of course it was a different thing if someone was firing Unforgiveables at him, or if he was caught in battle, or if one of his spells rebounded, or if it was unavoidable in some other way, but he’d worked damned hard to accept that he wasn’t a terrible person or responsible for all those deaths he hadn’t been able to stop during the war, and he wasn’t going to let some throwaway comment of Malfoy’s set him back. He reorganised his pants and socks and made a fry-up and decided that yes, that was right, and if Malfoy couldn’t see it that way, that was Malfoy’s problem.
Harry looked up at him, almost abashedly. “I didn’t… When the magic started. I didn’t think I’d ever have this again. I’d be too dangerous. And then when I realised, about men, about you, it… I wondered, if maybe that was for the best.”
“Do.” Harry’s lips twitched, and he broke out into a grin. Draco followed suit, and there they stood, beaming.
Potter’s eyes lingered on the edge of the desk, the leather Winchester that they’d just abandoned, the rug. And the he turned them back to Draco, a determined gaze set above firm lips. “Nine o’clock.”
I lied, of course. “It was wonderful. It’s so good to meet new sorts of people, to really understand how they live.”
After a stern pause, McGongall took up again. “I believe this to be our best chance yet at closing the Chamber and securing our students’ safety. Your work is appreciated and not, I understand, without risk. While we are all eager to close the books on this era of Hogwarts’ history, it is not worthwhile if it comes with additional loss of life or limb. Merlin knows we’ve all seen quite enough of that. If things take a wrong turn, you are to stop immediately. Am I understood?”
Perhaps it’s inconsiderate of me to think that way. The Manor meant so much to them; it represents so many years of memories before Voldemort’s return, before it became more a prison than a home. But then I wonder, now, if it ever was a home, as opposed to another thing to be won and controlled. It’s not that they’re unloving, but when I compare the rigidity of my childhood to the warmth and ease of Harry’s attic…the contrasts are stark, and not only for their rather different approaches to interior design.
Harry's heart sped up as he summoned the courage to keep going. "Do you have any additional expectation of favours from the Ministry?"
“Very similar to what we’ve been doing.” Draco did not object to glossing over the theoretical portion, which he thought might predetermine Potter’s answer. “Walks on the grounds once a day for about an hour.”
I guide the tip to his entrance, and bite down on my lip when his hole clenches around me immediately. It wasn’t just words; he really is hungry for it.
Malfoy’s obliged, slipping another finger in beside the first and twisting them so that Harry arched his back and moaned lightly.
So, plank staining is in my future. And awkward attempts at détente with his friends. Another apology to Longbottom. Finding out whether my fellow Slytherins will come round on a permanent basis, beyond Goyle’s suspicious, tentative lurking and Blaise’s total laissez-faire that counts more as not giving a fuck than any sort of actual support. I suppose I have to give Harry that one, that his friends have stuck by him. Makes them seen worth apologising to, nowadays.
“Draco,” Harry repeats, resting his hand on Draco’s arm. “I’m sorry. I was hoping to get them out of here without you seeing.”
Potter crosses an ankle over the opposite knee and rests folded hands on his lap. His face is unusually, unfairly, blank.
Harry sighed, his breath rising in a white column that disappeared into the night. He relaxed into Draco’s arms. “Another minute.”
Potter’s eyes flew open. He stared at the apple. Blinked, and blinked again. Opened his mouth, then shut his jaw with a snap. He turned his eyes to Draco imploring, flitting back to the apple to try, as best he could, to ask his question.
Any lack of overt hostility confuses him. He stood there blankly. For really quite a long moment. It’s a wonder he escaped even someone as dim as Yaxley with reflexes as slow as a Troll’s.
Malfoy did turn at that, but only partway, and it was a far cry from what Harry had hoped for. His pretty flush was almost gone, and he had the same implacably cold expression he'd worn when Harry had first shown up. "Bored, actually. Are we done here?"
“Really, Mr Malfoy, I can’t tell you what this means.” She turns her smile on Harry. “If you’ve lost something, you’re in good hands.”
Draco’s nausea returns. He wasn’t ready for this sort of fumbling around, like they're strangers. Awkward strangers, at that. “We’ve both done this lots of times.”
“Oh, it’s vandalism, I’ll grant you that much, seeing as your genius detecting has already got us this far. But is it a crime?”
No response was forthcoming, except in the form of a Floo call from Luna two days later wherein she detailed further progress in rehabilitation and asked him, rather too pointedly, he thought, if there was anything else he wanted to know. He’d hesitated, but he hadn’t been able to bring himself to say it.
Draco’s attention was too divided to be ready for it when Sydney took him down to the base. His cock hit the tight muscles of Sydney’s throat and he bucked forward, hissing under his breath.
Draco’s moan was guttural, a visceral, raw thing that resonated through him before he could stop it. But at the look of pleasure on Harry’s face, at the moan that vibrated through his cock, he knew he would never try to stop it again. Harry’s lips were softer than silk, warmer than Draco’s hand, and his tongue slid over Draco’s head and down his shaft leaving a trail of sparks in its wake.
It’s Robards who announces the test: Harry is to chase Proudfoot who will attempt to evade capture using any means fit for the task, so long as they stay in the valley.
Weasley fell immediately into a defensive stance when the door didn't budge. "Fall back. Unexpected interference."
Harry helps pull him up, then points to the left. “I usually—that’s my side. Unless you – I don’t know how you sleep. Is it the same? I think I was always the left, might be weird to switch now.”
Larger furniture is stored at the far back of the department. It’s not even visible from the entrance to the warehouse and getting there takes a bit of walking. Potter follows along faithfully and manages to avoid careening into Draco when they come to a stop in front of kitchen and dining tables.
“Hey!” She put her hands on her hips. “None of that.” She came closer and spotted the former loaf. “And none of
He was almost ready to beg—for Potter’s hand, for his mouth, for any path to release—when he felt Potter speed up behind him, heard him go quiet. And then he dug his fingers into Draco’s hips, pulling him close with such force that Draco thought he might leave a bruise as a souvenir, and Potter let out a low, guttural moan that Draco was sure he’d remember for the rest of his days. Draco felt the wetness of Potter’s ejaculation run down his arse and onto his thighs, then felt Potter collapse forward onto him. He felt the way Potter’s thighs shook with the intensity of it, the way Potter was still struggling to catch his breath.
“They’d revere a Crup if they thought it might help their vaunted saviour.” She winced, barely, but visibly, and Draco wondered if it hadn’t come out harsher than she’d intended.
“Yeah, that too. And I really can’t. I want to sometimes. Believe me.” He exhaled, half-sigh, half-laugh. “Sometimes I really want to. It would be so much easier to come here and tell you something less than this. But it’s still sensitive. My magic. Healer Barrett thinks it might stay that way. And it’s okay if it’s something little, you know? If I have to tell someone they look nice when they don’t, and I don’t really care. But people I do care about, things I care about… I really can’t risk keeping things in. Lying about them.”
It’s enough, just enough, to send Potter jumping back out of reach. He’s gasping and flushed and trying his damnedest to look sceptical. “What’re you doing, Malfoy?”
He felt Potter push himself to standing, could tell when Potter locked his knees. The rigidity seemed to erase anything else that might have been.
“I’m going to start talking,” Harry said. “If you’d like to change the meal, or leave, please tell me.”
Harry followed him to the last ridge, where they could see the waves rushing up to meet the shore, and flowing back out again. He cast a warming charm before they sat, which earned him a mix of amusement and appreciation from Draco. Then they sat.
The only thing worse for his reputation would’ve been declining the task altogether, thereby proving to Robards and Wardwell (and the Ministry water-cooler crowd, and the
“What will it mean for a child, to be tried for proof of their blood status before they even enter the Great Hall?
Draco raised an eyebrow. Not he brightest idea, this. He really hoped, for the sake of his good opinion of Lee, that it came from the Muggles.
“Mill,” Draco groaned. “Please. I don’t know if I’ve just been handed the maddest or the best case of my career, but I do know it’s among the most inexplicable. Can you please, please read me the file again?”
It seemed to struggle at first, giving a weak cry as its injured wing met even the slightest resistance from the air. But it calmed down as Malfoy whispered reassurances, and a few minutes in it gave a tentative flap, and then another. They went on like that, Malfoy and the spoonbill, for another few minutes, and then Malfoy began to lower it. It drew its wings into its body and let Malfoy direct it into his free arm. “Good,” Malfoy purred. “Beautifully done, Edgar.”
“You’re treating it awfully carelessly, then.” He continues on at Potter’s confused expression. “How do you think it would look, Potter? The Deputy Head Auror on his knees for the WWN’s top investigative journalist? Not much room for discretion between your mouth and Jordan’s cock.”
The last time Harry had seen him they had almost come to blows. It had been just the two of them, outside on the terrace at a fundraiser for something or other. Malfoy had said his name—
“If only I’d have left the country,” Harry joked. Or sort of joked. Draco couldn’t tell how much he meant it.
That train of thought is so entirely unproductive that he knows he’d better redirect his attentions elsewhere.
“Merlin, no. I mean,” he scrambled, as Harry’s face twisted, “yes, I want to very much. Very much. But I’m leaving, and you’ve never—You’ve never, right? With a man, at all?”
A work bench sits at the centre, and on it there are several boxes. Curious, Harry steps towards them.
“So you keep saying.” Malfoy’s voice was fire and ice. “Very creative. And perhaps you’ll notice it’s completely unsupported. Either you’re not listening or you know I’m right. Which is to say, either you’ve replaced our elitism with your own or you’re wrong and you might even know it.”
Draco’s heart ached. “You were perfect.” He reached out a hand for Harry’s cheek and Harry let him, turning his head at the last minute to kiss Draco’s palm. It felt like it shot through his arm, carried through his ulna and radius and humerus, straight to his heart. Magic in reverse.
He looked up with a friendly smile when Draco entered, though was visibly startled to see that he was alone.
Which Harry was determined that it wouldn't. He was an adult, and a damn competent Auror, and he wasn't going to let any of this get the better of him.
“Well,” Draco surveyed Harry, whose skin heated, “it’s not as though I’m not getting anything out of it.”
Potter clearly isn’t as self-conscious as he’d once been and his magic—his magic has always been able to fill a room, but nine years in the field has made it an extension of him, something he can shape and direct without even meaning to. Draco can almost feel it reaching for him, surrounding him.
Millie looked at him sceptically. “Were you secretly the Hufflepuff prefect? We don’t always get the perfectly ethical choice. Remember? They’re not all good ones?” She leaned forward to make sure she had his attention. “Sometimes the compromise choice is the best we can do. And there are certainly things more dangerous than attraction.”
“No, no, Potter. You’re quite right. Well I’ll just leave you to it, then. I’m sure you miss the good old days. Bit overdue for a heroic act, aren’t you? Perhaps a boggart will tide you over.”
I pulled him towards me and kissed him again, reversing our positions. He was a bit less shocked by the sensation the second time round, and stilled his hips enough to let me work my throat open and take him in entirely. I could tell it was a struggle for him not to writhe around, and pulled back so he could thrust up as he needed. It was a sight to behold. And a taste, a smell, a feeling – of him in my mouth, his hand on my head.
“No!” Potter exclaimed, pacing towards Draco. “There’s more. The press. Your reputation. I could restore your reputation in the wizarding world.”
“More,” Draco repeated, feeling his cock jerk inside of Harry. “Yeah.” He pulled back and drove in harder, rolling his hips, trapping Harry’s cock between them.
He’s sick of this hallway and he’s sick of this walk and he’s completely fucking sick of this bloody door.
“But there’s no need for you and I to continue working together daily. I imagine I’ll still have to sign off on things with the Ministry, and I’m happy to keep up the pretense that I’m the lead on the case. I can plan to return monthly or fortnightly to assess your progress and meet with the Minister and whoever else if you’d like. I’ll be available to discuss what’s feasible and advisable in terms of returning to your job, if you’d like to. That will give you a bit more time to sort out what you’d like to do next.”
“There’s no pattern to the outbursts. They don’t happen at regular intervals or during particular activities. They do tend to be destructive, but always in reparable ways, and some are completely benign. There’s no correlation with time of day, foods ingested, level of physical stimulation, or setting. Or with Potter’s moods, which continue to be inexplicable. It doesn’t make sense. Any of it. Granger, why didn’t you try a conventional implant?”
More introductions are made, Champagne in hand, and Draco manages not to make a mess of any of them. He’s grateful that Granger and Weasley aren’t in attendance—home with a sick child, Harry says—but he manages with Dean Thomas, with George Weasley, with Susan Bones. Even though he’s struck with the same fear every time one of them appears. Even though it lingers after they’ve left.
Draco laughed, genuinely this time. “Minister. What scion of, as you so diplomatically put it, a political family doesn’t know the costs involved?”
“Hmmm?” Draco asks, suddenly distracted by something on the ceiling. “You know you’ve got a spot of—”
At half two he turned back the covers and shuffled to the window. The moon was almost new and he could barely make out the grounds, though he knew the map off by heart. The terrace gardens, the field beyond. Orchards to the left and the stables to the right, paddocks behind them. He thought of taking a Thestral out, just for the change of pace.
Annoyance drops from the man’s face when he recognises Robards and Harry in turn. It’s replaced with a sycophantic smile. “How can I help you?”
Draco’s now-familiar nausea makes a brief appearance as they make their way to the floor. He imagines the alternative wherein he never gets to do this again. He slides his arm around Harry’s waist.
She was expecting me. In all of this, that may still be among the biggest surprises. That she didn’t kick me out on sight, didn’t refuse me on principle.
Eventually he’d given up in favour of retreating to his sitting room with a fire, a book, and a few fingers of Lagavulin. Not that he could focus on the book, but turning pages was something to do.
“Right then.” She turned back to Potter, squeezed his arm, and let go, nudging him back towards his tart.
The man froze, then forced out a chuckle. “Must be happy to see you.” He moved Draco’s hand away from his thigh as smoothly as he could.
“I don’t think so,” He insisted, struggling to explain himself. “Pans, when you were arguing—who was in the kitchen first?”
I dodged, stupidly into a corner, and she cast it again straightaway. And then you jumped in front of me.
This time, Draco’s expression was clear. Realisation dawned, and he glanced across the tablecloth; Harry saw him reach down for his napkin, as though to shake it out, before he stopped himself. “Of course I do, yes. As an Animagus, she could go anywhere.”
“Want to look at you.” Harry slides up the bed and reaches into the bedside table for lube, which he holds out to Draco.
He catches Potter’s gaze and holds it. Trails a hand up the inside of Potter’s thigh to the thick hair at the base of his cock, and wraps a loose fist around the shaft. Potter’s eyes threaten to flutter shut until Draco squeezes, hard. Potter gets the message. They stay open after that.
Potter hesitated. “Hogwarts had them too, though. And they have them in Hogsmeade. Apple crumble and things.”
Malfoy looked up, startled, and his soft smile turned to a scowl. “Piss off.” He curled around the bird protectively and stomped past Harry, back towards the hide.
Harry grips his jumper and tugs, bringing it over his head in one almost-smooth motion. His nipples perk at the cold. He resists the urge to cover himself. He lets Draco look.
He steps forward, pressing his pelvis to Potter’s, feeling the hard ridge of his erection through all the layers between them. He slips a hand beneath the hem of Potter’s jumper and shivers when Potter jumps at the touch.
Millie reached across the table for his hand, but pulled back when he shook his head. “Not hearing them is his choice, too.”
“Some argue that any means are defensible in the pursuit of a virtuous end, as though our virtue only matters as it’s recorded in our histories or our legends. I say that virtue is something we must practise every day if we wish to be assured that our actions match our intentions. That we ought to be—that we are—measured by how we act as much as by what we hope to achieve. We must defend our means as well as our ends. And in this instance, the proposed means are indefensible.
“Lee has a great sense of humour. You, on the other hand, were petty and cruel and you have no right to defame upstanding citizens.”
. As though he’s never met me. As though he’s completely forgotten that I spent years under the thumb of a Dark Lord at the behest of my oh-so-loving father. As though my aunt, who never stopped declaring her love for He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Disrespected-In-This-House-Draco, hadn’t tortured a member of his Golden Trio. As though the love and warmth of Albus Dumbledore ever did a damn thing to protect my friends, as though the great benevolent headmaster didn’t know full well what I was doing and lead me into a nightmare regardless, just as he did Potter.
Harry tried to relax, tried to focus, tried to assimilate the sensation of Malfoy pushing into his arsehole over and over, striking up a steady rhythm that made him want nothing more than to be spread open and fucked till he forgot his own name.
“Why?” She narrowed her eyes at him. "Now you know we’ve got jobs. Wasn’t that the point? Save us from the streets? Keep us out of filthy hovels until we were back on our feet? Which, as you were certainly quick to point out, I could be if I’d only give up what you clearly think is a foolish attachment to the country of my birth.”
Harry was sure he'd come to the first day, to see the innocent freed. And fo the second week, to see the guilty condemned. But these few days of ambiguous cases...what to say of Narcissa Malfoy, who had saved his life weeks after she would've trussed him up and sent him to Voldemort on a silver platter? What to say of Gregory Goyle, undoubtedly too stupid to know any better, but dangerous all the same?
“The Wizengamot’s schedule operates independently of the Minister’s office. We didn’t know about it at the time.”
Draco releases Potter’s neck with a slick pop. He’s gasping for air, but that’s fine when Potter is too, when Potter’s pupils have cancelled out all that green and there’s a bruise coming in on his neck that Draco put there, that Potter loved having him put there. The air between them is electric, heavy, warm. He hums and moves in again.
Draco folds his arms, resting his glass on his elbow. Harry doesn’t know how he manages to be so frustrating and so elegant at the same time. “I read.”
“So I did.” Draco turned and leaned back against the railing. His features were cast so deeply in shadow that Harry couldn’t make out his expression. “That’s why I took some.”
“Yes,” Potter laughs, and Draco’s heart goes out to him even through the haze of jealously. “Totally sure. He doesn’t want me around.”
“Well they had to hide the Elder Wand, didn’t they? It wasn’t like one of the cases in your article where someone needs help using their wand. Part of the problem is that no one can know this Wand still exists, and this way no one does.”
When they reach the edge of Section H, Draco straightens his fingers and Potter’s hand falls away. “You should be able to make these identifications on your own.”
, destroyed a thousand-year old trolley system, and tore up a wizarding heritage building, and that was just the first act.”
He ran a hand over the wainscoting as he walked. 421, 422. He followed the signs until he found it. 426.
“In addition to discussing the broader points of the theory, I mentioned some concern that your treatment preference is motivated by your concern for others rather than by a genuine belief that this will be the best long-term resolution for you.”
And there is. Merlin, there is. He’s wanted to punch it. Wanted to kick it. Wanted to hex it. Wanted to wrap a time-turner around it and undo the web of scars he’s left on Malfoy’s chest. Wanted to make it invisible, irrelevant. Wanted to disappear it. Wanted to wrestle it to the ground and hold it there until Malfoy can’t do anything at all. Until he can’t do anything, for holding Malfoy down.
Draco barely avoided pointing out that “it” was not, in fact, an “it,” but a “him.” It couldn’t be his priority. He laughed. “Absolutely not.” He threw in a chuckle. “You confuse the lack of a fast result for the lack of a competent result. A problem you share with your colleague?” He raised an eyebrow.
"Neither do you." It wasn't his best, but if Malfoy wanted to talk about fighting like they were eleven...
He rocked back and stood, grabbing the discarded file on his way back to the sofa, wondering what Shacklebolt wanted this time and, depending on how it went, how he’d look wearing a Bouillabaisse.
Potter was thick and firm and hot in his hand. Perfectly weighty, shockingly soft. Potter dug his fingers into Draco’s arms and gasped, panting and rocking his hips in time with Draco’s strokes. Draco almost moaned at the sound of Potter’s pleasure gasped out into his neck.
Harry’s face went from worried to resigned in a flash, and he came to stand with his back against Draco’s.
“Er, yeah.” He ducks behind the door and pulls it out. He’s brought it in on a hanger to try to smooth some of the wrinkles, and hopes it’ll be okay. “Here you go.”
He tried to focus on what was in front of him. The floor. The dim spotlights cast randomly about. The paintings, though they registered more as shapes than as works of art. Malfoy.
“After the war, the stories stopped. And no one came to burn us at the stake, or take our magic. The trials…” This part was always harder for him. He missed his parents. He wished he didn’t. He swallowed. “The trials were fair.”
Lifting his arm, and her along with it, he peeked into her ears and frowned. He rolled her over, brushing the downy fur on her stomach and shaking his head. “There, there.” He traced a thumb over her forehead and replaced her. She covered her face with a paw and pushed into her mother’s belly.
“Yeah. Okay.” Harry stood shakily and walked to the sink. He rested the tip of the marble against the faucet and pressed it upwards. The tap glowed again and seemed to absorb the stone as Harry pressed it upwards.
Plus, there was only one Malfoy, and he wasn’t sure how to put the million pieces he’d just seen back together into one coherent person. Part of him wanted to ask him, but it didn’t seem like the sort of question anyone would be able to answer, and anyway, Malfoy was already off and walking.
“I don’t want to hurt you,” Harry said, blinking. As he seemed to come back to himself, Draco could see him moving further away. “Even if it’s not permanent.”
“Me?” Draco’s kept his voice soft on purpose, but his surprise was genuine. “You want me to try it?”
right by, one arm linked through Anthony Goldstein’s, slowing just enough to issue a self-satisfied smirk in my direction. From the sound of Goldstein’s moaning it was a bit time-sensitive, but really.
He leapt to his feet, came to me, gripped my arm, woeful, apologetic. “I needed to get you out. We couldn’t—you shouldn’t go to Azkaban for this. Not when what you’re saying—”
Surely, Harry thought, an admiring gaze and a bite of chicken would be good cover during the search for an explanation that would redirect Malfoy without leaving hints for any nearby murderers. “Did you know, Hermione once caught Rita Skeeter in a jar?”
“Would that be so bad?” Potter blurts. There’s a pause between them, broken when the insult sets in and Potter adds, “Hey! I’m not a bad drunk.”
He drops the closet in front of Potter, letting it clatter as it hits the ground. It looks like a children’s item, or so Draco hopes, as it’s covered in glitter and has deformed gnomes painted on the doors. “Yours, I assume? The taste is right."
Potter barks out a half-laugh. “Yeah, well, you didn’t exactly say what for. Curiosity killed the cat and all that.”
Malfoy had offered his shower, but hadn’t said anything about what to do afterwards. He’d offered the couch as a bed earlier, too, so presumably he wouldn’t mind if Harry slept there. But Harry knew he’d toss and turn; sleep felt even further away than it had the last time he’d tried.
“Yours is a unique case, yes. But in terms of retraining yourself…” He sighed. “Stop me if it all gets boringly technical, but essentially, children are more prone to accidental magic because they don’t know how to direct their casting. Magical schools teach us how to channel our magic so it behaves as we want it to. We do that by directing the magical energy through the bones in our casting arms, as bone is very magically conductive. That’s part of why Muggle science is instructive, and why the implants work.
“No! It fucking isn’t! I refuse to speak with this twat! I don’t give two shits if he’s a policeman! He’s a cunt and he knows it!” I shout in answer, interrupting the man opposite me.
"So, Tyler Jospeh, am I correct?" The doctor reentered, a small smile on her face. I nodded. "I'm Dr. Rosenthal, and I'll be examining you today. I understand this is a very invasive procedure, and I am sorry for an discomfort you may feel. This does however lead to a much higher chance of discovering your assailant, especially when it can be so painful to recall the events so soon after it all happening." Yeah, like fifteen minutes ago. "I'll be swabbing the inside of your vagina for any remaining semen, and then I'll also search for any hair samples that have been left. Are you ok for us to proceed now?" I nodded, and slotted my feet where I was told. I grabbed the bed as hard as I could when I felt a pair of tweezers around my crotch. She pulled out after a minute.
”Yeah, but if you could hear yourself when you say it, and I mean hear it like I do, you would pretty much cum. Trust me. It’s the hottest thing to come out of your mouth.” I take a couple steps forward so I’m almost touching him and look up to him through hooded eyelids.
“There’s medicine, some water and also a chamomile tea. I added some honey because I know you’re never keen on herbal teas. Also I’m putting a temporary ban on weed for you, only until you’re better.”
After cake and wine, and a few hours of peaceful conversation, Draco was finally alone again in his apartment.
"Colour?" I asked, as I brought a hand up to his face to run my thumb along his lower lip, softly gesturing where I wanted to kiss him.
"I did everything but wipe your arse, of course it was fun." Draco replied, but there was not real bite to his tone.
”Dean’s invited me over because ‘I seem cool’ but I’m biding my time until he realises he wants my sweet arse.” He giggles.
"Get fucked." I throw back, leaning against the counter, glad that Draco's shirt fell down past my mid-thigh, covering my thong. I think I would have died if he saw it. I'm about to say something about him and Teddy when Draco walks in, coming to stand by me.
“Draco, you fingered me twice. You’re hardly my husband.” I speak, not caring if either Teddy or Andromeda can hear me.
“I’m an officer of the law! If you don’t let go of me I’ll have every cop in Britain on your asses until the day you die!” He spits.
"He asked me-" Blaise started to say, but I didn't let him finish as I raced up the stairs. I walked through the bullpen with purpose, the detectives around me giving me odd looks. I headed straight to the holding cell to see Goyle sat, leaning against the wall. He looked up, and smirked when he saw me, looking pleased with himself.
Regardless, I knew I couldn’t spend the day wasting away in bed, I had a duty to my gang, to my family.
"Baby you're so perfect." He whispers, holding me close to him as he pulls the covers over us. Despite the cum seeping out of my ass, I fall asleep quickly in Draco's arms.
I look at the wall of panties in front of me, amazed by how many different styles there were. Every colour known to man and every fabric that could even be considered slightly sexy. There were thongs and panties and g-strings and boxers. Upon further inspection, these boxers did have holes in the rear for easy access, so they weren’t as vanilla as originally thought. As I’m browsing, someone walks up behind me.
"Yeah, ran into my cafe when I was closing up last night. He seems to trust me, but that's probably just because I fed him." The vet nodded and began to examine the cat as best it could. "It's injured, on it's back leg." Draco mentioned before shutting up. The vet was quick to bandage the wound, before she scanned for a chip.
“He’s the best distraction I’ve ever tasted, I’ll tell you that.” Scorp slips his arm around Teddy’s waist, pressing a kiss to the blushing boy’s face.
“You coming, James?” He asked one evening, standing at the bottom of the stairs, ready to head to bed. It’d been a long and busy day and Draco was exhausted.
“It’s still fraternising with the enemy.” I comment dryly. Malfoy looks taken aback, and I go to speak with my gang member.
"You know, as a police captain, I suppose it's in my blood to enjoy seeing justice get served. It's just a shame you went so easy on him." I couldn't believe what I was hearing. "Perhaps take the day off and see your boyfriend." He added, before heading back to his office. I stood for a second, everyone else in the bullpen unsure of what they had just witnessed.
Sorry I’ve been gone for so long, also no smut this chapter (I really want to get some in soon though I promise!!). Enjoy loves xx
Not only that. Draco has had to buy a bloody bed, litter tray, and a heaping of toys for James. Not that the ungrateful bastard used them. James slept on Draco’s bed and always went to the toilet outside. Even the toys seemed to get abandoned after a couple hours.
“I’m not going to sleep with you, Malfoy.” The blue haired one grumbles. I stop myself from laughing.
“Gran won’t let me dye my hair again. It’s been a whole month! I’m getting bored with blue.” He frowns, before sending a glare through the walls to where the kitchen is.
"Give me a minute, baby. Don't go getting impatient." The lube bottle cap flips open and I can tell he's covering himself with it. I wiggle my ass at him, showing him how very impatient I am, and yelp when he flips me over. "I want to see your beautiful face when we fuck, baby. Plus this way you can't cover your mouth." He smirks, before pressing a quick kiss to my forehead. He lines himself up with my hole and begins to press hips tip against me. It slips in and I let out a groan.
Unfortunately his guest was a bitch and stuck their foot into the door before it could close. It opened back up, revealing his ex-best friend.
His arms encased me. They were warm and strong; they were protective; they were safe. And I knew it wasn't Draco, Draco who would always keep me out of harm, but Blaise was here with me and he would try and do the same, for Draco's sake. Knowing they were close friends, I trusted Blaise as much as I trusted Draco, or even my own friends. I felt a lot better about him being with Neville.
"Thanks. I'll let you get back to whatever you were doing." I waved goodbye and left the house, returning to my own room. Once I was there, I received a phone call from a withheld number.
“Your own café? Very muggle,” Blaise chuckled. “Well, I’m not really busy at the moment, my better half’s up at Hogwarts though so it gets lonely.”
“Fuck, baby.” Is all Draco says before I feel him release deep into me, ropes of cum flooding my insides. He waits a second, both of our heavy breathing loud in the now quiet room, before slipping out of me. I feel his cum dripping out of me but I let my ass fall onto the bed. Draco presses his lips to my lower back before turning my over and scooping me into his arms. “Well done baby. I’m so proud of you.” I keen again at the praise, pressing my head into his sweaty chest.
”Daddy please.” I sigh, my voice barely a whisper. He hears me, however, and brings a hand down on my right asscheek sharply, making a loud smack noise. I yelp at the shock, but not the pain.
"Exclusive interview... missing you every day... just isn't like him..." Draco muttered, reading the article. "Load of bollocks," He summarised neatly, throwing the paper back onto the table
”Beg me.” His voice is stern. “Good boys ask nicely to have their dick sucked. You want to be a good boy?” I nod desperately, growing wetter at his words.
He filled out the form as best he could, scribbing a question mark or three in the box for the pet's name. Like he'd bloody know that.
"Oh," was all he said. 'DNA' pretty much gave it away without me having to retell the details. "Does Draco know?"
"The big things, the small things. I like seeing how much he's grown since Hogwarts, how he's become a better person. I like how he knows how I take my coffee. How he doesn't get out of bed until I'm awake because he doesn't want to wake me. How sometimes he still goes to put a bowl of water out for James. How he's honest with me. About everything. How he doesn't treat me any differently because of my past, because of
"Miss Potter," a horrible voice growls as a hand grabs my neck, squeezing tightly and pushing me against the fence. I'm forced to look at my attacker, seeing the fat fuck Goyle glaring at me like I'm a piece of shit on his shoe. My hand flies to his hand, trying to pull it away from my neck as I gasp for air.
”Keep your hands up here.” He orders, before moving down to my crotch. His tongue dips momentarily into me before it flicks up to my clit. He swirls his tongue around me, before wrapping his lips around it, sucking on it gently. The urge to grab his hair is overwhelming , but I keep my hands above my head as I let out a loud moan, definitely audible from downstairs. “That’s right, baby. Let everyone know how good I treat you.” The next few minutes are a series of him sucking and licking at me and me letting out moan after moan.
Until Potter drops to his knees, pulling Draco’s trousers and pants down to mid-thigh as he goes. He looks up at Draco with that same insatiability, and he doesn’t look away as he swallows Draco’s cock.
His footsteps got louder, it seemed, the closer he came to the bottom. There was nowhere for them to fall away to, no chance of them fading into silence.
Circe, but Draco loved this. Potter’s secret kinks, his displays of power and his obvious pleasure in them. This side of him no one else could see. “Could do.”
There was only one thing to do, then. He gripped the neck of a very nice Bourdeaux and rounded the corner. He heard voices once he was in the dining room, and then he was looking into the kitchen.
Draco scowled at the stack of papers that rested on the end table. It hadn’t been more than a few dozen times, and that was a matter of tying up loose ends. “What did he say?”
Harry doesn’t take a second helping; he can’t stand them knowing he’s still hungry, so hungry, when everyone looks like they’re chewing straw.
The headphones had the unfortunate side effect of amplifying the sounds of one's own body, and all Draco could hear in the ensuing silence was the blood rushing through his ears.
“To sit by your bedside? You’re decent-looking enough, but looks alone can hardly hold one’s interest for eight hours.”
He’d been stunned the first time he’d seen an irregular canvas; had stood, agog, in front of a trapezoid so bursting with colour that he couldn’t have any reaction to it that
Draco blinked again, trying to parse the various types of confusion that had settled in his stomach at Potter’s offer. He finally picked one at random. “Are you trying to make me out as a fool?”
Draco collected a pile of papers from his desk, looking down quickly in a hopefully subtle attempt to ensure he had everything he needed, or didn’t want Potter to discover. “I’ll be in the reception area out front.”
A right at arm chairs, past sofas – there’s no way Potter will be able to find him now – and he starts breathing again when he reaches beds. He can see it now, by the back wall. It isn’t official, of course, but it seemed eminently reasonable that every workplace should have a break room and this, nestled at the far end of the department, is Draco’s.
The candles around them flared to life, bathing the room in soft, flickering light. The snake raised its head, slithering towards Harry and flicking its tongue to taste the air.
He startles to hear Potter use his name like that. It’s one thing when someone’s got your cock in their mouth, but this…Merlin.
He can hear the beginnings of half-formed sputterings trying to escape Potter’s mouth, but nothing coherent makes it through save one squeaky word. “Sales?”
“I’d ask what that’s supposed to mean, but I strongly suspect you’re trying to change the topic.” He laughed. “Though, now you mention it, I do have some rather up close and personal experience with evil. You’re not it, Potter.”
He walks into the warehouse silently. He wouldn’t want to distract Potter with the door or his footsteps. Not that Potter would even notice, given the way he walks. Though he’s considerably quieter in those brogues, which really do look quite charming with that jumper.
“You can’t tell me that the old portrait of Walburga Black has you convinced that art is meant to be pretty and historical.”
Draco looked at her sceptically. “Anything else—anything at all, no matter how trivial it may seem, or how much you may not want to tell me—that I might want to know?”
“Yes, I had thought about that too. Though I do want to note—perhaps it’s the researcher in me—that the common thread in those cases is that witches and wizards had trouble using their magic as a result of illness. The problem didn’t come from their wands, as is the case here, nor does a conventional implant fix a wand. The wand is secondary to how magic moves through the body. The implants, which usually are very small and implanted in a finger, create a sort of bridge between a witch’s or wizard’s magic and their wand so their magic is channeled as they see fit, rather than coming in uncontrolled outbursts. Those are very different scenarios to yours.”
“I want,” Draco takes a deep breath, steeling himself to say it again. “I want you. And so, all the things that—” he cuts himself off. “I want to see your room.”
Draco stepped back and huffed a laugh. “You admit it then. It’s everything. You’re giving up everything.”
.” The tree trunks turned ashy and fissures split the wood; the soft, fresh grass stiffened into plastic; the smell of recirculated air began to overtake the fresh grass. Malfoy leaned in and Harry heard him hit a switch. The lights blinked out.
“So…” Harry knit his brow. “That’s it? You just want me to cast that spell? No offense, but it seems like a bit of a step backwards.”
Several dozen Aguamentis later, Draco is at a loose end again. There are the ferns he keeps in his own break area. Perhaps those need attention.
Draco leaned back, incredulous. “It’s the whole bloody Wand, isn’t it? You put the entire sodding Wand
The elves had arranged four settees around a central coffee table, and covered it in cakes and fruit and a full tea set. With, he noticed, the least fragile of the Malfoy china. He really needed to find some way to reward Galder that wouldn’t set him to prostrating himself to the point of inconvenience. Weasley sat with Robards on one settee. Head Unspeakable Croaker looked uncomfortably at ease on another, with Granger next to him. The Minister and Millie, notepad perched on her lap and quill in hand, took the third.
Draco sighed and looked away. “Yes and no. Dittany lessened the appearance of the scars and prevented infection but, as is almost always the case with curse damage, it wasn’t possible to completely prevent scarring.”
He half-leans, half-collapses forward in relief, resting his forehead against Harry’s ribs and daring to wrap his fingers around Harry’s shaft.
When he looked back, Malfoy's shoulders were still framed in the low light coming from the desk, almost an outline against the window and the dark sky beyond. Harry took it in, then shoved the door open. "You like challenges so much, Malfoy? Here's one."
In the glow of those lights, Harry was finishing his speech. “In our first full year of operation, we’ve provided counselling to dozens of survivors of the Voldemort War, demand is only growing. Our pre-trial intervention programmes have helped reduce the recurrence of spousal and child abuse, as well as decreasing instances of substance abuse and related infractions. If nothing else, we might ask you to give tonight because we’re all enjoying a drunk-and-disorderly-free Diagon Alley.” He laughed lightly, and the audience followed.
His first instinct was to ask Malfoy to explain, but Malfoy already had. He’d explained more than once and, in spite of Harry’s doubts, he’d not only told the truth, but undersold his efforts. Harry couldn’t think of anything more he could ask. When he sat back and lined the pamphlets up side by side in front of him, it didn’t seem like a question of asking at all. It was a question of whether or not he could believe what Malfoy had told him.
He can’t stop watching Harry. The way he walks, the way he turns his head so he can speak to Draco even when Draco’s behind him. The way he takes a pinch of Floo Powder in his fingers and announces the address with the sort of certainty he hadn’t had at 20.
Between Shacklebolt and Robards, a tiny, wizened witch stood and cleared her throat. “As Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot I, Griselda Marchbanks, CDMG, APMO, fdBB, call this session to order, that the Status, Ancestry, and Family Equality Act be read a third time proceeding expert testimony. Recognising Honourable Warlock Alistair Flint.
The saviour of the wizarding world squeaked. The thinnest, highest, reediest sort of embarrassed squeal.
He was visibly nervous. Perhaps for knowing what we would be doing, or for remembering the last time. He dragged his feet getting upstairs, kept having one last thing to do or find or put away. To be fair, I didn’t intervene. I may’ve been a bit nervous as well. There was so much at stake.
He had a plan, he reminded himself. He would find out what Malfoy had meant, exactly. Forearmed was forewarned.
Potter and I have a Seeker’s game planned for this Sunday morning. Warming the pitch up before the first match of the season. Must have my broom polished before then.
Granger was looking at him warily, but did not ask after the discrepancies between the story he’d just told and the one he had given her. He figured it was just as well that he had already resolved to like her.
He choked back a moan when Draco’s hand wrapped around his cock and struck up a slow rhythm, bucking his hips forward instead, jerking into Draco’s fist.
“No? You weren’t the ones trying to run off everyone you thought had impure magic? Kill everyone who disagreed?”
Draco felt a wave of warmth travel over him. It relaxed his shoulders and ended at his toes, and when it had passed he took stock, and the duvet was dry. “Nice,” he said, hoping his very genuine appreciation came through. “Now, shall we get under them?”
And Potter stood there, still as a sculpture, seemingly rooted to the spot, eyes still locked with Draco’s.
But he was nothing if not inventive. “Fine.” He dropped it on his desk and stepped away. “We’ll see if you prefer going without. Bend over.”
What you did to Neville…I don’t even know what to say to you about that. I guess on that one it’s good you’re not awake. Not that – I do want you to wake up. I wish that you hadn’t been hurt in the first place. But right now I’m really angry at you about what you did to him. He was just trying something out, and there’s nothing wrong with that. And you set him up for it. His face when I told him I had your journal – he looked like the whole world was gonna fall down. He told me that you gave the pictures back yesterday, but what if things had gone differently? Were you just going to keep them forever? Make him do stuff for you forever?
Harry took a bite and, at the sound of a tiny moan, Draco ducked his head to hide a quick grin. “Holy hell, that’s good.”
Draco swallows him down, his fist meeting his mouth as he covers Potter’s shaft. He brings his free hand to Potter’s bollocks, rolling them in his palm. Potter’s ramblings grow more urgent.
“Thanks.” He brushes his fingers over mine as he accepts the glass. “Didn’t know you were moonlighting.”
Licks the spot and moves down, biting Malfoy’s clavicle and laving the ridge of bone that drops down into a divot above his shoulder.
He isn’t offered a drink. He isn’t offered a seat. He isn’t sure whether Potter’s just that rude, or making him uncomfortable intentionally. Harry had told him, once, as they’d lain across the bed upstairs, that he’d almost been sorted Slytherin. Draco can see it.
“No, no. Wouldn’t want the Ministry to look like a bunch of bullies. They’re calling off the investigation. Pursuing new youth programming. It’s over.”
Draco straightened his tie and his spine. Potter had been an acquisition just like any other. There was no need to make anything of it. Potter certainly hadn’t wanted to.
He throws his cloak on, stalks back to Draco, and plucks the Snitch from his fingers. “This. This is the point.”
“Right.” Draco sighed and crossed his arms. “Send the elves. I don’t know what’s got Prippa so enamoured with you, but I’m sure she’ll do it.”
The sixty-third day after the Battle of Hogwarts is a Saturday just like all the other Saturdays that have marked the last month of Harry’s life. He spends the afternoon cleaning house. Makes a light dinner. Takes a bath.
Draco wanted to slap himself. He’d tried to put it out of his mind because what he thought Harry might mean was too much to comprehend, quite. And then, stupidly, he’d gone and blocked it out so thoroughly he’d forgotten what the question might imply. “Again, you, of course, don’t have to answer that. It’s completely private, between you and your Healer, and you’ve no obligation to share any information.” He felt like a first year, stumbling over his words in a search for some right answer he didn’t yet know how to give.
“I know that there are a million other more useful things you could’ve tried to get out of me. Crime scene access. Exclusive interviews.”
“Frozen,” Draco confirmed. “Though the elves are taking care of it. Should be put to rights by lunchtime.”
He stripped off, folding his clothes neatly next to the sink and laying his holster and wand on top of them. He’d long since learned that putting the same clothes back on again was easier if he folded them while they were off. The taps were tricky—of course they were—but he kept himself out of the spray until he figured it out, and when the warm water washed over him he melted as easily as he had when Malfoy—
Just as Flint seemed set to retort, Harry raised his head and stood tall and proud, meeting Flint’s eye, and then other members’, reaching Marchbanks. His voice was as confident as ever it had been, but so quiet that the members had to lean forward to hear his last enjoined: “Choose greatness. Most of all, choose goodness.”
When Potter pulled back, the cold air around them rushed in, and for one long moment Draco felt frozen down to his bones.
“There’s a sofa in my office. Come on.” He turned towards the office and heard Potter following behind him as they crossed through the massive front gallery, through a smaller room, and to the office tucked behind a plain white door. He flipped the lights on. “Voilà.”
He’d been through worse. This wasn’t the Forest of Dean. It was climate-controlled and well-lit, and he’d bet that Malfoy had a bottle of wine tucked away somewhere if things got really desperate. And there was no genocidal maniac trying to kill him, which was a distinct plus.
It was another long minute before Harry could put his question to words. “Luna, when did Draco tell you that?”
“Anyway. They tried having him visit it every day, but it became more and more agitated each time he left.”
He knows his smile is sad, but he owes them at least the attempt. Though the topic of forgiveness is still a difficult one. He groans and plants his forehead on the table top. “Ask Potter.”
“Yes. In the middle of a duel they had Weasley ‘trip’ into him. Potter pretended to fall with him and, voilà. Broken wand. Made sure the criminals they were chasing saw it and let word spread from there.”
“I believe you are referring to a Bundt pan, which will be found with non-seasonal baking goods. Are there any other seasonal items, as far as you can recall?”
Harry locked eyes with Luna. “I’ve got a bleeding magical spoonbill in my arms and I hear that’s quite rare and important. Coordinates?”
Draco shook his head, tiredness making it feel leaden. “You can’t keep beating the odds forever. That’s not a lack of faith. That’s…” He sighed. “It’s a different kind of faith, I suppose. Believing it’s important to protect someone from harm, rather than putting them in its way and trusting they’ll come through.”
“I’ve thought about your question from yesterday, about whether there’s anything I’d like to do, and I’ve decided that I’d rather pass on the walk, if it’s all the same to you. I thought I might take this lot—” he reached up to ruffle the kitten’s fur “—to the gardens. I’ll be out of the void that way, and I don’t want them to come to any harm.”
“People and things you care about,” Draco repeated tentatively. His heart felt like it was beating much too quickly.
"On the WNN's Breakfast Show?" Harry paused. His voice had dropped an interval, and Draco wished that he could see his face. "The radio?"
I didn’t finish it till Sunday morning and then I wasn’t sure what to do. I came back to school like usual and you weren’t at dinner or in the common room. Pansy was at dinner, which I was glad about, since at least it meant you weren’t having sex with her in the actual moment, but then she disappeared and I got a little worried. Guess I needed to know.
Something scared flashed across Pansy’s features before they settled into a tight smile. “You made a promise.”
When he got back, a silver hare was trying in vain to eat the ferns that were wedged between McSullivan’s roses. It looked up curiously as soon as Harry entered, and Luna’s voice poured out of it. “When spoonbills look for a mate, they engage in the same bill-clatter, snapping, and trumpeting used during confrontations.”
Draco starts walking before Potter can reply. When he turns, he sees Potter in his periphery, looking hurt and bewildered and on the verge of crumbling. Draco walks faster.
“Oh, yes, of course. Hermione told me that the first day. I don’t though. Withdraw my consent, I mean. A walk is fine.”
“A clock?” Potter’s face lights and his eyes follow it as Draco adds it to the row. He looks half-ready to follow it the thing.
In the silence, Potter began to look even more uncertain than he already had, and Draco rushed to move on.
Draco’s headache was so acute that he could feel his brow furrow. She went on before he could ask about her formality.
He wants to know so badly, has been so focused on the item in his hands, that he’s forgotten to ask Malfoy for the rest of his clothes. He shrugs into the jumper. “Um?"
Harry’s sweat-slicked chest slid against Draco’s when he moved up for another kiss. Draco moaned at the skin-to-skin contact, and again when Harry withdrew, still hissing. “
Draco gestured down the boardwalk and began to walk towards the dunes. Harry followed close behind, and realised Draco was slowing down to let him catch up.
“Flowers, wine, liquor. It’s hardly practical for the everyday, but I would’ve accepted the ‘74 Quattroporte.” He took a turn to roll his eyes at Potter’s blank confusion. “It’s a Maserati, Potter. That’s a car.”
The thing that tugged at his chest pulled harder. He took another step into the room and let the door shut behind him.
Though maybe he’d think Paris in November was perfectly lovely or, coming from London, at least very normal.
“It’s hardly the same thing,” Robards blustered. “Rookwood was a wanted criminal. Auror Potter is a—”
You feel his breath ghost over your cheek when he turns back. You don’t move, don’t care that your legs ache, don’t look, don’t see. Not when he leans in. Not when he waits for you to turn. Not when he pulls back. Not when he stands and zips his flies.
I will say this for Pansy, though. While Blaise is off rubbing elbows with the victors and Goyle’s trying to remember his own name and the other eighth years are busy pretending we don’t exist, she’s far less deluded than most about what it will take to regain our place in this world. Her name may only have been slightly less tarnished than mine, but she seems to be climbing out of that hole one fuck at a time, and if she’s willing to take me with her so much the better.
This moves and squirms and pounds and strobes and it’s not dead but it does not live and you get that. It gets you.
Weasley nodded. “Accepted. Goshawk, Wilkins, Finnigan, remain on alert. In case of attack, remove the targets from the vicinity.” When his team nodded, Weasley moved toward the door and pushed. It opened easily. Noise spilled into the entryway. Weasley nodded to Goshawk, who opened the opposite door.
With a swirl of his oil-painted cloak, Snape swept from the frame, and Draco sank down on the seat and let out a noise halfway between a groan and a whimper.
“Today we will focus on recovering kitchenware. Do you use the kitchen yourself, or would it be more effective to send your elf?” He is very much hoping for the latter.
He wanted more. The single thin strip of Malfoy’s skin wasn’t enough. He wanted it pressed against him, wanted to be consumed by it.
“If you think walking around a field is going to make me discover some deep-seated fear of cigars or tunnels or the Weasleys or something, you’re barking.”
Blaise asked Greg if it was a busy season for moving, and it served to split the table, to Draco’s relief. Pansy picked at her chicken in agitated silence. Millie let her arm brush against Blaise’s as she joined in his conversation with Greg. And at the end of the table, Granger was asking Potter a series of questions that left him looking a bit beleaguered. He leaned forward often to smile kindly or make his reassurance more emphatic, though she didn’t look wholly convinced. They were well into the course before he seemed to turn the tide. He said something that made her laugh and started asking her question after question, relaxing as the focus turned towards Granger and away from him.
They were sketches. Each was drawn in pencil, and somewhere amidst his shock, Harry noticed that they were beautifully done. Each one captured an aspect of a crime scene. The crime scenes for the case they were supposed to be helping solve.
Back to kitchenware, for a set of bright red ramekins that he’d just filed away towards the end of last week – more carnage from the holidays, most likely.
I’d be happier about it if it undid the actual curse, though. It matters a lot less if you won’t wake up. Madame Pomfrey took you off all the potions yesterday and said you can wake up any time, but that you won’t until your body’s healed enough. That it could be just a day or two more of rest, or it could be that you lost too much blood and were out for too long. It’s not that I’m not still mad at you over some of this stuff, but I don’t want that awful conversation to be the last one we ever have. And I still really need to know if you were telling the truth, for sure. And I really want to tell you I love you again, so you can hear it.
He’s sick of trying not to think about him. He’s sick of pretending he doesn’t want to. He’s sick of feeling like he shouldn’t want to. He’s sick of feeling like every damn thing in his life is meant to keep him from the few, precious things that actually feel right.
Instinct has always served him well before. It’s what’s got him through this, after all, and a war, and a few dodgy cases since. And it’s what compels him as he moves back towards the lot of them, drops to the ground if front of Draco, grabs him by the robes, and hauls him in for a kiss from which he holds nothing back.
Harry steadied himself on an armchair and looked up. Malfoy’s fists were bunched at his sides and his face was flushed, pupils dilated and his mouth slightly open. He was breathing heavily and his shoulders were tense. The bulge in his trousers was beginning to recede though, Harry noticed, it was still impressive. Rather like Harry’s own, which was, for reasons he didn’t especially want to consider, becoming larger.
Draco, who remained oddly rattled by Potter’s general agreeableness, hesitated. “Are you not used to being told about your treatment plan?”
Potter dropped his arm, but kept his eyes trained on the spot where tile and shield had met until Finnigan body-checked him, throwing his weight into Potter with a grin. “Wish you woulda done that to this perp we had last week.”
There was a crick in his neck and the unmistakable stickiness of sweat. Before he’d fully returned to consciousness, he had reason to be cross.
“It’s fine, Granger. If the quality of his insults is anything to go by, Potter’s still stuck in sixth year. Must make it very difficult to understand change.”
He decides to walk. It’s not really an hour’s walk, but he’ll make it into one. Better than sitting restlessly at his desk for another second, he thinks.
There is a murmured incantation, and then he hears the wet sound of Draco stroking himself. It’s all he can do not to turn and watch. Merlin, but he wants to see.
“No,” Draco mouthed back, shaking his head, trying to reassure Potter. “Sorry,” he mouthed, breaking into a whisper.
“You’re absolutely barking.” Draco’s incredulity was rapidly turning into rage. “Is there something in the water at the MLE, driving you all mad?”
It’s Harry who makes the first move. Draco feels his pinkie brush the side of Draco’s palm, and he reaches out to return the caress. Harry links their fingers together and pulls Draco’s hand towards him until they’re holding hands properly.
Draco looked away and shook his head, and Harry felt the loss of his focus as acutely as if someone had ripped away his coat.
“I will find a solution. I have ideas. But I need more time. It’s, what, 60 hours until the surgery? That’s not nearly enough. Not by a mile.”
He scoured the shelves in a panic and started flipping through volume upon volume as quickly as he could. He was still reading when Galder set a tea tray on the far end of the table, when Lobsey removed the untouched food again, when the sconces flared to life at sunset. He was so focused he almost missed the sound of heels approaching.
Robards spoke over Weasley before he could get any further. “As we have informed the Minister, and as the Minister told you directly at our last meeting, we believe it would create an untenable safety risk.”
“Good morning.” Draco is composed. Clear. Exactly as intended. “Welcome to the Vanishing Department. How may we help you?”
That was where Lobsey found him, bearing a note from Potter that suggested 2pm. Draco accepted graciously, and tried to figure out what to do with the next four hours.
“Yeah,” Harry mumbles. Then, “Draco,” he says, louder—loud enough for Draco to pause in his walk to the bathroom. “It’s not what I want. What—What I mean to say is, I don’t mind people knowing. You know. Better that than things being all…weird.”
Malfoy sighed and withdrew his hand. “No, I did not. Is there some ridiculous Muggle concoction you prefer?”
Harry freezes, barely sticking an arm out in time to catch the door before it swings back to hit him.
Harry felt agitation creeping along his skin. He wanted to burst out of it altogether. He wasn’t sure if that was because Malfoy was wrong or because Malfoy was right, but he knew which he would prefer. “Or you’re doing exactly what you were raised to do. A wolf in sheep’s clothing is still a fucking wolf, Malfoy.”
“As far as we know, sir, over the course of the past several years, when neither of them was seeing anyone else they would, from time to time, until recently, go out to various nightclubs together. Occasionally, those occasions ended in a particularly…climactic fashion for one or both of them. Even more occasionally, rumour has it, the…climactic piece was a shared one.”
There was another funny word. As though Draco had one. The closest thing he’d have was the next minute or two to think on his feet. “What safety precautions will you have in place?”
Harry tugs Draco’s shirt tails free, spreads shirt and robe both, and bends to place a kiss on his sternum. It’s light at first, almost tentative. Then another, firmer.
Draco wanted to laugh. Not mockingly, not at all, but in wonder at the idea that Harry could still have any doubt about the intensity of Draco’s attraction, or that he might think he needed Draco’s permission, or might be waiting for it.
He backed away and tried to get his bearings, and found it almost impossible. Some of the lights were constant, some seemed to shimmer and strobe, others winked on and off. They looked less like lights than like the fairies that took over the meadow behind the Burrow in mid-July, but this wasn’t a meadow and these couldn’t be fairies. The lights stretched on forever, boundless. Some hung over his head, others right in front of him, and there were others he had to weave around to avoid walking into them. Each was contained within a warm glass bulb.
The room was almost dark by the time I collapsed on to him. I lay on his collarbone and let him trace patterns on my shoulder blades. He kissed the top of my head; I kissed his chest, maybe his heart. We didn’t say anything.
Draco snorted. “Feel that way? Don’t bother.” He shook his head. “You’re making the biggest mistake of your life.”
Only, when he turns, Potter is sitting outside his window on a broomstick, looking more amused than he has any right to be.
“Oh, of course,” Draco gushes, “it’s my mission in life to please the Boy Who Lived. Didn’t you know? I’ll have everything sorted and repaired and goodness, if there’s time I’ll wrap each item up with its very own bow.”
They come to a stop a third of the way down the aisle. Malfoy picks up a pair of boots and holds them out to Harry. “These arrived at the same time as your things. Do they look familiar?”
McGonagall turned and began to lead Harry, Hermione, and Draco past the Great Hall and up the staircase. Hermione fell into step with her and began describing the ritual while Draco and Harry trailed behind, not looking at each other and refusing to acknowledge the glares of Snape’s portrait, which followed them through the final corridor.
A week and a half of sleepless nights and too many drinks and torturous memories would put anyone round the twist, he reasons. And he’s probably just overtired and needs to get it out of his system. Needs to get anything that can jog those memories out of his life.
“You think you know better than everyone else. Life and death in your hands. Is that why you became a doctor? The power of it? Deciding who lives? Who to save?”
Draco coughs pointedly, though he’s already fairly certain that this is not the sort of person who will take a hint, pointed or otherwise.
what I care about. Mummy and daddy can be so dim. It’s certainly a bit insane to think anyone would want to live in that dark, decrepit old pile of rubble.”
It seemed possible, like this. Seemed like maybe he could be a better man. It didn’t have to be a show, a game. Climbing the ladder. Restoring the Malfoy name. Influence. The ear of the Wizengamot. Control. Power. In Potter’s mouth, with Potter’s eyes looking into his, he thought, maybe it could be something else.
Harry jumped back, shocked. He'd forgotten about Malfoy's hidden wand pocket. Stupid, that. Not that he'd admit it. "What the fuck, Malfoy?"
Draco tries to continue in his task. He’s fairly certain he makes it look like it. He shuffles papers. Puts them in piles. Rustles them around when Potter comes through.
“No,” Draco stepped back for Harry to cross the threshold. “Please.” He closed the door behind Harry. “Something to drink?”
Harry doesn’t answer. He looks rather confused by the question, as though it hadn’t occurred to him that something like that would or should count.
“Okay,” Harry said. “The last time I saw you, you were leaving. You left. Which—” he held up his palms in surrender before Draco could speak “—I knew you were going to do. You told me what it was, and I had my choice to make, and I made it, and I’d make the same choice again.”
I lowered the volume and suggested it had been a friendly bit of assistance, in deference to his injury.
The day’s incidents were added to his running list. Time, place, event, outcome, what Potter had been doing at the time of the outburst and how he had reacted to it. He compared it with the records he’d received from the Department of Mysteries. For all the words they used, they didn’t actually give much information. Date, event, outcome. Speculation on what might have incited the Wand, but very little about Potter. He wondered how much Granger might remember.
And there was Harry, looking nervous and a bit frantic, his breath catching when he saw Draco. He leaned against the door heavily, looking queasy and grateful, and Draco had to stop himself, again, from leaning in to kiss him.
He wondered what it would be like to kiss Draco. He’d wondered before, all those years ago. Had wondered when they were falling off bar stools. Had wondered when he was lying alone in bed at night, though he hadn’t wanted to admit it. Had wondered about more than kissing him, if he was honest. Had wondered if that same spark would be there. The push and pull, the piss-taking, the precious, precarious balance between challenge and understanding. He wondered what he would do if this didn’t live up to what he’d imagined. He wondered what he would do if it did.
He thanked her for the second time in one day. She didn’t look any less surprised, though it was cut short by Millie’s insistence that he move.
“Both.” Harry hesitated. “I’ve been thinking a lot, lately.” His cheeks pinked and he looked down at the floor. “I might have more things to tell people soon. Or, another thing. Still figuring it out, I guess. But I might. Or, I think I will. Just figuring out what exactly it is, if that makes sense.”
Again. He jumps, aims back towards the tree. He manages, this time, to slow himself with time to spare. There’s less room than he’d ideally like between his nose and hundreds of pounds of hardwood, but he’s managed. And even if he hadn’t, it’s not like he’s never had his nose broken before.
“Do what?” Draco asked, trying to hide the hoarseness that threatened to invade his own voice, and ignoring the distinct possibility that his question was born more of disbelief than obstinance.
Malfoy goes a bit green at the reminder. Harry’s stomach twists when Malfoy turns away. What if he’s forgotten? Or changed his mind? Or, well, it’s not Harry’s problem if Malfoy doesn’t want his company. He needs his things. Even if Malfoy does seem to be in charge around here, surely he wouldn’t just keep them out of spite? Probably?
Granger choked on a piece of shredded beetroot. Potter leaned over to rub her back and seemed to be whispering expressions of concern.

think, really. A whole weekend’s passed and Draco’s probably forgotten about it anyway. Probably wasn’t that memorable to begin with, just a couple of minutes, even if they’d been, well, really pretty memorable for Harry. But Draco isn’t Harry, as much as they might maybe have in common. Though Draco probably doesn’t think they do.
“Fair.” Draco hadn’t either. He’d eaten a day-old cookie from one of the doctoral students around five and quickly realised meals were not yet possible. “Drinks?”
Robards sat at the next table over, front row, with a direct line to the podium. He was clenching his jaw so tightly Draco thought it might pop. To his right, the Minister and Mrs Shacklebolt listened with polite attention. Next to them Millie and Blaise were, entirely by design, in Draco’s sightline, and when he looked from Robards’ flushing neck to Millie she gave him a quick wink. “Well done,” it said.
Potter (with Granger’s help. Is he even literate?) would turn his big announcement into a sanctimonious lecture on the importance of, of all things, love. He can’t even advertise for a fuck without giving a lecture on the importance of Hufflepuffian tenderness.
After, by Draco’s watch, ten minutes, the breeze picked up, and Harry’s breathing with it. The cat, looking quite disgruntled, hunkered into a corner of the settee, pulling her kittens in towards her. Draco tensed, preparing to intervene.
Without his friends’ company, the only thing left for Harry to do was patrol. Which wasn’t even technically what he’d been assigned to do, but who knew where witches and wizards might be casting ill-advised spells? And anyway, the alternative was standing alone with Malfoy, periodically staring at him and periodically trying not to.
But I remember him here, too. His skin in the moonlight, his fingers against my back, his laughter. His kiss.
stop thinking about it. The whole point of this house project was to try to do something productive with himself and this is definitely not productive. It’s confusing. That’s basically the opposite of productive.
“In that case,” Robards said, “Weasley, what can you come up with by way of a cover story for the hearings?”
The wool is thick and stiff. Harry has to slip his fingers under the buttonhole to pull the button free. He looks up. “Another?”
Draco recovered first, if only because he had years of pureblood training to fall back on. “Please, come in.”
,” taking care not to make it so bright as to wake Malfoy, and crept towards the kitchen, trailing his fingers over the posts at the foot of the bed, and then the doorway, and then the wallpaper lining the hall.
“Good, I’m glad about that. You should receive some this afternoon. This might be an odd request, but I’d ask you not to read it until we’ve had a chance to speak.”
Potter looked a bit shell-shocked, though not unhappy, per se. Draco squeezed his way around the mass of them, making for the tea and keeping his eyes trained on Potter.
Potter was halfway to rolling his eyes when he seemed to think better of it. “No. I— Before. What did it mean?”
“Good.” Draco reaches for his wand. Potter gasps as two black velvet runners wind around his wrists, pinning him to the crossbars. “Scared yet?”
She nodded at him, and leaned into Finch-Fletchley’s ear. “Have you seen, Rosabelle Ollivander is flirting
He leaned forward braced one arm at Harry’s side. “Pull your knees up? Might help to put them around me?”
twice, actually, and when he suggests that Miss Havisham had been wrong to want Pip and Estella apart, Draco’s startled in the best of ways, half-speechless and squinting at Harry to make sure he hasn’t been replaced by an imposter.
“I know that,” she slapped his arm playfully. “I meant the choice of partner. And the event, while we’re at it.”
“You would be very close to living as a squib. You might have to return to the Muggle world, at least in large part.”
Fuck. Of course it is. He’s always known it would be a circus if this kind of word got out. Draco attempts a deep, calming breath and tries to think over the sounds of Higsbee’s hand-wringing. He needs to find a way to deflect the attention. To put an end to all of this.
He wasn’t sure whether he’d succeeded. Malfoy had seemed to close up more and more with every passing minute. Harry reminded himself that even if Malfoy reverted to his reserved posh-arsehole self, the things he’d learned were still true. The things Malfoy was doing, had decided to do before Harry had ever crossed the threshold of
“So you do remember.” Draco ignores the roiling in his stomach. “That was my preference far more than wanking.”
He slips outside and slams the door behind him before he can see Draco’s reaction. He leans against the wall, breathing, just breathing, until he’s steady enough to walk away.
s on one of the bedside tables, while the other lies empty. There’s a broomstick leaning up against one of the windows, and the cuff of a dress shirt caught in the wardrobe doors. And it smells like Harry. Like his sweat, and his soap, and his skin.
“No.” Thoughts of what could have been hit Draco with the force of a Bludger. “You would’ve had the Wand out half a year by now, wouldn’t you?”
Draco turned to books, then, instead of thinking any more about it. They had the advantage of offering familiarity. The feeling of parchment against his fingertips, the sound of pages turning. The promise that if he kept looking he might find the perfect bit of information, the key to this puzzle. It had happened before. Books on illnesses, on wandlore, on the history of magic. And the Manor had volumes he hadn’t seen in ages, let alone thought to check. There would be an answer there. There had to be.
“No,” Draco shook his head furiously. He bent to press his mouth to Harry’s shoulder, to his clavicle, to his jaw, to his mouth. Harry’s tongue worked against his in concert with their hips.
“Right now?” Surely, he’s plenty of suitors. I’ve seen him at the clubs, seen how they fall all over him.
There was a long moment’s silence before the room exploded. Weasley with indignant yammering about public appearances, Robards in an impassioned defense of his Aurors’ abilities, Croaker in a tirade about Wand-related research agendas, and Shacklebolt in an attempt to bring them to order.
“I know,” he said. “He’ll let me know when he’s ready.” He turned back to her and, over her shoulder, saw Blaise and Millie rise from their table. “Meanwhile, more champagne before they bring out desert?”
“Just thinking. Preparing.” Draco clears his throat. “Speaking of which, you would do to remember that our agreement involves a certain amount of charm. You are meant to convince people that you like me, that you approve of my company and endeavours.”
Draco’s face went entirely blank. “I do.” And then, a hint of amusement; Harry couldn’t tell if it was forced. “As I recall, they were very well sourced.”
Dropping to his knees felt natural, obvious. Right. So Harry did, gripping Malfoy's hips and leaning in to mouth at the bulge in his underwear.
He thinks the two just about balance out. And as the Howlers begin to taper off, he’s more and more convinced that he’s getting the better end of the deal.
“I’m a bit tired, actually. I practised everything I’m meant to this morning and it was fine, but the conversation was a bit difficult and, well. Do you think we could wait until tomorrow? If you think it’s needed I’ll do what I can, of course, but—”
Draco had given Potter a bit of a wider berth than would usually be reserved for a single patient: a suite of rooms encompassing a sitting room, exam room, and private bedroom and en suite. He’d had the hallway outside included too. Better safe than sorry, and it gave visitors a chance to get their blanching and protestations over with outside of the patient’s view. And indeed, Millie looked less like a ghost and Granger less like she was about to give in to seasickness by the time they reached the door of the sitting room.
There was absolutely no way he was falling asleep, and absolutely no way he was going to make it through four and a half more hours of tossing and turning.
Draco smiled and waited, and was not expecting, once they had got it out of their system, Pansy to ask how his work was going.
He took in Draco’s furrowed brow, the tightness in his shoulders, the way his bottom lip was stretched between his teeth, and he grabbed Draco’s head and pulled him into a searing kiss.
Harry brings his hand back to the laces of his cloak, his eyes entirely focused on Draco. “For someone with an organisational system for everything, you keep an awful lot of
Those declarations seemed to have taken it out of Harry, who slumped down and fell into a mumble. Draco couldn’t hear anything else, and Granger was making such a point of remaining nonjudgmentally impassive that he couldn’t get anything from her, either. Except, as Harry went on, tears gathering in the corners of her eyes.
He slipped out of the office quietly, pulling the door shut behind him, and then stopped. It wasn’t like there were all that many places to go.
“So?” Potter snorts. “Go on then, Malfoy. Show the world the kind of operation you’re running.” His eyes flare. “It’s exactly what your father would’ve wanted.”
He might’ve fumbled it again, so I planned to kiss him properly this time. Get him weak in the knees. He’s implied that he rather lacks experience in this area; I didn’t think it would be difficult. We were standing a foot apart, I tilted my head and parted my lips and brushed them against his.
“Good timing, we were just finishing some paperwork.” She stepped over the threshold. “I hear you’ll be staying a while. If you’d ever like to join me and Gregory for dinner, please do.”
Harry was about to respond when he felt warm lips on his back, kissing a trail down his spine and to the small of his back. He arched into Draco’s mouth and whimpered when the tip of Draco’s tongue traced a path towards his arsehole.
Have to. I have to. They can never know. Losing this bet is losing everything. My home. My past, my future, every opportunity, the woman I’m actually meant for. The life I’m meant for. They can’t know about this turn of events. I’ll go, and drink. A few Firewhiskeys. Maybe I can get Blaise to give me head. Take the edge off.
“Okay.” Draco’s mouth answered before the rest of him had entirely caught up, but even in the few seconds’ silence that followed he didn’t find himself regretting it.
Harry is momentarily taken aback by the sudden transition to anger, but it’s better than the stoic alternative. Draco’s stubborn fire, his determination to have the upper hand – these things are familiar. These are things Harry can work with.
“And it was an announcement, you realise. You never asked me to come. You spoke as though you expected it sometimes, as though you imagined us there together. ‘Do you think we’ll want to explore the rest of the country as well?’ ‘Will the Rijksmuseum take us more than half a day?’ But you never asked. You never…” Malfoy trailed off and turned his head so that Harry could hardly hear him over the wind and the lapping of water against the reeds. “You never said you wanted me.”
They were kissing before they reached the first landing. Hell, it had been a struggle to make it through the front door. Draco didn’t even try for his keys; he grabbed the handle of his wand in its holster and cast an Alohamora through his shirt, and they practically fell through the doorway once he got it open.
But Harry was watching intently, without any hint of fear or trepidation. Draco renewed his grip, and Harry licked his lower lip, pulling it between his teeth and watching, still watching.
“Exactly.” Harry crossed the room and put a hand on Draco’s arm. “Draco, come on. “ When Draco didn’t turn, he continued. “Unless you’re not actually up for the challenge. In which case, I’ve brought you a present from the Muggle world.”
Have to go back. Stiff upper lip. The Malfoy way. This is what I was born for. I’ve got to do it. I haven’t got any options.
He glanced around—out of habit, he promised himself—and didn’t find anything that seemed to be amiss. No recording devices, no suspect items on the counters. He didn’t feel a single brush of magic anywhere in the room. That was exactly what Malfoy had promised the Ministry; it still surprised him.
a letter to Dean Thomas, offering him the kind of exposure Harry knew he’d been working towards for years? Were those really pamphlets for every sort of programming Harry could imagine and then some, available to wizards and Muggles alike, together, at the same time, free of any sort of cost?
“Yes, but you can keep running if you like.” Draco tilted his head, taking in the colour on Potter’s cheeks. The glazed sort of contentment that had taken him over was already starting to fade.
Malfoy’s smiled verged on mischievous. “You’ll be pleased to know I’m skipping the caviar. Though whether you’ll be able to fully appreciate the alternatives— Ah.”
“Thank you, Ms Bulstrode.” Shacklebolt forged ahead before anyone else could regain their equanimity. “As I was saying, we gain nothing from speaking over each other. Ms Granger, your objection is noted. Dr Malfoy, would you please explain your alternative proposal in full?”
went next, gripping Potter by the shoulders, holding him at arm’s length and then pulling him in. Then the girl Weasley, who was gentlest of all. Certainly when compared to the remaining twin, whose handshake exploded into a shower of spectral silver snakes, which were declared to be in honour of their host. The oldest one, with the earring, settled for a non-explosive handshake, but his wife seemed to be taking lessons from her mother-in-law, and punctuated a stranglehold of a hug with a kiss to each cheek.
? My father’s in France and, if Snape’s portrait is to be trusted at all, it turns out buggery is one of his preferred pastimes.”
I don’t shiver – really, I don’t – when he squeezes my hand, when he runs his knuckle down my bare chest. When he lies down, arse up, arms down, feet shoulders-width apart, head turned towards me, eyes closed.
“And nothing says ‘progressive’ like a blood-registration act sponsored by a Flint,” Draco drawled. From the corner of his eye Draco thought he saw a tiny smile on Granger’s face, and reminded himself that he was quite resolved to dislike her.
It’s not a proper pitch, though, and neither of them has quite enough time to recover. Draco barely has time to push the broom away before he tears through thick silk and collides with something that is, thankfully, not hard enough to injure. He hears another thud and hopes Harry’s managed to do the same.
Clearly, the only thing to do was call Hermione. Which meant Ron, too. And to call Luna, and since she was still at work that meant Dean as well. He wished, more often than not, that the public understood how much of his supposed heroism consisted of having the best friends a bloke could ask for.
Potter snorted, a bitter sort of half-laugh that caught Draco off-guard. “Considering all the worthwhile people who’ve died? You know what, Parkinson?” Everything about him seemed to slow down as he looked her dead in the eye. “Compared to them? Compared to—” He stopped himself, as if denying her even the honour of hearing their names, or maybe unwilling to finish the insult.
He tucked himself away efficiently, a different sort of thrill pooling in his stomach at the confusion that glanced over Potter’s face.
“Harry.” Draco stopped him, and almost wished he hadn’t. Harry’s name felt strange in his mouth. He knew he hadn’t always used it, but it wasn’t so different from his surname. Softer, though. Less abrupt. It stuck between his tongue and the roof of his mouth, didn’t want to be spat out the way “Potter” had. “Harry” wanted to turn the corners of his mouth up, like a smile. It wanted to live behind his teeth, stay inside of him. “Harry” didn’t want to be pushed out. Pushed away.
He startles when he hears the door scrape against the jamb. It could always be someone from the Wizengamot coming to check on him, or some ill-tempered member of the public who’d happily report a former Death Eater nodding off on the job. It’s enough to wake him up. He’s relieved and confused in equal measure when it’s Harry on the other side, running a hand through the sopping wet mess of his hair.
Draco dropped his hand and turned it in a circle to indicate the gallery and the Wizengamot’s benches. “Not everything?”
“I haven’t come because anything’s wrong. I’d like you to—” He takes a deep breath. “Would you have a drink with me?”
“Just the vase.” Potter gave Granger a quelling look. “Just trying to be thorough, that’s all. Ron and Seamus and I were out drinking and got it in our heads to drop in on Hermione, see if we could convince her to join us—her and Millie, they were going over some report or other—and I broke a vase. Not even sure it was magic and not a bit of drunken clumsiness.”
Draco was still until Harry’s tongue met his, and then his hands were on Harry’s back and in Harry’s hair, and Harry pulled him down until Draco’s weight covered him, his back arching towards Draco and away from the cold stone floor.
“Fine. I’m going to check on the kittens.” He turned toward the stables and opened the door. He didn’t hear Potter’s footsteps until he was past the second set of stalls.
"Highly irregular," Draco replies adopting his best bureaucratic demeanour. "You realise it breaks several important, possibly criminal, Ministry protocols to knowingly withhold Vanished items."
Draco laughed. “I sold £1.5 billion in securities this morning. One of the lads at Credit Suisse bet me a Goodman’s fillet and a bottle of Chateau Margaux that I couldn’t get a penny over 1.45, but the poor bastard’s in meetings all afternoon and can’t pay up until this evening.”
Which, fuck. He’s leaving lines in the rug. Draco will know he’s been pacing. Standing here like a terrible fool, walking back and forth and waiting. He draws his wand and tries to think of a spell to smooth carpet. Or maybe he could just lie down and roll over it? Make big lines, rather than pacing lines? But then he’d get lint all over himself, but there is a spell for that. Scourgify, in fact. Which is not his area of expertise, so much as it’s –
Harry pulled away and sank down again, impaling himself until Draco’s cock ring rested against his arse. “
Draco took stock of himself. Limbs, all there, if still a bit fuzzy. Chest warm and heavy, as though it wanted to pull the rest of him forward, towards Harry. Head champagne-light and running it over and over again: Harry talking about trust, and wanting, and Draco, all at once. The rest of his body… He wanted Harry just as much Harry had said he wanted Draco. “Right. So.”
“Well,” Potter began slowly, his eyes focused on Draco’s tie instead of his face. “The start of one, maybe.”
That’s not a possibility that had crossed Draco’s mind. Of course Potter would make it about himself. Draco’s on the verge of telling him off for it when he looks over and sees Potter wringing his hands, biting his bottom lip like he’s holding back words. When Draco doesn’t say anything, they come pouring out.
Draco’s not sure what exactly he expected to happen when he said the words. Fireworks? Champagne? Potter’s unequivocal, possibly tearful acceptance, followed by a night of passion?
Malfoy folds his hands over the stack of parchment and calmly looks Harry in the eye. “If you would like to access Ministry records I am equipped to supply you with form MM-OOBP-QXP-23: Request for Access to Ministry Records.”
Draco smiled his understanding and they turned back, Potter trailing half a step behind Draco again at first, though they were walking abreast by the time the stairs to the terraces came into focus.
This is massive. Colossal. The biggest pile he’s seen since the Cresswell’s youngest accidentally Vanished their entire cottage in a fit of wild magic. But that arrived altogether, one cottage, a bit jostled but easy enough to label and return. This, well. This.
“And you think that can’t exist alongside anger or sadness? I promise you, it can. Everyone has feelings like that, even for the people we love.” He snorted. “Especially for the people we love. You’re a reasonably powerful wizard who was put in an unreasonable situation and did extraordinary things. You are not superhuman.”
“No, no. It’s fine. Come with me.” Draco turns and leads him back towards the dais. He can feel Harry fidgeting behind him. “What is it you’ve misplaced, anyway?”
Potter shrugged, and his voice cracked as he tried to speak at something closer to a normal volume. “I don’t mind it. It’s a nice break from…” He trailed off. “Things, I suppose. From worrying about accidentally freezing people.”
Robards paused for just a moment, his own astonishment evident. “Well. That’s— That’s wonderful, Underassistant Malfoy. That’s excellent.”
Against the far wall, Mill and Blaise were wrapped up in an amorous embrace that was, in the context, unusual only for its heterosexuality.
He turns the covers down, leaves them pooled around his waist; Malfoy likes him like that. Available. Waiting for permission.
“And half the time when we asked if you wanted to do something, you had plans with him,” Hermione added. “And it seemed as though they were rather big plans. You were talking about going on holiday together, and about bringing him round to dinner, and helping him get a job at the Ministry. He was at the pub with you more often than not.”
He looks for the other arm, wonders if Potter’s habits have changed at all. Then realises his arm is concealed. By Jordan. Realises it’s not just a picture of Potter sucking cock; it’s a picture of Potter sucking someone else’s – Lee Jordan’s – cock.
“No, I mean, I did that, and I—I went to talk to him last night, and he said— And then I went to talk to him again this morning, or to listen to him, and he— What I meant is, I guess there are a lot of things I missed. Or, big things I missed, and then a lot of things because of it. And I might have—” Harry buried his face in his hands, unsure of whether he could even say it.
“Yours?” Draco’s heart hangs from his ribs. He’s asking for something more, now. Asking to go back to something that’s more than just Harry’s house.
Draco looked down between them and almost came on the spot, at the sight Harry’s hand around his prick, Harry’s hips moving against Draco’s.
Even as he’s shaking himself, wondering if he’s imagined it, if this is real, Potter is sliding into a string of mutterings that confirm the strange reality of it all.
He opened his eyes in his living room. It wasn’t even half eight and, for the difference in latitude, still dark. It all looked exactly how he’d left it, save a ten foot Nordman fir in the corner. He’d ordered it in late autumn and the elves must have set it up. He’d always reserved decorating it for himself and Mother, though, so it sat there, empty and unlit.
Harry hadn’t entirely been listening; that much was true. He’d been distracted by seeing the million Malfoys, by the realisation that he knew the real one. By the buzzing blur of yet another redemption speech, though…when he thought back through it…those speeches were always missing the same thing. There was never any humility or appreciation or love. Never any capacity for love, it seemed, in most of them. And never any action. Just lists of grievances and justifications and wretched, melodramatic pleas for total forgiveness.
Phillips makes a strangled sort of noise. Harry looks down. He’d thought Draco’s teasing was in jest all this time. At least, it had never been delivered quite so cuttingly. He does his best to still the twisting in his chest. Plasters on a smile. “What are we doing here, then?”
They walked down to the field in comfortable silence. It had become cold enough at night that the grass crunched underfoot. Draco listened to that instead of thinking too much. That was one thing about living in Paris; he hadn’t been able to feel the seasons change like this. He’d grown used to knowing if snow was in the forecast by listening to the wireless, not by the sound of the grass or the smell in the air.
They walked on. Draco led them down the Rue Royer-Collard, to the locked gates of the Jardins du Luxembourg. He inclined his head. “Want to go through?”
Malfoy didn’t exactly move, but it looked to Harry like his narrowed eyes were less in line with a scowl and more in line with a squint. “What?”
Soon, it’s almost three, and Potter’s things are in the hallway. It’s just Potter, then, alone and standing in front of him, hands in his pockets and a nervous expression.
“Really, Potter. You’re the saviour of the wizarding world. If your furniture reduces you to tears, surely you can replace it. There are witches and wizards all over Britain who’d turned their whole houses over if you asked. Move. Buy things. This is not that difficult.”
Pansy was struggling too. “Is it friendship, then, to come along a decade later and upend that with no warning? We have lives, you know, such as they are. Routines.”
He pressed his mouth into Potter’s, his shoulder into Potter’s, and slid his hand between them. Potter’s flies opened easily, and he arched when Draco slipped his fingers beneath the waistband of his pants, helping him along.
Harry turned and walked to centre of the circle and, with a last grin over his shoulders, dropped to all fours and spread his legs. “What next?”
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy takes a few crisp steps around the counter and crosses his arms not two feet away from Harry. “Those are the property of the Ministry of Magic.”
“I didn’t want to get rid of everything! Just the cursed stuff. And the broken stuff. And the ugly stuff.”
“You also have my sincere apologies for my lack of a timely response to your previous correspondence. It was…quite rude of me to leave your messages unanswered.”
She sighed. “You’re not going to Azkaban. Your mother isn’t going to Azkaban. Even if anyone could find your father he wouldn’t be going to Azkaban. No one is trying to send any of you to Azkaban, or put you on probation, or house arrest, or levy any more fines, or make you testify in any trials. None of you are in any legal trouble.”
But then, he realises, smiling against Potter’s mouth, he’s not being forced. He’ll take both. Have his cake and eat Potter, too.
going to break the Statute of Secrecy? To help Muggles? Let me guess, you also lead a double life as a Hippogriff.”
Malfoy was standing there, quite calmly, shin-deep in the water, with his wand pointed up at what Harry realised was the spoonbill.
She dropped Harry’s hand and stepped back sheepishly. “—is very commendable,” she finished. “Best of luck with it. And the frogs.”
He’s ravenous this morning. A second helping of eggs, a third glass of pumpkin juice. Though it makes sense, given yesterday’s activities.
“I appreciate your saying so. Thank you. I’ll let you know as soon as I’m able. Shall we practise, in the meantime?”
Her wording obscured so many things. Harry couldn’t tell if it was intentional, though he was certain that Ron and Susan and Seamus would’ve considered it a favour to keep the particulars out of the official record.
—eventually he’d meet Granger and Weasley for drinks; eventually they’d go out together in public; eventually they’d let their picture be taken together; eventually they’d meet at the pub after work instead of meeting at Harry’s after they’d gone out drinking with their separate groups of friends; eventually they’d go to the Burrow and have dinner with the Weasleys, the thought of which had filled Draco with so much dread than even an “eventually” was pushing it. No more worrying that Harry would come to his senses, that—no matter how many fantasies he described, no matter how many of his own eventuallys Harry promised—every night was the last night. No more hiding, because there was nothing left to hide. Nothing left worth hiding.
“You know, Parkinson,” Harry pipes up beside him, “if we’d known your aim was that good we probably would’ve tried to recruit you.”
He stops halfway through, his yell descending into nothingness, at the sight of a man’s silhouette sitting on the crest of the nearest hill. His skin’s so pale, his shirt so white, his hair so bright in the sun that Harry thinks he can be forgiven for mistaking his lover for a cloud.
If it took me some time to notice him that night it is only because I ascribed the jangling of my nerves to the task at hand. It was a Muggle site, white marble, ten feet high. I'd carved my stencils, prepared my potions, bundled them together in an old burlap sack and thrown it over one shoulder, as I had so many nights before. As I have so many nights since.
“You’re sorry you didn’t answer my letters. You’re sorry for the photographers, even though I’ve told you already that, as the only thing I’ve had to go on, I hate them a lot less than I probably should. You’re sorry for the blackmail. You’re sorry for, what was it? ‘Abruptly changing the course of our interactions’?” He pauses, expectant.
Harry balanced himself on one arm as Draco slowed to aid his stability. He lifted it out of the box and it glinted in the candlelight.
I wish I could say it’s his face I’ll always remember, the moment he crossed the wards and saw me sitting on his steps.
“Granger. Did you ever think you’d see the day when Potter would do everything I say with nary a comment?”
Harry shuddered. “Don’t exactly fancy doing that in front of Hermione. What if we tried again beforehand?
He grabbed his wand from the night stand drawer and his dressing gown from a chair, stuffing the former into the sleeve of the latter before crossing the room to crouch on the hearth.
It still, Draco noticed, wasn’t a no. Perhaps it would take a bit of Gryffindorish straightforwardness. “What’s mad about meeting mission criteria, maintaining plausible deniability, and getting your cock sucked in the process?”
“This isn’t a curse,” Draco insisted, brows knit in concern. “This isn’t going to do that kind of damage.”
It was so faint at first, Draco thought it was his own imagination, his mind turning over old conversations or dreaming up new ones. But then it came again, and a third time. His eyes blinked open with a start when he realised it was accompanied by heavy footsteps drawing ever nearer.
“All right, then. I’ve focused on things that are meant to be creative or lighthearted, but if any of them don’t appeal we can eliminate them from the list. Some of them are single spells, like Aguamenti or Vinomenti—”
“Yet here you are, champing at the bit to feel your knuckles hit my face, and you won’t do it—” he caught Potter’s eye “—you won’t touch me because you’re too afraid to admit that you want to.” Draco could see Potter’s breath catch, could feel the heat of Potter’s hand through his robes. “I hit you first and it’s all self-defense. We all go on pretending Saint Potter only ever wants what’s safest.”
He’s so warm, as I run a single finger down his cleft, glancing over his hole. He tenses again, but less vigorously, and he relaxes once it’s passed.
They repeated the ritual twice more, and Harry was beginning to wonder whether Malfoy was going to talk to him at all, or what Malfoy might do if he asked.
“There’s also the charity balls. At the holiday season. A number of them rely on him rather heavily for ticket sales. It’s important to him that he should be able to go.”
“I’m not,” she answered cautiously. “And you know, I think, that I share your opinion on the whole affair, but don’t you think gallows is a bit extreme? His life isn’t in any danger.”
He knocked before opening the door. Potter, in his usual seat, looked up as he came closer, his face set in a carefully blank mask. He didn’t put down his book. As Draco got closer it looked less like he was trying to obscure his emotions and more like he was frozen to the spot.
“Yes.” He walked past Potter and had to lean his weight against 12 feet of oak to push one of them open. “But not solely.” He rubbed his shoulder. “Those really do benefit from being opened by magic.”
Trick panel. He pressed one hand to the wall, feeling his way across, until he felt something click. When he pulled back, the panel popped out just enough for him to pry it open with his fingertips.
“You don’t want them?” Draco asked, already knowing the answer. “After all that trouble you went to? Seems an awful shame. Ah, well.” He shook his head and raised his arm again, “
Draco has no bloody clue why he’s decided it’s a good moment for a pause but Draco’s rapidly moving closer to rage than happiness. The dirty talk’s all well and good, but he wants to fucking come, and it’s not going to happen if Harry needs him to keeps stopping to name body parts and give directions. He’s meant to be the recipient of a blow job here, not a technical manual, and even if he’s paid a price for it afterwards, sometimes he’s damned grateful for every day he spent in Slytherin House.
Draco, trying to proceed with caution, spoke slowly. “You had nowhere to go after the trials. No money, no opportunities. I had a Manor house with a full staff that was about to sit unused for years on end, maybe forever. And you had, both of you, been friends. Pansy, I know we never meant to make anything of it, but you and I were supposed to be betrothed, even. And Greg, you were always there for me. Always. You were friends who risked your lives, or close enough, to try to end that bloody war one way or another.” Angry momentum began to build in Draco’s chest, and he struggled to stay calm in the face of it. “I don’t think wanting to ensure that you didn’t lose your lives or good health in the aftermath was pity. I’d have called it friendship at the time. Still would, even after a decade passed with nary a word from either of you, but perhaps that’s the French influence as well. All those emotions, you know.”
The tingle of Draco’s spell is far less pleasant than his touch, but much gentler than Harry’s own attempts at the charm. He looks up, surprised. “How do you –? That didn’t hurt.”
"Hmm." Harry traced his fingers around the outline of Malfoy's erection without touching.  "Fine then." He dug his fingers into Malfoy's hips and pulled. "Give me something else, then."
“Yes, sir. Potter hasn’t been seen in a nightclub since the photo was taken. Though, sir, we could confirm that with more certainty if you’d let us reassign a detail to covering him.”
Kate’s heels clicked once on the threshold before she stepped onto the rug, eight thick files in hand. “Your records, Mr Malfoy.”
Draco was stunned. He felt the press of Potter’s lips against his own. He felt pressure. He felt the damp warmth of Potter’s mouth. His brain stalled out completely, though, at the idea of a
him? That seemed more impossible than the kiss. Potter was an Auror. Surely he had the reflexes and the training, surely he didn’t need to worry about trust in that sort of intimacy.
“She is,” Mill insisted. “Wandlore is her speciality. She apprenticed with Ollivander, who tries to hire her away at least monthly. Plus she’s the Unspeakable most familiar with it. So of course she was on the team handling the Wand. And she noticed that it picked up… traces, if you will. It responded to Potter’s magical energy, even in minute amounts. It would behave differently before and after she had lunch with him, even, as though it could sense his magic on her robes, even just in tiny little—”
“Well.” Draco poked the dying embers. “I didn’t especially want him to stay the night, so the bedrooms were out. Brought him down here and he was sucking me off when who should appear?”
“Your choice, Minister. I will not clear him to leave the grounds, let alone testify, until we have considerably more information.”
Never mind that he’s almost as ugly as he was yesterday. More of a greyish pallor than that angry flush, but he looks downright sickly either way. It’s a wonder I was ever able to withstand it at close range. Perhaps he really has got dragon pox instead of love. If so, I might have some modicum of respect for his carryings on. Potentially fatal illnesses are at least an understandable source of distress. A juvenile fling gone wrong? Hardly. Though I strongly suspect it’s his mawkish sentimentality rather than any legitimate malady.
“Pardon?” Malfoy’s levitating each pair of boots to the middle of the aisle, making a neat row behind him.
. Merlin, he was full. Full to bursting. Malfoy moved inside of him with conviction, rolling his hips hard, setting off the deepest sparks of pleasure every time. Malfoy drove forward and Harry could give back, Malfoy liked it when he gave back—liked it when he pushed up, when he urged Malfoy deeper, when he met Malfoy thrust for thrust. When he spread his legs, when he hooked them over Malfoy’s shoulders; Malfoy’s guttural cry at that had run through Harry's spine, left his cock dripping.
“Pansy,” Blaise added, beseechingly. “Would you please? This is neither the time nor the place.” He tilted his head towards Granger and Potter.
Harry’s eyes widened at the sharp edge to Malfoy’s voice, but annoyance won out. “I told you, it’s not enough to shove something in there, and you can bet your arse I wouldn’t be here if that’s all it took.”
He kissed me. It was a searching kiss, with an edge of caution, as though he knew what he wanted and what I wanted but, I think, still hesitated over the possibility that I was injured. I reassured him that I was fine. He asked if I was sure. I was.
She gave him the sort of sympathetic look that only she or Mill, or Blaise or Greg on a very generous day, could get away with. “Right. That’s why you can barely sit still. I haven’t seen you wait this impatiently for anything since your Nimbus 2001.”
Ron’s Jack Russell came bounding through his and Padma’s shared wall a few minutes later, and he heard Padma throw something at it. Before he could get up to apologise, the terrier planted itself on his desk and fixed him with a searching look. It looked like it was about to bark, but Ron’s voice came through instead. “D’you mean when you cut him open? Or after the war when you… you know? Lemme know and I’ll think on it. Oh, and let me know about the Cannons tickets, too!”
And, on the other, means Draco is more firmly convinced than usual that he is surrounded by blind idiots.
Potter’s words came more easily as colour rose on his face. Some things never changed. “I don’t exactly have your number in my mobile.”
He bent, slipped both arms underneath the bird’s limp body, and lifted it, quite tenderly, into the space between him and McSullivan.
“I’ll be off, then.” She smiled, heading to his door. “It appears I have some research on Animagi to be doing. Bye Draco,” she kissed him on the cheek. “Bye James!” She cooed to the kitten, which meowed in response as she left the house.
"Harry, what's going on?" He asked as I let him into the room. I locked the door and he sat by me on the floor.
"But when I ask you for a drink I have to make it myself?" She raised an eyebrow. "Ten quid says you're in love with him."
”Excuse yourself and go to my bedroom. Once you’re there, strip to your thong. Don’t you dare touch yourself while you wait for me.” He growls the order into my ear and I nod, swallowing. I give a loud fake yawn and tell everyone I’m going for a nap, and that hopefully I’ll be awake before the two women leave. They give me a small wave and I hurry to Draco’s room, throwing all of my clothes off once the door is closed. I lie down on the bed in just my thong, resisting the urge to just rub myself to completion. But I follow Daddy’s order and lie still.
”Alright then.” A familiar voice calls. “Party city. Let’s get you sorted.” I look up to see Blondie in his uniform, looking smart, full of authority and hot as hell. Even seeing his face reminds me of last night, when he was pounding into me, making me shout in pleasure. I feel my crotch begin to throb and dampen and I press my legs together. Draco’s face registers shock, then anger, and then something that could be called lust, when he sees me, but he doesn’t let it detract from his job. One by one, each of the others in the cell are called out and sent home, how they’re processed I don’t know
We sat in silence for a few minutes, before Ron started up a lighter conversation. We chatted for a while, and I was thankful to have him in my life. Once he assured me I didn't look like I'd been crying, we left the bathroom and headed back downstairs.
James began kneading at the fabric of the bed, making Draco sit back down. Happy with this, James wandered over to his bedside table, standing on his pillow and batting the clock with his paw.
Once I’m out of the bathroom, towel around my waist, I sneak a peak downstairs to see who’s at the door. Seeing a familiar crop of bright blond hair alongside a short crop of dark brown hair, I frown and head back to my room to dress.
As I take hit after hit off of the blunt, I feel myself getting lighter and a smile dances across my face. I close my eyes, the image of Blondie stuck in my head. His authoritarian voice sent shivers down my spine and I let my hand drag down my stomach and into my boxers.
”Look, Draco and I are going on a date on Friday, and I wanted to do something special for him, but I don’t know what he’s into. I thought you might know?”
”Fuck, Harry.” He groans, riding through his climax. I can only moan as he continues to pound my sensitive hole until he stops shooting. He leans down to kiss me gently, before slipping out of me. “You’re so good, baby. You’re perfect. I’m so glad I met you.” He whispers. I slip my arms around his neck and press my lips to his in reply. I look deep into his eyes, which are filled with such fondness and kindness, before I press my forehead to him.
"You should be glad I don't just slam into you straight away. Or would you prefer that?" I shake my head quickly. He lets the rest of him slip in slowly - too slowly - and eventually he's fully seated inside of me, his hips against mine. The huge intrustion feels odd, and I worry that it's too big. But it's too late for that, and I try to get over the pain and discomfort quickly. I let him know I'm OK and he begins to pull back out of me, leaving just the tip inside. The emptiness feels weird, but I don't say anything as he pushes into me again, quicker this time but still fairly slow. I let out a slow groan as he fills me again, and as he begins to slowly fuck me I rock my hips against him. I soon realise that he's going too slow for my taste, and decide to let him know.
Draco was just finishing when a tapping at the window broke him out of his reverie. He looked up from the sink, seeing a small tawny owl outside the window carrying a letter. He opened the window, the owl immediately flying in and perching atop one of the cupboards, staring at James. James couldn’t be less interested in the owl.
Potter, who stood from his chair and set his book down as soon as Draco entered. One of the Kneazle kittens crawled up to sit on his shoulder when he rose. “Good morning.”
Potter shoved the other into his pocket and grabbed the half-eaten one. Potter looked down the row, and for some reason Draco couldn’t place. He faltered. “I think I’d like to walk.”
“Right.” Draco rounds the desk and sits next to Harry, not prepared to turn to look at him just yet. “Well.”
Shacklebolt was first to recover. “The charity events begin in earnest on the fifth of December. Is there any chance of finding a solution before then?”
“Just a black napkin? This,” he explains, taking a step forward, “is made of Duchesse satin. Valuable on its own, with particular use for those who entertain late at night.” He quirks his mouth at Potter. “They shimmer by candlelight. Creates quite an effect. Another lovely hand to the fabric, if you’d care to feel?”
Potter’s mouth moved slowly, seeming to roll the pulp over his tongue before he swallowed. He ventured another, larger bite. Draco watched his jaw work, watched the cautious pleasure on his face as he took a third, still larger bite. His eyelids fluttered closed, then open again. He dropped his hand. “It’s good.”
He worries it’s too much. He worries it’s not enough. He worries, once he spots it in on his window sill, that Potter’s tawny will bite his finger off and he’ll be forced to combine his new robes with some distinctly down-market bandages, which is as close as he’ll come to conceding that he’s terrified of what the owl is carrying.
Anger. Of all the possibilities, Harry had not been expecting that. “I – What? Did I do it wrong? Is there, um, some proper pureblood way I’m supposed to ask?”
“What about this one?” He directed Potter’s attention to the next one, which Gary had done about the same time.
He makes a few attempts at stammered apologies, all met with stunned silence. Every Gryffindor instinct in his body wants to stay and fight for this, to kiss Draco again, to tell all of them.
Harry’s flushed. His lips are full and open and not more than tongue's length from the head of Draco’s cock. He’s half-smiling up at Draco, but it’s more than a smile. It’s knowing and ravenous and it only disappears when he speaks. “Draco,” he repeats, making sure to lock eyes with Draco. “You know I know what you want, don’t you?”
“Goodness,” Pansy continues on, sprinkling sugar over her fruit, “you’re just full of apologies lately, aren’t you?”
He can see it all from here. Potter’s stomach contracting, his thighs trembling. The stripped, aching look on Potter’s face as he gasps for air, as he groans one last, “Oh, fuck,
But none of it was a problem for Draco, he reminds himself, and almost goes careening into the ground when his mind wanders to those memories; the long lines of Draco’s body moving seamlessly through the air, the warmth in his eyes as he watched Harry launch into his flip.
“Yes,” Draco breathed, coming a step closer. He reached out a hand and hooked his index finger around Harry’s. “But I have to—”
Two raps on the door cut off Pansy’s response. Draco sat up straight, and stared warily at the door.
“No,” Luna answered. “Harry suits you. The rehabilitation process will go on a week or two, with progressively longer periods of time in the air, then shorter supervised flights, then longer flights. Draco may try to convince Edgar to winter on the reserve here. There’s quite a lot to eat in the reed beds.
I find I’m conflicted about this next command. I love seeing him like this. His back and thighs all muscle, his arse rocking into me. The clear view of his hole, of course. But I want to see his face when I fuck him.
“If this theory is right, and if there’s any way to broach it without making a mess of the situation, whether or not his sexual preferences are implicated. Which is not an especially encouraging state of affairs.”
“There’s no need for that. Our elves are experts at home repair.” He looked at Potter carefully, finding his frustration replaced with a certain amount of concern for the depth of Potter’s apologetic deference. It felt wrong. Much more so than Potter’s magic, which at least continued to be as impetuous as Potter himself had once been.
“Potter, if you don’t hand it over right now, it won’t be, and you may well be responsible for the extinction of a magical species.”
“Pansy,” Draco said, relaxing back into the settee, “I don’t mean to be indelicate, but if you’re making the sort of money Daisy Green must be making, and this change in living arrangements is so untenable, surely there are other options available to you.”
He tried to catch Potter’s eye, but Potter avoided him. He never looked away from Draco, but always just slightly to the side of his eyes, or he fell short of meeting Draco’s gaze in favour of finding a focal point in the middle distance.
“Of course that’s all you’d be able to imagine.” Draco knew he should de-escalate; he could see Potter’s fist relaxing and tightening, relaxing and tightening. It just felt so fucking good to let something out, anything at all.
“Tell me about it.” Harry laughed. “It’s possible that I’m excited for a break, in addition to needing one.”
“Oh, fuck.” Potter’s face had fallen as he spoke. He lifted the kitten off his jumper and set it on the chair he’d abandoned. “Fuck. Fuck. No, Malfoy. Oh, fuck. They’re never going to let it go now.”
Harry turned towards him. “Apparently it’s meant to be good for me to be as honest and direct as possible. Avoid all that bottling up.”
He’s in the office by 8, with a memo to F and L to send him the complete guest list for the HHS event, another to the photo team directing them to leave Potter alone until further notice, and a third on Higsbee’s desk with orders to see him immediately.
Harry’s lips curved into a smile around his prick and Harry started moving faster again. Draco’s balls felt so tight, and he could feel his orgasm gathering. He ran a hand through Harry’s hair again. “Stop,” he managed, barely. “Gonna come, stop.”
And there it was, the hint of pleading he’d been waiting for. Draco pressed his front into Potter’s back, the buttons of his waistcoat surely pressing into Potter’s skin. “Leave it?”
He goes to work early for the sole purpose of slinking in to his office before anyone arrives. He can’t stop replaying the moment in his own head, and he sure as hell doesn’t need to hear about it from anyone else.
Harry squeezed his hand again and dropped it, and his mask fell back into place. He nodded to Weasley, who drew his wand to open the door.
Draco paused. “Yes, and make sure he gets the full treatment on arrival. Imagine he’s got ten million pounds to invest, or the hottest tip since mortgage bundling. Whatever does it for you.”
“Erm?” Harry answered. “I’ve been mostly indoors, so, it’s really down to whatever Magical Maintenance decides.”
He’d never wanted to admit that Potter’s opinion meant more to him than a random stranger’s might. He’d never wanted to admit that less than he did with Potter’s orgasm still tacky between his fingers.
He took off at a sprint along the boardwalk, then through one side of the wards and out the other. He pulled up short when he got to the reed beds.
Wet fabric hits his dais, and he’s startled enough to forget not to look. He snaps his eyes open, fully prepared to be furious with Harry for disrupting the order of things, leaving wet rags all over his workspace.
Harry shook his head again. “Just tired.” He took a few deep breaths, regaining his composure. “I’ll be okay.”
This is one of those “definitely robeless” tasks and Draco still always ends up sweating through his shirtsleeves. It’s warm, heavy work, and frankly disgusting. He still hasn’t got over periodic revulsion that comes with handling those putrefying items that really should have been Banished but that he’s required to hold for a time, should someone come looking for three tomatoes or a wilting bouquet.
The incredible heat of Harry’s body made it feel to Draco as though he was immersed in every sensation, every touch or brush of lips. The rest of the room, with its cold winter air, was the ocean to their island. To step back—to step off—would’ve been like jumping into icy water, would’ve been suffocating and chilling, and nothing Draco wanted to do.
I was, and urged him onwards. His pace was agonizingly, deliciously slow. I don’t think he believed I was alright until he was fully seated.
“And clearly, between the joint Muggle-magical degree and the out-and-proud top-of-the-gossip-columns gay fucking, I’m of the opinion that upholding pureblood tradition is the way forward.”
Nothing against Robards himself. It’s the news that Harry will have to do another round of Draco’s trials that sets him on edge. Seeing Draco—
Harry leans down and nips at the skin just above Draco’s belt. “Would you rather I suck something else?”
Draco kissed back fiercely and Harry pulled him back into the circle. He broke away when Harry began to tug him down. “What are you doing?”
“I’m glad,” Harry said, tilting his head back against the sofa and looking at the ceiling thoughtfully. “And I suppose the thing is, really, that I might’ve been surprised at this point if it actually was strange. Because you don’t lie to me, or treat me like I’m going to break, or keep me on a pedestal. That hasn’t been easy to find and, like I said, I don’t think it’ll be any easier to find now.”
He opened his eyes again to find himself face to face with the box containing Slytherin’s plans, its serpentine carvings entirely dormant.
“Look,” he tried. “The worst case scenario is that we’re locked in. We can send a Patronus for help and someone can come get us.”
“I’m going to solve this. I will not let some incompetents destroy his magic so that they can use him for some short-term political gain.”
Harry paused. “Yes,” he said. “In addition to some other, um. Personal interactions.” He thought of Malfoy and his snails, of Malfoy and his quick wit, of Malfoy’s sly smiles, of the way Malfoy’d made him admit to what he wanted, of the ways they’d touched each other. Of the ways Malfoy’d made him come, and how much he’d liked it, and how much he’d liked returning the favour.
Draco looked down to his mug for a moment, trying to work out if it would be worth trying to muggle-ify his story.
“Hey Jamesie,” Draco smiled, crouching down to scratch the kitten behind its ears. James purred heavily in response, but stopped immediately when he saw Millie.
Suddenly, something catches the corner of my eye and in my rear view mirror I see blue flashing lights.
“I learned what happens when Draco gets jealous.” I shrugged, heading over to sit on one of the sofas.
"I can't really say. Made some promises and I'm not willing to break them given the person I promised." Why was Blaise acting so weird? He was completely off today. In fact, he'd been a bit out of it when we'd hung out the other day. I knew he wasn't going to tell, being such a good secret keeper as I'd come to know over the many years we'd been friends. Instead, I headed to the desk and spoke to the receptionist, Blaise staying where he was, almost out of fear.
"I'm awake, I'm awake," he laughed as the kitten pawed at his arm. It certainly wasn't the worst way to be greeted in the morning.
"You look like you feel guilty, so if you're an animagus you're doing an awful job," Draco chuckled, picking up the clock and reparo-ing it without a second thought.
"Just be glad I've been so kind as to let you keep your dick," I said, spitting on him a final time before turning to leave.
“That’s the name he has when he arrived at the adoption shelter,” Granger lied easily. But Draco wasn’t born yesterday.
The cat mewed at him loudly, its bright green eyes taking in him as he did, it. Draco smiled a little when it moved forward towards him, obviously feeling safer, but he noticed the small limp it had as it walked.
Even once the two were in bed that night - not like that, Draco thought hurriedly. It's simply because Merlin knows what the people would do if their 'saviour' had to sleep on the couch - Harry waited for a few minutes before softly asking the question again.
”Sorry. Your boyfriend’s still at work.” I let out a sigh and he gives me a once over. “Let me guess, your clothes were washed but you need to get back home ASAP?” I nod, and he holds the door open.
"They're all druggies or drug dealers, only out for themselves. Oh, you expect me to believe that you're actually in a
Luckily, the walk back to my room has us in towels, save for when Draco snatches mine away from me and darts into my room, leaving me buck ass naked in the hallway. I slam my fist down on the closed door loudly, shouting his name, when Seamus appears out of Thomas' room. I cover myself with a hand while the other continues to knock on my own door.
"Like that baby? Yeah? You like it when I slam into your tight ass, huh? You like being filled with my cock?"
“I can have Luna arrange a meeting if you like.” Granger smiles. I nod in thanks, before heading upstairs, where I spot Thomas’ door wide open, and Thomas lying on the bed.
"Harry, if they're coming back, maybe you should go see someone." She suggested earnestly. "I know you didn't want to back then, but perhaps there's a reason they're coming back? Has something happened? You disappeared yesterday, and when we heard sirens we got anxious. Luna and Ginny went out looking for you around the block, but they couldn't see you anywhere."
“Trying to get home quickly. Friends get worried and I can’t have them prowling the streets for me late at night again. You lot have had ‘em in for it.” Blondie looks in thought for a second and then speaks.
Over the next few days, with some intense medicine and unwavering comfort from my boyfriend, I slowly got better. Draco, by some miracle, had stayed fit as a fiddle, although he claimed that it wasn't because he'd raised a kid and had had every cold out there, and even some that hadn't been invented yet.
"Fuck you!" I spat. "Draco does love me! More than anyone will ever love you!" I shouted. Attention would attract people, and they would help me. He slammed his spare hand against my mouth.
“What you said earlier, about why my father liked Sirius so much...” I nodded in understanding. “What did you mean by that?” He cocks his head slightly.
“See you later.” Longbottom replies. Zabini lifts an eyebrow. “Sir.” He adds. Zabini leaves the house and Longbottom turns, jumping a bit when he sees Draco and I. “Oh, hi guys.” He blushes.
There was a quick, sharp, excited knock at the door. As Draco turned to go and answer it, he was able to appreciate the woosh of the cloak billowing out in his leave.
"Ok, Tyler. We're going to bring you to the station, if that's okay? We'll ask you about everything, if you feel comfortable telling us. We'll then ask you to be taken in for testing."
Returning to my room, the horrible sound of an alarm blasted at my unsuspecting and painful ears, making me recoil with a yelp.
”You missed me?” I nod. “Show me how much you’ve missed me.” He orders confidently. I tilt my head in confusion. He unzips his flies but nothing else. “I said, show me how much you’ve missed me.” I look down at my feet, embarrassed, but move quickly to kneel between his legs. “Good boy.” He praises. A shiver runs down my back. I slowly pull his trousers down, Draco lifting his hips in cooperation before I face his tenting boxers. Slowly, I reach out, pulling them down.
Once the two were done eating, Draco let it roam the house as he showered and threw on some more comfortable clothes. After fixing himself a cup of tea and refilling the water bowl for the cat, he settled in on his sofa, flicking on the TV.
"Because every time someone touches me where... where he did, I get scared. I want to run and hide. All my mind can think of is him and it makes me want to throw up. At the Weasleys' yesterday, Charlie put his hand in my leg for a second and I ran. I locked myself in the bathroom. I can't even be around my friends anymore. I don't know how I'm supposed to be with you if I get scared when people touch me."
”See like, plugs and stuff I reckon he would rather do himself. Perhaps lingerie? I understand if you don’t want to, Neville told me about the whole trans thing. But I don’t know, maybe a pair of panties’ll get him going. Gets me going for sure, isn’t that right, doll?” He turns to Neville, who’s blushing a bright red. I throw a thanks their way before heading up to bed.
"It's a bit late to run to her aid now, isn't it?" He managed to speak against the pressure on his throat. "The way she was begging me to let her go, claiming that you loved her. But where were you? When I was taking her in the alley?"
Because Draco had been the first to say I love you, the first to propose, the first to everything. Every holiday celebration, Draco got there first. And if Harry was being honest with himself - which was a rare feat - Draco had been the first to his heart.
She was silent for a moment. “I have an idea as to he is. Officer Malfoy?” I nodded. “And your name isn’t Tyler, is it?” I shook my head. “It’s ok, I understand completely. And as to that question you want to ask, no, I won’t tell him. Detectives and uniforms rarely interact. But this is a case, and it’s confidential.” I breathed a sigh of relief.
As the number of customers dwindled and the time until closing slowly went by, Draco cleaned up the coffee shop section by section, trying his best to ignore how Harry watched him work.
”What’s wrong, baby boy?” He asks quietly so the others won’t hear. I lean up on my tip toes to whisper to him.
“Pans, what’s going on?” Draco followed her quickly, not wanting her to cause damage to anything under his roof.
"I want to know what the hell is going on." She rolled her eyes. "My boyfriend runs away and no one can find hide nor hair of him. Suddenly Ron says you're living with bloody Malfoy as a cat! Why? Why'd you leave?"
”What?” I ask quietly, acting innocent, when he doesn’t speak immediately. He just shakes his head and sighs angrily. “You’re mad? I run a gang. Of course I’m going to do illegal shit. Thought you knew that?” He grabs my wrists and pins them above my head, trapping me between him and the wall.
“Not to sound like a horny teen,” he begins. I roll my eyes with a smile. “But I need a fuck, man. But no one out there seems to want to go out with a gang member. I thought chicks loved the bad boy act?” I don’t know any chicks, but I think I know someone who he could get to know.
