“Professor Lockhart was left behind, while they did all the actual fighting, as far as I can tell, held under a surprisingly strong Confundus Charm, cast by Mr Malfoy. He says it was an act of self-defense, but we are unsure, Gilderoy doesn’t seem like the type to attack students.” Dumbledore had his hands clasped in front of him in a pensive gesture, elbows resting on the desk.
Lockhart stared around at the Professors desperately. “I… I really never… You may have misunderstood… “
“Professor Dumbledore would like to see you in his office.” he snapped. “Be quick.” With that, he exited in a flurry of black robes.
“How’s Moony? Did the last transformation go okay?” Harry craned his neck to survey his godfather’s face.
“I think Draco needs a place to practise his powers, and Harry too for that matter. We can’t have them holed up in the castle day-in, day-out, they’ll end up hurting someone.”
...I think I got lost in it somewhere.
Sirius grimaced. “How do you guys know about him?” Draco and Harry both opened up their mouths to give an excuse but Sirius held up his hand to pause them. “D’you know what? I don’t want to know.”
“That’s him.” said Sirius in awe.
“Yeah. Christmas, Quidditch, my seventh birthday…” he didn’t mention that he had also tried thinking about what he saw in the Mirror of Erised, despite it’s fucked up origins. It was awful, and he wouldn’t repeat it, but he also wouldn’t deny that it was worth the try.
Tell you what, I had a lot of fun with this one.
“Why is there a house elf in here?” Sirius exclaimed, running forward to pick it up and hoist it into his arms. “Who are you?”
“Your Nargles have definitely lessened, Draco.” said Luna.
“Woah. I can’t believe that Dumbledore would give me this.”
“No way.”
“Okay. Do you want me to go back to my bed?” Draco was already half asleep, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“Where’s my wand?” Harry whispered as he patted down his pockets, but Draco looked up to see it being twirled with Riddle’s long, slender fingers. “Shit.”
Remus grimaced. “Yeah and it’s a bit of an issue…”
“Thank you, Remus.”
Get ready for some Lupin-Black family cuteness! They are so fun to write about, I just couldn't get enough haha.
By now, Draco had run down from the stands and brushed his hand against Harry’s sleeve, grabbing his attention. “Are you okay? What happened?”
Arthur was probably Harry’s favourite, though. He was absolutely fascinated by muggle objects, and spent ages getting Harry to explain things to him in the most adorable way. Harry actually really liked it, it made him feel smart and he loved seeing the look of utter wonder in the man’s face when he saw a paperclip or a clicky pen in action.

“I’m fine.” Harry gritted out.

“And Pads and Moony…”
“Tell me everything about werewolves.”
McGonagall closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She looked at Harry. “Would you care to give me a better explanation than this? Perhaps with a tad more detail.”
“You know you don’t have to, Draco, you don’t owe him anything.” said Remus, turning to his son.
“No. I am not my parents, any more than you are yours. Thank you for showing me that.”
“Seriously, Harry. Ginny’s our sister, you saved her life.” There was silence for a moment, Harry took the opportunity to nod at the acknowledgement. “Anyway, we know it off by heart.” Fred continued, shaking off the solemn air.. “We bequeath it to you. We don’t really need it anymore.”
“That’s fine. One of us will just take the other one to go back.” The dark haired boy stilled for a moment, a cloud crossing over his features.

“A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.” Okay, this seemed really shady.
He and Draco slept in the same bed that night, wanting to keep the other close. It had become a habit of theirs to resort to this whenever something big had happened. Harry didn’t have much in the way of family, Draco was the closest he had, and he liked the comfort of having him near.
“No, it can’t be. It’s too early.” he ushered the man into the next room.
“I actually do, hold on.” With that, he conveniently pulled out a stack of shiny cards and spilled them on the library table. He plucked out the Dumbledore card with practised ease and presented it to Draco, who, in turn, read from it aloud.
Harry and Pansy have a discussion about sexuality and homophobia in the pureblooded wizard community in this chapter just so you know :)
At first, all it seemed to be was an image of him, Harry, Sirius and Remus, all older, smiling and laughing good contentedly, exactly as he’d seen in the Mirror all those years ago, but he knew what came next. Dread burning a hole in the pit of his stomach, Draco couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, neither could anyone else it seemed, they all just watched as boggart-Draco’s happy grin morphed into a sickly grimace, and it’s right hand raised slightly. Draco could just see the small flurry of something white that circled the boggart’s hand before it sent shards of a glass-like substance, that looked strangely like ice, into the hearts, eyes, skin of his family. Around boggart-Draco, there now lay three bodies, choking on their own blood, convulsing grossly. This was where Remus stepped in.
“I know you did, you daft bugger. And you broke you arm while doing it.” He tenderly kissed the palm of his hand and Harry felt instantly better, but their lovely moment was interrupted by another familiar voice shoving aside students to get to Harry.
Harry nodded eagerly. “It’s our favourite magazine.”
“Really?”
Harry smiled excitedly and raised his wand to quickly disarm his Professor, before looking over at Draco who was casting some spell Harry didn’t know.
“Yes, he does.” she nodded gravely. “Draco has been made aware of all of his father’s crimes, I just think that he prefers not to mention that one.” Harry understood. He could still remember their conversation about their parents, the one that happened on the very first night at Hogwarts. He remembered Draco saying that everyone expected him to grow up just like his parents, did everyone expect Draco to be some murderer? Harry could see why Draco wouldn’t exactly broadcast that information, especially not to a boy he had only met that night.
“Perhaps at what you did to make Professor Moody so angry?”
They took their stances in the middle of the platform, wands against their faces, staring deep into the other’s eyes. Harry had always known that Draco had beautiful eyes, but had never quite realised how terrifying they could be when they were angry. He noticed the other boy’s lips curl into a snarl.
“Lucius was never able to cast a full Patronus. But, Narcissa did. I have heard from the Healers at St. Mungos that she casts it every now and again because it calms her. It is a dove.” Remus occasionally pondered upon Lucius Malfoy’s failure to cast a corporeal Patronus. He got married, he had a son, exactly what he wanted for the family. Surely those memories would be joyus enough to cast one. He had come to the conclusion, eventually, that they just weren’t. Perhaps those memories were tainted, perhaps by Voldemort’s lurking figure. It surely wasn’t the case of lack of magic, for Lucius was known to have had plenty. What an awful life, Remus would think, to never have been happy enough. Happiness, he had always imagined, could not be measured, but perhaps it could.
Harry didn’t quite know what to think. He always thought of Snape as a bit of a bully, really. With his constant picking on Neville, calling Harry a ‘celebrity’, grading Hermione’s potions poorly. His father stopped bullying, but Snape didn’t.
“Come on, mate, the only thing creepier than basically stalking a girl and asking her out every day, even though she repeatedly has said no, is to then get a tattoo in her honor.”
“I didn’t have anything to live for before I met you so I never cared about death.”
Dammit, she thought, they were so close.
“WHO IS THAT?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ooh, dad! Open yours from me!” Moony reached into his pile until he found one that had his name penned in Draco’s handwriting. It was a thick blanket with a sea of stitched stars and moons on the side. The moment Draco saw it, he knew that his father would love it. He always said that he and Sirius were the stars to his moon.
“We have Defense with him on Wednesday.”
PS. I would greatly recommend that you read the Brothers Grimm fairytales for fun, Draco will be reading them and making pretentious references to them a bit from now on, he's dramatic like that. Like me, really. (You can get them for free on Wattpad.) They can get a little dark though, so be warned. Draco will probably remark on that later. I reckon Muggle literature should be his new obsession.
During the feast, Draco and Hagrid seemed to be actually talking civilly. Draco seemed to be getting on with everyone, actually, which was extremely odd. Only a few months ago, nobody in the Weasley clan, or Hagrid, would be seen standing within a five foot radius of the boy, as though he were something explosive, but the whole situation with Lucius seemed to put everything in perspective. They seemed to realise that what he was going through was probably very traumatic, and that he would need friends more than anything. It made Harry unendingly happy that people were finally getting to know Draco, he was truly something special.
“Please, they did way worse stuff when they were at school. And Dumbledore won’t care, we’ll just tell them why we originally did it. He’ll be sympathetic and won’t tell on us to Filch. Now please, Harry, can we go to bed?” Harry felt better now that he knew adults would be getting involved, and not in a bad way. But it still didn’t help the irking in his chest that told him to go back and see what it really was. Although, he reminded himself, he wouldn’t get anywhere without Draco.
“Well, yes!” Harry cried, with a look on his face that shouted, aren’t you?
“I am the only one here who can speak Parseltoungue, I bet that would be a useful trait to have if you’re defeating Slytherin’s monster.”
Harry was breathless with joy. His Patronus was a stag, just like his dad’s.
When Harry spoke, is was small and shaky.
“Alright, go ahead. But just the stockings, mind you, we’re doing the real presents later.” Remus chided, as he went to go make some hot chocolate. The stockings themselves contained sweets of all shapes and sizes, and small trinkets like Exploding Snap Cards or a toy from Zonko’s. When Moony had passed around a hot chocolate for everyone, Harry and Draco began to calm down, but their faces, Harry’s in particular, were the pictures of ecstasy. The day continued at a lazy pace, Remus began working on dinner while Sirius played in the snow with the boys. Harry seemed unusually sensitive to the cold and found himself in the kitchen, helping Moony, but Sirius and Draco continued playing for longer, throwing snowballs in each other’s faces and making snow angels. At one point, Sirius even transformed into Padfoot and chased Draco around the garden in circles. While they were lying on their backs, after making said snow angels, Sirius grinned lazily.
“Yeah, I will be having stern words with Dumby after this.”
What was that for?”
“And you know how to work it?” Harry raised his eyebrows incredulously.
“Oh…” said Draco softly, heart still pounding like a runaway train. “Must’ve been the dream then.”
After a little while of Harry explaining to Draco the mechanics of a camera, they took a photo. There was no way of seeing it, however, because they needed to develop it, something that Draco very much looked forward to learning about.
Draco was panting, hard. It had felt so real, it was, wasn’t it?
“Look, I understand ‘young love’ and everything, you know me and Moony started when we were in school. I just don’t want you to get your heart broken.”
Draco lowered his voice. “I’m angry at being constantly accused of being a Death Eater.”
Remus and Sirius left him with a quick ruffle of the hair and, just like that, he was alone. Waiting for a mass murderer in a deserted hallway.
“Huh.” He was beyond words.
“Heh, no we do celebrate Christmas, at least the Dursleys do but, I was never given any presents.”
Each boy tried about three more times before complaining of weariness, so Remus let them go. By the end of the class, they had both produced bright enough Patronuses to scare off a dementor or two, and they were only thirteen! He didn’t dare think what they’d be capable of in a few years time.
“Maybe he’s worried you’ll kill him, Draco.” suggested Blaise, which earned him a kick in the side. “
“It’s always about blood in the end.” She choked out, under her breath.
Draco could see Harry nodding in the sidecar. Neither of them said anything else until they landed on Hogwarts grounds, on which they were greeted with a group of Professors with thunderous expressions on their faces, and Draco’s parents, equally, if not more, furious. The boys shared a nervous look and took each other’s hands for support.
Sirius closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, absorbing the warm feeling of family that surrounded them. Everything was going to be okay. Lucius
“Okay.” They could hear footsteps growing fainter, and waited until they were completely gone until they started to talk.
. Harry felt an unreasonable amount of rage towards that man. Not only because he seemed to treat Harry as though he were some celebrity, desperate for attention like he was, but also because Draco seemed infatuated by him. He was an idiot, anyone with brains could see that, even Draco, but after twenty minutes of listening to the other boy gush about the man’s smile, Harry realised that it wasn’t so much about his personality or ‘achievements’ (Achievements that he doubted the authenticity of.), more to do with his looks. Still, Draco was obsessed. He stayed up, late at night, rereading
“You’ll be okay, Harry, they’re gone now. Forever. You have seen the last of them.” There were not enough words to describe how happy Harry was. There would come a day where Harry was willing to talk about everything the Dursleys did to him, but at that moment, Harry wanted nothing more than to just pretend that he had been a part of Draco’s family since the beginning. Sirius pulled away and gave him a quick once over before shrinking his trunk and putting it in the tiny storage compartment on his bike. Harry sat himself comfortably in the sidecar with Hedwig slotted between his knees and Sirius revved the engine and took off from the ground. The last memory that Harry would ever have of the Dursleys was one that he would treasure forever: their horrified faces when Sirius spelled out the words ‘Fuck you’ in the sky with his wand and sailed him away on his flying motorbike.
“What happened in the dream?” Draco could feel the vibrations in his friend’s throat as he spoke.
“One.”
“I’m not angry with Blaise, I’m angry with this whole stinking business!”
“Professor?” he panted slightly. “What’s the matter?”
“Professor Snape.” he had said, blushing crimson. Draco felt sorry for him. Out of everything he had faced, his parents being tortured by Draco’s biological aunt and Sirius’s cousin to insanity, Voldemort being in his school twice, his biggest fear in the entire world was a man he had to see every single day of his school life. Remus and Draco shared a look as the rest of the class laughed. Poor Neville.
Harry clung on for dear life but peeked open his eyes slightly to check his surroundings. When he did, he was shocked to find that it wasn’t that scary at all. They were flying over the black lake and Harry could see his reflection in the ripples. It was shocking to see himself so carefree and relaxed. It was as though all the stress from the last few weeks had been banished, being replaced instead by a feeling of freedom unlike any other. He grinned up at the sky and laughed heartily, spreading his arms out in order to feel the full effects of the wind.
The Weasleys went on holiday to Egypt because they won the wizard lottery, which was very exciting, but came but just in time for Harry’s birthday party, which was being held at Hogwarts.
“Oh lay off, Moons, if we miss the train we can take the motorcycle.”
“See, Severus?” Dumbledore asked, with a gesture towards the boys. “You two may go back to your dorms now.” Harry could sense that the conversation between the two men was far from over, but was honestly too tired to care.
I hope you enjoy, I'm really proud of this one specifically for some reason xx
“Turn it off. Now.” Pansy, who was closest to the fire, followed Draco’s orders and doused it. The seconds she did, the blond relaxed in his seat and continued playing as though nothing had happened. The rest of the night was spent in a tense atmosphere as everyone tried not to provoke Draco again. Harry asked him if he was okay but he didn’t seem to remember it happening at all.
“Thank you, Mr Lupin. I am afraid I am here to ask a favour.” The two young men shared a look. It was very much like Dumbledore to randomly ask you to do something ridiculous, and from the looks of the boy sleeping contentedly in Remus’s arms, this favour wasn’t going to be as trivial as marking some Hogwarts exam papers.
“We could use the invisibility cloak?” Remus suggested.
. But without these two men, he wouldn’t feel as though he would have anything to live for. “Alright, children, lets go. Are you alright to apparate, Draco?”
“Oh my goodness, no. Stop! You are so annoying! I get it, you have a hero complex, I remember, but you also promised me that you would be safe! Fighting a monster is not safe, Harry!” His voice was rising to inappropriate levels.
Everyone carried on talking for a long time, there was a lot to process. But it finally ended when Harry and Draco’s stomachs started rumbling and the time for the feast had arrived. They said their goodbyes and made their way to the door, but it slammed open before they could reach it, revealing two stocky wizards, who greatly resembled Crabbe and Goyle, and a tiny elf.
They chattered amiably about sweets for hours, unaware of the time that was passing. They each tried a Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Bean, with Draco getting tar and Harry getting ‘old shoe’.
“What?” The Crabbe look-alike snapped.
When he finally made it to the end, Minnie kissed him on both cheeks and placed him in his spot to await Remus, who glided into the room only seconds after.
Draco grinned at Harry. “I would love some, thank you.”
The professor straightened up and moved to the front of the class, where he inspected his book for a few seconds before slamming it shut suddenly and peering at his class.
Lockhart sweating now, uncomfortable at the onslaught. “I - well, I -”
School is starting for me soon so I'll be posting a lot of chapters later in the day, still going to keep up with it though - I hope!
Hope and Lyall leaned over to him next, and whispered something similar. To which he, of course, said “He needs no taking care of, Mr and Mrs Lupin, but I’ll do my best.” They smiled at him gratefully and withdrew to their respective seats. As did McGonagall, who squeezed his arm before departed.
“So, how are you?” Harry asked when they got settled.
“We have an early Christmas present for you, Harry.” He said.
“How can you be so nonchalant about this? Somebody went to the papers!”
Lucius growled. “I want my son to tell me the truth.”
Harry shifted uncomfortably, and a dark cloud fell over his features. “You can’t stop me, I’ll do it anyway.”
“Okay, Pads.” Harry glowed.
“Thanks, son. I’ll get on with explaining shall I?” Draco nodded and Moony steeled himself before forging on. “There has been a lot of rumour and speculation surrounding your adoption into our family, especially seeing as your father and I don’t seem like respectable candidates. I am sure you saw in the article that I am referred to as a ‘Werewolf’?” Draco nodded again, listening raptly. “Well, I wanted to tell you this when you were a little older but, I suppose now is as good a time as any, that is true.” The young boy gasped. A werewolf? But weren’t they meant to be savages? They killed people. Draco knew, he had read it once in an article. But then something clicked - Moony always went away for the weekend, once a month. Pads had always told Draco that it was for work, but maybe that wasn’t it? “Now, I am sure, like the smart kid you are, you’re putting two and two together. I’ll tell you everything. Today. Seeing as you are excused from lessons.”
“Jeez, it’s hot in here.” said Draco, stretching languorously on the sofa.
“Where do you want me to start?”
“I understand that Draco and Harry are going to develop, and grow stronger and that they cannot be kept in close quarters all year long. I really do. But Harry isn’t going back there, we promised him that. I have a suggestion.”
“Do you think they’d be angry?”
“Would it?”
However, one Professor’s reaction took Draco by surprise. The newest Defence teacher, Quirrel, the stuttery one, looked distressed, as though somebody was telling him something that made him uncomfortable. Harry started holding his forehead and gasping at that point, before abruptly stopping. He had said that it was just a sudden headache.
“Now is NOT the time." he roared. "There is no reason to keep a child in an abusive home, I didn’t realise before but I do now. I had a rough upbringing, as you know, as you
“Me?”
“I’ll wait then. Maybe I’ll come up with something.”
“Seriously?”
“It just looks like a diary, to me.” he said with a shrug as he grabbed it. The date on the cover told him that it was fifty years old, and the smudged name on the first page told him that it belonged to someone called T.M. Riddle.
“Oh, wow.” Draco’s voice was suddenly thick with emotion. “That’s really Moony...” Then, his expression changed from one of awe to one of horror. He gasped, tears streaking down his face. “Oh..”
He quickly darted down the hall, running away from the pack of Aurors, all firing stunning charms at him and missing. It would have been comical if it weren’t for the circumstances.
Draco first realised that there was something special about him and his situation when he was eleven, and a cold breeze had consumed him just as he was about to leave his love to risk his life, or when he watched an older version of himself using only his hands to strike ice into the hearts of his family.
Draco begged Sirius to stay with him and play the game so Remus was going to go to the meeting with Dumbledore and McGonagall alone and report back. He waited to see his son greet his best friend again, if only for the fact that it was too darn sweet.
“We would be honored if you would. The child’s bank account was the only one of his assets that haven’t been frozen by the Ministry and you will get frequent payments in order to fulfill the child’s expenses…” She was speaking in clipped tones, clearly trying to withhold tears. What horrors this child must have suffered. “We know that he has a lot of archaic magic in him, but he has also shown some signs of unusual magic that could have grave consequences if honed and used for evil, so we need you two, good men, to raise him and, hopefully, show him the light.” Remus and Sirius had matching expressions of shock, and Remus held the child tighter. Eventually, the pair shared a look and Sirius spoke up.
“Oh, are we?” Said George. He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly and said, ‘I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.’ And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider’s web from the point that George’s wand had touched. They joined each other, they criss-crossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment, then words began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed:
“No, you do not get a discount.” Sirius chided. The chatter became background noise as Harry and Draco paired up again to walk behind them.
can’t be okay with this.”
“Are you asking about the Dursleys?” His voice was low and gravelly.
He nodded again.
Riddle hissed again.
“Okay. We’ll be careful.” Draco glowed internally at the inclusion. Although getting into trouble was never something he was too fond of, he liked the sound of access to the restricted section, especially now that he was looking for something specific.
“If the parents were in support, would you be more willing?” the old wizard probed.
“Name it.”
The kitchen was so silent you could hear a pin drop. Sirius took the seat next to Remus, not daring to look at his face. The other man hardly ever raised his voice.
, he’s an Auror! And a Professor! He should have known he’d be teaching Harry Potter, and he shouldn’t be getting starstruck.”
The group tiptoed through a passageway before entering a room that was filled with butterflies of some description. Draco furrowed his brows as he tried to figure out what the problem was as Harry tried the door.
James looked over to Sirius, seemingly expecting an answer, only to find him gazing down at Remus with a blank expression. He seemed to come to a realisation.
“Apparate us then, Sirius.”
Also I've had some ideas for other fic ideas that I kind of want to indulge (Drarry duh) just in case you might be interested. I want to do something period (like Victorian England or Gatsby style 20s)
“Fine. We’ll go tell Dumbledore.” They tried. It didn’t work. Because the old fool couldn’t stay in a school he was running, he was also simultaneously storing an incredibly precious and potentially dangerous artifact in for one second. At least that was what Draco had said once McGonagall had turned her back on the group. “Welp. It’s up to us now.” Draco groaned.
sexy. It was more about the painful amount of
He took the drinks back to the table and slid in next to James.
Dumbledore insisted that no one should know about Harry’s powers until he had them under control. He believed that if the public knew there were two children of prophecy living in the world, one being the son of a Death Eater and the other being The Boy Who Lived, there would be public outrage.
“Now, Sirius, it’s your turn.” James gave him an encouraging smile. “Repeat after me.”
“Nah, come in, Pads.”  Sirius’s strong arms wrapped around his two favourite people. “You know, Draco, you’re dad has a job now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
, it is not our responsibility.”
“At least not yet, you have to wait.” Remus reprimanded.
“You were really good, actually! I saw you fly this summer but I didn’t know you were that good!” he enthused. Draco blushed and linked his hand with Harry’s.
“I smell a rat, Moons.”
Remus hastily dissected the young boy’s expression. He didn’t seem distressed, or hateful of the name. “Yes. Peter Pettigrew.”
Sirius continued with the soothing motions and murmured in agreement.
Draco couldn’t be happier with his family.
“Unbelievable! You two are amazing!” It wasn’t actually that unbelievable, considering the other amazing things that the boys had done, and what their future had in store for them, but Remus thrived off of being supportive.
“Not what?”
“I felt it best that they did not grow up in close quarters. However, a small event of little importance, other than to the people that know about this, yourselves, Minerva, Severus and myself, may have changed things.”
He didn’t see quite how they would make it out alive.
The final game of the Quidditch Season was here and Harry was stressed. Draco could see the way that his best friend ran his fingers through his birds nest hair, getting them stuck along the way, and his nail biting habit had reached new lengths, but for the most part, Harry just seemed scared. The boy had a lot on his mind and Flint wasn’t helping in the slightest. With the Quidditch Cup on the line, the team had practise every other night and Harry was being worked harder than he had ever been worked. But the day of the game finally arrived and Draco’s parents came to see.
“I don’t know.” he shrugged. “Oh, Hooch is coming. We’re about to start again.”
“I am keyed in on every meeting, no exceptions.” Remus demanded. “Even if you’re going to tell me that there’s another secret chamber,” he listed on his fingers. “a potentially dangerous creature, a professor who may or may not have a mass murderer sucking their soul or possessing them, that includes the use of Polyjuice or the Imperius curse, pretty much anything Voldemort.” Fudge and McGonagall shuddered. “I want to know about
“It’s okay, Draco.” the boy soothed, stroking Draco’s hair and tilting their foreheads together.
Remus sniffled. “It’s just - I know what it’s like to be powerful and it’s not fun. It’s painful and upsetting and I know it’ll feel the same, if not worse for them.”
Harry inhaled quickly in shock and carefully placed down his knife. “Does Draco know?”
“Do you not know anything about Hogwarts?”
“I love you.” Draco paused for a moment and looked at Harry in bemusement. They had said it to each other before, but it held more meaning to him now.
Which was true, but Harry hated watching Draco wince every morning as he saw the birds land on the window. He was pretending it didn’t bother him but it clearly did.
“No, I’ve never seen it before.”
Draco was lightly snoozing next to him so Harry shook him awake.
(See the end of the chapter for
. Pure, unadulterated love.
“Lets go again!”
Pansy scrunched up her nose. “No. I don’t think I like Quidditch Players.”
“...and he started talking about the Chamber-”
Gilderoy then stammered out some kind of nonsense about getting ready in his office and departed, so Harry and Draco waited until all the other teachers did the same before rushing after him.
“Separate rooms?”
The Professor came in and surveyed the scene before her. The still alive body of her ex-student, bound and gagged in the corner, and his old best friends glaring daggers down at him. It made her sad, even more so than she had been after the whole affair. She could barely see the cocky children she had watched growing up anymore. She felt old.
- Finally, because I know y’all wanna get to the good stuff - I have exams in a few weeks, like the really big important ones (yikes) so I might be kinda slow on the uploads. Thanks for being so patient x love y’all 💕💕
“Did you run all the way here?” He managed to get out through his giggles. Harry’s breathing was finally under control and he managed to form a coherent sentence.
“What, are you gonna read to me?” Harry joked, eyes glittering.
The Chamber was dark and eerie, with stone pillars lining the walls. At the opposing end, there was a statue of some kind of monkey man with a really long beard, probably Salazar Slytherin, Draco deduced. He looked over at Harry who was taking his surroundings in with heavy breaths until the stopped abruptly and his eyes lay on a small heap at the foot of the statue.
“Harry, you do have a link to Voldemort. I very much doubt that he only left a scar on your head that night in Godric’s Hollow.” Draco sighed and sat down next to his friend. “Look, I have to deal with scared idiots all the time. And, trust me, it gets better. It only proves who your real friends are.”
“-Egg thing-”
“Yeah?”
“What is it?” he snapped.
“Are you okay, Rem?” he hissed.
“Hello, Harry,” he had said. “I’m Ron Weasley.” The Weasley boy kept stealing glances at Draco, as though he was ready for him to pounce at any moment. Harry had shaken hands with him, a shy smile toying at his lips, clearly uncomfortable with people knowing his name without him offering it.
Draco sniffed and wiped his nose with his hand. “Okay.”
But it all came to a head on the night of his nightmare, the one about his father. It was too intense not to be real,
“Oh my God. As if that kid couldn’t be any stranger.”
Sirius hesitated. "Because the world is shit. Because you are my son, and you are so much better than all of these idiots." He gestured to the conglomeration of snarky schoolchildren behind him. "You are going to make it through this year, just as you made it through every other year, because you are strong enough." He sighed and looked at Harry, who was saying his farewells to Remus. "And... I know I was a little harsh with him... but he's a very good kid. The most lovely one I think you could have been friends with. I'm glad you have him. And for what its worth, I'm glad he has you. Through all the obstacles this universe is throwing at you, you get along remarkably well."
“Stop! Dobby stop!” He tried to pry the creature away from it, but it only seemed to spur him on. That was until Remus and Sirius barged into the room.
“You know, I think it's going to snow tomorrow…”
“May we please have a discussion in private, Minnie.”
“See you at the bottom!” said Harry, as he gave him a push. He then waited a few seconds for his teacher to reach the bottom, although he didn’t know exactly where that would be, and allowed himself to slide down too, for that was what it really was, a slide. A strange, dark and murky slide, but a slide all the same. He could just make out the murky walls and other paths branching out in different directions. He didn’t have much time to wonder if the landing would be painful, as the tube levelled out and he was spouted out the bottom on a grimy floor.
Every member of the table nodded. “That seems fair.” Fudge said. He then extended his hand for a shake. “Congratulations, Professor Lupin-Black.”
McGonagall sighed. “Take him to the Forbidden Forest, but don’t go too far in and try to avoid Hagrid’s Care of Magical Creatures class. Also, if any of the creatures who live in the forest approach you, explain the situation. They know all about it and are very good about it. Well, most of them, we’ll keep Hagrid on high alert.”
speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then -” the ghost swelled importantly. “I
“Maybe I should be there?”
“I think we have to play. Alright, Harry, you go in the place of that bishop, Hermione you be a castle.”
“Does it scare you?” Harry asked quietly.
“Yes, sir.”
“You ready?” said Minnie.
“Are you done?” Draco grinned but begrudgingly dislodged himself from Harry’s arms.
“The boys want to know about Wormtail.”
“Alright, how about you, me and Draco all lift this onto the train? Then it can be a joint effort. How about that?” The raven haired boy seemed to consider this for a moment, before allowing Draco and Sirius to help him. It took a few minutes, but eventually, after giving Draco a giant hug, whispering in his ear to write as often as he could, and giving Harry a pat on the back and wishing him luck, Remus could see his son sitting comfortably in a compartment opposite the scrawny boy and smiled. He felt warm arms wrap around his torso and breathed in the familiar smell of his husband. Waving his son off, both men felt a wave of emotion crash around them.
Underneath it, something was hanging. Upon closer inspection, it was Mrs Norris, still and rigid. Unmoving.
As per his regular tradition, Draco woke up his dads by leaping on their bed and screaming in their ears before scampering off with Harry to retrieve the stockings. They sat around the fireplace, which was burning hot on the embers all day long, and danced to Muggle Christmas songs that Harry introduced them to, and that Sirius was deeply enjoying.
“Why?”
“Draco, I think you know what’s happening right now.”
They should have Barbie movies on Netflix because I kid you not Barbie The Princess and The Pauper is one of my favourite movies ever and I'm sick of having to put in a DVD everytime I want to watch it.
He was slowly getting more and more irritated. “But Draco and Harry could defeat him in two seconds, if they had the proper training!”
As James and Minerva passed each other, they shared a look that Sirius couldn’t miss: a cheeky, inside grin that made it clear they were making fun of him a little.
“Never.” Harry was watching him with the same wide-eyed adoration that he wore whenever Draco did something to impress him, or was anticipating that Draco would do something to impress him. The look that Draco could never resist. He sighed, pressed the button that turned the thing invisible for Muggles and started the engine.
“Well, I just sent a letter to the Lupin-Blacks to check in, so we’ll see.” McGonagall started arranging her knives and forks in a specific pattern. “Harry, I am sure that Draco has told you why his father was arrested.” Harry nodded. “Well, a few years ago, some Aurors discovered that, along with association with You-Know-You, and probably under his orders, Lucius Malfoy murdered three muggles and a witch while they were in their house.”
His hands were so close to the flames that they were practically licking his skin when Draco shrieked. “HARRY, WHAT THE HELL?” He was finally broken out of his trance and looked up to find the other boy sat up, shirt so unbuttoned he could see the pale planes of his chest rising and falling, his hair ruffled and damp with sweat, staring at him as though he had two heads. Harry gulped and blushed at the display.
“What?” he groaned.
He explained that the creature rattling the wardrobe was a Boggart, which made Draco feel a little queasy.
It was all very exciting, Harry had never had a big party before, especially not with so many people he could genuinely say that he was close to. Whenever something big happened with the Dursleys he was always put on kitchen duty or told to stay in his room. He had a very distinct memory of being about six or seven, and waking up on his birthday to the sound of music, and getting excited, thinking that his Aunt and Uncle were finally going to celebrate with him, but walking downstairs only to be told that they were testing out music for a party of their own they were having. A party he was most certainly not invited to.
“Boys,” he started. “we understand that you may not want to relive it all again, but do you have any questions you’d like to ask us? It must have been very confusing.” His voice was smooth and comforting, like honey, and made Draco feel safe.
After a few moments of silence where neither knew quite what to say, they were saved by the rustle of two owls flying down to the table - Hedwig, carrying with her a copy of the Daily Prophet, and a Hogwarts owl, carrying what was probably the response to the letter McGonagall had written earlier. They each took their things and Harry slid a knut into Hedwig's pouch and gave her a treat before they headed off.
“Well, Pads and Moony asked if you wanted to come and stay with us. I mean, we could spend every day together, and you can get to know your godfather.” Draco felt suddenly sheepish, knowing that it was probably a stupid offer, but Harry’s eyes were suddenly glassy and his smile, watery.
“Getting married?” Sirius nodded. “Well, I was a lot calmer than you are, that’s for sure. But I remember being really worried that Lily would decide that she actually didn’t want to marry me the second she got on the altar.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry was my goal!” he yelled. “And you, of course!”
“...Okay.” Harry’s voice was barely above a whisper. “I’m sorry.”
“Yeah! No shit!” He was panting, desperately trying to keep his eyes on the path ahead. “Harry! This was such a bad idea. Why did we think this was a good idea?” Both boys were still screaming over the noise of the engine.
“What do we do now?” asked Harry.
“Hi.” he whispered.
“Hey, dad.” Said Draco, innocently.
“It - well - it shows me and my family - and Draco and his parents”
“Seriously? You don’t remember?” Draco seemed baffled.
“Happy Valentine's Day!” the man cried. “And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn’t end here!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s their funeral. I think, though, that they’ll be safer if we’re there.”
“I’m sorry about his favouritism, he shouldn’t have done that. It was a joint effort.” Hermione smiled and surveyed him with scrutinising eyes.
Extra chapter because I felt like it
“But Harry isn’t finished!” protested Sirius, gesturing towards the boy, who was now sitting, cross-legged in front of the stone, and seemed to be talking to it.
“‘Course, Harry. Just watch carefully!” With that, he raced at the wall with his luggage as Harry glared in wonder.
And closer again.
“Just do what I did, Harry.”
“Trust me, dad. I already do.” Draco was always quite reserved with his emotions. They could often be so strong that they practically toppled him over. He would also be lying if he said that he wasn’t almost toppled over by them when he first met Harry. He could remember it as if it were only yesterday. The piercing, emerald eyes, scruffy hair. It wasn’t even the scar Draco had noticed first. The scar didn’t matter to him. All he cared for was his shy smile and slightly pink cheeks. Draco knew then that Harry Potter would be the death of him, and he had spent every day since then doing his best to ensure that wouldn’t happen. But, sure enough, the untidy eleven year old Draco had met on the platform that day all those years ago had snaked into his heart and built a home there.
“That’s me?” He grinned and bumped their shoulders together.
“Again, Draco. Let the anger take over.”
- Fourthly, I just want to apologise to anybody who is waiting for a sex scene in a later instalment (like in the fifth or sixth book) I just... I don't think I can do it. I tried but it was really difficult and it didn't sound right. If anyone is good at writing sex scenes, I issue an open invitation to try because I seriously don't know how people do it.
“Alright, James, you get a lily tattoo.” he said, finally breaking the stare. “Come on, I’ll go with you.”
“We need to get into the meeting.”
Draco, from Harry, had received a Muggle book too, uncharmed though, this time. It was a story book, evidently. Much like his book of wizard fairy tales, but these were written by-
Harry waited anxiously as Dobby opened the bag. “Master has given Dobby a sock, master gave it to Dobby.” The elf held the slimy thing as though it were some priceless treasure.
The Weasleys and Hermione said their goodbyes at about eight, and Hagrid excused himself as he had to go and feed some animal he was currently trying to breed. McGonagall herself stayed for a little longer, but had to get up to the castle for an urgent meeting with Dumbledore about the positioning for the Dementors, something that Harry had learned about from Sirius and Remus, something Harry had learned wasn’t very nice. But the Professor had told them that they were welcome to stay as long as they wanted.
“You know who made this map?” he started, as if it wasn’t already obvious.
“Dobby has got a sock,” said Dobby in disbelief. “Master even put it in a pouch for Dobby! Dobby is free!”
“How did you know -”
“No, I don’t remember. Are you feeling okay, Harry? Maybe you should go see Madam Pomfrey.” Their eyes caught and, for once, Draco didn’t look away. But he did look scared, lonely somehow. Dread painting his features. But he schooled his mask neutral and held the gaze. “I’m sorry I’ve been distant this week. We both need each other, that wasn’t fair. Forgive me?”
“Are you okay, Harry?” said Draco “Are you happy?”
“You wish.”
“Professor Dumbledore is particularly famous for
“Well… when we were in our first year, Harry - young carefree and innocent-” Harry snorted. He doubted Fred and George had ever been innocent. “-Well, more innocent than we are now - we got into a spot of bother with Filch…”
“What do you say, Moony? Want to get a tattoo?” he jeered.
“Right,” Said George briskly. “Don’t forget to wipe it after you’ve used it-”
“...and then Quirrell was all ‘No- not again, please!’ and then he ran out of the room and Snape looked really pleased and I mean it was so obvious that Snape was torturing him! I bet he was using medieval methods, some really gruesome ones. Maybe Snape is trying to make Quirrell go into the dungeon for him… Or maybe! Oh, Draco, do you remember what Hagrid said about…” Draco drowned the rest of it out as his eyes caught on a hooded figure kneeling over the corpse of something white and glowing, pressing it’s teeth to its neck. The unicorn! Harry had stopped speaking, instead gasping and holding his forehead in pain.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Har har.” He deadpanned.
“We need to call Dumbledore.”
“What are you guys talking about?” he choked, eyes prickling.
Tell me!!
“No, I’m Sirius.” He deadpanned and Harry cackled with glee.
Not that Draco found it ugly, Harry noted.
“He insisted, and he’s not half bad.” Draco saw his dads share a pointed look, there were many things that were being hidden away from him this Christmas. But all of his worries melted away when they were all sitting at the table, pulling crackers. They laughed and talked and raved about the food, which could rival the Hogwarts welcome feast, and finally gathered in the sitting room when they were almost too stuffed to move. Draco set about splitting the presents into piles. His was the largest, but Harry’s had a suspicious package from a mysterious person. “Did you put that in there, Pads?” said Moony.
The house itself was lovely, a little thatched cottage just off the main road with a wonderful apple tree in the back garden that Draco was exceedingly fond of. It was just big enough for the bench swing that was attached to one of its branches, the swing that he used whenever he could as a comfortable and quiet reading spot.
Draco hadn’t seen the dementors. Nobody had. Although his focus was almost exclusively on the Quaffle, so he probably wouldn’t have noticed them anyway, but he was always fine-tuned to the wellbeing of Harry Potter, and seeing him fall from the sky like he was falling from heaven itself, did definitely turn his head.
The blonde thought for a moment before sitting fully on the floor and removing a singular sock. “Okay, Harry, here’s what we’re going to do…” He went on and listed the plan. It was complicated, but Harry felt sure that it would work. He peeked inside the gaping pockets of the stockier man’s coat, inside was an old quill, a jar of some unknown, icky substance, and a pouch.
Once he sent the letter off, he turned back to his husband with a weary smile.
“MEMORIES CAN BE TAMPERED WITH!” That shut Harry up, he clearly hadn’t known that. “And even if it is a true memory, that isn’t our PROBLEM!” He shouted the last word for good measure, before collapsing back on the bed. He located his wand and cast a small healing charm for his throat. “Harry.”
“I’m okay, dad. I don’t see you any differently, if that’s what you’re worried about. And I understand why you didn’t tell me. I just want you to know that I love you, no matter what.” Remus’s eyes were prickling. Truly, he was worried about Draco seeing him differently. But, the person he saw before him was not a boy anymore, he was growing into a man. Remus was proud that he and Sirius had managed to raise him to be good.
“Oh Merlin. Moony look!” Remus watched as his husband turned a sickly yellow before following his line of vision to take in the boy. He was a carbon copy of James, couldn’t be mistaken, it was unnerving. And that scar proved what he already knew to be true.
A smiley face, a heart, a snowflake. He had to scare off a few fully fingered rats along the way until finally,
“Let’s go fight a Basilisk, shall we?” Draco grinned in response and set up his pose, as Harry raced forward. It actually wasn’t that difficult to learn how to use the bow and arrow, it was probably bewitched with some kind of magic that prevented you from being bad at it, for it only took one failed aim to finally get the hang of it. After one failed shot, he actually managed to get one on the creature’s underbelly, buried deep. The arrows were clearly sharp.
They talked about what could have hurt Mrs Norris, which Harry didn’t really care about. He was more focused on whatever the hell the Chamber of Secrets was and why he was hearing whispers through the wall.
“Myrtle? But she’s so annoying.”
“I hear a voice, come on.”
Sirius let go but continued holding his hand. It was so nice. The comforting breeze. All of it. That was until Draco caught a slight glimpse of platinum blonde ducking behind an old cottage.
“But you’re one of the most influential people of our generation, you’re in History books.” murmured Blaise, incredulously. He was one of the few people who weren’t charmed by Lockhart, probably because he had 'higher standards than that'.
At his command, the gates opened with an ominous creek. Guards lined the walls, still and unmoving, like corpses. The pair forced their feet onwards, following their assigned Auror, to the cell of Lucius Malfoy.
“Remus? Are you in there?” a Scottish voice called from behind the door.
“Ha. Yes, your father and he were best friends.” Harry considered this for a moment, watching Pads with curious eyes.
“Well, I didn’t think that they would get involved! I was away on business! I sent the order to close down the school, I didn’t know they were doing research!” he held his hands up in the air innocently and looked up at his former student from his seat.
“Who dares me to get a tattoo from that witch over there?” he asked the group. He noticed Remus avert his eyes and he thought he may have seen the boy blushing, but it could have been the low lighting.
In a series of rabid screams or anger and emotion, and wave after wave of icy attacks on trees and plants, Draco allowed the irritation to channel into powerful snowstorms.
Harry turned back to look at him with a grin of pride. “Well, you heard him.” He started walking too, checking back a couple of times to ensure the bumbling fool was indeed trailing him. They found Draco in the girls toilets, as Harry had assumed he would be in, deep in an intense conversation with Myrtle, who was lounging carelessly on the windowsill.
But something happened that stirred him into action, Hermione Granger was Petrified.
“Congratulations, Draco.” said Hermione, moving forward to hug him. Ron kept his distance but offered his commendation all the same.
“Yes. I just threw a snowball in Draco’s face and he said it didn’t feel cold, help me. I don’t know what to do.” Sirius was properly sobbing now. The kind of heartbreaking sobs that held your lungs in a clench. He wanted to ease him out of it but could figure out how to move his limbs. They were twelve for God’s sake. No twelve year old should have to suffer from that.
“I’ll miss you guys, too.” Harry grinned. “See you in three weeks!”
Sirius seemed to constantly be furious at Albus Dumbledore. What used to be an unwavering respect, since turned out to be more of a raging hatred for everything the old man stood for. He could carry on ranting for years about his methods, and certainly would, but today he genuinely didn’t have it in him.
“Affirm my love for you, Sirius Orion Black.”
Harry needed to show Draco, he needed someone to tell him that he wasn’t crazy. He hastily covered himself in the cloak and sped down the hall until he reached the Slytherin common room, where he held the cloak open and demanded that Draco come with him. After some protestations, Harry finally planted the other boy in front of the mirror and waited for his reaction. His face lit up.
So what do you guys think Amortentia would smell like to you? Most appetising answer wins an imaginary slice of my awesome cake.
“Sure!”
It was Draco who said something first. “Dad?” he said, turning his head to Sirius.
Sirius guided them to a gated park filled with hundreds of gravestones, and navigated them over to one in particular, that was engraved with the names ‘James and Lily Potter’ and the words “The last enemy that shall be defeated is death.” Despite never knowing Harry’s parents, Draco found himself mourning their deaths all the same. He looked to Harry, usually such a beacon, now dimmed slightly, his face drawn and contemplative, with dried tears leaving faint, salty marks on his cheeks. Draco knew he needed some time alone.
When he reached it, he could barely catch enough light to see the map in front of his eyes, so he tentatively cast a
“Remus and Sirius have Draco!”
They stood up, with the pouch behind their backs, just as the two men were leaving. They shared a quick smirk before Harry caught up with them in the corridor.
Quidditch tryouts were coming up and Harry and Draco couldn’t be more excited. The only position open was Seeker, so Draco had resigned himself to the fact that he probably wasn’t going to get it, but Harry knew that he really wanted it. And Draco was a very good flyer, he could completely take on the Seeker position if he wanted to, and Harry would happily give it to him. But that didn’t mean he wasn’t going to try out at all, Draco had insisted they do it together.
“Hello, Vernon, Petunia.” His voice was like shards of ice, cold and menacing. “I wanted to tell you in person, if Harry is amenable, you will never need to see him again.” Harry’s eyes widened and filled with tears. It was more than he could have hoped for, to say goodbye to his current life in exchange for a better one. He couldn’t speak, or express how happy he was, so just stared as the Dursleys gave Harry curt nods of goodbye. They couldn’t seem to find words either. All Harry could do was raise a hand and fitfully twitch it in some sort of resemblance of a wave. Sirius had turned back to him now, eyes wary. “Are you alright, Harry? Would you like that?” There were tears of pure joy streaming down Harry’s face.
The three wizards sat in contemplative silence. The magnitude of what they had been running from for years was finally catching up with them, and the Wizarding World was once again in danger, even though most of them were blissfully unaware of it.
- I say this all the time, but I'm tired. If you see any spelling mistakes I miss, I won't be offended if you tell me in the comments, in fact, I'll be grateful. I know you think it might sound rude if you tell me, but I promise you won't, you'll just be doing me a favour.
“Thank you.” he choked out in between sobs. That statement didn’t quite cover it. Nothing could ever cover the intense amount of genuine emotion he was feeling.
“Oh no…” he moaned, but out of the corner of his eye he could see a figure by one of the pillars. He flipped around, wand held high, running through every spell he had taught himself in the past year. Before he could demand the boy’s identity, he spoke softly to Harry alone.
“Well, what would you’ve done?” Said Fred. “George caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open and grabbed - this.” He gestured to the parchment in his hand.
“About Lucius being a murderer?” The boy shrank back into his seat and looked guilty.
Once he left, Draco turned back to the man he could have called a father, in another life.
“Don’t you have something else in your life that brings you joy? Other than tormenting children I mean.” Draco snapped, face set and stormy.
Harry could see in his mind’s eye the image of Draco curled up in a ball on his bed, darting his gaze to the door every few seconds. It made his heart pang. “Can we invite them for a game today?” he suggested. “We need someone to fill the spot you’re going to leave empty!”
Marcus Flint announced the new team members, and Draco was obviously one of them. Harry ran up to him and hugged him tight before catching his lips off guard in a congratulatory kiss that they held for a few seconds before releasing and addressing the other members of their party.
“Oh, so this is about blood.” Harry had heard quite a bit of the blood status debate in his time at Hogwarts and it seemed a little ridiculous. He didn’t know much about magic, but he knew that his mother was a muggle born witch and that she was an incredible witch. He also knew Hermione, who was the smartest in their year, and she was a muggleborn!
“And do you, Sirius Orion Black, take Remus John Lupin to be your lawfully and magically wedded husband?”
“What about?”
Harry and Draco found out from Pansy Parkinson, who had found out from Blaise Zabini, who had found out from Seamus Finnigan, who had found out from the Gryffindor boys dorm. It wasn’t long before the entire school was whispering about the girl, and Harry felt awful. If he had shared the information he had, or gotten to McGonagall’s office faster, he could have stopped it. Draco reassured him, however, that he shouldn’t blame himself for things that monsters in secret chambers do, but eventually asked Harry if they could go to see her.
How are you guys doing? Doing good?
” It said. Harry pushed his ear up against the wall to hear it better, ignoring Draco’s protestations. The voice moved along the corridor, Harry followed it. And they ended up running at full speed down the hallways, getting more and more lost with every turn. Draco was panting behind him.
“We could use this map to look for Lucius.” was Harry’s final thought, just before sleep consumed him.
Harry approached slowly and calmly sat himself down beside him. “Are you alright?”
“Ooooh, it was dreadful. It happened right in here. I died in this very cubicle. I remember it so well. I’d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said something funny. A different language, I think it must have been. Anyway, what really got me was that it was a
Crabbe ended up with a broken ankle and Goyle hit his head against the rock as they were trying to get down and escape. Buckbeak didn’t touch either of them, and yet they were yelling something about crazed animals. It was actually quite funny at the time. They looked like giant babies.
“HE HAS NO BONES LEFT, YOU MORON!” cried Draco. Harry was shocked that his friend was speaking that way to a teacher. But then, he thought, Lockhart hadn’t done anything in his time here that could be deserving of that title.
Draco surveyed the man with a cautious eye. He was standing with his back turned to them but Draco could feel the magical eye piercing through his skull and staring directly at him. “Why do I get the feeling that he isn’t starstruck?”
“I was just really immersed in the book?” he offered, to no avail. If it weren’t for the three sleeping boys in the room, Draco would have been having a hissy fit. He cast a silencing charm over the bed and clambered in, drawing the curtains behind him. He then let it rip.
Sirius kicked a wall and growled, low and loud. Minerva would do the same if it weren’t for her dignity.
Ron followed Harry’s line of vision and a realisation seemed to dawn on him before he scoffed incedulously. “They’re just friends, Harry.”
“Hey.” he replied in a monotone. James didn’t seem to notice, he rarely did.
“Uncle Vernon sounds like a prick.” Harry giggled, then snorted, which turned into a fit of sheepish laughter, clearly not accustomed to hearing people badmouth his uncle, or such language.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’ll leave you to it, then, Gilderoy,” said McGonagall “Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We’ll make sure everyone’s out of your way. You’ll be able to tackle the monster all by yourself. A free rein at last.” Harry could hear the challenge dripping from her tone and smiled slightly, she was a badass.
“Can we just try again in the morning, please?” The edges of Sirius’s eyes were raw and red, clearly he needed sleep before confronting Dumbledore.
“We’re back?”
“Seriously?” Harry squeaked incredulously, from his spot on the floor near the fireplace. “It’s freezing. Can I turn the fire on?”
“Do you ever wonder, if Peter hadn’t ratted us out, if James and Lily were still here, if they would have been able to handle this situation with their son and our son better than we are?” he asked, turning towards Sirius.
Draco prickled at the Death Eater comment but revelled in the knowledge that the scary man’s attention was away from his Harry. “Why?”
Christmas had finally arrived and Harry was spending it at the Lupin-Blacks! Remus couldn’t be more excited. The year before had gone so well, and he was determined to make Harry feel as though he was a part of the family. This was especially important for Sirius, who felt quite a personal connection to Harry.
” said Draco, and a long, black snake shot out the tip of his wand.
“He’s not strange, he’s gifted.”
“Well the actual box cost me nothing.” said Draco offhandedly “Another amazing find from Grimmauld Place. I only had to pay for the engravings. See, if you look closeley.” He pointed at the shiny clasp on the side which said:
They spent the night pouring over the map. Draco was fascinated by it, especially because his fathers had had a hand in creating it.
“Don’t I always?”
“SIRIUS WILL YOU JUST SIT DOWN?”
Harry blushed. “Yeah. It’s Muggle. I just thought that you might want to add some more photos onto your wall.” He was now staring at his knees, uncomfortable.
“Woah.” he murmured softly as he traced his hand over the glowing dots, blocking their light momentarily and revealing it again by removing his fingers. “It’s beautiful. Thank you.”
“So what happens if we can’t find someone to take Harry in?” asked Remus, worriedly.
Still, it wasn’t nice to know that your father was ever anything less than a kind person, but it wasn’t like his father was an ex-Death Eater who escaped from Azkaban. He turned to Draco at this thought, who was entranced in the heavens.
Harry could barely contain a gleeful smile when the text faded away, but Snape was livid. He grasped onto Harry’s arm with a painful strength and yanked him down the hall. He seemed to be heading to the dungeons, and eventually, to his own office.
The excitement of the day had made Harry all but forget his previous worries about getting Draco in trouble and Gilderoy Lockhart. He fell blissfully into a deep sleep, welcoming the feeling of home that Hogwarts gave him.
” His friend commanded, and he watched in awe at Lockhart, who seemed to be utterly confused.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“Legal things, it’s complicated.” Draco could tell that they were lying, but he felt that he would prefer that explanation than the one that they were hiding. ‘Legal things’ was good enough for him.
“Okay…” she didn’t seem very interested, instead paying more attention to her nail beds, which Draco had mentioned were terrible, and hardly looked up to survey the newcomer.
“Harry, can I ask you something?”
“Oh yes, that was a good day. The slimy git had just banned stink bombs, and we were not happy.” Harry reverently closed the book and looked up at Sirius with open eyes. Lily’s eyes, he noted. He still felt that lurch in his stomach whenever Harry reminded him of his late best friends but, now it had a bittersweet tone. As though they were living on through their child. It made Sirius feel more hopeful about the future, which seemed so set in stone. “Harry, can we talk for a second?”
“No.” Remus whispered, low and deafening. “They don’t need the burden just yet, let them enjoy being children for just a little longer.”
“I’d really miss you if you’d died.”
Harry and Draco were simply trotting down the corridor, discussing the duelling club and all that came with it, when Harry stopped dead in his tracks. Justin was collapsed on the floor, rigid, with a look of shock on his face, and Nearly Headless Nick was floating a few feet above him, no longer pearly which and translucent, instead black and smoky. Justin had been clearly petrified, but he had no clue what had happened to Nick.
“It doesn’t matter about Ginny!” he snapped and took a deep, calming breath. “The point is, she did stop trusting the diary and tried to flush it, which was where you came in, Harry.” He turned his eyes to said boy. “I showed you the memory of me capturing the great oaf, Hagrid.”
“For being an idiot?” he heard the other boy chuckle. “Yes.”
“Sorry.” Harry dimmed the light just a little before turning his attention to the ominous, inky footsteps of Peter Pettigrew that scampered around him, or so said the Marauders Map.
Draco felt truly warm for the first time in a while, after being so cold for so long.
“I have a few questions.”
“Can I think about it?”
“It reminded me of the day Sirius, your father, and... our other friend, found out.”
“We could use the Charms classroom on the second floor?” Draco suggested, but Sirius interrupted him.
A weight on Draco’s shoulder pulled him out of the moment, and he looked up to see his father’s face peering down at him with a slight smirk.
“Are you feeling better now?” asked Harry.
“Are you a ghost?” Harry asked, uncertainly.
So he was more than a little surprised to be cornered by the twins on his way out of Divination.
They sent the owl off with strict instructions to return as quickly as possible, and then walked down to the Great Hall, where they always enjoyed a quiet breakfast while discussing future plans and the Daily Prophet.
“-detention-”
“Because I’m only an ickle eleven year old boy.”
Draco cackled and turned to Harry with a smile that could blind Voldemort, he had tears of happiness in his eyes, making them a more potent shade of dark silver. “I love it, Harry. Thank you.”
“A really big poop?”
“Interesting. I wonder what this Mirror does?” Their conversation was interrupted by a sudden shuffle of footsteps outside the room.
“Oh, but I did.”
“You two have displayed stupidity and foolishness, traits that may be celebrated in other houses,” He spat out the last two words with a pointed look at McGonagall, who looked rather put-out. “but are not celebrated in Slytherin. However, you have also shown incentive, which is admirable. For that, and sheer dumb luck, you will each be awarded 10 points. Now, get back to the dungeons, eat dinner and go straight to bed.” Harry and Draco were about to leave when Snape stopped them, for just a moment. “Draco, don’t think your parents won’t be notified.” Draco nodded, grabbed Harry’s hand and dragged him down the corridor until they were both playfully bumping into each other on their way down the stairs, exchanging sentiments of disbelief.
The corners of Lucius’s mouth curled not quite upwards to create a grimace that displayed his yellow teeth. “What are you doing here, boy?”
“Moony taught it to me over Easter, he said it was good for self defence. I don’t know how long it will last so we have to be quick.”
“Is that man serious? Keeping a beast like that on the third floor of a school?” Sirius sounded hysterical and his breakfast was discarded in his haste to get to the bedroom to get fully dressed, presumably so that he could march through the Floo to give Dumbledore yet another piece of his mind.
“And it shows your friend, Draco, with his family and you.”
There was a fight in Diagon Alley. One between Arthur Weasly and Vincent Crabbe Sr. of all people. Draco giggled at the picture of the two men at each other’s throats, being pulled apart by other shoppers, in the Daily Prophet. It was quite a ridiculous sight. Seeing the pale faces of Crabbe and Goyle in the background, completely baffled by it, was the icing on the cake.
He raised his head and looked deep into Harry’s eyes, absorbing the emerald green-ness as much as he possibly could, focusing on that rather than the image of a man who looked exactly like him on the cover of the Daily Prophet, growling like a beast of some kind. How had he never noticed the darker green flecks in the middle? Or the contrast between the colour and the whites of his eyes and colour of his skin and the way that it blended to make the most wonderful palette. Draco watched in wonder as his pupils dilated, leaving only a slim ring of bright green.
His face flushed - perhaps Valentines day wasn’t so bad after all.
Once it was finally over, he fell, like a paper doll onto the floor, choking on the bitter taste of his own blood, and the saltiness of tears. He never usually cried. Somewhere along the line, he became numb to the pain. He wept now for the loss of his childhood, the normal life he could have had, for the secret he held onto with everything he had, the disappointment in his father’s eyes when they saw each other, the confusion in Sirius’s when he explained his monthly disappearances, the knowledge that disgust could so easily replace it with one slip of the tongue. He wept out of exhaustion. Sheer, brutal, raw exhaustion that made his teeth chatter, jaw ache and bones shiver. He wept because he didn’t see much left to live for, and for the knowledge that he could never bring himself to lose hope that someday there would be.
“Hi, Hagrid. We just wanted to ask you something?” Harry felt Draco’s eyes burning holes into the back of his skull. Hagrid gestured for him to continue. “You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger look like?”
They all smiled warmly and crowded around his side of the bed. “Remus,” Sirius started. “If you’re a monster, then so am I. And so is James, and Pete. We’re best friends, we stick together through anything.”
“You have both been very foolish.” He swiped his greasy hair back from his forehead before continuing. “However, you have caused no damage to the grounds, thanks to your driving skills, so I can’t give you a punishment. Your fathers, Draco, will decide what to do.”
He shuffled forward. “Does that really matter, though?”
As Remus got to the altar, Minerva leaned forward and muttered “You take care of him now, Mr Lupin.”
“It’s Filch! Run!” Harry scream-whispered at Draco who looked longingly at the door of the library as he dragged him away. The boys ran until their lungs hurt and finally stopped at a big, wooden door. Harry tried to open it but it wouldn’t budge.
Harry cleared his throat and took a sip of tea, presumably to distract himself from the mistake McGonagall made. “Of course, go right ahead. I’ll probably send them my version of events too.”
“How dare you come in, when he is physically incapable of teaching, because of an illness inflicted on him when he was a child, and teach his students that he is a predator. He’s the best teacher we’ve ever had, and other years all feel the same.” Draco was being ruled by his adrenaline. Somewhere in him, an anger was awakening, one that he hadn’t felt since the dream all those months ago, and it was ringing in his ears. He probably couldn’t have stopped even if he wanted to.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t have an answer. But I think that, right now, we need to owl Draco and tell him not to sneak out again. You forget that the poor boy is only eleven, we have time.” Padfoot seemed resigned, his anger now dissipated. He dragged his feet into the study and found himself a quill and some parchment, started writing a response, and then tied it to the leg of Draco’s bird. Once it took off, Sirius meandered his way over to Remus and buried his face in his neck. “Everything will be alright, Pads. I promise. One step at a time?”
“Why would he be mad at you?”
“Will do. Be safe, Moony.”
"Are you okay?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Riddle seemed pleased, Harry must have told him how he survived, something Draco didn’t even know. He probably should have been listening, but he was more concerned about their impending deaths. What in Dumbledore’s name were they going to do with a Phoenix and the Sorting Hat? Draco ran through everything he knew about Phoenixes in his head; regeneration, immense strength, song, healing tears, he supposed those would be useful. But he couldn’t think of anything about the Sorting Hat, as far as he was aware, all it did was sit in Dumbledore’s office writing cryptic songs all year, it could hardly be a good weapon in a duel. Unless they wanted to sort Tom Riddle again, they were basically screwed. And the snake was on its way, Draco could feel it in it’s bones.
“Probably.” Harry watched as his friend set his face in a stony mask.
Draco passed him a long, thin package reverently.
Harry’s first week at Hogwarts was, from an outsider's perspective, pretty eventful, what with flying lessons, and figuring out the endlessly confusing staircases and his best friend being the subject of ruthless speculation, not to mention the rumours that followed
With the solemn occasion of Halloween over and done with, Remus was free to begin extra-curricular defense training with Harry and Draco. They gathered in the classroom on a gloomy Wednesday night and got started.
“Okay, so you wanted her to get suspicious?” They were actually arguing, now, it was comical. Draco did have a terrible habit of getting too heated and talking back to his superiors, but as far as he was concerned, this was just a memory of some man who had done some horrible things. How dangerous could a memory be?
I'm sorry.
“NO! WE NEED TO OPEN OUR PRESENTS!!”
“I don’t know. Rockstar, maybe?” That managed to get a low chuckle out of Remus. “Hey. We’ll figure it out. One step at a time, okay?”
To cheer him up, he and Harry flipped through The Quibbler every morning and became rapid fans. Such big fans they were of it that when they visited the Weasleys for Sunday lunch one week, they insisted on visiting the Lovegoods.
“Why?”
“Malfoy.” Draco finished, and Hagrid’s face paled. He turned his eyes back to Harry and asked, in a low voice, if he could have a word in private. Harry looked confusedly between his friends but followed Hagrid a little further away from Draco.
A little life update with me, it was my birthday on Friday, I turned sixteen, which is fun, and we got a puppy on Saturday, which is also fun. Her name is Margot she's a shitzu. How are you guys?
The next morning, while sitting in the Great Hall, thousands of owls swooped down from the ceiling, among them Draco’s own owl, the black-feathered Perseus, carrying his subscription from the Daily Prophet. As he landed, he managed just to avoid knocking over any glasses, but landed his foot in the strawberry jam. Harry giggled.
“Okay,” Draco sighed, crossing his arms. “What’s got you in such a huff?”
“The governors suspended you, Dumbledore.” the taller one started.
“From who?”
He looked directly at Harry, who seemed to be a little emotional, so he took the lead himself. “I am confused about a lot of things.” he said, in a quiet voice. “I’m assuming it was Dumbledore who sent the hat and the Phoenix, but why were we able to pull weapons out of it? I pulled out a bow and some arrows, and Harry pulled out a sword.”
. He was the reason Harry grew up without his parents. His focus had been on Lucius for Draco’s sake these past few months but, he wanted to see Peter Pettigrew, that hateful man, dead more than he wanted to see the sunrise tomorrow.
The boy seemed to take this a passable excuse and returned to his staring into nothingness. As did Remus.
Harry exhaled heavily. “I’m fine.” They walked in silence for the rest of the way, as Draco knew better than to push, until Harry gestured to a shiny, red door. “We’re here.”
Surprisingly, the Sytherins had taken very kindly to the events of the Quidditch match, and treated him not dissimilarly to how they would treat the Minister for Magic were he at the table, with awe and reverence. Draco immediately snapped at them to stop their ‘spineless ass-kissing’ and they had, but it was clear that they all thought Draco was an all powerful, dark warlock now, which angered Harry immensely.
“Yeah, love you too, Moony.”
“We came because we wanted to talk to you.” said Draco.
The teacher lay the letter aside and fussed around with her butter while responding. “He’s fine, tense apparently. It seems he had some dream last night about Lucius and now he doesn’t know what to think.”
Another thing they had to be thankful for was insurance, something that Remus had cleverly remembered before they purchased the broom, so it wasn’t that big of a deal anyway. The real point was more that the dementors were oddly attracted to Harry. They had some strange pull to him. From what Draco could tell, his parents had their suspicions, but he wasn’t privy to those discussions.
“Hey! I’m totally trustworthy…” Remus watched as his wonderful son and husband argued playfully and smiled. When he first was bitten, he didn’t even know if he could have a family let alone one so incredible as this one. The universe was clearly making up for the huge injustice they did him before. The only word that could be used to describe his emotions in that moment was
“We’re so sorry!” said Sirius despairing, still keeping his voice low. “We shouldn’t have snooped, we were just so worried about you!”
, Harry thought to himself, directing the beam of light at the ground to find the scampering rodent at his feet.
“Yeah, sorry. We didn’t know it was this bad.” said Peter, but James elbowed him silent.
“I am finished.” he whispered.
Harry grasped his shoulder momentarily and they surged forward, trying not to think about whatever the hell they were walking into.
“Yeah. I know.” They spent the rest of the morning in a comfortable silence, only breaking it for brief moments to ask the other to pass something, or to suggest telling Dumbledore. They did, around the middle of the afternoon. Not that it made any difference. There was nothing that any of them could do. Just wait for the storm to arrive.
“I’ll explain it at breakfast, Harry.”
Harry didn’t quite know what he wanted, it had been so hectic, his mind was buzzing. He didn’t know the Weasley family very well at all, and he had been looking forward to spending three weeks with McGonagall, who had since alluded to their having a few Quidditch matches. Still, Hogwarts wasn’t really as magical as it was before, and he could do with a break.
“Maybe not.”
“I’ll go over there, dad.” said Draco quietly. Sirius nodded and stayed in his spot, watching the interaction closely.
a quick recap, just in case you need it since it’s been so long:
“In the class we did tea, so that’s what you have to do.” Harry said simply, as though it explained everything.
“Are you okay?” Draco sat up and faced him, sensing an important conversation was to be had.
“But…” The girl seemed to be struggling to put her thoughts into words, so Harry gave her time. “You like Draco… romantically…?”
“Alright, I will not be letting either of you near a dementor for at least a few weeks yet, so we’re going to have to use our imagination. I want to first repeat the incantation:
“What was that about Zonko’s?” one of them, Fred, Draco thought, asked.
Draco was sitting in Potions when his owl finally returned to him. With Professor Snape’s permission, he took the letter from the bird, gave it a treat and sent it back to the Owlery. The actual note contained little important information, only to keep his nose out of the matter and that Dumbledore probably had a good reason, which didn’t sound like Pads which suggested that Moony had calmed him down. When he returned to his seat, Draco passed the letter to Harry, who let out a huff of indignation that sounded like he was annoyed at the lack of content the letter provided, but the pair turned their attention back to the board and Snape, who had just started assigning them partners from the other house which was, in this case, Gryffindor.
Remus scoffed. “Dark magic? It is clearly enchanted to insult whoever tries to figure out what it is, which is clearly something you would find in Zonko’s. May I remind you that Sirius is the manager of the Hogsmeade branch? Harry probably just got it from there last Hogsmeade weekend. Really, Severus, you’ve got to be joking.”
“How is Harry?” He said innocently.
Sirius stood up shakily and looked her dead in the eye, ignoring the small stinging of impending tears in the corner of his eye.
How Harry was managing to get through his exams was a mystery to everyone. He didn’t study like Hermione and Draco, he didn’t buckle down at the last minute, like Ron. But he was fixated on the mystery of the Philosopher’s Stone. One day, he was struck with an idea and dragged Ron, Hermione and Draco to Hagrid’s hut.
What unnerved him was what unnerved him when he was younger, and what perhaps was unnerving him as he sat in the courtyard on a bench next to Harry, that Moody’s swivelling eye never left their them, and seemed to dart between them sporadically.
Harry too rumpled his brow and peered down at the bottom of the cup, and then consulted his book. “It could be a… oh, Draco, I think you’ve got the Grim too!” he exclaimed, looking closer at his subjects.
“I’m really happy, Draco. Thank you for inviting me here.” Draco could sense that there was more weight in that sentence that he let on, but could also tell that Harry wanted to change the conversation.
gain control of his powers, as would Harry, and life would be carefree, even if it would take defeating a homicidal maniac to do it.
“Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of law-breakers.” Said Fred solemnly.
“My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free…” said Lockhart, as if Dumbledore didn’t know the way around his own school. The pair followed the teachers until they got to the office.
They had it all planned out, they would wait until after dinner on Thursday and would sneak off to the bathroom, where they could interrogate the girl, but it was all interrupted when the magically magnified voice of Minerva McGonagall stopped them in the corridors on the charms.
What was this person waiting for? Draco noticed his edges becoming more defined, more real. Perhaps he was waiting for that, to be a fully fledged person, before taking them on. He was getting the life from Ginny, so what they needed to do was kill him in order to get her back, right? But he was going to put up a fight, and he had a Basilisk on his side. They didn’t stand a chance.
“You’re incredible.” Draco took his eyes off the world for a moment to lock eyes with Harry, who was looking sheepish. “I’m sorry, that came out of nowhere. You just look really pretty - handsome - whatever.” He blushed deeper and Draco’s breath caught in his throat.
“I know, I know, you’ll cut off all my beautiful hair!” Remus smiled as his son barked out a laugh when his wonderful husband lifted the young boy off the floor and buried his face in his neck, breathing in the scent.
“My aunty says that I shouldn’t let other people do things for me” Sirius glanced up at Remus, and down once more to Harry.
“Yeah. Small. Wooden. Clearly it's guarding something.”
Sirius settled down. “You’re right, I’m sorry Moons.”
“So are you but I still think you’re useful to have around.”
Cedric barely missed a crash and was thrown off completely, missing when Harry really saw the Snitch, which was hovering by the tallest goalpost. He set off for it and captured it with ease as the whole of Slytherin screamed in celebration.
“You’re getting your hopes up, Pans. I doubt any of them will look twice at us, we’re too young for them to be interested.” said Blaise.
“I am working at - wait for it - Zonko's!” Their son cackled.
“You know, I have a
“You see?” he whispered. “I am your greatest fear, Harry Potter. I was already using it at Hogwarts, amongst my most intimate friends. I wasn’t going to keep my filthy, muggle father’s name, who hated my mother simply because she was a witch, forever. So I fashioned myself a new name, one that witches and wizards alike would be afraid of saying out loud, for I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.”
“Ron, do you by any chance happen to have the Dumbledore Chocolate Frog card on you?” Draco has always had a flair for the dramatics.
He knew the place like the back of his hand now, after the many,
“Go for it.” said James.
“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?”
“You’re in the Hospital Wing.” All of a sudden, Draco rushed towards him in a blur of blonde and hugged him tightly around the neck, he embraced it and hugged back to the best of his ability.
“I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn’t had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested -” Snape started.
“Remus, I don’t know how much longer I can do this.”
“Yes way, look.” He pointed at the letter which clearly stated that Harry had said something to snake and that it had understood. That it had sounded like hissing.
“I is Dobby, sir. You is Sirius Black, sir?” Draco’s father rolled his eyes.
The pair stopped when they reached the end of the tunnel and marvelled at the spectacle before them. The wall was engraved with two snakes, intertwined, each having an emerald glinting as it’s eye.
Draco was stunned. He locked eyes with Harry, who looked like the culmination of all of his hopes and dreams had manifested in a moment, and smiled.
Once Harry had arrived and was set up on a spare mattress in Draco’s room, which Remus knew would probably be little used, the little boy avoided the snow like the plague. It had fallen quite a bit this year, to Draco extreme delight, he loved the snow, so did Sirius, who had a childlike glee for the stuff. They were playing in the garden for what seemed like hours before Sirius thundered in, eyes gaunt and stormy.
“I’ve been thinking about the first time I got on a broom.”
“Draco, I would love that. Are you sure that's okay?” Draco grinned.
“Harry, do you know who my parents are?”
Draco, in turn, was thrilled with his gift from Harry, too. It was a small Muggle instrument. A harm-on-ee-car, Harry had said. It was pocket sized and rectangular with an engraving on the side of the ‘Draco’ constellation. When Harry demonstrated how to use it, it created a lovely, warm sound that touched something inside of Draco. It took him a little while to get the hang of it, but soon he could play tunes. It came in a velvet box, in which Draco stored it with meticulous care whenever he wasn’t playing with it or admiring the engraving.
“Who is he most excited to see? Or have you already seen them?” Blaise quickly glanced at Draco and gave Harry a pointed look.
This tree was one of the things he was going to miss when he went back to school, although he was endlessly pleased that his father wasn’t going to be one of them this year.
Harry rubbed his eyes and fixed them on the tiny footprints of the man presumed dead. “How do you explain it then?”
“We’ll miss the train! And how are your parents going to get back?”
"Alright, are you sure you have everything?" Remus asked, ever the mother hen. "If you've forgotten something, just owl and I'll drop it up to the school."
“You’ll do this even if I don’t come with you, won’t you?” Grinning, Harry nodded. “Fine. Lets go.” The pair shucked off their robes when Draco pointed out that if anyone sees a flash of green they’ll immediately send them to the dungeons, and climbed the stairs to the girls toilets. On the way there, however, they saw a flurry of black robes billowing. Snape was headed towards the third floor.
“I’m going to be the knight.” The game progressed slowly but it seemed that Ron had a handle on things. Draco had to hand it to him, that kind of forward thinking was a surprisingly Slytherin trait and it was admirable. Soon enough, Ron had to make the decision to be sacrificed. In spite of himself, Draco was worried. He had seen what the other side did to pieces that were captured, and he didn’t want anyone getting injured or dying on this trip. Ron made the command and was, sure enough, tossed to the ground. Hermione shrieked but stayed on her spot. The injured boy told Harry what he needed to do, and Harry complied. The next move was made. Harry now only needed to move into the spot that would ensure them the win. Once he did, the King tossed the crown off of his head. They had won.
“Don’t you want to say goodbye?”
“You could do
btw romione is still very much on the table, i'm just going to have some fun with hermione because i love her and i want to
“Hagrid has a dragon egg.”
“Why are we calling Aurors?” said Sirius. “We can handle this on our own!”
“Okay, so are you guys going to spend hours in the library now? Looking for information on this man?” Harry gave Draco a pleading look.
“Very good. Emotional significance, genuine emotion…” He carried on his head bobbing as his eyebrows furrowed. “I wonder why it isn’t working, have you tried other memories?”
and Moony came calmly through the fire and into the room.
Life didn’t need to explain this to him. He was happy in the unknown.
“Arrested?” Harry whispered, but Draco shushed him.
“Hello, my name is Draco, what’s yours?”
“Mr Potter, how are you?” Her voice was warm and had a comforting edge in the Scottish lilt.
WARNING! Slight discussion of something that could perhaps be an eating disorder so please avoid if you feel like you could be triggered by that! This is something that I will probably discuss more of later, maybe not in this specific work, but I'm only mentioning it a little in this one.
“Detention after school. Tonight. Eight o’clock, don’t be late. You’re lucky I don’t give you more.” Everyone in the room was vaguely aware that Draco had gotten off easy because the Slytherin team needed a decent Chaser, and didn’t bother saying it. It was sad that Draco didn’t seem to have a parental figure nobody had anything to say about.
” He cried, hysterically.
“Yeah.” They shook themselves after a few moments of pause and downed their drinks. With one last meaningful look, Draco exited through the purple flames, and prayed to whatever God was out there, that Harry would be okay.
The first three weeks of Summer were dreadful for Harry. Vernon was on edge the whole time, terrified of Harry’s newfound powers and the big ‘M’ word which had caused quite a stir at breakfast once. And it was only because Harry had used it to try and get Dudley to have some decent manners and say the big ‘P’ word. Still, it would all be over soon for in only a few minutes, Sirius would be arriving to pick him up for three weeks of summer fun, and Harry couldn’t be more excited. He didn’t know how Sirius would arrive, dramatically probably. In his letters, he repeated the promise that he would place a curse on Vernon the second he arrived, one that would probably involve diarrhoea or excessive BO. Or at least that was what he said, his tone when he promised this to Harry at Kings Cross was deadly. If Hagrid could give Dudley a tail, God knows what Sirius could do.
“Fine, you go with Moons.” The trio walked to the nearest apparition point in their neighbourhood and departed, instantly finding themselves outside King’s Cross station, in an area that had been warded enough to allow them to slip into the crowd until they found the platforms nine and ten, and between them, stood a young boy with unruly black hair, broken glasses, and a scar running down the centre of his forehead, in the shape of a lightning bolt.
“Then we run.” Draco sighed.
Thankfully, he didn’t have to, as James began with a confident voice. “Ladies and gentlemen. We are gathered here today, under the sight of Merlin himself-” There came a low chuckle from the crowd. “-to unite these two persons in matrimony. Unfortunately, due to marriage laws in the muggle world, this ceremony could now be muggle, like the grooms wanted. However, my creativity and wit has devised a speech which similarly resembles that one, but has made a few important changes. But first, I would like to say a few words about my two best friends.” He cleared his throat for dramatic effect. “Remus John Lupin and Sirius Orion Black, are the two of the kindest, bravest, and most wonderful men I know, and I take it as the greatest honour that they chose me to officiate this ceremony. Now more than ever, we must take joy where we can find it. In the arms of our loved ones, in the comfort of our hopes and dreams, and in the happiness of others. Which is why this union is a most special one. Not only are Remus and Sirius made for each other, they are symbols of hope for all of us. There is a light at the end of this long tunnel, and we will get there if we keep holding on to each other.”
“Well, it's his fault.”
’. And it’ll go blank.” Harry nodded, thanking the boy’s genuinely and shaking their hands. He dismissed the ‘thank yous’ the twins made again for what he did for Ginny, and he told them what he told everyone. That he would’ve done it for anyone.
Remus couldn’t breath. His throat had constricted and he physically could not move. A warm hand on his shoulder and the soothing voice of Sirius telling him to breathe was helping minutely, but his brain was still on overdrive.
“I know you can read, Mr Malfoy, what. Does. It. Say?”
Harry loved Draco’s room. It was so personal. The walls were covered in posters of obscure bands and movies, mostly Muggle, surprisingly, and photographs. Once, Harry woke up from a nightmare in Draco’s room and had spent three hours inspecting each picture.
“How’re you doing, star?” Pads asked. “I feel like we haven’t gotten a chance to talk alone much, what with Christmas and everything.”
“This is going to be so much fun!”
Still, Draco seemed to have brushed the whole thing off in favour of his studies. Or perhaps in favour of the new Defense teacher,
“Go on then!” Hagrid roared. He slapped the hippogriff’s behind and it took off, soaring into the air gracefully.
He clapped his hands decidedly and smiled as brightly as he could. “Let's get started then, shall we?”
“Give it to me, then. And if you don’t mind, Severus, I will figure out a way to punish him fairly, seeing as you seem to be rather tired.” said Remus. Snape looked as though he could blow something up, but stayed silent as he reluctantly handed the map over to the other Professor.
“Nobody? Noone knows the difference between a werewolf and an animagus?” he sneered, watching them all with glinting eyes. “Not even you, Draco? I would have thought out of all people, you would know.”
The greaseball plucked the map from Harry’s stunned hands and examined it with suspicion. “May I ask why you are wandering the halls at night? When you are supposed to be in bed?”
Draco was then dragged up and towards Sirius, who then apparated them home.
PoA is over!! Oh my lord this has taken it out of me. GoF is going to be epic, if everything goes according to plan. Thanks for sticking with it, I know I've been a little off it lately.
No. Draco thought the thing was adorable and fluffy. It was ridiculous. It looked like it had taken a wrong turn and walked into a wall, not ‘adorable and fluffy’ at all.
“Come on, Draco, you can tell me.” Lucius jeered.
“Are you okay, Harry?” Draco whispered, even though he knew that the figure could hear them. At Harry’s name, the shadow-man stood up and loomed towards them. Draco shrieked and ran, sensing that the best thing he could do was find Hagrid to tell him what was happening. When he found him, the man looked more scared of him than of the story of the mysterious figure, but followed him nonetheless. They didn’t need to go far, though, because Harry was delivered to them on the back of a man with a horse’s body. “Harry!” Draco rushed forward and embraced him as he dismounted the centaur. “Are you okay?”
“Large, rusty, probably.” said Hermione as she inspected the lock. Ron and Harry had already collected a broom of their own and were in the air, Draco followed them, keeping an eye out for the key. It was Harry who found it first and returned to the ground gracefully. That boy was a natural flier, and Seeker. Draco knew that Harry would be on the Quidditch team in second year, he didn’t mind. It stung a little at first but he wouldn’t have wanted to be a Seeker anyway.
“Holy Hippogriff, what do these balls have against me?”
Draco kneeled next to his friend and put his hand on his shoulder. “Harry, I don’t want you to freak out, and I’m sorry we have to cut our visit short, but we think we might have seen Lucius nearby. Moony has gone to check but he reckons we should go home, you can have another minute though, okay?” He took a breath to calm his pounding heart. Honestly, it was all getting a bit much for him. In the previous years, most of the important stuff seemed to be happening to Harry, rather than to him. For some reason, Merlin decided that third year was the time when his murderer ex-Death Eater father should escape from Azkaban and he should be forced to face his worst fear and apparently greatest desire once more. Not only whatever the hell was going on with the method of murder he used in the mirror and boggart.
“I cannot be telling yous. I is not meant to be here.” The elf then tried to start hitting his head against the desk then, by Sirius grabbed him by the collar and hoisted him up again.
Quick warning for the next chapter: I'm not a huge fan of Snape. Neither is Draco lol.
“Yes, we were all very good friends. My name is Remus, this is my husband Sirius, and this is Draco, our son.” Draco held out his hand sheepishly and James’s ghost shook it with unnecessary force before withdrawing it abruptly. Remus recognized a look in his son’s eyes that appeared whenever he was enraptured by something, it almost made him smirk. “Would you like some help getting onto the platform?”
Are you guys dressing up for Halloween? What are you doing?
“I would love to, thank you!” The two embraced and Sirius felt a strange sort of relief. As though he was saving the boy from an unnameable evil.
“Where did you get it?” he pressed. When Harry wouldn’t answer, however, he receded. “What were you looking for? Lucius?”
“I don’t want you to get hurt!”
“I don’t understand why he’s looking at
Draco hurriedly flipped to page three to finish the article but, before he could, another owl landed in front of him, their family owl, Eddie. He held in his talon a rolled up piece of parchment. Draco untied it, almost ignoring Harry’s inquiries over his wellbeing. Unable to find words, he shoved the newspaper over to him, hoping he understood. The parchment, however, read;
Hermione gasped as her eyes fixed on a butterfly a little closer to the ground, although it wasn’t a butterfly. As Draco got closer, he could see that it was actually a key with wings, glinting in the limited light.
Harry noticed a box of matches near his foot and got an idea. He took one out of the box and lit it, before holding it up to the palm of his hand. Still, nothing happened.
Harry turned to him. “What could it be?”
“Harry?” Draco rushed up the stairs and into his room, expecting to find Harry staring down a particularly large spider, not a house elf. “Harry, what’s a house elf doing in here?”
It took him a while to get used to the rabid Gryffindor-ness of it all, but after a bit he realised that Percy, Fred and George should have probably been in Slytherin, with their ambition and cunning, and that the Sorting Hat took over five minutes to sort Professor McGonagall because she was equally a Gryffindor and a Ravenclaw, and that Arthur Weasley had a lot of Hufflepuff traits, so overall it wasn’t that bad.
“Yes.” The creature wasn’t particularly friendly, Harry noted, but chose to ignore it in favour of Draco’s face, which was the picture of unexpected, unadulterated joy. “I will sing it now.”
The man conjured a dark oak round table, big enough for the people present, and four chairs around it. Each party got themselves settled.
“I, Remus John Lupin.”
Hello! How are you guys?
James smirked and gave him a knowing look. “Oh, as if you wouldn’t do the same thing.”
“What the hell.” it came out as more of a statement than a question. Harry had the decency to look sheepish.
“I know.”
One specific report, Rita Skeeter, had it in for Draco. She repeatedly brought up his lineage, Remus’ lycanthropy, and called his powers unnatural and dangerous. She claimed that Harry was being brainwashed by Draco and his family to one day team up with You-Know-Who.
“What the hell did you do, Professor?”
.” he chanted, producing a long stream of surprisingly bright silver light. Remus was astonished, although he shouldn’t have been, his son was destined to be a very powerful wizard.
“I’m not dead. I’m right here.” The other boy finally pulled away and looked down on him with wet eyes.
So happy you guys enjoyed the first chapter!! <3
The Hogsmeade house was bought, moved into, and warded by the time that school started, and Draco was feeling surprisingly light. What had started off looking like an exceedingly bleak year was turning around.
Pansy bit her lip and heaved her cat onto her lap, stroking it absentmindedly. “My mum says that’s wrong.”
The blond grimaced and looked down to see ‘XXX’ in bold letters next to the words ‘Highly Dangerous - Avoid at all costs’. He didn’t say anything.
“I don’t care, I will not end up like this. EVER!”
“When I got sorted, did you notice how nobody cheered and clapped for me, like they did the other kids, except you?” Draco had noticed.
“Open it, open it!” he squealed, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet, the way he did when he was really happy.
Draco lightly surveyed him as though he had grown a second head before laughing awkwardly and trying to shake the moment off.
And it wasn’t even because of this stupidly boring lecture he was enduring - although, under normal circumstances, he would be fighting off the waves of sleep all the same. There was something about a tough transformation that made everything else in life seem utterly pointless. When the full moon rolled around, there just wasn’t any room in his head for Warlock Conventions or Assemblies of European Wizards, all he thought about was blood and ripping things and generally being much more wolf than human.
“We matched up the days you left to the dates of the full moon, we looked up werewolves in the restricted section, and we came here today just to check on you, we hadn’t meant to scare you or let you know that we knew anything, we’re sorry.” he rambled, eyes fixed on the ground. It was so strange, James never looked guilty.
“My uncle used to say that too, but I don’t think it’s true. I don’t really see what the problem is with it, to be honest.”
“Mr and Mr Lupin-Black, I hear you have been looking for me.” Sirius’s head rose and he heaved with barely repressed rage. He turned around to face Dumbledore with a look of thunder that would have turned anyone to stone.
By the time he decided to turn in, it was 11:00. He yawned widely and sorted the books back onto the shelves, putting a temporary silencing charm on them so they made as little noise as possible. He put the same charm on his feet, and made his way back to Slytherin. Distracted by thoughts of a warm, inviting bed, Draco almost didn’t notice Harry’s head, plunged into the centre of a diary. But on the double take, it hit him how utterly ridiculous the sight should be. He stomped over to Harry’s side and yanked his head back out again, only to find the other boy looking dazed and irritated at his time inside the book being cut short.
“I suppose, but does that help in any way?”
“... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right on top of my head.” She gestured to a small, leather diary on the floor, drenched in toilet water. Harry moved to pick it up but Draco stopped him.
“Yes, you are.” Snape pointed his wand at the map. “
It was actually going pretty well. They decided to follow the railway track that the Hogwarts Express would be running on from a distance. It was difficult to talk, but Draco welcomed the peace. Being with Harry was usually so chaotic, he liked the fact that they were comfortable enough with each other that they didn’t need to constantly be talking. That silence could be comfortable rather than uncomfortable.
“Moony, could I please speak with him alone?” Draco asked.
“Dobby used to work for Malfoy family.”
“I don't think we can be."
“It’s okay, Ginny!” Harry was trying to be really nice to the girl because he had a strong suspicion that it was she who wrote the song. “It was my fault, I wasn’t looking!” She blushed as red as her hair and rushed off murmuring something about being late. “Okay! Bye then!”
November passed in a hazy blur of lessons and homework, only split up by the time Harry and Draco spent with each other, and occasionally Ron and Hermione. The weather was bitterly cold but everyone was gearing up for the next Quidditch match, Griffindor vs. Slytherin. Harry and Draco were, in particular, very excited because Draco had apparently been riding on brooms since he was very young, and Harry was fascinated by the idea. Riding a broom in his first flying lesson was the most exhilarating feeling he had ever experienced, and the pair had made a pact to try out together in 2nd Year. According to Draco, Sirius was a Beater, while Harry’s father was a Chaser. Harry wasn’t 100% sure that he knew what these positions were, but he was excited to learn.
Thank you for all your kind comments, though, they meant a lot <3<3
“I-what-you just… huh?” Draco stumbled incredulously.
Remus, Sirius, Harry and Draco were all standing at King Cross station, bags in hand, ready to pass through the wall to platform 9¾ on the 1st of September. Remus passed through the wall with Sirius and their luggage, leaving Harry and Draco to charge after them.
“Let’s go to class.”
Nobody spoke for a really long time. Nobody was going to defend Dumbledore, not even Dumbledore himself. Remus couldn’t see anything good in him anymore. He was no longer the twinkle-eyed headmaster who made his childhood so magical, no longer the man who helped him and didn’t shun him for his disease. Nothing could excuse his actions, Remus didn’t even want to try. Finally, he broke the silence, an edge to his voice that he used but rarely.
“I love you, Harry.”
Harry glared at the pair menacingly. “What about the Boy Who Lived?”
A good crowd of students had gathered to watch this scene and Draco nudged Harry in the ribs. “‘The hell did he do?” he said through gritted teeth.
You guys!! We're nearing the end, I have so many ideas for PoA! When that comes out, I might start doing uploads every other day, idk we'll see!
“HARRY, WHAT THE HELL?” Draco was screaming at him. The troll was howling in pain and swinging his bat around with dangerous force. But, just when Harry felt that he was about to be smacked in the head with the club, it stilled and Harry looked up to find the club precariously floating above its head, steadily getting higher. Harry looked down to see Draco holding his wand aloft with grim determination, before releasing the spell, allowing the club to fall and land with a clunk on the troll’s head, knocking it out.
“What does it say?”
“No. Stay. You’re warm.” Harry blushed and nodded, maneuvering their bodies until they were both horizontal and under the covers. They weren’t pressed up as close as they were before, but Harry could still feel the heat of Draco’s body. And it helped that their fingers were still lightly tangled. As sleep drowned them, Harry heard Draco mumble a ‘Goodnight, Harry’. To which he replied,
Suddenly, Harry’s eyes caught on something, and he sped forward, hurtling towards the ground.
Ginny wasn’t bad at all once you got to know her, she was actually really cool, once she had stopped blushing and thanking him profusely, and an amazing Chaser.
Draco surged forward for a hug, catching the grown man mid-sentence. Remus hugged back with ferocity. Over Remus' shoulder, Draco could see the terrified glances of his fellow students and the words of disdain and fear forming on their lips as their turned to their friends and gestured to him. It was as though he was an exhibit in a museum, they didn't even care if he saw.
“You alright now, Pads?” James asked.
“Don’t be annoying.” Pansy giggled. “They can’t hear you.”
“Are you kidding? You could cook a goose in here, no way!” They continued the back and forth for a while before Draco finally acquiesced, allowing Harry to light the fire, instead opting to practise his cooling charms. Once Harry did, he waited for a few minutes for the heart to kick in, but it didn’t. “Harryyyyyyy… it’s so hot!”
Please keep me entertained! I love seeing the little notification that comes up on my phone when I've got a new comment xxx
Since I enjoy hearing from you guys, I'm gonna ask another question, simply because it is fun. I really like getting that inbox notification and its someone telling me what their animagus would be or what house they're in - its surprisingly interesting!
For Harry, Draco, with help from Remus, had charmed a Muggle book of constellations so that the dots glowed and twinkled like real stars
“No. That wrinkled grape must be lying to you. There is no way.” Harry was baffled, perhaps Draco wasn’t honest about what he had seen either.
FINAL CHAPTER!! Thank you so much for reading the first book! I have really enjoyed writing this and I'm really excited about the future of it. Thank you for all the love, kudos, comments literally anything it all makes me so happy! I hope you enjoy this final chapter, I will probably be posting the first chapter of CoS soon, maybe even tomorrow if I feel like it, for now please just enjoy a little bit of Dumbledore bashing and some cute feels! Yay!!!
“OH, CLEARLY!” Both of their throats were getting sore, but Draco continued, fuelled only by rage. “LET’S REVIEW: YOU PICKED UP A RANDOM BOOK OFF OF THE FLOOR OF THE GIRLS TOILETS AND NOW YOU TRUST IT’S OPINION?”
"Draco! Harry!" it said. He looked up to see Ron, Hermione, Fred and George, Ginny, Luna and Neville shoving their way past luggage and people to get to their group.
“Everything in this world is.”
“How about I talk first, Draco, would you like that?” His father’s voice was so icy, so persuasive, it reminded him of his own. The now greasy, silver hair was the exact shade of his own, the nose, the mouth, almost everything on the face, besides the eyes, which weren’t as silvery as his own, more flat and lifeless, but that could be down to the dementors more than anything else.
“Ooh come off it, Moony, WELL DONE KIDDO! YOU DEFEATED A TROLL, THAT'S EPIC!”
Still, he nodded stiffly.
times he had to come in and issue a verbal beating to the old wizard for countless things. It was relieving to know that it wasn’t exactly Dumbledore’s fault this time.
“It’s like, I know
He sailed around the field, keeping high in the air but never staying in one spot too long, until he finally saw the Snitch, the real one this time. It was nearer the ground, but just seemed to be hovering in the middle of the pitch. He raced towards it, all the while being pitifully followed by the Gryffindor Seeker, Mclaggen, and the bludger. But, just as he closed his hands around the cool metal, the ball finally caught up with him and jammed into his arm. He fell off his broom, only falling about two metres, and landed in a head on the floor.
“So talk.”
Harry woke up and they talked until Draco was forcibly removed by his dads, who needed time to talk to him about the new safety measures they were working on, so that he wouldn’t have to come into contact with any more dementors, and so that he could get some sleep. But how could he sleep without Harry in the bed next to him?
“Dobby, sir. You is Draco Malfoy, is you not, sir?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“SORRY?” He cried, sounding slightly hysterical. “Didn’t it cross your mind for a moment there that fire hurts when you touch it?”
The only noises left now in the Chamber, was the heavy breathing of the two boys, the steady drip of excess ink falling to the ground, and a faint moan coming from the direction of Ginny, as she stirred.
“Nonsense, Draco, this is an adventure.” Harry was sitting in the sidecar instead, goggles on, looking like some kind of crazed person on a mission.
Second to last chapter!! You excited for PoA?
“Stupid thing.” he grunted as he hit his wand repeatedly against the palm of his hand.
Harry pondered this for a moment, but it didn’t take long for him to realise where he was going wrong. In seconds, he was on his feet again and Remus was standing guard at the door of the cabinet.
However, Harry still waited until the other boy had gone to bed before he investigated further. He started edging his hand closer to the flames before he was a hair width away from them, still feeling as cold as he did before. He took a deep breath, and plunged his hand in, preparing himself for searing pain. It didn’t come, though. Instead, it just felt like the flames he walked through the previous year just before his fight with Quirrell, tickly and pleasant. They were warm, but not hot, and his skin didn’t seem to be reacting to them at all. He pulled his fingers out and inspected them, only to find them devoid of any defect that would suggest previous exposure to fire.
“I remember.”
Harry’s face was lit up beautifully by the spell when he opened the book with awe and reverence.
Harry shook his head. “I think it’ll be a dementor.”
“Look, sir, time is of the essence here, of which I am sure you are well aware, so we would appreciate it if you would just follow us down the hallway, please and thank you.” With that, the boy turned on his heel and strutted out of the classroom, leaving Harry, who was gazing at him adoringly, with Lockhart, who looked absolutely gobsmacked.
“Ah.” said Remus. “Your father’s was a stag, and your mother’s was a doe. I think their Patronuses were connected somehow.”
“I want to talk to you, Draco, because we haven’t really mentioned it since the beginning of term, about well… I think you know. I just want to make sure that you are okay.” Draco stilled slightly before his eyes softened.
“Yeah… yeah, I’m fine.”
“Draco…?” There came a hollow whisper from the corner where the man lay and he crawled painfully slowly to the division. Between them was only a magically enchanted barrier, impenetrable but completely translucent. Draco could see every wrinkle, every fragment, every eyelash, and they all felt like an aged mirror.
“Hey.” he whispered to it. “Hungry, are you?” He gathered some crumbles into a small pile and set them up in front of him. “Come ‘ere.”
“Minerva, I’m sure that the students will understand how dangerous they are if we explain it to them!” said Dumbledore urgently, attempting to soothe her.
The plan took place during Transfiguration, when one of the dwarves entered the classroom and cleared his throat.
He bit his lip and sat back in his chair, face flushed with irritation. His bespectacled friend nudged his shoulder and quietly asked if he was okay. He nodded.
“A riddle! Amazing, I love riddles!” He dissected it as Harry watched calculatingly. Honestly, the security for the whole place was pretty lax. If a group of first years could crack it, no wonder an adult with a full magical education could. The riddle in and of itself was pretty basic, the answer was clear to him in minutes. He passed a small vial to Harry.
“What do we do now?” Draco whispered, but Harry already knew. And he didn’t have to pretend the snakes were real this time, either, something about their bejeweled eyes seemed alive.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You sure?”
Harry spent Easter at the Lupin-Black’s and it was incredible. He and Draco had an egg hunt in the garden and stayed up all night talking. Seeing as Harry was now keeping up a correspondence with Sirius, he felt even more at home there than he did before. But, the bliss had to come to an end and Harry and Draco returned to Hogwarts with the most incredible chocolate stashes and exams on their minds.
When he was finished, Harry had to admit, he was slightly turned on, but it didn’t matter, because Draco lay limp against a tree, coated in frost. Tears were streaming down his face but he seemed unaware of them.
Finally, he could turn his attention to the beautiful man in front of him.
But, Draco avoided his gaze for a week after that conversation, seemingly terrified to catch his eye. Harry had tried, he even downright took Draco’s face in his hands and pointed it to him, missing the molten gray he loved so very much. But the boy was still stubborn. Even Ron had noticed, he pulled Harry aside after he and Draco had filled the Gryffindors in on their most recent knowledge (Hermione had actually drooled at the sight of Harry’s book, it was rather funny).
, he thought. He didn’t know quite how to convey to Sirius that it wasn’t the case, and he didn’t have to, James came to his rescue.
“Keep my voice down? He turned me into a ferret and smashed me into the ground! I’m pretty sure I have bruises!” Draco could feel the ice thrumming through his fingertips, itching to be used against Moody. He could just picture what he would do as revenge but his thoughts were interrupted by McGonagall and Harry each taking an arm and dragging him out of the way.
He felt an urgent pat on his shoulder from Peter, who seemed to be paying attention more than usual.
“A dangerous wolf, yes?”
“Which one would you get though?” asked Sirius at the same time as Remus said. “You are not getting a tattoo.”
“There isn’t enough for both of us!”
“Go on, you two. I’ll take Ron back to the hospital wing.” She looked solemn but gave her parting goodbyes to both of them, wishing them luck, and helped Ron onto a broomstick. They flew out of the room leaving only Harry, Draco and a door.
.” Sirius suggested.
“I was going to keep it here. You must understand, Harry, that this place is even safer than Gringotts.”
“I love it.” he whispered. “Thank you.”
“I know you’re not used to people caring about your life, but don’t die on me, Harry. I couldn’t handle it.”
“Stop getting angry, you need to be calm for the spell to work.” Remus soothed.
“I’m sorry, son, we were just friends with your parents, James and Lily?” Remus offered, Sirius still seemed to be recovering from the shock of seeing the ghost of his best friend.
Harry didn’t expect any thanks for saving Ginny’s life, truly, it wasn’t something he had done to win back the good graces of the Weasley family. He did it merely out of his own stubborn hero complex.
“But they don’t know that.”
Sirius did actually find a boggart in one of the upstairs cabinets and brought it to Hogwarts, following Remus’s instruction and putting it in one of the unused classrooms, so that Harry and Remus could practice. Draco refused to attend on the principle that the vision would be too much for him if he had to suffer it again, but that was okay. Harry felt sure that his friend would produce a Patronus in no time.
PS what are your guys' Hogwarts Houses, no reason I just want to know honestly. (I'm a Slytherin 😊)
“Oh no.”
Said meeting went on for a while. It was mostly filled with arguing, a chair or two was broken, but there came a dip in the conversation when they started talking about what exactly happened.
