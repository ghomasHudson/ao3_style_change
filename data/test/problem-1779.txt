"Potter. Potter, stop," he mumbled, batting his free hand against the dark-haired man's chest as he tried to pull away.
Dead-eyed, sallow skinned, he trudged through the halls of Hogwarts like the ghost of a forgotten world. That's what he was, in a way
"I...You-you should get some rest," he muttered at last. Draco shivered, watching helplessly as the other man turned on his heel and padded out of the room, shutting the door behind him with a quiet
Draco - it was hard to think of him as Malfoy now, given that he was sitting in Harry's bed - looked at the clothes in surprise, and then up at him, before tentatively taking them from the darker boy's hand. "Thanks," he mumbled, and Harry shrugged.
Harry inhaled sharply, muscles tensing where he touched the other boy. He'd never been this close to Malfoy before. They were so close, in fact, that each inhale of his brought Malfoy's light, citrusy scent wafting through his lungs, filling his head with a light, heady sensation. Wait...was he
It was during one such trek a few days later that his body finally seemed to decide it'd had enough—a sudden dizzy spell on his way to Herbology had him sagging against the wall of some obscure part of the castle before slowly slumping to the ground, upon which his quivering limbs refused to do anything other than curl into a tight ball. He knew, on some level, that he should probably be concerned for his health, or at the very least the classes he was missing, but he couldn't really bring himself to care. He sighed, thankful at least that some of his other symptoms had backed off a bit since the whole Potter incident.
So when a particularly nasty hex from a Seventh Year Ravenclaw girl nearly bowled him over in the hallway one sunny October morning, he wasn't all that surprised, nor was he when he nearly puked all over the bed that evening from the blinding headache in his skull. He figured it was probably some sort of migraine hex, but when he woke up the following morning and his previous symptoms were joined by stuffed sinuses and a strange, burning ache in his lungs, he realized it was perhaps something else entirely.
The Slytherin settled back against the headboard, eyes darting away as he shrugged off his outer robes and tie, folding them neatly and placing them at the foot of the bed with a carefully blank expression. Harry walked over to the wooden dresser at the side of the room, grabbing a faded red t-shirt and some sweatpants and holding them out to Malfoy.
So lost in his fever-induced haze, he didn't even notice a tall, dark form peel away from the shadows of the one of the alcoves he passed until he was being being slammed back against the wall of the passage, head cracking painfully on the cold stones as he stared into the enraged face of one green-eyed Saviour.
They stayed like that for a long moment, the only sounds being their quiet breathing and the occasional sniffle from the blonde. Finally, Potter cleared his throat a little awkwardly and disentangled his hand from Draco's. The warm magic flowing through the Slytherin's chest began to dissipate as well, and he bit his lip against a disappointed whine.
A hand wrapped around his wrist, and he shrieked, burying his head against his knees as terrified sobs began to pour from him, vicious shudders wracking his body as memories of white-hot pain flashed through his mind. It was supposed to be over. The pain was supposed to be over. The Dark Lord was dead. He was gone. Why couldn't it be over?
"I..." He didn't know where to start. "I need to go," he blurted, scuttling down towards the edge of the bed. Potter moved to help him stand, but the blonde boy batted him away.
? The Death Eater? Childhood nemesis of seven years? It didn't make any sense. The Slytherin felt the beginnings of another headache start up behind his eyes, and had half a mind to wonder if this was all some sick joke set up by the Gryffindor and his cronies.
of all people only made it more confusing. A strangled whine escaped the back of the blonde's throat, and he curled into himself, tucking his head against his knees as silent sobs began to shake his frame.
, he thinks, and himself along with them. He liked to pretend that he wasn't a part of those terrible people, a part of the things they'd done, and the beliefs they held, but the mark on his arm proved otherwise. He, and the rest of the Wizarding World, would never forget that.
The panic attacks had come as a bit of a surprise, if he was honest. After all, he'd managed to go an entire year with
The raven offered an apologetic smile. "Sorry. I should have thought about how you might react to waking up in a unfamiliar place."
It'd now been well over four hours since they first got to Harry's rooms, and the Slytherin had yet to do anything other than roll over on the bed and mumble incoherently in his sleep. He was doing that now, actually - little distressed whimpers that drove Harry mad with concern. He'd done everything he could to ease the other boy, short of dumping an entire bottle of Dreamless Sleep down his throat (he needed those potions for himself, anyway), but to no avail.
Potter was at his side in an instant, strong hands keeping him from crashing face-first to the floor as the taller boy shifted to keep their balance. They ended up standing chest-to-chest with Potter's hands clasped firmly around Draco's forearms, holding him up as he peered down at him.
Instead, though, the blonde noted a gentle coolness begin to spread through his head, filling the space behind his eyes and dulling the ache that resided there. Draco released a shuddering breath of relief, tension seeping from his shoulders as another hand came up to gently knead at his temple. He unconsciously leaned into the touch, grey eyes blinking open to find a pair of emerald orbs peering worriedly into his.
exactly he was helping and leave Draco to drown in the aftermath of his mistakes. To his continued shock, though, Potter just began swiping a gentle thumb back and forth across the Slytherin's cheekbone, green eyes open and searching and so different from anything Draco was used to seeing that it made his head spin all over again.
Draco cracked one silver eye open to glare at him. "I would think," he muttered, "that's fairly obvious at this point, Potter." He'd been aiming for a tone of bitter annoyance, but instead ended up sounding just plain exhausted. Sighing, he closed his eyes again and continued focusing on his breathing.
uncomfortable situation. A cruel, scheming, hiding-Dark-artifacts-in-the-castle Malfoy, he knew how to deal with. But a sick, vulnerable Malfoy? Merlin.
The Slytherin didn't know how long he sat there, carefully measuring each inhale and exhale, but it could have been seconds or hours later that he felt a cool, firm touch suddenly press against his forehead. The Draco's eyes flew open, measured breaths forgotten as he took in the tall, blurred figure crouched before him in hallway, one hand reaching out to lightly trace the crease between the blonde's eyebrows. He flinched back with a strangled cry, eyes clenching shut reflexively the stranger whispered an unfamiliar spell, and braced himself for the onslaught of agony that was sure to follow.
The taller man stilled in his ministrations, jaw tensing at Draco's words. Perhaps he was about to curse Draco for being pathetic enough to allow something like a fever to stop him from serving his legal sentence. Or worse, perhaps he just couldn't take the reminder of who Draco was, of what he'd done, and was about to abandon him there in the dingy corridor floor. The blonde whimpered at the thought, turning away as shivers began to wrack his body again. He didn't even realize he was crying until a single, hot tear slipped down his cheek, pooling in the dip between Potter's thumb and forefinger. It was quickly followed by another, and another, and then soon enough there were two steady rivulets running down the sides of his face as shame burned through his body.
The last thing he expected was for Potter to make a small, startled sound in the back of his throat, moving his hands to cup both sides of Draco's face and tilting it back towards him. Callused thumbs swiped slowly across the tear tracks on his cheeks, and Draco choked back a sob at the gentleness of the action. It'd been so long since someone had touched him like this, like they cared about him, and the fact that it was
He watched, bemused, as Potter's lips slowly twitched up into a smirk. "You sneeze like a kitten, Malfoy," he murmured, and if
Thankfully, it was late enough that no one was there to witness as Harry Potter dragged a half-conscious Draco Malfoy across the common room and down the hallway for the male dorms. Draco's room was all the way at the end, made invisible by a strong series of disillusionment spells (he'd had to do that bit himself, of course; not like the school would actually be
Speaking of, he'd just barely left the library to stumble towards the Eigth Year dorms (why did they have to put them so bloody far away?!) before a blinding whorl of light came soaring his way and crashed forcefully against his shields. He grunted, feeling the bubble of protective spells flicker, and quickly spun on his heel to head in the opposite direction.
Malfoy's head jerked up, brow creasing in bemusement as though wondering why the other boy was still there, before settling back into his usual cold sneer. "You think I haven't already tried that, you dolt?" he snapped. "The old bat doesn't give a flying fuck whether I live or die. No one does." The last bit was said quieter, smaller, and Harry doubted he was meant to hear it.
Potter sighed. "Look, Malfoy, I'm not forcing you to stay here. You're free to go if you really want. But you really aren't well, Draco. I wish you would just let me help you."
"I'll just, uh..." The raven pointed towards the door, and then quickly scurried away without another word, shutting the door behind him.
Something in Draco's chest deflated at the words, and he nodded, eyes falling back to the sheets. Potter cleared his throat awkwardly, turning to leave, and something in Draco panicked. Before he even realized what he was doing, he had reached out to grasp Potter's sleeve, yanking the other man around to face him.
He was fairly certain he had a fever, given the fuzzy, disconnected feeling of everything, and the strange ache in his chest made itself known through vicious coughing fits at least once an hour. He'd had to excuse himself from class several times to hack his lungs out in the bathroom (thank Merlin for Silencing Charms), and was fairly certain that he'd passed out for a few moment after the second fit. He couldn't really be sure, though.
The Ministry insisted on his return here for the first months of his parole, likely hoping the students would be kind enough to take his Death Eater arse off their hands. So far, none had managed to permanently maim him, but the constant stream of Stinging Hexes being flung his way served as an excellent reminder of just how many people were out to get him. He couldn't blame them, though.
Draco, growing tired of Potter's awkward shuffles, lifted his hands to make a shooing motion at the other boy. "Go on, now, Oh Mighty Savior," he drawled, barely concealing a wince at how his voice scraped his already-stinging throat. "Can't have you missing any rendezvous with that red-headed bint of yours. Or perhaps you-"
There was a rustling sound from somewhere to his left, and instantly the pale boy stilled, all traces of sleep vanished from his body as realized he wasn't alone. Slowly, he reached a hand beneath his pillow (which smelled weirdly good, for some reason) for his wand, but his fingers closed around empty air. His pulse spiked.
Draco sighed as he finally found himself alone, shoulders drooping as he forced his muscles to relax. This whole week had been such a confusing blur; he was having a hard time keeping up with anything that was going on. He muffled a cough into his shoulder, slowly dragging a hand up to his collar to begin unbuttoning his shirt. Why was Potter being so nice to him? Just days ago, he'd accused Draco of harboring some sort of nefarious scheme to murder all of Hogwarts. What had changed?
Draco scowled, opening his mouth to tell the other boy just exactly where he could shove it, but was cut off as the itch in his nose prickled suddenly, and instead found himself twisting away to muffle a series of tiny, wet explosions against his wrist. "hihtchh! hihksh! tsh!"
Draco woke with a groan, eyes squeezing shut against the soft rays of light that filled his vision. He distantly remembered something about a cold halls and green eyes, and had half a mind to wonder how he'd managed to make it back to his dorms.
The things he'd been forced to see, to do during the War weighed heavily upon him as he trudged an stumbled through the shattered remains of his life. Sometimes he was so overwhelmed by the past that he forgot how to breathe, how to think; he would lie there in his room for hours in his room waiting for the tremors and flashbacks to pass.
He remembered one time in September when a Fifth Year Hufflepuff had managed to charm his robes to smell like burnt flesh. The blonde had barely had time to stumble into to the nearest bathroom before he was falling to his knees and vomiting up every bit of the meager breakfast he'd choked down that morning. When his body had finally granted him a second to breathe, he'd glanced up only to find the one and only Harry Potter staring down a him with a mix of shock and confusion adorning his face. Needless to say, Draco had meticulously avoided the Gryffindor ever since that incident.
suddenly begin to look at you like a turkey on Christmas Day.”  The students nodded but Marylin could feel their uneasiness.  She noted that Nott was looking slightly smug and she made a mental to keep an eye on him.  She mentally sighed again.
Vernon scowled at the figure on his doorway, irritated by the interruption.  “Who the hell are you and what the hell do you want?” he snapped, already beginning to close the door.
Saira snorted in disgust but said nothing.  Leon quietly said, “A Carus Noctivagus is a vampire’s mate.  Your sister has one I believe?”
he thought distantly as he swung the cloak around his shoulders and slowly made his way to the door.
Unfortunately, Pomfrey snorted and began walking out of the room. “You’re not leaving until I figure out why you’ve recovered so soon. For all I know, the moment you walk out, you’ll be hit with the fever and be stubborn again and not return until you’re an inch from death. Better start getting comfortable, Mr. Potter.”
Harry?”  Sirius growled, standing up from his seat as Remus slowly stood as well, his frown darkening.  “What the hell is that suppose to mean?”
“It was…” A sudden weakness came over him. His eyes flickered as the little strength in him vanished and he heard the crowd let out a cry as he crumpled to his side on the ground. The Headmaster’s eyes widened and Harry distantly heard him sharply shout. Through his dimming vision, Harry saw a flash of red and thought it looked like Ron as it raced out of the Great Hall but he lost the thought as his vision and world grew dark.
Ron stared with the rest at the two figures next to each beast.  One was tall with long arms bare except for the wristbands with spikes.  The other was a large mass of power, cracking her neck as she coolly surveyed the silent, wide eyed crowd.
The spell hit one of the castle windows, shattering onto the vampires and wizards dueling.  Remnants of the spell bounced back.
Hagrid furrowed his brows and asked where Harry was during their lesson.  Ron reassured him that he was just feeling a little under the weather.  After the lesson, the redhead promised to deliver the rock cakes with his well wishes.
“Tomorrow,” Jonas cut in firmly, stepping forward.  “We can talk about this tomorrow.  It’s been a long day already and my patients need to rest.”
“What are you all doing?” Snape suddenly snapped, causing Harry to jump and look at the irritated Potions Master, who was now glaring around furiously.  Draco moved swiftly to his seat, sitting down.  Harry saw the blond look at him from the corner of his eye as the Slytherin sat down but he refused to return the look.
Moving behind her desk, Professor Opacre gestured to the small clear bag containing the multicolored vials. "I've taken the liberty of procuring some simple healing potions from Professor Snape - so you
“So you agree this needs to be resolved,” Lest jumped at the chance, taking a step closer as Libby glanced up at him.  “Maybe it will take longer but you can fix him - ”
Reaching inside, he pulled out a small book with gold edging and no title.  Frowning, he looked at it before warily opening it.  There was writing inside the book, written in different colors.  Flipping through it, he saw there were still blank pages in the back.  He flipped to the front and read the front page that just contained a couple of words written in calligraphy in dark purple ink.
“I can’t imagine why,” a terribly familiar sneer came from behind them and Remus sighed as Sirius’ growls grew louder.
“I thought I could stand a lot of things, Myn,” Lest said, his voice almost conversational despite that terrifying look in his eyes.  “The things that I couldn’t stop, the things I had to do because if I didn’t, the results would be so much worse.  You felt that way too, didn’t you?”  He glanced back out at the window and was silent for a moment.  “I think the war did a lot of that to people.  And I always thought, well, this will help.  Later.  To endure things.”
,’ he thought and he panted in relief and subsiding panic as he didn’t know whether to continue crying or laugh.  ‘
"You mean there isn't an order of rank for jewels?" Zabini jumped in, not even bothering to raise his hand as his hazel eyes demanded answers.
“There were precautions for attempts from the wizarding world,” Dumbledore spoke carefully, speaking as if he had said these things to several people already.  “Attempts from Death Eaters, attempts from overzealous fans.  We even accounted for the possibility of Muggle criminal activity by coordinating Auror monitoring with the local law enforcement and a neighbor placed for surveillance.”  Dumbledore took off his spectacles and cleaned them with a cloth he pulled from his pocket.  “Unfortunately, due to unknown variables, we could not account for every situation.”
“I’m going to kill Seamus Finnegan,” Hermione suddenly growled and Harry turned his still-shocked face towards her glowering one. “I bet
Harry watched nervously as his Head of House quietly closed the door to Dumbledore’s office.  She hadn’t said a single word from the Great Hall to the Headmaster’s office and before she had left, she had placed comforting hand on his shoulder and squeezed.  Then she had left quickly, her eyes still strangely bright.  To say the least, he was highly worried.
The blond vampire watched the destruction of another useless piece of art with a dispassionate face.  He turned his eyes, the only part of him that held any emotion, towards another statue.  His dark blue eyes were the only thing that truly showed what he was feeling inside.
From his peripheral vision he saw Hermione look up, a look mingled with relief and disappointment on her face.  “Eight,” she said, her eyes still glancing over at an awkward Ron.  “Just a few hours before we have to be back for curfew.”  Then she glanced curiously over at Harry.  “Why?”
Qye scoffed and looked away from her, turning his glare onto Smethwyck quietly standing behind the couch.  The Healer raised a questioning eyebrow at him.  “Are you involved in this evaluation too?  I thought you said you were trying to limit interference and you’ve been with us all week.  Isn’t that going to influence your
Ginny and the twins sat in his room with him, equally silent.  Fred was toying with one of their products, an uncharacteristic frown on his face as George waved his wand over their paperwork, his movements stilted.  Ginny was quietly stroking a hand down Pig’s back, the tiny owl uncharacteristically quiet as his head whirled around the tense room.  They had heard their mother whispering urgently into the Floo earlier, trying yet again to get information about Harry.  When the Floo shut down and they saw their mother sit down, heavy and silent, they had made their retreat.
“Is there any reason in particular why you hit me, Soror?” Lest asked coolly as he followed her into her rooms, silently shutting the door behind him and leaning against it while crossing his arms.  His dark eyes flashed dangerously.
Hermione nodded satisfactorily and gestured to him as she spoke triumphantly to Ron. “See, he doesn’t even know it! He was probably in so much pain he didn’t even know it was him and just grabbed on as an instinct for comfort.” Ron rolled his eyes.
Whoever this 'Qye' was, he was apparently extremely cynical.  Of course, Harry thought later, he probably would have been as well if the same thing happened to him.  Still, in almost all his entries, the boy had shown a pessimistic view of life and gave off a deep feeling of bitterness and resentment.  Harry wondered what could have caused him to act like that and hoped later entries would help him figure this boy out.  He could skip to the last entries, of course, but he preferred going in order so he could understand things more clearly.
He screamed and clawed his face as the metallic substance clung to his skin, stumbling into the wall.  Ron watched as he frantically tried to use his wrist bands to tear its expanding form off, falling to his knees as it continued to spread.  It covered his eyes, his nose and finally his mouth as his screams turned muffled.
Looking at Professor Opacre, her eyes bright, face glowing and looking so much younger and freer that he had ever seen her, made it hard to resist her when she obviously meant no real harm.  As she murmured and brushed the shirt down, eyeing the fit of the jeans, he wondered how long it had been since she had a moment to be herself.
Harry dropped his elbows to the table again, raising his hands to rub at his temples while he closed his eyes.  He was going to have a headache later on, he was sure of it.
Except several similar situations followed.  Seamus stumbled into Crabbe and merely got pushed back instead of getting into a fight.  Greengrass accidentally dropped her books and got helped by Ginny.  Harry even thought he once saw Nott misdirect Filch while the twins were in the middle of a prank.  But even that hadn’t been the weirdest thing.
Finally, she straightened from the door frame and quietly made her way to the podium next to the cherry wood desk.  Each pair of eyes in the Slytherin-Gryffindor class followed her, betraying how they felt about having a nosferatu as their new professor.  Some eyes were wary, unsure of how this teacher would turn out.  Others held mistrust, holding their prejudices and the memories of the woman’s predecessors close to heart.  Few eyes were eager to have a vampire for a teacher and others were indifferent.  Two eyes were different though.
“In a strictly platonic sense, yeah?” Ron added, nudging his foot with his elbow and smiling slightly. Harry let out a small laugh, some of the tension and panic easing from him.
Seeing the nurse’s face begin to redden, Harry hastily cut in. “It doesn’t really matter.” Everyone turned to look at him and he shifted awkwardly on the bed. “I mean, it’s only one day and nothing really important happened that day, right?” Lest’s face flashed for an instant, causing Harry to pause for a moment before continuing. “Maybe it was the sickness that did that to me and messed with my brain while I seemed cured on the outside. And then it stopped and came back as a physical thing. But since I’m cured now, I don’t think it’ll happen again. If it’s not doing me any harm then I see no reason to worry so much about it.”
:: Harry began, feeling his annoyance begin to rise with the person.  Then it fell quickly, shock and fear overtaking it.
Draco joined him and looked thoughtfully at the shack.  He glanced at Harry.  “I thought I was pretty clear earlier.”
“What do you suppose that means?” Ron finally asked, glancing at the map, his blue eyes puzzled still. “Maybe…maybe the map’s malfunctioning?”
Everything had gone…odd. Woken up with a fever. Went through an upsetting conversation with Ron and Hermione. Was reminded how grateful he was to have friends like them and comforted by their presence. Received…unsettling…news about new encounters with Lest and the consequences he would face from people. Uncomfortably found out that he was missing an entire day’s worth of memories which made him rather uneasy. Having to deal that he was stuck in the Infirmary for the entire weekend.
“Is Harry okay?” Sirius broke in, voice tight with anger and worry.  Remus saw him shift in place, resembling his restless pawing earlier.  “Hogsmeade looked calm but - ”
The Infirmary was silent except for Madam Pomfrey, who snored undisturbed in her bed in the nurse’s office. Other than Harry Potter, there were few other patients in the Infirmary and all of the occupants were fast asleep in their beds as the door quietly opened and a slim figure slipped in.
He shook his head slowly, took a stumbling step back and as his back hit one of the posts of the bed, he whirled around, mindlessly looking around the room once more.  There was the faintest light though the crack of the door, barely illuminating the room while dim sunlight shone through the window with its view of clouds and Hogwarts grounds.  His eyes caught sight of the chairs underneath it and his feet started walking without a thought from him.
There were so many implications in this, thoughts clawing in the back of his head with the rest of his locked away memories, things he didn’t want to think about.
Nausea swelled in him and he swallowed back as he stared down at the text.  His finger moved and he dully pointed to the section he just read.
The former professor stiffened, reigning in a sigh as he recognized the voice, and turned to look at Olivia Perkins, the resident of Hogsmeade notorious for her grumbles of the Hogwarts trips, rising prices of local shops since 1968 and her snide “good riddance” attitude when he was outed as a werewolf.
“Clearly,” the stout woman said shortly, lifting her wand.  “Despite all your attempts, all of Hogwarts’ students are still alive and protected.  While there is breath left in us, we will fight for them.”
Harry swallowed and closed his eyes, hanging his head.  “Thank you,” he whispered.  She put her head on his shoulder and they sat there for a few minutes.
“Er…” Harry said hesitantly, relaxing his hold on his quill and already reaching resignedly for his wand, “Yes?”
“I guess you know everything about kissing asses, don’t you, Malfoy?” the vampire snapped and Malfoy’s fists trembled.  “You little piss-nosed, inbred son of a beast’s bitch, you’re that same little asshole with more than a stick up your arse.  I’m surprised to find you here, of all places, a place crawling with age and dirt.   Always pegged you for a
Harry’s eyes widened as he took himself in.  His hair flowed back, the strands carefully arranged so they made a gentle wave.  There wasn’t any neatness as his hair was always opposed to it but she made it seem as if it was flowing together rather than every which way.  He turned his head and contemplated how long his hair was now, almost long enough to tie.  He touched it lightly and smiled faintly as a lock lazily brushed his ear.
Lest hesitated for a moment outside, his brow furrowing as he could feel the anxiousness of Smethwyck’s mind but an odd muteness where there should have been another.
“No, but you’re the only one making a scene,” Dean sighed, pulling the Irish teenager back as Harry and Draco stood up.  “Sorry, I held him back as long as I could,” he added.  He glanced behind them, where there were other students not too subtlety looking over at them.  “At least it’s coming from a friendly face?”
Hermione’s brown eyes searched him as he floundered, slowly softening as the silence went on longer.
He had hurriedly timed his last one as close as possible as to when Dumbledore said he would need him, doublechecked to make sure that he had given all the necessary nutrient potions.  He had even swiftly brushed down his messy hair, looking rough and tangled from his nervous hands running through it as he rehearsed explaining the current situation to a man Dumbledore swore was not actually a killer despite all evidence to the contrary.
“Neither,” he said shortly, mentally hissing at the snickering voice.  His eyebrow twitched slightly, he asked wearily, “Can I have my essay back?”
Marylin had distantly heard Ron and Hermione’s voices before the Deputy Headmistress had silenced and protected the room.  She felt her Nosle students still shadowing around, numbly heard no one had been severely hurt and they would all be sent home soon.
“So as you can see, Pater Nosferatu,” Leon began to conclude, “The Dazains are really hardly anything anymore.  Yes, there are still some Dazain groups out there right now,” he added, seeing Saira beginning to open her mouth to argue, “but they can hardly be called a threat.  Give it a couple of months and the Dazains will be nothing but an extremely bad memory.”
Draped on top of the ring almost carelessly had been a necklace with a pendant.  It might have suited the vampire woman but he strangely didn't want to part with it.  He had brought it out a couple of times, just looking at its fine, dark chain and engraving on the pendant.  A silvery blue crescent moon hung upside down with metallic gray stars that twinkled beneath it and on a field of black was the engraving that shone on the pendent.  He sometimes felt something emitting from it, something dark and dominating.  It made him wary and he quickly put the necklace away when he felt the sensation begin to arise.  He knew he probably should have turned it in but he didn't.  He just kept it hidden with the other things.
“I hadn’t noticed that,” his sister murmured and he shrugged, turning his eyes back to the fire.  He felt her eyes on him again.
Tightening the red and gold scarf around his neck, he replied to Qye as he continued to look through the crowd of students.
“Neither are you,” a male voice drawled and Ron jerked as another person appeared next to Reya, a little older but no more than Percy.  He wore the same armband as the girl, threads of red and blue and silver on black.
“Done,” Sirius said, ignoring the exasperated looks thrown at him from around the room, looking earnestly back at them.  “I’ll send Molly a letter so that they can come and…”  He faltered and Qye resisted the urge to grin as he saw Remus rub his temples, giving Sirius a long-suffering look.  “Well, we’ll work it out.”
“I wouldn’t be surprised,” Hermione commented, also turning around to look at the Slytherin table.  “I heard that some parents didn’t send their kids back because of what happened last - ” She cut off abruptly, shooting Harry a nervous look.
She stepped away from the podium and walked in front of her desk, which held a variety of items that ranged from protection amulets to random papers sent to her from the vampire families.  She leaned against it and crossed her arms, smiling calmly at the nervous class.
“Was there any reason we had to run like maniacs all the way here?” Hermione said crossly, folding her arms and walking towards the redhead.
:: he replied, surprised.  The ache was beginning to fade away in his eyes and he tentatively opened them further, blinking slightly to ease the pressure in them.  Everything was still blurred and it felt odd looking at things but the unpleasant feeling was beginning to go away.
Decked in black jeans with a white long sleeved shirt and a dark gray hooded vest that was zipped up, Opacre’s brother could have passed for a normal young adult…if it weren’t for the too-pale skin.  As he checked the instructions for the next step, Harry watched the new vampire from the corner of his eye, trying to look at his face.  The hood was pulled too forward, however, and all he could see were pale rose lips and a curved jaw like his sister’s.
Snape stayed in the waiting room, glowering after the vampires for a moment before turning his black eyes back at the room where the Potter boy lay. He narrowed his eyes slightly and pursued his lips. After a moment, without removing his eyes, he said, “He’ll be fine, Draco.”
“You keep forgetting you’re only human, Harry,” Hermione’s muffled voice came from his shoulder, sounding slightly sad. “You forget that you can get as sick as anybody else, that you’re young like all of us and you’re not invincible, not from anything.” Her voice trembled, the sadness deepening. “Everyone forgets.” She pulled back and gave another shimmering-eyed glare. “That’s why you have us, Harry, Ron and me! You’re suppose to come to us when you can’t handle it, that’s what friends do. Why won’t you let us help you?”
Voldemort idly waved a hand and she saw the faint grimace on the Dazain vampire’s face as he lowered his hand from Harry’s mouth.  “Well, Harry?”
Harry thought about the way he saw the others dancing, bodies pressed close or throwing themselves to the beat, moving in ways in that he was not yet comfortable doing in front of so many people.  And then he thought about the way people stared at him and Draco as soon as they walked in and the way they kept glancing over at them, the gazes and whispers following them as they left.
“It is when I know you asked just to annoy me,” Harry commented absently, his green eyes watching amusedly as his best friends continued to argue heatedly.
Harry grinned as they got back to Draco and Ron, who had thankfully managed to keep their glares to themselves.  Ron pointedly turned away from the blond and started talking with Hermione, who was subtly flicking her wand at him under the table as she sat next to him, smiling at the redhead when he absently shifted to give her more space.  Draco turned to Harry and he felt a slow coil of warmth at the answering smirk.
The doors of the train slid open and out bounded a large black dog, his nails clacking against the stone floor of the station.
“How are you feeling, Mr. Potter?” Madam Pomfrey asked as she brought out her wand and walked over to his side.
"The jewels are only accessible to pureblooded vampires, meaning vampires that were born vampires. People who were turned into a vampire do not have jewels of their own. If they're particularly strong, they might be able to use the jewel of the vampire that turned them,
“All my life, my father told me about the glory that awaited us should he ever return.  I never thought about exactly what he would do,” Draco whispered, a touch of bewilderment in his voice.  “My father kept saying things would be better, that purebloods would take the place they needed.  That trusting Muggles and the world outside of magic would bring nothing but ruin to our people.  And what does he do instead?”
Something was not right. Weasley was looking at him strangely, blue eyes slightly narrowed and an uncertain look in them. Qye barely refrained from frowning at him. ‘
“Harry, you don’t have to figure everything out right now,” she said, voice growing serious again.  “There’s no rush.  Ron and I would never turn our backs on you, whatever you’re going through.  If you like…Draco,” she said, only slightly stumbling over his name, “then take it at your pace.  You’ll figure it out, one way or another.  And we’re always going to be here for you.  Always.”
Except this time, the contestant didn't fall. Ron must've seen the gesture because he shifted his feet, catching the push with his left foot behind him and balancing himself with his right foot in front. His wand hand did jerk forward, as if his wand wanted to fly out, but Ron's grip seemed tight and he only jerked forward a bit.
Hermione sat next to him, dazzling in her gentle purple skirt and periwinkle blue shirt gathered around her delicately, hair wrapped in a messy bun looking beautiful, her mouth hanging open.
he thought as he kept half his attention on the duel and his shoulders stiffened because what happened if Lest heard that too?
Draco stopped.  “You’ve done that a lot this year,” he said quietly, gray eyes giving him an indescribable look.
“Are you getting anything different?” Jonas asked curiously as he lowered his wand and watched her brush her fingertips across the scarred forehead.  She grimaced and pulled back, rubbing her hand absently against her coat as if wiping something away.  He took a step closer and said, “You know, I was also trained in Legilmency during my Psyche rotation, just enough to use it to scan mental effects of spell damage.  As I may have mentioned before, the scar is one such remainder and I would be more than happy to assist you - ”
“You’re fortunate it was me stopping by in the night, Dumbledore,” Lest drawled, drumming his fingers on the armrest.  “Goddess knows what other monsters might have snuck through your web of protection if they only waited until the cover of nightfall.”
Harry looked at his stiff posture, his dark expression, and quietly said, “You really don’t like them, do you?”  He was silent and then continued, “You don’t like
“I don’t have a good one,” Harry exhaled, “besides the fact that I’m just so tired.”  He closed eyes and continued, a touch bitterly now, “Very, very tired.”
“It is,” she answered, unflinching in the face of his mocking.  “I would still like you to answer.  How old are you?”
Pomfrey had muttered something about needing Smethwyck to help stabilize Harry’s magic not a minute after the man left and Qye couldn’t help but roll his eyes even as he hovered over Harry, his own body still shaking with leftover wrath and nerves.  The healers had just said they were fine and now Harry’s skin kept giving off these strange little electric tingles whenever Qye touched him, despite Harry sighing that he was fine.
:: Harry said weakly, trying to stifle his coughing. He winced as his head throbbed and similarly felt Qye wince.
He and Qye both gasped in pain and he took another step back from the vampire, wincing as he raised a hand towards his head.  “What - ”  He shook his head and took another step back, blinking rapidly at Lest.  “What are you doing?”
He was barely aware of the coverings of the other beds opening up as he tightened his grip behind Harry, trying desperately to stop him.  For all the fact that he was smaller and slighter than the redhead, Harry was fighting desperately, arms reaching without a seeming target.  Ron briefly saw glimpses of tear tracks on his pale cheeks.
“Voldemort,” he muttered, his green eyes dull and empty. He shivered again and rubbed his face slowly. As he lowered his hands, he stared at the blood mingled with his tears.
“Do I look that old to you?” the vampire asked softly and Harry blinked again.  He watched curiously as a pale hand rose, pushing back the hood.
Healer Jonas Smethwyck noted their tempo, inwardly sighing as he saw no change from the previous day.  The fluctuations had been slowly decreasing since the first day, too little to detect until he brought the medical globes and could see the details.  It was far better than what Poppy had given him when he arrived at Hogwarts, the jumps and falls a serious sign of magical mismanagement.  He had never seen such variations in his career as one of the lead Healers at St. Mungo’s and any magical fluctuation typically meant a worst case scenario for the patient.
:: he muttered to Qye, looking around the Infirmary tiredly and noticing that he was the only one in right now.  ::
He sat up slowly, blinking and bringing a hand up to his head.  Something woke him up.  One minute, he was blissfully asleep and the next he was staring up at his canopy.  He furrowed his brow, trying to remember what had woken him up.  It wasn’t his scar, he knew that.  The lightning bolt scar was the same as always, not burning greatly under his long black bangs that hid his forehead.  He furrowed his brow even more, racking his mind for a reason as to why he woke up all of sudden.
Harry felt Ron tense up when the blonde Slytherin opened his mouth and he grabbed his redheaded friend’s arm before he could lunge towards the smirking boy.
him was the way Lest drawled out mockingly helpful tips as each student's face showed how desperate they were trying not to think. Lest smirked at each student as they slumped away with their returned wands and Harry could feel his fingers twitch in annoyance each time, silently rooting for the following contestant, whether they'd be Gryffindor or Slytherin.
“Trying to hide?” Dazain sighed, lifting a hand to rub at his temple.  “What are you hiding that Opacre is so - ”
“Wait!” The vampires turned, surprised, to him and he grabbed the bag lying at the end of the bed. Shifting through its contents, he picked out two red lollipops.
“Oh, don’t ‘Jacob’ me, Jordan,” his red haired twin said in annoyance, glowering at him.  “You know I’m right.”
“Oi!” the Irish boy said in a mock-hurt voice.  “Now what did I do to deserve such brutal treatment?”
“Hello to you, too,” Harry said dryly, placing aside his almost finished drink.  “Enjoying yourself?”
“This is my victory,” snapped Voldemort, striding back towards Harry and Dazain, roughly intercepting them and breaking the contact.  “My conquest and I will not let you or anyone stand from ridding myself of this troublesome pest anymore!  He is insignificant, unworthy, a mistake - ”
It staggered, howling, its shrieks matching those of the younger students.  In the corner of his eye, he saw Sprout struggle towards them as it snarled and flailed and reached for them.  He shifted his feet and as it took another step, he snapped out, “
:: the voice muttered.  Harry shivered as he heard it sigh and the other one must have noticed this – how could it?! - because they snapped,  ::
It was hard when he would momentarily forget what he knew, grinning at a story one of his friends told or laughing at an inside joke.  But then the feelings would come back hard and he struggled not to scream and let everyone know.
Sighing, Qye ran a hand through his hair. Feeling Harry again showed the boy still sleeping and still sick. Qye frowned as another thought came to him. He had heard once that after an extremely traumatic accident, people went into comas in order to heal themselves and he knew that people slept a lot when sick. Maybe…maybe after what had happened, Harry had subconsciously done that. But why had Qye switched places with him?
From what he had read, he had concluded that 'Qye' was a boy when writing this, although an intelligent one at that.  He didn't know how old this 'Qye' was though.  There had been too much dust on the belongings to say that the books had just been placed there recently and too little to say they had been there for so long.  Maybe this 'Qye' had lived there before he had been born?  All of the things in the compartment most likely belonged to 'Qye' but he didn't understand how or why.  The books that wouldn't open. . .they were obviously magical.  Did that mean the boy was a wizard?  But Privet Drive was a Muggle neighborhood.  He didn't understand.
The vampire was a fallen angel.  That was the only thing that could have explained it.  Dirty blond hair whose ends curled just barely above the end of his ears.  Dark blue eyes framed perfectly in a mature face that was smooth.  A curved jaw fitted pale pink lips that looked inviting.  High cheekbones and a curved nose finished the refined look of the young adult.
“That doesn’t mean you’re skipping practice, Harry,” Ron said, narrowing his eyes at the bundle in the bed.  He jabbed a finger at it.  “If you don’t get up this minute, I’m calling Hermione.”
“Come on, mate,” Ron said, glaring at the back of the Slytherin.  “We have Herbology next and that’s on the other side of the school.”
“What does that mean?” Qye said, voice hoarse.  He cleared his throat, dropping his arms and straightening up.  “Does that mean you think we’re just going to, what?  Change our minds one day?  Say ‘oh, you know what, you’re right, we actually do want to get mixed up altogether, lose everything about us and becomes gods knows what’ - ”
“My name’s Marylin,” the vampire introduced herself, briefly glancing down at the dog.  “The Headmaster sent me to greet you and I figured a friendly face would help before you talked with Lest.”
Gripping the edges of his seat, he looked at the Headmaster.  The elderly man had said nothing since Harry had entered and the anxiety in him had grown when he saw the usual twinkle in Dumbledore’s eyes missing.  Minutes passed by as Dumbledore looked at him with no expression and he began to sweat, gripping his chair until his knuckles were white.
He blushed slightly.  “Er…hello, Professor,” Harry said softly, grinning sheepishly up at the vampire woman.  “I was just resting a bit.”  He glanced at the potions and hastily added in the next ingredients, stirring them in gently.
“You know,” the young professor continued, a touch of irritation finally entering her composed voice, “as I am the one teaching this class, I think I should be the one to enjoy the fruit of my labor.”
“Sorry, Frater, Headmaster,” Marylin apologized as she walked over to the armchair where a young man sat, an elbow atop an armrest with his head propped on his fist, his other hand toying with something on a necklace.  His dark blue eyes fixated on them the moment they entered and it took everything in Remus not to snarl at him.
"Come on," he said after a moment, looking back and forth between his friends who were studiously avoiding each other's eyes.  "Snape'll have our points if we're late."  He turned and walked in, hearing his friends follow him.
Harry took in a deep gulping breath, his chest and throat feeling as though someone was squeezing every breath from it.
Qye reminded him softly as Harry hid in an alcove a few corridors from the library, trying to bring his heartbeat down.
He silently poured himself some pumpkin juice, avoiding his friends’ eyes.  Already he was beginning to feel the guilt of snapping at Hermione.  ‘
Pomfrey had ruined Plan A (not interfering with Harry’s people at all) but he had Plan B, which called for minimal interaction with Harry’s people, none whatsoever with people he was close to, i.e. Weasel and Granger.
For once, there were no thoughts running through Harry’s mind.  Both he and Qye thought of nothing as they both looked wide-eyed into the eyes of Lest Opacre, who still gazed with the soft look in his eyes.
“They can drink animal blood as a replacement for human blood,” Harry said in an absentminded voice, picking out the lima beans in his vegetables.  “They don’t necessarily have to drink human blood all the time, too.  They can stave off it for long periods of time if necessary.”  He finished picking the disgusting beans out of his vegetables and was about to eat a satisfying spoonful when he noticed the silence.  He lifted his eyes from his plate and blinked when he saw everyone looking at him oddly.  “What?” he asked defensively, putting down his utensil.
Smethwyck glanced up at Qye and glanced briefly to the side before doing the same with Harry.  “Is that okay with both of you?”
He ignored it as they walked through the castle doors.  As they rounded a hallway, he saw Sirius waiting for them and Remus recognized the pale blond hair just further down the corridor.
“Would you prefer me to pretend we’re not all flying by the skin of our teeth, Qye?” Wainscott said and Qye drew back at her honesty.  “I’ve been involved in several unorthodox cases, which have become my specialty by sheer chance.  Each time, I’ve had to test and try out new methods because the traditional protocols don’t fit the individuals involved.  I don’t have a plan for how to run this evaluation but I can also say I’ve never let anything like that stop me before.”
“Will he be alright though?” Ron asked, looking pale, his hand gripping the girl’s beside him just as tightly as she was.
“The other one can bloody well hear you,” Qye said in the same hard voice he had interrupted the others with and ignored Harry as he shook his head tiredly.  “If you could all damn well stop talking like we aren’t here, that would be a major fucking improvement.”
“Then we don’t need this,” another insisted.  “This was completely useless, we’ve gotten nothing from it except - ”
“Let’s sit down later tonight,” Harry said in an undertone, glancing around them.  All around them he saw the drained faces of their classmates.  “I just need to do something first and I’ll catch up with you at dinner.”
“Too late!” laughed one of the vampires as he danced around a Stinging Hex and kicked Ron in the back, sending him sprawling.  “Is this the best magic can offer?” he taunted as he sent another kick, straight into the teenager’s ribs and forcing a cry of pain.
They stared at each other and then Draco let out a long breath and looked back down at his book, jaw clenched.
“What’s this all about?” Seamus wondered, as he propped himself on Dean’s shoulder and angled his head around to get a better view.
She nodded and coughed, feeling like she was going to suffocate from holding back her laughter. Turning to Hermione, she felt a pang of pity at the confused look on her face.
“What are you?” the vampire finally said, eyes widening just as Harry got the memory he wanted (Draco kissing his cheek, warm and waiting).
Marylin hastily closed up her office and hurried to catch her brother.  As she met his pace, she glanced at him from the corner of her eye.
,’ he thought tiredly as he waited with his friends for Hagrid to show up.  Everyone was already there, having trudged from Potions together.  The Slytherins were jeering at him and his friends but fortunately, Ron hadn’t noticed as he was once again bickering with Hermione.
“If you think,” Ron began, still stretched out on Harry’s bed as Harry came silently back from the showers the next morning, “that we’re going to let this go without an explanation, you’ve got another thing coming.”
“Weasley!” shouted Professor Sinistra and he didn’t have time to blink before he felt claws tearing through his robes, dragging him to the floor.
The bright white blur came closer and Harry closed his eyes gratefully as a cool hand felt his forehead.
“Are you sure you want to trust them, Headmaster?” Snape suddenly broke in coldly as the vampires began to nod, his black eyes glinting. “You heard what Potter said. There are vampires with Voldemort. And though Potter is an idiot, he is an
Libby restrained her instinctive flinch at the snarl of Lest Opacre as she met his stare, deep with poorly hidden terror, disguised as ferocity.
“I will if he does,” Malfoy said grudgingly, glancing over at the vampire woman.  Harry grinned slightly, squeezing the other’s hand gratefully before letting go and pulling back.
Voldemort stepped closer to Dazain, bringing out his own wand.  “I would say the odds are better now.”
Lest gritted his teeth and dropped his hand from his head.  “In case you’ve forgotten, he didn’t exactly give me a choice to stay civil…”
“Hermione,” he began in a warning tone, his momentary time of peace broken.  He glowered at her but she remained unaffected, the determined look returning to her eyes.  Before she could ask anything or he could tell her to stop a sandy-haired boy appeared at Harry’s side with Dean Thomas and Neville Longbottom.
,” Seamus chortled as he got his things for the shower.  The sandy-haired boy winked coyly at a still-puzzled Harry.  “Next time, keep it down or ask me for help, love.”  Snickering, Seamus left the room for the showers.
He jerked his head up, blinking as he looked at an exasperated and slightly concerned Hermione and a curious Ron.
Although, he inwardly sighed as she crouched and fiddled with the straps on his boots, he really wished it hadn’t been with him.
Harry blushed further and lowered his eyes.  “I’m sorry, sir,” he muttered then winced and groaned, hiding his face in his hands.  “I’m just going to shut up…”
“It did not complete,” sighed Dumbledore as he wearily looked at the unconscious figures.  “Mr. Malfoy’s spell interrupted the incantation but what did form…how does it look?”
“Harry?” Draco said hoarsely, making the other teenager shiver and ache at the sound.  Emerald eyes watched with not a small touch of dismay as the heat in the silver eyes slowly began to fade away, confusion growing.  “Harry, what - ”
He raised the vial to his lips and paused for a moment.  His mind was pulsing again and he furrowed his brow slightly.  Shaking his head, he tipped the vial back and swallowed the citrus-tasting potion.
"That's not going to work," he thought he heard Ron murmur behind him and he glanced quizzically at his friend but the redhead didn't continue. He was only looking at the pair with a resigned expression on his face.
Harry asked, scanning the rest of the section to see if there was any more information.  It looked like that was the only place the term was mentioned however.
Then he realized he was left with the crowd of people who were still giving them curious looks.  Even the Weasley twins were grinning in a manner that was not at all comforting.
What followed had him protesting, squirming, yelping, begging and fumbling for his wand before finally submitting to standing in yet
He swallowed and instead of crossing his arms over himself like he wanted, he hooked his thumb in one of the loops of the jeans and raised an eyebrow at Draco.
"Bit of an invasion of privacy then, isn't it?" Harry jerked and came back as the icy voice cut through the room. It was the first time since class started that he heard Draco speak and when Harry's eyes glanced at him, he saw a hard expression on his pale face.
The sun had disappeared and the half-moon hung high in the sky as Dumbledore made his way back to the Floo Chambers.
“Back off, give him some space!” Another person shouted but the crowd didn’t seem to listen as they continued to bear down on him. Heat that was already running violently through his body grew intensely and a small sound escaped Harry’s throat as he laid there, eyes staring at nothing. Too much heat, too many people, Voldemort, tendrils, the voice, grabbing at him, tearing him, pulling, grasping, consuming…
:: he asked confusedly as Madam Pomfrey took out her wand and muttered a spell, waving it over him.  The tip of it turned white and she carefully moved it around him.
“Bloody coward finally got too close to the action,” Sirius said bitterly.  “He gets to run off all safe and sound and leave the rest of it for everyone else to pick up after.”
“They talked about sticking you in the Janus Thickley ward,” Remus shared nonchalantly and Qye watched as everyone, even Smethwyck and Dumbledore, gave the man a surprised look.  “We decided that was a bad idea.”
“Fresh food,” a vampire drawled, lounging against a tree as the beast vampire dashed off, swiftly followed by the rest, straight for the castle.
“I blame you as a corrupting influence,” Hermione groused, alternately glowering between the two boys. Harry merely smiled at her and she rolled her eyes. “Come on, before you can cause more harm.”
By the time he had come back to Hogwarts, it was late at night and everyone was asleep.  This had made it easy for him to hide the things from the Dursleys under his mattress while all of his roommates slept like logs.  He said nothing about his trip to Privet Drive since coming back and no one had ever brought it up so he was able to keep the things from the cupboard a secret, even though he wasn't entirely sure why he wanted to.
A mirror to the left of the broken statue erupted into a million small fragments and he grimaced slightly.  Forcing the snarl from his face, he looked down coldly at the broken pieces of glass.  Sighing in irritation, he dropped into a nearby armchair.
But as he rejoined them, they evidently snapped out of it and her already frazzled nerves - hesitantly fluttering around a too quiet Lest who was merely thoughtfully looking at Harry while he rubbed his reddening cheek - took another hit when they burst into cheers and whoops. Each of them looked eager and ready to go another round with Lest and she had perked up. The way they had looked, so downtrodden, made her worry they wouldn't be able to face a Dazain if they ever had to. But they had spun around and she was so close to letting them try again...
"I can see we're going to have some resistance about this," Professor Opacre said in a dry voice, cutting off the students' protest and Qye's response before it began.
“And I would have found and killed you,” Remus added.  “Then taken him for myself.”  This time it was Sirius that threw him a wounded look, to which Remus shrugged lightly.
The Gryffindor roused slightly at these words but when the voice didn’t say anything further, Harry’s mind contently began to doze off again.  Silence reigned as Harry happily began to drift back to sleep, relieved he didn’t have to leave his comfortable surroundings.  Silence and peace reigned.
thankful he didn’t. Did he remember grabbing and clinging on to Lest in the middle of his second fainting fit? Someone kill him now, Voldemort, where are you?
…a vial which he promptly dropped as the sound of a resounding thud echoed out in the corridor, shortly followed by a muffled voice, whose words were in a different language but the meaning was clear.
:: Harry said, forcing away the blush and glancing to see if Ron and Hermione had noticed.  They hadn’t; they were still arguing.
Hermione and Ron wasted no time, their exhausted bodies cornering Harry.  It was a testament to how worried Hermione was that she didn’t even talk about how she did or whether she should’ve studied something more but rather focused her eyes immediately on Harry as soon as they all met up after their Charms practical.
The werewolf stopped and dropped his hand, amber eyes immediately alert as he grasped his wand in reaction to his friend’s stiffness.  Black eyes were still scanning the letter but Sirius was already standing up, hand closing the Firewhiskey bottle.  “Pack up, we’re catching the next train.”
Harry asked as he spent another fruitless night looking through Qye’s journal, frustrated with the lack of details.
The nurse took a deep breath. “Apparently, Mr. Potter must think that everything will be fine after healing from a severe fever in one night in a way that no possible human is capable of managing. Mr. Potter must foolishly believe that he should not stay in the Infirmary after his too-quick recovery even though there’s a high chance he might relapse. Mr. Potter must think himself invincible.”
Her brow furrowed slightly.  But maybe… maybe Qye’s relatives had been killed after Lest had left.  Maybe someone else had killed Qye’s relatives.  Harry could still be Qye then.
Lest didn’t manage to turn in time and Qye heard him grunt as they crashed into the bedpost, Qye’s eyes fixed on Lest’s throat and trembling because he
"Thanks," he mumbled, turning his eyes to the other boy and blushing slightly.  Malfoy turned his head away, looking over at his own potion, which was a dark teal.
His hand twitched when he heard the crashes in the room, a cry that sounded like Professor Opacre, desperate protests in Sirius’ voice and his name.
There he found several shelves on vampires but without knowing what exactly would be true or not, he left them be.
“I’m not passive,” Harry yawned and something in Qye’s stomach tightened as he thought about the endless naps Harry still took, the way he would drop off in the middle of conversations and the fact that Smethwyck still hadn’t cleared him for the same physical exercises he had Qye doing.  “I just…”
Harry woke up, groggy.  The side of his face ached and he swallowed back nausea as he slowly lifted himself up on his hands.
“Your brother?” he asked, blinking up at her.  “What - ” He was interrupted by a slam on the table.  Jumping slightly, he turned around to stare at a suddenly furious Malfoy, his gray eyes narrowed.
People gasped, some crying out and others leaning as far away as they could from the Head Table as possible.  Across him, Harry heard Ron curse “Bloody hell!” and Neville squeaked while Hermione just stared wide-eyed.  Harry just looked on quietly, mistrust in the new DADA teacher already growing.
“What’s the matter? Is he not on there?” Hermione asked anxiously, coming to stand at Ron’s side. She glanced at the confused redhead, then down at the map.
:: he replied as he turned to look at Neville and Dean.  He blinked as he saw the both of them blushing furiously.  He raised an eyebrow and Neville blushed even more, hastily grabbing his own things for the shower and fleeing the room.  Blinking, he turned to Dean, utterly confused.
The eyes of several students widened incredulously. Before any of them could voice their profound objection though, a low drawl penetrated the tense atmosphere.
:: Harry sighed, finishing copying down the instructions.  They were both silent for a moment as Harry quietly got his ingredients.  As he slowly began to cut them up, he said quietly, ::
The smile faded from Voldemort’s face, swept away by a brief expression of anger before the mocking look returned.  “Trying to pretend, Harry?  How much like your father right before I killed him.”  He chuckled as light, mean laughter floated amongst his Death Eaters.
“Ron,” Hermione reprimanded but still looking at Harry with her narrowed, concerned eyes. “Harry, maybe you should just go to the Infirmary right now. I can pick up your assignments for the rest of your classes while you go and rest.”
along, acting like his typical irritating superior self, arrogant and full of himself like always, easily destroying the peaceful feeling surrounding the tree. The only seemingly possible way to pop Lest’s infuriating ego was to throw something at him and Qye only regretted the acorn wasn’t larger.
“I do believe that’s the first time I’ve ever seen her run out of words,” he remarked, his smile more real now as the woman walked towards him.  “I appreciate - ”
"Lest, you idiot!" she shouted far away and there were hurried clicking footsteps coming towards him.
“I’d actually rather not talk about it,” Harry said and sighed as he watched her eyes narrow.  “Hermione, it’s just rather personal.  Or do you want me asking about you and Ron?” he said as he raised his eyebrows.
Harry stumbled back as the ground between him and young man erupted, flinging his arms up to cover his face from the flying debris.  He coughed as the dust swirled and squinted as his back came against a tree, blinking rapidly.
Libby leaned back in her chair, examining the array of results, observations and recommendations in front of her.  She had made it a point in her career to write all possible recommendations for her evaluations, looking at the risks and benefits in each one as she discarded one after another.
“No one’s going to Janus Thickley,” Sirius said loudly and Qye looked down, a strange warm feeling in his chest, something light battling against his anger.
“I don’t know,” she said and Qye looked away, counting to ten.  “I know even less about you, Qye, than I do Harry.”  She paused and then closed her notebook, putting it next to her on the couch while she leaned forward and studied them, her black eyes even and piercing.  “Do you know what the purpose of my evaluation is?”
“You know there’s nothing we can do when she comes anyway,” Remus reminded him gently, looking at his friend huddled next to his knees, trembling in fear and restraint.  “Smethwyck and Poppy both agreed that the evaluation has to occur with as minimal interference as possible.  Merlin, even Opacre’s healer agreed with them and you heard him yelling at her because of it.”
“You saw him looking at Harry too, right?” said Malfoy.  Ron watched as his hand tightened around his drink before slowly releasing it.
Professor Opacre waved her hand again, still smiling widely.  “Oh, there will be no need for that, I have everything.”
Roughly shaking away the less than useful thoughts, Jonas lowered his wand and considered his options, glancing between the room, the doorway where he had a suspicion as to what had occurred with the guard and out into the hallway where he could still faintly hear the rumbles of argument.
“I just haven’t been getting a lot of sleep lately, that’s all,” he murmured, picking at the food on his plate.  “It was bound to catch up to me eventually.”  He slowly lifted a forkful of vegetables and ate them, their taste nonexistent to him.
From the side, from a far away entrance, he could hear a sudden scrambling and into view Harry came, a vampire’s hand on his mouth while his other arm locked Harry’s arms behind him as a masked wizard held his wand on him.  His green eyes were wide and confused as he stumbled over the grass.
“So, you’re really depressed that the rodent couple is coming back?” Malfoy asked, ignoring his question and not letting go of his wrist.
, Frater, we talked about this – guide us, we must still interact with you, and of course we would never think of removing Harry from you at - ”
Qye’s annoyance faded from his face as he found his eyes wandering over the familiar unfamiliar face, his eyes tracing over the high, smooth cheeks, the locks of dusty blond hair, tousled and lying simply against the pale skin. He turned his eyes back into ones he once knew so well, knew when they were angry, happy, sad, content, tired, mischievous, sleepy, irritated, amused, resigned, caring…
“Sorry. My brother doesn’t exactly…um…like being called…” she snorted and Lest glared at her. “Mister,” she finished, her voice strangled and eyes bright. Lest growled and Marylin couldn’t repress a helpless giggle.
"You know, Seamus," Harry said as he rejoined his group, alternating between flushing and paling, "I'm almost hoping your impending sense of doom is right."
“It’s not your fault,” they said at the same time and they both grinned slightly.  Hermione’s grin faded and she looked seriously at him.
Harry looked down at his hands, considering everything. They wanted him to talk. And if he didn’t, he might lose them and his heart clenched fearfully at that thought. But…Qye came into his mind.
But the objects that had interested him the most, besides the journal, had been the ring and necklace.
“Is this part of whatever weird thing is going on between you two?” asked Harry, suspicion growing on his face.  “Which,” he continued as he turned to look at Malfoy, “you still haven’t explained.”
“I think it’s bloody well established that Dumbledore has officially gone off the deep end,” Ron growled, glaring at their new schedules.
He looked up at her and gave her his own grin.  “Thank you.  I…”  He shook his head and stood up.  “Thank you.”
“Maybe he does need to go back to the Infirmary…” Ron murmured to Hermione and grunted as Harry shoved him hard as they entered the Hall. Rubbing his abused shoulder, the redhead scowled at the glowering boy. “Hey, I thought you were fine before. It’s all this dancing and lame jokes that have me concerned, alright?”
“You want to see them?” he hissed, his green eyes flashing with pain and fury.  “Go see someone die first.  Really, go Hermione, because that’s the only damn way to see them!  Yes, I’m really lucky to see them, so bloody lucky.  I’m lucky Cedric died right in front of my eyes so I could see them!  I should thank him for that, shouldn’t I?  Or maybe I should thank Voldemort for murdering him right in front of my eyes?”
“Put up your spell, magic boy,” a vampire said lazily as the others waited patiently behind the shimmer, eyes trying to connect.  He saw Ernie grunt and stumble, saw Malfoy sharply flick his wand at him to shake him loose of the telepathic attack as he had done so many times before.  “We’ll be through soon enough.”
Draco met his eyes and any hint of the smirk from earlier disappeared.  “The kind that tells me I wasn’t mistaken in asking you.”
He idly drummed his fingers on the table.  One good thing about the huge workload was that he hardly dreamed anymore.  Of course, the exhaustion didn’t stop the dark thoughts plaguing him while he was awake.  Thoughts like why Voldemort had only made two major attacks since his return and where would he strike again.  Thoughts like how much danger were his friends in now that the Dark Lord had come again.  Thoughts like what would he do when he faced his parents’ murderer again.
Five years of memories locked away, a whole other part of his personality that he had never known before.  Five years of experiences and thoughts, decisions that he never knew about.
“All right there, mate?” Seamus asked cheerfully to his left.  Harry turned his eyes to his Irish friend slowly, narrowing them when he saw the innocent expression on the sandy-haired boy’s face.  He glowered at his friend for a moment before shaking his head and turning his attention back to his dinner.  He heard Seamus snicker and Dean thwap his friend on the shoulder.
He sighed and rubbed his eyes.  There were so many things to think about.  Voldemort.  Quidditch practice.  The vampire DADA teacher.  Ron and Hermione’s concern for him.   Malfoy’s new attitude.  Schoolwork.
Jordan shared a confused look with his twin.  Looks of similar puzzlement were around the table and his cousin’s mirthless smile deepened.
“I think you keep forgetting I had you in my head for half a year, Qye,” Harry said, answering his anger with a most unimpressed look.  “You think I can’t tell when you’re trying to provoke someone?”
what people see,” Harry said desperately, grasping a corner of the desk as her strength kept moving him forward.  “I wouldn’t have even normally bothered and people already know I don’t dress like this - ”
Sirius hated that he agreed with him and hated how he sat there, unconcerned with his position, so certain of his place here.
“Remind me not to let you near any apples or spinning wheels, okay?” Qye muttered as he studied the dips and curves of the bed canopy, thinking about tomorrow, trying to predict the questions and responses he should give.
“Listen, Harry,” the sandy-haired boy said uncomfortably, his eyes not meeting Harry’s cool ones.  “I’m sorry about that.  I…I guess I kind of overreacted there.”  Seamus looked timidly up, forcing a weak grin.  Raising a hand towards Harry, he continued, “You know I was just – ”
"I like you guys," she said, gently, and even those with looks of mistrust on their face seemed convinced by the honesty of the statement.
He could guess what happened, what he didn’t understand was how it happened. Lifting his hand, he studied it, moving the fingers slowly back and forth, turning it over.
Harry immediately tuned them out, shaking his head and letting his gaze wander.  Beside him, Dean and Seamus began to place bets on who would win this argument and Neville was talking quietly to Ginny, who had just arrived.  He spared a quick smile, which she returned, blushing.  Across him, Ron and Hermione were beginning to get really heated.  They had been having little spats the entire trip, when Hermione wasn’t questioning him about his well being.  He really hoped they both finally came to their senses this year and got together or he would be forced to either hang himself or lock them in a closet.
Harry looked warily at it, still and silver in its cauldron.  He could feel Qye in the back of his eyes, looking through just as apprehensively.
“Well, to be fair, you seem to put yourself in there enough that she doesn’t have to try,” Ron smirked. Harry glowered at him.
They sat together in their usual spot in the back as the rest of their classmates hurried in, mindful of Snape’s sneer on them.  He closed the door immediately after the last Gryffindor entered – who unfortunately was Neville – almost clipping his heels.  Neville squeaked and hurried to the back, sliding into the last available seat beside Hermione, who looked reassuringly at him
The redhead grinned, most likely guessing what Harry had thought of.  “Dad told us she threw a fit when Dumbledore refused to let you come with us for the holidays because of ‘security precautions.’  She had kittens about you all break and decided to make up for it in gifts.”  He pitched his voice to imitate Molly Weasley’s.  “‘Oh, the poor boy, all alone in that big castle for two whole weeks!’  I would avoid Fred and George if I were you,” Ron snickered, his blue eyes twinkling with mirth.  “You’ll never hear the end of it.”
It pulsed bright, enveloped him in light so bright the vampires hissed and automatically stumbled back.
“Ms. Spinnet, ladies, I hope you’re all enjoying yourself,” she said as cheerfully as she could, carefully taking a step between Lest and the girls.  “And might I say you all look quite lovely tonight.”
"Well, I see these practices have been useful," Professor Opacre said cheerfully as she dusted off a trembling Daphne Greengrass and sent her to the back. Her blue eyes glanced at the clock on her desk and she sighed. "It looks like we only have time for a few more duels, maybe one really good one." She turned back to them and winked. "I expect these final duels to go well since I assume all of you have at least learned a few things, yes?"
She didn’t respond and he knew their moment of ease was gone as he watched her study the overview.  He poured them both a cup of tea as she slowly lowered herself into the armchair, turning a page, reading the daily note summaries.  He considered, for a moment, summoning the bottle of scotch he had tucked away for this very occasion and decided against it for now.  Instead, he made sure he poured enough honey and milk into her tea – just as she liked it – and carefully took the cups over to the table where she was turning to the observation notes from the week.
“It’s backed up by what happened yesterday,” Lest said emotionlessly, his eyes still not meeting hers. “And it explains why he seems so important to everyone here.” He gave a sudden harsh laugh. “Figures. I’m not surprised.”
“No, it was nothing,” he said quietly. Weasley and Granger exchanged looks and Qye cleared his throat, beginning to walk to the four House tables, a forced grin on his face. He didn’t know how he was going to deal with the rest of the Gryffindors but there was no way he could escape and no point in delaying it. “Come on, you guys want to get me back to the Infirmary, don’t -”
She stopped a foot away and her violet eyes stared hard at the top drawer, the one which contained cards from various vampire businesses, the take out menus from friendly eateries and the false bottom with the one object she had put away last year at the request of the Pater Nosferatu and his sister.
