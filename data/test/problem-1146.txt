Granger,” Draco says, his crooked smile making it sound like a friendly jab rather than a rebuttal. “We can be partners, and that’s the best I can do.”
Malfoy wasn’t in his office this morning when Harry walked downstairs. His hair is lightly mussed, his eyes soft, and he’s wearing well-worn, nicely fitting jeans and a dark blue jumper that looks as soft as a kitten’s paw. He looks like he woke up just a few minutes ago. He looks… normal. Human.
When they get back to the townhouse, Scorpius’ piano scales are echoing in the foyer, more sluggish than a week ago, but still clear and precise like birdsong. Ernestina looks around the corner of the corridor when they walk in.
“My dad helped me with those.” Luna nodded towards the windows, as though reading Draco’s thoughts. “He’s always been quite keen on beautiful architectural tricks. He built the house I grew up in. Do you remember, Draco? You came to visit once, when I was six.”
Harry had just shrugged. “I wanted to buy you something French.” Draco had huffed a laugh at that. “It’s true! And it’s also something you didn’t already have. I checked.”
Instead of pumping Harry’s cock erect, he went around Harry’s arse and felt between his cheeks with two fingers. He found his hole on the first try and pushed inside without so much as a warning.
had set his quarters at the Manor...I would manage to scavenge day-old newspapers, sometimes. I was just...I was so starved for information. I wanted to know the truth. About what was going on outside of the Manor. Outside of Hogwarts. But it was the same, constant stream of bullshit, day after day after day. I would read those papers, and the press would just write whatever the Death Eaters were feeding them. At first, I read because I needed hope—” Draco realised his hands were clenched in white-knuckled fists. He rubbed his sweaty palms over the fabric of this trousers and laughed ruefully. “Sorry; I need to find a more...politically correct introductory pitch for this thing.”
He wishes it was. It’s like someone cast a sudden Silencio in the room. It’s quiet, after the closeness of a few moments ago. Harry can feel and hear everything with frightening accuracy. The sound of Draco’s slowing breath. The thunderous thudding of his own heart in his skull.
He didn’t think of anyone in a remotely sexual way for years. After yet another polite, but very obvious offer for sex he’d received and rejected — a golden-haired young man met in a Parisian jazz club, who’d eyed him all evening and had asked Draco if he’d like to come to his flat for a drink — Draco finally realised that maybe… he wasn’t wired like everyone else.
“That's not all there is to it, though, is it? Removing a threat to one’s life isn't the same as—as finding a reason to look forward to living.”
Seeing the rest of the house, Harry would have surmised that the Malfoy heir’s private space would be as neat and tidy as his father’s. But there’s no other way to put it: Scorpius’s room looks exactly like any other kid’s room Harry has ever seen.
“Fuck, yes,” Draco says through gritted teeth, opening his eyes to find Harry staring hungrily at his face, pupils blown so wide the green has almost disappeared. “I spent
Harry gapes at Draco. “Why must you always go for the lowest blow. For fuck’s sake, Draco. We need to think about this together. It’s not you against me. I have as much to lose in it as you do.”
He turned sharply just as the two men were walking in the living room, winter cloaks casually flung over their shoulders and carrying crates filled with potted plants and boxes of seeds.
Harry swallows. In the hush of the hospital room, it’s damningly loud. He could still back out of this… but Draco is staring at him, something frantic simmering in his eyes, and Harry wants to give in.
“I could tell you exactly what you look like,” Harry whispers into the shell of his ear, the touch of his breath shooting down Draco’s spine. “I bet you’d love that, wouldn’t you?”
As though walking through a trance, Potter follows Penelope to her desk, and Draco gestures to his colleagues, teeth clenched and eyes wide.
Harry realises he’s staring at Malfoy once again. The grey eyes are downcast and hard, the jaw set and proud. In the soft, inviting light of Harry’s kitchen, he looks vulnerable and lost. Harry’s heart squeezes with a painful little jolt that has nothing to do with pity and everything to do with recognition. Harry had always thought Malfoy had it better than him at Hogwarts, but seeing just a glimpse of the constrained, pressured life he’d been forced to lead makes him reconsider that belief.
“I was just surprised,” Harry said. He looked embarrassed and Draco couldn’t fathom why. “A few years ago you would have never said that about her.”
did,” Harry growls and kisses him again. Draco wraps his arms around Harry's neck and parts his lips, and Harry dives into the kiss, his tongue sending sparks down Draco’s spine. Harry takes Draco’s face in his hands and walks him back against the desk. He kisses down Draco’s chin, along his jawline, down the sensitive side of his neck, all the while murmuring,
In response, Draco pushes his face into Harry’s palm, breathes him in. Licks along his lifeline, and Harry’s breath hitches.
“Makes you the only person in Britain, then,” Draco scoffed. Merlin, how the man had a way of pushing all of his buttons. On one occasion,
“A Prothimioscope,” Draco murmured. The bronze device gyrated slowly in his palm like a spinning-top, its rounded shape glimmering in the morning sunlight. Even after years in the Prothimioscope’s company, Draco still found it fascinating to watch. It stood perfectly straight on its axis, its rotation unnaturally slow, the physical impossibility of its movement a magic all its own.
“I’ve been hard since the moment I saw you at that fucking reunion, Potter,” Malfoy said between panting breaths.
Not like so many elves working in wizarding families all over Britain. And even then… By law, she’s not allowed to make money out of anything not related to house-keeping. If the Ministry found out about Nesting, about the profits it still makes… She could be arrested for it.”
“You said you had one last question.” Luna’s dreamy voice brought him back. Her right hand hung from her side, her fingers stroking the leaves of the Asphodel like she would a pet.
“Yeah…" Harry admits.  "And now I’ve gone and messed things up beyond belief. If word of what happened between me and Draco gets out… it’s over, Hermione. He’s done. The Ministry is waiting for a reason to launch a full-on attack. And I’m the only thing preventing it for now.”
“Well, now is as good a time as any,” Harry says, nipping at his jaw, down his throat, licking a hot trail down his collarbones.
Jeff shook his head dolefully. “Don’t thank me. I don’t know why you’re asking me this, kid,” he looked almost sad, “but whatever’s got into you... I’ve seen it before, in better demons than you, and it can’t be good.”
Malfoy was staring at him with a look unlike anything he’d ever seen on his face. Eyes wide, mouth slack and throat working, Malfoy’s usual eloquence had evaporated only to leave, in its place—something that looked like
Apparently, there are people who DON'T KNOW WHO EDITH PIAF IS. We need to remedy this situation, people. This is
“I didn’t have much choice at first, did I? My mother was on house arrest, my father was in Azkaban, our vaults had been seized by the Ministry. I had no qualifications, and no one would have hired me anyway, even after you shed a slightly less unpleasant light on me by testifying for me at the trials. Nicking shiny things kept me fed while using two of my biggest talents. And no, before you ask, Potter,” Malfoy adds with a sharp smirk, “the two talents I refer to aren’t giving amazing head and being a total dickhead to you.”
“Hope is a foolish thing to cling to in times of war, isn’t it? I soon realised it was eating me alive. More than the fear. More than the curses. More than the torture and the pain I was made to inflict and witness.
“You’ve seen my main study already. Let me show you the rest of the floor, and then there’s the kitchen and wine cellar in the basement.”
“Is it serious between you two?” Ron asks. Harry expected Ron to tease him or scold him. Instead, his expression is grave and earnest.
They walk down the stairs. “The second floor is mine,” Malfoy continues. “The layout is fairly similar to your own quarters, except that this one has a guest room across the landing.” At Harry’s questioning look, Malfoy rolls his eyes, “My ‘guests’ are no one to worry about, Potter. More often than not, it’s just my mother visiting from France.”
Harry moves again, interrupting Malfoy’s string of praise and curses and replacing it with a long, guttural moan.
Draco clenches his fists as he reaches the second floor, practically marching inside his bedroom. He takes a long, deep breath. He hears Harry’s footsteps behind him, stopping on the threshold.
“No you haven’t, you absolute bastard,” Draco whines. His hands tighten in Harry’s hair, and just the hair pulling feels so fucking good Harry’s quivering with anticipation. And, by the feel of Draco’s trembling thighs under Harry’s hands, so is he. “Merlin fuck—” Draco squirms again, his cock giving a faint throb and leaking a drop of precome. “What’re you waiting for?”
Surprised and pleased, Draco laughed. He caught Harry’s eyes across the table, over the rim of his glass of pumpkin juice. His green eyes sparkled with mirth as well as something Draco couldn’t decipher.
Draco throws his hands up in the air with a frustrated growl and stalks back to his desk. Harry’s left with Penelope half-hugging him, and four women watching him with small, knowing smiles. He squirms.
didn't come to dinner last night. Do you know who else didn't come down for dinner?” She paused dramatically. “Potter, that's who. And I heard Weasley mention to Granger that he went to bed
“You need me,” Harry breathes in response, and Draco’s trembling hand stills on the fabric of his robes. “Trust me when I say how much you’re going to need me.”
Hermione walks into the foyer, pushing the pushchair in front of her. It’s a light, compact little thing, but it’s actually indestructible. He’s seen Ron and Hermione push it around the streets of London and the dirt roads near their house alike.
Malfoy’s eyes lifted to Harry’s, slightly unfocused. Then he seemed to remember why, and he pulled his glasses out of his pocket. “Er, yes, Potter. Next reunion. In ten years?”
he cries out once more. Auror Boyle’s mouth twist into a pained grimace, and her diverted attention seems to break one of the spells — the one holding Balzac down. Without the Aurors noticing, the dog scrambles to his feet, runs and pounces on the nearest Auror with a snarl and a bark.
Draco didn't know what to do. His chest ached, a strangely beautiful kind of pain. It was worth it, to feel this, to experience the full range of human emotions, wasn’t it? He squeezed her hand in his.
Harry stepped back and he hit the kitchen island. He laughed. He was so bright and beautiful, it stole Draco’s breath away.
“I— Potter,” he says, and there’s something akin to regret in his tone. He pushes Harry off him, so gently it almost doesn’t feel like a rebuttal. “I’ve got to go.”
But Harry wouldn’t have said his name yesterday, if Draco had kissed him. And Draco wasn’t Harry's one true love: being someone’s true love implied a notion of reciprocity.
“Stealth and nosiness, huh? You’re right, Malfoy. Those are definitely not qualities required of an Auror.”
So he said: “Yes. I know. I’m deeply ashamed of the way I behaved toward you and your friends in the past. I think I’ve made it clear to you multiple times. But I realise I’ve never properly apologised to Granger, Weasley, Longbottom and so many other of my classmates. I'll make a point to do it next time the occasion arises.” He gave Harry a rueful glance. “I’m really not the best person, as you may know, Harry.”
“Malfoy,” Harry bit his lip to stifle a moan. “Either we fuck again or you drop the teasing. There’s no in-between.”
“That’s… very well thought, and quite clever,” Harry says, feeling his ears heat with the compliment he’s unwittingly paying Malfoy this time. It’s the longest they’ve talked without Malfoy breathing into Harry’s ear, or fumbling with Harry’s flies, or doing or saying anything inappropriate and devastating, so no wonder Harry’s unsettled. “Have you ever thought of collaborating with the Aurors?”
“Aye, Mistor Potter, sir!” Her hands fly to her dirty apron, dropping her whisk. It hits the floor with a clatter, splattering egg batter everywhere. “Ernestina is not expecting Mistor! Breakfast is not ready yet, sir!”
Dewey’s eyes skim the page of the diary open in front of him, so heavy with notes and writing in various ink colours that Harry’s head hurts just looking at it. He spots the time slot reserved for Harry’s meeting quickly, somewhere between a note flashing ‘IMPORTANT’ in red ink and an appointment that keeps slithering across the page, and he crosses it out with a sharp slash of his quill. Then he lifts his big blue eyes to Harry’s face and smiles.
Night had fallen around them. In the dark sky outside the window, the first stars had appeared, twinkling feebly in the shivering winter air. Trapped under Harry’s
He must obey, though. He couldn’t refuse a direct order from the Hereafter, not when it came from the Boss himself. He couldn’t
“Do you really need to be doing this here and now?” Weasley asked, gesturing with his fork, threatening to drip grease from the slice of bacon that was dangling from it. Granger swatted his hand away.
is a plant and mammal hybrid, see? I had the Magizoologist knowledge, but I needed an Herbology Master, preferably one with a rare plants specialty. My university suggested I contact Neville...and the rest is history, as people say.”
Tempting as it sounds, Harry knows one thing: he doesn’t want Malfoy to disappear between his legs — because that sounds an awful lot like hiding, and Harry’s done with hiding. He wants to
through the green flames and right under his nose. “DRACO!” she’d cackled, “I can’t believe you hired Potter to be your live-in wet dream!”
Frustrated, Draco closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. He pushed his fringe out of his eyes before returning his attention back at Luna.
As if reading Harry’s thoughts, Malfoy has the decency to turn his expression sheepish. He straightens and brushes his suit jacket, pretending to look around.
Draco strode over to the fireplace. “Beg pardon? What sort of pet—?” He flinched when he saw the tiny curled up creature softly snarling as it slept. “Oh no. Oh no no
McGonagall extended her hand towards him, both a reassuring gesture and an instruction to keep quiet. She must have seen the look of disbelief on his face.
Draco walks around a gaggle of brightly-dressed tourists stationed on the pavement across from Westminster. The abbey is beautifully illuminated for the night, its tall roof poking out of sheets of rain. Draco’s heart squeezes in his chest. Maybe a walk wasn’t a good idea; the beauty of his city is almost too much to bear in his current state of dejection. He’s terrified for his son, for Ernestina, for what will happen tomorrow when the press gets the first whiff of his arrest. The scandal they’ll no doubt construct based on a blurry photograph and a bland, ‘no comment’ statement from the Aurors. He feels lonely and helpless, surrounded by crowds of people walking down the same streets as him, his own distress completely out of their reach. Thousands of thoughts race through his mind. He’s unable to stop them and equally unable to settle on one and dissect it. There are two thoughts he’s avoided since the Aurors bound him and took him to the Ministry, and he only allows himself to go back to them when the silhouette of Buckingham Palace is behind him and the trees of Eaton Square Gardens come into view.
Draco is going to come in his pants like a bloody teenager, like his fourteen-year-old self… and he’s fine with that, he’s more than fine with that, it’s like coming full circle, all the shame and loneliness and fear he felt back then, touching himself to thoughts of Potter, finally making sense. The final proof he needed—shared, irrepressible desire. Harry’s hand wraps more firmly around him and he lets go — feels his cock twitch, feels the stupefied relief of orgasm wash over him as Harry kisses the corner of his mouth, the ring in his eyebrow, the side of his neck, murmuring almost unintelligible encouragements
Harry’s fingers slid under Draco’s belt. “Please,” he ground against his lips. “Can I please do the same to you?”
in the back of his throat, blankly eyeing the t-shirt in his hands. His throat is working and he looks like he’s about to say something. Draco picks another t-shirt from a shelf and quickly pulls it on, hiding his scarred chest and stomach from view. He gets a pair of joggers and trainers for Harry. When he looks back at Harry, the man is still staring. Draco snaps his fingers in front of him.
He never realised the way he approached sex wasn’t the way most of his classmates did, perhaps because, unlike his classmates, he
Harry takes off his coat and hands it to him. He has half a mind to ask the butler if he can visit the room where the coats are kept, but clamps his mouth shut just in time. He doesn’t want rumours about
The tree was a familiar presence in Draco’s life—this one, the previous ones, all of them. It didn’t mean he
“Mmh,” Harry said. For all the many, many times he had almost died—and the one time he actually had—he’d never thought of asking himself this question. Actually, nobody had ever thought of asking him this question. Most people walked on eggshells around him.
it — he had his daydreams about Potter, and after that he actually had Pansy — when people his age were still hoping for as much as a heated look from their crushes.
is too small a word because Malfoy’s letting Harry have this. He’s giving him this gift, instinctively knowing how much Harry needs it. And he’s so fucking beautiful like this, taut and tight and sprawled for Harry to take, that Harry loses it a bit. His hips snap forward, a brief, graceless stutter that has Malfoy’s breath catch. Then he steadies himself, takes hold of Malfoy’s hips, and picks up the pace. He’s less careful now that he’s seen Malfoy take it.
Malfoy stares at him for a second, seemingly at a loss for words. Then his mouth twists in a small smile — the first one Harry’s seen on him.
with my clients and their families. I become close to them, I even usually move in with them. Most of the time it’s a twenty-four hour, seven days a week job, so I want to be around all the time in case I’m needed. Which is why I obviously can’t work with people I don’t respect, people I don’t want to be around, even in a professional manner. And the thing is—” Harry pauses, fakes embarrassment. “I…
They must have been in touch for weeks. Hermione had clearly jumped on the opportunity to contact Draco as soon as Harry’d told her she could. But she’s not just here to talk business. She’s here because, from all appearances… Draco has come to
the last fortnight wanking to thoughts of you, you beautiful bastard.” Harry lets a strangled moan and Draco continues, spurred on by the effect his words have on Harry. “I could barely function – almost ran my company to the ground for you.” He slides his hands to Harry’s arse for good measure, grabs so hard he’s sure he’s leaving bruises.
The memory is always with him, lancing and bittersweet. He goes to a few fundraisers and galas, hoping to find Malfoy picking the pockets of champagne-drinking crowds or stealing wallets from unsupervised cloakrooms. He returns empty-handed from his search every time. Event after Malfoy-less event, Harry’s already-low enthusiasm wanes, so much that Ron and Hermione notice.
Ron is watching him, eyes narrowed. Always the Auror, even off duty. “I don’t think you’re telling us everything, though.” Harry’s reactions aren’t fast enough for him to avoid looking caught. Ron leans closer, intent. “Spill it. There’s something else, isn’t it?”
Luna settled in her green armchair with a contented sigh, as though this was a friendly conversation and not the most nerve-racking interview Draco had conducted in recent memory.
There  were days, though, when Draco was utterly bored of being a Hogwarts student. He didn’t know why the bosses insisted on putting him on wizarding school assignments over and over again. It was true that over time, he’d come to specialise in minor acts of bullying. Whether it was personal preference or force of habit wasn’t clear anymore. He’d lost track of the career path that led him here.
And the time when he’s been squeezed against Potter in the morning rush of the Ministry lifts, and had to walk with a manila folder held in front of his crotch for a good fifteen minutes. Beyond that… he’d never given any indication of being interested in Potter. No more than the rest of the wizarding world, anyway. Everybody still fawned over Potter, all the time, always. If anything, the fawning had intensified after the press had announced Potter’s breakup with Ginny Weasley for reasons left unexplained, shrouding the man in an even more opaque layer of mystery.
Malfoy turns his back to Harry, tossing the tin foil container in the bin under the sink and washing his fork. Harry’s gaze travels down the long line of Malfoy’s back. His movements are deft, strong shoulders jutting under the cashmere jumper, dark jeans hugging the pert curves of his arse. God, Malfoy’s so— infuriating. So… gorgeous. Harry wants to drape himself over Malfoy’s back like a snug blanket. Wants to push up against him and bend him over the sink—
“Yes, I do have days where it’s harder to shut the memories out. Yes, I still have nightmares. Yes, sometimes I wish I didn’t have to live through what I’ve lived through. It’s made me who I am. But it’s only
“Give me,” Draco says through clenched teeth, leaning in, “one reason. One reason not to kill you. Or worse, send you back to your precious Ministry to carry on with your pitiful life.”
“As soon as you can move in,” Malfoy says. “The whole upper floor of the house will be yours for the duration of your employment.”
“Got a taste for it, did you? Can’t blame you. I’ve been told I’m quite good. Have you thought about it a lot?”
“Yes,” Draco says quietly. He looks up at Harry from under his lashes, his face still in Harry’s palm. “We said that when you come back…” He swallows, looks for his next words. “I’m done waiting. I’m ready. ” He wraps his fingers around Harry’s wrist, nuzzles at his palm. “I want you,” he confesses, eyes shut.
“Yes. I’ve been thinking about it for a while. I’d like to work with him and his R&D team to test joint wizarding and Muggle cures. There are still so many diseases that Muggles and magical people have not yet managed to tackle on their own. Until recently, the Unspeakables were not open to the idea of taking inspiration in Muggle science in general, or in the field of medicine and magical maladies specifically. But I think it would be an incredible opportunity. No other company in the wizarding world has the R&D power that Caduceus has. Or reputation, or morals.
Potter gave a humourless little snort that went straight to Draco’s cock. “All right. You think my life is so much better than yours? You think you’d rather be a professional Quidditch player in the limelight than a high-ranking Gringotts director?”
Inside, standing close to the door, Harry counts two Aurors — Auror Corie Boyle, her Senior Auror golden shoulder pads gleaming in the dim light, and a young man Harry’s never seen before. They both have their wands drawn and pointed towards the back of the room. In front of them, a tall figure dressed in a nondescript suit is pacing, and Harry contains an outraged growl when he recognises Zacharias Smith. He’s going restlessly back and forth the width of the room, his hands behind his back, his face red, a disturbed glee shining on his features.
“All right.” He slaps the folder on the Minister's desk. “I’m going to need all the information you have on Draco Malfoy.”
Hermione let out a breath. “I was surprised as well, at first,” she said. “And then after I gave it some thought... I wasn’t.”
“Oh, real smooth, Malfoy,” Harry muttered from the corner of his mouth. His shoulders shook with repressed laughter. His muted glee shone a new meaning on Draco’s words. Draco felt his face heat.
She stopped and glanced at the Prothimioscope that was still spinning and buzzing cheerily on the carpet. The hot atmosphere from a few moments ago had turned to ice against Draco’s skin, the air frozen in his lungs. He swallowed thickly. Fingers trembling, he shifted through his question cards, hoping to find a way to regain his composure.
But he knew the answer to this question as he marched towards Malfoy with the hungry focus of a Niffler running towards a stack of gold.
And then there was Draco, who had been kicked out of the Manor and the family vaults after Lucius ran into him, tie undone and Marcus Flint balls deep inside his arse, in the cloakroom of the Wizarding National Gallery gala.
“I never said— ‘experiment,’” Harry manages through clenched teeth. Jesus, what if he comes from this — just from Malfoy’s hand on his cock — and then Malfoy leaves, and the night is over? “You’re the one who used that word.”
“At least we’re safe,” Harry observed after a long stretch of silence during which all Malfoy did was rake trembling fingers through his hair while Harry stared. Even though the small cabin was perfectly weather-proof, they could hear the storm shaking the branches of the trees outside, howling at their door. Spadefuls of snow were already blocking the slits of the shutters, the little hope they had for natural light diminishing by the minute.
“Duly noted,” Potter answers absently, as Draco follows the retreating group and closes the door behind them. He seals it with a discreet
She stepped back, a hurt look on her face. “I refuse to apologise for actually having done the maths on the night of the Battle! Give away one person, save hundreds. I’m not saying it was an easy conversation, but Neville understands. And so does Harry, incidentally. I’m not the only
Harry’s effortless good looks and their effect on Draco only fed his simmering annoyance. Draco took a deep breath.
“It was pretty amazing for me, too.” Harry hadn’t intended to blurt such a truth, especially not in front of Draco Malfoy. But now that it’d been said, he couldn’t bring himself to regret it. The loneliness, the sense of being apart from the rest of the world, the sense of being wanted for whatever people saw when they looked at him—it had lifted in the past hour he’d spent with Malfoy.
“Like I said, I pick my clients based on affinity. Affinity for the job they offer, but also for who they are. I get a lot of offers. The jobs range from pop stars to politicians, from foreign dignitaries to arms dealers to terrorist groups… sometimes it’s just wealthy people — some of whom have very questionable backgrounds. I refuse most jobs. And I always refuse the ones that, er… clash with my values. I work
“Oh, but I wants to, Mistor Greg,” Ernestina wrings her hands, her huge brown eyes already swimming with tears. “Ernestina is going to be missing Mistor Greg a lot.”
“I think—” Potter lifts his hand, reaches for Draco’s face. He hesitates. Asks, “Can I?” Draco gives a minute nod. Harry slides his fingers in Draco’s fringe, tucks his hair behind his ear. Draco stands motionless, breathless, as Potter’s thumb lingers on the ring at the top of his ear, stills on his cheekbone.
Draco’s stomach flips at Harry’s words. It’s so intense sometimes… Draco struggles not to shove Harry away just so he can have a minute to catch his breath. Face heating, he scrambles for a change of topic. Back to the auditors.
“What else do you want?” Malfoy says, hot breath on Harry’s cheek. “Not that this isn’t enough for me… but you wanted to experiment.”
Someone clears their throat in the doorway, and all heads snap to Ernestina, her hands crossed in front of her neatly pressed pink blouse.
The dog barks happily before bouncing down the corridor again. Pansy swipes a hand down her dress — a lovely, fitted striped thing that looks like it cost a fortune and, quite luckily, remains unmarred by Balzac’s enthusiastic attention — and shakes her head at Harry. “It’s
“Sorry, mate. But you being Harry Potter is exactly why we think you’re the right agent to put on the case.”
Malfoy shifts slightly, and the back of his hand brushes Harry’s. It’s imperceptible, almost; a halo of warmth against Harry’s knuckles. But it’s there. Harry can feel it, and he knows, with a certainty that sends his heart racing, that Malfoy’s touch is deliberate.
Harry doesn’t rise to the sarcasm. Eyes on Malfoy’s face, he says, truthfully: “I only just recently discovered that… a wife might not be what I’m looking for.” And he watches with fascination as Malfoy stares back at him with wide eyes.
With a sigh, he gets himself ready. He’d been expecting this moment. It won’t be easy, but he won't lose his composure. He may be different from the boy he was twelve years ago, but he’s still a Malfoy.
It’s fucking unfair. Draco, this whole situation is fucking unfair. You deserve… God, you deserve so much better than what you’re getting.”
For a moment, they just look. The silence stretches on, and still Harry can’t tear his gaze away from Malfoy’s. His brain desperately searches for a topic of conversation. Which is ridiculous, because Malfoy hired Harry to be his bodyguard. Not his conversation partner.
“They can’t hear me,” Jeff said hastily. “You’re a demon, I’m a demonic pet, we can communicate.” He shook Draco’s bootlaces again. “C’mon, Draco, hurry! The ravens have been following me around. They know I'm helping you. You have to do something!”
As if impressed by Harry’s deduction, Malfoy grins wider. His white teeth gleam, and Harry feels an involuntary thrill zinging up his spine.
“How do you feel this is going so far?” He asked, nodding towards his mother and Andromeda deep in conversation.
Harry thinks wryly — a shaggy brown rug, and a bookshelf containing a mismatched collection of Muggle and wizarding fiction.
“That’s not— not at all—” Potter stammers, then exhales sharply, frowning. “You keep doing this… thing. The bending over. When… I’m around.”
“Will you stop?!” Draco interrupts. He blows on his fringe, sending his white-blond hair flying. Harry’s starting to find that little tic of his weirdly sexy. Draco holds out a hand for Harry, who takes it and hauls himself from off the floor. “We were
“I can’t give too many details about my job, but let’s just say I specialise in the field of Healing research for the Ministry.”
So they’d ended up with new books to read. They’d agreed to work on it that afternoon after class. Draco had many other,
Harry moved into his space. “You can be a part of it. You can be a part of my future, every step of the way. As long as you feel like you have enough room within it to build your own.”
“I told you the truth about me — I’m the spy. I’m only supposed to find information. I’m not the instigator — I’m the Trojan horse.”
So here you go. The final proof. I really am as ridiculously stupid as you’ve always thought, Potter.”
“There’s really nothing to be said about it…” Harry had shaken his head at Draco’s frown. “Not tonight, anyway.”
“Nothing happened.” Out loud in the hush of the kitchen, Draco repeated the words he’d spoken two years ago.
“I thought they’d hate me,” Draco mumbled, overwhelmed by Harry’s words, by his warm presence, by the heavy scent of the wool coats surrounding them. “I thought they’d hate me until she hugged me.”
“We’re wizards, though. You can use a quick fitting charm on my clothes, and it’ll be like brand new running gear.”
He knows he shouldn’t. But when has he ever been able to resist his curiosity, when it came to Malfoy?
He looks around, cataloguing every little detail: a few pictures scattered among wall-length shelves otherwise filled with books, a balanced mix between wizarding and Muggle from what Harry can tell; a gleaming, lacquered grand piano, lid closed. Several shelves on the wall in the back are filled with what looks like hundreds of vinyl records.
Pansy had fallen back into her chair, waving her hand dismissively. “Whatever. I give up. If not even Potter’s presence can entice you, you’ll just have to come to keep me and Blaise company.” Draco’d opened his mouth in protest, but Pansy had stopped him with an imperious glare. “I
It was a veritable jungle, barely contained by the walls and windows. Draco’s feet stopped of their own accord at the threshold of the room. Once again, he found himself at a loss for words.
“That is all very lovely, Mistor Draco and Mistor Potter, sirs. But Ernestina sees all the food is gone. Shall Ernestina brings Mistor his birthday cake?”
“Umph,” he groaned. Malfoy’s body covered his like a blanket, and Harry wished he could revel in the sensation just a little longer. Surely Malfoy would notice that Harry
“Don’t apologise. Especially not for giving me the mind-blowing orgasm I so deserved for putting up with you all night.” When Harry opens his eyes, Malfoy’s smirking down at him. There’s a fond glow to it, though, and Harry smiles back. “You’re welcome to fuck me anytime I request it.”
He’s on the third and last floor of the house. His first room is a small, cosy study. It’s furnished with a desk, a comfortable chair, a squashy green sofa —
to improve your level of commitment to the Cause,” Mephistopheles continued, raising his voice, “they’re going to crack down on you and it won’t be pretty.”
“Of course not, Saint Potter. Though I seem to remember that you weren’t so perfect either. I couldn’t show up anywhere in this damn school without you and your gang staring daggers at me. It wasn’t so pleasant either, believe it or not.”
he heard Malfoy above him. He sounded breathless. “I’m going to make you feel so good.” The hand on Harry’s side withdrew, and Harry felt Malfoy pat the floor around them.
about (if that’s even what Harry had been doing, back in the day, anyway). It’s just that… well. It’s just that it’s almost as if Malfoy is
And it might be scary — the scariest thing he’s ever felt, and that includes years of war against Voldemort — but he’s fallen too hard to let him go.
“For God’s sake, Malfoy, will you listen? That wasn’t what I meant. I was — I am just. Baffled. Moved. I wasn’t expecting this and… and your son is really something, isn’t he? Taking his piano skills into consideration or not. You’re going to have to stop being so on edge, and actually listen to what I’m saying before you jump down my throat.”
“Would you say diving into the massive task that awaited you after the war helped you move on, then?”
Harry mutters a lubricating charm and slides his slick fingers along Draco’s crease, slathering lube between his cheeks, unmindful of the mess dripping down Draco’s thighs. Draco feels him move away from him a fraction of a second, then, without a warning, the tip of Harry’s cock is pressing into him. Harry puts his hand on the back of Draco’s neck and keeps him down, face against the glass desktop, almost mean. He doesn’t give Draco time to adjust to it: with a grunt, he slides all the way in. Draco cries out, squirms under Harry’s hands, but Harry doesn’t relent. Draco asked him to fuck him rough, and Harry’s nothing if not a man of his word. Harry starts thrusting in and out, groaning, already lost in it. His cock feels so fucking fat, taking Draco from behind with barely any preparation, and Draco starts pushing back onto Harry with needy little whines. It hurts, just a bit — but that’s what he’d asked for, wasn’t it? He closes his eyes, his cheek hot against the cool glass, Harry’s hands sliding to grip his hips tighter and move him up and down his cock. It’s dirty and raw and unlike any of the sex they’ve had before, and when Harry comes, Draco’s still so tight he can feel the heat of Harry’s come as his cock throbs, filling Draco’s arse with it. Harry’s thrusts slow down then, his fingers loosening their grasp on Draco’s hips. He rocks into Draco, once, twice, leans over his back, his hot breath caressing Draco’s sweaty nape. Just when Draco’s certain Harry is going to try to kiss him again, start whispering sweet, mindless confessions of love again, Harry stands and pulls out so fast Draco gasps.
A certain Gryffindor prat who, as of yesterday, he was supposed to remove from the surface of the earth.
Draco plunged after them, eyes scanning the Quidditch pitch in the hopes of making up for his momentary absence. Unable to locate the Snitch, he shook his head and steered his broom up, spiralling upwards and closer to Harry. While being close to Harry probably wasn’t the best idea for his concentration, it also increased his chances of leveling the field with the person who’d once been his arch-nemesis and his undefeated rival on the pitch.
“Come on,” he says with a cheeky half-smile. “I need my bodyguard with me when I run.” And together they jog down the wet pavement towards the entrance of the park.
“Er, apologies, Luna, but if that’s the only thing they told you…I ought to be more transparent about what the interview entails.”
I can’t help it when you’re sitting here looking all proper and professional, with your glasses and your notes and your rugged good looks.
Ernestina goes, and Harry is left alone in the bright foyer, a large, friendly Bernese wagging his tail against his ankles.
“We were just about to,” Luna said, cheerful and seemingly unaware of the tense atmosphere. “Draco was telling me about the Prothimioscope and how he came to invent it. If only we had this back when the
He can feel Malfoy’s frown in the dark. “It wouldn’t be going public. Just telling my friend about the amazing sex I just had.”
“Like that, do you?” he whispers against Harry’s neck, nipping at his earlobe. Harry nods frantically into his shoulder.
Harry was in the kitchen, rinsing his hands under the tap. He had dirt under his fingernails from working in the garden with Longbottom all afternoon. He looked cozy and at home, and Draco’s heart ached at the sight.
“Perhaps,” McGonagall added, “your father had plans for you. I can imagine that his plans have fallen through. However, given your outstanding marks throughout your education here at Hogwarts, and the improved behaviour I have noticed since the beginning of this year, I have no doubt you have a brilliant professional future ahead of you, should you give it proper thought.”
for Merlin’s sake. He'd done hundreds of interviews, written hundreds of articles in his career. Just get in, ask the questions he had prepared, have Dennis come in later to snap a few pictures for the cover, and leave. Lovegood was the last interview of the series. He’d interviewed
Harry shifted and turned his back to Draco, his hands on the butcher block and his bare arse in the air.
“No, I think that was all,” Harry said hastily, smoothing the front of his uniform as he moved to leave. Thank Merlin for ample Auror robes. Just staring at Malfoy’s eyes, dark with promise, was enough to make him painfully hard. He couldn’t let Head Auror Smith notice he was hot for his Auror partner—well, not so soon, anyway.
Then Malfoy gets to work, and it’s every bit as sinfully glorious as Harry remembers. Music swells around him. A black-clad swan spins on the stage. Around them, nobody notices Harry’s soft moans and muffled gasps, Malfoy’s blond head bobbing between Harry’s parted legs. Nobody but Malfoy, who lays a hand on Harry's thigh as if to brace himself. Harry holds on to dear life on one armrest, and meets Malfoy’s unconscious touch with his other hand, twining his fingers with Malfoy’s.
There have already been too many times where he forgot his purpose. Too many times where his conversations with Draco started from an entirely genuine place. Too many open, unguarded looks exchanged between them. Too many reasons to care far too much about what happens to Draco…
With a groan, Harry lets go of their cocks, lifts off from Draco’s body, sits back on his heels. From where Draco is lying on the sofa, he gets an unimpeded view of Harry’s body, slick with sweat, his hard, ruddy cock jutting forward, untouched. And then Harry smiles at him slowly —
He brought his hand to his ear in surprise. Harry smiled and delicately pried his hand away. He kept Draco’s hand in his, bringing it down on the sofa. He shook his head and mouthed, “Listen,” as if Draco could pay attention to anything when Harry’s hand was covering his. If this wasn’t distracting enough, the lyrics were utterly incomprehensible: they were a jumble of words and references—Muggle, no doubt—that Draco lacked the knowledge to understand.
“Yes,” Harry hissed, letting go of Malfoy’s hair and guiding his hand to the bulge of his aching erection. Malfoy’s hand cupped him through his trousers and he heard his breath catch against his neck. Carefully, they both breathed again.
The lift doors ding open on the top floor. Draco pushes off Harry with a goofy grin. He does a little bow.
He sat between Harry’s legs and let his gaze roam up and down his body, Harry’s hard, aching cock already leaking copiously across his stomach.
“Don’t forget about the Christmas Feast,” Luna Lovegood reminded them. “It’s always my favourite moment of the year. It feels like being surrounded by a big family.”
The thing was... Draco had always known he had a preference for humans who came in a shape similar to his. He had heard there were demons out there who specialized in mongering hate against people who did.
He leaned closer. “And are those my platinum cufflinks?” Tamara was peering up at Draco now with obvious interest. He smiled weakly at her.
“The Mediwitches at the Ward told me — Ernestina was too upset to think of mentioning anyone but Scorpius.”
Malfoy shoves at Harry’s shoulders. Harry falls back against the coats, taking Malfoy down with him, the rack shaking under their combined weight.
to lose, Potter. Ernestina could lose her job, her freedom. I could lose my company. I wouldn’t be able to properly care for my son. You? You’d lose
Harry gave a theatrical shudder. “Merlin help us.” He took a book from the pile on Draco's lap. “Here. Let me help. I can read this one and you read the others. We'll go faster that way.”
Draco lifts an eyebrow. In the half-darkness, his sarcastic expression looks almost cruel. “An outstanding citizen? Is that what you call your shags?”
Draco’s stomach dropped. He set his tea cup on the counter, his hands slow and clumsy, and it rattled against the wood.
the chance to buy fancy drinks for his best friend. Hell, he even has a promotion to celebrate tonight. Commanding in his brand new Senior Auror uniform, Ron is the embodiment of serene success. By contrast, all Harry has going on for himself is an untucked shirt and black hair that seems to grow messier as years go by. Not only is Harry an idler, he’s an unkempt one at that.
Wingardium Leviosa.” Smith’s body lifts up, and she brings him closer with another wave of her wand. They start marching Draco and a sobbing Ernestina out of the study, Smith floating limply behind them. Scorpius is still lying on the floor, his big brown eyes fixed on his father as he walks towards the door, and Harry wants to scream, wants to turn time and stop it all before it happened—
“I’ll see you tomorrow?” he’d murmured, nipping at Draco’s neck. Draco had pushed into the touch, biting back a whimper.
“I tried to be an Auror. It just… wasn’t for me.” Harry picks at a stray grain of rice, gathering his own things off the table. “Maybe it was too close to the end of the war. Maybe I had too much to deal with on my own. I couldn’t get into the discipline that Auror training required of me. I didn’t pay attention in class; my mind drifted constantly. I was late almost every single day. Sleeping through my alarms—”
Draco laughs mirthlessly. “You don’t even have a warrant.” It’s not the first time he’s said that, judging by his cold resignation. Harry sees the Auror fidget uncomfortably at that. By the looks of it, they didn’t know about it until they got here, either. “You don’t have anything on me. I don’t owe you anything.”
the bloody Snitch?” Ron Weasley flew by, his freckled nose wrinkled in exasperation. Exasperation, not animosity, Draco noted. “Pay attention, will ya?” Weasley flew off to chase the Quaffle, followed by Blaise, who was on their side of the team this time.
“Well…” Harry started. He resisted the urge to rub the back of his neck. “If you wanted… We could, you know. I wouldn’t be opposed,
“I see you every day, and there’s something about you…” Potter starts walking closer, “... something about you that just…” Closer, closer. “... just
Draco sat back in the armchair behind him and marvelled at her, at the thin translucent wings the colour of Scottish heather.  He tentatively stroked her scales and they felt smooth, almost pebbly. She made a cute burbling noise and then curled her tail around Draco's wrist like a scaly Slytherin bracelet. It felt sort of possessive like when Ron’s newborn Rose gripped his finger. Tamara snuggled her snout into Draco’s palm and began to lick it with her rough, dry tongue. Tiny, dainty, fastidious licks, this way and that, that made his eyes prickle with tears.
There had been a heavy emotional moment when they’d all sat around the table. The unfamiliar configuration of Tonkses, Malfoys and Potters emphasized the absence of family members—husbands, daughters, fathers—from all sides. It had hit Draco more bluntly than ever before: for all that he’d loved this life more than all the others, the people around the table were
“Draco…” he says, strangled. Draco smells like clean sweat and sex and expensive honeysuckle soap and everything Harry’s come to love and depend upon. His arms wrap around Harry, sway him gently.
“Sorry,” Harry muttered, abashed. “Care to turn on the light? It’s darker than Voldemort’s arsehole in here.”
“As I was telling Mr Potter just before you arrived, Draco, I came here for your birthday,” she says. “I wanted to see you — and my darling Scorpius, of course. However, I can book a room at the Dorchester if my presence is going to be of any inconvenience.”
Draco feels his face heat with anticipation. Harry waves his hand and casts a wordless, wandless cleaning spell over their spent bodies. It tickles, warm and pleasant, and Draco lifts his head to look at him. Harry is studying him now, the serious, guarded, almost guilty expression from earlier tonight back on his face. His hand comes to rest on Draco’s chest and he traces light, thoughtless patterns on his skin.
Slowly, Harry lets go of Malfoy. He lifts himself off his body, backs away. “I’m sorry, Malfoy. I didn’t mean to imply you were.”
Harry braced his hands against the countertop and rammed back into Draco. “Will you touch me?” He sounded on the verge of begging. “Your hands on me...I need—”
At the end of that first week, Harry sends Ron and Kingsley a precise timetable of Draco’s activities and of those of everyone working closely with Draco. Given that nothing suspicious has come forth yet, he imagines that, should worst come to worst and Draco is proven clean, the timetables will be a possible exhibit of innocence.
His name sounds good spoken in Malfoy’s posh accent, and Harry notes, surprised and a little pleased, that Malfoy’s cheeks are pinker.
And so Draco folds himself onto the sofa, pulls Harry by the belt until he’s standing between Draco’s open legs. He shivers when he looks up at Harry. There’s something overwhelmed, almost painful in Harry’s face. When he reaches down to cup Draco’s cheek, slide his thumb over a cheekbone, Draco closes his eyes.
He puts a foot in front of the other, stretches out his long leg, and folds in a graceful arc, bending over to catch the quill between his fingers.
“Gay sex lesson number one, Potter,” he says, whipping out his wand. “Pull your cock out when there’s still time
Harry snorted then seemed to think better of it. Draco realised his mistake, too late to do anything about it: mentioning Headmasters, however mental they could have been, had to rank high on the scale of bad decisions coming from Draco. He had tried to murder one of them, after all. He looked away, feeling the heat of mortification prickle the back of his neck. “I’m sorry,” he murmured, his words floating in the silence of the corridor.
“They haven’t found out for years. They won’t find out now.” Draco studies Harry with narrowed eyes. “Unless you snitch.”
Draco swallowed audibly. Harry looked up at him, his green eyes gleaming and an impish grin on his lips.
On Saturday morning, when Harry steps into the kitchen, he finds Draco’s house-elf already busy cooking breakfast, the kitchen table and countertops a mess of pans, wooden spoons, whisks, coffee grounds and cracked eggshells.
and when Harry turns it over in his hands, he finds out it’s an original first edition. He gingerly puts it back and selects another one a few rows over, a recording of the 2002 performance of
“Of course,” Draco hastened to say. “Perfectly understandable. Thank you for helping us in the first place.”
“Well, this is a charm that doesn’t require any wandwork,” Draco tells her with a half-smile, “at least not until you’ve
“That’s not fair.” Lavender elbows Gabrielle lightly in the side. “She’s hotter than you, Draco. She could just stand there doing nothing and she’d still be hotter than all of us combined.”
“Convoluted, indeed.” Draco sighs and leans into him. “You wouldn’t even be here if Smith wasn’t so obsessed with me. If they weren’t
Draco stood still, his eyes searching Harry’s. He hoped, a bit hysterically, that Harry was pulling his leg. All he could find in his eyes was the same legendary, infuriating earnestness.
Greg stomps across the room and settles on the chair across from Draco’s desk. It’s a beautiful antique that Draco salvaged from the Manor years ago, upholstered with soft, satiny grey silk. Half of the seat and back are covered with drawings of dragons, unicorns, and stars, a reminder of Draco’s son’s first attempts at figurative art and all the more perfect for it.
A small part of Harry, the undercover agent part, the part that he’s slowly starting to regret, awards him a gold star for this sudden surge of sincerity that serves to build trust with his main suspect.
He sees her bushy head lean above the banister. She has that concerned expression on her face again.
Speaking of arses, a sudden gust of wind had just whipped through Malfoy’s burgundy, standard-issue Auror cloak and exposed his shapely posterior for Harry to admire. Malfoy might be an uptight arsehole, but he was also annoyingly fit. A fact that was harder and harder for Harry to ignore each passing day, as he subtly observed Malfoy laughing with their Auror colleagues at the Ministry cafeteria, striding through the Auror department corridors like a young prince perusing his future kingdom, or brushing his hand through his short, stylish, impossibly blond hair when he was absorbed in case reports.
Draco thinks of being eleven, holding out his hand, hoping for the best — and seeing his offer for friendship turned down in the most humiliating way.
The piece is a long one — Scorpius is maybe playing for a full five minutes — but Harry loses track of time. The music ends in a flourish of triplets, Scorpius hunched over the keyboard, tongue poking out in concentration, a sheen of sweat brimming along his hairline.
Draco clapped his hands, mock relieved. “That’s the title of my ad at the matrimonial agency. So much better. I truly am a catch! How do the single gentlemen of Britain not know?”
This wasn’t going to be pleasant. But if Draco had learned anything over the course of a hundred lives, it was that what didn’t kill you... made you a more experienced demon.
Ron’s in the cloakroom. And he doesn't sound like tipsy Ron, either; he has his Senior Auror voice on. Did he hear anything? Did he come here because he thought Harry’s disappearance was suspicious?
Scorpius rises from his seat and runs — “Nestine!” he calls, — past Malfoy, and out of the room. Balzac barks and dashes after him.
“I’ll leave you young people to help my son celebrate,” she says, retiring for the night. “I had a lovely time.” The word ‘lovely’ seems out of place in her mouth, like she’s at a loss for a more accurate description. Perhaps she is: Harry doubts dinners at Malfoy Manor were ever so… relaxed. There are smears of sauce and wine across the white tablecloth; Blaise is leaning his chair on two legs as he sips his drink with a contented air; Pansy licks the chocolate off her fingers; Hermione scribbles notes in a notepad she produced from Merlin knows where; and Ron’s eyes are slowly closing. Draco’s cheeks are pink, and Harry wouldn’t trade this evening for anything else.
Ten years after the war and he still fights the beginning of a panic attack every time he has to cross that fucking Atrium to meet with Kingsley.
Draco wasn’t one to back down from a challenge thrown his way by Harry Potter, no matter the complications it would bring.
On the floor, on their left, Harry sees the immobile form of Balzac, eyes wide and terrified, trapped under a Petrificus Totalus
Indeed, Narcissa and Andromeda were sitting with their heads leaned close together. Draco couldn’t hear the content of their conversation, but he could tell by the rapid-fire words and the conspiratorial looks that the two sisters were taking great pleasure in catching up.
Draco’s head snaps up. Harry can tell he’s trying to school his features into his usual prickly sneer and failing miserably.
“Draco Malfoy has been in the Ministry’s sights for quite some time now, Harry. As you may or may not be aware, the man has built a literal empire with Caduceus over the course of just a few years. That isn’t a problem in itself. What poses question, however, is the
those people are, it’s a necessary process for big companies.” Malfoy turns to look at Harry. “Don’t let their official stance fool you. They’re only allowed access to designated areas of Caduceus offices, and they’re of course not allowed to bother me or the company’s personnel more than their official duties permit. Any stepping out of line, and you, as security, are definitely welcome to push back.”
“When Dr Dawson first met Scorpius, she was saying, ‘Scorpius needs a trained nanny, a special nanny who is knowing how to work with
“The Barbican firecalled. Their conservatory is having trouble with a couple of Ginger Lilies. Apparently, they’re not as Muggle as they’d believed.”
Harry sits across from Malfoy while Malfoy rolls his shoulder once, twice, seems to decide that either his spells have worked or his ‘injury’ wasn’t so dire to begin with, and pulls a tin container towards him.
Draco shifts his eyes away. “Yes.” His throat feels tight. He wants Harry to take him in his arms again. To take him, and make him forget. “Just… promise me.”
I managed to say the names of five vegetables during our staff meeting this morning and Harry chimed in and added three more, so technically Team Aurors wins one more round.
“I love him,” he confessed quietly, his breath escaping him in a white cloud. “It’s amazing. It’s terrifying. I think... I think he likes me. But he doesn’t
With a breathless laugh, Malfoy took his cock in his hand and pushed the fat head of it inside Harry’s arse.
“Be nice, Potter,” Penelope says when she passes by him. “I have no qualms kicking your arse if you so much as touch one strand of Draco’s hair — Boy Who Lived or not.”
“It was in the agenda,” Draco had rolled his eyes and reminded Harry half an hour before the first guests were due. He’d been standing in front of the full-length mirror in his bedroom, fixing his tie — the silver one with green snakes, the one Harry secretly favoured for bringing out the silver hues of Draco’s eyes.
Well. I don’t know exactly what Malfoy did to Harry the other day, when he put eyeliner on him down in his lab, but Harry came back with pink cheeks, wearing a big, deranged smile. He was a mess, I’m telling you. I swear he stared at the wall across his desk for a good half hour.
“Be like what?” He gestures at himself, up and down his outfit for the day — a long-sleeved, dark green t-shirt, right sleeve rolled up; dark jeans, ripped at the knees; high-rise combat boots, studded with silver. The rainbow badge, gleaming under the office’s neon lights. “Say it, Potter. Say what it is about me that bothers you so much.”
A burst of laughter and tipsy conversation filters through the layers of cloaks. Harry’s heart jumps in warning. Other people. Guests of the charity ball coming to collect their cloaks.
Fighting a winning smile, Draco said sweetly, “Oh, I understand, Jeff dearest. Unfortunately, Father would be terribly cross if I happened to misplace his family’s signet ring, you see.”
“Ah. I’m not sure I remember who that is,” Harry says, relieved that he’s making contact with the child and unable to pinpoint why.
There’s sudden, deafening silence in the study — Harry barely hears the wounded Auror’s curses and laboured breath, barely hears the broken pieces of glass clatter to the hardwood floors. His mind is blank, a loud buzzing in his ear. His eyes frantically roam the room, searching for casualties. At one end of the study, Draco is on the floor, on his stomach, his hands over the back of his head. His back rises and falls.
“Careful… that’s her ‘about to give you a lecture’ face,” Harry mutters, and everyone giggles — except for Narcissa who’s trying to conceal her bewilderment behind the most neutral face Harry’s ever seen on her. Hermione rolls her eyes, undeterred, and launches in an explanation.
Malfoy’s hot breath hits Harry’s cheek as he speaks, but Harry keeps looking resolutely straight ahead. Every one of his nerve endings sings with Malfoy’s attention; with the minute, purposeful movements of his fingers now twined with Harry’s on the armrest.
and jumps on Blaise first, wagging his tail and slobbering over his jacket. Harry and Pansy snap out of their strained moment and exchange a quick glance.
you’re familiar? Nobody could be that… blond. With a face that pointy. And an accent that posh. And legs that skinny.
Harry half-nods, half-shrugs. He wouldn’t call himself a fan. When it comes to culture, he often feels like he’s just begun to glimpse the tip of a very big, very daunting iceberg. So far, his self-educated approach to art has consisted in sorting it into two groups: the art that’s easy to like, and the art that requires more work from him.
But Potter doesn’t look like he’s extending a challenge. Potter doesn’t look like he’s thinking of anything at all. With a blank look and a short nod in Draco’s direction, he all but runs for the door, receipt file tucked under his arm, Auror cape flying, the tips of his ears pink.
They kiss, all tongues and hands and hips pushing into each other. Thank Merlin it’s past eight o’clock, because this kiss definitely isn’t the quick-little-kiss-in-a-work-lift kind. Draco has half a mind to hit the emergency button and stop the lift so he can ravage Harry’s face properly, but he remembers he has other plans upstairs. Which include ravaging Harry’s face, too, but also. Showing him the news. Celebrating.
Harry wakes up every morning at six. He gets up, showers, gets dressed for the day based on Draco’s instructions from the day before — suit and tie if they’re going to the Caduceus offices; a casual jeans-and-jumper outfit on the days when Harry brings Scorpius to his therapy appointments, or when Draco plans to work from home. Then he quietly goes downstairs to the kitchen and fixes himself a cuppa and a quick bacon sandwich, which he eats standing, hip propped against the kitchen counter. By the time he’s done, he can hear Draco coming out of his bedroom and down the stairs to go wake up his son.
“Thank you,” he places a hand on her shoulder as he walks past her. She looks up at him, still not convinced he can handle himself.
He glided forward on trembling legs, like a fawn taking its first steps. Luckily, no one was looking at him yet. Harry was on the other side of the rink, laughing as Finnigan kept Weasley in some sort of playful headlock and Weasley tried to fight Finnigan off with pretend punches in the side. Dean Thomas cheered his boyfriend on; Hermione Granger scowled at the fuss with a reluctant half-smile. The weight of loneliness settled over Draco. Slytherins never had this kind of raucous fun. How could Harry have thought Draco would fit in?
I was spoilt and hateful, and I looked down at everyone who wasn’t like me. And the worst part was that I was still envious of the things others had that I didn’t, as if the world were nothing but a zero-sum game.
“If you were into girls, you’d have been with Pansy Parkinson, no doubt.” Harry shrugged and popped a candied slice of orange in his mouth. “I don’t think any straight boy in his right mind would turn
“Ah, yes. The receipt form.” He leans over the side of his desk and grabs the parchment. “Because that’s what you came here for, wasn’t it, Potter.”
Draco wrapped his fingers around Harry’s heavy cock and pulled. They found a rhythm for several heavenly minutes, their movements instinctual and easy. As if they’d done this a thousand times, Draco pumping Harry’s prick as he fucked him from behind, Harry matching the rocking of his body to drive Draco’s cock deeper into him, while pushing his own cock deeper into Draco’s tight fist. Draco dropped his forehead on Harry’s shoulder, eyes squeezed shut and mouth open in a silent cry as he felt Harry tense and jerk, splashing the cupboards with his hot come. His arse clenched, gripping Draco sinfully tight until Draco came too. His cock throbbed, slicking Harry’s arse anew, and he pinned him to the island with his last few, powerful thrusts.
Malfoy, however, wasn’t looking so certain. “Well,” he said, fidgeting. Then he seemed to remember he was half naked, and began to put his clothes back in order. “I suppose we can do this again next time if you’re amenable.”
Mephistopheles dropped his hand and watched him with bloodshot, annoyed eyes. The white-eyed ravens on his shoulders shook their wings.
this time, hard against Draco’s hip, all heady desire and trembling need for validation, makes Draco lightheaded. “Your
He grabbed his wand and swished it. The drapes of his four-poster bed slid closed around him, and he didn’t wait to plunge his hand into his pants and take hold of his stiff cock with a sigh of relief. Oh, this was going to be fast. He wouldn’t even have time to cast Silencing spells. He started wanking, a few slow strokes at first, just to test the waters. His cock spurted a long trickle of precome and Draco’s eyes rolled. Turning his face on the pillow, he bit back a moan. Umphff, okay, definitely a fast one this time. He moved his hand up and down his hard prick, faster, harder, marveling in the way his body responded, thanking every last corner of Hell for giving him a human form to live his lives, biting his lip when he let his fingers linger around the crown, teasing the foreskin before wrapping around his shaft again and resuming his frantic wanking. His head was full of Harry’s recalled presence. How real he’d felt, so ordinary in his jeans and hand-knit jumper and mismatched socks, how touchable his skin has looked, how close to kissing they’d come, how green and warm his eyes were when they locked with Draco’s—
The remaining guests shuffle back to the study, glasses in hand, the remainder of their bottle of red floating behind them with Pansy’s skilled Leviosa. The doors to the garden have been left open; the night is cool and fragrant, the solitary note of a nocturnal bird trilling in the hedges. Hermione conjures a blanket and lays it down on the dewy grass. The rest of their little group follows, except for Pansy who finds Draco’s newest vinyl record on his desk.
No matter the outcome of this day. No matter if Harry is still here tomorrow… This is his last cruelty to him. The malice ends now.
Draco shrugged, unphased. “They don’t have much leverage, now, do they? What’s the worst they can do? Slap me on the wrist? We all know I love it. Demote me? I’m already at the bottom of the demonic ladder.” He lifted a smug eyebrow. “I’m so shite at my job, I’m basically untouchable and you know it.”
has openly and ostentatiously done what Harry, for all his legendary Gryffindor bravery, has never admitted to anyone but himself.
“Longbottom,” Draco answered politely, albeit a bit stiffly. “Long time, no see.” He turned to Harry and forced a smile. Force of habit, however, made his smile feel more like a smirk. It was also force of habit, he supposed, if his voice came out in the trademark Malfoy drawl from their Hogwarts days. “Hello, Potter. I’m beginning to believe you’re stalking me.”
“So you’ve been working for Draco for a long time, then. You stayed, even when they moved back to London?”
Draco stroked Harry’s prick—still hard, still gleaming with Draco’s saliva—and leaned in to suck it into his mouth again. He wanted to smile at Harry’s garbled moan but his lips were stretched too tight. He closed his eyes and let the sensation wash over him, Harry filling his mouth with tiny jerky movements, his thighs trembling with need, his arsehole fluttering under the soft pads of Draco’s fingers—
“Headmistress,” Harry piped up. “I want to reiterate how lucky I am to have been paired with Draco. He’s one of the most clever and thorough people I’ve met, and he also managed to make this career research interesting and fun. I mean, just look at how creative he was! Muggle tests paired with Wizarding spells! It’s all brilliant, really, but...” He scratched the back of his head, hesitated. “What about extenuating circumstances? What about not
Malfoy hisses, a harsh exhale in Harry’s ear. Harry squirms, caught between the claustrophobic press of coats and cloaks, and the undeniable zing of pleasure slashing from his ear down his spine. Unable to shake off Malfoy’s grip, he settles for petty revenge.
Hermione and Ron linger in the foyer, Hermione taking an inordinately long time to put her jacket on. When she’s done, she nudges Ron. He starts as if he’d forgotten, and throws an abashed glance at Harry.
“Do I?” Draco grins into Harry’s hair. Their movements are more purposeful now, Harry’s body perfectly slotted against his, his own legs wrapped around Harry’s thighs, their dripping pricks trapped between their bellies. Draco’s wanking fantasies flash blurily in his mind as Harry slides a lubed hand between their bodies and takes both their cocks into his fist. Draco lets out a moan so loud and wanton he’d be embarrassed by it, if Harry’s gaze wasn’t on his all this time, glasses a little fogged up, eyes glazed with desire, mouth open in a silent gasp. Draco smiles and lifts his hand to Harry’s face, takes off his spectacles, lets them drop on the floor on top of their clothes.
“It's like a toy shop exploded in here,” Harry muses, looking around as he steps over an overthrown box of puzzle pieces and avoids losing balance, his left arm still held tight against his chest with a splint.
“Oh, this is a spur-of-the-moment visit, Mr Potter, I assure you. Draco doesn’t know I’m here. I couldn’t resist surprising him on his birthday.”
Malfoy exhales carefully. “I could have sworn… That night, at the Chamber of Commerce, I was certain you were…” He stops, bites his lip.
Suddenly, Harry can’t stand it, his friends ganging up on him to tell him he’s making a mistake. He fucking knows it, for God’s sake. He doesn’t need to be reminded that there’s nothing about this whole plight that doesn’t scream giant fucking disaster in waiting.
Harry exhales a small laugh. Draco wonders if Harry is as relieved as he feels. Harry rolls off him. He slides a palm down Draco’s belly, traces the rivulets of come on Draco’s skin, down along the inside of his thigh. Draco squirms under his touch. When Harry looks up at him again, the question clear in his eyes, Draco can do nothing but nod.
“After the Battle of Hogwarts,...I wanted some peace and quiet. Like Harry,” she added, nodding toward the back of the living room. Draco turned to find Harry standing in the threshold, listening gravely.
Harry doesn’t tell her he couldn’t care less whether the Ministry gives him more assignments in the future.
Scorpius wraps his little fingers around Draco’s hand and tugs him towards the path they came from, and Harry follows them, hands in his coat pockets, looking like he’s always been a part of their lives.
“I will not. Ernestina, you know that you, Scorpius, Caduceus… you all come first. And I come second. I’ve always made my decisions in that order.”
Fuck, he was panting, and Harry was, too. His breath was so hot against Draco’s face...so hot. Scorching. Draco realised he had moved close enough to see the flecks of gold in Harry’s irises.
Last night, they had both fulfilled an old fantasy, and the world hadn’t ended. And now that morning was here… what would become of that one night of passion?
The red lightning bolt hits Balzac in the chest, and he flies backwards, hitting the coffee table that splits in half under his weight with a loud crack. Among the shards of wood, the shaggy black fur looks eerily unmoving, and Harry can’t tell if Balzac is still breathing.
I’ll always have regrets about the things I did before and during the war. I’ve spent...I’ve spent years in therapy trying to sort out my feelings about my past. In the end, I think my therapist was more willing to forgive me than I ever could. I know I was just a kid back then...but so were
That’s the trouble with Harry. That’s been the trouble since the beginning: he doesn’t look like someone who could be
The scratching of the Quick-Quotes Quill on the floating parchment was the only sound in the room until it finished writing down the last sentence.
“Fine, but only because I really want the promotion I asked Head Auror Smith about,” Malfoy heaved a theatrical sigh. He bent to pull on the handle.
Pansy rounds on her husband, her black patent leather heels clicking on the marble floor. “I am, quite literally, the
Harry eyes him through rain-soaked hair falling in his eyes, hoping Draco will say more. But Draco simply smiles, a small, crooked smile that makes his cool eyes sparkle, and takes Harry by the shoulder.
In the streets of Hogsmeade, the cheerful spirit permeated everything, painfully at odds with Draco’s rush of self-loathing. The reparations that had been made were objectively impressive. Draco had not expected Hogsmeade to look so festive, so soon after the war. On the first Hogsmeade trip of the school year, the Wizarding town had looked utterly dismal: many of its buildings had collapsed, half the shops’ windows were shattered and gaping in the cold October air, and its main street had looked ripped open by the Blasting curses of the Battle and the steps of Voldemort’s giants. Now almost all the shops had reopened, the craters in the middle of the main street had been filled out, the streets and shops had been decked with fairy lights and bright ornaments, and Celestina Warbeck’s greatest Christmas hits oozed out of magical speakers all over town.
Harry turns. Waits for Draco to notice how quiet, how stock-still the hit of realisation has left him. When Draco does, his eyebrows draw down in a worried frown.
Draco felt his knees wobble, his own smile tremble, his ribs ache with the pain of his breaths in the cold evening air. Oh, sweet Lucifer. This was worse than a crush.
“It’s beautiful. It’s snowy and impeccable. We’re in the middle of Scotland and it’s nearly Christmas. Of course it’s freezing. We’ll cast Warming charms.
Draco, the idea comes directly from the Big Boss,” Mephistopheles said, and his expression turned sickeningly reverential at the evocation. “Lucifer himself thinks it would be a glorious way to bring your first hundred-lives cycle to a close. Something you could leverage for a promotion on your next life. When your next life starts again next June, would you rather still bully playgrounds and schools, or move on to bigger, badder things?”
Next time I see you, the first thing I’ll do is kneel between your spread legs and suck your cock until you can’t help it, until you stop being careful, until you pull my hair and groan my name and come on my face. And then... Well, I’m not going to reveal all the plot. I’ve learnt as much from the play you’re in. Cliffhangers have their uses. Like enticing you to agree to another date.
“Goodnight, Harry. You’ve already spent too much time with us tonight.” She holds him by the shoulders and take a step back to give him a meaningful look. “Now go find your man.”
Flustered and oddly choked by Luna’s kindness, Draco took out a roll of parchment from his satchel to cover the mounting wave of emotion. “Well. This is just for you to know what the Prothimioscope does. I still need you to sign the disclaimer, though.”
“It’s my job,” Harry says, but his voice catches in his throat. He’s exhausted, and shaken, and he wants to pull Draco closer and take him in his arms and tell him it’ll all be fine in the end…
Unsure if he should follow them, Draco found himself alone at the big dining room table, his fingers wrapped around a warm cup of tea. He felt pleasantly full yet slightly shaken by the flood of emotions the night had brought. He might be human now, but human feelings still had the power to overwhelm him. Sometimes they washed over him like a tide, sometimes seeped through him like groundwater through rock, sometimes buzzed around him like magic. He savoured the milky aroma of his tea and the sting of hot liquid on his tongue. He deserved a few moments alone to recover after the intensive immersion he’d just had in Harry’s family.
Blaise hugs his wife’s shoulders. “Yeah… you kinda did. But your incapacity to unstick your foot from your mouth is why we all love you.”
Behind him, the door clicked shut. He turned to find Draco Malfoy carefully releasing the handle. Then Malfoy fixed his grey gaze on him, intense and predatory behind his glasses.
They kissed and pulled at each other's buttons and tore shirts open in the dim light of Harry’s Lumos, the metal lockers echoing like gongs with each of Malfoy’s assaults on Harry’s clothing. Until finally, a half-naked Malfoy pressed himself up against Harry. His long prick aligned with Harry’s and god—the sensation left Harry delirious with need.
There was an excited sparkle in Harry’s eyes. It was only offset by his smile, guarded and almost shy. Draco was certain his own expression mirrored Harry’s. With their schedules and the fact that Harry seemed to spend every free minute surrounded by his friends, it was their first interaction since their kiss—their many, many passionate, life-altering, unforgettable kisses. Part of Draco’s mind was certain kissing Harry meant something real; the other part was convinced it would all blow up in his face the moment he sought confirmation with Harry.
Draco snorts, rivulets of rain falling from his hair, running down his nose. “Time to head back. I’ve no plans to freeze my arse off in the rain just to listen to Harry Potter wax lyrical about me.”
The Entrance Hall was empty save for a few witches and wizards, some in couples, some in small groups of friends, all coming or leaving. It was dark enough for Harry to be able to hurry across the hall before anyone could recognise him and chase him for a picture or an autograph. It would kill the excitement of this moment, the anticipation. And nobody wanted that. Well, not Harry, at least. And maybe not Malfoy either, given the keen way he’d fallen in step with Harry. The Entrance gates were wide open, the coolness of the Scottish spring night seeping inside. It had been too hot in the Great Hall, or maybe he’d felt that way from standing far too close to Malfoy. Harry wondered briefly if the refreshing, forest-scented air would cool his eagerness down. God, he hoped not. He didn’t know what to expect from his impromptu suggestion, but Malfoy had taken it in stride as if it were a dare.
for you. But I can't live behind closed doors anymore, Harry. I've spent enough time living that way.”
Harry lifts up his knees, puts his face between them, forces himself to breathe, breathe, breathe, even though every breath is killing him.
“Oh, I definitely plan to have a good time,” Hermione says with a decided grin. She links her arm with Ron’s and pulls him off the stool and towards the dancefloor. Ron follows with a resigned look, his meekness undermined by the fact that he’s already shimmying his hips to the music. A trail of flashes follows them, the journalists too busy with the two more interesting members of the Golden Trio to notice the third one making his exit.
sharp as a warning. The mercurial ebb and flow of his warmth towards Harry,  like he had to continually stop himself from getting too familiar and comfortable around him. The constant glances when Draco thought Harry wasn’t looking. And now… Draco’s eyes on him, almost supplicant.
He felt Harry move closer, his gloved hand touching his arm, squeezing a bit. When he looked up, Harry was staring at him, a pained expression on his face. Draco’s vision was going blurry. If he cried in front of Harry the way Harry had cried in front of him a week ago, would that make them even? He smiled bitterly. “I guess I never thought siding with my father and with that snake-faced maniac would lead to
Draco closed his eyes briefly. How could he phrase it so it wouldn’t be a lie? “Before the war—before Eighth Year, I always thought there would be someone else to choose what I’d do next. I never... let myself think about the future.” He opened his eyes to find everyone watching him.
Harry turns around, all fake bravado gone, and Draco opens his arms. Harry burrows against Draco’s body with a soft whimper, instinctive, like a small animal looking for warmth.
“I hope they don’t find out,” Harry says. “Not yet, anyway. This is still… so new to me. I need to take my time.”
“You just got to admit, you didn’t expect this event to intermingle so many different people, did you? You had a good chat with—”
The first time Harry had seen Malfoy at the Ministry had been in the cafeteria, roughly a year previous. It was in the middle of his lunch with Ron. After three years as an Auror, Harry had developed a routine: lunch at the Ministry cafeteria with Ron every day at quarter past twelve, except on Wednesdays when they bought samosas and balti curry from the Indian food truck that stopped in one of the small streets near Scotland Yard.
Anyway! Sorry, sweets. I’ll admit it’s fairly hard to beat me. Or Millie. I’ve a renewed respect for my cold hearted, strong-willed colleague.
“Of course,” Jemima tells him, her trustful eyes smiling. The merits of being Harry Potter: people trust him with what would look slightly suspicious on anyone else.
Inside, there is a clear, bright foyer, all white marble and tasteful dark wood furniture. In the back, a beautiful stairwell twists around a wrought-iron banister. Tall vases full of white and grey hydrangeas frame the doors leading to the rest of the house on the right and left sides.
Harry doesn’t feel ready. He just knows that— “If I don’t get my cock inside you right this minute, I might die.”
Malfoy leans all his body on Harry, and Harry moans at the feel of that strong, heavy weight on top of him, so unlike anything he’s experienced before — exactly what he didn’t know he needed. Malfoy gets his hands in Harry’s hair, thumbs on his cheeks, and kisses him, kisses him, kisses him, slow and deep and filthy, and Harry doesn’t even realise he’s started to rut against him, helpless little thrusts of the hips, until Malfoy puts a hand on his waist.
Harry feels the blush creep up the back of his neck. “Since… since — well his son started calling me Harry right off the bat and asking me why I didn’t call his dad by his given name and—     and that’s it!”
“You’re the one who doesn’t want to get caught!” Harry hisses, unsure if they’re talking about stealing or about surprise blowjobs between old nemeses. By the amused look on Malfoy’s face, he’s heard the double-entendre too.
“Yeah, we are. But if you don’t do it soon, I might strangle you on the spot, Malfoy, hard-on or no hard-on.”
“We were told there was a warrant,” Auror Boyle explains. Her voice is thin — unconvinced. “Do you really not have one, Smith?”
The charity ball tonight is in support of some noble cause or another — the specifics have already fled Harry’s brain. Wizards Without Frontiers? The Wishing Well Foundation? Tea Towels For All Elves? More likely something to do with trade, given the setting. The Chamber of Commerce is a magnificent building, and tonight it sparkles brighter than ever, fairy lights hanging from every moulding, the jaunty tunes of the band ringing through every hallway. Harry has been here many evenings before. The ostentatious splendour of the place never fails to fill him with awe while simultaneously giving him a pounding headache. Sprawling marble floors and sculpted staircases at every turn, and those ridiculous ceilings on which painted winged cherubs chase skimpily dressed maidens.
“Wanker?” Draco lifts an eyebrow. “Nice show of respect for someone who's supposed to be your boss.”
He knows what he looks like. The long, raised scars of Harry’s Sectumsempra criss-cross his white chest. They’re freakish and shocking, unlike anything anyone would expect to find marking the body of an aristocratic pureblood. Purebloods didn’t fight — at least never in a way that left physical marks. Purebloods never left a wound unattended long enough for it to scar. Despite this — or perhaps because of this — Draco’s come to like them. A reluctant, disgusted and grudging sort of appreciation, but appreciation nonetheless. A reminder, if he ever needed one, of all the things that set him apart from the witches and wizards who used to be his peers. He relishes the sudden paleness of Harry’s face, those green eyes trying to avoid the scars and helplessly drawn back to them. Oh, Merlin does he relish it. Draco lets a small, wry smile twist his lips. Showing him the way he maimed Draco for life is painful, but also just this side of pleasurable. He never thought he would get that tiny little revenge over the former bane of his existence.
Malfoy’s mouth lifts at the corner. “I can live with that. Besides, this isn’t really about me. My security detail is here to protect me but also, mainly, my son, Scorpius.” He rests his elbows on the desk, pressing his fingertips together. “You explained to me why
When Harry shakes his head, she laughs, incredulous. It’s like being back at Hogwarts again. She brushes a curl out of her eyes and continues, the excited look back on her face. “It’s funny, because I had the idea watching Arthur try to fold my children’s pushchair using magic. It looked so tedious and complicated, when it’s the easiest thing in the world when you do it the Muggle way… I figured, everything about magic or Muggle life is a little bit like this; sometimes it’s best to do things with magic, and sometimes it’s more efficient to do things like a Muggle. Except as witches and wizards, we tend to overlook that Muggles have a depth of knowledge, resourcefulness and practical minds that some magic people lack.”
Draco stilled. He had hoped... he had hoped for some sort of miracle. Maybe. Yet this was probably still his best chance.
To no one’s surprise but his, Harry was contacted almost immediately after owling his CV to the address indicated in the job listing.
“Potter,” he said when his old arch-nemesis reached him. He did his best to sound cold and spiteful. The music was loud enough to cover the faint tremble of his voice, wasn’t it?
“I still can’t quite believe it sometimes, but you are,” Harry smiled. “You can move, you know. He’s not going to wake up. Babies do tend to sleep like babies.”
“Maybe that’s why Harry hasn’t managed to make a meaningful break in the case,” Hermione muses. “Maybe the house is diverting his attention.”
When Slughorn was out of their immediate line of vision, Harry wrote on the corner of Draco's parchment. The gesture spoke of an instinctive intimacy that made Draco yearn for more.
“Not great… which is to be expected,” Harry adds quickly, seeing his friends’ worried faces. “But… I made a case for myself, I think.”
Merlin, even thinking the word makes him cringe. He’s a twenty-five year old man, after all. Isn’t it all mostly mechanical, at his age?
“There is an array of possibilities available to you. As such, Eighth Year students could benefit from spending time researching what they want to do after Hogwarts.” McGonagall steepled her fingers. “Over the next week, I will group Eighth Years in pairs, so each one of you can start discussing ideas with your peers. Someone who is going through the same stage of life and the same concerns as you are. A career sounding board, if you will.” She paused somewhat dramatically. “I have decided that you and Mr Potter will work together on this assignment.”
Absorbed as he was in the changing shades of grey in Malfoy’s glinting eyes, Harry belatedly remembers he’s got his own container of chicken vindaloo, probably going cold. Yep, definitely cold. Still spicy as fuck.
To be honest, Draco had asked himself the same question and had come up short. He could see another reason why the Headmistress would assign them to this specific task together. Him and Harry. The Death Eater and the Boy Who Lived.
Draco barks, his cold composure finally cracking. “I told you not to say it! Not when this can’t be real!”
“You are hard to read,” she said. “Harder than Ginny. Her aura is red and pink all the time.” Draco glanced at Ginny Weasley. Her grin was positively dazzling. It grew wider when she looked in Luna’s direction.
Turns back to see the hurt and betrayal on Draco’s face, a second before he schools his features into a stone-cold mask Harry barely recognises. Harry raises a hand in a timid goodbye, a gesture meant to be friendly, meant to mean
And though he’d much rather spend the evening in his pyjamas, watching telly while eating greasy fish and chips straight out of the bag and passing out on the couch, Hermione’s done a lot for him lately. Just because he chooses to wallow in the shambles of his closeted one-night-stand with Malfoy doesn’t mean he should forget how to be a good friend.
They lay there, almost all their skin exposed. In the near-darkness, Harry could only hear their breathing, loud and fast. He could see the way Malfoy was looking down at him, an almost wistful expression on his face.
I’d offer for you to come to the lab, but Smith’s forehead vein is already bulging from all your memos flying in and out, so maybe stay away for now if we want to avoid a vein-tastrophe?
Harry’s hands flew to Malfoy’s hair as he arched up towards him, their bodies fitting together as if they’d done this a thousand times before. Malfoy’s groan reverberated in Harry’s mouth and then his tongue was there, licking against Harry’s, long fingers holding his face. The desperation in Malfoy’s kiss filled Harry with a want he’d forgotten he could feel. He’d kissed so many people in the past ten years—hundreds, really—but there had been something expected in each of those kisses. Harry had known how they would go before he’d even gone through them. But Draco Malfoy had never been someone Harry’d thought he would kiss until this very moment. And now that it was happening, it suddenly made perfect sense. This kiss… this kiss was the kind that had been ten years coming.
He managed to extricate his foot from the puddle and looked down at it. The seams of his boot were coming apart.
“I would buy myself a cone at Fortescue’s,” he said after thinking about it. “The extra large one, remember those? The ones coated with chocolate? With three scoops of cookies-and-cream and two of treacle tart ice cream. And melted chocolate on top.” He smiled at the thought. “You?”
“I know what I’m doing. And if all you’re going to do is make me feel shitty about it, then maybe I shouldn’t be here.” He sounds childish and petulant, and maybe that’s just what he is. That’s exactly how he feels when he stomps over to his friends’ fireplace, grabs a pinch of Floo powder and looks over his shoulder. “I’ll see you when either of you is ready to be less of an arse to me.”
So Harry just walks to the bay windows lining the side of the waiting room that overlook the Atrium.
“That all depends on what Mr Potter decides to do with that information…” Blaise says. He lifts an eyebrow, and Harry wants to fidget under his stare.
In the past weeks, he’s dreamed about having a man in his bed so often he’s lost count of the versions he envisioned. None of them compare to the man by his side now. Malfoy watches him, propped on an elbow, flushed chest rising and falling with every rapid breath, legs entwined with Harry’s. His hard cock juts out a thatch of dark blond curls, slender and pink and twitching. Harry’s mouth waters at the sight.
“You come into my house, you pretend to be someone who’s trained for personal protection, you make a case for yourself and I give you the job. I put my safety in your hands. I put my son’s life in your hands…” Draco’s head is shaking, more fury than disbelief. “I put what’s most precious to me under your fucking care, and you have the absolute nerve to come and tell me you’re none of the things you said you were?”
Draco totally slipped him the tongue. Harry looked like he couldn’t. Get. Enough. ‘For a bet’, my arse. They’re LOVING IT.
“Oh, here you are!” Hermione waves at Harry over Ron’s shoulder as Harry approaches. Then she turns back to the Petersons and smiles. “This is our friend, Harry.”
Oh, dear Lucifer. Harry had been so close last night. His skin had looked so real, so soft. It was for the best that Draco had been so tongue-tied, or he would have slid his hands into Harry’s hair, his stupid, ridiculous bird’s nest of a mop of hair, and he would have pulled him in for a proper kiss.
“I really can’t blame her for that. It was all me. And I was… already rich enough not to need a job,” Harry adds, somewhat abashed. “The incentive to make an effort was limited. So I dropped off.”
He was burning to tell Harry, but something held him back. He looked back at the fire, unable to maintain eye contact.
His music sounds like someone let a rampaging hippogriff in charge of the string section. Or a troop of terminally flatulent Blast-Ended Skrewts in charge of the drums. Such a lack of subtlety.” Malfoy shudders theatrically. “I’m more of a Chopin man, myself. Forceful yet gentle. Intelligent. Virtuoso. Sophisticated…” Malfoy crooks his fingers under Harry’s palm, stroking along the lifeline. Harry forgets how to breathe.
When he comes out in the foyer, Harry Potter is, indeed, waiting for him. Balzac beat Draco to it: he’s sitting at Harry’s feet, a big doggy grin on his face, and Merlin… Draco is not ready for it. Might never be ready for it. His damned dog is not helping him hate Harry, either. Once more, he wishes he’d had time to go for that morning run — sweat out all the nervous energy, all the adrenaline, and meet Harry when he’s feeling peaceful and strong.
to the chest. It was also a loud, clear, long-time-coming wake-up call. He doesn’t remember much of that morning. The Auror department had an arrangement with the Department of Lost and Found: all magical objects and artefacts gathered in the course of an investigation that ended up not being classified as evidence would be delivered to the DLF, so that they could one day, be handed over to their rightful owners. Wilson, Harry’s intern, in charge of bringing the discarded boxes of evidence to the DLF, had called in sick that day. Harry had offered to bring the box down to the DLF himself. Not as an excuse to see Malfoy again. No. Harry hadn’t thought about
Malfoy pushes his chair back. The legs screech on the kitchen tiles. He stands, grabbing his fork and the empty container of curry. “Oh, I don’t know, Potter,” he says flippantly, passing by Harry on his way to the sink. “I do think I’ve found my vocation.”
Potter,” Draco snaps, interrupting him as if Harry’s words could burn. His hands are twisted in his lap. “What did you think?”
He didn't mean for Harry to see it. He’d forgotten about it. These days, he never has to hide it. His team knows him. They know everything there is to know about who he used to be. Most of the time, the Mark is hidden under his long-sleeved shirts, just so he doesn’t have to think of it.
Draco dropped his hands in his lap. “Now that my entire family knows we’re going to defile each other in the next room, we might as well get on with it, don’t you think?”
And then… it had all gone up in smoke. Was it something that Harry’d said? Or done? Had Harry been so bad in bed that Malfoy had run away in the middle of the night? But Malfoy had liked it… he’d said it… Harry hadn’t been with a man before, but — not to flatter himself — he didn’t think a man could fake the kind of explosive orgasm that had raked through Malfoy while Harry had fucked him.
“You’re a liability,” Draco grinds out. “I didn’t see it soon enough… I was weak. Blinded by—” He gestures between him and Harry, and Harry’s throat tightens painfully, “—by
“I’m going to assist George at the shop,” Ron said. “He needs the help. The business is slowly picking up again... and Mum says the days are long sometimes and it can get lonely in there. A little company can’t hurt.”
“Oh, if the press were to find out,” Malfoy murmurs. That should stop Harry, but there’s no bite to Malfoy’s words, no malice. Only truth, and a weak tremor that makes Harry close the gap between them.
was in print...Oh, but we wouldn’t have needed it. It was so obvious that every word printed in it was freely given.”
The realisation of his proven queerness scares him shitless. It does. But when had that ever stopped Harry from acting on what he thought was right?
So he agrees to attend the dinner, more out of friendship for Hermione than concern for the cause that the dinner supports. It’s hard to be in fervent favour of programmes that support Acromantula birth rates when you’ve faced Aragog’s hundreds of carnivorous babies as a teenager.
“That, and for bringing back all the wonderful, excruciating memories of being fifteen, pimply, socially awkward, and sexually frustrated, I suppose.”
“Please drop the Auror mode for tonight?” Harry pleads. “It’s Draco’s birthday, and you’re his guests… I would appreciate if you’d acted like it.”
“Oh, God yes.” Draco rolls his eyes. “Are you kidding? I would have made sure I never had to lift a fucking finger in my life.”
. He pushed himself more, skating faster. His breathing picked up speed and he let out an exhilarated exhale. There was so much joy in moving like this. He always forgot about it until he was flying, or skating, or running. Lucius had always only valued Quidditch for the prestige it could bring. Physical activity, with its lot of sweat, exertion and flushed faces, had always be deemed unfit of a Malfoy.
Malfoy is waiting for him patiently, arms folded over his chest. “So?” He tilts his chin when he sees Harry.
“Sorry.” Harry did not look sorry at all. He looked smug and well-shagged. Draco was so elated, he could have floated to the ceiling had Harry not been anchoring him with the strong weight of his arms around his waist. “At least you got to
“I’m glad you’re here. Most days, I only talk to the plants, you see.” She seemed to consider her words. “Well, I also talk to Neville, obviously. But the plants spend more time at home.” She giggled at her little joke. Draco smiled politely, more confused than amused.
Scorpius coming, Mistor Potter. Ernestina would not miss him for anything.” She smiles at the thought of her charge, and her whole expression changes from wary to fond.
Malfoy’s gaze flicks back to Harry’s face then, and for a long second Harry stares back, mesmerized. He’d played his next meeting with Malfoy in his head so many times in the past weeks. Now Malfoy’s here, and so is the opportunity to do something about it.
Except in that issue, unlike the one where Hermione was on the cover, they added a question mark next to the title,
Draco placed the headphone in his ear. It was a curious sensation: the sounds of the room blocked only from one side, the crackling of the fire and the creaking of the castle around them still permeating his other ear.
“Scorpius is… better,” Ernestina admits, glancing at Harry over her shoulder. Then, as if she’s sensing Harry’s wish to know more: “The Mind Healer was here yesterday, and Dr Dawson, too. Scorpius is recovering faster than the Healers thinks.”
The question has been nagging him since he left St Mungo’s, but he didn’t dare bother anyone about it. Draco had told him it would take weeks for Scorpius to recover, and the little boy’s family was probably too busy taking care of him to indulge Harry’s concerns. That was when Harry had realised, truly and definitely realised, how much he’d come to care for Draco and everyone around him. How much more than a simple case was at stake for him, if Draco decided to discharge him.
“And if you want to try, you can even look at my scar,” Harry says, pushing his hair away from his forehead. “I’ve this very cool scar, see? It’s close to my eyes.” Scorpius’s soft brown eyes lift to his forehead and Harry grins. “You can try it on me, and I’ll tell you if it works, yeah?” Scorpius nods, eyes trained on Harry’s lightning scar, and Harry adds, “But only if you want to. You don’t have to look at me at all, and I promise you it won’t bother me at all.”
“Why not?” Harry asks, suddenly distressed. Ron may not be Malfoy’s biggest fan, but his repeated doubts are disturbing. His friends have always been on his side when it mattered. And this situation matters to Harry. Draco matters to Harry. Even more so than he realised before setting foot in his friends’ living room.
His sullen train of thought was interrupted by Malfoy snaking his arm around him, followed by his warm body pressed against his back.
Harry felt himself blush. “I thought all the sex we had last night made it pretty clear.” He glanced at Malfoy. “You?”
They were all so bloody curious, but it never was about who Harry was, was it? Too bad, though, because this was an interesting question to ask.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Harry, one thing I’ve noticed over the years, besides your disastrous hairstyle, is how utterly useless you are at Potions. It’s almost as though you’re
Draco glares at him, his eyes narrowed. “You keep my son out of this, Potter, or I’ll follow through with my desire to murder you.”
Night has come. The sky outside the tall windows has turned purple and dark blue. The lights of London are glimmering on the horizon, bright enough so that Draco doesn’t feel the need to switch on the lights. His desk is covered in stacks of papers and parchment rolls, quills tidily placed in their cases. On the desktop, Draco left a clear square of glass. There’s a sheet of parchment lying in the middle of it. Not letting go of Harry’s hand, he walks with him to the desk.
“—And onto your next fuck,” Blaise had added. His friends had become the kind of annoying couple who finished each other’s sentences, even the ones that didn’t merit to be finished.
He stands straighter, and Harry backs away a step, as if caught. Draco lifts an eyebrow. A rush of pleased, petty satisfaction runs through him. Being able to fluster Harry Potter will never lose its charm.
But the truth is, Harry doesn’t know how to. Sometimes he has the feeling that if he ever unclenches his teeth — if he ever lets his guard down — all the terrible things he left behind will spring back to life. He doesn’t know how to be idle, that’s the trouble with him. And yet he can’t seem to figure how to be anything else.
“Oh, we didn’t. We became close during his last year there. Then he graduated and left to pursue an Herbology scholarship in Sao Paulo. We met again, years later, when I managed to locate the last
The members of the unofficial Quidditch team were Weasley, Thomas, Greg, Blaise, Harry and Draco. Because of the team’s configuration and Harry’s oversized talent as a Seeker—or blatant lack of talent for any other position, Draco would have pettily thought a few years ago—they never played an actual Quidditch game, but rather split the team in two sides of three and passed a Quaffle while Harry on one side and Draco on another tried to catch the Snitch.
Walking into the cloakroom feels like wading into a warm current after swimming in a winter lake. Where the hallway is high-ceilinged and airy, the cloakroom is dark, stuffy, intimate. The air smells of wool and the mingled, lingering odour of perfume and oft-worn clothes. Racks and racks of coats, furs, and wizarding outer robes and cloaks muffle the noise of the ball, absorbing even the sound of Harry’s footsteps.
a secret.” His fingers slowly traced the ridge of his cock through his trousers. “You’re fucking hung,” he added, sounding a bit awed.
He shook his head with an incredulous smile. “You have to be kidding me. You’re one of the cleverest people I know, and I’m best friends with
“That’s what you said last time,” he warns, “and then we found you asleep in the hydrangea bush outside. Thank fuck we found you before the tabloids.”
Harry let go of his cock and pushed him up against the door again, pressing impossibly close. He grabbed Draco’s face and kissed him, unconcerned with the spunk lingering on his fingers and his clothes. He kissed his lips, his cheeks, down his neck, whiny little breaths escaping him as he did. He finally rested his forehead against Draco’s shoulder. They stayed like this for a long time, catching their breath.
Granted, the space is larger than many kids’ rooms; it’s the size of his father’s bedroom and study combined. Yet it’s divided into little areas that look both cosy and very specific in their purpose. Near the entrance of the room, there’s a pyramidal white tent; when Harry bends to look inside, he sees piles and piles of cushions and a few books. The other side is occupied by a reading nook that wouldn’t be out of place in a public library. The end of the room contains a single four-poster bed with soft green bedding, an armchair and a bedside table next to it. On the west side, underneath the window, a large rug is strewn with Muggle Lego. Paper maché unicorns and dragons and garlands of golden stars hang from the ceiling, and at least thirty books are scattered across the floor, all over the room.
The sarcasm, sadly, comes a bit too close to the truth. Harry has a pocket full of Galleons and Sickles he hasn’t earned. Galleons and Sickles that are waiting to be spent at the bar to support the charity of the day — in addition to the sizable donation Harry’s already made by owl post. Harry slides a glance at Ron. Unlike Harry, Ron’s taking the time to savour the taste of the eighteen-year-old single malt he’s selected for the both of them. The difference is that Ron’s
“Put your hands out. So you can hold her. Remember what I said about her nipping though. Just tell her no, firmly.”
Draco glances at the grandfather clock tucked between two bookcases in a corner of his office. His eyes widen when he realises it’s almost quarter to ten.
Draco listens to the whole exchange quietly, with only his eyebrow hitching higher and higher to showcase his scepticism. He takes a long sip of his morning Earl Grey, then sets the cup on his desk, fingers curled around the delicate handle, little finger lifted up.
“Harry, I need you to get us three invitations to the Society for the Protection of Acromantula and Magical Tarantulas!” she says, her intense expression made nearly maniacal by the green flames.
The closest Apparition point was below Westminster Bridge. When their feet hit the cobblestones of the quay, the cold air that filled Draco’s lungs made him cough in surprise.
Harry’s mouth crushes his before he can finish, and he’s being pushed back against the glass desktop, the side of it digging into his arse. Hazily, Draco ponders how taunting Harry never fails to work, as Harry works Draco’s trousers open with rough fingers and unzips his own jeans, a wild, desperate look on his face.
About his life in Paris, laughing and sketching ideas for children’s equipment. Becoming friends with the most unlikely person he could have imagined — an older Spanish house-elf, smart as a whip and so ambitious, her faith in her own project was positively contagious. Things he’d always wanted to keep for himself, the piece of carefree youth he’d managed to scavenge from the ruins of war and the Malfoys’ fallen reputation. He’d ended up telling the Aurors about Nesting’s dividends and how he’d invested them in developing Juvence and the structure of Caduceus. The lawyer had sat next to him, her face grave, and hadn’t let the Aurors go until they’d promised Ernestina could be discharged for the night, considering the numerous holes Ella had poked in the current wizarding laws. She’d been able to dig out some obscure legal precedents from the European Wizarding Court that Draco hadn’t been aware of, and that could apply to his case. According to her, nowhere was it written, in fact, that Ernestina’s and Draco’s association was illegal.
There’s a fair chance at least one of them will get hurt in whatever it is that they started, but in this moment, it’s a chance Harry is willing to take.
Malfoy stops with one hand on the handle of the door leading to his rooms. He turns around to survey Harry with another lift of his eyebrow. “Really, Potter? Making innuendos about my personal life on your first half-hour of employment?”
“I would have, wouldn’t I?” Draco starts laughing too, taken by the outrageous idea and by Harry’s dazzling grin. “I would have been so utterly insufferable, I bet the wizarding world would have collectively agreed to murder me in my sleep.”
“It did happen, though, didn’t it? And maybe it was for the best. It’s the one single thing that forced me to face the choices I’d made. Forced me to make new ones.”
It had started snowing. The sight of the magnificent bridge crossing the wide, sluggish waters of the Thames, Big Ben and the Westminster Palace illuminated in the distance behind curtains of fresh snowflakes, took Draco’s breath away. His feet came to a halt of their own accord.
“Do you mean...love?” She lifted her eyebrows. Draco had the uncomfortable feeling that he had walked right into his own trap, backed himself in a corner of his own making. Why had he even asked that question? What did he even know about love?
“Nice of you to give my queerness your blessing, oh Chosen One,” Draco deadpans, but his heart isn't in it. Potter ignores his jab and takes a step in his direction. Draco leans more heavily against the door.
Harry’s not sure Hermione’s standpoint speaks to someone like Narcissa Malfoy, but he supposes it doesn’t matter. Next to him, Draco’s face is pink, and he’s vehemently nodding his approval before he jumps on his feet, too.
They stare at each other, a silent understanding crossing the divide. Harry hears the words unsaid. He knows how lonely an empty house feels like. It’s possible he asked Malfoy to stay as much as a means to fill the void as in hopes of… something… unfolding between them. Even though it looks like nothing’s going to happen. Even though it looks like Malfoy doesn’t want anything to happen, besides a sound night of sleep.
Spurred on by Draco's encouragement, Harry takes Draco's wrists in one hand, and pins them above their heads, against the door. It's a good thing he's strong and holding Draco’s wrists so tight, because Draco’s vision tunnels, and all of a sudden his legs can barely carry him.
“Give me a couple of minutes to recover,” Harry says with a crooked smile. “And then we can try… We can do whatever you want.”
But he’d scurried back to his office all the same, after escaping the five-minute blur that his visit to the DLF office had been, heart pounding, cheeks hot, the image of Malfoy so confident and suggestive and
of his initial assets. A company like Caduceus must have required a very substantial investment to get started. Our experts at the Ministry estimate the initial investment at around three million Galleons.”
“It means palm tree, and Hagrid said she fit right into his palm when she was born. She’s still pretty small even now at two weeks old.”
He remembers how he used to wonder about Draco, back then. What did he do when no one was looking? Who were the first people he talked to in the morning? What would it be like to be his friend? What was the meaning of the emptiness Harry’d felt in sixth year, when Malfoy had stopped paying Harry the kind of unrelenting attention he’d given him since they’d met? Harry sometimes wondered if he’d ever been the focus of someone’s attention the way he’d been for Malfoy all those years. He wondered
Rationally, I knew, yes. But people act in unexpected ways when they feel cornered…when they feel judged. I wouldn’t have blamed you. I’m glad you didn’t, though.
“Harry…” Draco tells him, lifting his hand to his lover’s black curls, twining his fingers in it, relishing the fact that he can. “Even waiting for you was bloody fantastic.”
Hands in each other’s hair, Harry licking hot and wet and soft inside Draco’s mouth, they stumble back a few steps. Draco feels it all with frightening clarity — the intimate light of his study, filtering through his closed eyelids; Harry’s hands, sliding down, cupping the sides of his neck; the taste of his lips, the heat of his breath hitting his face as he pulls back a second just to look at Draco’s face.
Ron looks up at him wearily. “Mate, I’m not questioning your bloody competence. I just— We always knew you were weirdly fascinated with Malfoy, didn’t we? You were obsessed with him at Hogwarts. And I reckon he wasn’t much better. To just go and put the two of you together in close quarters for so long… I knew you’d end up either killing each other or shagging each other. I didn’t know Malfoy was into blokes like you are, but hey. I’m not judging.” He waves his hand towards Harry. “And now you’ve gone and — and fallen for him or something. Merlin, this cannot end well.”
Harry felt sick. Fighting a wave of nausea and misplaced pity for a man he had once intensely disliked, he shut the folder he was browsing and stood to leave. After all, soon enough, he’d be spying on Malfoy’s secrets under the pretense of working for him — a thought that only sent another rush of guilt through him.
He won’t get out of it unless he closes it, however; and that means he has to prove Malfoy is clean, not by showing there is no proof of guilt, but by showing proof of innocence.
Malfoy is standing by a window, his back turned to Harry. The window is cracked open an inch, and Harry notes the smell of cigarette, the red burning tip of it dangling from Malfoy’s fingers. It turns incandescent when Malfoy brings it to his lips and inhales.
“I don’t know if I’ve changed. I’ve just...had a lot of time to think things through. I regret... a lot of my actions. I’ve never been a good person”
Draco had ended up telling the Aurors the truth, eventually. All these days spent strategising with Harry and Hermione, and it had all come down to this. Burst in, shake Draco’s world upside down, and watch all of Draco’s secrets spill out.
“I don’t,” Harry confesses, and he’s surprised to realise he doesn’t have to lie. “Or at least, not the way other people do.”
Narcissa walks closer to him and pats his cheek. “I know, darling. I can’t help it. I’m your mother… I’m just looking out for you.”
“Wait...it’s real?” Draco was baffled. He would have thought this kind of news would have arrived to the magic world. He would have thought Mephistopheles, his appointed demonic mentor, would have shared the information when they’d meet. Not for the first time in recent months, it hit Draco like a Bludger in the face: how sheltered he’d been, how closed off from the wider world, working as a teenage demon in wizarding communities.
“So,” Draco flops down on his chair and makes it spin, landing his feet on the desk. He pushes his hair out of his eyes in a dramatic sweep. “Regale me with your naughtiest weekend adventures, ladies.”
Next to him, Harry laughed. His eyes were shiny and wet, and Draco wondered if there would ever be a time where their interactions wouldn’t feel like digging up old pain. He squeezed Draco’s arm again, as if teetering on the brink of a hug.
I apologise for not telling you about everything I liked, that kept me returning to the theatre night after night. The play was all right, I suppose (this is coming from someone who doesn’t know the first thing about plays and theatre, mind you) but you, Drake… you were fantastic. Your presence lit up the stage. I mean, obviously it did, with a face like yours and hair like yours and that voice… so deep and steady, so convincing, it made me forget I was watching a live play at times. It pulled me right into the action, your character’s motives and emotions. You’re a glorious actor, and singer, and I’d forgotten how beautiful you are and I wish Cecilia would have dragged me to the West End sooner, if it meant seeing you in more of your previous plays.
Scorpius’ fingers run across the keys with a dexterity and smoothness that can only come from hours upon hours of ruthless practice and a well of innate talent. His little face is scrunched up in concentration, and he doesn’t notice Harry standing next to him, stunned into speechlessness. There’s sheet music resting on the stand, so crammed with notes Harry can barely decipher them.
“You’re right about it being a shitty, unsolvable situation. No matter what angle you choose to look at it from, I let it go too far. I made it personal.”
but he could half-arse it, like he had half-arsed all of his assignments in recent years. In fact, in addition to bullying, Draco could have added another prideful line on his demonic
“Yeah? Then I’ll tell you what I’m doing,” Harry growls, griping Malfoy’s shirt tighter. “I’m stopping you from committing an offense.”
Draco took Jeff’s paw between his thumb and forefinger. He gave it a minute shake. “I do. Thank you.”
Malfoy fidgets as he settles into his seat. Harry chances a glance at him. He’s watching the ballet, hands in his lap. He’s wearing a smart, well-cut Muggle suit, the jacket open over a crisp white shirt. Malfoy forgot to button the top, and the collar is open and loose, revealing the dip of Malfoy’s throat, a hint of collarbone. Harry’s never seen anything as appealing.
“I wouldn’t ask you to, but…” Harry feels his voice turn pleading, “...but maybe we could have talked about it. Maybe there’s a middle ground. You didn’t need to leave like that.”
He’s as pale and strikingly blond as Harry remembers, but his hair now curls lightly around his ears and above his collar, more relaxed than the sleek style Harry had known him to favour at Hogwarts. He’s pointy and lanky but he’s obviously filled out in the last decade. He looks like a man, and no longer like the gaunt, desperate child Harry remembered from the last years of the war and the trials.
“Merlin, no. Wear a well-cut suit, stride in with a self-important air, announce a fake name with confidence, and nobody will check twice. Only a raving lunatic would come to a giant-arse spider party uninvited.”
He wouldn’t last long. There was something about Malfoy that made him want to bend him over the nearest desk, Head Auror be damned.
takes the sheet in his hands. He squints his eyes, the reflection of his spell turning the lenses of his glasses blue. He reads out loud, and a slow smile spreads across his face.
at him, calm as you please—Malfoy pushed his cloak back and pulled his wand from its holster. He pointed it at the door.
Harry had looked at him with slightly glazed eyes. “Yeah. Let’s go back downstairs.” He had taken Draco’s hand and they’d walked down to the Eighth Year Common Room, stopping every so often to kiss around corners or in dark alcoves. In front of their Common Room door, Harry had kissed him one last time, soft and sweet, as though it was the most natural thing in the world.
Hot, bitter come filled Draco’s mouth in sputtering spurts as Harry shook and thrust into him, all to the pleasure of his climax. Caught in the moment, Draco didn’t think of pulling away. He swallowed it, tasting Harry all the way down his throat, come and saliva leaking down his chin as he licked Harry clean. He hadn’t realised he was panting. Carefully, he pulled his finger away.
“I mean… yeah. You never thought—?” Eyes shifting, Ron rubbed the back of his neck. “I thought everybody knew. Looking back… I’ve often wondered if the reason why he picked on you so much at school was because he…
“Now what?” he asked, feeling around him blindly. He grabbed something warm and firm, which pulled out of his fingers with a hiss from Malfoy. Harry’s breath caught. “What… did I touch?” he asked. “Was it—”
“God,” Harry says, running a hand through his hair. “It’s getting late. Look — you’re welcome to stay if you want. I can get the guest room ready… I mean, only if you want to. It’s been a rough evening. You might not want to be alone.” Harry’s stammering now, and Malfoy’s eyebrows go up, his expression half-embarrassed, half-amused. Harry finishes with a little cough: “It’s, er… up to you. Stay here or go home. I… don’t mind.”
“I said ‘No business’”, Ron mumbles into his glass of wine. “And if the chat I had leads to anything positive, I’ll donate my next bonus to SPAT.”
when I was five.” Harry felt him swish his wand. When he turned to look at him, a second sphere of light was floating above them, just as dim and dismal as Harry’s.
Harry had read the same few pages about Chopin on a loop, Scorpius gradually relaxing, his eyelids growing heavier with each new read of the story.
“You don’t need to,” Harry says. “He really is quite fit,” he grumbles under his breath, and Hermione’s giggles redouble.
He pressed the button on the round device at his side, and music unlike anything Draco had ever heard started playing in his left ear.
I know dismissal when I see it, Harry. I was rejected by you once before, when we were kids. Twice was quite enough. I didn’t fancy a third, just to make sure.”
Scorpius lifts his hand, and the lid of the piano slowly creaks open. Harry stops on the threshold of the room. Watches in stunned silence. Wandless magic so controlled and effortless, even a grown wizard couldn’t have achieved it.
And, yes, it was uncomfortably hot, okay? It’s my best friend we’re talking about. It’s like watching family kiss. But hotter.
Constantly having to fight waves of terrible memories must do that, he thinks, as he powers through the rush of unease. He grabs the golden handrail and keeps climbing the stairs.
He remembered going back to the Tower, in the first days back at Hogwarts. There was a railing now, linking two sections of the ramparts circling the Tower. Between them, the fallen stones left a vertiginous gap, one that seemed to call Draco as much as it repelled him. He remembered taking a step back, the gaping abyss drawing him in, calling at him. A fall wouldn’t kill him, but it would sure raise a few questions from Madam Pomfrey. Worse: upset his mother. He had walked back to the safety of the wall before running down the stairs.
“I’m saying I’ve been with you, watching you, getting to know you… and maybe I’ll never be the most impartial person when it comes to you, but…” Harry takes a breath, feels the heat of Draco’s hands through the fabric of his shirt, against his chest, and lets the confession pour out of him like rain. “I’ve made no secret about the fact that I care about you. A lot. I know I’m paid to be around you, to supposedly spy on you… but this has nothing to do with it. I wake up every morning looking forward to the day I’m going to spend with you. That’s how much I’ve come to care. You’re — you're clever, you’re bloody brilliant, and you’re a good man. You’re a good man, Draco Malfoy, and if you don’t believe me, then I’m stubborn enough to believe it for the both of us.”
“Baby, you’re a catch. He would be mad not to see that. And if he doesn’t...” Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her smile. “It will be our pleasure to kick his arse until he does; Greg, Blaise, Theo and me.”
Ron continues with a placating tone. “Remember Gregory Goyle, from school? He’s just resigned and moved away from London. Up until a couple of days ago, he was Malfoy’s bodyguard. A listing for a replacement was posted yesterday in all the main wizarding news sources.”
“So… your dad said you liked music,” Harry ventures. “I like music, too. When I was your age, I really liked, er…” Scorpius hasn’t so much as batted an eye at Harry’s words. It’s like Harry hasn’t even spoken. He scratches the back of his neck. “I really liked The Cure.” He feels foolish. As if Scorpius would have any idea who The Cure were. Or the other bands Harry liked. The Pretenders. Nirvana. R.E.M. “I don’t know if you know them... What kind of music do you like?”
Because despite all his misgivings, there is something about seeing Malfoy’s face again, after all these years — after thinking that he’d left the memory of that scared, angry boy in the past — that makes him want to prod at the unexpected wave of emotion that rises in him.
Until Malfoy dropped his hand to Harry’s arse and touched his finger, warm and wet, to his twitching hole.
Malfoy’s eyes glimmered with humour. “I had no idea you had a thing for delayed gratification, Potter. Seems a bit out-of-character for you.”
Warning for this chapter: (non-graphic, off-screen) wild magic, and people getting hurt because of it.
“I’m sorry.” The words burst out of Harry between two panting breaths. “Draco, I’m sorry.” He lifts his hand, tries to touch Draco’s arm again, but Draco takes a step back and snarls.
Draco’s face is in shadows, but his eyes gleam in the low light. They’re fixed on Harry, and Harry can’t move, can’t look away.
Draco looked up from the headphones at Harry. “Can I try?” He asked. The earnestness in his voice would have put any demon to shame.
“I only know that it’s emerald and silver, and that it has been handed down from one generation of Malfoys to another for centuries. Other than that,” he shrugged, his demonic tendencies kicking in with every minute of horrified incredulity he put Jeff through, “it’s nothing but old metal and stone to me.”
Draco gives him a look like he’s as thick as it gets. “Despite what your dear Ministry says, Harry, not much has changed for house-elves in our country since the war. Ernestina is still an exception — she’s an employee, not a… a
Luna chuckled softly, her palm tree-shaped earrings tingling with the motion. “Does it surprise you?”
it. It’s a precious, tenuous feeling, in a life that has always left him so little choice in everything.
Pansy saunters forward on impressively thin high heels, taking off the shawl around her shoulders. “Draco,
Malfoy is always the first thing his eyes are drawn to, no matter where he is. It’s hard to focus when he’s at work, sometimes. He’s poured boiling water on the bench right next to his mug more than once.
(Daddy casts them over my bed every night, still.) (They warn him when I get up.) (Daddy used to be worried. The tension around his eyes even when he smiled. Dr Dawson said it wasn't my fault. But if I wasn't there, Daddy wouldn't worry. Now I only cancel the charms when I don't want to wake him up.) (Today it's fine if he sleeps in.)
“Will you give me my Snitch back?” he murmurs when he remembers. His thoughts are already fading into sleep.
Harry’s heart speeds up in his chest. He loves how fast Malfoy rises to his bait, how well he knows which of Malfoy’s buttons to push to get the reaction he needs, even after all these years.
“Yeah,” he admitted, defeated. “It’s stupid, though. Not just a little stupid. Embarrassingly stupid.”
With a nod, Draco pulled his satchel into his lap and took a small, round object out. Luna, face bright with curiosity, leaned in to look at the thing nestled in Draco’s palm. “Oooh, what’s that?” she asked excitedly.
“Thank you,” Malfoy says with a slow, soft smile. He looks pink and so well-fucked, Harry can’t help but feel a little proud. “That’s very gentlemanly of you.”
Calling Potter ‘Potter’ had always come naturally to him. In his youth, he used to spit it out like an insult; he used it to keep a distance, consciously at least. His unconscious had other ideas, and had started teasing him about it when puberty hit around third year. He’d had the misfortune to confess his inconvenient wanking fantasies to Pansy the year after, following which he had to suffer her knowing eyes every time she heard him spitefully mention Potter.
“Yes, Mr Potter. But it isn’t a project to take up lightly. I will meet with you again before Christmas to ensure you are making actual progress.” She looked from Harry to Draco with something akin to melancholy. “You and Mr Malfoy have promising futures, should you decide wisely what you want to do with them. Remember that this choice won’t be easy to make, between too many potential paths in your case, and too many closed doors in Mr Malfoy’s.”
than anything he’d ever done. It felt like a point of no return, and Draco relished it, bringing his face close, letting the soft skin of Harry’s erection stroke the soft skin of his cheek. Harry’s cock spurted another trickle of precome and Draco laughed quietly.
“They know what you did for me last spring, Draco. What you did for me and Ron and Hermione. Even if we weren’t together... there’s no way they’d hate you after that. We wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you.”
“Yes, I'm sure you do.” With one glance at Harry, Draco reaches around him and opens the cupboard door, pushing past him and stomping out. In the office, the light of day hits his eyes. He’s forgotten — it’s afternoon. It’s a normal day. A few minutes in a cupboard with Harry Potter, and he loses track of time.
“For Circe’s sake, Potter. Have breakfast with us. Who do you think Ernestina is cooking this massive meal for, just a seven-year-old child and me?” He stands, smiling in mock disbelief. “Just wait here. I’ll wake Scorpius up and we can all eat.”
“That is the thing, though,” Kingsley says. “When Malfoy started his company, he was twenty-four, and he wasn’t supposed to have that kind of money. In reality, he wasn’t supposed to have
“Your coat, sir?” A butler, an honest-to-god butler, pops out of nowhere. Harry catches the spark of recognition in the man’s eyes when he turns to answer. But the butler is professional to a fault. Instead of groveling, he simply holds out a hand, a gentle reminder of his earlier question.
Harry lifts his head up, panting. He wipes the back of his hand across his mouth, throat working. His face is red and shiny. There’s something thrilling in his eyes — feral yet contained — and Draco reaches for his hand, pulls.
He looks like he belongs here, with Draco. For all the times in his life when Draco’s wanted to run away from people looking at him like that, in the fond, heated way Harry’s looking at him now, he’s never once wanted to reciprocate so badly.
“You’re probably spending too much time at Malfoy’s,” Ron’s voice, equally harassed, comes from the kitchen. He must be the one cooking dinner tonight. “I bet his brat has his room meticulously tidy and organised, hasn’t he?”
“HahaHA!!” yelled Jeff, pointing at her. “Take THAT, you sightless fiend! Don’t look so scary now huh, FLUFFY?!”
Instead, he smoothed a short lock of hair behind his ear and readjusted his glasses. He glanced left and right, wondering who Potter was coming up to greet. But no one else was around, so Potter was stalking towards
Retrospectively, those few years of adolescent passions and frantic lovemaking felt like the pinnacle of carefreeness. Then it all went to hell.
“Sorry to ruin the best line of your dramatic villain monologue, Smith,” Harry says, protectively pushing Scorpius behind him as he does. The Aurors round on him, their wand hands twitching when they realise who he is. “But this is the opposite of abandoning ship. What the
Last Saturday, he took me out for a walk. We put big coats on. Mine was like a pillow. I wrapped my Slytherin scarf around my neck. Balzac wasn't there, so I knew it wasn't a normal walk. The streets were filled with people. Christmas shoppers. Lights. Smells. Too bright. We stopped in front of a shop. Window full of necklaces, earrings, watches. Jewelry store. Muted colours inside. Daddy crouched in front of me. I looked at the strand of hair poking out of his woolen hat. (Straighter, lighter than mine.) He said,
“Yet you had the presence of mind to shield everyone from it.” Draco’s eyes are a bright burn on Harry. Harry turns to face him fully. Draco is leaning forward in his chair, elbows on his knees. The fingers of his right hand are resting on the sheet, tentative, as if he held out his hand for Harry and decided against it at the last moment. Harry wants to take Draco’s hand in his. “Thank you, Harry. There was damage, to him, to you. I mean… Merlin, Harry, you were
“Yes, Headmistress,” Draco said. Harry didn’t speak this time. “We’ve actually done some research. Here,” he pulled a book from his school bag, “this one is called
Harry looks at the frame above the fireplace, an enlarged wizarding photograph of the Granger-Weasley family, all bright smiles and happy waves, to avoid meeting anyone’s eyes. “I think I like him.”
“Yes,” Draco continued, fake thoughtful air firmly in place. “But you’d have to give me something in return.”
to me, Malfoy. The way you are — the way you look… I can’t — not notice you. I can’t get you out of my fucking
Harry said when they reached the entrance to the Headmistress’ office. The stern gargoyle nodded and leapt to the side.
Harry holds him tighter, snorts a small laugh that reverberates through Draco’s chest. “Yes, you bloody great moron. Friends.”
“Well, if one of them ever thinks they can come after me, I’ll have a nice little pile of evidence to… encourage them to look the other way.”
Draco looks so cornered, so vulnerable, Harry desperately wants to take his face in his hands and kiss him. Instead, he wraps his hands around his knees, takes a breath.
“Come here.” Harry pulled Draco by the wrist and wrapped him in his arms. Draco feigned a long-suffering sigh.
Luna leaned back into the green velvet armchair. “You said, ‘Ready when you are.’ Are you going to ask me questions as though we don’t know each other?”
— him to finally fuck him. Harry had grabbed his leg and lifted it over his shoulder and pushed in, slow, slow and deep. He’d fucked him and kissed him and held him until he’d come, until Harry had come with him. It was only after his orgasm had ebbed away that he’d realised he’d murmured whispered endearments into Draco’s neck the whole time, and Draco had answered every one of them.
Greg sighs, his mouth curling slightly. It’s almost unnoticeable, but Draco knows him well enough. Greg is moved. He holds out a hand as big as the house-elf’s head, and Ernestina wraps her long fingers around his and leads him out of Draco’s office.
“Spells fired in legitimate defense!” Draco bursts, and at the sound of his father’s voice, Scorpius whines louder, thrashes under Harry’s grip.
He finds Scorpius in Malfoy’s study, climbing on the stool in front of the closed grand piano, Balzac wagging his tail and watching him expectantly.
“You know,” Potter said through gritted teeth, “there’s one way we could settle this once and for all.”
“Tut-tut-tut,” Draco interrupts her with a lifted hand. “None of this self-deprecating bollocks. Gabrielle’s Bend and Snap is perfect because she watched and learned from the best —
The sex was glorious — with Draco, it always has been, and Harry doesn’t mind a rough shag from time to time. At all.
“Fuck,” Harry gasps, thrusting in as carefully as he can, but he’s already panting, fighting to restrain himself, sweat beading on his brow. Malfoy’s so tight, and the moment feels so heavy and huge, not just the excruciating pleasure of Malfoy’s arse around Harry’s cock, but the knowledge of what Harry’s doing, what they’re doing, and the fact that there will be no going back from it. From knowing what fucking a man feels like. From knowing what Malfoy feels like under Harry’s hands. From knowing he loves it as much as Harry does. From knowing Harry likes him, and Malfoy likes him back, and maybe
“You don’t have to look people in the eye. You can just… look somewhere close to their eyes. Most people can’t even tell that you’re not looking into their eyes if you do that. You can look at their neck, or hair… or their glasses.” He points at his own spectacles, crouching down at Scorpius’s height, still keeping his distance. The little boy turns his head his way, casting a tentative look. Harry’s heart speeds up and he forces himself to stay very still, to speak very gently.
Harry opens his mouth to respond when Balzac’s enthusiastic bark resonates in the foyer and Draco’s purring drawl reaches them from the bottom of the staircase.
“I’m not saying this conversation is over,” Draco growls, interrupted by his own gasp when Harry pushes his hips into his. He repeats the movement, rutting slowly against his erection. “I’m just saying— I’ll have to think about it—”
Sex just didn’t appeal to him. Not in the way it did for that young man. Not in the way it did for Pansy or Blaise. Not in the way it did for everyone around him, young and less young, no matter their gender or sexual orientation. Everyone seemed to be chasing after sex like it was the Snitch at the final match of the Quidditch World Cup. And Draco felt like he was the one watching from the stands.
He’d almost given in. Had almost grabbed Malfoy by the collar of his expensive shirt and kissed him right then and there. It would have been a terrible mistake, probably. Quite a scandalous one, too—”Wizarding World Savior and Quidditch Star Harry Potter Kisses Ex-Nemesis Draco Malfoy At Hogwarts Class Of ‘98 Reunion!” would be spread across every bloody front page the next day—but in that moment, that hot, frustrating, delicious moment, Harry hadn’t given the scandal much thought.
Grumbling under his breath, Draco pulled the laces of his skates so hard one of them snapped. He pointed his wand at it and muttered a furious
Just then, the front door opened, letting a brush of cold air and a burst of familiar voices in. Luna craned her neck to see who was coming in, her eyes bright with joy.
“I don’t. Sorry.” Malfoy smiles back, almost in apology. “Yes, I could Floo home… but I’d like to stay.”
Holy fucking Merlin, Malfoy, it felt like I could never have enough of you. That feeling of wanting someone even as you’re having them. That feeling of
Harry half-collapses on Malfoy’s back, pressing him back on his elbows. For a split second, he cringes, hoping he’s not hurt Malfoy, that Malfoy won’t feel used… but then Malfoy moans once more, his cock giving one last sated throb in Harry’s hand.
A stage Draco’s already been through, and which passed in a flash so brief he sometimes can’t believe it happened at all.
Harry craves Draco like he’s never craved anyone else, and they’re not even together. They’re so far from being anything close to
Draco wouldn’t be a Slytherin if he wasn’t carefully weighing his options. He wonders what Harry can do to help him — to prevent a full investigation against Caduceus and Draco, to prevent the Ministry from framing Draco just because they ran out of criminals to catch. He wonders why Harry wants to help him. That thought especially hurts. Ernestina looks at him with pleading eyes every time she brings him lunch in his study, or when she finds him standing alone, late at night in the kitchen, a half-drunk mug of tea in hand.
“Yes, it’s real, Draco,” Harry smiled, wiping eyes wet from laughter. “It happened nearly thirty years ago. Merlin, you really have been living under a metaphorical rock, haven’t you?”
“You’re the best,” Weasley told her, pulling her close to him with an arm around her shoulders and kissing the top of her bushy head. “Helping Malfoy...you truly are an angel,” he added playfully.
“Indeed I did, Draco, but first—” He raised a hand and recited: “All hail Lucifer, the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Prince of The World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness.”
“I can lend you some of mine,” Draco says, avoiding Harry’s eyes as he does. Just the thought of Harry Potter wearing his clothes… his mouth waters. He curses himself for his weakness.
Then Daddy will build a fire. It will be later in the morning. Golden light pouring in from the French doors, from the snowy garden. I will sit at the grand piano. (The one Daddy repaired). I will lift the lid, let my fingers run over the keys (new keys, shiny, pretty) and I will play. I will play
The bell rings again, more insistent, and Harry groans a mumbled, “Comin’!” He can guess who it is just by the stubborn press of the button. He stumbles down the stairs, barefoot, trying not to lose his balance, dressed in joggers and an old Aladdin Sane t-shirt with a rip along the left seam. He hasn’t shaved since his last morning at Draco’s house. Hermione is going to take one look at him and decide that he needs an intervention.
he stutters. “I told Kingsley — this is our last chance to close the case! And I’m taking it! I don’t need a warrant for a friendly Ministry hearing!”
He remembers what landed him in St Mungo’s in the first place. Not that the thought really left his mind.
“Yes, Mister Potter. As I said, all I want is for you to take a moment to think of your future—the one that extends beyond the gates of our beloved castle, at least. Believe it or not, I consider what you’ve come up with so far as tremendous progress. I think, for the first time in your lives... you finally have the opportunity to make a choice purely for yourselves. You’re at the threshold of an exciting and decisive time of your lives, gentlemen. You might as well enjoy it.” She rose to her feet. “Now, if you will follow me, there is a very immediate and delicious future awaiting downstairs. I heard word from the Elves that the stuffed turkey and the chocolate and pear pudding are particularly spectacular this year. It wouldn’t do to let our Christmas feast go cold, would it?”
the bar had vodka. But no, they had to make it tasteful. It wouldn’t do to have ex-students binge-drink the party away. To be fair, the night was gorgeous, this year’s spring brisk yet warm enough to go out in just a jacket. When he’d crossed the lawn leading to the castle, the scent of freshly cut grass in the cool, humid air had filled him with a pang of nostalgia. He’d been happy here, he thought. In the first years, at least. He’d made his best friends on this lawn, in these classrooms, in the Slytherin dungeons. He’d weathered his first crush for a certain green-eyed, gorgeous menace. He’d loved everything about Hogwarts, everything, even the exquisite pain of Harry Potter’s nearness, even knowing they’d never be friends, they’d never be anything more. These days seemed so carefree, so distant. A different life that had happened to a different person. How had ten years passed so fast? And what did Draco have to show for them? His classmates had last seen him as a pitiful, reluctant, anxiety-ridden Death Easter. This was how they’d remember him. He was afraid that the person he was now, ten years later, wasn’t enough of a redeeming sight.
Draco looks away, pinches the bridge of his nose between his thumb and index finger. “And that’s why I should keep you around.”
“Not that we got very far, Mistor Draco!” Ernestina hurries to interject from the other side of the kitchen, pouring a can of baked beans into a pan over the stove.
Spurred on by his words, Malfoy dug his fingers into Harry’s hips deep enough to bruise, and Harry felt the first wave of his climax hit him as his cock throbbed in his fist and started to pulse hot ribbons of come on his chest and stomach. “Oh fuck, Harry,” Malfoy grunted and slammed into him faster, deeper, “Oh fuck, I’m coming in you, can you feel it, can you feel me—”
“It's fine,” Harry nods. “I wasn’t expecting anyone after Ernestina let me in. She said you were busy.”
Ginny lifted a quizzical eyebrow at Draco but didn’t comment on his presence. The presence of other former Slytherins in the snowman-building taskforce didn’t seem to bother her either. Draco had tensed when he’d seen her walk up to them, but her and Harry had only exchanged friendly smiles and ‘hello’s, so he’d soon relaxed. After the heavy snowfall of yesterday, the weather had cleared. The day was blue-skied and sunny. When Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas had suggested a walk out on the grounds after lunch, they had naturally included Draco, Greg and Blaise in the group. Pansy had followed with Neville Longbottom, and Theo had tagged along without asking permission.
“The Ministry sent me.” The words fall from his mouth, inexorable. Draco stills, eyes fixed on him, and it’s too late to take it back. “I don’t work for the Ministry… not really. I’m hired as an external consultant.”
He had time to catch a glimpse of Malfoy’s feral smile before he leaned in and kissed him. “You wish, Potter.”
It turns out that Hermione has a plan and all the necessary arguments, as always. She has her sights set on the position of Headmistress of Hogwarts, and despite her demurrals — “Don’t worry, Harry, I’ve no intention of pushing McGonagall out, that would be ageism, and besides, it’s not like Ron and I are ready to move to Scotland yet, not with Ron’s career just taking off in London, maybe in a few years when we’re starting a family—” she’s taking every opportunity she gets to campaign for herself. The charity dinner is held at the Eldridge House, one of those old wizarding townhouses that magical families who left Britain after the War bequeathed to the Ministry of Magic. The Eldridge House, like many others, was turned into a museum for wizarding lifestyle and art, and the curators rent out its space for select events. It won’t be a crowded affair, Hermione assures Harry, just a small group of people. There will be a few wealthy witches and wizards Hermione knows from her work at the Department of Magical Law. A couple of them are on the Board of Directors of Hogwarts, “and it’s just the perfect occasion to have a casual chat with them outside of work, don’t you see, Harry?”. Harry sees it very clearly. He also knows that having the unspoken support of Harry Potter always reflects positively on Hermione’s endeavours. Also, he suspects that Hermione is secretly intimidated, though she’d never let it show. She’ll appreciate having him and Ron by her side.
“I’m going to make myself breakfast. Do you need me for the day? Jemima didn’t send me an agenda yesterday.”
“Fuck,” Harry moans, bucking his hips, his hand redoubling in speed over their erections. They’re both panting, gasping for release, lost in the slide of their bodies, the heat of their eyes and lips on each other. Draco’s hands slide further down, the fingers of his right hand finding their way to Harry’s crease. Harry lets out a growl and Draco feels a fresh wash of precome drip onto his belly. He almost laughs, exhilarated by the effect he has on the man who reduces him to a babbling, sweating mess himself.
to take this class. At least someone like Longbottom seems to see the benefit of taking Potions, even though he’s as hopeless at it as you are. He’s going to need his Potions NEWT to apply for his Herbology Mastership. You, on the other hand..."
With a snarl, Harry grabbed Malfoy’s face and walked him backwards a few paces, kissing him fiercely. When they broke for breath and he opened his eyes, it was dark, the light from his Lumos faint behind his back.
“Cleaning spell?” Harry asked. His voice—husky, raw—didn’t sound his own. He pushed his glasses back on his nose.
Without a word, Draco lifted his hands to Harry’s flies and undid the button and zip, pulling his jeans down around his knees. Harry’s cock was already hard and leaking, a wet patch forming on the dark fabric of his tented boxers. Draco licked his lips and looked up.
It’s like flying amidst the heat of Fiendfyre, grappling for Harry with his whole body, thinking he’s about to die — only it’s the exact opposite emotion of that. He’s never felt more
He glances down at his right hand on the sheets. The scar left on the back of it by Umbridge’s punishment in fifth year seems to mock him.
Harry gives her a wry smile. “Before the truth exploded all over our lovely little friendship? Yes. Yeah, I thought he might.”
“In the huge cocks area?” Harry smiles at the sound of Malfoy’s chuckle. He feels silly, making dick jokes in this very moment, but the fact that he made Malfoy laugh lifts some of the tension, and he manages to shuffle into position without too much self-consciousness.
“In your dreams,” he muttered. He wasn’t sure Potter had heard him, but it was for the best. Even he was disappointed by the weakness of his comeback.
Draco felt his face heat. He had just received a compliment for good marks and good behaviour—and to make it worse, he felt pleased and proud about it.
for your own good, Harry. The fact that you don’t even see that makes you even more special. I envied you so much for it — Merlin, I still do. I wish I was as good as you.”
“It’s ridiculous. The Ministry is investigating you. Sooner or later, they’ll find out… and what’s worse, they’ll find out when they’re extra pissed off about having been made to wait.”
to touch him. Make him see. “You listen to me. This is me apologising. This is me promising you, I’ll never hurt you again. Ever.”
When Draco hears his son, he turns mortally pale, his purple-ringed eyes fixed on Harry. There’s a plea in them, in the desperate tilt of his brows. Harry can read Draco’s thoughts as loud as if Draco had spoken them:
and Harry feels it. He hasn’t dared touch Draco since the guests arrived, and he’s itching to reach out under the table and wrap his hand around Draco’s bony knee. Perhaps sitting next to Narcissa Malfoy, who’s watching him like a hawk, isn’t ideal for that endeavour.
Standing in the doorway, one hand on the doorknob, the other in his pocket, looking severe and tall and lean in a dark grey Muggle suit and white shirt, is Draco Malfoy.
Harry’s eyes glinted, hot and turbulent, and he set the crate down before plastering on his own version of a disdainful smile. The stupid bastard looked as fit as he did in Draco’s ridiculous daydreams, and Draco felt a flare of embarrassment and annoyance.
“And what is it?” Draco lifts his chin, tries to inject challenge in his voice. Probably fails miserably, judging by the way Harry’s expression turns compassionate.
Harry shakes his head, as annoyed at Malfoy as he is at himself. He turns his attention back to the stage. The lead danseur has gone off backstage. A flock of tutu-clad ballerinas hop and twirl in time with the bracing music.
Harry wanted to reach out and touch him. He squeezed his hands in his lap instead. “Malfoy…” he started.
“And you, Mr Malfoy,” she turned her stern gaze to Draco, “you probably had career plans, too, though I don’t think I know what they were.”
“Wait, so you’re not going to tell me who you saw here?” Harry tries, but the Petersons come back with another couple in tow, and Hermione’s eyes light up like it’s Christmas.
Harry watches as Malfoy’s eyes scan his CV and his eyebrow shoots up in a sarcastic curve. He points at a line.
His throat is tight all of a sudden, and his hands shake slightly when he rests the folder in his lap. He hasn’t seen Malfoy or heard anything about him in years. As far as he knows, Malfoy fled England shortly after the war. Harry has been abroad on missions most of the time. He’s kept away from the press. He’s never asked anyone about what happened with Malfoy. He just can’t comprehend where the visceral shock comes from, seeing Draco Malfoy’s picture among papers that clearly document a case where he’s considered the prime suspect by the Ministry.
“No. You’ve said it: a mistake. It was a mistake. I know that it is, you know that it is, the people who care about you know that it is. Fuck everyone else.”
Watches as Malfoy’s pupils dilate in understanding. Watches Malfoy’s pale eyebrow lift in a smirking question.
He places a hand in the small of Draco’s back, where his shirt sticks to his sweaty skin. He murmurs a negligent Scourgify
“You could still be… that,” Harry says. “You could still be an Auror. And probably a damn brilliant one at that.”
“Oh, thank you, Draco!” Luna stopped in front of him on her way out of the kitchen. “I’ll be right back. I’m learning so much, this interview is so interesting! But so are
has just walked into the room. That’s when you drop something; that’s the first step.” He opens his hand, and the quill falls to the floor with a light
Harry's had this done to him before. Ginny had wanted to try, and then a few of the girls he’d been with in the short-lived string of hookups he’d had in the wake of his breakup with Ginny.
God, it feels so incredible to be kissing him again. His soft lips move under Harry’s, opening up to let Harry in. Their tongues meet, a sensual, languid touch that fills Harry’s lungs with need and inexpressible joy. He exhales in relief, and feels Draco’s lips tilt up in a small smile as they deepen their kiss.
“And you, in turn, could stop second-guessing my every word. For the sake of our collaboration. We’re on the same team, after all.”
“It’s not my place to tell, Mrs Malfoy. Draco is the most likely to give you an objective evaluation of my performance.”
He’d barely had time to bask in the afterglow of Draco’s orgasm and the rather good job he’d done to elicit it. A small party of guests decided the library of the house was worth visiting, and they’d burst in merely a minute after Draco had come in Harry’s mouth. Harry and Draco had hastily readjusted their clothing — and Harry had swallowed and wiped his mouth — before they’d escaped through the half-opened door while the guests had been looking at some valuable tomes at the other end of the room.
“I want you too, Malfoy,” Harry says, frowning. “But we’re not at Hogwarts anymore, and I’m done playing games with you. So what’s it going to be?”
“Shall we move, Potter? Or did you plan to set camp here for the night?” Malfoy’s haughty drawl resounded yards ahead. He had stopped and turned to scowl at Harry, hands on his hips, imperious.
“No one,” Draco pretended to be absorbed in his search. There had to be a magical solution to his quest for the perfect career—or Harry’s. Harry, at least, had a future career to plan for. He eyed Pansy, who was tapping her foot as though she expected an answer. “What?” he snapped.
Malfoy did. It was possibly the only instance of him heeding a request from Harry, and Harry thrilled with that secret satisfaction. He strode out of the Great Hall as casually as he could with Malfoy in tow.
good… Harry’s knuckles tighten around the coat rack as he struggles to keep his body still. Malfoy gives an eager moan when Harry’s hips shudder, and Harry gives in to the urge to thrust. He slides a hand around the back of Malfoy’s head and threads his fingers in the feathery soft hair, feeling the bob of Malfoy’s head over Harry’s cock, pushing him down on it, fucking Malfoy’s mouth.
“You’ve got to trust me, though. Both of you. I’ve seen him. He’s… no longer the person we used to know. He’s clever and funny and passionate about his job and a brilliant father for his little boy and he… God.” Harry gives his head a shake. Thinking of Draco is painful and bittersweet. “He’d probably kill me if he heard me say that, but he’s gone above and beyond to atone for the stupid, dangerous shit he did when he was a kid. Which is crazy, right? It’s
After several months of patronage, Harry doubts he’s much more knowledgeable about ballet than he was before setting foot in the Royal Opera House for the first time, but he’s certain of one thing: he’ll go to see Swan Lake alone on Saturday. Ron and Hermione have dinner plans, some anniversary or another that Harry isn’t part of; Ginny is in Romania, introducing her new boyfriend to Charlie; Luna and Neville are leading a dig near the Loch Ness. Harry doesn’t have that many close friends to begin with, and all of them are paired up — not to mention unavailable on a Saturday night.
“Have fun?” Harry says, starting to walk away as Ron sends him a forlorn look and lets Hermione pull him into another conversation.
Ignoring the twisting feeling in his gut that wasn’t only fear and adrenaline, he ran faster, hand in hand with Malfoy.
“Impressive,” he murmured. Draco canted his head to look at him. Harry was gazing at him, green eyes intense and melancholy. Draco swallowed.
And just like that, Harry is standing in front of him naked, with only his round glasses on, and Draco’s throat has gone dry. He lets his gaze travel Harry’s body, his broad shoulders and the graceful wings of his collarbones, his strong chest and flat belly and the dark hair trailing down from his navel to the thatch of curls surrounding his cock. It’s dark and thick and it twitches slightly as it fills under Draco’s gaze, and Draco swallows down an embarrassing sound of want. He looks back at Harry’s face. He wants to smile at him, but it feels forced. He curses his lack of experience — his lack of spontaneity. How do other people do this? Draco wants — oh, how he
Harry bristles for a second, taken aback by the force of the protectiveness he feels for Scorpius. Ron doesn’t know Scorpius, he reminds himself. He still thinks of Draco as the boy they knew at Hogwarts — not the most positive image one could have of him.
“Do you eat breakfast with them?” He asks instead, eyeing the large quantities of food being prepared.
“Hey, Malfoy?” Ron poked him in the side. He nodded towards the back door. “Harry's waited for your ferret face long enough.” Draco wasn’t sure whether he meant tonight, or much longer than that. With a wistful smile, Ron patted him on the shoulder. “Go get him, mate.”
