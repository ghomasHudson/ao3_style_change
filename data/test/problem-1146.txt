"Silence please!" She said and the entire hall immediately filled with silence. "Good evening!" McGonnagal said loudly, "What an honour it is to stand here where Dumbledore once stood. I feel so happy to be the new headmistress of Hogwarts."
Narcissa smiled and even Lucius
Harry nodded, mouth filled with strawberries. "I am." Harry said after swallowing, "I really am."
When Draco woke up, Potter was already awake. "You took off my clothes," he said sheepishly.
"Can we stop somewhere before we go home?"
He stood up and walked to their bathroom.
"Malfoy.", Harry whispered again, this time more loudly. Malfoy groaned.
And he had said it.
"No. Obviously," Draco answered annoyed and had to throw up again.
Draco pulled away and fumbled with Harry's boxer shorts. His hands were shaking and Harry held them.
that his grandfather had invented.
Potter smiled and Draco kissed him very hard. So hard they both fell backwards on the old bed. Now Draco was lying on top of the scarred idiot. He really was an idiot, messing with Draco like this. But Draco couldn't concern himself with that right now. His whole body was tingling and his heart jumped up and down, pounding in the same rhythm as Draco and Potter were grinding against each other. Draco felt as though he didn't get enough air in his lungs. Everything was so exciting.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "It's really not that easy," he said and Harry furrowed his brow.
So Harry dragged Draco upstairs and shoved him into his bedroom. This was not how he had imagined Draco to land in his bed.
"Draco. They are wonderful. I love them.", Harry said and climbed into Draco's lap.
"For taking his name." Narcissa smiled slightly and emptied her wineglass, "But son, I am happy for you."
He hid behind his newspapers again and kept reading, so did Hermione. Harry sighed and drank his tea.
"What do you mean?"
Harry smiled.
"Look."
"What do you want to know?", he asked.
"I want to talk to your family.", Draco answered and Harry coughed loudly.
It was strange. During the war, Draco had used to talk to himself sometimes, so he didn't feel all alone, but every now and then it just came back. Although, Draco still felt alone.
Silence swept over them again, but this time it wasn't as uncomfortable. Harry even slid back towards Malfoy, but only so close he didn't quite touch him. Harry heard Malfoy's slow breathing and couldn't keep his eyes off the simultaneously rising and falling chest. Maybe Malfoy didn't notice it, but even if he did he didn't say anything. Malfoy looked extremely tired, but Harry didn't want to mention it because he thought Malfoy would leave then. And funnily enough Harry didn't want him to leave.
Ron laughed and joined Harry and his godson on the carpet. "And he didn't take it very well, I assume?"
He felt really tipsy - no, tipsy wasn't enough. He was somewhere between really tipsy and drunk.
Harry had looked at the ring on his finger for about a hundred times before Ginny came up to him.
"Harry, are you sure?", Hermione asked.
"I better get back down before my friends worry about me," Harry said, trying to escape the silence.
Hermione opened hers and she, too, had Harry. Dean stumbled into their compartment.
"This is a boggart.
No one said anything. Harry was sure Neville hadn't told Luna, but he was also sure that Luna would never get in a fight with someone who didn't
Hermione nodded and continued writing down her notes.
Harry nodded. They were both right and they still were back at the beginning. Harry still didn't know if he should go and Malfoy would be coming back in four days, so he had to decide quickly.
"You were saying you haven't told your friends that we met." Malfoy said, "And then I said I haven't told mine either."
. Bad Draco, really bad Draco. He was
"I don't know, mate." Ron said, shoving another bite of eggs into his mouth, "I think you should let the git-"
But as it seemed, the message hasn't spread that far, because as they entered the shop together, no one stared, no one whispered and no one made nasty remarks.
"Mr. Malfoy, I have to ask you to be kind to Potter. I know you have had your differences in the past, but I hope you can put them aside for his sake. He isn't allowed to be exposed to stressful situations, that includes nightmares. In the last years I have learned that Potter tends to have nightmares, so I need you to be on full alert at night."
"Come on. Tell us."
"What's wrong?", Ron asked. Harry looked at him.
"And there was the thing with your father. I read about it in the Prophet." Blaise interrupted Draco.
"Do you have a problem with that?" Potter asked after they had been quiet for a few minutes.
"No, Ron. I won't accept this git stealing my best friend!", Granger said and now everything came clear to Draco's mind.
"About the holidays: I have thought about it for a longer time now and I think I would like to spend it with Potter. He was in the hospital now for such a long time and I would really like to see where and how he lives and I would like to see his child-thing. And maybe, if you would agree, I would like to invite him over to the Manor for a few days. I still need to ask him, but I wanted to ask your permission first.
"It's from Hogwarts." Harry said after a look at the seal on the letter.
"Want to go to the library?", Draco asked.
"I'm fine Hermione.", said Harry, although that was not completely true.
Harry and Hermione looked at Ron.
"Hi." Draco said.
It was no surprise that everyone looked at them and whispered hysterically. Three Prophets lay on the table, one on the couch, five people were reading it, one girl held it in her hand and two boys threw it back on the table. Harry tried as good as possible to ignore them, but he felt, that Draco couldn't do it as good as Harry. Harry was used to be subject No.1, Draco wasn't. He pressed Harry's hand and gritted his teeth.
"Yeah, me too.", Longbottom agreed nodding.
"Hey, boys!", she said and snipped with her finger in front of their faces. Harry blinked irritated.
Hermione widened her eyes. "Are you saying that Harry should keep something as important as this from his boyfriend-to-be?"
After ten minutes of standing in front of the mirror and picking at his hair, Draco left the room and wanted to go to the Great Hall, but then he stopped. He just couldn't leave the bed like this. No. This was Potter's bed, it was Potter's responsibility. But- no! Draco took a few more steps. But Draco was the one that has rolled around in it all day. He turned around and hurried back, made the bed and then closed the door satisfied.
Before Harry could answer he heard Ron shouting in the background:
? Not Weasel or Weaselbee or Weasley or red-head. Just Ron.
He took a sip from his still hot tea, but that didn't prevent Ron from asking the next question.
He started eating his bread, but it didn't taste as good as it did without a unconscious boyfriend next to him and this horrible smell in his nose.
"None of your business.", Malfoy said, suddenly scowling and lay back down in his bed. Harry was taken aback. Had he done something wrong? He walked over to Malfoy's bed and looked at him.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Don't be like that, idiot."
"Ginny said we should go and see that new shop down the street.", Hermione explained.
"True.", Ron said and smiled.
"To be honest, I don't know. Maybe she will, maybe she won't. But if you want to, I can talk to her ans tell her that I didn't broke up with her because of you. Then she will have no reason for attaching you.", Potter suggested.
"For telling me." Draco smiled and pressed a kiss to Potter's lips.
"Because Harry wouldn't want you here.", she answered. Draco froze.
"Be nice," Potter mouthed silently. Draco rolled his eyes, but he made an effort to be as nice as he could.
As he came back, Potter waited on the couch and held an old book in his hand. The black leather cover was already a bit frayed and it looked very old.
"He's not the
Draco raised his eyebrows. Potter really knew how to get a guy. They walked up to the common room, which was luckily empty. Draco followed the Gryffindor to their room. Before they had even locked the door, they were all over each other. Kissing, grinding, moaning, sweating. They clothes left piece by piece. They were against the door, the wall, the desk, the bed. And finally
He has been lying in his bed for merely two minutes when the door opened and Potter stepped into their dorm. Draco ignored him and kept reading his magazine.
Theo nodded wordlessly. He flipped the page of his newspaper and kept reading in silence. Draco didn't mind. He waved his wand, a cup came floating outside and the teapot filled it with tea. With another flick, the milk poured itself into the cup and Draco grabbed it, drinking carefully.
"Are you feeling better?" He asked.
"Then lose them. I don't care.", Harry said, grabbed his bag and left the Hall.
"Say my name and I'll say yours." Malfoy suddenly whispered into Harry's ear.
"Well, I- yes.", Draco said.
"What? No! For what?" Malfoy said suddenly very loud, "You didn't do anything wrong! This guy is an asshole who doesn't know what he's talking about."
Harry looked at Malfoy in disbelief.
With that, the conversation was ended. The whole train ride Blaise and Draco just sat there and looked out of the window. The frightened lady with the food trolley came inside twice and Draco bought something to eat and drink. Then he slept until Blaise woke him up.
"Everyone gather round!", he said loudly.
Malfoy only nodded without saying a word. Harry walked into the living room where Ron and Hermione packed their bags, but Malfoy didn't follow right away. When he stepped into the living room, there was a clear tension between all of them.
"Harry!"
Harry and Ron looked at each other with surprised faces.
"Draco.", Potter said quietly.
Harry must be out of his mind. He was only
"Can we visit your uncle?"
Harry looked at him. What was going on here? He waited a long time, until he touched Malfoy carefully at his shoulders.
"I mean you wouldn't lock yourself away if there would be nothing going on." Pansy said.
"You've been thinking about him a lot lately." Said Ron matter-of-factly.
"When's the next task?", Draco asked and sounded somehow scared.
"He was in the Order of the Phoenix. He was the best friend of my parents and after...", Harry swallowed, "after Sirius' death, he was always there for me."
"The closest thing I had to a family was-" Harry felt his throat tighten, "Sirius. My godfather."
"What are you going to do with your hair today?", Ron asked and Harry laughed again.
"Thanks for helping me with him." Harry said when he made dinner and Ron cuddled with the red-haired boy on the couch.
Not this too, Draco thought. He hoped his name wouldn't be mentioned in the article. His father would be furious if he would read that Draco walked around school blowing people up and causing trouble. Instead of driving himself crazy, Draco decided to open page nine and read the article while walking to class.
"I'm staying.", Draco interrupted him. Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry opened his mouth to say something, but Malfoy's aggressive look stopped him. Harry figured Malfoy wanted to speak for himself, but Harry had never seen Malfoy trying so hard not to say something rude.
"Yeah, thanks," Harry snorted.
Dumbledore nodded smiling. "The ghosts told me you will be meeting students?"
Then Harry turned to Lydia, who was still smiling at Draco and he was kind of feeling pity for her. That poor girl had no idea what was coming.
Draco nodded. Now, he recognised the face of his former teacher again.
"Yup.", Draco said grinning. Harry laughed and shook his head.
"Nothing," one of the boys said and sounded very afraid of Draco, what satisfied him.
"Don't you dare ever telling me about this again!", Ron said and shook himself.
"Lucius, I say it again, he is your
It has been Ron's idea to have Malfoy come over for dinner and to order a pizza, because he said without Hermione here they could use some company. So they sat together and ate and actually had a pretty decent time. Harry figured without Hermione, Ron had to talk to someone and he knew that.
"Malfoy, will you leave us alone for a second?", Ron asked.
"We should get dressed." Hermione said and the two boys agreed.
"Now, your money.", he said and the others put their hands in their pockets and pulled out coins. Harry looked at them quizzical.
"Harry Potter.", she said, "My best wishes to your birthday."
Hermione and Ron looked at each other and Harry knew exactly what they were thinking: he shouldn't go. To his surprise, Ron didn't blurt anything out, instead he picked up his fork and started working on his scrambled eggs again. Also Hermione surprised him.
"No thanks." Draco replied, even though he and Theo both knew the thanks was just pure formality.
This was the perfect birthday.
Hermione smiled and hugged Harry tightly. "Write us." She said as if Harry would go on a year-long journey.
"Here," Malfoy said.
"I know."
"Stop stammering, Potter.", Malfoy said and his face softened.
"You're being very rude again. Sneaking into my bed to molest me.", Draco accused, even as he rubbed his nose against Potter's. The nose was cold, too.
"How did your exams go?" Potter asked all of a sudden.
His hair was ruffled, his lips were pink and well-kissed, his cheeks were rosy and his pyjama was a simple mess.
and Potter said they had to watch this one because it was a classic. Of course Draco didn't know that it was a classic and he didn't know what exactly made this one a classic, but he saw how happy Potter looked and so he just went with it.
Ron sighed and scratched his nose. "Then we could go by Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Haven't seen Fred in a while."
"What are you looking at?" He asked Malfoy annoyed.
"Good.", Draco answered. Potter nodded and stood up.
"It's Pigwidgeon.", he said and let the tiny owl in.
"Pettigrew.", Draco said disgusted.
The door opened and Neville and Luna looked inside. "Can we join you?" Luna asked and the trio nodded.
"Say it again.", Potter said.
"The sun.", Harry answered.
"Because it's private, you idiot.", answered Harry, rolling his eyes.
Neville glanced at Ron, who didn't know what to say. "This doesn't mean you love him. What you wrote in the letter says more than enough. And frankly I don't need to know anything else," Ron said coldly and wanted to get up, but Malfoy grabbed his wrist.
Malfoy looked at him sheepishly and Harry saw he hid his smile. Harry got on his knees to gather the pieces of broken glass, but Malfoy stopped him.
He did.
"You know... the one night in our room..."
"I guess." George answered, "It's just- I miss him."
Draco pulled away and looked into a terrified face.
This put tears in Harry's eyes. He knew Malfoy's parents wouldn't approve, but he didn't expect it to be so horrible for Malfoy. But Harry still couldn't quite imagine it to be this drastic. Again, no one talked. Ron swallowed thickly but didn't answer, he only stared at the ground and colour came back to his face. Luna took Neville's hand and Neville smiled proudly. Harry felt a tear rolling down his cheek. Hermione shifted closer to Ron and lay her hand on his shoulder. He looked up at her and she nodded towards Harry, who was silently crying now and smiling at Malfoy. Ron stood up. Harry was afraid he would leave, but when he walked towards Malfoy, Harry was afraid he would punch him. Instead, Ron shook Malfoy's hand and leaned in to whisper something.
Harry stared at him. Draco's hair shone in the light of the fire and his grey eyes sparkled. Harry couldn't believe this was happening. And if that hadn't been enough, Draco went down on one knee and pulled out a tiny box from his coat pocket. Harry clapped a hand in front of his mouth.
"Fuck!", he cursed loudly, "Fuck!"
"I'm taking that one.", Malfoy slammed his trunk on the bed left of the door.
"Harry, how's Malfoy when you are in your room?" Dean asked. Harry shrugged. He didn't feel like answering the question.
, Harry thought.
Harry did as he was told and now he saw what Malfoy had meant. Harry's face went completely blank.
Not long after that, Harry heard the door to his room being opened and someone came inside.
"If you believe me or not, I am worried about you.", he said. Draco blinked. He was?
"Aunt Petunia. Uncle Vernon.", he said and nodded.
"Malfoy.", he said. Malfoy's blankets ruffled and he stood up to.
Harry paused and Malfoy eyed him carefully, but remained silent.
"I wasn't." Ron said, "Told her you probably found someone and stayed a little longer."
"Two dollar and sixty cents.", he answered and Draco could feel the red on his cheeks deepening.
"Oh, shut up.", Harry said and rolled his eyes.
"What?", he asked.
Harry smiled and stood up. He was relieved to see a little smile quirking on Malfoy's lips as well. He walked back to his own bed and lay down. He decided to teach Malfoy how to produce a full Patronus with every cost.
"So...", Harry said nervously.
"Shut up, you know what I mean.",  Draco said and rolled his eyes. Potter laughed.
"What do you want to know?"
"I didn't mean for this to go like it did. It's just-"
"He didn't have to be so cruel to us." Past-Harry would answer and Present-Harry would think he was right.
"Let's go then," Longbottom said when Draco joined the group in the common room. He followed them down the stairs, over the grounds, through the main building and down to the station.
Harry watched Draco sit up.
Harry was glad that not another fight spawned because of his relationship.
But Harry couldn't enjoy the dance for long. A group of tipsy girls squeezed themselves between Harry and his friends and started dancing around him. Harry looked at his friends helplessly and hoped someone would get him out of there.
"I don't think so," Malfoy said and looked around. A lot of people were already staring at them curiously.
Harry was relieved. He looked at Ron, expecting him to say something.
"Me? Never. I'm great enough to be not.", Draco answered with a smirk on his lips. Harry laughed.
Even though they were shouting, you could barely hear them, because of the loud music.
"Thanks." He said, but hoped Malfoy wouldn't take off now.
"I already have a hard-on. so we have to stand here for a little longer.", Draco answered and Harry chuckled.
"You're extremely fickle. Did anyone ever tell you that?"
"I hate it to have you as my roommate!" Harry shouted.
They put on their dress robes, what felt to Harry like the most beautiful feeling in the world. He was very excited to come back - back home.
Potter responded immediately, capturing Draco's bottom lip and attempting to suck on it. Draco couldn't help gasping and pulling away with every thrust of his hips, grateful that Potter's mouth recaptured his lips every time.
Even though it seemed frightening at first, the Manor was actually very impressive with it's high ceilings and big windows. Malfoy stopped in front of a room almost at the end of the hallway and Harry figured there must be his room behind it.
He only shook his head and narrowed his eyes, then he pointed at the claudron. Harry understood
"You should be, you've been studying for it for the last few years. Well not last year, we've been a bit occupied there," Ron said and everyone -except Malfoy- laughed.
Hearing these words from Harry's mouth must have been too much for Malfoy, because he fixed his gaze on the terrace doors behind Harry and didn't answer. Harry looked at him in silence for a short moment and Malfoy got up.
Harry and Seamus followed him with their eyes. As much as Harry loved Malfoy, he couldn't deny that Sam /was/ extremely handsome.
"What?", Granger snapped at him.
Potter came back with a small box in his hands.
"Hm?", he asked and Ron gave him a meaningful look.
"About what?" He asked confused.
Draco didn't
Harry rolled himself on top of Draco and bent down to kiss him. He pressed kisses to his jaw and down his neck. Draco groaned slightly.
"What is your relationship to Mr. Malfoy?"
"No, Draco, I do." Harry stopped him, took another deep breath and continued. "I lost Sirius in fifth year. I was too small to remember when I lost my parents, but I was fifteen when I lost my godfather. I will never forget that. I will never forget his face when he got hit by that spell and fell through the Veil."
"Malfoy-" Potter said and lay his hand on Draco's shoulder to stop him from doing something stupid. "Draco," Potter said and thought this would have more effect, but Draco ignored him.
Harry smiled gently.
Draco smiled and Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's pale lips. Harry hugged him and Draco buried his face into Harry's shoulder. Harry stroked Draco's beautiful soft hair, smiling. Draco sniffed.
"She just wants us to talk alone," Potter stopped Draco before he could say anything negative.
Ron looked at Neville with wide eyes. He was just as overwhelmed with the situation as Neville himself was.
"Please, Potter, you can go, I want to eat in the kitchens and to be honest, I don't really fancy sitting with your friends.", he said and Potter stopped walking. He looked at Draco, who didn't move a muscle.
"What have I missed in Transfiguration?", Harry asked after their two Herbology lessons.
"Hm?", she
"Don't know many Muggles." Draco mumbled, "But they are."
"Malfoy, please talk to me," Harry begged.
"Off.", he ordered, frustrated when he couldn't pull them down himself.
"You. From what family do
"No, forget it, I don't want to be disrespectful. I don't want you to get offended."
"Then go. Fulfill your duty, hero of our world.", he said mockingly.
"Well I'm sorry but this is all your fault, Potter!" Draco shouted and Potter turned around.
Draco felt stinging pain in his chest and he breathed slowly. With every breath he took, the pain got stronger. His knees felt weak and he sunk to the floor.
"Malfoy. Hey. I didn't expect you to be here.", Harry said. Malfoy rolled his eyes as Harry sat down. Two elves brought him his  breakfast.
"Who were they?" Harry asked eagerly, "Do you know them?"
"Don't be sorry for every shit.", he said and smiled.
"You know, Romilda," Harry liked the way he could talk to her when he sat here in this office on this chair and she came to ask for his advice, "I think everyone knows I don't have the best history with Slytherins. And I'm sure everyone knows that I didn't play a very comfortable role in the war. So what would you do if I told you I am friends with a Slytherin now?"
wanted to see Potter again. And Potter's favorite ice cream - oh Merlin!
room. Harry is old enough, he can take care of himself," Longbottom said sternly.
"Oh, I have already eaten, thanks. But I'd like a hot chocolate.", Harry answered.
And his signature, which was simply perfect. Draco looked at Harry.
The night went on and the more often Harry and Malfoy went outside for Malfoy to have a cigarette, the colder and darker the night got. A lot of Harry's friends had planned something fun for the night. Seamus and Dean thought it would be fun to play "Truth or Drink". And of course, Harry had to be the first one to get on stage for this stupid game, but luckily he should bring another friend to play with him. So Harry took Ron.
"Ron!", she said outraged. Ron snorted and sat down next to Neville.
"I'm paired with Padma! That's so great!" Hermione said happily and Harry was very happy for her.
"You don't want to fight me!" Draco shouted loudly.
"Sirius, be quiet!", the voice shouted.
"Draco. Sweetheart.", he said and grinned.
Draco nodded and walked towards his father, who stood there with a conflicted expression. Draco spread his arms and a relieved smile hushed over Lucius' lips.
about his father. Potter was the only one he had.
"Harry, I'm sorry about what I said earlier. You know, I'm just still trying to figure out what's going on inside your head."
Weasley furrowed his brow. "We know that."
"How much?", Ron asked Draco.
*ATTENTION*
"Will show up here more often?", Draco repeated Potter's words with a smirk. Potter laughed.
Potter folded the letter, put it in his pocket and looked at the minister, who chewed on his lip with a nervous look.
"Malfoy.", Weasley said with a not-even-close sneer.
"Talk," Neville ordered.
"You should probably get ready, though." Seamus reminded Harry.
"No, Potty-baby. This is real-life."
Everything started to spin and get blurry. Draco looked at the bottle, it was almost half empty. He laughed while he cried and coughed.
Draco shook his head. "I'm not going."
. Draco was astonished.
Harry snorted.
"I get it, Harry, but Professor McGonnagal is deciding this, not us." Hermione said.
"Shht!", Harry shushed him and kissed him.
"Shut it, Malfoy." Potter snapped and Draco was surprised by this reaction.
Malfoy nodded and drank from his lemonade. This was weird. This was a very weird situation. The two of them - Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy - sitting together in a pub and talking like they haven't hated each other for seven years. And completely sober at that.
Ron nodded enthusiastically, his mouth filled with mashed potatoes. Harry agreed as well.
"Professor McGonnagal was furious that you weren't there.", Hermione said.
"I see your point." Ron said nodding, "But imagine if, just
Harry jumped as the door was opened.
Again, Harry nodded. He closed his eyes for a second to gather his thoughts. Tears rolled down Harry's face, but he wouldn't let Draco know, he didn't want him to think he put Harry in a horrible position. After all, Harry
"W- How much have you heard?", he asked.
Draco felt ridiculous. He shouldn't need the approval of his friends, he's his own person and his father raised him to make his own decisions. Draco nodded, shortly looked at himself in the mirror again and then turned around to leave. Blaise and Theo pushed him towards the door when the feeling overcame Draco the he shouldn't go. He wasn't supposed to be excited about this. He shouldn't go. He wasn't welcomed there.
." Harty said.
Draco pressed their lips together, his tongue visibly sliding into Harry's mouth, what have Harry chills. In a very good way. The girl cringed.
, do you?", asked Draco.
"Nice," Malfoy answered shortly.
"And you two?" Hermione asked, probably expecting them to do something together.
Harry nodded and told Malfoy he should wait where he was and he apparated to his room, where he threw off the wet clothes, grabbed a towel to dry himself and his hair and put on new clothes. Harry threw a look at his closet and rolled his eyes. Malfoy was so extra, shy couldn't he just wear something of Harry's? Before Harry apparated again, he grabbed the Quidditch magazine on his desk. A few seconds later Harry found himself in front of an apartment door. He knocked and Theodore Nott opened.
"Thanks, Harry."
Harry smiled.
"I did what I had to do! I did what was expected of me!"
Potter had tried to talk to Draco until this very day. It was Monday and Draco was heading to his classroom, where he found Potter, Weasley and the Mudblood. But Potter didn't jump up to stop Draco and talk to him. Even though Draco waited a few seconds before going out the door after the lesson, Potter didn't look at him. Potter giving up on talking to Draco made him even angrier than he was when Potter annoyed him everywhere. The more Draco hated Potter the more Draco wanted Potter to like him. He was on an emotional rollercoaster.
Harry felt heat rising to his cheeks. He tried to fight it, but he was getting more and more angry at Ron with every word that he spoke. Harry knew he was upset, but this was not the right time nor the right place for this discussion.
Draco watched intently and brought Harry's fingers to his own mouth and sucked, eliciting a moan from the other. Harry watched his chocolate covered fingers slip into Draco's mouth and withdraw clean.
Harry smiled.
Harry nodded.
"You want to get to know the real me?" He said, walked around the table and grabbed Harry's wrist.
"Nervous. I'll break your hand.", Draco said and shrugged excusing and Potter smiled.
"Hi, how can I help you?"
"So how about your favorite country? Where would you like to go some day?" Harry asked.
"Why is that?" Harry asked.
from you." Draco said. He was.
"And I kept many things that have been in this house for many years. This book is only one of the many things. In fifth year, we had to throw out many of the things that reminded Sirius on his childhood, but Kreacher stole a lot of these and smuggled them upstairs. I kept these things."
Harry dragged himself upstairs, closed the bathroom door and threw his clothes to the floor. In the shower, finally, Harry broke down and cried. He should have stayed at home and wait for Malfoy to get back. But would that have been better? Now Harry knew how both of them really felt, now he knew he wasn't fine with it. Harry tilted his head back, closed his eyes and let the water wash his tears away. He had an ugly feeling in his stomach like he was about to vomit, but couldn't.
"Have you read the Prophet since you've been here?" Malfoy asked.
"Harry!"
"Bye, Malfoy.", she said as she walked past him. He sneered at her.
Next thing he knew, Harry stood on the familiar gravel driveway between large hedges. He felt a cold shiver going down his spine and somehow couldn't make his feet move. Harry gulped and looked at the wrought-iron gates that he had already stood in front of. What was he doing here? He couldn't be here - why did he think he could? Harry wanted to turn around, but Bond hooted in his cage. Harry looked upwards and saw Malfoy's eagle owl descending from a window and rose high into the air. Harry figured the window must belong to Draco's room.
"No! I wont let this boy ruin my son!", Mr Malfoy answered.
"It is." Harry nodded, "But I'm trying. So is he."
"As far as I remeber, you already did.", he said and kissed Potter on the forehead.
Malfoy stood up, took off his sweater and put on a black shirt.
Harry thought. He had around eight hours to get awake. Ron announced that he was going to take a shower before he would run out of time. Hermione smiled and Ron left her and Harry alone. Hermione must have thought this might be a good opportunity to annoy Harry some more. She leaned towards him and looked at him with big trustful eyes.
"So, Draco. We haven't been talking much lately. What's going on with you?" Blaise asked all of a sudden.
"The first?", he asked surprised.
"No idea.", he said.
"Draco, what the hell?" Blaise said loudly.
As he had imagined, a pack of witches came running towards him just before he turned the corner to his street. They must have come from Diagon Alley, because they had bags that Harry immediately recognized as Madam Malkin's.
"Levicorpus!", he said and the three people rose into mid-air. Potter laughed as Petunia squealed loudly. Draco laughed as well and walked with Potter to the door.
"Draco Lucius Potter," Harry started, "almost exactly eight months ago, just days after our first encounter at Diagon Alley, we sat in a diner and talked. You told me you would like to go to France someday, visit Paris."
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Okay so how about you just start by telling us what happened when you got there."
Harry laughed. "You mean when I met you and you hid behind a shelf?"
"Let's start with something harmless."
Harry smiled and his heart fluttered. So Malfoy
Harry flipped to said page and read aloud.
Potter, Granger and Weasley had been sitting on Potter's bed, had hugged each other and cried. As Draco came back to his room amd saw these babies crying because the time at Hogwarts was over now, he could have easily sat next to them and cried as well.
"I can't believe he just let you walk away." Hermione said.
And then something inside Draco clicked.
"We're having class now," Potter refused.
Harry laughed at the pathetic sight and slammed the door behind himself. Back in the living room, he found that Teddy had started to cry and Harry took him off Ginny's arms. Cradling the tiny boy in his arms, Harry sat down on the couch. He hummed a melody and watched Teddy's eyes slowly falling shut.
Harry furrowed his brow and nodded.
Malfoy nodded. "Let's sit."
"Good morning." Harry grinned.
"Malfoy!", he said loudly, before he could stop himself, but Malfoy didn't react.
"Dinner is almost ready." Ron said and levitated the plates and silverware to the table.
"Why? Because the holidays are over and we have classes?", Draco scoffed and Harry laughed.
"Sleep now, Potter.", Malfoy said.
His lips opened against Potter's, his tongue sliding like honey, and Potter tried to hold on, to make it last, but his body was already flooding with pleasure. He groaned into Draco's mouth, coming and coming until he was shaking with it, and Draco kissed him all through it and then pushed him down onto the pillows to kiss him some more.
"Fine.", he said.
"For heaven's sake! Everyone!", Draco answered loudly.
"I think you're going to like that." Malfoy said before opening the door with a proud smile on his lips.
and that asshole thought he had to start a fight."
"I went to a diner to sober up a bit." Harry half-lied.
"Okay Harry, your birthday is one week from now." Hermione stated at breakfast as if Harry didn't know it himself.
Hermione sighed.
Draco stood up abruptly, the covers slipping down. Harry stared at his ass, that looked so good in these boxers, but Nott looked somewhere else.
Harry sighed. This was horrible. He couldn't understand how people were still thinking like that, thinking there is only good and evil. Harry always had to think about Sirius when a topic like that would come up. He could hear Sirius's voice in his head saying "The world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters." Harry got up and changed into his pyjama a nicely knitted one (by Mrs Weasley of course). Halfway through, with both hands in the sleeves of his sweater, Harry looked at Draco and sighed.
"You know what, I wasn't sure if I should tell you, but now I don't care. I had horrible dreams about you for the last few weeks and I couldn't sleep thinking about you and Voldemort!"
Holy moly. Maybe Harry
And just because Madame Pomfrey was right about the Daily Prophet and the glorious headline.
"Good.", Malfoy said and left.
"See you later." Ron said smiling and opened the door for Hermione.
"Bloody hell.", Ron said and Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth.
"I don't hate you too."
"We made sure you weren't doing anything stupid," Longbottom said.
"Draco, it's lunchtime. Come out."
"I can't believe it!" Harry looked around for a healer. "Excuse me?" He said as he found one.
"Are you alright?", he asked and sat down next to him.
"What did they talk about normally?", Harry asked.
"I know," Harry replied and stroked her hair.
He sat down on the couch in the living room and saw that Theo was cooking dinner - with magic of course. Blaise and Theo sat down each next to Draco.
Harry smiled apologetically and caught up with Malfoy shortly before they reached their door.
Malfoy nodded and sipped at his tea before he got up too. He followed Harry wordlessly to the staircase to the roof. Harry peeked upstairs and as he was assured that the rain had stopped, he climbed the steps, Malfoy following.
Malfoy nodded. Harry smiled and swung his bag over his shoulder.
"Where are you going?", Draco asked.
And with that, Harry felt his whole body tingling. It felt like his brain stopped working, but his heart was doing just the opposite. Harry's knees felt weak and he didn't know why. He'd heard before that he looked like his father, but hearing it from Malfoy was... it was different. Harry was shocked by the sound of his glass falling to the floor. Somehow his hands were shaking and sweating so much he must have lost grip on the glass and it just slipped out if his fingers.
"No. It's about Ginny.", Harry said.
"You think I do what you want me to?" Potter laughed.
"Haha. Great.", Harry answered coldly.
He screwed his face up in the darkness. He didn’t want to think about this – Malfoy stroking himself with those long fingers, his body jerking into his own fist...
! Draco couldn't believe his eyes,
Draco laughed and Harry closed his eyes. He felt his heart beating slower and slower. Draco rolled to his side and kissed Harry on his cheek.
"So, what have you and your new friend been doing?" Draco asked and feigned interest.
"Eww, okay! I got it! No details!", Ron said and pressed his hands onto his ears as Harry started talking about Draco's cock. Harry lauged.
Harry's eyes darted from Malfoy's eyes to his lips, to his shaking hands in his lap and back to his eyes that were now closed. Harry couldn't imagine what was going on in Malfoy's head right now, but he wished Malfoy would tell him. Malfoy sighed exhausted and Harry got the feeling that he could go right back to sleep.
Harry nodded. This was very out of the blue. "Yes, it's going pretty good. I never thought I'd say this, but Malfoy's great."
He had caramel-brown eyes and short brown hair. His uniform was just on point, the tie a bit loose. Harry looked at him for a long time. The boy had full pink lips, that he constantly bit out of nervousness.
his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days. Potter's hand gently rested on the banister and a silver watch glistened on his wrist. It was obvious he had tried to comb his hair. And his clothes... he wore a dark green turtleneck pullover that toned his muscular body, a white scarf wrapped around his neck and a very classy coat in the same colour as the pullover over it. Potter looked into the crowd and as he turned his head, Draco saw a silver earring sparkle beneath his wild black hair.
"This is a joke, right?" Ron asked and Hermione shook her head.
But what Harry really couldn't wrap his head around was the way he thought to describe Malfoy afterwards - looking healthy and not at all ugly. Of course, he had never been ugly, there were a lot of people less appealing. Not that Malfoy was appealing - at least not to Harry. He furrowed his brow. What was going on? He was all weird and strangely accurate.
Harry nodded grinning and Draco rolled his eyes, but grinned as well. Harry lay back down next to him and nuzzled at Malfoy's neck, what made Malfoy moan a little. They didn't do anything else, though, for Malfoy had to rest. Harry's heart felt like it was going to jump out when Malfoy rested his head on Harry's chest. Harry traced his fingers through the soft silver hair and smiled. This was it. This was all he wanted.
"Want to see the rest of the house?", Potter asked and Draco nodded.
Malfoy looked at Harry and swallowed the last bit of his licorice wand. "I saw you through the window of Hogsmeade and you looked bored and annoyed so I thought I'd grab the opportunity and try to be nice to you. It's not an everyday thing that I try to be nice to you, let alone anyone, so just appreciate it and stop asking questions."
"Hey.", Potter said smiling. Draco looked at him, smiled too and then scowled at the others.
In the morning, Draco's back hurt and his head felt heavy. His legs had fallen asleep in the middle of the night. Draco wasn't sure if he had slept and if he did, it could have been only a couple of hours. With a lot of trouble, he got up, wiggled his feet to wake up his legs, and went into the bathroom.
"And then we got back here, just in time for an owl to arrive. It was a howler from Draco's father.", Harry continued.
"Liar!", Granger shouted and Weasley pulled her down on the sleeve of her robe.
Never! What a horrible dream this must be. Harry shook his head. Harry hated him. He hated him!
"Dunno." He mumbled, shoving a croissant into his mouth.
"Shht!", Draco shushed him. Harry looked at him, then followed Draco's case to the door.
"As much as I like standing here and talking to you, I need to go back to my harmed boyfriend who might want me to be with him.", Draco said and smirked slightly.
"It's- it's really hard for me to tell you this." He breathed out heavily again and closed his eyes once more.
"An owl came for you," Potter continued.
"Sorry, professor-" Draco started, but she waved away.
Harry shot a glare at Zabini and grabbed Draco's chin and forced him to look up. Draco had no time to say a word or even blink before Harry pressed a forceful kiss to his lips, pushing his tongue into Draco's mouth, headless of Draco's attempts to pull back.
Harry and Ron said goodbye to Hermione, Neville and Dean, who joined the rest of the students in the Entrance Hall. Professor Sprout was already waiting for the first-years. Harry and Ron went to Headmistress McGonagall's office.
"I won't.", Harry said.
Harry started to laugh and Malfoy joined in. They sat on the bed, both naked, and laughed for quite a while. Draco pulled out some of Harry's clothes from the closet and put them on, making sure he looked good. Whem he had his final outfit (Harry had finished way earlier), Harry handed him his leather jacket.
"If this isn't Mr Malfoy senior and junior. Good morning.", Harry said brightly.
"It may be quite simple, but now that it's done..." Fleur's and Bill's beutiful voices echoed through the night.
"I talked to him.", Harry said.
"I was. Admit it.", he said.
"What- Malfoy, what are you doing?" Ron asked and pointed at Draco's face, "What is
"No, I am free for you. Have a seat," the headmistress offered.
"Okay," Harry just said.
"Tell us, Harry, does Malfoy call you anything else but
"She's a very good dancer." Ron said.
"You are so cute!" Fleur said with her charming accent.
When the tea was ready, Harry sat on the opposite of Malfoy at the table and they started sipping their drinks.
"Malfoy!" He shouted, hoping to drown the noise of the running water. As soon as he shouted, he heard a loud bang coming from the bathroom.
"Told him he should go drown himself."
Draco shook his head violently. "No, don't. I just want the drawings done."
Ron looked between the two of them with a confused look, but Harry just shrugged and slapped Draco on his leg under the table.
"True." Harry cried himself with a towel and dried Draco as well.
"I mean, apart from this.", said Malfoy and pointed with his finger between himself and Harry, "I mean with all the Tournament stuff and else."
Draco noticed that Potter was very well-formed. His arms were very muscular, Draco suspected from all the years of playing Quidditch. And through his shirt Draco could see that Potter was
"I understand?" Harry said nodding.
"Kiss me, the waitress won't stop looking at you.", Draco answered.
As though aware of Potter looks, Draco's cock twitched a little and began to thicken. Potter bit his lip and Draco noticed Potter and himself blushing even more. Potter didn't move, he licked his lips and stared at Draco's prick. He seemed paralysed.
"Seriously?", he asked and raised an eyebrow, "You're so slimy, Potter."
"Because you had a choice your whole life long. I had not.", Malfoy answered angrily.
Harry laughed. That was kind of true, considering all the crazy stuff that was going on in the wizarding world.
"How can this be
"We were." Harry said, "I don't know how it happened. It was just... I don't know."
"Mate, we really don't want to annoy you, but-", Ron said.
"I'm sorry," Harry repeated.
Harry nodded. He wanted to see the drawing room. Draco nodded and got up. They sneaked downstairs and now Harry was sure that everyone was asleep. The Manor looked very creepy in the dark light of the few torches in the giant hallways. The frightening portraits looked at Harry with such disgust in their faces, that he felt a shiver going down his spine. Draco put his hand on the bronze doorknob to the drawing room and stooped for a moment to look if Harry was sure about this. Harry nodded and Draco opened the door.
Weasley was half out the door again when Draco plucked up the courage to say something. "Weasley-"
Now there was no Potter who sat there and looked like he always did and distracted Draco.
"Shut up, Malfoy."
But Harry couldn't sleep. He was too excited about everything that had happened that day. They almost hadn't fought, they had kissed - twice - what made up for the fighting, Malfoy had cried, and now they cuddled. This was a big step for them, considering how they behaved around each other before the war. Harry yawned widely and carefully leaned his head against Malfoy's. Harry closed his eyes , took a deep breath and slowly dozed off.
Ron and Hermione bent over a piece of paper and looked up as Harry came inside.
"We will cover for you," Ron said, smiled and shoved Harry out of the room.
"Yes, Potter. I'm evil.", he said.
Draco stared at the sleeping boy in front of him. For a few seconds at least. Then Draco left.
Harry smiled, opened the door and let it close behind himself. He took a deep breath and went downstairs to leave the hospital.
"Yes. Elvis Presley.", Potter said and nodded.
"Ah, of course. Now everything seems logic to me.", Draco saod ironically.
"Something important." He said as he looked at Harry again, "Maybe something in a big fancy company."
"Hey. Just for one minute forget about your father," Harry said softly and he really hoped Malfoy could.
Without noticing the spy, Granger opened one of the books, but didn't even take a look on the page. The guy just started talking and she burst out giggling. "How come you are so funny?" She asked.
He backed off a little, but Hermione didn't brake her gaze.
"Outside.", Harry answered.
"I got her for my 11th birthday.", he said, "She was my best friend."
Nott nodded and didn't seem too brave now.
Malfoy had spent dinner in the kitchens again. After the meal, Harry said goodbye to his friends and walked back to his room, where Malfoy was already lying in his bed.
"I'm just worried about his mother. And what if being there makes me remember all that stuff and we fight?" Harry said, now starting to eat the eggs himself.
Ginny laughed and put her hand on his shoulder. "I love that you're happy."
They continued what they had done on the couch before they had been interrupted and the night couldn't be used better.
Weasley scoffed and it sounded awfully familiar.
today?" Harry asked.
Ron raised an eyebrow.
"Later." Ron said nodding.
"I do. I think it's for Hufflepuffs!", he said and smiled. Potter chuckled, pressing a kiss to his mouth.
"I don't care about this shitty
"Why is it strange, hm? Could you two please tell me what's going on inside you heads?", Harry asked annoyed.
"You are the man of my dreams.", Draco replied quietly. Potter smiled satisfied.
"Draco, darling. Good to see you.", Narcissa Malfoy said.
Harry sighed.
After a few silencing charms, he pulled down his pyjama bottoms and grabbed his dick. He started rubbing his hand up and down and his thoughts drifted off to Malfoy. Not how he was in the dream, but how he was in real life. An arse. But he was somehow... no! He was not cute! Frustrated, Harry came over himself, but didn't feel more satisfied than before. Great! Now the fist time he ever wanked was because of
They talked a lot until Harry changed the subject and said, "By the way, why so you look like a homeless person?"
"Well, I thought about this for a very long time  and I think it's for the best to leave him with the Weasley's. Molly and Arthur are used to having so many children and a little baby and Ginny was quite delighted when she found out she was going to have a little sibling, for she is the youngest of the Weasley's."
"What are you- shit, are you having a panic attack?"
"Who are you in love with?", she asked. Harry and Ron froze and stared at her.
"Or thi-"
"Uhm, I don't know if-"
"Draco, that's-"
"We're married." Draco said, "Potter. We're married!"
Harry was talking to some people that came over to him. They wanted to know how he felt and thank him for everything. Harry only smiled politely and hurried back to his friends as fast as he could. Hermione was still talking to Parkinson, who didn't make much of an effort to be nice to the rest of the group.
"A pullover?" Harry repeated, "Won't you sweat to death?" His room was heated so much that he could sleep in just shorts and a shirt.
"Is that a yes?", Harry asked with a nervous smile.
The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes, which Harry recognised, was Hermione. Then, Professor McGonnagal's voice called:
"What are you waiting for, you losers?", Draco asked annoyed and they left as well.
"Who are you trying to get out of the way, anyways?", Potter asked as they sat down at the table.
He left the Hall and felt Malfoy's eyes in his neck. Harry ignored the whispers of the girls that stood in the hallway and the giggle when he passed them. He named the password and climbed in. The Gryffindor common room was filled with only ten or twelve people. They all looked at him, as he walked up the stairs to the boy's dormitory. Of course, his dorm room was empty as he closed the door behind himself. Harry walked into the bathroom and locked the door. He undressed in front of the mirror and suddenly remembered his dream. Malfoy, pale, naked-
"Damn it!" Draco said to himself after he remembered he had thrown all the towels at Potter because he had told Draco to not be so dry. Draco couldn't believe it. He stood in the bathroom, naked and dripping and frustrated. "Unbelievable," Draco whispered and rolled his eyes. He didn't know what to do.
Draco, Draco would be dead within hours. This was horrible. Draco opened the paper again just before he entered the classroom. He sat down at his table and kept reading.
Potter sat up at once and grabbed his watch, that lay on Draco's bedside table.
"Boy, am I glad we have separate tents tonight!" Ron laughed.
one. But he didn't want to, ok? He had no choice. In the war, we all did wrong things! Even me! And don't think you attacking Draco now does justify what he was forced to do in the war!", Potter shouted,
Before Harry could answer to this, Seamus, Dean and Neville fell down next to Harry and Ron. Seamus dropped his notebook on the table and looked at Harry.
Draco was astounded. He flipped to the page where the article was and sat down in the armchair.
Harry looked at him, so did Hermione.
Back at the cash desk Lydia smiled at Harry and batted her eyelashes. Ron always told her stories about Harry, none of them mentioning wizards.
"Shut up, Malfoy!" Harry said loudly, "You're so insensitive and annoying! Why can't you just leave me alone? I've done so fucking much for you and your mother and your father and you never just once thanked me! All I want is for you to be nice to me! Just once in your life! You don't even have to like me, I just want you to treat me like a human being! It's so exhausting to make you be nice to me. Every day!"
Ron let out an outraged sound and raised his hands. "You may have forgotten who he is, but I haven't."
Malfoy nodded. They had three drinks as far as Harry could remember.
"Speaking about newspapers," Malfoy said, "I have to show you something else."
Harry rolled his eyes. He shoved his fists angrily over his ears and kept them there for a good five minutes. Even though he couldn’t hear anything, it was hard not to picture what was happening in the other bed, and to ignore his own cock stirring with interest at the thought that Harry could do the same if he wanted.
"Hey, um..." Harry said and Hermione and Ron turned around, "You go to McGonnagal, I need to get something from my room."
He grabbed the Prophet and opened it at a random page, avoiding Theo's look.
He sat on the desk in the Room of Requirement and stared down at the blank paper. He rotated his quill in his left hand and thought about what he could tell his friends.
Ron and Hermione answered with the same word and focused back on their bags. Harry furrowed his brow. What was going on here?
"I don't-" Draco cleared his throat.
Blaise nodded seemingly disappointed, turned away and listened to the teacher. Draco sighed again. He hated this day.
Draco's eyes shot open, but it was too late. In this very moment, the curtains were pulled back and the healer Madame Pomfrey stood there, a look of horror on her face.
"Well... he's my roommate.", Harry said.
"Oh," he said surprised, "didn't expect you."
"It's beautiful," Harry said and forced a smile.
Harry's thoughts drifted away to Draco. How he was.probably sitting on his bed all alone and thinking what he could do. Harry felt guilty that he let Draco alone. He got sad with every second he kept thinking this thought, so he brushed it away.
Harry chuckled. "Good. Tell her thanks from me. I'll be home as soon as I can."
"Is it comfortable?", Draco asked.
"Um... I dont know. We'll see.", he said finally and scratched the back of his head. Potter nodded.
"Maybe...", he said, "Maybe your dream will become true tonight..." Draco looked at him.
He leaned over the table and pressed his lips on Draco's. Draco's hands wandered into Potter's hair and they kissed over their breakfast plate.
"Jealous?", he asked jokingly.
They talked for a while until their food came floating through the restaurant and placed itself in front of them. And for a short moment there was silence as everyone ate their first bite. The silence left again and Ron told them a story about Seamus from back at Hogwarts - a story everyone remembered.
She didn't look up as she heard Hermione and Harry coming.
Harry did as he was told and unpacked his trunk. After doing so, he flinched and froze. Malfoy looked at him questioning.
Pansy tried to involve Draco in a conversation about school, but Draco never knew how to answer her.
Harry laughed as well.
"Oh, I absolutely can." Harry said grinning, "What's behind that door?" Harry pointed at a wooden door with a beautiful handle next to the small fireplace.
"Yes?"
"I meant to drink." He said loudly and realised that it must have been too loud, because she looked stunned and let go of him.
"Potter." Draco mumbled annoyed, "Yes."
"Don't care about your father. He'll be fine. Tell me.", his mother said.
He reminded himself that she couldn't know. She couldn't know. She couldn't know.
"Ron, aren't you going to say anything?" Hermione asked after Ron hadn't said anything for minutes.
"Hey Ron," Malfoy said quietly, "Ronnie"
came from? Your family is just the same as Potter's was!", Petunia said.
Harry was taken aback. This was such a random question.
"You know what? I hate you. I hate you for everything you have done to this wonderful boy! Harry Potter is amazing! You may don't see it, but I do. His friends do. His teachers did. And I'm proud of him. His friends are. His teachers are. Even the wizards and witches who don't like him thank him their lifes! You may don't know, but Harry here saved the Wizarding World! But not only because of this, he is my hero, no. He's my hero because now I know with what people he had to grow up and I have a lot of respect for this. I would've killed myself rather than living with you people for fifteen years! I just know you for a good hour, but I already hate you more than anything in the galaxy! You are horrible, awful, nasty people, you are! How can you live with yourselves?"
Potter smiled and kissed Draco's chest.
Harry chuckled.
Draco nodded wordlessly. The waitress brought his whisky and Potter ordered another beer. Draco realized that it wasn't as hard to talk to Potter as he'd thought it would be. Maybe it was the alcohol. But as hard as it was to admit, it could be that Potter was just far more understanding and sympathetic than Draco had imagined him to be.
"So, what do you say?", Harry asked.
Harry definitely hadn't been prepared for this one. Malfoy put his hands on Harry's butt and pulled him closer again so that Harry could feel Malfoy's groin pressing against him and he was pretty sure Malfoy could feel his. Harry rolled his closed eyes inside their sockets and he tried not to moan himself, what was pretty hard considering how hard Malfoy made him. MALFOY! This was so weird.
"You kept it this long from me? Are you crazy? This is something huge!" Ron said angrily and stood up.
. I understand that you don't want to keep a secret from them, but I wish we could give it a bit more time. Just a tiny little bit more."
"Well maybe he wants to starve himself to death," Dean grinned.
"Why did you take Dreamless Sleep?", Potter asked after they lay there for a long time, not talking. Draco looked at him. He didn't think he was ready to tell Potter this.
He and Potter had talked about the Half-Blood Prince before one night and Potter had also told him about the spells in the book.
"It did?"
"Hermione, this may be the last time Ron and I will be here, let us have some fun."
"Oh my God, Malfoy!" Neville said and grabbed Malfoy's shoulders before he would fall.
Harry rolled his eyes and put on his pyjama. "I'm not going to sleep in my trousers and you don't have to either. I've seen you in your boxershorts, remember?"
"What the hell was that?" Draco asked.
"Right. So let's play a little with them." Draco said and the rest agreed.
"Potty, what the devil are you doing?", Draco asked, but still smiled.
"May we eat?", Harry asked and pointed at the meal.
"I love you, Harry Potter.", Draco whispered in Harry's ear.
"That were only two reasons."
"Hermione, I think love is everything but logic. You've punched him in the face. He will probably never forgive you that, but I think he doesn't mind talking to you. He's not a child, nor are you and you know it as well as I do. Ron was always the one who hated him more than you and we had to convince you about our thoughts about him. Now it's the other way round. And I bet ten Galleons that he had to drag you here because you didn't want to see Draco. Am I correct?"
"Why don't you just shut up, Malfoy?", Harry gritted out. Malfoy laughed.
"Pull yourself together." He said to himself.
Harry folded the paper again. Malfoy looked up and had an uncertain look on his face. Harry nodded smiling. Malfoy smiled too.
"You... she leaned in and you laughed and you were happy without me!" Draco sounded angry, but Harry was sure he was sad also.
When Potter had left, Draco was held up by Granger and Weasley who wouldn't let Draco follow Potter. "He wants to get away from you," they had said, "And so does everyone else."
"Ron, it's the same with Dean and Seamus, isn't it?", Hermione said, trying to cool his temper.
Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed Potter's hand. "Stop it." He said firmly.
"I'm not good enough for her, Harry," Ron said as Harry and he sat back down in front of the fireplace after dinner.
Harry knew when Malfoy used the word "Weasel", then a civilised conversation was impossible.
"I can walk from here. It's not far." Harry said nodding and smiled reassuringly.
"Since when have you done this?" Harry asked.
"So...", Draco started.
Dinner was really uninteresting. Blaise and Draco haven't been talking much. Draco didn't care what Blaise did with his new bestie and Blaise knew Draco didn't want to talk about his day - Draco never did. So after Draco had eaten, he got up and left his old friend behind in the Hall. He made his way back to the empty eighth year common room and sat down at the fire. Draco stared into the fire and wished he could just leave. The year wasn't going as Draco had wanted it to go. The door was being opened and Draco heard laughter.
Harry chuckled. Ron got up and looked at Harry with a big smile. Harry flushed. He was ready. Hermione came dashing through the doors, her beautiful violet dress flowing behind her.
"Only if it was before or after the ball.", Dean added.
Harry sighed. He wasn't sure if he could put up with this - being reminded of Voldemort and having all those flashbacks. Harry wondered if maybe Malfoy was feeling the same, after all he'd had Voldemort living in his house for months. But still, sharing a house is not nearly as frightening as sharing a mind.
"He actually did." Harry said and laughed at Ron's surprised face.
"Right. Look, Malcolm," Harry bent slightly forward and smiled, "if they're not accepting your innocence then they're not fit for you, then they're not worth it. I know people who forgave people that did way worse things than just
Harry thrust his fingers though Draco's hair and rested them there, Draco lay his hand on Harry's arse. They stood there in the middle of the deserted corridor and kissed, groping ass and hair.
"Yes, minister. I know certain Mr Malfoy." Potter answered.
Harry and Ron laughed. They joined the rest of the staff and went into the Great Hall. This year, since McGonagall was headmistress now, it was Professor Rubeus Hagrid who was Head of Gryffindor, Professor Slughorn was pronounced Head of Slytherin after Snape's death. The Headmistress sat down in the middle of the long table and Harry was told to sit next to her, Ron next to him. Harry felt weird but honoured to sit at the staff table, facing the pupils. He and Ron couldn't stop grinning as the doors to the Great Hall opened and the students came inside, a lot of whom gasped when they saw Harry and Ron. The ghosts of Hogwarts flew through the Hall and Sir Nicholas -
He bent down to wash his face with cold water and when he got back up, Harry looked at himself in the mirror. His reflection looked horrible - he had dark circles under his eyes and a stubbly beard. The whole last night he had been tossing and turning, haunted by the dream he'd had about Voldemort. Harry took off his shirt and threw it in the self-emptying bin. Shirtless, he walked to his room and put on a fresh one. Harry closed his window that he'd opened after he woke up, because the weather was starting to change and grey clouds covered the blue sky. Harry sighed.
"So how was your summer?" Draco asked even though he didn't really care.
Draco smiled. Harry gently lay his lips onto Draco's and smiled. Draco placed his hands on the sides of Harry's face and pulled him closer. Draco forced his tongue inside Harry's mouth and explored every single corner. Harry felt like he was going to cry of joy. But he wouldn't, because he wasn't a loser. Harry let his hands slide down Draco's back and groped his ass, what made Draco moan with pleasure. Harry was quite self satisfied. Draco's trembling hands found the collar of Harry's shirt and he tucked at it, signalling Harry he should get rid of the shirt. Unwanted to let go, Harry partened their lips and pulled his shirt over his head, Draco did the same thing. As soon as they were shirtless, they stuck to each other again, hands everywhere and Harry started sweating.
"I had a dream last night." He said.
The lessons flew by and Draco made his way back to the kitchens to have dinner. He sighed and stepped in.
"Merlin! You don't need to put on shirts, cover your bulges for Heaven's Sake !"
"Good morning." Hermione called and the three waved.
Draco tried to sit up in his bed and Harry helped him. Watching Draco struggle like this was so painful for Harry to look at.
Harry nodded, shielded from Malfoy by the dark. Draco didn't know how hard it was for Harry to talk about this.
Harry did the same and closed his eyes smiling. How did he get so lucky to be with Malfoy?
Draco laughed into his shirt and kissed him on his forehead. Draco knew
"So, Harry, how was the talk with McGonnagal?" Neville asked when he saw how bored Harry was.
Draco opened his eyes and shot up. Hospital! Potter! "Coming!" Draco shouted back.
"Rescue.", he answered, not looking at Potter, who laughed too.
"That table looks good.", he said and pointed on a table with red legs.
are being weird." Draco said, "They don't even know what they're talking about. Wizards are so much more powerful than Muggles."
"Wow", Potter laughed, "that's meaningful."
Though, a proper escape probably shouldn't have included nibbling on Potter's bottom lip.
"Oh.", said Harry.
So Harry told them everything. How he had ran into Malfoy at the pub and how they had been at the diner and Harry's leather jacket, how they met each other again at the diner and what they'd talked about and how Malfoy came over earlier and how they had argued.
"You have to let go at some point, you know that?"
The day, though lazy as it was, rushed past the three friends like a lighting. In the evening, they watched TV for a long time, and were flicking through the channels. As Hermione fell asleep, Harry suggested they should all go to bed and Ron agreed. He woke Hermione softly and wished Harry a good night. Harry smiled and slumped upstairs tiredly.
In that moment, the bells outside were beating midnight.
"What?" Hermione asked from the kitchen, "Malfoy, you're really missing out on something!"
Draco glared at him.
interest in her. And Draco had always thought some of his Quidditch teammates were quite alright to look at. Now it all made sense: the details Draco had noticed about Potter, Potter's muscles, the fact that Potter's smile made him weak in the knees, the feeling he'd had when they had kissed... Draco felt dizzy and couldn't get his fingers to move anymore, his gaze fixed on them resting on the keyboard.
someone.
"Madame, the rest of us is going to take care of Harry as well, I think it would be good if we all knew what we could do."
Harry nodded wordlessly. This was neither the time nor the place to discuss this, so he decided not to say anything at all. Malfoy nodded too, but still looked suspicious. Harry tried not to think about anything until they touched the ground again. He didn't say a word as they walked back to the terrace, where Narcissa didn't sit anymore. He also didn't say a word as they walked upstairs or as Draco showed him where the bathroom was, so he could take a shower. In the shower, Harry wondered if he should tell Draco about his thoughts and his dreams.
They sat on Potter's bed and laughed and talked. Potter sat on the windowsill and looked up as Draco opened the door. Draco looked at the others and rolled his eyes. To his surprise, Potter understood at once.
He couldn't say it. He couldn't say it. He couldn't say it. He had to say it. But he couldn't say it.
"What?", Potter breathed, squirming in Draco's embrace. Draco slid his hand lower and grabbed the waistband of Potter's pyjamas, none too gently.
"I have.", Draco nodded and levitated the bags downstairs.
"It is clearly not!", Ron said and stood up, "It's
"You will see him soon again." Andromeda said to him even though he couldn't understand what she was saying.
And there was this question again. So annoying!
"Draco, it tastes good. Believe me.", he said smiling.
Again, it was quiet. Harry thought Draco was already sleeping, but then, his calm voice broke the silence:
"How do these thing for into this little box?", Draco asked curiously and the man smiled again.
Potter held his hands up defensively and Draco put away his wand.
"Easy. Vanilla."
Draco's body jerked forward, his cock twitching at the sight of Potter offering his neck for Draco to mark. Heat rushed to his cheeks as Potter gasped, undoubtedly noticing Draco's arousal. He hadn't moved and Draco relaxed.
"You look bored," Malfoy answered, grabbed Harry's wrist and pulled him to his feet. Ron and Hermione were looking at them with wide eyes.
"Your hair looks nice, Draco.", he said. Draco turned around and faced Harry. Their noses almost touched.
Potter smiled lightly. "I hated them."
"Harry Potter attends the Triwizard Tournament even though the ministry set up a new rule. The boy had always been up for stupid and forbidden things, but this is the cherry on top. I had him and the other champions in a little interview, what can be read on page 13."
"I can't believe they were actually nice about stuff for once." Ron said.
He had been in the library and in the Great Hall, hoping to find Hermione or Ron, ideally both of them. But he searched in vain. There was no sight of Ron or Hermione, not even Neville, Dean or Seamus. Only a few younger students, so Harry made his way back to his room.
"Thank you, Professor.", he said and couldn't hold his happiness back.
"Yes, Potter. I did."
A middle aged witch in a green robe walked up to Harry, clipboard clutched to her chest. "Are you waiting for someone?" She asked.
"What?", Malfoy asked.
Malfoy tried to get up, but fell right back into the cushions. "Follow me," he said and slowly slid out of the pillows.
"Wow, you have a piano?!" It was less a question than an observation.
Harry nodded.
"No. No, no. It's... really stupid.", Harry answered, shaking his head.
"Stop looking at me like this," Draco said and shook his head. Potter just smiled even more and started laughing. It was really catchy, so Draco smiled as well. Potter stopped and pointed at Draco with a surprised expression.
What was happening here? Harry shook his head confused and made his way to Slughorn's personal store, where he took a few ingredients for the potion unnoticed and then he walked up to the classroom on the fifth floor, which hasn't been used since a long time.
"You want to go?", he asked.
So Harry left the dorm and followed his friends downstairs to McGonnagal's classroom. Before class started, Harry walked up to her desk.
When Potter stood there, Draco kneeling in front of him, Draco was suddenly very aware of the cold. He felt his fingers freezing and just wished for an answer - preferably one that would make him happy. But Potter didn't move. Draco threw a look at the people behind Potter and saw that some of them shrugged, others smiled hopefully and kept taking pictures. And then, finally, Potter nodded. Draco felt his heart jump. Potter was nodding!
He was stressed enough and now this asshole was showing up and provoking Harry.
"But still," Draco was getting louder as well, "I still want to know where you are."
Harry sat down on his bed.
The owl flew away quickly and Draco hoped his mother was about to come because he needed to talk to someone.
"You really want to talk to him, don't you?"
"Open your mouth." Harry said, stressing every single syllable.
"Does anyone fancy another cup of tea?", Draco asked and the three others nodded. Draco kissed Harry on his forehead amd stood up to make some more tea. Harry smiled.
Outside, Harry found that as hot as the days were the nights were cold, and he was glad he'd brought a jacked with him. Just as he wanted to mount his broom, his eyes fell on someone leaning against the wall of the pub and what seemed to be smoking a cigarette.
"Alright then." Weasley repeated and looked just as uncomfortable, "Do you want to have some pie?"
Harry smiled at Ron gratefully and Ron nodded back. Hermione gave Ron a kiss on the cheek and whispered something in his ear - Harry suspected that she thanked him. Malfoy's grip loosened and Harry tried to let go of his hand, but Malfoy gripped it tighter again. Harry chuckled.
Harry grinned. Seamus - an openly gay man - danced with Goyle (who slimmed down a lot). Harry pulled Draco closer again and they kept dancing.
Malfoy didn't answer and shook his head. Harry saw Malfoy looking at him for a second, but before Harry could look back, Malfoy's glance was back at Ron.
No one talked until they had finished eating and Hermione told Harry he should lie down and get some sleep. Harry figured he could at least give it a try, stripped down to his boxers and curled up beneath the blanket in his bed. The room was chilly and the air felt clean inside Harry's lungs. He closed his eyes and his breath slowed down.
"No, I mean I
"Merlin, you're really warm.", he said. Harry didn't know what to say and then-
Harry knew what he ment and took a step closer to him, so their lips nearly touched. Draco moved his head forwards, but Harry pulled his back, so that the distance between their lips was still the same.
. Also, as far as Harry remembered, Malfoy was the reason Harry was even in here. But Harry didn't want to get angry right now, he figured it would be a good time to tell Ron about Malfoy, now that they were alone and probably won't be long if Hermione was going to get everyone else.
was allowed to hurt Harry in any way, and what Malfoy did was the least of the least. It was just disgusting and disrespectful and-
"No.", Hermione said standing up, and, to Harry's surprise Ron stood up as well.
"You do? Why? Because you share a room with him?", she asked and Harry shook his head.
"Malfoy-"
"You can do it. I know it.", Harry said.
Draco's day mostly consisted of sleeping and trying to get rid of this bloody headache.
"D'you - d'you want to go to the ball with me?", said Harry.
"And he's my boyfriend so quiet yourself!", Harry said and stood up.
"Stop talking about me having children!", Draco said, firing up at once.
Harry grinned and pulled a small piece of paper out of his jeans and typed in the number. Malfoy looked at him questioning.
Harry carefully opened his eyes and found that he was facing the cushions on the sofa. He listened to Ron and Hermione without moving.
Hearing Malfoy take a deep, shuddering breath, Harry grinned even more. "Harry."
Horrible. Just horrible. A lot of people that walked past Draco looked at him funny when they saw him reading the article about himself. He felt like he could sink into the ground. Horrible, that was all he could think of. Why did this stupid little pathetic excuse of a journalist think this was important to be mentioned?
Now Ron's eyes wandered to Malfoy as well. "Don't you have
"I'm going to put on something more comfortable, then I'm joining you." Harry told Ron and Hermione and left Teddy with them.
"Well of course we have planned something for you" Ron said while cutting his sausage, "Because it's going to be your first peaceful birthday since for ever."
Harry thought for a minute. "Probably Bangers and Mash."
"What's going on here?", Harry laughed.
Malfoy nodded. Harry grinned and went back inside the bathroom and got fully dressed and did his hair as neatly as it could get.
Harry nodded. He didn't know what to say. Malfoy had never - not once - said a nice word about Harry's parents. All he had done was insult them and Harry couldn't bear to hear it one more time.
Harry could see that Ron was startled. He raised his eyebrows and somehow looked very angry. "You're right. I
Harry waited hidden around the corner. When Malfoy walked past him, oblivious, Harry sneaked back into their room. He still couldn't explain what was going on with Malfoy but he believed the answer lied in that box. Harry had recognized the box immediately from their first day at Hogwarts when Malfoy had acted really strange when Harry had asked about it.
Draco and Weasley helped Potter get up, what seemed like it hurt him very much. Draco felt really bad for him and wished he could take the pain himself.
"I only had eyes for you and how hot you looked surrounded by the the smoke coming out of the others cauldrons and how your unbearable green eyes shone in the damp light." Potter smiled.
"So. Where were we?" Malfoy asked.
In fact, Malfoy
"Here, Granger. Weasel.", Draco said and placed the cups of tea in front of them.
"Whisky. Neat." Malfoy said.
"I've just taken your Muggle-virginity.", Harry said laughing and Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Harry nodded back smiling.
"Three weeks notice? Well he's looking forward to it." Ron said and grinned.
"Yeah. Would you please tell me your point of view? Please?" Harry asked politely.
Harry sighed and started singing "Love me tender". Draco smiled and Harry's cheeks felt hot. As he finished, Draco held his arm up.
So they did. They put on their school robes and Draco loved to feel it on his skin again. From there, it didn't took so long until they had reached Hogwarts.
... poor Ron.
Ron and Hermione were amazing enough to have planned the whole day for Harry. After breakfast they played a few games of Wizards Chess - Harry won twice but he thought they just let him win. Afterwards - around noon - they disapparated to a restaurant on Diagon Alley where Neville and Luna were already waiting. To Harry's relief the restaurant was almost empty and Neville and Ron said they would make sure no one would bother Harry. The five of them sat down on a big round table. A nice witch came to take their orders.
Harry nodded smiling. Even though he was still worried about Malfoy, Harry decided to concentrate on his birthday.
"Fuck off, Potter." Draco said and turned around, ready to leave.
He was right, Harry couldn't go to bed without having eaten something first. Harry nodded slowly and sat back down.
As Harry finished, Draco stood in front of the mirror, a towel wrapped around his waist and he combed his hair. Harry grinned. He pulled his arms around Draco and kissed his neck.
"Miss Malfoy, your meat is
"So first week of October?" Andromeda asked.
"Okay, I'll take the tea." Ron answered.
Hermione and Ron nodded and Harry split from the group. Somewhere in the bookstore had to be a place where it was a little cool. Maybe an open window or something. But then Harry remembered that Hermione always said bookstores don't have windows, so the color of the books won't fade.
While Harry stood in the bathroom and got dressed, Malfoy said, "You can tell your friends."
. Harry had to repeat it in his head again and again. These were the best days of his life and he didn't want to ruin it with being suspicious. But keeping it a secret wouldn't help.
"He's an asshole, and if he really thinks he is
"Ron and Hermione are coming soon. Draco, would you please stop testing how stable this table is? Thank you.", Harry said and rolled his eyes.
Potter smiled and showed Draco the last few rooms. The last one was his bureau and dressing room. Draco stood there astonished.
"Whoa, Malfoy. If you don't want to drink it then don't.", he said, but Malfoy shook his head. Harry's eyes rushed over the other boy's face and he relaxed a bit.
"So what?" Harry asked loudly.
Harry searched the right words for it. Yes! Of course he wanted to go over there! But he was so... Harry didn't even knew himself what he was. He was shy and stupid and he didn't know how and... He was so
"I'm his daddy and I'm going to save him!", Potter said. The girls stared at him.
They had to know what had happened. So he played the video.
"No, you love me. And I love you.", Harry smirked and grabbed the comb from the sink.
Harry remembered the dreams he had had about Voldemort when he had still been alive, not knowing it had been actually happening. Harry sipped at his hot chocolate and wiped his face with the back of his hand. He still couldn't believe what had happened. They really got into a fight - and a bad one, one might add.
With Malfoy's intimidating stare, Harry wasn't sure what he was doing. "You've slept the whole day, I thought maybe you would like to eat something or you'll starve." Harry told him.
"I want to see if the old books are here again." She explained when Ron asked why she wanted to go there when school hadn't already started.
"Both." Harry shrugged with a wide grin.
The greeting from the cashier, Lydia, pulled Harry out of his thoughts. He smiled at her and wished her a good morning as well. Since Harry came here almost every two days, he already knew the people that worked in the store and the other regular customers.
"Man, you look awful.", Ron said as Harry took a slice of bread. He nodded.
The pressure against his crotch intensified, his skin burning wherever it touched Potter's. Draco found himself mesmerised by Potter's face that was hovering a few inches above his.
When Harry woke up, it was very early and Draco was still in bed with him, their legs entangled, Draco's face soft and relaxed. His jaw was mottled with pink.
am getting a tattoo." Draco answered half to Theo, half to the pierced woman behind the counter.
"Go," Hermione said to Harry, her voice protective, "Leave!"
Harry smiled, he really appreciated his friends trying to cheer him up, but he didn't doubt that the subject of Malfoy would come up again. They had decided they were going to fly to The Burrow after breakfast, Hermione would take the Floo Network there because she liked flying as little as she liked missing to hand in her paper in time. Harry was looking forward to seeing the Weasley's again.
what I am going to tell you now," Harry said and Neville promised. So Harry told him what had happened next.
"Can you believe some strange people are going to live in our dorm?" Ron asked Harry.
Theo pointed at three dancing girls in tight trousers and shot Draco a questioning look. Draco shrugged and was pulled towards them.
Draco walked down the stairs as Granger and Weasel walked upstairs hand in hand.
"Don't worry, you can keep your shoes on." Nott said.
"What the fuck?", he asked and looked at the floor.
Molly was going to drop off Teddy later that day, so Harry needed to clean the house a bit. He decided to start with himself and stepped in the shower. He hurried scrubbing himself and stepped out again only minutes later. While Harry was at it, he grabbed the dirty towels laying around in the bathroom and brought them to the laundry room Harry had added when the house fell in his hands.
"He did. He told me to say it exactly like this. I don't know what it's supposed to mean, but I delivered it and that's what he wanted me to."
"What do you want, Malfoy?", he asked annoyed, his eyes still closed.
But when he came back to his room after dinner, he knew. His heart skipped a beat as he saw Draco sitting on his bed, his hair geled back and his eyes hushing over the page of a book.
"I think so, yes.", answered Draco.
"See you tomorrow.", he said.
"And, Potter, how do you think you're going to sleep tonight?", Pansy asked mockingly.
"And how good is he at a hand-job on a scale from one to ten?", Seamus asked. Harry looked at him nonplussed.
"Do I look like I'm ready?", he asked and tugged at his pyjama. Potter laughed.
"Don't be so sure."
"Pansy wrote me.", Draco answered, "And I have to take a shower. You?"
Draco rolled his eyes. "You just don't want me to walk around, you?"
"No, it wasn't, I just know you couldn't have been talking about fighting each other."
Malfoy smiled, shook his head and closed his eyes again.
Draco was scared. Not for himself, for Potter. Draco feared that Potter would risk his life this year again. Just like every other year before. Even though Voldemort was gone now and most of the Deatheaters were locked up, Draco just had a feeling that this year wasn't going to be an easy one for Potter. Draco somehow felt in his heart that something was going to worry Potter and that something wasn't going to be alright. Draco would have loved to know what was going to worry Potter and he would have loved to help him, but there was one problem - they were supposed to hate each other. Draco couldn't just go up to his "arch enemy" and ask him if everything is alright. And Potter wouldn't answer him. He wouldn't just blurt out his personal problems and tell Draco about his life, because Potter hated Draco and Draco kind of hated Potter.
"Well you should!" Harry said.
Potter and Potter
"It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that," Dumbledore said, "So, Harry-"
"Don't be. They just show how I survived," Potter said seriously, pointing at the scar on his forehead.
Theo didn't answer. He grabbed a book and sat down on the small balcony. Draco followed him, hoping he would say something.
"Totally, yes.", he said. Harry smiled.
Malfoy shook his head. "I don't."
Harry rolled his eyes. They couldn't leave him alone, could they? He didn't want to tell them about meeting Malfoy because after all Harry didn't know if Malfoy wanted them to know.
Harry smiled and Draco pulled him closer.
Harry watched Draco with curiosity, but he seemed more relaxed than Harry felt, though his hand was gripping the silver head of the snake tightly. Harry was sure of this, but he couldn't hold back his excitement. Neither did Hagrid, because after McGonagall's first sentence, he started weeping.
Harry nodded and didn't even bother to argue. Malfoy should get home to his friends and Harry should have a talk with Ron. Malfoy nodded too, like he wanted to convince himself. He then put on his shoes and Harry wordlessly handed him his broom. Malfoy forced a smile.
"Now that's more like it!" Ron laughed.
Ginny entered the common room and sat down on the armchair next to Hermione. Crookshanks jumped from Hermione next to Ginny and Ginny smiled. Hermione turned away from Harry and talked to Ginny.
Drago rolled his eyes.
"I don't get how you could drink tea right now." Draco said, "Tea!"
"Careful, Malfoy. You're in a room full of people who hate you.", he said and Harry would have loved to hex him.
"Not much," Draco said and wanted to end the conversation with this, but then he thought that maybe it wouldn't hurt to talk a bit. "I've been studying a lot lately, haven't done much else," Draco added. He wanted to tell Blaise more, but he didn't want the others to know more. They sat there, staring curiously at Draco.
"Because you actually think that I will let you get into something more comfortable," Potter answered grinning.
She had a grin on her face and Harry furrowed his brow.
"Never seen a naked boy before?", Malfoy asked and his grin widened.
"When asked what Malfoy was doing there, Potter got furious and defensive and said, Malfoy was helping him just like everyone else was. We can assure, our interviewer had no intention whatsoever of disgracing Potter. Even more surprising was the statement Malfoy gave, when the interviewer said no other Slytherin was present. He said it was dishonorable of them not to come and he would have to get Potter to bed. To bed! Now that's something we might have to talk about more. We will try to reach out to either Potter or Malfoy and if everything goes smoothly, we will have at least one of them explain the situation."
After a while, Ron joined the two friends.
of a problem with it.
"Kyle, peave it." Someone said, but the guy - Kyle - didn't listen to them.
"And everyone was here to see you. Luna, Neville, Dean, Hermione and me of course. And a lot of students from other years, but Madame Pomfrey sent them out after a few minutes because she thought they were disturbing you and you needed to rest," Ron told Harry with a grin.
Harry was really happy for them, but he couldn't fight the feeling of jealousy. There were so many things Harry knew he couldn't do with Malfoy, because Malfoy was raised differently, he had a completely different view on the world and Harry didn't know if he could change that.
"What?", he asked confused.
"I'm sorry, Narcissa Malfoy?" Harry asked again.
been there. "And if Harry chooses to trust you, we trust you too." Granger said and smiled, Draco smiled too.
"Shut up and mind your own business," Draco snarled.
," Malfoy snapped and pulled Harry with him.
"Shht.", Potter said and lay a finger on Draco's lips and smiled.
"Draco, that-"
"You didn't fight him in the middle of the store, did you?" Ron asked.
"I should probably go." He said.
Harry felt really great. His stomach turned upside down and his heart fluttered. Everything was so surreal Harry had to lay back and close his eyes, expecting everything to vanish. But when he opened his eyes again, he saw Malfoy smiling at him and Harry smiled back.
"What's your name?" Harry asked friendly.
"I want you to move in with me.", Potter said smiling. Draco smiled surprised.
"He's not.", Ron said and it was so perfect, Harry's hands began to sweat.
Poppy guided Minerva to a curtain and held a finger in front of her mouth. "Shh," Pomfrey wishpered and pulled the curtain back.
Several women were in the store, some were employees and some were shopping. A very beautiful Asian employee came towards them, swinging her long black hair. Her smile made Ron blush.
"It vanished!",
"Stop laughing you arse!" Malfoy said.
"They're bothering me. Not the small ones, like the third years, but the older ones."
"Glad we talked about it." He said and took a sip of his wine, "Nice party."
"Good idea. Very good idea," Neville approved.
He knew Draco didn't want anyone to know because
"Um, we wanted to go to lunch. Are you coming?", Ron asked Harry.
"Why not?"
"What is this?", Draco asked, bent over and kissed Potter on his cheek.
"Really good. I'm actually thinking about inviting her to spend Christmas with me and my grandmother," Neville told him proudly.
Harry swallowed and nodded. "I am sure. I want to help those who don't dare to talk to anyone else, and I'm afraid the Slytherins won't have it very easy this year."
"Yeah, they may hate you a little, but I swear to Merlin, they would pull themselves together for me."
And so Draco explained everything.
"Strange.", Ron ended Hermione's sentence. She nodded.
The others looked at him and then at each other and continued eating, so did Harry. Every now and then, he looked up at Malfoy, who was now eating and talking to Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy turned his head and looked at Harry. His cheeks got at least as red as Harry's were and Malfoy looked away again. Harry stabbed his meat with his fork aggressively. Hermione opened her mouth to say something, but he shot her a hard look and she closed her mouth again.
"Sorry.", Seamus replied and held his hands up defensively.
They hurried down to greenhouse two, where the whole class was still waiting outside. Harry breathed out relieved and the three of them joined Neville, Seamus amd Dean.
When they arrived at Hogwarts, they were happy to see Hagrid back in his usual position when he gathered the first-years to sail with them across the Black Lake to the castle. They couldn't talk to him properly, but Hagrid promised they would meet later. Normally, people assumed the carriages pulled themselves up to the castle, but this year a large portion of the students knew better - they were being pulled by the spooky-looking Thestrals. There were only a few Hogwarts students that have been able to see these creatures before the war because only they have seen people die, but now after the war there were, naturally, a lot more.
"No, no, no." Malfoy stepped back with a weird look on his face.
Hermione raised her eyebrows because she was shocked that Malfoy wanted to
Every single one contained at least one article about Harry. "This is like my life as titles, stuffed in a box," Harry said.
Malfoy laughed, but seemed as nervous as Harry was.
"I said he should go out.", Nott repeated.
A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room. Parkinson was clutching Blaise Zabini's arm. Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner. But Draco was no where to be seen. He wasn't too cowardly, was he?
"See you.", Harry said and watched Draco walking down the corridor. He turned around and smiled at Harry, before he rounded a corner and vanished out of sight.
"Can I talk to you for a second?", Harry asked and dragged Draco away from their friends, who immediately started insulting each other.
"Morning."
The next morning, Harry waited until Draco was awake and they went downstairs together to get breakfast. Malfoy seemed to get along with everyone and Harry had completely forgotten about the thing he had heard the night before. They went home after breakfast, but they would see Ginny, Angelina and George that evening at the Christmas ball.
Now, everyone looked after them as they left the shop and shortly before the door closed, violent whisper started. Potter hugged him tightly.
"No chance. You were the one who came in.", he said, "Now, I would like to dress. If you have no problem with it, I would like you to leave, or you can stay and stare."
He threw himself on Harry and kissed him harshly. Harry moaned surprised and kicked Draco's lip, begging desperately for entrance. Draco parted his lips and their tongues danced a wild dance. Harry pulled his fingers in Draco's hair. It was so soft and so perfect.
"The Sorting Hat thought of putting me into Slytherin.", Harry said.
"He is not. Draco is your son! I don't want him to leave again."
"Someone I met yesterday." Harry said.
"Merlin.", Draco drew a shuddering breath.
"DO YOU THINK I CARE?", his father shouted back.
"You and... and
"Come on, Draco." Harry begged.
"Sorry?", said Cho.
Malfoy nodded and sat down on the kitchen counter.
"And I wanted you to come with me."
"And then we kissed." Harry said.
"Nothing. It's just that you and Harry will be there and everyone will celebrate you while I am amidst the students wearing my Gryffindor robes being unnoticeable."
As Ron and Harry came back from a round of flying at noon the next day, Hermione was in the garden looking after her plants. After the hard rain a few days ago, the clouds have vanished again and the sun came back out, shining brightly down at them. Harry wiped the sweat off his face and Ron bent down to give Hermione a kiss.
"Sorry," Potter said, taking his hand away.
Out of habit, he wanted to put Hedwig's cage on the trolley as well, but he remembered that it had been empty for almost one year. The cage stood on the window pane in the living room and Harry looked at it and smiled every now and then. He had loved Hedwig so much.
Since his friends weren't here anymore and since everyone hated him, Draco liked it to sit alone. He didn't really love it, but it was still better than sitting with some idiot. Speaking of idiot, Potter entered the classroom, his eyes hushed in Draco's direction and he sat down next to his stupid two friends.
"Oh come on don't be a prick now," Potter said and rolled his eyes.
Hermione nodded. Harry really appreciated that she took time for him and smiled.
"It's alright."
At night, Harry woke up from a dream he couldn't remember and shivered. He looked around his room, which was lit by the low moonlight coming through the window. Bond was sleeping in his cage and Harry sighed. Sometimes the feeling of missing Hedwig came over him and then he was reminded of missing everyone else. Harry felt a lump in his throat and rolled his eyes annoyed. He didn't want to cry, it seemed so ridiculous to sit alone in the dark and cry.
Good that Potter was left-handed and Draco right-handed, so they could hold hands while they were eating and no one noticed.
Hermione nodded and Harry saw she was finally at peace. He could understand that Hermione was worried, but she needed to have faith in him. Hermione briefly put her hand on Harry's and then got up. He watched her take the plates from breakfast inside. Harry sighed and thought about what was going to happen when Malfoy would come. He sat in the sun for a little while longer and then got up too. Hermione was in the kitchen, waving her wand and cleaning the dishes. Harry walked past her and into his room where his new owl greeted him with a soft hoot.
Harry nodded.
Potter joined Draco and his mother. "Mrs Malfoy, can I just say you are the most beautiful woman on this party."
And the story began with this song, and the story ended with this song. Harry never felt more comfortable than in Draco's arms while they were dancing. And so, Harry had the happiest birthday ever.
"I also want to have children. I already have a godson who I take care of most of the time and I love him so much. But I would really love to have one with shining silver hair and dangerously pale skin. I would really love to have a child that is the spitting image of you," Potter said and Draco could see in his green eyes that he really hoped for Draco not to freak out.
"Goodbye Malfoy." Harry answered and smiled.
"Why?"
It did. Not three minutes later Hermione knocked.
Draco stood up in rage. "A
"Of course. Maybe Harry will watch too, he really likes
It was a hot day in July and even though Harry wore only a T-shirt and shorts he immediately started sweating. He pulled out his sunglasses and exchanged them with the glasses already on his nose.
That went well. Depends on how you define well. At first, Harry got a bit aggressive, he had to admit, but then Malfoy opened.
Harry nodded silently. He got up and walked to the door. Before he left, Harry turned around and smiled. Malfoy sat on his bed, his legs crossed, and smiled too. Harry closed the door behind himself, leaned against it and breathed out. He was so excited but at the same time sad he couldn't tell anyone about it.
"Me?", he asked finally.
Harry and Hermione both looked at Ron. "He wouldn't." They said simultaneously.
"Please, come down here.", Potter said.
"In seventh. I was at another school before, but my parents wanted me to transfer here," the boy answered.
The whole day they sat and talked and played. Teddy was even allowed to sit on Draco's lap because he said it didn't hurt him at all. Harry wasn't sure if he was lying just because he wanted Teddy to sit there or if it was the truth, but he accepted it happily.
"And that's Remus. Lupin."
Alright. The day started good and the signs that Harry and Malfoy got along better, got worse with every day. To be honest, yesterday was a pretty good day. Harry walked downstairs in the Great Hall.
He smelled at it and got goosebumps. Ew. He swallowed the whole potion at once, shivered disgusted and Ron laughed.
Harry heard Hermione let out a relieved sigh and explained everything to Ron, then said to Harry that he should call when or if he's coming home
Harry turned on his heel and stepped into his bathroom. He was glad that he didn't have to share the bathroom with anyone while Ron and Hermione used the other one together. Harry stripped down his flying gear and stepped into the shower, turning on the water. Harry wet his hair and body, scrubbing it with soap and finally stepped out again. Wrapped in a towel, Harry took his wand and shaved his stubbly beard with the help of magic. Even though Harry knew that combing his hair was unnecessary, he tried it anyways, what made it stand out in even more directions than before. He sighed and put on his clothes.
"See, I told you it will be alright." Hermione interrupted Harry smiling, but fell silent again as Ron shushed her because he wanted to hear the rest of the letter.
"Just shut up and mind your own business," Malfoy snarled back.
He lay his head back down on Draco's chest and waited. Draco sighed.
Potter turned around, his back to Draco again and pulled Draco's arm back over his waist. Draco slided closer and snuggled against Potter. Draco closed his eyes.
"Oh come on, as if that wasn't your plan," Draco answered smirking while taking off the dress shirt. He stood there in his tight black undershirt and looked at Potter, who stared back at him.
Ron shrugged. "Dunno what you mean."
"No, that's fine." Harry stood up and walked to the door and opened it.
"You're unbelievable.", Draco said and shook his head laughing. Potter smiled.
"I'm so sorry, Harry." She said and patted his shoulder.
"Well it couldn't have been too bad, could it?" Pansy chuckled, "Otherwise you wouldn't have stayed over."
On the second picture were two girls and a man. The man was around twenty years old and had black hair. The younger one of the girls was around five years old. She had blonde hair and was as pale as a vampire. And the other one was around ten, had blackhair and the same pale skin. Draco smiled.
"And you are mine.", he whispered back.
"So what's going on with you?" She asked and Draco rolled his eyes.
He decided that he had been in the library for long enough and that Potter's annoying friends wouldn't be there anymore, so he went back to their room. But as he opened the door-
Draco could see that they probably have had more than enough to drink already, but they all nodded enthusiastically and Theo put his arms around two of the girls. The last one walked towards Draco, but he didn't put his arm around her or touched her in any way, he just grabbed his lemonade tightly. He was disgusted by her drunken swagger and her smudged lipstick because she'd already been making out with at least five boys at this party.
"I should have." Malfoy said.
"You are trying to figure that egg out, aren't you?", Draco asked.
Potter relaxed a little but he was still looking at Draco oddly.
She stood into the fireplace and spoke very clearly, then vanished and left her son and Harry in the ministry. Malfoy immediately stepped into the fireplace and spoke the same words as his mother and so did Harry after Malfoy had vanished himself.
Draco decided to get up before he packed out another story about these stupid people. "Blaise, I really have to go," Draco said.
"Do you like him?" Blaise asked and his tone changed to surprisingly calm.
"Did I hurt you?" He asked. Potter wildly shook his head and pushed Draco's head back down.
"I don't care what your father says. I'm proud of you. Follow your dreams. I love you.", Narcissa said and Lucius started shouting again.
to be late to class because you were talking to me. And I only want to hold
. Draco pulled a face like he had just bitten into a citrus. The thing that had happened a week ago... Draco didn't want to remember. He was so ashamed of himself. It was nothing, Draco knew that. It's not like the had kissed this idiot or something, he was just so close to him and so nice and handsome and ugh. Draco shivered.
"Who was at the door?" Ginny asked again.
Now Harry had something to say. "Whoa, not so fast, Hermione. Who said anything about
Harry turned his head abruptly when he heard Malfoy talk. Malfoy's eyes were still fixed on the street - he consciously avoided Harry's look - but he talked and that was what mattered to Harry.
"I can't believe it," Ron said.
"Hermione, if you won't shut up I'll curse you alright? I won't discuss with you about Draco. Ask Ron what he thinks about that."
It was short before midnight and Draco pulled on his slippers. He closed the door to their room behind himself and sneaked downstairs.
Draco tried to make his throat work, but he couldn't. No words came out and he had no idea what he could say about that anyways. All that was in his head right now was Potter's face, his hips moving and his long moans.
"Do you want to talk to her?" Harry asked instead.
"Shall we call Hermione? Maybe she knows more." Harry suggested.
"Then why would they have sent you the letter, huh?" Theo asked.
Harry raised an eyebrow. It was almost unbelievable how little they trusted him. "We called a truce."
The minister of Magic hit with the gavel on his desk and the whole room got filled with silence. Draco and his mother sat down and Potter sat next to Narcissa. A door on the back of the courtroom opened and two people brought in a third stool, where a man sat upon. Draco immediately recognised his father's silver hair, that wasn't shining like it once did. Lucius was chained to the stool with magical cuffs on his hands and feet. Draco was shocked when he saw his father. This is what Potter had done. This and nothing else.
"Don't touch me." He said, stressing every syllable.
"Alright. I thought I might go to Diagon Alley again."
"What is
"I need you to help me to open this drawer," Harry said.
Ron nodded. "Yes, my whole family will be there and since most of them live out of town, we don't see all of us together quite so much."
"No problem," the friend answered.
"Leave him alone.", Harry said and pulled and arm around Draco's shoulder.
Malfoy didn't say anything, but his face shouted anger.
"Wow, not bad," Hermione complimented Harry, "I've got three Os." She added.
"If it helps you in any way, I didn't sleep so good as well," Malfoy said.
Hermione bent her head left and right and Harry knew she was thinking hard about it. He and Ron looked put on a begging look and she finally gave in.
"You did?", Potter asked smirking. Draco still shook his head.
"Every teacher?", he repeated and Pomfrey nodded in response.
They stepped aside and made the way clear for Harry. Harry stopped for a second. Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson stood outside, soaked. Harry came closer.
Harry hurried outside again and before he could shout for anyone, music filled his ears. He looked around hastily, but couldn't see anyone. What was going on now? Harry heard someone singing. His heart took a jump when Ron and Hermione stepped out from behind a tent into the light of the bonfire. Hermione held Teddy in her arm.
"What was that all about?"
"Yeah. I had a lot of lessons as a child." Malfoy answered and brushed fish his finger over the black piano.
Malfoy stormed up the stairs, taking two steps at a time. Harry followed him, about two feet behind. He was so out of breath that he could barely manage to call out Malfoy's name one more time. From the corner of his eye Harry saw Neville, Luna, Ron, Hermione and Dean sitting all together at the table in the common room. Harry ignored them, he ignored their stares and immediate whisper, he just ran past them. Before Hermione could even ask what was going on, the loud bang from Malfoy slamming the door shut her up. The door had closed just before Harry's nose. He opened it and banged it behind himself again.
Malfoy's eyes glistened in the colorful light in the pub. He smiled handsomely and Harry felt like he could drown in those steel grey eyes.
"I will keep my mouth shut.", he said.
They stopped in front of the library doors. Ron took a deep breath and Harry lay his hand on Ron's shoulder.
"He doesn't. He makes it brighter. I never thought he could but he does," Potter mumbled back.
Harry grinned. "Pick up, you idiot! What are you waiting for?"
"So I heard," his professor replied knowingly, "Your grades look really good this year."
Harry nodded annoyed and didn't say anything.
"Leave me alone!" Malfoy shouted at him.
"Hey.", Draco said and sounded incredibly nervous.
Potter unbuttoned his pants and Draco crawled down there. He took Potter's very hard and quite...

"Are you kidding me? I'm not going to spend money on this ugly table.", Draco answered with a disgusted look. Harry laughed.
"Well..." Harry started, but he couldn't deny that, so he just shrugged.
in Slytherin. These are the kind of people you want to be around."
"I've never been in here," he said and looked around curiously.
Draco kissed Harry and yawned.
"Malfoy. Don't be a baby." Harry rolled his eyes, "You'll get sick if you keep wearing that."
Harry swung his feet to the floor. His knees felt weak and Harry thought he might collapse. The room was cold and Harry didn't know what to do when he stood in front of Draco's bed.
