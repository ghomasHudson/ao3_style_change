And then, the group of professors made themselves known.
You'll make your real friends,
“Are you doing magic ? Go on then.”
“I knew it was a mistake to ask him!” Weasley whisper yells.
They weren’t spending too much time trying to figure out the situation on the third floor corridor, too little information to go on, but they were at least trying to brainstorm ideas. While Draco would spend time with the trio it wasn’t as if he was a member of their group, he wouldn’t meet them everyday int he library and would hardly interact with then outside of that room. However, that didn’t lead to him spending time with his actual friends either, at first he was glad to be around his childhood friends, before the war had got to the, in the future they were hurt, abused adults but in this present they were somewhat innocent again. He had been glad to get the the chance to spend time with Vincent again, he truly had missed him but seeing the boy now was just too much. And so, Draco spend a lot of his time alone. He would spend his time in small, hidden alcoves he had found during the war (he had been unable and unwilling to fit in the spaces then) or he would simply spend time on the grounds of the castle away from other students.
“Now Draco, this is very important. You will be joined by Harry Potter at Hoigwarts this year.” Draco faked excitement. “Yes, I understand this is exciting but you must not go near that boy, you must not interact with him unless ordered to by your superiors, and you will definitely not become friends with him. Is that understood ?”
“Oh you may not think I'm pretty,
Shit. Shit shit shit. What if Draco didn’t get sorted into Slytherin. What if he got put into Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff or god forbid Gryffindor. What if - what if his mother never wanted to see him again. He had only just got her back, he couldn’t lose her again. Not because of that stupid hat.
if you've a ready mind,
You're in safe hands (though I have none)
Hey guys, once again thank you so much for the support. I’ll be going through the grammar of this chapter and the previous one tomorrow :) Sorry I haven’t been able to fix any mistakes (if there were any - I’m sure there probably was) in the previous chapter. My life is mental at the moment, starting a temporary job soon and then going off to uni :):)
“Should you really be sitting with Harry ?” Ron asked. “It’s just. I know about your parents.”
Small steps.
“Of course you did,” He drawled. “And to think I was starting to think you might almost be as smart as me. Trust me, Professor Snape wouldn’t try to kill Potter.”
Draco got changed into clothes that stopped fitting him years ago and shoes that his mother was glad to get rid of. She hated the colour of them, the shade of brown. Draco would wear them anyway, and his mother had waited for the day he outgrew them. It was a Thursday, she smiled while telling Dobby to be rid of them.
“Okay my little dragon. I’ll see you in a while.”
Potter coughed and the three directed there eyes towards him. “Anyway, we, well I - I wanted to ask if you would help us, incase anything else happens. I’m not saying, I’m not saying anything else will happen but well just incase. You’d be a great help -“
“We were looking for you on the train.” Goyle spoke, sliding up to the blonde. Potter and Weasley were still standing beside him but Draco only had eyes for Crabbe.
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
“We?”  Draco asks.
The sorting ceremony went the same was as last time, Weasley, Hermione and Potter all being sorted into Gryfinndor. Draco ignored Dumbledore’s ‘speech’, he couldn’t bare to look up from his hands, the ‘speech’ was short anyway just Dumbledore being mental like he always was. Draco didn’t realise how hungry he had been until the feast commenced, the other Slytherins were making idle chat but he didn’t want to bother with conversation, he didn’t really want to look up from his plate. He couldn’t chance looking at Severus again, if he did he feared he might cry, and it had been drilled into his head from a young age that a Malfoy shouldn’t show that much emotion in public.
This was it. His chance to distance himself from Potter. Draco pulled his eyes from Crabbe and looked at the raven haired boy. “You can go ahead, I want to stay with these two. It only four a boat anyway.”
“Why did you help her, why do you care about her so much, have a crush Malfoy ?”
“He was being sabotaged.”
“Has anyone seen a toad ? A boy named Neville’s lost one.”
“When you two are done flirting.” Weasley says, flatly. Draco she’s Hermione blushes, her face almost crimson.
“Have you. Have you been ignoring us ?” Greg asked, he was always quite shy when they were younger - that being clear by the look on his face.
“Draco.” A voice behind him called, they had just got off at the platform when Crabbe and Goyle caught up to him.
“What?”
“I will miss you my little dragon.” Narcissa spoke, she didn’t hug him but placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder.
“Yes.” He spoke. “Are you going to sit or just stand in the door?”
He could try.
“Well, you see, I - I can never get to you you’re always surrounded by Slytherins and I -“
“Do not try and fool me Draco, me and you both know what I am referring to. I know that you understand what a powerful spell that was, and how you - an eleven year old boy should not have been able to perform it.”
Where they are just and loyal,
Draco had barely been paying attention to the match, and definitely wasn’t watching Potter throughout so he didn’t really understand what Hermione was talking about. However he somewhat remembered Potter having difficulties the first time round but the boy not being able to control his nimbus was hardly cause for concern and he really didn’t see how it was relevant.
How could he possible deny Hermione Granger, after all she went through.
“I. I couldn’t find you, so I sat with these two.” He said gesturing towards the boy-who-lived and his sidekick.
This definitely didn’t happen last time. Potter didn’t smile at him last time, he hadn’t spoken to him for this long last time. He hadn’t asked for his name last time.
“Draco.”  Potter whispered to himself. “I’m Harry.”
“It would be nice if you would come, Draco.” Potter stared.
“Well, Godfather. I saw it in a book, before arriving at Hogwarts, in the main library at home. I had just gotten my wand and wanted to practise some magic, and well I practised the wand movement and incarnation at home. Of course it never worked in the manor. I suppose when I saw what damage the troll could do I panicked and it was the first useful spell that came to my mind. Trust me I am just as shocked as you see that it actually worked.” Draco rambled out, trying to keep some Malfoy composure.
“No I don’t suppose I will.”
“But, but why ? I thought we were friends. Friends help each-other.”
“Oh merlin.” Potter paled. “Oh.”
Thank you for 100 kudos :)
He assumed Mcgonagall had just placed Potter on the team, which was completely stupid and irresponsible as it always had been - first years weren’t allowed to play for a reason, when he heard his name being yelled.
Where you ought to be.
“Draco, my dear. Are you awake.”
“Dra- Malfoy” bellowed behind him, he was alone in a somewhat empty corridor when he turned to see Potter marching up to him.
Despite Hermione’s words Draco did not join the trios library sessions in search of Potters true tormentor. He kept his eye out for any strange behaviour and planned to report anything he saw to Hermione but nothing was happening. Potter was ignoring him, students were behaving normally around the chosen one and teachers were being their usual selfs.
God what if he really didn’t get Slytherin, how could he be Goyle’s friend if he was in Hufflepuff, how could he convince Pansy that blood status didn’t matter if he was in Ravenclaw, how could he save Crabbe’s life if he was in Gryffindor.
“Enough to hurt you ?” Draco replied. “It just doesn’t make sense, why would he want to ?”
He had hoped his absence int he Slytherin common room had gone somewhat in noticed, this was delusional of him. He had been friends with most of the first year Slytherins before they attended Hogwarts, and they were aware of what sort of child he had been. His clear change in personality had come to a head on a Wednesday in early November. He was for once actually int he common room, sitting on his old chair studying. And then Greg and Vincent made there way over.
“I knew you’d protect your precious head of house, Malfoy.” Weasley groaned, “But you weren’t there and we -“ he gestured between himself and Hermione “we know what we saw.”
“Hermione she - she, she’s in the girls bathroom, she doesn’t no about the troll. Merlin, I need to help her.”
“Right my little dragon, that is all for today. We should be getting back soon. Your father won’t be home for dinner but we really shouldn’t stay out too late.”
“Sit.” Lucius ordered him the second Draco set foot in his study.
“Well, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. I guess I wouldn’t actually mind Ravenclaw. But my father would kill me so It’s probably for the best that I’m the way I am, Slytherin through and through really.”
The room smelt like it did when he was thirteen, of chocolate and dirt and his mother’s perfume. God. He hadn’t smelt that scent, that perfume since she died, nearly a year ago. The funeral had been small. She deserved more. She deserved bigger, she deserved to be  mourned in mass, not just by him. He savoured that smell, sitting on the edge of his bed, with his feet on the carpet and his hands clutching his quilt. Then he pushed himself up and looked around. He didn’t look much, he just scanned the room and then headed to his bathroom. And there he was. Him. But young. Small. Eleven.
“I’ll try harder. I promise.”
Before waking up in the past Draco had had an unproductive day, he had used his mother’s wand to clear some water he had spilt in the morning, then he showered and lied on his chair, his feet resting on a stained coffee table with the television blasting in the background. Draco hated the television, but it drowned out his thoughts and it was far better then his own mind. Draco had then spoken to Claire in the flat opposite him, she was pretty and young like him and she was on her way to the job centre that day, he had smiled at her and waved her goodbye. After that Draco feel asleep, and the woke. Cooked a simple meal, ate it with the television still blasting in the background. Draco washed his plate. Poured a glass of cheap wine, drank the wine. Cried. Made his way to bed, cried some more and the slept. And Draco had woke up eleven again, on the 31st of July and was now standing at the foot of his fathers study.
“Malfoy you actually came ?” Weasley asked when Draco made his way up to the table, he sounded somewhat surprised.
“Oh, my little one. Look at your hair. You look lovely.”
“What do you mean ?”
Hi, I’m sorry if there are any mistakes I’ll go through it in the morning but I’m so tired, I just wanted to post something :) Also, thank you so much for the support and kind words :):)
When he broke from her he asked “are you okay.”
“Do you have anything useful to say or are you just going to insult us?” Weasley asks.
Getting his wand was awful. When he walked into the shop with his mother behind him he was so sure he was going to be sick, his heart stopped and his palms went clammy by his side. Because there he was, Ollivander.
Crabbe had been the one to call his name, it felt weird. Hearing a dead man speak to him, he couldn’t stop picturing Crabbe’s burning flesh and the sounds of his screams, couldn’t stop hearing Goyle’s loud cries. Goyle hadn’t been well after Crabbe died, Draco was already fading by that point but he had still cried. Crabbe definitely wasn’t the smartest or the nicest but he could be funny and caring and he was Draco’s friend and Draco had loved him like a brother. Seeing the boy now set his mind on fire, he began counting in his head to calm himself down.
But Lucius Malfoy was never right, and Draco knew that now.
His panicked thoughts where snapped when he was manhandled walking towards the Great hall at lunch, he had sat through lessons that he didn’t not pay any attention to all morning - not that he needed to pay attention, first year was easy enough and he was excelling in all his studies, he had managed to brew perfect potions each time, transfigured flawless and had constantly been excelling in his essays.
The hand that gripped him pulled him into an abandoned classroom just before the hall. The hand of course belonged to Potter. Weasley wasn’t far behind him, being the perfect sidekick as always. Potter looked like he was trying to come across as serious and began to open his mouth but Weasley interrupted whatever he was going to say by blurting out “Why did you help Hermione ?”
“Thank Merlin.” Draco breathed. “I thought I was in a conversation with three idiots for a moment, it good to know it’s only two.”
Potter frowned. “Four a boat? Well, we could always walk there together.”
“Hogwarts.” He whispered, voice almost whimpering.
“Salazar, Hermione. Don’t jump up on people like that.” Draco
“These two I assumed would be stupid enough to break the rules but Hermione ? You as well, really?” Draco sneers.
“Potter, seriously leave go and find your Weasley and Hermoine and -“
“There was a trap door, Hermione saw it.”
The day after Halloween his mind had been consumed of Azkaban, he hadn’t eaten at breakfast and was unlikely to eat for the upcoming meals either. He had nearly considered telling Severus about being sent back, and while he knew that his godfather would help him and would never got to the ministry, he was still unwilling to tell.
“Goodbye Draco.” His father bellowed. “Do not forget our words.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“But why should that matter ? Why did you do what you did today, I could see that you didn’t want to and -“
This time round he found it hard to pretend to be eleven -  even tough he was. He found it hard to laugh with his friends or relax in their presences. He found it hard to feel happy at the feast, he knew what was coming and he knew it was the beginning of the end. It was Quirell who was a follower, it was the beginning of that man ruining him.
Will always find their kind;
“Will- will I see you at Hogwarts then ?” Potter asked.
“Yes it is, but we get sorted into houses when we first arrive. There are four. I’ll be in Slytherin I suppose.” Draco missed those dorms, the dorms from when he was eleven. He did not miss the dorms from when he was sixteen. “You’ll probably be in Gryffindor, it suits you.” He said with a toothy grin. Potter was th biggest Gryffindor Draco had ever met.
Draco stood from his chair and began to tuck it under the desk when Potter stood.
“I was planning on just insulting if I’m complete honest, Weasel.”
God she was beautiful. That was all Draco could think. She was gorgeous. And breathing and alive. This had to be a dream, a cruel and vivid dream that would leave him crying in the morning.
No I’m really not.
“You spend all your time in the library these day Draco. We just miss you.” Greg mumbled.
The last time Draco had saw him he wasn’t really present, the old man was nearly dead. He wasn’t even screaming anymore, just silently crying while Aunt Bella tortured him. She had made Draco watch, wanting him to learn how to properly torture people, that’s how she phrased it. “Draco, my dear nephew, you need to learn how do do it properly” Draco had seen Ollivander in his dreams that night, he was begging Draco to save him, but of course Draco never did.
“Plus. Draco is really nice.” Potter smiled.
When he didn’t receive a response soon enough, Draco simply turned around and left. The nerve of Potter to simply demand his time. Of course he would go, but still. The nerve.
Seeing the Slytherin common room again after what felt like an eternity was a punch in the face, god he had missed it, missed the colours and the dark brick, missed the fire place and the rug, missed the stairs and the tables. The prefects had began reeling the first years some important information that he already knew when Severus made his way into the room, he made a similar speech to last time, if he remembered correctly and gave a small almost impossible to notice (unless you knew what it looked liked) smile toward Draco. It made the boy’s chest feel tight and eyes begin the waver. He hesitantly returned a small smile and focused back if the prefects words.
It was her. Her. It was her voice. Alive and real and clear. Draco stopped breathing.
“No - I - I didn’t mean it like that.” Potter spoke gently. “I would just really like your help.”
The day was the 31st of July, he remembered this day, when he lived it for the first time. It was the day he met Potter. The day he had first saw him, in madam malkin’s. And Draco was reliving it. Why, he wasn’t sure.
“No, no Dobby.” Draco spoke softly, wiping the sleep from his eyes and turning to fully face the house elf. “I want to apologies. And I want to say sorry.”
“Do you know what house you’ll be in ?” Draco asked in his most calming voice.
Walking around the manor now, in the past was distressing, distressing because it looked like his home but he could still hear the screams in the back of his mind. He could hear Luna Lovegood screaming and Granger - no, Hermione crying.
That was it. That was his parting message from his parents. Last time he had found his way to Crabbe and Goyle immediately, they were always the first ones on the train it seemed. But Draco couldn’t handle seeing Crabbe, not now, not yet. The last time he saw him the larger boy was burning and screaming.
“Oh sorry.” Of course it was Potter. “Oh hi, Draco. I didn’t know if anyone was in here but I’m glad it’s you. I was going to look for you on the train but I guess I won’t have to now I’ve found you. I’m sorry for rambling, can you tell that I’m nervous ?”
Draco was standing being measured when he heard the bell ring on the door, and Harry Potter walked through. Draco didn’t remember Potter being this small, this thin. He supposed be hadn’t thought about it the first time they met, the first time they met he didn’t know who he was. Draco could hardly stomach confrontations with Potter in the future, every time he saw him it reminded him of his scar and how he looked.But now his scar was gone and if this was real, surely it would be better to try and get along with Potter. No matter how much he disliked this boy.
He pushed through the group of first year and made his way up to the stool.
Draco hadn’t used his wand since Potter took it, he had been using his mother’s for some time now. She didn’t enjoy using magic in her final months, not after father. So Draco had used her wand, and while it was good and somewhat trustworthy it wasn’t his.
Potter kept sneaking glances his way, he could feel it on the side of his neck. Draco instantly thought that Potter was staring at the scar he had caused but no it was gone - and he was eleven and Potter was just being weird.
Just maybe.
Why was he back here ?
As soon as he heard the words he sprinted toward the second floor girls bathroom. His head was pounding - his mind yelling at him, repeating. She can’t die. She can’t die. She can’t die.
“Was that all ?” Draco asks, standing up from his chair.
“No, Potter just leave.”
Unlike last time the hat actually sat on his head and didn’t instantly scream out Slytherin.
“Okay. I have your letter here. We will collect your things and if you behave ,well I will treat you to some ice cream before we return, how does that sound ?”
“What.” Potter asked.
“Yes” he drawls. “Continue Potter.”
“I have to go, Potter.”
“What about it.”
“He thinks you hate him.”
Draco worked tirelessly to ignore Potter over the coming days, the boy was always staring at him, it wasn’t liked e pointed daggers he had got used to during his first time at Hogwarts. Harry’s states this time we’re unnerving, they were filled with curiosity and wondering. Draco hated it. He had been spending his days trying to formulate some sort of plan on how he he could change things, if he was stuck here, a part of his mind was sure he was probably sleeping or in some sort of coma but the rest of his mind was hopeful that this was real, because if it was real it meant he really didn’t have the dark mark, it meant he didn’t have scars all over his body, meant that his friends and classmates and godfather were actually alive and they could be saved.
“What did I do ?” Potter asked when he made his way close to the boy.
“Right.” Potter coughs, gaining his attention for the first time since Draco sat, ignoring Potter is easier than dealing with that look on the boys face, the one that makes him want to cover his scar-the one that isn’t there anymore. It’s the way he looks at Draco, like he’s actually looking right at him, it’s unnerving and unwanted and so hard to ignore. “We need your help.” Potter says.
“Don’t be stupid, why would Professor Snape try to hurt you ?”
“Fine.”
He could try and hold his godfathers gaze without looking away.
He was aware from his time the first time round that his Godfather had nothing to do with Potter’s quidditch match, he hated the boy but would never go out of his way to try and seriously harm a student. So when the trio of Weasley, Potter and Hermione even suggested Severus was trying to harm a first year he shot it down straight away.
The platform wasn’t as busy as it could have been and Draco was grateful. It was already too much. He recognised so many dead faces. Those who were killed in the battle or tortured in the manor or those who barely survived. Seeing them all together, laughing and playing was too much for him. He had to be alone, his chest was tight and he was so sure he was going to cry.
“Of course my lovely.” She bent down and held his cheek. How he had missed her touch. “I’ll be in your fathers study, by the floo. Just meet me when you are ready. Your father won’t be joining us today.”
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
His mind stopped, he had missed nearly half of the sorting. It would be fine, surely he would be okay. Surely the hat would understand.
“Do you really, Draco ?” She questioned. “If you do, why did you spend so much time with us, with Harry ?”
“Good morning mother.” His voice was high pitched and younger than it had been in a very long time. “I’m sorry. I-I I had nightmare and I felt sick and I can’t eat right now. I’m sorry.” He spoke in a small voice, it was earnest.
Being civil with Hermione, Potter and the Weasel was exhausting. Well, Hermione wasn’t all too bad,sure she would constantly bombard him with magical questions or relentlessly ask him to be her study partner. )He had agreed of course, Hermione was the smartest witch in their year and even though Draco had learnt it all before, it wouldn’t hurt to spend time with the bushy haired girl.) but she was also clearly the brains of the trio and somehow managed to keep the two boys in check. On the other hand spending time with Weasley felt like torture, he could ramble on and on about the most irrelevant topics, he could somehow eat an unreasonable amount of sweets and would constantly avoid all forms of studying. Hermione in all her brilliance could trick him into investigating the trap door for a couple of minutes until he gave up. And then there was Potter. Potter who constantly had his eyes on Draco, in the past he had gotten used to this - Potter following him. Potter had constantly watched him throughout his years at the school (particularly in sixth year) but this time round he hadn’t really done anything to reward this behaviour, sure he had taunted him during there first quidditch lesson but apart from that he had tried his hardest to ignore the boy-who-lived. And this time around the states were different, more friendly.
As soon as he made his way towards the door he heard it, Hermione screaming. There were other noises, the troll, Potter and apparently the boy and dragged Weasley along somewhere on the way but all he could hear were the screams. Without thinking he ran in and straight to the girl, the troll was in the corner and Hermione by one of the cubicles and he ran straight to her.
“Hermione,have you considered that maybe I do hate him.” Draco drawled.
Madam Mulkin was as Draco had remembered, she was small and pale and amazing at her job. Draco hadn’t been for a robe fitting in years. He hadn’t needed to. Draco had no reason for a new robe during his later years at Hogwarts and afterwards his mother and him could simple not afford. Draco could hardly afford burying his mother, he could hardly afford her gravestone. She deserved so much more.
Maybe.
Set Gryffindors apart;
“That you, Severus.”
“Professor Snape.” Hermione answered.
“You can believe what you want to believe, Weasley.”
“Are you seriously angry at me for saving the girls life, Weasley” Draco drawled, he was tire of this conversation already. “I really don’t have time for this.”
Being sent back had made him unbelievably scared again, scare that if anyone found out he would be sent back to Azkaban, the ministry wouldn’t believe him if he said it was accidental and that he wasn’t the same man he used to be. Apart of him knew this thinking was childish and idiotic, but he was a child again and he was allowed to be scared.
And unafraid of toil;
“I’m Draco Malfoy.” Weasley laughed, like he had before. Seeing his face closer than last time Draco supposed the laugh was out of nervousness not real hate.
Draco simply ignore the red head and turned his attention onto Potter, who was standing to Dracos left, looking down at his feet.
Draco woke up with a jerk. His hands felt numb and his legs felt too short. The duvet wrapped around his body, and surrounded him in heat. His heart was beating, scared from his dream. His dream he couldn’t remember. Draco sat up, and yawned, he rubbed his eyes opened and moved his feet to the floor. That’s when it hit him. He had wooden floor, not carpeted. He hadn’t had carpeted floor since the manor. And he hadn’t been to the minor since the man died. Draco’s eyes finally focused, but they focused on a room he hardly recognised, a room he hadn’t needed to recognise. Not since he was thirteen. At fourteen he had begged his mother to change the colour of his room, from a deep vibrant green to a dark blue, he had hated the green, hated how it reminded him of his Hogwarts dorm, hated how it had reminded him of magic and of Potter. During the summers he didn’t want to think about Hogwarts and magic and Potter, until he did. He would dream of Hogwarts when he was sixteen, he would pray that he could be back. Be real and safe again. Be away from him, the man who destroyed it.
No, no I’m not loyal.
Potter, the idiot, laughs. “Yes, well. We saw something.”
He would never see his beautiful mother again, he would be disowned. He wouldn’t have any family.
“Yes Severus.” Draco returned looking at his godfather.
“Great.” Draco said through his smile.
“I’m not even going to dignify that with an answer Weasley.” He sneered
“Malfoy, Draco.”
Muggleborns are no different then plurebloods, they deserved magic all the same.
“Yes ?” He drawled.
You can keep your bowlers black,
“Potter.” Draco said. “We just aren’t meant to be friend. You’re the boy-who-lived and as you know my father was a death eater. We weren’t made to get along.”
“You, you were my first friend. You were nice to me and then you just stopped and I don’t understand what I did wrong.” The boy muttered, why did Potter care if he was his friend ? He had Weasley.
Sorry this was shorter than usually,  a bit of a filler before the next chapter :) Thank you again for the support!!!
But don't judge on what you see,
“I did this, didn’t I Narcissa?”
“Did you hear literally nothing I just said? You are dead, and I don’t want you here, so scoot.”
“Of course not, Headmistress. I’m certain he will be a very capable teacher.”
“He had the ultimate choice, the original decision, and he chose you. This place could be your home, should you wish it.”
“Oh, sorry Lady- Narcissa. I think it’s time I went back upstairs for a bit. I’ll see you tomorrow, yes?”
He had dinner plans with Harry that night. It had been a little over a year since they had gotten together.
He picked the latest one up and added it to the others before heading out for his lunch plans.
Summoning another glass of water the blonde placed it gently back inside and went back to eating his lunch. He had a potions convention to attend the next week and had to make sure none of the hospital work was left unfinished.
The wards had been added by the end of the first week.
“What would you know about having friends? You have minions, not friends,” the raven-haired boy returned, eyebrows raised, a half-smirk present on his lips.
“I’ll see you then, but if there are any ducks involved, especially after this embarrassing conversation, then I will murder you and get away it.
“Totally and completely,” Draco nodded, sipping on his own drink.
“Yes, Mistress Malfoy? What can Tibby do for you?” the elf said, popping into the room with a bow.
He was sobbing. His heart, the traitor that it was, hadn’t stopped, at least not yet. Draco was certain it was broken though.
?” the boy practically yelled.
“Okay. Truth this time? I know this is going to be… confusing. Hating someone and then not and still being family, and then watching them leave even if not forever, and… you have a lot of stuff to think over. I get it, better than anyone.” Harry sighed.
“I thought that maybe if I just kept on moving forward, if I kept going with life, things would turn out okay. Isn’t that what everyone always say? ‘It’ll get better in time’ and ‘time fixes everything’. I guess, I just wanted to be okay for you. I didn’t want to let you down.”
3. They were out of country.
“Oh well, we’d be happy to have you until then,” Harry smiled, barely a tremble in his voice, though Draco watched him with growing concern. A week? A week with his childhood bully? Well, his first childhood bully. This was going to be a breeze…
Several more appeared over the course of the next few months. One came on the day of his promotion to head of the Experimental Potions Department. The promotion meant that he had a different office and work area, but nevertheless the flowers kept coming.
“And if I should wish to stay…?”
-------------------------------------
“Tibby will do as the Mistress wishes.” The elf bowed once more and then trailed out, checking to make sure Harry was following.
“No. Never mind. I just thought-” Harry’s sentence trailed off as an arm wrapped around his waist, another behind his neck pressing a set of lips to his.
“It’s just- we weren’t friends, and then we weren’t enemies, and now he’s leaving and I am kind of glad, but then I feel guilty, and I’m kind of sad to lose whatever it is we just built. And-” he cut himself off, taking a breath.
Draco munched on his pastries, shoving that feeling of regret down inside him and instead thinking about what assignments he needed to be doing.
“I'm really not that-” Harry started
He gazed out to the courtyard now.
He let out another sob, and finally allowed himself to cry.
“She’s not my girlfriend”
The laughter rolled on from Blaises remark, childish but unending. They were teenagers after all.
“Well no-” Draco started
“You seem awfully stressed about this ball Ron, you know we don't need dates?” Harry spoke
He passed an isle with a sole occupant who was hunched over one of the many books that lay sprawled out and open on the desk.
They both silently looked at the board for a few moments.
Harry stepped inside, his eyes darting around the room and landing on the group of Slytherin.
He was almost worried she was going to throw another punch his way. Not that he was scared of her of course, he still claimed that it was simply a cheap shot on her part as he hadn’t been expecting it.
Draco read on
“Just the person I needed to talk to.” Snape spoke
She reached over and snatched the paper out of Ron's hand, folding it up neatly before placing it down on her lap.
He slowly moved through the isles as he had been caught one too many times rushing around and he didn’t feel like getting that lecture again by that horrid Librarian.
Draco seemed to have to think for a few moments, eyes darting around in thought.
“Yes.. thank you, Ron” Harry drawled
“Oh, god. We’re falling behind” Ron spoke, his head in his hands now
Draco cursed, finding himself tailing Harry who was already at the end of the hall by the time he left the library. He came to a stop and sighed, running a hand through his hair as he watched the end of the now empty hallway before he turned and went back to his room.
"Wait, you're going with Goyle? like, going with him?" Pansy frowned
“I didn’t think it was a big deal, okay? I was just poking fun.” Draco spoke
“I have to go.” Harry spoke, more so thinking out loud than telling Draco
However, Draco didn’t laugh. Instead he hesitated, and his pointed features hardened.
“I asked Lavender yesterday, and you know what she said?” Seamus paused “She said yes!”
“Upset, Potter? Maybe if you hadn't put your name in the goblet in the first place this could all be avoided.” Draco spoke
Draco hadn’t been there to see Harry receive the letter, so he was just going off the hope that he’d received it as Draco and his posse of five piled into the observatory, owls cooing and rustling about as they moved closer to the wall by the entrance as to be undetected by Potter at first glance.
He had seen the frizzy haired Hermione nose deep in books in shared classes or scurrying around the hallways, throwing Draco the dirtiest of looks.
Ron nodded, leaning back in his chair and scanning the common room to probably find the next person he wanted to beat at chess.
“Hey, Parvati. Padma.” Harry rushed out
The frown remained on Harrys face as he watched Draco speak.
“See Potter, nobody really needs you." Draco paused
“You think-” Draco started
There was something about Harry bouncing back after being the victim of Dracos own bullying rubbed him the wrong way, so he felt the need to continue. Maybe it was he admired what Harry had, that very ability to bounce back. To work through it, to move on, continue to save the day.
“Did you ever ask her if she was?” Harry asked
They sat opposite each other in front of a chessboard, and Ron was kicking his ass effortlessly.
“Found a date to the ball yet?” Draco's face broke out into an amused grin and he stood up from leaning against the wall
It was confusing, disorientating even. He noticed how Draco watched with intent, like he was soaking up every word and movement.
Harry looked defeated, tired, his face was sullen, hair shaggy and glasses sitting slightly crooked on his face.
“What? I-” Harry tried, only to be interrupted again
“Again? I think you are turning into Hermione.” Ron spoke
Slytherin's common room was calling his name, rushing down the hallway until he was halted by a familiar set of heavy black robes.
“Malfoy?” Harry spoke simply
Nobody else seemed to notice the strain in his voice, as Pansy was too busy entertaining the others as they mocked the look on Harry's face.
“I heard about your little incident with Potter. Do you think that’s keeping your head down?” Snape frowned down at him
Harry looked around now, glancing each way. There was nobody else around, no sounds to be heard beside the gentle patter of rain painting the uncovered pavement a darker shade.
He thought the whole ferret incident with Moody would’ve made Draco back off, but he hadn’t. And come to think of it, he thought maybe the Cho prank was some sort of revenge. If Draco’s strategy was to just get progressively meaner every time Harry got him back then so be it.
“But I haven’t-” Draco started, as he had been too distracted with following his feelings to even retrieve what he came for
They chatted amongst themselves until they heard steps not far off in the distance, and some of them started finding it hard to contain their laughter like this was the funniest thing in the world.
Draco hesitated a moment before he took a few steps backwards and leant back slightly to see if it was who he thought it was.
"What? No- I meant general. As friends- a group" Draco pinched the bridge of his nose then glanced at Pansy again "I assume you're going?"
“There's no way you stand a chance against Cedric, and half the school thinks you're a dastardly liar.” Draco spoke
"Well, are you going then Goyle?" Draco asked
“Harry, I know it's embarrassing but it’s not worth missing classes for. You’re just letting Draco have the upper hand” Hermione spoke in that very Hermione tone she always had. Loving, but with a firm undertone and a realistic point of view.
Harry had spent less than half an hour at the library, worried he’d get sucked into more countless hours flipping through books only to come up with nothing. He couldn’t focus either and opted to go for a walk down to the courtyard before going back and letting his friends talk his ear off about whatever was going on.
Not that he was looking for anything in particular of course, his eyes almost straining as he looked over at the Gryffindor table which was separated by at least a dozen heads.
Draco reached back into his memory to recall Snape gathering them all in a room to explain something about an upcoming dance.
Harry gave Ron a look
Draco only shrugged
Everything that Draco was lacking.
“Very smooth. You know, I could teach you some moves.” Seamus winked at him
Especially those who were unfortunate enough to attend the same year as Harry bloody Potter, where around every corner there seemed to be another problem brewing.
Harry sat deep in his chair in the Gryffindor common room, elbow on the arm rest and head in his hand as he watched as Ron made a face at Hermione once his reading material had been taken away.
“Don’t come near me!” Harry snapped, shoving Draco back
“Never thought I'd be cheering on a bloody Hufflepuff. Useless, the lot of them.” Draco mumbled, as if he were merely speaking his mind out loud.
Damn. Humiliation kept him grounded, sure, but slow dancing with Ron in front of their entire year? That was a bit much. Maybe he should have been the one to ask Hermione.
That's when Draco noticed it, a glazed look over the other boy's eyes.
“Bloody hell, Seamus” Ron spoke, dropping his food back on his plate like it had personally offended him.
“I’m so tired of you!” Harry stressed again “I'm tired of your group and your little girlfriend, i'm tired of these god forsaken tasks, and these assignments, I'm tired of Ron and Hermione. It’s every day, all the time, at school, at home, in the hallways, I can't get a break around here can I!” Harrys voice was steadily rising and he was at the point of yelling
And maybe it was that evil Draco felt metastasising inside him that made things harder to deal with. He didn’t know.
His mouth went dry, he could now taste the bitterness of the words that had come rolling naturally out his mouth and he shifted at the feeling.
“Yes, professor? I’m not in trouble am I?” He asked
But, when that wasn't in sight he knew hope was lost and he had no other bearings. They weren’t at breakfast. Potter or the other two stooges.
On top of the personal shame brought on by the group of Slytherins, he had every other regular Joe in his year whispering about his personal life. It felt invasive and was a whole nother level of teenage-angst and humiliation on top of the simple everyday events of his life. The tournament. The inevitable darkness looming overhead. The droning of his concerned friends, his snappy Potions professor always breathing down his neck.
He shook himself out of his thoughts and they were soon making their way out with a flurry of robes and echoed voices.
“It’s alright, Ron” Harry laughed as Ron had been the one to bring it up more than anyone else.
Draco found these situations less on the amusing side, instead using his insistent cruelty and bullying to fuel something bitter that had been growing and festering inside him.
Dracos eyes trailed over to the exit where Harry was no longer in sight, the setting sun streaming into the stone walled room and for a moment Draco thought about taking off after him.
Draco had now only noticed that eye sore sitting on the desk on the far side of Harry, the golden egg reflecting brilliantly despite the muted light of the library.
“Check it out, Draco.” Goyle spoke, shoving a copy of The Daily Prophet toward him
It was the same, hopeless feeling Draco got when he watched his father yell and shout at some poor house elf who had simply been somewhere at the wrong time.
“I do actually. I’m going with Pansy” Draco spoke
He ignored the concerned undertone, knowing they often were overly worried whenever notable things happened- which also happened to be very frequently.
In Dracos pensive silence, Harry was still speaking. Draco wasn’t listening though. Harrys face still looked sullen, eyes red rimmed and the same glazed look that Draco had caught when he had made the boy cry.
“Don’t be so full of yourself, Potter. This bloody school is full of half-wits and mud-bloods every morning I’m basically knee deep in filth.” Draco spoke
“Yeah” Draco snickered “Pathetic, that one”
Draco wore a more casual looking version of the school uniform on most weekends- dark grey vest and a white button up underneath, even sporting a Slytherin scarf. Harry wondered what it was like having so little self expression.
Of course he was. Harry frowned.
“Got a date for the ball yet boys?” Seamus piped up from across the table
"Oh, well I suppose I will then. Wouldn't want you going alone" Draco spoke
He recognised that the weight of the world was starting to sit heavy on their shoulders- Harry more so than anyone, and Draco started to feel that same pressure twisting up his insides. He heard his father's voice echo in the back of his mind, the Dark Lord's plan for him and his family. He felt the only control he ever had over his life was when he was making someone else feel like shit.
“You know i’m happy for you. She’s just as- if not more insufferable than you. I’m sure you’ll have a grand time with her Malfoy.” Harry spoke bitterly
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, Draco has that effect on people” Ron spoke, watching as Harry leant over to move a piece.
But he brushed it off.
He hated Draco.
He may or may not have tipped off a certain gossip seeking beetle of the story that was about to go down.
“Do you two by chance have a date to the ball?”
"He talks about a lot of things, and I think many things about Snape" Draco spoke
There was a long pause where they were both staring at each other. Draco almost didn’t realise he had said it out loud if it weren't for the deep frown settling into Harrys face.
Harry left behind the laughing group, Pansy hitting Draco's arm playfully as their plan had been executed perfectly.
He gestured behind himself at Ron who was still staring into the fire, almost lustfully now. Harry cleared his throat to get Rons attention but even that didn't work, so he glanced back at the sisters. Padma looked concerned, but Parvati was still smiling.
However he was all eyes, and no ears. The way he seemed to listen vigorously or his contemplative demeanour meant nothing to him when whatever came spilling out his mouth was nothing short of foul.
Harry laughed as he got up from his chair
“Oh god, you sound like Hermione now.” Ron knitted his eyebrows together “Are you going to tell me you already have a date and then storm off too?”
He felt every emotion as it passed through him, like a weight sitting heavy on his chest. The embarrassment, the anger, the stress, the sorrow, the fear, the pure, relentless day-to-day tiredness he felt.
“The look on his face!” Pansy wailed
Draco stilled for a few moments
“Or perhaps you can shack up with your little Weasel sidekick” Blaise jeered from beside Pansy
“I said out!” She cried, her shrill voice was enough to make them both scatter like mice.
“Sorry- I didn’t want to wake you.” Ron started as he watched Harry now “You look so peaceful when you’re asleep”
“Shh!” Draco took a step forward so that Harry would tone it down as they were on the path of getting kicked out
“Look, if you’re going to miss some classes so be it. I’m with you all the way” Ron smiled
He could see the gears turning in Harrys head, eyebrows knitting together in worry and confusion at first
“Dear god, you look like shit Potter” Draco piped up suddenly, causing the other boy to stop mid sentence
“Well, would you like to go with me and Ron?” Harry asked
Draco slipped onto the seat in the dining hall the next morning, taking up a usual spot in between two of his friends- today it was Goyle and Pansy. Pansy seemed to be everywhere nowadays, he noted. Only after they had come back from break he had noticed she had taken more of a liking to him than usual.
How were they even allowed to be skipping these classes? And why did he even care?
Which was followed by the regret he felt for his own actions, and before the confusion started to settle in, Draco shut it down. It wasn’t something he wanted to deal with right now, the can of worms he just couldn’t release. Not in the library at least.
"With you, as in.. my date?" Draco asked
“I know, I know” Harry sighed, tilting his head into his hand so his palm was resting on his forehead and he closed his eyes.
“Are you about to cry, Potter?” Pansy shrieked, causing an outburst of laughter from the rest of the group once again, this one louder than the last.
“I just thought she’d mention it!” Ron stressed “And you know what? Now Nevilles asked my bloody sister to the ball. Neville.”
“I said sod off, Malfoy.” Harry snapped, tone harsh “I just got rid of Ron and I don’t want you sniffing around trying to rile me up again”
“And you just assume i'm not going with anyone?” Hermione spoke
“Potter musn’t get discouraged from this Tournament.” Snape paused “You’re going to get yourself into more trouble than it's worth”
He walked down the open hallway, cool grey stone pillars arching brilliantly on either side of him as the wind tousled his hair.
“Oh yeah...if he’s not already doing it with that pitiful little mud-blood you call a friend” Draco added
Harry shook his head slightly and waved him off.
Before he could analyse the situation anymore he felt something digging into his shoulder, Harry was pushing past him harshly and leaving without another word.
On most days he started to feel like a nuclear reactor, toxicity oozing and seeping through every pore and sometimes when he looked in the mirror at the end of the day, he was worried he was one wrong move from melting down.
He wondered if he had something to do with it, but before he could think more about the subject the abrupt laughter from those around him whipped him back to reality.
A lie.
Dudley was tasked with ferrying the broken pieces to the growing pile outside, as Draco tried to re-charm and install the new devices. Harry was… providing moral support? And light? Some of the time?
“Ummm, something like that.”
------------------------------------
Regardless of anything else though, the thing he couldn’t get out of his head no matter how hard he tried, the most important thing: Draco was lying to him. Draco was lying to him and he didn’t know why. He didn’t seem to be hurting anyone or anything, so there were no issues there. He didn’t think Draco would do that anymore. Well, not counting the- yeah not even going to go there. No, the problem was he had lied to Harry. And it stung, more than he was willing to admit.
The years passed.
“Stupid, ignorant, selfless, dumb…
It was Draco.
“Uh, yes.”
Out of the blue, two bodies appeared around him, and he moved to try and attack them or slip away or something, before realising… it was Granger and Weasley.
He hadn’t seen the man in months, assumed him dead for a while, and there he was. Pale and dying.
A small pessimistic part of him whispered about how ‘safe’ it had been during his childhood, but he pushed the thought away.
Harry did end up regretting it, but only momentarily.
Harry had begun staying at the castle with Minerva a few years after the end of the war. He had gone to The Burrow, and then Grimmauld Place for a little while, but he’d felt lost. He was ready to greet the new year and the new hope it brought. He was done wallowing in what he had wished for as a child. Life moved on, and he was ready for something new. He was done being some pawn, or war hero. He was just Harry.
“-and cookies,” Harry amended, “and then we can put all of this back together,” he said glancing between the half cleaned up kitchen and new boxes Draco had shrunk to fit on the table.
It took hours, but the mass cleared. The service had lasted most of the morning and many stragglers stayed behind to place flowers well up to five in the evening, but Draco was patient. He could be patient. It wasn’t like he had anywhere else to be.
------------------------
“Low blow Potter,” Draco drawled, “but I am fairly certain I know more than you seeing as you didn’t even know you were a wizard until you eleven.”
“Well done,” a voice said, startling him from his internal monologue.
“Honestly, that word again. Does your vocabulary consist of nothing else?” Draco cried, very clearly exasperated. Harry just chuckled.
He walked around the corner towards the Gryffindor common rooms not even a week after the article was published, and fell to the ground as a curse hit him square in the chest. He wasn’t able to focus very well, but he assumed the assailants were probably deatheaters, or ex-deatheaters, or sympathizers, or family members. Who didn’t want to kill him these days?
The building towered above him, tall and dark and ominous. Well, technically the gates of the estate loomed before him but even from a distance the Malfoy Manor looked enormous.
, I will accept your offer of an olive branch, if that is truly what you are offering.” Harry saw Dudley sigh, the tension leaving his shoulders, as though a great weight had been lifted off them.
“Hey,” the blond said as he walked through the bookshop’s door, a bell chiming above his head. “Ready to go?”
He inched closer, trying to keep his footsteps as soft as possible. The blonde’s complexion only got worse the closer he got to it. There wasn’t even a hint of colour on him. He was almost as white as his wings. He reached the bed an accidently knocked a glass off his bedside table. The raven flinched as it fell to the floor and shattered, but the blonde’s breath didn’t so much as hitch. He wasn’t even certain he was breathing.
It had been ten years, and still Draco came back twice a year. Once about a week before the anniversary and once more on the date. He tended to stand back on the anniversary though. Occasionally, other people showed up, and he didn’t need the questions, or the hate.
The witch, clad in formal robes - returning from said convention Harry assumed - sat on the edge of his bed. She just sat there for a moment. The familiar sensation of her magic the only sign that she was still in fact alive. Harry wondered if she was going to get up and leave, but she didn’t. a minute or two passed and he felt a hand rest against the tips of his fingers.
. One story in particular caught his eye. The pages were creased, and fading. One of the corners had even been dog-eared repeatedly, which seemed unlike the blonde, but he continued reading.
Of course, the great Potter not being able to fly properly would lead to accusations of sabotage.
Draco walked away before he could mess up his words anymore, it wasn’t that he wanted to be friendly with Potter, he hated him, Potter was impulsive and ignorant and annoying. Sure he had wanted to be his friend the first time round but that was different, there was too much there. Distance was good, it meant he didn’t have to be that terrible child he once was, he could make sure he changed the things he needed to change while Potter still ended up in the same path.
“House ? I-I I thought it was a castle.” Potter glanced nervously at him.
No I’m really not yet put me in Slytherin.
“Yes, well. I don’t see how that is relevant.” Draco said. “I didn’t serve him, I was just a baby when he got defeated. I’m not my parents.”
“My Draco, if this is true.”
“Wow- where did you learn to do that?” Potter asked in the distance.
“Wicked. I’m Ron, Ron Weasley” Weasley spoke well steeping into the compartment and sitting next to Draco, so he was facing Potter. He didn’t seem to even notice Draco was there until Potter looked over to the blonde. The ginger visibly tensed.
, and started reading where he had left off. He had long finished it and read a range of other books, but he liked the stories. He continued on reading the Warlock’s story, pausing every once in a while, to simply watch the blonde, contemplating Narcissa’s words.
“I am sorry.”
“Glad to hear it,” she smiled. “Now Harry, we have a few new teachers coming today, and I thought I should forewarn you in case you weren’t expecting to see them around.”
The rest of the golden trio never joined them, but occasionally he saw them in the library, at a different table of course, just watching the two of them. Their gazes were filled with pity, and in the Weasley’s case, distrust. But they didn’t ever approach, so his thoughts never strayed to them long.
“Oh, right. Thank you,” he mumbled, still in a slight state of shock, as he stepped forward.
“You haven’t seemed to notice, but the world doesn’t stop when you are having a bad day,” Harry continued, at which Draco looked indignant, but before he could interrupt Harry continued, “but I will do anything and everything in my power to stop my world for you. You are my world, Draco. You have been for a long time. It didn’t matter to me what was happening. My world needed me, and I need you. I need you like I need air to breathe. Everything else, just… falls away.”
“What am i- What am I talking about? You complete and utter git! I am talking about this monstrosity!” He gestured vaguely upwards, wings still trembling behind him. “What on earth have you even done? How am I supposed to get this out?”
“Indeed Ms. Granger. How are your endeavours into the Freedom Acts going?” He asked politely, swirling the small glass of bubbling liquid.
“Draco? Draco? Draco!” a voice cried, and a hard mass launched itself towards the boy and squeezed him.
“Thank you,” the raven murmured.
They stayed on Harry’s bed after that. Draco didn’t leave and Harry didn’t ask. So, there they stayed. It was three in the morning. Neither of them were going to get back to sleep.
Well, if his heart hadn’t stopped before it certainly had now. This was such a stupid idea. It was a terrible, completely idiotic idea, wrought with flaws.
He could walk away. He could walk away, and pretend this never happened. He could keep the distance he had asked for when the blonde lied to him. He could call for the elf again and ask to be led out. He could leave. But he wasn’t going to, was he?
That was perhaps the strangest thing Draco had ever read. Did he want to go? Wait. What time was it? A quarter past seven!?!? He guessed this got him out of an awkward situation… But, what if the person was still waiting for him? What if they did actually know him? What if this wasn’t some ridiculous Gryffindor rouse and they were still outside in the cold?
Draco just shook his head indulgently at his husband.
“And, where are the spare towels?”
The blonde glared but made no further comment. He hadn’t become quite as rowdy as Harry in his tipsy state, but the tips of his ears had turned a delightful shade of pink. It was kind of adorable.
“But I choose you Draco. Isn’t that enough?”
“I do believe that’s why you married me, love. But I love you too,” Harry smiled, snuggling closer as the blonde laid back down to enjoy their lazy morning together.
Time Draco may not have.
“I’m afraid there was… an accident. We would like you to come in-” Before the words had left the other man’s mouth, he had hung up, grabbed his coat and was in the Floo headed for St Mungos.
“Minions don’t count, ferret.”
“I just wanted to say that- I’m- I’m sorry. For everything. I know apologies don’t just make things better, but I at least wanted you to know that I am sorry. For everything. For our home, for my parents, for the way I treated you. I’m sorry for all of it.”
Harry’s love-filled high lasted until he reached the kitchen.
“Elves…?” Harry sighed.
Harry nodded through his growing blush. Why was this becoming a habit?
“You clean up well, all things considered,” the blonde hummed, his eyes roaming over Harry’s attire, his eyes sparkling and his small smile turning to one of glee and delight when he noticed the… adjustments Harry had made. “I thought about sending you a comb but I thought it a hopeless endeavour.”
“Right,” Harry laughed, “that was definitely the point I was making.” Harry leaned over to hiss the blonde’s temple, “Now come on. I do not need Dudley getting lost in Wizarding London. He’ll lose an appendage or two and probably never get it back again.”
“What can I do for you, Malfoy?”
The first time he had ever met him, and not… well, he couldn’t say he didn’t want to punch him, because that would be a lie. And he couldn’t say he didn’t call him names, because how do you just stop calling someone a prat so suddenly, right?
“Well, thank you. We hope to see its approval before the end of next year, although given the push back by the traditionalists we are struggling to find support amongst the older families.”
At least a month had passed before the next one appeared.
“And what was with… Tab- Tibby! What on earth was that about? Since when was I a young master of the Malfoy Manor? Mrs. Malfoy, what is going on?”
The ties were also supposedly tied based off how the tie owner tied it (How many times can you say tie in a sentence and still make sense?). Sometimes this caused major panic when a Ravenclaw’s or Slytherin’s - as an example - was not absolutely perfect and pristine. Draco’s was one such example. Six years. Six years and his ‘Soulmate’ still didn’t know how to tie his own tie. In the first years, he had just wanted to strangle them with it, but after a few years he liked having it consistent, that and the fact that watching cheerily - though he would never show it - while everyone around him suffered and acted miserable at the hands of poorly tied ties, was just so much fun. It was kind of hobby of his. The most miserable person changed yearly, though there were one or two Slytherin’s that were always enjoyably infuriated, and it just made Draco’s day.
“Please escort Mr. Potter to Draco’s room, and please prepare a room for the young master.”
--------------------------
“He- He called me here?” the raven choked out.
“It’s nice to see you as well, Dudley,” Harry said, a practiced but tight smile lining his features.
“Why did you tell me about my eyes?” Harry asked at last, and then shook his head before continuing. “Or about yours for that matter?”
“Then he will fade away gradually, but it won’t be long now. He will go in peace, Mr. Potter,” the lady said, turning to leave, her eyes dull but resigned.
“I did and there is little nothing that can be done about that now, technically.”
“But that was months ago,” he said, and despite the interruption, again, the doctor waited patiently for Draco’s thought process to run its course. Horror finally claimed his features, his hands moving to cover his face. “No… All the sick leave, and quitting… how did I not notice?”
Their morning hadn’t gone quite to plan, obviously. And their strolling had been overruled by the need for food items and utensils, but it hadn’t managed to get in the way of the couples leisurely pace and enjoyment at simply being together. Not even a batch of burnt looking cookies could ruin their mood. Close, but not quite.
--------------------------
Still, it came as a surprise when several days later Dudley came late to breakfast, with news.
Enjoy. ;)
“But we aren’t even married? Does Draco not get a choice…?”
Eventually, he would just become one of the forgotten legends they taught in the History of Magic class, left to the memories of the people that truly cared about him.
Okay, in Harry’s defence, he didn’t actually know how he had ended up there. He might have assumed it was just one more drunken mistake, had it not been for the fact he had been sober since Hermione’s visit a week ago.
They had a
“And I made you regret it every day after.”
With a groan, he made to get up, but felt an arm cling around his waist.
It had been one minute since he had spoken to Fleur in the Weasley’s living room while they were together for Christmas.
“Oh, don’t be so dramatic. Treacle tarts are amazing.”
The next few days passed peacefully after that, each one starting to blur together in a strange sort of routine. Dudley took calls from one of the studies as he tried to arrange his new living quarters and work, while Harry and Draco went to work. They came home around seven, and ate dinner together discussing stories from their childhood, and what had happened at work, though of course the information was limited, given Harry and Draco’s high positions in the ministry and higher access to information.
“Yes. Yes!
It had been one hundred and sixty-three days, nineteen hours, and seven minutes, since he had last spoken to Draco. It had been one hundred and sixty-three days, nineteen hours, and seven minutes since he had declined whatever olive branch Draco was offering.
brought me.”
At four o’clock they crept down to the common room to play board games. There were already three people reading on a couple of the lounges. The two boys played a round of chess, but Harry was terrible. So, they switched UNO not long thereafter.
“Next Wednesday. Five days,” she said at last. “They… didn’t want to leave it too late.”
“Clearly,” he drawled, sitting down across from Harry.
-----------------------------------------------
“Mitsy, I need you to give my cousin a hand please. He isn’t accustomed to magic. Provide him with guest access.”
-------------------------
There was a cool breeze running through the corridors the morning of September first. Harry couldn’t have explained the castle’s magic, or explain why there was a breeze, inside. But he knew the castle was excited for the new year, and all the students that would fill its halls.
“Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?” he asked, turning back to their mugs.
“You know…” Harry murmured into Draco’s hair as they separated, “we should probably talk about this. That isn’t to say that I don’t love kissing you, but I would like to know what we are now.”
Okay, fine. That last one was a lie. He was dying to be near his Soulmate, but he couldn’t afford to put him an any more danger than he already was. He would do anything to protect the boy, even distance himself.
Maybe the fame got old.
------------------------------------------------------
. His head hurt so bad. He felt like someone had just scooped out his brain and sewn him back up. And… what had happened to his leg?
“I understand. Me too,” Remus relaxed the muffling charm and they sat back in silence while Harry and Sirius were none the wiser.
“Of course,” Remus smiled.
“He doesn’t hold that against you, Draco. You couldn’t have known.”
Yes, Harry has broad shoulders, Draco thinks to himself as they dress for work, but he shouldn’t have had to carry the weight of the wizarding world on them.
Sirius pulled Remus close, they waved, and with a pop they were gone. Harry and Draco stood still for a moment, letting the quiet wash over them for a bit before letting each other go and heading inside.
“Yeah,” Harry smiled at him again, “just... thinking.” He stepped between Draco’s knees and leaned his head onto his chest with his arms loosely around his middle.
Yes, Harry is kind, Draco thinks when they see Sirius and Remus at the beach, but he shouldn’t have had to endure any of it.
“Do you know anything else? About what they did?”
“Not until much much later. Remember how I told you I was holed up in Wales?” Draco nods, “I cut myself off from most of the wizarding world because of what I am. No one would have told me anything anyway.”
“Everything,” he thinks for a moment, “I want to take all his pain away, put it on myself instead. But I can’t and it makes me so angry I see red sometimes. Those fucking Muggles and that damn cupboard and fucking Dumbledore.”
Draco pours both of them a glass and sits himself on the counter, “How was your day?”
“You know you can talk to me about anything,” Remus says one night after dinner, “I’m always here.”
After he came home from work the next day, Harry sat onto the floor next to where Draco was sitting in his chair, “Do you really want to see it?”
Draco Malfoy was angry.
Harry was silent after that, going through the motions of making the curry and setting it up to cook on its own. Draco watched him work, how he flowed seamlessly from one task to the  next, cleaning as he went and sipping his wine occasionally. It seemed almost mechanical, like he was on auto-pilot as he cooked.
Of course he knew, Draco thought to himself, if anyone was going to notice a bit of magic it would be Harry.
“Yes. Have you ever seen it?”
“This is it,” Harry smiled sadly at the door on his right, “you can go in.”
Harry smiled and went back to cooking, “It’s alright, really. Can you get plates and such out, please?”
Harry turns on the machine to create a paste, “What did you talk about?”
“Yeah.”
Harry comes home from work and drops his bag by the door, “Draco?”
“I was wondering if my...” he paused, looking at Draco, “partner and I could come by this weekend? Just to grab the last of my things I left.”
“Yesterday, that house is...” Harry shivered.
“It’s alright,” Harry replied, pulling away to finish dinner.
“Only that they treated him terribly. When he came and stayed with us, he would wake up extremely early and make breakfast for us,” Remus laughed, “It made Kreature even grouchier, if you can believe it. But he would make food then... disappear into the house for a bit. I still don’t know if he ate any of what he made. And he was... scared, I think, of Sirius especially. Like if he wasn’t either a perfect child or a carbon copy of James that he wouldn’t love him. Over time he got better but the first months were hard,” Draco nodded again, not trusting his voice to stay together, “I know I sound like a broken record, but he doesn’t hold grudges. He’d tell you if he was upset with you. He’s like his mom in that way.”
Yes, Harry is happy now, Draco thinks as he climbs into bed and pulls him close, but he hasn’t always been.
“Everything,” Harry pressed himself into Draco’s personal space and kissed him gently.
“Thank you for coming,” Draco said politely, smiling at Sirius.
Before he could get far, Draco grabbed his write and pulled him close, kissing him quickly, “I’m still sorry.”
Draco rose, “They sound lovely.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco muttered into his hair, “we didn’t have to go.”
Draco thinks for a moment, “It was good. Got a lot done. Remus came by again.”
“I never really picked you as my Soulmate,” he paused, and Draco swore it was the most uncomfortable pause ever in the history of pauses, as he braced himself for the oncoming rejection, “mostly because I thought you hated me, but I have always loved your eyes. I loved the way the bursts of starlight become lightening when you are agitated. I guess… I just thought that to someone else, those bursts of lightening and starlight might have had a colour, a colour I could never have the privilege to see. But when you locked eyes with me, your parents’ voices questioning you in the background, I knew. I knew it had to be you.”
A knock sounded at the door and before a second had passed he was shouldering on his coat and out the door.
Harry just laughed at the admitted knowledge, and minor stalking, and gave Draco a peck on the cheek.
What had he done?
“No.”
“Oh, well, that’s very convincing. You were brought against your will by magic, to be the self-sacrificing idiot you are because you can’t just walk away. Not from anyone. Oh,
Relief efforts were being made in the dining hall, as it was the largest open space. The wounded had all been brought there after Voldemort was defeated and between Madam Pomfrey, and the able-bodied, they were trying to get them all patched up. Not everyone could be patched.
It was kind of hard not to stare. Apart from well, the obvious red hair, what drew Harry’s attention were the wings. They were shaking, or fluttering, or… something. They looked agitated, and honestly it was kind of adorable seeing them flutter behind Malfoy of their own devices regardless of whatever Malfoy was actually here for. It ruined the whole ‘murderous glare’ thing completely.
Given that Harry owled him a week later to ask when he wanted to meet up again for dinner, he suspected one of the latter two.
------------------------------------
---------------------------
“Guess what today is?”
The witch half sighed half huffed once more before Harry felt the young which get up to leave, pausing briefly at the doorway. He heard the Floo not a moment later, telling him she had left, and that once again, he was all alone.
“Narcissa said it was a part of your Veela side so that you don’t make the choice about the bond on your own.”
“Who’s organising it?”
“Oh, right. Madame Pomfrey said these were for you,” the boy whispered handing Draco three vials. He downed them, and then looked up to see the boy smiling at him.
“What’s up? What’s
He look like a charred snake or something, is what Harry would have liked to say if it wasn’t for the fact that it fit Malfoy so perfectly.
He sighed.
That had gone much better than expected.
He had come to enjoy their little meetings.
“Yeah I know. I just wanted to anyway.”
started the ‘overdue’ conversation. Confusion, evident on the oblivious man’s face.
Draco just tilted his head, getting increasingly frustrated with this conversation. This had been a terrible idea.
Harry was escorted around the crowds exchanging greetings here and there, with Malfoy talking most of the politics. Harry was glad honestly. The only thing he hated more than the stuffy stuck-up Galas were the conversations on politics.
“How is he today?” questioned a soft voice, snapping the raven out of his contemplations.
“Truly, an unfortunate circumstance. Perhaps I could offer out my services in that regard-”
It didn’t make sense. He had watched it countless times. It didn’t seem to matter who. Even Minerva herself had been caught on occasion and he knew she would never wish ill of Draco.
“So eager to escape are we, Potter?” Draco drawled, having noticed Harry’s longing glance towards the windows. Harry sighed.
But, Draco’s face was… faltering?
By the end of first term their weekly appointments, had become daily. They still didn’t talk, but they exchanged glances and nods. Their communication was minimal, but rather effective. It had gotten to the point that Draco was certain he could tell the other boy’s mood, and the amount of sleep he had gotten - usually not much - based only off the way he looked.
“Even before I realised I was a wizard I probably had more friends than you.”
Draco had grown. A lot. And if you asked Harry, it wasn’t fair at all. Harry stood at all of 5’5 whereas the prat had somehow managed 6, maybe 6’2. It was ridiculous.
Despites Draco’s begrudging they arrived early and watched the train come into the station. Harry waited anxiously for his cousin - on a number of levels - with Draco anxiously watching him. Several minutes passed, and just as Harry was starting to really freak out and was imagining the screaming match from his aunt and uncle, a nudge broke Harry out of his reverie and he looked up to see Dudley walking towards the two of them.
“-are stuck to their rectangles-”
------------------------------
“No, I just…” Draco watched, transfixed as the raven-haired boy struggled for the right words. Draco turned to stare out into the distance again. “Why didn’t you tell me?” The words were almost incoherent.
“That will be all thank you Tibby, I will take it from here,” an elegant voice said from the staircase. Harry watched as none other than Narcissa Malfoy floated down the stairs towards him. Not… impressed by his arrival, but insisting on his immediate removal either, which was… confusing, to say the very least.
Harry had always hated going the Ministry functions. Unfortunately, he was more or less obligated, but the blonde didn’t seem to mind. He actually looked like he was in his element.
“Potter.”
He supposed since Christmas but he couldn’t be sure. He wasn’t sure about much really. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t get what Fleur had said out of his head.
It took a week for Harry not leaving his house for Hermione to appear. Harry recalled she had just been roped into some ministry and muggle convention or something of the like - magical creatures maybe - and had had her hands full with that, not to mention Rose.
“Right so, why not… stop and rest for a bit. You know, I’m feeling a little tired,” the blond pouted.
“No, Draco. Okay, no. Enough. I can’t do this right now,” interrupted, pushing past the blonde, barely grazing against the soft feathery wings.
For the life of him, what was left of it at least, Harry couldn’t seem to find a way out of whatever rut he had fallen into. He stayed at home mostly, first on sick-leave, then on annual leave, and then when that ran out, he quit altogether.
A sound interrupted Draco’s depressing train of thought though, and there he was. He was as messy-haired and as defiantly green-eyed as the day he first met him. Without a second thought - not thinking, brilliant, he was becoming more like the mop-head every day - he called out to Harry and tossed him his wand. He probably should have done some thinking, because now he was wandless, in the middle of a war, surrounded by people that wanted to kill him.
In the four months since the three had become colleagues, they had started speaking on more than friendly talks, often having breaks together or just generally catching up. But for the life of him he couldn’t figure out why every time he asked Harry out for a walk in the park during their lunch break - it was the closest place that was peaceful, and rather beautiful, and you could walk there and back in a break - he turned pale and stuttered a refusal.
“Maybe he simply wished to say goodbye,” was all she said.
Draco came in the next morning, walking on air, to find the two dandelions on the windowsill.
“If my hair is ever smoothed out, assume I’m kidnapped.”
Draco was going out of his mind.
“Not much. I asked Fleur, at Christmas, and she told me I was an idiot, among other things. But I thought- I thought he was already dead.”
“I heard that you used to talk about me so much everyone in your dorm got sick of it and I became a banned a topic in Slytherin,” Harry returned, his voice cracking every so often as it recovered from his embarrassment.
The sky had turned dark, and there was a cold breeze blowing through the Astronomy Tower. It was a comforting darkness though. It was a darkness filled with stars and the occasional cloud, not a darkness of a dungeon or a Dark Lord. It was a soft darkness. Gentle even.
“Wait, you thought-” Harry snorted, trying to bite his tongue, “-we were roommates?”
It didn’t matter.
Little to nothing changed.
“I, yeah. Fine. What harm could it do at this point?” he sighed.
“I came to see what on earth you thought you were doing, messing with my head these last few days. I always knew were a git, but-”
Several minutes passed like that, a silence between them as they each contemplated what it meant for them in future.
“Shall we?”
Draco opened it - as fast as possible, while making sure not to tear anything - and felt his heart stop.
“I’m- I’m not really sure Mrs. Malfoy.”
“What do you want, Granger?” was all he managed. There were so many snide remarks he could have included but somehow, he couldn’t manage them today. She took a deep breath.
He, with no children left to guide, and no family to find, disappeared down a hallway, out of the way and invisible. He considered offering Madam Pomfrey assistance, but he didn’t think he had a lot of fans at that moment, considering everything.
The Aurors had recently heard increased movements of a Dark Uprising. Voldemort wannabes more or less.
They were sitting in the garden for breakfast for a change. A gentled breeze blew around them, a choir of birds singing softly in the treetops. The roses were blooming, though he could have sworn the whole year round. He thought he recalled though, from one of their morning talks that the colours changed depending on the season.
He reached for it, slowly at first, as though it would hurt him, and then grabbed it. She nodded, before gathering herself and walking away, and leaving him to his own thoughts. Leaving him to the contents of the letters.
He pulled it from the shelf and started to flip through it as he walked back to his place beside the blonde’s bed, settling himself to read aloud.
That’s how Draco knew he was in trouble. He had grey eyes. They were different shade, but they were still grey. There was no striking colour to lure his soulmate to him, like his mother supposedly had. It was just grey, the same grey, unless inspected closer.
“Perhaps not intentionally. But he can’t help it at this stage.”
1. They were dead.
“I never said it was, but if you like we can arrange that for another time,” he said, smiling as Harry blushed. “I take it that’s a yes then?” to which Harry could only nod. “I’ll pick you up at seven then.”
“Uh, y- young master? I wasn’t aware-”
The golden Dandelions kept permanently under a Statis charm in a water vase on his desk. Their petals as soft and delicate as they day they each arrived.
The year eight students had their own separate tower. The tower had a strong silencing charm, and… they used it. There were two people per room.  Harry and Hermione shared a room and Ron and Draco where together in another. They ignored said arrangement frequently.
“I kid you not. My great uncle even had his elves walk his pet mice. Slowly. Very slowly, so that they didn’t ‘get tired’,” he snorted, emphasising his sentence with airquotes.
“Not far really, but we didn’t plan on walking. I- I thought we might just… teleport? Portal? If you don’t mind.”
“Harry, there is another Ministry Gala coming up in a week, and I was wondering if you would like to go with me? They are hosting the semi-annual fundraiser for the war-orphans. And…”
The soft golden petals glinting in the light morning sun on the kitchen windowsill, its arrival barely making a creak as Draco bustled around making himself a quick breakfast. The blonde was muttering something as he cooked, presumably notes or potion ingredients.
It was getting out of hand.
Harry had heard that Malfoy had become a Veela some time ago. He didn’t read the papers anymore, but Hermione and Ron kept him informed on anything he might want to know that wasn’t purely gossip. He hadn’t given it much thought at the time, but there they were, long and white and gleaming.
It didn’t matter though. The joy radiating off Draco was more than worth a lifetime of physical malfunctions, as long as he didn’t manage to mess this up. He almost groaned, but stopped himself when he realised Draco might take that the wrong way, given the moment…
“And cookies!” Dudley added, his face lighting up.
“Do you want to start with friends, and see how we go?”
They were so green.
Reaching the grave itself, he gently placed his own bouquet.
But they were getting there. They were alive. And, so long as they stayed that way, they would find a way to make it through.
By the time the next one turned up, Draco had a visited a series of libraries collecting books on botany. He had searched through the Wizarding Archives but found very little, and instead resorted to looking through the Muggle ones.
“No. NO! Draco, never. That’s not the issue,” he said, concern written plainly on his face. He hadn’t realised Draco had taken it that way.
One hundred and sixty-three days…
He took a breath, sighed once and then went to find Draco, collecting his wand from his bedside as he walked out.
Wintergreen and Lime.
“Prat.”
Thankfully, before Hermione was able to press, Draco chose that exact moment to return with their drinks.
He didn’t say anything, and Draco didn’t press. He wasn’t certain why the boy was here, but he wouldn’t be the one to initiate conversation. He wasn’t the one that approached the other man, and he didn’t have anything to say. That didn’t seem to be an issue though.
“Oh, I’m sorry. She must have forgotten. I’m being transferred for work, temporarily at this stage, and I need a place to stay for a few days, maybe a week, while the previous tenants move out of my soon-to-be apartment.”
“You know Ron, I am almost certain that if you asked - and I do mean ask, not beg - the elves would be happy to make you something different,” Hermione said at last, raising an eyebrow. It was the only thing she raised, her head was still stuck in her book as she spoke.
He absently noted Granger nodding in the background. The Weasley was pressing his lips into a thin line, but it seemed closer to consideration than objection. Luna, just looked like… well, Luna. Always off following her own train of thought, observing the world around her in a way that others couldn’t. He sometimes wondered what it would be like to be Luna, to be in her head. But, the thought never stayed long.
Made them real.
“I’m afraid …” Harry mumbled, so quietly Draco barely caught the first words.
“Sure they are, Harry. So, let me get this straight,” he said clutching his middle in an attempt to contain his glee, “you fought and defeated a Dark Lord and his followers, and came back from the dead, and that’s fine. You have since been finding and capturing the remainders of those followers, and just fighting horrible people, and that’s fine too. But a duck, scares you senseless?” he asked, his laughter almost choking him.
“Hey Draco?”
“There’s a lake at the park.” He raised his eyebrows.
“It was too close…” Harry thought he heard Draco mutter, but he made no further comment, and just continued to scan Harry for signs of injury. Apparently finding none, he breathed a sigh of relief.
“Alright that was the last one. The last switch is done. I do not want to see another switch for as long as I live.”
“Dually noted,” Draco grinned and left, taking down the silencing charms as he went. That conversation had been rather fruitful.
They were alone.
Draco started, turning around at the sound of a shout. His eyes were swollen. Absently, he noted the salt-water running over his lips. He didn’t have much time to consider it though.
“Lady Malfoy-”
“Yes Mr. Potter?”
conscious Draco asked, raising a petite brow.
--------------------------
“So…”
“I don’t… I don’t think it is.” He knew his voice was cracking he just hoped it wouldn’t betray him too much. There was no way could hand over his mate to the dark lord. He would sacrifice himself first if need be. He really hoped it wouldn’t come to that though.
The first thing Draco noticed was the sound of footsteps. He stiffened automatically, his breath halting for a moment, but the footsteps only came closer, and then were accompanied but the sound of a chair scrapping on the stone floor. He looked up from his textbook briefly, only to take pause at the sight before him.
“I, uh yeah. Okay. That’s… sure, Harry,” the boy relented, though he seemed a little opposed to the idea. Harry just watched him a moment longer before going to find his almost certainly pouting husband to take him shopping.
“I didn’t think- I was worried- I thought- You’re- You’re back-” the raven said, stumbling around his words as his face gradually fell, tears playing at the corners of his eyes, and a sad smile tugging at the edge of his lips. He lurched forward, enveloping the surprised blonde into a tight embrace. “I’m glad you’re back.”
-------------------------------
Harry was stressed.
Granger and Weasley were both sporting Gryffindor ties, and if you asked Draco, they were each others’ and frankly that made it rather boring. The Weaslette was wearing a blue tie.
“The fact that you have taste has nothing to do with this.”
Hermione and Ron had found solace in each other, George had returned to his family. Luna and Ginny had been spending more time together. Everyone had a someone.
“Then I think I want some space.”
He awoke, what he would assume was not long after, but he wasn’t really the best judge of time at that moment.
Harry barely heard the click of the door as someone entered. He didn’t know how long it had been. It could have been minutes, or hours, or even days. The constant darkness wasn’t helping his perception of time. He looked up from where he was seated beside the blonde’s bed, the same place he had been when Mrs. Malfoy left, and saw the small elf. Tibby.
“Merlin, you’re such a mess,” Draco said, starting to smile, as he pulled the blubbering raven into another hug.
------------
It was a shame he didn’t drink coffee. He really could have used one about then.
“You’re dead,” the voice said simply, with more conviction than Draco would have liked.
“It’s not that. I’m just imagining how irreparably damaged your image will be after this.”
“What… should I do to try and save him? To bring him back…?”
He reached forward to knock but the door opened before he had so much as touched it. An elf was standing on the other side of the door. They bowed once, before Harry could say anything.
Harry was in the process spooning extra sugar into his husbands mug of coffee, as Draco warmed a treacle tart for the raven when Dudley burst into the kitchen, two wands swiftly pointed in his direction. But after a second Harry breathed a sigh of relief and lowered his.
“Good morning, Malfoy,” he smiled, as the man took up his place beside Harry at the end of the great hall for breakfast.
The bar was quieter than Harry had expected. Although he supposed that wasn’t unusual seeing as he had made plans for Sunday evening, and most drinking parties got together on Fridays or Saturdays.
Malfoy had simply stormed into his office one day, eyes flaming, hair bright red, and had started spouting some nonsense about being ‘unprofessional’ and ‘uncouth’ and ‘an utter git’. He had just stared blankly.
“The curse has been removed, but there are some side effects. Since he had it so long, some of the depression will no longer be fictional,” the doctor concluded, as Draco slumped down into one of the chairs.
Narcissa straightened at that. The words surprising her, as her hand halted on the door knob. She took a breath.
Until such a time as he was able to smile and stroke their petals as a new one arrived instead of throwing a grim sort of smile towards the window before spelling it into a jar as he hurried into his Healer robes, ready to receive the injured Aurors that had just apparated in after another mission. Some better off than others.
“I’m sorry, really,” he said glancing at the blonde that had only raised his eyebrows, instead of lowering his wand, “but I just want to let you know… they’re ready for me to move in! The renovations are
“-all the time anyway.” Harry raised an eyebrow at the blonde, but relented.
“We’re going to be okay, Harry. It’s just one week.”
Harry felt rather than saw Draco enter the room. The soft footsteps from behind him slowed to a stop, and he felt the appalled silence. Oddly enough, Draco had become the cook of their household, and Dudley had just lain waste to… pretty much all of it. Not a single utensil laid untouched. He looped an arm around the blonde’s waste, whispering in his ear.
“And so it shall be,” the blond replied smoothly, his smile still in place. He listened as the footsteps trudged back up the stairs. It felt like it took all day, but after a while he heard the upstairs door close. He breathed a sigh of relief.
“No. Day off. Extra.”
“I guessed.”
Not that he was counting of course.
“Of course,” she said, eyeing him warily. “Be well Harry.”
Yeah, they were going to get on just fine.
“It’s none of your concern, Hermione. Go fix someone else’s problems. I’d tell you to fix your own but we all know that’s not happening.”
“What’s Mr. Malfoy, Draco, here for?” Harry waited, tilting his head, to see if there was any elaboration, but none came.
Barely a moment had passed before the last attacker had fallen, most clutching some part of themselves, all of them unconscious.
It was near identical to the last.
There was nothing extraordinary about the flower. He ran a series of detection spells on it but it carried no magic. It was entirely harmless and insignificant. Finding it thusly, he left it, resolving to continue his work. He had several more potions to perfect and tests to pass before becoming a Healer. He couldn’t afford to become distracted.
--------------------------
Harry… was… no. There was no way.
“I spoke to your mother today,” he began, not really sure where he was going with this, as he rested the book on his knee. “No surprise there. I just didn’t expect- I just didn’t expect all this to be so permanent Draco. I didn’t think about… I don’t know. Being a Malfoy, or the estate, or any of it. I never really thought about it. I have never worried about finances, and even if I wanted all this... I don’t know how to manage it Draco. It just seems very… permanent.”
Or perhaps a nightmare.
“Love you too. Now are we going out this morning or what?” he asked, grin still in place.
One hundred and sixty-three days, nineteen hours, and seven minutes.
“Well, I just- Not to be rude or anything - but he is always here so I thought he must have lived here, and you’re awfully close for roommates, and… You know- you can tell, I won’t tell a soul, I swear! But… is he like… a secret lover or something…?”
“Merlin you’re such a prat, Malfoy,” the raven sniffled, rubbing his arm under his nose. “Couldn’t even give me ten minutes to enjoy the fact that you’re alive.”
---------------------------
---------------------------------------
Harry followed the elf absently up at least one flight of stairs, maybe two, before they wound their way round a series of corners he could never do in reverse, and stopped before a door.
“He never really stood a chance against us - the boys who couldn’t even get their love lives straight for six years,” Draco said smirking, and received a light punch to the shoulder for his comment.
Hello lovely readers,
“Doesn’t change the fact that he was an arse.”
He hoped it conveyed all the emotions he was unable to say, and from the way Harry pushing back against him he figured the message was getting across. He could always kiss him again if he missed anything…
“Yes, but-”
“What, who are you? What do mean ‘get out’?” he replied, sounding less certain than he would have liked.
“Draco!” Harry called, summoning the blonde into the room, almost in hysterics, “He thought- Dudley- he thought you were my secret lover!” He said tears streaming down his face from laughter. Draco just stared for a moment before responding.
“Please, Harry, just call me Narcissa. You’ve been here long enough.”
Harry wasn’t sure what he aimed to achieve by coming here. He wasn’t even sure how he was here let alone why he was here. He briefly considered turning around and going home, but the gates opened up before up him, without so much as a squeak. Which, should have just meant they were well looked after but it only made the dimly-lit area more ominous.
He woke up in one of the cots in the infirmary, the letter beside him. It wasn’t a dream then. It was real. He didn’t think he had ever hated reality this much. Never wished for nightmares so badly, over whatever it was he was facing now. A single letter had sucked the warmth out of him, leaving him empty and cold. Goosebumps and shivers trailed along his arms. The castle was supposed to have charms to keep everything the perfect temperature, but Draco just couldn’t feel it. He couldn’t feel anything anymore. He was just so cold.
“And if I don’t save him?”
“Well, it’s not as though I go up on to the third floor where your rooms are… but you are always quite friendly with each other, and-
------------------------
“That sounds very un-Malfoy like.”
There was a deatheater article there.
“Wait, no. I can’t be here. I need to be on earth. Harry… He’s fighting Voldemort. I need to get back.”
Diagon Alley was more alive then Draco had seen it in years, it was noisy and crowded and Draco loved it.
“Hello, Hogwarts too ?” Draco spoke when Potter stood on the stool next to him.
He wasn’t really watching, his eyes focused if Hermione, making sure she was fine and was safe. Potter had used his wand in some way and Weasley had knocked the troll unconscious, before he knew it he was hugging Hermione so tightly.
He nodded.
Summer went slowly for Draco and he was so glad for it. He hardly saw his father which was a blessing, Draco didn’t thinking he could handle properly seeing him. He saw him at breakfast and dinner some days or he would see him sitting in his study but Draco would never really see him, he wouldn’t really talk to him either. The last conversation Draco had had with his father in the future was not a pleasant one, his mother cried behind him. He didn’t want to remember that day, not yet at least. For now Draco was happy relaxing in the summer heat, the smell of grass on his fingers and mud in his hair.
“What no explanation Potter. Just expect me to drop everything because the boy-who-lived has asked me to?”
“I’m sorry. I, well, I didn’t catch your name.”
‘You are certainly wise, all those years, fighting that war. Very very wise.’
And that’s when Dobby started to punish himself, hitting his own head over and over. Draco had nearly forgotten house leaves punished themselves so violently.
Draco’s mind stalled a second before it started working again, he wasn’t sure yet if he wanted anyone to find out about his time travel - surely they would want to lock him up, he could be locked up anymore, he just wanted to be eleven and try to help save some life’s.
So try me on and I will tell you
“I want you to explain to me where you learnt that spell.” Severus spoke sternly.
“What ? No.” Potter returned, looking almost hurt at the suggestion.
“Which bathroom?”
He entered the train for the opposite side than usual and made his way into the first compartment, he drew the blinds and rested his head against the window. He was breathing heavily and trying so hard not to cry. To busy the tears he opened a journal he had been clutching to. He asked his mother for it earlier in the summer and had begun writing what he remembered from his first time, what he remembered from all his time in Hogwarts. Important things like the troll at Halloween and trivalent things like Longbottom’s exploding cauldron in their first potions class.
When Draco sat down he finally had chance to glance at the professors table. First he saw his godfather, the man who deserved so much better in life and death. The man who’s death had broken his heart the hardest during the war. He looked as he always had, annoyed, greasy and down right miserable, god he really had missed his godfather. Missed his sarcastic comments and his crooked nose, he missed the way Severus could be so caring in the secret, the way he looked out for Draco when no one else would. Missed the way he stood up to Lucius. And here he was alive.
Those cunning folks use any means
“Are you excited?” He said.
“Potter, you’re rambling.”
“That’s you all done.” Madam Mulkin spoke to Draco. “If you could just come down. I see your mother is outside. You wait here while she pays.”
He was getting too close to the trio, to Potter, he wanted to make change but he didn’t necessarily want to spend time with the boy-who-lived. Potter was insufferable even as an eleven year old, although he wasn’t exactly as Draco remembered, he was still unbelievably brash and he never thought before he took action.
The one thing Draco never let himself think about was his time in Azkaban, he had only been there for two months but even that was too many. It had been one of the worst experiences of his life, and that was saying something. Draco had gone through torture and assault, cursed by his own father and family, been deluded enough to take the dark mark and had had a mass murder live in his house. Draco knew that he had been a horrible, slimy git and deserved everything he had done to him. His time at Hogwarts had been ruled by jealousy and hatred towards himself and others, his time at him had been ruled by manipulation and sneering from his father.
Why was he reliving it all ?
“Yes father.”
“No. Of course not, I was trying to stop them from breaking the rules. Ron wanted to practise magic in the trophy room, I was trying to stop them.” Hermione whispers, not taking her gaze off Draco the entire time.
No, no, no. Slytherin please.
“I just - I just meant that you’re kind and I thought we were friends and you’re cool. Like really cool, amazing at magic as-well, amazing at potions.”
“Oh my sweet dragon. It is fine, will you be well enough for Diagon Alley today ? We need to purchase your supplies for Hogwarts. We don’t want to leave it to late.”
“Because you’re my friend.” Draco mumbled in reply, “you.”
“It was nothing, really. I am very glad I was there, couldn’t let someone as talented as you die now could we” He stats, looking at the bushy haired girl. He thinks being kinder to Hermione, perhaps being her friends couldn’t change too much. He wants to be selfish this once, so he says it. Says she’s talented, because she is, because it could be a good place to start.
‘Well well well you are a tricky one Mr Malfoy.’
“Well yes, do you really like Hermione? I mean no, sorry that doesn’t matter. I-I, well the reason I wanted to talk to you was to ask for help since well you’re the smartest in our year really, and well, we need to tell you something. So please just meet us in the library after classes.” Potter said, looking up at the taller boy, Draco was only perhaps an inch taller but in his mind it made all the difference.
“So you do like her!” Weasley yelped.
“What ?”
Asking Potter to be his friend was Draco’s first real rebellion from his fathers rules. He had been told stories of the boy-who-lived throughout childhood and so wanted to be his friend, when he was rejected it stung. He hadn’t wanted to try and rebel for some time after, his father was right about Potter so surely he was right about other things.
“Us three.” Potter gestures between the trio.
“Which floor you idiot!” He yelled.
I'll eat myself if you can find
“I will meet you outside the shop, so do not leave the shop until you see me outside. Is that understood ?”
“Of course.” Potter smiles. “And then we can figure out who would want it. Merlin, Draco, you really are a genius.”
“It is.” He mumbled.
Time went quick while reading and writing for Draco, he didn’t notice his compartment door opening until a voice snapped him from his journal.
“We will be taking you by floo an hour before the train is set to leave, your mother and I will see you off. Is that understood ?”
“What re the other two ?” Potter looked interested now. This definitely hadn’t happened before.
During the walk towards the front of the hall heard Weasley muttering about wrestling a troll when the boy was interrupted by the Sorting hat and the god awful song it sung.
Why was he afforded this second chance ?
He would be able to get through it.
Sometimes it felt like his scar was still there, that when people looked at him it was all they could see.
“Mr Malfoy, welcome. Let’s see, let’s see. Now your mother’s wand is an 11”, Blackthorn, unicorn hair. I wonder, I wonder. And your father of course...” the old mans voice trailed off as he descended further into the shop, he was scanning boxes and then reaching up and then. Then. There it was. In Ollivanders hands. His wand. His wand.
Draco stepped down and hesitantly faced Potter. When he saw potter was smiling with a crooked grin he smiled back.
He really had missed him.
“So is it true, have you got the-“ he gestured towards his forehead.
He was trying his best to monitor the situation, but he had more pressing matters to attend.
First he heard the doors slamming open, and then the professor screaming, yelling  about the troll. Then he heard children screaming and panicking, everyone standing - scared. Then he heard Dumbeldore declare everyone should return to their dorms. But then. Then something different happened.
“Well. Well, I set his robes on fire.” Hermione admitted.
“Hello my little dragon.” She said, walking across his bedroom floor into his bathroom. “Are you okay? Your father and I have been waiting for you at breakfast.”
“Oh yeah.” Potter said, lifting his fringe showing off the pink scar.
And don't get in a flap!
The welcome chill of November continued until the opening match of the season. Potter’s first quidditch game. Draco somewhat remembered the event, he had jotted down in a notebook when he first woke up in the past. His hand writing scribbled about Gryffindor winning the match after the boy had caught the snitch - Draco remembered being sure that if he was deemed for Slytherin there would be no way Gryffindor would have won that match. His notebook was detailed with every little event that Draco could remember, he had seven different books for each year at Hogwarts and would carry his frost year one with him. At time he would suddenly remember a detail that happened, and event that had occurred and rushed to fill in the pages.
This was good. Walking into the great hall with Crabbe and Goyle by his side. He kept making glances toward Crabbe during the time, but he was determined not to freak out. He couldn’t start crying, not here not when he was at Hogwarts.
“It’s not that I don’t want to-“ he shouldn’t have said that, he was only saying it so Potter would stop looking so devastated.
“And you saw Harry’s broom.”
“What spell?” He replied, trying his hardest to take a sense of true eleven year old innocence.
“Excuse me, are you really Harry Potter ?” The ginger asked.
They were only sitting together for a matter of minutes until the compartment door opened again. Potter had been rambling about how amazing the magical world seemed when Weasley stepped through the door.
He still wanted to understand what had happened to him, if this was real he had time traveled, he didn’t even mean to. Sure this was a wizarding first - time turners could do this sort of magic, he didn’t know if any speeds or curses that did this, all he knew was one day he went to sleep and he was nine teen and then he was eleven. Apart of him missed being nineteen, missed his terrible flat and horrible lifestyle, he missed his muggle neighbours and their pets. He missed being old enough to do what he wanted, Hogwarts was his home but he hated being told what to do, he spent years being manipulated by his father, by death eaters and by that man but then he had freedom and it was hard to just go back to his eleven year old self. He had been trying to figure out a way to get into the restricted area in the library, it frustrated him that he still hadn’t found out a solution he really didn’t want a detention.
His heart pounded and his hands went straight up to grip his face. He wasn’t him anymore. He wasn’t nineteen anymore. His hair wasn’t past his shoulders, it wasn’t near as long and he didn’t have that god awful scar that started on his neck and moved to his chin, the scar that Potter had left him. He traced his fingers across his face, touching the shadow of where that scar sat. The scar that he hated so much, the scar that made him cry so many nights. Draco moved his hand down his chin and then onto his neck. He breathed. In and out. Then he made it to his forearm and looked down. It was gone. Oh. It was finally gone. The mark that he had tried to burn off, tried to cut off. It was finally gone, and left was his smooth pail skin. His skin felt so soft beneath his touch. So young.
Draco was aware that Professor Quirrell should be monitored closely, closer than other professors. But he wasn’t doing anything abnormal, as the days in November began to fewer, nothing was out of the ordinary.
“Who in merlin’s name are you talking about ?”
Draco supposed this made sense, Potter had always favoured loyalty - while Draco would protect those he cared for fearlessly- he wasn’t one to just be loyal, he had to care about the person or understand how his loyalty towards that person would benefit him. Making certain changes this time round would not be easier because if Potter. He wanted to save Slytherin, wanted to save Vincent and Severus. His mother. He didn’t want to be scared. Potter couldn’t help him.
As they sat Greg spoke up again. “It’s just, well we’ve hardly seen you. We don’t know what we’ve done wrong really.”
“Blimey.” Weasley muttered.
His fathers study was bigger then his had ever been. At nineteen Draco had been able to purchase a small flat on the outskirts of muggle London. His flat had a small bedroom and a small study. His fathers study was large and gracious and it so suited Lucius. It had so many books, books that he was never allowed to touch as a child, books that he had seen burnt when he was seventeen. When he - That man wanted to punish Lucius. He had used crucio against him and the burnt his belongings and his father had screamed so loudly, it rang in Draco’s ears for minutes after. And then later that same evening Lucius had used crucio against Draco. And Draco had screamed and cried and his father had apologised and swore he would never use that spell again. A week later Draco heard him using it against a muggle, and muggle who was lost and confused and kept beginning for her children. Draco cried listening to her screams. And his Aunt Bella had laughed.
Looking at Dobby now, in the past, age eleven Draco thought he would cry. He had treated Dobby so horribly, and last him had thought it was okay to treat him like that. His father had taught him to be like that, to be that cruel, but Lucius was wrong about a lot of things and he was certainly wrong about how Dobby should be treated. (How all house elves should be treated.) Although Draco didn’t know the full extent of things he did know that Dobby was brave and that Dobby deserved more than Lucius Malfoy and more than Draco Malfoy.
“Why do you think it was guarding something?” Draco asks, moving his attention back to Potter.
“Yes. I’m sure you will.”
“Dobby.” He said. “I’m sorry.”
“Why did you help her ? I mean I’ve never seen you two together before ?” Weasley prodded.
Looking at the man now, he looked like he had before Bella had got to him. He looked mental and happy, and his eyes weren’t glazed over and he wasn’t crying. That was good Draco thought.
When the train finally came to a stop it felt like he had been on it for eternity, with Potter smiling and laughing all the way.
His father broke the silence the day before he was due to leave. Draco was in the library, trying to find some works on time travel to understand what exactly was going on when Dobby had called for him. His father was waiting for him in his study. Draco remembered the upcoming conversation from the first time round, he was told to always maintain the Malfoy name in public and to never let his guard done. He was also told that Harry Potter would be in his year and that he should stay far from him.
To achieve their ends.
“No.” Weasley spoke. He had been attempting to show Draco and Potter some magic. Draco himself was reluctant to show off, the spells he had performed over the summer had all been unusually powerful especially for an eleven year old.
“What. Did. I. Do.” Potter repeated.
“Potter you’re rambling.”
“Second- second floor.”
Professor McGonagall had began leading them into the Great Hall, it was even more beautiful then he remembered. The last time his eyes had seen it it had been destroyed, but now, in the past it was amazing.
“No Dobby you shouldn’t. And I can only apologise for my behaviour, you need to know that I am sorry. Do not hurt yourself because of me anymore. “ Draco pleaded. “I am glad you woke me, I am glad I am apologising and I would be glad if you accepted that apology, but of course you don’t have to.”
“I’ll think about it Potter, if that’s all I would quite like to end this conversation.” He said.
“Abbott, Hannah”
“Sit” Severus said when Draco entered the room, not wasting anytime- same old Severus Draco mused.
Potter lowered his voice and whispered “He hates me.”
The manor was bigger than he remembered, he supposed it was because he was eleven and shorter than ever. The last time he saw his childhood home the man was there and Draco was in pain. The last years Draco spent in the manor he was always in pain. His youth his home had been one of happy memories, of Pansy being chased by the peacocks and his mother humming in the morning. His later years in the manor had been nothing but pure dreadful pain, it wasn’t really his family home those last years . The man had take it over. The man had ruined it.
His friends would abandon him. Of course they would. He didn’t want new friends. He wanted Blaise who could make him laugh so easily, and Pansy who was the best hugger in the world. He wanted Crabbe and Goyle who were so so loyal, Crabbe who he had only just got back. He wanted Theo who was shy but so caring and -
“Tomorrow you’ll be going off to Hogwarts, Draco and shouldn’t have to tell you the importance of maintaining our name and upholding our beliefs. When you arrive you will meet and sit with purebloods only. You will uphold the Slytherin traditions throughout your time at the school and you will not fraternize with those who are below us. Do you understand?”
He didn’t know what to do, he hadn’t been here last time- if this had even happened the last time, he just needed Hermione to be safe and not to be killed by a stupid troll. He raised his wand and muttered ‘protego totalum’, he knew as soon as he had done it it was a mistake - he was meant to be eleven, his magical core wasn’t meant to be strong enough to create that sort of shield yet, he shouldn’t even know that speed but he didn’t care, Hermione was safe by his side and Weasley and Potter were fighting the troll.
“Yes father” He spoke softly.
“SLYTHERIN.”
“Oh- okay. Come on Ron. Hagrid’s just over there.” Potter mumbled while making steps away from him.
Some time into the train journey, after the three boys had stuffed themselves full of sweets from the trolley and Harry had cooed over the chocolate frog card of Dumbledore, there was a knock on the followed by a young Hermione Granger, her hair was bushy and her teeth were sticky out and Draco thought she looked amazing. Her eyes were younger than he had last seen them, these eyes didn’t go through the horrors of the manor.
It was when he would hear Hermione crying that he knew she was the bravest, most deserving witch he had ever encountered. He had been jealous of her in his younger years because of her brain. He had resented her when his father would smack his for coming second to her but hearing her cry he knew she was not to blame. His father was to blame, the man was to blame, the pureblood mindset was to blame.
Merlin, this had never happened before. He had spend all his time in the yearly years with these two, they were constantly together. It was only during third year he hard started to hang out with Pansy and Blaise more often, but their friendship had stayed strong. It was concerning to see this level of uncertainty in his friends face, he looked lost - the same way he had looked the months after Vince’s death. Greg at first had been angry and full of sorrow but then he was just lost.
He breathed in and out. God, he had forgotten how annoying speaking to the boy-who-lived could be.
The week went by slowly and uneventful as it did last time, memories replaying themselves in real time over and over again. He sat through Potter staring at him during meals, Longbottom melting his cauldron in potion’s lessons and Weasley being an downright idiot.
“Spit it out, Potter.”
He made his way to the same bed he had when he went through this the first time round,  not acknowledging the other boys words. He muttered a small goodnight to them and comes his was into his bed, closing the curtains behind him and spelling the securing shut, putting a silencing spell so no one could hear him from the outside. And then he finally cried the tears he had been holding in for so long, cried over Severus and Dumbledore, cried over the Weasley twin and Crabbe, cried because he was so scared he wouldn’t be able to change anything.
“What?” Draco questioned, caught off guard.
Hi guys, I wanted to thank everyone for the support again :) Also, I feel like this chapter took longer to get out then usual (sorry!), I started my summer job again - it’s full time and is absolutely draining :(
Weasley and Potter instantly started giggling, only Weasley continued after Draco shot them both a glare.
“Draco.” Hermione starts, “I just wanted to thank you, again. What you did was amazing, you’re so powerful it’s incredible really and you saved my life.”
“You has no need to be sorry sir, Dobby is sorry, sorry for waking you sir.” Dobby said, near frantically.
Or perhaps in Slytherin
“Y-yes.” Potter forced out.
He could perhaps, sit by Vince in the great hall.
“I know, I’m sorry. It’s just-“ he looked towards Vince. Vincent who had died so horribly, who had been so young but who was alive again. Who could make him laugh, who had always protected him and stood by him. He knew he had to make changes in the world, had to keep certain people alive - merlin, he would try and save everyone give the chance, but having the idea in his mind to make changes and actually doing it were so wildly different. Just looking at Vince for too long made his breathe short, it filled him with an aching sense of dread, he would see flashes of fire and could feel heat upon his skin, worst of all - he could smell the burning, Vince’s burning flesh. He had worked so very hard to move past the war, he hadn’t confronted his grief, not really - just ignored it, but it had worked in the most part. On occasions he would have nightmares, waking up in a cold sweat, the traces of a painful scream on his tongue and he would have to force himself to remember thats was in his apartment, that the war was over, the Potter had won. Potter had saved them all. But going back and seeing all those corpses alive again, walking, talking and breathing it was overwhelming. He felt as though he was being haunted, having to waking up in the same dorm as Vince everyday, seeing his godfather in lessons - being unable to really look at the one man in his live who had really loved him without the aching feeling creeping up his spine. He wanted so badly to be brave, to be strong, not to be weak. He wanted to be able to have his childhood with his friends once more, he wanted to spend time with Severus again - to appreciate him properly this time. He just couldn’t. He wasn’t brave. He was weak.
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
He watched the match from the Slytherin stands, he already knew that Potter would catch the snitch and won the game for Gryffindor so he was hardly paying attention. It wasn’t until after the match when something different happened - when he was bombarded by three Gryffindors, he imagined that they would be celebrating in their common room and that be would be able to study alone in the library but he was granted no such luck.
For I'm a Thinking Cap!"
There's nothing hidden in your head
“Distracted?” He questioned.
“Thank you. Dobby.” Draco Smiled. “Now, I suppose I will have my breakfast in my room if that is okay. I don’t want to face father just yet.” He hummed to himself. “And Dobby, you should join me for breakfast. Yes. That would be wonderful.”
Time passed and soon he flung himself waking up on Halloween, this was one of the first important otant days he had remembered from his first time round. He remembered a lazy day with the Slytherin, laughing and being children in their common room, he remembered the beginning of the feast being content and then he remembered screaming and Professor Quirell yelling about a troll in the Dungeons. He remembered realising that no one truly cared about his house, they had all been ordered back to their dorms - Slytherin going to the exact place the troll was last spotted, he remembered being furious and for the first time realising that Slytherins had to protect each other even if they hated one and other because no one else was planning to stick up for them because everyone believed they were evil even the ones who were only eleven. (Draco new that he did become evil the first time round, had become evil like they all believed he would because no one helped him. He wasn’t kind of pleasant when he was eleven but he was a child and someone should have been protecting them, someone should have helped him escape his father - an adult should have noticed. But they didn’t want to notice, not for a Slytherin or a Malfoy.)
‘And yes you’re loyal, perhaps Hufflepuff is for you.’
“By who?” He questioned, clearly not interested.
“Malfoy - I, can I speak to you please.” God Potter really didn’t understand when was and wasn’t a good time to stand and chat.
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.
“With?” Draco asks, it’s weird being on Thai side of things he thinks, Potter asking for his help.
“Why would you think that.” He asked, nodding for the two boys two sit on the couch that was adjacent to his chair.
His mother had been true to her word and had treated Draco with ice cream before they had to return home. He was so happy, more happy than he had been in years. His mother, beautiful and regal and alive, Narcissa sitting across from him.
Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.
Draco had made his way to the library after classes, like Potter had asked him to. He felt piercing green eyes on him as soon as he stepped through the door, it wasn’t hard to find the table either Weasley’s hair stuck out like a sore thumb in the sea of brown that made up the library. Draco was only somewhat surprised to see Hermione sitting with the duo, of course he knew they had become friends during first year he just wasn’t sure what the uniting factor was, now he supposed it was the troll attack. He decided not to think too deeply into what his involvement in the matter could change about the future.
So put me on! Don't be afraid!
Dumbledore was there as well but Draco made a point to avoid looking at him, even at nineteen if someone had mentioned the old man name Draco would withdraw from those around him, his mind going back to the astronomy tower.
You might belong in Hufflepuff,
‘And oh my you are brave aren’t you.’
“Draco.” Potter greeted as they made their way towards his table.
His second time at a Hogwarts began to feel like his first time all over again, with Potter shooting him glares in classes, across the great hall and every over place he saw Draco. It wasn’t exactly like his first time, he cared a lot more, he was a scared eleven year old boy who was unsure of himself but this time he knows. He’s still scared but he knows and he can do good, he doesn’t care about the same things, not about grades or status, he doesn’t care about Potter in the same way either. He isn’t obsessed with the boy-who-lived this time round, he knows the boy is important but he also knows that he won’t help Draco. The decision to not help the trio was selfish, he wants to spend more time with the people he’s lost but Potters attitude towards him seemed like a complete change after the day in the library, at first Potter was inviting him everywhere and constantly wanting Draco to help him but now it was full of far away glares and hard shoulders.
“Hello?”
“I don’t know what I would do if Harry was somewhere I couldn’t reach him for 12 years. It must have been hard on you,” Draco says, “I mean, my father is there and I couldn’t care less but Harry...” he drifts off.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked after Harry put the lid on the pan and turned toward him.
“Do you want?”
“Well don’t blow anything up, boy,” and she hung up. Draco watched as Harry’s shoulders dropped and he locked his phone.
They stood on the doorstep of number 4 Privet Drive in silence. Harry pushed the key into the door and stepped inside, Draco following behind him.
“Well,” Draco started, “not just you. Remus, too. It wasn’t long, I just...” he trailed off a bit when Harry came to stand in front of him.
“Alright.”
Draco dropped a kiss onto his head, “About?”
Yes, Harry is strong, Draco thinks to himself at dinner, but he shouldn’t have to be.
“Oh. Hi, Harry.”
“Could you,” Draco started, “uhm. Could you tell me about them? James and Lily, I mean?”
“Oh absolutely,” Remus got up, rubbing his knee a bit, “James would have given you hell just like Sirius, but they would have liked you.”
“Good. Long, but good,” Harry started getting the browned onions out of the oil, “Had first years today, so very basic stuff. What about you?”
“For what?”
It’s not alright, Draco thinks to himself, how can you say it’s alright?! This is where coats and boots and blankets are kept, not children. Especially not you.
Remus chuckles and sips his drink, “What are you angry about, Draco?”
“Oh,” Remus sounded shocked, “sure. What do you want to know?”
“Yeah,” Draco sips his drink, “we do.”
Sirius hugged him back, “Absolutely. I’ll see you then,” they pulled apart and Harry moved to wrap an arm around Draco’s waist. Draco dropped a kiss on top of his hair.
“Thank you,” Draco finally got out, “for everything. Honestly.”
“It’s okay,” Harry says, “Lets go.”
Harry nudged Sirius’ ribs, “Not if Kreature is still there. He hates me and you both,” he pulled Sirius into a hug, “I’ll talk to you tomorrow, yeah? Lunch?”
“Anything. Everything.”
Pressing another kiss on the back of Harry’s neck, Draco pulls away to get a drink, “Do you want one?” Draco tilts a bottle of wine toward Harry when he turns around.
“We’ll find time,” Draco said into Remus’ shoulder, hugging him back.
“Asking to see this. You didn’t actually need to grab anything, did you?” Harry shakes his head on Draco’s collarbone, “We shouldn’t have come.”
Harry looked up at Draco, a small smile on his face, “Yeah. Just tired,” he walked past Draco, pressed a kiss to his cheek, and went into their room.
“That’s fine. We won’t be here but you still have a key, yeah?”
A warm feeling washed over Draco, “Do you think?”
Harry makes a face of understanding before dumping the paste into a bowl, “What did he say?”
“I think it’s time,” Harry replied, leaning his head onto Draco’s thigh, “I’ll call them tonight.”
“It’s not a pretty story,” Remus starts, “I spent a lot of time angry, hiding from the world. I initially went to Dumbledore, but you know how he is. So I holed up in my parents old house in Wales and just waited. For Sirius or for death I’m not sure to this day.”
“Did you know? About the way he was treated?” Draco looks into Remus’ eyes, “Did anyone tell you?”
“You just?” Harry smiled a bit, wrapping his arms around Draco’s middle.
“Me?” Harry turned from the sink where he was hand washing dishes, “What about me?”
Remus pulled away and grabbed his coat, and with a pop was gone again.
Remus’ eyes flick between Draco and the men in the garden, and muffles the world around them wordlessly, “Why do you ask?”
Draco stood, reaching out to shake Remus’ hand, “Thank you.”
Remus leans forward to place a hand on Draco’s knee, “I’ll let you know if you do.”
“What are you making, dear?”
“Alright, love,” Draco went back to his book while Harry’s eyes drooped.
“Calm down, love,” Harry placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder, “it’s alright.”
“Are you alright?”
Yes, Harry is smart, Draco thinks when they go to Hogwarts to set up Harry’s classroom, but he shouldn’t have had to decode riddles for three years to save the world.
