“Tell me what you did to her or I swear I’ll kill you” He still threatened her in that same particularly frightening voice. The girl's eyes widened but she didn’t speak. At the end of a duel of particularly dark looks, she finally pronounced a sentence.
“The blond one” Ron and Harry snickered, the hair color of Malfoy's potential son was not really surprising. Hermione's doubts increased. That little blond boy had called Harry as well as Malfoy daddy. Either this little boy had confused them, which greatly surprised Hermione, or he called everyone Daddy. She thinks about it more intensely, and then finally decides that the problem wasn’t there. The problem was that no one seemed to think it was strange that children coming out of nowhere looked a lot like them and called them daddy. When she came back to reality, the tone had gone up between the three boys, especially between Ron and Malfoy. Harry seemed to be content to listen to them with an amused or even a fond air. She sighed and decided to stop them.
“The kids want to find out what’s behind the wall” Blaise said with a shrug, like all of this didn’t concern him.
“We just wanted to be sure that everything was fine” Nathaniel said. Harry suddenly saw an image of himself and Draco kissing in front of his eyes, followed by a sense of frustration. He was very surprised and turned his eyes to Draco, it could only come from him. He looked up at Harry and when their eyes met Harry realized that Draco had not intentionally sent this picture and the blond knew that Harry had seen it. His eyes widened and he suddenly became red. He stammered out words that Harry did not understand and ran away. Harry stood there, the children staring at him unrestrainedly. As he watched them, he realized that in the end he knew nothing about them, their ages, their homes, or how they were designed. He told them of this observation.
“Oh stop it for Merlin’s sake” Draco burst out laughing and Harry was captivated by the laughing Slytherin, so he forgot about the dreadful image in his mind. Draco completely ignored Harry's gaze and continued to laugh. Lyra moved closer to Hermione and whispered in his ear.
“I'm not going to sleep with you, Malfoy” He told him, once they got to their room. Draco just nodded, perfectly okay, though a little concerned. They each went through the bathroom and went to bed each on their own.
“Sounds pretty good, hum?” She nodded, smiling. Draco and Harry finally calmed down and Harry finally straightened up. When he met the gray eyes, he blushed, embarrassed by his behavior. Harry bowed his head as he felt his dress pulled. He saw Irina, the blue-eyed girl, so he lifted her off the ground and put her on his lap. She began to eat what was on her plate and quickly Lesath was dissatisfied. Draco then put him on his own lap. Harry was glad to have gone to eat early and to have several tables when he saw the ten people still in the apartment arrived together. They all settled in a happy hubbub. Ginny and Pansy joined them and they were complete. Harry noticed that Ron looked different, less reassured and more open to his children. He smiled at his friend, happy to have found him again. Harry noticed that Dumbledore had risen and approached them. He had a sudden bad feeling. The director stopped at their level and gave them classes for the day to get to know each other better and to digest the new events that took place. Harry knew he was talking about this story of Soul mates. He looked at Hermione.
“Yes, with an interlocked M and P!” Harry laughed. Draco was still looking at the locket, which he had laid flat in the palm of his hand.
“What the fuck are you doing, Malfoy?” Harry didn’t saw it but Draco flinched as he felt Harry's breath in his neck.
“Voldemort has separated his soul into eight pieces and placed each part in an object or a living being, and as long as those objects are not destroyed, he won’t die completely” She explained.
Hermione and Ron had gone to ask permission to eat in the apartment. Blaise and Theo were doing a chess game in the first’s room. Pansy and Ginny, who were getting on strangely together, were ordering the elves for dinner. The children were therefore alone in the living room and the organization didn’t seem to be their main quality. Harry suddenly felt a kiss on his neck and shivered. He grabbed the hands on his waist and intertwined his fingers with Draco's.
“I know it's hard to believe, but yes” Lyra, who seemed to be the spokesperson for the small group, said.
“Dad, calm down” Lyra tried to soothe. Draco looked at her with a dark look, obviously very angry. Lyra, Nathaniel and Ezekiel had joined them upstairs and tried to explain the situation to the parents.
“No, but we do” Ezekiel interjected, before his father decided to kill the director with his own hands.
“All I remember is that I was sleeping and when I woke up, we were lying in the Chamber of secrets” The young blonde began.
Then all the adults in the house made their appearances in the kitchen. Arthur and Tonks stared up at the sight as those in the audience gave them bored looks and Narcissa offered them a tender smile. The two boys blushed rather violently and literally fled from the room, taking refuge in the three Slytherin’s room.
“Zabini’s nice, Harry! It's a catastrophe!” The redhead lamented, letting himself fall on the bed, face against the mattress. Harry giggled at seeing his desperate friend trying to choke himself.
“ Do you have a backache?” Harry asked. Draco tried to give him a reassuring smile, assuring him that it was nothing. Harry didn’t believe him in the least, but pretended to. He suddenly remembered that this morning the teachers were coming back to the castle. He jumped out of bed and extended his hand to Draco and stood in front of him.
“You never explained what it was, only that a powerful magical bond tied you to each other. A link from ... I don’t know anymore. "Ezekiel answered them.
“Levels? What does it mean?” Hermione flipped through a page. “It depends on the strength of the bond. The stronger the link is, the higher the level is. There would apparently be only four levels. You are certainly not level one since there is no physical or psychological effect. Let's see level two...” Hermione was talking while reading and Harry began to shake his legs nervously.
“Well, it's not that we don’t have fun here, but it's, what, 4am so now everyone is going to bed” Zach almost ordered. Lyra pulled Nathaniel by the arm since he was literally glued to Jordan. The latter rolled his eyes before releasing the blond.
“I think Seth is Remus's son” The boy's eyes lit up at the first name deal, proving that Hermione was right. She then stared at the two remaining ones for a long time.
“It's your children too, I'll let you know, and if you think carrying our kids is damaging your body that’s because you don’t like them and me either” Harry almost shouted. Draco looked at him with a slightly jaded look. He got up and rested his hands on the table. He stared into Harry's eyes.
“Yes, and I went back, but Dumbledore sent me word that there was also a room for me here so I came back.” Harry nodded and thanked the headmaster for that. Suddenly a thud rang out from Ron and Zabini's room. They all looked at each other, worried. It looked like something breaking on the floor or against a wall.
“It should be pretty simple guys, according to me, daddy will be the seeker, Uncle Ron the keeper, Uncle Theo and father as beaters and Aunt Ginny, Uncle Blaise and Aunt Pansy the Chasers” Lyra said.
“I know you don’t like it” Draco didn’t answer and just mingled his fingers with Harry's. They entered the apartment and all eyes followed them but nobody dared to say a single word. When they entered the room, Draco dropped his hand and went to sit on the bed. Harry went to put on a hoodie over his T-shirt, then took his invisibility cloak and entered the bathroom. He emerged a few seconds later with a potion for Draco. He knelt before him and handed him the vial. The blond took it, smiling. He reached for Harry and pulled off his hood. He ran his fingers through Harry's brown hair. He leaned over and kissed the brunette's lips.
“It's really beautiful, thank you” He murmured as he passed the chain around his neck. Harry smiled widely and returned to take possession of Draco's lips in a passionate kiss. The blonde moved away from Harry.
“The wall ejected him” Blaise answered, staring at the wall, frowning. Draco helped Harry to stand up when Hermione jumped up the last steps of the stairs, a big smile on her face.
“Daddy wants to eat with everyone but dad doesn’t want to wait, so they scream at each other” He told them, his eyes glistening with tears.
“What? What did you say?” The blond sighed and said his sentence again, much more audibly this time.
“Yes, they are. And this little boy is even more so” She chuckled. Lucius gave up, seeing that it was useless to fight.
“Interesting hypothesis, let's try with your redhead friend” Harry turned his gaze to him and laughed. He then asked Ron, still in his corner, alone. The red then advanced towards them.
“Slow down, sweetie, maybe we'll wait for the others.” The three of them were now planted in the hallway, Harry and Malfoy holding hands with Lesath. Harry was going to suggest that they go into the living room to wait for the others when he saw Hermione coming out of one of the rooms, further down the hall.
When he got to the room, he threw Harry on the bed and settled between his legs. He let his tongue danced with Harry’s while passing his hands under his T-shirt. Harry straightened so he could take it off and he took the opportunity to remove the sweater from the blond. He then dropped back against the mattress, dragging Draco into his fall. His tongue entered his boyfriend’s mouth again, looking for his twin. They quickly removed the little clothes they had left, and it was breathless that Harry uttered words that Draco never thought he would hear.
“How?” Harry asked, believing his godfather was dead. Dimitri just laughed lightly and he pushed Harry and Draco into their room before closing the door.
“You two are completely stupid!” Nathaniel got up and faced her. He was slightly taller than her but she didn’t pulled herself apart.
“Did I do something wrong?” Harry laughed through his tears and straightened up on his lap to kiss Draco. Draco wrapped his arms around his waist and dropped against the incredibly soft mattress under the weight of the brunette falling against him. Harry sat astride him and began to kiss his neck and collarbone. Draco let out a groan as the gryffindor gently bit the thin skin of his collarbone.
“Molly, we already talked about it” She sighed and nodded dryly. They then all formed a chain to Apparate and Molly didn’t notice that Harry and Draco were holding hands to Apparate. They arrived directly inside the house.
“Well, that's not normal. We've never seen children under eleven years old here, one of them said you were his father, and this boy who shoved you looked just like you, Harry. Don’t you think it's a little strange?”
“Alya, Ezekiel and I went to see this wall more closely and thanks to our powers we learned that this wall was covered with a concealment and protection spell”
“You're also not level two, since the only things in level two are only a slight discomfort when the other is away. In level three, the symptoms of distance are stronger. A great fatigue is the main thing, but it is said that both people are barely alive. Apparently, the powers increase slightly too. So I deduce that you are level four, except that we know practically nothing about it because there was only one case and both died because they were separated during a whole day” Harry laughed nervously.
“You catch my daughter and me Harry” He said hastily to his two friends before rushing at full speed to the brown. The impact was anything but delicate. Draco gasped as he hit Harry, but he held on tight and wrapped his arms around him to hold him on the broom. He descended to a suitable height and pushed the Gryffindor away from him. The brown man wrapped his arms around Draco and hugged him tightly. Draco could hear screams of misunderstanding in the crowd, wondering why Harry had not come down on his broom right now screaming at him that no one had asked him to save him.
The nurse had just spent over an hour explaining to them everything that was going to happen and all that Harry had withheld was that Draco's waist was going to expand for the first month and that was why he was suffering. They were now lying on their side, face to face. Draco stared at Harry, not knowing what to think.
“Are you going to send me back to my bed? Or will you allow me to stay here?” Harry finally asked after a long time when they nearly fell asleep.
“First, you said the he’s acting softly and men who only fuck another people don’t act softly” Pansy started.
“Let's go?” He asked in the direction of the triplets as he reached their room. They all nodded in perfect synchronization.
“What the fuck are you doing?” Zachady started as he closed the door so as not to wake the two sleeping girls inside.
“Can you help me move those books?” Harry asked, starting to take several large volumes in his arms. Blaise's hand stopped him from grabbing the books.
“I mean that you’re always panicking when going somewhere he is. Remember before fourth year? You talked about the World Cup for weeks because he would probably be there. And you did it before each year after that. You’re stressed out by the mere thought of his presence.”
“You okay?” He asked. Jordan simply nodded but he was holding really hard to Nathaniel. Harry had recovered a bit at that moment, now that he was relieved and reassured about Jordan. There was a loud noise against the door, like something crashing on it.
“And ... How ... uh ... how exactly are you born?” Harry asked, blushing. Erin laughed slightly in front of his embarrassment. Lyra cleared her throat, preparing for a long speech.
“Molly, they just want a party to have fun, if that can reassure you we won’t let them any alcohol” He winked at them, however. Molly grunted and left the table furiously under the laughter of everyone else. They finally finished the meal quickly and while the children were all rushing upstairs, causing a hell of a bang on the stairs. The teenagers of the present day went into the living room with the adults. Harry didn’t listen to the conversation but it seemed to him that the subject was the children and who were their parents, although Molly, Arthur and Tonks were the only ones who did not know. Harry closed his eyes and tilted his head back on the couch, feeling a strange sensation invade his head. It was strange but pleasant, so nice that after a while, he moaned.
However, Harry fainted again and Draco barely had time to catch him. He lifted him off the floor bridal-style and ran up the stairs. He entered his children's room through the open door.
“But do you know what it's all about?” The girl and the four boys behind her gave him smiles that didn’t reassured Harry. He dropped his head against the top of the sofa and jumped when he found himself facing Draco's face. Draco looked away from the book he was reading over Hermione's shoulder and looked at Harry, who was looking at him in an odd way.
“Obviously, Uncle Blaise already has this craze to unburden you” The young man grunted, folding his arms over his chest, sulking. Then Lesath reappeared on the doorstep.
“You had a very nice dream that night and I had all the feelings of your dream while I was talking to my father”
“Mr. Malfoy” The headmaster greeted with a smile. Draco replied with a brief movement of his head. The blonde felt that Harry was awake thanks to their bond, so he turned his head towards the brunette until he opened his eyes. The latter did not delay in doing so and he smiled when he saw Draco. He turned his gaze to the six adults and frowned.
“Sorry, I'm going to bed, good night, both of you” Then with these words he went to his bed, undressed, slipped between the sheets and closed the curtains. Blaise and his son looked at each other, stunned by the redhead's behavior. Zachady gave Blaise an encouraging smile before leaving the room. Blaise was planted in the middle of the room, completely lost. Then he finally went to sleep.
“It's already started?” Harry couldn’t take it anymore, there was too much information all at once. He was risking his life in all that. So he got up, very upset.
“Well, firstly it seems that the duration changes according to your physical proximity. For example if you are close enough physically but do not touch, you can stay a good while but you will eventually need to touch each other. However, the further you are from each other, the less you can stay. And the longer you stay in touch, the more you can stay away” Harry was stunned, his friend had gone to great lengths for him. He got up and went to take her in his arms. Lyra then came running and was relieved when she saw her little brother. Realizing she was scared by not finding him in his bed when she got up, Harry apologized flatly. She reassured him then, assuring him that it was not serious. Harry then felt a strange feeling, a mixture of panic and stress. He apologized to the girls and disappeared as quickly as possible. Seeing him leave almost running, they worried and followed him. Harry went up the stairs four at a time and narrowly escaped the stairs. He rushed to the door where his name was inscribed. Just before he reached it, she opened on Draco.
“Oh” was all Harry could say as he blushed. He threw a new Tempus without his wand and he saw that it was almost dinner time.
“She's with Theo and I don’t want to come in” He winced again and put one of his hands against his loins.
“It was the voice of Dimitri or did I dreamed?” Alarik's voice asked a little further down the hall.
“So, these explanations?” Lyra turned back to him, only noticing at that moment that her fathers were there. She walked over to him with a huge book and laid it on her lap.
“I see it too, Luce, but my son's face shines with joy and that's all I care about” Lucius looked more closely at his son, he was facing the table again and the blond boy was standing on his legs and the boy was talking cheerfully as Draco smiled at him. He saw Harry put his arm around his son's waist and his smile grew even bigger. Lucius smiled, it's true his son had never seemed so happy. He told himself that finally he had done well to ask Dumbledore for help to flee the dark lord. His wife and son seemed happy, as well as him.
“Harry, mate, if you win, I swear I'll give you my gratitude and my eternal friendship” Ron added with a laugh.
“I'm going to kill that damn dark Lord as soon as possible and nothing will happen to you” Draco smiled and pulled Harry into a languid kiss.
“A...Absolutely” Draco moaned, stirring his hips unconsciously. Harry pulled him down and settled between his legs. He literally ripped away Draco's pants and his boxers too. Draco also removed the clothes Harry had left, so they were both completely naked. Harry lay down on his boyfriend and their two erections met, giving them pleasant chills. They both moaned together. Draco then exchanged their positions with a simple movement of his hips.
“Why are you still wasting time looking at us that way instead of looking for him?” Blaise suggested. She looked meanly at them for a few more seconds and then slammed the door shut. The four boys burst out laughing as they imagined the woman looking for Harry while he was in this room.
“You’re serious? Stop it right now, Potter” His sentence was not as threatening as he thought, it was probably because he smiled and laughed lightly. Harry burst out laughing, proud of his little joke. He had added Snape to the image Draco had sent him and imposed it in the blonde's mind. He was laughing all the while and when the Professor Dumbledore crossed the hall, accompanied by Professor Snape, their laughter intensified.
“I was angry, and you were too” Harry continued, his voice louder now. “And I know you were angry because of me, because I’m never careful on missions and almost always get injured. But I love you and I’m sorry I said you were selfish”
“Because from what I understand, we’re alive because our children have made us sleep together half-naked, which means that your contact keeps me alive. So if I stay with you, at the slightest sign of weakness, I'll just have to touch you so that none of us will faint again” Harry looked surprised and nodded.
“I want you” He murmured in a warm voice in the Slytherin's ear as he waved his hip. Draco’s usually pale cheeks took on a pretty red color and he moaned weakly. Harry then licked the his earlobe sensually. Draco protested limply, claiming that they had to find a plan to destroy the locket in order to defeat Voldemort.
“We need to get out of here” Harry said as the three of them looked at the door. Jordan looked about to faint and really not able to run. “You apparate in the chamber of secrets and you stay there” He told Nath before running away to where Alya and Ezekiel were still fighting with the tall guy.
The books were all stacked and there was a gaping hole in the wall. There was no one in the room so he walked to the opening and was stunned to find another room on the other side. He stepped over what was left of the wall and looked carefully around him. It was a small room that looked more like a hallway than a real room. He saw that the explosion seemed to be coming from the wall at the back, so he approached it.
“Following these strange events, which, by chance, brings together the Gryffindor and Slytherin houses, I decided it would be easier to get to know each other if we all lived together” They all stared at him with wide eyes and he smiled amusedly before coming out of the room, leaving them in utter misunderstanding.
“Maybe you three should do it?” Hermione asked the triplets, more to Ezekiel and Alya since Nathaniel was still on the couch, probably too far to even hear the conversation. “You told us you were the most powerful here”
“Are you OK ?” He asked Harry. The brunette nodded as Severus hurried toward them. They all three exchanged a look. Severus silently asking if Harry was okay.
"Stop making that face, you know just as well as me that I have a gift a hundred times more awesome than this book up there but that I want to offer you when we are alone" A big smile extended then on the blonde's lips and the rest of the day went relatively well. In the days that followed, Molly continued to avoid them and unfortunately Draco and Harry never had the opportunity to exchange their presents. Harry vaguely wondered why the children seemed to never be there.
“We fell and we stayed there to hide from Molly” Harry explained. The boy rolled on his back. The door opened again and Ezekiel entered laughing with Joris and Alarik.
“what about undoing the spells and then opening the wall with magic?” Ascella asked. Harry thought it was a rather good
He smiled sadly at Harry because he had to push him away. Even if drunk Harry was adorable with his big, shiny eyes and soft smile.
“I was preparing a Christmas present! That's why I was not there often” From where he was, Draco didn’t see Harry's reaction who kept walking. “I love you, Harry, I just wanted to surprise you” Then, feeling no reaction, he returned sheepishly into the living room. He walked slowly through the living room, staring at the floor as Harry held him by the wrist. Draco turned slowly and to his surprise Harry placed his lips on his. He slightly opened his lips and let Harry's tongue get into his mouth.
He was in deep thought and panicked as he felt Draco's breathing changed in his neck. He straightened slightly and placed his face above Harry's. Then he dropped to the side, dragging Harry with him who still had his arms wrapped around him. They found themselves again face to face, staring at each other. Harry was feeling a lot better now. And before they could say anything, they heard a door open. Then hurried footsteps approached the bed and the curtains opened slowly. Hermione jumped slightly, not expecting them to be awake, and especially that they didn’t killed each other. They hadn’t looked up at her, still staring so closely at each other. She cleared her throat and Malfoy darted a cold look on her as Harry turned on his back to see her.
“SHUT UP!” Dimitri snarled, silencing the other ten teenagers, the children remaining playing in the living room.
“Hermione, your highs were not bad either” Harry said. Theo choked on his laughter and Hermione became the same red color than Draco.
“Er... because... because... because it's a game!” Harry replied again with a tense smile. Draco laughed silently at the absurdity of this excuse.
He saw a lightning breaking the sky and for a moment he thought it might not be the best idea he had to pursue the snitch. He said to himself that it had not been a good idea when a lightning flash hit his broom. The broom literally broke into pieces and Harry had the uncomfortable sensation of feeling a thick piece of the broom sinking into his belly. He screamed in pain and fear as he felt himself fall back at a bewildering speed.
“Or you can go straight to the part in which you kiss him” Ron blushed to the roots of his hair and stammered that he could not do that.
“So stop being so soft and fuck me hard for Merlin’s sake!” Harry’s eyes snapped to his grey ones and a wicked grin spread across his face. He thrusted his hips so his dick sheathed itself fully inside Draco at once, pressing against his prostate heavily, making Draco scream in pleasure. Harry pulled out and flipped Draco so he was on his knees. He then quickly penetrated Draco again, not losing his stride. His thrusts became faster after that and Draco rested his head on his arms as he panted and screamed his pleasure.
‘Just like your father’ he had said. Draco had never felt so cold in his entire life. He hadn’t waited for Harry to say anything else and stormed out of their flat, slamming the door behind him.
“We found what we could tell you” Jordan said. Ron looked interested in the conversation again.”But it’d be easier if you asked questions” Ron looked down, already searching.
“Getting back to Quidditch, do you have a way to build a team? For a little parent-child match maybe?” He asked. The children answered yes with great enthusiasm and got up hurriedly from the table, going upstairs to develop this famous team. The table was suddenly very big and empty. With a movement of the wrist, Harry made the empty tables disappear and they were all less distant. They started talking again, although the atmosphere was slightly tense.
“They are the most powerful soulmates that exist, Uncle Theo. So we, their children, are more powerful than average. But an only child will not be as powerful as twins. And having triplets is exceptional for two men, so Nathaniel, our sister and I are almost as powerful as our parents” Blaise and Theo nodded, impressed.
She stared at him for a long moment and then sighed and changed rooms. Remus just passed by smiling. Harry made the idea of packing their bags for their return the next day. Harry found himself going back and forth between the room he shared with Ron and the three Slytherins’ room to get all his belongings. The redhead was sitting on his trunk on his bed and laughing as Harry ran from room to room. Ron couldn’t help laughing more beautifully at the scene unfolding before his eyes.
As he stabilized himself, he saw his friends fall all around him, without their brooms. He created a kind of invisible moss on the ground so that his friends would not crash on the ground. And as Draco came close to him with a panicked scream, Harry grabbed him by the waist and put him on his broom, facing him.
“Your parents didn’t teach you politeness!? One knocked before entering” The young man smirked as his father lost his temper.
“So, I heard you were in love with me” He tried to joke. The brunette blushed even more. “And I think it's really great, actually” She looked up at him as she heard those words and she frowned, not seeing what he wanted to say.
“Oh, yes you taught me that, but your home is kinda my home too you see, and you don’t knock before entering your own home” Severus didn’t believed it, that arrogance.
Then suddenly a soft golden light escaped the palms of his hands in waves. Slowly, he could see the wound close up while Jordan had finally arrived and was doing his best to comfort his boyfriend who was not as confident as a few moments ago. Ezekiel seemed bored even though the glimmer of worry in his eyes escaped no one.
“I learned something fantastic today” Harry growled. “Dumbledore told us at dinner that all those mingled with the kids and the kids themselves would spend the Christmas holidays at the Order's HQ” The blonde punctuated his sentence with kisses in the Gryffindor's neck. The latter detached himself from Draco and turned around and rushed upstairs. Draco raised his eyebrows, not understanding where the problem was.
Draco nodded to Harry, indicating that he was taking care of this and that Harry could continue. The brunette then took it in his mouth at once and Draco narrowly stopped from shouting his pleasure. The door opened suddenly and Blaise came in to go to the sink. He entered so discreetly that the two boys didn’t hear him. Draco bit violently in his hand as he arched and pushed his nails into Harry's shoulder as he came. The blonde slid down the cold wall and Harry came to kiss him when he was at his level. Draco was out of breath and had red cheeks out of pleasure.
“Get your ass from this chair and go see my father! Or I’ll I make you find yourself on one of these beds... For the rest of your days?” Draco raised an eyebrow at hearing his daughter threaten the nurse. Then finally he giggled when he saw the latter arrive with a quick step and a frightened air.
Pansy rolled her eyes too as Draco opened his mouth in outrage. He wasn’t afraid to see Potter. He wasn’t! Well, maybe he was a bit but they didn’t need to actually know that. It wasn’t fear anyway, it was more like he dreaded to see him again but definitely wanted to at the same time.
“Why are you making these faces?” Harry asked. The teenagers didn’t answer and Nathaniel leaned towards them.
Harry fell down on his bed without any gracefulness. His day had been exhausted. He crossed his arms behind his head and sinked into his memories of the day, hoping to figure out what the fuck had happened all day long. He thought about the morning potion class first.
“Well, what are we doing now?” Ezekiel asked boredly, sitting on one of the tables. He received no answer. Eleanor sat down next to him and put her hand on his thigh. A chuckle made him turn his head. He saw Jordan and Nathaniel on one of the sofas, kissing each other. Jordan was obviously pushing the blonde to lie down.
Then, suddenly, Harry's eyes opened wide. Draco saw him through his tears and Harry straightened up immediately, no longer having any trace of any injury, other than the blood that covered his chest. Draco threw himself on him, still shaking and sobbing and Harry squeezed his arms around the blonde. They stayed a long time like this, until the Slytherin calmed down and when that was the case, Harry pushed him slightly away from him and wiped the tears off his face. Draco smiled and stood up, extending a hand to Harry, to help him up. No sooner was he standing than Draco flung himself against him again, clutching his arms around him compulsively. Harry ran a hand through his blond hair and whispered that he was okay in Draco's ear. The latter slowly calmed down and then pushed his face away from Harry's neck.
“Do you want me to take down the bottom too, Potter?” Harry's eyes widened and he blushed heavily. Why was he fixing him like that? He was not doing well, really. He hurried back to his bed and quickly closed the curtains. He pulled back as far as possible, sticking his back against the wall. He pulled his legs against his chest and rested his chin on his knees. He thought back to the events of the night before and groaned in disappointment as he realized it was clearly not a dream.
“Harry wants to talk about horcruxes” The headmaster explained. Harry then giggled while picking up another candy. Draco approached him and pushed him away from the bowl of candy.
“Yes I am! You're just dirty Slytherins stealing my best friends and everyone thinks it's normal” He spat. The blond Slytherin raised an eyebrow of misunderstanding.
"I'd say it's because a perfect replica of you is in my arms" Draco chuckled in his corner and Molly looked at him questioningly so he calmed down.
The latter then removed Harry's T-shirt and threw it to the ground. He then took possession of the lips so attractive. He slid his tongue into Harry's mouth and Harry moaned in his mouth, which caused an immense shudder in Draco’s back who moaned in his turn. A sound of broken dishes made them jump.
“You're a Horcrux and you have to die if you want to kill Voldemort” Harry widened his eyes even more and spoke no more words
“If you kill me... you'll go to Azkaban” Ezekiel chuckled a little hysterically, making him look slightly like a madman.
While he was going to replicate and send the perfect replica of Sirius Black out of his appartment, the door opened on two identical boys.
“You can communicate by thought” Harry's mouth formed an "o". “And I also seem to have found a way for you to get away for a longer time”
“You've cured his eyesight dad and I've seen you do it already!” It will work but act quickly!” Draco looked at his son and he found the courage he needed in his emerald eyes similar to those of the brown. He began to wish the strongest he could that it would work and that Harry would recover and not die. His hands were still shaking as much, if not more, he was still shaking with sob and tears fogging his eyes.
“Yes, dad Sev is working here” Pansy and Ginny's eyes widened. Their potion teacher was gay, that was a hell of a lot. Pansy got up and took the baby in her arms.
The two of them hugged for a long time, a time in which Nathaniel told Harry and Draco who where these kids. The girl Zach ran to was Aludra and she looked a bit like him. The boy Emerick was hugging was Daniel, Remus and Tonks’ son. Then there vas Riley and Alice, Emerik’s siblings. Riley was about 15 and Alice was probably 11. She had beautiful blond hair and blue eyes, just like Luna. There was another blond girl around the same age, Lilith.
“It's not because my brother is rejecting you that you have to scream at us, mate” Ezekiel joked. Dimitri's jaw tightened and Ezekiel immediately knew he was going too far. “Before you scream that he’s not rejecting you, know that it’s the truth. He doesn’t reject you, he even told us that he thought he was in love with you, Dimi” the latter widened his eyes.
Draco had just announced his plan idea to his father and the rest of the teachers and now they all seemed to think about it seriously.
He suddenly had an idea and reversed their positions. He could clearly see in Draco's eyes that he didn’t understand what was going on. However, the blonde didn’t have time to ask even a question since Harry took his cock in him at once. Draco cried in pleasure while the brunette clenched his teeth in pain. Draco pulled him to kiss him passionately as he took his cock in hand to make him relax. Quickly, Harry began to moan and began to move back and forth by using his knees and then falling back, causing cries, both from him and Draco.
“My name is Nathaniel” The blond began “And he's Jordan” He finished, pointing to his friend. Hermione nodded and seemed to think of something that no one else could think of. When she returned to her, the four boys were waiting patiently for her to come out of her thoughts. She gave them a small smile, especially to the brunette one that reminded her of someone, but she didn’t remember who.
When Harry woke up again, everything was clearer in his head. He had fainted for a reason he didn’t know, he had woken up in bed with Draco Malfoy for a reason he didn’t know. No, in fact nothing was clear, everything was confused, he didn’t understand a single thing. He didn’t really understand how such a situation had happened. He didn’t understand how he could have been lying on his back in bed with Malfoy lying on him. And especially he didn’t understand why his arms were wrapped around the blonde as if he was afraid he would leave and even worse, why did he like that? And why didn’t he want to leave?
“Hey Mione, how are you?” She looked extremely relieved and threw herself into Harry's arms, crushing Draco's arm, still on Harry's chest. The blonde said nothing and simply clenched his teeth. Harry squeezed his arms around Hermione and she pulled back, standing up by the bed.
She also received millions of small gifts from her brothers and other children. It was almost the same for the other children. Lesath received a broom at his size. It was the same for the older ones who received scarves, books and gloves. Ascella received a new dress from her parents. Emett received a terribly soft blanket as he complained of being cold. The twins and Erin’s gifts were three brooms, the same ones they had in the future, Draco and Harry having played their last names to get them. The three children jumped into their arms, looking happy. Lyra had just asked for a list of books and nothing else.
It happened two weeks ago. He would probably always remember it, how they fought that day. The scene had been violent. Things had been broken. Draco’s heart as well as some very old and expensive statues.
“Stop bothering Uncle Draco!” Intervened the young man's sister, pulling him elsewhere. Draco laughed and went to get a book from the library. He took a random one and went back to read in his room.
“Again, you bitch, seriously?” A voice yelled. Harry recognized it as Lyra’s. “You think you can kidnap me a second time? You just had me the first time because I was sleeping when you attacked, you stupid fool” Joris was on his feet in two seconds, he grabbed a book in one of the stash and he rushed to the second floor. Harry and Draco ran just behind him.
“What's the habit of having children two by two? Look, we did three at once and then we all got them one by one” Draco said. All the children winced at hearing that.
“Well, I sure do hope he is” He answered before entering under the four twins laughter. Draco was lying on one of the bed, staring at the ceiling. One of his hand was on his belly, where one of their kids was. He turned his head toward Harry when he heard the door. He looked guilty, like he knew he’d made a mistake and didn’t knew how to be forgiven.
“You're the most proficient teacher we've had” Draco interjected. Remus turned his head towards him and frowned.
“Of course not, Uncle Dray” Draco stood up and stared at the boy, none of the children dared to call him that.
“I just thought it was good to be a normal teenager. For a few minutes I forgot that Voldemort wanted to kill me. And it did me a lot of good” Draco made no answer but Harry knew he understood perfectly, being in a similar position since he refused to receive the mark. As he thought about it, Harry understood why Draco looked different this year. He no longer had to hide behind a mask to satisfy his father. Then Harry realized a second thing. Draco had refused the mark before knowing the children, which meant that he had chosen the side of the good, his own side. Maybe it was imagining that he had chosen the side of the good because it was his camp but he decided not to worry. The breeze rose and passed over their two bodies still wet. They shuddered.
Harry was lying in bed and smiling like a fool, thinking back to the events that had taken place earlier. So he’d kissed Draco, which destabilized him. Then he finally kissed him back and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist as Harry had his arms around the blonde's neck, sliding one of his hands through his hair. They had kissed as much as they could before running out of air. They then had broken loose slowly, opening their eyes again. Draco laughed nervously, feeling ridiculous for having fled earlier. Harry had just smiled and kissed him again.
“But we come just after” Ezekiel reminded them with a proud smile. Eleanor hit him on the head with her book  a second time and he winced.
It was Harry's turn to scream. Then followed a fierce battle until they couldn’t breathe anymore. They finally collapsed laughing on the shore. They were out of breath and Harry suddenly laughed. Draco turned his head towards him and Harry could feel his questioning through his arm in contact with his.
However, they did not expect the Horcrux inside the medallion to react to Harry's touch. A sharp cry came out of the locket and a black cloud hit all the occupants of the room. Dolores was the first to get up and, seeing Harry, she cast a spell on him. He felt his flesh being ripped apart and blood spilling at a frantic speed of his body. The triplets practically threw themselves on him and began to stir in order to close the wounds. Harry frowned as he noticed the changed appearance of his three children. Zephir and Lucius were fighting Umbridge during this time.
“Morning” The brown man mumbled back. Draco smiled tenderly and came back to kiss Harry's lips. The latter nibbled the lower lip of the blonde who moaned slightly under the attention. He opened his lips and Harry's tongue met his. They both wound up in a flaming ballet. Draco settled over Harry and Harry spread his legs so the blond could sit between them. Harry moaned as Draco kissed his neck, sucking the skin between his lips.
“Sev found a way to get him out just before school, so by the time I talk to you he probably has to sleep to get back from his stroll in the veil” It was too much for Harry. He dropped to the ground and the tears came out without him being able to control them. Dimitri left them alone. The brown on the ground was shaking with rather violent sobs. Draco knelt down in front of him and Harry pressed himself against him. The blond held him in his arms while the tears subsided. Seeing that didn’t happen, Draco tried to calm him down.
As Remus had predicted, the head of the family spent the entire meal lecturing them while Draco sarcastically commented on everything she said in Harry's head. Molly turned to Harry who had just giggled again and she glared at him.
“What is your plan to seduce our dear brother?” Emett continued. Lesath then ran to him, pulling Seth by the hand.
“Dad doesn’t come?” A small voice asked on his left. He turned his head to Lesath, sitting on Hermione's lap. He sighed and looked in the direction of Malfoy who was staring at him from afar, not knowing whether to approach or not. Harry stared into the blonde's eyes, and he seemed to understand Harry's invitation as he motioned for his friends to follow him.
“And you want me to tell him what? Hi Blaise, you really attract me and I find it horrible because I fall in love with you? Thank you very much, but I'll do without it” Harry settled in the same position as his friend while Draco sat silently on the other bed, an apple and a book in his hand.
“It's still hot out there, right?” Nathaniel asked innocently. His brothers and sisters looked at him exasperatedly. Hermione nodded. “So we could go to the park? to the lake maybe?” His twin sighed.
“From what I read, you had to think both of you at least once in the way ... how do you say? In a love way” Draco and Harry began to think, looking for when it had happened. “But that's not all. It must also after that you have come into contact”
“It's Voldemort” He explained to her darkly, a murderous spark lit in his eyes. She nodded and cast a spell on Harry, which told him that he had just fainted from tiredness.
She didn’t know about the scars and he wished it would stay that way. His mother entered the room with a tight smile and sighed when she saw his trunk still open and entirely empty on his bed.
"Bend down!" Draco frowned. "Bend down, I tell you!" at the agreement of Harry's urgent voice, Draco obeyed and a bludger went to the exact spot where his head was previously. Theo was wide-eyed.
These same children were all in one of the rooms which they had arranged in a sort of HQ. The beds had been transformed into tables and were wedged against the back wall. Sheets of paper were spread out in a messy heap on the tables. Nathaniel, Ezekiel, Jordan, Alarik, and Joris removed the papers with a wave of the hand, making the leaves fly through the room. They then went up to the tables.
“Hey Uncle Sev! How are…” He had looked at Harry while he had talked and now his green eyes were wide open, his mouth as well.
“Your kids are all huddled behind that door, Malfoy” Harry justified. Draco nodded and then peeled off the door before opening it. He turned to Harry.
“I love you” Harry repeated as he looked up at him and Draco noticed the tears in his eyes were running down his cheeks.
“By Merlin Draco! I thought you were going to fight, or to kiss. It was not very clear.”Theo had finally arrived at their height while Pansy was delivering her sentences with an excited air.
“Please, don’t do anything while we're here” Blaise asked. Draco and Harry laughed and then undressed and went to bed. Harry spent a good part of the night staring at the ceiling, thinking that Draco was sleeping. He dreaded the days to come. Draco stared at Harry, refusing to sleep alone. They finally fell asleep, a smile on their lips, happy to be together.
“Oh yes, he's my little brother. Ezekiel, Emett and Lesath are also my little brothers” She said, each pointing to them. Ezekiel was probably Nathaniel's twin brother and Lesath was the little boy she carried in her arms. She then pointed to Jordan.
Without disturbing Lyra and Joris, Zachady, Emerik, Dimitri and Zephir took Lena away. Harry followed them again, pulling Draco by the hand behind him. He vaguely wondered what they were going to do to her when they entered the chamber of secret.
“Yeah, it's a long story. Go to the apartment tonight, we will explain everything and we will introduce your children too” The two adults could only nod while the ten teenagers came out of the room, deciding that the class was over for them.
“So he attracts me physically. But I don’t really know him and I think that making us fall in love at the same time is the best way to make sure no one is in pain” Blaise finished, proud of his new explanation. The Zabini-Weasley twins jumped off their shelves and placed themselves in front of their father.
Potter bites his ear lobe, huffin hot breaths against the blonde’s neck and Draco groaned in pleasure. Harry slowly slid his hands against the beautiful body under him and caressed the amazing pale skin.
“Basically, these are objects in which you can lock a piece of your soul” Harry's eyes widened as he opened his mouth.
“What do you know exactly?” Draco asked, particularly irritated by the events and his soulmates mad at him.
“How are you, Uncle Harry?” Then three people ran down the stairs and smiled broadly as all eyes turned to them.
And now, he was alone in front of 13 teenagers who were casting spells on him. He saw the triplets clasp their hands together and a wave of red and green magic ran to Harry. His shield burst into pieces when the wave hit him hard and he was thrown into the air. He landed heavily on the ground a few feet away. He made another shield appear around him as he stood up. He saw a new wave coming towards him so he reinforced his shield. Once the wave was gone, cracking the shield, he made it disappear and slammed his hands on the ground. A shock wave spread on the floor, sending the children waltzing in the air.
“If it's an urgent need then” Harry smiled as he accepted the blond's request. The rain did not subside and they were now soaked and Harry had no more blood on him, washed by the rain. Draco slightly opened his lips, letting Harry's tongue penetrate his mouth. Their two tongues intertwined passionately and Draco moaned in Harry's mouth. This sound made the brunette shiver, which ran his hands under the blond's top. Draco's hands were strolling over Harry's chest as the kiss grew.
“We can’t tell you exactly how the war was won, but we can tell you that Daddy literally smashed Voldemort” Lyra said.
Then Harry stopped suddenly, stopping pacing and tearing his hair. He told himself that there was a problem in his problem. He originally thought that he had started falling in love with Draco from the arrival of the children, but the children had arrived three days earlier. Out, Harry knew a minimum and could not fall in love with anyone in just three days, especially not Draco Malfoy. Then he thought silently as he started walking again. The answer seemed obvious as he walked near Draco's bed for the fourth time and get on the bed. He had been in love with Draco for much longer, where perhaps he was only attracted to him.
Draco thought about it for a second. He was tempted, very tempted. This was Harry, the man he’d been in love with for years, and he was telling him he loved Draco. He was saying he was sorry and Draco knew it was the truth because when had Harry ever lied. Harry was the most loyal and caring person Draco knew.
“We all know that, but he doesn’t know Dad” Nathaniel cut him off. “All he sees is that you're hardly ever with him and that you're secret” Draco's eyes widened as he understood the problem and he ran off to their room.
They landed in the middle of the living room. It was like landing in hell. Jordan was lying at their feet and there was blood all over him. Nathaniel was in a fight a few feet away with a tall guy. Ezekiel and alya immediately ran to their brother.
“Believe me, the wonderful memory of having smashed your skull against this pretty wall will make me pass the time” She swallowed hard but the glow of defiance in her eyes only strengthened. The aura of anger around the boy thickened even more as he took her off the wall from a few inches.
“It'll be fine, it'll be fine, you'll be okay, everything will be okay” Draco whispered as Harry lost consciousness. Then, as Draco was lost and watched Harry die slowly, Ezekiel and Nathaniel came running, so fast that Draco was disturbed. They screamed something in their race but he did not understand what they were saying, speaking at the same time.
When Harry had finished his story, Draco looked thoughtful. Harry calmly waited for the blond to finish turning his story around. Blows rang against the door and Hermione returned to the room.
“Look at Emett, he has Harry's hair and his eyes too” Ron looked more closely at Emett and admitted that indeed he looked exactly like Harry. His eyes were exactly the same, it was almost scary.
“Wait, when did you heard Zephir talking in his sleep? He finally agreed to go out with you?” Erin asked hurriedly.
Dumbledore, Minerva, Severus, Sirius, Remus and the nurse entered the infirmary at this moment, leaving no time for Lyra to explain herself. The blonde glanced at Dimitri who was standing on the doorstep. Draco saw him shake his head and disappear as discreetly as possible.
Draco slammed him against the door, which closed completely and a wave spread through the room. Harry pushed the blonde back slightly.
“How? And how do we find these objects?” Harry asked. The triplets chuckled at his eagerness and Erin took charge of the answer.
“It was Draco, of course” Pansy, who had just arrived, replied. Ron blinked instantly and looked at Harry and Draco. He shivered with disgust.
“Could it happen that I feel Draco's emotions?” Hermione raised an eyebrow at the first name agreement.
“Which?” Malfoy almost didn’t answer, but, thinking about it, she was pretty smart and could quite easily understand what the problem was.
“Yes, let's go now” The boy's eyes lit up and Harry laughed. He then went to the door and headed for the Great Hall, hoping to find Draco here for several reasons. First, he felt the first signs of their distance, so he was starting to have a real headache and vertigo would not be long in coming. And secondly, he had two or three things to clear up with him. He slowed down suddenly and almost lost his balance because of his spinning head. He had remained standing only because he had shown great concentration, from the little boy in his arms he could not afford to drop.
“You know who's up, don’t you?” He asked his two blond sons. The two laughed and then nodded in one movement. A scream sounded upstairs and Draco laughed as he recognized Harry's voice.
“A soul mates bond” All the teenagers of that time stared at Nathaniel with round eyes while Ezekiel and Lyra said a simple “Oh yes! That's it”
“And stop crying, you know I hate it” Harry laughed through his tears, squeezing Molly even more against him.
“So? Do you want to sleep here?” He asked with a little cute smile. ‘He’s not cute’ Draco thinks. ‘Stop thinking he’s cute, he’s obviously not’
Harry was walking behind the small, or rather large group, who was heading for the carriages. He shot in a small pebble and sighed again. What was wrong with him? Everything was going well. They were all heading to the Hogwarts Express and then they would all go to Grimmauld Square and would probably spend two awesome weeks. But there was a problem in all of this.
“We’ll teach you” Alya said, shrugging her shoulders and looking right behind Harry’s shoulder. Her brothers both nodded.
“In the chamber of secrets, of course” Harry, Lyra, Erin and the triplets answered in one voice. Draco mumbled something about the damn arrogance of the Malfoys his kids had inherited. Harry laughed at the absurdity of the remark as the children revolted, shouting that they were not arrogant.
“Maybe you’re right but I’m sixteen too so who could understand him better than me?” Harry said as he started to get up.
He couldn’t help but blush, realizing he was now naked in front of Harry. The brown took possession of Draco's lips and he reversed their positions. He kissed the blonde's neck then, sucked the thin skin at his collarbone. He went down even lower after that. He nibbled his nipples one by one and Draco uttered the most exciting moan Harry had ever heard. He then licked the abs finely drawn then he ran his tongue into his navel, then went down again.
“I don’t know, I don’t even know if I'm in love with him. It’s just in case I really am” Ezekiel pinched his nose between two of his fingers and blew.
“Technically, Dad got pregnant while the war was still going on” Ezekiel interjected, looking at his sister as best he could. Draco's eyes widened.
They glared at each other for a moment before the youngest turned to Harry and apologized reluctantly. Harry gave him a smile for acceptance. The boy turned around and went to sit further away. Harry also smiled at the girl to thank her and he finally sat down with his friends. He picked up some food and started eating but stopped after a few seconds. He could almost hear the wheels working in Hermione's head. He raised his head to her and swallowed his food.
“Are you ready for the hard time Molly is going to give us?” Remus asked, helping the three shaking boys to get up. They all laughed, not afraid of having to face the redhead, except perhaps Ron as it was his mother. The four adults had them apparated directly inside the house, in the kitchen as it was time for dinner.
“Are you worried, Malfoy?” Harry was laughing completely now. Malfoy quickly turned to face him, their faces being a few millimeters apart. His cheeks were red with anger and embarrassment, and he glared at Harry. Harry stopped laughing immediately but kept an arrogant smile on his face. The blonde pushed him, not too violently, inside their room and he closed the door behind them. He then slammed Harry against the door, placing his arm against his throat.
“Well, that's a good thing done. But there are other things I need to share with you” Harry sighed slightly. He had just told them that their children from the future were here, and he dared to say that there was something else! As if it was not strange and incredible enough, the Headmaster had to add even more.
Draco kissed the brunette, then licked his nipples, biting them slightly. He went down again, until reaching his cock stretched to the extreme. He took it directly in his mouth without preamble and Harry screamed his pleasure. His fingers twitched in the blond hair as Draco started quick back and forth moves. The Slytherin removed his fingers and mouth as Harry was on the verge of implosion. The brunet grunted but only smiled when he felt the blonde's awesome sex show up at his entrance.
“Oh yeah let's see grandpa and grandma!” Nathaniel exclaimed. Soon the whole Malfoy-Potter family wanted to go there, so Harry granted permission only if he and Draco accompanied them. They went to the teachers' table, accompanied by Dimitri, Alarik, Erika and Seth.
“You want me to calm down?” Malfoy yelled with a slightly hysterical voice, louder than usual. Ron entered at that moment, violently opening the door.
“This is the Black’s house” Draco mentally stated. Harry mentally nodded. Lesath then came down from Draco's arms and pulled at Harry's sleeve while Molly was setting the rules. Harry knelt in front of his son and whispered.
“Oh really?” Draco took it as a challenge and tried to catch Harry. The latter dodged him and Draco found himself once again under water. He grabbed Harry's ankles and made him fall.
“In the flesh” Dimitri replied with a wink. Jordan laughed as he saw him surrounded by four blondes.
He heard a knock on the door. Probably his mother, he thought vaguely, because really they were only two in this house.
“You’re beautiful… and your hair are the softest” he said in the sleepy voice drunk men always have. Nathaniel smiled at him.
Harry refused to move and he sucked one last time with an obscene sucking sound. The blonde arched one last time and came into Harry’s mouth in a hoarse and noisy scream. Harry was quite proud of him, since he had not chocked himself. The blonde was panting and his eyes were closed. Harry then went back to Draco's face, placing small kisses all over his body. When he finally put his lips on the blonde's one, the latter opened his eyes.
Draco wasn’t really happy about what she just said and she knew it. He should probably listen to her, go to Hogwarts, graduate and then never think or talk to Potter ever again. But, as his stomach twisted at the thought, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this was wrong. He did not want to ignore Potter and forget entirely about him.
“Joris shouted at her against the wall and Ezekiel threatened her with death and almost killed her but she agreed to speak. Now Alya seems to be busy making her talk” Harry announced shrugging his shoulders again.
“Is there something that makes you laugh?” Harry bit his cheek violently so as not to burst out laughing under the blonde's new comment.
“We wait here until she wakes up” Dimitri said, looking just about to kill this girl with his bare hands.
“Is my brother still sleeping?” Zachady asked Ezekiel as they crossed the hall once he was deserted.
“Get up, we're all waiting for you in the living room” Then on these words she left and closed the door. Harry turned his head to Malfoy, who was rubbing his wrist with his hand while grimacing.
“There's something behind this wall” Nathaniel interjected, suddenly appearing next to them. Harry slid his hand into his son's hair to calm him down while turning his head to Nathaniel.
“Look, we're going to have to live with each other for a while, so I thought we could make peace, somehow.” He finally let go of the blonde's wrist and held out his hand. They looked into each other's eyes, both remembering a similar scene five years earlier. Malfoy's lips stretched into an ironic smirk, then he sneered.
“What?” Harry asked him. Draco straightened hardly, until he found himself in front of Harry. The brown man found his half-asleep face truly adorable. The blond glared at him.
“We could send my father to distract her and during this time, you and I are discreetly stealing the necklace”
“I hope for you that I didn’t damage my beautiful body to carry all of your children” Harry looked angry.
“Well, are you still mad and going to yell at me for nothing?” Harry asked, still standing near the door. Draco sat up cross-legged in the middle of the bed, looking at his hands that were playing with the sheets under him.
“Are you OK?” Draco asked. Harry nodded slowly and tried to get up. Draco had to support him so that he didn’t collapse. The two boys opened their eyes wide as they saw the others go to clear debris from Emett, Skott, Isaak, Jackson and Jasper.
“I was forced Harry, your lives are at stake as long as we don’t know any more about this” Harry didn’t know what to answer to this argument.
“Yes really. Listen Draco, for me you're not the submissive and I'm the dominant. We’re equal. So yes, it was me who took you the first time and all the following times but now I want it to change” Draco was turned upside down by Harry's little speech and he smiled before kissing Harry again.
Unfortunately, that was not the case at all. Several weeks had passed and Harry had really moved closer to his children. He had also discovered new facets of the blond. The latter was really attentive to Harry and the brunette found it really adorable.
“It's due to your bond. In fact, the link has increased your powers considerably and I don’t really know what caused it but you could have children. Then for others, it's more complicated. When you became pregnant, it upset your magic even more and the people close to you were able to get pregnant too. That explains that we are all grouped by age group” Harry was now impressed, thanks to him his gay friends could natural children and he was proud enough to have made them this gift. Harry was still wondering something.
“We cannot tell you” The blonde, Nathaniel, said. Hermione gave him a slight smile, as if to say ‘It doesn’t matter’. A soothing silence settled between them and Ron leaned against the couch. The silence lingered for a moment, then Hermione broke it.
“Yes, Grandma, I am” Molly's eyes widened and then she smiled at Emett. She then glanced at Draco, who was holding Lesath, and at Blaise, Theo, and Pansy, who were standing next to the blonde.
That wasn’t exactly the truth, he had packed his trunk at least two times but had put everything away each time. He just couldn’t do it.
He did not lose hope, however, and thought he might do something. He decided to follow his instinct. He rolled up his sleeves and literally tore off Harry's clothes. The brunette was then shirtless and Draco panicked even more, if it was possible, when he saw all the blood flowing from the wound.
“Yes, that's it, so they don’t look for them and don’t destroy them because of us” Nathaniel sighed.
"Stop panicking like that and come down, I'm sure you're gorgeous" Draco's voice encouraged him. Harry allowed himself a smile and went down the few steps that separated him from the entrance hall and thus from the gigantic living room where their little party would take place. Draco suddenly appeared in front of him as he stepped on the floor of the hallway. Draco smiled as he wrapped Harry within his arms. He kissed Harry's neck, licked the lobe of his ear and whispered.
The redhead's eyes widened and she hurriedly left the room after casting a spell to rebuild the plates.
He watched the scene, trying to understand why he had been so drowsy so soon. He saw Lyra and Nathaniel glaring at each other as Jordan was lying on the bed, taking advantage of the silence to try and get back to sleep. Joris then stepped towards them, grabbed the blonde by the waist and lifted her off the ground. He passed her over his shoulder like a bag of potato and came out of the room as quickly as he had arrived, determined to go back to sleep.
“So, you're telling me that you want to be helped to make Uncle Ron fall in love with you so that if one day you fall in love with him, he falls right into your arms”
“Wait, let me summarize” Draco started, lying on one of the living room couch, Harry astride him. “We need to get a necklace from around Umbridge’s neck which is actually a horcrux to destroy you-know-who”
“Come on” Harry whispered, lifting Draco in his arms and going to put him in a bed. He waited for the blond to fall asleep before leaving the room. He approached Emett's bed, where about twenty people were grouped together.
“By the way, this is Emett, he's my little brother" Nathaniel told them, remembering that his brother had not been introduced. Hermione did not give anyone time to answer anything.
“Yes, some of us are on Hogwarts teams but we have created teams by family to play with each other” Jordan explained. The adults were astonished.
“Wait, I want to give you your gift before” Draco nodded and walked out of the room under the astonished eyes of Harry. He came back almost instantly holding a rectangular box in one of his hands.
“We're coming, darling.” Hermione told him, coming to take him in her arms. They then all went out of the room and they saw not far away, Harry and Draco ready to jump on each other. They were facing each other and their faces were very close. Harry had his fists clenched and Draco clenched and convulsively unclenched his fists. Harry might be slightly smaller, but he looked just as threatening. They said no word but the argument went through their eyes and seemed particularly violent.
“Horcruxes? What is that?” Harry finally asked. As Dumbledore went into long, painful explanations, Draco raised his hand to tell him to shut up and explain himself. After all, we were a Death Eater's son or we were not.
In the room they had just left, Draco was struggling to find the doorknob while his tongue danced with Harry's. He finally got tired of it so he pretended to push the doors with one of his hands, without touching them, and the doors opened automatically. He pushed Harry inside and closed them with a kick. Harry looked at him laughing as he saw him. To avenge the mockery, Draco lifted Harry up and threw him on the bed. He straddled the brown man and looked into his eyes. He placed his hands on Harry's cheeks and leaned over to kiss Harry's smiling lips. He straightened up and removed Harry's glasses, which he put on the bedside table.
“Mr. Malfoy, take Mr. Potter to the infirmary” Draco felt Harry's body crumble over him as he went to meet his godfather. Severus shot him an urgent look and Draco got up, Harry in his arms, bride-style.
“It's going to hurt” He warned Harry before grabbing the wooden handle and tugging at it. Harry's scream froze his blood, more so. He tossed the piece of wood away and in front of the size of the piece, the crowd in the bleachers uttered a new cry of horror. Harry choked on himself even more and Draco looked in horror at all the blood flowing from the wound. With trembling hands he tried to contain the blood but quickly his hands were covered and sobs escaped his throat.
In the next picture, you could see Draco with his cold face, which quickly became a big smile when Harry passed in his vision. On another, he saw them, Draco and himself laughing. He stayed a long time in front of the image of them kissing in the astronomy tower for their first kiss. He then saw a kind of family photo, where all the people living in their apartment at Hogwarts were gathered. He then saw several shots of all the children, especially during the Quidditch match.
“You were fighting, I panicked” Joris said back, his voice shaking a bit. A few tears fell from her eyes and Harry took a step toward her to comfort her but Joris was on his knees in front of her instantly. He then wrapped his arms around her.
“Well, we’re not” Alya answered with a smile. “Our Dads are the most powerful in this room but not enough for this wall”
“You know that's not what I meant to say” Harry smiled at him, knowing full well that he was not in the same category as Blaise. Harry then mentally asked Draco if he could send Hermione to him.
“Just wish it ardently, keeping your hands on him” the newcomer advised him. Nathaniel put Harry's head on his lap and he finally stopped choking on his own blood.
“That's exactly our kind of party, with alcohol, Ezé, especially for the new year” The blond looked offended and then pouted, clearly indicating that they were not wrong. Harry dropped to the ground and he blushed under the tender look that Draco offered him. Harry closed his eyes again, feeling tired.
When Hermione returned to the common room, she found them playing wizard’s chess. Ron was unbeatable and Harry was beginning to despair, so when he saw her coming through the door, he didn’t miss this opportunity. He jumped to his feet and ran to Hermione, quickly imitated by Ron. That made Hermione laugh, but she refused to tell them anything yet. She stepped forward and sat on one of the chairs, the two boys around her. She threw a bubble of silence of her invention so that nobody hears their conversation.
“It's happening, right? He’s falling for him” Hermione turned her head toward her and followed her gaze to Harry. And she saw the gleam in the green eyes that were watching Draco and she understood. Harry was falling for the blond. She smiled, the way Harry looked at Draco was absolutely beautiful to see. Draco suddenly stopped laughing and stared at Harry with a disgusted look.
“Dad is” The boy said in a sob. Harry looked up at Draco who was watching from a feet away. He looked regretful and a bit awkward.
“Dumbledore asked me to come back for a children's story and took the opportunity to rehire me for the job”
Indeed, the latter began to attack more and more often. The second time it happened, they were in potions. When the vision came to his mind, Harry had a headache so hard he fell off his chair. He found himself on his knees on the ground and began screaming when Voldemort put more power into his attack. Draco rushed at him and slid to the ground in front of him. Harry's gaze was vague so Draco made the first thing that went through his head, he kissed him. He didn’t return the kiss right away, then finally he returned it desperately as if Draco was his lifeline in the ocean of terror in which Voldemort plunged him. Draco put the palms of his hands on Harry's cheeks and gently pushed him away.
“If you don’t eat exactly three slices of bread with your three favorite jams soaked in your sweet milk coffee you're in a bad mood.” Malfoy cut him off. Harry stopped short and the blond bumped into him, too immersed in his tirade to notice his effect. Harry turned to face him, still holding Malfoy's hand between his fingers. Besides, perhaps he should start calling him by his first name.
“It was during a discussion between brothers, it is only me, Ezé and Zéniel who knows” Nathaniel answered. She looked angry and he pulled childishly his tongue at her.
Then, after a while, Draco had enough, so he grabbed Harry’s hips and slammed him against the mattress. He then began to come and go in Harry and he began to shout his name every time he hit his prostate. Harry grabbed his hair with one hand to kiss him while the second scratched his back. Harry then cried in a hoarse scream, and Draco followed him closely, feeling the brunette’s flesh tighten around his penis. He fell into a long groan on Harry, who immediately wrapped his arms around him. He slowly withdrew from the brown and threw them a cleaning spell. He snuggled into Harry’s arms again and they both fell asleep, even though it was four o'clock in the afternoon.
“No, I have already my own room” Draco answered as he sat up and looked across the room looking for his clothes. Harry looked at his arse when he got up but he doesn’t see it.
But he thought the most shocking must have been to see Draco with one hand in Harry's hair and the other on his ass. The blond suddenly blushed as he realized it and he pulled his hand away. Then finally the twins relaxed and burst out laughing.
“Lucius and I thought you'd like to fly around a bit” The adult told them. Harry and Draco frowned, where did that proximity came from?
“What happened there, damn it?” Jordan breathed. On the floor, we could see Harry and Lucius, the triplets no longer looked the same. Alya had golden blond hair and her eyes were green, Ezekiel had black hair and his eyes were still green and Nathaniel had brown hair and his eyes still green. Draco wondered what was happening when he saw Ezekiel stand up, his hands full of blood. He glanced at Harry, who had not stood up yet next to Ezekiel and before he could think about it, he rushed to his side. He turned him over so that he was on his back and saw with relief his eyes open slightly.
“For Slytherin, Ezekiel is the seeker, Zach the keeper, Joris and his twin brother are the beaters, and Alarik, Jordan, and Neville's son are the chasers” Lyra taught them.
“Instead of bickering about your family's purity of blood, think about more important things.” Malfoy seemed to go off in his thoughts, looking for what was so important to make Hermione react as much. He seemed to find it.
“What’s horrible?” Harry asked, putting on his T-shirt that the blonde had thrown at him. Ron didn’t answer, staring at the floor and Draco realized he didn’t want to talk about it in front of him. He leaned over and kissed Harry before leaving the room massaging his lower back. Harry frowned as he saw him, wondering why.
“Let's go eat” He said, getting up. The eight children followed him to the living room. Hermione ran to them, followed by Theo, who seemed to take a certain pleasure in being with the pretty brunette.
“Are you feeling better?” He asked his blond father. Draco hurried to reassure him, seeing the worry in the boy's gray eyes.
“You guess well” whispered a male voice behind them. The two sisters jumped and turned, widening their eyes, having recognized the voice.
“I understand better” He laughed. Harry stood up and opened the door before Draco could hurt the poor Dimitri. The latter didn’t seem impressed. Harry grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him inside the room.
“I know what you're going to say, you're going to say that our daughter and Hermione and Theo's were kidnapped and we can’t think about that right now, but they're fine Harry. And to be honest, my hormones have been boiling for almost a month and I really want you” Harry blushed unconsciously and he could do nothing but moan as Draco nibbled the lobe of his ear.
“What if you continue this conversation later and elsewhere? For example, I don’t know, somewhere else than in the middle of the Great Hall” She whispered. Harry turned his gaze and could see that absolutely the whole room was watching them. He released Malfoy then and turned to face the table. He walked over it and settled in his place, between Hermione and Ginny.
“I am” Harry shouted at him. Draco blushed violently and slammed a bludger near him. Blaise and Theo chuckled and Harry smiled with all his teeth. The latter finally began to look at how the game unfolded as the rain began to fall. He could see how Ron's eldest was a good keeper. Talking about his red-haired friend, Harry thought maybe he should have a conversation with him, it had been a while since he had spoken to him. He could also see all the complicity of the two blond brothers, these two really were an excellent pair and gave a hard time to Blaise, Ginny and Pansy.
“Try to make an effort, okay? They can be friendly and it's important for our cohabitation that the atmosphere is relaxed” Draco chuckled slightly as he recognized Hermione's words and Ron glared at him. Draco tried to hold back his laughter but it was not an easy task. Harry, understanding where his hilarity came from, laughed too and it was the start of a big laugh for both boys. Ron looked vexed and took an angry step up the stairs and took refuge in his room. The hilarity of the boys redoubled when they saw him climbing the stairs and soon all eyes turned to them, wondering why they laughed so much. Lesath was soon in front of them, so they calmed down.
“I'll go, see you later?” Harry nodded and then slightly kissed Draco. He got up and went out of the room. Ron chuckled and Harry took his eyes off his blonde's ass to cast a questioning look at his friend. The latter tried to give him a small smile, a sign that he was trying to be forgiven for being a complete git.
“Let me in, or I swear I’ll kill you!” He heard Draco scream from outside the apartment. Harry laughed frankly.
He also groaned as Harry put his hands on his buttocks and pressed him even harder and their erections rubbed against each other. Draco wanted more, definitely more and if he trusted the groans of the brown lying under him, he wasn’t the only one. Harry then slid his hands under the blonde's boxer and stroked his buttocks. Draco shivered and his hand on the Gryffindor's cock became more pressing. Harry gasped in response and gently slid Draco's boxer down his legs.
Outside the room, the six children were asleep too. In fact, the only two people awake in this big apartment were Blaise and his son, Zachady.
“His eyes! They’re the same as Ron’s!” While saying that, she had moved closer to Jordan and now had his face a few inches from the man's. He was petrified and seemed to panic slightly. At the sight of Hermione getting dangerously close to Jordan, the blond passed one of his arms around his shoulders. Harry smiled when he saw him do it, which he quickly hid. Hermione took her place again and still stared at the two boys, but Nathaniel was slightly more detailed this time. Jordan grabbed the blonde's knee and slowly moved his hand up and down his thigh. Harry repressed another smile in front of this show of affection. He didn’t know who these two boys were but he found them adorable. He envied them too, for a reason he didn’t know. Hermione got up suddenly and walked away from them in a few steps, she was obviously thinking.
“You want me to believe that you touched that wall and that another wall just blew up? Draco got up, threatening the boys to his full height. Harry rushed past him and tried to pull him back.
“I ... uh ...” Draco stammered. Harry turned around, ready to go. Draco didn’t know what to do to stop him so he let Harry go through the door.
As he tried to nibble Draco's neck and quickly move back and forth on his tense erection, he slowly slipped a finger inside him. Draco tensed immediately. However he relaxed quickly thanks to the caress of Harry on her sex. Harry gently moved his finger, starting a slow back and forth. When Draco was completely relaxed and began to moan, Harry introduced a second finger. Draco tensed again but Harry quickly found his prostate and Draco was only screaming and moaning after that.
Draco caught him before he could fall into Pansy’s roses bushes. He put an arm around Harry’s waist to stabilize him before looking down at him.
“Make him suffer and I'll kill you” Draco burst out laughing but seeing the brunette's more than serious look, he calmed down and nodded. She then extended a hand to him and he squeezed it with a smile. Ron then ran.
Draco handed him his package first. The object was wrapped in a silver paper. Harry unwrapped his gift as delicately as possible. He ended up with a kind of photo album in his hands. He slowly opened the first page and saw words written in Draco's handwriting: Harry James Malfoy-Potter. Harry smiled at his name and he turned the next page.
“Oh! They have THE face, look” Nathaniel told Ezekiel. All the children looked at them and big smiles appeared on their faces.
“Yes, he's coming.” But the kid had not heard him. Lesath's eyes widened and a big smile was now blocking his face. He literally jumped from the brunette's knees and ran towards Malfoy and his friends. Harry, in a paternal outburst that he didn’t know he had, tried to hold back the little one.
“He can read minds” Nathaniel explained. Harry was simply stunned, but he still grabbed the hand his son held out to him.
“I love you too” He replied, kissing his lips lightly. Harry cast a spell to clean them and then lay down next to Draco, who immediately went to stick his back to his chest. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and wished him a good night kissing his neck one last time.
“Lena is Ginny and Pansy’s daughter, Emerik’s Luna and Neville’s son and Ethan is Dean and Seamus’” His twin completed.
“So, if you want to have fun on a private Quidditch pitch, you get up and come with us before Molly gets up and sequestrates you for another day”
“He is denying us, right?” The blond laughed, shaking his head. Joris and Lyra finally came back to the group and the two blondes hugged each other. The youngest girl looked at the hands of her fathers.
He screamed in frustration as he buried his head in a pillow. He had no real problem about seeing Potter again. In fact, he wanted to see him. But the fact that he may have had a little crush on him since the fifth year was the true problem. He couldn’t have Potter, even if Potter wanted him. Which he didn’t, Draco reminded himself.
“C’mon, love, you need to move” Jordan grumbled again in response as he tightened  his arms around Nathaniel.
“So tell us!” They all looked at Malfoy questioningly, his voice had not been aggressive, he had only seemed impatient and curious. She moved and grabbed Malfoy and Harry's wrists and placed them in a corner of the circle that their strange group was forming. As she walked away, she took Ron with her and placed him next to Zabini. She glanced at the children, all gathered between the two duets.
Sirius stood in front of the living room couch with a tender smile on his lips. On that couch was Draco, who was holding Harry tightly against him. Both of them were sleeping soundly, and that didn’t really surprise Sirius at the early morning hour. He looked at them carefully and his smile widened. Draco had his back against the back of the couch, holding Harry against him, their fingers were intertwined at the brown's belly and their legs were perfectly tangled as well. Sirius gently put his hand on Harry's shoulder and the two boys opened their eyes at once in a way that Sirius found scary. Sirius jumped and almost fell on the coffee table made of glass behind him, but he was held back by something invisible. The two boys straightened together.
"There are six of them here, if you add Nathaniel and Ezekiel's sister, that's seven, plus the two pairs of twins we get to eleven" Harry explained mentally. As Draco tried to record this new, Sirius frowned.
“So I said, Jordan and Irina and Isallys. It's Eleanor and Joris, my children. Then we have Dimitri, Alarik and Erika, your children Sirius. And finally, Seth, your son Remus” The older two seemed completely lost. Sirius stared at Alarik and suddenly he blinked, seeming to realize the identity of his other parent.
“It looks like there's a family reunion here” He smiled charmingly at the gathering and Lyra ran out to him, throwing herself on his neck.
“We’re thinking that because it’s really obvious, darling” Pansy said as Draco started to walk by the room, thinking about all these things.
