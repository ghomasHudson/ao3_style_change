things after his shower, and his hair is in an uncombed, messy topknot, little bunches of hair slipping free and falling along his face and down his shoulders. Despite his Veela-blood, he knows his skin looks worn and that he has bags under his eyes after his mostly disturbed sleep the previous night. He also feels shamefully vain as he stands there fretting about his appearance instead of the hundred other things he should be fretting about.
“I have a feeling you’re going to answer that yourself so pray continue, O' Wise Arse.”
“Now’s when you say it, you know,” he murmurs drowsily against Harry’s forehead. “Choose your moments wisely, Potter.”
“The baby,” Harry corrects automatically, his mind on the question he’s been itching to ask for over twenty-four hours now. “Hermione...” he says slowly, not looking directly at her. “Will the... Will it be...you know...?” Hermione’s watching him with a knowing glint in her eyes, but waits patiently until Harry blurts out, “Will it be like me? Will it be infected?”
Genuine, merry, belly laughter that has Harry staring transfixed, helpless and
born to— just shut your stupid face.”
Potter is already waiting for him, staring at the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy and absently fiddling with his wand, rolling it between the fingers of one hand. He’s done away with his school robes, as is his wont, and wears only the white shirt and grey trousers, house tie stuffed into his breast pocket. Behind him, across the corridor, there’s already a door in the wall.
“Young Master Black,” it croaks, using the same tone and tune that one would while chiming a glib, ‘

specimen of a cock as it stands there, dripping onto Potter’s abs. Draco can’t claim to have seen a large number or a wide variety of cocks but this, Potter’s, is not just the biggest he’d seen but is quite definitely the most beautiful.
“Better?” she asks gently, pressing a kiss to his belly. Scorpius squirms with a giggle, wiping his nose on his sleeve.
He couldn’t look at the bruise on his chest without remembering how it had throbbed under Malfoy’s weight as he lay on his chest, whimpering and overwhelmed. He chewed lightly over the healed nick on his lip, remembering the feel of Malfoy’s mouth, fever-hot and eager, against it. Hell, he couldn’t wank in the shower anymore without fantasising about being inside Malfoy again.
“Your glasses are gone,” Draco says before he can stop himself.
And then Draco decided, fuck it, he was going to risk it.
“I do.” Malfoy seemed slightly smug as he added, “Scorpius has a little knife of his own that’s made of gold too.”
“What world have you been living in?!”
By the fifth evening, Harry was rather desperate to just fucking
“I’m going to fucking kill you, you bastard,” Draco gritted at Weasley, hands balled into fists.
Two men stand side by side in the photograph on the other side, the one on the left bearing such a stark resemblance to Potter that Draco does a double take. He has the same jet black, chaotic pile of hair, the same square jaw and that familiar, unexpectedly handsome grin that Draco’s become rather
“Erm...” Harry, scratches his ear, more than certain that he has the wrong place. “A... A friend – Draco Malfoy? I don’t think I have the right place, though.”
The sky outside was the deep purple of late dusk and over the rooftops of Godric’s Hollow gathered a pitch black, completely opaque cloud.
“Oh my
here!”
Malfoy blinked at him, looking around them once in confusion before turning back to him, his expression suddenly changing as Harry tilted his chin up and leaned closer.
To Draco’s quiet horror, he is not annoyed by it at all, as he might have believed he would be to have a keen-eyed, fidgety, not to mention ruggedly (

Malfoy didn’t look surprised to see Harry. When Harry bolted over and carefully turned Malfoy onto his back, Malfoy looked absolutely livid.

Releasing Draco’s cock for a moment, Potter shoves Draco’s boxers down the curve of his arse, pulling his fingers out of Draco’s mouth and bringing them, dripping wet, to his crease. Draco is soft and loose from when they’d fucked before lunch and Potter’s fingers slip right in with a shameful ease, his palm pressed up against Draco’s cleft as he digs around and immediately locates his prostate.
“Ron,” called Granger pointedly.
Draco’s bellow is heard even over the deafening, thumping music and Ron’s head snaps around, one long arm lifting in greeting as he fights his way through the packed dance floor over to the semi-circular booth we’ve secured at the back of the enormous club.
“This is my home,” Malfoy says, still using that same flat voice. “These are my parents. This is where I belong. Why would I live with you anymore?”
in front of
Unable to read anything in his expression, Harry stared back. Even devoid of conscious emotion, Malfoy’s countenance bore a certain hostility, pale eyes like razors. Harry supposed that to those unused to him, Malfoy might come across as slightly unsettling; frightening even. But he knew Malfoy to be all bark and no bite. He couldn’t find it in himself to be afraid of him; or be worried about him in any way at all.
while you’re around,” he laments, pushing his face back into the curve of Draco’s neck, pressing sloppy, wet kisses there as Draco tries not to pass out.
“What can I say?” he drawls airily, “The opportunity was too good to pass up.”

“Oh, please,” Potter had scoffed, turning to him, “Like you’d have accepted them without a barbed comment or two.”
“Hey, we’ve barely snogged today!” Potter says with a faint laugh that promptly dies out when Draco glares. “We won’t snog anymore during practice, okay?”
I can’t be arsed to come up with a believable excuse. “Because I don’t want to.”
that—”
The moment he opens the double doors and leads Malfoy into his appointed room, he turns around to see Malfoy’s reaction, pleased at the way Malfoy’s eyes go huge and his pink lips part, the wonder on his face making Harry’s stomach flutter happily.
“You’re very welcome, Scorpius. I hope you enjoy the Jaffa Cakes.”
“I don’t
“I can’t.” Harry’s voice broke and choked off. “I—I don’t know where to look.”

Malfoy snorts messily, voice thick with snot and tears as he scoffs, “
!” Draco shouts at once, curling his fingers around the cool brass of the handle again, pushing himself up to full height. “I—I meant that I’m too fat to remain standing after two back-to-back orgasms,” he says quickly, pairing it with a wry smirk and a quirked brow.
Draco grins bashfully, inhaling with his nose buried in Harry’s hair. His own hair is being gently finger-combed by Harry, long, loving strokes from root to tip, making Draco sink further into the ever intensifying lassitude that’s setting in.
want to admit it. “Some trick it’s going to be, Potter, squeezing yourself to fit in there,” he says dryly, darting him a glance, raising an eyebrow.
Draco turned to see Moody hopping on the spot while looking up at the fridge that had, thankfully, not crashed back to the ground as Draco had been busy getting engaged to the guy he’d loved since he was fourteen.
Mouth still too full to answer, Draco nods vigorously, hair falling onto his face, cheeks red with mortification even as he tries to return Potter’s watery little smile. Squeezing his hand once more, Potter finally releases it, leaning back to pick up his fork again, shooting bright little smiles at Draco as he slowly finishes chewing half a plateful of food at once.
“Would you...care to maybe stay? For dinner, I mean,” Potter hurriedly adds. “Here—for the—for dinner—eating— purposes...”
“Turn over for me,” he replied huskily, not bothering to wait for Draco to comply, instead just grabbing his hips and unceremoniously flipping him over.
“I—I don’t under
“Malfoy, I got worried,” Harry says, taking half a step towards him. “I just—I told you I want to be... I want to stay in touch, right? I just...got worried,” he repeats, staring desperately at Malfoy whose striking features are stained blotchy red with anger. “I’m sorry I forced my way in, alright? I just wanted to make sure you’re okay.”
He’s bracing himself for Potter to look sad if not angry but Potter just shrugs one shoulder, mouth curling up on one side as he pushes his scrambled eggs around his plate. “I mean, sure,” he says carelessly. “I loved Quidditch right from the very first time I learnt how to play. It’s one of the few things I was naturally good at,” he adds, chuckling when Draco narrows his eyes playfully at him across the table.
Granger stares at him with her mouth open for a full thirty seconds and Draco comes very close to standing up and clobbering her over the head with his chair.
“Okay. Stay here. Sit down. Here, let me soften up the ground for you too. There. Warming charms? There you go. Huddle close. Watch Lily, all right? I’ll be right back. Be brave.”
The boy looked so pitifully confused, so desperate for more information, that Harry, for a moment, wanted to burst into tears right along with him.
“For fuck’s sake, Malfoy, what the fuck do you want?” Ron demands rudely, slamming a fist on his desk, his own mug of tea rattling noisily.
Face red, eyes firm on the floor, Malfoy keeps perfectly still as Hermione, perfectly casual and professional for her part, briskly makes a small incision below the crook of his elbow, collects a small smear of his blood in a vial, and heals the cut with a neat tap of her wand, pulling Malfoy’s sleeve back down after.
was in there the whole time; me, Harry. So, it was just the matter of holding onto that bit of my consciousness and with each transformation...that bit of me got stronger and—” he suddenly snorts playfully. “It’s like taming a pet,” he says, grinning and looking rather proud of his ridiculous analogy.
The blue flannel blanket was there, bundled up with a cosy dip in the centre. Strewn around were about half a dozen of the soft, highly absorbent kitchen towels he and Harry had bought when they’d moved in together and still favoured, a handful of dish sponges in various states of deterioration and a discoloured pillow cover. There was also Moody, standing on his hind legs, dooking and emitting shrill shrieks of fury at losing his designer loot.
Across the clearing, Scorpius was still asleep too. Malfoy, by the look of it, hadn’t moved at all. He still sat against the tree, his sword in his lap.
“Thank you, Scorpius,” said Harry.
Ginny screamed something and Harry looked around. Albus was cowering, crouched over with his head in his arms, half-hidden behind the curtains. James was standing in front of him as two dementors sailed towards them. James’ face was tear streaked but his brown eyes blazed with something fierce.

Moody squeaked softly and pressed his pink, damp little snout to Draco’s cheek.
me a second?” Harry hisses, finally releasing the punishing grip around his cock and lining up once more.
There’s a dull, grating sound of wood on flagstones behind Harry and when he whips around, Malfoy is standing there, clutching hard at a chair he’s dragged out for support, grey eyes huge and filled with horrified fury, face whiter than parchment.
“Who pissed in
“Wait--!” Harry scrabbled around wildly for Malfoy’s wand, finding it beneath his perfectly round arse. He switched it to his right hand and blindly threw out privacy spells followed by a silencing spell. Dropping it somewhere behind the pillows, Harry looked down just in time to see a drop of his blood plop down onto Malfoy’s cheek. Malfoy, wide eyed, leaned up and ran his tongue slowly over Harry’s lip, lapping at the blood and then licking his own lips clean.
“Weasley,” Draco pins him with a glare, “did you come here with the sole intention of
“No.”
off, Potter, I fucking
“Shit,” Draco wheezes when he finally manages to wrench his mouth free, gasping up at the ceiling. Potter is still inside him though his body is angled awkwardly so that he’s half on his side and half on Draco, carefully avoiding Draco’s belly, and he presses small, wonderfully ticklish kisses along Draco’s throat.
, but an acceptable counter-manoeuvre, Malfoy,” Fox drawls, before clapping his hands together in a single, jarring smack that rings off the walls. “Alright, that’s it for today. Get your lazy arses out of here. See you next week.”
I shut him up with my mouth, sucking on his upper lip before nipping at it and sending my tongue into his mouth, teasing the roof with barely there brushes. He’s holding me tight enough that it’s a tiny bit painful and it feels delicious.
like the other encounters Harry’s had in the past couple of weeks.
Malfoy finally looks up at him, looking angry and bewildered and wary all once. “What’s your game, Potter?” he asks, low and upset.
The smell of Malfoy’s sweat and arousal is slowly fading to the background as the fruity sweetness of his scent rises up into the air again, mingling pleasantly with the smell of damp earth. Harry breathes in deeply as Malfoy’s soft snores start to sound, Harry’s clothes feeling cool against his grimy, overheated skin, his cock noticeably lighter around the base already. The savage, demanding force within him is stirring weakly, trying to fight its way back to the forefront even as an effervescent calm builds somewhere around his heart and slowly seeps through him, filling him up, and the control he’d nearly completely lost earlier is right back where he wants it.
What Draco wants is to feel that burning, jealous hatred that had fuelled him through most of his childhood and young adulthood. He wants to peacefully hate Potter and not have Potter ruining everything by being careful and sweet with him. He wants to feel something more than the scorching, merciless shame and embarrassment that fill him every time he looks at Potter and remembers what he symbolises: peace, and love, and courage and freedom.
Harry Potter was exasperatingly impatient and had little regard for finely tailored clothing – Draco now knew several of the school house-elves by name simply because of the innumerable times he’d had to seek one of them out to request them to sew the buttons on his shirt back on. And so when his shirt was carelessly jerked open and he heard what sounded like at least two buttons pinging across the flagstones, Draco just
Draco’s eyes narrowed into slits. “What did you tell all of them when you came after me just now?”
“You’re a hell of a partner,” Harry admits, just as softly. “We’re not known as the best team that the DMLE has for nothing.”
I laugh out loud at the expression on his face and then wince as one thin hand curls firmly in my hair and tugs sharply.
“In what universe do
“You’re here,” Harry whispers stupidly, his throat constricting, his eyes beginning to ache just from looking at Malfoy, so broken and beautiful. “I was so fucking wor— Malfoy, are you okay?”
He’s just strolled into a new werewolf’s house and demanded audience with said werewolf, barely a few hours after the new moon. He has no prejudice towards his fellow magical creatures, but his (limited) knowledge of werewolves was not something he’d boast about, and the fact that this is Harry Potter, who’s specifically known for his magical prowess, a young and likely horrifically strong werewolf, was enough to set Draco’s self-preservation instincts in motion.

him more, ruthlessly licking and teasingly sucking until Draco can feel saliva dripping down his crack. He slides in one finger, and then two, in quick succession, and makes his way straight to Draco’s prostate, flicking at it mercilessly until Draco is screaming into the pillow and striping the bedspread with ribbons of come, collapsing flat onto his front.
He’s very quiet, though.
Probably just to test her patience further, Malfoy doesn’t take the goblet from her for several more seconds, finally snatching it from her and sitting back down heavily, glaring resentfully at the water before gulping it down in one go.

there?”
Draco’s nostrils flare and even though Potter’s demeanour is polite and innocuous, he finds himself struggling to control the urge to bark at him to back off and mind his own fucking business. “No,” he says stiffly, not elaborating.
“I don’t mind checking in with you,” Potter says after a beat of silence. “I don’t really go out much, myself,” he says quickly when Draco shakes his head. “Just running and meetings and lately...you know, shopping for stuff.”

All the things Draco has never felt.

He smiles at me like he always does when he’s truly happy about something, open and unmasked. Then his gaze dips and he carefully traces my collarbones with nimble fingers. “I love you too, you know,” he murmurs under his breath.

“What are you—
could put on one of those too, if you like,” Draco offers calmly. He pulls on a cursory smile as Erickson chortles, the sound rough and gravelly. “How can I help?” he finally asks.
Weasley has to chime in at some point. And here Draco had been so pleased up until this second that he’d managed to go the whole three minutes he’d spent in the room without looking at that red headed prat.
“Yesterday it was that lilac shirt that Lovegood made for me that

any second.
Neither Granger nor he move to pick up the remote and switch channels, so they end up watching the football match Potter had been watching for a good while in surprisingly comfortable silence. When Granger gets up to refresh her drink, she fetches Draco a bottle of butterbeer from the cooler.
“The very same.”
“You’re gorgeous like this, Harry,” Draco sighs, licking a broad swathe up the side of his face, lapping up the sweat there, before pulling back a bit, hands still wound around Harry’s wrists. With a tiny smirk, Draco begins whipping his hips in earnest, riding Harry’s cock with a fierceness that perfectly masks Draco’s own rising desperation. His swollen rim locks around Harry’s slick shaft with every pull-out, his prostate so overstimulated that Draco feels the first stinging of tears behind his eyelids now, Harry’s cockhead carelessly nudging past it on each stroke.
I plan it.
“Ron, grow
“So, what’ve you been up to, eh?” Weasley enquired, shooting a look at Harry that clearly displayed disappointment. “I work at my brother’s shop,” he went on before Draco could even open his mouth to reply. “Y’know? Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes? Yeah, it’s pretty cool. But you know what’s cooler?” he said, leaning forward, eyes very wide. “
“How’d you realise that you could...you know...?”
Draco cuts him off with the most violent kiss he can muster, kissing him so aggressively that suddenly he’s tasting the coppery tang of blood.
“Sir?”
So he just stands there with his mouth slightly open because he’s actively starting to have a silent meltdown. Potter doesn’t say another word but his words hang between them, flashing like a vivid, multicoloured neon sign, their implication as undeniable as unbelievable.
Draco flings his book aside and promptly crawls over to him, smirking as he hears Potter’s breath catch, that charming grin of his slowly evaporating as Draco slips off the sofa and kneels between his legs and runs his hands through the sprinkling of soft, dark hairs on Potter’s thighs.
“This how you usually spend Christmas Eve, Potter?” Malfoy asks, raising his voice over the music as he hands Harry his pint.
Draco rolls his eyes with a huff. “Merlin, Weasley, you’re such a
,” Draco says, shooting him a grin over his shoulder as he drags Scorpius out for a bit before bending down to hook his free arm around his midriff and carrying him, giggling madly, to the bathroom.
Malfoy’s lips twitched but he didn’t quite smile. Slowly he reached for the tea and after a beat, during which Harry stood at glowered at him, he took a sip.
“That’s right, keep it moving!” Draco continues as the mermaid turns away with a flip of her brilliant tail and a long stream of bubbles as she presumably yells inaudibly back at Draco. “Sure, nice try! He’s not into your sort anyway! Where would he even put it, huh?!”
“Oh, do stop feeling sorry for yourself,” he snaps.
“I thought you might like some company in here,” Harry replies blandly, looking vaguely disappointed as Draco shuts the curtain on him and exits the bathroom.
Mostly just trying not to sick up after that, Draco sits there and slowly sips tea as Potter eats his breakfast, the silence between them surprisingly light, more comfortable than Draco would’ve expected it to be after the topics of conversation they’d covered in the immediate and recent past. Potter continues to dart glances at Draco, something that the Veela in him is used to by now, except Potter seems to be...
“Problem?”
trousers?!
“Yes, and I’ll eat your share of cake more than willingly, Father, don’t you worry,” Draco says airily.
Malfoy stares thoughtfully at him. “I’m sure you’d dance if it were with someone you actually fancied.”
Draco wants to hurt him. He wants to stub out his cigarette on Potter’s bare skin. He wants to tackle Potter to the ground and leave him covered in piss and rat shit. He wants to punch his face until it’s swollen and bruised. He wants Potter to
Finally sinking back down, his back hitting the mattress with a soft thump, Draco sobs helplessly, vision blurred to the point where Harry’s nothing more than a blurry shape against the light flooding in from the hallway, his grip on Harry tightening until Harry is pressed up against him, one foot on the floor to leverage his continued, brutish thrusts into Draco, his mouth now moving urgently along Draco’s neck.
Gently dragging Draco’s head back with a fistful of hair, Potter pants down at Draco, eyes wide and dark behind his glasses and lower lip bitten red and plump. It’s not the first time Draco is seeing, touching or even tasting that ruined patch of flesh and skin on Potter’s flank, but Potter still looks as surprised, as shocked, as he had the first time Draco had done it.
But I’m not listening anymore. I’d stopped listening as soon as she’d said ‘dark curse’. Because I know someone who is supremely skilled with dark curses; someone who

“Is this an interrogation, then?”
“Your place smells of moss,” Draco replies, flicking ash off his cigarette.
The rest of the house is not any better than the horrible corridor downstairs and is hardly better lit either, but the room Potter leads him into on the second floor, like the kitchen, is a whole other story.
Draco’s lips twitch. “I know. You’re pants at being discreet.”

Potter juts his chin out, that look of aggravating stubbornness creeping in. “You’re a smart man, Malfoy. What do you
“You remember the attack last night?” he said and James nodded miserably. “Those creatures...dementors...they can steal the soul from your body. And—and they stole Mum’s.”
“And?” she prods gently.

Harry feels Malfoy’s words touch every nerve ending he has, lighting his whole being up like nothing else had in a very long time.
“She’s...back at home.”
someone special.
He’s on his feet and halfway across the pub to the back door almost before he can firmly make up his mind to leave. With every step he takes, he imagines he’s crushing Potter’s nose underfoot again, imagines the satisfying crunch of it breaking like it did all those years ago.
Potter laughs. “And, if I recall correctly, you did have a good time.”
he feels conscious of his nudity?
you I wouldn’t. If that’s what you’re here for, to threaten me into keeping quiet, you’re a piece of shit.”
“Albus, wait—JAMES!”
“Hello, Malfoy,” Hermione says calmly, getting to her feet. “How’ve you been?”
Hermione shuts her file, looking more than a little sorry for him. “I... I told you, Harry, male pregnancies aren’t unheard of among wizards. Plus, it’s possible that the wolf in you played a role here.”
“You’ve had a baby,” Narcissa says quietly. “
Draco doesn’t know whether it’s all the near incessant necking, or whether Harry had genuinely started to feel better after having started on Draco’s Wolfsbane, but he’d definitely noticed a very positive change in Harry in the two or so weeks that they’d been...
Malfoy lasted an impressive twenty-seven minutes. He’d hardly been insouciant along the way; he huffed out several forceful sighs, loudly gnashed his straight white teeth, inadvertently broke not one, but two quills; his expression remained set in an angry moue, his face getting redder and redder until finally, at long last, he slammed his fist down on the table and bared his teeth at Harry with a nearly venomously hissed, “
“I’m always glowing, I’m a Veela,” Malfoy replies arrogantly, putting his feet up and shoving a cushion behind his back.
“OVER HERE!” Harry pointed his wand at the kitchen where the back door had opened to admit another troop of dementors.
“I won’t hesitate to hex you under the table if you’re not nice, Weasley,” he warns Ron.
When he reaches the stands, however, he stops short. Malfoy is rising slowly to his feet, his face stark white and bloodless, cold grey eyes almost flashing sparks as he glares at Harry with a vicious sort of hatred.
!” he growls when Malfoy thrashes under Harry’s frantic hands and mouth, reaching back to clutch at Harry’s hair.
because,
“Nobody but you has the right, Potter,” Malfoy says, shaking his head and stepping forward.
It had been far from pleasurable.
“You get grumpy when you’re hungry,” he presses the chip to my mouth and I stubbornly keep my lips sealed together, glaring at him, “and you’re ugly when you’re grumpy.”
It’s Harry’s bright green gaze that first rises, to meet Draco’s, before Harry slowly pops off his cock, licking his lips and giving him a sly smirk. He wriggles out of his jeans and pants. “That’s not a very frightening threat, just so you know,” he drawls, pressing Draco’s knees further back onto his chest and shuffling forward on his knees. “But seeing as I’m likely to pop within three seconds of being inside you, I guess it won’t hurt to fuck you when you’re already this close.”
“Yes, as a matter of fact,” Malfoy shoots back airily with a mirthless smile of his own. “You see, Father, I’m—”
that Malfoy is aware of being watched by him.
“Because...we’re not ever likely to share something meaningful?” Malfoy’s tone is like that of a question, but he says it flatly, following it up with a derisive huff. “Right,” he says again, “So, since you don’t like to dance or whatever, you won’t mind if I do? Only, I’m two drinks down and I don’t want to waste this brilliant buzz I’ve got going on.” Without waiting for Harry to answer, Malfoy pushes off the bar, not looking behind as he disappears into the crowd.

“I don’t—I mean, would

“And how d’you feel about...

“Oh, this isn’t something he
“Oh, nothing,” Malfoy replied with absolutely unconvincing airiness. “Just surprised to see you here, that’s all.”
Another bunch of people exit the club, this time pausing right at the mouth of the alley, lighting up cigarettes and talking loudly among themselves. Harry doesn’t even bother pausing in his act of taking Malfoy apart completely as Malfoy bites down into one arm to stifle his moans, shuddering under Harry’s ruthless mouth and groping hands.
Malfoy’s quick, sharp inhale is only audible to Harry and that too because of their proximity, and he laughs as Malfoy smacks him loosely on the shoulder. “Bastard.”
Harry sits up, expression warily impassive, but bordering on incredulous anger. “When I transform? Are you mad?”
Malfoy, flushed and sweaty, eyes slightly crossed, mouth wet and gasping open, says, “You didn’t ask the first time, Potter.”

And then Malfoy’s hand is like a vice around his wrist. “I’m coming with you.”
“Yeah...?”
“I think I’ll take your advice and go home.” I offer him a tentative smile even as I’m assaulted by the memory of him undulating gracefully, pink mouth slightly open, eyes half-lidded, with his head thrown back onto Tristan’s shoulder.
The four of them stood outside, the kids as quiet as mice, and Harry strained his ears for a sound of some sort. But there were no rattling breaths and it was not any cooler than it usually was at that time of morning.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “Don’t catch him being very ‘lovely’ to me, though?”
“What’s his
Malfoy shut his eyes, lips thinning.
The party is already busy when I arrive. There are trays of filled champagne flutes floating around. Soft music plays in the background. Parkinson’s heavily decorated Christmas tree occupies one corner, dominating the room with how large and heavily ornate it is. There’s an elaborately loaded buffet table lining one wall. A whole bar has been set up, complete with a very good looking barkeeper whom, I’m sure, Parkinson will be retaining for the whole night once everyone’s left. I recognise nearly everyone I see and there are multiple greetings that I simply wave off.
!” Malfoy’s voice is cracked and sounds like it’s been wrested out his chest. “
Harry walks right up to him, snatches the wand out of his hand and tosses it across the room, grabbing Malfoy by the wrist and drawing him up flush against him, noses inches apart as he whispers, “Say it again. Say it to my face,
, Granger. I’m doing something for him that even a know-it-all pedant like
“You know who I’m staying with right?” Draco asks drily, “I wonder why my blood pressure’s high.”
“OPEN THE DOOR!”
Potter just chuckles. “Well, it’s an open offer,” he tells him. “It’s sort of a useful skill to have, yeah? Sending messages in an emergency and stuff.”
Harry turns his chair around halfway, so he’s able to look Malfoy in the face. “Are you alright?” he asks, voice gravelly.
Malfoy simply blinks once, slow and tired, before leaning his head back against the wall, sighing through his nose.
Weasley, and Harry and I are both
“We have to go back for her,” James said, his voice cracking. “You don’t know if she’s dead, right? Let’s go check.”
Not that Harry even pauses. His erection is downright painful as he pulls it out, more actual pain than pleasure, and Harry is desperate as he slicks his fingers and swipes them against the soft furl of Malfoy’s entrance. “Fuck, please, Malfoy,” he coats his erection liberally and lines up, “please fucking let me, I’m so sorry, oh shit, please--”
“She’s not here,” he said again.
He can hardly stand it now, to watch Malfoy grind against that bloke with the earring, turning around in his arms to press back into him and rock his arse against his groin, arms in the air as the man brazenly yanks Malfoy’s sheer, cream shirt out of his trousers and shoves his hand up inside, stroking his stomach and chest.

The same rumbling sound from earlier sounds from Potter’s throat. “Beholder’s eye, Malfoy,” he says, sounding slightly aggrieved. “Can you—can you put your hair away, please?”
was in charge. Potter lined kisses up Draco’s spine and told him he’s beautiful. Draco asked Potter to shut the fuck up and put his cock to some use.
“Want me to stop?” he asked, managing to sound sincere despite the frantically building heat in his own belly.
“11AM.”
Despite the despondence in Harry’s eyes, his expression is mild and serene as he gives Draco a small smile, sitting on the edge of the bed, Draco standing between his knees and vigorously towelling his hair dry, rubbing the stark black strands with soft terry until they fall in soft clumps around his face. Swiping the same towel through his own hair a few times, Draco tosses it into the hamper before cupping Harry’s upturned face and gently kissing his forehead.
“Come dance,” he grunts. When Malfoy looks surprised he adds, “I think I spotted a bloke from the
Harry laughs quietly, sifting his free hand through Malfoy’s hair, dragging it along the damp roots. Despite the deep exhaustion he can sense settling around his very bones, his thighs and back screaming from overexertion, his head still lightly throbbing from the tinny whistle he’d been blowing as he’d coached all evening, Harry feels wide awake. He feels around behind himself and finds the smooth edge of the book. Just as he’s guiltily contemplating disturbing a half-asleep Malfoy, he stirs against Harry, glancing around over his shoulder and then rolling onto his back, smiling at Harry.
probably still vomit all over your heroic cock if you do that again, Potter.”
“Then why didn’t you?” Draco winds one hand through Harry’s wild mane and tugs, panting lightly as their gazes lock again. “Why haven’t you touched me in so long?”
“Well, Potter,” she said softly, “looks like your rib has mended and set already – still a little fragile though. You will experience some soreness for another day or two – I’ll give you some pain potions to keep on hand for that, and that bruise will yellow and fade out eventually, but other than that you’re perfectly alright now.”
“You just want me to say it again,” I accuse.
Potter is the one who’s half naked under Draco’s questing hands but it is still Draco who’s almost choking with the need to feel more of Potter against him, to feel the press of his body atop him, to taste some more of him. Boldly, he reaches down and strokes the flat of his palm over the ridge of Potter’s cock, the fleece of his joggers soft and worn beneath his hand. Potter
“As my wing man who fucking disappeared on me, I advise you not to finish that sentence,” I say pointedly. He bites his lip on a grin, looking slightly guilty.
Potter looks up, pushing those stupid glasses up his stupidly handsome face again. “What?” he asks stupidly. “Haven’t you read?” he gestures to the mini-library of baby books around them, “All of these mention how the baby can hear us by now; recognise our voices even!”
“Malfoy?” he garbles blindly.
“It’s half past noon,” Draco points out, heaving Lyra higher up his flank and meandering over to the coffee pot. “You could’ve woken me up.”
“Turn off the lights,” Draco murmurs when Harry weaves a hand into his hair and leans in.
“Is... Is that...?”
“I just—” Harry broke away all of a sudden and Draco let his forehead thump onto his shoulder with a tired sigh, reaching back to close his hand over the one Harry had on his arse, holding it firmly in place as he pressed back into it. “I want people to know... you know?”
“Yes, well, they happened to have violated the terms of their acquittal,” Ron says grimly. “They weren’t supposed to leave the country for at least a decade, Harry.”
They’ve visited Granger for two more scheduled visits since their second and on the last one, two days ago, they’d watched their now significantly larger baby wiggle and squirm around as Granger had pointed out each new development, the flexing fingers and toes, the longer limbs, the stronger spine, the way it pulled little faces, and the way it seemed to just
“I think Draco has a few questions he’d like answered first,” Harry says softly, offering Narcissa a small, tight-lipped smile when she looks at him. She smiles back, delicately wiping her eyes with one knuckle. “Good morning, Mrs. Malfoy.”
Potter blinks, looking thrown for a moment. “Tomorrow, seven PM; Room of Requirement,” he says, shoving his bare hands into his pockets and bouncing on the balls of his feet. “We can get in a solid hour before dinner.” He looks rather pleased with himself, Draco thinks, while his own heart vaults itself up his throat.
I jerk bodily, snapping out of my trance, when Simon places three pints on the table. He stares at me in confused wariness as he sits down and winds his arm through mine. Ron is deadpan as he takes a long swig of beer. I feel nothing, suddenly.
With a blunt rustle, the shower curtain is pushed aside and then Harry is stepping in, naked and smirking, eyes gleaming as they rove down Draco’s body, wet and soapy. With a spluttering squeak, Draco skids and almost falls out of the tub.
Harry wants to do it, to bring life to what he’s been feeling for way too long now by saying the words out loud; and it should’ve been easy to do it with the way Malfoy’s looking at him, all traces of anger and hatred replaced by the sort of softness Harry only ever saw in his eyes when they were being intimate.
Malfoy into the flimsy plywood door, wringing helpless cries and shameless demands out of him, until they’d both shuddered with orgasm and Harry had spilled into him for so
“You stole the words right out of my rather talented mouth.” He smirks as I huff exasperatedly. “It’s been four fucking months – move the fuck
, deliciously
Potter’s groan is loud and decadent, a rich timbre that has Draco breaking out in gooseflesh as he tears his t-shirt up over his head one-handed and sinks his teeth into his throat, biting away at the taut chords of his neck. He bucks wildly, mindlessly, until Potter grabs his arse and sets up a slow, hedonistic rut, fucking Draco’s hand, grinding against Draco’s own seeping length.
“Were you hoping I’d regret it?” Potter rasps, his hole clenching shut and blinking open under Draco’s thumbs. “Were you hoping I’d fight you? Kick you away, maybe, and run screaming out of your house?”
“I’ll be just a few minutes,” Hermione tells them, carefully collecting the glowing orb on the palm of one hand, and the vial of blood in the other before bustling out of the room.
Hermione is waving her wand again and then there’s a sudden low, speedy thrumming filling the room, at which point Hermione flashes Harry a quick grin. “That’s a nice, strong heartbeat right there, hear that?”
Harry’s quickly disappearing consciousness informed him that he knew that green cloak.
“That’s not possible.”
“Um,” Hermione fiddles with her chow mein, frowning down at it, “that’s... Well, unexpected. But not unusual!” she adds hurriedly as I hang my head. “Plenty of couples wait a while before...exploring that aspect of their relationship.”
will want for nothing.”
“Are you mad at me for petting your cat, Malfoy?” he asks blandly, standing so close to Draco that Draco’s elbow bumps into Potter’s chest.
– and thrusts it at Harry.
out of touch?” he asks and I want to smack him across the head the way Draco does sometimes. “I mean, I thought you’ve still been keeping tabs on him and stuff seeing as you’re—”
“No, I told him it’s a secret,” Harry said very earnestly.
“Can’t you ever just shut your fat mouth?” asks Harry exasperatedly. “It’s
“Whom will he listen to then?”
, you little shit,” Harry whimpers, squeezing his cock with both hands to force his climax back.
“I just wanted it to be special for us,” I say. I sound emotionless. Cold.
He trailed off as Malfoy’s lips quirked on a tiny smile, continuing to watch him long after he’d dipped his blond head back down to his homework.
Harry looked behind himself. “I bet they’re wherever you found us.”
“Morning, dunderheads.” Draco breezes in and places the box down on my table. “You miss me?”
“Here.” Harry picked up the length of hawthorn and saw the way Malfoy’s eyes widened momentarily – as if he fully expected Harry to run off with it again.
Then, before he can so much as blink, I’ve turned back around, my hand clenched, shoving my fist so hard into his face that I hear a cracking sound as he flies backwards, sprawling onto the floor and lying there, motionless. I see blood on his face in the half a second I spare to glance at him before turning away.
the one strutting about the place waving that thing in everyone’s face – threatening us all with it!”
Ten minutes later, he was sinking down onto his sofa,
Draco’s forehead thumps onto Harry’s shoulder, his hand slipping between the buttons on Harry’s shirt and resting warm and steady over his heart; Harry smells of blood, smoke, dirt and...of them, of Harry and Draco.
in the first place,” Draco’s blurted out before he can change his mind and come up with something more caustic.
I glance at Simon and then look right at Ron. “I—Yeah.”
“Fuck,” Draco breathes under his breath, pressing on fist into his forehead, his other hand clenched in the sheets, his cock twitching once where its lying flat against his body. Harry presses long, lazy kisses onto the fleshy roundness of his arse cheeks, skating his teeth over them playfully, before parting them with his thumbs, his breath shivering over Draco’s crease. “Fuck,” Draco repeats, even softer this time, because it wouldn’t do for him to be screaming already – the way Harry’s going, he’ll likely be at this a while.
“I don’t care.” I feel relief coursing through me because as soon as I say it, I realise I truly mean it. “I don’t care. I don’t give a fuck about them. I love you. And you’re with
Malfoy stepped forward in a manner that instantly shut down all further conversation.
He’s busy licking around his lips when Potter startles him by swiping a thumb across his cheek, wiping away the salty tracks there. He runs it over Draco’s lips and along his jaw and fiddles clumsily with one earlobe.
Harry reaches over and backhands the glass out of Malfoy’s hand, sending it flying over the bar. Malfoy blinks at him in shock as the tinkle of breaking glass sounds, the barest suggestion of a smile on the corners of his pink mouth. “Drink, Malfoy?”
“Here,” a pale hand takes his uninjured arm and Harry feels a warm puff of air against his temple as he’s hauled closer. “Hang on.”
“No. I want to talk to you.”
“I’b really dud with this cold,” he declares irritably, groping around for his handkerchief again, the silver M monogrammed onto the dove grey material standing out brightly before he buries his face in it and blows his nose again. Emerging with a sigh he says, voice less stuffy now, “I’m more than a little disappointed that I haven’t managed to snog some germs into you as well.”
“We’re meeting the git’s boyfriend this Friday,” Ron says, sniggering and nodding towards Draco who’s frowning at me for not having paid attention.
He’s been to Harry’s bedroom just once before. They usually just got right down to business in the living room that they never actually made it up to his bed, but on one occasion, Harry had Disapparated them directly into his room after a date at which point he’d proceeded to spread Draco across his bed, pry his arse open and eat him open with such assiduous intent that when he’d slipped three fingers into Draco twenty minutes later, they’d sunk right in with no resistance whatsoever and Draco had nearly passed out from his ensuing orgasm.

, I wouldn’t be surprised if it had a fat head forever.”
“Reckon this will last?” he asks casually, indicating where Lovegood is dancing, pristine white gown swirling around her as Blaise spins her, glowing luminous and pale in contrast to his gorgeous, nutty brown skin.
“What?” Harry says blankly.
the prat for his bloody lecture on the right way to ‘double her Galleons’.
, the base feeling heavy and too tight. He cries out in pain and alarm when he tries to stop but finds he can’t, his hips seemingly moving quite out of his control even though he’s now simply grinding his prick into Malfoy’s contracting channel without pulling out.
Malfoy swallows hard enough that Harry actually
“Must’ve learnt how to undo the latch,” Harry said, his tone just as odd as his expression.
Malfoy was scorching hot around him, the grip of his arse so unyieldingly tight around Harry’s finger that he was momentarily worried about putting his cock in there. Harry waited two heartbeats and then dragged his finger out slowly, bit by bit, watching the way Malfoy’s mouth fell open, his face half hidden under one arm.
“Busy here!” I heave, breathing out steadily and starting another set.
goes down to the canteen lest he runs into the slightly lascivious lunch-wizard whom Harry had once furtively hit with a Stinging Hex for touching Draco’s hair.
“Accurate assumption,” Draco wheezes, still out of breath from stomping up all the way up to Potter’s office. “Are you mental? What is the meaning of this?!”
“What for?” Malfoy sounded bewildered.
“What the fuck does that even
“No.”
“Is that the problem?” Potter scowls. “Spending one-on-one time with me? You’re afraid I’ll drag you into an empty room, and what? Curse you?”
death would taste like,” he tries to scowl but ends up grinning a little as Draco lifts a hand to cover his own grinning mouth, “I think I’d prefer the painful, brutal transformation that would result if the potion isn’t consumed. I’ve tasted some truly awful potions, Malfoy – do you know what Polyjuice tastes like? I’ve had Polyjuice on two
With a sigh of what sounds like satisfaction, Potter drags his fingers out, making sure to widen them just inside the rim so he can swiftly plunge his tongue back into Draco’s arse as it contracts uncontrollably from the intrusion.
!” Draco howls when Potter’s fingers don’t stop and his mouth descends once more to lick at Draco’s stretched rim around his fingers. “Potter, I—I need a—please, one second,
The silence stretches on for so long that Draco is on the verge of turning around and leaving, already racking his mind for explanations to give Harry if he happened to remember this happening the next day.
“I’m really, really sorry,” I finally say, my voice muffled. “Did I break your nose?”
“Bloody hell, you both weren’t joking.”
“What’s your deal, Potter?” he demands suspiciously. Then he glances down at Harry’s hand still wrapped around his soft cock, lips twisting into a sneer. “You have a problem,” he informs Harry.
Harry didn’t pause to examine the fact that even fifteen years later Malfoy
Potter’s mouth snaps shut and he looks even more confused as he makes a vague, noncommittal sound, shrugging lightly. “I...guess?”
“How could you
Scorpius beamed. “Oh, but of course. I know about them too. Albus Severus and I are the same age. Your older son, of course, is three years our senior. Your daughter is Lily Luna and she’s three.”
“They don’t fucking exist, you nutter, they can have rainbow shit if you want.”
, pushing his arse back onto that tongue and then bucking forward so his cock slid against the wall.
in his eyes at that moment that to Draco, it feels as though they’re already kissing, as if they’re already naked against one another.
When Hermione asks, with genuine interest, “Harry, how’s Malfoy? Are you both happy?” Ron’s glare intensifies.
He was being Levitated.
“Don’t.” Harry was shocked at the bark in his own voice. “Don’t touch that gorgeous cock yet.” He could hear Malfoy’s breathing stutter again. “Do you have your wand on you?”
Has he always been so
At the first brush of the fine wings against my fingers, I feel a sense of relief so vast flood me that I nearly fall off my broom – not triumph, not that juvenile smugness – relief.
“Yeah. Scorpius’ dad said this castle belonged to a
“I am
Scorpius stood undecidedly in the middle of the clearing, looking from Harry to his father.
Malfoy gasps as Harry’s erection stabs his hip. “
“What does that have to do with anything?” Draco asks, half-bewildered, half-irritated.
, the permanent blond fixture in my life who does not know how to shut his filthy mouth and insists on keeping his inherent kindness buried under thick layers of scalding rudeness.
“Why else,” Harry repeats, nodding. And then he lunges forward.
With a smile that probably made him appear nauseated, Draco carefully placed his long, white hand in Weasley’s and shook it weakly.
And yet, when everyone begins to head home and I see Draco meandering around the room collecting empty ice cream bowls and pint bottles, casually waving the others off, my stomach clenches. He’s going to want to stay, I realise.
he’s just seen in Harry’s eyes.
“I don’t know, Jamie, but someone – something – has moved her.”
“You don’t want me to--?” he starts.
“I have literally been inside your body,” Harry reminds him, voice unintentionally husky.
“You...fought off the Imperius Curse when the

to see me before that, Potter?”
it had to be you! This is the fucking parody that my life is!”
Heart clenching, Draco grabbed his head and kissed him fervently before he realised Harry was trying (and failing) not to laugh. Then he shoved him back roughly and scowled. “That was a shit thing to say,” he informed him. “Why d’you want to meet Mother anyway?”
do something like that again.”
“Fucking hair,” I hiss, wiping my nose on the back of one hand, and he laughs harder, bending over in whatever space we have between us, drunkenly wheezing soundlessly. “Shut up,” I grumble and stagger forward, the toes of my boot landing right on his bare foot.
He supposes it would’ve been a whole other thing if he and Potter had been...together. The very thought of it makes Draco slightly dizzy – Potter and he, an actual couple; Potter finding out that Draco lived in that godawful little shithole and gently persuading Draco, his
“Mum... Mum can’t... She’s...”
“Father couldn’t have even if he’d tried,” Draco says scornfully, his mouth quivering when Narcissa chimes out a startled laugh.
“Please!” Potter groans helplessly when Draco continues to suckle at his weakly twitching cock, licking the runaway trickles of come off his balls, sucking wetly into the nook from where they hang.
! They’re doing it again! I told you not to invite them! I’m going back home, I swear I am!”
Potter’s arm shot out, sturdy fingers curling around Draco’s wrist, his grip unexpectedly strong. He sighed. “Sorry,” he said with a hint of a scowl still lingering about his face. And then, before Draco could reply, he called out to the barkeep who’d just appeared from the other side of the circular bar, “Hey, Martin? Can I have a neat whiskey, please? And another one of these?” He indicated to his empty pint.
Ron is lounging on the sofa in nothing but a pair of nauseatingly bright yellow pyjama bottoms when I step out of the Floo. He’s got a bowl of crisps balanced on his stomach and is flicking through channels on the television so quickly that the picture is just a blur.
“I did not say that,” Harry says at once, short of breath for some reason, his head filled with deafeningly jangling of warning bells. “Malfoy, I knew you were worried about them and so I asked Ron to keep an ear out for their whereabouts.”
“Draco, what are you doing?” she asks quietly and he doesn’t quite have an answer. “This might not turn out well,” she warns when he doesn’t reply.
We look at each other expressionlessly and burst out laughing at the same time.
To Draco’s smug satisfaction, Potter, despite the fact that they’d been standing pressed as close as possible with a pregnant belly between them, had not expected the kiss. He lets out a little gasp into Draco’s mouth that prompts Draco to only deepen the kiss at once, slanting his face and slotting their mouths together, lunging forward into the kiss as their teeth clack and lips smack.
show me the same courtesy, were I to go out there and find myself a juicy little pull for the night. Noble hero like you would be more than accommodative, no?”
Ron clearly had expected more tact. He looks like I’d slapped him across the face with a shoe. Hermione looks quite taken aback, leaning away in surprise.
“Do I need to carry any personal documents?”
?” Potter inhales loudly, breathing in deeply for a long moment before emitting a soft, rolling growl that sends a shudder up Draco’s spine.
“Actually, there’s a whole bunch of promises we’re going to have to make today,” Draco says dryly.
, making Harry’s chest flutter despite the way his body was still reeling.
!” Draco splutters.
Harry nearly does; he opens his mouth, on the very verge of saying something completely foolish and something he’s consciously refused to dwell on for several weeks now, but reigns it back in at the very last moment, the baby shifting vigorously under their hands.
you right now?!”
“Whatever,” he replies flatly. “Nothing you need to apologise for; that’s all I was trying to say.”
Malfoy pins him with a look, mouth turned down at the corners as he stares flatly. Suddenly, he lets out a grainy cackle, managing to look incredibly lovely even as he snorts through his laughter and slaps his knee crudely. Harry grins helplessly, watching him chortle and hoot with mirth when Malfoy’s face crumples again and he buries it into the apron with a huge sob.
“I think that’s the most idiotic question you’ve ever asked me.”
“It’s made of gold,” he said.
Potter, who shut his eyes after snarling so rudely at Draco, sighs, rubbing them before abruptly yawning widely. “There is no way to help me now, Malfoy,” he says, voice rough with fatigue. “Trust me, I’ve checked.
The deep burgundy curtains turned grainy and the wardrobe doubled as Draco’s vision shifted around in a daze, the floor tilting up to meet him, his pink bathrobe snaking along the floor and vanishing.
“Why?”
Harry’s gut tightened. Me too, he wanted to say. “I know,” he said instead.
“What—what do you think you’re doing?” Draco blurts when several seconds later, neither of them have spoken and Potter’s face, barely two inches away from Draco’s, is still flat and sour.
She draws back slightly to grin up at me but keeps her arms around my neck. “Are you asking me or congratulating me?”
“I can’t
“No, Lily bear. I’m so sorry.”
“Master Harry is sending Kreacher to fetch Master Harry’s potion for him,” it croaks, and Draco blinks, realising only after several seconds that the elf is simply answering the question Draco asked it before the potion was delivered.
“Potter, you probably did a better job at thirteen than I’m doing at
Harry, biting his lip over a smile, hurried forward and tried to stick his arm behind the fridge, making those little chirping noises he made to call the ferret.
“It just makes him an advanced model, I suppose,” Granger laughs, ignoring Potter’s irritable tongue-click. “He’s got stronger bones, richer blood, sharper senses compared to other werewolves—”
“Solar
“Ron, how can you say that?” Hermione finally spoke up, sighing wearily into her book.
“I never had much hope in the first place, all right?” Harry says impatiently, leaning his head against the back of the sofa. “Even before this fucking mess – I never actually thought there’d be this
Harry simply shakes his head slowly, more tears silently coursing their way down his face and dripping off his jaw. “I—I think don’t know how to do this anymore,” he says hoarsely, swiping his face with the heels of his trembling hands. “I don’t know how to save people anymore.”
Harry sighed. “James.”
a vanilla prude,” Harry reminds him, both hands covering his arse in a reverent squeeze, inadvertently humping into the front of his jeans. His fingers are too tight, too insistent, as he works Malfoy’s arse cheeks open, prising them wide apart and peering in the semi-darkness at the little pink bud that winks up at him. “Believe me now?” he murmurs, pulse speeding up even further just at the sight of that quivering, wrinkled little divot, pushing Malfoy’s thighs further apart and stepping between them, hunching over Malfoy.
Back to fucking reality where everything in my life is about to go pear shaped; I can fucking
I’m definitely as red as Ron now, I can feel it. But I just crack my neck and straighten up in my seat determinedly. “Not that I can think of,” I say. “My—my past partners have never...y’know...” I clear my throat and shift in my seat. “I’ve never faced any complaints in the past. But, well, I have no way of knowing if they were just being polite, of course.”
“I had no need to, your father is a very affectionate husband,” she replies and Draco clicks his tongue in disapproval, earning a casual shrug in reply. “What I’m saying is, darling, that sex is important at every stage of a marriage, not just the early years.”
“Yeah? How much do you bet?” he raises one brow in challenge before going over to yank the darts out of the board
“Don’t be mad anymore,” murmured Harry plaintively, working the knot of Draco’s pink terry bathrobe open and then turning him around in his arms. “You’re too hot right now for me to resist you.”
He smiles again with a little nod, making to turn away to fetch his cloak, when there’s a soft tinkle of glass hitting the fluffy carpet they’re standing on, and Potter grabs Draco’s hand in an unbreakable grip, his skin scorching hot against Draco’s own. Draco turns, gasping a little, and then freezing at the look on Potter’s face.
Malfoy flushes angrily. “Fuck
It hasn’t stopped drizzling all week, and has been miserable, but Truman nods eagerly anyway. “Lovely,” he croaks. “So perfectly lovely.”
Except for stiffening slightly, Harry doesn’t react. “What,” he grunts after a beat.
; how Harry thinks Draco is far truer than people give him credit for being, and how Harry considers Draco to be his first stroke of luck since the War, his centre of security and comfort.
, sweetheart, make your peace with it already.” I’m fighting a grin of my own and Christ, he’s
, ‘Mione.
I can’t bring myself to look down as I soar in a wide circle around the hill. I hear the panicked screams and the shout of someone’s spell to slow his fall. I hold the feebly fluttering Snitch in my hand and stare unseeingly ahead of me as I gradually lose height and circle lower.
“Daddy,” she said softly.
Draco hadn’t replied, exchanging a long, inscrutable look with him, something – the baby probably – doing cartwheels inside his belly, before leaving to go try on his clothes, cartwheels still in full swing.
“Not only did I catch it,” he said, “but I also won the Quidditch cup.”
“Yeah.”
“Wow,” Ron deadpans as I curse and wave my wand in the general direction of the kitchen. The mop is still whizzing across the floor in there a couple of minutes later when the Floo flares and Hermione appears in a blur of lime green.
Harry is pushing the Harpies through a third set of cross-crunches when he notices the lone figure sitting in the deserted stands on the far end of the stadium, the glint of platinum-blond hair unmistakable. Despite the tension that’s been building all day in the pit of his stomach, Harry grins broadly.
he’s late. Git.”
“No, I need to know that you’re okay,” Harry interrupts, lacing their fingers over his stomach again.
“So I just have to cry more often to get you to hold me down and ride me like you’re trying to kill me?”
Draco can feel the muscles in his lower half bunching up. His legs dangle uselessly in the air where Harry keeps him suspended, and as he fights to keep his eyes open, he sees his toes curl tightly and doesn’t remember doing that voluntarily. Harry is licking away now, firm, pressing laps against his fluttering hole, a hoarse, nearly inhuman sound escaping him with every other insistent lick.
Lucius’ nostrils flare, his jaw working frantically as he glares in open dislike at Harry. Next to him, Malfoy shifts nervously in place but doesn’t comment.
“We tried, Potter,” he says kindly. “Calling that attempt a complete fucking disaster would be doing it a kindness. Now how ‘bout another pint, eh?”
Instead they were indoors – partially.
“Turns out we both have a thing for blonds, anyway,” she sighs, hefting her broom across the shoulders and slinging her arms over it. “Not to mention the gay thing.”
,” he adds, nipping at his lip again.
“Fuck,” he muttered, quickly stumbling back. Then, after sparing a moment to look around blankly, Harry marched through the stream to the other side. The water only rose just past his ankles and Harry flicked his wand to dry his jeans after he’d crossed over. Pausing again, Harry scratched his head. Had they even crossed this thing on their way here? Well, he’d been Levitated, hadn’t he? But the kids and Malfoy all had had dry feet at the clearing.
, Draco wants to bellow into his face.
, Potter!” he laughs, and next to him, Potter is grinning too, sheepish and a bit shy. “Look at you, you fat thing!”
means that Ron as good as knows too.”
The next weekend, I cook curry for the whole gang.
“Please--” Something in Malfoy’s voice made Harry look up – Malfoy already looked a little wrecked. His hair was a mess and stuck up all over his place, his cheeks were stained deep pink and his forehead and upper lip glistened with sweat. “It—it won’t be that bad; just push in.” When Harry hesitated for a few more seconds, “
“Cunt.”
“And what the fuck is the point of that, exactly?” I snap.
Draco moans softly just from having Potter press him down on his bed, arching and rutting up against him until he finally pulls away swollen lips to sit up and drag Draco’s pyjama bottoms off, Draco hurriedly tearing the top off over his head, his hair promptly falling out of the clumsy knot it had been up in. Potter tries to kiss him again but Draco turns away, pointedly reaching down to pluck at the elastic of Potter’s joggers and biting his lip when Potter smirks but sits back up to take them off. Draco watches hungrily as Potter strips bare, gulping at the sight of his heavy, bobbing erection, sighing as Potter leans back in for a demanding kiss.
“I’ve wanted to sit beside you for years, Potter.”
Potter tosses his head back and barks out a loud, tickled laugh, twinkling at Draco. “I’m going to let you have a taste tomorrow,” he says with wicked intent.
“Thanks,” Harry mumbles sheepishly, as Malfoy holds out one mug and then nods at the armchair, inviting Harry to sit down. Harry accepts the mug and watches Draco pull out the rickety chair at the desk, steadying it before sitting down. “Sit here,” Harry says quickly, moving out of the way and pointing at the armchair.
“You were never a Death Eater, Malfoy,” Potter replies smoothly. “Sorry to break it to you, but it takes more than an ugly tattoo to be one of those.” Without even blinking, Potter lifts Draco’s left arm and pointedly kisses the shrivelled scar of his Dark Mark.
Draco instantly feels his throat close up, eyes starting to ache as he fights to keep his chin up, spending several seconds deliberating before opting to be honest. “I tried,” he says tightly. “I owled. I apologised – several times. When they didn’t respond and I was desperate enough, I went to the Manor. It—It was locked.” Draco’s voice quavers on the last word and he looks away, the room blurring before him as his eyes fill up, jaw clenched painfully tight.
,” I say immediately. “Draco.
But not even the
“She’s two, it’ll be a few years before she calms down,” Draco replies blandly, setting aside the empty bottle and picking her up to hand over. “Let’s just get her dressed. Mother can do her hair when we get there. We have just enough time to get our robes on and get going,
all day.”
He’s whimpering again now, even as he actively kisses me back, his hands buried in my hair. He’s got one leg wound around my hip and we’re grinding together. When I wrench my mouth free and push my face into his neck, he throws his head back against the wall, panting, and eagerly gives me access to lick the briny skin. His hips are moving fluidly but with no rhythm. I’m hard in my boxers as I suck bruises into his neck and I can feel how hard he is through his jeans.
Harry reached out and pulled him close again. This time James clung to him immediately.
wanted to buy it back myself. You—you shouldn’t have been the one paying for it.”
Malfoy’s slightly wry expression suddenly vanishes to be replaced by flat frustration as he lets Harry’s words sink in. “Merlin, Potter,” he says irritably.
“I’m going to kill Theo,” Draco mutters irritably.
“Thought or hoped?” Harry murmurs, now stringing kisses up Draco’s jaw, hands working his arse in a steady massage.
“Gonna,” Harry nods, pulling his fingers out and replacing it with his thumb, massaging just the inside of his rim until Draco is arching like a cat. “Turn over.”
He and Granger were the first to arrive and Draco had immediately eyed the wiggling lump under his jumper with a mixture of curiosity and tentative excitement—he’d fallen in love with Granger’s cat over the course of being with Harry and for a whole thirty seconds, Draco had been sure that Weasley had been sensitive and kind enough to gift Harry and him with a kitten.
“Potter,” Malfoy says vacantly.
“Happy birthday,” Harry whispered, grabbing Draco’s hand where it lay on his cheek and then pressing something into it. Draco’s fingers closed around the Snitch and he looked back up at Harry with a soft snort. “I keep my promises.” Harry winked.
Draco isn’t smug for too long though because in just a few seconds, Potter has both hands in Draco’s hair, clenched into tight, unforgiving fists, and is just completely
There’s a soft snigger against his throat but it’s immediately followed by a slow, hard suckle, Potter slurping his way down Draco’s neck as if determined to leave as many marks as possible. Draco can’t bring himself to complain and so tilts his head as far back as he can on Potter’s downy pillow, moaning softly with each biting lap, staying pliant and soft but for the light shivers zinging up his spine.
Draco can’t stop staring at him after a point. And when Draco’s fluffy grey cat slinks into the room, meowing loudly and sullenly in his post-nap disorientation, Potter looks outright delighted for someone who’s supposed to be...part-dog or something.
“She...could produce one.”
“Obviously.”
magical lineage,” Hermione supplies, rifling through another file. “He’s a Pureblood, which is probably how he even got pregnant in the first place. But that’s an added advantage here, meaning that he and his magic are definitely strong enough to endure a chance pregnancy.”
“James. She’s gone.”
“Are you familiar with this place or something?”
“His name is Moody,” Weasley said loudly, bouncing on the balls of his feet.
to make an effort with Tristan. He’s never been with someone for as long as he’s been with Tristan so maybe the guy really is alright?
Malfoy’s entire body is sweat slippery and trembling under him, his sharp, breathless whimpers cutting into Harry’s own rough panting. They’re entwined tightly together, all four of Malfoy’s limbs coiled tightly around Harry, his face burrowed into the crook of Harry’s neck as he hiccups softly.
thing at all? Would she even be conscious?
“What’s—I swear to fuck!” Draco shouted. “Tell me what happened to my shirt!”
I do.” Scorpius looked shocked. “James Sirius. Named after the Saviour’s father and godfather.”
The sight of that trunk, along with Malfoy’s aloofness, is enough to have Harry’s heart sinking lower than where it’s been since the previous night. He just stands there and stares longingly at Malfoy, too many thoughts buzzing around his head for him to be able to focus on one and do something to rectify this situation.
He’s soft, Draco is. I’d suspected it as a friend; now, as his boyfriend, I’ve confirmed it and it’s absolutely beautiful. As vulgar as his tongue can get, he’s endearingly old fashioned in some ways. He blushes when I kiss his forehead, his cheek. He initiates quiet nuzzling more often than he initiates proper kisses. When he wants me to hold his hand, he brushes his hand against mine until I get the hint. He likes to play with my hair, smell it, and muss it up. He’s a whole other person even while remaining entirely unchanged.
“We’ve all done shit we regret,” Harry says, slightly plaintively. When Ginny just snorts and Summons her broom, he adds, “Mine was dating you.” He laughs and dodges neatly when she hisses like a pissed off Kneazle and aims the broom handle at his crotch.
Harry hangs his head as he stands there, one hand braced against the tiles as Draco sponges down his back and heals a long, lightly oozing scratch across it. He sighs softly as Draco guides him to sit on the rim of the tub, blinking up at him, half-blind and strangely sweet, as Draco washes his face with warm, wet hands, resting his cheek on Draco’s chest as Draco gently lathers up his hair, shampooing his messy mane thrice before he’s satisfied. He stands and lifts his arms obediently so Draco can soap his armpits, swaying on the spot as Draco thoroughly works the soapy sponge over the rest of him, the hot spray a steady, soothing beat across their bodies.
“Yes, you do. You won’t talk to me anymore. You won’t spend time with me anymore. You won’t even fucking
“Because we’re going to have a baby,” Harry nods, swallowing as he steps forward a few paces. “Because we’re going to be

Granger is practically beaming at the pair of them now, hands clasped on her file, gaze flicking between them like she’s watching tennis. When they both stop and look at her, she lets out a loopy little sigh and looks back down.
obvious.”
Certain that he’s broken at least two toes, Draco turns to glare at Potter, who in turn is standing very still, hands on his hips, expression patient and calm.
It’s Potter who clears his throat pointedly and taps his knuckles against the table to regain her attention. Granger blinks, promptly goes brilliantly pink, and starts tearing feverishly through a folder in front of her.

“No.” Malfoy swallowed loudly. “I could-- I could go inside a stall...”
“Fucking tosser,” Ron mutters irritably as Malfoy saunters away, still chuckling. Harry discreetly grinds into the front of his pants, Malfoy’s pink cheeks and shiny eyes still dancing before him. “Oi, so are you meeting the cat-bloke again?”
“Of course not; I’m so sorry,” Potter steps aside at once, “Come in, come in.”
“Do unclench, Potter,” he teases, straightening up and brushing his hands down his wonderfully clingy robes. “I’ve been pulling your leg for over a decade and a half now. Don’t you think it’s about time you learn to recognise it, if not learned to come up with a halfway intelligent retort?”

like too.”
He yanks his finger free and slaps me across the face hard enough to make me stumble back. Before I can recover, he’s stepped forward and shoved me again, screaming, “
want off?” Malfoy asks, breathless and sharp. “Are you saying you’re the only one who knows how to commit?”
“I’ll take you,” Harry says at once, nodding when Malfoy looks back up at him. “I’m taking you there, but not now. You’re cold and tired and need to eat something and take a warm bath. You need rest; you need to sleep. Come home now. I’ll take you to your parents tomorrow after breakfast.”
“Seven,” Draco instantly corrects me. He lifts Tristan’s hand and continues, “Did I mention this one here was Beauxbaton’s star Seeker?” he grins. Next to him, Tristan grins and gives me a smug wink.
“Malfoy, you’re being downright absurd.”
“A werewolf,” Draco says flatly, raising his eyebrows when Potter just blinks. “A werewolf who possesses perfect control of his mental and physical faculties and who’s on possibly the best version of a Wolfsbane Potion that can even be brewed. It’s not like you’re going to suddenly transform in broad fucking daylight, you daft tit!” Draco adds exasperatedly. “It’s terrible, what happened to you, Potter, and I am so
“Skilled, am I?”
. It’s been less than twelve hours since Potter’s tongue was last buried inside Draco’s arse and
“We know you’re in there, Harry, we can feel it in your wards!” Hermione calls out.
“NO! Not my bathrobe!” Draco shouted, springing off the bed and nearly crumpling to the floor because his legs were like jelly from being relentlessly stimulated to the point of intense orgasm. “You filthy little beast!”
It’s unnerving.
He also realised that he had never actually seen Malfoy eat anything either – unless he had eaten something in the time it had taken for him to follow Harry to Godric’s Hollow; but somehow Harry doubted that.
, fuck, literally risking his life. He—I owe him so much, I owe him everything he can ask of me.”
It’s a single, seemingly unending slide into Draco that has him lifting off the sheets until he’s quivering under Potter with just his shoulders pressed to the bed, gasping shrilly against Potter’s shoulder as he curses through grit teeth into Draco’s hair. He’s pressed so deeply into Draco that Draco can feel the edge of Potter’s hip bones pressed up against his arse cheeks, can feel every twitch of his cock inside him.
“It doesn’t mean I don’t still want to stomp on your face.”
“I’ll...help you to the hospital wing, c’mon,” Harry murmured softly.
“This can’t be comfortable for you,” Hermione acknowledges, waving a hand at his crotch. “You look awful,” she adds, gaze roving over the dark half-moons under his eyes that plunge halfway down to his cheeks, the way he’d paled, his skin tinged with grey, the way his hair is almost frighteningly out of control.
Malfoy, who was still writhing, his knees bending and straightening where they lay on the bed, his breathing rough and loud in the stillness of the room. Harry didn’t have to look up to know that his eyes were closed. He’d have closed his eyes too, just to hide from the sheer absurdity of the situation, the magnitude of it; except that Malfoy was rather fucking stunning.
Malfoy gasped throatily as he was breached, jerking so violently that Harry nearly fell right off him. His hands pressed into Harry’s back as he rasped out a garbled bunch of words that Harry literally could not hear through the rushing in his own ears.
Draco thinks he can still feel the coarse, black fur beneath his fingers; they’d lain on this bed, the wolf’s hot breath washing across Draco’s face as it panted quietly, it’s eyes a strange mix of black and familiar, vibrant green, fixed on Draco. The wolf made small, yapping sounds as Draco ran his hands through its fur, unknotting it much like he did Harry’s hair. From time to time, it emitted the same pained groans that Draco had heard earlier – Draco suspected, upon light inspection, he had a cracked bone in his left hind leg. He’d used a basic Numbing Charm to alleviate the pain but mostly, the wolf had just whimpered quietly until they both fell asleep, sometime well after three AM.
Harry breaks away with an impatient smack, pushing himself back into a sit as Draco slides off his lap with a very pleased smirk. “Why are you such an old ballsack, you little shit?” He digs around in the enormous, magically Extended picnic basket and pulls out two bottles of chilled cider. “As if you and Hermione don’t regularly snog in front of people.”
He pulled off for a second to look up once again; Malfoy’s hands, heavily bound as they were, were clenched beside his head on his pillow and his eyes were open – they were

Malfoy’s mouth twisted. “An ocelot.”

Potter laughs, and it’s a rich, warm sound that makes Draco want to say more things to make him laugh. “You’re not really a one-night-stand, though,” he tells Draco, raising an eyebrow, lips curved up in a wry smile. “Not after last night.”
Exhilaration.
He just stares at me with that look of wonder for a long time, reaching up once to pull off my smudged glasses and put them aside and then another time to brush my hair off my forehead and stroke my scar.
want?” Draco has snapped before he can stop himself – it wouldn’t do to push Potter too far past the point where his innate chivalry ran out though. Potter has stayed unnervingly silent about the whole thing and the last thing Draco wants is for people to know he’d gotten hard with Potter attempting to give him multiple fractures in combat training.
“Oh my god! I don’t
“Sorry,” mumbled Weasley. “I meant to say that—I only meant—
Potter’s lip curls and he roughly knocks Draco’s hands aside, pushing down his grey and black boxers so that Draco is suddenly staring at Harry Potter’s erection.
Draco sighs. “I owe him, Granger,” he says shortly, and then relapses into stubborn silence.
“So what’d you decide to bring for dessert?” I ask, lowering the spoon to admire him. He’s wearing a snow white turtleneck with perfectly tailored khaki trousers and he quite literally takes my fucking breath away. So I just stand there, not breathing, as he marches up to the fridge; the trousers hug his arse so perfectly that I want to stab myself.
Potter sits on the steel stool, spinning himself round and round, and making Draco dizzy, eventually getting up and poking around Draco’s lab, knocking things over and apologising profusely as he straightens them back up, flipping in curious bewilderment through some of the countless volumes Draco has got stacked along his bookshelf in the corner, and generally being a lot less intimidating and intense than Draco usually found him to be.

With a loud gasp that made Harry shush him in panic, Malfoy sat up, eyes wild as he looked around in a daze, shivering as the water soaked him right through his thin hospital issued pyjama shirt.
a Veela,” Potter murmurs, and when Draco glances at him he sees that Potter is blushing bright, beet red and looks completely mortified; he’s clean shaven today, the coarse beard from last time missing, and he looks oddly young and guileless as he sits there, blushing. “Would you shut your stupid face?” Potter adds in a hiss, and Weasley blinks, turning away with his mouth slightly open.
Potter licks his lips, holding back a smile. “Our appointment’s at six-thirty today, okay?”
Damn that fucking werewolf to canine hell.
With a growled groan, Malfoy sat up.
wanking, aren’t you?!”
“How long is this likely to last?” Malfoy asks, his voice rather thin, his arse going vice-tight around Harry.
“Harry,” Potter reminds him.
“Oh, I totally plan to!” Draco snapped, pointing his wand at the levitated fridge with his left hand and bending down to rifle through the contents of the nest with his right, grabbing his clothes and throwing them over his shoulder while the ferret hopped on the spot and screeched, swiping at Draco’s hand with a tiny paw. “Get off!” barked Draco, batting the little creature away and dragging the old T-shirt out from under a carefully collected pile of (
He yelps, spinning around in alarm as his left hand is abruptly grabbed in a vice like grip, and a very wet, rather whiskery kiss, slopped onto his inner wrist.
Harry follows his calm statement up with a leisurely sip of beer while Malfoy slowly turns to regard him heatedly in shocked silence.

Harry isn’t listening to Draco’s gloating; he sulks near the entrance, arms crossed as he scowls around the dim, eerily lit room. The stone pillars are hung with tapestries in rich, emerald green, the glass windows looking into the Lake ominously thin.
