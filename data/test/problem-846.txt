A smile spread across Harry’s face as he saw the slight blush creeping across his lover’s cheeks. “We wouldn’t love her if she wasn’t the kind of woman to fight for what she believes in. To face the dangers of the world head on and make them bend to her will.” His thumb stilled and Draco glanced up at him through his impossibly blonde lashes in confusion. “We will protect her, make no mistake about that. But Hermione will not sit back and let us treat her like a princess in need of rescue. She will be right there, by our sides, as the three of us vanquish the evils of the world.” Harry reached up and caressed Draco’s cheek, the memory of the slap Hermione had given his lover in their third year brought a smile to his face. “She has never let someone push her around, not even us. Whoever did this to her apartment will pay dearly and he should pray to Merlin that we manage to find him before she does.” Harry smirked, releasing Draco’s face and leaning back in his chair. The twilight spilled through the kitchen windows as they were lost in thought.
“Someone get that fucking cake to the lab. I want to know exactly what poison was used. I will send him to Azkaban personally once we have the proof.” When no one moved an inch Harry barked, “Now!” and it was like a shot had gone off. Everyone was in motion, the cake was taken to the lab, Saint Mungo’s was called for a team to move the downed auror for further treatment, paperwork was suddenly intensely interesting.
“Now, now, that’s not true. We were great together. We were going to settle down and start a family before you got all this nonsense put in your head.” Ron finally shook Malfoy off him and walked toward Hermione, reaching for her until yet another hand pulled him back. It was Bill this time. Ron glared up at his brother.
Draco strode with purpose into a garish red and orange building on Diagon Alley only to be greeted with an eerie silence. It was just closing time but there were no customers milling around the bombastic displays of pranks. No children screaming in delight as they discovered tiny balls of fur that looked suspiciously like those Tribbles from that cheesy space show Harry had shown him.
“Oh and I heard about that time that you and Malfoy raided an entire secret lair full of Death Eaters that were trying to rebuild their following. You both walked out of that warehouse without even a scratch!” Alice nearly knocked over a vase of flowers as they passed by a desk too closely. A quick flick from Hermione’s wand stopped the teetering and rooted it firmly to the desk.
Harry opened his eyes and saw in his left palm lay the bright red flame of his own magic, and in his right lay a blue and white flame, the magic of Death. He pulled back from the magic and they slowly faded from his sight. He could do this. He would save George from the madness the Resurrection Stone would bring. Even though it would mean embracing this unwanted power over Death himself. If it would save George, he would do it a thousand times.
“You should have seen their faces, Draco.” She passed the plastic bag of takeaway to Harry and spread her arms, turning on the spot, her crimson dress clinging to her in all the right places, its short skirt stretched tight across her thighs, black accents matching her black stockings. His heart was pounding in his ears and his vision narrowed to the beautiful woman in front of him. He reached out and pulled her into an impromptu waltz around the dining table.
“Hermione!” Harry’s voice carried over the din of the regular patrons and the two of them spotted his tan arms waving wildly from a booth in the far corner. Harry had managed to secure a table with the best view of all of the entrances and exits to the pub. Draco smiled and guided Hermione through the web of tables and patrons without a second thought for her independent nature.
Harry received the inter-departmental memo as he pulled his office door shut. The neon pink paper crane pecked at his glasses until he stopped next to Hermione and Draco’s office door and snatched the enchanted memo from the air. He smoothed out the crumpled paper and skimmed the contents. Great. It was going to be a long night after all.
Hermione laughed in surprise at his earnest declaration. “Oh Perce, I have no intention of ever going back there. You know you all are family to me, but he will never be anything more than a stranger. Not after everything he took from me. I have my accommodations well in hand, the people I am staying with would probably tear his head off if he tried anything again, provided I didn’t get to him first.” She smiled up at him as the lift settled and the gates opened. “Thanks again for the escape route. Have a good day and give the Minister my greetings.” She patted him on the cheek and made her way past the secretaries on the Minister’s floor to the public lifts, pointedly ignoring the whispers that followed.
Draco slowly meandered toward the office, Hermione’s shouting was abruptly cut off with what he assumed was a ‘Silencio’. The nearer Draco drew to the door of Potter’s office the more the offices around him buzzed in conversation. His eyes rolled as he scoffed at how little discipline his fellow trainees had. Gossiping the first morning of the first day. Draco tried the door on Potter’s office but predictably they had locked it, so he crossed his arms and waited. It wasn’t long before the door swung wide and a soft body was crashing into his and shoving him aside. Hermione squeezed past him and huffed off toward their office. Draco’s attention was drawn by a throaty chuckle to the amused green eyes of one Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, the savior of wizarding kind, and fellow trainee auror. “You are going to have your hands full with her, Malfoy. Though, we’ll have to see if you make it through this training program. You’re not very popular around here.” Potter stood and crossed to the door and into Draco’s personal space while he was talking. Draco was thrown by this and threw a self satisfied smirk at Potter. “Anything you can do, Potter, I can do better.” His line, while a bit of bravado, shouldn’t have made Potter burst into such raucous laughter.
Harry deepened their kiss, his tongue exploring the contours of her mouth and groaned against her lips. “We love you, so much Hermione. Let us love you, let us protect you, and let us care for you, the way you have always deserved.” He knelt between their thighs and ran his hands over her throat and chest, fingers ghosting just past the edge of her nipples, teasing.
“That is odd, not that George doesn’t usually talk to himself, but he usually is just muttering his thoughts while he works.” Hermione smiled down at Draco and carded her fingers through his hair.
“Well, I haven’t really had the time to come by for brunches. Being one of the top aurors in Harry’s department keeps one busy.” Hermione took another bite of her eggs and smiled demurely at Molly.
“Keep your knickers on, Potter, can’t you see she’s doting on the magnificent me?” Draco teased as he pulled out of Hermione’s grasp and walked over to his lover and planted a firm kiss on him. “Alright, we’re ready. Off to see the wizard.” Draco chuckled at his own terrible pun.
Draco pulled her tight against him, settling her bum tight against his crotch, spreading their legs enough for Harry to kneel between both of their thighs. As his lover and his partner kissed he swept her hair aside and laid kisses along the length of the back of her neck.
“My Lady, Miss Granger has arrived.” The elf pulled Hermione forward by the hand and presented her to Narcissa with a curtsey.
Harry couldn’t help the smile that tugged at his lips. “Oh, Draco, don’t get jealous. I’m sure you two aren’t far behind me. You’re always right there, aren’t you?” Harry leaned in close to whisper in Draco’s ear as he took the papers back. For some reason proximity to Harry always threw the blonde man off balance and since Harry had discovered this fact he tended to invade Draco’s personal space on principle.
“Thank you, Severus. This is thorough as always. I will get you the records you need, including his last complete physical so you can compare.” Harry waved his wand and bundled the reports pages together, shrinking them to fit safely in his breast pocket, and stood. He reached his hand out and waited for Severus to shake it. “Narcissa missed you sorely at this last brunch. Draco as well.”
“You will get up and leave. Right now.” Harry’s words came out quietly but with more force than Draco had expected. The Weasel stood jerkily and beat a hasty retreat. Draco smirked at the mild panic on the Weasel’s face at Harry’s command. Draco’s body was reacting to that commanding tone in his lover’s voice. He would have to make it known later how much he enjoyed that commanding presence.
“Get! Out!” Hermione screamed and slashed her wand through the air, a jet of shining light barely missed Bill who was quick to dodge and slammed into Ron’s back, propelling him forcefully through the open door and slamming it behind him.
The silence stretched comfortably between them until Draco raised his wand to levitate the pot of tea over to the table and poured himself another cup. “What use is it if we can’t keep her safe? We have to convince her to stay with us until it all blows over. She won’t accept it easily, she’s a headstrong Gryffindor after all, but you eventually saw sense and cohabitated with me.”
“Does the name Gred mean anything to you?”  Draco’s eyes drifted closed and he missed her stricken look at his casual mention of the lost Weasley twin.
Harry flexed his fingers and reached inside himself for his magic, bright and full of life, it leapt into his hand ready to be used, eager, and beside it was a stillness, a calm that was anticipatory, like a predator lying in wait to strike. If his magic was like gazing into a hearth, warm and bright and full of energy ready to leap past its confines at the right moment, the power of death was seemingly the opposite. It was calm, almost still, but it was like nothing Harry had ever felt. He reached out and pulled the tendril of magic toward him, it uncoiled from his magic and came to him eagerly, it reminded him of a serpent the way it coiled around his magic and around his metaphorical arm that reached into himself. It burned hotter than his own magic, like holding a captive star. But it felt welcoming, like he had arrived home.
Draco maneuvered behind her, placing her between the two men again, his thighs cupping hers, he wrapped his arms tightly around her waist. “You are so much more to me than just my partner, or my lover’s best friend. Hermione, I love you so much more than I could have ever expected. Every time we rush into battle you are the center of my focus. I can’t lose you. I fight so hard to keep us both alive, both coming home to Potter at the end of the day.” He buried his face into her curls as he fought the tears springing up in his eyes. His voice cracked, betraying his pain, “I know that you are more than capable of taking care of yourself, and you’ve saved my arse more than a dozen times in our years together. But love, please, let us do our best to protect you as you do to protect us.”
“Longbottom, Bones, a pleasure as always.” Draco smiled at the pair and turned to Weasley, his lips curling into a self-satisfied smirk. “Weasel.” He ushered Hermione into the seat next to Harry and followed her into the booth, effectively sandwiching her between the two of them. A public, if less than subtle, signal that she was being protected by the two of them while Weasley sat across from Draco on the outside of the booth. His disheveled appearance and general lack of calm did nothing to dispel Draco’s smirk. The Weasel was off kilter, good, that meant that Hermione would have the upper hand in their little party of Hogwarts alumnus.
“I had suspected, you know. But we lived in a time where there was no such thing as an unwilling man. If he could rise to the occasion then that was a sign he was willing.” Narcissa clutched her skirt hard. “Arthur was in the same year as Lucius, I was a few years behind them in school. It was a shock that Arthur and Molly’s wedding happened so soon after they graduated and then shortly after William was here and everyone had moved on. It seemed so foreign to me, wanting to have a child so quickly out of school and when I counted backward I knew why they had moved their courtship up.” Her gaze fell on the three of them and she gave them a weak smile.
Harry took the steps two at a time until he reached the second floor and nearly ran to his bedroom. His heart was pounding and he was fully hard, painfully hard. The next few months might turn out to be torture after all.
“Alice.” Hermione turned in Draco’s grip and smiled at the trainee. “Sorry you had to see that.” She nodded to the girl and turned back to Draco. “We were going to see Kensington. He wanted you and I to teach a class or two. Dean has been telling tall tales of our might.” Draco pulled her toward the ministry’s exit. The stares of the gawkers following them.
“Oh, my love, you have no idea yet how skilled I can be. We would need at least one other person involved for that.” He smirked as he slowly ate the first course. He let Harry stew while they progressed into the main.
“Sorry, was in with Kingsley when your note arrived.” Harry hung his cloak on the hook by the door and began rolling his sleeves up and cuffed them at his elbows. “Anything I can help with?”
Draco nodded, “Mrs. Weasley, how skilled are your children in baking?” His lips thinned in distaste at having to ask the question.
“Do you really think she did?” Draco grinned and took another sip of his wine. “That would make two of you.” Draco’s smile took on an edge that lit a fire in Harry’s libido.
“In your experience, how skilled would one need to be to make a shaped cake with a longer message?” Draco finished his biscuit and took another lazy sip of tea.
“What she has been through. What is still being done to her, if this poison was meant for her. These are things to be handled delicately, and I am not a delicate man, Mr. Potter.” A wisp of regret passed over his face before he stiffened. “I will remain in my position in the background until she has had time to grieve for the life stolen from her. Though a different set of circumstances stole my free will, I am empathetic to her plight. Give her a place to come to life again, Potter. Do things in her time, not yours.” A slender hand gestured to the office door and it swung open. “Good day, Potter. Good luck.”
“I’m not sure if it’s still binding, so I won’t give you any details, but suffice to say that Hermione can be very, very, scary. You may have noticed her handiwork on Marietta’s brow. Should have happened about the time she opened her fat mouth to Umbridge.” George gave an involuntary shudder and took another drink. “But that’s really the only ones, aside from the rabble you two lock away, that might hold a personal grudge. Haven’t seen either of them in years though so it might just be nothing.”
“Harry! You ordered him to keep me prisoner here?” Hermione gazed up at her best friend, tears beginning to streak their way down her cheeks.
“Mistress called Kreacher. Kreacher is happy to serve.” His voice cracked with age and he swept into a deep bow. Hermione knelt and pulled him into a tight embrace.
Harry laughed and kissed his boyfriend’s cheek. “Sorry Hermes, I kept your secret too well it seems.” He pulled the container out of a stunned Draco’s hand and distributed the contents onto their plates as his boyfriend did his best imitation of a fish. They were just sitting down to eat when the floo chimed and a voice called “Head Auror Potter, are you in, sir?” Harry groaned, cast a stasis charm over his plate, and went to answer the call. Everyone in the office knew not to bother him on Date Night.
“Oh Crooks, I was so worried about you darling.” She cooed at the fat half-kneasel, resuming her seat and leaning back to let him lounge upon her chest and purr contentedly. She petted him mindlessly as she drew her anger back into herself and settled in.
“You mentioned the boys, but what of Ginevra?” Draco took a slow drink of his tea, noting that it tasted like the normal tea used daily in the Weasley household. She seemed to still see him as family, then.
“Hullo Molly.” He gasped out as he tried to disengage from her ample bosom. She always seemed to pull his face down into her cleavage whenever she hugged him. It might have been a subtle plot to assassinate him, except she also did the same to Draco once he had been accepted into the family.
“Oh, well it’s not nearly as glorious and action packed as the papers make it out to be. Honestly. If you believed The Daily Prophet we would be out in squads rounding up every dark wizard that dared poke their head out of the shadows.” Hermione huffed and picked up the prepared cuppa in front of her. “Honestly, it’s mostly things like missing persons cases and the occasional attack.”
Susan’s smile came easily, “Of course she does. She always has, you know. What’s surprising is just how well your personalities complement each other. It’s amazing, really, with how explosive all your interactions had been in school that you are able to get along so well.” She reached out and grabbed Hermione’s hand to encourage her.
Severus stood and scoffed as he shook his hand, “She sees me nearly every day, she will not be put out that I declined her gathering of Weasleys. It was for Miss Granger’s sake either way. She does not need my big nose poking into her private life.”
They sat together in silence pondering the possibilities of why George, who had taken his twin’s passing harder than any one of them, was having imagined conversations with Fred in his workshop and it was implied this was a regular occurrence.
Hermione’s brain just would not stop. She had gone into the office in the hopes that working through the paperwork of their recent case files would be a productive way to distract her from what had happened that morning. After they had taken her to bed and demonstrated just how intensely they felt about her, several times in fact, they had had a serious conversation about their relationships with each other. It had been weighing on her well into the afternoon and even the thought of George in thrall to the resurrection stone didn’t chase the thoughts away long.
“Harry, Neville, I’m so sorry. I told him you would be busy.” Hermione hugged Neville in greeting. “Nev, how have you been getting on with the students? Is it everything you wanted?”
“I’m not leaving. This is my house. That’s my fiance. We’re having a nice lovely family brunch. You’re being silly.” Ron’s tone turned cajoling, the same type he had used on Hermione whenever she brought up concerns or doubts about their relationship. It struck her, hard.
“Alright, alright, let them breathe. We have food waiting.” Arthur commanded the room with his gentle authority. He led them to the kitchen and had everyone seated. Hermione was buffeted on either side by her boys. They ate in friendly company, the only Weasleys missing were Ron and Charlie, and the latter was mostly because he had a dragon clutching that weekend and couldn’t get the time off.
“Hello Molly. I’m actually here to see you, as it were.” Draco settled into the bench like seating along the overly large table situated in the middle of the kitchen.
“We wouldn’t offer if we thought you would be a bother.” Harry reassured her and ruffled her hair, drawing a laugh from her. “I am going to nip to the loo. You two figure out what we should have for supper.” He made a hasty retreat to deal with the growing problem in his trousers. It had been too long since he last touched her, especially in their emotionally charged states.
Time slipped past them, flowing ever onward, as they kissed and undressed each other. Harry pushed Draco back onto the bed and wrapped Draco’s legs around his waist, pressing their cocks together and taking them both in hand.
Hermione chuckled at Draco’s feigned arrogance. The three of them made their way to the sitting room and flooed to the Ministry of Magic’s atrium and began the walk to their department. As they went to step into the lifts a hand closed around Hermione’s wrist and pulled her back into the crowd. The doors of the lift closed on Harry and Draco as they turned around at her yelp of surprise.
“Oh, Holly, come sit down, please?” Hermione gestured toward a chair in front of her desk. “I must ask you some questions, so we can clear this all up, yeah?” She smiled at the shaking elf and turned her attention to the stern gaze of Mr. Patil. “Mister Patil, please, have a seat at my partner’s desk, this may take some time to finalize the details of Holly’s return.” She sat and began taking notes as she interviewed Holly about her unexpected disappearance from the Patil household. Through her questioning Hermione noted how nervous and mobile Holly tended to be, the stuttering when she answered a question about her elf family, the general nervous energy that almost came across as a lie to her auror senses. But why would Holly lie about an ailing relative, no, that didn’t make sense at all.
Draco Malfoy was having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. He had been chasing down leads from bakeries all day and none that he had come across in wizarding London had made a cake in the shape of a feather. He had exhausted all magical leads and would have to turn his search to muggle bakeries, but that would have to wait until morning. With luck he would find muggle bakeries to be more accommodating without his reputation to precede him.
“No offense taken Percival. It is the correct way to use love potions, after all.” Narcissa watched Hermione as she spoke. “Love potions were meant to be more of an aphrodisiac that repaired marital rifts and soothed sore feelings so that one could beget an heir. Like your idea earlier, the intention was benevolent but left room for much abuse.”
“I’ve trusted and supported the both of you, can’t you even trust me to stay at my own apartment?” Hermione was vibrating with anger, her hair had begun to grow in volume from the building magical tension in the room.
“You said that I could call to them. Pull them to me.” Harry stopped and turned to the impossibly tall being beside him.
“Good morning sleepy head.” Harry responded cheerfully, breaking away from Draco’s hold to prepare a cup of tea for her. Draco leaned back against the window sill and watched the scene unfold. Harry placed a mug of tea and a small plate of biscuits in front of his best friend.
Hermione huffed as she followed him into Harry’s office. “I really don’t see why we should bother Harry with this, Malfoy. He is probably too busy to see us anyway. We can just tell him at home.”
“We are trying to protect her from whatever sociopath made it past her wards. She will understand that this is the safest place for her and Crookshanks to be.” Draco insisted, “She isn’t stupid.”
They made their way toward the stairs and Harry cleared his throat. “Sev. Your elastic.” The potions master stilled and his cheeks tinted pink. He pulled the elastic from his hair, letting the straight strands obscure his face and turn his features more severe. Their walk to his office was casual, though the tension in them was anything but. They used the floo in Severus’s office to access the hospital and hopefully save a man’s life.
Hermione stepped out of the floo, into a beautifully decorated sitting room overlooking the sea. Light spilled in through the open windows, a gentle breeze swirling through the room carrying the smell of a delicious dinner mingling with the scent of the sea.
“Harry James, you are the head auror, you can grant me clearance to go back home if you choose.” Hermione set her shoulders and pushed out her chin. “There is no reason I have to impose upon your kindness. I have a perfectly serviceable apartment.” Hermione pulled her hand from Draco’s grasp and stared down her best friend.
“Enough.” Arthur’s command stilled them, and even the pounding on the back door silenced. He must have called up wards in the chaos. “Hermione, darling, it was lovely to see you. Though I rather think that we ought to call it a day.” He smiled gently at her.
Hermione turned and beamed at Percy, “Sorry Perce, Ron had something he wanted to say. Thanks for taking the trouble to come fetch me for our meeting this morning.” Her eyes screamed ‘please play along’ at him and he nodded to her and tapped his date book with his fingertip. “It’s no trouble at all Auror Granger, you know how Kingsley feels about punctuality. We’ll take his personal lift, of course, to offset the delay my brother has caused to our schedule. This way please.” He led her to a small gilded lift off the side of the atrium and once they were on their way to the minister’s office, he turned to her and asked, “Are you alright?”
“Mother, please never say ‘rise to the occasion’ again.” Draco groaned which dragged a laugh from Hermione and a snort from Harry.
“Green isn’t a good shade on you, Harry.” Draco rubbed his foot against Harry’s leg gently. “Hermione decided to sass me, so I threatened to turn her over my knee. It was nothing terribly intimate, love.”
After a quick shower and brushing of her teeth she emerged to find her boys tangled tightly together in their sleep and a smile crept over her face. Harry had come home late to find her and Draco curled tightly into each other’s embrace, sleeping on the sofa. Harry had woken them in his excitement to announce to them that Severus had done it. He had saved Dean’s life with his talents. They had saved his life. A life that had only been in danger because he had the misfortune of being her coworker. She knew Draco felt responsible, as he had put the cake out for everyone, but she had done her best to reassure him that the only one at fault was the one who had sent her the confection. Hermione moved closer to the bed and rested a hand on the footboard, watching their peaceful sleeping faces as her thoughts slipped to a darker place. Because she was here, they were in danger. Because she was a part of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement every one of her coworkers was in danger. The person who had sent her that cake wanted her life. She couldn’t let the people she loved get hurt by protecting her. She would have to leave so her boys wouldn’t be targeted.
Hermione made her way down the stairs to her room and began packing her things, careful not to disturb Crookshanks who was napping on her pillow. His yellow eye cracked open in reproach as she dropped something and disturbed his nap. Hermione muttered an apology to Crookshanks and smiled at her familiar sadly. She would leave him here with Draco. They had grown so close in the short time that they had all been together. It was for the best that she find a place to stay alone. She could move from hotel to hotel, throwing the perpetrator off her scent. Hermione glanced around the room a final time and slung her beaded bag over her shoulder. She would leave most of her things here, only taking what she needed for evading whoever was out to kill her. Somehow, even though everything, she had a hard time believing that Ronald would have resorted to murder.
“He seems to love you almost as much as he loves her, you know.” Harry leaned in and kissed Draco soundly. “I’m glad you two can get along. His opinion is very important.”
“Well, Most of the boys showed no interest in baking, or cooking in general, with the exception of Charlie when he decided to join the Dragon reserve and would have to cook for himself most days, of course.” She gazed down into her tea, “Ronald wouldn’t lift a spoon unless it was to eat something, he needs a woman in his life to do those sorts of things for him. It’s why I thought he and Hermione were such a good match, you know. She’s practical and efficient and of course she would be able to run a tight household and keep him in line.”
“I will be fine. We should go. I miss the Weasleys.” Hermione smiled at Harry in what she hoped was a reassuring manner. “Besides, Molly does make very good brunch.” The matter was decided and they resumed their preparation for what would be an exciting Friday at work.
“Master. You’ve decided to listen.” A tall robed figure materialized beside him, hood drawn up to obscure his features.
“Now where would you even hear a story like that one? Honestly. That’s pure exaggeration. We were half dead after that fight.” Hermione shook her head as they stepped into the lift.
“You know I haven’t seen him since the incident. I don’t see why I have to start now.” Hermione ground out before she willed her jaw to relax. It wouldn’t do for a dentist’s daughter to grind her teeth after all. She took another large slow breath to reign in her emotions. “Aside from the fact that he lied to all of us for years on end, he had me heavily drugged into believing that I was in love with him.” She could feel the rage swelling beneath the surface of her now calm exterior.
“You’re both doing it now. The scowling. Something must have gone completely tits up.” Harry groaned and reached for the case file. “Well let’s get into it then, so we can get it over with.” He flipped the folder open to the report and scanned it. “Her mother.” He deadpanned.
“You wanted to see me, Minister Shacklebolt?” Harry held up the remnants of the memo before dropping it in the bin next to the desk.
“You two will take good care of my daughter. Let me deal with the three wayward Weasleys. We will be in touch, son.” With those parting words Draco was pushed into the hearth and sent on his way to comfort the witch he considered his.
“It is true that we have an expert patissier, she is young by most standards to be called an expert. But she can work magic in the kitchen. She has won many accolades but I do not believe Mary would have the disposition to hold a grudge of any kind, let alone make an attempt on someone’s life.” The manager, whose name plate read Kristoffer, shook his head. “Mary is not in today, she teaches two days a week at a children’s shelter nearby. She volunteers her time to those less fortunate and on the outskirts of society. She suffered an accident when she was in secondary school that left her maimed. She pours all her effort into carving a place for herself in this world, and making a name for herself.” Kristoffer leaned forward, steepling his fingers, “She was turned away from many bakeries, because of this. She is our treasure. She would not hurt another living being.”
“Oh Harry. I’ve been so careful. I’ve tried for so long to keep my feelings to myself. I didn’t want to come between you.” Hermione moaned as Draco’s teeth grazed her shoulder and his hands stroked over her denim-clad thighs. “I’m afraid I’ve been desperately in love with you, both of you, for so long now.”
At that moment a sweet meow that almost resembled the word ‘mum’ sounded from the doorway to the kitchen. Crookshanks sauntered into the room as if he owned it and jumped up on Draco’s lap, drawing an ‘oof’ of pain from the man in the process. He pulled at Hermione’s sleeve with his claw and purred loudly. The tension in the room dissipated as she reached down and picked up her beloved familiar.
Hermione bolted out of her chair and around the table, scooping Arthur into a tight embrace. “Oh Arthur.” She buried her face in his shoulder and they both shook silently as they wept. The pair was wrapped in many pairs of arms and the dinner party as a whole grieved for the two. For they had both been harmed by someone they trusted and loved.
“Mistress is safe here. Mistress will stay.” He tightened his grip on her wrist and snapped his free hand. The feeling of being squeezed through too small of a space overcame them and she found them transported to the master bedroom. With another snap of his fingers the doors slammed shut and sealed with elf magic. The sound startled the boys out of their sleep.
Thank you everyone for the kudos and the comments on the first two chapters. I have been working a lot of overtime during the holiday season, so this update is a bit later going out than I wanted it to be. I appreciate your patience and support. Please enjoy chapter three. I’m going to try and update at least monthly, but my job seems to not know how to schedule people without running everyone on the team ragged. Thank you all for your continued support.
“Shall we, Granger?” He held out a hand to her, casually flicking his wand to turn on the music, a lilting waltz. She placed a hand in his and stood to join him, her heart hammering in her chest. He pulled her tight against him and adjusted her hold to a more traditional wizarding style before sweeping her into the dance, skillfully leading her through the dining room and into the adjacent sitting room. Time slipped away from them as the heat from Draco’s hand on her hip spread through her body and into her core.
Hermione frowned and mentally reviewed their multiple conversations through the day as the clock on the far side of the department rang out seven chimes in a pleasant tune, the seventh chime seeming to echo into the silence. She groaned loudly and slouched bonelessly in her chair, “Merlin, it’s that stupid party isn’t it? I thought you and Harry said I didn’t have to go if I didn’t want to. I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. Not like this.” She gestured at her plain ministry work robes. The Magical Law Enforcement uniform was more or less progressive depending on who you asked. Hermione’s trousers were looking a bit worse for wear and her button down Oxford shirt could definitely use a quick ironing spell. But the worst crime of all was probably that her hair had come loose, as it always did, from her attempts at taming it into a tight bun.
George heaved a sigh and slumped in his chair. “Honestly. Ron’s at the top of my list, but something like poison just seems so out of character for him. Believe me, Malfoy, I honestly think that he would never do anything to hurt her.”
“Sorry, Longbottom.” Draco gestured for him to step closer and look. “This is the worst yet she’s gotten from Weasley trying to win her back. You have to see it.”
“Draco, darling, what brings you by? Arthur hasn’t made it home from work yet. Come in, come in.” Molly pulled him into a hug and pulled him through the sitting room and into the kitchen before he could get a response out of his mouth.
“Right, sorry. So, Kingsley, your note mentioned that there has been a development with Auror Thomas’s condition?” Harry shifted his weight in anticipation for the imminent bad news.
Harry nodded and kept his attention on Draco even as his mind replayed what he had seen. “She was most definitely masturbating to you, love. It was so beautiful.”
They exchanged their goodbyes and Draco walked from the bake shop toward the nearest apparition point. He turned on his heel and apparated away to a lopsided house in Ottery St Catchpole.  Draco knocked on the door of the burrow and released the transfiguration on his auror robes, the investigator’s suit melting away to reveal the vibrant green of his auror robes.
It would be almost the last time she would be allowed out with ‘other men’ without Ron present to stake his claim.
“As well as can be expected, Longbottom. With the exception of Harry and Hermione I am still mostly persona non grata in the department, though the frost is finally thawing the more impossible cases they shove at us.” Draco smirked at the minor boast about his and Hermione’s abilities at solving nearly every case thrown their way. “The department has been giving us their worst, and we continue to come out on top.” He wrapped his arm around Hermione’s shoulders and threw a smile at her. “Hermione has incredible insights and drive. Looks like they knew what they were doing when they put us together.”
“Granger! I think I’ve got a lead on...Holly?” The door swung open as Draco strode confidently into the room only to stop in his tracks at the sight of their missing elf. “Well, hello there darling Holly. You have come home, then?” He sent a dazzling smile at the elf and took her hand, bowing low over it as if to kiss her knuckles. Her trembling increased at the polite greeting. His glance caught Granger’s and he noticed her suspicion in them.
Harry laughed and shoved Draco’s hand away, turning Hermione to look up into his eyes. “I asked Kreacher to try and keep you here at home if you tried to do something noble and foolish like leaving to spare us. It seems like you couldn’t resist saying goodbye to him.” He leaned forward and rested his forehead on hers, their eyes closing at the proximity. “I know you, love, I knew at some point you would try and run to spare us.” He stroked his thumb against her cheek as he spoke, “I can’t lose you too, Hermione. I’ve lost so very much. I need you to trust us to protect you.” His voice was small and vulnerable at his declaration.
Harry took in the scene silently, categorizing every movement and touch. Did she know that she was being flirtatious? No. Her movements lacked the sensual intent behind them. Draco, however, was clearly affected by her proximity between his legs. Harry stood and walked up behind her, rubbing her shoulders and neck gently. “Hermes, would it really be so bad living here with us until this is all sorted?” He spoke softly as he trailed his fingers up her neck to massage her scalp. Something he hadn’t done with her since before she and Ron had begun their relationship.
Alice’s hands stopped trembling and she stood stiffly, “I understand that you think that, Auror Granger. However, you and your partner demonstrate a level of understanding and connection that others only dream to replicate. If the entire department could replicate even a fraction of your teamwork then we could do so much more…”
“We can definitely use that as a bargaining chip, but you are forbidden from approaching this while it’s framed as ‘protecting a damsel in distress’. You’ll just push her away again.” Harry led Draco to stand beside the window and watch the stars struggle to peek out through the murky mist that was settling over the evening. “I don’t want to push her away, especially when she’s vulnerable. She won’t talk about it. She feels like she’s said enough already.” Harry clenched the window sill, and Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, resting his pointy chin on his lover’s shoulder.
Harry sighed, caught Draco’s eyes, and tilted his head toward the empty chair across from him. When Draco finally settled into the chair he squared his shoulders. This wouldn’t be easy. “Hermione isn’t the kind of woman to back down from a fight. She won’t be cowed by something like this.” He took a long sip of tea before smiling at his lover. “She was always like that though. Don’t you remember?” He took Draco’s hand across the table and stroked the back of it with his thumb.
“That was meant for you. He’s going to burn for this, Herms.” Harry’s voice was low and filled with malice. Not usually one for public displays of affection, Harry allowed himself to be embraced by the two whom he loved and let his rage flow out of him.
“What the fuck Kreacher?” Harry swore as he jumped up, wand pointed at the door, his eyes adjusting to the blurry shapes of Kreacher and what looked like a balled up Hermione. As the shock wore off he pulled on his glasses.
“Come on love, let’s get you into bed, yeah?” He turned to look at Hermione and tilted his head. She nodded absently and allowed Harry to lead her up to her bedroom. Her mind was racing as he closed the door behind them and turned her away from him as they reached the bed. His hands slowly unzipped her dress and slid it down letting it pool on the floor. He unclasped her strapless black bra and let it fall to her feet, slid his hands down to unhook the garters from her stockings, each small touch sent fire through Hermione’s body and left her throbbing.
“If you two are quite finished. I have an announcement. Robards has given me the final signature and I am officially an Auror starting tomorrow. Can we please go get a drink?” Harry was on the verge of begging. Hermione had been spending more of her free time with Ron lately and he missed seeing his best friends. Though he was happy that their relationship seemed well, the amount of fighting between them seemed to be dwindling into something more comfortable as the relationship went on.
“He was lucky that Hermione is always over-prepared. Her quick thinking bought him enough time to find a cure.” Draco crossed his legs. “So, Molly, has Ronald been in contact with you lately? Requested anything unusual from you?”
Harry shook his head as he made his way to the storage cabinet where he knew he would find the extra phials. Everything in Sev’s lab was meticulously organized and so Harry easily found them on the third shelf down, fourth over from the left. He pulled four phials out and brought them to the right side of the cauldron and went back to retrieve the sealing wax and labels without being prompted. This wasn’t the first time he had played errand boy to Sev while he was finishing up a ministry order. Though many would have thought it beneath someone of Harry’s station he found it endearing that the intractable potions master trusted him enough to handle small tasks and ease a bit of the burden off the man.
“Of course that’s what it’s called Mione. You can’t always be lovey dovey with your husband. There are rough patches and love potions can help you see sense past an argument. Kiss and make up, isn’t that what the muggles say?” Ginny crossed her arms and stood next to her mother, nose turned up as though Hermione was stupid. “It’s not like you and Ron didn’t have your fair share of arguments when you first got together.”
“Ron, you need to leave. Before she does something drastic.” Bill turned Ron back toward the door and firmly pushed him toward it.
“Teach me.” Harry whispered and Death reached out to caress Harry’s cheek, a jolt of power rushing through his skin. The power spread through his body, leaving a prickling sensation behind where it touched. Harry’s mind was filled with visions of the previous masters being taught this same summoning. Pulling their magic and their connection to Death into their hands and speaking the name of the hallow they wished to summon. The vision stopped abruptly and Harry found himself on his hands and knees before Death, his chest heaving as he sucked in lungfuls of air. The sensation of drowning had been nearly overwhelming.
“Oh, the usual. Conquer all humans, enslave them to their rightful feline overlords, build temples honoring our new masters.” Draco was taken by surprise as Crookshanks bashed his squashed face into his chin and rumbled a deep satisfied purr before sauntering off to parts unknown.
“I’m sorry Ronald, but I really can’t be late for this appointment with Minister Shacklebolt. Look, even Percy has had to come down and fetch me.” She tilted her head toward his older brother who had begun to walk over. “Can we discuss this some other time? I really do have to go.” She pulled her wrist free and his grip tightened on her shoulder.
“Of course, Mione. I’ll pick you up for lunch from your offices and we can discuss your return home.” Ron’s voice had a tone of command and he released her as Percy sidled up with a cough and a “Pardon me, Auror Granger. Ronald.”
“How many times do I need to apologize for today before you let me eat off your plate, Granger? How was I meant to know that we would get pushed out of the servants’ quarters for implying that Holly abandoned the family? Runaway house elves used to be the norm.”
“Harry, you know that’s not true. Viktor was the only one who even noticed me back then, and that was fourth year.” Hermione pulled away and sat at the table, pouring their wine. “If anyone else had been interested I’m sure Viktor wouldn’t have been the first person to ask me out on a date. He wouldn’t have been my first kiss, among other things.”
Draco stepped forward and took a seat directly in front of her, reaching through the small space that separated them he grasped her chin and tilted her face until she met his eyes. Satisfied with what he saw he spoke softly, “The team checked over him, he’s here with us. He’s off terrorizing some unsuspecting creature, I’m sure. He will eventually deign to grace us mere mortals with his presence now that you are awake.” He smiled impishly at the implication that Harry and he were below Crookshank’s notice.
Harry pulled away and sank into one of the dining chairs. “You don’t understand.” He muttered, gazing deeply into his tea.
“Ready?” Harry poked his head through the kitchen door frame. He smiled at the domesticity of Hermione straightening Draco’s clothes. “We are going to be only on-time if you keep fussing. I know you love being early.” He teased.
When he comes out of the bathroom, the apartment smells of food, and he glances at the bedroom door, making sure it’s shut so the smell doesn’t get into their clothes.
“Ok so we’re going to dive straight into just spells,” Harry says, rubbing his palms against his jeans. “I’m sure you know how to wave a wand.”
Harry glances back at him, looking at the older teen. He looked worried and out-of-sorts, his nose still red. Harry avoids the question.
“You know you’re not slick, right? I know you think I’m obsessed with Potter, but I’m not, you wankers.”
“Harry! Harry!” She’s chasing him through the hall, waving his forgotten glasses in the air. He spins around and sees the girl a few feet away from him, out of breath.
Slumping his shoulders, Draco tilts his head back, facing the ceiling, “yes, well. I’m not exactly sure why I did that.”
The first tutoring lesson is difficult. Potter comes late, swaggering in with windswept hair and love bites crawling up his neck, fueling the fire sitting in Draco’s chest. He can’t pinpoint the center of his emotions but chalks it up to pure jealousy, jealousy that Potter was able to bounce back from everything and revered by all.
Malfoy nods and exits the room first, leaving without a goodbye. Harry doesn’t mind, his head full of cotton after being around Malfoy for this long. He thinks he hates Malfoy... The boy represents everything Harry refuses to be. But deep down, Harry can’t help but wonder if this hatred is due to years of thinking of him as the enemy, the
a quick heads up: i have read hundreds of other drarry fics, as such, there are a multitude of plot points that i may have accidentally taken.. linked onto the bottom of this chapter is a list of a fics in which i remember hearing about these plot points & i take a significant amount of inspiration from. however, if you see something in the fic that you recognize from your own writing, don’t hesitate to shoot me a message on my tumblr @sincerely-sia. i have no qualms about adding to the list :)
The red liquid explodes upwards, covering Harry’s face. His hands immediately fly upwards, trying to get the burning position off his face. Ron and Hermione are beside him instantly, smart enough not to touch him or throw spells, but muttering words of support as Harry shakes.
i know it’s been a while, but i’m here! not fully back, but here’s a slightly longer than chapter than usual to make up for my short absence!
Draco leans forward, ready to grip Harry's hand when a scream reverberates through the tower. It scares Draco and he topples backward, balance lost.
Vargas stares at Draco for a few seconds, “Malfoy. You’re not seeming to understand. There’s very little choice for you.” Draco stares back, even more confused.
The wind whips through his hair, and Harry feels as if he’s in the middle of a Quidditch game, soaring at break-neck speeds towards the snitch. But instead, he sees Draco Malfoy falling through the hair, his robes whipping around. The older boy is silent as he falls through the air, but other people scream as they watch him plummet.
“Professor Slughorn, you needed something…?” Harry trails off as he sees Malfoy perched on a wooden stool.
“I’ll do it. Let’s, let’s go Malfoy.” Vargas nods triumphantly, and turns back to grading, an obvious dismissal. Draco lets out an angry groan and stalks out of the room, Potter at his heels.
“What?” Malfoy spits, a little offended. Even though Harry’s not sure why. Malfoy’s a coward, Neville hasn’t been one for years. But Harry does explain.
“Am I serious? You’re tutoring me in Potions, which, by the way, sounds terrifying, and now you’re being an arse about me tutoring
Ginny almost chokes on her laughter, and she has to push Harry away from her to fully keel over and laugh. And laugh and laugh. “Merlin, Harry. You’re a lost cause. You’re lucky I’m in love with you, or I’d have smacked you long ago.”
Dinner is the most difficult. Mondays and Wednesdays, Harry was in charge of coming home earlier and making dinner; Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays were usually Draco’s responsibility. They’d come home and make dinner or maybe buy it from a cheap restaurant on their street; each night treated like a date. Draco would laugh at his eccentric meals, recipes found from the depths of the internet. And Harry would fall a little bit more in love with Draco as he cooked (and baked!) foods that reminded Harry of home (of Hogwarts).
Burying his head in his hands for what feels like the fifth time today, Draco imagines a Potions tutoring class with Potter at the other end of the table. He pulls memories from past Potions lessons and sees Potter blowing both himself, and Draco up. Draco scraps any idea of hands-on potions making. Then he imagines trying to teach Potter the basics, as Draco had learned as a child. He can only see Potter whining and throwing a fit. Scrapped.
“I never should’ve made Coq au Vin. It’s almost like I can hear her admonishing me for making it just a little too spicy.” Draco cries. “Oh— I miss her so much.”
Draco narrows his eyes at her, but indulges his friend, “it’s boring. I had him read my potions textbook yesterday…” He’s interrupted by Pansy’s voice.
Potter stares at Draco for a few seconds and then flips open Draco’s old textbook, a little more intrigued than before.
Harry Potter looks upward, his eyes searching for lightning in the sky, a phenomenon only in the world outside of Hogwarts. His eyes catch onto a shadow atop the astronomy tower. A lone figure lined in black, standing at the very edge of the tower, bright white hair clear against the darkness of his background.
The castle begs for Harry Potter to save their lonely boy, the magic cracked and broken at the thought of one more lost student.
“Ok! I’m mixing the gingerbread cookies and they’ll be done in an hour, there’s eggnog in the fridge—”
When Draco finishes on his phone, he begins to eat, smiling around his spoon: the food tastes just like his mom’s. Harry comments on this.
“Argh,” Draco groans as he is thrown forward from the force of Weasley’s spell interacting with his own.
Draco wants to know when his time is. He wants to know when the pain will stop, he wants to know when the angry letters from his weak father will stop, he wants to know when the pleading letters from his strong mother will stop, he wants to know when it will
He slips into the Gryffindor common room, ignoring Hermione’s bewildered look at his return. Harry runs up the stairs and into his dormitory, flapping a hand at Ron, who looks like he’s just woken up from a nap. Throwing open his trunk, Harry sticks his hand inside, searching for the wand.
“Sorry. I was… with a friend.” Potter’s ears flush slightly. He'd like to appear nonchalant, but his body seems to give him away.
Draco raises his eyebrows at her and watches as she tunes back into her novel, obviously dismissing the older boy. He’s got no want to go to the Quidditch pitch and find out what’s going on, so he heads up to his dormitory. Being alone wasn’t one of Draco’s favorite activities (having spent too much time alone in the Manor), but the always gurgling water of the Lake, and the churning of the pipes down in the dungeons were a comforting sound, lulling him to sleep.
“Come back after class tomorrow. I’d like to speak to you, now go,” Vargas orders, then turns his back to Draco, attention on the other students. Draco stands slowly, and with Pansy makes his way through the classroom and out the door, sparing a cursory glance behind him. The class seems to already have moved on, Weasley absorbed into Potter’s group. Potter turns to look at him, and they make eye contact, the connect searing into Draco. He hurriedly breaks it and spins back around, intent on leaving the classroom without making another scene.
They weren’t supposed to be friends. Not at all actually. A death eater & The Boy Who Lived (twice)? absolutely forbidden. However, as Hogwarts would have, it pushed them together, but not long after, the world intervened, and the results of its intrusion have yet to be seen.
Harry is successful, however, as the broomstick slows the fall just enough that hitting the ground is not fatal, rather it’s simply just backbreaking (a job for Madam Pomfrey to fix). The two boys slam against the ground, tangled around each other. They pass out instantly from the pain, but they’re alive. They’re alive. The castle and her magic rejoice. And although the year would prove to be innumerably difficult, the two boys are alive, and well enough to breathe enough for each other.
Draco nods, not deigning to reply. Sitting up, Pansy leaves a chaste kiss on his forehead, sweeping back his hair. She leaves the room with a sad smile, letting her best friend stew in his own thoughts.
The rest of the afternoon goes much like this: Harry laughs, he smiles and jokes, Su’s smitten and charmed, and it doesn’t take long for Harry’s hands in her hair and hers in his shirt.
“When’s our first session?” Harry calls at Malfoy’s back but doesn’t receive an answer. Jogging after Malfoy, Harry repeats himself, “when?”
Potter glances down at the thick tome, back to Draco, and back down, “how am I supposed to learn from this?” he questions, confused.
“Malfoy! I asked you to stay behind today,” Vargas orders from his desk, not glancing up from grading papers. Pansy gives Draco a frown and continues to pack up her things, Blaise already gone to the baths. Draco slumps his shoulders and approaches Vargas’s desk.
Harry cocks his head to the side, “you volunteered for this Malfoy, you don’t have to be such an arse about it.”
It's easy to forget. He’d blink and the memory was gone, another laugh and smile forgotten. The little wrinkles outside Draco’s eyes, the white scars scattered on Draco’s chest, forming patterns Harry loved to trace with his tongue. But some days, Harry blinks and he can almost hear Draco, can almost feel Draco’s skin under his fingers, can almost see Draco’s scars on his chest. Those days are the worst. Harry comes back and he expects to see Draco beside him, his head thrown back, soaking in the sun, but Draco is never there.
Malfoy shoots him a dirty look, “Thursday, 8 pm, at the library. Don’t be late,” and Malfoy hurries up his walking, disappearing around the corner, leaving Harry behind.
Girls flocked to him (and so did some boys), but Ginny was always in the back of his mind, her smiling face a comfort not always awarded to him. Although they were still on their pre-war/mid-war/post-war break, Harry knew she would always be there for him, would always be the kind eyes that centered him on his worst days. Meanwhile, Ginny was pushing him to date outside of his own head, go out with girls, maybe even some boys, to really
“Only if you can,” Blaise reminds, dragging his knuckles through Draco’s platinum hair, ruffling the thin strands.
an apology: there is very little ‘british slang’ in this fic. i am so american it’s disgusting. if someone whos from anywhere in the u.k. or if you’re super versed in british slang, please comment. i’d absolutely adore for you to go through this, adding slang to make it feel more intune with the harry potter verse.
Blaise laughs, and then stands, “I can’t do this. I’m going to ask some other poor sod to untangle this thing.” He shakes his necklace in the air and leaves the room, Draco watching as he leaves.
Potter looks at him and looks back down at this potions book, the scribbles reminding him of Snape’s old textbook from sixth year. He says so.
Hermione reaches over to pat Harry’s knee, “I’m sure if you can approach a girl that’s not Ginny, you can handle a few hours with Malfoy as your student.” She smiles at Harry and picks her book back up. “Now leave, silly. You’ll be late, and Malfoy will whinge about that for hours.”
Harry flips through girls like he’s trying to check off the Hogwarts student roster. But he’s kind about it, he’s never been anything but. Every girl knows that if Harry Potter approaches them, they get his memorizing attention for as long as they can keep it. The girls try hard, they try oh so hard, but Harry’s on top of the world, nothing can keep his attention (except for Ginny Weasley, of course, her smiles leave him with stars in his eyes).
Draco smiled as he opened the door and strode into his lover’s office. “Oi, Potter, you need to see this one in person! Look at what the git sent this time.” He set the platter on the desk directly in front of Harry’s chair, turning to see two sets of eyes staring at him. Harry rose and crossed his office, Neville following behind slowly. “Malfoy, I was in a meeting. What was so important it couldn’t wait until Neville was finished?”
Hermione buried her face in Harry’s neck and wept. Their words filled her with warmth and a feeling of safety as she was nestled in their arms. She had spent so much time convincing herself that it would be easier for everyone involved if she just left without a word and distanced herself from everything until she could find the culprit. But these two men had become her home before she had even realized. They had let her into their homes and, it seemed, into their hearts and had never even hinted that they loved her as much as she loved them. She pulled back and lifted slightly to put her weight into Draco’s lap, she pulled Harry toward her and let out a small sob of happiness as she pulled him into a gentle kiss, trying to push all her love for him through that small connection between their bodies.
“Oh please, as if it was some momentous occasion. It’s just sex Draco.” She tilted her head in thought, “It had felt as though it was supposed to be something special at the time. I’ve come to realize that virginity is just a social construct and there is nothing fundamentally different about me compared to when I was a virgin. Except maybe my own comfort with myself and my sexuality.” She rolled her eyes and took a drink of her wine.
Draco stood and shook George’s hand. “Thank you, George, for your time. I know you’re a busy man but we really enjoyed having you lot over to the summer house.” He strode out of the office to a shouted ‘We’ll think about it.’, gave his goodbyes to Verity, and finally headed home to snuggle off the remnants of this terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.
“No, Ron, we ALL have made choices in our lives. Draco did the best he could in his situation. We have all had it out and forgiven him.” Longbottom levelled a glare at Weasley. “You don’t get to pass judgement on others as though you’re blameless. Your mistake is at least as grievous as his. So tell me, if you think we shouldn’t forgive him why would you think should we forgive you?” Longbottom could be especially ruthless when he needed to drive a point home. Everyone at the table knew about Weasley’s abandoning Harry and Hermione when they needed him in the hunt to take Riddle down.
“That defense club Umbridge had us break up? What about that would stir such deep resentment to last this many years?” Draco quirked an eyebrow and took another drink as he let George settle on his words.
Hermione rested her hand on Harry’s shoulder as the three of them watched Dean Thomas be moved to the intensive care unit of the hospital.
She heaved a sigh and nodded. “Go on then.” She pulled Neville aside and began to catch him up on the latest Rontastrophe from their Weasley brunch.
Hermione strolled into the auror department with an air of nonchalance she didn’t really feel, a side effect of working with Malfoy for nearly five years she supposed, one didn’t work with someone so in control of themselves without at least learning to project the illusion of feelings you don’t actually feel. She heard a crash from her office and scoffed. “Honestly. Boys.” She pushed the door open and her eyes fell on Draco throwing one of his many tantrums. “Are you quite finished?” She closed the door behind her and took a seat at her desk.
His patience was rewarded with Crookshanks sauntering into the kitchen, his tail held high in triumph, a look of satisfaction on his squished face. He launched himself onto the dining table and stared Draco down as if to say “Mission successful.” Draco smiled and scratched Crookshanks under the chin. “Good work, Crooks. She’ll be ready in time thanks to you.”
“Oh fuck off, Draco. The both of you are in danger because I’m here with you.” She huffed up at him, a glare settling into place.
Narcissa set her cup down and reached out to take Hermione’s hand. “Elves have lives and families that are not always tied to one filial line. The Malfoy elves, to keep their magic strong, often have spouses among the staff of other magical families, though usually it’s easiest if the mated pairs are serving the same home. Oftentimes the children are sent to other families to ‘stand on their own’ so to speak.” She leaned back in her chair and placed her hands in her lap. “It is indeed plausible that there was a family emergency, but it would have to be someone on the brink of death to make a house elf disregard their bond to their magical family in such a way...” She trailed off, lost in thought.
Harry burst back into the room and pulled off his blazer and tie. “I’m needed in the office. They’ve got a lead on the poison. I shouldn’t be gone overly long but don’t wait for me. I’ll be back for pudding.” He leaned down and kissed Draco on the lips, and turned and pulled Hermione in for a kiss and realized a hair’s breadth from her lips that she wasn’t his and diverted his kiss to the tip of her nose. “Have enough fun for me, too.” He smiled at the flush on her cheeks and took off toward the floo, rolling up his sleeves.
“Potter. I would say that you were definitely right. I am almost certain she liked the idea.” Draco tried to make a joke but Harry couldn’t get the picture of her out of his head. Bent over his desk, fingers buried in her quim, on display for anyone to see reflected in the glass panes of the window behind her. His hands were trembling a little as his cock throbbed.
“Better run, Malfoy. She’s a hellion when she’s angry.” Potter laid a hand on Draco’s shoulder and pushed him to face Hermione whose red face was poking out of their office door. Heat rose within him and colored his cheeks. Draco shoved the odd sentiment down and strode toward his office. Potter’s laughter echoed through his mind.
“Potter, she can’t stay there. It isn’t safe for her.” Draco muttered into the side of Harry’s neck.
“Our office.” Draco rolled his eyes at Harry, “While we may be forced to close the case into her disappearance, something is odd with this entire scenario and I would like to petition to open a new file. One covering our concerns.”
Draco raised his hand from its place atop Hermione’s and reached across her shoulder to stroke his boyfriend’s messy black hair in an intimate gesture of comfort. This wasn’t the first time Weasley had tried to break the two of them up and it surely wouldn’t be the last. A pang of guilt thrummed in Draco’s chest at the rift his presence in their life was causing, and yet he couldn’t feel more than mild regret at being the point of contention breaking up The Golden Trio. This was as the world was meant to be from the beginning. Draco had always been inexplicably drawn to those jade green eyes from that moment in Madam Malkin’s robe shop. It was a shame he had ballsed it up that first day, and again at the start of school, but the past couldn’t be changed. He heaved a sigh and relaxed into his partner’s side, her presence soothing his irritation. He had them now, it didn’t matter that it had taken years too long to win them over.
The pair stilled as a soft sound from the kitchen door reached them. They turned, almost in unison, to see a groggy Hermione standing in the doorway. She rubbed at her face and eyes as she made her way toward the table. “Harry. Why ‘m I at your place?” She muttered as she flopped down into one of the wooden dining chairs.
Harry nods, understanding the response, but he forgets his place, “then don’t die. Don’t do it. Get off the edge.”
“It’s going to be fine ‘Mione, right? It’ll be fine, right?” Harry says, rubbing his palms on his jeans.
to leave the comfort of Ginny’s pretty red hair in his head, but the day had come where Ginny, too, wanted to move on and move forward.
He doesn't respond to Harry's words immediately, eyes unfocused. And there’s a beat, a pause, a breath, and Malfoy's mouth opens.
“And there’s the smack.” Ginny gently smacks his cheek, letting out a peal of giggles after. After taking a few, maybe more than a few, deep breaths, Ginny gets a reign on her laughter. “Well, it
He looks up at Draco and sighs, “I’m trying. It’s just so boring.” Draco leans over, glancing at the Potions book. There are words spilled across the pages, monotonous and, of course, boring. His shoulders slip down and he waves his wand across the book, and suddenly colors appear on the page.
And then Harry blinks and he’s back in his crappy apartment, standing in the entrance to the room, work bag still hung on his shoulder, and kitchen counter dirty. There’s no music and it seems as if the apartment hasn’t been cleaned in months. He had been lucky. He’d been so lucky. And then he was unlucky, and it was all gone in a minute. A quiet, meek voice on the phone telling him of Draco’s passing, of his agonizing death, of the love of Harry’s life leaving his side too early. And he can’t help but remember the days he’d come and find someone waiting for him, someone who cared enough to ask about his day. Now he comes home to an empty apartment, peeling wallpaper, and the smell of days old pizza from inside the fridge
“What…” Potter trails off as the book seems to explode with colors and words. Draco bites his lip as he sees his notes splash onto the paper. Each of his highlights, underlined words, doodles, and margin notes are all clear for Potter to see. Draco isn’t sure what prompted him to let Potter see it all, but he imagines it has something to do with the saddened sighs that had been coming from the other student. The guilt Draco felt never decreased, sometimes angry words remedied it, but in this situation, it seemed only giving Potter a nudge in the right direction would ease Draco’s pounding skull.
Harry leans forward, intent on catching Draco before he hits the ground. And then Harry has one hand clutched on the back of Draco's robes. He pulls and pulls, clenching his legs tightly around the broomstick, careful to keep his balance. But Draco is too heavy and both boys fall towards the ground, the broomstick simply slowing the fall.
“There’s...” Draco trails off as Harry walks to the speaker and turns it on. Mariah Carey blares out of it, as the singer croons about her love. Draco breaks in an ear-splitting grin and Harry reaches his hand out for Draco, singing into the dripping spoon like it’s a mic.
Christmas is Draco’s favorite time of the year. He’ll walk through suburban neighborhoods to see the lights twinkle, and starts listening to Christmas music when the calendar hits October. Christmas has always represented the best of Draco’s family, and he harbors a warm feeling for the holiday in his chest. Harry understands Draco’s love for the season, for the day, and he lets Draco plan a day (or season) of joy.
“Alright. So, er, what do you struggle with most during Defense?” Harry questions, his wand hanging loosely in his fingers.
“Then you know how important NEWTs are for you. The Wizarding World doesn’t want you, Malfoy. I know that sounds harsh, but it’s the truth. I want you to step into the world with as many resources as I can provide you,” Vargas slams his palm into his desk, causing Draco to flinch back a step. Vargas looks apologetic at the sound but continues, “So, Malfoy, you must pass this NEWT, and Harry, here, is going to teach you.” He looks up at Potter, “aren’t you?”
Lunch is harder. Most days they’d pack their own lunches. But, on the days they’d go out and buy lunch, they’d text each other pictures of the delectable food items, hoping for an amusing fit of jealousy from the other. Now, Harry refuses to order food. He eats a simple and bland lunch, rarely leaving the four walls to talk to his colleagues.
He tumbles into the adjoining bathroom, the tiny room a compromise for the big windows in the sitting room. Washing his hands in the small sink, he glances up at the mirror above, but doesn’t register anything. The gaunt look under his cheekbones, the constant redness in his eyes, the gathering wrinkles on his forehead, and the growing beard around his chin all seem to recede behind the fog that surrounds him. Harry moves in an automatic motion, every action programmed into his memory by routine. His brain is elsewhere as his body moves. Harry reaches for the body wash in the shower and knocks over Draco’s shampoo. Draco’s. His lavender honey shampoo, almost empty, but not. It’s been weeks. Weeks of it sitting there, untouched, but Harry doesn’t have the heart to discard it. To discard Draco’s things. They’re Draco’s, how could he? Harry faces the same dilemma with Draco’s clothing. They sit, hanging in their shared closet, a constant reminder of the loss he’s faced. Some days he buries his face into Draco’s clothes, hoping for a familiar smell (he never gets one).
“It’s probably broken. Go down to the hospital wing,” Vargas waves a hand in Draco's direction, staunching the blood flow. Draco feels the class’s eyes upon him, Pansy chewing her lip in worry, and Blaise’s bemusement.
“So why the sun? I couldn’t see it from the bottom of the tower.” Harry's on a roll, one question answered, why not a few others?
? Vargas told me no one in the wizarding world wants me. And I know he’s right. So why are we in this godforsaken school? I got my
She was kind, loving, and the perfect person to break Harry’s heart. He loved her all the more for it.
Harry smiles at Draco and sits back down, “Let’s eat? We’ll call Pansy and Blaise as soon as we’re done.”
Harry swings his legs over the side of the bed, feet planting on the floor. Getting up from bed seems to get harder every day, as if the loss of his other half sets in deeper as time passes. As if the missing limb of his body is aching in phantom pain, and the pain is chronic.
“I’ve got a task. I've got to hurt someone. Someone important. More than hurt. I've got to kill them. I've hurt other people along the way. The wrong people,” he sounds like he’s recited this before, “If I don’t kill them, if I don’t complete my task, he’ll kill my parents. He’ll kill them. And I can't be the reason my parents die.” Malfoy’s tears have dried on his cheeks and his fists are clenched at his side, face stoic & void of emotion.
“Nope, I don’t want to hear it,” he says, “Malfoy, I’m going to be honest with you here. You’re not going to pass your Defense NEWT at the rate you’re going right now.”
That evening, as a way of distracting Hermione from her Weasel problem, Draco convinced her into dressing up with them and getting take-out and having a fancy dinner in their dining room. Harry and Hermione were on a mission to pick up their food as Draco charmed candles to float above the dining table. He was putting the finishing touches on the room when a tapping on the window reached him.
“Mistress cannot leave. She is in danger.” Kreacher croaked up at her, his face twisted into a scowl.
They left the office without incident and spent the greater part of the day with the house elves of the Patil family to leave with as much information as they had when they arrived. No one in the house knew where Holly had gone, or to what purpose. Just that she must have been taken because she would never leave her family and refuse their summons of her own free will.
“I thought the Ministry had contractors that were able to look into these sorts of things.” George’s staring was starting to make Draco itch to move. To do something.
Thank you for your patience with this story which can be slow to update. We lost two more employees at my job so everyone is pulling doubles and six day weeks until we can get more bodies trained. Also, just a quick warning that the latter two thirds of this chapter are a bit lewd and if that’s not to your taste I apologize. I won’t blame you for skipping it, but I feel like it serves as an intimate insight into our main characters and I hope that if you choose to read it that it is enjoyable.
The chatter died down as all eyes turned to Hermione and Arthur. “I hope you’ll accept my apologies for what happened at the Burrow that time. I’ve spoken with them and tried to impress upon them the wrongness of his treatment of you, love. I’m sure they’ll come around.” His smile turned sad and Narcissa reached out and squeezed his hand.
“Hermione mentioned that my brother has the resurrection stone in his possession.” Harry paced the ritual circle inlaid into the floor of the room in glimmering silver.
“Darling, I am so glad to see you so much yourself again. I know we haven’t had much close contact this last decade but I had heard of your predicament through my dragon and had my suspicions that the youngest Weasley boy was mistreating our traditions. Arthur,” She turned and frowned at the Weasley patriarch. “Just what has gotten into that boy’s head? Using love potions like that.” She scoffed and patted Hermione’s hand when the girl stiffened.
“Hermes, you know protocol. You know we can’t allow you to be living at a crime scene, let alone a clearly unsecured location while there is a psychopath on the loose attempting to harm you.” Harry’s face colored as he pulled himself up in his seat and squared his shoulders, readying for a fight.
“Really now, Auror Potter, you know me better than that. No one allows, or disallows, me to do anything. I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself in the event of an emergency.” Hermione leaned in toward Harry as she spoke “In fact, you may recall, that I am one of the best aurors in the entire department and that, if anything, should be enough proof that I can take care of myself.” She planted her hands firmly on the table, ready to spring into action.
“Hermione, please tell us how the latest case is going. The Prophet doesn’t give many details, unless of course they are gory and sensational.” Neville smiled encouragingly at the witch nestled in Draco’s side. Hermione launched into a detailed explanation of the non-confidential parts of their investigation and his eyes met Harry’s over top of her head. Harry’s indulgent smile caused Draco’s heart to quicken and a blush to creep up his throat and color his cheeks.
“Well, you see, one Christmas we were all set to go to the Weasley’s and Draco-” Harry’s mouth was firmly covered by a hand.
“Look, Alice, I know Kensington put you up to this. I’m not upset with you, honestly.” Hermione rose and circled her desk, gesturing toward the door. “But Auror Malfoy and I have our hands full, and while we would love to help out new trainee classes, we don’t want to be put through all the spectacle of it. We went through our classes like everyone else, even Kensington before us, we really are nothing special.”
Author’s note: Updates will probably be slow, since I am writing this in my limited free time and this is my first time writing something that isn’t only a straight up slice of life, romance, or smut story. I’m doing my best to put thought into the story I want to tell, how I want to direct the readers, and how many hints I want to drop. Thank you all for baring with me while I try and write a mystery along side my love story. Please feel free to give me feedback as we take this journey together. I’m in your care.
Narcissa’s chuckle warmed a place in Hermione she hadn’t realized had gone cold. A piece of her heart that had longed for the acceptance of those born to this world. She smiled and continued, collecting herself, “Draco and I have just closed a missing house elf case, though it’s not as interesting as some would have you believe. A family’s elf had gone missing and it was unlike her to leave without some kind of notice,” Narcissa nodded along, listening intently. “So during the course of our investigation she turned up in our office, of all places, and gave the explanation that she had been urgently called away by an ailing family member.”
Trainee Auror Harry Potter had risen quickly through the ranks, with his own skill and hard work he hoped, and was the first to be promoted to full Auror out of their class. Though, somehow Malfoy and Hermione always seemed to be right behind him on the scorecard. Hermione he had expected, but he had never anticipated Malfoy putting in the amount of work that he had. When the paperwork was finalized he approached the shared office of his best friend.
Draco nodded and finished off his tea. “Just a couple more questions, Molly, and then this formality will be out of the way.” He smiled invitingly, leaning on his charming nature to put her off guard.
“I need to ask you some questions, so please answer as best you can.” draco pulled out his notepad and flicked his wand at it and pulled his ballpoint out and enchanted it to take dictation temporarily. It wasn’t a dictionary-quill but it would do in a pinch.
“It would go so much faster if I could just help you look. We always figure it out in the end.” She pushed at his shoulder in a wordless gesture for him to get off her legs. She swung them over the edge of the sofa and pulled him up beside her. Draco sunk into her side and intertwined their fingers, seeming to seek out her touch whenever he was having a worse than usual day. Moments like this were becoming more commonplace as the three of them settled into life with her here. Hermione found herself relaxing around them more and feeling less like an intruder or a nuisance as time went on.
Draco collapsed back onto the sofa and watched his partner pace, it was routine for her to lose focus on the world around her as she worked on a problem. He pulled his wand and gave it a casual flick to pull the coffee table out of the way of her shin as she passed too close. It seemed their night would be spent working out what he had overheard and the significance of it. It would be a long night to go with his even longer day.
Harry stepped through the side entrance to Valere Apothecary, pulling his cloak from his shoulders and folding it over his arm. Severus would be expecting him after that note, he was sure. It seemed the pressure he had put on Saint Mungo’s must have worked to give access to Severus for the details of Dean’s condition. With quiet steps he made his way to the basement lab and stopped with his hand on the handle. Harry took a steadying breath and braced himself before he opened the door and intruded into the potion master’s sanctum.
Molly placed a steaming cup of tea in front of him and started pulling out biscuits to accompany it. She settled down across from him with her own cuppa and smiled at him. “Well to what do I owe the pleasure, dear?”
“Is Crooks alright?” Her voice quavered, “Draco, he isn’t-” The words got caught in her throat. Unable to voice her fears.
“Thank you. Molly have you baked any cakes lately?” Draco rolled his eyes at her as if he were offended to even be asking the question.
The crowd around them milled more slowly than usual, as if hoping to catch the latest drama first hand. Hermione’s eyes scanned the atrium looking for a quick way out of the situation. They fell upon a concerned looking Percy Weasley, he seemed torn between letting things play out, as he knew she was no damsel in distress, and coming to her rescue because the entire family was intimately aware of how their “love story” had unfolded.
Percy placed a hand on Bill’s shoulder and smiled at Narcissa, “Father has taught us well that love potions are exclusively used after the problem is already resolved and used as a tool to, well, pardon my phrasing, but for lack of a better explanation, used to ‘fuck and make-up’” Harry choked on his tea hearing Percy the Perfect say the word ‘fuck’.
“I'm terribly sorry love, but you’re a bit drunk and I can’t take advantage of you like that.” He stroked her cheek with his thumb, “I won’t.” He pulled away and left her there, nearly naked, soaking wet, needy, and completely utterly unsatisfied.
Harry pulled back and cupped her cheeks with his hands, gazing adoringly into her brown eyes. “Hermione, we’ve talked about it, many times, and if you’ll have us then we want you to be ours. His, mine, and ours. For as long as you’ll have our sorry arses. We have been so desperately in love with you that you brought us together and we ended up loving each other as much as we loved you.” He layed kisses all over her face as he spoke and ground his hips into hers, pressing his erection into her, as if to punctuate his desire. “We knew, when he’d stolen your heart, that we would love you from afar and as platonically as we could manage, but we kept slipping. Kept taking liberties. We knew that we could never forget our love for you was the furthest thing from platonic and so we tried to give you distance, because you seemed so. Fucking. Happy. With that piece of dragon shite.”
“Honestly Malfoy, can’t you even dress yourself?” Hermione clicked her tongue at her partner as she straightened his tie. Eyes bent to the task she missed the smirk that passed over his lips.
Hermione looked up from her book as the floo flared green and an exhausted Draco stepped from the flames and all but collapsed across her lap with a sigh. “I take it the search was fruitless.” She reached down and patted him on the head.
“If there’s someone to avoid provoking, it’s our girl Granger.” Draco grinned and slashed his wand over the cake while muttering a detection charm. “Well, no sign of a love potion in this one. It should be fine to consume.”
Molly’s smile dropped and she wrapped her hands around her cup. “So this is an official visit, then, Auror Malfoy?”
The words took a moment to really sink in, and the moment she understood them her eyes widened and she turned in her seat to face Draco.
“We’ve gotten word that the Patil’s house elf has returned home unharmed.” Draco leaned his weight against the door and crossed his arms with a scowl.
“The usual contractor for potions and poisons is breaking it down already. What I came to ask you was if you knew of anyone who would want to harm Hermione Granger. Possibly even kill her.” Draco stared pointedly at George and rubbed a thumb over the cut glass tumbler. “I am doing my best not to automatically assume the worst of a certain red-haired menace. So please, be honest.”
Harry stood and handed the file to Hermione, ushering them toward the door. “Let’s call it a day. Send that for processing, get your new file set up, and let’s get takeaway and watch a movie. I’m exhausted.” He kissed Draco on the cheek and opened the door, shooing them from his office.
“Alright, I’m ready to go.” He pushed the door open and was met with the sight of Draco tilting Hermione’s face up toward him as he whispered something to her. Her face flushed from more than just her wine, her eyes flicked to him nervously and she licked her lips. A nervous habit of hers. Draco released her and nodded once, his point apparently proven, and he herded Harry back to the floo. “Don’t dally Potter.”
Draco nearly dropped the container of curry rice on the table in surprise. “You, and Krum?” He choked out. “He was your first?”
“Hullo Verity. I came to ask George something about a case. I didn’t know he was in a meeting.” He stepped away from the door toward her to relieve her of the case of prank items she had obviously just carried in from storage. He watched as her face paled and pulled into a worried frown. She muttered something that sounded vaguely like ‘not again’ before marching over to the lab door and pounding on it.
Hermione whirled on the owner of the hand that had snatched her and glared up at the face of her ex-lover. “Ronald. This is highly inappropriate.” She hissed at him as she pulled at her wrist. His grip tightened and he smiled at her.
“He can’t be serious. I knew he was dim, his OWL scores told us that much, but I didn’t think he was dim enough to believe that you would actually move back to his place at the first sign of trouble.” He began pacing the small space, his planner held behind his back. “I know that our laws allow his sort of behavior, sometimes even encourage it, but usually the participants are willing. After doing that to you, I can’t believe this. You can’t go back there Hermione.” He stopped and faced her, rigid and exuding righteous fury.
“But Granger, it’s date night. He should have set an alarm like I did. I’m starving you know. Wasting away, I am. My dear oblivious husband is letting me waste away. You don’t even have the decency to feed me while I’m waiting. You’re a terrible wife.”
Draco nodded and continued, “While there is a detailed account in the file it was actually Winky’s friend Dippet that reported Holly’s suspicious activity to us. Winky brought the information to me and I followed up with Dippet today. I was just arriving back from that when I ran into Holly in my office.”
“Now, enough of that Arthur.” She gave his hand a firm shake. “We mustn’t dwell on that, we have a delicious meal ahead of us and many happy memories to make.” Narcissa snapped her fingers and a small group of well dressed house elves levitated their meal out to them.
“Who’s… where did this come from?” Potter is excitedly flipping through the pages, the fun notes in the margins intriguing him. Draco doesn’t respond, turning back to his own book instead.
“Got it!” Harry calls, tossing the hawthorn wand at Malfoy. He doesn’t catch it, letting the wand fall onto the floor before him.
Harry’s eyes widen a little, he’s completely forgotten about the hawthorn wand sitting at the bottom of his trunk. He knows Malfoy doesn’t trust him, and even though the sight of the other student gave him a nauseous feeling, Harry knows he has to return the wand, and fast.
“Is this because you broke up with Ginny?” Su Li asked, her eyes narrowing. Although she’d been shy all her life, the scars on her back had left her with anger and no lack of confidence in her worth.
Harry wakes up every morning this way. Every morning since Draco died, he forgets for the first few sleepy seconds before his brain begins to function, reaching for the man with whom he’d believed he’d spend the rest of his life with.
Harry’s been unable to wash Draco’s pillow. He leaves it as it is, not touching it (Draco hated when he’d touched it), leaving it waiting for him to return. The pillow is dusty with unuse, but no matter, it won’t be moved for a while: Draco will always need a place to sleep.
