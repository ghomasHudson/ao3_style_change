"Wow, wow, take it easy. I don't mind." He held up his hands in surrender and hoped to reassure her. He didn't understand where the sudden distress came from, it was only a rag. Certainly not something to get all troubled about. "Here," He said, hand held outstretched, "I'll put it back where I found it."
Harry could do nothing more than…than stare! What else was he supposed to do when Draco was looking at him like a man dying of thirst?! No, but honestly. He was looking at Harry like he was a four-course meal! With dipping sauce! Seeing him like that, with his hair all ruffled and his lips shining so brightly…
Although that last one seemed a bit out of reach, it was still a possibility. He'd never expected Draco to ask something like that!
Harry was writing the things down Snape was saying. He already had an idea that he wasn't going to be good at potions.
Hermione stared at the two, looking a bit disoriented. Switching her gaze from their joined hands towards their flustered faces. Eyes widening when she finally caught on.
Harry landed his head on the Gryffindor table and groaned in defeat. And to think he wanted to get closer to the Slytherin.
But he decided not to think too hard about it, feeling himself only getting more and more confused as he thought about it.
"I know, I know! You don't have to apologize, I'm just…tired. Really, it isn't your fault," Harry explained, giving his friend a toothy grin. It wasn't exactly a lie, he was indeed tired, not having slept that well considering with all that was going on. His vampire gnawing at the back of his mind, wanting to go to the room of requirement and hold their pretty little boyfriend. Which ended up with his human self-being weirded out that he actually thought that.
Not that they cared though, they were just afraid Harry was going to rip their heads off when he got the chance. Of course, Harry would never do that, he wasn't a mindless beast. But just to be sure, they didn't try to cross Harry too much.
want you talking to me again. Understand?" Harry said and the whole hall was quiet, he walked away, Hermione and Ron following him, not caring what the answer was and not noticing Draco crying and saying the words; "I understand."
"Oh, such a handsome boy," Voldemort said, with his food on Cedric's face. And Harry had enough of this game.
"Well, sometimes when we're sitting next to each other or talking about something he suddenly gets all annoyed and sulky," He explained, frowning as he thought back to it. "He sometimes says these weird things that throw me off a little,"
Draco looked at Hermione, seeing her slowly slipping out of control, much like himself. He knew they could make it though, and gave Hermione a firm nod as to say; "Don't worry, we'll get through this." Before turning towards one side.
His fingers dipped between her legs, pulling apart her folds with practiced ease. She looked down, wanting to see what he was planning but not really able to do so. The position, together with the hand in question, obscured her view and left her anticipating whatever was to come.
Harry didn't understand why he couldn't just read one. Finally someone paid attention to him but of course, the Dursleys just wanted him to stay miserable.
. It was incredible! He couldn't believe Harry would do that for him, take care of him like that, it made him that much more in love with the raven-haired boy.
"And it was horrible," Harry said, which, it truly had been. But looking at Draco's look of disbelief. Thinking about what he'd just said…'Dear God,' Harry thought. 'I am a stalker!'
Ron willed himself to look at her eyes and nod, not trusting himself to let his voice out. That shirt left way too little to the imagination, DAMN HIM AND HIS DIRTY MIND! He was thankful enough for her not having noticed the bulge in his pants but
So that's how Harry got here, on the seventh floor. He looked at the marauder's map seeing that the Malfoy sign was did Malfoy keep returning to the seventh floor every night?
"I said don't deny it! Why would you otherwise avoid me, be nice, and helping others, hm?! Why would you otherwise stop mocking me and my friends?! Why would you otherwise date that slut?!" Harry yelled furiously.
Harry bit the inside of his lip as his blush that had faded away only an hour ago came back full force. He pressed his lips together, swallowing uncomfortably as he rubbed the back of his head.
"I thought somewhere around noon, we would be able to picknick on the ice and watch as the giant squid swims past us," Draco answered. "And when the sun's starting to set we can go back inside and go warm up at the fireplace with some hot chocolate…and for you I suppose hot blood. It will be great!"
"Yes mother you told me all about it, but why did I have to go with you?" Draco said, his voice hoarse from all the crying. They turned another corner of the dark street, and Draco got the feeling they were being followed but was too emotionally tired to care.
He'd had these contemplations before, right after the holidays when he saw Harry walking side by side with
See, Hermione wasn't one to ask for help often. She was the one to help. The one who seemed to have everything under control. And when she ever did ask for help it where simple things like, hide her from him; hand her this; please kill the giant troll that's trying to kill her. Never had she ever asked Harry for help in expressing her
He moved the finger deeper inside of him, feeling the muscles constrict around them as he searched for
Harry saw Ron was still smiling his tight smile at her but when she walked out of the hall, the smile disappeared instantly. He immediately turned to Harry and looked at him with something that was close to panic.
Both him and Draco turned their faces to the entrance, with Harry instantly freezing up when he realized who had walked in on them.
And then Lupin howled, almost exactly like Malfoy but still somehow… different. It started to walk towards us fangs on display.
More death eaters tried to hold him down, tried to kill or knock him out, but no one was successful.
Harry looked at her face in a slightly concerned manner, only now seeming to notice her lack of response and flustered eyes.
Ron took a few breaths as he tried to get his beating heart under control. He could feel a blush spreading on his face as he cursed himself for not having noticed her. Damn Neville for not having warned him she was heading their way. He could have given him a sign! Like a wink or something! Anything to avoid this awkwardness. But nooo, mister needed to keep squinting at him, like he didn't understand what was asked of him.
"I'm getting fed up with everyone, Theodore, Blaze especially Pansy!" Malfoy said, which made him open up his ears even more.
Harry sighed, taking his necklace from under his shirt as he started fumbling with it, holding it between thumb and forefinger. He smiled a bit when the wings unfolded themselves and forward to flap up and down, wanting to be released. He hadn't taken it off for even one second after Draco gave it to him. It was a token of his affection for Harry and the thing that was giving him, the slightest reassurance that Draco did have feelings for him and that he wasn't imagining it.
"I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory. Cho spends half her time crying these days." Hermione said while Harry was still thinking about if he really had been in love.
"What?! No, no no no! I don't even know her!" Harry tried to explain hastily. It was just, after Hermione's explanation Harry had also noticed he was very picky. Every girl that he thought was interesting in 'that' way he found he would lose interest in them rather quickly. It where mostly little things, he eventually didn't like how they talked, smelled, acted, looked, wrote (yes even that!). Or they were just boring.
Ginny said in a somber tone but was stopped by Dumbledore who said, "Wiser wizards than you have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss Weasley. No, I think you've endured enough. I would suggest a bit of bed rest, however. And perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up."Reassuringly to Ginny.
, especially if he was still busy trying to control his creature. He was grateful of Luna, who was helping him every week with it.
And much to Harry's surprise; he didn't. Didn't give Ron even one nasty remark like he usually would. He just stood there, his stance deflating a bit and he seemed a little…
"Whooo is it?" Ron asked, his brows lifting up and down in a suggestive manner. And that was really not helping the situation.
"No. Umm… Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important." Harry said thinking back to what that thing was.
Draco was heading toward Dumbeldore's office to deal with it ones and for all, but when he was near the entrence to his office he saw his father and Dobby walking out. To Draco's horror he saw his father beating Dobby even worse then he did at home! Draco was ready to stop him but instead, he hid himself, seeing Potter dashing towards them with an ugly and ruined book.
"You have thirty minutes. And start…now! "Tut, tut. Hardly any of you remembered my favorite color is lilac. But Miss Hermione Granger knew that my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair care potions. Good girl." Lockhart said. "Now... be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourself facing your own worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here." Lockhart said and he walked over to a cage with a blanket on top. "I must ask you not to scream. It might provoke them." Lockhart said.
"Please! Pleasepleasepleasepleasepleaseplease! I want it, I want you! Damn it, Harry, I can't stop thinking about how much I want you!" Draco yelled out, a sad whimper accompanying it. Harry started to move his other hand that still remained on Draco's balls upwards, finally bringing a little relief as it started to palm Draco's prick.
'It's going to be a nice day.' Draco thought, staring through one of the windows as he walked down the corridor.
"I don't know, Harry. But I think you should be careful with this. Something tells me Ron might be right. It could be dangerous." She warned.
“Something happened to Remus during the attack. After picking young Adrian up from the rubble of Godric’s Hollow I took him to the cottage where he and Fenrir had been staying only to find Remus on the floor in near hysterics babbling about Fenrir attacking him. I tried calming the poor boy the only way I knew by placing his son in his arms however Remus recoiled calling the baby Harry and not Adrian. Instantly I knew something had happened, using Legillemens I peered into Remus' mind but it was just a twisted mess and the safety of young Adrian was more important than trying to figure out what  happened to his mother at the time. That attack somehow caused Fenrir to become feral and attack of the villagers, he and Sirius were both thrown into Azkaban when they were caught. No matter how hard I tried I could not sway Fudge to have trials for them. As for Adrian's placement with Lily's sister, a month prior to James and Lily going into hiding Lily had handed me a note explaining to me that if anything had happened to her James and Adrian’s real parents that Petunia had agreed to look after him, the two sisters had reconciled their relationship after Lily graduated so she was trust worthy. As for the blood wards to make sure Adrian was never found a mixture of Fenrir and Remus' blood was used with a spell created by Fenrir's mother Selena.”
“Well….. Fuck.” Slate Grey muttered oh so eloquently a clear sign that the man was speechless. It was clear now why each room had double doors instead of a single one, it was more like an executive suite than shared rooms. A small entryway with space for cloaks to be hung in a built in closet led into a short hallway before opening up into a beautifully decorated sitting room. The walls were painted a muted grey with darker grey blackout curtains for even more privacy. What drew the eye however was the built in fire pit surrounded by two love seats and three high backed armchairs. This had been one of the main reasons why the trio had picked this hotel to be their temporary home base. Somehow the owners had established a private floo network for the hotel so their guests could come and go or talk to anyone without the Ministry being able to track their movements. Each fire pit had runes engraved into the brick to prevent the fire from escaping though the furniture was made of dragon hide just in case.
Fenrir cleared his throat picking up the story once more, “The spell used on my mate supresses a soul bond that’s why I went feral, to my wolf it felt like my mate was dead. It took five years of listening to Sirius reading cryptic messages hidden in copies of the Daily Prophet about my son's health and safety for me to claw back to sanity then bided my time until I could escape which was during the massive breakout when Adrian was 15.” He let out a snort then continued, “Voldemort thought I would be grateful and join his cause but I mauled one of the Lestrange brothers instead, shifted the moment I could then got off that godforsaken island.”
“Crass and mouthy as always, she sends her regrets on not being able to come here and help you and Fen.” Thayne replied pulling away from his nephew's hair then set him back on his feet and took a few minutes to straighten his clothes. Once he was satisfied Thayne stood with a groan stretching his 6'5 frame sighing as a few of his bones popped. “I bloody hate taking international portkeys I feel like I went through five cycles in a washing machine.” He complained earning a laugh from Adrian before he jumped up wrapping his arms around his uncle's broad shoulders in a proper hug. Eight years separated Fenrir and Thayne, it was obvious in both appearance and temperament. While Fenrir looked like he could be in his late 30's, Thayne looked like he was in his 20's instead of his actual age of 39. Like his older brother Thayne’s facial features were aristocratic with sharp cheek bones, a slender nose and a defined jaw, unlike Fenrir however the younger werewolf's mouth was always upturned into a smile that showed off his sharp canines and his midnight blue eyes were lit with mischief and humor.
“Apparently I was underfoot too much for maman that she shooed me away. She wanted to pass along a message that she won't be able to join us till after the full moon, Katra hasn't gone into labor yet and you know she doesn't trust anyone but her or Fenrir. Hopefully the pull of the moon will kick start the birth.” Thayne explained before he buried his nose into his nephew's soft white hair inhaling his scent of lemon, rain and vanilla.
“I like you already blondie, name is Thayne I am Fenrir's fun loving and far more attractive younger brother.” Thayne said holding a hand out for Draco to take in a handshake. He then let out a yelp when the back of his head was struck by his older brother as he emerged from the kitchen carrying a tray full of assorted breakfast foods while another tray and a few jugs filled with juice floated behind him. “Not to mention mouthy hurry up and conjure a table and chairs so I can put this food down you mutt.” Fenrir groused a little annoyed at Thayne for ruining a bonding moment between Adrian and Draco. The pair had no idea that there was a bond between them so the longer they spent time together the stronger it would become.
“That could work……. It has too.” Hermione whispered tears freely falling down her face as Ron got up from his seat and wrapped his fiancée in a tight embrace the only sounds in the room were Adrian's heart wrenching sobs that eventually died down into soft hiccups.
Also on another note I need some help for two chars; Draco-I'm debating on whether I should make him a creature as well. And Sirius- I can't decide if his love interest should be an canon char or an original one. Let me know what you guys think!
The grin that took over Adrian's beautiful face could only be described as ‘shit-eating' as he went up to his father who was glaring at a pouting Sirius, “I told you I was right pay up dad.” He said smugly wiggling his fingers towards the elder werewolf. Fenrir let out another growl his glare intensifying even more if that was even possible while depositing the agreed amount of galleons into his son's palm. Adrian placed a cheeky kiss to his father's cheek before he skipped to the couch where Ron, Hermione and Draco were sat, all three of them doing their best to conceal their laughter…. And failing miserably. Fenrir shot Sirius a look that clearly said they would be
“Stop pouting you're still a whelp Adri,” Fenrir stated folding the Prophet he had been reading so he could focus fully on his son, “it's only natural for someone your age to want comfort while sleeping from an elder. I'm a little sore that it wasn't me but since you haven't seen Thayne in a few days when you were used to being around him all the time in the last 5 years I can understand.” Leaning over he took Adrian's bottom lip in between his fingers and started to tug on it until he smiled and batted his hand away. Still even with those words Adrian still felt embarrassed at the fact that he tried to make a puppy pile with Thayne, thank Merlin Sirius had told him to make his own room last night before slamming the door in his face and locking it. If he had woken up in between them…. That would have been absolutely mortifying. “You will move past this phase trust me…. And may I remind you that you never seem to bawk at the idea of sleeping in a puppy pile when its with Katra, Darius, Ella and Michael.”
The three men followed the arrow down a long hallway that opened up into a small landing that had two elevator doors. One opened immediately and after a quick glance down to see that the arrow had changed into 3 to indicate what floor their rooms were. Another hallway greeted the trio painted in the same tranquil hues with double doors on either side, following the arrow once more they took 3 turns a left, right and right arriving at a dead end with one single double door. The arrow disappeared on the key card and slot revealed itself in the center of the dark mahogany door. Sliding the keycard into the slot Navy waited for a ‘click' then pulled the card back out and slipped it into the back pockets of his dark wash jeans then turned the handle opening the door.
“Apparently Mrs. Weasley has been on both Ron and Hermione’s case not only to get married but to start popping out grandbabies.” Both white eyebrows were raised in surprised this time at Draco's statement causing the blonde to laugh once more. “Did you not notice the ring on Hermione's finger?”
A/N: I am so sorry that it has taken me over a month to post this chapter. I mistakenly thought this one would be easier than the previous one... I forgot how much of the canon story I would have to rewrite to fit my plot. It took me two rewrites and a lot of cursing because I got writers block. Anyway enough of my rambling enjoy the chapter
Hermione shook off the disappointment quickly and declared that since they were done eating they could then begin researching. Ron groaned while Adrian made a note to ask Draco why he looked so agitated when Hermione brought up being an animagus.
“Ah finally everyone is here excellent.” Albus said clapping his hands together as he finally joined the others, a silver tray of tea floating behind him. Adrian followed behind the tray carrying another full of little tea sandwiches, scones and cakes. He froze for a split second when his bright blue eyes locked with grey ones before he caught himself and continued the rest of the way, avoiding Sirius' gaze since the older man was shooting him a smirk. “Please help yourself we will be here for a little while.” Albus added as he pulled a lemon drop from his robes then moved aside to give Adrian the floor.
Adrian shrugged his shoulders “you're my favorite uncle Thayne I just want to see you happy.” He replied then let out a yelp when he was pulled into a bear hug and his hair was ruffled. Adrian growled squirming hard and biting down on the exposed arm earning a deeper growl in return. He was forced to let go when fingers dug into his sides starting to tickle him and he squirmed harder until Thayne finally let him go.
“Then Fenrir please.” The older werewolf replied bowing his head in respect to the brunette. He then glanced at a muggle watch that adorned his wrist and cleared his throat, “it's getting late and I believe we should be retiring to our places of rest.” Reaching into his leather jacket he pulled out a black card holding it out for Lucius to take, “this is how you can reach our rooms at the hotel we're staying at. Once you memorize the room number place the card inside the desired fireplace and tap the rune on the back of the card, it will imprint a rune to connect that fireplace to our fire pit. Once that is complete say finite and the card will dissolve ” Fenrir then turned to Adrian,  “say your goodbyes pup then join us back home.” With a nod to Lucius and Severus, Fenrir and Sirius disappeared through the floo.
“Sirius' patronus has always been a big black dog and the one we just saw was clearly a wolf.” She looked at Adrian, “that was your Uncle's wolf wasn't it?” she asked and he nodded smugly.
by casting a simple accio he had been absolutely floored. He and the others also learned that him casually using his magic for small things wasn't because he was lazy, the smalls drains to his magical core kept it from spilling over. “What was it like? Those spells wearing off when you were seventeen?” The blonde suddenly asked.
“Uh…. I really have no idea what you're talking about paws. What…. What made you think that Sirius has… uh feelings for me?” Thayne asked trying really hard not to fidget under his nephews gaze though he realized a little too late that he just revealed that he had feelings for Adrian's godfather. “Sirius' patronus has changed slightly it's now a wolf…. Actually it bears a striking resemblance to your wolf Uncle Thayne.” Adrian replied his smug once again turning smug. Thayne was absolutely speechless his midnight eyes flitting to where he could smell Sirius' scent down a hallway.
“Out like a light?” Fenrir asked getting a nod from the animagus as he joined him at the fire pit sitting in one of the high backed chair with a soft sigh. “It's been a long day for all of us but especially Adrian. He's been eager to return home….. See his friends.” Sirius said watching as Fenrir pulled an envelope from a pocket of his leather jacket then stood approaching the pit. “Wait.” He grabbed the werewolf's arm stopping him from activating the floor, “are you sure you don't want to wait a day or two?"
“After Adrian was born a glamour and creature suppressant spell  was placed on him, the plan was to keep our son safe with the Potter’s until Voldemort was taken care of or we could secure a safe passage out of Britain. Of course that all went to hell when it was decided at the last minute to change secret Keepers and my protests were ignored.” Fenrir snarled leveling a glare at Sirius who looked both guilty and angry.
. He took a second to compose himself breathing in through his nose and letting the air back out through his mouth. Once the heat of his embarrassment had died down Adrian went back out into the sitting room to find Draco sitting in the second armchair one eyebrow raised in curiosity while holding the tea Adrian had made for him in his hand. “What?”
The four young Wizards nodded at this as by now that was common knowledge. Lucius and Severus had offered their services to Dumbledore as spies to protect Draco following the deaths of The Potters, their roles had been revealed in the department of mysteries when Lucius saved Sirius from his sister-in-law’s attack.
“Not only am I going to enjoy taking dad's galleons but also taking the mickey out of Sirius.” He said with a laugh as the four young adults went back into the castle.
The great double doors leading outside opened allowing the two men to walk through and continue on our way to the Black Lake. The mid-afternoon sun was warm but there was a nice gentle cool breeze that was blowing off of the lake so no cooling charms were necessary to keep the sweat off of their brows and necks. Taking out his wand Draco waved it on his favourite rock conjuring a comfortable blanket for the two of them to sit on so they didn’t ruin their clothes to which Adrian’s response was to simply roll his eyes. Adrian settled down on the rock getting comfortable by crossing his legs however Draco decided that  sitting beside each other would be far too awkward so he stood in front of the man folding his arms across his chest. Clearing his throat Draco tried not to fidget as he said, “so where exactly were you for five years?” Then proceeded to cringe inwardly as it sounded more like a demand than a question.
Shutting the door behind him quietly since he was sure that both his father and godfather were still sleeping Adrian turned around to go back to his room only to freeze at the sight of his smirking father sitting in one of the high backed arm chairs with a cup of coffee in his hands, because of course the bloody Alpha would be up at the crack of dawn. “I hate the full moon,” the youngest werewolf grumbled changing his course of direction to a table where a pot of hot water sat under a warming charm with cups and assorted teas. He sent a growl at his father when he heard the man let out a soft chuckle ignoring him while preparing his tea. Once he was finished Adrian plunked down on the sofa pouting.
Harry had gone onto explain that without her brilliance in coming up with the idea for the DA and the messaging coins none of them would have survived the Ministry fiasco. The necklace was a remind of how much he relied on her. Now it served as an anchor for her resolve that Harry was alive as she could feel a small tendril of his magic covering the coin, it wasn't enough for a tracking spell unfortunately but it was enough to give her hope.
“How did Adrian end up staying with the Dursley's then? They weren’t his biological family shouldn’t he have ended up with his real parents?” Hermione asked looking from Sirius and Fenrir though it was Albus who spoke.
“Honestly Ronald don't be so thick Harry… Merlin I mean Adrian has been denied his parents for far too long we need to find a way to break that spell and fast so yes we are on a time crunch.” Hermione huffed turning on her fiancée who had a small goose egg forming on his forehead where that book thrown by the brunette struck. Adrian stood coming up behind Hermione and took two of the tomes from her arms while pressing a kiss to her cheek. “Oh! Good morning Adrian.”
When Harry saw Lucius his anger became even stronger. 'Malfoy!' He thought furiously. But when he looked at Lucius terrified face it ebbed a little.
he'd just started touching himself in front of his lover. Without even a moment of hesitation…Where had all his previous sense of shame gone to?! Draco felt his cheeks coloring again, except this time he knew for sure his whole body must have been flushed by now, down to the tip of his toes!
But now? When he was three hours away from a –supposed to be- romantic date, he could feel every one of those anxieties bubbling up. Pointing out every fault, just like the Dursleys always did.
'No, no, no, NO! The one subject I don't want him in AND here he is! Can't I have one thing in this life!' Draco thought to himself while Slughorn resumed and gestured to the cauldrons bubbling before them.
"Tie," Harry said quickly before plummeting his mouth back against Draco's. Who immediately sprung into action, shifting into the Gryffindor's lap as he tried to unhook the bloody thing with difficulty. They probably should stop kissing each other for a moment…
Neville had accidentally climbed higher than he was allowed to, and Madam Hooch already began yelling, "Ahh, not again! Mr. Longbottom get down this instance."
Because no matter in what way the faceless figure would approach it, if either it where kind and generous; in which they would give Harry blood despite him not wanting to court them. Or sadistic and cruel; in which they would keep their blood away from Harry despite him suffering…it would all end up with Harry leaving him.
Draco started to fumble with his fingers as he thought of some good lie or something, anything else to distract her.
Albus looked at the baby and gently put it down on the doormat. While Hagrid was trying to keep himself together.
Was that wrong? Should he have stayed? What was he supposed to do in this type of situation?! Now he really wished he had some past experience! What was the proper thing to do?!
Following after her Ron made sure to focus on his surroundings, trying to avoid another awkward tripping moment -Although he must admit, the way Hermione was turning her head at him every ten seconds was pretty adorable- they didn't go into the portrait hole which made Ron even more confused as to where they were going. Instead, she led them to a corridor, that led to another corridor, that led to another corridor, that again...led to another corridor. It all felt vaguely familiar as if he had been here once before and when he looked at the walls they seemed...newer. The stone lighter and fresh against the rest of the castle, as if recently placed.
His wolf should have been petrified, seeing a creature so powerful. So wild. hairline Trying to bite him where he was the most vulnerable. Should have tried to break free and escape. Should have seen the commanding posture and taken it as a challenge. Should have attacked right then and there no matter how little chance he had of succeeding. Should have at least have given a warning growl as Harry gripped his neck.
"My father will hear about this," Malfoy said sounding a bit dizzy, almost stumbling against the tree.
"I'm not sure Potter, the dark side is pretty alluring," Draco said as he smirked at both of them, making Harry laugh again.
"Yeah. I'm okay. Anyway, it's worth it. It's just, learning all this makes me wonder whether if he'd known it." Cho said pitifully.
"Beautiful night isn't it," Malfoy said, which startled Harry and the bird chirped. "Yeah, you're right I say that every night. Nights are always quiet but still breathtaking. Dark but still full of light. It's calming, don't you think?"
"Hermione said it was just a dream, but I could swear I've beaten her in arm wrestling. Don't remember where or when but I do remember Hagrid standing there cheering for me with pompons."
"I am going to kill you one of these days." Draco's tone was very matter of fact, body twisting and ready to retire to his study so Harry could deal with his erection alone. But Harry gripped his sides with a startled laugh.
"It means dirty blood. Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who was muggle-born. Someone with muggle parents. Someone…like me, who's been bitten or cursed or… something else. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation." Hermione answered.
"Why are you watching Malfoy and Parkinson?" She asked making Harry turn around the corner too. He looked at the scene before him with a baffled look.
'An orphanage would give me more love than any of you!' Harry wanted to yell but he held himself back, 'It's just one night, you can do this.'
He'd built a pretty good tolerance against it; he was now able to drink it with moderation, instead of gulping it all down in one go. He was proud to say that he'd resisted drinking the –by Hermione magnified- blood bag multiple times, though it took great strength of will on Harry's part, knowing that it was just in arm's reach and he'd be able to take it so easily.
"Of course I wouldn't have!" He said, quickly stepping into Draco's personal space, taking him in his arms. "You know I would never do that,"
"Give me a break. You know a full moon makes you hungry and cranky, especially to Muggle-borns. So let me steal your food in peace."
Until now! Yes, maybe her last fifteen attempts hadn't gone like she had hoped they would. With one almost ending in Seamus' head smashed in by a flower pot –doesn't matter how that had happened- It was almost ridiculous how many times they had been interrupted, it was like people appeared out of thin air just so they could snatch Ron away from her!
Adrian, Ron, Draco and Sirius joined Hermione in Adrian’s room that morning, Thayne and Fenrir absent as the Alpha's condition on his sanity had taken a sudden turn and Thayne used an emergency portkey to take them home to Adrian's grandmother Selena. Adrian's nerves were frayed dark circles under his eyes from lack of sleep and he looked at his best friend with desperate hope. “There's a reason why creature bonds are so much stronger than normal ones and that’s because there are two parts. The first part is the instinct bond and it differs from race to race, for werewolves it's a hunt. In their wolf forms the submissive acts as prey while the dominate is the hunter, a chase occurs during a full moon and once caught the dominate will bite their submissive and vice versa. The second part of the bond is the martial bond which is the common bond, bonding ceremony and uh…. Consummation. The bonded pair would also initiate a second set of bite marks to finish the process. This type of bond is permanent meaning if one dies the other will follow.” Adrian let out a whimper and Sirius wrapped an arm around his shoulder.
The hairs on the back of Navy's neck rose as the tingling sensation of the suites wards settled into place. Glancing at his companions he dropped the deep set hood of his cloak revealing a shock of pure white hair that clearly had a mind of its own as though it was cropped short on the side the top was a mass of curls and strands that stuck up in every which way in a permanent ‘I just rolled out of bed style.’ Icy blue eyes that had a ring of pure gold around the pupil blinked a few times to adjust to the brighter lighting of the room. A small ‘oof' left his lips as a pair of muscular arms wrapped around his trim waist and lifted him a few inches off the ground in a bear hug, immediately he started to squirm with indignation. “Padfoot! Put me down I am not a child!!” He squawked nails that suddenly turned to wicked looking claws digging lightly into one of those arms lightly to make his godfather drop him.
“That's not a good thing Shaggy it means the sheep are complacent in the face of danger.” Came the reply though it was pitched so low with a growled cadence no one besides his companions heard it. A grunt followed that statement when a sharp elbow connected with his stomach from the navy robed figure. “No pops it means they feel safe, which is good….. It's been far too long.” The tone of that masculine voice brought another grunt of agreement from the figure in brown  while the figure in slate grey threw an arm around the smallest companion.
“We had two reasons for returning to the United Kingdom after five years, Adrian's constant reminding of the fact that he was long overdue with a reunion with his friends as well as an explanation for his disappearance,” Fenrir paused to level an annoyed look at his son who just smiled innocently in return. “The second reason is our well of research in regards to finding a reverse to the spell placed on Remus ran dry. The libraries we were able to go to in Canada, Italy and France had very little to no volumes pertaining to darker uses of magical bonds and memory charms. Shaggy pointed out a few weeks ago that both Hogwarts restricted section and Malfoy's personal library could help in our search.”
Thanks again everyone for the kudos! This chapter is a little shorter than the others but I hope you like it.
Also yes I used the french word for mom although if its wrong I'm sorry I stopped taking french when I was 15 and I googled it.
By the time the small group of young adults reached the Headmasters office there was a discussion between the three men about a Quidditch tournament, “Thayne said he would be here a day before the full moon. He was a chaser when he was at Illvermorny and he's been itching to have a proper match for a few months now.” Adrian finally said making Draco and Ron grin, Hermione perked up for an entire different reason of course. “Your uncle went to Illvermorny? Why not Hogwarts?”
Adrian didn’t have time to react as he suddenly had his arms full of a shaking and sobbing Hermione, he automatically wrapped his arms around her rocking them back and forth or rubbing his hands up and down her back. Tears welled up in his eyes and he buried his face in her curly hair to hide them, when they’re crying finally stopped Adrian extract himself from her embrace, opening his mouth to say something only to let out a gasp when Hermione's balled up fist collided with his stomach. All the air rush out of his lungs while he bent over, there was a growl from Fenrir while Sirius’ body was shaking from his laughter. “Hermione wha-" Adrian gasp taking in deep gulps of air.
“He'll be at Hogwarts during the full moon, that's when my father had set up the guest lesson for his class.” Draco said his mind working a plan, “The shrieking shack his too small but perhaps if we ward an area bear the forbidden forest? We would have to sedate Adrian's father just in case.” He explained suddenly moving closer to Sirius when Adrian let out another whine. Draco placed a hand on his shoulder letting out a small gasp as Adrian shifted falling into Draco's lap and burying his face in his stomach. The blonde looking at Sirius in shock but the man shook his head and rubbed his godson's back.
“Mione morning nice to see your aim is still good.” Adrian teased nodding towards Ron's forehead and the brunette flushed a little. “I'll take these why don't you grab something to eat yeah?” He took the other tomes from Hermione placing them on the couch and gently pushing Hermione towards the table. “Oh and that's Thayne beside Sirius he would be happy to answer your questions about Illvermory.” He added sending a smirk towards his uncle who merely raised an eyebrow in question, Thayne had no idea what was about to happen.
“Right uh….. Thank you Albus.” Adrian said nervously running a hand through his hair then cleared his throat. “Well you've been asked here because you were told someone had information on where to find Harry Potter.” He began before he shot a look to Sirius who just smiled encouragingly gesturing with his hand to continue. “Alright here goes.” He muttered closing his eyes. The change was slow, white hair slowly darkening and growing until it resembled a familiar mop of wild raven black hair, his body shrank to its original height of 5'5 instead of 5'7 with his clothes becoming slightly baggier. When he opened his eyes they were no longer blue but a vibrant green and he slipped a pair of round wire gold glasses on. The lightning bolt scar which had been previously hidden was now visible.
Thayne's tall figure wasn't bulked out with muscle like his brother but rather very defined like he had been lovingly carved by a sculptor, the tight clothes he tended to wear showing off his body in ways that made potential lovers swoon and enemies piss their pants. Finally Thayne took after their mother rather than father his long straight hair so black it had a blue sheen to it and it fell about mid back though he always wore it in a braid to keep it out of his face. As far as temperament went Thayne was very much the baby brother spending more time playing pranks on Fenrir rather than trying to be a leader. The only time he ever got serious was when his family was in danger thus why he stepped in to be temporary Alpha to his brother's pack when Fenrir was thrown in Azkaban. Thayne squeezed Adrian until the younger werewolf protested and started to squirm then he placed him back down on his feet. “I missed you too ‘Rian, how did everything go with your pack? I tried to ask my brother and Sirius but one growled at me and the other refused to even look at me.” He said looking a little put out since while Fenrir's reaction was a little normal, the animagus' reception wasn't.
It made Draco curious for what was in store this time. Not knowing how to prepare for whatever was to come made Draco nervous but also excited in a weird anticipating sort of way.
"Thank you, told you I was going to beat your ass one of these days," Draco said, his hand eagerly shacking Harry's. Harry let out a small laugh, trying not to dwell on his strange mind and instead, enjoying the little time they had. Not able to let that soft hand go.
Albus Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was sat behind his desk going over the some of the lesson plans his colleagues had submitted for his approval while he spelled a quill to dictate the books needed for each subject. He had finished the letters for the third years when his fireplace flared to life and an envelope came flying out and landed on the floor. With a flick of his fingers the letter levitated gracefully landed in front of him as he put the stack of parchment aside. “Perfect timing isn't it Fawkes?” he asked his familiar getting a musical trill in response. There was no seal or writing on the outside of the letter however he could feel the magic that protected it should it somehow fall into the wrong hands.
They were halfway through the library at Malfoy Manor and unfortunately no new information turned up about how to supress a soul bond let alone how to reverse it. Even information about soul bonds was scarce but Hermione refused to shift her focus to the fake memories as she now agreed with Fenrir that the bond was the most important part of the equation. The bond was also another snag as whenever Fenrir tried to allow Severus to use Legillemens on his mind so that they could study it he started to lose control on his sanity and it took Adrian and Thayne a few days to get Fenrir back under control. After three failed attempts with the final one causing the three werewolves to isolate themselves for an entire week they dropped it.
“It doesn't sound embarrassing it sounds….. Nice.” Draco supplied shooting a small smile at Adrian to try and make the young werewolf less squirmy. He had to admit it sounded strange but then again he wasn't a werewolf so who was he to judge? Adrian relaxed a little smiling at the blonde in return while Sirius and Thayne exchanged knowing looks.
Hermione questioned Thayne about the American Wizard school for a solid hour before he finally threw in the towel aiming a glare at his nephew and two friends who were failing to hide their laughter at his expense, this was obvious revenge for embarrassing Adrian in front of Draco earlier. “You weren't kidding paws when you said your friend was insatiable when it comes to information.” Thayne said watching as the empty plates were vanished from the table. He smirked when Ron looked at him in confusion, “paws?” Adrian let out groan putting his head in his hand while Thayne laughed lowly. “When a pup is growing into their body going from child to adult their paws tend to be a little bit bigger until their body grows into them, it's the same for wolves as well. For the first two years Rian here struggled to walk with those paws of his, he would constantly trip over them. One time he and Katra that's Fen's Beta were play fighting and Rian started to run only for him to trip and tumble right into a fallen log. We started calling him ‘all paws' which was shortened into paws.”
Adrian reached out placing his hand on Draco's knee but didn't say any words since honestly there weren't any that he could say to make him feel better.
“What if it’s a combination of both?” Hermione asked looking to both Fenrir and Severus, “the little information I have read about bonds is that they're stronger between those that are fated to be with one another. That type of strength can theoretically over come many spells even memory ones. So in order for those fake memories to stick the caster suppressed the soul bond.”
A knock at the library door, Draco stood gracefully from his perch on the love seat crossing the carpeted floor to answer the door to see his father on the other side holding up three letters, one that was addressed to the Malfoy's and the other two for Ron and Hermione. “Sorry to interrupt but we've all been asked to join the Headmaster in his quarters for afternoon tea, he has some news regarding a friend of yours. Meet us in the family rooms when you're ready.” Lucius explained silver eyes softening slightly when Hermione let out a gasp and shot to her feet. Freedom from the role he was forced to play did wonders for the elder Malfoy who was finally able to marry his partner and repair relationships that he had to destroy to keep people safe. He ended the blood feud between the Malfoy's and Weasley's by helping Arthur get the recognition and position in the Ministry that he deserved. He also helped Hermione start a small firm to help families especially those born with creature inheritance find jobs, housing and medical care.
Adrian raised a white eyebrow in surprise while replying “I was under the impression that Ron would probably live with his family until Hermione forced him out or he inherited The Borrow from his parents.” He joked causing Draco to chuckle as well, “what made them move out?”
“Merlin I know we shouldn't get our hopes up but this is the first lead we've had in a year.” Ron said just as excited as Hermione was helping her from the loveseat and wrapped his arm around her shoulders. Draco nodded though he didn't comment grabbing his dark suit jacket because of course Draco wore a suit even while at home. The three left the library traveling the short distance to the family room where Lucius and Severus were waiting then departed the manor to the Headmasters office via the fireplace.
“I believe on that note we should break for tea and lunch in my office.” Dumbledore said getting to his feet. Everyone else agreed following the headmaster to the door that connected his rooms to his office. Adrian was about to follow when he felt a hand land on his shoulder causing him to look up into grey eyes. Draco had been silent the entire conversation merely absorbing and processing the information given. “Potter….. Greyback can we talk?” he asked through another door that led to a passage from the headmaster's dorms to just outside the gargoyle statue guarding his office entrance. Adrian nodded getting to his feet following the other male, Fenrir watched them leave with a knowing smirk on his face.
“I know.” Sirius let out a soft sigh watching as the fire settled, “I just wanted him to be able to be a kid for a little bit before he's thrown into battle …. He deserves to be happy.” The weight of a hand on his shoulder caused him to look at Fenrir who had an odd look in his gold eyes.
“Don't know how you've kept it together searching for a solution for five years, we've only been at this for a month and my mind feels stretched.” Draco said to Adrian while they lounged outside in the garden at Malfoy Manor. They were the sole occupants of the manor currently the other members had separated for work, lesson planning and rest. Brooms discarded on the Quidditch pitch reflected a game they had tried to play an hour ago however they had made the mistake of allowing the bludgers to flying around, Fenrir had almost gone ballistic when one had just clipped the head of Adrian's broom. After allowing the oldest werewolf to scent his son Thayne pulled his brother back to the suite with Sirius murmuring about calling Adrian's grandmother Selena.
“Your certain the spell had to do something with your mating bond?” Severus asked folding his arms across his chest, “I have caught brief glimpses of Remus' mind myself when he's come to me for Wolfsbane potion each month.” Severus held up a hand when Fenrir growled loudly his blue eyes flaring gold in his fury. “Calm Greyback I have never given your mate that potion rather I modified a sleeping potion to prevent his wolf from doing something drastic. From what I've been able to glean from the brief glimpses I've had into his mind his memories are fake.”
Adrian shot a smug look at his father, “see I told you she was brilliant.” He said proudly causing Hermione to flush a bright pink and rest her head on Ron's shoulder. Fenrir merely rolled his eyes at his son then focused on the witch beside him. “What would be our next move then?”
A/N: Ok there we go 2 out of three catch up chapters done. Something I wanted to add since it didn't fit into the chapter, the prophecy does still apply to Adrian since Fenrir refused to join Voldemort and Remus was in the Order with James,Lily and Sirius.
Recap of what happened during the time of Harry Potter's disappearance and a little surprise at tea time
The exterior of the Hotel looked like a rundown shop stuck between two very large brick walls and about as tall as Gringotts which was a good indication of how big the establishment was on the inside. The lobby was very inviting with soft creams, dark blues and muted golds to give the impression that they're guests are welcome however there wasn't a front desk. Since secrecy was the main draw of the Hotel there were only two wizards working, the owners. Everything else was either run by house elves or enchanted items like the key card. As soon as they stepped inside numbers rose up on the surface of the card forming ‘376’ and an arrow below that started to move in the direction of their room suite. “This way.” Navy murmured trying really hard to stifle his awe at the level of skill the owners had though judging by the laugh he heard, he failed miserably.
Silence fell over the small group though it was quickly broken by Hermione, “why aren’t you two throwing insults at each other?” She asked gesturing between Sirius and Severus pointing out something that should have been obvious but had been lost in the excitement of Adrian’s true identity had.
“ Don’t you Hermione me Harry James Potter! You disappear for 5 years 5 years! Why didn’t you send an owl or a fire message… Something to let us know where you were and why you left?!” the brunette’s hand started to curl into a fist to strike Adrian again but Ron pulled his fiancée away as he caught the murderous look Greyback was giving her. “  Easy ‘Mione let's give him a chance to explain yeah?” he said walking her back to the couch. Draco moved closer to Hermione though he didn't touch her his grey eyes watching Adrian warily. “I won't punch you mate I promise.” Ron teased before he pulled smaller male into his arms for a tight embrace, “it's about damn time brother.”
“He was also a brand new werewolf who had absolutely no training on how to accept and control his wolf. It was safer for him and the rest of you for him to be with a pack until he could control himself.” Fenrir added gruffly.
July easily slipped into August without the group really noticing only taking a break from their research to celebrate Adrian's 22 birthday on the 31st which was spent at Malfoy Manor rather than the hotel suite since there was more room. It was also where the three werewolves and Sirius spent the full moon using the Quidditch field since it had shields allowing Ron, Hermione and Draco to watch safely while allowing the wolves especially Adrian to get use to their scents.
Hermione had to blink back tears as the memory of her best friends disappearance resurfaced like it had happened yesterday not five years ago. During their sixth year ten Death Eaters invaded Hogwarts with the help of a Slytherin student who had repaired a vanishing cabinet that lay within the room of requirement. Their goal had been to secure the castle then drop the wards to allow Voldemort inside to finish off Albus Dumbledore and Harry. However what they found instead of students were the Order, the sixth year DA members, and a handful of Aurors with Harry, Sirius, Albus, Lucius and Severus standing in front.
“We bonded over you funnily enough, your friends were in a right panic when you turned up missing 5 years ago. they barely slept for a week combing through the entire castle and the grounds before moving on to other places such as Hogsmead or Diagon Alley. When you didn’t turn up I offered my family’s Library which has numerous books of maps and how to track Portkey's, magical signatures and the like. During breaks between our searches we just talked first it was about you and then it was about everything else. Ironically what stopped the fights between Ron and I was our love of chess both wizard and muggle, Hermione was the one who introduced the ladder to us and I preferred it over wizard test. It's far more satisfying taking players from your opponent rather than watching your pieces destroy your opponents. It also helped that my father was able to patch things up with Mr. Weasley and finally get him the job that he deserved in the Ministry. It’s not perfect we still fight but I understand why the three of you were so close they became family to me especially now since they live with me my father and Severus at the Manor for about a few months now.”
Ron and Draco both snorted into their pumpkin juice while Hermione tsked and smiled at Adrian “I'm sure that was adorable, I can't wait to see your wolf form in a few days. Ron and I have our animagus licenses so we can join you.” She said the redhead nodding while Draco looked a little flustered. “That's great Hermione but dad thinks it would be best if at least for one or two moons that it just be us.” Adrian gestured between him, Fenrir, Thayne and Sirius, “you can watch if you want but just make sure you're behind a shield just in case. Once my wolf knows you guys are pack then you can join.” He explained smiling apologetically at Hermione who looked put out but understood all the same.
Hermione got to her feet at once heading back over to the fire pit “I'll look at this then see what I can find in the soul bond books we've read.” She said over her shoulder then disappeared to Malfoy Manor. Ron and Draco said nothing though they spent the rest of the day trying to cheer Adrian up who had gone absolutely silent with the news. It took another two weeks , on September 23 for Hermione to come back with not only the answer to the severed bond but also with a plan.
But Ron didn't let him go any further and said. "You're right Harry," Ron started sounding a bit more optimistic, "I should just get over her. I should… distract myself. It's probably not that bad, how much I'm in love with her I mean. I should forget about her soon enough." Ron said standing back up while smiling. "Thank you, Harry, wouldn't have come up with it without you." He said and walked out of the room with a happy face.
expression, Harry was sure, would be the death of him. He already was a yes-man by nature but against that expression, Harry didn't know if he ever would able to say no. Which was dangerous.
Harry looked at the ceiling, letting out a curse, "I want to make sure we are on the same page, so I'm asking you if you want to be on the receiving end, or the-" he cleared his throat, "giving end?"
Why the hell was he so bloody nervous?! There was absolutely no reason why he should feel like this. Sure, it had been a long time since they were alone in the same room together, but that was nothing to get concerned about…right?
It was all because of that stupid Potter…again, the constant thoughts about the raven-haired bloodsucker were foremost
"Harry, Harry, Harry. There was work involved. I had to track these people down and ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. No, it's not all book signings and publicity photos. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long, hard slog." Lockhart said with an innocent tone.
"Hmm," Dumbledore said as he went back to his desk, stroking his beard as he looked into space. "Perhaps, you just prefer it directly. That could be an option." Dumbledore said thoughtfully, making Harry's heart sink.
Only for all of that to change in one night felt a little like cheating –It was also very good on his self-esteem, just great!- and now that he got it, the body he'd always wanted…it just…it didn't feel like
He turned his gaze to meet Draco. Draco smiled at him and gave him a greeting nod. His stomach felt strange by the gesture, even though it had been filled a few minutes ago. Still, Harry felt his legs go weak as he saw that adorable smile on the Slytherin's face.
"Well, if I were them I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else because if it's just you alone you're not as much of a threat. And you can easily be manipulated into doing something you don't want." Luna said. Harry stared at her while she smiled.
Dumbledore looked around him, seeing that there was nobody there. "Come, Harry, we'll talk about this in my office.
"No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates." McGonagall said.
Harry felt a bit nervous. To Harry, it felt like the right thing to do, but maybe the other elves where jealous of him, or angry that he'd let Dobby betray their masters.
, you're a Malfoy, it'd be stupid from him to not be friends with someone of that kind of ranking," Lucius said.
I thought it would be fun to have the Weasleys still be wizard and witches, and Hermione a werewolf because of her bushy hair and other reasons...
Thank bloody hell for that! He wasn't sure if he could handle those screeching groupies in his own house too. Squabbling together like a pack of headless chickens.
"Okay guys, firstly we're going to do some drills. I'll be watching your performance and see if you made the team. Now, like always, just because you made the team last year doesn't guaranty you a spot this year. Is that clear?" Harry said, sounding more confident than he had been last year. He remembered how immensely nervous he had been back then, he had been worried about the responsibilities he had, to everyone. He didn't want to put anyone down. Now it didn't feel so scary at all. But then again, now he had some practice.
"Do it again," Ron looked at her incredulously. Something she didn't have the time nor the patience for, the wondrous itch already starting to creep back up again and now that she had a taste of what the relief of it felt like, she wanted more. "It's good, really good. Please?"
The soft plea and spoken desire attached to it made it practically impossible for him not to fulfil her request. He backed up, sweat covering his forehead as he took a deep breath. "You asked for it."
Harry looked at Hermione with an uncertain look, almost clawing his eyes out in frustration. This was it. This was the moment he'd been waiting for, the choice he knew he had to make. He felt his hands clamming up, sweat dripping from his forehead to his shaven chin. His heart hammering loudly against his ribcage. He looked between them as he bit his lip.
"You two better change in your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon." She said while walking to the door. "And you've got dirt on your nose by the way, did you know? Just there." Hermoine said while pointing at her nose.
Not because he wasn't a good friend. Not because he couldn't keep a secret. Not because she didn't trust him. Of course not.
When finally Harry managed to open up his trousers, lowering his underwear to take a better look, he paused.
A thought that, thinking about it, might have been the sentence he had most often used in the last 18 years of his existence and one that tonight would have probably exceeded its own record. Following Harry into the forbidden forest with thousands of gigantic spiders chasing them?
Shutting the door behind himself Draco let out a long sigh. Grumbling as he kicked off his shoes, he stepped into the room, walking towards his drawer.
"I'm fine, I'm fine," he said as he dusted of his clothes, more in an attempt to calm his nervous than anything else. He looked at his friends, who still watched him skeptically. "Seriously, I'm fine. It's just…been a long time since I've seen you guys. Got my head a little wired up, I guess." He tried to joke.
"We just wanted to say hi, so… hi!" A Hufflepuff girl said blushing, but all the while smiling at him.
After dinner, the same day Dumbledore made his announcement, both he and Harry went to McGonagall's office, trying to persuade the shapeshifter to let them see Hermione. The professor didn't budge though and told them to let it rest and reassured them that she would be back in no time.
Besides, when he tried it with Ron it tasted just as horrible as it did out of the bag. So what was the point? Only because Dumbledore said he probably liked it more that way he shouldn't try it on every person he met and see if they somehow tasted better. He shouldn't have tried it with Ron in the first place but at least he knew now.
noises of me thoroughly enjoying myself?" He let out a dry laugh, "Yes, you were...you were more then good, extraordinary might be a better word for it. My God, Draco."
He did catch on to it, however, much to her annoyance. But with him, hope rose together with curiosity. "Would you want it to be?"
Hermione joylessly barked. She turned to the left and stopped, howling when she won their little bet.
Harry couldn't help the foolish grin that spread across his face. The first thing that came to mind was 'bloody fantastic', but he knew Ron would only stare at him like he'd grown two-heads if he said that.
When he felt calm enough, he started slowly taking his clothes off, whimpering as he felt it moving against his body. When it was finally done he found himself able to breathe normally again and laid down on the bed as he stared up at the ceiling.
Voldemort stuck the wand onto Wormtail's arm. Harry heard thunder and looked up to see the sky changing into a skull with snakes coming out of it. The snakes landing on the graveyard with masks and pointy heads.
Draco's hands started grasping for Harry's neck, wanting to keep him there as he was overwhelmed by his own want and arousal. Feeling Harry's tongue tracing his bottom lip he opened his mouth in a clear invitation, moaning again as he felt it slip inside.
“ Because we have been friends since our 3rd year at Hogwarts.” Severus replied causing four pairs of shock eyes to glance at the potions professor. “James Potter left me alone after I bluntly told him I had no interest in Lily other than friendship as I was gay and interested in someone else, the rivalry mainly involve Black and I. As all of you are aware to came to a head when Black played that prank on me during a full moon with Remus occupying the Shrieking Shack.”
“I was but now I'm thinking how gob smacked he would be when he finds out that we've actually become friends in his absence.” She said earning a chuckle from both men. Out of this entire ordeal Draco's friendship had been very surprising that had started at the beginning of the summer after their fifth year. Harry had moved into Grimmauld Place after his godfather had been cleared of all of those charges, Pettigrew had been one of the Death Eaters that had been amongst those that had been in the Department of Mysteries. Ron and Hermione decided to spend the entire summer with their best friend and the three of them had been in the living room cleaning it up when the fireplace flared and Draco stepped through followed by Sirius and Lucius. The two men had been at the Ministry for the senior Malfoy and Severus Snape's trials for their Death Eater activity, Sirius as well as Dumbledore were key witnesses to their roles as spies since their days as students at Hogwarts.
Harry had found out about the vanishing cabinet thanks to Dobby and Draco, the house elf had been left in charge of watching the room of requirement for anyone who wasn't a member of the DA to use it. Draco then used Theo who was still loyal to the blonde to get the truth out of the Slytherin girl, he couldn't do it himself as he had been moved to private rooms due to Lucius’ fears that his housemates would attack him to earn favor with the Dark Lord. Dumbledore  and Severus then devised a plan to lock down the common rooms to keep the students safe then lessen the wards to allow the Light allies to apparate onto the school grounds a few hours before the attack was to commence.
“Oh please Weasel I don't need to cheat to beat you. I told you to step up your chess game while playing against me seeing as I'm not Potter.”
“Alright but I don't see how a patronus could make you believe that Sirius has a thing for your uncle. It looked the same to me.” Ron replied. Hermione shook her head fondly at her fiancé.
The fight hadn't lasted very long as the advantage the Death Eaters thought they had had disappeared.   Most of the small group had been stunned the moment they had stepped into the great hall however Bellatrix was far too quick to be brought down by stupefy, she went after Sirius to try and kill him a second time. That duel was nasty and ended with a freezing jinx followed by bombarda blowing the bitch's body into little bits. After the Death Eaters were taken away by the Auror’s Harry had sent a patronus out to where Voldemort was lurking, goading old snake face to stop being a coward and finish the battle once and for all.
“I know Adrian I'm sorry…. I viewed Severus' memory and he's correct when he said the bond is severed but only partially, there are a few strands still intact and I believe those strands are the instinct bond. I think that's why your dad went feral Adrian, the books that I read stated that if the martial bond is cut but the instinct bond remains it can simulate the submissive partner is dead but since the bond isn't completely severed the dominate can't join them so that baser instinct loses control and takes over. It is possible for a dominate to reclaim its sanity which Fenrir did however that is only temporary, if the bond is not restored then Fenrir could revert back to being feral…. And stay that way.” Adrian's whimper turned into a whine, Sirius pulled the smaller boy into his lap holding him tightly and rocking him as he cried.
The twinkle his Albus' eyes sparkled brightly as he opened one of his desk doors pulling out three letters. With a groan he got to his feet going over to his faithful familiar. “Please see that these arrive to our friends Fawkes.” He said running two fingers along the bright red and gold feathers of the phoenix. With another trill Fawkes disappeared in a burst of flame while Albus returned to his desk to resume his work, a smile on his face.
Silence was the initial answer he got as Adrian's expression grew thoughtful watching as the glass floated back onto the table, “a little scary but mainly nerve wracking. I made the mistake of asking Katra about her first shift and she went into gory detail of every crack and shift of her bone.” He shuddered at the memory, “I love Kat I do but she can be extremely blunt. Anyway I honestly don't remember anything since according to Sirius my eyes rolled back up into my head and I passed out, none of us had anticipated that I would come into a magic inheritance at the same time. I was out cold for 3 days dad was so on edge that he almost lost it a few times and had to remain in wolf form the entire time I was unconscious. When I woke up everything was….. Sharper? I guess that’s the right word for it  and I realized that I wasn't alone in my head.” Draco looked at him with a little alarm causing Adrian to laugh.
That duel was far tougher for the Savior and before he turned the tide in his favor it looked like Voldemort would win. Despite the fact that Harry spent 6 months training with Albus, Lucius, Severus, and Sirius to sharpen up his duelling skills and learn more spells he was still only 16 years old. Though he had a great well of magic he lacked the years of experience Voldemort had on him, as well as an ego he started to become rather bold bragging to Harry that even if he managed to kill him once more he would still come back as he was Immortal. Harry’s response was to merely smile twirling his wand between his fingers while smirking before delivering a final bombshell.
Adrian didn’t comment he just studied the blond before nodding in agreement. The previous awkwardness that had been hovering between them since leaving the headmaster’s office finally dissipated allowing the blond to finally relax and settle beside Adrian on the rock. They  remained silent watching the giant squid play in the middle of the Black Lake until Ron and Hermione join them 15 minutes later with a small picnic for the for them. Adrian and Draco got off of the rock moving the blanket on to the ground and smoothing out so the four of them could sit down on the grass and eat as Ron passed out sandwiches to everyone Adrian grabbed Hermione’s hand so he could study the  delicate ring on her finger. Made of white gold the entire ring looked like it was made out of a vine with a small diamond perched on top with a few white gold leaves to make the jewel look like a flower, the ring suited Hermione since it clearly mimicked the vine work on her wand.
The second memory was during 6th year leading up to the final battle. Adrian had returned from retrieving and destroying the horcrux residing in Slytherin's locket, the images the smoke within the locket still running through his mind like a sick twisted movie. Ron and Neville had been in the dorms when Adrian had gotten back and without a word they spelled their beds together to make a giant one then spent the night talking, cracking bad jokes and not allowing Adrian to think about the upcoming battle. “See?” Fenrir said chuffing his chin to bring him back to the present, “by that look in your eyes you did it a few times before your inheritance.” He poked him on the nose earning a short growl and a snap of Adrian's teeth trying to bite his finger.  “Drink your tea cub I'll call for breakfast.” Fenrir stood to his feet leaving Adrian alone at the fire pit.
The site of both Sirius Black and Fenrir Greyback calmly sitting and having tea with the Headmaster greeted the new arrivals, the younger three automatically drawing their wands and aiming them at the notorious werewolf. Sirius let out a bark of laughter aiming a smile at the scowling male before he stood to his feet closing the distance between himself and the younger adults, pulling all three of them into a hug. “Easy now you three know Dumbledore wouldn't have let him into Hogwarts let alone his own rooms if he was dangerous.” He said grinning at Ron's snort and mutter of ‘poor judge of character'. “Let's all sit down to tea and listen to Greyback and his son yeah?” There was a sharp intake of breath from behind the young trio, Lucius and Severus looked pale while shooting Sirius a look to which the older man nodded to confirm what the two former spies were thinking.
The young werewolf continued to chuckle very familiar with his best friends arguing, it happened very frequently during their time at Hogwarts. Usually Adrian had been able to act as a medium settling the fight before it reached its boiling point but other times he had to walk away and let them sort it out themselves. Ron and Hermione were opposites in every sense of the word and most of the time they balanced each other out however those dissimilarities sometimes rubbed the wrong way and exploded like dynamite. “I'm sure it happened a lot when you were looking for me.” Adrian said standing up with his cup in his hand to make himself another cup of tea as well as make Draco one. “Where did you normally go when the fighting got too much?”
Hermione hummed against Ron’s shoulder as she thought before straightening herself, “research on soul bonds and perhaps even see the suppressed bond if we can.”
Calmly the Boy Who Lived told his mortal enemy that with the help of his most ‘loyal' servants they had found the items that he stored pieces of his soul in, his horcruxes and destroyed each and every last one leaving him mortal once again. This bombshell turned the tide in Harry's favor as this caused Voldemort's spell casting to become more desperate and erratic, and after barely dodging a killing curse Harry sent a powerful Sectemsempra slicing old Snake face's head clean off. This apparently was so funny to Harry that he collapsed into a fit of giggles before passing out from mental and physical exhaustion.
On another note I also edited my other chapters nothing too big just fixing grammar errors and sealing up from plot holes.
“But why was Ha-Adrian taken from Hogwarts? Couldn't you have revealed the truth to all of us once he was awake?” Ron asked anger seeping into his tone slightly.
Adrian summoned a chair so he could sit down his focus on his two best friends and former enemy, “I know this is a lot to take in trust me. I tried running away from my father at least twice and lost count how many times I hexed him and Sirius before the truth finally sank in, blood never lies. “He explained looking at Dumbledore briefly then looked back at his friends, “ let’s start with the basics yeah? For 16 years I was the only son of James and Lily Potter it was something I was told since the moment I was old enough to comprehend that. It wasn’t until after I was stolen away by my very own Godfather in the middle of the night and spelled to remain in a chair a week later that the truth of my parents was revealed; my true parents are Fenrir Greyback and Remus Lupin – Greyback.”
“ To this day I regret telling James to trust Peter, I paid for my mistake for 12 years in the cell beside yours cranky wolf.” He griped his hand flexing instinctively like he wanted to hex Fenrir.
Adrian let out another wheeze squeezing his arms around the redhead's back fighting back tears once more. The two stayed in that embrace for a few minutes more before finally pulling away their eyes a little red tinged from repressed tears. “ Just to let you know Hermione my kidnapping was not my fault if you want to punch someone look to my no-good Godfather who decided to take me while I was unconscious. He’s the one to blame for my initial disappearance however the reason we had to stay away for so long will be explained in due time. Also I know it's a lot to ask of you all but I don't go by Harry anymore, my birth name is Adrian Sebastian Greyback.” He explained snapping his fingers to remove the glamor, the transformation much quicker than before as the young wizard had been going for dramatic effect raven black hair lightened up to snowy white. The light grey Henley and dark wash jeans became well fitted once more while eyes flashed gold briefly then settled to the striking icy blue. Finally he grew the two inches he gained from his inheritance then shook his body out, wearing that glamor felt like having oil on his skin.
Fenrir’s growl died at the Potion Master's words and he took a few breaths to calm himself before speaking, “I wouldn't have gone feral that night had it just been a memory charm. I would still be able to feel my mate, would have been able to help him remember me if it was just a memory charm.”
“He would certainly think you two have lost your minds.” Draco said with a smirk before his head turned at the soft knock on the library door.
“I understand Mr. Greyback and I'm sure we can come up with someway to see the bond on Remus' side should our efforts bring up nothing. And please call me Hermione.”
“Let me guess Fen saw it?” He asked weakly. Adrian nodded with a ‘yup' popping the ‘p'. “Fantastic though not like it's any of his concern, I may act like a teenager but I am a grown ass adult….. Though it's not like….” He trailed off and winced then shook his head throwing his nephew a strained smile, “sorry paws I shouldn't unload on you like that.”
Wow two days in a row yay! Also this is the longest chapter I've written.... and yes my brain is dead. So chapters 5-7 re going to cover time between July 2012 to January 2013 so to make things easier I broke the chapter down into chunks. So I hope you enjoy this one
“To continue where we left off as far as becoming friends I meant what I said 6 years ago Adrian I had always wanted us to be friends and I figured since your best friends are now my friends it might be a little bit easier.”
The silence between the two young adults was filled with awkward tension as they walked down the passage that ended with a portrait of a forest landscape that was beside the Griffin statue guarding the headmasters office. Draco held open the portrait allowing the smaller man to pass through then let go watching as the portrait shut with a soft ‘thud'. While the school was empty except for the few professors that stayed year round the blonde still wished for a more private place to speak so without a word he led the way towards outside. The Black Lake was always a favorite spot whenever he wanted to study or just think when he had been a student and judging by the flash of recognition to the path they were taking it was one for Po-Greyback as well. As they walked through the deserted halls of the castle all of the scenarios that had played through Draco's mind for the past five years flooded back to a point that he thought he would drown in them. Some of the earlier scenarios consisted of Draco yelling at Potter calling him a coward for abandoning everyone to deal with the mess and fallout of Voldemort’s demise. Overtime however the scenarios morphed into questions, variations of why he left and why he stayed away for so long and most importantly how he could put his best friends through so much pain and worry. However he didn’t voice any of these questions as they no longer applied to the situation, Adrian’s story explained why he had to stay away. Not only was it for his safety but for their safety as well. So he remained silent sneaking short little glances at the smaller male and catching those icy blue eyes doing the same thing.
Adrian let out an undignified yelp limps flailing as the fire pit spat him out since there wasn't a brick wall to steady himself like he would in a traditional fireplace. Stumbling he tried to right himself but he had never gotten the hang of floo travel and since he had two left feet gravity won and he fell into another very warm solid body. The familiar scent of cloves, smoke and pine filled his nose and he let out a soft growl while nuzzling into the solid chest then pulled away to look up into warm midnight blue eyes. “Alright there paws?” the man rumbled his voice smooth with a drawl of at least three different accents blurred together. Adrian let out another growl this time in displeasure at the unwanted nickname. “I hate that name,” he groused before he shook it off allowing the excitement to overtake his annoyance. “I thought you weren't coming for at least another week Uncle Thayne.”
Adrian let out a sigh letting go of the glass in his hand which hovered in the air while he mused up his hair pulling a few of the white strands. A blonde brow was raised at the casual display of wandless magic though to be honest he was use to it after only a month. Draco always knew that the boy who lived was powerful but when the werewolf just casually threw out that he had to learn wandless magic after he accidentally
“Ron and Hermione started to fight so he escaped through the floo.” Adrian piped up and Sirius let out a bark of laughter while shaking his head. Thayne rejoined the small group wearing only sleep pants leaving his torso completely bare, Adrian groaned while Sirius rolled his eyes with a muttered ‘werewolves are completely shameless'. “You know Shaggy if you had shared your room with me last night instead of being mean you could have joined in the puppy pile with me and paws this morning.” Thayne remarked grinning at Adrian's humiliated cry of ‘Thayne!!’ while Draco asked ‘puppy pile?’ “It's also called a cuddle pile if that helps. Werewolves sleep close together in a heap, heads resting on legs, people acting like big spoons and little spoons etc. It's not sexual in anyway just very comforting and warm, it's very instinctual especially with pups both young or newly turned. It helps with their adjusting instincts and the pull is greater as the Moon gets closer to being full. It's also a great way for anyone to feel safe when they need comfort.” He explained then looked at his mortified nephew “it's nothing to be embarrassed about.”
“I swear to Merlin ferret if you're cheating I will use some of the products I got from my brothers to get my revenge.”
Draco had already seen Adrian's wolf before during the full moon 3 weeks prior but there was just something about seeing him up close that left him breathless. The size of Adrian was completely different to his father and uncle, their alternate forms were double the size of a large wolf while Adrian could have easily been mistaken for the true wild animal except he was sleeker his body meant for running. The blonde slid from his chair to sit on the ground placing his wand on his thigh and held his hands out keeping his stance relaxed and very still so he didn't spook or agitate Adrian. He kept very still watching as Adrian slinked closer his nose constantly moving as he scented the air catching the fragrance of him. “You are so beautiful.” Draco murmured reaching out a hand keeping it open to let Adrian walk into it if he wanted which the wolf did running its cold wet nose along the skin then nuzzled it demanding pets. Draco scratched behind Adrian's ears then ran his hand down the length of his sleek body, they stayed in this position for a few minutes before Adrian loped back around the hedge to shift and returned fully dressed and smiling.
Grey eyes narrowed slightly at the dodged question but Draco let it slide, he had just escaped witnessing a fight so he didn't want to drag the other man in front of him into a verbal sparring match. He had to think however about the question that Adrian had posed while Draco had been distracted by bare skin and sleep pants that hung far too low on curved hips to be considered legal. “Where do I go when Ron and Hermione are arguing?” Draco repeated and when Adrian nodded he continued, “usually back to my room or outside to the garden. There's an expanse of land that my father turned into a Quidditch pitch for me to use and with shield and heating charms it can be used all year. Flying always centered me and clear my head.”
There we go the ground work has been laid for Adrian and Draco's relationship. I hope you enjoyed this little filler chapter. As always kudos and comments are appreciated, see you guys in the next update.
Adrian let out a laugh almost forgetting about the incident with Sirius's patronus. Looking in the direction of his godfather’s room he then shot a smug look at his uncle, “when were you going to tell us that you and Siri had feelings for each other?” He asked his grin turning into a full blown smile when Thayne stumbled in shock.
Sirius let out a guilty chuckle at that running a hand through his hair, “James was absolutely furious when he found out what I did calling me a jealous git because I had seen him and Severus studying together with Lily. He spent an entire week pranking me and Remus threatened to release Fenrir who had been livid that their pack night had been interrupted if I didn’t apologize. The pranks I can handle but Greyback scared the shit out of me because he was… Well still is a surly bastard. Not to mention to a 13 year old having a fully grown massively tall and built werewolf who was five years older was terrifying.”
“I'm your only uncle brat, go grab my grumpy brother from where ever he's hiding so we can eat, I'm bloody starving.” Thayne chuckled gently shoving his nephew towards his father's rooms before he rubbed the bridge of his nose and went to fetch Sirius.
Adrian then turned in seat slightly to look at his father, prior to coming to this meeting it was discussed that all three of them would need to explain the entire situation to make things less confusing. Fenrir met his son’s gaze briefly then cleared his throat while crossing his arms over his massive chest. “I know my appearance looks haggard but there is only a five year age gap between my mate and I, so when Remus was bitten I was only 9 years old.” He started to explain holding up and went to look like Hermione wanted to interrupt, “ Remus was bitten by another werewolf a rogue who went insane, his parents knew my families pack took in abandoned children so they contacted my father and he was brought to our pack and raised to accept his wolf.” Fenrir let out of soft growl when it looked like Ron was going to interrupt this time, “ I will explain that part be patient.” He barked barring his fangs at the red head. Adrian cleared his throat and the older werewolf settled, continuing his story.
The silence was absolutely deafening Adrian would have laughed at the absolute gobsmacked expressions on his friends and well he wasn’t sure where he and Draco stood so he was an enigma for now. He was about to continue his story when Hermione spoke up shooting a look at Fenrir, “ that…. I’m really happy you have a family ha – Adrian but Remus always said that Greyback attacked and bit him when he was a little-" her voice was cut off by a menacing growl from The surly werewolf. Sirius lifted a hand and cuffed the back of his head silencing the growl abruptly, gold eyes narrowed with unspoken revenge towards the other man to which Sirius just smiled not bothered in the slightest.
“ I knew we were mates about a few months later however since he was only 4 and adjusting to being a werewolf I waited until he was 15 to start courting. My father cautioned being careful since Voldemort was trying to recruit werewolves to his war and I became a target due to leaving my familial pack to start my own. I want better treatment for my kind however I knew that I wouldn’t get that by following someone who wasn’t even human and sane any longer, besides war wasn’t going to stop me from having a family and carrying on my family’s Legacy. And I knew Remus had a pack of friends that would  protect him.” He looked over at Lucius and Severus briefly then pressed on before he was interrupted once again. “ Remus and I mated after he graduated Hogwarts then shortly after he fell pregnant with Adrian. I was still being pursued by Death Eaters and with the discovery of that prophecy… Lily had already been pretending to be pregnant to protect her friend against those that thought werewolves producing naturally was an abomination.
Severus and Lucius had already left in the morning to continue their lesson prep as school was resuming in a few weeks. Ron and Hermione left only a few minutes prior stating that they needed to check into the office to make sure the two staff members they had hadn't according to Hermione ‘completely bollocked my filing system'. Adrian let out a absent hum grabbing a glass of lemonade and taking a sip of the sweet tart liquid before replying, “don't breathe a word of this to Hermione but there wasn't any research done while I was with my dad's pack.” Draco snorted causing a grin to split Adrian's face. “I mean we tried honestly maybe within the last year before coming back here but we were busy with other things. Besides my dad, grandparents, Sirius and Thayne had gone through all of the reading material they could find so it wasn't much of a search when I joined.”
“come on pup let's go get settled it's been a long trip.” A squeeze to those slight shoulders then the small group set down the street towards the newly built hotel that was tucked in beside Gringotts bank. “You know I still don't understand why we can't just stay at the Leaky Cauldron.” This comment came from Slate Grey which broke the comfortable silence between the three. The aggravated sigh that left Navy was a clear indignation that this argument had happened far too many times. “Because while I don't look the same you two do and as much as I love Tom I know for a fact that man cannot keep a secret. We're here for a very specific reason and it would be very bad for our cause if certain individuals discovered we’ve returned.” The disdain dripping from the man's voice caused Slate Grey to raise his scarred hands in surrender while Brown chuckled lowly. “Besides this place is extremely exclusive there are no advertisements or even a sign over the door.” Navy continued tilting his head towards the building which on the outside looked like an abandoned store front. This brought out a bark like laughter from the male on his right with a ‘alright pup you win' in total defeat.
The foursome had just finished lunch when a patronus in the shape of a wolf appeared before them. Opening its mouth it replayed a message from Sirius, ‘sorry to interrupt your catch up but there is something else we have to talk about meet us back in Albus' quarters.’ The wolf then turned and disappeared.
Fenrir let out a small sigh setting his mug down on the small table beside his chair before he got to his feet. Moving over to his son he got down on one knee so he was eye level with Adrian. “We aren't people cub we're wolves, acting on instinct will always be ingrained in us. So wanting to seek comfort from family, from pack when it's so close to the full moon is perfectly normal.” He ran a hand through his son's wild mop of hair, his boy had seen so much during the first 16 years of his life, it took moments like this to remind himself that Adrian was still so very young. “Also you can't tell me that you never experienced a puppy pile at least once before your seventeenth birthday, those baser instincts do not just vanish cub.”
Sirius took out the luggage he had shrunken out of his pocket placing it on the bed for resizing and putting it away from later then crossed the sitting area to Adrian's room. “Alright pup let's go see….” His voice trailed off when his eyes landed on his godson who was now fast asleep on top of the covers. Rolling his eyes fondly he went over to the smaller male very gently taking off his clothes then moved him under the covers tucking him in then placed a gentle kiss to his forehead. Straightening he left the room closing the door behind him.
Grey eyes slid close briefly then opened, Draco absently tucked a stray piece of hair behind his ear before he replied “I couldn't find my animal.” The words were said so quietly that if Adrian hadn't of been a werewolf he would have missed it.  “We did it to try and lighten the mood, we had hit dead ends searching for you and Hermione was tired of listening to Ron and I bicker out of frustration so she plunked the book she was reading and pointed out the chapter. It's not hard to achieve it just takes concentration and time. It started with meditating to find the animal that your magic core resonates with, both Ron and Hermione found theirs quickly….. Every time I tried.” He made a frustrated noise “it was like trying to capture water in your hand the image would start to form then it would warp and vanish. Apparently it's rare for this to happen, the book said it could be that my core has multiple potential links but it's undecided….. Whatever that means.”
A/N: Hey guys! Thank you so much for all of the kudos I'm so glad people liked the prologue. So quick message before going forward with the story, this chapter isn't a rewrite from the original draft. One of the things that bothered me when I read through the story was that I did not take the time to lay out the  background of the disappearance, five year gap etc. Also I moved the original book timeline by 10 years so the war ended in 2007. So this is the start of it. So I hope you enjoy it.
For the third time in a short amount of time a blush graced his cheeks and actually travelled down his neck and spread a little across his chest. “Bloody hell.” He murmured putting the tea cups back down on the table and hurried back to his room so he could throw on a shirt. He was so use to sleeping with either very little or no clothing while he lived with his families pack that he forgot that humans didn't think of clothing as
“Come on Dray since you're here you might as well join us for breakfast.”  Adrian said the nickname slipping out without him noticing though the way Draco froze from getting to his feet the blonde did. Fenrir’s smile was a little smug but Adrian ignored the look and just concentrated on filling his plate. A comfortable silence fell over the table the sounds of scraping plates and eating the only noises being made. Breakfast was  about done when the fire pit flared to life before Ron and Hermione emerged from the flame their arms full of thick tomes from the Malfoy Library. “You know Malfoy wouldn't have fled if you hadn't been so anal about research, this is Hogwarts Mione we aren't on a time crunch for an exam.”
“I'll show you the bond through my end Miss. Granger but bare in mind since the spell wasn't cast on me it might not help… It did us no good during our own research.” Fenrir said gruffly blue eyes once again melting into molten gold in frustration.
Pulling his legs to his chest Adrian rested his chin on his knees his mind wandering while he sipped his slightly cooled off tea. He perked up when the fire pit flared to life and he raised an eyebrow when Draco stepped out dusting off some of the soot on his suit. “Morning.” He said trying and failing to keep the surprise from his voice.
“ Sorry Hermione dad gets really defensive about Papa, I will explain everything just give me time okay? It’s a lot to get through” Adrian said sparing his dad a glance the refocused on his friends. “ Where was I? Oh yeah well you can imagine I took the news about my true parentage well, I spent a few minutes just laughing at the absurdity then became angry when no one else joined me . The family tree spell was the only way I believe the truth and after staring at the peace parchment I allowed my father just start explaining how I ended up a Potter for 16 years.”
Draco was silent though as he didn't hear the question due to the fact that he was distracted by what Adrian was wearing…. Or rather what he wasn't wearing which was a top. Golden tanned skin was stretched over very defined muscles that bunched and stretched as the werewolf moved gracefully while preparing their tea. He wasn't bulky like his father but sleek like a panther or a cheetah. Draco was snapped out of his shocked trance when the object of his ogling turned around holding the tea cups in his hand and he blinked bringing his grey eyes up from Adrian's exposed chest to lock with bewildered azure. “I'm sorry what?”
“ that’s why I disappeared shortly after my name was cleared I made the promise to Fenrir that I would help find a way to reserve the curse placed on Remus. Took me half a year just to find the bugger since he was staying with his family pack and Selena had moved locations during our prison time.” Sirius looked at his godson then over at Lucius and Severus, “ I am sorry that I couldn’t stay to help destroy those horcruxes but I knew it was important to prepare for the truth problem that we had to tell Adrian once he was smuggled out of the UK.” He explained to the room.
During their searches the three of them talked about everything, rehashing old wounds and apologizing slowly healing scars until a friendship started to form, it wasn't perfect Ron and Draco still fought from time to time but it was more light hearted than mean spirited. Also Draco had opened the Manor up for them to live in after he had overheard Ron telling his girlfriend that they needed to move out of the Borrow.
The day before classes were to resume at Hogwarts Severus came through with his promise. After talking with Albus Lucius had come up with the idea of approaching Remus with the offer of asking him to come into help Lucius teach his seventh year Defense class on how to fight against magic resistance creatures. The discussion had been brief and when Remus agreed they celebrated with tea and firewhiskey which Severus had laced with a mild sleeping potion. Once the werewolf fell asleep the potions master swept in quickly casting Legillemens he had to work fast before Remus' metabolism burned off the potion. Pushing through the memories he delved deeper until he reached the deepest parts of his subconscious where the soul bond lay. What he saw deeply disturbed the former spy and he withdrew fast though not enough that it would hurt Remus.
“no harm in having a little fun Fenrir it was a long muggle flight from Canada back to London.” Sirius groused pulling a face at the memory of the 7 hour flight, though first class had been nice there had been an ‘incident’ when they landed since apparently the surely werewolf hated flying and his already thin patience had snapped. Thank Merlin Adrian was an expert at calming his father down or else they would have gotten arrested. Fenrir let out a growl sending a heated glare towards Black since it had been his brilliant idea to take muggle travel instead of an illegal portkey. “It's close to the full moon Shaggy so any rough housing is a little dangerous to do in doors.” He smirked at Sirius's mutter of ‘I got a haircut stop calling me that!’
Adrian suddenly let out a snicker causing the other three to look at him. “Sorry I just realized dad owes me five galleons.” He explained which of course wasn't really much of an explanation so he elaborated as they packed up. “When we stayed in British Columbia with dad's pack Sirius got really close with my uncle Thayne dad's former Beta and younger brother. I was convinced that they were more than friends and dad wasn't buying it so we made a bet.”
"Riddikulus!" Weasley said and the spider was almost falling over when it found itself with its eight legs trapped in roller skates.
would be trespassing the friendship code!" Hermione pointed a finger at him in disbelief, "Besides he doesn't blabber about my crushes either!"
"Please, you've survived a lot more than that," Draco said teasingly. Making Harry's heartbeat go faster.
"Good, I wouldn't forgive you if you would," Draco said as he smiled up at Harry, warmth spreading through his body as he saw the raven-haired boy smile back at him. Giving him another more earnest kiss.
Harry lapped at his skin, his tongue darting around the little holes with a tenderness you wouldn't expect from a ferocious preditor. Draco knew he wasn't the only one stirred by the action, although it had taken him a pretty long time to notice. The most obvious hint was definitely the growing member stretching his insides, or the unmistaken shift in pheromones, or the strained hold on the furniture that couldn't be blamed on self-control alone. It was what the experience made even better. The thought that Harry was equally as wrecked as Draco by the end of it.
"Out of fear, not loyalty. Still, you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail." Voldemort said and with a swing of his wand gave Wormtail his hand back. Wormtail looked at it in awe.
They just finished the Halloween dinner, but while Ron had been devouring his pumpkin pie Harry hadn't even been able to look at his bowl of 'soup'. He really couldn't stand the taste anymore.
"Drink?" Harry heard somebody ask. When he turned around he was surprised to see Neville standing there in some kind of uniform holding a tray with drinks on it.
"Professor, we've got some information for you- Harry said dashing inside Lockhart's office but stopped seeing two large trunks standing open and a very empty office. Harry and Ron stopped dead.
Draco and his mother were back in Malfoy Manor. His mother was still quiet and dried tears stained her face. It wasn't easy seeing your dad being convicted like that. Draco knew his father wasn't perfect, but he'd never expected this. When he saw his father chained up he had so many questions; How could he have done this? Was mom in on it too? Did he really do all those crimes?
"…I know I said 'just once' not a second ago…" Draco mussed, swallowing. God, this was embarrassing. He should probably shut his mouth now.
God, fuck! What was happening? Was this some kind of nightmare? A joke? She couldn't believe this. This was not happening. It was all her imagination.
After Professor Dumbledore's speech about 'no students under the age of seventeen were allowed to enter the trimonster tournament' everyone started to eat. But Harry wasn't really that hungry, he was thinking to much about Voldemort and stuff. He needed to talk to Dumbledore about this so they could figure out what to do next.
"You mustn't blame yourself for how this one turned out. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?" Harry heard Marge say. When he heard Marge talking about his father Harry's smirk disappeared, knowing where this was heading.
She felt hot, a familiar knot forming below her belt and the idea of simply pushing the redhead down onto the bed, shredding his clothes, bringing him to the heavens and back became more and more tempting. She recounted the fantasies she had played to herself, desperate attempts at finding release that somehow had managed to become a recurring theme, with most of them involving him a) strapped to the bed, pleading to her for release in that raspy, wanting voice as she rode him, b) eating her out and showing her all that she has been missing out on and c) taking complete control of the situation by putting her into her place and fucking her on every surface of the room.
"Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two. I just wanted to talk about your sudden changes in grades than the years before, for potions of course." Snape said in his familiar stoic manner.
He was only going to take care of this, he wasn't going to embarrass himself as he tried to do anything else. Is what he told himself.
There was determination in her voice, an aura of assertiveness as she pulled him closer. Ron didn't let his fingers slip out yet though, pressing his lips together as he examined her. It made her want to groan in frustration at his cautiousness but she made sure not to utter a sound, not wanting it to be misinterpreted as a sign of unwillingness. So she let him prod and press around for a little while longer, hoping it would give him the surety that he needed. It was pretty adorable in her opinion. Even straightening his back so he could concentrate more fully.
"How did it go with McGonagall by the way? I asked Neville where you were, but he said you hadn't come to dinner so I grabbed a plate with some pizza's and figured you'd be here. I'm sorry if I'd known she was there-"
"Don't worry Harry, I'll go talk to him," She said before stepping closer, fixing her gaze on Draco who looked unimpressed.
"This has been going on for a while now, Harry," Ron said, sounding serious and staring fiercely at him.
"I'm sorry. I didn't want to make you feel hurt, I just didn't know what to say to you or Harry. I-ehm found something out and… I didn't think you guys would get it. It's very personal, a werewolf thing you could say, and I was panicking, I didn't know what to do. And then Draco found out about it and wanted to help me. He did, and he became my friend. He understood, so I really didn't like how you're talking about him, but at the same time, I understood you're angry with me and I shouldn't have avoided you. And I want to tell you what it is, but I just don't know how to." Hermione said in a haste, not sure if Ron had followed her train of talk, especially when she was muffled by her own tears.
His eyes widened as he recounted that fateful day in the boy's bathroom. The day Harry had bitten him…
Draco really wanted to make a joke about Harry catching a ball a werewolf threw. But he couldn't stop thinking how
And as both Harry and Draco watched him, circling around himself while praying to all kinds of gods, it became clear –that it
"I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a death eater. And no one, no one stops being a death eater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban."
"J-just give me a sec," He heard Draco say, and he couldn't stop the smile that spread across his face. He heard more shuffling on inside and he could swear he heard the doors of a closet opening. He heard footsteps making their way towards the door and Harry took a step back from them.
"Could ask you the same thing." Harry panted, his voice lisping. "I could just eat you up…figurativly."
Harry shivered as he tried to get the terrible taste out of his mouth. It had been as tasteless as the blood-bags and he felt his stomach turn as if he was about to throw up.
"I'm sorry, Harry. I didn't mean it like that, it's just… man, I really need a mug of Butterbeer." Ron sighed, landing his head on top of the table.
"Of course not! You want me to talk to her like this?! I'm a sobbing mess!" Ron replied in bewilderment. "My image would be ruined!"
"That's so fucking embarrassing!" Ron groaned as he hid his face in his hands. He had acted like a complete toddler! He thought back to Harry's face.
"Since I saw both Fred and George alive and well after I stepped on the train, I would say yes. Now tell me,"
"Beavertail," Harry mumbled out. Supernatural History had been the last class Ron and him had to take, after it they were supposed to wait another period before it was time for dinner. And since McGonagall wasn't holding back on her scolding and he was still hungry as fuck, Harry found himself too tired to even bother to go to dinner. Especially when seeing everyone able to eat whatever they liked while he was staring at them with envy.
Moving up and down. Pulling back as far as the tip, before quickly moving back down. Over and over again.
She always reprimands him whenever he's not studying or curses at him when he's getting into trouble, just like a mother hen…although, now Harry thought about it…a lot of those times she had offered to help, lend him some notes or think of a good excuse.
"Why chose him, I much more expected someone like McGonagall or that giant, Hagrid. So why?" Draco asked curiously.
A tap and another curl of his finger had her crying out. His movement repeating, twisting, thrusting.
"Yes, yes it's so unfair. Really Draco, you know as much as I do most students don't go wandering off at night in the schools." Snape snapped at Malfoy.
"Hey! Get your own food you piranha!" Draco said indignantly. Though Hermione only smiled before swallowing the meatloaf down.
"Oh, yeah. Terribly funny. Really witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes." Draco said knowing the last part would rile up Potter.
"…I'm totally fine. Really fine, I'm the finest I can be," She said with a high-voice, never having wanted to hear…
After the shopping Draco and his mother were walking back home, on the way they saw some little kids playing with each other, they were having lots of fun. Draco looked at it with envy.
It was quiet for a moment before Harry continued. "I'm deeply ashamed of what I've done, and horrified by the fact that I couldn't stop. I tried, but I couldn't! I shouldn't have pushed you against the wall, and I shouldn't have drunk your blood. I shouldn't have hurt you and I completely understand that you hate me, are disgusted with me and are scared of me." Harry said, looking back up. Seeing Malfoy's shocked expression. "I shouldn't have judged you so hard, especially when you only did what I had asked. And I'm so, SO sorry! I hope we can put this past us and…maybe try to be friends?"
It just had been way easier to reply to her letter than to actually give her a fire-call, like he had with Harry. Still, he hadn't expected a letter from here asking how he was doing and if he liked the gift. He had felt pretty ashamed of his cowardliness then and had quickly decided to write her a letter in return, though he used his owl Pigwidgeon instead of the old-fashioned way, knowing it would take days before it had arrived at her destination if he used muggle ways. He hadn't even been able to remember where she stayed, which made him question how the hell she knew where he had been.
"I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch (Dumbledore pointed to a man with red cat eyes and a tail) has asked me to remind you that the 3rd-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. In Hogwarts we've got a lot of creatures, we would like to remind everyone that we'll not support any discrimination of any kind." Dumbledore looked over at Neville who was looking a little taut. "Thank you."
"Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?" Ron asked.
She moved her hand away from the bookcase, giving Harry her complete attention as she looked behind him. "Go on,"
"Blown up?!" Harry asked now even angrier than before. "You told me my parents died in a car crash!"
"I don't need it, besides Potter, it wouldn't be fair if I got the vial seeing you've done the most work," Malfoy said, not turning around before dashing out of the classroom, following Parkinson and Zabini.
"What I mean? Hmm, well kinda like how cute it was when you were scolding me and being so concerned." Harry said stepping closer to Draco, on which Draco took a step back.
Draco gulped, body shivering with the way it was pounded into. His prostate getting hit with every shove. Did he really need to say it again?
He narrowed his eyes in return. "You sure our famous do-gooder Hermione Granger would want to hear about such criminal activities?"
When she was close enough her grandfather stood up and opened up his arms for an embrace. She smiled as she hugged him and wished him a Merry Christmas. She then moved to give her parents a kiss, who returned it and told her to quickly open up her presents.
"Continue," He eventually whispered. Squealing –in a very unmanly manner- when he was suddenly bent against the cushions with a panting vampire in between his legs. Kissing every part of him. And no, no -
"NO! Soft puppy, and smells nice." Ron mumbled, refusing to let go. Harry rolled his eyes and tried not to laugh at Rons' drunken talk. Hermione huffed and moved her shoulders and back.
"Damn, fuck you! I really liked being taller than you, dwarf." Draco said before he could help himself again. Dammit! He was going to fuck this up again. Draco made himself ready for the insults that didn't come, instead, Potter started laughing.
"I'll be fine, but I do need to ask; since when have you so many admirers?" Her grandmother said with a wave of her eyebrows, making Hermione frown.
"Harry, your fangs are out. Hadn't I told you that you can get a punishment for that? Seriously you never listen." She said sounding a bit annoyed.
"Welcome, my children. In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight." The three-eyed woman said and walked into her little table.
"Dammit Harry, stop pacing you're making me nervous!" Ron said, looking up at him from his magazine as he leisurely sat on the couch. Next to him sat Hermione who was also staring at him, seeming confused as well.
"Ah Great, Harry you're awake! Now bring your lazy arse out of the bed and go dress yourself!" Neville said as he tried to pull the hem of Ron's shirt down, with Ron whining and struggling against it.
They were laying on their recently purchased high-quality kings bed, not too soft nor too firm and completely custom made. Because Draco refused to sleep another night on the stiffening, worn-down mattress of death that Harry thought was
"Harry, when didn't we?" Ron said, a smirk crossing his lips as a plan started forming in their heads.
Draco regarded his own stamp on the vampire, seeing the nasty traces of his claws stretching all the way from his lover's back to his collarbone. "Oops, indeed,"
"Hey guys, sorry I'm late," Hermione breathed out as she stood on the opposite side of where he and Harry sat next to each other. Ron's stomach dropped when he saw her, his body filling with a sense of dread. "I wanted to ask Mrs. Babbling about some of the contents of our new subject and how best to approach it, I don't want to make the same mistake as I did with my O.S.L.s,"
