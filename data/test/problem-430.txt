"Harry, Harry, oh Merlin it feels so, so," Draco trailed off, his eyes rolling up into the back of his skull. His hands darted forward from their position above his head and gripped at Harry's thin hips. Draco bucked up and rolled his hips hard, cock twitching and back arching. Cum spurted out of his cock and ropes of his release landed on his stomach. He slumped down a moment later, gasping for breath, hands loosening their grip around his hips.
Draco smiled softly, leaning forward and saying in a quiet voice, "I've made someone cum from just looking at them from across a bar."
He sat up on the bed, almost face to face with the other, and he tipped them over, rolling Draco onto his back. Draco stared up at him, shock written all over his face.
"Ngh, Draco, fuck me harder, please," he whined out, not even thinking at this point, about to forget his name in the next minute or so.
Draco tapped at his side and Harry sighed, sliding out slowly and pushing himself up off of the other.
Harry was entranced as he watched Draco's hole swallow up his length, over and over again, almost a blur. Draco's cock was a bright red, rock hard, and dripping with precum. Harry reached up a hand slowly, wrapping thin fingers around the long thing.
"You keep them there like that. You'd better not move or I'll tie them instead," he said firmly. Draco nodded, fidgeting. His armpits were hairless and Harry almost snorted out loud. Of course they were.
He was smaller than the other, had been teased about it for years, even after they had forgiven and forgotten. Perhaps it was the past teasing that made bringing Draco practically to tears so good. Harry felt drunk on power- or drunk on the taste of Draco- either way he was drunk.
“try again” he said, although he began moving his hand around Draco’s cock slowly. Draco looked confused, “my name” Harry prompted.
i drank an entire bottle of two litre diet coke whilst drinking this, i just think that’s an important aspect to this chapter
Harry almost fell off his broom after hearing this. Everyone in the pitch stopped, they had all been watching them race for the snitch. But they all froze immediately after hearing Draco shout. Lavender was holding the quaffle and dropped it to the floor.
“oh yeah?” Pansy raised an eyebrow “Potter, truth or dare?” no one questioned that it wasn’t her turn, she obviously had a point to make.
Blaise looked at her thoughtfully “you know Pansy, I would’ve thought the most illegal thing youve ever done was-”
“Fuck” draco moaned at Harrys sudden close proximity. He pulled weakly at his hands held up above his head, but the grip on them just tightened. Draco whined, Harry cut him off with a rough kiss.
“Okay guyls” Pansy started, once they had all regrouped on the ground, “you guys shower, no offence, but you stink. Then regroup in the common room, and truth or dare round three shall commence”
It seemed that only a day had passed when Pansy stormed into his and Blaise’s dorm early Saturday morning.
Potter let go of Draco’s hands, he moved them into Potter’s hair and pulled his lips towards his own. They kissed, Draco took charge. He turned then round so he had Potter pushed up against the wall. He controlled the kiss, his tongue exploring Harry's mouth, he slid his leg in between the other boys again. Harry moaned as Draco moved his mouth to his neck again and began to suck it.
Just when Longbottom was about to score again, it started to rain. This would have been annoying, if it had not caused Longbottom to miss. The rain continued to get heavier, it was difficult to see more than a couple meters in front of him. Potter whistled to cause a timeout. They all flew to the ground.
Ten minutes later they were sitting in a circle in the corner of the common room, underneath a large window that overlooked the grounds. A bottle of firewhiskey in the middle of them, and an inch high bottle of veritaserum next to it.
Harry suddenly pulled dracos hips down onto his crotch, so that he could feel how hard Harry already was, he had to bite his lip to stop himself from whining at that, “or i will fuck you right here on this chair until you have learnt to call me my proper name”
Draco showered and walked back to his dorm. Pansy was now sitting on Blaises bed, he was still under the covers, ignoring her.
The week went by much too quickly for Draco. Potter had been avoiding eye contact with him all week, which Draco didn’t mind, it just meant that Potter was actively thinking about avoiding him, thus Draco was still in his head. He was winning.
Harry turned his head around faster than he thought humanly possible. Pansy Parkinsoon stood in the doorway, a look of shock on her face.
Harry walked along a dark corridor; complete silence filled the air. doors either side of him were locked and he could hear faint screaming behind them. He felt mildly confused.
Her eyes lit up, which was always a bad sign. “Go and ask the golden trio to join our game. They’ve been glaring at us for the past ten minutes”
She blushed a pale pink, and then pulled off her lilac t-shirt. Her sister wolf whistled, and she laughed before putting her middle finger up at her.
“Fuck, I missed you,” Draco, unable to form coherent words, whined and pulled Harry impossibly closer and clamped his legs around the other man's waist. “you have no idea how long I've been looking for you. Who would've thought I'd find you in Wizarding France. Married to some rich pureblood ponce.”
As he said the last sentence, he searched Draco's eyes for answers. Draco couldn't give him one, as he didn't know it himself.
After a series of licking, nipping and sucking from Harry's part, something wet and warm hit his face just as Draco released a muffled moan, his palm over his mouth. When he pulled away and sat up he realized that Draco came all over his stomach.
Snorting, Draco turned his back in hopes that the man wouldn't read the mortifying, unsaid want written on his face. Draco knew Harry would be disgusted of him if he realized, even more than he probably already was. Draco was disgusted of himself.
Despite himself, he raised his head and expected to see an empty space where Harry had been — except he was engulfed face full by a staggeringly familiar scent that settled itself beside him. A foot away too close. The overwhelming scent of Amortentia.
They settled on languid kisses and casual rubbing for a few minutes, simply familiarizing themselves with each other. Until Harry moved away from his lips and took one of the pillows before placing it under Draco's hips. His lips moved downwards to his chest, placing tender kisses on Draco's stomach and then finally settling in between his legs.
To his surprise, Harry simply chuckled and leaned his forehead on his own. Draco frowned, offended. “is it too soon to say I love you?”
” he chanted absently, as though his name was a prayer, staring dazedly at Harry through his thick, bright lashes, his eyes seemed opalescent under the moonlight. His long blonde locks splayed out against the dark sheets, a few strands stuck to his cheek. Harry pressed his hips down, feeling his chest heat up at the sight of Draco's eyes fluttering close and lips part. He let his hands travel south, gripping Draco's hips then thumbing at the lace fabric.
“Enough bullshit for me to know you couldn't be happy being tied to someone like that,” Desperately, he looked for the words to get out of the corner Harry has pushed him into. Draco must have let the silence stretch too long and confirmed his statement. “and just now, you we're thinking of running away. Weren't you?”
“I want to hear you.” Harry muttered against Draco's thigh. Draco sucked in a sharp breath before moving his hand away, releasing pretty little noises as Harry's fingers began to prod inside him. He shook his head.
would wake and hear it from across the house. Hear how Harry's name was a delighted squeak and gasp from Draco's lips while being fucked with the most passion the world can give. Make him regret ever inviting Harry over and introducing him to his husband.
“Don't you remember?” Harry searched his eyes. “I've always thought your hair was really pretty. Especially like this.”
,” Draco sucked in a sharp breath prompting Harry to run comforting patterns on his skin. “he said you couldn't come with him that night so I couldn't be sure if it was you. But consider my interest piqued, so I told him what I knew he wanted to hear.”
Draco thought this was Heaven on earth, as he clenched down greedily. His own cock pulsing on his belly as Harry worked his way into him. But he felt so full and he wanted to come untouched on Harry's cock alone.
, he had owled Harry as soon as he locked himself in the room as Harry was just leaving, knowing he'd receive the letter in less than five hours.
No his father wasn't the most loving father and he was strict, but he had always made it clear to Draco that he only wanted the best for his only child. He wasnt always there but he provided, and he would step in for Draco at the slightest provocation.
"Most only sense the change in their destined mate. Harrison, if your mate or mates were male, it would answer the question of your breeder status without needing an appointment." Harrys grandfather appeared in the empty portrait above the parlor mantle.
Severus might not care as much, but it was no secret that Draco idolized his father and that likely stung a bit. However, Lucius figured that it was well deserved and would end in results that much faster.
Shopping was a different experience than anything Harry had ever seen before. Everyone was dressed in the same strange clothes as Snape was and the shops carried some of the strangest things that Harry couldn't even begin to name.
The man knew though that his mates not being there would only aggravate the young mans rejection illness. A fact that he tried to relay to Dumbledore, but without telling him why their presence was so necessary, Dumbledore had them both removed, to return at the end of the day.
"Hello there, my boy. Might I see you in my office after dinner. There are a few things which we should discuss more privately." The headmaster said, that twinkle in his eye making Harry supremely uncomfortable.
Second problem Harry was faced with was the wizengamot. Harry had a seat for the Potter family and was obligated now to fill it. However, most of the dates for the meetings clashed with his schooling, and he wouldn't likely be taken seriously until after he graduated anyway, emancipated or not. This meant he needed a proxy. He needed someone he trusted to vote in his interest.
"I want to know who it was that jixed his broom as soon as I get back. And not one foot will have left the ground until I get back from the hospital wing, am I clear!" Her words were a clear command and everyone else nodded assent.
"This will do. Do start supper, the boy appears half starved and I have no doubt we will have a long road ahead of us getting him to full health." Mr Snape replied and the thing snapped its fingers and was gone with another pop.
"At the moment you magical guardian gave his permission for you to be entered into the tournament he had waved his rights as guardian. It is standard for the winner of the tournament to be emancipated as part of the reward for winning, if the champion was underage. That was part of the old rules and still was legally and magically binding. Therefore, Magic sought to give you all of your inheritances as soon as your hand gripped the cup. This included your latent creature inheritance. It is possible that without the tournament magic, you might have never manifested your creature side, but it wouldn't have manifested at all if the blood wasn't there by more than 20%.
"I'm sure that, no matter what, magic would not saddle you with a mate that wouldn't do all they could to protect and care for you. It is what you need after all." His grandfather looked at him sadly. No, Harry had not told him any of the details of how he was raised, but he had guessed at the important parts. Harry was clearly neglected, touch starved, and malnourished. Between that and how little Harry thought of himself told Charlus all he really needed to know anyway.
"We aren't very good mates and our worry clouded our judgement. I should have known something was wrong. You dropped so many hints that someone was messing with your mind and we completely ignored it. I'm sorry Harry." Draco said, his eyes were brimmed with rare tears as he stood behind Severus looking very uncomfortable.
Harry was sneaking through the corridors, sticking to the walls so as not to bump into anyone on the way to the dungeons.
His Aunt had been absolutely livid. She ran his arm under ther water and then promptly locked him in his cupbard, arm still bleeding and now wet also. He had no idea how he did these strange things but he knew it was bad. He just wished he knew how to stop it.
OK, so a lot happened here. Hope you guys like it. It actually took a while to come up with an idea for how the legal system would work, so I kind of combined the voting process with the supreme court and added a little fantasy to make it work. Hope you guys like it. Leave a comment and let me know.
So yeah. Im a bit rusty but here we go. I couldn't find my original notes so this is going forward based on memory alone so we shall see how this goes.
"The Malfoys helped raise me with my adoptive father. Im Harry Potter and you are?" Harry asked, voice going stoney a bit.
"Albus, I received a summons. I doubt the Dark Lord is happy." Severus said, entering the mans office. His mark burned just a bit more, giving Snape a sense of urgency.
Harry had sent an owl off with a formal complaint to the minister and a copy with a letter and bottled memory to Lucius so it couldn't be pushed under the rug.
Do you follow so far Mister Potter?" Griphook kindly asked, likely noticing the expression on Harrys face.
"Lucius, one day I will get angry enough at you to actually curse you." Snape said back, slightly annoyed at the timing of the intrusion.
The whole plan centered around the cabinet though. If it didn't work, some of the aurors might need to be at the store to surprise them. That meant the Order of Chickens needed to be at the school.
After all, Narcissa had had an infatuation with another wizard at one point and it very nearly killed them both. Lucius did not handle the assumed rejection well, and Narcissa was so filled with quilt that she very nearly lost her mind.
Draco hated being in different houses. He made that clear very quickly. They had very few classes together and didnt have much time to hang out as Harry did most of his homework with Hermione, who Draco still refused to meet again even after Pansy and Blaise had been properly introduced and claimed to like her ok.
"If you must know, as a secondary prize, any participating champions in the tri-wizard tournament are emancipated if they win while underage. It's a part of the old rules. They didn't bother to change them since it was supposed to only be of age students in the first place. Now, if you will excuse me, but I am in the middle of trying to retake the Potter Family Seat and estates. I have a lot to catch up on and really must be going." Harry answered, making a hasty retreat, easily catching up to Griphook so they could apparate away.
It wasnt long after that, that Draco went off the find their other firends. Harry agreed to wait and save the compartment for them.
After Draco fled in embarrassment, Harry was only alone for a few minuets before his former friends found him. One long, awkward, silent train ride later, Harry was glad to finally be at the castle.
Looking over, he saw Potter grinning at him happily, causing ... A feeling, of sorts. Regardless Draco blushed and looked away quickly. Ugh what even was wrong with that guy?
"Severous, my friend, I have an idea. We can raise him along side Draco. The child was tested earlier and his magic is off the charts. I will sponser his early education. So he would spend most days at the manor with us and share a tutor with Draco.
And it was all coming to a head tonight apparently as he stepped into Severus' office only to see him sitting beside Draco, both with glum stone-like expressions.
Before Madam Hooch could blow her whistle though Harry noticed his broom glow for only a brief moment.
"Welcome to Potter Manor, Lord Malfoy. Please follow me, we shall take tea in the parlor." Harry greeted him politely just as his grandfather had been drilling into his head.
When the day came though to board the train, Harry was immediately overwhelmed. The sheer number of people was unnecessarily claustrophobic despite there being plenty of room since people still felt the need to walk so close as to bump into him.
"As if. You lot have been in Slytherin for generations. If you're not wearing green the day after sorting, I'll swallow the darn charm myself." Harry said confidently.
"You leave my wife out of this. Well Harry shall we go. I'm sure you have a few questions for me as well. We can leave the brooding bat to deal with the headmaster and mope to hearts content." Lucius said turning to Harry.
"I thought the same. I should have delved deeper in our occlumency lessons. Of course you weren't progressing. No one can while they are troubled and of course you were. The obliviates were tampering with your memories. Had I done more than just graze your surface thoughts I would have seen it, though I had thought it best to teach you more gently. I am sorry." Severus added. His speech was shorter though a lot more profound to Harry at that moment.
The man wouldn't show it, not any more than Lucious would anyway, but to someone who knew Severous well, it was clear.
Harry waited no more than a few moments before a warm wash of magic that felt so familiar, though he had never felt it before, welcomed him in, and he watched in amazement as the gates cleared themselves of any rust or vines and swung open without so much a creak.
Harrys nerves grew from there. At least Draco was sure of where he was going. Harry couldnt be sure.
"Oh Draco..." Pansys arms came around him. She was always a good friend, however snarky and over confident. A hug from her was rare, but always came when most needed.
"He's my best friend and I basically abandoned him. I'd be hurt too if it was the other way around. Look I'll talk to you guys later, but I am taking this weekend off of practice. I need to catch up on my homework anyway." Harry said, leaving a barely touched lunch behind with a group of very confused Griffindors.
Indeed, there were no cobwebs or creepy shadows. The corridor was brightly lit, with a plush running carpet down the middle. The statues that had creeped him out as a first year were now almost tasteful. Funny what a duster and a bit of light will do for a place.
It was enough to drive you mad on any day, but it was Dracos birthday for Circes sake. Just congratulate him and move leave well enough alone.
"Harry....." The warning in his grandfathers voice had Harry standing from the desk to take the aforementioned break before the man had Miffty bring out the sashes again.
Lucious always knew muggles were repulsive. Well now he had proof didn't he. And everyone thought he was just pretentious. HA!
Lucius remained silent. Of course Harry didn't know about the family wing. Who was there to visit him after all. From what Lucius could gather, there was bad blood between him and his muggle family so they were unlikely to visit a magical castle. Sirius was a fugitive so that was out too.
Maybe he shouldn't have gone easy on Harry with occlumency either. Had he delved even a bit further he would have sensed the obliviates in Harrys mind. So many opportunities to help him lost because he was trying to be gentle with a type of magic that was known for its abrasiveness. He was a master, of course Harry couldn't feel it if he was being gentle about it.
Draco smirked, happy to have gotten through to him. Harry could work on his depression when the war was over. For now, there was a war to be won.
"I do believe woman, that he is safer behind ancient family wards at his own manor than the hovel you call home. As for you Mr. Potter, I would like a word in regards to the wizengamot. I was going to send you an owl, but since you are here..." Lord Malfoy let the sentence end prematurely. It was like he was testing him in someway.
The front entrance had a tall three story cieling with a parlor on the right and a large entry room to the left.
"Go speak to whom you need to Severus. I will get him patched up like new, as I always do." Poppy offered.
"I agree. This will take time and effort on all our parts. Here is what I propose. We have dinner together twice a week. Just the three of us in my chambers. We can start with that. We can sit, eat and talk." Severus proposed.
"Yes right over there, just as before. You will write, I must not tell lies and I will obey authority. I will let you know when you may stop." Umbridge said as she motioned for Harry to sit.
They had likely been told via the gossip mill that Harry had awoken and was currently barely existing without them.
It did pay of course to have the minister as a drinking companion. Close enough for favors and powerful enough to maybe, lets say, get a hold of the final will and testiment of one Lily Potter.
"Honestly, we have been looking everywhere for you. Where have you been? The headmaster has been trying to get a hold of you for weeks now. You should be ashamed of yourself running off on your poor family like you have." Molly ranted.
"Something else is different. Your aura changed too. I can sense it even though I won't get my own veela inheritance until I turn seventeen. What's up with that?" Draco was being decidedly blunt today.
The first Wizengamot meeting of the season was next week. It was inconveniently on a bloody tuesday. Who scheduled a major meeting on a tuesday anyway.
The rest of the train ride was uneventful. The others were bristling when they heard Harry recount his encounter with Ron. Fisrt he insulted their house of choice but they also called Draco and his Father evil which they knew first hand was false.
"That's what you've said, but Harry are you sure nothing else has changed. I mean you've been so tired lately on top of everything. We just want you better." Draco continued despite knowing very well that Harry was getting annoyed.
"One moment please, I will need to fetch Griphook for you. He handles all the Potter and Evens accounts, and since the tournament is over, will need to forge you a new key." The teller announced, surprising him. Harry nodded to the goblin, who promptly took off down one of the many hallways.
"Harry Potter? Like THE Harry Potter. Do you have the, you know, the scar?" Ron was practically whispering when he finished.
They never reached the door that had held fluffy, as that was at the end of the hall, but instead stopped at another door.
"Mom!" "Not ok!" The twins for once had different statements though still spoke in synch. Percy was silently horrified and likely trying to remember why he had agreed to be there at all. Ron and Hermione however were glaring at Harry and the Malfoys.
Harry did however make one friend in Gryfindor. Another student who felt wrongfully placed. A certain Hermione Granger. The girl was incessantly intelligent and they often had theoretical debates regarding different subjects, as well as double checking each others work. They even talked about different electives they could take in the second term.
That wench has been..... Severus, you know I don't say this lightly, but if what Dumbledore has said about He-who-must-not-be-named returning is true, does that mean you are spying again?" The nurse asked as she busied herself with the unrecognizable gash that tore deeply into Harrys hand.
The time has come to leave Hogwarts. Let's see what happens. There has been some speculation about what will happen, but here we go.
This will let you have your time away for your potions and such without endangering a child and will give him another child to play and interact with. Plus Narcissa has been bugging me about making sure he comes over often anyway." Lucious was perfectly fine with the idea of Draco spending time with another child to get him more active anyway.
"Come in." Her voice grated from the other side of the door sounding very much like she was pleased with herself.
"Never heard the term best for last then have you?" Harry quipped back. A smirk on his face as he teased the blonde.
Yes Dracos 11th birthday, the last before he started at Hogwarts and was undeniably sorted into Slytherin. Harry understood the milestone as in about 3 weeks he would hit the same milestone.
"Oh will you both stop. You're going to get yourselves in trouble. The professor is here and we'd all like to hear what she has to say." The familiar voice of Hermione perked up. She had originally been speaking with another bookish type girl a bit behind them until then.
The ever loved scene of Harrys first flying lesson with a little bit of a twist. This was so bloodyanoying to write because tweaking it but still making it as iconic as before is hard. You guys will need to let me know how i did.
The adults thought all this was absolutely entertaining and alowed the silly behaviour. It was a party after all. The kids should be having fun.
Harry and Hermione were standing with Draco and the others and Ron was glaring in their general direction.
"Long enough to be more than a little jaded, but not so long as to have all the pieces to the puzzle either. I didn't say anything to anyone because I learned from a young age to never trust adults. Between my relatives, and the way the teachers here acted towards me (Harry gave Snape a pointed look here) there was no real point. No one seemed capable of helping me. I'm telling you now, because I believed what you said before you knew I was here." Harry explained.
The boys both blushed crimson as they ran the rest of the way down, and marched to the ballroom at Malfoy Manor.
"Actually, Headmaster, unless it is pertaining to school or classes, nothing else is really any of your business, and I'll ask you kindly to stay out of it. . . . And I'm not your boy." The entire hall had gone completely silent watching the exchange. It was true then, THE Harry Potter, was no longer siding with Dumbledore. It would be across the whole of Britain by morning.
"Go with flow for now. I have no idea beyond that. I never thought Mother would leave Fathers side. Of course I dont know if Fathers even alright. This will be considered treason. Theres no guarantee the Dark Lord won't think Father had a hand in it." Draco had refused to think about it before, but now the truth was there.
"Considering Harrys abysmal luck, I admit to surprise, but there was not a single hitch." Harry immediately stopped laughing at Draco to glare half heartedly at Severus. The whole scene was quite entertaining.
"Unfortunately I will be busy today. However, I am free tomorrow afternoon, if you would like to come by the manor for tea. Would around 2 o'clock work for you?" Harry extended the invitation. Harry knew he was out of his depths here and would prefer to play host than guest. He hoped that was subtle enough.
"Something like that. I'm no fool. I learned very early on not to trust anyone lightly. If what you two want, is an end to this madness, then help me end it with as little blood spilled as possible. If things continue as they are, magicals in Britain, Scotland, and Ireland will be extinct. And all for a war between two people." Harry continued.
Before long however they were all riding the boats to the castle. The other years gliding in the coaches above them and reaching the castle much sooner.
"Of course Lord Potter. I shall be going through the Potter accounts and sending all records here by owl post. Then we can set a date to update the family wards. Welcome home Lord Potter." Griphook said kindly (for a goblin anyway) before he turned and vanished.
When he was done Harry sat down and started looking over the next potion they would be going over in class. They were working specifically in healing for the next few weeks and the next potion was specifically for dragon fire burns. (Huh, that would have been useful last year)
Draco looked around the common room and saw Blaise sat at a desk in the corner, he caught his eye and motioned towards the group sat on the floor. Blaise flicked his wand and all of the parchment and books around him organised themselves, he walked over “truth or dare: round two, you ready?”
Again Draco had to pull his thoughts away. “don’t think about leaving your own marks all over Potter” “don’t think about leaving your own marks all over Potter” “don’t think about leaving your own marks all over Potter”. again, it didn’t work.
Draco bit his lip, his hips rutting up into the larger boys hand, “more, Harry, fuck i need-’ he cut himself off with a quickly stifled moan.
Weasley obviously felt bad for bringing this upon Potter as he turned to Pansy quickly “truth or dare?”
This was when the bell rang, signalling lunch ending. Draco paused, thinking of how much trouble he would be in if he missed arithmancy. He detached himself from Potter, which took almost all of his self control.
Pansy smirked “take off your shirt”. Potter shrugged and pulled his shirt over his head. Draco had to forcibly stop himself from choking on the amount of air he had just inhaled.
“oh i don’t know” Draco laughed sarcastically “i’m sure Pansy would love to know the Golden Boy gets off on me calling him by his first name”
Draco looked up at him with his large pupils dilated, almost begging Harry to go faster. He complied, losing himself and moving his hips harder and faster.
She sighed but her and Blaise both left. Draco began the walk back to his dorm, still smiling to himself at the look on Potter's face when he had winked.
He felt himself relax as the familiar words began to present themselves to him, and then Hogwarts appeared in front of him. his gaze wandered first to Malfoys dorm, where he saw the blonde boy was still in his bed. Satisfied that his dream was definitely a dream he looked again over the castle.
He was satisfied with this, and immediately sped up his hand, attaching his lips to Draco’s neck once again.
“what do you gain out of this?” Harry interjected, breaking out of the silence he had kept whilst trying to think straight.
Harry chuckled as he grabbed his towel and wrapped it around his waist again. “I'll meet you in the common room” he said, before leaving Draco in the shower, the taste of Harry still lingering in his mouth.
“yes” Harry said solemnly, Draco looked up at him, obviously not expecting this response to see that Harry was smiling.
“Boys” she called as soon as she had walked in, without knocking. The girl had no manners when it came to him and Blaise.
Potter pulled the tie over his head, not bothered to undo the knot, and let it hang loose against his chest. It took all of Draco's self control not to drag Potter back to his dorm room and- he should not be thinking about him here. Especially in tight jeans.
Draco didn’t speak, Potter continued “and the fucking rain, merlin. Malfoy, it was hard most of that game.”
Draco shot a look around the common room. “Longbottom, Thomas, Finnegan. Truth or dare, slytherin style?”
Draco looked over, they certainly were. Granger looked angry, Weasley looked bemused and Potter simply looked curious.
Padma laughed “you know Potter, I’m not usually a fan of men but I wouldn’t say no” Potter blushed a deep shade of red.
Harry stood up and they met in the middle of the circle, Malfoy turned back to Pansy. A pleading look in his eyes. She smirked at him, and mimed vulgar making out.
“I don't know, Potter, I've heard slytherin saliva has magical properties” Malfoy looked up at him, he licked his lips. “Care to try?”
This seemed to bring them both to their senses, as Malfoy quickly jumped off of Harry. He looked around the group that was watching them. Hermione was blushing and looking politely away, Ron had his head in his hands and seemed to be shaking his head as if blocking out what was happening around him. Padma and Parvati were both giggling at Harry’s shocked face. Neville and Hannah were both staring at him, looking bashful. Dean and Seamus both raised their eyebrows when he looked at them, he quickly looked away. Lavender and Blaise were both laughing. Parkinson looked gleeful, and incredibly smug. she was looking at Malfoy with a knowing expression, Harry looked over at Malfoy, he had somehow acquired a bottle of fire whiskey and was drinking straight out of the bottle. Harry tried not to take this as an insult.
“What the fuck Harry” Weasley shouted from the other end of the pitch, “you could’ve got that, he’s messing with you, idiot”
“You know what” Parkinson started “let's do this again next week, I for one, definitely have some ideas for next week”. She winked at Malfoy. He glowered at her.
“oh please,” Pansy interrupted this “you all know it’s true”, no one questioned her “anyway, the slytherins aren't taking over. it’s the tie, immediately makes you more attractive”
“Hey Draco just went, that doesn't seem fair” Lavender intervened, and looked at Pansy for clarification. Pansy just shrugged in reply and looked to Hermione, obviously curious as to what the girl was going to ask.
She stood up, and crouched in front of Malfoy. Put her hand under his chin and planted a kiss directly on his lips.
They were five minutes into the game, Potter’s team were up by one goal. And it was basically torture, Draco had been circling the pitch, watching Potter, for the whole time. Potter hadn’t looked at him once. Which was a little bit annoying, seeing as the seekers were supposed to watch each other all the time. So Potter was deliberately ignoring him, which was a little bit insulting.
As soon as Harry knew he was out of sight he broke into a run, nine minutes was not a lot of time to get all the way to the kitchens and back. Especially carrying bottles. Nevertheless Harry sprinted down the corridors, skidding around corners. Luckily the corridors were nearly empty, Harry guessed it was almost curfew, so most people were in their common rooms by now. He finally found himself in front of the painting that led to the kitchens. He tickled the pair to open the door and stepped inside.
Malfoy wrapped his arms around Harry's neck, which bought their bodies closer together. Their kiss deepened and Malfoy threaded his hands into Harry's dark hair. Malfoy moaned again as Harry nibbled lightly on his bottom lip, both boys were completely unaware of the faces of everyone around them. Ron looked a little bit sick, Hermione looked at them knowingly, Lavender, Padma and Parvati were all watching with their mouths slightly open, Dean and Seamus looked shocked, Neville looked confused, Zabini was smirking, Parkinson was practically glowing with smugness.
His mind switched again, and suddenly Draco was below him, naked and moaning his name. Harry moaned, he moved his hand faster.
Potter sat down near the front, next to Weasley, and got out his potions book, acting as if everyone was not staring at him with their mouths hanging open. He didn’t seem to notice the dozens of eyes all trained to the back of his neck, or the fact that some people were actually pointing at him. Either he didn’t notice, or he just wasn’t bothered.
He wanted to help, of course he did, he was the savior, that was his whole thing. but he knew he couldn’t. He kept walking, knowing something was waiting for him, if he just got round this corner, there would be something there. The corridor seemed to stretch forever, it was killing him. Why couldn’t he get round the corner? He needed to make it round. He needed to find whatever was waiting.
Draco always took longer in the showers than everyone else, he had hair to take care of, and a complexion that he actually cared about. Unlike any of the others on the quidditch team.
Finally, Winky seemed to decide it was okay to give Harry the drinks. She put them into a table cloth and tied it into a makeshift bag, Harry levitated it with his wand.
Down at the quidditch pitch, Potter and Weasley were both already in the air, passing a quaffle back and forth. Longbottom and Hannah were sitting on a bench, very close together, both blushing. Pansy immediately locked her eyes onto Lavender and made her way over to ‘chat’, Padma and Parvati were sat with Finnegan and Thomas, they were all laughing. Theo and Daphne both made their way onto the pitch, Theo walked over to join Draco and Blaise, Daphne made a beeline for Pansy.
“Sweetie, you invented this game” Parkinson’s reply came swiftly, “now, start kissing or I’ll have to hex you”
“Good chat, Potter” he called behind him, at his part confused, part aroused, and part angry face, “I'll see you on Saturday” he winked, and then walked out of the classroom, picking up his bag on the way out.
He moaned at this one word and muttered “fuck yes” as Harry began to attack his neck with his lips and tongue, going over the marks that he had already left. Whilst at the same time, wrapping his hand around Draco’s cock and moving it slowly back and forth along the shaft. Malfoy went to move his hand to Harrys but he was stopped as Harry pinned both hands above his head. “Keep them there” he growled in Draco’s ear.
"I hate it when he's right. The others might be harder to convince..." Molly stopped as she thought more about the situation.
"No I don't think he does. But he'll be punishing me for treason, Draco for failing and Cissa for never joining at all in one shot. It would be perfectly effective too." Lucious basically spat the last words out.
"Yes, and how is young Potter. I've heard he is not well. Have you learned anything about this?" Why would the Dark Lord care about that?
Sure he smiled and joked and laughed like normal, but it felt like a script. Like he was acting. But surely that couldn't be, nothing seemed to have phased him before and Draco would have noticed in the previous years if something had changed.
By lunch time, Harry was already rather annoyed. He could feel eyes on him again and he pointedly refused to look anywhere near the staff table where Dumbledore was obviously trying to gain his attention.
"Well obviously. And its been easier to manage since I decided to try to grow it out. You just look pointy." Harry argued having gotten bored waiting for Draco to finish getting dressed..
"Now, now then what's all this. Surely you wouldn't attack a young lord in public like this. I'm almost tempted to summon the aurors myself." Harry knew the dark tones of that voice by now.
Molly, bless the woman, was only stunned for a brief moment before coming back to herself and yet still couldnt come up with a proper response.
"You, you can't do this. This is kidnapping. I will have you destroyed for this. Do you hear me Snape?" The woman ranted. Snape simply ignored her. He stunned her before obliviating her of the entire detention. She wouldn't know what had happened during this detention any more than Harry had known about the previous ones. All part of Snapes brand of justice served.
"Magic, dear boy. And come out. Theres nothing to fear from a house elf. Dinsy keeps the house clean and serves meals. If you need anything she'll be more than delighted to help you." Mr. Snape explained.
Stamping down his shock and ... distaste, for the room and the other person in it Harry stepped in and closed the door behind him.
Then she write a letter to Dumbledore. She pleaded he watch over Draco and to be cautious of the death eaters directly targeting him soon if Draco abandoned his mission as she hoped. And added a string of appologies for everything she allowed to occur up until that point.
"You'll be better off in the end and a lot happier for it. And isnt that all a mother really wants for her children." Narcissa countered, leaving Draco to board the train with the Weasleys and Harry himself.
It was the morning that Harry needed to leave for Hogwarts and his house elves were practically grieving.
"The Dark Lord wants you to teach me to guard my mind? How exactly is that beneficial to him? He has been trying to kill me up to this point after all." Harry countered, completely confused.
Everywhere Harry looked he saw gorgeous gowns and dress robes. There were crystal goblets and fancy foods across an entire wall. Harry was beginning to feel the ever encroaching shyness that plagued him when Draco wasnt around creep in.
"It won't be easy. Besides, once away from the school, the Dark Lord would want to speak with me. He wants to see you turn sides, as it would negate the prophesy and the need to kill you in one swoop." Severus explained.
Harry, however, barely reacted to their presence aside from flinching as the infirmary doors creaked open. Of course Harry likely sensed his mates coming and wasn't sure about how to react if at all. Still he nodded to Lucius as he left but didn't turn to face Severus or Draco.
"Arther! Dear we have unexpected company!" Molly called out, heading into the place like she owned it.
"Well, I shall inform Draco as well to be on the lookout. Let's finish up here, and then I have a report to make." Lucius stated, clearly dreading the additional paperwork.
The only good thing about the whole thing was how Hermione had wound up getting along with Pansy and Blaise really well. Draco was slowly warming up to her but he still really only tolerated her.
So I was going to diverge a bit and follow Harry and Draco on the train ride, and i promise next chapter but Narcissa has interesting history with the Black family home, being born a Black herself and I could never resist a good reminiscent moment when presented one.
Draco looked to him. Potter had this stupid mirthful look on his face that instantly irritated and stunned him at the same time. It kind of reminded him of Dumbledore for a moment. The old git must be rubbing off on Potter.
"Winning the tournament also got me emancipated. Magic felt it prudent then to give me my magical inheritance with my nearest birthday. I went to the bank to figure it out while the Dursleys were out of the house.The goblins were kind enough to tell me the honest truth about a few things. That's how it started. Anything else?" Harry asked. He knew Draco was likely a gossip like his father so he figured if he said everything now then he likely wouldn't need to repeat himself later.
"If I've been emancipated, then can I use magic freely now? With discretion around my muggle relatives not withstanding." Harry asked hopefully.
It was at this time that his door resounded a knock. Harry and Draco had created a pattern when knocking so Severus knew when one of them were there versus another student or teacher. He never stopped the practice since it did no harm and he didn't need to put up occlumensy shields either.
Though he would never admit it aloud, Draco found himself agreeing with Ron. Harry must have cracked and gone officially mental. Though he was flattered Harry seemed to take any notice of his mental state, Draco couldnt assess why Potter would care enough to bother.
"She's switching sides. Pulled the mother to mother card on me. Couldn't leave her to what Voldemort would do to her if she encouraged his orders to be ignored. She agreed to tell us everything she knows and even fight of need be." Molly said defending her actions in a way that left no room to argue.
Harry came out at the designated floo for Diagon Alley. He stepped out, not wanting to be landed on should someone else come through. He really needed to figure out apparating.
Draco nodded just as Severus came back into the office, having finished his rounds of the school early, hoping to run into Harry had he been caught.
"Yes Mother. Come on Harry! I want to open your gift first!" Draco practically demanded as he led the way.
Even if Sev had served the Dark Lord in the past, why would he now after losing his mind and killing innocent people, Harrys parents included?
"Iam more than a little aware of that, but we also need to make sure we perform the ritual correctly. Even with the stone it could go wrong. He is himself as a spirit but you know what he was like before. We need his sanity to come back with him as well. Now leave, I will do my part but I'll not risk cutting corners at the risk of our Lords mind." Severous replied.
"No I'm just glad. You seem to have more energy than last time we saw you. Its kinda boring if you aren't yourself." Harry explained causing Dracos face to tint slightly pink, easy to see on his pale skin.
The outfit was a dark blue set of robes. Fairly simple in design, as children clothes often were, and they actually fit rather than just hanging off him. It somehow made him appear even smaller and yet Harry was exstatic. A brand new, never worn before, outfit just for him.
"Oh good, you are both here. Do you have everything you need? Both of you?" Severus asked, his voice was calm and soothing, as if they weren't running for Harrys life here.
"Hello Professor Snape. I'm here settling my accounts. Can't imagine what else I would be in the bank for." Harry answered, allowing his annoyance to clearly show through.
"Whats all this?" Arther asked his wife, his face pulling tight with tension. He and Lucious despised each other and if the rants about his uncivilized nature that Narcissa had to listen to her husband about was anything to go by, it was clear Arther was about as uncomfortable with her presence as Lucious likely would be if the tables were turned.
Speaking of Snape though, the man had been on his mind a lot lately. First off his whole demenor was different. He no longer sneered or talked down to him either. In fact, potions had been almost peaceful this year. For the first week it had Harry completely unbalanced as Snape hating him had been a constant that he had subconciously relied on to judge his own sanity.
Many of the children had taken Potters lead from the start of the semester and had begun to veer away from Dumbledore. She didn't even really need to do much.
Draco felt infinitely better than he had in a long time. Sure there were some kinks to his plan, but that was inevitable regardless.
The tiredness he had felt the last several days was only made worse by his lack of sleep and the very thought of eating felt like a chore.
If anyone knew that the other shoe would drop, it was Draco. Behind the portait hiding the Slytherin common room, the students of the snake pitt got a lot bolder. He was in for an interrogation and there was no way out of it if the looks of Pansy and Blaise were anything to go by.
So, off he went to the street the night of his birthday, having not received even a note from his friends, and flagged down the night bus.
Ok so, should i do a full rewrite of the whole series or should I just make this go faster. Im not really sure. Its a slow burn regardless but a full rewrite of all the books could take a while.
That was odd. If he was looking for his brothers then why was he looking for a seat. Surely hed just sit with them. That was odd.
"Get it over with Draco. You know as well as I do that avoiding Pans is far more horrible than avoiding a howler." Blaise reminded him darkly. Yes Draco knew that very well and was beyond relieved he had not been betrothed to the rather difficult young woman. Blaise had a tough one for sure.
"I have been trying to get through to both Wood and Minerva to get them to cut down on practice. Neither will hear it from me. I was going to be speaking to Madam Pomfrey tonight about it. This is entirely too unhealthy for an eleven year old boy, and I will have that drilled into their heads one way or another. There's more than inexperience keeping first years from being on the primary team for a reason." Sev informed his godson.
Umbridge had come around the corner and had laid the detention on him and when he tried to tell her the truth of what happened, she had called him a dirty, filthy liar and that she was ashamed that he would do such a thing.
"Oh, and I think he's researching something or other. He and Granger have gotten fairly close. I overheard them talking about a stone or something. If he's trying to exhaust himself, a research project on top of everything else will do it." Draco mentioned it off hand but seemed to have noticed how Sev had stiffened slightly.
"We told you you were a natural but I don't remember  saying you should go and become the new seeker. And what is your head of house thinking. You're only in your first year after all." Sev ranted to Harry who was using his office as a sanctuary.
"Harry?" Snape called to him once he was done and Harry couldn't help but flinch. Not only was Severus really scary right then, but he was still feeling the results of the quill on top of rejection sickness.
to kill Dumbledore and Harry Potter? Surely he doesn't think he'll succeed? Thats madness!" Fudge declared incredulously.
Umbridge cast a lip lock at him, keeping him from speaking about his detentions or even writing about them. Well, damn.
"That is what I was hoping you could tell me. I had gone to speak with Umbridge about another student. When I got there she was dithering about how you had gone in for detention looking unwell and had passed out when you went to leave. She said she was sending you to the hospital wings and would reschedule your detention. She was moving to unlock the door when you collapsed. I had to help bring you here. You seem fine now, other than a few scratches on your hand from the fall." Severus explained.
Anyway, my Grandfathers portrait was telling us that a veela senses its mate by aura. When one or more come into their inheritance, the sub will sense it, whether they are of age or not. In my case I have part of two creatures. My veela side is submissive, but my pheonix side is dominant. I will likely have more than one mate. That means in the heirarchy of the relationship, one mate will be my dom and the other my sub while I'm in the middle.
If he could fix it and lead the death eaters to it. There could be aurors waiting for them. The Dark Lord was banking on the final battle in order to seal his win over Dumbledore. He planned for Draco to fail his mission so obviously he could punish the Malfoy family, and his mothers betrayal wouldn't help matters. But, he could lead them into a trap.
"I don't remember anything. I was feeling fine the whole day, though now I have a slight headache.That doesn't sound like Umbridge though, but I can't remember anything." Harry looked at Severus hoping the man had some kind of answer for him.
That said, she had only used her special quill on a select few students and none had turned her in for it. It was marvelous.
So, here Harry was outside Umbridges office ten minuets early (no point in making it easy to claim he was tardy) and praying for something fairly easy. Most of the students who had had detention with the woman had claimed it was only lines so he wasn't too worried, not that he dreaded the one on one time with the crazy woman.
"Did you smell that Lucius? Potter has creature blood too. Can't tell what with the glamour but, it was so.... sweet. Like honeysuckle and mint. I will admit to distraction, but you are right. I will wait to inform Dumbledore, but you should inform the Dark Lord immediately." Severus agreed once he came back to himself.
Moving on in to Harrys pov. Hes four and i have never written in the mind set of a four year old so this will be different.
Yet with all his toys and all his books and his practice brooms and two potions kits and everything else, Dracos favorite thing in the world was to sit during tea time and have his father tell him the story of Harry Potter who vanquished the evil Voldemort as a mere infant.
That said, Charlus Potter had no other portaits and was also frozen when the manor was closed after his death. That meant the man hadn't had an active portrait since his death until Harry unlocked the manor. As such, he was woefully out of date on certain things. He had had no idea that his son and daughter-in-law were already passed. He also wasn't aware the was had ever ended. He didn't know the prominent players on the political scale anymore. So, manners and court lessons were all he could help his grandson with.
Plus is guaranteed as little loss of life as possible. No use letting magical blood to waste when it was entirely unnecessary.
Wood had worked the team harder than ever, literally daily since they didn't need to hold try outs. The other three teams were still working out replacements for the graduates of the year before and Oliver Wood was using that time to get ahead.
"I don't know anything about another project, but I will be doing something about this." Sev promised.
This was not the young man that she had done her research on. From what she could gather, Harry had always been a rude and abrasive character that never truly became a part of wizarding society, having been raised by muggles up until his birthday this summer.
"Ok then, I will be reclaiming the Potter seat, and would like, after this conversation, for all mail and such regarding my accounts to be redirected there from here on out. I will be investing on my own after a while but would like to, at present, continue with anything still active from my grandfathers time. Anything we don't cover today can be sent to my new or rather my proper home. Also, is there a glamour or something for the horns and wings until I get the hang of it myself. I notice most creatures use one." Harry added.
"I've told you I have no idea. I eat breakfast like normal, I attend all my classes, I get my homework done, I eat lunch and dinner. I practice with the team and I come here. The only time that changes is on Tuesdays and Fridays when I'm in detention with Umbridge, and all she has me do is write lines." Harry answered in a slightly annoyed tone. They had had this conversation several times before now and he couldn't fathom why they were having it again.
"And don't listen to Grandfather too much. He isn't up to date on modern styles as much as he would like to make himself believe." Harry joked, seeing his grandfather enter the portrait just outside the floo room.
Harry a little flustered by the ... Confrontation? was a little at a lack for words and just sort of went with it and nodded.
Harry took a seat and proceed to prick his finger and squeeze out the three droplets of blood onto the parchment.
He practically stopped breathing when Professor Flitwick came through the halls. He had never been caught by this particular professor before, but judging by his ability to hear muttering while in class, Harry was almost sure that the short man would hear him should he make so much as a sigh.
"Cissy, release Draco, we should let them get settled into bed. It is quite late." Lucius said, having followed his wife at a slightly more sedate pace.
He didn't have his trademark sneer or smirk either, rather a look of curiosity that made Harry believe Dracos animagus would be some form of cat. He was hunting for answers, that much was certain.
"Hello Mrs. Weasley." Harry returned the not greeting as politely as he could though he couldn't bring himself to feign a smile.
Harry turned to leave only to hear a whispered stunner. He waited for darkness to come as he didn't have time to properly react, but it never came.
Upstairs Draco took the lead, which Harry appreciated as he never had a friend before and didn't know what to do.
"What is this? What are you doing here?" Umbridge had come out of her shock, her accusitory voice reminding Harry very much of Petunia.
"Umbridge. Every student that you were complaining about suddenly being anemic, they were all because of that devil. A blood quill of all things and on students." Severus told her. He knew she would take his side.
Now, with these situations it is standard to forge a new key. Before that though we must do a bloodline test. This test will not only confirm you identity without a doubt, it will also tell us what creature you are. For this I will need you to give three drops of blood onto this parchment." Griphook laid a flat parchment across his desk and handed Harry a small pin, to prick his finger with.
"Mint, please take Severus to his usual room. Clover, if you could take young Harry to the blue guest room please. Rose, do alert Marvolo as well as the kitchen elves that our guests have arrived and that Draco is home." Narcissa delegated with skill.
Indeed, as he started, reddish brown ink flowed from the quills tip. However his writing hand was getting very itchy.
"Draco, we never followed our parents. If you're switching sides, we are too. We stick together. We follow you, not Snake Face." Blaise announced seriously.
"I have been perfectly safe at home. Now if you want to stand there and lecture air be my guest, but I am going to finish my shopping so I can return home." Harry stated in such a way as to say he was done with the entire exchange.
"But Sev, this whole thing is foolish, even for him." Draco had gotten out of the habit of calling Severus 'uncle', but refused to stop calling him Sev purely out of habit.
"Yes, I am." Severus answered with a questioning tilt in his voice. Silently asking for more details on whatever request she had.
"Why didn't you believe me?" Harry finally asked, looking up just enough to see their faces but refusing to meet their eyes.
They weren't even doing much. Just laps at ten-fifteen feet only as fast as each person was comfortable and only two flyers per height meaning 6 at a time to prevent collisions.
"Time is up. Turn in whatever sorry attempts you have made and clean up before class is over. Ten points each to Potter, Malfoy, Zabini, and Nott for completing the potion early and satisfactorily. Potter, a word after class please.
Harry gave his grandfather an exasperated look before standing and going to pack his school things in his new trunk. He wouldn't grace his grandfather with a response to his obvious question.
The incident in question was him walking Luna Lovegood to class when she was getting bullied. The girls pestering her had tripped her and Harry was helping her up.
Draco was not so lucky, his own face turning a brilliant pink that Harry had to admit was kind of adorable.
Left to her own devices until supper, Narcissa decided to write a letter to her son to explain her rash decision making, and also plead with him to fight his fears anger do what makes him happy. That she would support him no matter his choice. That she hoped with time he could escape the darkness that seemed to haunt his eyes as of late and that no matter what happened to her, he was not to give himself to despair. She would do what it takes to protect him, even if it was from himself or the expectations of Lucious and Voldemort.
"It was the unattended part I was asking about Potter." Snape sounded uncharacteristically understanding, and if Harry wasn't so bloody tired, he would likely have been more suspicious. As it was, he just narrowed his eyes in clear mistrust.
About an hour later Harry heard a knock on the front door. The cut on his arm had since stopped bleeding but it still hurt if he touched it. He tried to sleep as his Uncle went to the door. He didnt care about what was being said as it didnt involve him. Nothing ever did.
"Yeah well you tell her. I was dragged into it. Wood seems like a decent bloke though and the others on the team are pretty nice. No one is really all that bad except Ron. I just wish they weren't all so.... Loud." Harry complained setting his freshly finished potions essay aside to dry before turning to his charms homework. It was a questionnaire that Professor Flitwick apparently used to tell if his students were properly attuned with their magic. He did this within the first or last month at the beginning and end of every year.
He had hoped to discredit the boy by showing several detentions and an anger problem to show that he was lying about Voldemort as some kind of attention grab. It worked out well in his plans since it would show Dumbledore in a bad light as well; not that it was needed, the entire tournament was a political fiasco that they were still trying to clean up. The Diggory family now lived in France as political refugees with their much younger twins while mourning the loss of thier first born son, and France was very unforgiving of the use of minors in the second task while Bulgaria felt very cheated by the entire thing.
"Harry Potter." Professor McGonagall called and the room became absolutely silent. Harry knew this would happen. He was famous. They would all sit there and wonder where he was to be placed. So he walked forward.
"You attract nothing but the most horrid of luck dear grandson. And after he saved you as he did, you had no room to refuse him either. I remember Lucius of course, but he was a young lad when last I met him. It was briefly after that horrid incident your father caused. He was friends with the student your father often bullied. I met him then. Had a good head on his shoulders that one. He's probably just like his father was I bet. All aristocratic and has the kind of personality that makes you want to do as he says. His father, Abraxus was his name, was just like that. Always had to be a step ahead of me. There's been a family rivalry between us for generations. I'm sure Lucius was amused by you and his own son continuing the tradition. All in good fun of course. There's a marriage contract between the families too. If a breeder or a daughter were ever born they would marry into the other family. Problem is, neither family ever had girls after that contract was made. Abraxus used to tease me, saying it was the Potter curse at work. It's quite funny really." Charlus rambled a bit. That was odd, but it must have been his way of showing nerves.
"Im Harry Potter and this is Draco Malfoy. And no problem Hermione. It's a pleasure." Harry said nicely ignoring Dracos grimace.
at my birthday party." Draco commanded, grabbing Harry by the hand and dragging him along to begin mingling.
According to Griphook, nothing in that account should have been touched. Even his magical guardian (Dumbledore) shouldn't have been able to touch anything without his say so. That said, when they went over them, Griphook noticed that the interest wasn't right. Keeping in mind that the interest was quite a lot of gold to begin with, it seemed odd to Griphook that the percentage was wrong. Harry was grandfathered into ((pun slightly intended)) a certain percentage after so many generations. The percentage of interest was higher for Harry since the account was originally opened back in the ancient days.
“If you two aren’t making out in the next 10 seconds, one of you is losing a penis” Pansy threatened, “and don’t think I won't”
“You didn't specify how much Malfoy” Harry retorted. There was a pause, before everyone surged towards the drinks at once. Seamus, Neville, Dean, Ron, Hermione, and Parvati all took a bottle of butter beer each. Lavender and Padma took control of the vodka and cranberry juice. Conjuring glasses and mixing to make a very pink drink. Parkinson snatched a firewhiskey, as did both Zabini and Malfoy. They conjured shot glasses, Parkinson didn’t bother, seeming content with drinking straight from the bottle. Harry rolled his eyes at her, she looked at him and smirked, then held out the bottle as if offering it to him. He laughed “I think I'll pass, Parkinson, I prefer my firewhiskey without slytherin spit mixed in”
Dracos team all cheered, as he threw the snitch up and caught it again. Potter looked irritated, and was clapping sarcastically. Draco smirked at him, and waved the snitch in his direction.
thanks to my beta for helping me with this chapter, if not for her this wouldn’t have been out on time
He removed his hands from his face, he met her eyes. Harry stayed silent as they seemed to communicate with one another without saying anything.  She narrowed her eyes slightly, then walked past them and out of the common room. Draco stood up, muttered “shit” and followed her.
Harry heard Draco move behind him, covering his face in his hands and groaning into them. Now more a sound of regret than a sound of pleasure.
They all cheered, and whilst Pansy and Hermione walked back to the castle, the people who had been playing wondered towards the changing rooms, all laughing and joking with one another.
Hermione looked as if she had many more questions but Draco cut off her train of thought by turning to the brown haired boy sitting next to her “Potter, truth or dare?”
“Join us” he motioned at Pansy and Blaise. Blaise waved, a smirk playing at his lips. Pansy just smiled, she looked much too happy.
“I should leave you here, tie you to this chair so that when everyone comes down in the morning they can see what a slut Malfoy is”
He stood outside the common room for a couple of seconds, attempting to catch his breath so it wasn't obvious he had sprinted back. And then walked in, levitating the makeshift bag in front of him. The look on Malfoy's face when Harry dropped the bag was incredible. The tablecloth unfolded in front of them revealing 3 bottles of firewhiskey, 12 butterbeers, and two bottles of muggle drinks. Vodka and cranberry juice.
in the time that Draco had been in his head, Potter had obviously picked Blaise to ask next, as everyone had their eyes trained on him.
Draco knew this would get Potter to move. Forfeiting meant he would win. And Potter was unlikely to let that happen without a fight. He stood up and left.
Blaise walked in, a towel wrapped around his waist. He looked at Pansy and pointed at the door, she threw herself back on the bed and covered her eyes.
He woke up in a cold sweat, his arms shaking as he tried to clear his head of the memory of the dream. Draco wasn’t dead. it was just a dream.
“ready for what?” Blaises voice called out from his mountain of pillows he has surrounded himself in.
He tried to look nonchalant. Then shrugged “walked in on Potter in the quidditch showers.” This wasn’t wholly untrue, technically Potter had walked into his shower, but no matter. The truth spell allowed it.
“I’m sorry, Harry” she said, between giggles “but your face, I just-” she cut herself off again, unable to keep talking. Pansy nudged Draco, and muttered “sweetie you’re practically drooling”
He chose a green velvet chair that was seated near the fire and sat down, flicking his wand to light the fire. he took out the map and whispered “i solemnly swear that i am up to no good”
He didn't like Potter. He just hadn't been fucked in way too long. It wasnt his fault Potter was built like a fucking god, or kissed like a god, or fitted into his robes like a god. Fuck. Draco needed to stop thinking about him.
Everyone nodded, though Potter looked warily at the shot glass he had just drunk from. Draco caught his eye, and raised an eyebrow in question. He just looked away.
Harry cast a tempus. it was 3:30am. Too early to get up, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep again. He sighed to himself and got out of his bed as quietly as he could, not wanting to wake up Ron who was only a few meters away. He grabbed his glasses and the marauders map before making his way down to the common room.
Draco had decided to never leave his dorm ever again, which had seemed like a great plan until Pansy had barged in and dragged him out, demanding he go to potions. Draco thought she just wanted to see him suffer, he told her this and she just smiled.
but they didn't listen, as soon as Ernie stopped running and looked slightly more calm, all three of the slytherins sent spells in complete synchronicity. Each one hit Ernie with such a force that he fell over, they seemed pleased with this as they turned back to the group. Their faces changed drastically from murderous to pleased. Harry had to admit that was impressive.
Pansy looked so happy. Draco had to immediately pull his mind away from the image that had decided to firmly plant itself in his brain. Don't think about Potter in the shower. Don't think about Potter in the shower. Don't think about Potter in the shower. It didn't work. Draco blushed and forced himself to not openly stare at him. There was a silence as everyone stared at Potter, not knowing what to say.
That week, Malfoy caught Harry's eye in the hall so many times, Harry thought he must be doing it on purpose. Trying to get his attention. Everywhere he looked, there was Malfoy, reading, studying, brewing a potion, or even napping on the sofa in the common room. That put Harry on edge, the fact that he was comfortable enough to sleep in the common room, surrounded by dozens of his classmates. Harry knew he would never be able to do that, he had problems sleeping as it is, he still got nightmares, and knew that it would be his luck to wake up screaming in the common room. His classmates all thought he was at least a bit normal at the moment, he wanted to keep it that way. Though Ron had been acting weird around him since saturday, he kept asking harry if he was gay (which he was not), and if he was in love with Malfoy (which he was not). It wasn't Harry's fault that Malfoy was good at kissing, okay? Hermione had been acting strange too, as if she knew something that Harry didn’t. He caught her looking at him with bemusement in her eyes everytime he was watching Malfoy, she probably thought Harry liked him too.
He leaned down and whispered into the blonde boys ear “or i could fuck you so hard and loud, that everyone in their common rooms can hear how you’re my whore”
He didn't know how long he had left, but he knew it probably wasn't long enough. He ran as fast as he dared to whilst still levitating the bottles in front of him. He made it outside the common room in what he thought was probably a record. If they had records for running through corridors levitating various bottles of alcohol. He doubted it.
Grangers outburst had broken the awkward silence, Hannah and longbottom were both blushing, Granger was still looking at Potter’s bright red face and laughing, along with Lavender, Padma, Finnegan, and Thomas, Parvati was giggling at Weasley, who was looking at Harry with part guilt, and part embarrassment. Potter had his head in his hands, and was mildly shaking his head. Blaise was watching him, with a smirk on his lips.
“shut up” Draco said, but he grabbed them nevertheless, “I’m changing now” Draco pointed around the door. Pansy ignored him and draped her arm across her eyes, “I’m not leaving”
Harry slid down the wall of the classroom, sitting down against it. He was angry, confused and still hard. He couldn’t be hard for Draco Malfoy. But, fuck, he was. He pointed his wand at the door and locked it, there was no way he could go to class like this. He pushed down his trousers and squeezed himself, trying to relieve some of the pressure.
And that was why Draco was sat next to Pansy, at the back of their potions classroom when Harry fucking Potter walks in, completely confidently. his neck absolutely covered in hickeys. Draco turned bright red and looked away, deliberately avoiding eye contact with everyone, especially Pansy, who Draco knew was staring wide eyed between him and Potter.
He shot a look of defiance at Pansy. Stood up and began to walk over, the three of them all immediately tried to look like they hadn't been staring at him.
“Potter’s playing seeker” She smirked when Draco immediately sat back up again, he got out of bed and walked towards the door.
“Sure” he looked bemused. She pointed her wand at the sky, and shouted a spell that Draco hadn’t heard before. Suddenly he could see a lot easier, the rain was still tipping it down, but it was warm and not too uncomfortable.
Harry felt in control, and he liked it. Draco Malfoy was practically whining under his touch, keening at every caress of his hands. Harry smirked when Draco bit back a moan as he pushed his leg in between the blonde boy’s. Harry kissed him again, his tongue controlling the kiss. His hands found the small of Draco’s back and stayed there. He then pulled himself away, took a single step back and dropped his towel. He heard Malfoy inhale quickly,
the boys run into one another in the common room after both waking up from nightmares, ill let you figure out what happens nesxt
Pansy threw herself back onto the bed, her arms above her head “getting you guys up is basically 50% of how I spend my time”
Unfortunately, Ernie Macmillan was walking past at the time and was stupid enough to mutter “slut” under his breath.
He moaned into Harry's ear. He was sure he would never tire of hearing that sound. He twisted his hand and sped up, Draco was now panting softly, his breath hot and his eyes fluttering shut.
“dreamt that he and Potter had met in the quidditch changing rooms, and Potter shagged him up against the lockers”
“I lost a bet” Maloy glared at Zabini “Blaise would’ve turned up to Transfiguration in a maids dress if I had won”
It quickly changed to more, Harry had enough time to think ‘I shouldn’t be doing this’ before he pulled Malfoy onto his lap, placing his arms around his waist. Malfoy had the height advantage, as he was on his knees either side of Harry’s legs, so he pulled on the slytherin tie around his neck, pulling Harry’s mouth closer. His tongue entered Harry's mouth quickly. Time seemed to stop. He could think of nothing apart from Malfoy, the smell of him, the feel of him, everything that was making Harry crazy. His whole body felt hotter, a heat that seemed to start in his stomach and spread slowly out. He was aware of Malfoy’s hands moving along his shoulders and one behind his head, threading into his hair. Malfoy suddenly broke the kiss, and began to attack his throat and chest, sucking and licking everywhere he could reach. It was when he paired this with one hand stroking his hair that Harry moaned, and pulled Malfoy’s mouth back up to his.
When Draco walked into the common room, the others were already sitting in a circle. It was everyone who had been playing last week plus Daphne (who sat next to Pansy) and Theo (who sat next to Blaise).
He sped up his hand, moving his mouth to Draco’s chest and taking one of his nipples in his mouth, moving his tongue in slow circles around it. Draco groaned “god, Potter, please”, as he attempted to thrust his hips forward. But he pushed Draco’s hips back against the wall with one hand.
Draco forgot how to breathe, he gasped out a “fuck” as Harry walked under the spray of the shower and kissed him.
“Is it true you were the one who stole Pansy’s lipstick in 5th year, because you were upset she made out with Theo”
“Hey Draco,” Pansy called from the stand “I can see your nipples”. Draco stopped and looked down, then swore. His white shirt had turned see-through due to the rain. He blushed and glared at Pansy. She just smirked.
They all mounted their brooms, and flew back into the air. Draco began to circle the pitch again, scanning the pitch for the Snitch. Draco looked over to where Lavender and Daphne were sat, they were both staring at him and Lavender was doubled over with laughter. Daphne was attempting to keep lavender on her broom, whilst giggling.
It wasn’t long before he came, he went to pull off, but Draco swallowed deeper determinedly. This act pushed Harry over the edge as he came down the back of Draco’s throat.
“No,'' Harry replied calmly, “this is mean '' He flicked a hand towards where Dracos wrists were, and Draco found he couldn't move them from where Harry had held them.
Draco gasped and then moaned, louder than before as he immediately thrust his hips up to get further into Harry's mouth.
“we’re playing never have I ever this time, potty” Pansy supplied. The same look that had crossed Draco’s face when he had heard this crossed Harrys. it passed quickly. “alright”, he sat down.
Harry stepped back, admiring Draco. Who was looking at Harry, with a mixture of hatred, lust, and admiration.
He began to draw on seamus’ face, first a moustache, and then began expanding. He drew a penis along his forehead and a snail on his cheek.
Malfoy stood up from the chair he had sat in and walked to squat in front of the fire, he had goose bumps down his arms.
“Fuck you Malfoy,” he cursed under his breath. The image of Draco naked and wanking immediately popped up in his mind. And although he tried he just couldn’t help it. He moaned a little.
“Okay ladies, normal slytherin rules apply, take the shot” they all did “now you can't lie, nothing is off limits with questions or dares and if you won't answer a question or do a dare, you forfeit from the game. Everyone agree to the rules?”
Rons mouth dropped open, it would’ve been comical if Harry wasn’t three seconds away from avada kedavra-ing himself.
“okay, now whenever someone says never have I ever blah blah blah, you must take a shot if you’ve done it”
Draco had no reply. Lust filled his eyes, and he dropped to his knees. Hitting the floor with a splash. This simple movement made all of the blood in Harry's body rush to his cock.
“Blaise I warn you, I’m good at that spell don't try me”. Blaise just smiled gleefully and raised his voice
Malfoy kissed him with the same vigour as before, pushing his weight against Harry with the force of the kiss. Harry lost himself momentarily, which was all it took for them both to fall backwards, as Harry lost his balance, he pulled Malfoy with him.
“we’re going to be late to potions,” Hermione's voice joined him. Harry didn’t reply and just opened the door, a towel wrapped around his waist.
He nodded silently, Harry pointed at the fire with his hand, it expanded and more heat washed over them.
“Oh Draco, that wouldn’t have stopped me from dragging you down here. Potter would explode if I did that”
Potter locked eyes with Draco, “yes”. He didn’t even blush, Draco raised a single eyebrow at him. But was met with only Harry's gase, heated and full of lust.
Harry smirked at Draco. Which Draco didn't expect, this was a difficult dare, especially with a time limit. He didn't move.
Neither said anything, Dracos heavy breaths were the only sounds that broke the silence of the common room.
“Alright boys” Pansy started “normal slytherin rules” she conjured three shot glasses and filled them with firewhiskey and added a single drop of veritaserum to each one “shot” she commanded. They all drank. Blaise began to cough, Pansy smirked.
He didn't respond, but moved his hand down towards his cock. Harry stopped him, smirking. He pinned Dracos hands above his head again.
Draco thrust his hips up suddenly into Harry's hand, his soft moans sped up and his stomach muscles tensed slightly. Harry moved his hand away immediately. A loud whine left Dracos mouth, “what the fuck, Potter”.
“Very well, Harry Potter, but you must not get ill. Winky would feel awful if something happened to Harry Potter and it was her fault”
“so what if I did this?” Draco questioned, before moving his leg between Harrys, his thigh brushing against his crotch. Potter froze.
quidditch gets heated, draco and Harry have a “chat” in the showers before pansy starts round three of truth or dare
“Caught having sex in the forbidden forest” Blaise finished loudly, as if draco had not interrupted.
He lowered his voice, “you were using your advantage the moment you stepped onto the pitch wearing those god damned jeans”
Pansy looked much too excited as they walked over and sat down, in the middle of the circle were two bottles of firewhiskey, and three bottles of butterbeer. Around the circle, Potter, Weasley, Finnegan, Thomas, Granger and Padma each had a bottle of butterbeer in their hands. Lavender, Parvati, Hannah, and Longbottom each had a can of something called ‘Pimms’, Draco assumed this was a muggle drink. He shrugged as he reached towards one of the bottles of firewhiskey. Pansy conjured 13 shot glasses and filled them, firewhiskey with a drop of veritaserum. She floated them over to everyone, who each drank, and then violently coughed after. Draco smirked as he drank without even making a face, he learned to do that in 6th year.  Doing shots in the slytherin dorm room around Pansy, you couldn’t show weakness.
“Hermione Granger, obviously, she kept going on about inter house unity. I like her a lot more when she’s a little bit drunk”
Harry wasnt gay. It wasn't his fault that was his dare, it wasn’t like he could’ve forfeited, then Malfoy would’ve won. Everything was a competition between them, it was stupid, but that didnt mean Harry was going to let Malfoy win
Harry moved closer to him in the shower, the towel that was wrapped around his waist entering the spray of the shower.
“Draco” Pansy sounded more serious, though she still looked incredibly pleased “Potter is going to kill you”
“Go on” Pansy prompted, her eyes sparkling with mirth as she looked back and force between Weasley and Potter.
Draco couldn't stop thinking about Potter. How he had tasted, how he had kissed him with such force, how he had kissed him with such fucking skill. God Draco hated how good he was at kissing. He had seen Potter looking at him since Saturday, his eyes following him through the corridors, even in the common room. He was always watching him, he wouldn't admit it, but he liked the attention. He kept thinking that Potter would be good at other things with his tongue, apart from kissing, it was when he started thinking about Potter when he was in the shower that he knew he had a problem. He turned the shower cold. Fuck, Draco seriously needed to get laid.
Harry moved down, he pushed Dracos knees apart with his hands and settled on his own knees in between them, Draco stared down at him with lust filled eyes. Harry wasted no time in freeing Dracos, now leaking cock, and taking it all into his mouth in one swift movement.
Draco was bored. He had been studying for his NEWTS for what seemed like hours, although in reality was probably less than an hour. He was sitting at a desk in the eighth year common room, Pansy was lying on a desk a couple meters away from him. Very obviously not studying, Blaise was sitting next to her, surrounded by books and random bits of parchment. The three slytherins always sat together in the common room, it was familiar. Changing from house common rooms to all the eighth years lumped together was a difficult change. Some students were more happy with it than others. Draco didn't particularly mind, but some of the Griffindors had made their thoughts about the matter very clear, for the first couple weeks Draco had to put up with mild stinging jinxes hitting him whenever he was sitting reading in the common room, or walking to lessons. Needless to say, Draco had gotten incredibly good at shielding charms. And holding pansy back when she threatened to kill anyone that messed with them.
He motioned to Weasley, “come on” he motioned towards the two people sitting on the floor. Granger stood up “alright, for the interest of inter house unity” Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry rushed past them both and into his and Ron’s shared room, pulled on the highest necked t-shirt he owned, which was not high enough as you could still see way too much, and a pair of jeans. He never bothered to wear his actual robes to class anymore, and the eighth years weren’t required to wear school uniform seeing as they were only in some lessons- most of their time was spent revising. He grabbed his bag, which contained his potions books and quills and parchment, and then walked out to meet Hermione and Ron, so they could walk to potions together.
Still both adults were pleased when the young lord obediently sipped at the broth he had been given and then dutifully knocked back the healing potion.
"You do. You actually think I would lie to you. You both actually think so low of me. Well, if it's a matter of trust then fine. Don't trust me. But don't think I'll be back here." Harry turned to grab his bag.
Harry paled a bit, but nodded resolutely. The last encounter he had with a certain Dark Lord running on repeat in his mind. Of course there was no portkey to get out of danger with should this whole thing go belly up.
So this story is gaining a good bit more attention than I ever thought possible when it decided to pop itself in my head. I can not thank you guys enough for all the kind comments. It's really motivating.
"I don't know what to do Lucius. I've never had to take care of someone before. I don't know what I am doing." Severus said, hoping for some kind of wisdom from his long time friend.
Suddenly there was a popping sound, and a short creature with big eyes and bigger ears appeared. Harry decidedly hid behind Mr. Snape.
The speed at which Harry was going was exhilarating. He smiled as he flew by at top speed. He easily caught the glass ball before it slammed into a glass window. Harry was genuinely happy as he realized what he'd accomplished.
So what's it like being famous? What was it like when you found out you defeated the dark lord as a mere baby? Are you excited about Hogwarts? What house are you thinking you'll be in?
Soon it was time for bed though. Harry had eaten more than he thought was possible and was tired. Besides apparently there was shopping to do tomorrow.
Harry really needed a publicist though because a lot of the people who did write back to his responses often commented that he sounded far more mature than they had expected after reading the news about him. They were for the most part pleased but shocked anyway.
Was she serious? Here? In front of the entire alley? She was going to do this here? He wasn't even her child to chastise.
Harry made his way casually to the apparition and floo room. The room was lavish, but simple. It was designed with the purpose in mind. No carpets because of unavoidable soot, and enough space for several people to pop in without squishing or landing on top of each other. There was a coat rack that currently only held Harrys travel cloak, and a chiming clock above the large fireplace that could easily fit three or four people in it comfortably.
Problem was, he had no idea what was wrong. He had even gone to see Madam Pomphrey, but other than being anemic and having a gash on his hand that refused to heal, she couldn't tell what was wrong with him either. Though she mentioned being worried about him suddenly being anemic, there wasn't much she could do other than give him some blood replenishing potions and send him on his way.
Sorry for the wait guys, work has been a test in my patience with humanity lately and by the time I leave for the day it is either late or I'm too done with life to bother trying  to write.
"If you could do me one favor. Make sure that pink toad faced swine ends up as his new favorite plaything." The nurse answered darkly. For her to threaten violence could only mean one thing.
"I will use your floo if you don't mind. It would be faster." Severus said as he grabbed the floo powder and left. He traveled to the Leaky in diagon alley and then apperated from behind the building.
Fiddling at the delicate strap on his wrist, Draco trailed quietly behind Jacques after shutting the door to their room. The silence felt heavy and it weighed on his shoulders.
“Shut up,” Draco clenched his fists, brows furrowed in offense. “how can you say that? Every single day, in these last five years are little mistakes born from the biggest one I've made all those years ago. Wanting to be with you is not a mistake,” his voice threatened to break. “this is me finally trying to do what's right,” he inhaled shakily before swallowing. “even if it's just for tonight and I'd have to go on the next morning to continue making mistakes. I don't care if I have to take your cock up my ass with his ring on my finger. I don't care if that's
. . .” Harry's thrusts stuttered to a slower rhythm as he chased his own orgasm. Then with a bite down his lower lip and a long groan, he came and spilled inside Draco, his arms going to wrap around Draco's waist.
And what a lovely cock it was. When Draco saw what Harry had always been packing in there, he almost didn't believe it would fit, the girth and length intimidated him. Just another thing Harry had that Jacques didn't, he counted. Draco found it wasn't very difficult to compare the two of them, it was as clear as a summer day that Harry was good at everything Jacques wasn't.
Draco made a startled noise, his cheeks burning so hot it felt like he was smoking from his ears. He stammered, “p-probably? Definitely! Don't change the subject!”
“Jesus. . .” he squeezed his eyes shut, feeling at the soft skin underneath. Draco wore lingerie. Most likely more often than he knew. Harry didn't know what to do with that information aside from coming in his pants like a teenager. He bit Draco's already swollen-red lips open, licking into his tongue.
“When you leave, you know very well he's not going to stand by without twisting the story for everyone to think you were the problem.” he continued after seeing the bemused furrow on Draco's brows.
, open — touched myself earlier,” he panted and tried to squeeze his legs shut before he remembered Harry was in between them.  “just. . . Please — with your mouth, I need it.”
And so Harry did. Bracing his arms on either side of Draco, placing Draco's calves on his shoulders then digging his knees on the sheets. He rocked his hips forward in vigorous thrusts. Countering Draco's gasps of delight with his own grunts as he pounded into his tight heat. Draco looked delicious like this, flushed and writhing underneath him, back arching wantonly, a thin layer of sweat causing his skin to shine.
How did Harry Potter end up staying a night over his house? Oh, right. His beloved husband had a penchant for sucking up to influencial people. Although in regards to exactly how he had managed to capture Harry Potter's interest in networking, he had no idea. All he knew was that he came home to his husband and Potter having a hearty chat about
All thought of Jacques were thrown out the window once Harry's hand made its way to his belly and pressed down at the protrusion his cock made.  Draco let his legs fall apart as he came abruptly with a particularly loud cry of Harry's name, coming long and hard.
“Oh, I don't know, Death Eater scum? Filth? Damaged goods? A whore? A broken fuck toy?” he snapped, tempted to list every degrading name Jacques has called him over the years and has come to accept.
There was a flicker of emotion in his eyes, but it was gone too soon before he could discern it. Draco would've paid a fortune to see that smug grin wiped off his face but it never did, much to his annoyance.
He put the empty glass down, the sound of glass against marble drowned out by his harsh breathing and the blood rushing in his ears.
No, really. His vision begun to spin and double. He blinked as the realization dawned on him. After setting his cup down, he stood up, bracing himself on the table trying hard not to fall over.
The question startled a laugh out of Draco. He placed a hand over his mouth in disbelief. “Amazing. Thank you,” he sighed, his hand then coming up to tread through Harry's ink coloured locks. “I haven't orgasmed that hard in so long.” he joked.
He didn't know exactly when it happened but Draco's shirt was already gone by the time Harry tucked his face into Draco's neck, paying special attention to a spot under his jaw. There was a couple seconds of silence before Harry pushed in abruptly, forcing out a strangled cry from Draco before he felt sharp nails dig into his back as he continued to move in slow, careful thrusts. Harry nosed Draco's cheek, whispering in his ear.
“I'm sorry if I find it hard to believe that you can stand a man like Jacques. And marry him, much less,” he drawled, crossing his arms on his chest. “I have a feeling he exhausted all of his competency in doing business. I doubt he's good at anything else.”
Merlin, how had he ended up like this? Oh, yes. After the war, he vividly remembered clinging to the nearest rich man who was willing to take him despite his past. Married someone he had never loved, mindlessly hoping he'd learn to do so in the long run — never did. Was only made to fuck in the night disregarding whether he even wanted to, or
Harry looked enraged, he half expected Harry to stun him and leave him there helpless for hours like
“Did you just come untouched?” Harry licked his lips in amusement. Draco covered his face. Harry chuckled. “don't feel embarrassed. I find it incredibly hot that you're so sensitive,” Harry removed Draco's knickers all the way and dropped them to the floor. He began rocking their hips together. “Do you think you can come again?” a pleased smile crept on Harry's lips when he saw Draco harden once more.
Once Harry pulled out he flipped face down beside him, intertwined his fingers with Draco's. He shifted closer and half draped himself on top of Draco. There was a short moment of silence and post-coital bliss between them, Harry pressing kisses on his neck to his shoulder.
“I'm not going to stop you. If that's what you want to do,” Draco took a gasping breath when Harry decided to crowd him against the counter, as if cornering him metaphorically wasn't enough for him. He clutched at Harry's shirt. “I can pretend to be clueless for you. But Draco. . . I want you to know that you don't have to live hiding from him.”
Harry pulled off, reluctant but Draco could see the glint of arousal in those green eyes. “I want to. Terribly. God, you're so beautiful,” he licked his lips. “and I'd worship you so good. But I don't know if this is a mistake you're willing to look past, Draco.”
But who would've thought Harry Potter would ever catch him having a mental breakdown on a sink once again.
He could leave and he could do it now. Pack up quietly and leave without a notice. Get out of England. Hide. He could do it now and nobody would know. He would be painted the villain in someone else's story once again. But he couldn't bring himself to care.
“W-what do you mean?” he thought he ought to have said something smarter, but his mind had been rendered fuzzy from the kiss and he wanted more, his eyes kept following the movement of Harry's lips and how the man kept squeezing at his sides.
“Because,” he drawled, taking a step closer. Draco resisted the urge to lean in and take greedy gulps of that alluring scent. “a week is more than enough for me to earn his trust, become his best mate, and loosen his tongue with alcohol.” he pushed his hair from his face, shaking his head. “God, the amount of shite he spouts. Especially about his own
over some of his expensive wine. He dreaded to know what they had been talking about before he arrived and what could have been so amusing about Draco that made Harry wear the ear-to-ear grin that he hasn't seen for so long.
“I — Harry. . .” he leaned in and pressed another kiss to his lips. Harry held his face in his palms.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I wasn't done yet, you knew that,” he huffed and there was a small, knowing smirk on his lips. “let me rephrase that. You're troubled because of how your life ended up. By marrying this man you've come to hate over the years.”
“I meant,” Harry said. “that I never forgot about how you disappeared without a trace after graduation, when you kissed the life out of me for the last time. I was hurt. I thought what we had, no matter how little it was, meant something big to you as it did with me,” he sighed. “I never heard from you again. The Prophet stopped writing about your family and everyone brushed me off whenever I asked about you. You know, I was planning on properly dating you once we were out of school. Then I thought, maybe you were just being a prick, and when you finally succeeded in getting back at me by letting me make a fool of myself, you left. I felt stupid.”
But he knew it could never be, he reflected, staring blankly at the sleeping figure next to him. Could never bring himself to. The silver band began to feel too tight around his finger as he fell deeper into regret.
the reason —” he managed to bite his tongue, though judging from the expression on Harry's face, he knew exactly what Draco was going to say. “You've known him for how long? A week? How can you be so certain he's not a good husband?”
Draco all but squeaked, seemingly embarrassed and Harry grinned. He peeled Draco's knickers away, leaving them suspended on his knees. Then, he put his mouth on Draco's leaking cock, relishing at the soft cry he made when Harry didn't waste any second in devouring him, licking at the precome that dribbled endlessly. His cheeks hollowed as he sucked him off until Draco's thighs trembled on either sides of his face.
“Shut up. Stop talking shit. You're beginning to annoy me.” he sniffed, further proving Harry's point.
Then he ran out of the kitchen, stumbled his way up the stairs and into the bedroom where he locked himself in the closet. He knew Jacques was going to follow soon and catch him in his weakest and worst moment. Clutching the bag he packed close to him, he searched for his wand. His breathing was harsh in his ears, vision dimming around the edges. Though it wasn't the potion slipped in his tea but realization that Jacques took his wand.
Draco preened at the praise and shivered, feeling oversensitive. He felt his eyelids flutter close as he sighed. Harry shouldn't talk, looking like that above Draco. All lean, strong muscles, broad shoulders and dark skin. He was a god, blessing Draco with all the passion in the world, sending him more and more to the edge — by hitting his prostate dead on with every thrust of his cock.
Harry nodded and rasped out. “Okay.” then he parted Draco's cheeks with his hands and licked at the middle. Draco keened in surprise and gripped his hair tightly in one hand, while Harry expertly prodded at his hole using his tongue. Draco's hips lifted up, his heels going to dig at Harry's shoulder blades. Harry kneaded at his thighs.
Harry had the audacity to look sheepish as he pulled away briefly, “sorry about your wards, might've broken some of them,” he apologized while sounding the least bit apologetic, looking off the side for a second before a shirt zoomed into his hand and gave it to Draco, as if his broken wards were considered a less important matter. “can you wear this? For me?”
Harry raised a brow. “How mature. I'm sad to see your quick wit has dwindled over the years. Must be the effect of being with Jacques.”
If there was one thing Jacques was especially horrendous at, it was sex. He couldn't recall ever feeling this good with Jacques.
Draco nodded. “Yes, please, I want to — fuck, it feels so good.” his face was flushed red as he pleaded. “can you please put your cock in me now?”
Draco didn't want to start crying again, so he pulled Harry in for another kiss. Greedily breathing him in as if he was going to disappear into thin air soon and leave him alone the in confines of this godforsaken house. As if he was nothing more than a mirage, a fantasy Draco managed to create in his head. He never wanted to be separated from him again.
he thought as he dragged Harry closer by hooking his arms around to back of his neck and crashed their lips together. Harry's response was immediate and eager by licking Draco's lips open before securing his arms around his waist. Draco tangled his fingers in Harry's hair, a series of needy whimpers escaping his lips when Harry's sturdy form pressed closer against him.
Any of the clever retorts Draco had prepared died on his lips, apprehension filled his stomach and rage begun to climb its way up his throat. “Even after all these years, you're still full of shit, Potter,” he spat, mad at how easily Harry had read him after less than a day at his house. How quick he'd discovered that Draco was miserable. “I love Jacques,” the lie tasted bitter on his tongue. “just because you had a miserable marriage doesn't mean everyone else does.”
Draco was guilty of forgetting. All these years, Harry had remembered him and every little thing they did at the short time they were gifted with during eighth-year. The fleeting touches, stolen gazes, hidden smiles and tender kisses — it all came back to him.
Especially the longer he stared down at him as he writhed underneath him, hips frantically rolling up desperate for the hot friction between them.
“Wait. . . what the fuck,” he panted out, kneading Harry's arms in his hand when he began attacking his neck right after his lips. “how did you just apparate us inside the house.”
It had been a few hours after Harry left on his own Portkey and Jacques went to see him off. Draco didn't stick around to watch him go, claiming he had prior engagement and mainly stayed in his closet packing up his clothes and crying.
"An old friend o Dumbledore. He's famous he is. Invented the Sorcerors Stone and lived longer than any other wizard since Merlin imself...... I shouldnta told you that." Hagrid said hastily.
Ron, who Hermione wanted to hex at this point, was again berating Harry about how Malfoys been lying when he said hed switched sides. Quite loudly. Harry seemed lost in thought and wasn't paying much mind.
"By the way Potter, the wardrobe update is much approved. You look good in green." Draco said as he left to follow his father.
"So, we should be friends." Draco stood in front of Harry, arms crossed with a decided look on his face.
That had to end, but who else could he appoint. His first thought was Remus or his godfather, but Remus was a werewolf and they were not permitted inside unless on trial. Sirius couldn't either since he was on the run. The Weasleys had lost their seat after the flying car incident (thus the howler in second year), but they used Dumbledore as a proxy before that anyway and would be counterproductive. Harry would need to figure out where the other members sat as far as views and see if any like minded individuals would mind acting as his proxy until he graduated and then take up the mantle officially after that.
Sure it seemed silly, and Harry had no real experience with public intoxication, but Vernon could get brutal when on the sauce so to speak.
Still, he felt like a bloody genius and the work he put into this nonsense that had somehow become his life made him feel extremely proud. He actually didn't feel like he suddenly needed his fathers approval. No, finally he knew what independence felt like and he would sell his very soul to keep it. That didn't mean he wanted his father dead though. No. His father also had a part to play in this little plan.
Harrys bedroom was for starters an actual room. It wasnt huge but it was plenty of space for Harry to grow into.
The headmaster had a long white beard and longer white hair, and he wore brightly colored robes. He gazed down at the new students through half moon specticals and he had this look about him that seemed too contemplative. The man seemed detatched almost.
Sure it had taken a few months to collect them but it was better than any of Dumbledors 'lessons' which after figuring out what was going on, Harry had promptly quit attending. No need to waste his time on a manipulative old fool, when he had better things to do. Hermione had been an immense help with researching ways to destroy them also. Having made use of the room of requirement, which funny enough, connected to Salazar Slytherins private library down in the Chamber of Secrets. It worked in Harrys favor since he had no desire to try sneaking Hermione in and out of the creepy place over and over. Plus it was far to conspicuous.
"Just had to get it in about my manners. I am sorry by the way. I should have made more of an effort to learn how this world works, rather than assume it is the same as in the muggle world. That was my mistake. And now, I fear, I am paying for it." Harry said genuinely. He wanted, for some reason, for this man to understand him.
And for the first time, Harry kind of missed his old friends. He almost wished he could go back and forget about everything he had learned. Puppets don't feel pain like this after all.
"Severus what on.... Lay him here! What on Earth has happened?" Madam Pomphrey quickly got to work scanning the still shaking young man.
Indeed the day seemed to both crawl and move too quickly. He dreaded the detention that was to come tonight, and he was sure that Umbridge was going to send him back to the hospital wing as she always seemed to.
In fact, Harry had pointed out to her that with his grades going up and his behavior fine tuned, that the removal of points was an abuse of power since all Dumbledore wanted was to control him and as his head of house she should be ashamed of herself for allowing it.
"Yes, master. All will be as you say when you return. We will bring the manor back to its former glory." Mifty answered.
completing that marriage contract, I also know that the rivalry between Harry and Draco was not in good graces. And as for Severus, well, after your sons actions he has been hostile with Harry. While it may be a part he is playing, I doubt Harry will let those things go. Theres not a lot of good history between the three." Lucius may as well have been reading Harrys mind. Wait....
Narcissa is a beautiful character when given half the chance. Her experiences and expectations growing up were always something I thought shaped her. But she's also an intellegent and cunning person herself. I wanted to delve a bit into what that meant for her growing up and how that turned her into the woman she became. What would happen if after so long she finally let's go of everything she was forced to believe was important and just let her instincts and natural intelligence guide her, rather than her parents and husband.
"I will warn you though. The Dark Lord is temporarily residing there until his own manor is repaired. He knows you are coming tonight as I've told both him and Lucius. He will want to speak with you, but that will wait until you are settled. I only want you aware. Do you understand?" Severus asked after he explained.
He followed Clover to the guest room he had been assigned. The room was beautiful and true to its name, was decorated mostly in blues, accented luxuriously with gold and white.
"I don't know what to do. He's too shy to tell Wood he's over doing it, but no one has seen him in over a week. He's already shut up in the Gryffindor common room as soon as dinner is over most days." Draco explained. Looks like it was worse than Severus had thought.
If this was the first day of the year, then the rest was sure to be an absolute mess. Ugh. He was already tired.
"Thats of course fine, but I should still tidy up Snape estate and just move us there. The house I'm in now is too small to add a child anyway. I can keep my potions work where it is and Harry will be closer to the manor that way regardless. Merlin knows I would never anger your wife." Severous agreed readily.
"Well thanks again Harry. And you too Draco. Enjoy the trip." She said before leaving, presumably to return to toad in her hands to the poor sod who lost it.
"I'm a hybrid between pheonix and dark veela. When I was emancipated, magic sought to give me my creature inheritance as well." Harry answered flaberghasted. Who knew, Malfoy Senior was such a gossip.
Lucious couldn't understand most of the drivel that he heard but a mans voice calling a small child a freak and sounds of things smashing were disturbing enough. A door slammed from inside near enough to the door that the next sentence could be heard quite clearly.
So it took me a while to devise probably the most ridiculous reason to throw Harry in detention with Umbritches, and by ridiculous I mean I may have made it stretch a bit because I couldn't think of anything else. I'm sorry I tried.
For so few words, it was a lot to take in. So, he was a phoenix/ dark veela hybrid. Somehow, that made sense with what he could observe at the moment. The wings made so much more sense now.
"If all goes well I won't need to. Tred carefully Lucious. I'm sure it will all work out." Cornelius didn't really believe that last part but he didn't really need to. It was a false hope and they both knew it.
"There is. We sell them for a small fee of 2 galleons. Here, the glamour is in the stone." Griphook handed Harry a gold pendant with a brilliant blue stone. It was simple enough and could easily be hidden under his shirt.
Back to the wizengamot issue, Harrison, you'd be hard pressed to find a better proxy. Even as a youth, Lucius had a good eye for politics. Plus it gets the vote out of Dumbledors hands and balances the two sides." Charlus said addressing his grandson again.
"Don't know. Haven't had time to really process whats happened. That aside I do most of what I've done lately to protect Mother. If shes gone and freed herself, then it kind of leaves me in limbo regarding the orders I was given. It is more than a little confusing." Draco admitted, not sure why he felt compelled to do so when he hadn't really decided what he was to do yet.
"'Both of your godsons' sir? You'll protect me?" Harry was sure he looked extremely vulnerable at that moment, but he was also aware that this man was his elder mate and if he couldn't be vulnerable for him then when could he.
"M...Mated! You're my mate. Oh, for Merlins sake, we can't do things easy can we. I'll need to process this, our instincts likely won't kick in until whoever the third is. So, as long as all three of us don't acknowledge it for now, I think it will be fine until I turn seventeen when my inheritance comes." Draco didn't really say much else as he grabbed his things and practically fled the compartment, not even bothering to close the door.
"So, what, you think I'm a liar too do you? You don't think I would tell you what was wrong if I knew? That I wouldn't tell my mates what would help me? You really think that little of me?" Harry was obviously angry and was more than a bit hurt by the assumption.
"Not a clue. Safehouse of some kind, I'd wager. I was sent on the train with the Wealeys and Potter before Mother was told where it was. Thats provided of course there even is a safehouse and Mother isnt at their hovel." Draco sneered. He couldnt help it. The thought of his mother dressed like Molly Weasley living and a hovel like that was enough to make him feel ill.
Harry hadn't been in a single detention all year. He had kept his head down and kept quiet no matter how much he wanted to obliterate the toad woman. Wasting a year of education aside, she had been down right nasty from day one. She had tried so hard to rile him up and it had come close a few times, Harry had clenched his fist under the desk so hard at one comment that his nails had actually punctured the skin of his palm.
Harry blamed Dumbledore for that as well. Harry was certain that his father had never been reprimanded for his bullying ways while in school, and that compounded upon the fact that afterwards he was thrown into the war in early adulthood, meant his father had never been giving the tools or opportunity to grow up and act like the lord that he was.
Sorry for the long wait. I had to reread the book so this could be as cannon as I could make it, but 6th year was a tricky one to reconfigure...
Yes, Harry was used to strange things happening to him by this point, and couldn't bring himself to feel shocked when he woke on his birthday after the whole tournament fiasco to find wings and horns were now attached to him. And those were just the two obvious things. His eyes not had slit pupils and almost seemed to glow and he had claws on his finger tips. His wings were jet black with green tips at the very ends and the horns grew elegantly out of his scalp following his skull and bending behind his head. He was certain that if he threw his head back hard enough they would puncture his shoulders.
The hat spoke to her for a moment but didnt take long before shouting "Gryfindor!" Enthusiastically.
"He is not with me, though I would assume he is doing his classwork as I did not see him on the pitch on my way down." Sev answered, seeing both sadness and relief cross his god sons face.
Harry had only swore once and he would never do it again. It took two hours for the taste of soap to get out of his mouth.
He did notice Lucius come in and gather Draco from the Slytherin table and leave. The man nodded in his direction in greeting, which Harry returned, before leaving again, Draco in tow.
That meant he was a horcrux. Harry really wished he could bring himself to be bothered about this more. That doesn't mean that a certain headmaster wouldn't be hearing it from him when he saw him next.
To Nevels credit he hung on tight and didnt get thrown off. At least until the outstreatched hand of a statue on the outer wall caught his robes. Nevel dangled there until his robes ripped and he fell to the ground landing on his left side.
Harry wasn't sure what had happened. It wasn't every day you find out you are part creature. That said, it wasn't exactly a shock either.
But another epiphany presented itself. Draco realized hed been treated more decently in the last hour by the people he hated for years, than his father had as far back as Draco could remember.
"I knew something was different right away that day at the bank although there is a specific way for a vampire to sense their mate. Your blood sings to me. It was a matter of time before one of the knives slipped. You should sharpen your set by the way. Also, it pays for to be the best friend of your other mates father. Lucius finds it hilarious that I ended up mated to both of my godsons." Snape said , his eyes rolled upward in exasperation.
Lucius gave them both a meaningful look that promised pain should they fail to fix the problem. And it was with a promise to return to Harry that Lucius dutifully left while otherwise ignoring his best friend and son.
"He is a child! He doesn't know what's best for him. He needs to be somewhere safe." Molly tried to argue.
Yes and that was just it wasn't it. Harry had seemed so eager to have someone protect him when they had first talked. Only for him to turn around and refuse the help when he clearly needed it. It hurt just a bit that Harry didn't yet feel he could rely on Severus to protect him.
"You can't stop me from turning you in for this. I will not allow you to harm anyone else." Harry said, about to draw his own wand.
Sure enough he turned to see Malfoy and son. The elder held his wand out, likely having been the one to counter the stunner that had been aimed at Harrys back.
"Yeah but his magic is off on another level. The Griffindors may be able to help you get over being shy around others." Gregory Goyle was a nice enough bloke though he didn't say much. Neither did Vincent Crabbe but still nice enough.
The grounds were overgrown and would need maintenance, and the outer walls of the manor would need a good scrubbing. Harry could imagine the sheet covered furniture and layers of dust within without needing to see it.
If anyone was more shy or jumpy than Harry, it was Nevel Longbottom. Harry felt genuinely bad as he watched the trembling boy mount his broom silently.
By the time they got back to the estate poor Harry was exhausted. He went down for a nap without much effort and Snape couldnt help but smile a bit. The child was shy but well behaved. He was far more forgiving than he should be and though he was malnourished, he clearly had an appetite so getting him healthy wouldnt be difficult. He was glad that Lucious was such a push over for his wife as it prompted everything in motion to save the poor boy from further abuse.
"Well, bugger. I hope I didn't do too badly and you're just observant. It really is painful though." Harry admitted relaxing a bit as both he and Lucius took seats on opposite couches.
"Can you ask him? Maybe he could come for my birthday." Draco was basically mumbling his eyes turning dark with sleep as the covers were lifted around him.
Now though as he stared at his completed homework and his most recent bank statements, Harry found himself void of emotion regarding much of anything. He wasn't sure at this point if he really wanted to survive this war and deal with the 'adoring' fans that would come with it. Truly, though he felt like he wanted to be needed, he also didn't think anyone would ever approach him genuinely ever again after the war was over if he lived. It would always be fame, status and money.
"You as well, Mrs Weasley. If you'll pardon me though, I must see the boys off and all. Good day." She called out politely but she too had become tense, as she straightened herself even further than usual and calmly led Draco and Harry through.
Harry suddenly remembered the other student he had heard the rumors about her detentions from. A little first year girl who was trying to tell their prefect what had happened.
In the grave yard against the Dark Lord he had space and luck on his side. Here not so much. He was in a cramped classroom full of large desks and such with his only exit locked.
"It actually true. He really is different." Draco couldn't believe it. Potter was actually breaking away from his manipulators. It was enough to make the young aristocrat giddy.
Hermione had noticed Harry was as nervous as she was about their flying class that monday as they would actually be going up in the air after weeks of broom safety and maintenance lectures. So, she'd suggested that after they finished their charms homework of course, they headed over to Hagrids hut or a bit of tea.
"If I have to go fly despite the stupid thing not rising an inch or more off the ground when I say 'up' hen you, who did so on the first try, are not missing it. Nervous or not." Hermione said, a hand on her hip and everything.
After a nap Harry was introduced to the Malfoys, who had come over for dinner. Harry remembered the man from getting picked up the day before but hadn't questioned it much when he disappeared right after.
"Sorry I has looking for a toad. Another students lost theirs." A bushy haired girl their age asked as she looked at the both of them.
"Do forget whatever that man has told you. Magic is a gift and a wonderful one. You have a lot of magic and while you are young it will protect you and help heal you. It acts out when you have strong emotions. You'll learn to control it over time." Snape explained patiently as Harry took in this new information.
This was on purpose, Harry knew, since the first years were to be seated later so they could be sorted.
"Very well. I shall fetch him. If you'll excuse me Lenora." Narcissa bid farewell to the woman and left to get her husband.
"Perfect then. I can send a few elves to get the place clean and child proofed for you. I would suggest making sure you have everything you need though. Just know we would be happy to help wherever we can." Lucious was for once 100% sincere.
"Master, it be almost time. Master Malfoy bes here in only a few moments. The parlor is ready for yous and guests. The apparition and floo room is prepared for his arrival sirs." Miffty announced.
"Honestly, there really is just a lot on my mind. I still have one more horcrux to find, and even then we have to get Nagini away from her master. Then there's all the responsibilities that come with my house, things that have gone unchecked since before I was born, since my father never took up the lordship. My finances are an absolute mess, no thanks to the headmasters meddling after he died. Plus I am likely going to need to stay with the goblins over the break. They are the only ones I would trust to purify the horcruxs. To be perfectly honest, it's a lot to keep track of. Plus, I really need to figure out what's going to happen after school. I mean, what would I even do? I hardly care for authority so the aurors are not an option, There's no way I could be a healer, not with my potions grade where it is. I wouldn't mind being a curse breaker, but even I need human interaction every once in a while. I guess, I just don't know what to do after all this is over, provided I live to see the end of everything. Actually, I have no idea why I'm even telling you all this." Harry ranted finally giving in under Dracos glare.
They all waited with heavy hearts to see Harry open his eyes. Even Dumbledore had made an appearance a few times trying to figure out what was wrong with the boy.
Now Harry was starting to get really tired very easily and quickly. He couldn't figure out what was wrong and all the added stress of that made any progress in occlumency near impossible.
"Interesting. My own family carries veela genes and both myself and my son carries it. That said I still don't understand them." Lucius was list to his curiosity.
Harry wasn't sure how long after that it took to lose the Weasleys, but he managed eventually and afterward went home to relish the peace and quiet.
"Sorry Draco. Even on your birthday they won't leave me alone." Harry said sadly as yet another ministry person, some lady wearing all pink (who frankly looked annoying before even speaking), left unsatisfied as Draco had to politely tell her to buzz off.
"Indeed, I do look forward to seeing how he handles himself tomorrow. He is obviously receiving training from somewhere. He handled that situation very well. Not perfect but well enough.... What's that look Draco?" Lucius noticed a peculiar look on his sons face.
"Ah, well, I do appreciate his discretion, but you can tell him I don't mind who he tells. I'm hardly worried about public opinion right now. Last year was a mess and while I did get a publicist to help me fix it, it isn't like it will be gone overnight.
Ron had decided that Harry being the new seeker was some kind of publicity stunt and was a great offense despite it being his fault to begin with. And he proclaimed it to anyone who would listen as loudly as possible. For the last two weeks.
Ok, so i may have had to reread the first book again. A few of the planned scenes i may have originally pulled from the 2nd book instead of the first on accident, and since Im planning a full rewrite I needed to get a few facts straight.
Meeting with Malfoy Senior, and of course DUMBles tries something. It's Dumbles after all. He's always trying something.
"No. He's right. I haven't been to see any of my friends in ages. I didn't even want to play and this happens." Harry said miserably, near tears.
Harry unpackaged one of his sugar quills and placed the end in his mouth while he waited for Draco to figure out the best way to form the questions he likely had.
Yet, once again, against his better instincts, he was leaving the castle to meet with the Dark Lord.
