“Draco,” she said stiffly. Draco waited a moment, sure that if he kept her waiting on a response she would simply give up and leave, but that was not Pansy. Pansy was, intellectually-speaking, dumber than a bag of bezoars, but she wasn’t
“Why are you so sure we’ll be okay?” he asked, slipping an arm around Draco’s waist and pulling him close, as much for his comfort as to ward off the cold. “Dunno if you remember, but you still hated me just a few months ago. And it was only two
"Me too," Harry agreed. He twined their legs together, his hand lifting to trail lazy fingers down Draco's arm. "Y'know I'd been nervous Leo wouldn't recognise you or something when you changed, but he knew it was you."
Harry walked up to Draco. “Hey, are you okay? You look uncomfortable.”
Harry felt pity. Why didn’t Draco just ask to go earlier? It probably hurt to hold this much and this long. “C’mon, Draco. Lets hurry so you can go pee.”
“No you won’t! You know what, I’ll close off if you give me the keys. Then you go to the bathrooms!” Harry said while pointing at the bathrooms.
And with a shock, Draco saw Harry was hard.
“What?”
Draco felt ashamed but he couldn’t move his hands away from his crotch, otherwise he would surely pee himself.
“Hold it! Merlin, you gotta be kidding me!” Harry yells.
Harry was taken aback. “Shit Malfoy... I’m sorry. But.., why? I don’t understand why your dad hates you. I mean, you act like his fucking twin at school,” Harry said dumbly.
“That was hot.”
Harry left Hagrids hut and rushed towards Hogwarts. Once there he grabbed a soft black sweater he owned and some black trousers. He also grabbed clean boxers and socks. He then rushed back to Hagrids hut and waited for Draco to finish showering.
For the past few weeks, he has seen how Draco would hold his pee till the end of the movie. Then he would immediately make a dash for it. Something about seeing the slytherin desperate, turned Harry on. He googled what this could mean and quickly found out about this certain kink. After doing some research, he wants to see Draco wet himself.
Harry looked at him with pity. “So why don’t you go?”
Draco flushed red. Harry saw him that night? He was practising on his own that night. He needed to pee so badly but he wasn’t gonna stop till he had the snitch. When he finally caught it, his boxers were soaked. He ran to the changing rooms but they were locked. Needless to say, he didn’t make it. But Harry didn’t need to know that.
Harry saw the tears gathering in Draco’s eyes and smiled softly as he put a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Hey, heads up man. You can hold it in. Really, you are gonna make it!” Harry said, trying to encourage Draco.
“Do you know the room of requirement?”
“Just... just hurry please. I need to pee so badly. Like really fucking badly. I don’t think I have ever needed to pee this badly before,” Draco moaned as he walked again.
Draco blushed and stepped closer too. “Do you think so?” He said as he looked Harry straight in the eyes.
When he looked up again, Potter was frowning. Fuck.
Harry shook out of his trance and made his way towards Draco. He must be so embarrased. Harry really felt bad for him. Harry placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder but Draco flinched away.
Draco put on Harry’s clothes. He felt much better currently. Harry had been so kind and sweet. He also felt clean now which helped improve his mood a lot.
Draco tries not to cry. The embarrasment and the effort of holding is getting to him. He sees Harry staring at the wet spot so he quickly pulls up his trousers again.
Draco sighed. It had been a long day of working so far. He started early in the morning and it was currently two in the afternoon. He just had lunch break and was now ready to work his remaining hours till five.
“I’m not! I’m fine!” Draco said while changing his position again.
“Mmm.., I think you look adorable too...” Draco said flirtingly.
Okay so maybe Malfoy was right, Harry thought. Harry had been the one to throw beetroot in Malfoy’s potion, causing it to explode. He just found it funny. It was an innocent prank and Draco the huge git deserved it.
More pee escaped and the wet spot grew. Draco whimpered. It was so bad now.
“Sorry mate. You can go now.”
Harry rolled his eyes. Dramatic git.
He emerged out of the bathroom and saw Harry sitting on the couch. Harry gaped as he saw Draco in his new clothes.
“Harry, I can’t. I need to go so b-badly. I’m gonna wet himself. I c-can’t hold it anymore!” He said desperately. He must have looked pathetic. Hands still shoved in his crotch while whining about needing to pee. He was like a freaking toddler.
Draco sighed. “Because I’m the only worker here today and I need to be here all the time. And customers didn’t want to leave in my only break so I couldn’t go then! So I’ve been holding all afternoon. Can I please scan your items now so you can leave? I’m embarrassed enough.”
Harry looks in awe as he recognizes Draco starting to have a full-blown accident. Still, he feels the need to make a last lie to completely fill his dream.
“Go behind the tree! I promise I won’t look. Really, you can make it to there!” Harry said as he pointed to the nearby tree.
were heard from the students before McGonagall nodded her head. "Very well then," she said, gesturing towards the exit of the hall, "if you will all follow me now. I will lead you to your new common room."
family too. Why would they suddenly not want him anymore?
No! No, no, no, no... He wasn't doing this again.
The way his pale hair contrasted with the darkening sky outside and the stars becoming more visible, Harry was reminded of their first day of the school year. Malfoy had been sitting in the window too when Harry had arrived in their room - much the same as he was now.
“Of course”, Draco said, smiling brightly. “We won’t let anything get to you, Ted. Not even those horrible and evil Thunder Gods.”
A smirk appeared on the blond's delicate features as he shrugged. "Fine," he said, "have it your way."
Of all the moments they have shared together, Harry’s favourite ones were always the short, blissful moments after they just had sex. The tender moments in which they would hold each other close as they slowly came down from their high. In those moments, he always felt loved and cherished and he would always make sure Draco would feel like that too.
Luna sighed as she leaned closer to Harry, resting her head on his shoulder. Though the gesture wasn't something big, Harry always felt a little better knowing Luna was trying to lift his spirits, if only by a little.
Peeking up at Harry through his blond lashes, Draco gave him an incredulous look, both eyebrows raising towards his hairline. “Did you really think this was it?”, he asked, his voice accusing. “Honestly, Harry,” he drawled, “you should know better than that by now.”
“It isn’t my fault you know next to nothing about the Muggle World”, Harry retorted, taking a step closer to his boyfriend.
“Hmm, are you sure, Ted?”, Draco asked, concern visible on his face, though Harry saw the amusement and tenderness swirling in his silver eyes. He laid a gentle hand on the top of Teddy’s head.
It was still hard to believe how those two had ended up together. Especially since he thought Blaise hadn't shown any interest in Pansy whatsoever over the last couple of years. Yet he couldn't deny they didn't fit together either. They easily completed the other in a way Draco wished someone would complete
The first thing he noticed when she became less blurry was that she wasn't wearing her usual school robes and neither was she wearing one of her own creations. No, instead she was wearing a knitted, red jumper with a huge, blue 'G' in the middle of it. It wasn't hard - even for slightly drunk Harry - to figure out it was one of Molly's famous Weasley jumpers.
Draco wasn't someone who backed down from a challenge this easily because he was scared of losing. He had
She leaned closer to the person next to her.
"Well, that's fantastic, Draco!" Pansy exclaimed, clapping her hands together. "She really deserves some happiness after everything she's been through."
The longer he stared at the flames, the heavier his eyes became. So, he decided to go on a stroll around the castle, hoping it would wake him up enough to prevent himself from falling asleep on the spot.
Draco snorted softly. “That’s probably the only thing you know here, in the Manor.”
at Harry.
with catching and throwing a Quaffle to his teammates. He had ended up missing the ball more often than not, eventually even falling off his broom when a Bludger had hit him square in the chest.
Even Blaise and Pansy had managed to engage Harry into a few minutes of pointless conversation about what Professor Flitwick had been wearing the other day. Pansy couldn't stop laughing at the atrocious hat the older man had been wearing. Even Hermione had to admit it had been truly a horrendous sight to see.
Godric eyed Harry curiously, tilting his head slightly. "Now," he started, his curiosity clearly getting the better of him, "what brings you here this night, young man? You seem a bit... troubled, I should say."
Not being able to look at the sad form of his godson, Harry opened the door further and walked into the room. He sat down on the small bed next to Draco, giving his fiancé a quick peck on the cheek in greeting.
Uncertain if he should, Harry chanced a look at the girl in front of him, seeing a whole mixture of different emotions visible in the depths of her brown eyes.
The words left his mouth, yet he immediately knew it had been the wrong thing to say - if the raised eyebrow and the slight slumping of Draco's shoulders were anything to go by.
"Well, look who finally chose to bless us with his presence!" Seamus exclaimed from one of the armchairs at the opposite side of the room with a content and half-asleep Dean in his lap. "If it isn't our Saviour!"
Harry looked down at his lap, his cheeks flushing even more as he ignored the smug expression crossing the girl's face.
"How is your mother, by the way. I've heard she has been transferred to France?"
Do normal friends feel a slight pull towards the other whenever they were standing this close?
All gone.
The first thing Draco noticed, as he stepped out of the familiar Floo, was the sound of the Wireless blasting music.
Those questions had kept him awake for several nights the following week and even now, as he was still standing in the dark, shaky corridor of the Hogwarts Express, he didn't know if he was ready...
Something felt off.
He squeezed his shoulder softly. "Harry?" he whispered. "Can you hear me?"
," McGonagall said, giving them all a pointed look, "you only get one chance. If I find that this privilege is being misused, I will not hesitate to give all of you an early curfew and a couple detentions."
Sure, Draco had learnt to keep his insults to Muggles and Muggleborns to a minimum – he had, in fact, lived in Muggle London with Harry for a bit – but that doesn’t mean he also has to
A yawn escaped Harry's mouth. He was absolutely knackered.
the box was placed on the couch.
At the beginning, Draco seemed to struggle a bit, but he soon got the hang of it, throwing and catching the ball as if he had been doing it his whole life, dodging a Bludger every now and again with remarkable ease.
It felt like he had been chasing the Snitch for ages already, twisting and turning around the pitch. Yet the small, fluttering ball always stayed just out of reach. If Harry didn't know any better he would say the Snitch was actually teasing him.
“You like that one,” Potter said softly; one of his hands wrapped gently around Draco’s wrist, pulling it away.

Harry’s insides squirmed when he thought about how little sleep she must have been getting since Lavender died — if it had been Ron or Hermione, Harry was unsure whether he’d have been able to move on from it at all.
Draco scowled. “And what? If you had, you’d have done something about it?”
"Of course, yeah," agrees Potter, sitting on his bed in just his red pants. His glasses are back on his nose and Draco can see sweat still glistening on his skin. His cheeks are flushed. He looks ...
“You have a terrible memory,” said Draco, but his voice was unsteady and Potter wasn’t buying it.
It was when Harry’s cock touched that same deep something inside of him that his fingers had brushed against before that Draco forgot about the pain altogether. He drew in a sharp gasp and hooked a leg more securely around Harry’s waist, pulling him in and sobbing out his pleasure without even
"He's in no shape to have dealt with something like that," Pomfrey said fiercely. "The curse itself does no physical damage but the thrashing around ... the victim can often become injured as a byproduct ..." She was hovering her wand over him, ostensibly checking that this hadn't happened. "Thought I'd seen the last of it ... an Unforgivable ... after
“Defence?” Draco enquired of him. Again, Blaise merely nodded. He’d always been a quiet, reserved sort of person, but those traits seemed to have been amplified ever since Draco had been hit with that hex, not to mention the end of the war and the part Draco had played in it. “How far along are you?”
"That's so good," Harry breathed, petting through Draco's hair and sliding his cock just a little deeper again, feeling the head squeezing into the tight channel of Draco's throat. Draco's hands lifted to Harry's hips, steadying himself, trying so hard to take everything Harry was giving him. The lack of proper oxygen seemed to be contributing to his fuzzy mental state, or maybe it was just pulling him further down into whatever headspace he was currently inhabiting. When Harry finally pulled out again Draco sucked in a rasping breath, his lips swollen, his cheeks and chin wet, and he hardly wasted a second before he was surging forward to press a series of obsessive, sucking kisses to Harry's recently-bared skin, just above the line of his pubic hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
The cleaning-up recommenced but everyone was still stealing curious glances at Harry, which made it take twice as long as it should have, as well as creating a minor roadblock at the door when people kept stopping to say hi or blatantly ogle him on their way out.
, so hopeful, so goddamned sincere. And even more than that, they were haunted. Draco wanted to look away, but he couldn’t. “You asked before if I like the attention I get, and I didn’t
The least intimidating things inside the package were a terribly feminine pair of slacks and simple blouse, and after ushering Pansy out of the room Draco dressed himself and covered it up with his school robes gratefully.
"That stuff happens to me too," said Harry quietly. "Over the summer I saw a Mind Healer at Mungo's a few times a week, I'll probably do it again after we graduate. It was really intense but it helped a lot — and she told me that, as long as I kept talking about it and working on all kinds of coping techniques and stuff, it would get better. So ... it can for you too." He paused and then forced his next thought out: "I think

all that many feelings about it. There was some part of him which was glad Ginny and Dean had found their way back to one another, happy just to know that Ginny was happy, that she’d moved on. But a much larger part of him was not focused on Ginny at all, but rather the realisation that he, too, had so thoroughly moved on.
“Draco,” Harry’s voice sounded again, more insistent now, and this time — with his father finally out of sight, maybe for the final time — he didn’t resist when Harry pulled him close. In fact, he melted into his arms, burying his face in Harry’s shoulder and letting the rest of the tears come. “I’m so sorry, Draco,” Harry whispered against his hair, both arms wrapped tightly around him. “This was a terrible idea on my part —”
“Don’t be fucking rude,” Draco snaps, grabbing for the cap of his empty bottle of Butterbeer and chucking it at Harry, who laughs when he feels it hit his shoulder and drop to the ground. “It’s not nearly as heterosexual as that rat’s nest on your head.”
“Darling, will you please listen to me?” she said softly. It sounded eerily like his mother, which only made him feel young and childish. He tugged his arm away and she let him go, but he didn’t move any farther away. “I am
“Definitely,” said Harry, glancing again at the grave. “I wish I knew how to Conjure some flowers or something to leave here.”

about stuff. But we have another eight months to do the talking. We have a lot of time to start preparing ourselves.”
"That doesn't just suddenly happen."
“I’ve had a long time to come to terms with it, angel. After the things we went through last year … I confess, the only thing I care about these days is your happiness. If another … another man gives that to you, then, well … that’s what matters to me.”
As soon as he noticed Potter stand up, Draco did as well. Across the room, Draco saw him look his way again, and Draco caught his eye for a moment before Potter was out the door.
"How tall am I?" he asked. The fuzziness was beginning to leave him finally and her words were having more of an impact. "Why didn't that part work?"
"D'you want me to come in with you now or do you wanna be alone with her first?" Harry asked. They were stood in front of the door to the office, Draco staring at it like an insurmountable obstacle and clutching Harry's hand so hard it was very likely the bones would bruise. Harry being Harry allowed it without complaint.
“It’s nothing,” he told Boothby thickly, the words distorted by the broken bone. He seemed to be just barely holding back a scream. “Just a row we’d had the other day. It’s fine.”
Hermione seemed to understand that Harry had made up his mind, because she didn’t try to stop him again when he left.
He throws another hex and Potter blocks it, and then another, and another, sweating with effort, and somewhere in between them Potter gets in one of his own that knocks Draco off his feet. As he’s walking over — presumably to help Draco up, since he’s
The question was absurd and sounded rhetorical anyway, so Harry didn't answer. Instead, with his heart racing, he leaned in closer, and — meeting no resistance — dropping his gaze to Malfoy's mouth at the last second before closing his eyes — he touched their lips together. For a second neither of them did anything, they simply sat there with their mouths pressed together, Harry aware of that sweet, peachy smell more distinct than ever, and then suddenly Malfoy was hesitantly opening his mouth and Harry did the same. The kiss was all lips, slow and clumsy and unsure, and a few shaky breaths passed between them. Harry lifted his hand to Malfoy's face, at first a tentatively half-closed fist that eventually relaxed and cupped his cheek.
It was distinctly strange, knowing he was in bed with Draco Malfoy after having just got finished dry-humping each other to orgasm. It was utterly ludicrous, and somehow very fitting for the two of them. Harry's body was still warm and buzzing wonderfully with the aftermath.
"He's a miserable, ungrateful prat."
this …”
“I don’t think anyone ever really gave you a chance,” says Potter simply. Draco stares at him, and he shivers, and he feels more goosebumps make all the skin on his arms feel tight. When he can’t take it anymore, he looks away.
His hands were smaller than they used to be, but that didn’t stop Draco from pulling one back and thrusting it forward straight into Potter’s jaw, satisfied with the way Potter stumbled backwards despite the way his knuckles were now screaming in pain. One hand on his jaw, Potter looked back at Draco once he’d steadied himself without much shock on his face, as though some part of him had been fully expecting that sort of reaction.
“I don’t know,” he went on, “but for whatever it’s worth, I
He nodded and wiped at a tear. “I’m scared he only likes me in this body.”
Malfoy, and he never showed up. Ron said he was taking a shortcut back up here and ran into him. The way Ron tells it, some Hufflepuff he didn’t recognise had him cornered.”
In spite of that, in opposition to everything he’d ever thought he knew about himself, Draco reached out and took the cotton pad from Granger’s hand.
Draco sighed quietly and went back over to the sofa. Harry sat down again next to him.
“Sorry, I didn’t catch that. Once more?”
"Yeah," said Harry slowly, looking back and forth between them, "and so did several other people, including McGonagall and Slughorn."
A loud pop made Draco scream — actually
It was harsh, yet Draco was filled suddenly with admiration for Weasley’s forthright honesty. No dancing around the point. No frills. Just the truth.
She let out a hefty sigh and dropped her hands back to her lap. “To be perfectly honest with you, Draco … the way things are right now, given the political climate and the ridicule that comes with our name, knowing that Potter has a reason to look out for you sets my mind at ease. He does tend to successfully protect the things he cares about.”
“Yeah,” Draco says. He lifts up and off of Harry, making him hiss. “And I’m still figuring you out, Potter.”
Instead of answering Harry leaned in and kissed him — Draco pulled away with a little gasp and looked around, wide-eyed, but Harry pulled him back in with a hand on the back of his neck. He was tense for a few seconds before relaxing into it, his free hand lifting to skim his fingers lightly along the line of Harry's jaw. He was just beginning to work Draco's mouth open and get his tongue inside when the portrait hole opened again, and suddenly he heard Ron's voice:
"As a trial run," Harry agreed, grinning. "I'm gonna teach you how to cook."
“I think you’re pissed,” Draco said, shifting a bit on Potter’s lap and letting his hands fall to rest on that bare chest, enjoying the feel of sparse wiry hairs beneath his palms. “Will you stay tonight?”
“I love you,” he said candidly. The honesty of it, the raw truthfulness of the words, robbed Draco of air. Harry let out a breathless little laugh, eyes alive with surging emotion. “I’m sorry. I know you’re terrified of hearing it, but I do. And it’s not
Wrapped up in his duvet with the curtains of his four-poster pulled shut around him, Draco shuddered. It wasn’t revulsion, as he would have hoped, but cold, confused dread. For the first time since Conway’s hex had forced him into an uncomfortable new body, he wasn’t thinking about how hyperaware he was of the weight on his chest, or the strangeness of his center of gravity having shifted to his hips; he was instead frantically searching for a reason behind this apparent madness. For that was what it felt like, knowing Harry Potter had kissed him: utter madness. As though they’d slipped unwittingly into some distant dimension.
guy?” The cigarette in his hand makes an orange stripe in the air when he lifts it to gesture towards the building, inside of which is Kit and Janae and Hermione and Ron and loads of other people who couldn’t possibly matter less. “Please,” he says again.
Instead of using the opportunity to try and talk to Malfoy again, however, Harry decided simply to keep an eye on him from a distance. It was far easier, and he thought Malfoy probably wanted him hanging around about as much as Harry wanted to spend his time hanging around Malfoy. More than once he stepped in — as casually as he could — to pretend to have to ask Malfoy a question when he saw someone drawing too close to him, and although Malfoy never actually said so Harry knew he was aware of what he was doing. It helped that, as Ron had pointed out, people seemed much less eager to try things under Harry's nose than Goyle's. He thought it also had something to do with the lack of Goyle cracking his knuckles at everyone, though. He was under no delusions that it would have stopped had Goyle listened to him and backed off on the guard-dog thing completely, but it was certainly helping for the moment.
“It isn’t as if you

It was a bit silly to think he would have been less afraid to once again face a Hungarian Horntail than admit to Narcissa Malfoy that he had knocked up her son.
Potter nodded, apparently satisfied. “So, do you, er, want to fly, then, since we’re out here? We could have a Seeker’s match.”
“Why don’t we go somewhere else,” Harry said. He nodded towards the door. His expression was unreadable. “Outside, maybe. It’ll be quieter.”
“One of them,” he says, “went insane.”
over and over again, until the words and the phrase lost all meaning, and he tried to find unconsciousness, only his eyes kept popping back open to stare at the ceiling.
good."
“Was that okay?” Potter whispered eventually, and something in his voice sounded just this side of unsure. It was so typical Potter that Draco could do nothing but laugh weakly.
The girl that Harry's with isn't anyone Draco knows.
"We don't," he said. "It's going to be Lily regardless of gender."
She fell rather dramatically back into her seat.
"Quit being so dramatic."
“What did it say?” Draco asked, curious against his better judgment.
At a rapid pace their slow, awkward fumblings gained fervour, each passing second giving way to a new flood of remembered emotions between the two of them, all the anger and hatred and pent-up tension, the discord and the miscommunication which had given way lately to something much different, much

This was difficult to believe sometimes with his trademark sneer replaced by an almost tangible insecurity, yet the sneer never disappeared completely and it was in those moments that Harry found it easiest to remember who he was and ignore him.

and a tray of food in its hands so huge it seemed it would squash the creature beneath it in mere moments. Potter leapt off the bed so fast Draco fell sideways; he took the overlarge tray from the pitifully tiny elf and set it on Draco’s desk.
“You know, Harry, you
Over the next few weeks, as homework piled up again and people began getting somewhat used to seeing Draco and Goyle hanging around Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Draco faced a fraction less harassment —
“Draco,” Harry’s voice broke him out of his thoughts. Draco found his eyes and then looked down, heart climbing into this throat when he caught sight of Harry’s thick, straining cock, bobbing in midair with a bead of pre-come leaking out of the slit. The head was an angry red, and for all the sarcasm that had been in Draco’s voice when he’d ribbed Harry about thinking himself too big, Draco was reminded now that the size of his cock was, indeed, quite impressive. Nothing impossible, of course, but … really rather large. His hole clenched in anticipation of the stretch. “Tell me one more time. Tell me you’re sure.”
"Oh, well if that's all," said Harry with a roll of his eyes. At that moment, he noticed movement from the bench where Malfoy and Goyle were sitting and realised Goyle had stood up. He was hovering deliberately in front of Malfoy, who had looked up from his book and appeared apprehensive. A few boys who looked to be sixth- or seventh-years had slowed as they were passing them.
“When do I change it?” he asked softly. He saw surprise register in Granger’s eyes, but she did a good job of covering it up.
, but he was asleep almost before he’d finished the thought.
“I’m not a bloody cheater,” says Draco. “I’m still dating someone.”
Draco's teeth click shut and he stares hard at Potter, at the end of his wits.
look he’d pinned Draco with, the one that said, “I know your father, and I know what he would do if he saw you this way.”
"That was so sweet, Harry, thank you," she says, getting up from her desk and going to take it from him. Draco keeps his gaze resolutely down on his lap.
“Fine. D’you mind if we finish this fucking film, then?”
, but it tingled. This alone would have been enough to make his throat close up. The whole classroom went quiet, but Harry couldn’t tell if that had actually happened or if it was just because his ears had started ringing. Everyone was looking at him, he realised after a moment. Like someone turning up the volume, he noticed suddenly that Professor Boothby was talking to him.
"My hands are fine," he insists stubbornly. And they usually are — he takes great care in them. He'd have

, Harry mouthed to him. Draco mouthed it back.
"I just wanna do it. Get it done with."
“Don’t,” Harry said, cutting him off sharply. He opened his eyes and looked down at the impossible sight before him, and on Malfoy’s face he saw a subdued smirk. He squeezed again and then leaned forward, dragging the flat of his tongue up the vein on the underside of Harry’s cock. Harry’s head fell back again and he said, voice slightly strained, “Just … shut the fuck up for once, Malfoy, and keep doing that.”
There's a pause. "You two talked?"
“No,” said Draco, and the matter was dropped.
a memory. At one time, it had caused him greatest despair to know what his mum had once thought of his dad, but as he’d gotten older, and as he’d learned how little black-and-white there was to the world, he’d grown rather fond of knowing his parents had overcome a history of … not getting along.
Harry had a hand in his hair now, tipping his head just slightly back for a better angle. Both of Draco's were in his lap, clenching at his thighs. Mouth full, throat distended and breathing unevenly through his nose, his glassy eyes told Harry he was getting what he needed out of this. He slid deeper into his throat, feeling Draco gag, and then pulled out to let him suck in a more satisfying breath with a gasp. He lifted a hand to wrap around Harry's cock, sliding through a mixture of spit and pre-come, working him over with soft squelching noises that made Harry's gut twist. When he took him back in his mouth and sank as far down as he could go his nose touched Harry's shirt, so he pulled that off over his head and groaned when Draco swallowed around him.
Harry’s face lost its humour. “You think that’s going to help?”
“Get under,” he said, a note of irritation in his voice. And Draco did, glad for the first time that he was shorter than he used to be, for the Cloak barely covered them both. Potter had to crouch so that it wouldn’t kick up around their feet.
. Draco tried to hit him, but his wrist was caught in a tight grip before he’d moved it more than a couple inches.
Generally Harry tried to keep his interactions with Malfoy short, but one day about a week into December he actually sat down next to him out in the courtyard due to a group of mixed Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors who'd been eyeing Malfoy in a way Harry didn't like at all.
“Harry!” he hissed. His cheeks bloomed with heat and he tried to close his legs unsuccessfully. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?!”
Harry chuckled, swiping a thumb along Malfoy’s cheekbone before grabbing his wand to spell away the mess in his pants, something he hadn’t had to do in quite a long time.
“You are?” Granger said abruptly. He looked at her and saw the beginning of a smile forming on her face in spite of the situation. “I just … I thought you kept telling him …?”
“I’ll leak this to the
"Draco," Harry said, gathering himself and standing from the sofa. "Look ... they already knew, all right? They caught me the other day coming back from your room. I’m sorry, I should’ve told you, I didn’t expect —"
I'll still want to be dating you when we leave Hogwarts. You know, you still haven't told me what your immediate plan is, by the way."
me, so I didn’t have to find out from Slughorn at six in the bloody morning that my mother was here and knew everything.”
Draco pitched a sigh, tears drying on his face.

“Oh, you
“Do it again,” Malfoy rasped. His fingers were twisted up in Harry’s hair and he looked frantic. Conflicted but frenzied. “Please, Potter, it … it feels so good, I haven’t —” he broke off, like he was fighting himself against the words he was saying, “— I haven’t gotten off in
“Yes, the whole neighbourhood knows now.” And after a pause, “I love you too.”
it as he jerked and quivered through an orgasm, but Harry had to muffle his own cry in Malfoy's neck when he came. He ground his pulsing cock against Malfoy's arse until he was trembling and out of breath and realised he was gripping Malfoy's waist so tightly his nails were pinching the skin.
“Macmillan’s party,” he told Pansy. “He kissed me.”
He does know that the sculpture he’s looking at is called the crucifix. He knows that this man with his bleeding palms opened up around iron pegs is called Jesus, and that the Muggles (or a lot of them, at least) believe he died for their sins before returning to life.
you pictured it, though?" Malfoy went on, eyebrows raised rather theatrically. "Weasley probably grunts like an oaf while he's —"
“No,” Draco said immediately. Some part of him certainly would have liked to agree and get out of there. Another part of him, however, was so desperately curious that it overwhelmed the fear. That, and he wasn’t about to back down in front of Potter. Besides, there was no Dark Lord anymore, right? And the Basilisk, thanks to Potter, was dead. “I want to see it. How do we get down?”
“So in your mind,” Harry said, “it’s perfectly normal to suggest fucking, but kissing is a hard line?”
“Nothing.” Draco ripped his gaze away from the plate he’d been staring at and pushed it habitually towards Goyle, who took it in a state of similar habit and added its contents to his own meal. “I’m still feeling nauseous, that’s all. Hormones, I expect.”
"You heard me."
Malfoy pitched a soft sigh. "I don't know. I'm gonna have to talk to him."
"I won't," said Harry stubbornly. "If she's so independently-minded maybe she'll give Goyle a chance! Besides, Hermione wouldn't give him something to

“Why?”
discussed the upcoming transition back to himself. It was so daunting, such a deep-rooted anxiety that had been building for nearly a year now. He looked over at Harry and saw him looking back, and he knew he wasn't the only one thinking about their lack of communication. He broke the eye contact but resolved to have the discussion later, even if it killed him. "Before I take the cure," he forced himself to say, returning his gaze to Mrs Weasley.
“Just remembered, I guess,” he shrugged.
Inevitably, his eyes lifted back to the most famous of Potter’s scars, and he brushed a thumb across it.
“Please.”
Harry frowns. “Did.”
Harry’s breath was hot where he laughed against Draco’s skin, licking a stripe across his neck before unceremoniously spinning him around.
But he doesn’t want to do what Potter has endlessly told him he must do. He cannot bear the weight of it, it will kill him, he knows it. And if he dies now, with his soul still in shatters, still burdened with all his sins, then what?
This was a heart-stopping moment, because in truth, Draco had been looking for an answer to this question a long time now, even before Potter so boldly offered it up like it was his to give. It didn’t matter if he
Draco started off slow, running his lips across the skin on the inside of Potter’s thigh, inhaling the smell and letting it fuel the heat inside his belly. Potter’s fingers were alternately gripping and loosening on his hair, but it wasn’t until he started mouthing at the underside of his cock — running his tongue along the thick vein he found there — that he felt Potter’s nails against his skull.

He’s supposed to leave the cover on for another hour but Harry, impatient, convinces him to take it off so he can see.
"That's okay," Harry said into his ear, speeding his fingers up yet again. "You can come. Touch yourself."
“And adorable,” Harry added, smoothing a thumb across one pink cheek. “
Hermione ignored him, already having whipped her essay out of her bag and placed it on the table in front of them. Daphne had put hers down as well, and Harry saw her tuck a strand of hair behind her left ear, nearest Goyle.
"Just get your arse in there," Harry laughed.
“He’d kill us if we left Malfoy here alone,” said Weasley. “You know he would.”
what I’m insinuating. Now do me a fucking favour and start
"Please call me Harry," he mumbled. He curled his fingers inside of him. Malfoy's hand went to his hair and he pulled lightly.
It was true, but considering Crabbe had not been saved Harry thought it probably wasn't the most helpful thing to say right now. Still, he understood Ron's indignation and part of him was even glad he'd said it. Goyle only stared at him, face expressionless, and then turned and disappeared up the stairs.
“Do you think demanding things is going to work out for you right now?” Harry whispered, leaning over his body and letting the heat of his breath ghost across the side of Malfoy’s neck. “Because from where I’m standing, you have very little leverage at the moment, kitten.”
that’s
“I saw Malfoy Wednesday night,” he explained, “after the — er — incident with Helstrom.” Hermione’s lips pursed, for she had been highly disapproving of the way it had been handled, but she didn’t interrupt. “I thought he might have been angry with me —”
on this, you kinky fucking bastard.”
"Probably, yeah," said Harry, meeting Ron's sarcastic tone with a completely serious one. And, echoing Narcissa's sentiment, "I guess I'm gonna have a lot of time to get to know her. More than enough to start trying to piece together why she did the things she did, and to be able to tell if she really is sorry. I've been thinking a lot about Luna," he admitted, "how much time she spent in that dungeon. How anyone else —
Theo was quiet for several minutes. Finally, when he spoke, it was in a sober voice: “You’re talking as though you believe you’re stuck this way forever.”
"That," Harry said, "and I just think it'd be really good to pick a name that doesn't have anything to do with whatever gender it ends up being. I mean, what's that got to do with anything?"
Draco looks at him, standing there dripping wet and painfully sincere, and he wants to have the strength to turn him away but he doesn't.
“Well, it is!”
He became gradually aware that there was no pain anymore, that he was covered with sweat and breathing hard.
"Somebody's peckish!" came Mrs Weasley's voice from the sitting room, and shortly after she appeared in the kitchen with Leo in her arms, howling his displeasure in a way that Harry liked to say reminded him of someone he knew. "D'you have any bottles, Draco?"
"It was," says Draco quietly. It's not the whole truth, though. It isn't that black and white. Between them it never could be.
“You know I will.” Potter’s head was tipped back against the headboard, gazing pensively up at Draco. He wasn’t sure how long they sat that way, Draco drawing idle patterns on Potter’s much-darker skin while those green eyes stayed unwaveringly focused on him. The only sounds were that of their slow, whisky-scented breathing, and the occasional rustle against the sheets when Draco inevitably fidgeted. It was chilly with his shirt off, but Potter’s fingers felt soothing against his skin, and anyway, he was starting not to mind quite so much, being topless around Potter.
“Sounded to me like you were enjoying it,” he said, latching onto Draco’s jaw and pressing the stiffness of his cock against Draco’s thigh. His stomach

“Then
"D'you wanna go to your dorm?" says Potter after several long moments, pulling away from Draco's mouth only to kiss down his jaw.
Draco turned wide grey eyes on him. “
“In any case,” he went on, ignoring Hermione’s quiet chuckling, “I haven’t
“Doesn’t sound like anything I’ve ever heard of,” she shrugged, looking upset by the fight that had happened within the first week, but much more interested in the notes she was taking out of an enormous, dusty old tome she’d checked out of the library. “I’m sure he’ll be fine. Maybe it’ll even teach Malfoy to try keeping his head down for once, especially seeing as he's particularly unpopular at the moment.”
Harry snorted and seemed to come more fully awake now, blinking the sleep out of his eyes and looking fondly up at Draco, who was supporting himself on an elbow. Without his glasses, they looked especially green, and the sight made Draco feel slightly breathless.
"Don't see what's complicated about hating each other for seven years."
“He didn’t even pay,” Draco’s saying, “which was the worst part. You paid on our first date.”
to be having fun, Draco," says Hermione, sidling up and nudging him with her elbow. And in a lower voice, "You know you didn’t have to come. Ron’s got more than enough people here."
It never makes him feel anything but hollow. He tells himself he only needs to try harder. Dig deeper. Gouge himself of his sins.
“I’d like to talk,” she said.
Find me at
For a second Harry was completely thrown, and then understanding dawned, and he broke into a grin that made Draco roll his eyes.
It helped, but it didn’t erase Draco’s spite entirely. “Instead of abandoning me?” he said lightly. “So, what, you’re feeling guilty now? Or is it just that you’re bored and want my company again?”
With that opportunity squandered, Draco didn’t have a chance to see Potter again until their double Potions class later in the afternoon. He was able to slip him a note with
"I can't live with that, Draco," Harry tells him, brutally honest, sickeningly blunt. "I can't not see you."
… Potter, if you don’t stop I’m gonna — god, I’m gonna
Harry fidgeted where he sat, thinking about Malfoy, about how many times he’d kissed him, about meeting up with him under the Invisibility Cloak right in the middle of the library. Perhaps it hadn’t been a good idea, after all, to keep all this from Ron. At least not for this long.
"I'm gonna help you up, all right?" he said, beginning to stand. "I need to get you to the Infirmary."
“Right …” Harry stole one last intoxicating kiss from that addictive mouth and finally let go of Malfoy’s hips. “I’ll see you some time tomorrow, then. When you’re least expecting it. Stay on your toes, Malfoy."
“Last weekend,” he said, digging his hands deep into his pockets, “I spotted some bruises on his wrists. Pretty dark ones, like someone had been holding them, you know? He wouldn’t tell me who’d done it to him, and he didn’t want to talk about it, seemed really shaken up, which made me think …” He trailed off, looking at Hermione with a strained expression. She seemed to catch on quickly.
Once, Draco had told Harry he didn’t need protecting. Didn’t need to be saved.

“Merlin, they couldn’t have just had a Halloween feast like every other year, could they?” he said, running a hand through his hair again, clearly a bit frazzled.
“I’ll pass the message along.”
“Why not now?” Draco pressed.
“I need to talk to her,” Draco said softly. He lifted a hand and dragged his thumb across Harry’s stubbled cheek, still trying to find some semblance of comfort in the physical intimacy Harry was giving him. “I’ve put this off too long.”
The next time Pansy accosted him was that afternoon in the library.
"Draco," he said softly, "it's over, you're okay. Come on, can you open your eyes?"
that wanted to follow. Malfoy scowled.
Draco nodded. “Cheers, Potter.”

Potter let out a sigh and took a step towards Draco. Although his initial response was to take a compensatory step backwards, Draco fought the instinct. He wasn’t about to back down from Potter.
“Go home,” Draco says again, one hand already on his door.
“I’ll try,” he croaked.
In spite of himself Draco laughed, and with the laughter, absurdly, came tears. Not a lot, but enough that Harry finally scooted closer and wrapped an arm around him.
not now, when it’s supposed to have been done with finally. That’s why I made Ron promise not to tell you — I didn’t want you to have vengeance on your mind. I didn’t want you to go seeking out Malfoy or that Hufflepuff before he had a chance to seek you out first. You’re always the one saving people, but who saves
“I knew it.” Ron shook his head, looking both disgusted and betrayed. “I bloody knew it was him. It always is with you, isn’t it?”
"Doesn't really matter," Draco says. He pushes off the wall and throws on the cloak he's been carrying over his arm. "If that's all, I should be getting home."
“Exactly," said Malfoy, "there’s not much to know about you, Potter. You’re all surface-level.”
When it begins to rain, Draco winds his arms more tightly about Harry’s waist and presses his cheek to his back, shielding himself from the sudden onslaught like tiny pin pricks all over his face and arms. He hasn’t flown in more than a year, not counting the Fiendfyre – and somehow he doesn’t like to count that. And though he’d felt nervous getting on behind Harry as they stood out on the pitch ten minutes ago, staring up at the goalposts fifty feet in the air which had, at some point, come to symbolise all the good of his childhood, he’d known he needed this.

“When?” he managed to croak out feebly.
“Selective hearing,” said Harry sourly. He felt his irritation mounting. “Well, bollocks to her, then. Crazy wench.”

ticked off. When Malfoy was the subject, anger was always bubbling just below the surface. This was inevitable, utterly habitual, and with good reason: Malfoy had a tendency to say the one thing that really burrowed beneath Harry’s skin and festered there. And this time, not for the first time, he’d come away from the encounter with a throbbing jaw.
Harry laughs softly and then his face is buried in the side of Draco’s neck.
Potter flipped Draco’s skirt back down and stood up from his chair, an annoyingly pleased grin on his face, mouth glistening obscenely. He skimmed his nose along Draco’s jaw, breathing hot against his neck, and for a few long minutes he didn’t say anything at all while Draco came down from his high. He dragged his lips in idle patterns across Draco’s skin, and when Draco’s breathing had returned to a semi-normal level, he kissed the corner of his mouth. Draco felt he could have died right then and been pretty much all right with that.
Draco blinked at him.
He pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s mouth and watched with his heart humming as Harry’s eyes fluttered open almost immediately.
Pansy smiled tentatively. “Is that why you like him?”
"You'll be staying in Nymphadora's room," Andromeda told Narcissa, her voice very soft. She looked nothing at all like Bellatrix at the moment. "It's just upstairs, I'll show you. And you can take a nice hot shower too, how's that, Cissy?"
Harry lets out a tortured moan and puts his fucking back into it. He feels Draco’s body tense up and clench around him and then release, nails digging into Harry’s skin, and come covers both their chests and hits Harry’s chin.
him, there was every chance in the world they’d see Harry under the desk between his thighs.
Malfoy, not Professor Sprout, is packing dirt into a pot. He lifts his hand and uses the back of his wrist to wipe away a few glistening beads of sweat on his forehead, which is creased with concentration. There’s a clump of hair hanging in front of his eyes that he seems not to notice.
The boy sneered, but after a moment or two he lowered his wand. Goyle did the same, and then Harry and Ron followed suit. He watched the boy — Ryan — until he turned away, not without shooting Draco and then Goyle a look full of loathing. His girlfriend gave Harry a slightly fearful glance.
As they were passing Flitwick’s classroom in the Charms corridor, Harry saw students filing out the door with sour looks on their faces, and given that it was eighth-year Slytherins and Ravenclaws, he ascertained he would be wearing a similar expression when he left Charms tomorrow sagging under what he was certain would be another mountain of homework.

“I wouldn’t know, would I?” Draco drawled, lifting a sardonic eyebrow. “Seeing as you always managed to get to it first.”
. "I'm gonna go hit the pitch. I'll see you later on, then?"
Draco nodded mildly. After a moment, with his gaze in his lap, he said, "I miss my father."
Harry’s sentence broke off when Malfoy pushed the larger boy’s chest in response to the wand that was being held on him, though it didn’t do much more than startle the other Slytherin and put an angrier look on his face. “Well I
“Good,” Draco says and kisses his cheek once again. His touchy-feeliness is one of Harry’s very favourite things about Draco when he smokes. It’s like he can’t help it. “I’m gonna get some lemonade actually, do you want anything, love?”
“That depends on what I find out.”
Find me at
Scarves refastened around their necks and cloaks done up to the last button, Ron convinced Harry to stop at Honeydukes one last time before they left so he could buy a couple Chocolate Frogs, and it was as they were heading towards the road which would lead them back to Hogwarts that Harry’s eyes landed magnetically on a familiar blond head of hair coming out of Gladrags. Malfoy didn’t appear to notice Harry; he was walking beside Pansy Parkinson, wrapped up in a Slytherin-green scarf, what appeared to be dragon-hide gloves, and a set of earmuffs that matched the scarf. Harry quelled a nearly-overwhelming urge to go over there and cup his cheeks, pink from the cold, and kiss him breathless; even worse, to grab one of those leather-clad hands and walk down Hogsmeade’s High Street like one of those stupid, lovesick couples Harry sometimes saw wandering out of Madam Puddifoot’s.
It's all the evidence he needs to know he's right, Harry's dating her, or at least well enough on the way.
“It’s not as simple as that.”
So what in Salazar’s name was this, then? He knew Weasley had punched Potter a couple months ago over this whole thing but Potter had apparently neglected to mention the two of them had reached an understanding about it.
Not ten minutes later, Draco looked up to find Potter walking his way, and Draco had his wand out in a flash. Potter stopped immediately, but he didn’t even make a move for his wand. This made Draco feel like screaming.

He woke to someone shaking him; he shot up and started fumbling for his wand before he remembered there was no danger. Heart hammering, he lay back down, fumbled his cock back into his boxers, and covered his face with his hands, trying to force away the memory of waking in the forest after his brief trip to limbo, the smell of leaves and dirt and blood. When he took his hands away he looked over at Draco, who was watching him from a sitting position. He’d put his clothes back on but hadn’t bothered to button his shirt, so his scars remained visible. Harry stared at them, and then lifted his gaze to Draco’s face.
“Why did you do it?” Potter asks. Draco hates him for it. He lowers his head and closes his eyes and pictures him, the Snatcher, sagging near-lifelessly against the cheerless stone wall of the manor’s dungeons, no longer pleading, barely alive. He thinks
“Well that’s weird,” says Malfoy, turning now to the large basin behind him with a tap over it. He turns it on and runs his hands under the water, sloshing it up his arms to get rid of the dirt covering them. The smudge on his face remains, though. “I thought I made it very clear how much I loved Herbology all those times we hung out in school.”
"Potter, people won't like seeing you around me."
Before he can answer, Harry leans down and kisses him, slow and soft and sweet, and he pulls back just as Draco gets his hands on Harry’s face and opens his mouth.

done; but finally, on the first of September, just four months after that bloody battle which had only solidified what seemed to be the eternal glory of one Harry James Potter (whether he liked it or not), those meetings and interviews and photographs were left behind at King’s Cross, on the pavement of platform nine and three-quarters.
Harry looped an arm around Malfoy’s thigh, using the leverage to hold him down, and stilled his fingers deep inside his arse, rubbing relentlessly against his prostate. Malfoy’s back tried to arch off the sofa only to be held in place by Harry, a moan ripping savagely from his throat as his body convulsed through what looked like an immensely powerful orgasm, ropes of come shooting out of his twitching prick and landing on his chest and his chin. Harry pumped his fingers through it, slowing down as Malfoy’s body first relaxed and then began trembling.
"But, Professor —"
“I’d never let you fall.”

But Harry’s inherently noble nature was shining through the playfulness now. He looked highly conflicted.

Draco swatted Harry’s chest. Harry laughed and grabbed his hand, threading their fingers together.
It’s hard to hear, only Draco doesn’t know why. His chest hurts, not because it's bad but because it's too good. It's more than he deserves, really.

as pointy when he wasn't a bloke, it wasn't the same. No offence, Malfoy, but I prefer you this way."
Still, interview after meeting after press conference after interview became tiresome, particularly to a boy who had never appreciated the spotlight in the first place. Yet Harry endured it, because that was what he did. That was what he had

He took Adrian into greenhouse three, and while he was trimming a small pile of flowers off one of the Moly plants he heard the door open and turned, eyebrows lifted, to see Harry walking in. There was a frown on his face and in the crease of his brow. Someone else might not have been able to see the extremely veiled suspicion in his eyes but Draco saw it just fine.
Draco let out a shaky breath. Caught red-handed, indeed.
"You're just laughing in my ear."
“Merlin,” Draco breathed.
He pulled out and then pushed in again just as slowly, giving him time to get used to the sensation. Malfoy's fingers gradually relaxed where he had them digging into his own thigh on one hand and into Harry's shoulder on the other. He was watching the movement of Harry's finger raptly, lifting his eyes every now and then to Harry's face and looking at him like he couldn't believe he was seeing him.
Harry broke into laughter, too amused to be embarrassed at having been called out.
“I’m sorry,” Pansy said, cutting him off. He stopped with his mouth still half-open and saw a blush staining her cheeks. “That is, I … I should have let you explain things to me instead of …” She trailed off, looking hopeless in a way he didn’t usually see her. Pansy might have been on the lower end of the intelligence quota, but she’d been raised never to appear at such a loss for words. The fact that she was now said what her words could not.
Since the day Potter had eaten him out, the most they did was steal quick kisses when they got the chance, and on Wednesday nights spent long hours snogging one another breathless in the empty classroom. Potter was being unbearably gentlemanly about the whole thing, never pushing for more, always letting Draco lead the pace.
Harry showered and brushed his teeth and got into bed in Andromeda's guest bedroom. He was half-asleep when Draco finally came into the room, took off his clothes, and got in beside him. Even in a strange bed in a home that wasn't theirs, it felt normal.
Draco shrugged. Harry thought it meant yes.
“I’ll just bloody leave then, shall I?! Since you’d so much rather flirt blatantly with Harry fucking Potter in front of me!”

a person can be so disruptive,” said Draco when the greenhouse was cleared out and Harry stepped inside.
"Yeah," he said. "No, we haven't. I mean, I was ... waiting for you, I s'pose." He set the parchment down and sat up, giving Draco his full attention. Draco felt slightly queasy, as if he'd found himself standing at the edge of ship, contemplating jumping into the water and not entirely sure why. "D'you wanna talk about it then?" Harry prompted.
It looked just as it always had.
The sun hasn’t even risen yet.
Draco eyed him for a moment, hands still resting on his belly. “Yes. Penbroke — my Healer — said it would be best to stay in this body for a few months so I can … that is, so I would be able to —”

“You don’t have to be a broken person, Draco,” says Potter. His voice is like honey; it makes the words sound sweet and tempting, but Draco knows better.
“Oh, Harry,” she breathed, taking it with wide, warmth-filled eyes. “Did you get it for Malfoy?”
. Both times you ignored me."
. I always have. I still … I mean, it’s hard not to want that, y’know?”
“I’m yours,” he repeated, nails digging into Harry’s arm when he squeezed over his cock again.
him when they were together; even if he hadn’t had a penchant for pushing Draco up against walls and snogging the life out of him, Draco thought all that inadvertent touching would have left him wet and wanting all by itself. He remembered all too clearly the way Potter’s hands had felt holding him down on the bed, skimming across his chest, gripping his thighs. The warm presence of his hand on his lower back when he’d been thinking of a good memory to conjure up a Patronus, his breath on his skin.
“Yes, I did”, Teddy said, louder this time. “But I didn’t mean to, honestly! I just stumbled upon them and… and… I picked them up and started reading them. But I wasn’t planning on reading them though! Please Haz, I don’t want them to take me away from you and Dray. I can’t lose you too…”
"Those were different times!" Hermione shot back. "Honestly, wouldn't you do the same if your family was being threatened by some dark wizard who wants to take over the world?"
confused.
Harry eyed the girl sitting next to him, though he had to squint his eyes slightly to actually focus on her.
Draco nodded, though he couldn't bring himself to look at her. He felt ashamed. He had made a complete fool out of himself, crying like a bloody baby and over what? People standing a little too close to him?
As if feeling what he was thinking, Luna said, "You don't
He stepped out of Draco’s embrace. But before he could go inside Draco stopped him. “Wait! Harry, I…”
Cold, blue eyes stared back at him. "We don't want you here, Harry", Ron said, his voice as chillingly cold as his eyes.
"Oh yes, my boy -" Godric huffed sadly "- almost every night. I used to wake up screaming bloody murder and sweating like a pig, completely disoriented."
He huffed in exasperation and tried to look over the heads of the students to find the culprit of this stupidly unnecessary gathering.
Yes, moving to France was definitely one of the best decisions he had made. Well, he and Draco had made the decision together.
“Don’t.” Draco held up a finger, pointing it threateningly in Harry’s direction. “At least we use Silencing Charms.”
know was that he truly enjoyed the blond's company. Perhaps a little too much even, seeing as Harry had caught himself thinking about Draco on multiple occasions, though he would rather die than admit it out loud.
The laughter died from his lips when he saw the serious expression in her eyes.
But even now... With that whole reoccurring dream about the Weasleys not wanting him anymore...
Smiling widely, Harry nodded his head. “Absolutely”, he said, “You’re not the only one getting tired of having to listen to our neighbour’s apparently very active sex life every morning
Draco peered up at the sky.
Awoken by the noise of the students in the corridor, Pansy lifted her head from Blaise's shoulder and glared daggers at the door. "Why can't I have a nice and peaceful nap for once?" she grumbled, already starting to get up and tell them to bugger off. "Some people need their beauty sleep."
“I’m still not sure I understand what you’re talking about.”
Harry's head fell against Draco's shoulder, his breathing becoming even more regular as he closed his eyes.
Harry didn't do any of that with Ron or Hermione, let alone with any of his other friends - even the mere thought of him doing any of that with Neville made him shiver unpleasantly.
Strong arms wrapped around him, the comforting scent of Harry’s shampoo filling his nose. “You’re not alone, Draco. You will always have a family.”

Ron, who had already made his way to the door, stopped and turned around, hesitating for a moment. "Are you sure you're okay, mate?" he asked, worry clearly audible in his voice - Harry cringing slightly at that. "I can wait if you want. I'm sure 'Mione will understand if we expla-"
As Harry bent over to retrieve his fallen tie from the ground, he groaned loudly. His brain once again seemed to make an attempt to break free from his skull.
"Harry? Are you even listening?" Ron asked from the armchair next to his.
“It’s not like I have much of a choice”, Harry said, shrugging.
"Thank you", Harry whispered when Draco stood back up from retrieving his broom.

Hiding the emotions - and slightly rising panic - behind his mask of indifference, Draco sighed and ran a hand through his loose, blond hair.
A knowing look crossed Harry’s face and he took one of Draco’s hands in his.
Also, I'm on
Rolling his eyes, Draco replaced Teddy’s small star-shaped hat on his messy, blond hair, charming it to not fall off that easily. “Alright then”, he said, a tender smile dancing around his lips. “I think it’s time we should go to the Burrow.”
It had quickly become an unspoken tradition to spend their Saturday afternoon down there with friends. Even some lowers years, who had friends amongst the Eighth Years, were present from time to time.
during the chase of some drug-selling wizard – not to mention the juicy gossips that went around the Ministry about the daughter of some high-ranked Pureblood git who had run off to marry a Muggle in
The people around them who were listening to the conversation nodded their heads.
Harry nodded slowly, processing the words. "It's not like I've been a saint either", he said.
Draco raised an eyebrow in question, concern flashing through his eyes before it disappeared again, hidden behind his mask of indifference.
try to keep this quill. "Don't worry", he said, his green eyes twinkling slightly. "Go on now before you miss Potions. We all know your Slughorn's favourite."
The sudden sound of someone sniffling filled the otherwise silent corridor.
She had checked the library where Draco had told her Harry would be, but when she had arrived, he wasn't there... What if something had happened to him?
He never understood why people could be so happy on such an awful day like this. The 31st of October... He absolutely despised that day.
A menacing smile crept onto his snake-like features as Lily didn't move a muscle. "Well then...", he began, tilting his head slightly. "Seeing as you don't want to cooperate, there is only one way to solve this." He sighed dramatically, fake remorse written all over his face. "I have given you a fair chance, young lady. But you've chosen to waste it."
"Could you
"Mr. Potter, where have you been all this time?"
The rather big portrait was only occupied with one person: a lady clad in a beautiful, dark blue dress with bronze jewellery adorning her neck and ears. Her long jet black hair was pinned back with blue flowers. She smiled as she saw the group of students stop in front of the portrait, lowering the big, floating book she had been reading before.
Rolling his eyes, Malfoy handed him a fancy-looking, brown quill. The feather gleamed gold in the morning sun coming through the vast window. "You're lucky I always have some spare quills", Malfoy said, stepping out of the room.
"I'm sorry!" Harry exclaimed, his green eyes pleading. "I didn't-"
It happened every 19 years.
And Draco... Draco was
"I don't like the way her fellow Slytherin friends are looking this way", he explained, averting his gaze. "I don't trust them, Dray. You should be careful around them."
He had to share a dorm room with none other than Draco bloody Malfoy.
"Don't worry too much, Hermione", came a whisper from next to her as the brunette felt a hand being placed on her arm. "He'll be alright."
Harry didn't answer, still rummaging through his glass bottles, searching for the right vial.
Harry rushed to the family he called his own and dropped down on his knees next to Fred. Tears were already streaming down his face.
But here he was. Ready to start a new life. Ready for a little bit of change.
“I love you”, Teddy mumbled. “And I’m sorry for reading those books even though I knew I wasn’t supposed to.”
He shouldn't have come back. He wasn't ready for this yet.
A comforting hand was placed on his knee. "Tell me what's troubling you, Harry?"
“I could say the same thing about you”, Draco managed to say between gasps and moans.
"You know", she continued, "Now that I think about it, Draco might actually be the solution to get rid of all those Wrackspurts flying around you. They're clearly clouding your mind more and more."
Of course, he wasn't going to tell them that; just like he wasn't planning on telling them how he had been feeling over the last month. They didn't need yet another concern to be added to their already long lists of tasks they were expected to do since they had become Head Boy and Girl. They were busy enough as it was. The last thing Harry wanted, was to be a burden to them; to anyone, really...
And apparently, as it so seemed to be, that was the last little push Draco needed before he tumbled off the edge.
"Ladies and gentlemen, he has done it again!", Seamus' amplified voice echoed around the pitch. "Harry Potter has caught the Snitch once again! The Eighth Years have won the game with 220-30!"
Harry narrowed his eyes at the Slytherin, a playful yet determined smirk placed on his face. "Pfft, you wish, Malfoy."
Yes, he had had quite a few conversations with the man and he had actually got to know a lot about who Godric had been as a person, but perhaps this topic was becoming a little too... personal. They had only really talked about simple things like classes or even the weather. Not things like... this.
Or maybe something had happened to him?
. Ginny had every right to be mad at him.
Nuzzling his face deeper into the crook of Astoria's neck, Draco sighed as her arms tightened around him. "Thank you, Tori."
As he was once again lost in his own thoughts, he hadn't noticed Malfoy trying to get his attention. Only when he felt a gentle hand on his shoulder, did he manage to snap free, flinching away from the touch. "Hm, what?"
started the whole thing? After all, who - in their righteous mind - would believe Death Eater scum like himself?
stupid. "You
They had all noticed the antagonistic stares and whispers that were sent his way when they walked through the corridors of the castle. Sometimes a few students would even go as far as to throw a mild stinging hex his way.
He shook his head, starting to make his way through the maze of corridors in the castle. Maybe he could clear his head if he took a stroll around. Maybe his thoughts would finally leave him alone after that.
Harry stared at Draco, racking his brain for a believably answer. He could easily say he was fine; he had done it a thousand times before. But something told him that Draco wouldn't believe him. Especially not after what had happened earlier.
"I still can't believe I actually agreed to go back to Hogwarts for a
But now - as he was sitting in his armchair in the common room - he asked himself if he actually still could manage on his own. He was extremely sleep deprived and with the amount of homework assignments the teachers kept giving them, he never went to bed early either.
"Ginny I-", he started to say, but she held up her hand to prevent him from saying anything else.
If only he had been a little faster...
Ron nodded. "I know, but I want everyone who wants a position to at least have a week's time to practice since I'm sure a lot of you haven't really played much Quidditch last year."
"Did you find a solution, Sir?" he eventually decided to ask, biting his lip nervously.
Seeing his godson so sad made Harry’s chest tighten painfully. He hated seeing Teddy like that. The boy didn’t deserve to be sad.
She looked to her left and was met by the icy blue eyes of Pansy Parkinson staring worriedly into her own.
"I said I was sorry", Malfoy repeated, taking a seat on the edge of his own bed.
be someone present after the incident with Neville.
The blond shrugged. "Don't worry about it, Blaise", he said. "I'll be just fine." Though he wasn't so sure about his words.
"Okay," Draco continued, "I want you to listen to my voice and do as I say. Do you think you'll manage to do that, Harry?"
Malfoy huffed, running a hand through his hair before staring back at his reflection, his wand now safely tucked away in one of his robe pockets. "Anyway," he said, "what are you still doing here? Breakfast is almost over and classes are about to start."
It sounded like someone was crying, quiet sobs filling the otherwise silent corridor. But why would somebody be crying in the cold corridors at this ungodly hour of the night? It couldn't be Moaning Myrtle; she hardly left her bathroom...
Blinking away the tears, Draco smiled. “Alright,” he said, “I can do that.”
"So?" Harry asked. "I could've eaten in the kitchens and you wouldn't know that."
Most Eighth Years nodded or murmured a
Harry could see the colour shine brightly under Draco’s touch as he moved it around Harry’s shoulders. It was only then Harry realised the fabric wasn’t just fabric – or even a curtain. Honestly, he should have known better. Draco loved making costumes. So, to presume this year their costume would simply be a shirt with a pair of trousers was just ridiculous.
Harry felt his own cheeks reddening under the scrutinising gaze of the Slytherin in front of him - whose wrist he was still holding, by the way.
The Eighth Year table.
His ears were ringing loudly, his grip on his broom tightening as his hands trembled violently.
With a small, fond smile on his lips, Harry crawled off the bed and stalked towards Draco, wrapping his arms around the other man’s waist as soon as he was close enough. He pulled Draco flush against his body, their foreheads touching. “You’re going to be such a good father when we get our own child one day”, he whispered, one of his hands coming up to cup one of Draco’s cheeks.
That morning, it had taken him quite some time to find the strength and willpower to get out of bed. By the time he had arrived at his first class of the day, all Eighth Years were already packing away their stuff to leave for the next lesson.
After all, Luna had been the only one to know the truth so far and Harry had hoped she would stay the only one for a little longer. It had already been hard enough to tell one person, although he didn't regret telling her, but still...
Was he really willing to go back so soon? Did he really want to drown in the attention people would give him all over again? Was he ready to face his friends again, knowing how disappointed - and probably furious - they were about him not telling them where he was?
Draco nodded, though his smile suddenly disappeared, a serious look taking its place. “Of course, if you’re too scared of the Thunder Gods coming to get you, we can stay home and simply watch an uhm… what do Muggles call it again? You know, that thing with the moving pictures?” He looked at Harry for help.
His own sentence consisted of him finishing his education at Hogwarts under condition that he didn't use any offensive spells without permission of the Ministry. They promised to keep a very close eye on him. Even after Hogwarts he was certain they wouldn't let him out of their sight that easily. After all, he
The Weasleys had clearly never seen him as one of their own, and they never would either.
Ginny half-tripped, half-sat down on the ground, bumping her head against Luna's shoulder. With a glare directed at the tree root that had clearly offended her, she grabbed one of Luna's hands in her own and entwined their fingers - much the same as his and Draco’s had done earlier that day.
He loved how the branches hid him from sight. That way he could concentrate on his essays without being disturbed. He also loved the serenity the old tree seemed to emanate. It made him more relaxed than he had been for quite some time, effectively shutting out his horrible thoughts.
The Siren nodded.
A small round of congratulations went around the room. Ron smiled widely, thanking everyone.
“Yes, a crown, darling. You seem to be a bit slow on the uptake today. Should I spell it out for you?”
Draco moaned loudly as Harry trailed slow, open-mouthed kisses down Draco’s jawline and neck, his teeth nibbling here and there on the soft, delicate skin to leave a slight mark and their hips grinding together shamelessly.
Dean snatched his hand away, standing up from the chair and glaring at Seamus. "You didn't mean it?! Well, it sure as hell sounded like you did! You know I don't like it when you talk about that!" he exclaimed, his hands flailing around wildly. "You have no idea what I've had to endure in those months I've been on the run! The things that have happened are no things to joke about! And you bloody well know that. We've talked about it enough for you to remember." He turned around and went to walk to his room, but a hand wrapped itself around his wrist, pulling him back until he rested against Seamus' lean chest.
and the villagers: a sacrifice in return for keeping the small village safe from any harm.
. She entered the common room, the students following silently.
"Well then, Potter", Malfoy said as he walked to the door and opened it. "I'll see you around, I guess."
need help", Harry growled, his temper rising with every second. He turned his head away from the girl next to him, stubbornly staring back out over the lake.
Although Harry knew he could practically tell Luna everything that was on his mind, everything that kept him awake at night, now - at that moment - he didn't feel like sharing anything with her. Actually, now that he thought about it, he really wanted to be alone...
But Harry didn't have the chance to tell her it was okay, that he had forgiven them both for leaving him long ago and he never would because this... this was all just a dream, a mere figment of his imagination, an image his mind loved to torture him with.
Even now - sitting at the Eighth Year table with laughter surrounding him - he could feel the nasty looks that were sent his way. He was convinced it wouldn't take long for some students to take revenge for all the things he has done over the past years. They could easily corner him and hex him or beat him to a human pulp and he wouldn't be able to do anything about it. He couldn't defend himself - not without getting into trouble. And he surely couldn't rat them out either, since that would only cause things to get worse.
Draco had only laughed, shaking his head as he muttered something under his breath Harry couldn’t quite catch. They practiced almost every day after that. Seeing as almost no one in the village spoke English, Draco had deemed it absolutely necessary for Harry to learn French. Even if Draco had concluded Harry was a completely useless student.
"Try-outs?" Harry asked. "Aren't we with too few people to do try-outs?"
helped me in getting over a few of the things that have happened. So I thought it could help you too, since you don't want to go see and actual healer... yet."
Though who could blame him? Ron had worked his arse off over the last month to get his team in top form for the match and his efforts had clearly shown their worth.
Draco had dropped his mask. He had dropped his - normally always present - mask of indifference; he had lowered his defences, and Harry... Harry had the privilege to see that. He had the privilege to finally see Draco without any pretences, without even any resemblance of the arrogant 'Malfoy mask' as Harry liked to call it.
Harry already knew what was going to happen though. He had relived this countless of times and although he really didn't want to see it again, he couldn't seem to look away. In fact, he couldn't move at all. He was stuck to watch it all play out in front of his eyes... again.
From that day on, he had promised her to try and not be late again and he had yet to break that promise.
"Ginny?" Harry asked, a knowing smirk lifting one corner of his mouth.
Grimacing, Draco shook his head. “You’re an absolute sap.” He ignored Harry’s lips curling into one of those far too smug smiles. “It’s disgusting.”
Before Harry could answer, she turned away from him to face the ocean, her hand falling from his shoulder as she did so.
“Yes, okay, I get it”, Draco said, pointedly ignoring the pleased smirk that had crossed Harry’s face. “Though we really ought to go now if we don’t want to make it too late.” He stepped towards the fireplace, taking a handful of Floopowder. “Because of Teddy, of course.”
When she had given it back to him, Harry had thanked her once again, offering her his help whenever she would need it. She had shaken her head, a fond smile playing around her lips before saying,
Harry’s mouth dropped open in a satisfying display of disbelief. Somewhere underneath the thick haze of lust in his head, Draco was able to feel immensely pleased by his ability to keep Harry on his toes even now, even like this.
This was how Draco had begun spending time with the Golden Trio. There were two upsides to this so far, one being that both Granger and Weasley were aware of the pregnancy, and therefore Draco didn’t have to mind what he said in front of them.

"Potter," he breathes raggedly. The hand on his neck tightens for a second, just a
McGonagall gave a long speech that was at times sombre but ended on a hopeful note, and after a feast in the Great Hall that followed there was a student-organised party in the Gryffindor common room that lasted well into the night. With all the other students having left that morning on the train they managed to fit the entire graduating class and it was like nothing Harry had ever seen. At some point he found Seamus and Parvati snogging.
Harry was startled into a laugh, and he even heard a small, undeniably
Around nine, after a round of lazy and satisfying morning sex, they went to the Great Hall for breakfast and found Ron and Hermione just getting started, with Goyle and Daphne across from them, all at the Gryffindor table. Ernie and Hannah were at the Gryffindor table too with Neville, and Neville was speaking to Goyle.
“You can have one too, Potter. All you have to do is grow a pair of tits and they’ll move you into one overnight.”
Another detention seemed prudent.
“That would
Of course, that hadn’t been why Draco had done it. He’d chickened out at the last second. He hadn’t stopped ruminating over the things he’d said — the things he’d
why you like him?”
"No, he's just ... lost right now," said Malfoy. "It'll be fine, he'll get past it. I'm much more worried about everyone else."
It was a phrase he absolutely could not unstick from the inside of his head. Was he floundering? It seemed almost as though the war itself had been a spectacular tsunami, washing over everything Harry had ever known — but on the other side, in the aftermath, he looked around and saw that everyone else had dried off and begun rebuilding their lives. Everyone except Harry, whose clothes were still dripping wet.
"What the hell?" he said, reaching down to rub it. "That fucking
Harry shook his head. Shrugged. “I died,” he said. He blinked down at Malfoy, his red lips, his flushed cheeks, the ash in his white hair and his cold grey eyes — which, actually, were a bit less frosty than usual at the moment. One might even have ventured to say that looked quite warm right now. “I
to stand for and failed miserably.
“You’re not even dressed,” says Draco. He’s still wearing his sweats and a loose T-shirt (cropped, showing off his navel and the tantalising line of his hips leading below the trousers, which always makes Harry feel distinctly weak and useless and horny); the skimpy outfit is the last thing he’ll put on before they leave in a few hours. Harry isn’t usually the world’s biggest fan of clubs like the one they’re going to, but being that it’s Halloween and Draco’s dressing like some kind of sexy slutty witch looking to get fucked in a shadowy corner, he’s willing to make the sacrifice tonight.
“Right. I just meant … I really do have feelings for you, Draco. Like … mad, crazy feelings, y’know? I don’t want it to be a fling.”
Happy New Year! ❤️
“I’m not angry at you,” Harry said firmly, holding Ron’s gaze, hoping the sincerity in his eyes would convey to Ron that he was telling the truth. “And of course I trust you. It’s … complicated, is all.”
The professors didn't seem to think that defeating Voldemort was a good reason to give Harry a break, which left him exactly as bogged down by homework as the rest of his year mates, and for about a week he stopped thinking about Malfoy and Goyle and that whole situation entirely. It was madness, really, the amount of essays piling up every day, and among all the eighth-years it seemed only to be Hermione who was managing to keep up, no doubt thanks to her colour-coded schedule nobody else had the patience for.
Malfoy breathed in deeply and then let it out as a slightly shaky breath. He nodded. Harry leaned forwards and attached their mouths again, hands going back to his jumper, which he pulled over Malfoy's head along with his night shirt underneath it. He was able to get a better look this time, tracing his fingers along the thickest scar on Malfoy's chest, the one that must have been the deepest. There were four others, long, hectic, jagged white lines cutting across otherwise perfect skin.
But then Potter's shaking his head, back to normal.
“You forgot the most important part,” he said after a moment. Harry looked at him in question. “They’re birds. They can fly. If you can fly, no one can ever trap you.”
relationship. Maybe it isn’t so surprising that when he suddenly looks like a very pretty girl, you might — erm — respond to that intensity in a way you wouldn’t have done before. When he looked like a boy.”
"Wasn't talking to you!" he snapped at her.
about doing it again, I’ll make sure you’re expelled. Do you believe me?”
He leaves. As he does, the sky opens up and more rain starts falling, first in slow, fat drops and then all at once. He lowers his head and lets it soak him, imagining his sins washing away with the water.
the first time they’d ever ordered alcohol at a pub, and Harry and Ron both grinned rather stupidly as they carried them back to a table. With November drawing to a close, Christmas decorations had gone up, and several large, ornamented trees dotted the room, sparkling festively.
He pushed in farther this time, dropping his jaw open and pressing his tongue as deeply inside as it could go. He felt Malfoy clenching spasmodically around the wet muscle as he fucked him with it, his hands now gripping his thighs both to assist in holding himself open and because Harry could see them there. Saliva dripped copiously out of the corners of his mouth and slicked Malfoy’s arse, making the slide easier and loosening him by degrees.
“Unlikely,” Draco intoned, eyebrow raised. A thought, however, came unbidden into his mind. He hesitated before saying it out loud. “We could go to the real one, though.”
“Thanks,” Harry chuckled. “It’s, er,
“God, you look so fucking good like this, Malfoy,” Potter ground out between gasping breaths, nails digging harder into Draco’s head, giving him only short interludes to draw breath before he was fucking into him again, leaving Draco’s jaw aching and his lips swollen.

"I mean, she isn't wrong," Harry allowed, "but you still don't have to
“What?” he said abruptly, brows creasing. “What is it? What just happened?”
"Who, Melanie?" Weasley scoffs. "The one from my birthday? Don't be stupid, Malfoy, he'll be finished with that in another week at most."
?” said Potter, eyebrows raised in such a way that – probably intentionally – made Draco feel as if he’d just overreacted.
Harry kissed him again, slowly, and as he did he pulled his hips back, slipping his cock out of Draco’s hole. Draco felt what was sure to be the rest of Harry’s come start dribbling out of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione's internship at the Ministry had turned into a real job and Harry thought it was likely she and Ron would start trying for a baby themselves as soon as they felt settled. It was strange, really, to realise they'd made it to a point in their lives where that was a possibility, instead of just a bleak hope for the future if they ever managed to get rid of Voldemort.
“I was hungry,” Harry said, looking for all the world like this was an innocent answer. Draco, on the other hand, felt the blush all the way down his neck deepen. “And I had a promise to keep.”
they’re angry at me,” he snapped, spinning around to face her. “I think they’re trying to save their own skins, same as I would if I wasn’t the one with the tarnished surname and a Dark Mark. The Notts are hardly any better off than my family is, and if Theo wants any hope at all of earning respect back within the Wizarding community he knows perfectly well he can’t be friendly with me.
"Jesus, Draco," Harry said, grimacing. "Please, just — god, don't say things like that."
something for me?”
— when Potter gripped his thighs and pulled him closer to the edge of the desk. Instead of pulling the knickers aside, he now hooked his fingers in the waistband and dragged them slowly and carefully down Draco’s legs. The air was cool on his pussy, glistening wet where Potter had spread his juices around, and Draco whimpered when he felt Potter’s hot breath on the inside of his thigh. Tentatively, he let himself push his fingers through Potter’s hair, watching with utter fascination as his mouth sucked bruising kisses into Draco’s skin, taking his time, letting the fire in Draco’s belly build, until it was all Draco could do not to moan pitifully, right out loud, the moment he finally felt the slick heat of Potter’s tongue delve between his pussy lips and lick a fat stripe up to his clit.
After running to the toilet and seeing that there didn’t seem to be any blood anywhere, he returned to his bed with his heart in his throat. He hadn’t the first clue how menstruation worked, when he would start bleeding, how he should deal with it when he did. Yet he was reluctant to bring it up to Pansy — he didn’t think he could bear it. Not yet. Anyway, she was still being cross with him for snapping at her on Monday. Only a Slytherin, he marveled, could hold a petty grudge with so much determination.
"Of course, Albus," she said.
“There was a … complication.”
, Draco. Not an
To his credit, Weasley controlled the expressions that passed across his face. They were still there, but subdued. First shock, then disbelief. Shock again. His mouth opened and closed. More shock, and finally, some strange sort of tentative acceptance. “The Healers told you this?”

Potter rolled his eyes. Draco wanted to punch him.

Theo already saw Potter stick a wand in his throat and tell him to stay away from me. I
“He wasn’t insulting your family, Malfoy!” Weasley shouted, then looked around, alarmed by his own outburst. When it was clear they hadn’t been heard, he rounded on Draco again, this time in a hissing whisper. “He was
“I must not tell lies,” he said, and Draco looked up at him with a furrowed brow. “That’s what it says. ‘I must not tell lies.’”
It should have been irritating, the audacity Harry had to push his fingers back inside of Draco’s sore hole — except that instead of irritating it was
Draco began pulling his things out of his bag when he remembered the book he’d left lying in the corridor back where he’d been assaulted, and there wasn’t a snowball’s chance in hell he was going back to retrieve it. Not alone, anyway, and he would have died before telling Pansy or Blaise what had happened.
Draco's heart gives a funny thud and there's a small contraction in his stomach as he looks up into Harry's eyes and sees the open uncertainty there. The pleading, the hopefulness. He
"Nothing happened!"
“No, no, I’m sorry, my name’s Adrian, Adrian Fishbrook, I’m the new Arithmancy professor,” he said, holding a hand out which Harry took with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “It’s really good to meet you. How’s the investigation going, down in Hogsmeade?”
“Just because he’s got magic coming out of his ears and
Likely not, as Boothby kept right on going, and the rest of them continued to raise their hands and ask questions just as if Potter was an exhibit they’d borrowed from a museum to discuss in class.
He stared at her, then let his gaze drop to his wine again. Had he?
“Do you still hate it?” Harry breathed. Malfoy’s eyebrows dipped. “The scar?”
, you know, been wearing it at night, you can keep it. I don’t mind.”
He heard Harry breathe out heavily, arms tightening around Draco’s middle. Part of him felt undeserving of the affection — another part of him thought he’d completely unravel without it.
At a quarter past one in the morning, as Harry closed the curtains of his four-poster and lay his head down on the pillow, he thought again of Malfoy, and wondered if Madam Pomfrey had cured him yet.
“Why did you ask me to come out here with you, Potter?”
“I have to graduate, Theo,” he said tightly. “I can’t stay there forever. But if you absolutely
“You can’t just interrupt my lessons, Potter,” said Draco, slipping off his gloves and going to the box to set them down in it on top of the others. It was a haphazard mess, but that was what he got for teaching children.
"Sorry," he said, sitting down next to him, "wasn't trying to be. Is it your mum you're writing to?"
"Nah, you won't." Harry moved back finally though and in a swift motion lifted his shirt off and then unzipped his flies, though that was all he did. A wandless spell was murmured then and suddenly Draco felt Harry's fingers, cool and slick with lube, delving between his arse cheeks and sliding over his hole.
“Are you serious?” Potter croaked. The hunger in his eyes was worth every humiliating thought Draco had suffered while putting it on that morning.
jumpy today. I think the lack of Quidditch is catching up to you finally — you always had a way of letting out energy when you had practise.”
getting hurt. He’s dealing with enough without me using him to figure out how I feel. Or my ... sexuality, or whatever.”
Draco held his gaze a moment, and finally, with a terse nod of acquiescence, turned on his heel and set off for Transfiguration with Theo behind him, keeping a distance.

“Then yes.”
Yet another birthday drabble for
Harry tilted Malfoy’s face up, the pad of his thumb pressed to the apple of one warm cheek.
“It’s where the curse hit,” he said quietly, a little breathless by the sight of it. Malfoy prodded gently and Harry drew in a breath, it
“Yeah,” said Harry, nodding. He didn’t elaborate, for it felt to him like this might be one of those times where he didn’t

that was supposed to be that she was talking to.
“D’you know how long we slept?”
"No! No, we're not!"
When they returned home to Grimmauld Place Ron and Hermione had gotten Leo back from the Weasleys' and Draco held his son for the first time in his real body.
Harry's stomach dropped and he turned to look at Draco in shock. His cheeks were flushed and his eyes were shining and he didn't look embarrassed in the least. He brought a hand to Draco's cheek and kissed him, first on the lips and then the cheek, back to his ear.
Harry turned his head and looked at Draco, who looked back at him from his armchair and smiled beautifully.
had been there all this time. He passed his fingers across them, enamored, and when Draco pressed back into the touch his arse rubbed against Harry's cock.
. He’d never known Malfoy could be this soft. “I had no idea — I was coming to see Sprout, you’re not …?”
"Well that's good," said Pomfrey, "that's very good. That jinx ate right through most of your skin, it's a good thing Miss Granger thought to knock you out. It'll be a bit of a rough night ahead of you but you'll be fine by morning." She set a potion down on his bedside, caught sight of the apprehension on his face, and he swore he saw her mouth twitch with a smile. "It's not nearly as bad as Skele-Gro," she said. "Skin is much easier regrown than bones."
When he broke away, he said against Draco’s lips, “Like my fingers, do you?”
Draco shrugged but found a smile for him. “The usual,” he said evasively. Adrian seemed not to pick up on anything because he grinned sympathetically. “You?”
,” Malfoy drawled, but the pink on his cheeks remained and Harry even thought he saw a smile somewhere in there. “If you want me to vomit before we accomplish anything here then you’re on the right track.”
look?” Harry half-laughed, cigarette between his thumb and first finger as he took a long drag.
from doing anything stupid until the Cup is over.”
“Had no problem slicing me open two years ago.”
"I won't try and stop you long as it's what Draco wants," he said finally. "But I don't trust you."
"Oh," Harry said, understanding hitting him like a Bludger. He laughed incredulously. "Wait, he was a
Harry could only nod.
, regardless.” He paused a beat, and then went on, “I don’t expect the same miracle, but I’m curious what prompted Potter to put a word in for your father. You must know why he did it.”
In truth, Harry had suspected he’d have to be the one to initiate a conversation. It wasn’t as though he planned to stay in a fight with Ron forever. And although he knew Ron had his own extremely valid reasons for being upset, Harry couldn’t help feeling like his best mate had done him a disservice by blowing up before giving him a chance to explain.
"I did," says Draco. There's a light rustle as Pratchett sets the parchment down on the desk and removes his glasses, peering at Draco with those mysterious dark eyes of his that Draco can never quite get a read on. It reminds him unsettlingly of the way he'd felt whenever Dumbledore looked at him in sixth year. "It ... wasn't working out."
than good — to be back on the same page as Ron. However wonderful Malfoy might make him feel sometimes, he knew he’d never have been able to enjoy it fully if it meant losing Ron in the process. It was relief like a great, gasping breath of fresh air. “What do you mean, he won’t talk about the past?”
Leaning back over him, Harry whispered “You’re beautiful” like a secret into Malfoy’s ear, loving the way Malfoy keened underneath him. He was smiling as he buried his face in Malfoy’s neck, sucking lightly at the skin, down to his pale shoulder, a little bony and so much smaller than it had once been. Malfoy’s hands were on his back, nails digging in very slightly each time he felt Harry’s teeth.
, I'm just ... god, it never goes away. It's so
"I'm gonna get another gift later tonight, yeah?"
"Nope," he says. He reaches past Draco to grab a vial of frog spawn, coming much too close, and Draco has to covertly hold his breath because he knows how Potter smells and it's too dangerous to breathe him in at this proximity. "Oh, but I have been meaning to tell you," he adds suddenly, settling that heavy gaze on Draco with one hand on the door, "Daphne calls me Harry."
Harry doesn't press it. He searches Draco's face another moment before leaning down to kiss him and then pulling out. The air has shifted a little from the heady playfulness of just minutes before, but maybe that's because they're both coming down from their highs. Or perhaps because he'd been unable to say 'I love you' ... either one, surely. Harry gets up and pulls on his pants, carding his fingers through his hair and grabbing his glasses off the bed. Then he spells them both clean.
With his whole body thrumming, roaring in exaltation, he lunges forward and he kisses Potter. Messily, gratefully, prayerfully, urgently. Potter grabs his face and kisses him back and more thunder rips the air apart. Then Draco’s on his back in the wet grass and Potter’s body takes the brunt of the downpour, and all Draco can smell is rain and Harry.
it," Malfoy huffed, his cheeks a bit pink. With frustration, maybe. Or maybe something else. "I've never seen anything so defiant."
“Think what you want,” he said, puffing on the end of his cigarette and letting a lazy trail of smoke out from between his full lips. Harry was visited by a sudden, powerful urge to lick inside Malfoy’s mouth and taste the acrid, bitter tobacco on his tongue. “I would never pay you a compliment, Potter — it would give me
* * *
“I pride myself on it.” He squirmed a bit in Harry’s lap. “Think you could tell me what you need to talk to me about now?”
Harry grinned. “Deal.”
Coming from Potter, Draco’s instinctive urge was to snap in response, and he had to fight it back.
Another, longer pause. “Fine,” Malfoy said suddenly, and Harry nearly whooped with enthusiasm. He could plainly see Malfoy holding back a smirk even as he rolled his eyes to the ceiling.
The ball was all anybody could talk about, and to Harry’s extreme frustration the fresh buzz only added to the amount of people who showed up for tryouts that afternoon. There were quite literally dozens of them, and at least a third weren’t even Gryffindors. Mostly it was girls, giggling and whispering and ogling Harry without shame. It took so long to get through it that the tryouts for the other teams had been postponed until the following weekend, and when the last person had left the field it was already nearing five o’clock. It was so silly, too, because most of the team was the same as it had been last time Harry captained them.
He doesn’t take Draco out to dinner – he forces him to go on walks where they hold hands and talk and completely arbitrarily find somewhere to eat when they feel like it, usually a dumb, cosy little diner where they can share a bench and Harry kisses him with strawberry milkshake on his tongue.
talk." Draco swallows thickly, meeting his eyes again even though it hurts. Even though he feels weak when he does it. "There's just some stuff we can't ... we can't talk about."
“What is it?” Draco said, tone clipped. It hid the way his heart was thundering in his chest. When Potter took a step closer, his rapid pulse only increased.
"I think Harry's right. If you don't mind my saying, you have always had a way with words, Professor." McGonagall's lips pursed, but Harry saw a pink tinge come over her face. "I think you should be able to remind them all quite effectively that the use of Dark Magic or indeed any spell meant to harm others will not be tolerated without mentioning Mr Malfoy by name."

"And?"
"Yeah," Harry said, glancing at a small bruise on his neck. "You're not upset, are you? That I didn't wake you up?"

The first day back at classes after the rest of the school returned, Draco did something he never would have believed of himself: he skipped the lessons he had with Potter. And not only that, but he didn’t go down to the Great Hall for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. He asked Pansy to bring him food, but it was Theo who wound up doing it. He had a knowing look on his face when he handed Draco his plate, but he said nothing, and somehow that was even more infuriating.
As soon as Slughorn left the room, Draco opened his mouth to say only Merlin knew what, but before he could, he was being swept into his mother’s arms and he felt her hot tears on his cheek. It took less than a second for him to break down as well, clutching at her robes and burying his face in her sweet-smelling neck. It was relief like he had never known it before.
"I just wanna talk to him," he said, indicating Malfoy. Malfoy was watching him with his brows drawn.
It takes a month to brew the Polyjuice Potion, and in that time Draco can only hope Daphne doesn't do anything to fuck up her ...
Draco dropped back onto the bed, mouth hanging open, cold dread creeping in and turning his blood to ice.
"You're not in trouble," she said. "I'm going to go deal with him. It seems we're going to have to address this issue with Mr Malfoy more formally ... Oh, I don't look forward to telling Filius about this ..." She walked away with a sigh and Harry finally went into the Infirmary, where he saw Malfoy lying on a bed at the far end of the wing.
“Potter,” Draco drawled, sitting primly down in his creation and pouring himself a steaming mug of tea, “just because defensive magic isn’t my forté doesn’t mean I’m not
Lips parted, hot breath echoing off the door and back into his face, Draco allowed himself to be taken apart with the same ferocious intensity he’d seen Harry use on the guitar. Each stroke brought him back to full hardness, each stab against his prostate made his nerves sing a tormented chorus, drowning out the pain of the wooden floor against his bare knees.

As an experiment, Draco chose a spot he and Potter had never used before. An unlikely spot — something that didn’t make sense, even. Somewhere Potter couldn’t just

that was going to happen.”
“Of course, Theo Nott is always leering at him these days, isn’t he?”
“What happened with Nott?” Granger asked quietly as soon as he appeared. Weasley was eyeing him impassively, but that was, Draco had to admit, a step up from revulsion. Besides, his head was throbbing and his mind was trying to sort out too many different things at once to be properly annoyed by his present company.
He acquiesced, but even as he forced himself to join in on a conversation with Pansy and Blaise, Draco’s mind never strayed far from Potter. By the end of breakfast, he’d decided he needed to talk to him, and sooner rather than later. Not to apologise —
