set foot onto the grounds again. No more Hogwarts for you, Mister!
“Good riddance,” agreed a squeaky voice from inside a pile of rubble.
Now, shortly before midnight, Hogwarts' Entrance Hall lay silent and deserted. There was no sound but the drip-drop of water from Harry's drenched clothes and the quiet snoring of his portrait on the wall.
sing you a song instead? Goes like this:
If it had been any other person, he would have thought she was having him on. Draco Malfoy scared for Harry Potter. Ha ha, what a joke, let's pull his leg and play dumb, ha ha. It was stern, no-nonsense McGonagall though. Who was regularly sharing biscuits and stories with Potter during breaks, who had no sense of humour Draco knew of, who had been Potter's Head of House for six years, who was... currently looking at him like she had absolutely no idea who Draco was talking about.
, you had to be curious. I'm coming, that's my last word.”
“Seems like we're landing soon,” said Half desperately. He shot Harry a look. “Oh, come on, Seeker, you can't be mad at us forever.”
Potter leant back with a huff. “I can't believe I missed your wedding!”
Gregory Goyle signed the self-referral form.
“It's not a joke! He's really in trouble!”
Nott cleared his throat. “I tried to make him stop drinking, but he won't listen to me. Please, he... the Goyles took me in after my father went to prison.” Draco flinched. Of course he had known of widower Mr. Nott's incarceration, but Draco had assumed his classmate would simply live alone like Draco afterwards. Now he felt guilty for not checking in on the other boy. Draco had not been a great friend lately. “I just couldn't be on my own and he felt so lonely... after Crabbe. Anyway, we're tight now, okay? You need to fix this.”
A few more seconds passed, then, almost inaudible: “Okay.”
You know, the world didn't run smoothly
“Not sure. But maybe that they're subterranean somehow? Anyway, that didn't work, so we better go on to the library and find out more about that mystery place.”
He snivelled and wiped at his face. “Are you an actual idiot? How can you just bare your heart like that when I already turned you down like a hundred times? What's with that foolhardy recklessness?”
“Just watch.” Wolfe nudged his shoulder and indicated towards Holle's dwelling Spillalutsche's Stone, which was as always bathed in the soft gleam of seven overhead-flowing little lights. From there Holle emerged as they waited, her white dress contrasting with the dark of the night.
Weasley wrinkled his nose. “The Mell?”
“Me too,” Potter agreed, which caught Hermione's interest.
he sighed and Anguis at his feet nodded.
“Yes, but I think it would be best if I went tonight to retrieve her.” Harry nodded at his own words. “I better go now.”
Planting the yellowed pages in the middle of the table, they all leant over the ancient scribbles. Next to a recipe for pumpkin pastry (in Old English but that was no problem for Pansy, she was fluent in several languages, obviously) there was a whole section of doodles depicting millinery and in one corner–
Harry did and his blond adversary landed undignified and cursing on all fours... which turned out to be a bit awkward for Harry who was presently faced with Draco Malfoy's backside pressing into his groin. He quickly tried to move away, only to find himself somewhat stuck and, losing balance, he tumbled over backwards, landing painfully on his ass.
Draco turned bright red. He must have got a sunburn. “Excuse me?! If anyone was watching anyone, it was
?” asked Draco bewildered.
Pig made owly eyes at him.
was under the tree! I looked first thing when I got up and there it was and I know he's slow sometimes, but
The redhead leant closer to get a better look and searched the immediate area with mounting nervousness. “But that can't... Hermione, where are they?”
“Here goes nothing,” Draco muttered and rapped on the door.
Laughing happily, Harry pressed his lips to Draco's once more. “Yep, completely sure. If I'm honest, I was thinking of doing it myself, proposing. You just beat me to it.”
“Yeah, yeah,” mumbled Potter, peeved. He shifted. “So, where do you think we are?”
“Second marking,” Mabel announced, gesturing at a perfectly round stone circle up ahead. “That's our school. We have it a bit away from the village because the kids can get loud at times.”
Draco grumbled and corked up his ink bottle. With Harry home there was no quiet working.
“He's so uppish,” sighed Queen Harry and put his chin in his hand while making heart eyes at the blond boy. Bleh. “Don't you just love it?”
“Scanian. The flag of Scania, the south-most region of Sweden,” BraveHeart responded, suddenly a faraway look on his face. “The Swedish flag is blue with a yellow cross, the Scanian one is red with a yellow cross. Because the Danish flag is red with a white cross and Scania used to belong to Denmark for quite some time. Therefore, mixed Danish-Swedish flag equals Scanian flag.”
(fair/lovely) as in The Fair *** (her name is lost actually). She seems to have been a goddess of nature (or even Mother Nature herself, I did not include that version because I only found out after I was finished) and then Christianity asked for only one God and she had to disappear, but the people still wanted to pray to her. Saying her name was forbidden though, so they just called her The Fair
“Mhm, not much to go on here,” said Wolfe with an unsatisfied look. “But at least they remembered the grass sacrifice for the horses. Binky, dig in!”
Mimbelwimbel
This was not a new occurrence though.
It was breathtaking to be suddenly engulfed in white-blue swirls of glow and shimmer.
The uneasy feeling was back, stronger than before.
Granger really
Tearing his gaze from his dead former friend, Draco managed to give the tiny boy at his arm an amused look. “Did he now? I wonder what else he said about me?”
“Damn straight you will,” grumbled Harry finally, “and you better give it your best shot.”
Snorting, Malfoy turned to face ahead again. “If you call saving me from breaking my neck 'for nothing', then sure.” He paused. “I guess, you'd rather have me dead anyway.” The seriousness of his voice and sudden dark turn startled Harry. “You know what? Don't answer that.”
Petulantly Malfoy spat: “I've had nothing yet, so I can't take more.”
“Those are for horseshoes,” munched Wolfe next to Ember. “Don't you want some food, Seeker?”
Half smirked. “Magic! No, really, it's more like amnesia – you remember how to talk, but not what you said.”
Screw that.
“The Wental Mell?” Cassius checked and was granted a curt nod. “Wow, shit.”

“The sky,” said Ember dryly and shifted Dreamer in his arms. “Look up.”
Because The Hunt left in the morning of the 26th, after sunrise, so the traces stayed
Take care everyone!
“Yeah, that's right,” BraveHeart repeated, trying to sound wise, “love is the most powerful connection.”
They were not paying him any attention. Instead they did weird postures while holding an arm up high, grinning at it like lunatics.
two halves of one.”
?” He started back the way they had come, but halted once he realised, Harry wasn't following. “What is it?”
It thundered.
“Oh, I intend to treat him
“Zero,” came Ron's answer, quick like a shot. “Such Slytherin would be a real unicorn.”
But no matter how colourful Malfoy swore (after firing several Drying, Warming and Cleaning Spells at the both of them), it couldn't wipe off Cedric's image, greenish-pale but rosy-cheeked, back in the lake, carrying Cho to safety. If only someone had got him to safety in time...
Just then, she did indeed begin, her look mild and her speech slow, her body gently rocking to and fro:
Wolfe had attempted to reason with him (“Those are the rules of nature.”), yet Harry had disregarded her.
here.”
She smiled watery. “Yeah, you were. But you don't have to apologise. I believed what I wanted to believe. ...same as with the Dark Lord. You know, we eavesdropped on your conversation with Greg earlier,” (“Of course you did.”) “and... it's hard to accept and I don't know yet if I'm really willing to change my views, but I will think about what you said. About blood status and all that.”
“I'll tell you – but maybe not here? It's a bit cold.” Which was absolutely true. Especially in Potter's case who was merely wearing a rumpled dress shirt with rolled up sleeves, but no cloak.
No sound from the other boy. Maybe he had left, never to return again, never to talk to Harry again...
On page 92 was a recipe for
“Don't patronize me,” Seeker snapped.
Queen Harry snickered, but quickly sobered when Malfoy directed a glare at him. “He drank the Time-Out Tea. It's supposed to calm people down when they are upset, by showing them a different perspective,” he explained.
“I suppose we have to wait for a while for Ada to return. Maybe we could... Mother, won't you tell us a story of old?” Mabel suggested.
He reached out and petted his owl. She cooed into his ear, holding out a leg.
(Now, here's something to think about – which came first? Trelawney's prophecy, Voldemort selecting Harry as his rival or Berchthold selecting Harry as Voldemort's best opponent? ...chicken&egg... self-fulfilling prophecy anyone?)
“The Headless Hunt.” Longbottom eyed him curiously. “The ghost hunting party for the beheaded? I thought it was common knowledge.” He shrugged. “But maybe just among Gryffindors as Nick's our– Hey, where are you going?”
“Halali! Death-haloo!” Berchthold's booming voice sounded like thunder. The Hunt started moving.
Nonetheless, it was under his gentle tutelage that his mother had quietly picked up where she had left off with her sister all those years ago and by now, the two of them were tentatively exchanging letters which seemed to bring both of them joy, as far as Draco could conclude.
There was nothing there. How curious. He carefully reached forward and his fingertips were met with an invisible resistance. With his hands he followed what seemed to be a wall, stretching out to both sides. It went down to the ground and as high up as he could jump. Park visitors were walking through the barrier without a problem, but Seeker couldn't manage, even as he threw his whole body weight against the obstacle.
“Right, we'll figure that out later. But what about the witnesses?” Granger thumped through a thick tome until she found the right passage. “
Both: 	       I tried so hard and got so far. But in the end it doesn't even matter.
Granger's bushy head appeared in the door frame. She was positively glowing.
“And some sandwiches while you're at it?” added Cassius. “Pansy and I didn't really have time to eat today, with being in the hospital wing and all.”
“Apparently not, so would you stop teasing and just spit it out already?”
Draco was a bit sad to leave already, but he had promised his parents to be there before dinner and even a Portkey to France still took some time.
“Nothing! What's with the accusation, Potter?” Malfoy really tried to sound indignant, but he evaded Harry's gaze and stubbornly stared at the other side of the room.
“No need. I'll explain that too in a minute.”
Their eyes locked, taking them both back to the agonising moments of eternity when Potter had indeed been dead for Draco. To the snippet of infinity when, after all hell had broken loose with Potter's 'resurrection', they had passed each other in the crowd. Just a split-second they had held each other's gaze. Blazing green eyes on tear filled grey ones and Draco had known that Potter had understood that Draco had been crying for Harry. Because that one time, in all of Draco's life, Potter had been Harry to him, in the seconds when Draco's last remaining piece of happy childhood had shattered to smithereens with Harry's death.
Malfoy shuddered. “Creepy.”
Malfoy rounded on Harry, accusatorily glaring. “You know her? Why didn't you say so?”
here and this reads
! Look! We're... hovering? Or something.”
“Wow, that is beyond awesome, Seeker! He must be so cool! Oh wow, that's so rare! Like one in a million!” BraveHeart's eyes sparkled with excitement.
Ping.
"No, it's just, normally you jump in here and correct us. What's that guy's name again?" the Ronald-Weasel asked.
“That's The Beginning,” whispered Half, who had led his six-legged horse Gee close to Lightning's right flank.
Since the afternoons in this first week of August were of the blazing hot kind of midsummer, he usually enjoyed the cool mornings. Today though, he shivered as a balmy breeze came in from the window, drying the cold sweat on his forehead. He quickly pulled a Weasley-made cardigan out of his antique wardrobe, fingers brushing his father's Invisibility Cloak, then headed for the stairs.
Living on his own these last one and a half years had taught Draco to see things in a different light and now that he'd found how much he'd changed he wasn't all that sad anymore to leave earlier than he had originally planned.
So that left... the Weasleys as Potter's more or less adopted family. Goddammit.
Harry's heart skipped a beat. What was that just now? He furrowed his brows. “Heal? I'm not sure what you mean.”
“It's not a big deal, really,” Potter grinned and gestured at the open wardrobe, “and it's nice to have a wider selection.” He tugged at the shirt he'd just put on. “Thanks for this.”

Harry slowly let out a breath.
as a present.” She held out a worn book labelled
In some of these photographs, Teddy was seen – either in Draco's, Harry's or Aunt Andromeda's arms – giggling gleefully at some birds or flowers on the way.
Draco closed his eyes. “I know. I should have been there for you.” Unexpectedly, he was tearing up. “I was so caught up in my own head and I – I'm really trying to leave this shit behind me, you know? Not you, but this 'blood traitor' talk and all that. See, I realised that's all just something they made up to feel better about themselves. The Dark Lord and our fathers and–”
“I did,” Harry confirmed. “He called me, at the cliffs earlier, and I remembered my life. Sorry I couldn't say goodbye then, it went all very fast.”
Next up were photographs taken at Draco's birthday in early June – a full room stacked with people who'd never dreamt of partying together, mostly former Slytherins and Gryffindors. It had been a blast.
Or maybe it simply was the flag, really. After all, the skull-and-bones Jolly Roger of the opponent team always made Seeker shudder with a deep-seated aversion and when he had told his friends so, all but Ember had agreed. There was just something dark about that skull...
Harry came home with the first rays of sunrise and when he finally fell asleep, he heard Malfoy singing in his head:
Magic. Harry rolled his eyes. It would be
Harry had to hold on for dear life at the sudden movement and he gave Malfoy's scalp a hefty smack. “Careful! You nearly threw me off!”
Now, he went to stand next to the winner of the latest Quidditch World Cup qualifying match and handed him his own cup of freshly brewed tea. “I know. I heard it on the wireless. Congrats.”
Draco made a funny squeaking noise. “What's with the–? Why do you always–?” He stopped and sighed, then his face turned sober. “I love you, too, you big sap. Now, can we go and get this done so we can crawl back into bed and I can show you exactly
(See the end of the chapter for
Now was the time to be supportive though. “I mean, you could probably win her back by showing her your heart is indeed in it and all. If that's what you want.” Draco paused, considering. Why did these words feel like acid on his tongue? “What
“Shush! Quiet now. This way!” Seeker nodded his head to the right and the group of two dozen people followed him unquestioningly through the undergrowth.
“One of them caught my eye,” Merchieftainess Murcus faltered, her mouth a sad line. “She sang beautifully; with eyes like the sea and a smile like sunshine. Her name was Aoife.”
“You know, that is a good thought,” Malfoy allowed and stomped on Harry's foot under the table when the latter opened his mouth to protest. “How about you release the Sticking Spell and we'll send Potty here packing, what do you think?”
Harry saw Queen Harry's fingertips missing Malfoy's cloak by a threat. He saw Alice sipping tea. He saw the room underground tilt from his view.
Not coming from zis boy!” Suddenly her eyes were blazing. “Don't you all forget: 'e is ze reason my Bill got 'urt like zis! I won't trust anything 'e says!”
“Well, I am,” Potter proclaimed. “Give me some, Mabel.”
Oh wonderful. That again. Draco took a deep breath – and let it out. Nope. Enough for today. “You know what? Nevermind. How about we do some more research?”
Despite that, he was miserable.
Harry, brows furrowing, read out aloud:
Before you
Half, mouth half-open, blinked, then shook his head in disbelief. “Girls! Am I right?”
“Daddy, Daddy, look at the horsey!” A little boy ran up to Seeker and stared wide-eyed at something above his head.
Huffing, Draco turned away and crossed his arms over his chest. Now that Potter wasn't here, Weasley seemed to have taken over at keeping Draco annoyed. Great, just great.
“Nothing so far. He's being all mysterious.” Harry arched an eyebrow at Draco. “Hold on, is that why–”
anything, I swear. We're not in trouble.”
Harry grinned. “Well, for one, strictly speaking you haven't turned me down even once yet and two...” He lifted their still entwined hands between their faces, so that Draco could see the silvery scar on the back of Harry's hand.
“Thank you, all, for coming for me though. I'm glad you saved me. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad riding with The Hunt. In fact, it was rather fun and I,” Potter faltered for a moment, “I'm sorry I didn't get to say goodbye.”
It would have been cold, but Ember's body gave off an amount of heat that wasn't quite normal, yet served the purpose of warming Harry thoroughly.
“Also, we met before.”
For the umpteenth time, Harry secretly checked his DA coin. It still read:
“I'll take that as a yes, so you better not complain later. And when we'll get found you'll say we got stuck here
Draco blushed hard and reached for the incriminating evidence. “Show that to me! Impossible – these notes had disappeared! Hunt magic would erase everything I wrote about you.” He thumbed through the pages, his face incredulous.
“Harry!”
“What do you me–” started Cassius, but got interrupted.
Following these words were immediate reactions: While Draco's thoughts flew towards excitement that he had finally found someone who might know something, Granger's hand flew to cover her mouth as Weasley flew out of his chair and hastily started ransacking the room for a kettle and cups.
“Good then, you can find the Stone if you tap the map and say
Harry tried about a dozen times with an increasingly annoyed Malfoy giving increasingly erratic instructions.
“Ah, but it's not unusual. In other places we get beer, milk or ears of corn. In Austria they even write us an invitation:
His face went dark. “And that's why you brought me here, isn't it? But I didn't kill him.”
“Draco! I'm here!” Harry shouted after him.
“Excuse me?”
. Draco responded in kind, winding his arms around Harry's neck, anchoring him in the moment. They kissed slowly; they had all the time in the world. Harry lost himself in the intimacy of being held this way. Being wanted had been nice, but being cherished was oh, so much better.
awfully late already, isn't it?” She passed by him and left Draco standing, forlornly looking at a room full of redheaded people who had resumed their conversation from before his arrival and were now once again completely unaware of the fact that there should be a mop of black hair sitting among them.
“The Wild Hunt... isn't that a children's tale?” mused Wild-One. “Mum, Dad, you told us the story when we were younger, didn't you? How did that go?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. The dramatics of those Gryffindorks, really. “Chill, Granger. Anyone who would happen to come across us would think he was talking to me – or run off for being spotted after curfew.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I got that.”
“Don't do it, Malfoy!” Potter's voice was low and beseeching. “Mabel knows a different way back into the castle, don't you, Mabel?”
.” The blond boy chuckled. “Your expression was worth galleons.”
“Goodnight,” said the other Harry.
“Do you really, Seeker, do you?” BraveHeart had Grapes flying upside down and hung his head next to Harry's, looking eager. “What do you see?”
“She used to joke that we should just run away together, live in a place that was only for us. She called it Yonder Hill.”
“Us,” nodded Echo, arms crossed.
He turned on his heels and walked back to his painted twin. After all, this was the perfect opportunity.
A wave of sudden anger flooded him: anger directed at himself but also at others.
“Vin...” Draco slapped a hand over his mouth, forcing himself to swallow the name. If he called his dead friend now, what good would it do Vincent? He would have to leave The Wild Hunt and be what? A ghost at Hogwarts?
“It is! And you did! And when Voldemort–”
The addressee, a second ago very busy with distracting himself from a question-cascading BraveHeart, went rigid.
He blinked. One year...? One year of what again?
Typical. Harry rolled his eyes at Draco. “Well, since you're gracing us with your
“Is that a Muggle thing?” asked Draco, weirdly fascinated by the thought of a house exclusively built for books.
Malfoy didn’t even give him the silent treatment Zabini had predicted.
Harry followed his gaze: the clothes Malfoy’d worn the day before in fact lying, neatly folded, on top of the cabinet. Harry hadn’t noticed them.
About an hour ago the dancing had really started, the sort of ballroom stuff that Harry had never mastered. It was something he didn’t even really like to watch, always feeling terribly inadequate when he did.
to wear, before the trials, before the Malfoy family had been forced to pay.
As if this terrible Ministry ball hadn’t been quite awful enough already.
Someone had asked Draco to go into an examination room to be checked out, but he had refused. He wasn’t in that much pain and he wanted to be with Harry, needed to know Harry was going to be okay. Draco had more or less expected them to send him out of the room, while they were reversing the spell damage Harry had endured, but no one had done so.
Malfoy’s bodyguard, so he needed to make sure. He couldn’t just guess how Malfoy was: he needed to
Draco nodded without missing a beat. “Of course, by all means.”
“So what made you want to come back in the first place?” In the light of everything that happened after the war, this question could have meant many things, but Harry just looked curious.
Luna smiled, unperturbed. “No, not that many, but that might change.” She seemed to want to get up, then changed her mind and sat down on the chair next to his bed again. “Oh, and I saw your Patronus this afternoon. It’s quite something.” She actually was the first person to comment on the form his Patronus had taken, since Blaise, but she didn’t seem to be too appalled by it.
Harry could tell that Draco had seen he was awake.
“Draco doesn’t think so. They bought his story and let him go.” Harry heard the doubt edging his words regardless.
Then she called out to a young nurse further on in the corridor. “Catherine, take them to room two. And Disillusion it.”
about that, let alone talk about it.
“Okay, I’ll be there. Just make sure you order enough.” Harry smiled, getting up. He didn’t get out of the office yet, though, coming round Draco’s desk again, then standing in front of him, their eyes locked. Draco got up from his chair without giving it another thought, mesmerised by the green of Harry’s eyes like always, and he felt a shiver of relief rippling through his whole body when, finally, their lips met in a short, yet intense kiss.
Well, at least the part of the weekend that hadn’t been Saturday night, obviously.
When Draco woke up it was to Potter sleeping beside him. It was dark and all he could hear, if he listened very carefully, was the sound of Potter’s breathing, calm and even.
Harry couldn’t help but smile a little. “Yes, they do. Just so you know, we’re not all completely useless because we’re not in Covert Ops.”
So when he’d seen Potter for the first time in years, he understandably hadn’t exactly known how to navigate the situation, eventually just opting to keep it neutral, just stating Potter’s name. When Potter had seemed surprised, Draco had known it was as he’d thought: Potter would want to have as little to do with him as possible.
Draco nodded in silence. There really was nothing else to say.
After Mathew had talked to the man for a while, said man disapparated again and Mathew came back into the garden, apparently wanting to speak to Harry who stepped out of the house a few moments later.
He hadn’t even noticed how much he’d wanted this before.
Harry heard it and let it in, finding that the parchment it was carrying was actually  meant for him. He untied it quickly, giving the owl the small treat he kept in his pocket for this sort of thing, and read.
French, but to be fluent at it. So, consequently, Draco had been tutored on the subject ever since he’d been able to hold a quill.
Harry shook his head quickly. “Of course not. We’ll just tell her that we’re trying to work things out or something.”
Right. Of course. This wasn’t about him, but about Hermione having to take time off. So, Draco quickly stuffed his hope back where it had come from and tried to look indifferent, cool.
“Can we get to business, please?” Harry sounded annoyed when he said it and it surprised Draco. The wizard smiled at Harry, probably already used to seeing him: Draco wouldn’t be surprised if Harry dropped by Minister Shacklebolt’s office all the time.
Or perhaps he just liked things he knew he had no chance of ever getting.
It had lasted all the months leading up to the new school year, and Draco had even started to believe it could be more, that
Draco was on his back, sprawled out over the sofa as if he’d collapsed there and hadn’t woken up since. He was still wearing the clothes Harry’d lent him yesterday and he was quite pale.
“I’m going to keep you here overnight, just to ensure everything’s fine, but I expect you’ll be able to leave tomorrow.” Draco watched Harry for a moment, then asked: “Do you still feel tired?”
He extricated himself, stepping back, wanting to say something, anything, to get away from this. But Harry got his voice to work first, though.
Then he seemed to snap out of it. “What did you think of the latest Puddlemere win?”
And now Harry was late. Malfoy was nowhere to be seen and Harry felt disappointed, realising Malfoy had most probably already left. Perhaps he’d even pulled.
Program by Chase & Status, IRAH
He stayed in there for a degenerately long time and then some, feeling the water sluice over his body, warm, comforting. And
“You could stay for breakfast,” Harry said. So there it was: the breakfast thing. “I’ve actually made enough for the both of us.”
“And you know it’s better that way just as well as I do,” Draco answered. He didn’t tell Blaise the rest, the way people didn’t want to be seen with him, the way they would sometimes be friendly and only then realise who he was, what he stood for. Which inevitably meant they would start shunning him.
And although Draco didn’t answer he couldn’t help but smile back.
actually was a name Draco recognised. Yes, about three months ago, Romanian Dragon Sanctuary. Draco had been called in on a rather viciously wounded man who had crossed a dragon at the wrong time and the wrong place.
Draco seemed to consider him for a beat, then went for the broom and mounted it in one sure movement, taking off without hesitation. The space they were in was high enough for him to hover without being seen immediately. Good.
Draco was right, of course: they wouldn’t be able to just walk out yet, for again there were footsteps outside of the office they were in. Harry didn’t say anything, just signalling Draco to stand to one side of the door, while he himself stood to the other.
The alleyway they’d Apparated into after dinner was dark and secluded and Draco had been momentarily thrown off balance by the Side-Along. Which, of course, had been the only reason that Harry had pulled him in, their hips flush together.
When he got there he heard voices in the smaller living room and he headed there straight away, stopping in his tracks, suddenly careful, when he recognised the teary voice of someone who was unmistakably Ginny Weasley.
“Okay, if you like.” Draco just said, a bit reluctantly, almost as if he couldn’t quite believe that Harry had asked him. “There’s food in the kitchen. But, I think
Harry looked him over again. “Yeah, I figured. Your erm-, your hair’s still wet.” He reached out, as if he wanted to touch it, but apparently decided against it in the end, rather abruptly walking to where he knew the living room was situated.
They kept moving together like that for a while. Neither of them trying to get closer or do anything else, just moving to the music, to the beat that always reverberated through clubs like this one throughout the night.
for anyone. But casual sex, with whomever you want and with or without the aid of the Cartel’s drugs, no problem at all.” He said it almost disdainfully.
After the trials they hadn’t allowed him his wand back, stating it would be returned to him after exactly

Harry had watched Corentin cast furiously for a while, now shooting a diagnostic.
“And you were refused?”
here in the UK several times.”
Draco needed a slight pause, before answering: “Yes, of course,” Up until now Harry had obviously just apparated into Draco’s flat, but if Harry was to let the kitchen people in, he would obviously need the key.
Harry looked around in absolute horror. The atrium of the Ministry, normally the proud testament to what the wizarding world was capable of, had been almost completely destroyed: the attack swift and entirely unexpected.
all here, I’d like to start,” Robards began, hardly hiding his disapproval of Harry being just ever so slightly late. “As you all know a new group of potions smugglers has been causing trouble on the European mainland for months now and they seem to have expanded their market to the UK just recently. They stand out, because they don’t only seem to brew and smuggle forbidden magical potions, but they have also been flooding the Muggle market with party drugs laced with magic, which makes it all even more delicate. They are known as the Dragon Cartel, their pills and potions recognisable by a dragon symbol.”
The guard on the other side of the fence regarded him for a brief moment. “Yes, Mr Mauvay told us you’d be here.” Then he strolled back to the small building he had come from, talking to someone apparently still inside. Shortly after an owl took off.
And what was more: Draco had believed him.
“Let me see.” It was most definitely not a question.
It hadn’t been a surprise to find that some people didn’t agree with him returning to Hogwarts though. He had expected
Malfoy seemed to be breathing normally, though. Which was good.
able to cast a Patronus, even if it was a shockingly infuriating one - Draco still wanted to go to their spot by the Great Lake. He’d like to talk to Harry before tomorrow, before they’d both leave for their new lives: their lives after Hogwarts.
When they were out eventually, Harry Apparated them both to hospital before Draco could lose consciousness again.
Was that what they were now?
Perhaps they had.
“For allowing Draco to come in today.” Harry noticed Zabini must have cast a Silencing Charm, because the incessant sound of the bass had decreased considerably and it was surprisingly easy to hear him. “And for not letting them take him into custody.” Zabini’s eyes were serious. “You know, because Azkaban-, well, let’s just say it was no picnic.”
much.”
The soft smile Malfoy gave her, was so unexpected that Harry would probably remember it forever. “Of course not,” Malfoy just said. And Harry realised that must have been why he had been casting
Fuck, he hoped Malfoy would be at the club tomorrow.
“No, Professor,” the girl answered, “it won’t happen again.”
Her confidence had made all the difference in the world.
“Ready to go to mine? I’m not connected to the Floo network.” Malfoy said it a bit apologetically, his voice sounding slightly tense. He was holding out his arm for Harry to be Side-Alonged.
“Draco!” Harry called out.
Harry swallowed thickly. “Yeah, of course.” Then he quickly and quite suddenly turned to Ron on his other side. It hadn’t been fast enough though, as Draco still caught a glimpse of the flush spreading on Harry’s face.
, they were greeted by the spicy smell of foreign food and the sound of people talking and laughing animatedly. The hallway seemed deserted, though.
Malfoy had found and bought the book he had wanted quickly, almost before anyone, except for the wizard at the till obviously, could have noticed. Then he cast a quick
“Like when I’m with-, when I see-.” Normally Draco would certainly have been annoyed with the man for not even being able to finish a simple sentence, but now Harry was so close – when had that actually happened? – and he was watching him so intently that Draco really couldn’t see anything else than the mesmerising green of Harry’s eyes.
That was when the door to the library opened, though, and Harry’s wand was in his hand before he could even think about it.
Neither of them had brought up Draco’s current predicament and Draco hadn’t told anyone else yet, either, not even his mother. The humps on his back had retracted, so there were no visible remains anymore and Draco had decided it could wait, at least until he knew exactly how his Veela traits worked and how to deal with them. Otherwise there wouldn’t be too much to tell anyway, he’d concluded.
It probably hadn’t been the most graceful position he’d ever been in.
Potter nodded. “Yeah, of course. Have a nice weekend.”
Then, when Draco had reached Potter, he just grabbed hold of Draco’s arm, followed by the swift and slightly nauseating tug of Apparition, astonishingly landing them smack in the middle of Potter’s bedroom, Potter’s lips were on his again as soon as the world had stopped spinning, his hands roaming free all over Draco’s body as if he couldn’t decide where to start. And Draco just noticed his own hands doing something similar, right before he stopped thinking altogether.
That wasn’t what came next, however. “Draco means dragon, doesn’t it?” Harry stated, amusement more apparent now.
“Well,” Harry made it look like he pondered this for a short while and although Draco knew Harry was teasing him, he involuntarily thought of the state he’d been in at Astoria’s wedding, shame overtaking him a little before he efficiently shoved it aside again. “I suppose he could,” Harry then answered.
Furthermore they’d been busy: in the morning they had been training - Draco in offence and defence and Harry in curse-breaking - exactly like they were supposed to every morning for the next three months. Just like they would be working a case every afternoon for the next three months.
It was why his mouth found Malfoy’s where he’d been talking into Harry’s ear, which resulted in a searing kiss, the invisible fire blazing between them unrelentingly. It was something neither of them were able to ignore or withstand, their kiss deepening easily, making it into something much more urgent and needy. Was this what kissing a man was like?
Still, almost to his own surprise, he sat down again.
“I think you should have it,” Harry hadn’t known he was going to say it, until he did, but he knew this was the right thing to do as soon as it had come out of his mouth.
Harry already knew what the message was going to be about, before he’d actually read it.
It reminded him of the way Draco had danced with Astoria a bit and just that thought made a warmth settle in his stomach that seemed utterly out of place given the circumstances, but that also made him focus even more, especially on anyone that could be a threat to Draco.
So Harry took Malfoy’s arm, only realising as he did it that he hadn’t even hesitated, that he had trusted Malfoy to actually take him to his house - and nowhere else - without question.
Draco looked at him, his eyes the soft silver that Harry could never really get enough of. Then Draco suddenly smirked. “I suppose we’d better hurry, though, because I think Mrs Weasley will probably kill us
Zabini cast a
“Your, erm-,” Harry started, obviously struggling to say something and Draco actually saw the moment Harry decided to just go for it. “Your lips are erm-,” he said, not finishing, but brushing his fingers over Draco’s upper lip instead, wiping at the moisture that was undoubtedly there. It was a gesture of such intense gentleness that it left Draco completely breathless.
, always willing to help people, anyway.
Okay, it hadn’t been first thing, more like fifth thing, but come Monday lunchtime Harry decided to pay a visit to Curse-Breaking, making his way to Malfoy’s office there easily, because he knew exactly where it was. It was the fortunate side effect of him having successfully evaded it for so long.
“I think he would,” Draco just answered. He definitely wasn’t going to tell her how Potter hadn’t even wanted to see him, how he had ignored him as much as he could for the whole evening. Even just
Draco’s eyes flew open, because that obviously was how this damned curse worked. “Harry, I-, You didn’t want to-.” He was panting.
So even though it took every ounce of Draco’s willpower, he didn’t accept Harry’s offer.
“Yes, well, wait, that would have been precisely a week ago today.” Blaise seemed to seriously try and recollect whether he’d found a laughing Harry Potter in their room that night. “No, can’t remember.” He shot Draco another grin. “He must have cast a solid silencing charm.”
Harry frowned briefly, confusedly.
Harry nodded, actually looking happy. “Good. Hermione will be there too, and Blaise might - we never know when he’s coming - and some other people we know. Oh, and Oliver Wood. He’s just back from the States.” Draco didn’t say anything to that. None of this was actually making him any less apprehensive.
Then Draco slanted a glance in Harry’s direction and proceeded to pour Harry’s coffee, adding just the right amount of sugar, no milk.
, but he caught himself just in time.
It had been confiscated a while back, but because it wasn’t a priority it hadn’t been cleared by Tracing Division yet, which was a prerequisite for other Ministry staff to come in and catalogue the house, however, because Tracing was the only division equipped well enough to clear a house like this one.
“Working. Which is what you should be doing too,” Draco gritted out, snappier than he had wanted to. A searing pain was actually wreaking havoc on his back now, his jaw clenching hard in an effort not to show anything, to keep his eyes open.
Outside of the door people were casting spells in quick succession, trying to gain access.
“Well, yes, I did,” Harry clarified, “I do understand what Ginny meant. She said we were more like brother and sister than husband and wife and she was right, of course. We’re still good friends, though, even though she’s with Dean now.” Here Harry paused a beat, then added: “Much like you and Astoria, I think. You’re still good friends, too, aren’t you?”
Draco’d been effectively avoiding Harry’s room for the rest of the day, knowing Harry’d leave before Draco’s shift would end. Apart from slight dizzy spells Harry had been absolutely fine (Draco had made sure Hannah Abbott had also corroborated that), so there had been no need to prolong Draco’s torture any further.
And, like before, shopping with Harry had been extremely nice and Draco knew, he just
Draco didn’t seem to agree, though, getting out of bed in moments, leaving Harry strangely cold all of a sudden. “You don’t, you know,” Harry answered slightly uncertainly, but definitely meaning it anyway. “I wouldn’t mind if you stayed a bit longer. We could even have breakfast, if you wanted.”
Draco had put Dittany on his healing wound (which had apparently been why he hadn’t buttoned up his shirt earlier yet) and then they’d had breakfast, eating mostly in silence, but not the awkward type so much. They just both seemed to be lost in their own thoughts.
Draco wasn’t sure how he
“Thanks,” Harry smiled at her, “And thanks,” he added emphatically, meaning he was glad he now knew David was on the mend.
Luna continued: “You know I visited him in Azkaban a few times. Kingsley gave me permission.” Her voice was airy and light and sounded as if that wasn’t strange at all.
“Is his position compromised?” Zabini obviously shared the concern Harry hadn’t actually allowed himself to think about yet.
The dinner party Malfoy had to attend, appeared to be a rather fancy affair. Large dinner table, lots of expensively dressed guests, the works.
They were open.
“Wasn’t planning on that, really. I tried that yesterday when I came here unfortunately, and it didn’t quite agree with me.” Draco’s voice was as indifferent as always and it took Potter just a slight bit of time to actually understand what he was saying.
Then he Apparated out, leaving Harry completely at a loss. Was Harry supposed to be offended? Because he realised he actually felt a bit offended, but he also knew - or hoped perhaps -
Zabini just gave him an odd look for a moment, furrowing his brow. “Draco didn’t want you to know. He thought it would put you off.” Harry wanted to start telling Zabini how uncalled for that was, how ridiculous, but Zabini didn’t give him a chance to, saying: “Well, would you have taken on this assignment if you had known you’d be working with Draco Malfoy on everything? Honestly?” snidely adding, when Harry didn’t give in straight away: “Perhaps I need to remind you I actually saw your face when you’d only heard you were going to be Draco’s
Harry just got up and went out.
“Coming?” It was Neville, Luna’s husband, who was asking her to come, addressing Draco next: “If that’s okay with you?”.
It gained him an incredulous look. “I can only assume that this here would be rather flattered to be called a letter. I’ve actually read essay titles that are longer.” Draco paused, continuing on a slightly softer note: “But yes, I’ve read it.”
“You were angry with me,” Harry recollected and he knew his voice sounded slightly sulky, as if Malfoy had been to blame, as if Harry himself hadn’t cocked up first. Harry felt Malfoy shrug, but he didn’t say anything.
Harry didn’t know whether to be annoyed or utterly grateful until after he’d taken the potion.
allow yourself to be happy, you know. I think you deserve it.”
disappointment. Of some sort, anyway.
“No.” There was absolutely no hesitation to Harry’s answer. “All of the others there will be couples. I’d just feel, well,
“But you don’t like me in that way?” Harry now pressed, knowing that this might be the only moment he’d be able to get any answers, the only time Draco might be inclined to answer his questions.
Of course he had. He’d loved Ginny and it had been enough.
Draco noticed he was quite nervous and it he could tell himself that he wanted to make the team, because he thought it was a nice, new challenge, which was true. And he could also tell himself that it would not be a problem to be working in the UK again, because he didn’t care about people’s usually decisively low opinion of him, which was only very partly true.
“Yes, to that sodding excuse for a letter of yours.”
She fell silent for a moment, eventually continuing: “He
So what if this was the first evening this week Draco didn’t get to spend with Harry? That shouldn’t be a problem whatsoever, now should it? Harry was going to have dinner with Luna this evening, like he had wanted to on Monday, and even though Harry had told Draco about it a few days ago already, it still oddly stung somehow.
‘Sorry’ just wasn’t what he did with Potter. It never had been.
So that’s what Harry did. He let his instincts take over, this time following Draco’s lead, though. And all of a sudden dancing wasn’t hard work: it was okay, easy almost, and although Harry knew he probably didn’t even come close to Astoria’s natural grace, he found he didn’t really care anymore. He was with Draco and that was all that mattered.
And so worth it.
“Go after him!” Zabini’s voice was really quiet, but insistent. “I’m not going anywhere,” He made a small attempt at a smile. “Get the fucking bastard!”
Harry sat down beside him and started unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, then took it off. He didn’t say anything, but Draco saw how his eyes lingered.
Next there was only one thing left to do: leave, preferably without being noticed.
“Do you have any plans for today?” They had finished breakfast and the question took Draco by surprise.
It was the most exhilarating kiss Harry had ever had.
The moment felt like an eternity all rolled in one, like everything around them had momentarily been put on hold somehow.
Then he switched to: “We’ve taken those four bastards into custody, by the way. They’re in secured cells completely off the grid, so the Cartel won’t know what happened to them. That’s necessary so as to not compromise your Glamours, but I think it might also be for their own good. The Cartel doesn’t usually take kindly to their people being captured. Captives form a liability, you know, in case they would be inclined to start spilling beans.” A sly look crossed Zabini’s face. “I think I should probably be talking to them from that perspective. Might get us some intel.”
Okay, so that hadn’t worked either. Sleep, or any other form of rest for that matter, had eluded Draco for almost an hour now, his mind going over everything that had happened over the last twenty-four hours again and again, annoyingly focussing in on anything Harry-related as much as possible.
Then he took a shower, dressed himself and went to the kitchen, surprised that he found himself hoping that Malfoy had cooked him breakfast again, because, even though he wasn’t actually late today and could easily have gotten his tea and toast routine in, it would be so much easier to just sit and eat something nice.
Harry saw how Draco struggled to keep his temper in check. His knuckles white from clutching his still lowered wand, his face a pale, transfixed mask.
Because Draco didn’t think Harry could possibly be asking that, not after having ignored him completely for the better part of Astoria and Seamus’ wedding party.
Not that there had been that much to ignore, really. Draco had been rather successful at evading people over the years.
Malfoy was gone.
“Don’t what?” Draco asked, trying to sound like he really didn’t have a clue and probably failing miserably.
, Potter had called him Draco. It felt good, somehow. And utterly dangerous.
As soon as the thought had hit him, Harry found he’d got up. He actually

quite hungry,” he said, making no attempt to move, just gently pushing a stray strand of hair out of Draco’s face.
Weasley, the male variant this time, joined in the laughter slightly reluctantly and Draco couldn’t decide whether that was, because either Weasley’d sent the bowl to its splintering doom in the first place or because Weasley would have wanted to eat everything in it, which now would obviously be completely out of the question. Perhaps it was a combination of both.
But that didn’t mean Harry had to like the git. And it certainly didn’t mean he would enjoy working with him.
“But you haven’t even crushed my toes yet,” Draco arrogantly mock-pouted, knowing exactly how that made him look. It wasn’t completely wasted on Potter either, because Potter watched him with something like hunger for a moment. It was quick, just a flicker, but it was definitely there.
So Harry got a spare duvet from the wardrobe in the room and used it to cover Draco carefully.
“Thank you.” This was the second time this week that Harry was startled out of his thoughts by Blaise Zabini and he rather sullenly noted he shouldn’t let it become a habit.
Malfoy frowned in a way that could only mean he thought Harry was being rather dim-witted. “I started to work for Blaise, because he asked me, because he’s a friend and he asked. Surely you can understand that.”
, with his distinctive blonde hair and pale complexion. It was strangely comforting to have him here, in this really rather disturbing situation – Harry could admit to that much - as himself, as Draco.
Draco noticed the words came easier than they would normally come: he was tired, really, very tired. And that meant he would have to be careful as to what he said, not giving away too much. Around Harry it was always so easy to give away too much.
Potter just nodded silently.
Draco hadn’t seen Potter again this week. He usually got into Training early on Tuesday mornings, so he could check the essays he hadn’t come around to grading throughout the rest of the week. But he hadn’t seen Potter then and he hadn’t seen Potter
a rather large one: it has a wingspan of at least 15 inches,” Draco mumbled, feeling the need to defend himself and his dragonfly.
“So you treat many Veela, then?” Draco couldn’t quite help his sarcasm spilling, knowing full well what the answer would be.
Okay, if Harry would never get used to Malfoy walking into his sodding living room, he was most certainly never ever going to get used to Malfoy using a
Malfoy’s eyes were now intently trained on the object that Harry had put on his desk, but he didn’t touch it, instead spelling it to float towards him and keep hovering there with a single elegant flourish of his wand.
Sleep just kept eluding him. He did doze off a few times, but it never lasted long and Harry wasn’t even sure that he wanted it to, anymore.
“Because-. Well, it obviously was a mistake.” Draco’s voice sounded cold again, but there was a whisper of a question to his tone that Harry held on to.
That’s when Harry braced himself: Robards didn’t do small matters, at all, ever.
“You-. I was just comforting her, nothing else. She just needed-.” Harry obviously began to get angry now, stumbling over his words.
Harry watched Draco for a moment. “Do you
“See anything you like?” This time Draco’s words did come out, although they might not have been too easy to discern.
That was when Harry effectively stopped Draco’s ramblings with a kiss that was filled with emotion and absolutely searing in its intensity. He only let go for a very brief moment, getting rid of all Draco’s worries in one sentence. “Draco, it’s absolutely perfect.” And his gaze was so warm, looking at Draco as if
“Harry!” It was a voice Draco still definitely recognised as Hermione’s.
Draco nodded, swallowing the last bit of his croissant, savouring it. It had been quite good. All of the food had been, really.
There was nothing tender to the kiss that followed. It was hard and urgent and needy, all pent-up wanting apparently finding its way out.
Draco and Harry had been a couple for over fourteen months now, and although, of course, not all of Harry’s friends had been thrilled about their relationship, Draco had been surprised by how many of them hadn’t really batted an eye.
Draco just watched him silently for a beat, his eyes betraying confusion, hurt and uncertainty in equal measure. “I-, didn’t you notice? Your library was a complete mess. I thought I could catalogue it: putting everything on the same subject together in alphabetical order. I assumed it would be easier for you to actually use your library that way.”
Because, of course it would be him.
Malfoy gave him a small smirk. “Not
“No,” Harry’s voice was genuinely shocked now. “No, I think you’d be brilliant at it. It’s just, well, you’re going to be out of the country a lot. Bill used to be everywhere but here when he worked for Gringotts at first.” Harry stopped, just for a beat, adding hastily: “It must be hard on your mother.”
Harry shrugged, deciding that, since he’d dug himself this hole, he might as well jump into it head first. “I don’t think Mr Malfoy is a suspect yet: he’s really just a witness, but I could keep an eye on him for tonight. Just to be sure.”
“I thought we could have lunch in the canteen again?” Harry started and it only took Draco a brief, hesitant moment to answer.
Harry shrugged. “Yeah, of course, no problem: you seem to like this kind of thing. The dancing and stuff.”
For a moment Harry thought he overstepped their invisible line again, but Draco didn’t deny it, instead just mumbling: “Well, for some reason you seem to be the only thing keeping me awake since that bloody curse.”
Much like the potions’ thieves actually.
Harry couldn’t help himself, staring at the staggering magnificence of it in awe. “It’s beautiful.”
Which was so unexpected it made Harry snort a laugh. “Well, I could actually use someone to help with that,” he said. The pile on his desk really was quite enormous, and it tended to grow, especially when he wasn’t looking.
“Yeah, and I didn’t really know how to-,” the man tried to explain, “I’ve never had to call in the Aurors before.” So, that’s why the owner of the shop had been late calling them in. Harry understood how that would have worked, because although it had changed somewhat over the past few years, Knockturn still wasn’t the sort of place where Aurors were typically particularly welcome.
“Yes, although by now we should be able to be apart without feeling the loss, I suppose,” Draco couldn’t help but say, sabotaging himself, because at some level he still struggled with all of this, not completely convinced it was real.
“Then what’s wrong?” Potter spoke to him again, but it took Draco slightly longer than usual to process.
She gave him a slightly surprised look, then seemed to recognise him as the one who had brought David in and smiled. “Still weak, but out of stasis and recovering,” adding apologetically: “and I’m afraid that’s all I’m at liberty to tell you.” Harry felt she probably meant she hadn’t been at liberty to tell him even that much.
Draco wanted this to be perfect more than anything. If he wasn’t going to see Harry regularly anymore, he wanted to make this something he could remember, something he could hold on to.
Harry woke up when the door to their suite was opened.
“That’s -, that’s, well, almost correct.”
“Well, I think I’ve actually seen that in the library at the Ministry, but not in the Defence section. If I‘m right, it’s actually in Dark Magic,” Draco said slightly reluctantly. They were at a busy Muggle cafe, having cast a very light Silencing Charm, and they were talking books. It was a subject Draco had never ever thought he would be discussing with Potter, but Potter had apparently read a lot of books on Defence and Offence. And he was still reading, learning, especially now, in view of his teaching job.
“I didn’t mean-,” Harry tried. Draco would never know what exactly it was that he didn’t mean, though, because Harry didn’t finish his sentence, starting a new one instead. “I just think you have a nice space here. Very light.” He seemed to mean it, and when Draco thought of Harry’s house, dark, old and rather gloomy, it probably made some kind of sense.
Right. Of course. So Ron had probably asked him to call in on Harry.
Then, suddenly, a Patronus. Well, it wasn’t even a real, corporal Patronus, just a whisp of almost translucent smoke, but it did speak: “The library. I’m-“ That was all, before the voice broke, apparently not able to say anything else.
Draco didn’t really know whether to be offended or not.
Draco had a nice smile.
“Nothing. I made a mistake,” he eventually managed to answer, his voice still sounding quite collected. He really needed to get away.
still his friend,” Harry felt the need to confirm.
was. And he also knew that for all the playing around they’d been doing, Potter would not want this. He would probably want to pull, go home with someone - Blaise had actually told Draco as much - but that person would never be Draco, could never be Draco. It would be exceedingly stupid to believe otherwise.
The part of him that wanted to explain wasn’t the part that won out in the end, though, and Draco felt his face level out completely while he got up from the table, choking out a tight: “Thank you for dinner,” before Apparating on the spot.
Which was when, all of a sudden, he realised there was one person who probably
When he got to his desk there was a shy girl waiting for him. “Professor Potter?”
And for some reason he suspected Malfoy was acutely aware of that.
Draco smiled back. “Well, your place actually does come with a house-elf, which would make recovering so much easier.”
“Did Goodall and Boot know each other already?” Harry asked.
He wanted to say ‘yes’, every part of him did, but then he started thinking. He’d been with Harry all day and as much as he’d liked that, he realised once again that he shouldn’t get used to it, that it wasn’t normal.
“No, he wouldn’t,” Luna sounded very sure, her words accompanied by her ethereal smile as if she just knew. “Just talk to him.”
But then again, Draco wasn’t up yet and Harry really wanted to make sure he was okay.
There was one short moment to register the look in Harry’s eyes, soft and in awe at the same time. Then the witness started to move.
Draco knew he’d missed Harry the year before to a certain extent, when they hadn’t seen each other at all, but that had been
“Will this do?” Warrington had rummaged inside his cloak pockets and produced the needed items.
“Okay,” said Draco faintly.
believed in anything coming out of it and so far, it hadn't.
For the first time in years, he was hopeful when he rolled out of bed.
“Thanks for the talk. You're not a bad listener.” Draco got up. Uh oh. It had all been fun and games so far, running into
Malfoy smiled sadly. “Of course I knew. Who else would steal to my bedside in the middle of the night and squash my hand. You are not very subtle.”
Suddenly, Harry wanted to scream; to scream at Malfoy to shut up, to scream at Dumbledore for mistreating the elves, to scream at Hermione that she didn't understand him at all, to scream at himself for all the dumb shit he'd done, all the guilt, all the...
“Yeah,” Ember grunted and rubbed his flat nose. “Those are Frigg's daughters.”
When they touched down to earth, the usual storm cloud of snowflakes and laughter enveloped them as the other members of The Hunt unmounted. People and animals alike scattered to huddle in groups on the hilltop they had landed on. A variety of noises in addition to chatter filled the air as they made ready to set up camp for the night, business as usual.
Draco shifted uncomfortably. “That wasn't me. Besides, I'm not treating house-elves badly anymore.”
Returning home late that night, in bed, Harry had looked at Draco so long until the latter had sighed, rolled his eyes and inquired: “Yes?”
“Where to though? Is the Manor...?” Narcissa Malfoy looked uncertain.
Potter meanwhile had a laughing flash, rolling around on Draco's head.
“Yeah, yeah,” sniffed Malfoy haughtily and made a dismissive gesture with his hand. “Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it and the moral of this is:
(See the end of the chapter for
Weird how it was the snobbish, hurtful kid Harry had so often argued with who had won his heart. He put the mug down onto the table. Fitting together his before-, during- and after-memories was confusing.
He had been pleasantly surprised by the non-wizarding vibe of the house, in no sense how he had expected it: There were warm-coloured walls instead of dusty paintings, open doors flooding sunlight into the halls and not a single elf-head in sight (except for Kreacher's and that one was still attached to the body and very much alive, thank goodness). It didn't feel at all like a place his narky great aunt Walburga would have lived and he wondered briefly if maybe Granger and the Weasel did some redecorating during their stay here.
“To my friends.” Draco and Potter exchanged a look. Something unseen, unsaid was passing between them. Yes, this topic they needed to talk about. Maybe not tonight though. After all, their favourite ginger was momentarily very happy to have his best friend back and didn't need a damper by hearing about his dead brother riding with The Hunt.
Draco: 	       Things aren't the way they were before. You wouldn't even recognize me anymore.
He snorted at the thought. Malfoy would have a field day with that interpretation.
“They were right here on the map and then they weren't and now I can't find them anywhere on it. Can you?”
“My name is
“Okay that makes sense.” The witch nodded, taking the book from Draco. “Then the only thing left to do is to find Poppy."
fear us. So, basically, they see what they will themselves to see – when they have angst in their hearts they perceive demons and are afraid we bring catastrophes, droughts, wars or diseases. So they offer sacrifices to soothe our presumed rage. But when they have hope then they welcome us as an omen of good fortune. In those cases they recognise us as what we really are: happy party people,” he smirked. “Which reminds me: How do horses greet each other? Hay man!”
Up and away went The Wild Hunt and the second to last knot on Seeker's bracelet turned red. He was too busy looking out for The Beginning to notice, though.
“Goodbye?” suggested Draco and demonstrated by waving at the huntsmen all around.
His eyes moved on to Colin who was barely in the photography as he'd been the one to take it selfie-style. Only half of his face was seen, sleeping in the upper corner of the mug, while drooling down the side. It was ironic how small Colin was the biggest in the shot now, because of perspective. Harry smiled. Actually, Colin had always been a giant, in his heart.
Harry was very aware that his face had turned bright red. That bastard had worded it like that on purpose. He sniffed. “Can't. Too narrow.”
Draco's death grip relaxed. “Concluding you say that Harry is essentially immortal and can go to the next plane without problems, once he's turned 950+. Did I get that right?”
“Well, it did and now, if you please, can we leave this place and go back to our warm bed?”
At least he found out from studying an area map that he was at Windsor Great Park. But that was barely anything.
I know the things I know without remembering?”
Harry ignored Malfoy and held Queen Harry's gaze. If that was how he wanted to play it. “You free us from the cup. If I win, I'll take Malfoy and you show us the way out. Deal, Your Majesty?”
It had been a mix of reluctant respect for Potter's steadfastness in the face of a mostly hostile Hogwarts and the startling discovery that Potter's silhouette on a broom against a raging dragon was somewhat dashing. Most of all though, it had been during the second task that Draco had finally understood his complicated feelings with sudden, terrible certainty (ever since, he'd proceeded in locking them tightly into a box deep within himself, only to peek at them occasionally): When it had seemed as though Potter might have drowned, Draco's heart had been in severe distress.
She waved her hand at him dismissively. “Okay, okay, but I guess it won't hurt to look into it, wouldn't you agree, Malfoy? We can start with what we already know about Thestrals and Grims and work from there. Yeah? Oh, what now?”
“Pleasure,” said Malfoy stiffly and Harry got the feeling that things were very wrong if the blond git thought it necessary to be polite to house-elves.

The spell was complicated, but repetitive and they soon fell into an easy rhythm.
“Happy Boxing Day, Malfoy!”
“Sure thing! Wouldn't lose it, boss,” the tiny, masked boy grinned like a Cheshire cat, visibly proud to have been named flag bearer of this game. He pulled out a crumpled piece of rainbow-coloured cloth from his pocket and presented it.
It was funny though, if Seeker was truthful. He tried to hide a grin, but failed. “You guys are the worst,” he chuckled. “Just wait till I get back at you.” He picked more feathers out of his hair and never-withering flower crown.
“I was simply indulging you. You had a traumatic experience.”
“Adam. Brian. Chester. David. Eli,” the Weasel read from a paper.
The ginger looked offended, but then he grinned. “Natural talent, Ferret. Apropos, we are thinking of opening another store and we are still searching for a manager – want to interview for the position? Of course then
Potter was spitting mad and Draco had trouble avoiding all the attacks directed at him – verbally and physically.
“A strong black tea maybe, if you don't mind.” Harry yawned. “I don't think I can sleep anymore. I'll go to Hogwarts, see if I can get some repairs done before Auror training later.”
Then however: “He did not try to be your friend though, did he? More like...” hesitation, then in a slightly more high-pitched whisper, “your...

Harry's gaze flickered back. He reached out and tenderly brushed a stray strand of blond hair off the other boy's forehead, marvelling for the umpteenth time that night at just how
(Draco's side note: Said to use an Invisibility Cloak).
“One time we swam farther than we'd ever come and before us, the Irish coast appeared.”
Harry rolled his eyes fondly. Kreacher really resembled a doting parent at times (“Master Harry should eat! Master Harry should take a shower! Master Harry should go for a walk!”).
The cat didn't move. Stubborn like his namesake.
“Helga's Tea Room, Helga's Tea Room... That rings a bell somehow. Argh, think! I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where.”
“Yeah, fine.”
“Fine,” Draco croaked. But he felt like shit. He had to tell them. Not that he particularly wanted to, but for Potter's sake, he would. He gulped in a lungful of air. “I'm fine. But I, that is,” he closed his eyes, “I can't go back into the Manor. I just, I can't. I can tell you were to go, but you'll have to go without me.”
“That is not what we agreed upon!” Malfoy's wand shook in impotent fury.
?” Seeker screeched disbelievingly.
“That won't help you!” screeched Queen Harry and made a move to climb over the table. At last the pull at Harry's middle subsided and he could breathe again. “You are mine and I am yours! That's what you wished for! I'll make you happy!”
“Harry,” Draco's voice had gone sharp. “What did he do?”
“Well, to go and borrow books, of course. Take them home and read them, then return them. That way, you don't have to buy them,” explained Granger in a teacher-voice.
“Don't I what?” Draco snapped in a fit of pique. It was one thing to be unable to keep memories of Potter because of The Hunt's magic, another altogether though to skip out of helping to go frolicking when Potter was in distress somewhere.
“The lake. I've seen this before, through the window in our common room,” disclosed Draco. He'd just spotted something: A swarm of tiny silver fish had entered their pool of light, only to immediately disappear again, moving like one entity and cutting through the water like a knife. “Anyway, shouldn't you
“Er, thanks?” he said bewildered.
The widower in turn titled his head in appreciation.
and here
?” That was the first voice again.
Distractedly Draco pointed his wand at the broken pieces. “I suppose you are right. I will look for her starting tomorrow.” A fixed cup wrapped in a snake sprang into his hand. “But it was only twice. Cadair Idris doesn't count, we missed you there.”

It read
“They gave me an address where a Mr. Withane lives who also looks for information on The Hunt. It's a long shot. It might just be curiosity for him. But I need to try and find out if he knows something. I'll see that I can find a Portkey over there for tomorrow.”
Then of course there was the whole thing with Draco.
“Here!” reiterated Echo.
which somehow along the way turned into Holle.
“I'm sorry, Pansy. I should have made it clear earlier. I was a right prick.”
The fire was already lit, with Scoffer curled around Dreamer to one side of BraveHeart who was sedulously working on painting onto four masks of different shapes.
For a second, the redhead looked like he would bite back, but then he just shrugged. “Whatever, Ferret. Now–" he turned to his girlfriend, “shall we?”
finish that word!” sounded the voice of a sturdy woman through the night. She had appeared in the door frame presumably to see what the ruckus was all about.
Malfoy threw his hands in the air in frustration. “Is everyone on this table one sandwich short of a picnic?”

“Wh-what was that? Was – is that really Holle?” Harry stuttered.

-ed wand, Draco went: “But you are only–” animals, he wanted to say.
God, what was wrong with this guy? Draco felt his heart flutter awkwardly. “Could you stop sounding like a cheap romance novel?”
Potter grinned at that. “But you're giving me such good groundwork! Anyway, I think it's high time for
On Boxing Day they would juggle a short (!) visit to Draco's parents in France for a Christmas brunch (Draco very much shuddered at the thought already), several charity events (for Manor Library, H.E.D.W.I.G., S.P.E.W. and the Ministry) during the day ('duty hopping' was what Harry had dubbed this), a late tea with Aunt Andromeda and Teddy, a dinner party with Harry's Quidditch team and a Patchers' party at Hogwarts in the evening before a Slytherin get-together at night.
treated him nicely or if that had been just another thing Kreacher had made up. Then, as Master Draco moved into Master Harry's bedroom, 'Master Draco's reality must be the right one', Kreacher thought.” He'd shaken his big ears. “Kreacher didn't know, Kreacher just didn't know.”
“Hm, I didn't quite get that. Could you explain it to me again?”
“It's Potter!”
“I am dating!” Draco bristled.
Something wasn't right. Draco knew it, just... just he couldn't quite catch it. Something about the journal...
“We all walk away on our separate ways and pretend this never happened,” Hermione decreed. “Good night.”
Draco stormed through the deserted halls of Hogwarts. He was fuming and also deeply shaken. The old nursery rhyme about The Wild Hunt, that his mother used to sooth him with when he was frightened by thunder as a child, was playing on repeat in his head. Sure, one said that there was a grain of truth in every myth, but this? If he hadn't been there himself, he wouldn't have believed it either that they could just vanish a person's entire existence.
A song that shows the wishes of the boys - to have a place where nothing changed, a place that holds only good memories.
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,
The problem was, Draco didn't have a name to tell. Even though there was no doubt in his mind that he had come to meet the laughing rider, Draco had no idea what to call him.
“Goodnight,” said Harry.
It was a good in though. “Actually, I have some presents to hand out as well,” Draco said, earning him several raised eyebrows. Okay, yeah, he wasn't known for generosity but could they maybe be a bit less surprised? Gee.
Draco had no time to protest this treatment as Potter was already back on him, straddling his lap and kissing Draco as if he were the answer to all of Potter's prayers. Draco whimpered when Potter's right hand found his left wrist, pinning it down on the pillow, while Potter's left hand slipped under the borrowed Gryffindor shirt and made Draco shiver in anticipation.
“That was fun.” Harry stretched and yawned, putting down the food basket. “Oh, look. Post arrived while we were away.” He unwrapped the package that had been dropped onto the kitchen table. “It's from Hagrid, rock cakes. He and Olympe send their love.”
Father Weasley knit his eyebrows together. “
“Yeah, that. And it could be we are just becoming friends, but it feels like... more?”
“...he said. Can you believe the cheek of that guy?” The whole dinner party erupted in laughter at the story Charlie had just shared.
His fingers followed the words while his eyes darted rapidly from line to line. No Potter. Not a single word about him. In fact, the text made it seem as if no one in particular was responsible for the Dark Lord's downfall. It was as if all of that had just
been thinking. About the Black lineage being extinct, about Kreacher the house-elf listening to Draco's orders, about the dreadful Manor and its close proximity to the gatehouse... and about Grimmauld Place' big library and the cosy bedroom next door.

, no other reason). The only problem was that every morning, Draco had forgotten what he had dubbed his new pet, so that he had finally given in and chosen a congeneric name: Howard; nasty, common name.
“Hey, you two! Stop planning crimes in our living room!” Hermione cut in and with lots of banter the four of them went back to their Christmas preparations.
“Two you'll find when you search for them and two you have here.”
Seeker screamed his disappointment and frustration at the next few walkers (did sweet FA) and then decided to trace the boundary as far as he could.
“Ugh.” Was Potter's immature response to that as he rolled off of Draco, landing on his back with a huff. Then he glanced at Draco apologetically. “Sorry, I just… it’s nice to finally be able to touch you.”
Harry pointed at the cross, “is definitely not your fault, Malfoy. He made his own decisions. No, don't interrupt me now. He was a dumb little shit and I know, he was your friend, but he was his own person and he died because of what
The girl smiled.
Cheers~
Harry smirked. “I rather enjoy that you are in my house, Draco, and yes, I stand by what I said: I like everything about you. Even when you are prickly and difficult, like now.”
(Video has English on-screen lyrics.)
Malfoy had dived through the door, into the darkness.
“Good then,” Harry relented. “Mind you, I'm not worried about me; I just don't want to get
Uh oh, dangerous. Time to change the subject. Harry was grasping for straws.
The real Harry glanced at the to-do-list for Patchers, that now, with the school running, had been put into a corner at the stairs. There weren't that many jobs left, but Harry already knew where he would go anyway, so he dismissed the written tasks in favour of strolling over to the plaques.
Some of the work couldn't be done by one person alone though, which had led to several awkward and/or uncomfortable reunions with old schoolmates. Oh well.
“You,” the sitting wizard slurred. “What, hic, what d'you want?”
“Oh, oh, you can share mine! Do you want some?” BraveHeart had also found them and shoved a piece of half-frozen bread in Harry's face.
I do hope it all adds up, but if you find something that is illogical, please tell me!
“The weight of guilt,” the portrait agreed, nodding solemnly.
“No.” Harry shook his head vehemently. “This is what I want. I always want to be with you. Berchthold said I could, the night he came for you. If we go together we can be reborn together. Isn't that right, Holle?”
But unfortunately, I already know that the next chapter won't make the deadline either. So I'm aiming at August 4th for now. Apologies. (Sorry!! ... Did I say? Sorry!)
“Give it here!” Malfoy snarled and snatched it from the mirage.
“But why get involved at all then? Why the cloak, why
The addressee had tears glittering in her eyes. “They did something to Draco! I know they did!”
Harry slowly ran a thumb over the familiar scene.
“Not likely. Whatever weirdness had our magic not working properly inside that room doesn't seem to affect my spell out here. I sealed the door from the outside.” Draco shuddered involuntarily, the darkness pressing in on them. Also, he was wet. Ugh.
“Alright,” the dragon relented.
At that, Draco raised an eyebrow at her. That girl really had some guts to challenge him so blatantly. Alright, have it her way, but he wouldn't play. “We don't get along,” he said dryly, examining his nails. “He is all that I am not: kind, forgiving, brave – also, easily flustered, oblivious and way too much of a bleeding heart type. In conclusion, he drives me up the walls. And don't talk about him in past tense.”
“I have a name. My name is Harry. Here, it's even written on my jumper.” And with that Harry opened his robes to show the embroidery on his chest. BraveHeart whistled appreciatively and Wolfe made an ooh-sound.
“Mhm,” hummed Harry encouragingly as he slowly kissed a fiery trail along Draco's jaw.
“Ah, someone must have removed the Trip-Wire Entry Spell. Good thing, too, since it was designed to affect Dumbledore's killer and, er..." She glanced at Draco as they entered the dimly lit hallway.
Finally, right before dawn, Harry had returned from the gift trip with an unreadable expression.
“May I?” Hermione didn't wait for an answer and was already casting a simple clean-up spell that left the room in a neater condition. Then she ignited the fireplace and sat down on the 'guest couch' as Draco had dubbed it, a three seater on the left side of the room.
She shook her head. “Alright, listen up: For one, there are the
“I'm sorry, Ginny, I just...”
Harry lifted his wand but was interrupted by a tsk-ing Malfoy who shook his head. “You have to point from slightly above – no, not like that, you berk, a shallower angle, yes, like so – and then say the incantation and at the
“We might have won but for the merpeople joining hands with the fishermen. Both species had decided that they were better off separated than together. Mixing bloodlines, they thought, was filthy.”
“Took your time, did you?” Greengrass gave Draco the stink eye. Okay, this was getting simply weird, considering the witch and he had never interacted much in school. She'd been a bit of a loner.
“I was looking for you, Treacle” Harry replied with furrowed brows, eyeing the closed door suspiciously. “You talked to Portrait-Me?”
It was no use. Harry couldn't fall asleep tonight with everything running circles in his mind and with temptation lying right there at his fingertips. Maybe he should rouse Draco for another round of kissing...
She made to pass the Slytherins, Ron at her heels, when Parkinson grabbed her arm, hard. “Hold on. You said Draco's in big trouble?”
Granger yelled from afar.
Draco shrugged. “Poems. For Vincent.”
Seeker had watched them set up this and that until his eyes had been drawn to a soft Somewhen glow in the shadows, between the trunks. There, almost out of sight, had walked a majestic, giant stag in whose wake all trees had withered. Seeker had recognized him without anyone needing to tell him: Berchthold.
Over there were a few pictures in golden frames squeezed between the books: school-time Slytherins, a wedding picture of Ron and Hermione with the invitation sticking at the side and also Andromeda with Teddy, already so big now.
the only one who remembers Potter because I was with him when it happened. That is the only logical explanation.”
“No, that was awful of me,” Potter shook his head vehemently, “and I truly don't think of you like that, you know?” His blood-shot eyes were pleading now. “I really, really don't think you're a Death Eater anymore. I just,” he swallowed, “I was just looking for a way to rile you up.”
They ignored him. How rude!
“Farewell, my heart, my love, my everything.”
“Yes, but what–”
“What's wrong with him then?” Parkinson made a half-hearted attempt at freeing herself. “Why won't you tell us?”
"...why is she holding a pillow?"
This haughty Malfoy-vibe kind of speech made Harry break into laughter and soon the others fell in.
“Ugh, fine then, do what you want. But seriously why don't you go play with that giant half-brother of Hagrid's instead, hm? He's such a cheerful chap, fun to be with, no?”
There were no parties, there was no heart in it,
“Harry.” The addressee looked up. “Thank you.”
Malfoy gave him a long look and then sighed deeply. “You didn't get that, did you?”
“I'm not! It was the right choice, Draco, truly.”
The horse showed interest in Harry's new laurels and he had to bend his neck a bit to get out of reach, but the palomino was quicker and snatched a leaf from the crown. “Hey, stop it! Geez, you're fast as lightning. Oh, that's what we're going to call you, boy – Lightning!” Lightning didn't acknowledge his new name at all and continued to try and fish leaves from Harry's head with his horse tongue.
“Maybe not. But take it from an old man: Love has always been the strongest magic.” That sneaky old bastard. Like Draco needed metaphors right now. No, thank you.
A great horned owl sailed gracefully down towards them and perched herself on Cassius' broad shoulder. Pansy patted her gently.
What a complex work of tricky magic. Hermione felt the involuntary flutter of being intrigued by a problem that needed solving.
“We told you that Perchta is kind of their 'mother', right?”
“What did you do?” Harry growled, leaning closer into Malfoy's personal space.
“Ah, er, have a cuppa?”
“Can you turn it down a notch?” Draco hissed between gritted teeth. Slowly this was getting on his nerves.
– she says all the lines I can remember from the book? Because I
Harry hummed. “I used to. But I think I can distinguish better now.”
– remnants of people who died and stayed behind, because they felt they still had something important to do here, maybe lingering regrets. They are incorporeal. That is the ghost type we met at school, in the form of the house ghosts for example.”
She walked back to the hidden entry and opened the door. Looking inside, she only found blackness of the kind that gave no clue whatsoever what was in it. Carefully she dipped a hand over the threshold.
Harry chuckled quietly. “Only you can turn an insult into an endearment.” He drew back a bit to better look at Draco, his pupils blown wide. “Proves my point though. Wouldn't have worked if you hadn't meant it. Now...” He leant back in.
Potter cleared his throat. “And it's still a bit awkward between Ginny and me. You know. After the breakup. Even though it was amiable and all.”
“I don't want to hear that!” Harry's anger flared up...
“Maybe she pulled you in as a child,” Half grinned, sobering quickly with a thump to his stomach by Wolfe's elbow. “Kidding. That's just a made-up legend. You know, because people always want to see the bad in The Hunt they say that Perchta is a forest demon who spirits children away into her pond and once they come out, depending on their character, they are either darlings of fortune or changelings.”
“Yes, alright, why not. Come here.” Ron herded them all together.
friends now... and
Coincidentally, their compelling Drarry story
Harry frowned. “Wait, what? So, I did all this for nothing?”
Pulling two Weasley jumpers from the wardrobe (an older green one of Harry's and a brand-new light grey one of Draco's), Harry mumbled under his breath: “Wear this, brought me good luck in The Hunt.”
Draco reacted on instinct. He dropped to the ground, hands covering his eyes. “Potter! Get down! It's The Wild Hunt! Don't look!
“Floo powder, Potter, keep up. So that we could Floo into the Slytherin common room.”
Draco opened the index and was just about to pick a fairy tale at random, when his eyes fell upon a title that sounded eerily familiar: 'Mother Holle'.
the ghost said with maximal glee, “Olive Hornby, that bully, used to swear at me in French. So I learned a bit and
The huge brown eyes of the addressee went even wider and for some weird reason her gaze flickered to Draco. “I is given a present, miss,” she hid her tomato-sized nose behind her hands, “from Kreacher. And I is having to work!” She scooted off.
“What did you do to them?” Hermione suspiciously eyed the out-of-order press people over her shoulder.
What else could Draco have done than to say yes, but deep down he'd known that he would always be queasy about Harry going back to visit The Hunt.
God lord above, was he spared nothing? Dutifully he wrapped the now freely crying young woman into his arms and did his best not to roll his eyes. He was used to the explosive fights of his friends, but he could have thought of a better time for a nuclear fallout than Christmas morning.
The startled hush that followed only lasted for a short reprieve. “Okay, but – I made Alice, thinking that she should give us an idea how to get out, and she did. And you made him, thinking what? That I... should like you?”
Crabbe and Goyle who are always around you? I've never heard you call
Malfoy growled disapprovingly. The way he flashed his eyes at Harry said without a doubt 'shut up, you imbecile'.
“Maybe I've just been waiting for you,” replied Death in his rolling thunder voice.
“Ugh, Potter! You're all wet and dirty! Gross! Did you take a mudbath?” Draco wiped at his lips. Earth was not his favourite taste.
“Dammit! Draco, wait up!”
In the high-ceilinged room, that was as  big as the Great Hall above, house-elves, teachers, Patchers and (as Draco suspected) even a few students, were loudly celebrating.
“Brr, terrible that lake. Oh, hello, Harry! Long time no see.” Moaning Myrtle, squat and bespectacled as always, pretended to shake off water like a dog. “Good thing you gave some light signals or I would have stayed in there for the whole night. Got flushed, you see. Oh, Draco, hi!”
“You know,” Harry ventured carefully and tried the next doorknob over, only to find that that one wasn't real either, “
Hermione had crossed the room and stood now behind the love seat leaning onto Potter's right shoulder, while Ronald perched on Potter's left side on the armrest.
“Oh no!” A flushed Mabel came to a standstill at their side.
“Good morning, sleepyhead! Fallen asleep at the fire, have we?” BraveHeart chirped into Seeker's ear and handed him a piece of dried meat. “Here. Breakfast's on the go.”
“What? A bit busy here, Potter.” Malfoy ducked and Queen Harry's magic pulled so fiercely at Harry that he felt like his intestines were being ripped out.
Wolfe growled. “I've beat your ass a hundred times already, I bloody know the rules.”
“What?” Draco had nearly spilled his tea. Had the Hunt magic done something to Harry's head?
Rounding the table, Malfoy was not listening. “It's about our way out – and more ridiculously, about me –, so I have a right to throw my hat in the ring.”
From what they could see, she was wearing a summer-sky-blue dress under a white apron. A black ribbon held back her blonde hair which fell almost down to her waist. She was reclined in her large arm-chair (topped with a bright yellow cloche) and was petting a rabbit sitting on her lap.
“You're welcome.” The answer was already fading when they advanced back into the bowels of the castle.
Drying his tears with the back of his hand, Harry snivelled. “That's great, thanks, but what if I hadn't healed? I mean, I nearly died anyway.” Draco sharply inhaled and Harry quickly cleared his throat to mask the sound. “My Hunt bracelet was almost red. Oh, by the way, now that I got my memories back I guess that the initial red knot was there because I've already been dead once, rather than for having a death wish?” Death nodded. “Right. But before I left The Hunt, there had only been one white knot left to go and if I understood that correctly, then all red would have meant I would have died. So...?”
Suddenly, there was something to do with the endless hours of the endless days. Helping with patching up the castle seemed like a useful thing, like if he repaired the school he could somehow repair a piece of his messed up past.
“They were just here. Potter... was just here,” Draco whispered devastated.
, remember?”
Draco shivered. “Let's go then.”
Lastly, a warning: This chapter has a sad scene related to dying. Brace yourselves.

“It's New Year's, you prig,” the other boy returned tenderly, wiping gently a tear from Draco's cheek.
“I know, I heard it. Ember, are you ready?”
Ice-cold fear doused Harry. 'Met before' sounded really, really bad. He stared at Draco, who in turn looked confused. “How so?”
“Didn't.” But they both knew, he had. Oh boy, he so had.
Draco heard the bathroom door shut. If he knew Harry at all, that would take a while. After The Hunt, taking
Hissing at times, the snake was still there, curled up at his feet, seemingly dozing off now. It was nice to have an audience that couldn't spill his secrets to others.
“Everyone sees in The Beginning what they desire most,” explained BraveHeart in an uncharacteristically expert voice. “Unless their want aligns itself with the purpose of The Hunt, which is to catch the prey. Like us. We all see the same.”
Seeker paled, shaken by the words. Was it possible? Hadn't Half said something along these lines as well? What if it really had been Seeker's own fault he had had to go with The Hunt? But one thing was certain: “I will come back. I want to, God, Draco, I want to. So just say my name and we can go right now, yeah? Once will do. Come on!”
,” Potter grinned and Draco wondered, if maybe his own face had caught fire by any chance. What the hell was that supposed to mean? Was Potter being ironic? He must be being ironic.
“Yes,” she nodded solemnly, “a terrible place. Your aura was pitch black back then, but it looks much better now. So, dance?” She held her hand out for him to take.
“No,” said Lacie sternly. “The rule is, jam tomorrow and jam yesterday – but never jam today.”
Draco broke free, coming up for air. “Time out.”
are 'the others'?” murmured Draco at his side. Harry ignored him.
“Draco...” Harry said slowly into the empty room, tasting the sound with his tongue. Without a doubt, Malfoy had turned into Draco now; there was no reversing it. Still the name felt foreign and Harry's stomach fluttered at remembering how Draco in turn had called him 'Harry'.
Grumbling, Seeker rolled over to get away from the hand shaking his shoulder.
; but for everyone else it might be. Let me go, Draco.”
She smiled. “No, you're not.” The smile turned into a grin. “But almost.”
“Now, hold on! I don't even know
Pansy was already marching up the path to the front door, so he had to jog to catch up with her. “What's with Gregory?”
Harry snorted. “Not the worst, eh? You really do know how to make a compliment.”
“One day I was late. I had not got away from my duties early and it was already sunset when I reached the coast.”

(See the end of the chapter for
In the silence of the empty hallway, three blasts from the trumpet were heard, making them both jump.
What was one supposed to answer when one's personal school bully was suddenly being sensible and said all the right things?
It had taken her only a moment to decipher the words though the meaning didn't quite present itself to her yet.
A long silence, then, muffled: “A lot and nothing at all. Nothing that will bring her back anyway.”
“How do you know the Upsters are not taking care of them?”
: Why did you tell my father about the cloak in the first place?”
His gaze slipped back to Potter who was unnervingly still looking at him with that weird expression. What do you say to someone you had hearty loathing for for seven years and then had some moments of silent agreement with during wartime?
“I want a different partner to be stuck with in this hell-hole.”
The sun was setting and spilt a flood of orange gold over the rolling hills. It was getting late.
Dutifully, Potter dabbed at his face and made a move to hand the soaked handkerchief back to Draco. “Ugh, no, keep it. As an early birthday gift.”
, don't you agree?” He held out his hand to shake Draco's and after a moment, Draco took it.
Sitting up, he cleared his throat. “Ahem, Malfoy?”
After one final moment, Harry turned around and walked up the path to his godson.
“Yes, yes.” Draco took a deep breath, willing away his irritation. “This time together? On three.”
Also that time in the afternoon when Ember, Dreamer in arms, had unpromptedly looked at Seeker and nonchalantly told him that Ember, by the way, would kill him for losing the Jolly Rogers every game lately. It had been such an intense moment that Seeker hadn't been sure what to think, Ember's eyes dangerously calm. After a few seconds the travel companion had barked a laugh and shaken his head: “Just joking, man.” But Seeker hadn't been completely convinced. Ember would always have a darkness to him somehow.
The bird croaked.
“Why do you have it then? If it was his?” Granger questioningly put her palm out to touch Draco's wand and after a moment of hesitation he handed it to her.
“Or so I thought. But a lone figure stood on the beach, toes curled into the sand.
“Harry.” Draco's hand closed tightly around Harry's upper arm. “Didn't you
She whipped around, foaming the water with the force of her silver fishtail and they could now see for the first time, where the light around her came from: As part of her necklace, embedded in between her protruding vertebrae, sat a glassy sphere roughly the size of a Snitch, warm glow pouring out of its swirly whiteness in a wide circle.
He had been too lazy to use the long way round to the Patchers' entrance and had entered the castle through the front portal instead.
“Well, excuse us if we're flabbergasted,” Draco snapped, offended. “We've never heard of a fourth Hallow.”
While Harry's heaving slowly subsided, Malfoy simply continued holding his hand. When the blond boy finally spoke, it was barely audible: “You already apologized enough, Potter.”
“Harry–” Teddy started, but his godfather cut in: “Teddy.”
“I see.” Draco carded his fingers through Potter's locks.
Although the Weasel took a defiant stance, it was Granger that answered: “We came to help.”
That reminded Harry of something he had been meaning to ask for a while. He cleared his throat. “Since we're at naming and all, I've been wondering, Wolfe, why is your horse named Binky?”
So he had stayed.
“I'm not gonna sit here and be insulted by the both of you.”
Before Draco could enquire, the story went on.
This time, the door was embedded into the inner wall. Just as round as the other one before, though black.
famous.
“I'm sorry, Malfoy.” Granger faced him now, eyes serious. “I wasn't sure, alright? You've pulled elaborate pranks on us before. Though, to be honest, I think you're speaking the truth this time. It's only that you keep evading when we ask you about... Palmer. See, I just don't understand your motivation.”
? Granger was going to spew? Yikes! No thanks!
Parkinson glared at her. “I promise not to tell on you. For Draco. That should be enough.”

He never got his happy ending, but he left us when the snow fell and I hope that he went with The Hunt.
... and at the fact that Harry himself had taken so long to understand that he liked this softness – along with the sharpness.
“Yes. It's the only place Dobby cannot sense. Because, well,” he shuffled his feet and stared at the tabletop, “because Winky... Winky is still drinking. The other elves sometimes look at Winky like they might send Winky down the Mell. And sometimes they look at Dobby that way, too. Because Dobby likes to be a free elf. So, Dobby and Winky is afraid of the Mell and have turned off messages from down there indefinitely.”
There was a pause before the other boy answered. “I'm hiding. Parties... parties are not really great for me at the moment. But I wanted to come to honour Hogwarts and the Patchers.”
“What amazing friends you have, Harry,” Draco noted quietly. “You really are a darling of fortune.”
Harry's eyelids were heavy. “I don't care.”
It wasn't that much better to look at the adjacent walls though, since all of them (as far as Harry could see in the dim pool of light) were cluttered with paintings of fluffy bunnies and rabbits (and for an unintelligible reason, one badger) that were mostly awake and staring at the unusual sight of two boys snared by some stairs. The only thing amusing about the pictures was the fact that every last one of them seemed to have been painted by the same person: W. Rabbit.
However, when Death set foot on the clearing, the clamour died down. Everyone turned their attention to Harry and they made way when he walked by.
The image of a softly glowing stag materialised before Harry's inner eye. Berchthold sure had looked majestic in his shape-shifted form, walking through the woods. Bizarre to read about this enchanting moment so dryly in written words, but Draco had done a superb job in collecting all this information.
“To help?” echoed Draco confused. “To help with what?”
They saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water ahead. It had paintings of merpeople on it; they were carrying spears, and chasing what looked like the giant squid.
The Weasel had told Draco that those two so different siblings had surprisingly become very tight during the last year. Maybe the missing brother between them made them stick closer together.
Silence. Then: “Yeah, I... it is just hard to be at The Burrow after everything. Especially on Christmas. I mean, everyone's trying their best to act cheerful, but... there are these pauses... in between... where his laughter would have been.” Potter swallowed and Draco felt the sudden urge to reach out and touch his shoulder.
“What is it?” Hermione asked, leaning curiously over to glance at her husband's present.
“Okay, that's enough.” Harry took the flower spray off with the intention of hiding it behind his back. He stopped halfway through, however, and just looked at the thing. It was a wreath with privet as its base, decorated with dozens of white lilies and one single petunia in the middle, as well as a grain of wheat and a stinging nettle on one side. But the thing that really caught Harry's attention was the fact that the flower circlet was glowing in an inner, soft light.
To his horror the boy underneath him started sobbing. Thick, painful sobs that told of big inner turmoil. As if the aggressiveness hadn't been enough of a sign of that.
complaining) his two guests simultaneously turned towards him. Er...
Pansy wouldn't admit it, but she was secretly tempted to try some of the products Granger recommended.
Ember mumbled agreement, but Seeker was not all awake yet. He yawned. “Who is Frigg?”
Happy February, everyone ^^
Flipping pages in the scrapbook, Draco reached a number of breathtaking landscape shots.
She compared her Arithmancy numbers with the ones in the book and frowned.
The baby in the pram gurgled happily as Seeker's hope shattered.
“Hashtag Windsor, hashtag no filter. A selfie with the Long Walk next?”
Howling, Kreacher had then thankfully buried his face in his hands and had enthusiastically nodded to show that he felt the same way.
“DON'T!” Weasley shouted suddenly, making them all jump. “If you say her name, we'll forget her!”
“That's... that's amazing, Malfoy! It really works! All my bruises are gone! Look!” A teensy leg with rolled up trousers came dangling in front of Draco's eyes. “Didn't make me bigger, but Merlin, I feel like I've slept for twelve hours. Try it!”
However, the new angle made it impossible for him to kneel: Before he had been able to bend his feet at the ankles, but now, stuck up to half his calves, Malfoy could no longer do that. Therefore he was now precariously balancing his whole weight on his fingertips, cursing under his breath as he dug his shins into the stairs for purchase.
happy belated Valentine's! Happy belated Chinese/Korean/Vietnamese New Year!
“Ah, no... no.” Seeker's head was foggy.
“See? I told you – he's making it up to mock us,” the twin spat venomously.
Harry snivelled. “No, I never did.”
The whole group broke into good-natured laughter at the clear embarrassment of the floundering BraveHeart.
He fumbled for a moment for his wand and then pointed it awkwardly at the cup with his left hand (not his wand arm, mind you).
“Don' you dare talk about Dad!” Greg roared, suddenly jumping at Draco who wasn't fast enough and landed painfully on his back, his friend's long gorilla arms pinning him down. Greg pulled his wand and pointed it at Draco's face. “You lot went scot-free! You cosied up to Mudbloods and that filth! You don' get to tell me what to do no more! Not you!”
Howard, draped on the rug, eyed the intruder with a whipping tail. The owl ignored him and dutifully delivered its mail to Draco.
Anguis was not wrong. Seeker deflated and swallowed.
“Yeah, alright. Bloody parchment.”

Hullo~

But we sorted it out.
Malfoy only hesitated for a split-second, then he performed a Bubble-Head Charm (a new fashion for students these days, since after the departure of Fred and George, people had taken to imitate them and throw Dungbombs and Stink Pellets to undermine Umbridge's reign) and put Harry onto his head (“Hold tight, Potter!”).
, but mostly people had accepted their relationship. Harry was simply too well-liked and his popularity had rubbed off on Draco like  a red Gryffindor jumper tainting crisp, white shirts in the wash (example totally fictional). Also, once word had gotten out that Draco had helped to save Harry from great danger, the public's opinion of the former rose dramatically. Not that Draco was complaining.
Harry grinned. “If you want it.”
Getting unto his tiptoes Harry peeked into his cup and found it empty. It was terribly weird to be so
Harry folded his arms before his chest. “My name is Harry,” he said with a snarl, not at all amused about being called not only dead a few minutes ago but now a wizard? By the name of Seeker? His irritation bubbled up.
So? Hadn't there been an argument somewhere in that? “Wha-what about the others? People will not like us together. They'll say I hexed you.” Draco was grasping for straws now, not even sure anymore, as to why he was fighting at all, as Harry's lips were barely touching his, the tension unbearable.
“Impressive.” Granger didn't sound condescending. She really meant it. That was... nice. Acknowledging someone else's talent so easily, maybe the know-it-all wasn't as big of a snob as Pansy had always thought her to be.
Death stayed silent for a moment as if considering, then he replied: “Some.”
at the Cedric-badge.
When they landed at Goyle Grounds, Draco felt a pinch. How many times had he been over to play? Yet, he hadn't set foot here for an eternity now. It was surreal.
Potter raised an eyebrow. “Because that's what we do here, Malfoy: fixing things.”
Lacie narrowed her saucer-round eyes. “Well, the others, obviously. The Upsters.” She pointed a spindly finger at the obscured ceiling. “Up there.”
Draco blinked. Looking up close, he had realised that the something hanging on the apparently female house-elf's belt had indeed been a bag of his and Kreacher's self-made biscuits. The things you see when you live long enough...
Harry nodded numbly.
He swallowed. “I would like to formally apologise for all the mistreatment you endured in my residence.” It felt terribly inadequate.
With that Potter moved forward and closed the gap between them. His lips met Draco's with the heat of a thousand fires and the world exploded as Draco melted into the kiss. It was better than he could have ever  imagined. Their lips slotted together perfectly as Draco put his arms around Potter's neck to pull him even closer, burying his fingers in those unruly black curls. Potter tasted like toothpaste and sunshine and Draco couldn't help but moan quietly as a hand cupped his cheek; as a thumb travelled down his jaw and tilted his head up to deepen the kiss. Draco combusted from the inside while Potter's left hand on his hip burned a hole into him. Every playful nip, every press of tongue was answered, mirrored, enhanced. They were completing each other.
“'Very Important Family Friend',” the ginger translated, looking unconvinced of the content of this assertion. He pulled himself together though and added: “Ron says you are an okay bloke and you help out with the store for free and the library...” he trailed off.
Malfoy hummed approval, but stayed still otherwise.
In the meantime, DAIS had: travelled down into the dungeons, squeezed into the dingy lumber room that held the Mell's entrance, looked at the well-opening from all sides and tried various spells without avail.
, this
“That's because they are more like... liaisons. For the future. Draco is too smart to actually consider the likes of them his
,” cut Potter in with a stern face and added after a brief glance at Narcissa. “Neither of us did.”
Instead Draco had lunged head-first into deeper research, making it his goal to find out all there could be possibly known about the lore, so to be prepared next Christmas and snatch Potter back (maybe even earlier than winter time?).
“Yeah,” Harry acquiesced and burrowed his nose in Draco's hair. Then he pulled back a bit. “Why in school?”
?!” screeched BraveHeart suddenly and pointed bouncing at Harry's flower chaplet.
Oh bugger.
As the people had squeezed into every available corner, filling staircases and the entrances of hallways, the portal to the Great Hall was closed and now showed a veiled something hanging on either wing of the door.
Well, since Potter himself could hardly join in due to his momentary predicament, Draco
“It's alright, Potter. You weren't wrong with what you said about me.” Seeing Potter so hurt, Draco was in a generous mood.
Draco felt fire creeping up his face as he almost shouted: “There was NO love confession!”
Potter had also been present the first time Draco had got a fitting here, right before his first year in Hogwarts had started. Oh, he'd been so excited back then (and so pompous, haha).
, let's call them that – they don't really have left-over business, but still feel an attachment to the living, mostly because they died at a young age. They are offered a position amongst the riders and once they have accepted it, The Hunt's own magic makes them corporeal so they can for example grab people, like Palfrey. They take on the purpose of The Hunt. Both of these types are usually just referred to as 'ghosts' by wizards and Muggles alike.”
Draco swallowed. “That's a nice story, Potter.” Harry gave him a stern look. “But maybe you've forgotten I have a 'scar', too?” Draco willed himself to twist their arms around so that his Dark Mark was facing the other boy. “What do you make of this one, I wonder?”
“Luna did this,” Potter pointed out and shrugged off Draco's cloak. He frowned at the coat stand that Draco had bought last February. “This is new though.”
Harry's eyes went round like saucers and he stared first at the paper in his hand then at Life and then at Draco whose expression showed just as much surprise.
Death shifted. “To be quite truthful that was a fluke on my part. My visions are sometimes a bit vague or blurry and don’t come with a timestamp. The one I'd really wanted to make aware was
“You're odd,” said Malfoy absentmindedly. His eyes were glassy as if he were in trance.
“See?” Malfoy's voice was calmer now and by way of experiment he titled the cup and their hands first to the left then to the right. “My fingers are stuck to the handle. You try it.”
Harry had to admit he was quite attractive.
damn crowded.
Draco noticed he was repeating it like a mantra.
“But how did you-? You said you were cursed before. And you couldn’t even
When Harry drifted off to sleep later that night, Draco was already flat out next to him, their limbs entangled and the crumbs of the sandwiches that Harry had ended up making still all over Draco’s bed.
So Harry looked at Draco’s wound himself, carefully examining it as best he could. Then, finding that at least it seemed to be a clean cut, he started to cast healing spells. Every Auror had to learn the basic ones, of course, but Harry had never been particularly good at them. Now he seemed to be doing rather well for a change, though: stopping the bleeding and neatly stitching Draco’s skin together.
Draco tried to say as much, but for some reason the words just didn’t make it out and he ended up having to lean heavily on Potter just to get back to bed.
So, it was only when his stomach started to make admittedly embarrassing noises of disapproval with being ignored, that he decided to ask Draco whether he could make them something to eat.
When they got back to their booth Harry shot a quick glance at where he had seen Malfoy earlier. He found he couldn’t quite resist.
He asked Blaise for the club’s details.
Harry still felt his blood boil, when he made it to the Floo.
It hadn’t worked, though, and he had ended up at his usual club. Where he’d seen Potter. Which had meant the rest of the night had been completely inevitable and utterly, mind-blowingly good.
Draco’s fingers felt slightly cold when they curled into the hair at the nape of Harry’s neck, but Harry let himself be pulled in willingly, finding that Draco’s lips were warm and inviting.
Harry just watched it for a moment, then proceeded to ask: “Can I open it?” It was so quiet that Draco would have missed it, if he hadn’t been intent on listening.
So Draco decided he wouldn’t. Not now. He would give himself today and then it would end all by itself. They would just see each other at work and that would be it: Harry probably wouldn’t invite him to this kind of thing at all anymore. Merlin, he hadn’t even really invited him this time, had he?
“Well, we really should be off now,” Harry said. They had stuck with the holiday story, although Nurie, the girl’s mother, had conspicuously refrained from asking where they were actually going.
“A Knut for your thoughts,” Harry said, bumping his shoulder to Draco’s gently. They were walking to their Apparition Point now, the sun low, the breeze soft and Draco just watched Harry for a moment. Harry looked right back.
The Firewhisky had relaxed him alright, but it had done nothing much to ease Draco’s mind. He’d still found his thoughts wandering off to all things Harry-related, quite without his permission: they just wouldn’t leave him alone.
So, Wednesday had dragged on for what felt like forever, but finally Draco’s long and tedious workday had ended and it was Wednesday evening, nearing seven.
Harry found Draco on the sofa again, but this time he wasn’t asleep. He was reading, leaning against the back of the sofa, one leg tucked under himself, his other foot still on the floor.
“So, tomorrow I won’t be able to make it for lunch,” Harry said as soon as they were inside of Draco’s office some time later. “I’ll be in a meeting with Kingsley.”
Ron and Hermione got in and if they thought anything of the fact that Harry looked the way he did and that Draco was only moderately more dressed - having managed to also put his shirt on, but not having fully buttoned it up yet, or tucked it in, for that matter - they didn’t let on.
Draco stopped in his tracks, considering him for a moment. “Well, David said something about headquarters being on the premises where I, well Francois, works and I-, well, I may have a hunch where those headquarters could be. So I might actually just do that: introduce you today. I’ll first have to check something, though.” He seemed to think for another moment, then said: “In any case: let me tell you where the ingredients are that your Glamour will be selling. Without those you won’t be able to make it in regardless.”
Luna leant in. “Here, drink this.” And Draco did, obediently swallowing the potion she offered.
When Draco woke up again Potter had returned to the room with the phial of Dittany. Draco hadn’t even noticed he’d fallen asleep, apparently slumping against the headboard of the bed.
When Harry bent down to coax Draco into another long kiss full of promise, Draco wasn’t at all surprised. With anyone else it would have been quite embarrassing how little coaxing he’d actually needed.
It felt like home.
It was only then that Harry remembered Malfoy hadn’t been sleeping in his room anymore, that he’d apparently heard him in his own room across the hall and that he’d come here anyway.
“Seriously?” Draco noticed he felt both annoyed and like laughing. His wall was mostly blue now, but his floor had been painted an enormous blob of the same colour too. “Some spell this is.”
Harry watched Malfoy some more and Malfoy just gazed back at him. Then he smiled a little, amused: “What else is there to tell?”
So Draco got up from the floor, but, just like earlier that evening, he didn’t quite manage his usual fluent movements, bracing himself against the wall behind him, still swaying a bit on the spot when he’d finally managed to stand.
Draco shook his head.
Harry nodded. “I’ve helped Ron and Hermione decorate.”
Harry smiled at Draco invitingly, drawing him in, so Draco approached their table - slightly on edge and still not quite sure this was a good idea - when the door swung open and another man came in, all smiles and confidence. Draco recognised him as Oliver Wood straight away.
But of course that just couldn’t last, ending abruptly when a mediwitch came in with Harry’s breakfast. Draco moved back as if stung, taking this opportunity to excuse himself, to get out with at least most of his pride still intact.
Harry just shook his head miserably.
Draco hesitated just a moment: “I-, I haven’t gotten round to hiring people to do it and-. Well, I’ve been really busy.” Okay, that wasn’t the complete truth, but he didn’t want to embarrass himself by telling Harry how he hadn’t been able to get anything much done really: not even getting some painters in.
It really was quite pleasant.
Draco was still panting when he woke up, obviously in a panic, a sheen of sweat on his forehead. “I-. You-.” He watched Harry now, sitting up, his eyes a bit wild. Harry absentmindedly registered that this probably was what he himself must have looked like to Draco every time he’d woken up from a nightmare.
Harry decided to address the most important matter first.
He had moved to France within days, making arrangements to marry Astoria Greengrass within the year. He had liked her and she came close enough to what his parents had had in mind for him. He had figured that if he couldn’t make himself happy, he could at least make an effort to try and have the life
