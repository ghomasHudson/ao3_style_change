“I’m going to go now,” Kingsley says, taking a few tentative steps towards the front door. “You need to be careful. As soon as word goes out that you’re dating Draco, the papers will make your life an absolute Hell.”
spell, but the thread usually appears if there’s a connection between two people. You should be able to tell that things feel different, more…intense. But the bond can appear when you kiss or when you have sex.”
“Did you just call me ‘love’?” Draco asks, arching an eyebrow and looking amused. Harry realises his boyfriend is gloating, so he playfully nips at his neck.
Hermione turns and frowns at them, giving Harry a scolding look, so he’s quiet for the rest of the lesson, trying to stay awake and take notes, but failing to. He’s too distracted by Draco’s fingers, moving on the parchment as he scribbles down his notes. The back of his hands are red over the knuckles, as if he’s punched something, but it’s actually covered in tiny cuts and grazes. Draco moves his hand away when he catches him staring, looking embarrassed as his cheeks turn pink.
“Your job,” Draco replies, his hands on Harry’s hips, chest pressed against Harry’s back. “It’s destroying you. I know you feel like you have to do it, but you don’t owe anything to anyone. You don’t need to be an Auror.”
He doesn’t think he can apparate directly to Scotland and he’s tired, so he goes to the only place he can think of.
“You wrote that sometimes you felt like it was just you feeling like that,” Hermione adds, “but I can assure you that I struggle to get out of bed in the morning, too. I still can’t have sex with Ron.”
“Harry,” she takes his hand, gently, like he might break into a million pieces in front of her eyes, “you need help and I don’t want to lose you.”
“I love you,” it’s barely a whisper on Harry’s lips, but it still makes Harry’s stomach do a somersault.
Draco shakes his head and starts pacing around the room, his robes billowing and his hair covering his face as he mutters something under his breath.
“I always find it soothing,” Malfoy comments, and then he buries his face in a volume on cooking spells. Harry reads the fairy tale book for the rest of the afternoon, wishing he could take it home, for when he wakes up during the night.
“Thanks, darling,” Draco answers, “but I’m not sure about these robes. Shall I wear the burgundy ones instead?”
“Where are my clothes, Harry?” he mumbled, turning to look at him in the dim late November light. He wondered what time it was; how long they had slept for, since the sun was already setting.
“Well, aren’t you a work of art?” he asks sarcastically, and Draco’s hands immediately go for his scarred face, paling as he remembers that he has not cast his
Potter always comes home late, exhausted and grumpy. Sometimes he makes himself a toastie or a sandwich, but most of the time he either skips dinner or gets  take-away. His Auror uniform is always rumpled; a few buttons are missing, and the hem has come undone.
“You always put too much pressure on yourself,” Draco says, a loving smile on his beautiful face. “It’s okay to cry, you know? And to get angry, or to feel like the world is too much. You’re allowed to feel all of that.”
“When Father was sentenced to his life-sentence, Mother went completely catatonic,” he replies. “She wouldn’t speak. She wouldn’t eat. I struggled to get her to wash and go to the loo, Harry. One morning I was so desperate that I took her to St Mungo’s to get help, because I was on my own and had no idea what to do anymore.”
He wishes he were a professor like Marelli. Competent and able to actually help Draco, instead of patching him up when he comes back battered and bruised.
They sat there, panting, unsure what to do, until Harry brought their lips together again, gently. His magic cleaned them both, leaving Draco with a silly smile on his face and his heart beating like a mad tambourine in his chest.
Harry fails to bite back a moan as he tugs on his cock fast, like he hasn’t been able to do in absolute ages. He closes his eyes for a second, but then he opens them again when the usual horrible images threaten to fill his mind with nasty thoughts. He looks at Malfoy instead, at his elegant feet and toes curling in pleasure, at the curve of his pale neck with the scars making their way up towards his beautiful face. He looks at his fingers going up and down his hard cock.
“He’s a little fidget,” Harry says with a grin and Narcissa just smiles, placing her other hand on him and kneeling in front of him.
“Roger that,” Harry replies, and Draco looks confused, so he gives him a peck on the lips and finishes sorting out their luggage.
“He’s clearly depressed,” Draco says, watching Weasley frown and then give him a confused look. “He probably has PTSD.”
He writes to Draco the following morning, asking if they can go together in the new year. He suggests covering Draco with his invisibility cloak and sneaking out during the two hours they have to themselves on Saturday afternoon. He wants to see it, to check if the house is still there, if there’s any trace of Perseus and Henry’s love.
When he opens it, Harry notices the colourful snakes slithering across the fine china, curving around the handles and into the cups.
It all makes sense, but at the same time it doesn’t. Why are they not sitting by House anymore? The change is so baffling that Ron stops panicking, the colour returning to his face as Hermione guides him to the right side of the Hall, and they take a seat next to each other.
There’s a sharp gasp behind Draco’s shoulders before Harry’s body is finally released from the binding spell.
“I was thinking of a picnic by the lake,” Harry says, feeling sheepish. Draco can’t leave the castle because he’s still under house arrest, so Hogsmeade is out of the question. Harry’s thought about it a lot, but the lake kind of reminds him of that time they fished Draco’s books out of the water and he thinks it would be lovely. But maybe he’s wrong.
“I guess we need to talk,” he admits, staring at the crackling fire, remembering the time he saw Sirius’s face appear among the flames. If only he could go back in time and speak to his godfather again, to ask him for advice. He feels so lost and young sometimes, no one to turn to when he messes up.
The wolf has clear ideas of whom he likes or dislikes based on their smell. Luckily, it loves the Weasleys and Hermione, but it dislikes some people Harry actually doesn’t mind (like Cho and Justin), or needs to get along with because of his job (like Robards, for example). It seems to absolutely love Draco’s smell.
“Draco,” Harry says hesitantly, his fingers brushing a loose silky strand from Draco’s face, tucking it behind his ear. Merlin, he’s wanted to do that for such a long time. “What did that spell do?”
“A tea cosy?” Harry ventures. He remembers Petunia used to receive them from her friends at Christmas.
“Is that because of his OCD?” Zabini asks, his eyes fixed on Neville’s back. “Potter, you need to get a move on and organise a date for me with Longbottom.”
“What are all these people doing here?” Harry asks, scratching his head and messing up his hair even more. “It’s four o’clock.”
“Mate, I’m not her grandmother,” Ron scowls, putting his gloves and hat on. It’s a chilly December day, and the wind is freezing. Harry wonders if Draco is dressed warm enough. The Aurors have been making him change into Muggle clothes lately, since the crowds of passers-by seem to appreciate the added humiliation of seeing the ex-Death Eaters dressed up as the people they used to despise so much.
“Yes,” Draco says uncertainly, looking around, his face going pale. “Are you sure you want to announce it in front of the whole school?”
Draco’s fingers still for a few seconds and then they start moving again, tracing lazy patterns on Harry’s hips.
Harry considers sending an owl to Kingsley, to tell him he won’t go back to the Manor the following week. Never again. But he struggles to sleep that night, his mind full of images of elegant fingers on flushed skin, a thick cock dripping come onto a scarred belly, grey eyes locking with his and those pink lips whispering, “
. Besides, we both have everything to lose,” Draco replies angrily. “It has been convenient for you so far, because no one would believe me if I told the papers. But think about other people. They will all assume I forced you or used an
“Can we convince the Ministry to let Miffy stay until the end of August?” Harry asks, and Malfoy grimaces, his elegant little finger sticking out straight as he brings the cup to his lips with a graceful move.
And he feels like a dick, because there’s a part of him who secretly and desperately hopes that Draco’s test will come back negative. Because if Draco’s pregnant, then he can continue ignoring Harry and pretend that nothing’s happened between them. But if it’s Harry who is carrying the baby,
It’s so late; Harry wonders what time it is. The fireworks have stopped, and the house is completely still.
“The Potions book you told me to finish by tomorrow,” he replied, sounding annoyed and Draco smirked, concentrating on his own book, relaxing into the gentle weight of Potter’s head on his thighs.
At lunchtime he finds an owl that looks eager to fly all the way down south and he secures the message to its leg. And then he waits.
“What’s with the swarms of hormonal teenage girls suddenly desperate to take you out on a date?” Draco asks, his eyes still fixed on the potion, jaw suddenly clenched.
“It’s not safe,” Draco shakes his head, eyes finally opening and landing on Harry’s crotch. He bites his lips and seems to regret his own decision, to reconsider. “What if Blaise comes back, or if your friends come looking for you?”
“I will see Draco on Saturday for his community service,” Kingsley says, preparing to leave, the unlit cigarette still between his fingers. Harry’s green eyes narrow, and he stops him with a hand on the Minister’s arm.
In spite of the gory scene in his head, Harry finds himself amused by the story. So he gets his quill and writes a reply.
“I can go out and grab something to eat,” he says, looking at Draco’s pale fingers opening letter after letter. “The local pub makes decent sandwiches. Would your mother be okay with you staying out for the whole day?”
“I heard he comes from Italy,” Neville whispers in Harry’s ear, and Zabini turns to blow him a kiss, making Neville blush so hard that Ron has to stifle a laugh.
“I think it would be good, for both of us,” Harry replies. “But I’m only going if you’re up for it.”
“You’re such a disaster, Potter,” Draco mutters, burying his face in his hands. Harry reduces the distance between them and the feeling gets stronger, radiating in waves of affection and desire from Draco’s trembling body.
“Because my magic’s gone haywire after the Battle and it could be dangerous. At least that’s what McGonagall thinks.”
“I’m fine,” Harry says, transfiguring his watch into a chair and sighing in relief as he sits down. It’s a dark alley and he’s cast a disillusionment charm, so no one will see him.
He felt a wave of nausea at the back of his throat, cold sweat on his back, and he started shaking his head, taking a step back and then another, until he found himself running down the corridor, opening the door to the same toilet where he had hidden so many weeks ago, nearly a lifetime ago. And he emptied his stomach, until he felt tears running down his cheeks, holding his own hair back. He collapsed on the cold floor, catching his breath, a little whimper escaping his lips. And then he heard it.
“Potter, breathe,” Malfoy’s face slowly comes back into focus. “You did what you had to do. I would have done the same to you.”
“If you think you’re going to take advantage of the situation to hurt him,” Pansy hisses, “you’re deeply mistaken, Potter.”
“I was actually hoping I could convince you to spend the night here,” Harry admits, watching carefully how Draco’s expression shifts from cheeky to uncertain.
“You need to go,” Draco says, “Mother will be back any minute and she will ask me a million questions, if she finds you here. And I don’t know if I will be able to answer half of them without giving myself away.”
Harry nods and stands up, wanting to lean closer, to kiss those pink lips and slide his fingers through Draco’s hair. He takes a step back and grabs a handful of floo powder.
“Arse-licker,” Ron mutters, clearly enjoying the fact that it’s Harry getting told off by Hermione for once.
“Alright,” he concedes. “I will use your Galleons to pay for Italy. But I also would like to stop somewhere for a few weeks and start brewing potions again. Luna has kindly offered to open a company in her name to sell my potions.”
“I should be the one thanking you,” Draco says, a loose strand of hair covering his face. Harry reaches for it with trembling fingers and tucks it behind Draco’s perfect delicate ear. It’s a simple gesture that he’s dreamed of being allowed to do for years and he smiles at the thought of finally having this moment, and then feels terrified because he knows it’s not going to last.
“I just guessed,” she says, tucking a loose strand behind her ear and making her parsnip-shaped earring tinkle.
“It’s fine,” Draco mumbles. He lifts Harry’s leg and moves it so that it’s slotted in between his thighs. Their cocks touch and Harry lets out a little moan. “Shall I get you to relax a little bit more?”
“Take me into your mouth,” Draco whispers, his fingers digging into Harry’s thick curls, tugging at them gently. “Slowly. Like that, good boy. Use your hand to stroke the base.
Harry opens the door to his own bedroom and turns the light on. He inhales sharply when he’s faced with the number of things he has taken from Draco’s home. How on earth could he forget about them, he wonders.
,” he whispered, and the emerald green thread appeared, still tied around his little finger, but lying limp and severed, hanging from his hand, still sparking and emitting a faint shimmering light, but irretrievably broken. Since the Battle of Hogwarts.
On Monday morning he Apparates with the rest of the Aurors to Malfoy Manor, knowing full well that he’s making a colossal mistake and that he will regret it. Malfoy’s waiting for them at the door, stiff and solemn in his formal black robes, buttoned up to his Adam’s apple. He looks even paler than usual, white hair resting on his shoulders and falling in gentle waves around his delicate face.
“They have to take me to the Ministry first,” Draco says, eyebrows furrowed. He worries his bottom lip between his teeth and looks at his hands. There are red dry patches at the back, all over his knuckles.
“You know I can’t,” he whispered. He wanted to ask why on earth Harry thought it was fine to remind him, when all he was trying to do was forget, not think about how much he missed his family and his home and his own friends. Instead, he used his wand to clean the mess he had made on his essay.
“I also spoke to Professor Marelli,” McGonagall adds, staring at both of them, folding her hands on the desk. “He told me about the university in Italy he would like you two to attend, and I think that’s a fantastic opportunity for both of you.”
Draco’s been clear about it. He doesn’t want Harry’s reputation to be tarnished with his mistakes. And if word got out that he’s a Veela, his life would get even more complicated, so they’ve agreed not to tell anyone.
“I’m sorry I’m leaving you,” Ron whispers, his voice breaking as a single tear rolls down his cheeks. “I can always come back to help with the shop.”
He kisses Harry languidly, soft and slow, until Harry feels like he’s melting, his fingers tangled in Draco’s silky blond hair. They kiss for what feels like ages and then unfortunately it’s time to go. They both crouch under Harry’s cloak and quietly walk to the Slytherin common room. Draco kisses him goodnight and Harry feels like he’s flying back to Gryffindor Tower, his heart light as a feather.
“I suppose we ought to start,” he murmurs and walks towards Harry, making him take a step back when the blond is just a foot away from him. The Slytherin got taller over the summer, Harry realises as their eyes meet and he has to tilt his head up. Malfoy smells nice too, like expensive cologne and something forbidden that makes Harry’s stomach flip in an unexpected way.
“Shall we go to your room?” Harry asks when he’s done. Draco lingers for a few more minutes, his fingers gingerly stroking an old wireless, a trunk containing his grandmother’s old clothes, the photos of his mother as a child.
Harry already feels like punching him, and it’s only nine o’clock in the morning, but he tells himself that he’s here to help the Aurors. He’s not going to let the Slytherin get under his skin.
“You collect teacups?” Harry asks, his lips tugging into a smile at the thought of Malfoy arranging an array of china and sipping tea, his little finger raised in a posh pose.
He swishes his wand and Harry’s underwear disappears, leaving him gasping and clutching at his crotch. Another quick spell and his Cupid costume is safely secured to his body, no risk of showing his family jewels.
When he enters the portrait hole, he finds the fire still on and Draco sitting on a sofa next to it, a book in his lap.
Draco frowns and then takes the box, opening it with trembling fingers. He lets out a choked sob when he sees all the photos, covering his mouth with his hand as he picks one up and tears start falling down his cheeks.
“Draco, I know you well enough to figure out that something is wrong,” he says. “Now, it’s Friday afternoon and you can tell me immediately or you can spend the weekend brooding like a moron and tell me on Monday morning. But I will send you at least a couple of owls to ask you how you’re feeling in the meantime and we both know you hate that.”
“Whose service do you require, Potter?” Parkinson asks, crossing her arms in front of her chest. Harry notices she’s wearing some pretty tight robes with lace around her neck.
Harry sighs and starts reading the book Malfoy has given him and it turns out to be surprisingly interesting and absolutely perfect for the essay he needs to write.
“Er…” he starts, “there’s a guy that I like, but I don’t know if he’s available or if he would even consider me…”
“Don’t worry,” McGonagall says, her tone calm and eyes kind. “I have a friend who is an experienced Mind-Healer. I will send her an owl straight away, and I am sure she will be happy to come to Hogwarts to offer her help.”
“Excuse me?” McGonagall said, raising an eyebrow and fixing a glacial glare on Smith that made even Draco feel uncomfortable, but apparently didn’t work on the blonde Hufflepuff.
When his third finger slides into Draco’s tight hole, the blonde moans and begs him to just fuck him and Harry takes a shuddered breath, moving behind Draco and lining up his lubed-up cock. He gently prods Draco’s entrance, relishing the mewling sound that comes from the blonde and then he places his hand on Draco’s hip and pushes.
Chapter 4 turned out absolutely huge, so I've decided to split it into two chapters. The good news is that the second part is nearly finished and I should be able to post in a couple of days (or tomorrow if I'm lucky and I get enough time to write today).
“Maybe it’s because I like you,” Harry admits, his cheeks warming up. Draco’s eyes widen, and they stare at each other for a few endless seconds.
“We ended up staying at her place and watching telly,” Harry shrugs. “Her mum was worried I might try to have sex with her, so we had to be under her watchful eye the whole time.”
“How can you say that?” he asks, furious. “These are your things. They cost a fortune and you love them because they’re beautiful, you said it yourself. How can you give up on them so easily?”
“Draco, I don’t care what happened last year. I don’t care how many people you sent to the Hospital Wing. You need help now.”
“So, it turns out that I had a hidden stash of your chai tea in my suitcase,” he says with a sweet smile, his fingers reaching for Harry’s, pulling him closer. “And I also made you a slice of toast with the chocolate sprinkles we got in the Netherlands.”
“You’re the first person who’s ever touched me there,” Draco says, taking Harry’s hand and moving it from his hip to the globe of his arse, letting Harry’s fingers squeeze him. “Your fingers inside me…they felt amazing,
But this year everything felt different. He had nothing to look forward to. He had no home to go back to. He couldn’t see his parents and his friends had all somehow gone quiet in the past month or so, too busy with their new lives to exchange owls with a former Death Eater. All except for Goyle, who was only allowed to write once a month and had wished him a merry Christmas in his December letter, ignoring the fact that there was nothing merry about it.
, whispered in a desperate tone, makes Harry groan and let go of his lover. He summons a small bottle of lube, the same type as the one Draco had at the Manor, and spreads some on his fingers.
the Aurors are going to arrive. He can’t stomach putting Draco through the same experience again. The Minister replies saying that he will send an Auror around two o’clock in the afternoon, so Harry relaxes, knowing that he will have the whole morning to spend with Draco.
Harry puts Draco on his hands and knees, running his hands along Draco’s warm skin, tracing his spine with his lips, one vertebra at a time. He flicks his tongue out, teasing Draco’s rim after cleaning him with a wandless spell. Draco gasps, and Harry closes his eyes and spreads Draco’s cheeks with his hands, thumbs digging into soft flesh as he lets his tongue make Draco fall apart. By the time he inserts the first slicked-up finger, Draco is already rock hard, but Harry still takes his time, even though he’s desperate to chase his own release. He fingers Draco slowly, noticing how the light from the street casts shadows on Draco’s pale skin, making him look almost ethereal.
“Vuoi sposarmi?” Harry asks, fishing out the box with the ring from his pocket and unshrinking it. He drops down on one knee, yelping at how cold the water is, and Draco starts laughing through the tears, looking down at him with flushed cheeks and wobbly lips.
Both Ron and Neville are snoring loudly when he gets in his room, so he takes a quick shower, trying not to make any noise.
Harry’s eyes open wide, surprised by the kindness Malfoy is showing. He had meant to ask for Sirius’s photos, but completely forgot about it.
Then one afternoon, as he’s filling in paperwork at home, he feels a sudden sharp pain in his back. He doesn’t realise straight away he’s in labour, not until Hermione appears with some take-away lunch for him and ends up taking him to St Mungo’s instead.
from them, and never leaving them alone. “I want Draco to stop being treated like shit, hexed and spat on, both at school and in the streets, when he’s under
“Come here,” Harry says, and it comes out as a husky murmur, his fingers digging into the soft fabric of Draco’s green hoodie, pulling him closer until their lips collide and Harry is pushing him against the door he’s just closed. “Merlin, I’ve been dying to kiss you all day.”
“Pretend I didn’t say that,” Harry replies, wanting to avoid another rant about how barbaric Muggles can be.
Harry hasn’t realised how fast his breathing was until Draco stares at him, grey eyes worried as his fingers touch Harry’s face.
“Oh…” so Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, was not as straight as Draco had always assumed, “Charlie who?”
“Smooth as usual, Potter,” the blond mutters, sitting next to him and unpacking his belongings. He places his stationery neatly on his desk, the quill perfectly aligned with his parchment, turning the ink pot so that the label faces him.
Harry still doesn’t do it. He practises the words in silence, or out loud when he’s alone. He asks Manuela to take him to town and chooses a ring for Draco. He comes home, feeling like a criminal with the little blue velvet box hidden in the pocket of his coat, burning a hole through him, and he hides it in his sock drawer.
“Keep your door open, dear!” her mother calls from the corridor. Harry raises his eyebrows at Hermione, and she just shakes her head and sighs. They sit on her bed, and Hermione casts a silencing charm on the room.
“This is so cool!” he exclaims, a smile on his lips. “Is this part of your fancy teacups collection?”
“Does it need to be something specific, or can I choose a design?” Harry asks, touching his chest, an idea forming in his head.
“Breathe, Potter,” Malfoy says, sitting up and grabbing his wand to cast cleaning charms on both of them. “You’re going to end up having a panic attack after a wank. Do you want to take a shower?”
“Sleep,” he orders calmly, and Harry nods, pulling the blankets up to his chin. He should feel out of place, all alone in Malfoy’s bed, but as he inhales the scent of his former nemesis from his pillow he relaxes, letting sleep claim him again. He wakes up from an unpleasant dream just before dawn, and Malfoy is there next to him, sleeping peacefully. Harry gently cups his cheek and lets it rest there for a few precious seconds, feeling Malfoy sigh and mumble something in his sleep, moving towards his touch. He’s so warm and soft.
There’s a moment of silence when the only sound Harry hears is Draco’s regular breathing. A pale finger traces the zigzag of his scar, then his nose and lips, lingering on the small cut Harry has made by biting at it too much.
Harry goes to the bathroom while Draco rearranges the books. He washes his face and brushes his teeth, then he remembers the rest of Draco’s possessions hidden in the other room.
Being unable to shed a single tear. Laughing hysterically at Sirius’s funeral and hiding his face in Hermione’s hair.
“I don’t care,” he says. “The papers, my friends, the rest of the world. I don’t care. The people who matter will understand, because they know me. If they don’t, that is their own business. But I don’t want you to get hurt.” He pauses before he asks a question that has yet been unanswered, no matter how many times he’s asked it. “What do
Okay, so I have to admit that things got out of hand and I managed to put half of my original planned plot into this chapter, so some of the smut has been moved to the last one. I'm planning on finishing it in the next two weeks top, so stay tuned.
“I missed you, too,” Harry replies, squeezing him back and exchanging a fond look with Hermione. “How did it go?”
“But Harry,” Ron argues, making him stand up and pace around the room, wishing to be somewhere else, wishing for this moment to end. “We want to do something. Mum has spent the past two days cry–“
He kneels on the floor and talks to her, tells her about his long days and the house feeling empty and dark. He doesn’t tell her about the letters, nor about Malfoy.
Harry’s tense all day, snapping at Malfoy every time he says something that annoys him. The air sizzles with his rogue magic, and his leg keeps jumping up and down, making Malfoy lose his patience.
“Darling, are you sure about this?” Narcissa asks her invisible son and Draco says that he is, that he wants to go.
“You can’t?” he asks, dumbfounded by Harry’s confession. Harry shakes his head, feeling a little lost and broken, like a malfunctioning piece of a puzzle that doesn’t match with anything. But then Draco kisses his lips tenderly, humming against his mouth. “It’s okay. We’ll get there, my lovely. You’re absolutely fine.”
He tells the readers about Parkinson’s shaved head, of drops of blood around the words ‘Slytherin Slut’ on a teenage girl’s skull.
“Don’t forget your arrows and bow,” Zabini says, looking cool in his leather trousers and shimmering shirt. Pansy swirls around in her strawberry dress and Harry just gives up and takes a seat at his usual position, right next to Goyle, who is quiet as usual.
Draco started going to the library again in the early morning, in spite of Harry’s pleas to stay in bed with him a little longer. The dark circles under the Gryffindor’s eyes were gone, because he was having less nightmares now that they were sleeping together. Sometimes Draco woke up to Harry thrashing next to him, whimpering in his sleep, and all it took was a gentle word whispered in his ear, a caress on his head, Draco’s warm arms around him and he calmed down, drifted back into a peaceful sleep.
“It’s fine,” Draco replies with a shrug. “But I had to buy a car, and since it was kind of useful for when I was trying to avoid reporters, I’ve kept it. Now I use it when I go shopping in Muggle areas.”
Harry mutters something unintelligible, feeling ashamed as Malfoy laughs at him. The book doesn’t open, but Harry ends up staying on the couch. Mainly because he’s afraid that if he moves the tome from his lap, Malfoy will notice that he’s painfully hard. And partly because Malfoy smells too good and feels warm next to him. It’s a citrusy smell, slightly flowery, and Harry closes his eyes, inhaling it whilst Malfoy is distracted with his book.
“Cup of tea?” he asks and Malfoy nods, looking around the house as he sits down, staring anywhere but at Harry.
The days go by and they settle into a routine. Harry goes to the club every day after school and little by little the other students stop asking him for autographs and start seeking help with Muggle Studies. Harry actually likes feeling useful, making other people’s life easier. He feels satisfied when he sees a lightbulb moment, explaining how Muggle appliances work or how Muggles cook.
“Well, you keep staring at Malfoy’s arse the same way you look at treacle tart,” Neville points out.
They stare at each other for a few minutes, the air sizzling between them when Harry’s magic starts playing up. It has been a constant since the War ended. He has been trying to stay calm, to not lose his temper, because things blow up when he does. But sometimes Harry simply can’t control it, and he doesn’t want people to know. Malfoy seems to realise that there’s something wrong when the pan starts vibrating and the sauce is suddenly bubbling too vigorously. The wooden spoon that Harry’s holding starts to bend, snapping in half and sending splinters flying across the table. Malfoy’s brows crease and he breathes slowly.
He marvels at how intimate it feels to dress Draco, possibly more than undressing him in the rush to touch him. He carefully gets each button into its eyelet, fastening robes and straightening Draco’s collar. He ties the knot of his Slytherin green tie with extra care, brows furrowed in concentration as grey eyes stare at him.
“It’s nice,” he decides as he piles it on his fork with some meat. “Unusual but it complements the meat quite well.”
“Darling, I’m so sorry! I will fetch you some Pepper Up,” Narcissa replies, disapparating with a crack and giving Harry some time to find his bearings.
“That’s never going to happen,” Harry says, holding him closer, cupping his cheeks with warm hands. “Stay with me, Draco. Until we get tired of living here, then we can find a new house. Somewhere with a nice bright kitchen, where you can make dinner. Somewhere with a lovely garden, where we can sit in the sun. Stay with me until we get old together. Please, stay.”
Draco barges in, without thinking, raising his wand against the stranger. The man is standing a few inches away from Potter, whose green eyes are huge.
Harry reads it again and again, the short line at the very end making him feel something he can’t explain. Knowing that Malfoy is bored too, that he felt the need to share it. It makes his stomach feel lighter, somehow. He eventually falls asleep, the letter abandoned on his bedside table, and when he wakes up in the morning, he writes a reply while he’s munching on his toast.
“It does?” Harry asks, surprised, and then it happens. Malfoy shifts underneath him, lifting his legs up and Harry feels the blond’s cock touching his arse. Like a promise of something to come.
“We wait for them to try to smuggle the unicorn horns into Dover,” Draco answers, but Harry shakes his head, fingers going nervously for his curls.
“We could go out and play a Seekers game, if you want,” Harry suggests, feeling a bit sheepish. Malfoy’s grey eyes lock with his and he’s quiet for a few minutes.
Smith gags in the background, and Hermione looks incredibly uncomfortable as she takes notes. Zabini’s eyes meet Harry’s across the room, a quiet challenge in his gaze, and Harry nods. As soon as the professor asks them to stand up and find a partner, Harry takes Neville’s elbow, and he gently pushes him towards Zabini.
They tuck in and it tastes absolutely divine, so much so that Harry can’t suppress a loud moan, and Malfoy stares at him, his cheeks colouring in a way that Harry can’t help but find attractive. He likes it when Malfoy’s pale skin flushes, and his mind starts wondering if it would turn red if Harry kissed it. If it would bruise easily, were Harry to suck on it hard.
“It’s a good job I’m not asking him out, then,” Harry replies. Parkinson smirks, her eyes boring into him, as if she didn’t believe a single word he said. “Night.”
“I hurt so many people,” Malfoy replies in a thick voice. “I chose the wrong side. Fought for a maniac. I stood aside and did nothing while they were torturing and murdering innocent people. I tried to kill Dumbledore. Salazar, I tried to kill
Harry hears noises from outside the small door. He can see a faint light peeping through the slit at his feet. There’s a strange smell and he wrinkles his nose, looking at Draco’s face.
“I know,” Harry says shakily, stroking his back and laying a kiss in the crook of Draco’s neck. “I know…”
“Tell you what, sweetheart?” Draco asks, summoning a sponge and soap and lathering Harry’s shoulders and chest.
By the third day, Harry’s about to send Kreacher to a pet shop to buy him a bird, when he suddenly hears the familiar sound of Argo tapping on the window and he runs to open it, snatching the parchment from his leg with so much impatience that the bird screeches indignantly.
The room is suddenly plunged into complete darkness and Harry can’t see anything. He stands there, listening to his own heart beating madly in his chest and to Draco’s erratic breathing.
Potter’s magic sizzled, the air crackling with it, and Draco felt afraid of him, for the first time since they had started living together, but then Potter grabbed his shoulders and took a deep breath, trying to calm down.
,” the Slytherin accuses, disapproval written across his gorgeous face. “He was bleeding, and he was in pain, but he still insisted on waiting for you, Merlin knows why. But you weren’t there, so Pansy and I took him to the only person we knew would be kind enough to see past the fact that he was a Death Eater. And I’m glad we did, because Marelli was a real gentleman,” Zabini says. He glares at Harry, as if he were nothing but scum. “Unlike you, may I add.”
“Come on, son,” Arthur says, and George’s fork suddenly stabs the table with such force that it bends in half.
“What do you mean you’re not coming to the Burrow for Christmas?!” Ron shouts, clearly upset. “You could have told me you wanted to stay here! I would have asked mum so that I could stay with you.”
“It happens sometimes,” she simply said. “People react differently to grief. It’s not like you were laughing because you found it funny. It was just a nervous reaction, and it’s perfectly fine.”
After Antwerp they visit Gent, and Harry finds a pastry shop that makes speculaas croissants and considers moving there for the rest of his days.
“But I want to,” Harry replies, his hands circling Draco’s waist, “I want to be your mate. I’ve never been anybody’s anything. I want to belong to you.”
Harry’s eyes are still shut when he feels Draco’s hand squeezing his, keeping him grounded. Draco casts a strong
“Why do you care, Potter?” Zabini retorts, suddenly defensive, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “You’re not still stalking him like you did in sixth year, are you?”
Harry tenses up and remembers Hermione’s words, insisting on him attending a session to discuss his problems. He feels his hands becoming clammy and cold, his chest getting tight.
“It’s something you normally use to mix up batters or wet ingredients. You can use it with egg whites to fluff them up,” Harry explains with a smile. “Wait, I’ll draw one for you.”
“Yes, come for me,” Draco murmurs, looking at him in awe, his eyes sparkling as he watches at Harry unravelling in his hand, stroking him through his orgasm as Harry gasps and whimpers. “You’re so beautiful.”
“Wake me up,” Harry says, running his fingertips on Draco’s scars, then rubbing his thumb on soft pink lips. “When you can’t sleep because you’re anxious. Wake me up, and I’ll keep you company and help you get back to sleep.”
“Harry, are you okay?” Hermione asks, her eyebrows creasing in concern. “You’re really pale, and your hands are shaking. Why don’t you sit down for a bit?”
“Wait,” Draco says, his voice hoarse, and then he moves, pulling Harry up into a sitting position. He kisses him messily and Harry can still hear the squelching noise of lubed up fingers, and can feel Draco moving against him. “I’m getting ready for you.”
Harry can’t help but blush, realising that Kingsley is looking at him with a mixture of surprise and curiosity, but not the contempt that he was expecting.
“I’ll see you around,” Harry says, feeling like an idiot. He’s made a fool of himself and he has no idea how to salvage the situation. Malfoy must think that the rumours about him losing the plot are true. “Do you live in the village?”
By Sunday evening he’s bored to death of being stuck in the Hospital Wing and then on Monday morning Madam Pomfrey finally allows him to leave, giving him a list of food and drinks he’s not supposed to have to help with his recovery.
“I brewed it myself,” he replies, running his fingers along a cut as his magic seals it shut. “Slughorn checked it afterwards, so it’s safe for you.”
“The Unspeakables are working on it. And St Mungo’s. But they don’t seem to have a clue,” he said, shrugging, “they only know it’s linked to what happened in the Forest.”
Harry doesn’t even know why he follows Malfoy’s instructions. He doesn’t take orders from Slytherins. But it somehow seems easier to just do what Malfoy asks. Harry’s tired of searching for the right answers, of deciding what the right thing is all the time. For once, maybe, he can just do what Malfoy says. At least the blond seems to know what he’s doing.
“Are you okay?” Harry asks, noticing the dark smudges under Draco’s eyes, his hollow cheeks, craving to run his fingers on his face and wipe the tiredness away. “Have you been eating enough?”
“It’s not, really,” Draco whispers, looking at Harry’s lips. “I have so many rituals and fixations that I feel stuck in my head. Like I can’t move. Like I’m a prisoner of my own brain.”
“You’re barmy,” Draco says, shaking his head. “I’m freezing my arse off. Let’s go take a hot shower.”
And Draco wants to stand up and go there, climb into Potter’s bed and kiss him hard and messy, but it’s all too much. Potter is moaning across the landing, calling Draco’s name, only a few feet away, begging with Draco’s name on his lips. And soon Draco is coming, coming,
“No idea,” Zabini shrugs, and then his face lights up when Neville appears from the Gryffindor’s dorm. “Morning, Longbottom. You look particularly charming today.”
“There’s always Blaise,” Pansy says, stroking his cheek. “And Millie said she’s going to buy a house in the countryside next year. You could live with her. We’ll find a solution, darling.”
The party is a mess. There are Weasleys everywhere. Draco didn’t know there were so many. He spots his aunt Andromeda with a toddler in her arms. Cousin Edward.
Draco’s lips curl up in a tiny smirk as his fingers slide into the elastic band of Harry’s underwear, pulling it down. Harry shivers, standing naked and vulnerable in front of him and letting Draco take him all in. Grey eyes skim across his skin, an invisible caress that leaves Harry light-headed and desperate to feel Draco’s hands on him.
And it makes no sense. Because that’s not part of their deal. It’s just something Harry desperately needs and that Draco is willing to give him.
He hears Draco’s sobs. He feels his hands all over him, trembling fingers touching Harry’s face and arms, searching for his palms. But he goes on, because he doesn’t think he can do this a second time.
“If you’re done being a dick as usual,” Harry says, crossing his arms in front of his chest, “I suggest we get started. I don’t fancy spending the rest of my summer sorting out books with you.”
Harry can hear Draco’s loud intake of breath and he takes his hand,  smiling at the familiar comforting feeling.
“Touch yourself,” Malfoy says, his voice odd and deep. “You’re so hard, Potter. Does it turn you on that you marked me as yours?”
during his Trial. He clearly stated that Draco hadn’t wanted to join Voldemort, but he had been severely punished for refusing to and then had been forced by his father to take the Mark.  “How is that not barbaric?”
“Hmm,” Harry whimpers, and then he lets out a loud gasp as Draco’s slicked up finger gently presses against him, slowly sliding inside as Draco suckles on the tip of his cock.
“I need to find a quiet place to concentrate, otherwise I’ll never get this fucking essay done,” he declares.
Harry looks at the photos he receives, puts them all away in the drawer of his desk. He stores Malfoy’s letters in a nice wooden box that he finds in one of the bedrooms, a pattern of snakes and apples carved on the side. He reads them over and over again, trying to get the days to go by.
“I came back two years ago, did my teacher training course at university in the UK and then last year I found a job at Teddy’s primary school.”
“Please tell me the ferret hasn’t turned into a merman again!” Ron exclaims, spilling half of his beer all over the table as he turns to face Harry. “He kept on moaning for ages, saying that he still stank like fish.”
“Wait until my friends find out that I shagged the Saviour,” the bloke says, and then Draco hears the soft sound of fabric against skin.
“There you go,” Harry whispers, gently sucking on Draco’s balls before he inserts a second finger. “We’re going to take our time today. I don’t want to miss a single thing, since I finally get to see you.”
They spend the afternoon reading in silence.  Before Harry realises it, the day is over and the other Aurors have come to collect him.
“I don’t know,” the midwife replies. “You’ve already sent him your Patronus twice and I wouldn’t advise wasting any more of your magic. Now, focus on breathing.”
“What’s wrong?” Harry asks, his skin itchy, magic still running at a million miles per hour in his veins.
“I told you to stay away,” comes Draco’s muffled voice from his bedroom. Harry’s been there a couple of times, so he gingerly approaches the open door, waiting for Draco to tell him to fuck off.
“I can explain,” Harry mumbles, thinking of what Hermione would recommend doing. Probably just tell the truth and face Narcissa’s wrath.
He knows it’s not a great start, and he has been struggling with DADA so much this year. Their professor constantly gets on his nerves, making him lose his temper. His magic has been going haywire lately, making Marelli stare at him with a concerned expression on his infuriatingly gorgeous face.
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” he whimpers, his hands shaking so badly as they clutch Draco’s robes, pulling him closer. “I swear nothing happened. We just went shopping for Christmas presents, and the reporters were everywhere.”
He packs his trunk, shrinking his clothes and his books under Potter’s watchful eye. He takes the photos of his mother, and a few of her possessions, just in case one day she remembers who she is. Just in case she remembers she has a son.
But Harry thinks that loving someone is not something that should be given for granted. There’s no “of course” for him when it comes to his biological family. He thinks about Petunia, and he shudders.
Harry can’t really tell him the actual reason he’s been looking at Draco like a lovesick puppy. Hermione narrows her eyes at him and temporarily abandons her essay.
“Here she is,” Ron announces with a smile, spotting his sister as she makes her way through the crowd.
“Harry, you’re the most generous person I know,” he says, his eyes growing fond, “you spend your days raising money for a hundred different charities. You used your savings to fund your friends’ business and you gave all of your best brooms to Teddy and the Weasley kids.”
“Get lost,” Parkinson shouts, grabbing Draco’s hand and dragging him to the Slytherin’s bedroom. The door shuts behind them, and Harry feels like knocking it down with his magic.
“You’re so tight,” Draco whispers, kissing the base of his spine as he slides his fingers in and out, curving them until he’s hitting that spot that makes white sparks dance in front of Harry’s closed eyes. “I’m going to add a third finger, okay?”
“You can have me,” Draco whispers against his hair, rocking to imaginary music. “What do you want to do to celebrate you leaving your job?” Draco asks, stroking Harry’s messy curls. “I can take you out to dinner, or to the Muggle theatre. We could go to that Indian restaurant you’ve been wanting to try for ages.”
“Why?” Harry asks, “Theo’s nose is crooked and his teeth are all wonky. And besides, he’s a twat. I have a perfectly straight nose and good teeth. Okay, I’m a bit short, but I reckon it’s because I didn’t have enough to eat when I was a kid. And I never get sick, plus I don’t snore.”
Time seems to stretch, the week feels never-ending, between lessons and essays, never-ending homework and evenings spent studying. December is around the corner and Harry can’t stop thinking about Christmas, about the fact that he would love to spend it with Draco, but he can’t. He has agreed to spend the holidays at  the Burrow and he doesn’t even know how he will manage to sneak out to meet up with Draco on Saturday afternoon.
“What the fuck did these wankers make you do?” Zabini hisses, stabbing his potatoes with too much force.
“You said that you wanted me,” Harry explains, taking a step forward in the dark, “and then when I saw you, I felt the same. I want you too.”
And after dinner they sat on the white sofa, reading in silence. Potter’s feet were always freezing and Draco’s bottom was warm, so he started sliding them under him, to warm up. And Draco somehow let him, missing the comfort of another human being’s touch. Missing Pansy’s fingers sliding through his hair while she chatted about unimportant things in the Slytherin common room. Missing his mother’s gentle hands and affectionate hugs, Goyle’s strong arms around his shoulders, Blaise’s hands and lips on him when they both felt horny. He hadn’t been touched in so long that even that simple contact of Potter’s cold feet under his bum felt like heaven.
“Let’s get you dry,” Harry replies, leading him to the bedroom and picking up some clean robes for Draco. He casts a drying charm on his white-blond hair and then grabs a brush from Draco’s bedside table and starts combing his hair. It feels surreal to be allowed to touch Draco like this. To look after him.
He goes back home and writes to McGonagall, saying that he’s going to be there and asking for the list of books he needs to buy.
“I am well aware that your priorities and plans might have changed after last year,” the Headmistress says to the students before they head out to their first lessons of the year. “My office will be open for you all week, in case you decide to change your N.E.W.T.s options. Feel free to ask your professors for permission to leave the lessons to discuss any changes in your timetables.”
“He had nowhere to go!” Potter shouts, his magic flaring up and making Draco’s skin prickle. “Was I supposed to let him live on the streets? How was I going to find him to check on him?”
“Nice to meet you, Harry,” the professor says, and then the other eighth years start arriving. Ron and Neville sit next to Harry, Terry and Hermione are behind him. Draco arrives a little bit late with the other Slytherins, and they end up sitting at the very front of the classroom.
He’s been through a war. He’s survived worse gossip. If he wants to go on a date with a bloke, it’s really no one’s bloody business.
Draco’s lips are suddenly on his, hungry and urgent, moving so that he’s on top of Harry, straddling his hips and rocking against him. Draco deepens the kiss, making Harry moan, feeling his soft cock react instantly to the sudden attention, in spite of having come not even ten minutes before. And then Draco’s mouth is on his neck, sucking a bruise onto his skin, going down to capture a nipple and suck on it.
Harry puts his own coat on and holds Teddy’s hand as they walk down the little country road that leads to the town centre. Harry moved to the small village less than a month ago, to be closer to Teddy and Andromeda and spend the summer holidays with them. He used to floo from his London flat a few times a week to look after Teddy, but there was no point in paying an arm and a leg to rent a place he didn’t need anymore. He’s better off now, breathing fresh sea air and enjoying a quiet life in the middle of nowhere, with no reporters from the
Malfoy grabs a chair and deposits his book on the table, sitting down opposite Harry and watching in fascination as he chops red onions and bacon and then puts them in a pan with some olive oil.
Draco just stares at him, waiting for an explanation, but Harry doesn’t think that he can put it into words, not yet. The fact is, he has never been anywhere, but that doesn’t mean that he hasn’t thought about it.
Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater and current boyfriend, is sitting behind the wheels of a red Peugeot 206.
“There’s something I wanted to show you,” Draco says, taking his hand and leading him to the spare room. He opens the door and it’s completely changed. The walls are painted a light shade of yellow and there’s a Moses basket in the corner, next to a changing station. The curtains are light, with airplanes and hot-air balloons floating on the enchanted fabric.
Harry contemplates asking Zabini or Parkinson if they know where on earth Draco is, but the Slytherins seem to dread talking to any of them, and then the Sorting Ceremony begins. Harry sits through it worrying about Draco, coming up with a million scenarios of where he could be, of what could have happened to him.
Harry’s blind and now he can’t even use his hands, completely at Draco’s mercy. And yet, he wouldn’t want it any other way. A shiver runs down his spine as he feels Draco’s smile against his skin.
“Ron’s right,” Hermione shouted from the kitchen. “You should go on a holiday. Take Draco with you.”
“We’ll talk to McGonagall, and she’ll convince them,” Harry says, determined to win and to take Draco out. “It’s a Muggle restaurant anyway.”
“Perfect,” Draco drawls, an excited glint in his eyes as his lips start kissing their way down Harry’s neck, sucking on his sensitive skin and making Harry’s eyes flutter closed. His fingers are still on Draco’s chest, but they tremble as the pleasure builds.
It’s all too easy, really, how they fall into each other’s beds. It probably shouldn’t be that easy, but Harry lets himself take what Draco is offering, whatever it is, and just enjoys it. For the first time in his life, he’s not in danger, he’s not starving, he’s not on the run. He has nothing to worry about.
“Why birds?” he asks, noticing how Draco is rolling up the left sleeve of his jumper, frowning at the mark on his arm. Harry realises that it’s faded, the colour less vibrant than it used to be after the war, although it’s still there. And it obviously still pains Draco.
Harry ends up on his knees in the empty changing rooms, sucking Draco off under the hot stream of the shower, long fingers tugging at his curls.
Harry lets out a whimper as he feels Draco’s lips on his neck, sucking on a sensitive spot that makes him lose control and shudder in his arms.
“Would it be weird if I asked you to spend the night here?” Harry asks, sheepishly. “Would you mum hex me?”
“Let’s stay then, my love,” Draco whispers, kissing the corner of his lips. He smells like the sea and the sun. Harry feels his heart bursting with something he’s never felt before.
“Explain,” she demands, and Harry just blurts it all out. Draco’s desire to have a child, his mother’s deteriorating health conditions, and the issue with the Manor. He doesn’t leave anything out, because it’s like a waterfall coming out of his mouth. He feels kind of relieved and lighter after he has told her everything.
“You had no right to intrude!” Harry shouts, his anger surging again, skin prickling with magic as the air around him crackles with sparks.
He shows Draco the books on Italy, the documentaries, little Harry feeling excited and in awe. Petunia finding the stolen book he had hidden and refusing to give him dinner, then breakfast. Draco whimpers, his fingers pressing against Harry’s wrist.
“I’m yours,” he whispers. Draco bites on his neck as he comes, a small sob escaping his lips, his hot breath brushing against Harry’s bruised skin.
,” he casts, feeling his heart surge at the familiar tingling in his hand rushing to the tip of his fingers, through his wand. A burst of light flies out of his wand, making Draco gasp as the Patronus starts taking shape in front of them.
“I need your help to find the perfect Christmas present for Hermione,” Ron pleads. “I haven’t got the foggiest idea what to get her. And she said her mum might give me permission to go visit them on Christmas day and spend the night, so I need to get her parents a Muggle present.”
He wishes he could firecall Andromeda to ask her for clarifications, but his Floo is blocked. He can’t even send a Patronus, so he feels even more powerless and useless.
He wonders if Draco has already gone to sleep, but Harry’s message disappears from the parchment straight away, and a new line appears.
They read together, then drink tea in Draco’s fancy teacups. They cook and eat at the kitchen table, then they clear the table and Draco works on his potion. They decorate the Christmas tree, and the house feels festive and bright. They have sex, but sometimes it feels like they’re making love. They sleep and wake up from nightmares, but it’s not so scary anymore, because Draco’s warm hand is there, holding Harry’s.
“I don’t want to be an Auror,” Harry says. He knows, now, that he will never be one. It’s not the path for him.
“So this has nothing to do with the fact that my son has suddenly sprouted wings, right?” she asks and Harry gapes at her.
Draco held his hand out, but Potter brushed his fingers away, staring at him with a serious expression as he applied the ointment to his eyebrows and then his nose, moving down to his broken lip. It tasted minty and slightly peppery. He couldn’t help but enjoy the feeling of Potter’s careful fingertips touching his skin, so gentle and soft. He hadn’t been touched in so long and he felt guilty for enjoying it so much.
“Pain au chocolat,” Malfoy corrects him, his pronunciation absolutely perfect. Harry can’t help but think that French suddenly sounds ridiculously hot, especially coming out of Malfoy’s pretty mouth.
Ron’s face turns beet red up to the tip of his ears, just as Draco plops down on the sofa next to Harry, asking, “What have I missed?”
“Well, you’re a Gryffindor,” he eventually says, shaking his head. “Trust you lot to be bloody steadfast and start doing things without asking for permission first.”
“Right,” Malfoy says, his eyes leaving Harry’s as he continues walking towards the school. Harry sees the front gates approaching and he quickly thinks of something to hold Malfoy for a minute longer.
“Sometimes,” Harry mumbles in the darkness, trying to catch his breath. “Sometimes I want to just exist for one day. Without worrying about what people expect from me. Without thinking of all the people I couldn’t save. Of the ones I’ve lost. I just want to breathe and forget about everything else. To just exist, with you by my side.”
“Ron, seriously,” Hermione mutters, offering him a glass of water. “Harry, we’re all really happy for you.”
The sorting ceremony had already started, the hat was shouting out the different houses the little first years were being assigned to. Draco sat down among his fellow Slytherins and tried to relax, tried not to think, to breathe. In through his nose, out through his mouth, his fingers tapping nervously against his thumb, one at a time. He cast a glance towards the Gryffindor table and found Potter staring back at him, an unreadable expression on his face, so he looked away.
“You know what they symbolise,” Draco replies, his eyes still fixed on the inside of his arm, fingers holding the quill with precision as he puts the finishing touches on the stunning work of art.
“My relatives didn’t keep many,” he replies, a half-lie that he doesn’t want to expand. Malfoy’s jaw clenches, his fingers grip the photo too tight and it folds. “Can I take this?”
“I’ve already cast all the protection and prep spells,” Draco says, his voice coming up muffled from the pillow.
“She was really beautiful,” he murmurs, noticing the way her smile makes her eyes shine. He wonders if Malfoy’s smile would be the same. Harry’s never seen him genuinely happy before.
“I’ve got my cloak,” Harry whispers, fetching it from behind him and putting it on. Draco’s eyes land on him without really seeing him, his fingers reaching for Harry’s thigh, stroking it through the thin fabric of the cloak. “Tonight?”
Harry nods and leaves. He spends the evening with Ron and his family, pretending to be happy while their tired faces smile at him, telling him to blow on his candles and make a wish.
Harry swallows under the Slytherin’s calculating gaze and he feels a shiver running down his spine as Zabini walks closer to him, lifting Harry’s chin with his index finger and staring into his green eyes.
Draco’s hand curls around Harry’s shaft, stroking him with lubed-up fingers to make him hard again. Harry moans, a shiver running down his spine as Draco starts kissing him slowly and pumping his cock. It comes back in waves, the pleasure like a ripple through his system, the feeling of Draco’s hands on him, his lips colliding with Harry’s. Harry gradually relaxes as Draco starts moving inside him, slowly pulling out and then pushing back in. It starts feeling nice, then good, then mind-blowing as Harry pants against Draco’s mouth, overwhelmed by the realisation that Draco is fucking him. That Draco’s cock is inside him, picking up a steady rhythm with his thrusts.
Harry looks at Draco’s pale hands, he notices how the skin is red and broken over the knuckles, tiny little cuts criss-crossing over the raised blue veins. He brings Draco’s left hand to his lips and kisses it tenderly.
“Are you waiting for a written invitation?” Malfoy asks, looking annoyed, and Harry stands up to sit on the floor opposite him. He stares at the cups and realises it’s a new set, probably part of Malfoy’s collection. The fine porcelain is covered in tiny flowers that bloom where Harry’s fingers touch it. Tulips and roses, yellow daffodils, lilies and red camellias, opening and flowering under Harry’s digits.
He remembers all the times he used to lie awake in his cupboard under the stairs, waiting for the morning to come. He puts his hand on his belly and he inhales deeply.
“How much did you do with Blaise?” Harry asked, his eyes fixed on him, making Draco wonder why he was so curious.
“Harry, you can work in the library with Malfoy,” Hopkins says. Harry can see the blond flinch from the corner of his eyes, but Malfoy still nods and then leads Harry to the library. They walk past vast rooms and dimly lit corridors, and Harry wonders how huge the Manor actually is and how Malfoy managed to grow up here without getting lost. It feels like the bottom of the ocean, so big and dark, giving Harry the creeps.
Hermione takes it from his fingers, then she grabs her wand and uses magic to highlight the words at the beginning of each line.
He can’t remember Draco’s timetable by heart, but he has a free hour to himself after Herbology, and he’s hoping to convince Draco to study with him.
“You wish, Potter,” he whispers. “A little room just for you and me so that you can fuck me as you please. Dream on.”
The day before they’re meant to leave, Harry finds Draco in the kitchen, quill in hand as he works on the tattoo on his arm. Harry prepares two cups of tea, adding plenty of sugar to his and only milk to Draco’s, before sitting next to him. He looks at the beautiful drawing, and his breath gets stuck in his throat as he notices a female zebra finch flying around Draco’s arm, then resting on the antlers next to the male finch. A nest has appeared, and the two birds cuddle up together, so close, their beaks rubbing against each other.
“Like that,” Draco whispers encouragingly. “Fuck, Harry, you have no idea how amazing you feel. Oh, gods…”
“Yes,” Harry murmurs, wanting to keep Draco safe and wishing he could leave the Manor at the same time.
