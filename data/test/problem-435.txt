The satisfaction quickly fades. His skin crawls, the dragon wants to show its dominance. Maybe he’ll fight those people outside Hogwarts’ gates. He
McGonagall leads them to the inconspicuous stone block standing next to the deep pit that is the cleared site of the castle and briefly describes what they’ll need to do, and makes them all practice the ritual once.
in Knockturn Alley after the war. Instead, Knockturn Alley has become more of a slum, a place with extremely cheap housing despite its central location in Wizarding London.
The idea of designing his “ideal Charms classroom” is not quite as appealing as designing his own bedroom filled with secret nooks and crannies, but Jamie will take this opportunity to fiddle around with a classroom design, and then
help, I’m here. I should have known, when you kept insisting to stay back with the other students during the nights of the full moon.”
Telly working, check, DVD in, check. Blankets, check. Popcorn, check. Harry plopped himself down on the sofa and yelled out, “Hurry up! I’m starting now!”
This week, I was sucked into reading a story that had the bad habit of ending chapters in the middle of a scene. Today, I became evil and did the same thing
Jamie’s eyes sparkle. “Mr Malfoy is going to show us his dragon transformation! It’s not fair that some of the Slytherins have seen it and others haven’t,” he adds ‘sneakily’.
how the wounds were transferred to you!” She sighs heavily. “It’s not necessarily a bad thing but that means you
Pansy nods in agreement. “If we go forward, rest assured that you won’t be any less safe than you are now.”
One of the students hastily hides their wand, but the others don’t care. Some of them dare to sneer at him.
Cracks spread from where the hourglass once stood, across the stone floor, up the wall that backs into the Great Hall. The floor shudders. Hermione shoves other students away as cracks snake across the floor to the far wall. Glass in the windows shatter, as the floor opens into a chasm to the corridor below.
Meanwhile, Bartholomew is glaring at Hitchly before saying loudly, “Mr. Malfoy, have you been to the Forbidden Forest?”
“Admit it, Draco. He’s the better version of you.” Harry opens his eyes, looking at Draco’s outline. He snickers. “His blueprint was brilliant. With him and McGonagall leading the way, the new Hogwarts is going to be really good. I wish you would let me hang out with Blaise and watch the Ministry’s attempt though…”
Harry looked down and saw how his own cock was swallowed up by Draco’s hand. Saw how his cock was little next to Draco’s. Felt the hot firmness against his own.
“Today, Draco Lucius Malfoy and Harry James Potter have chosen to complete a marriage bond,” Minerva says solemnly. “Together, they will share their joys and share their sorrows, and share their lives.”
McGonagall nods. “Well, as you may know, Hogwarts is now officially independent. Because of this, you can now officially step down from your post as Head of Slytherin.”
“Oh, look, Ron and Hermione are here! And Parvati and Padma have come! And...oh, Dennis is here too…”
will handle it.” Draco pulls out a new sheaf of parchment. “Now, I’m inclined to refer to you with your name, rather than your deadname.Advanced training...
Of course, some of these headlines are fake news, and some of it seems too fantastical to be true. Owls flood the Ministry asking for the truth. This means that on this Saturday morning, many Ministry workers and officials have been forced to come into work, gritting their teeth as they try to absolve the Ministry of any wrong-doing.
Harry sits down, an uncontrollable smile on his face. “It’s nice to have such a romantic Slytherin. I don’t have anything for you right now, but I’ll bake your favourite apple crumble later.”
One of the spindly-legged baby thestral trips in its hurry. It gets up on shaky legs, head hanging down. Draco quickly heads over. A quick inspection shows that the thestral isn’t injured. Draco pats it.
“Heh.” Malfoy steps over to Aster, both of them looking at Aster’s notes and chatting quietly. Malfoy has a serious expression, his voice low and comforting.
Now, at the conclusion of the fest, all the authors in the fest now have at least one work. This would make predicting their authorship in future anonymous fests easier.
in particular who had no fics on their AO3 page), and some authors were predicted multiple times (especially
From the outside, the tents look fairly plain. Harry is not surprised that the insides are completely different. Far from a cramped tent, the sloping ceilings are very high up, and the area is spacious. Many of the Slytherin sofas have been moved as well as many desks and bookshelves.
to have pictures of the new, partially built, ground and above-ground walls of Hogwarts. But instead, there is different news:
In an instant, Draco knows what happened. Harry was used as bait. The Aurors intended to ambush Greyback. But instead, their ambush was ambushed.
Draco accepts it with a smirk. “Do you prefer serving me at the Slytherin table instead of eating with your Gryffindor friends? Have I risen in your heart?” he jokes.
A few days later, Lucius Malfoy is no longer in the Manor Library, but instead sitting in his office, door locked from the inside and a dark scowl on his face.
Shacklebolt rubs his face wearily. “We should not be letting children do our work. But perhaps he can do it…”
This makes the Slytherins one of the first to move back into Hogwarts castle, after the house-elves with their newly completed kitchen and living space and after some of the paintings and Hogwarts ghosts.
Pansy fills Greyback in with the story they decided on: internal conflict with another group of dark wizards. The moment the story grips Greyback’s mind, Draco follows with a sleeping charm.
And while Harry splutters with indignation, Zabini breezes through and heads to the back garden. Harry dashes after him to save Neville, except Neville’s
As the Headmistress, Merlin knows that Minerva desperately wants to fix Hogwarts as soon as possible. But as Headmistress, she has duty to her students first and foremost. She can sense the rippling
Granger continues, “I know my mistake, that I remained ignorant of what started to happen to the Slytherins this year...but maybe now you’ll understand what it was like for people like me all the years previous.”
Both Draco and Aster look at Potter. Potter crosses his arms. “So what? Malfoy’s not the boss of me.”
Harry shrugs. “Sure.” He already knows they (read: Hermione) are going to grill him, but it’s definitely not going to be as incriminating as when Draco found about Harry’s stash of notes on him when they tried to fuck in the study.
Seeing Harry come undone, Draco grinds his cock hard into Harry’s body, before coming deep inside him.
“Unless you were leaning back on your chair,” Jones says darkly. “And O’Conor said we’ll be transfiguring stones next lesson? What if those stones un-transfigure? Hogwarts will break
He calls a house-elf to deliver him breakfast. It appears on his bedside table, along with a rolled up newspaper.
Noise breaks out as they leave the Great Hall and traverse through the hallways that have been constructed.
.” Hermione presses her lips together, her lips twisting downwards. “I’m sorry I forgot to trust you. That night when you were attacked...it wasn’t even that we had an argument. But you...you seem to be right. Zabini also said that Hogwarts is sentient. And since Slytherin separated, I don’t see Professor Garren doing
Draco leered up at him, and rubbed Harry’s thighs straddled on either side of him, going closer and closer... “Oh, but I am. Care to confirm yourself?”
Harry’s nose scrunches up. “That hurts,” he grumbles. His lips purse, a wet tongue darting out. “I…”
Knockturn Alley, yet Greyback is still at large. The full moon was two days ago. But no news of Aegis doing anything about Greyback’s pack.
Blaise returns a while later with the second and first years Jamie Ottley and Alyss Singh respectively. Blaise has braided Alyss’s hair again, weaving in green ribbon.
Draco walks out of the pavilion, much to Narcissa’s dismay, to greet the large black thestrals. There are new baby thestrals that Draco hasn’t met before, while the previous baby thestrals have grown big.
Harry rolls his eyes.  “Alright, Jamie, I’ll supervise. Why don’t you ask around if anyone else wants to come too? I’ll conjure up some balls to throw around…”
Draco thrusted shallowly. A little more, a little more while Harry was distracted. He physically shifted Harry into a better position so that he could go deeper.
And finally, late nights are reserved for the two of them. Snuggling up by the fire with light reading (or heavy reading, in Draco’s case). And sometimes they’ll sleep, and sometimes they’ll
As the Slytherin Building gets to the edge of the castle site, its movement slows down. Under McGonagall’s direction, some students and Flitwick start moving away the dirt and stone under it, so that it can slowly descend. Hogwarts’ magic tightens its hold, pulling Slytherin to the rest of the construction and slotting it into place.
Draco cannot hang around though; with dinner over, he and all the remaining Slytherins return back to the Commons. No Hufflepuffs delay them—there are sounds of revelry coming from the Hufflepuffs’ area.
While Harry heated up the grill and coated the lamb in tandoori paste and oil, he directed Malfoy to reheat up the rice, mix in the almonds and currants, wash the spinach, and shred and blanch the beans.
“...I am proud of everyone and their efforts to rebuild Hogwarts and the new wizarding society,” McGonagall says. “We all have learnt stereotypes and false truths, that are so ingrained that we may have a first negative reaction to others. However, that first reaction does not control you. Thoughtful consideration in conjunction with common civility will help build a more tolerant society…”
Darkness descends. Draco carefully picks out the different noises in the Hospital Wing. There are quiet footsteps coming closer. He casts a new large
They head back to the rose garden first, because during the flight, they both lost their roses and Draco wants to pick a new bouquet for Harry. Once Draco judges that Harry really
“You’ll love this, I promise,” Draco said. He gripped his own cock, and replaced his fingers with the spongy head. Slowly, he started to push in.
“I don’t see why not,” Flitwick says encouragingly. “Good job, boys. Keep up the good work, all three of you.”
If it weren’t for the muggles, there wouldn’t be anti-werewolf laws, if it weren’t for the muggles, there wouldn’t have been a Dark Lord in the first place!
Dennis Creevey sits in class, barely listening to the Professor up front. He wants to leave, he wants to find Harry and get him out of Slytherin. Harry’s a good guy! Dennis didn’t mean to hurt him, it wasn’t his fault...but McGonagall and Flitwick gave him detention anyway.
Draco emerged, no longer wearing his apron. Instead, he had a casual open-front robe, neat shirt and trousers. “Hello.”
“Haven’t you felt my body every time you snuggle up to me?” Draco asks in a light tone. “Haven’t you peeked on me in the Forest before?”
Outside, a Hufflepuff is standing guard. He sees Draco and Potter and his face goes a bit sour. “Malfoy. Harry Potter, you should wait outside…”
Unspeakable Nightshade looks over Harry’s head. “That building is still standing on Hogwarts ground. Under the Wizengamot Bill, Slytherin must go. Only then will the rebuilding go smoothly.”
Harry reflexively rubs his arms. He remembers how the magic had tingled under his skin, deep into his bones.
Draco’s eyes sharpen. “Is that so. The issuing of duelling challenges is a time-honoured tradition of the wizarding world. Any one who accepts is consenting.”
that they hadn’t advertised it. It’s true that a lot of those muggleborns had either eventually left, or turned even sharper and meaner, much like the late Severus Snape.
Malfoy’s footsteps stop a few feet away from Harry. A moment later, a warming charm blossoms, warding off the cold chill from the window.
There are multiple reasons why the machine learning models were imperfect. Aside from authors changing writing styles, and perhaps the existence of better machine learning algorithms, the input data and features are the two main problems
There are no longer any moving staircases and the staircases themselves are widened. Multiple lifts have been added, both in the main castle and in each of the towers alongside their staircases. Smooth ramps added to the Castle’s main entrance complete the step-free accessibility of Hogwarts.
“Because then you would have been branded a werewolf too, I know.” Alice deflates. “Sorry. I should be angry at Mary and not you. People here are good.” She takes her friend into the hubbub to where some of the other third years are, one of them being Sequoia Hawks.
One of the Ministry officials constructs a makeshift podium against the backdrop of the castle ruins. The Wizengamot Member Holly Griffiths steps up. She is dressed completely in the muggle style in a blazer and trousers, no robes. She smiles graciously at Lee Jordan who is holding up a camera.
“Don’t mind Nolan,” Malfoy says dismissively as he leviates the tray between them. “These are some of the necessary items for Slytherins. This badge has an inbuilt shield charm that automatically activates. It will also communicate directly with Blaise, who is your assigned Eighth Year.”
As Draco’s hands trailed down to Harry’s cock, Harry gave a little whimper. Draco’s attention sharpened.
Harry wants to ask more, but he makes the executive decision to cut his losses for now. “Have a good day, Malfoy. And thanks for the lunch.”
Back in the Commons, the food offering is done, and now students are eating it. The sombre atmosphere has been replaced with something more forward looking, and some have even started small games.
“Come in—Ms Parkinson. I was not expecting you. Is there anything I can do to help you—” McGonagall’s voice stops when Draco appears behind Pansy.
Pansy smiles. “Don’t be so nervous! It’s not like you’re getting married yet. I won’t surprise you with a marriage official.”
,” Harry moaned. “Yes, Daddy.” Little grunts of pleasure dropped from his mouth, his half-lidded eyes focused entirely on Draco. He was at Draco’s mercy, and he knew it.
A dark-blue robed Unspeakable on the team steps up to the podium. His hood makes it hard to see his face. “Greetings. The new floor plan for Hogwarts has been drawn up. In order to retain Hogwarts’ tradition, we will be repurposing all stones and materials from Hogwarts in the rebuilding. We understand that the staff of Hogwarts must continue their classes with the students of Hogwarts. Therefore, we have produced a plan that would require your aid primarily on the evenings and weekends…”
Once the portrait door closes behind them, Hermione says, “Didn’t you say you need to be careful in the corridors? This late at night, we’ll come with you.”
“Good doing business with you,” Pansy says briskly. “Oh, it looks like Jamie is drawing more dragon cards…”
“That’s what makes me worry more,” Pomfrey mutters. “But if you want to keep your secrets for now...how can I ever pry them out?” With a snort, Pomfrey leaves.
Draco looks at the bickering Potter and Nolan in fond amusement. Eventually, Nolan grabs onto Draco’s cloak on one side, while Potter walks on Draco’s other side.
Determination flashed in Harry’s eyes. He straddled Charlie’s legs and took over the job of stroking Charlie back to full hardness.
The ‘room’ they end up in is more like a cavern than a human-made room. The earthy-rocky walls rise up, the ceilings only dimly lit by all the
Aster slips into the bench space in front of Draco. “Don’t worry so much, Draco,” they say. “It’s not explosive.”
After the meeting finishes, Blaise tells Harry that he can give everyone a tour of Slytherin House as “Good inspiration for how a House Commons can be like.”
Draco feels a moment of helplessness as his cock spurts one more time. With Harry’s legs locked around him, he remains in Harry’s body. Instead of falling on top of him, Draco flips their position, so that Harry lies on top of him, still connected.
It’s not just the students of Slytherin here, either. Draco makes sure to magically burn some food for the ghosts that have come; some of the fifth year Slytherins have organised food for the mer people in the Great Lake; and Blaise and Jamie have charmed some of the more confident (or easily convinced) house-elves to join their dinner.
They have barely walked a couple of meters when a large group of big Hufflepuffs appear before them.
McGonagall suppresses her anger and invites the Unspeakable to her office, where the Sorting Hat stays.
,” Garren says coldly. “Don’t think I’ll treat you lightly just because I’m your Head of House. Detention!”
He was feeling particularly upbeat, since Draco had given him another surprise visit. Well, it was hard to say whether it was a ‘surprise’ anymore since Draco had been over during the late evening or the early morning more and more often. Neither of them said anything, but it felt a lot like Draco was slowly moving into his house.
Another thestral comes over to eat Draco’s steak, and then a smart thestral figures out how to remove the silver cloches from the other dishes…
Draco grimaces. His boyfriend is angry. He needs to coax him! Quick, what’s something he hasn’t told Harry yet?
“She’s amazing,” Harry said easily. “She was the one who suggested I tidy up my stories and send them to a publishing house.”
He should have stayed in Gryffindor! Harry glances across the Slytherin Commons to where the second years are studying diligently. They’re not going to help him escape from Malfoy at all!
follow all of those procedures, do you? Do you really use Astronomy and Arithmancy to predict compatibility?”
back at him as he walks past them to the front table along with Jamie and Michelle—Jamie also has a ridiculous pointy green hat.
Garren’s expression drops when he enters his private tent. So, he has fallen ‘out of favour’. At least McGonagall didn’t go as far as to fire him, though he half wished she did so that he could file a lawsuit.
It uncomfortably reminds Draco of his own reaction to the word “muggle” and any vague mention of muggleborns. Cheaters who have to be either assimilated, or excluded from their world.
Harry jumps out of bed. “I’m going too!” He hurries to his trunk and pulls out the first thing, which are his school robes.
” Robards repeats in disbelief. He rubs his head. His hair has been going grey-white at an alarming rate recently.
Malfoy smirks, and slowly wanks it. It shouldn’t be possible, but it’s growing larger in his hand, the head of it peeking out whenever he tugs the foreskin down. It’s slick, shiny with precome and lube, and Harry’s hands twitch. He wants to touch—he whines, stares into Malfoy’s eyes, tries to make Malfoy understand that he wants it.
Draco turned to look with the rest of them: Harry was standing near the window, and he was framed so
has the power to let them help. If these students can bond with each other building a miniature Hogwarts, then having everyone working together will build even more interhouse camaraderie.
Despite Blaise’s directives, some of the Slytherins don’t want to return to bed, and so all the others don’t want to leave first either.
“I...I don’t want to,” third year Nolan Larch mumbles, glancing at the dark Forbidden Forest. “Why do we have to
Draco, of course, does not touch the other Houses. Instead, he focuses back on Slytherin, and in particular the new ground floor level.
A week before Christmas, Harry looked at the items left on his list to buy: namely, wizarding things. He had been putting it off since he didn’t want to go to any wizarding places.
In the weeks after the spring break, the final little touches are added to Hogwarts. On May 2nd, a small memorial remembering the first anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts is held, including the reveal of a small, new monument to commemorate all those who had died defending Hogwarts.
In the short time that Harry saw him, Harry could already tell that Malfoy’s temperament had settled down. Were all those childhood expressions a thing of the past, or were there ways for Harry to see them on grown-up-Malfoy?
Noise and chatter rise like water released from a dam. “Let’s go to Mr Malfoy,” Nolan says, side-eyeing Potter.
“It’s not your fault,” Blaise murmurs. He leans to the side, magic flickering briefly between his hand and the wall.
But if anything, Flitwick grows even more suspicious. “Dizziness...have you eaten something that was not prepared by a Hogwarts house-elf? Were there poisonous fumes that could have risen from a brewing potion?”
Harry looks between the two of them. “What’s this about sharing me?” he says. “What if I want to sleep with Blaise?”
going to allow Garren to mark him down. After he finishes that, Draco takes out his Charms assignment next. At the loud scraping sound of the chair against the floor, Draco looks up.
“Look, he’s just a cock slut. So what if he’s your younger adoptive brother? He wants it, don’t you Harry? You want to, don’t you, Charlie?”
wrote to him regarding anything good? He takes the letter. However, rather than flying away as is typical of its personality, the owl remains, preening its ruffled feathers.
spell and downs the coffee that Flitwick gave her only a few minutes ago, while noise and chatter in the Great Hall rise up once more.
While Madam Pomfrey and Headmistress McGonagall continue to the castle, Draco and Harry stop by Jamie’s picnic blanket. Unsurprisingly, Charlie Weasley follows Draco.
“And I’m Kim, Maira’s best friend! If she’s going to Slytherin, then I’m going too!” the second girl says, grabbing Maira’s hand.
Blaise nudges Draco in a friendly manner. “Draco is deluding himself. Harry, you’re going to have a good time in Slytherin with us.”
In the evening after dinner, Harry’s House-unity team gather together for Blaise’s report in the Slytherin Building. It’s the first time any non-Slytherin on the team has entered.
The air is heavy and tensions high. There is the MInistry team, and the stiff-faced Wizengamot Member Holly Griffiths; there is the panel of expert magical theorists who, with Headmistress McGonagall, will be judging their work; there is the Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt and his entourage; there are some select members of the press to document the process; and there are the four Head of Houses—
The transformation was triggered by aggression. He hadn’t the energy to be angry during the War, but after the War, confined in Malfoy Manor with his father? Anger aplenty. It happened twice again.
The sound of footsteps draws McGonagall’s eyes to the Hall entrance. Her eyes narrow upon seeing Draco Malfoy in non-regulation robes. The Slytherins file in two ranks around the Slytherin table, but none of them sit down.
to come back to Hogwarts—it’s part of his parole terms. When Draco had been escorted to Platform 9 ¾ by his parole Auror, he hadn’t expected any of his friends.
on herself. “Students, staff, let me tell you exactly what happened, so cease your wild speculations.”
, the tiny functional part of Harry’s brain though, before Draco massaged his hip and drew yet another moan out of him.
The Gryffindors all flinch. Draco sneers, boldly pushing aside the humans blocking his way. Oh, they’re such
He and the other second year Slytherins agree: with the three eighth years around, and especially Mr. Zabini, Hogwarts isn’t so bad.
As Draco snaps out another shield, he knows that it’s only a matter when one of Garren’s spells lands on a bystander.
Andromeda gives him a disgruntled look. “Nosing into a witch’s affairs,” she says. “But yes. We’ve been exchanging letters.”
Harry’s about to sit anyway when the smallest werewolf glares at Harry in a very familiar way. “...Nolan?”
“Oh, fuck Ben,” River replies mildly. “The day he stops being an arsehole me is the day I stop assigning him negative respect.”
“And yet, you still go back,” Ron mutters. He groans, and runs a hand through his hair. “It’s worse than I thought. Bloody hell.” He pulls out a pamphlet. “Hermione told me to give you this.”
“Here is your post,” McGonagall gives him the unopened letters that have been deemed safe. “Have a good evening. Soon, the reconstruction of Gryffindor will begin. I hope you will join one of the teams to help.”
instead. He glanced up as Draco came round. The sweater had been big on Harry, so it fitted Draco well enough.
“If it were so, the rest of the NEWTs potions class should be in the Hospital Wing too,” Draco replies.
“He was hit!” Aster counters. “There are some healing potions left in the office, you stay there and don’t move!”
Above, the clouds are dark, the moonlight a dim glow, the Forest a deep green. Draco’s scales shine faintly, and not long after, some dark creatures fly over.
Once they start eating, Harry forgets that they’re on a date. Draco tells him how he made the space around them, and how the music playing is a recording made by the Slytherins (and
The voice is familiar to Nolan! He hesitantly raises his head, sniffing the air. Hint of sharp magic and coffee and apple cinnamon. It’s Mr. Draco Malfoy, right?
He leaves through the door facing the corridor. The younger students are still being lazy on this Sunday morning, while Harry is currently spending time with Weasley and Granger and the dragonologist Weasley. None of them will know if he quietly heads out to McGonagall’s temporary office.
As the evening deepens, some students gather into groups to either chat or do work. Blaise is conversing with first and second years in the Slytherin Head Boy room, a conversation that he has forbidden Draco from joining in with.
Like Blaise, Draco requests permission, and then casts a warming charm on Filch. He tries to hand Mrs Norris over, but she refuses, pulling at Draco’s (expensive!) robes.
“...I like that you do whatever you want to do. I like your arse when you’re playing Seeker and I’m flying behind you trying to catch up…”
Pansy smirks, and turns to the short Ravenclaw. “And you’re not going to tell me either? Then I suppose I should tell your friend about your secret
The thestrals may be kindly and gentle in nature, but the thestral leader has a sharpness to her that Draco suspects means that she’ll kill if pushed to it.
Flitwick catches him at the end of the day. Draco is out on the Slytherin floor with Felicity, upgrading all their surveillance charms and scaring away students who want to linger.
Draco smirks. “Thought so.” With that, he steps over the limbs of the Gryffindor and carries Harry back down to Slytherin, leaving Pansy to do the cleanup; along the way back, they pass by Blaise and Felicity who Pansy has called via badge to help.
“Now, about the Levy case, I have the prepared reports here,” Dr Granger smoothly took out the folder and handed them to Solicitor Malfoy.
Harry concedes. Ron and Hermione accompany him down to Slytherin; he only says the password once they’re out of earshot.
After class, Harry tells Malfoy that he’s following Hermione. They see each other again at dinner. The majority of the students are now talking about visiting Hogesmead and the upcoming Hufflepuff vs. Ravenclaw match.
Ellis makes a face but takes a cookie. “No fair.” He nibbles on the cookie. “Can you conjure up a glass for me?”
did nothing. You personally biased yourselves against the other Houses! I bet you didn’t teach the Slytherins anything about house-unity!”
Deducing from their direction, the two of them have come from Hogesmead. Draco’s mildly surprised that Granger even agreed to go on a date in the middle of everything.
Draco leans against Harry’s shoulder to read the second page. “It’s because they love scandals more than serious news, and you more than me,” Draco says.
“But with steps like these, Professor Flitwick can easily stand in front of the class,” Jamie says. “Your classroom is boring. I would fall asleep in that kind of classroom.”
But Hermione has to admit that Slytherin is currently the safest place for him, now that they’ve drawn up their walls.
Garren’s smile tightens. “Professor McGonagall has given you permission to remain in the Gryffindor dormitories with your friends.”
All of sudden, the wispy silvery mist becomes the silvery mist of dragon smoke, and a huge silver dragon emerges from the tip of Draco’s wand, far bigger than the room.
Harry glowed with satisfaction. “He can make desserts! It’s perfect, I make dinner, he makes desserts.
Draco mutters, “Pans, why are you being so maudlin for. It doesn’t suit you.” He cringes when Pansy’s grip
After Hagrid promises he’ll let the thestrals watch in a roughly fenced area separate from the human guests, Draco submits to Narcissa’s final touches on his robes.
Outside Hogwarts Castle, McGonagall’s anger overtakes her sleepiness. There are tied-up Aegis members at her feet, a few of whom even dare to look at her in a mixture of contempt and pity. Madam Pomfrey is treating their injuries. The most heavily injured wizard is the one that the dragon personally dropped in front of them.
Draco pauses from his selection of the morning’s pastries, smirk fading to an unimpressed look. “Received enlightenment, did you?”
Not long after, two fathers-to-be accompany their child-to-be to the playgrounds while a Mr Larch slinks out of Hogwarts.
Draco’s eyes narrow. He rubs Harry’s head, hard. “Practice more, you’ll get used to it. Or you can simply use up your magic, or leave it floating around.”
. Don’t you see, Harry? He’s still treating them like slaves! You said Malfoy took over the leadership of the Slytherins. Then it’s
Draco quirks his lips and nods. Everyone immediately brightens up, putting away their books and splitting up into their friendship groups. Blaise gives Harry a look, and the two of them go off to their Secret Thing.
“I remember you harping on about my bedtime when I first came to Slytherin,” Harry says, plopping unceremoniously on the chair opposite Draco’s.
McGonagall smiles wryly at both Jamie Ottley’s enthusiasm and his confidence that he will be able to take part in the rebuilding.
The other students had curled up by themselves on that other quilt and covered with spare blankets. Somehow, during the night, their quilt-bedding has moved
“Hogwarts and its student and staff body is fundamentally broken, Harry. It’s been getting worse and worse.”
“You read picture books in French? And—you can touch, it’s okay. If you draw on that blank canvas next to them, you can even give them something.”
Slytherin ultimately wins, but then Jamie Ottley has the idea to lead a chant of “Good game Slytherin! Good game Ravenclaw!”, which then gets shortened to “G G Rins! G G Claws!”
Pain blossoms on Draco’s shoulder. Through the rip, a barely perceptible sheen of scales spread across his skin.
“...Okay, fine,” Harry says, smiling exasperatedly. “It would have prevented a lot of Slytherin-Gryffindor fights.”
By the time dinner ends, Harry is a bit reluctant to leave Malfoy and the others. He wants to suggest that Hermione and Ron come with him to the Slytherin Dungeons, but from Malfoy’s warning before, combined with Hermione and Ron’s continued apprehensiveness, it won’t be possible.
Harry sucks in a sharp breath. “No! It is! Seriously Malfoy, you don’t know everything.” Harry hugs it to his chest, dust and chess-piece grumbles inside be damned.
Draco takes a seat, forcing Pansy against the back of the sofa. These papers and magazines aren’t the
Draco wakes up early in the morning, weak light filtering through the Forest canopy. Potter is snoring lightly beside him, his curly black hair poking out from the blankets and resting near Draco’s shoulder.
A thumb caressed Harry’s lips. Draco’s fingers kept Harry in place as he leaned in, head tilted. Their noses brushed against each other, and then soft yet firm lips pressed together.
Harry tilted his head up and put on his glasses. The corner of his mouth curled up. How often did he get to see Draco’s sleeping face? He must be tired if he hadn’t woken before Harry.
Bartholomew yanks his arm back, expression darkening. “With all due respect, this matter is highly important for British security. We will briefly escort Mr. Malfoy to one of our interrogation offices—”
Draco curses. He glances back across the bedroom—Pansy, Blaise, and Harry are still sleeping. In the rooms beyond, the other Slytherins are sleeping. Their bonds tug his chest. He shouldn’t leave them.
“Didn’t you bring your own friends? I was lonely,” Draco drawls, as his wand slashes. Greyback lunges at him and Draco throws a fireball right in his face.
Draco Malfoy looks up at the beautiful ceiling of the Great Hall. “I’m sorry, Hogwarts, but we are already standing apart from the other houses under your wing.”
Draco serves himself sausages and eggs instead of his usual morning pastry. He can hear the susurration of whispers about the
Draco’s heart feels a little sour and sweet. He tugs the quilt from under Potter and tucks him in properly. Yawning himself, Draco slides in between Pansy and Blaise and closes his eyes.
“Oh, you’re right.” Draco glances at Pansy, and drops his arm. The flames disappear, and Draco makes a mocking bow. “Go right ahead. Explore. Be free.”
And they talked a bit. And then some more. Harry’s foot brushed against his under the dining table. And after dinner, and Draco didn’t know
He sees that everyone else is now back in human form and dressed, and they have all clearly seen him lying close to Draco…
. From the list of authors and artists given, the known artists were removed (they can be determined by looking at their AO3 pages, with the word “[ART]” in titles, and/or zero wordcounts).
It’s clearly magic! Yesssss.” He glanced at Harry as his hand reached out for some popcorn. “...Potter, the telly is
Draco’s mood drops and drops. Finally, he makes a snap decision and walks swiftly to the tents where the Gryffindors are staying.
Harry whines when he pulls out, but needs must. He lifts Harry up and takes them to the bathroom to clean up. After that, they return to the bedroom and Draco applies a healing balm to Harry and wraps them both up inside the quilt.
Draco feels cold then hot. Shopkeepers and residents are tied up in the background, as Aurors flock in the picture’s foreground. Old buildings have been smashed in the mayhem, a mess of brick and magical items and ingredients littered on the ground.
to the Ministry who hasn’t released the “truth” that GReyback was taken down by Dark Wizards...even when the information comes out, people will still have Aegis in their minds. Look at how some of the muggleborns sit with lofty looks on their faces.
Potter shakes his head. “If...if they’re listening then they’re listening. If they’re not…” His eyelids are heavy now, empty mug abandoned.
. Draco gives her an unimpressed look, and smirks. “I suppose you gifted this on assumption that you’ll borrow it from me. A particular muggleborn witch catch your eye?”
Draco rounds the students to have a short 30 minutes of duelling practice, as he has been doing for the last few days. In this way, he is
Draco looks expectantly at the Hufflepuff arbiter, until they reluctantly say, “And the duel goes to Malfoy.”
McGonagall’s somewhat warm expression after Draco’s agreement soon fades away to an annoyed exasperation after she hears what they have done.
It’s hard to believe that his First-Year-self had been so afraid of the creatures in the Forest, when the true monsters were humans.
“But we’re not all human,” Draco says coldly. “I never knew you disliked Professor Flitwick and Hagrid that much.”
No. Not entirely unfamiliar. He has smelt these scents before. With a violent magical slash, he breaks the destructive spells connecting themselves to Hogwarts’ and Slytherin’s magic.
“Hmm, you keep thinking that, darling.” The corner of Pansy’s lips curls up into a smirk, which Draco resolutely ignores.
,” Malfoy orders. He puts his own baguette to the side while he flicks through a dozen papers. Harry stares as he eats—until Malfoy huffs and clears all the papers closest to Harry.
’s direction. Yet, Draco kept asking him, “More, Harry? Are you okay, Harry?” Draco kept saying, “You feel so good, Harry. So good. I want you forever.”
Potter’s is dumping his things on a new laboratory bench. WIth exasperation, Draco levitates all the rest of Potter’s things over and arranges them neatly on the bench.
In the evening after class, Jamie happily shows off to Mr Malfoy all the things that he’s learnt, and then runs off to chat with the house-elves about how
Malfoy’s fingers press just right, and Harry gasps again. He shifts his hips, trying to help, trying to get
Harry smiles smugly. “You see, I’m currently renovating. You know how I work on gardens part time, so I thought it’s time to try interior design. And what better place to start than my own home?”
, the Ministry team grows grimmer and grimmer. To Unspeakable Nightshade’s dislike, the Wizengamot Member Holly Griffiths calls in more magical theorists who are not affiliated with the Ministry.
Harry glances at Draco, and Draco shoos him. If Blaise wants to let Harry in on whatever secret project he’s doing, then Draco can't stop him. Instead, Draco goes back to Pansy’s side.
Draco inserted his fingers again, just to stimulate Harry’s prostate again. While Harry’s arousal was spiking up again, Draco took out his fingers and pressed just the tip in. Heat enveloped the tip of Draco’s cock as Harry’s hot walls pressed down on him.
Alone in the dorm room, Draco places down another marker after speaking to a younger student. It’s now Saturday: the end of the week seems to be Aegis’s preferred nights, likely due to the day jobs of the people behind Aegis. Greyback has no such scruples as days of the week.
could be considered the master bedroom,” Harry says as he flops down, back first, onto the bed after finishing his nightly routine.
And as promised, Draco made Harry savoury crepes and sweet crepes, and they talked about toppings and the weather and Harry’s plans for the day. And then Harry left.
Nolan cranes his neck, watching with narrowed eyes as the assortment of theorists, some dressed casually and others austerely, start to cast various spells.
“It is either you or them,“ Hitchly says lightly. “How can a boy like you do such great damage to Hogwarts? Your parents must have taught you.”
Malfoy looks at him. “What does it matter? I’ve clearly misinterpreted the situation.” He snorts. “Unless my humiliation isn’t enough for you.”
taken in for questioning as well,” Hitchly adds, looking at McGonagall in contempt. “You’re not above the law, Headmistress. Stand aside. Aurors, take Draco Malfoy.”
One of the theorists who had inspected Hogwarts previously has taken up the role of teaching magical history and culture. He’s also taking the opportunity to further study Hogwarts for academic magical-theory reasons.
Harry realised he was looking at Malfoy’s...ahem, belt. He flushed and looked up. “Nothing. Let’s go.” He stepped out and locked the door behind him.
Harry internally groans. “Ah, um, I wanted to make you something for Valentine’s Day, so I baked this chocolate apple cake…”
Harry pulled his hood back over his head, keeping one hand on it, and hurried away. This time, no one noticed him, and he was able to safely reach an Apparation Point and leave.
changed. I can’t believe you’ve been asking the house-elves for all your meals! Don’t they have enough work already? Do you even pay them?”
“That’s right, go and have some breakfast,” McGonagall says. She ushers Draco and others back to Hogwarts, while she and Robards remain in Malfoy Manor to talk.
Harry tilted his head up and smiled innocently. “What? Your cock is so cute. I could even give it a little pinch—”
Harry shakes his head, his lips turning down. “I’m sorry, Draco. It was confidential. There are some things I need to do.”
The way Professor McGonagall can know about the going on in Hogwarts is through her connection with Hogwarts. As such, Draco and Blaise ask Hogwarts to pretend that all the eighth years are nice and quiet in their dorm rooms.
“Oh, fuck you, Potter,” Malfoy says as he takes the bouquet. “You don’t even know what these flowers
Blaise keeps an attentive countenance as the words spill from the three third years. After making sure that they can complete the spells satisfactorily, he brings them to Slytherin to start on their new lounge-conservatory.
By the time they’re done, the Slytherin cohort, plus visitors, have made it to them. Their eyes are wide as they look at the standalone building.
“And we will sort out schooling issues,” Felicity adds. “It is a straightforward process to apply for the International Tests.”
: Violent dragon 😱😱😱😱 Must suppress immediately and protect the kids! *holds quill and parchment at the ready* Tell us what
Greyback lunges, swiping. Draco curses, using instinctive fire to propel himself back from those claws.
“Anyhow, see ya!” he says, pushing Ron and Hermione to the floo, before he himself floos to the Leaky Cauldron.
McGonagall smiles kindly at them. After a few more words with Harry, McGonagall leaves, heading to the main dining tent where most of the professors and other students are about to have dinner. She feels quite optimistic about the future.
In fact, Harry’s not casting. Instead, he’s holding Malfoy’s hand, while Malfoy raises stone and adds it into the new construction.
enough to be part of the inner circle and marked as a “Death Eater”. His father had spoken out of turn...and Nolan, who had been in his
The next morning, Harry was gone again, and it felt like a dream: Harry had not even stayed long enough for his scent to linger.
The yule log has been burning for the last two nights. It will burn out when this night is done, just in time to switch from Yule to Christmas Eve and Christmas Day festivities.
Gone now are the burnt out yule log ashes. Intertwined with the yule decorations are the Christmas ones: a large wreath hangs by the entrance, and smaller wreaths above the various hearths around the Commons. Fresh green foliage curls around the room and adorns the banisters along the mezzanine floor.
Harry gives a sigh of relief. “Okay.” He lets Draco manoeuver him into a different position and returns to snogging the rest of the afternoon away.
“What the—!” Nolan is thrown back, slamming against the wall by Garren’s spell. Harley is also thrown back.
Granger grips the paper, her eyes scanning quickly. “This…It’s a solution but...Hogwarts has always had four houses….But Salazar Slytherin
For the rest of that night, Harry is hyper-aware of Draco. He still stands by his actions. The only thing he is annoyed about is trusting that
“Come on, dear boy,” Blaise says, a hint of teasing on his tone. “I heard you were consorting with Potter again.
But he didn’t want the night to end yet. He had, um, barely scratched the surface of what Malfoy was doing these days.
“For what?” Harry absently touched the scarf too, brushing over Malfoy’s fingers. Malfoy’s hand withdrew. Harry could feel a warming charm embedded in the scarf that extended a handspan or so around the actual scarf. It meant that it also kept his ears warm.
didn’t pick it,” he said, shifting his legs. He inclined his head at the blanket covering Harry’s lap. “I’m sure you’re aware we’re both men, I won’t judge you for your….
Memory of the Slytherins’ nightly routine flashes in Harry’s mind. “There are two beds in the Eighth Year dorm.”
Mr Zabini would probably benevolently give the others a chocolate biscuit too, because he’s rich and doesn’t care so much for such things.
“Good work everyone,” he tells them as they walk wearily back to Slytherin. “Have a lie in tomorrow.”
Harry makes a face as he finds a good place to snuggle against Draco’s warmth. “So...the moral is that I should call you ‘mum’ more often.”
to homework. You won’t be helpful,” Malfoy says ruthlessly. “Furthermore, Granger has been glaring at me. I’m sure she’s
Draco lifts Harry up and drops him squarely down onto the bed. Harry’s limbs are akimbo, his hair a black mess of curls on the warm silver pillows. He brackets his arms on either side of Harry’s head, looking down at him with a dominating aura.
“A few more stabilising supports,” Malfoy says evenly. “But if you’re hungry, Harry, we can ask one of the house-elves to bring you something.”
Jamie’s smile turns sheepish. “O’Conor had us make tables, but then Daisy Kerr started making these spinning toys and so we ended up making mini buildings. But O’Conor gave us full marks anyway, since what we made was more complicated than tables!”
Charlie’s slow movements weren’t enough to bring out the wanton Harry he had seen when Draco was fucking him.
Nolan slumps back on his seat with a sigh of relief. Someone starts clapping, leading the wave of applause.
“If that is the case...we’ll simply confiscate the Manor.” Hitchly’s gaze turns to Lucius. “Don’t you know that leaving the Manor will lead to your immediate relocation to Azkaban? Of course, you may soon be moved to Azkaban nonetheless. After all, you are Draco Malfoy’s father.”
McGonagall grits her teeth. Through her connection with Hogwarts, she can feel what he is doing. He’s
Seeing Parvati reminds Harry of Lavender Brown, who has not returned to Hogwarts. Lavender Brown, who is now a werewolf.
With a growl, Draco’s hips slammed against Harry’s arse. His cock slid in with one smooth motion. “Good boy!”
Draco can only hope that his mother is successful in suppressing his father, because Lucius’s dueling touch has declined. But Malfoy Manor is not impenetrable.
try the two-way mirror charms, but I can only link two together. This one is linked to mine, and it only transfers sound.”
Harry and Ron both exchange grins. There are some things Hermione cannot understand, and cooking is one of them.
“Alright, everyone, don’t make Harry more nervous!” Molly admonishes. “Harry, you look lovely, and Draco will think so too.”
It’s with a regretful sigh that Draco heads out with Pansy, and a group of lower years, to the Great Hall for breakfast to maintain appearance.
“Take a seat, Harry, and welcome to Slytherin,” Draco says with a cool nod. “Your friends may also take a seat.”
Harry feels a sense of nostalgia as he follows them back to the Gryffindor Tower. Hermione says the password and they enter.
.” He plops himself next to Draco, and his eyes brighten. “Oh, it’s really warm like this.” He pulls the picnic basket over. “Hot chocolate?”
Every single course is well thought out, there is nothing too crumbly and nothing too liquidy. Everything is easy to eat, and easy to talk over. The main courses soon finish, and the table clears.
Draco rolls his eyes. Truthfully, he’s noticed that Harry has been having trouble falling asleep next to him, lying stiff instead of relaxing. He turns as Nolan and Harley approach their table.
He struggles to break the ropes, but by then, late-night Aurors on duty have run out. Shock freezes them, but a few react, throwing multiple red stunners.
“Your father only wanted one child. Succession issues, in the old days,” Narcissa said tightly. “Draco, you can’t imagine the
The room is larger under the magic of wizarding space. Draco’s eyes glance over to Harry, sprawled out so carefreely on the bed.
Nolan Larch, and his friend Harley Gerble, have detention for fighting with some muggleborns. The epitome of hot-headed teenagers who give Draco a headache.
. In this matter, Narcissa Malfoy is perfectly innocent. Whether a coincidence or not, it means that while the letters imploring the DMLE to catch Draco Malfoy have lessened, the number of letters asking after Aegis swell exponentially.
Someone sighs, and says in a drawling voice: “Quite informative to know what your true thoughts are.”
The point stood, in Draco’s opinion. They had never become friends with each other’s friends. Draco hadn’t wanted to—he had enough friends already. All of them partnered, just as Harry’s friends were.
“Interesting atmosphere for a date,” Harry says as he jumps off the broom and goes to pat a thestral.
There are more raucous scenes of fireworks and parties across the country. As the fireworks fade away, the almost full moon becomes the brightest light source in the night sky. Partiers’ exuberance about the new year dissipates as the late night sets in. As the reveries finish, however, not everyone returns to bed.
The meeting with Felicity is short—her mother is a judge, and she is fully committed to going down the same path.
” He tries to step back, but instead, he’s pulled forward. It’s hard to breathe. His skin feels like a thousand cuts have laid waste to it. His magic peels like extracting knives.
“Don’t give me that look,” Filch says without looking at Draco. “This painting needs proper repair, and I ain’t doing it in the middle of the corridor.”
Draco finally pulled off his trousers and pants. He coated his cock generously in lube. Harry stared down at Draco’s cock and the space between his legs.
Granger is dismayed. “Is that why you’ve been avoiding us lately? You shouldn’t have agreed to be his second in the first place!”
It’s not as warm and cozy...but it’s not as though Harry can change his mind now, and he feels guilty at the thought of taking Pansy’s place next to Draco.
“...Fine,” Potter grumbles. His body appears, silvery material pooling in hands under the dim light. “But like, what the fuck. How did you know?” There’s a pout in Potter’s tone.
. He doesn’t pull back though, as his voice goes husky. “I’ll tell Charlie to be less...um, like that.”
clumsy every time I see you,” he says. He snorts when the thestral noses Draco’s hair. “There is no hurry, walk carefully.”
a bad idea,” he says seriously. He moves on to trace the Sectumsempra scars. “And this was a bad idea.” Finally, he moves onto Malfoy’s lips. “But kissing you is the best idea I’ve ever had.”
He gets down from the stage, only to be ambushed by Granger and Weasley. Both of them tug him hard, saying something that Draco can’t hear over the noise.
Draco considers them, face calm. Blaise is giving him a pointed look, and so Draco bites back his initial sarcastic reaction—
“There are no cushioning charms on the Gringotts carts,” Malfoy says pointedly. “To build character, apparently.”
So, Draco let out a low sigh, and shook his head in exasperation. He pulled Harry close, rested hand on his waist. “If I had known wanted to dance, I would have given you intensive lessons.”
Potter is subdued in the morning, his greeting a little forced. He stands quietly as Blaise adjusts his robes, changing the Gryffindor colours and emblem to Slytherin’s and tailoring it to fit better to Potter’s frame.
The Defence Professor, Barron White, pales upon seeing the soul orb pieces in Draco’s hands. “This-this—” He turns to the student who had possession of it. “How did you get this? Do you realise this is a highly restricted item?”
, beak wickedly sharp and eyes gleaming. She flies straight into the room and alights on the back of Draco’s chair.
? We may have reduced Slytherin numbers since the war,” she says, voice dry, “but you’re not the fourth year you once were.”
,” Pansy says coolly. “And after all, Harry himself up regardless. You’re suggesting we sacrifice many lives for one...is that not selfish?”
“It’s—too similar to your robes, but not different enough.” Harry reached for the one with a jacquard weave that shimmered.
In fact, Harry is doing this because his boyfriend has suddenly discovered a study friend in Hermione.
“I understand that it was uncomfortable for you to administer pastoral care to the Slytherins students, who aren’t in your original house,” McGonagall says. “As it were, Mr Malfoy and the other Eighth Year Slytherins have done a praise-worthy job. In this way, you can be relieved of those duties, and focus on teaching potions through these difficult times.”
many dark wizards. Aegis were just being fair. If they destroy pureblood houses, then the pureblood den of Slytherins must also go.”
“Make a delivery for you,” Taylor says with a sneer. He opens a box, and suddenly red Howlers spill forth.
Laurel Gardiner smiles gently, while her eyes spark with glee. “So this is where your house lies. A hole in the wall.”
Potter’s green eyes sparkle. “Somehow that sounds even more suspicious, Malfoy. Is there something you want to tell me?”
Harry looked down to the ground. “So you know that no one accepted my new book manuscript...I already know that I should stick to picture books, rather than novels.”
By the end of the spring break, the new furniture for the Great Hall and many of the classrooms are completed.
is akin to inanimate legilimency. While there exist wards that can detect intent, wards are stationary, and their spells are anchored across areas much larger than a little badge.
This Monday is no different. He has Charms with Professor Flitwick. Because of the Hogwarts reconstruction, the separate Slytherin classes have been re-joined with the other houses to form a single combined Charms class for each entire year level.
Harry drags Draco around the remnants of Hogwarts some more, just to make sure. But indeed, in every small nook and cranny, he can sense bits and pieces of magic. It’s there, it’s just not connected.
“I want to try for an animagus form too,” Harry says. “It would be amazing if I could fly with you.”
lighting spheres cast a warm glow to the green decor. The decadent and ornate furnishings are softened invitingly by details like messy piles of books and board games on the table surfaces, and throw blankets and cushions on the sofas.
The Ravenclaw, Jones, immediately pulls the sheets of charmed paper in front of him. “Of course, a classroom has to be
Draco lags back a little, placing himself between them and the Slytherins. But the Hufflepuffs don’t do anything.
“Yes…” She draws her wand and casts a privacy charm around them. “I saw that you were out last night. On the full moon. Harry…”
look at Harry before turning big eyes to Malfoy. “Did my stupid father reply yet? Can you take a look at my potions assignment, can you…”
Madam Pomfrey watches with unhidden concern as the students take their last Wolfsbane potion. That concern grows on her face as she looks at Draco and Harry.
Draco twirls his fingers again and heads to one of the lavatories, a large, single-occupancy stall. Harry arrives soon after.
Harry starts to groan. He shifts, curling up on himself. “I think I’m going to be sick,” he croaks out.
“The fuck, Draco,” Harry threw the blanket at Draco’s face. Draco easily knocked it aside, and turned, moving his legs onto the sofa. He nudged one foot at Harry’s thigh, and revelled in the widening of Harry’s eyes, gaze snapping to Draco’s feet.
.” Harry prods Draco in the chest. “Remember my careers list? There was absolutely no ‘Wizengamot member’ on the list!”
The new Great Hall is even bigger than the old one, better to accommodate the new seating arrangements. While Draco helps charm the new windows, Flitwick and McGonagall put in the Hogwarts sky ceiling spells. Other professors and students install hundreds of light fixtures, both along the wall and floating below the ceiling.
As for Harry...Draco lets him draft various letters to the Minister, to his friends. It is not Draco’s problem if more people become suspicious of Aegis.
Malfoy looks at him. Raises an eyebrow, corner of lips quirking. Harry drops his book. Leans forward, says, “
Jamie Ottley is one of those students playing with a couple of other boys, Liam Hedge and Owen Jones, a picnic blanket with crumbs and empty containers to the side. Large illustrated books of dragons lay on their laps and there are scattered photographs of Draco in his dragon form.
Draco takes out his wand and recalls those moments when the Dark Lord and Greyback tied him down and forced that concoction into him. The silvery memory emerges from his forehead and he directs it into the memory vial.
After a moment, Harry replies, “Think of it this way. If a known blood supremacist and anti-muggle wizard got up to the lectern and gave a lecture on arithmancy, would you trust anything they say?”
Later, many people in the Ministry had to take a second look at the stern Solicitor Draco Malfoy. Was he...
“Remember, Mr Malfoy, you must allow Professor Garren to disarm you, so that his wand ownership returns to him.”
There, Draco smirks wryly. “Never underestimate the power of capitalism,” he drawls. “Of course, for a time it was safer for us to pretend that we followed prominent muggle religion of the time. Merlin’s Arthur was Christain, after all, despite having the strongest wizard in Europe by his side.” Draco shrugs. “Some families eventually forgot that they were pretending. And some families were Christain when they entered the wizarding world.”
“But to keep your magic close to you is a skill in and of itself. It has similarities with occlumency, so Pansy is
Harry nods. “I know that there are more details, but…” He looks at every single person around the room. “Will you help me?”
Before the business of the Slytherin separation started, Narcissa was expending a lot of effort trying to arrange a marriage for Draco.
Nolan’s eyes widen. “No, sir!” His jaw tightens, his chest puffing up. “How could you get so injured? Aren’t you the strongest?”
The flames grow stronger. They don’t burn Draco—they feel nice and warm—but the Hufflepuffs stumble back, sweat appearing on their foreheads.
For the burgeoning Astronomy Tower, Draco collaborates with Flitwick to build a spell that allows one to see the stars through the clouds that often cover the Scottish skies. They also cast another spell on the viewing devices that allows one to see the stars during the daytime.
Harry shivers slightly as Draco’s magic rises strongly. An entire swathe of stones is moved in one go.
Given that the location is closer to the Hufflepuff Dormitories, Pomona takes the lead in surveying the embedded magic. “One of its lines has been severed,” she says in disbelief. “What kind of foreign magic were those students playing with?”
Needless to say, after what Draco pulled, he has no intention of returning home for the Easter break. He’s still busy, anyway. Over the Easter spring break, McGonagall wants to put in the last big effort to complete the school to a sufficient standard so that all students and classes can return to the castle.
“No, no,” Harry says, his hips chasing Draco’s fingers. He cries as Draco teases that oh-so-lovely bundle of nerves.
Harry puts his glasses on. Everyone else is still asleep, and the thestrals seem unconcerned. But why would Draco be wandering around in the middle of the night?
Harry’s eyes flicker to him. “And Merry Christmas to you, too.” But his tone is more distant than cheeky. He gives Draco a faint smile. “Aren’t you going to wake Pansy and Blaise so you can open a present?”
that’s it,” Harry forces out, trying to push down the pain. They’re on the kitchen floor. He’s so close to the Slytherin Commons.
Harry pants, chest heaving. Draco’s fucking is slow, slower. As though he’s trying to push out the last of Harry’s orgasm, as though he’s trying to push his come as deep as he can inside of Harry. Harry’s mind hazy. He reaches out for Draco, a little aimlessly, wraps his legs around Draco’s hips to keep that cock inside.

. Or did all of you completely ignore Professor McGonagall’s talk from the very start of the year? I’m in Slytherin now, so
But when she looked at that person’s memory, she found the same kind of anonymous letter as those who caused Aster to trip months ago.
At the moment, Felicity comes over. “Hello, would you like to join myself and Pansy? Not suitable for boys.”
to change. Or maybe the human side and dragon side are merging. This would explain a lot of the recent changes to his body, like the high body temperature and the fast healing rate.
Harry wakes up when the owl's claws dig into him. "Eh? What?" He shoves his glasses onto his face. "Draco?"
at him like that? Did Harry say an inadvertent compliment or insult? Perhaps the Ministry comment? Lucius Malfoy used to be in the pockets of Ministry officials, right?
Meanwhile, Creevey is fighting with Taylor, and Taylor’s friends are watching as Creevey gets beaten up.
The world becomes familiarly ‘small’ as Draco pads towards the group of students on his four limbs, two wings raised high, silver tail sweeping behind him.
At exactly 5:55 pm, there was a knock on the front door. Harry leapt to his feet and hurried to open it.
Harry spending the rest of the day working together with Ron and Hermione goes a long way to rebuild some of their past camaraderie, the way working together typically does.
Next week. That was a long time away… Harry was now retroactively grateful for the fact that Draco had spent the night.
Potter speaks about his dementor-invoked-memory of his mum screaming. About the stories he’s gathered of his parents. Some of which were from Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, who are also dead, and now Potter’s scared he’s remembered them wrong. Potter goes from laughing about a prank, to crying about the people who carried them out.
Gardiner fights back more strongly this time round, but the moment Draco summons fire with his hand, she flinches, perfect timing for Draco’s other hand holding his wand to cast.
The second night Nolan had transformed, he had...sulked, and kept to himself away from other transformed students.
There is no scent of injury or fading offensive spells around them anymore, but Draco gives Jamie a critical look regardless.
is a tangible representation that not only has Hogwarts accepted him as the Head of Slytherin, but the Slytherins have too.
Soon, Harry was completely naked, while Draco was only topless. The brush of the fabric of Draco’s trousers against the skin of Harry’s thighs sent a little thrill in Harry’s chest.
Malfoy’s other hand lands firmly on Harry’s mouth. It smells like a hint of musky sweat, and basil and chocolate, and the warm softness of Malfoy’s fingers causes a tingle to spread across Harry’s skin. He breathes deeply.
At the last moment, Draco lays a hand on Potter’s shoulder instead. His heart thuds at the close call. Head patting an ex arch rival on the head would be unseemly.
Potter frowns as Draco sweeps a cold gaze across the Great Hall. When he has the attention of the other students, he finally speaks.
Harry cried out, his chest tight. “I’m going to break, I’m going to break—” he mumbled incoherently.
It has been dark for a long while by the time the group of students, plus Madame Pomfrey, head out into the night.
Malfoy smirks. “Violent, I approve.” He takes a seat on the tall stool to Harry’s side instead. “Now carry on.”
Draco hums noncommittally. He absently reaches out to Hogwarts through his magic: direct physical contact is no longer necessary.
In the late afternoon, a silvery otter passes through the Slytherin walls and stops in front of Harry, who is putting on his warm overcloak (and hat and scarf and gloves,
The Slytherin table in the Great Hall has been vandalised. The ceiling of the Great Hall feels lower—the spell for the ceiling is growing patchy, allowing him to see the naked ceiling above. Everywhere Draco looks, he can see magical threads fraying as Slytherin repels from the rest.
However, for the rest of the day, Draco doesn’t have time to carefully monitor Harry’s movements and emotional state.
Harry rubs his head against Draco’s warm chest. He places Draco’s hand in his hair. And like that, he falls asleep, happy.
With the way Draco is going, he might even be able to hold a Wizengamot seat in his lifetime, despite the
“You must be tired after running around with the kids all evening. Tuck yourself into bed and go to sleep, or I’ll make you.”
. Draco’s heart felt sweet and sour. He picked up the book, smoothing its pages, and placed it on the coffee table. Pulling aside the blanket, Draco slowly lifted Harry up.
“Of course.” Draco kissed the top of Harry’s head. “I’ll be out in a moment. Take your friends to the living room.”
Together, they can feel how it starts. In the Great Hall, cracks are spreading across the floor, up the walls. Dust starts to spread as stone grates across stone.
Harry blinks up at him. His green eyes are wide, pupils blow, the blush constant. “Please, daddy, fuck me, fuck me hard.”
Finally in a quiet moment for himself, Draco takes a seat on one of the couches by the wall and reads through his parents’ letters. It is all as expected. He folds the letters back up and looks over the Common Room. Various students are relaxing or chatting. For this brief time, there’s no stress or pressure from the world outside these walls.
His hips slammed harshly against Harry’s bottom, which was burning hot. His cock pistoned in and out of Harry’s hole.
Filch’s office, it turns out, is on the ground floor. The inside is filled with confiscated items, a handful of empty portraits, and a
Draco summons a house-elf to serve them an early breakfast: it is much too vulgar to open all the presents before having their morning meal.
Hitchly watches with narrowed eyes. Lucius Malfoy is obedient enough, with the threat of Azkaban as a wand against his neck, but Narcissa Malfoy is clearly looking down on him.
Charlie complied. He put his muscles to good use. With the first hard thrust, Harry finally let out a delicious little moan.
He’s thinking about how he’s not entirely sure he feels safe in Gryffindor anymore. Not with Mason and Taylor and their friendship groups eyeing him across the common room. Not with how Creevey led those people to Slytherin’s entrance.
The information about Draco’s declaration spread...which students or professors was it? Do those requesting duels have any connections with Aegis? It would certainly be convenient for them to let someone else come in and destroy Malfoy Manor for them.
With Sequoia in his arms, Draco breaks the soul orb. This time, he is much more prepared, catching Sequoia’s magic before it rebounds against Hogwarts. It helps that Sequoia isn’t as powerful as Harry.
Then, there’s Hannah Abbot from Hufflepuff, along with two young girls, both carrying their bookbags.
That Friday evening, McGonagall announces that the Head of Houses will be conducting career meetings with students fifth year and up, starting from the Eighth years and working back.
Robards gives Draco an annoyed look. He grabs one of the last Aurors heading into the floo. “Speak!”
Draco’s eyes narrow at the letter in the owl’s claws. It comes from his father’s desk. When has his father
Malfoy’s nostrils flare. “Oh,” he says, sickly sweet. “Should I call one of the guards back with their newly-polished, sharp, and efficient sword?”
His stomach grumbles, but class is still going. Jamie quickly looks around: Flitwick is on the other side of the groups of students, speaking with a group that includes Michelle. Importantly, his back is to Jamie.
Draco’s lips curled up. “Pretend I’m not here. Between Harry and Hermione, you can learn everything about me.”

“We should separate Hogwarts now,” he says, after casting a privacy charm just-in-case. “It’s better if we do it cleanly, rather than waiting for Hogwarts to collapse.”
Two fingers... three fingers... four?—no, Harry wakes properly before Draco can fist him, a shuddering gasp that sounds a lot like, “
The smell of bloody meat jerks Draco’s attention—and the attention of all the thestrals, too. The foals abandon Draco’s tail to prance around on the spot, eagerly awaiting their meal.
Hagrid has the bright idea of letting them play with the dragon toy. Professor Flitwick must have charmed it because the dragon toy can now fly. The young thestrals
The juvenile thestrals are like the junior-years Slytherins, Draco thinks lazily. No fear after the adults give authorisation. Often, no fear before that too.
She suspects that Draco is indeed an animagus, but is calling himself a ‘weredragon’ as an excuse to avoid Ministry persecution. But when the ‘weredragon’ status information gets out, it’ll affect his marriage prospects negatively instead, even if she tells the other pureblood families that Draco isn’t really a weredragon.
Hermione watches Harry’s receding back. Seven years together and now he prefers the Slytherins over them…
They press their hands together, palm to palm. The magic in the air coalesces around them as the bond settles in their chests.
It’s not even noon yet, and the sun is bright, and it’s already shaping up to be a very interesting day.
Harry cleared his throat. “Aren’t we both men? Can’t we set our own rules? After all, you’re Draco Malfoy and
Draco sat down on the other end of the sofa, his long legs stretched out. How had Harry not noticed how long Draco’s legs were under those fussy robes?
. Consider this your warning. Professor McGonagall is already aware of the situation, and if it does not better itself, she
“Hold down the Commons,” he says sharply to Pansy. He races to the Common room exit, hand out. A few moments later, his broom smacks into his palm.
Draco sneers and he shoves Garren again. Garren stumbles backward. Draco kicks his knee and shoves him out of Severus’s office and into the empty corridor.
? Why is it so big?” Her eyes move from the mezzanine library, to the tables already half-filled with breakfast for those Slytherins up a little earlier.
“If you’re staying back, then I’m staying back too. Just in case you get into another duel without me.”
Harry, after seeing Draco deal so easily with Nolan, decides to bring up the idea of potential children again. Draco quickly princess-carries Harry to bed and discovers (or rather, uncovers~) the special last gift that Harry prepared for him.
“We offer you this.” He tilts the vessel, droplets of blood falling, and starts walking in the circle once more. “Back to fire. Back to air. Back to earth. Back to sea.”
Draco remains watching for the next hour as the magical theorists continue to analyse and discuss the state of the rubble of Hogwarts, while McGonagall inputs in mild comments.
Nolan makes a grumpy sound, but he flops down on the mattress nonetheless. It’s many times more comfortable than the hard, cold ground of the Forbidden Forest.
Draco smirks. He sits up, taking off the last of his clothes. Harry’s eyes immediately snap to his chest, travel down his abs, and land on his hard cock.
per se. But when he tries to investigate further, the hum disappears and the staircase moves smoothly once more.
Draco’s thrust was extra hard, extra punishing. A scowl was clear in his voice as he growled, “You’re looking at him. He’s looking at you. Can you really say you never thought of fucking him? Who’s your boyfriend, Harry? Who’s your future husband,
Pansy prods his forehead. "Feeling a sense of abandonment already? By that point, I think you'll have other things on your mind."
McGonagall walks up onto the stage. She has a rare warm smile. “Thank you, everyone, for your efforts. This meeting has now ended. Enjoy a short break before your first class.”
Tonight is not the night Draco wants to talk to her though. He’s sure it would ruin the atmosphere. So instead, Draco goes over to the thestrals to help supervise.
As they approached the kitchen, Draco emerged. He was wearing an apron with a cute picture of a chubby dragon that Harry had drawn. He came up behind Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry’s eyes immediately shone as he rested back against Draco’s chest.
Mary Green grits her teeth. “Yes, Madame Pomfrey,” she forces out. She throws one last annoyed look at the dark trees in the Forest, but ultimately leaves.
, okay? Kingsley did promise that I would be kept safe, but I know how to duel. Do you think I spent the entire of the last seven years of my life coddled up?! I know how to fight too!”
On Saturday evening, while the Ministry rebuilding them are grimacing as they draft up new plans and wrack their brains for things they think needs to change for a successful Hogwarts, the lawn outside the Slytherin Building is a brightly lit al fresco dining and playing-around space. Multiple non-Slytherins students come. Draco makes sure that no Ministry-people try to sneak in by setting up privacy wards and monitoring and directly letting in any arrivals.
Cue Draco falling into the rabbit hole of imagining Harry in compromising positions… At this point, there’s no going back, sorry not sorry, Draco ╮（╯＿╰）╭
Harry moaned as Draco deepened the kiss. He felt like he was falling, yet his heart seemed to be flying. His entire body slowly melted, kept upright only by Draco’s grace. Soft moans and gasps filled the air as Draco pressed closer and closer. Harry was moved until he was lying down on the sofa, yet Draco only paused for the briefest of moments before capturing Harry’s mouth once more, covering Harry with his body.
...But he sees Potter again and again. They have a lot of NEWTs classes together. They have their meals in the Great Hall.
Hermione huffs. “If you want to enjoy the weekend tomorrow, you need to get your work done now. That does it, we’re all meeting at the Library immediately after class. You both will get the Transfiguration assignment done while it’s still fresh in your minds.”
Pansy gives him a look. “You didn’t see how worried he was when he realised you were missing...He’s going to give you a whole bag of badges, I’m sure.”
Draco’s arms wrap around him in a proper embrace. “We’ll come back tonight when the professors aren’t watching,” he whispers. “But for now, let’s take a break and visit the thestrals, how about that?”
Malfoy’s eyes are narrowed as he takes Harry’s arm. The side-along throws off Harry’s balance, and he emerges on the other side in Malfoy’s arms. Malfoy rather quickly pushes him away.
McGonagall’s expression becomes heavier. She checks the time and stands up. “We have more to discuss, but I will call you at a later date.” Her lips twist into a wry expression. “Unfortunately, the Hogwarts Board of Governors is meeting in a few minutes on the topic of Slytherin’s separation.”
The three walk past Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, one of them purposely bumping into Lucius’s shoulder. Lucius sneers, but he cannot say anything.
“Then what will, Hermione? What fucking will?” Harry shakes her off. He thinks about heading up to his dorm room, but instead turns around back to the exit.
McGonagall’s eyes flash. “I’ll see what I can do. As I understand it, Professor Flitwick has been helping you. If there is anything else, don’t hesitate to ask.”
But now, it’s the Slytherins’ turn to sit back and relax as McGonagall and Sprout move the Hufflepuff building. It doesn’t take as long to move Hufflepuff back, as the dorms hadn’t moved so far.
In fact, McGonagall has invited a number of trusted Hogwarts alumni, including past professors, to both help with the teaching and to help with the rebuilding. The younger Slytherin alumni who aid in deconstructing parts of the Slytherin dormitories and common room all have to face the fact that Harry Potter, the golden Gryffindor, is really now in their old House…
Malfoy’s hands are different from Harry’s. They’re much paler, the tips tapered. They look soft, too.
Draco quickly buttons up his shirt as Potter approaches. A large group of thestrals have wandered over to Hagrid, but a group remains around Draco, watching Potter’s bucket of meat approaching. Potter sets the bucket down, and the thestrals trot over to eat.
Many families have come, taking the opportunity to see their children. Now that many students have established cross-House friendships, their parents must politely greet each other, which is especially awkward for those families whose members typically get sorted into one house. However, as it turns out, talking about their children is an easy common conversation topic.
“No,” Malfoy says smirking. He holds a hand out, and a vial of lube smacks into his palm. “I’m going to fuck you with them on...with you. Naked. Laid out like a
Meanwhile, Blaise proceeds to rest a hand against one of the walls of Gryffindor. Hogwarts magic takes a different undertone—the undertone of thousands of Gryffindors who have resided in this tower since the beginning. It is more resilient than the common areas, but Blaise can already see the fraying edges and gaps in the magic where Slytherin’s magic has been forced out. With Ron and Hermione and Harry’s magic, the tower should survive intact. Maybe.
,” Draco says. He rubs Harry’s curls. “You’re a contributing member of Slytherin. We’re happy to have you here.”
Blaise pats Harry on the shoulder. “Considering your Gryffindorish actions this morning, you can help reinforce Gryffindor Tower and apply cushioning charms.”
“How can I make you pay? This is my treat. Thank you.”—That last thank you was to the waiter returning his card. Malfoy stood up, and Harry followed him out.

Both Alyss and Francis nod seriously. After getting his permission, they quickly head over to the other first years to tell them the news.
“Of course. ” Draco presses a hand on Potter’s back and nudges him to the Christmas tree. “Go hang something up. Every other Slytherin here has done so.”
But before Michelle can say anything, snide or otherwise, Jones says loudly, “Before you go on a tangent about

The wolves jump over and eat. Harry sneakily takes the opportunity to sit down next to Malfoy on the blankets.
“Any wizards committing the same crimes would be—wait, no?” Hitchly frowns when Robards’ rejection catches up to him. “Why not? He’s clearly in violation of the Animagus Registration Act! He is clearly engaging in dangerous unauthorised duels with other witches and wizards!”
“I guess I’ll go visit the thestrals by myself then,” Draco says. “Well, they like me more than you anyway.”
With his other hand, Draco slowly nudged Harry. In sleep, Harry hardly resisted. After a quiet groan, Harry obediently rolled onto his stomach.
Narcissa Malfoy is sitting in the Malfoy winter gardens when a house-elf pops up and notifies her of a visitor. She returns unhurried to her drawing room to find the old Madam Greengrass, the grandmother of Astoria and Daphne Greengrass.
After escorting all of the reporters, Minerva McGonagall makes sure every last one of them leaves the grounds and decisively closes the Hogwarts gates. She’ll let the reporters
The lift reaches their floor and the two go to their quarters and climb back into bed, curling up into their usual sleeping positions.
“I can make a replica of my cock if you want to hold it. Or a life-sized doll if you want to hug me when I’m gone,” Draco said teasingly.
Pansy props herself up on one arm, smiling exasperatedly at Harry. “Don’t be so stiff. I promise you, Draco is very warm and snuggly.”
Harry’s magic rises around them like an aura. It’s extremely familiar to Draco, but the other students flinch a little—likely not even realising exactly

“I can’t say I’m enjoying your sticky behaviour,” Draco drawls. “Is this how you behave with your sidekicks? I’m surprised you’re not out at Hogsmeade with them.”
, and what is the Ministry going to do? How is Harry going to rebuild? What more things do they need to consider? How can they transform their dreams into action? Can they build something that actually stands up and lasts another 1000 years?
.” Malfoy’s head turned slightly as he examined the full breadth of the painting. The corner of his mouth curled up when a number of animals popped out to see the new visitor.
“You! Little! Slut!” Each word was punctuated with a thrust, each word forcing a moan from Harry’s chest as pleasure radiated out.
Draco pats Nolan’s head. “You’re still one of my Slytherins, and that will never change unless you want to denounce your Slytherinship and—”
“Yes, sir!” The little Slytherins split back up into their year groups and quickly head to a table to sit down and do work.
Under the cover of the thestrals, they fly directly over the location. Draco looks down, his eyes flashing as the pupils change to dragon eyes. He can make out the irregular shapes that are Greyback’s crew. He can smell the stench of meat on them too.
“Yeah, Malfoy,” Potter says. “Unless you’re scared of some raw meat.” He raises both eyebrows, in mockery of Draco’s own eyebrows.
“Very well,” Evander Urquhart spells up a miniature Quidditch playing field and with the ‘help’ from his team members, goes through the match.
Pansy comes out of the classroom with the rest of the Slytherin third years. The other girls—Alberta Bulstrode, Raven Flint, and Rose Datta—cluster around Draco and Sequoia, while Nolan and Harley stay near Pansy’s side.
Potter’s smile becomes soft. “Malfoy, the Slytherins really love you. Especially Nolan, am I right?”
Garren’s expression darkens. “Tch.” He rights his clothing. “Give me back my wand, Malfoy. I haven’t time to play around with you.
“Oh.” Ron looks at Harry. “Good to have you with us. Hermione says that I should admit that I missed you.”
want to move back into the castle. The fickle papers have jumped to some scandal about some celebrity.
, which is based on how often a word appears in a text. It is a common feature for text-classification. Common “stopwords” are removed, including articles (a, the…) and prepositions (in, on…). However, “Draco Malfoy” isn’t a common word in the general literature, hence names remain in the models.
The house-elf opens her mouth to speak. Then her eyes widen as she takes in her location. She starts to shake a little.
?” Lucius gives a hollow laugh. “All of our connections are either in Azkaban or have fled to the Continent. You couldn’t even secure a marriage for Draco!”
Hitchly shuffles to the side, embarrassed and angry as the other Auror, named Inkwood, walks in. Auror Inkwood is the one who is now in charge of the Malfoys under house arrest.
This time, Draco begins first, threading the ring onto Harry’s hand. “With this ring, I bind myself to you.”
. Draco was the rebound, the one he returned to after a bad date, after a breakup of a short relationship.
that Draco’s voice was even. He started to run his fingers over Harry’s cock, which was filling under his actions. His eyes sharpened over Harry’s every expression. There was no trace of anxiety or displeasure in Harry’s eyes; the little furrow in his brow and his parted lips were from pleasure. With a quick movement, Draco thumbed Harry’s slit and stroked Harry firmly.
Draco’s lips pressed firmly, and his tongue dominated Harry. A large hand rucked up Harry’s shirt, teasing his skin. Harry shivered at the sensation, unconsciously breaking the kiss.
“For you, they might,” Draco says. His fingers twitch. He wants to give Harry something for his lips.
Rather than speaking anymore, Draco pulls Harry closer and occupies their lips. Harry immediately softens (it’s a pavlovian response, he’s sure), immersing himself in the familiar sensation of Draco’s lips. Their mouths part and their tongues slide across each other. Warmth builds in Harry’s body.
At the breakfast table, Blaise notices Draco’s frown and says, “Think about it this way. This matter is already known. The Ministry will investigate. It is clear that Aegis has done this in order to throw the public off their own crimes, but we can spin it to our advantage.”
“I’m sure Ben thinks I ‘caught it’ from you,” River replies. “Nevermind that trans people exist among muggles too!”
Harry shoots Nolan a look. “Well, I was distracted this morning when you were putting on those robes, and then you left first and….and you didn’t remind me! And wait, what about
Draco drops a kiss on Harry’s nose, making Harry blink in surprise. He leans in close to Harry’s ear and says in a low tone, “Nervous? There won’t be any of that kind of deflowering happening.”
“No, no!” Dilly looks more horrified now than when she first saw the wolves. “Dilly is feeding students, no compensation!” She disappears with a quiet
Harry throws his head back, tilts his arse up. “All the bathrooms have privacy charms, Malfoy,” he says brazenly. Like he’s
Later that day, Harry and Draco went to the Burrow. Harry had no idea if people could tell that he had been fucked raw, three times in the last 24 hours. Draco acted as usual, at least...until he pulled Harry onto his lap in front of all the other Weasleys.
this date is organised by Draco, so Harry doesn’t even need to worry about that. There is literally nothing to worry about—
“Professor Garren, do you know what’s about to happen?” A small group of inquisitive muggleborn Ravenclaws asks.
So Harry listens to Blaise and does so, showing Hermione, Ron, Neville, Hannah, Ginny, and Luna all the different parts of the Slytherin Commons.
Draco doesn’t spend long entertaining them. He transforms back into his human shape and dresses. “Now, today I have come to invite you to a play date with the students,” he says to the thestral leader while patting the young thestrals sniffing at him.
: ….  I came out to have a good time and I’m honestly feeling so attacked right now. Wait, call me papa!
There’s nothing romantic about Harry holding Draco’s hand, trying to dredge up as much magic as possible. He only stops when Draco says to stop, only to find that he doesn’t even have any energy left to climb up the stairs. They have to summon a house-elf to apparate them out and back to the Slytherin Building.
Draco can’t resist an exasperated smile as wolf-Nolan turns around. He scratches under Nolan’s chin for a moment.
“You’re soooo cheesy, darling Draco,” Harry said. He tilted his head and licked Draco’s fingers. Draco let him, slipping the fingers in deeper.
“Now imagine your magic as an aura around you—I know, I can see it. When you breathe in, gather that magic, wrapping it around up. As you breathe out, disperse it under your skin instead of outside in the air.”
Draco holds the vessel over the yule log fire. The flames lick up his hands, but they do not burn him. Someone starts to play the flute, its lilting tones rising through the air.
“Ruff!” Nolan protests, pressing his head into Mr Malfoy’s toasty-warm hand and familiar wood-fire-smokey scent.
At dinner that evening, a few days before Christmas, Draco notices the glances his parents give him and the others, which is more contemplative than the annoyance at the speaking at the dining table.
“One thread is weak, but weave many threads together and we produce strength,” Blaise says. “Here’s what we will do…”
Draco arrived late that Sunday, apparating outside and walking in with the key that Harry had given him. His brows wrinkled slightly upon seeing Harry asleep on the sofa, blanket haphazard, a book forgotten on the floor.
Harry cringes every single time another part of Hogwarts detaches, although Draco can see it happening, although Harry should be able to sense it ahead of time.
Harry hides his hands behind his back. “Just curious. I hope he’s doing well and all. I heard he attended a muggle university.”
Draco’s lips also curl up when he thinks about the Ministry being in an uproar when their “gifts” arrive…
Nolan launches forward, tackling the bastards. To his side, Harley immediately joins the fight. They draw wands; fighting in such close quarters, there’s no need to aim, just cast!
Garren’s smile turns cool as he stands up. “Very well, sounds like you’re sorted, Mr. Potter. If there is anything you need, or any issues that arise, do not hesitate to speak to me.”
shows the Ministry-team’s latest progress over the weekend, stressing how magical castle building must be done slowly and carefully, just about every other paper shows various scenes of the Ministry team facing off with the thestrals, and every single other time that “rebuilt” Hogwarts has crumbled under the Ministry team’s hands.
Draco looked away. “Of course I do,” he drawled, affecting nonchalance. He hurried into the kitchen and started pulling out ingredients for one of the more complicated recipes.
,” Garren says sharply, closing the distance between them. “What are you doing, wondering about? It’s past curfew.”
Draco grits his teeth, sending magic to Harry through their bond. He dives towards the lone Aegis member who
“Be careful of the snakes,” Ben Taylor says meaningfully. “Though if you like Harry Potter so much, you should follow his lead and resort to their house.”
Harry jumps onto Draco’s staircase step and wraps an arm around Draco. “Save me, Draco! Keep me safe!”
Draco slowly puts on the robes his Slytherins have gifted him and calls a House-wide meeting to tell them what he wants to do.
But with all the Muggles around, Harry couldn’t take out his wand to cast a warming charm, and it wasn’t a charm that he could do wandlessly either. He could only wrap his arms around himself in an attempt to keep some warmth, pulling his leather jacket tighter around his body.
Leftover goods go to charity at the end of the day, and Harry returns home first. Lately, Harry’s been teaching Draco to cook, and Harry has hopes yet that Draco can learn enough skills to help host a dinner party at their place; every other day, at least, they are eating at friends (Gryffindor or otherwise), or those friends are at Grimmauld Place where Harry does the cooking (and Draco buys pre-made stuff).
So Harry does. But this time, both of them step inside, and Draco closes it behind them. Harry has just enough time to balance the lunch on top of a pile of galleons before Draco shoves him against a conveniently empty wall and starts fucking his mouth with his tongue. WIth luck, and some seduction, Harry’ll have Draco fucking his mouth with his cock. The alternative is that cock in his arse, which, truth be told, sounds really good as well. There’s no way Harry can lose.
tolerate any misbehaviour! Eat your breakfasts in an orderly fashion and proceed to your morning classes.”
Draco gives a pointed look at Harry, one of those students currently not focusing on the set curriculum.
jealous if they knew that I had met their favourite book author. But I’ll keep it a secret, between the two of us.” Malfoy’s tone seemed to dip, as though he meant another kind of secret.
“Perhaps they’re unstable, then,” Felicity conjectures. “Afterall, they shouldn’t be crushed so easily…”
Thankfully, Harry felt Draco’s gaze lift off. So Harry returned to watching the movie, eating the popcorn, and glancing at Draco’s feet, and trying not to catalogue all the times that Draco must have seen Harry’s own knobbly ankles.
Draco helps set up all the warming charms, the weather-protection charms, the lighting charms, and also helps set a large even platform over the grass. Multiple ‘zones’ are set up, from the food section to a cozy section around an open fire, to various areas with the games the younger students have bought out.  The thestrals come to play, and Hagrid also brings over a couple of kneazles and crups for students to pet.
Potter glances at him and mumbles, “Of course you would say that.” He re-adjusts his robes and runs a hand through his hair hiding the redden tips of his ears.
Meanwhile, Draco decides to research magical bonds, in particular, loyalty bonds. When magical Lords and Ladies were prevalent in the feudal past, families and mages would be aligned under a particular Family Head. The relationship between the Head and the vassals would be magically codified in loyalty bonds. These bonds allowed the Head to draw on the magic of their vassals, but in turn, the Head had the responsibility to protect their vassals.
Draco Malfoy gave her a flat stare. “Of course I understand, Granger. But then allow me the same privilege. If
Draco sends a sharp gaze down the Slytherin table. Who among his Slytherins have been affected? Whose families lived in Knockturn Alley?
Harry heads up to the dorm room to get something more presentable to wear than the Christmas jumper he had thrown on earlier. Draco follows him up.
charm, the hood pulled down over his hair, and Hermione’s order token in hand, Harry entered the potions apothecary. Little did he know that his charm had been stripped off by the wards the moment he entered the shop.
Harry’s mouth opens, as though he wants to say something, but then his lips twist into a defeated expression.
There’s an unsettled feeling in her chest as she walks down the halls. Something has changed in Hogwarts, and it’s concentrated in the below-ground floors where Slytherin lies.
Hogwarts is no longer fractious, as its different parts, castle and inhabitants, create bonds across Houses. Greyback and Aegis are dealt with, and his Slytherins have been pulled through, safe. And Draco has even acquired an unexpected future husband, Harry James Potter.
Turns out that Harry can make fast friends with the other bakers and cooks at the muggle classes he attends. He ends up dating one of them—everyone
resorted,” Potter says with a grin. “You’re just temporarily taking a...educational exchange down in the Slytherin.”
In the dining room, Draco had already set out dinner—at one seat. The chair automatically pulled out, and Draco sat down, shifting Harry onto his lap, Harry’s back against Draco’s arm, legs dangling off the side.
The tall Ravenclaw recovers with a red face. “We never intended to kill anyone! If you...if you looked through my mind properly, you would know that! It was meant to be fairly harmless! We didn’t know it was going to be that bad.”
“I didn’t ask you,” Nolan mutters. But nonetheless, he reaches out and lightly touches Draco’s tail.
: Indeed, I’m also AA’s parent as well as BB’s and [goes on to list an impressive number of children]. That said, if you truly don’t want to speak to me, then I can bring in Harry, who is their other parent. ╮(￣_￣)╭
She hurries over, only to see new platforms and pillars, and a plain stone floor hiding the dark waters below. For a moment, she can’t believe her eyes. Can Harry and Malfoy have
He makes the first sacrifice: a cut on his arm, and blood dripping into a traditional Yule vessel. It heals quickly, and Blaise and Pansy go next.
All the Slytherin students at dinner stand up smoothly and head out. Draco glances over to the Gryffindor table and meets Harry’s eyes. Harry nods and stands up.
Malfoy is sitting on the ground on top of a nest of blankets and cushions. His pale face and white hair glows in the darkness. There are three wolves crowding him. One of them is growling and baring its sharp teeth at Harry. The two other wolves are looking at Harry too, their eyes bright and calculating.
“Didn’t you hear about the Ministry security breach?” Hermione retorts. “We know that Hogwarts is not impenetrable.”
Jamie Ottley quickly looks up. “Good evening, Professor! We’re practicing for the rebuilding next week!”
“There are a dozen other matters they can arrest you over,” McGonagall says wryly. “Very well, then you and Mr Potter may leave.”
“The Greengrass’s youngest daughter is available,” Narcissa said, as she pushed a lock of Draco’s hair behind his ear.
“It’s cold,” Harry mutters. “You better defeat him quickly so we can go to bed. We still have classes tomorrow.”
Harry opens the entrance for them. He makes sure they’re out and the entrance has closed before returning back to Slytherin.
: The Houses were set up by the Founders. Are you so self-conceited as to compare yourself with Salazar Slytherin?? Are you better than Merlin??
As part of their terms, Lucius is under house arrest for a decade, and the senior Aurors have the power to enter at least once a month for a ‘spot check’.
“You know,” Harry said. He pressed a kiss on the back of Draco’s hand. He slowly tugged Draco to the dance floor, through the watching crowd. “And sometimes, I want everyone else to know too.”
“Malfoy,” Nguyen says, “Flitwick asked me to give you these for now. He said he’ll come to talk to you later.”
Harry ignores Blaise, slowly descending the stairs instead, wand ready in his other hand. He knows that Draco is quietly following him.
“I should have cast more spells!” Harry says. “We should have cast spells to help it remain upright…”
On Saturday evening, Minerva McGonagall goes over to where the Slytherins and increasing numbers of other students are congregating to check that there is no fighting.
“Mr Taylor, you’re not enjoying the sun with the other students,” Professor Hooch approaches him sitting in the corner of the Gryffindor tent with concern. “Is there anything you would like to talk about? It will be strictly confidential.”
Over the next few days, the drawer fills up slowly with newspaper clippings that Harry has been gathering in-between his gardening and babysitting duties.
“Well, I have an even more urgent business! I have the security clearance to know the Minister’s location!”
“...We’ll deal with one problem at a time,” Robards finally says tiredly. “We need to record the damage done by those criminals and determine how they entered Hogwarts ground.”
. Garren’s wand sputters out some light that steadily brightens until Garren has to squint. “Think again,
A gentle sensation down there cleaned them both up. Draco tucked them both back in, and patted Harry’s back.
“Engaged? Our Harry is engaged?” George said, excited. Since he’d gotten engaged with Lee Jordan, his love-life had been the main source of gossip. If someone else got engaged, he’ll be released!
better than the stuff you were trying to conjure up. I’ll be nice and let you have one. Me and Jamie and Liam can get more from the house-elves,” he adds with a look of superiority.
Draco rubs his forehead in betrayal. “I hate you too, Pansy,” he says, pulling a face. “We better leave before the Ravenclaws come next.”
And if Draco accepts these robes, then he must wear the mantle of responsibilities as the Head of Slytherin.
Suppressing a sigh, Minerva lifts her chin and addresses one of the senior portraits at the top of the stairwell, a distinguished witch from Hogworts’ alumni.
transform. He’s burning. He needs to spread his wings, blanket his friends and Aster. Growl and burn and
As the new week arrives, as Draco predicted, the third years have also given up Potions and Muggle studies—Muggle studies used to be an elective, but is now compulsory post war from first to fifth year.
In a bright and airy room in Grimmauld Place, Draco makes a face at the vague silvery mist emitting from his wand. The window overlooks the back garden, where Nolan and some other Slytherins are playing.
“Indeed, the difference between the first team and the second team is huge,” another theorist says austerely. “We believe that Headmistress McGonagall is suitable to lead the construction of the new Hogwarts.”
, and it’s hard to change, and dropping a subject or picking up an entirely new one are equally daunting prospects.
Gardiner scoffs. “Nice party trick, Malfoy,” she says, giving a negligent flick of a hand. “Now, if you

gets the most reluctant students moving. Someone yawns, and then the yawns spread like a wave. The Slytherins file up to bed, and Draco and Harry follow behind them. Draco holds Harry’s arm in order to stay standing. He has a growing headache that’s probably the aftermath of apparating through wards, twice, in dragon form.
In his sleep, Harry’s lips are set in the slightest frown, his eyelashes dark and thick. Draco’s hand itches, an urge building his chest. He reaches out and rubs Harry’s curls.
. His robes had been lost in the initial transformation. The baby thestrals cluster around him, trying to protect Draco’s modesty, but it’s not going to work.
Meanwhile, in Harry and Draco’s room, Harry watches as Draco puts on his fancy Slytherin robes with the dragon crest. On Draco’s desk is a letter from McGonagall requesting his presence.
But, with the flurry of due-in assignments prior to Samhain/Halloween on the weekend—and the other houses working hard on their costumes—inter-house conflict ebbs down.
Harry makes the executive decision to approach Malfoy himself after spotting Malfoy in the Library without his friends. Harry approaches from behind, and for a moment, Malfoy’s back stumps him: the shape looks different. A little broader, perhaps. It tickles something in Harry:
And although the momentum behind the call to reinstate Slytherin is not overwhelming, the Ministry team’s failures in the rebuilding are discussed in detail across the papers, the wireless, and by the public.
Harry gives a noncommittal shrug. The Slytherin Commons is more than that; it seems as though it’s changing every day whenever Blaise and Draco convene with Hogwarts and the house-elves. “It grows on you. I’ll see you tomorrow. Seriously, Ron, Hermione, you’re both still my best mates. But I really
“Are you sleepy?” Mr. Malfoy waves an arm, and a large round mattress appears. “Sleep, you still have classes tomorrow.”
The team is filled with professional craft mages who have built many modern magical houses, and two people who have participated in the reconstruction of other magical castles on the Continent.
(Jamie hasn’t seen Mr Malfoy interact with students from the other houses nearly as much as Mr Zabini, so that makes Mr Zabini the better hypothetical model.)
Draco offers him his handkerchief. “I could light a fire,” he says. “Conduct a small Samhain ritual.”
become exhausted,” Pansy says. She moves next to Harry and takes a hold of Harry’s wrist. “Give some of my magic to him too.”
Potter snorts. “More like as Death-Eater-bait. Kingsley tracks my mail and traces back any malicious ones.” Potter’s voice tightens. “I just thought—killing Voldemort would be the end of it. But it’s
“Harry,” Hermione’s voice emerges from the otter patronus, “Are you really going to stay inside Slytherin the entire time? Please reply, we haven’t seen you in so long.”
been a romantic entanglement,” Draco admitted. He didn’t meet his mother’s eyes. “I don’t know if it’ll last. I don’t know if it’ll fade. But maybe, if it’s long term, if they’re willing, then I bring them over for tea one day.”
Pansy steps up to Draco’s side, her eyes narrowed. Both of them exit Slytherin, making the entrance behind them close back into a smooth wall.
“Now stay here,” Draco tells Potter sternly, pushing down to a sofa by the central fireplace. “You can play with the other students for a while. If you want to play some more with your Gryffindor friends, that can also be arranged.”
Harry snorts. “I forgot that you’re a rich country boy,” he says with a grin on his lips. “But I’m more than rich enough to buy a place in the countryside. Apparating and flooing wouldn’t be a problem.”
Hermione says, “I do feel sorry for them, planning and building a castle takes a lot more time than two weeks, and yet they had to prepare a new plan in just three days.”
Harry’s arms were firm around his waist. How long had it been since Draco had sustained touch? Draco sucked in a rattling breath. Breathed again, and purposefully moved to the side, loosening Harry’s hold. Purposefully started preparing dinner.
The panel of theorists all straighten up, and upon Minister Shacklebolt’s words, begin to orderly cast various diagnostic and recording spells.
Looping images of the reintegration of Slytherin and Hufflepuff grace many newspapers on Monday morning.
Hermione hates it whenever he mentions how he needed to die, even if it’s the truth. In this matter, Harry would side with Parkinson. If his death would bring back all the people who had unfairly died during the War, Harry would do it in a heartbeat.
Back at the Slytherin Commons, Draco is unsurprised to see Harry by the central fire. Besides the crackling flames, Harry has activated some low lights around the commons.
“N-no need!” Harry took his own fork and dug into the mont blanc and enjoyed the creamy chestnut cake.
But, it seems to be one of the pains that won’t transfer to Draco—it’s not as though he can transform into a werewolf in their stead.
Draco doesn’t release his grip though, especially not with that roaring feeling in his heart. This is his
Harry looks around them and then focuses back on Draco. “You’re lucky that we’re alone,” he chides. “So. Er.”
Hitchly’s teeth gnash, but under McGonagall’s gaze, he holds his words. Draco inwardly smirks. Maybe he just needs a pet Gryffindor at hand to yap at Aurors.
The tall doors at the other end of the main hall open, and a human and a cluster of goblins stride through. The goblins look as though they’ll like to chain Harry up, but the human though—the figure and their hair colour looks familiar.
“...What the fuck, Potter?” Draco grumbled. His fingers slipped into Harry’s curls and pulled lightly. Shivers of pleasure ran down Harry’s scalp.
As Draco and Harry leave and the tent flap closes behind them, McGonagall and Pomfrey start talking indistinctly.
“Yes, we also have bunk beds,” Michelle answers calmly. “Of course, it’s likely that our tent is better—”
“Don’t mind me, I won’t die overnight,” Draco says. “If I do, you can have everything.” He lowers his voice, adding only for Pansy, “If we had those communication devices, this wouldn’t be a problem.”
Harry follows the other Eighth Year Slytherins to their dorm room. Harry uses one of the bathrooms after Pansy.
. That all those lunches was one of your Gryffindork schemes to have a date with me. Of course, you weren’t
Jone narrows his eyes. “Chocolate is my favourite too.” He looks disdainfully at Gryffindor Hedge. “You didn’t need to take
“Fuck you, bringing some friends along?” Greyback snarls when he notices Pansy and Blaise behind him.
But it was clear that he hadn’t. If anything, Harry’s current appearance gave Draco the intense urge to hold him in the palm of his hands, instead of slapping him with the palm of his hands.
“Malfoy!” Potter accuses Draco the next day after breakfast. He catches Draco right outside the Great Hall, along with Pansy, Blaise, and a group of third year students ready to head to their morning class.
Draco shakes his head. “No, push the papers to print more articles similar to this second one. Make them remember the Ministry’s failings.”
McGonagall looks at the public. “The photos are true. But the students' classes continue, and too many people will be disruptive. There will be no unauthorised entry.”
Harry wrote a quick affirmative reply, as well as instructions to reach his home, and sent Negesydd off again. “You can rest after this, I promise.”
Draco doesn’t deign him a response. If they’re dragonlings, that would make Draco the father. How could he be the father of so many children??
On Sunday morning, Slytherins coming down to the Commons for breakfast will find Pansy reclining on the Eighth Years’ throne sofa, tea and pastry on the coffee table, newspapers and magazines in hand, and her lips curled up in a smirk.
Jamie Ottley tries not to fidget. He’s sitting next to Michelle, true, but all the other second year students from all the houses are here in this makeshift classroom too.
, Draco takes out a large picnic blanket and spreads it on the ground before sitting down. Harry gratefully sits down next to him.
were the one who leaked the Greyback investigation? Of course, it was negligence on the Greyback-investigative team that such a sensitive report came into your hands, so
“Good?” Blaise says, after he finishes coordinating the house-elves in positioning the large—still living—fir tree by the side of the room.
“Ron, Hermione, hello. Parvati and Padma, long time no see. Thank you for coming! Dennis, hello,” Harry greets everyone in turn.
In the nest of blankets in the Forbidden Forest, under the full moon, Harry curls up under Draco's arm... Unfortunately, Harry hasn't had the opportunity to set a time to be alone with Draco and show off Those Items, but Harry is ready to play the long game! Just...after he wakes up...so cosy and warm....zzzzzzzzzz
The problem of Aegis is not something Draco cares about. He already did the hard work of capturing them when the Ministry was unable to.
boyfriend!” Harry protested. “If you’re hungry, we have some small snacks in the kitchen.” Harry nudged his friends to the kitchen.
Draco’s lips curve up as Pansy squabbles with Madame Pomfrey. Blaise appears behind her, and with him talking, they quickly gain admittance into the Hospital Wing.
about encouragement,” Draco says coolly. “It’s more about the effective use of class time. Sitting in class in a disruptive environment is wasteful for everyone involved. Rest assured that the Slytherins will hand in their assignments on time.”
There is a brief flash of bitterness on Alice’s face. “At least there’s no Mary talking horribly about werewolves. As if we
Who can’t see that he has been excluded from the other professors who are the Head of a House? In that case, it’s better to turn the story in his favour.
Narcissa and Molly and Minerva greet the guests by the gates of Hogwarts: only those with invitations are allowed to enter. Those without invitations can only buy one-time-only wedding commemorative items Pansy has on sale, including a silver dragon and golden stag joint toy set, and wait for the future news articles written by selected journalists. Lee Jordan is one of them, Luna Lovegood being another. With them, Pansy and Narcissa don’t need to
Then, on Christmas morning when Draco and Harry and the others come down to the room with the big Christmas tree, they find all the older adults waiting, including Narcissa and Lucius.
“I’m perfectly well,” Draco tells the Slytherin kids. “The rumours were much exaggerated, and you are all underestimating me if you think a fall in class will incapacitate me.”
“Even if you sacrificed yourself and allowed us to use your lifeblood, it will still not be enough to save Hogwarts,” Draco says, eyes narrowed as though he suspects Harry was planning to do just that.
Blaise pats the wall one last time, for now, and climbs into bed too, on Draco’s opposite side. “Very lovely of you to join us, Harry.”
“A moment, Weasley,” Draco says, suppressing down the mocking tone. He taps his wand on the table, requesting the house-elves to bring some dishes from the Gryffindor table for Weasley. The dishes appear a moment later: common foods like mashed potatoes and roast chicken.
“This is the overall design that I have created. It is important not only to consider structural issues, but also whether a particular castle format is comfortable for
The disappointed and annoyed look in her eyes when she glances at him is not “as old times” though. It’s been two days since they’d fought, and she’s still disappointed in him, even though he told her that Draco really did teach him a little magical control.
Potter steps gingerly to Draco’s side. Draco gives him Garren’s wand, and Potter then passes it back to Garren.
Professor Garren can barely suppress his emotions, especially under the gazes of the people on the Ministry team. But he doesn’t say anything.
“Not your ex-Gryffindor? I think Pansy’s right, this Head-of-Slytherin business has gotten into your head.”
“Don’t be disobedient!” a young voice says. It’s not Draco. It’s Nolan, who’s walking up to them whilst scowling at Potter. Behind him are Jamie and Michelle.
spread what has happened. This matter is extremely unclear. The Professors and I will investigate whether the Slytherin banner falling has any implications on the Houses, or whether Hogwarts simply needs a maintenance check.
“Hm, I still have my Charms assignment,” Draco agrees. He nudges Harry out of the room ahead of him.
The first night Nolan had transformed back at Hogwarts, he had wanted to bite the muggleborn werewolves, but annoyingly, fifth year Slytherin werewolf Martin Gamp had stopped him, picking him up by the scruff of his neck and dragging him away.
But with the unstoppable Wizengamot Bill, Blaise prefers to take the lead, and hence allowed Draco’s action. Since the rest of Hogwarts and Britain wanted it, they deserve to feel and suffer the reality of a separated Slytherin.
To the naked eye, it looks as pristine as usual—she definitely had not noticed anything odd here last time she patrolled this area.
“Nolan,” Draco greets. “We saw each other at breakfast.” He rubs Nolan’s head. “Thank you for your work on the castle. You helped us pass.”
Draco has already helped the younger students before dinner: it’s best to teach them before they completely relax after eating. Now that it’s after dinner, the students in the laboratory are the older students, most of whom don’t require any instruction.
“Not as bad,” Draco comments, fingers running a light refreshing charm on his hair. His shirt is clinging to him due to sweat and an
“Give it to me.” Narcissa takes out a memory vial from inside her sleeve, where her storage is hidden.
Harry pulls one hand from behind his back, and presents Malfoy with a bouquet of acacia flowers. “These are for you.”
Draco hissed. “Good boy. You want us to come inside of you, don’t you? You want all our come, don’t you?”
Ron jolts. “Yeah, of course. Turns out you’re bi, huh...If you tell Mum, she might set you up with a guy.”
—unless you use Legilimency or Veritaserum on me. Professor...Sometimes, people deserve to get hurt. This is
Turning away, she summons a house-elf to fetch Professor Flitwick. While she waits for him to come, she gathers all the hurt Gryffindors together, wrapping them up with ropes.
Draco declines the use of the tents provided by McGonagall. After Pansy doesn’t allow him to use the Malfoy tent, Blaise offers some of his family’s wizarding tents for use. They set them up in a cluster, with the main one as the common area and the smaller ones as either study areas or sleeping areas.
Flitwick inclines his head. “Prior to the fall of Hogwarts, the students have been able to record the original layout of the various Hogwarts rooms.” He levitates a file containing a copy of the blueprints to Griffiths. “I believe this will be a great aid to the rebuilding.”
Hogwarts calls in the New Year with fireworks out on the front lawns, and then all students are quickly ushered back to bed. (Harry, after Christmas, has returned to his singular bed.)
When Draco wakes up the next morning, he brushes back Harry’s hair with his fingers. He can feel that Harry’s magic has settled back overnight.
“Classwork is proceeding smoothly,” Draco says, the corner of his lips curling slightly in a smirk. “We have been assisting Harry, I believe his grades will also go up.”
Hedge grins. He grabs Jones’ paper and does exactly that, drawing out sofas with his wand on the paper.
“Richard, how are your classes going? I know that Potions has been most affected by all this business.”
, Draco growls at it. He throws his own magic out like a net, like sharp, digging claws that pulls the magic back, slowing its descent. Not all of it should return, either. Some of it is Draco’s magic, some of it is the magic of the badges, some of it is
, but the news was big enough that some of the other Gryffindors shared alternative papers that they read.
“Forget them,” a Hufflepuff says. “Look, the Hufflepuff part still looks alright! Why can’t we go and check?!”
“Oh, I’m a part of this too,” Harry says unrepentantly, glaring down Hitchly next. “From what I understand, Professor Garren unfortunately was both the provoker,
been to Hogsmeade unless absolutely necessary, and Draco has not been to Hogesmeade at all. It’s much safer to buy via owl-order or by proxy through a house-elf.
The complete results are shown in the table below. There is some randomness in the predictions each time it is run, so I picked the ones with the best f1 measure from a handful of runs (very imprecise, I know. Glad this isn’t an official paper!).
weren’t personally affected by the actions of the Slytherins. Yes, fighting now is wrong, but getting angry isn’t going to solve it.”
Felicity and a sixth year accompany Harry to the Great Hall, where Harry has messaged Hermione and Ron via patronus to meet up.
The next morning, Draco arises early as usual. A feeling of unease passes through him when a barn owl comes flying into the Eighth Year dorm room.
“Oh, Blaise,” Hannah returns the smile. “This is Maira and Kim. If you can let them stay in Slytherin for the time being…”
Grunting, Draco squeezes his eyes shut and forces the reverse transformation. The world shrinks, and he feels tiny...and
The air around McGonagall becomes much heavier. “Oh, then you wanted to destroy the school property instead? How did you get in? You certainly didn’t pass through the front gates.”
Malfoy slowly looks at him. Steps closer. Then closer again. Stops. “You never planned to decorate anything.”
Harry shyly wrapped his hand around Draco’s cock. It was the first time he had touched another man’s cock. It felt large and heavy in his hand. How would it feel in his mouth? Was it...too big to fit? Would it feel good stretching out his body?
Headmistress McGonagall, an expert consultant against the bill, stares at the Wizengamot members with cold eyes as various witches and wizards raise their hands.
“Blaise, just tell us what we need to do,” Harry says, taking initiative as the one out of the three who knows Blaise the most. Blaise is
Parkinson pops up out of nowhere, wrapping an arm around Harry’s and Malfoy’s necks. “Very good. Draco’s blonder than Lovegood, anyway.”
Pansy eventually wakes up at a more reasonable time. After her morning routine, she heads downstairs for breakfast, nudging Blaise aside so that she can sit next to Draco, with Harry on the opposite side.
Draco’s lips curved indulgently, while Harry lowered his head and bustled about, trying to extend the time before getting into bed.
Draco ended up having a shouting match with his father. They may have broken some furniture, and they may have bonded, just a little, at fixing said furniture together. They weren’t friends, not by a long shot, but Draco left feeling that he no longer needed to avoid his father at all costs.
Shacklebolt nods. “Good, I’ll be in contact with you in the future, okay?” It sounds like he’s treating Harry as a young child, which Draco does
“Defeatist,” Liam Hedge replies equally disdainfully. He and the other second year Gryffindors all leave to go meet up with all the other second years.
He pulls Draco to sit with him on the Eighth Year throne sofa and takes out the Slytherin blueprints—plans which they can finally start to implement.
It’s late Thursday night by the time Draco finishes helping the first years with all their other assignments that will be sent to the relevant professors on Friday morning. He shoos them all to bed—even if they’re only attending two classes, they need to keep a good sleep schedule.
Draco accepts the pictures. In them, a big dangerous looking dragon playing with small Hogwarts students.
Draco rolls his eyes. Is Potter really that surprised about the Sectumsempra scars on his chest? Or the faded Dark Mark on his arm? He summons one of his robes; the buttons down the center front do themselves up, but Potter keeps staring. Draco inwardly shrugs. Maybe Potter’ll learn something about fashion.
Draco reaches out and grabs Harry, causing him to topple on top of him. Harry bursts out laughing, and Draco can’t help but laugh too, despite his hardest attempts at keeping a calm and collected face.
Madam Pomfrey leaves. Once he’s sure she can no longer see him, Draco strides into the Forbidden Forest.
The other students—Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs, Gryffindors—seem confused when Harry starts handing each of them a gift as well, calling them by name.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Patience is a virtue,” he quoted. He crawled over Draco’s legs, positioning himself in prime cock-sucking position. He wet his lips, and tugged down the joggers off Draco’s unfairly attractive hips.
Just a while ago, they had all joined into a big game of transfer chess with as many chess boards as they could obtain, where killed pieces were handed to the next player along to place on their board. However, it eventually dissolved into defeat for everyone when chess pieces from different sets didn’t want to join the next team.
Wedding guests who do successfully pass the gates then walk up the pathway towards the castle gardens. Silver and gold adorn the pavilions and trees, and flowers are even more abundant than during Draco and Harry’s Valentines date years ago. Neville Longbottom has outdone himself.
“And none of them were Greyback,” Harry says crossly. “Wasn’t he down at Diagon Alley? How could he also be all the way up at Hogwarts? Can he apparate across the entire country in werewolf form? How many people can even do that? If you think
Just as the entrance is about to close, Draco looks over his shoulder and says, “If you care so much about your sister, why don’t you come to Slytherin and support her?”
“Dennis,” Harry says warningly. It first, nothing happens. But then something starts tugging at him. Like it’s trying to pull something out of Harry’s throat. Harry’s breath quickens. “
In the hubbub of noise as other students pack up and begin to leave, Potter leans in closer and whispers, “I was almost sorted into Slytherin.”
*meanwhile, in an alternate universe where Harry has a higher EQ (emotional intelligence) maybe (???)*
She meets the gaze of an older Gryffindor boy across the room. Both of them grimace as they head to the door.
The readers wanted reactions, so I gave reactions. Hence the head-hopping. Um, I also labelled the Ministry officials by number because they're not that important…
Vaisey slings an arm over Potter’s shoulder. “It’s a shame you didn’t become a Slytherin earlier, you could have been the Slytherin seeker and we could have benched Draco.”
Draco barely glances at the letter. “It’s not simply the students. Some of the professors have also neglected their duties.”
Harry pouts. “No, you’re not allowed, Draco! Schedule it for tomorrow instead, I’ll be fine by then…I mean it. Or else, give me a pepper up and some coffee.”
“How can we ensure our complete safety?” Draco muses out loud. “Unfortunately, I cannot destroy all of our enemies.”
Narcissa and Lucius have caved into accepting their new grandchildren, and Narcissa also delights in writing letters to each of them and getting responses longer than the ones Draco sends her these days. In fact, her own letters to Draco start to get shorter and shorter in response...
A witch and a wizard were in a private office together, bristling with so many privacy charms that it made other Ministry workers skirt warily around the door.
Ron’s eyes widened. “Say, Harry,” he said casually, “Do you mind if we came over for dinner more often? Hermione, don’t look at me like that! They’re both better cooks than us! How about it? I can give you another 5% off any products you want from the Wheezes!”
,” Pansy said, horrified. “Next time, I’m taking you with me to Milan. No, don’t look at me like that, just you, me, and Blaise. Eating ice cream and being horrified at tourists.”
may sit with us, but I will not put Harry under the wands of Gryffindor House who will want to lead a second ‘Knockturn Alley’ riot.”
Draco felt so powerful as Harry’s hole pulled him in deeper. “Love you, love you, love you…Fucking you feels so good.”
At lunch time, Professor McGonagall is absent from the head table. Harry doesn’t like it, but at least Creevey and the others still haven’t been released from the Hospital Wing yet...
of the tower, and you Slytherins are in the basement. Hey, will you go feeding the thestrals again?”
Harry’s outstretched hand curls into a loose fist. “You know I wasn’t fully for it. But...Hogwarts isn’t an independent city state. Even when
“Don’t rest your head like that,” Draco chides, using his other hand to tug Harry’s head back. “Look into the mirror. Look at those eyes that
Harry’s mouth opened as whimpers slipped out. The way Draco moved his body like he owned it, Draco’s large hands on his chest, his sides, his thighs, his cock made Harry’s feel dazed and lightheaded and overwhelmed.
(The Hufflepuff renovations have not proceeded as fast, since their new ground floor room is to be made into an indoor garden, requiring a lot more glass and a lot more charms.)
“Shut the fuck up!” Draco growls. He throws a ball of fire behind him towards the annoying voice, uncaring of where it lands.
Draco couldn’t keep his eyes closed, though. His eyes adjusted to the dim lights, to the outlines of objects. Harry shifted.
All of Hogwarts knows Professor Garren as the new, young Head of Slytherin and Hogwarts Potions Professor. Everyone in Slytherin knows that Garren doesn’t care an inch about them.
Draco rinsed Harry off, and lifted him out of the bathtub. The huge white towel was large enough to wrap Harry up entirely. Harry looked up at him with wide, hazy eyes, smiling—and grouching a little—as Draco vigorously dried him off. He helped Harry into his pyjamas, slipped Harry’s glasses back on. They brushed their teeth together, and Draco led him by the hand back to their bedroom.
Harry reaches up and grabs Draco’s hand. “I’m still angry with you, Malfoy. Don’t think that calling me sweet will get you off the hook.”
But Draco is still awake, feeling a sense of crisis. He originally had a plan, but with how excited Harry is, and with Ginerva’s provocation earlier, lunch in the rose gardens of Hogwarts (and its ruins) with magical warm sunshine is no longer good enough.
Draco selects a set of pale blue robes and goes to wake Pansy up. In the process, Harry also wakes up.
Harry stuffs a pastry in his mouth. “Hm, I don’t care who did it. The important thing is that the Aurors can now spend time on
Later, when lunch arrives, Blaise and the second years help the house-elves set up tables and chairs outside, followed by the food. At the same time, Hagrid leads the feeding of the thestrals.
On Wednesday morning, Draco gets a shock when Lovegood and Ginevra Weasley come to the Slytherin table.
A huge urge rose in Draco’s chest to bite his lip for him. And so he did, kissing his future-husband very thoroughly until Harry was left dazed, lips red.
Hogwarts’ tremors. He can hear how those Ministry Officials are arguing in full earshot of Hogwarts.
Inside, there are several early risers already awake, either studying or having breakfast. Draco decides to get some work done. Harry dithers, but eventually decides to accompany him. They both smile shyly at each other as they take a seat at the same table in the mezzanine library.
McGonagall assesses the student in front of her calmly. Indeed, these items would have destroyed part of the rebuilt Hogwarts by severing parts of the magical weave.
Harry’s apparation landed him in Hermione and Ron’s home in the suburbs. Both of them were out at work, so Harry left the potions case on Hermione’s home study desk and then apparated back to Number Twelve Grimmauld Place.
At the same time, her chest feels hot and cold. Could it really be that her son is a homosexual? Could it really be that her son is currently entangled with Potter?
“Don’t be so maudlin, Harry,” Draco says lightly. “With all the students and professors in Hogwarts, how could it not be enough?”
place, the place where he suffered through Snape’s useless Occlumency lessons. The place where Snape invaded Harry’s mind, again and again.
Harry’s legs tighten around Draco’s hips. “Uh-huh,” he says affirmatively. He grins and lands a completely failed kiss on Draco’s cheek.
The fifth years trudge up to their dorms, leaving the Slytherin Commons empty but for an insomniac third year. Draco has a quiet word with them, but all they want is a hot chocolate, which Draco provides. With that, he heads up to his own bed.
going to cast a hex?” Draco throws the wand back, making the Gryffindor scramble forward for it. Ignoring their reply, he turns to Gardiner.
“Take a break,” Flitwick says. “I believe the students have a plan and will lead the way. After all, they are our future.”
Draco looks over the other students. He has learnt their names along the walk. How curious that all the werewolf students have chosen to stay behind at Hogwarts over the Winter Break.
Hagrid smiles broadly, wrapping Harry in a hug. “Of course! Today, we have a full schedule! Good afternoon, good afternoon, everyone!”
on everything and ushers Aster Grace out of the corridor and into the safety of the office. “What is it? Has something happened?”
the sound of his heart or the sound of the pounding footsteps of the crowd coming closer and closer?
“At least they delivered themselves to our doorstep,” Draco says. “Even if that wasn’t the entirety of the Aegis team, anyone left certainly won’t be rushing out.”
Ron, who has been swinging his gaze back and forth, blinks in surprise. “I don’t know. You hear about the old pureblood houses being nasty—though it’s not clear if the houses themselves are nasty or the people inside them have rigged up curses,” he quickly adds under Hermione’s glare.
against falling. Even if someone pushed Aster, the charms would have cushioned them before it got this far.
Harry tightens his arms. “No escaping.” He clenches down, smirks when Draco’s hips stutter a little.
Harry clears his throat. “Yes, everyone! Come to the place outside the Slytherin Building tonight for dinner! There will be food under the stars, games and attempted karaoke!”
“Last year was hell for almost everyone. It was bad for us too. But I know it was worse for you.” Aster struggles to take a breath, to get past the lump in their throat. “I’m sorry,” they say.
“Whatever engagements you have planned for me, I cannot follow. There is already someone in my future.”
Draco reclined behind him. With a twist of well-practised magic, lube coated his fingers. He reached towards that crevice between two soft mounds and rubbed Harry’s little bud.
“Please, help yourself and eat,” Draco said. With a wave of his wand, he also poured a drink for everyone.
Now he needs to think of an excuse that isn’t the truth. Potter’s laugh catches Draco’s attention. The corner of Draco’s lip curls up. Potter’s never going to meet his mother, so it’s no problem if Draco writes as follows:
warmer—there is the tell-tale sense of Draco’s magic. Quiet classical music builds up in the background.
“Under parole,” Flitwick says. “I understand you have restrictions on your wand. But shield charms are permitted.”
Dinner in the Slytherin Commons is a subdued affair, and everyone is feeling the strain when homework time comes around.
“...Or how about food? I learnt a trick from Ron to summon food from the Kitchens! I don’t know if it would work this far away, but I can try.”
Hogwarts is brightly lit in the sun, and the skies are blue with the occasional wispy white cloud. Exams are over. Results are back for the internal exams; as for the OWLs and NEWTs exams, the students will have to wait another two weeks.
Saturday morning opens with thick white snow that glitters outside Hogwarts’ windows. Many Slytherins look through the charmed window in the Commons with wistful eyes as they eat breakfast in the Commons.
Harry’s heart starts to thud in his chest. There’s exactly a week before Valentine’s. Maybe...maybe...He turns to Draco.
, it’s her son. While she can understand that this kind of messaging counteracts the atmosphere of fear that the
The sun was down, and the night quiet. Draco was relaxed, smiling openly, fondly at Harry lying across from him.
Harry, of course, softens. “Dennis...I’m sorry about your brother. I really am. I wish he was still alive...Your brother was a good wizard.”
In the evening after classes, Draco checks that each person has their protective badge before allowing them to re-enter Slytherin.
Hitchly gives him a scornful look. “Very well then.” He turns to the other Aurors. “Take Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy to the Ministry cells.”
“Not this again!” Pansy scoffed. “Do I have to tell you everything again? Fine, you’re right, you need to take responsibility, but you can’t run away like this.” She flicked Draco’s forehead, ignoring his look of pain. “It won’t work, and you
—and Draco returns them in kind about all the bullying and bigotry—Harry starts loving them too, and starts resting his head on Draco’s chest to listen to his heart whenever he can.)
“You smell good,” Harry blurted out. “Luna said that scent compatibility is really important for a good love life.”
Draco turns to Blaise, who is awake but has kept his eyes closed. “Blaise, we’ll entrust you with everything.”
ALSO did you know that a friend of mine wrote a F/F original short story for me? It involves transmigration into Ancient Times,
blood? Surely you would need a constant infusion of it…” She reads something from Draco’s expression. “...Or maybe not. Give me the details. I won’t tell anyone. You
But for all the hustle and bustle, Draco is not entirely sure who will come. He did not expect Lovegood and her girlfriend Weasley to be the first.
Ducking into the cool Forbidden Forest, Draco makes sure that no one is watching, and transforms. The magic that pushes and crashes under his human skin expands and fills the large dragon form.
, he takes out his own assignments to do. He’s not the only one—there are some other upper years seated around the study area in the Slytherin Commons.
The Slytherin Building entrance opens as they approach, spilling light. Jamie jumps out. “Mr Malfoy! Mr Potter! I saved some cookies for you!”
In Slytherin, the first day of internal classes starts with group study sessions as Draco, Pansy and Blaise plan out the new timetables for everyone in Slytherin. Students skim through the school curriculum and the content required for end-of-year examinations, taking the opportunity to revise, read ahead, or work on assignments that Draco intends to have marked, one way or another. The students in charge of teaching gather old class notes and other papers previously provided by Professor Flitwick.
Draco growls, pushing Harry against the glass. Harry lets out a breathy moan. With a wave of Draco’s hand, Harry’s robes parts, revealing flushed-red cheeks. Draco toys with the plug with one hand, plastering his front to Harry’s back. Harry’s hips make tiny motions, and Merlin, it’s so fucking
“I have tea, if you want,” Michelle offers, pulling out the charmed flask from her backpack. The flask looks small, but there is a lot more inside. “It’s sweetened chrysanthemum tea.”
“Hey, Malfoy,” the goblin says. “Kraker tells you to stop taking the carts so fast or she’ll string your guts up.”
“Wizarding Britain is not a big place. I likely know them,” Draco says coldly. “Granger, let go of Harry.”
McGonagall rubs her temples in defeat. “Your schooling will still continue, of course. Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and Hagrid have agreed to teach separate lessons for you, and Professor Vector is willing to provide some of her class notes.”
Filch’s grimace deepens. “It’s almost curfew.” He casts a distrustful look at Draco, and a look of distaste at Mrs Norris in Draco’s arms.
Harry’s heart jumps in shock when Zabini’s voice comes out from his Slytherin badge. Harry immediately looks over to the Slytherin table, where indeed, the other Slytherin students are finishing up.
“I need to convert some of this into muggle money too,” Harry says offhandedly as he clambers back into the cart.
“...We’ll see you later then,” Hermione finally says. “If you have time on Wednesday or something to see us…”
For now, the Slytherins are in high spirits, filled with determination to study and overwhelm the other houses.
has created, she doesn’t like seeing Draco carry students like a pack animal, acting weak and docile.
Emotionally and/or physically exhausted inhabitants of Slytherin House drag themselves to bed early. However, Draco takes Harry’s hand and the two of them slip out into the night.
Draco huffs at the lost kiss and summons his broom. A second later, he flies out the window, eyes narrowed towards Harry Potter’s bottom on that broomstick.
What Skeeter sees makes her eyes go wide. This is the biggest scoop since the war ended! And now McGonagall is saying that she
Narcissa releases Draco. “Minerva, Auror Inkwood, thank you for allowing me to see my son, and Minerva, thank you for allowing us to speak in your office.”
that he’s an upright wizard these days, that he worked to improve Ministry laws promoting equality and equity and fairness...but one wouldn’t want to get on his
Draco smoothly hands over his wand. Under Hitchly’s prodding, the recent spells casted by the wand comes out. There is absolutely nothing incriminating.
about Harry’s favourite things, which his friends delight in taking. Hermione knows him best, apparently.)
Harry’s chest is brimming with adrenalin as Draco swerves and swoops and loop-de-loops over white clouds and under blue sky. These are all manoeuvres that Harry can do, but it’s a completely different experience when he’s not the one in control. All he can do is trust that Draco will keep him on his back.
“They must consider their personal situation,” Draco says quietly. “If they show camaraderie to Slytherins so blatantly after Greyback’s attack, they may well be targeted in their House.”
, Harry thinks. Is Malfoy a manager? A lawyer? An errand boy? And why the fuck do the goblins like Malfoy more than Harry?
Harry opened his eyes again, dazed. He blinked at Draco, whose face was so close that he didn’t look blurry.
“If worse comes to worst, I’ll step forward,” Harry says slowly. “Who's to say that I didn’t polyjuice into you before catching Greyback?”
“Harry, I think you should go outside and meet new people. You can’t stay cooped up in Grimmauld Place and draw all day!”
have a way with sentient castles, don’t I?” Blaise says, turning a smile to Hogwarts castle. He lowers his voice. “I may have a little world tour visiting other sentient castles. There are a couple that like to mess with visitors. What interesting stories those castles must have.” Unlike Blaise’s usual coolness and apathy, there is now a thread of interest in his voice.
Harry shakes off his thoughts and puts down his losing hand of Snap cards. “Yeah, that’ll be great.” He gets up and heads over to Ginny first, not seeing the troubled look that Hermione and Ron share.
They lapse into an awkward silence. Draco sticks to watching Hogwarts castle grow larger and larger as they approach it. He can feel Potter’s glances at him, but he doesn’t look back. He’s above such sneaking looks. If
spend most of the night awake, forcing many editors and journalists doing the same thing. She deserves to have a morning nap.
Draco summons his broom and flies swiftly into the Forest. Transforming into a dragon lets him breathe easily again as some excess magic is consumed in the transformation.
The tension in Harry's chest eased the moment he emerged from the Floo at Grimmauld Place. Draco was already there, as usual, one leg elegantly crossed over the other. He was casually reading a book, a really thick book, whilst wearing delicate silver framed reading glasses.
“Indeed.” Draco glances over, making a quick head-count of the second and first years. Smiling wryly at their sleep-rumpled appearances and bright excited eyes, Draco waves a hand of permission.
Draco’s body entrapped Harry. Harry nodded and reflexively closed his eyes as Draco’s fingers trailed down. A thumb rubbed against Harry’s perineum. A small spell penetrated Harry. Harry’s hole clenched down at the unfamiliar sensation.
Draco cuts a look at him, a twist of concern in his chest. This is the second time in recent memory that Harry’s magic has slipped.
Because of that, the start of the Quidditch match is quiet… until the young Hufflepuff named Kim in the Slytherin stands starts to cheer for Ravenclaw. Kim’s friend, Maira, feels the need to cheer for Slytherin—the House of her big brother—quietly. The other young Slytherins have good affection for these two, and they start cheering for Slytherin and Ravenclaw in an alternating fashion.
“Why are you two still here? Go have dinner.” McGonagall appears at the top of the staircase, descending down towards them.
. It only becomes that once you cast a spell. Either Creevey is malicious, or he’s a tool. Regardless—”
Blaise turns to Professor Sprout. “Professor, we believe that someone has tampered with the staircase. I will personally take Draco and Aster to the Hospital Wing. Can I inconvenience you to section off the staircase and investigate their integrity?”
, there was one patient who had stuck a pencil up his cock. He certainly went red when I informed him he could owl-order proper sounding rods.” A smirk hovered over the corner of Draco’s lips. “Made me think about you.”
“The ex-Death Eater Fenrir Greyback is still at large,” Draco says gravely. “It is very possible that he will come here. Do not let him. Kill him at will, or send another creature to kill him.”
Draco had never been, and once Harry learnt that, he all but dragged Draco out. They had been walking barely a few minutes before the sky went dim, and a park ranger came round shooing everyone out of the park so that they could lock up.
The others looked at the two of them outpouring affection and couldn’t help but feel sour. Those who had partners immediately latched onto their said partners, and those who didn’t wanted to desperately find somewhere else to be. Seriously, get a room!
“Draco,” Pansy growls, “I hope you realise this means we can’t have you accompany the lower years anymore! You’re a walking spell target now!”
Malfoy raps him on the head. “Hello, any Potter in here? I sincerely hope you’ll be able to focus in class.”
how much you want their fingers.” Draco strokes Harry’s insides, drawing moans and shuddering gasps.
Harry grins. “I knew I won you over. Welcome to the Harry Potter fan club.” He takes the badge and pins it immediately on his Weasley jumper.
Later that morning, when they head to the Great Hall for breakfast, McGonagall is waiting for Draco.
Creevey glares at Draco before turning back innocent eyes at Harry. “You don’t understand,” he says, voice lowering. Of course, Draco can hear perfectly clearly. “The Ministry is still
“Indeed, I will be the better man and concede that these...trousers, if we must call them, have their uses.” Draco tilted his head back. “I never knew you had such a kink for me in your clothing.”
he seems to say. When he sees Draco’s robes, his jaw tightens, lips tugging into a slight sneer. Draco returns his look blandly, not reacting to Portrait Severus’s narrowing eyes. The real Severus would have been much more scathing.
Malfoy gives a slow, fond smile. “Good boy, Harry.” Malfoy’s fingers circle Harry’s rim, light, then firm. A protection spell tingles, and Malfoy’s fingers push in, long and deep.
Madame Pomfrey sighs shortly. “Very well. Everyone, drink up your healing potion and hurry back to your dorms.”
Warm fires burn merrily in the various fireplaces in Slytherin Commons. While most Slytherins relax after dinner, and Potter is off playing games with the younger Slytherins, Draco is drafting a letter to his mother.
As for their other classes…. The History of Magic Professor Binns is hardly aware of anything. While the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor is not antagonistic, the nature of practicals makes it too easy to “accidentally” hurt someone; Astronomy happens mostly in the dark. And the new Transfiguration professor—
Narcissa reads the entire article once, then twice, narrowing her eyes at the photo provided. She is sure that they are not holding hands, but that the angle has created this lie. She knows that her son has been working in tandem with Potter over the matter of Slytherin and Hogwarts, even though Potter should have stayed in Gryffindor where he belongs.
“Ms Green, I strongly suggest you return,” Madame Pomfrey says. “The Forbidden Forest is no place for a student.”
In his home, suspended-Auror Michael Hitchly glares at the papers. Not that he’s too worried. McGonagall had failed to counter the first bill, and now that she’s joined hands with that Narcissa
in his brain can stay sane!...Hey, you! Don’t you have a sister or brother in Slytherin? We need to keep an eye on you…”
“It’s true,” Blaise says mildly. “That said, it’s very late, or very early. Everyone, go back to bed. You
Pansy and Felicity end up taking the rest of Slytherin back to the Dungeons first, while Draco and Blaise remain behind with the Golden Trio.
Draco pats multiple students in amusement, while Potter’s cheeks go red as he laughs. Pansy smirks at the sweet little innocent student who’s a bit scared to hug her.
He grabs onto Blaise for support—the pain in his arm to hold onto Blaise is minor compared to the pain in his leg. The dragon expands under his skin.
Irritation grows on the Ravenclaw boy’s face as he recognises the spell. “Wouldn’t you be carted back to Azkaban for hurting us?” he scowls.
Blaise escorts the third year Slytherins away to their first class. Draco, resigning to his fate during this free study period, sets a brisk pace to Hagrid’s Hut.
Felicity Shafiq smiles. “Thank you, we’re very grateful for your help. We will trouble you to come down to the Slytherin Dungeons to pick up the students.”
And the particularly gossipy portraits gossip to the living inhabitants of the castle. By Sunday afternoon, the news has reached the Headmistress of Hogwarts.
Draco turns to the handful of Slytherins who also came out to see off their friends. Most of them are ready to return to the Castle...except for Potter.
Draco Malfoy turns around to face the Hall in a swirl of glittery robes. “I, Draco Lucius Narcissa Malfoy, Head of Slytherin, hereby declare that Slytherin House will stand on its own, and its prior allyship with Houses of Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff are now dissolved.”
