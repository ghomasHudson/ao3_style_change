Pansy leans down and picks up his wand and stuffs it into her pocket, before taking out her own wand and writing a message with a flame-tipped wand on a tree nearby. she must have used non-verbal magic.
r we really going back to petty name calling?
And idk why but I gave Blaise the nickname B
"Ahh... hi," Theo said slowly.
did you want voldemort to win?
"Can you, ah, help me find him?" I ask awkwardly.
Theodore's POV
They'd played together, her fetching sticks, him throwing them, racing with her along the fence line together. He'd taken her back to the manor to show his father, but Lucius hadn't taken to her well, he disliked the mess that Draco was covered in, he disliked the dog, and with a quick flick of his wand, a green flash the dog lay still. Draco didn't understand, he started crying, Lucius slapped him and told him that 'Malfoy's don't cry' and had then dragged him to the basement. He even told a house elf on the way to dispose of the trash by the back door, Lucius then locked Draco in the basement, in total darkness Draco had been terrified, he'd curled up in a ball and cried, and eventually fallen asleep on the cold stone.
same, i wonder how he planned this whole idea before his death, hmmm
I open the library door and make my way to the back of the library, Draco is sitting by the window, looking outside.
We eat and chat for around half an hour before I realise my left leg has pins and needles.
we dont have time, i dont think Draco will last that long
you hav silver-grey eyes...
Draco fell to the leaf-strewn ground in a heap, his wand falling from his grasp, he'd only just been able to take in out of his pocket before the spell stuck him.
"it's fine, I wasn't enjoying sleeping anyway, as I'm sure was quite obvious," Neville said jokingly, "Why don't you stay? keep me company?"
we never do anything together, like:
i didn't say that
Maybe there is something to this whole "helping thing"
"I can try to teach you?" I hope this will make him happy and get rid of his green pallor.
riiiight, absolutely correct
sure ur not ;)
ahhh, gay then?
do u want a meet up sometime today? and work on potions and DADA together?
not right now, maybe some other time? i just want to talk
"I know I should have told you... me and umm.. a guy have been dating for a month, and well, he had a girlfriend, he kept assuring me..." he paused, his eyes looked away sadly before he continued.
like he was forced into the bad side and u were forced into the good side
When the dream had started, Draco was a child only six years old, innocent and playful. He was running around Malfoy Manor, he'd been playing with a stray dog that had wandered over from some unknown place. He had been laughing, his hair full of grass and dirt from being knocked over by the dog. The dog was a female, with matted white and black fur, a border collie with one blue eye and one brown.
"Are you cold? I'm cold, what's the temperature in here?" Draco said breaking the brief silence between them.
The picnic is set up around the middle of the pitch, which means I'm standing here awkwardly waiting. I can't sit down because that would be rude, I think, so instead, I'm just standing here.
no, anyway...
"Is there something on my face?" I ask worriedly, maybe there's some treacle tart on my chin, left over from when I got some snacks in the kitchen.
As that death eater dies I hear a noise and with dread I let my gaze fall to a spot behind the men I'm fighting. Three more figures in dark cloaks and horrible masks stand behind them.
y do'ya think dumbledore gave the 4th to 8th years a random pair to chat with?
Harry? can we talk pls?
_________________
"You're adorable, and yes I suppose we should continue our search." Ginny smiled then felt a little guilty. Harry, Draco and Blaise were all in danger and what was she doing? confessing to her crush...
"Come on let's go search his room to see if there's anything strange there," Pansy says.
"The thing is... I can't cast a potronus," he says his face going mildly green for some reason.
the looked around casting a few spells here and there but found nothing then a Hermione's silver Patronus appeared before them and spoke with Hermione's voice;
when i was seven, i was a good way to get away from the Manor
"What was that?" whispers Ron suddenly.
even if you mess up stupidly Draco wouldn't care
i thought i knew him, then there turned out to be so much more
"what happened," I knew I probably wasn't much better, I knew Harry hadn't meant to make me think of the reasons as to why I wasn't able to cast a Patronus, the simple explanation was obvious, I had never had a happy enough memory, however, there was more to it.
Blaise didn't answer but his grip tightened around Draco's wrist. Draco stood still and fought back against Blaise.
3rd person POV
"No shit Sherlock," Pansy says not letting her gaze move from being focused on Blaise, "If he breaks free, use it as a distraction to try and attack, ok?"
___________________
HERMIONE!
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise stands a few metres from the mess. His eyes blank, focusing on nothing. Pansy is trying desperately to figure out a way to get to Blaise and Draco without any of us being killed.
*I don't know why but I decided to give Blaise the nickname B, :)*
"Hey, Draco," she says without turning to look at me.
"Why don't we play 20 questions? it a game where we ask each other questions so we can get to know each other, okay?"
Draco blinked and his eyes softened, he pecked Harry's nose softly before he too, fell asleep.
Now, as he’s watching the stars blink out, he realizes time has always been feeble, has always been relative. Has never meant anything, not really. He’s 27 and had lived three times as much as most people thrice his age have.
A single lonely star flickers in the night sky.
“Does it hurt?” Harry hears the fear in the question. He lifts his head from where it was resting on Draco’s shoulder, and their eyes meet. A million memories pass between them with just that one look.
Draco runs his hand over the lightning starting on Harry’s forehead, all the way down to his left cheekbone, pressing soft kisses where his hands have been. He runs his hand over his chest, right where Harry’s heart is, where there’s more lightning. He brushes over the back of his hand, Umbridge’s reminder still carved in there.
And much later, walking in to love for once, instead of falling, falling, falling. Forgiveness, gentleness, and the genuine belief in a kinder tomorrow. A little family of two, built on foundations of peace and love. A house where the doors no longer slam, where curses are no longer thrown, where it’s warm, and light, and easy.
“I’ve had enough of that for a lifetime. All I want is you.”
But then he became a teenager and realized he didn’t have anything near enough time. Not enough time to do his homework, to go to his classes, to feel wat friendship is like,  to fall in love. Not enough time to be an idiot, an arsehole, a teenager. Not enough time to figure out what they were supposed to do that dreadful year in the woods. Not enough time to save Sirius. Or Remus, or Tonks, or Fred, or Dobby, or Lavender, or Colin Creevey, who had looked so small in death.
The world fades to black.
This time, there is a desolate knowingness that he will not come back.
Fights, genuine apologies, rebuilding.
This time, he isn’t alone.
“Fire and lightning and curses all over the place, huh? Zeus coming down from the heavens?” Harry asks. He can heart the faintest hint of a smile in Draco’s voice when he replies,
A quarter of the stars has gone out already.
Somewhere far away a siren starts to go off and Harry realizes he’s left his wand inside. Wandlessly he casts a silencing charm. All that’s left is his and Draco’s breathing.
The song they danced to in a disgusting bar in a corner of muggle London where they weren’t The Boy Who Lived Twice and the Death Eater, or Malfoy and Potter, but Harry and Draco, for the very first time. The song they danced to when everyone else had left the dance floor at Dean and Seamus’ little wedding, swaying back and forth slowly. The song they danced their first dance to at their wedding.
“It never has for me,” Harry replies,  “It’s easier than falling asleep.”
anyway, u know how i've been crushing on him since 2nd yr
when did u start to learn quidditch?
"Long enough to notice that you look adorable when you sleep, I couldn't bear to wake you." Harry blushed and ducked his head under the covers to hide his reddening face.
He doesn't reply to Hermione's text. It's been ten hours and I'm still wandering around the castle, Hermione wasn't as worried and she says he's done this before but I'm starting to feel sick with worry.
hmmm, maybe..
Draco sat up, with tears in his closed eyes, he'd named that dog Ghost, she'd been his best friend for a day and then she'd been murdered in cold blood.
"I think it says, 'I'm with Harry (Pansy) we think Blaise was under the imperious curse and tricked Draco into coming in here.' then there's a drawing of an arrow pointing to our left, indicating they wen that way I'm guessing," Hermione reads out.
I open my eyes and look at Hermione, "huh?"
____________________
Madam Pomfrey shuffled around the room, checking on who was awake and seeing how they were doing after the ordeal they had all been through. She came around to where Harry and Draco were and they both greeted her. She told them to stay still while she cast a quick spell to check on how their bodies were holding up, she smiled and told them they could both leave and that they just needed to rest well over the next few nights.
go get her, I gtg kill Ron
"Don't look at me like that," he says blushing. This feels more like the Draco I used to know, not quite in sync with how he feels but I almost prefer this Draco. He's feisty and I love that about him, he's not all soft edges. Draco has some sharp edges too and if you're not careful about them, they might stab you.
what why? why was
I take another wobbly step toward him.
"I think he went for a walk around the school, but I haven't seen him in classes for the last two lessons,"
Neville whimpered, and Theodore rushed to his side, almost forgetting to be quiet but remembering it before he accidentally woke any of the lovebirds up. He stood over Neville and became immediately flustered. When he had decided to do this he hadn't figured out what to do once he got here. He had half figured that maybe he would look over them to access their okayness then leave. But that stupid idea had died as soon as he heard Neville whimper.
"What?" I don't understand what's happening.
wot gave it away with me?
----------------------------------------
Harry's POV (1st person)
u r probably wrong anyway
sure Mione, what's up?
I have a question
Draco looked over to another bed in the room as he heard a stifled giggle, Pansy looked over at him and winked. She let go of Hermione's hand and sat up in bed as Madam Pomfrey went over to check on how she was doing.
"Hey?"
Draco didn't go to his dorms, he went up the Astronomy tower, the stars had always helped him calm down, to bad it was still an hour till he could see them. He sat on the floor, looking up at the sky, slightly shivering from the cold air of the autumn afternoon.
nope, just when my friend starts to drone on about her homework
ahh, yes? y?
i know ur Slytherin but that doesn't make it okay.
They didn't really understand how Harry had felt about those Voldemort or his 'death eater' followers had killed, it made him sick to the stomach and he almost went back to the bathroom throw up in the washing basin, but he held it back, he always held it back.
"You want me to get into your bed with you?"  Harry's voice was still a whisper but barely.
"Weird is cool," (Ron)
same as b4, wbu?
Draco rolled over and Harry paused in his line of thinking. Then rolled over to face Draco. His silver eyes blinked at him sluggishly. Harry smiled at Draco and felt his heart leap up like an excited puppy as Draco softly and tiredly smiled back at Harry.
so...uhh... how r u?
"Expelliarmus!"
very original, :'). anyway, treacle tart
"Well, do you want to be my boyfriend?" Harry asked equally as tentatively as Draco.
There are three men that I can see. One is further away from the other two, standing guard or something but there may be others that we can't see at all and it's already three on two. Blaise doesn't have his wand and neither does Draco, not that Blaise would be much help since Pansy figured out he was under the imperious curse a few minutes earlier just after we got here.
yes, tho i am curious, in first year, was that really your first time on a broom?
what happened to the pleasantries?
"Can you message him, my device thing is back at my dorm,"
"I brought you a green apple just because I remember you eating them all the time," I chuckle and hold out a green apple I brought just for fun.
"I really do like you a lot, and I do want to be with you," he finishes, somewhat deflated.
I run forward and start to battle two at once, me and Pansy are separated now, by quite a bit. I hope she knows enough good spells to hold her own against the two death eaters.
"So can you help me with the potronus assignment..?" He asks while I'm still writing stuff down, I pause and look up, his face is slightly paler than his usual colour.
I begin again and watch as he messily scrawls down points from what I'm telling him.
do u want to talk about it?
my 'dumbledore pair'
"Harry!" I say loudly to get his attention.
oh, so u didn't miss me *pout*
I'm in the seventh-floor corridor, I haven't been back here since the war, I wonder how the ROR is doing after the fiendfire incident. I walk past it three times just thinking not really sure what, if anything, I'll find behind the door.
"Uh sure."
i think thats a huge stretch
"ahh, right," I had known he was getting to this question, "I told you about, the Patronus thing last summer yeah? you know there an assignment on is in DADA on it, I met up with, that person, in the library and he offered to help, it brought a rush of memories back and well, I ran, cowardly I know, and I feel bad now but I don't know how to fix that sort of thing, I'm not good at apologizing."
"Thank you, Draco," Blaise smiles, his eyes shining a little more than usual.
I guess i'll go with Hermione and Ron
"We have to name ourselves something, what should I call myself?" (Draco)
u didn't scare me away, scarface
After both of the classes I have yet to see Harry, why did he skip class, where is he? I start to wander around thinking of possible places Harry could be and why he skipped class. I end up by the front doors, I open them and feel the warm breeze against my face.
It's seven against six, we have the advantage.
cos im not str8 :P
Couldn't Harry just catch a break? Eight whole years of nothing to but trouble and he still couldn't get just a little time off?
With me? or other people?
8th u?
Blaise POV 1st person
all he does is play chess, obsess about Quidditch and the like
"What are you doing?" I ask.
Panseeeeeey!
"Because the school decided it was a good idea," (Blaise)
I ramble on about the wolfbane potion, then notice that Harry seems to have zoned out and is now staring at something on my face, I stop in the middle of talking about how the different ingredients create a general neutraliser.
u one of the bullies?
______________
"Well, the potion reacts with your brain so that you remain sane during the transformation..." Draco goes on to explain more about the effects and how often you have to take it, I blank out and start staring at his lips.
that didn't make me feel any better, in fact I probably feel worse.
Blaise is attempting to move an injured and staggering Draco away from the fray.
sure, in the back of the library?
Luna? he saw Luna riding a thestral, he hadn't talked to her in a while, so he decided to go see her. He cast a cushioning char on the ground and jumped, it was rather exhilarating to fall 100 metres or so. This method was easier than taking 5 hours to climb down the millions of stairs, nobody mentioned it often but the design of hogwarts was annoying, way too many stairs.
____________________
calm down, it'll be fine
hmm i can kinda see it tho, u and him are like opposites
why do you care about Blaise?
hey! im not in denial!
"You were never a good son to your father, you disobeyed him, you disobeyed the dark lord. You're a useless and idiotic pawn who doesn't even know how to be loyal to anyone!" the man with the wolf mask hits Draco sending him sprawling across the damp forest floor.
I guess we could meet up...
how so
u help me with potions ye?
"You know what happened between me and Ron?"
Hermione was on one side of Neville and Ron on the other, as neither of them can really talk to the other even though they have a mutual goal. they were walking across the ground, it was still a few hours before curfew so they had time to search.
has anyone seen harry or draco? I havent seen either of them since I found Harry in the ROR and told him to find Draco
"We found Harry, come on," I thought Pansy would've been the one to tell me whether someone found Harry or not, but whatever I need to see Harry.
to help people past the horrors of the war maybe? im personally scarred physically and mentally.
be the one hurting you," the one kicking Draco in the stomach says.
"I heard from someone that Harry asked you on a date," Pansy says accusingly, probably annoyed that someone else told her rather than me. Probably, Hermione, they've been hanging out a lot over the past few days.
Harry stared at his reflection in the mirror, the lightning scar contrasting against the skin of his face, and his eyes, the eyes. His mother's eyes, but also the same shade of green he sees every night in his nightmares, that flash of bright green, the horror, his fault.
"Hi, Harry," Draco says, looking over at me, his face heating light, is he blushing? Is Draco blushing?
"So what did you wanna ask?" He smiles at me without a clue, I wince inwardly still unsure about whether or not he's is even interested in guys let alone someone like me.
Blaise lead him toward the forbidden forest, his grip tightening. then all of a sudden he halted and his body spasmed weirdly before he jolted forward again, leading Draco forward again. it almost looked as though he was fighting with himself, what did that mean?
(A/n I went overboard with the kissing didn't I? :') )
"Sure okay,"
Harry's P.O.V (3rd person)
Another death eater from somewhere in the trees comes at us, he must have been hidden. The three other death eaters we're fighting is already difficult enough without this new threat.
The man jumps to the side and sends his own jynx back at me. in the back of my mind I register Pansy attacking one of the other death eaters and Blaise trying to move Draco away from the melee.
"Hmmm," (Hermione and Ron)
"Well, the others are surely going to worry and probably go searching for us, Draco and Blaise," I hum in conformation thinking it over.
The 'mobile device' flashed sitting innocently on his bedside table and a new message appeared on the screen.
mhmmm
how were ur classes?
Luna and Ginny were hugging each other both in relief that the fighting was over and using each other to prevent themselves from collapsing onto the ground and passing out from exhaustion.
I got back to the eighth year dorm late and found Blaise in my room, there hadn't been anyone else up when I'd arrived in the common room, the time being 1 am. Blaise was on my bed, just laying there looking up at the ceiling, his face was blank but I could tell he was hurting by the way his fists were slightly clenched, and his gaze was fixed solidly on the roof.
u r hawt dray, y wouldn't Potter want to shag u?
that's great
"This isn't enough punishment for your sins... how about... we make your "
you acted superior and i didn't like how you thought u were better than everyone else, Ron was the first friend i'd ever had, then you insulted him, and to be honest you kinda reminded me of my cousin Dudley
Shit. I don't have my wand anymore.
nah, you text like a guy
oh salazar! the time! Gtg 2 class ttyl
ok, see u then
ohhhhh, this should be entertaining
"Maybe he was under the imperious curse..." she mumbles to herself.
There's a crash and my door flies open, Blaise has his wand out and it is pointing at the fallen door.
The room had eight patients or eight occupied beds. He glanced around and realised that one of the beds actually had two people, Potter and Draco, they barely fit on the small hospital bed together... He wandered what Daphne would think of this new development.
both?
Harry's POV
Blaise's eyes widen and he takes a few steps back then he looks at his hands and an expression of horror comes over him.
“Well,” Teddy began, entering the room now, looking around. “There’s no place for anything to hide.”
INCIDENT TYPE/OFFENSE: UNIDENTIFIED DARK MAGIC/HAUNTING/OTHERS
Harry sighed.
“Don’t question it,” Neville said, sitting at a table across from Luna, devouring a plate of cookies.
“There’s still a pretty good amount of light, and we will be outside the house,” Draco said, while Teddy was already putting on his cerulean jumper with a big T across it. “It will be fine, I promise.”
The first thing his eyes were drawn to was the door. It was closed. He looked around, no one else was in the room. It was only then that, catching up with the rest of his awareness, he realized the noise had been distant. He relaxed but remained alert.
(and what was with that ridiculous long hair?) and the angles of his face even more pronounced. He looked like a cartoon drawn by someone who just had Malfoy described to him and never seen an actual picture. Harry’s brain, despite still being in the sluggish process of waking up, took all that in and then focused on the next, most urgent, thing: Malfoy was wearing bloody wizard robes.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Harry Potter said, and yanked him inside the house by the arm.
He made it next to the biggest tree on the property. Teddy was on the ground, struggling to crawl away from the bushes nearby; and the bushes, it seemed, were struggling to pull him in. Vines, twigs and roots were wrapped around the boy’s legs and midsection. Teddy’s big terrified eyes looked at Draco imploringly. He let out a cry when a vine finally took hold of one of his arms and gave it a strong pull, undoing all progress he had made to escape. A loud buzzing filled Draco’s head, muddling his thoughts even further. The sight of a pale face in the darkness of the angry bush made his body go slack, he caught himself with the big tree.
“Who else?” he said. “I mean… full Auror training, Cursebreaker experience, that stint with the Hit Wizards, all that globetrotting... Not to mention the Horcrux destroying, and Dark Lord slaying. Quite an impressive CV one must admit. You’ve been busy living up to the Our Hero and Saviour image, Potter.”
be done by then,” Malfoy replied. “That’s the night of the main event. And the situation’s bad enough for me to be here… So, I take it you’ll do it?”
“Yes?”
“Potter?”
A coldness began enveloping him. A coldness that had only been on the periphery of his perception ever since he arrived, but it had taken a firm hold of him now. A scrapping noise below. He suddenly felt glued to the bed, unable to move. A shiver coursed through his entire body.
“So Teddy’s attending Hogwarts next year?” asked Narcissa Malfoy, putting her now empty cup of tea aside.
His eyes snapped open. His whole body seized for a second and then froze.
“Are you all right?” Teddy asked while helping him up. Harry did not miss the smile threatening to form on his godson’s lips.
and the open letters as if he’d just read Harry’s mind. Which was possible, he was still pants at Occlumency.
“Oh. Ehm... No problem…”
Draco was about to reply with an energic negative and a command for them to get inside so Teddy and Andromeda could leave, when he heard it: A high-pitched scream, a tump, and the sound of something being dragged over dirt, leaves and twigs. It took him a couple of seconds to make his body move and even while he was running towards the source of the commotion he felt his legs stiff. Coldness dribbled down his forehead and a dry hammering had begun to manifest in his chest.
Of course Harry bloody Potter was going to receive dozens of Valentines. That had been part of his thought process back in second year. So, what was another one in that pile? But then he couldn’t resist making it a bloody singing one. He had wanted both to stand out and embarrass him. His life and relationship with Potter, summed up in a singing Valentine.
“Sure!” Teddy replied at once, trampling all over his comic book on the way to the coat rack.
An old well of shame and guilt was opening up inside him the more he stared, yet he couldn’t look away. It felt so right to keep looking, and so wrong.
“And your father…?”
A small, contented sigh escaped him.
something properly-raised wizards did. Draco had been expected to show utmost control of his emotions—at least when it came to his magic—before his ninth birthday. Harry still routinely turned the walls of whatever room he was in inside out when extremely frustrated; or once, when startled, covered absolutely everything with the most hideous polka dot pattern.
“What happened?” his Mother asked him, while Andromeda crouched to take care of Teddy, who kept shaking his head and refusing to look at any of them.
Harry didn’t know what had made him call out. His mind had been preoccupied thinking about the house, but his body…
“No, none of that,” Malfoy said. “All garden maintenance and the like was done by the house-elves on the daily.”
After a light supper in one of the sombre kitchens, in which Harry had been surprised seeing Draco handling a few cooking utensils with ease (not to mention even offering to whip up something quick for Harry), they sat in the half-lit space in silence. Malfoy was lost in thought, seemingly struggling with something. Harry used the chance to look at him closely. When he wasn’t posturing, filled to the brim with arrogance and contempt for most everyone, Malfoy still had this elegance about him, Harry thought and hated himself a little for it. He hated himself a little more for this not being the first time he’d thought such things. Before, he’d been lucky since the man always had said or done something utterly vile right when Harry’s thought began to stray in those unwanted directions. But he was quiet now, quiet and still and with a solemn expression Harry had seen little of before. Their sixth year at Hogwarts came to Harry’s mind immediately, followed by the few times he’d seen him during the war. He’d seemed small and pathetic then, just a kid. A man now, the concern in his face lend him a gravitas Harry found himself puzzled by.
After a bout of forced politeness, awkward silences and a couple of instances of nearly losing his temper, Harry finally listened to what exactly had brought Malfoy to his home.
“Oh, come on!” he exclaimed, rushing to open the kitchen window to let an eagle owl in.
Morning light assaulted him the second his eyes opened. He sat up.
Harry looked up to find an apprehensive Malfoy looking past him.
“So it arrived, then,” Malfoy said.
“We’ll check that part out tomorrow,” Malfoy said. “It’s late, and nothing has happened. Maybe I did get rid of it,” he said, the last part almost hopeful.
—Potter was slow, and then he realized what he had just said that out loud. Slower than Potter today, not a good sign.
They agreed to the terms of it all, with Harry refusing any kind of payment, (“I do this for Andromeda, not money,” he had said.) and arranging for Harry to be at the manor the next day, an hour before sunset when, according to Malfoy, it was when the “activity” usually hit its peak.
“Modesty suits you as well as those dreadful glasses, Potter,” Malfoy reproached him, genuinely, it seemed. The blond sit back, staring right at Harry’s eyes, his movements were more fluid now, almost catlike.
“Am I lying? You did all that, didn’t you?”
“I think you just, er, displaced your things!” Harry said when he saw him, a grin on his face. He was standing next to a very familiar dresser.
Harry stood up and looked around. The vegetation did seem like that of a house being severely neglected, with bushes and hedges having grown in complete disorder but then had been deprived of water and sun for ages, the grass was a pale brown mess of mud and weeds running amok, and even those looked devoid of life. He began to walk slowly and aimlessly. If one were to ask his opinion, Harry would’ve said that the whole place looked dead, but he was no expert. It was obvious there were no such spells in place. A feeling of sadness began to envelop him, something akin to be standing in the middle of an old, disused graveyard, although mixed, he realized, with the dread of being watched… being watched by the dead.
“HARRY!”
“Right, the party!” Teddy piped up. “Can I help?”
“I heard my Gran say they can’t even Apparate in or out without permission. Their Floo is monitored too,” Teddy supplied thoughtfully, his hand hovering near the phylactery.
“What’s that?”
“Are you quite all right, Draco?” Andromeda asked him. “You look paler than usual.”
“I still can’t believe you’re going ahead with it,” he said once he had caught up with Malfoy, motorbike by his side. The gates had allowed him entry. “If things are as bad as you say.”
“The first option.”
A noise.
“I thought you said they weren’t patronuses at all.”
“You’re going to exhaust yourself to death.”
“Why?”
They were standing on the drawing room, by the secret door down to the cellar. It was well past midnight. The darkness from below looked back at them. Harry shone his wand’s light down the steps, no use.
“That’s weird,” Malfoy said, frowning.
███████████████████
He had arrived just last night from the Caribbean, completely portkey-lagged and underfed, and had had trouble sleeping. After a lot of turning around in bed and way too much Sleeping Potion, he’d finally managed to do so. Then, under two hours later, the doorbell had rung. Cursing, he got up, put on the wrong bloody glasses and walked as carefully as he could down the stairs to open the door to one of the very last people he had ever expected to find there.
“I should get going,” Malfoy said, standing up. “Lots to do.”
“These ones were for the Malfoys’ bedrooms,” Harry said, setting up the last one. “But since you’re here…”
“Of course not.”
“Cold spot,” he said, his breath a puff of vapor.
Hearing “Hey, what’s all this?” clinched it all. Something snapped inside his brain, recently primed with that memory of him panicking. He felt his magic expand violently. His attempt at containing it was futile: the room had emptied completely in less than a second.
Andromeda looked from mother to son, intrigued. Before she could formulate the question, Draco piped up:
Too much eggnog, Ginny thought.
“Then who else have you asked? I couldn’t possibly have been your first option,” Harry wondered. “What do your pureblood friends experts in hauntings and all things magical think? Surely they’ve visited you frequently, experienced something.”
The window was half open, and long muddy footprints went from it to the bed and back out.
“I suppose…”
“Anything interesting?” Malfoy asked at the breakfast table, nodding towards the
“Merlin, Teddy,” he said, after his soul came back to his body. “You—… What are you doing here?”
Harry felt his face start to go hot.
Next thing he knew he was lying on the floor.
“Did you sleep alright?” Harry asked him, joining him by the window.
“You Malfoys really go all out on your parties, huh?” Harry commented without expecting an answer, reaching for his rucksack and opening it. He rummaged through its depths, made deeper by an Undetectable Extension Charm courtesy of Hermione, until he realized he could just summon what he wanted with his wand. It still wasn’t his first instinct, even after many years of using the bag, or of being a wizard.
A creak, much nearer than the others.
“Alright, then,” Malfoy said, leading them now to the right through an ample corridor. Harry noticed the change in the atmosphere almost immediately. It was still spacious, but he stopped feeling as if he was on an abandoned building. He hadn’t noticed how tense his body was, but he relaxed more and more as they walked towards their destination. The painful memories were a distant blur now, his mind presently focused on the problem at hand. “Here we are,” Malfoy said.
“That it’s none of their business,” Malfoy supplied. “So, Granger has nothing?” he didn’t wait for an answer. “Can’t be too surprised, no use asking a… muggleborn anything on these matters.”
“No, it’s fine,” Harry said. “I told you I don’t want any of your money.”
“Harry?”
“Whoa!” he heard Harry say.
He looked away. He let the full-body cringe happen.
“Show me where it happened,” he said, in a well-practiced business-like tone, the one he had found made people do what he wanted. “The incident with Teddy. It was in the garden, I recall you said?”
“Oh?”
They walked towards the trees and bushes that were too naked even for this time of the year, in Harry’s opinion, and up to the base of a huge tree.
Draco played by the window. Soft winter light streamed through it. Snow slowly accumulated on the top of the trees right outside, their black silhouettes framing him. His eyes were gently closed. Harry, sitting on an armchair by the fire, had his no-longer-hot chocolate mug in a tight grip. His gazed fixed on Draco’s… everything. His eyes delighted by the sight of his pale skin, his soft yet focused expression, his long fingers dancing deftly on the violin strings.
“Good thing you don’t think much of damaging my reputation, then,” Harry quipped.
He was thinking about last night again, the cold in the room, and the cold pulsating from within himself, the noises… How had he managed to fall asleep in the midst of all that? How did he not notice when something—an undoubtedly physical and tangible something—entered his room and sat on the foot of his bed? In that moment he hadn’t noticed, but it hadn’t been his controlled and even breathing the thing that had helped him fall asleep, not completely. A wave of exhaustion had slowly overpowered him, an exhaustion that didn’t really match with everything he’d done that day.
“It can be,” Malfoy interjected, realizing something.
Or it would remain there, solid. Ready to pounce…
He reached the bottom of the trunk, where only dust, broken quills and discarded pieces of parchment lived. He unrumpled one with his wand, curious.
He took a step to the right.
Their steps on the polished stone floor echoed all through the house. Harry saw spurts of activity here and there, mostly members of staff getting everything ready for the Malfoy’s party, but the vastness of the building overpowered any presence, making them feel like the only ones there. Streams of fog-filtered light poured down from the huge windows, illuminating their path through the manor.
“Oh, well, uh…” Harry replied, seeing that the letter at the top was Hermione’s. “Hermione’s pretty happy. Another big donation for S.P.E.W. came in.”
How had he allowed the conversation to shift in this way? Harry shook his head and took a sip of the disgusting cold tea, forcing it down his throat. It helped.
And then, because he was nothing if not thorough—and a bit of a masochist—, he smoothed out the rest of the crumpled parchment balls. He compared Harry’s hair to everything from bottles of ink to raven feathers, and his eyes to emeralds and avocados. The only consistency seemed to be him rhyming “mine” with “divine”; he had been so—he gagged a little—proud of that one.
Half-disbelief, half-fear.
“Yeah…” Harry said, looking down at the letter for the umpteenth time. “Merlin help me, yes, I’ll do it. Although I think you should really cancel this party.”
“See, after that display I’m not sure you’re up to it,” Malfoy said, already walking away.
Seeing Harry’s face a quarter of a second later made the little colour he had on his go down the drain.
Yes, they both had gotten the best of deals in the end.
Harry did not mention that Andromeda’s letter had said he’d used Incendio and Reducto
Malfoy blinked rapidly, making Harry smirk.

“Potter.”
“Really? I told you, that’s where almost nothing has happened so far,” he said as if explaining something to a child much younger than Teddy. “That’s the whole reason we’re having it there.”
Malfoy looked at him with cold amusement, then his gaze fell upon Andromeda’s letter in Harry’s hands. Harry looked down at it as well.
“What even is this thing?” Malfoy demanded once he saw him, walking towards the television set. “Why is everything pointed at it?” He looked around the room.
“It would seem so,” Malfoy replied quietly. Harry’s retort died on his lips upon hearing what he thought was a sincere tone.
Then there were the letters…
Harry turned to Malfoy.
Harry completely understood him, the place
Harry grinned wildly, with his teeth as white as a shark’s. Draco wished he could vanish himself.
. Teddy was gorging himself with food and Draco was looking at the boy with amusement and mild worry.
“I don’t use it much,” he elaborated with a shrug. “It’s here for Ron and Neville, they like Doctor Who and come here to watch it and Nev takes care of the garden and I let him run whatever Herbology experiment he wants there. Hermione doesn’t like television so Ron…”
He didn’t answer him.
“Yeah, I did, but…”
“All right,” Harry agreed. He had no desire to revisit the place. The unfathomable darkness of it and the potential of some kind of horrors were last on his list of reasons.
Anchored, right… Harry had heard about that. Just like Hogwarts was these days. Not even brooms could fly without express permission from a professor he had heard… Harry wondered if part of the rarefied air of the place was related to that. He hoped so.
“Yeah, fine,” he said, without looking at her. “I’m fine.”
NARRATIVE (via: Quick-Quotes Typewriter)
“Yeah, well, we’ll see…” Malfoy said, avoiding Harry’s gaze now next to him. “Maybe after you fail miserably, I’ll show you how it’s done. I had a good hang of it back when I rescued your godson in the garden. The activity even calmed down a lot after that. A couple of strategically placed spells…” He dramatically dusted off his hands.
“I see… Well, she really didn’t say anything more. She offered to look in some books, and ask her friends at the Spirit Division but you said…”
He landed as gracefully as he could on the muddy terrain in front of the huge main gates. A figure stood before them, their wand lit. Once Harry’s eyes adjusted, he could see it was Malfoy, who was now walking towards him. He then noticed the Ministry officials at either side of the gate, impassive, looking straight ahead without acknowledging him.
Harry rolled his eyes and huffed, not giving Malfoy any more of an answer than that. The leather jacket was also Sirius’, he had found it in a trunk in his room in Grimmauld Place, back when he thought he could handle to live there. He suspected he now had worn it more than Sirius ever did. It was pretty snug by now, even with some sloppy Extension Charms added to it, one more and Harry was sure the thing would burst at the seams. He also wore his work jeans and boots, they had been with him all through his Peru and Egypt trips.
“I burnt that bush yesterday, the one that attacked Teddy,” he explained, pointing at a very much not-burnt bush.
“It’s a TV, Malfoy,” Harry said in a flat voice, still holding Andromeda’s letter in his hands.
“Oh…”
His mother and Andromeda were there now, visibly worried.
He let the thoughts take over. He’d never been more at ease or comfortable at night. Shame and guilt seemed foreign, strange and fleeting in that moment, like they had never been a part of him. Full of thoughts and feelings and memories he hadn’t realized he’d been saving, he closed his eyes, caressed the sheets with one hand and then just as slowly began caressing himself with the other, starting with his naked chest, then lower and lower and lower…
“Gone,” was all Malfoy said.
Page 1
“Yeah,” Harry replied, his mind still thinking about the contents of the letter. Well, not so much the contents as the tone of it: the thinly veiled guilt-tripping. A small part of his brain told him that he was just guilt-tripping himself. Yes, Andromeda had mentioned Teddy and the incident in Malfoy’s house, but his mind had added the “
“I don’t know, maybe then it would have been my screaming waking both of you up,” the boy surmised, stepping away from the window and taking one last look at the room. “You just can’t win sometimes, I guess,” he said with a sigh. “I’m hungry,” he declared and left the room.
Inside the room—more spacious and grander than any room Harry had ever been in—, Harry produced a few more phylacteries from his rucksack, to Teddy’s surprise. They were much smaller than the ones from before, but once he activated them they shone just as brightly. He began putting them around the bed. Teddy observed him carefully, something clearly weighing on his mind.
“So not portable patronuses at all?” Malfoy said. Harry shot him an irritated look.

good, right?” Ginny asked abruptly, now looking at Luna.
“Best decision you’ve made so far, to be honest.”
At first impression, Draco Malfoy looked much the same as he’d done in his school years. On closer inspection, however, it was evident that he was taller, although roughly the same height as Harry, and paler and
“Sorry?”
Harry was shell-shocked.
Malfoy’s face recounting his experiences appeared on his mind’s eye. That must be it. He closed his eyes, trying to erase the image. Bloody Malfoy…
“I thought you had used them all,” Teddy commented.
So, he tried to Apparate out.
The door opened.
“All right…”
“What is?”
Draco glared at him like—no,
He produced an old-fashioned Muggle camera. It still had a “Property of Colin Creevey” label on it. Harry looked at it for a moment. A small sigh escaped him.
“She is,” the boy replied, too quickly. “If not, I can just ask Harry. Maybe he can come too,” he added after a second of consideration.
Hermione sighed in agreement and took another sip of her drink. Ron did likewise, trying to drown the shock of spending Christmas at Malfoy Manor and of the scene developing before him. Both still had awful memories associated with the place, but Harry had asked them to come. It—and him—made Harry happy, and that’s all that ultimately mattered to them.
Draco had never felt more out of place than on the muggle neighbourhood he had just Apparated to. He knew enough about muggles to be aware that his indigo robes were an uncommon sight among them, and his mid-back long platinum blond hair surely did not help matters. Granted, there weren’t many of them at this hour in the morning. A happy accident, really, since he really hadn’t thought this out at all. He normally would have inhaled deeply, then put on his best sneering expression and swaggered his way towards his destination, trying to make everyone around him feel inferior by the sheer Slytherin-ness of him. It was a testament to his state of mind, and the toll of having been on house arrest for too long, that he limited himself to merely scowling and putting his hands in his pockets all the way, trying to ignore the muggles jogging past him wearing those strange outfits that seemed to have been charmed with some variant of colourful Lumos.
“What for?”
“If you insist on going ahead with the party then I need to protect the place,” Harry replied, pointing at his rucksack.
“I think I finally got them,” Harry said when he returned, looking solemn.
“And don’t worry,” Malfoy said. “They wouldn’t dare read yours. They were properly closed, right?”
He took the letter below Hermione’s. It was from… an acquaintance at the Auror Office. He scanned it quickly, having read it already.
“My cooking
“Wh—oh…”
“Mother,” he said at last. “I just finished briefing the staff on the final preparations.”
parts.
“It’s not like he’d know you’d be enough of an impulsive prat to just try and Apparate on a potentially Anchored place,” Malfoy said while leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed and a mocking expression, yet he looked like he’d come running from the other side of the house.
“Where are the house-elves?” Harry asked, remembering an earlier conversation.
He managed to turn to his side, away from the window and towards the door. He exhaled vapour, just the once, as another unidentifiable sound was heard. A cold feeling pulsated from deep within his chest.
“It all would go on public record,” Malfoy said, taking Harry out of his musings, his voice as unsteady as it had been during the whole tale. “It’s been that way ever since your friend Granger pushed those policy reforms. Mudbloods clearly don’t understand the concept of privacy, of not airing one’s dirty laundry in public. My family obviously doesn’t want any of this out there for the Prophet to put the worst spin on it. Not without the party this close.”
“Malfoy?” said the man who opened it. “What are you doing here?”
“We have taken precautions.”
“…I mean, how do you think I got your address?” Malfoy was saying, with Harry having missed the preamble to that question. “Honestly, I think that’s one of the most top secret bits of information in Britain,” his guest shook his head in disbelief and disapproval.
Harry smiled, both to reassure Teddy and to compliment his inquisitive nature.
█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████ almost passing out████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
Harry was lying in bed a few minutes later, after Malfoy had shown him to his room on the third floor, conveniently next to Teddy’s. The thick fog and clouds had relented a smidge, and he could at least see the fuzzy outline of the full moon and the hazy silhouette of what he assumed was a dead tree. Delicate silvery light and murky, ever-changing shadows came from the giant, imposing window—so different to the ones in his comparatively tiny house—and lend the room an unworldly atmosphere. He was lying on the finest sheets he’d ever seen or touched, and the world’s most expensive-looking blanket was on top of him. It had been unknown to him than going to sleep could be quite this… expensive, this comfortable. The ominous and ethereal light and the feeling of the exquisite beddings somehow strayed his thoughts back to Malfoy.
“Hey, Teddy, do you want to go see the er… glow-worms in the garden?” It was best to let Mother explain, or don’t; whichever she chose to be the wisest route. “Maybe we’ll catch sight of some Flitterby moths or fairies.”
Another indignant huff.
He remembered how he had utterly panicked, how he had fallen back on his tried-and-true bullying tactics and then how he had deflected all his shame, anger and spite to the Weasley girl, who had taken it all with a magnificent lack of grace, making his last-minute immature strategy work beautifully. Maybe she had written something to him as well…
He burned it with a flick of his wand and focused on what really mattered: the attachment…
Harry was about to argue with him but ultimately decided it was best not to. Pathetic as it probably was, he rarely won an argument with his godson. He found it difficult being strict with him, even when needed, so he usually left that part to Andromeda. It all too often left him feeling completely unequipped for the role of godfather, even after all those years.
“Draco!”
Oh, Merlin…
Then to the left.
Draco went to the next movement in the piece with no hesitation, making Harry’s breath hitch. Harry was utterly lost in the sound of the melody and the sight of the performer. The very expensive and beautiful violin he’d just given his boyfriend had already paid off better than any investment ever made, not that it needed to, but he was bloody glad it had done so.
“Honestly, living among muggles… How do you even communicate, then?” Malfoy said, shaking his head. “Didn’t you own the Black House? That was one impressive manoeuvring of inheritance law, by the way. It should’ve been mine.”
“Follow me,” the other man said, walking towards the house. They obeyed.
“I was what?”
shoulders, past his thick neck and then up to…
HIS HAIR IS AS DARK AS THE NIGHT SKY—”
Teddy grinned at him.
“It’s not,” Malfoy said. “I’ve been to haunted houses; half of all pureblood’s homes are haunted to some degree. And I don’t mean places full of chatty, ridiculous ghosts and cackling poltergeists like Hogwarts, I meant proper hauntings.”
“Uncle Draco!” said Teddy, getting up the floor with a jump and running towards him.
“Yes, I rather like this house,” Luna said, back to her dreamy self. “I had only mostly seen the cellar before, but the rest of it is quite lovely.”
A thump. Only now he noticed the constant creaking of the house, the constant settling of it, never quite at rest… A whole house turning and tossing as he did most nights before falling into a light, uneasy sleep. Only, for it, sleep never comes. Its eternal unrest masked by the sounds of everyday life, left ignored, unattended, free to seethe and plan.
“All our letters get intercepted and checked before they reach us, as you could guess by the sorry state of that owl that brought yours earlier.”
“Hmm?” Luna said, looking—for the very first time since they knew her—absolutely wrong-footed. “The best, yes.”
The potency of Harry’s raw magic was a turn-on, sure, and even more so when his affinity with casual wandless casting seemed to be related to it, but being turned on didn’t help when dealing with the aftermath of such incidents. They were still occasionally finding things covered on polka dots around Harry’s flat. Draco was sure Harry hadn’t bothered to un-polka-dotify some of his underwear. Thankfully, he didn’t wear those when Draco came round.
He hadn’t spent much time recently on the manor’s gardens, not even after his and his family’s house arrest had ended, but he was sure plants didn’t die as quickly and… stubbornly as the ones all around him did. To his surprise, his mother had even hired a muggle gardener to take care of them but that proved to be as ineffective as doing nothing, maybe the plants missed the house-elves.
“Oh, thank Circe,” Draco said. His relief made him forget his shame for a second.
“Reminds me of Draco,” Narcissa said, looking fondly at the boy, whose cobalt blue hair was catching the setting sun’s light that flooded the salon through the huge windows. “The house-elves used to find him playing with sticks and chasing the peacocks, trying to transfigure them into squirrels. A cause of great distress, to both the house-elves and the peacocks.”
“It will be fine, Teddy,” Harry said, softening his tone. “They don’t pull much out of me, only when actively protecting against something… So unless uhm… your cousin Draco here has an infestation of dementors the size of Azkaban and they all attack at the same time I think I can handle it, all right?”
“Sorry?” Draco heard him say.
“This all sounds like a job for the Spirit Division, Malfoy,” he said at the end of Malfoy’s tale, pouring more tea on his guest’s cup. His own had gone cold, sitting untouched besides him on the counter. He returned to his position of arms crossed over chest. It wasn’t that he didn’t believe him, but that the whole situation was so bizarre, starting from the fact that Malfoy had come to him for help, and going all the way to the sight of the very wizardly-looking blond sitting on his kitchen, surrounded by the fridge and the microwave. It was a clash, a whiplash that reminded him of the Weasleys making the Dursley’s not-chimney explode all those years ago, or of Dumbledore simply sitting on the Dursley’s living room, glasses of wine tapping his relatives on the head.
He stood there, his hands behind his back, unsure on how to proceed.
Draco was shopping for… well, everything. Harry was happily trotting alongside him, without having understood how embarrassing, on multiple levels, this all was. He’d been raised by muggles and been denied the knowledge of his birthright and of his very nature until a month before starting Hogwarts—something Draco still boggled at—so it was understandable how he couldn’t quite grasp just how mortified Draco felt.
“Right…” Harry said without any conviction, trying to read Malfoy’s expression. “I’ll get to work then.”
“Let’s get on with it,” Malfoy said at last, standing up and breaking the spell.
He had aimed at the bush, the spell hit its target and cut Teddy free. The boy crawled away from it at top speed, panting and slipping a few times on the muddy ground.
Harry fought hard the impulse to put his hand on Malfoy’s shoulder and of saying something comforting. Not that he would’ve had any idea what to say. Malfoy sniffed very slightly, looked down, and walked away with a grunt.
“Fancy gardening spellwork?” Harry wondered while, against Malfoy’s alarmed look, he crouched near the offending plant. “Neville’s talked about…”
“The food’s good,” Teddy jumped in at his defence, although Harry didn’t hear him, nor he heard Malfoy’s response.
He was now pretending to examine an ancient wardrobe in Mr. Armitage’s cavernous shop filled with dusty furniture and miscellaneous forgotten things. His reddening face was making a comeback again. He didn’t need Harry’s earnest reassurances of how this wasn’t that big of a deal, especially when the whole accidental magic was only a part of it, really. He cringed at the memory.
“What does it feel like?”

Good question, Harry thought. He wouldn’t have put it quite so dramatically but still, good question.
“Here,” Harry said, taking a step back and then grabbing Malfoy’s hand and positioning it just right. Malfoy’s eyes opened wide.
“It’s fine,” Malfoy said, his hand, now with a slight tremor, still extended. “So, what does this mean?”
The more he read, the more his brow furrowed. He had always trusted Andromeda’s judgement, but this time… He finally looked up to find that Malfoy wasn’t sitting in front of him anymore. Confused, he looked around until he heard the rustling of robes on the living room’s carpet.
“Sorry,” Harry shook his head. “I spaced out. What were you saying?”
“No, no,” Harry said. “It’s not like magic is a finite resource. I—”
The moment of truth.
“Pardon?”
They said good night to Teddy, who looked way too awake and alert to get into bed anytime soon. Harry locked the door behind him with a quick, wandless Alohomora.
Refusing to reply, Harry went about his work and exited the room; he crouched and placed the phylactery just outside it, on the floor in a corner near the big wooden doors. It would be hidden when these were fully opened. He placed a hand on each end of the artefact and twisted the top one, then tapped it twice with his wand. The crystal inside lit up with a blinding white. Harry stood up.
"Yeah, he did," I say not entirely sure where this is going.
"Morning sleepy-head," he said.
I'm pacing around my room trying to think where he is, but my mind keeps trying to think the worst and I don't know how to get the horrible idea of him being dead out of my head. last year during the battle at Hogwarts I remember when Hagrid carried Harry up to Hogwarts, proclaiming him to be dead, it took all my effort not to just cry right then and there, but my mum came to get me, I was too numb to argue. I will never forget that feeling, I had felt so lost, Harry was practically a rock in my life, he stayed the same, bickering every year.
"I don't know!" she stamps her foot in frustration.
right, of course
Harry awkwardly climbed into Draco's bed and slowly opened his arms, Draco slowly settled into them and pressed himself into Harry's warmer body only to find out that...
"N-no problem," she takes a deep breath in to calm herself down before continuing on, "We better be going,"
and who do you think i am?
"Where are you?"
well he's bi, and also apparently doesn't hate me
now, now Dray you wouldn't really do that to me would u
He stared out to the Forbidden Forest, he could see thestrals flying above the trees, and...
"Not sure why you're so obsessed with the 'Man' being a part of it but okay," (Hermione)
oh, well then. bye
probably *shrugs*
"Do you really like me?" Luna asked with her unique surprised expression that Ginny adored.
--------------
One of my opponents yells a familiar spell and I instinctively duck away from the killing curse aimed at me, I look behind me for a split second to see one of the death eaters fighting Pansy fall to the dirt.
Blaise was leading him out the front doors while Draco thought things over, Harry was okay, it was fine, everything was fine. Except, it wasn't.
Hey stranger ;)
They head in the direction for a little while before they all hear it.
Harry's POV (3rd person)
"He's fighting the imperious curse," I whisper.
same, i got nightmares sometimes as well, but now...
Harry turned to go back to the dormitory, and a silver-grey glint caught his eye before disappearing.
"What should we do first, hmm? slice off his perfectly manicured fingers one by one?" the first guy says sinisterly.
"It's probably a mix of those reasons," Pansy says shushing me, then pointing to the ground beneath us, Draco's wand, or what I can assume is Draco's wand is lying innocently on the ground and there's some disturbed dirt around the area, evidence of a struggle.
i wasn't sleeping very well, u can guess y
there aren't that many eighth yr Gryffindors
"Hello dray-co," a man in a dark hood, wearing a mask of a black wolf, says in a nasally voice that sent shivers down Draco's spine. "You've been a bad boy Draco, you need to be punished,"
guys and girls text differently?
"It looks like writing," Neville said uncertainly.
Draco shivered and hugged his arms around himself, and he watched as an owl flew away from its perch outside the window, somehow able to hear the swoosh of its wings through the thick glass. He continued to gaze through the window looking at the stars,  he can just make out his constellation shining down at Hogwarts and it reminds him of when he'd been told to memorise its whereabouts by his mother, she'd said it'd be a good way to make girls like him. He scoffed at it now, he had told Harry he didn't know his sexuality but in truth, he was gay, he has pretty much always known he was gay, from the moment Crab and Goyle had started talking about how pretty girls looked and whether they prefered bust or booty, whenever a similar topic had come up between them Draco had pretended to care, nodding in the appropriate places while lusting after the unattainable Harry Potter.
a Slytherin and a Gryffindor huh, never would've thought
yeah, my brain is fine Harry
what's so wrong with having hope, and wot's wrong with my humour?
"Agggghhhh when did he get so hot???!" Theo mutters to himself, thinking of a certain Gryffindor hero. Not the one most people seem fixated on though. Rather one that was overlooked for a long period of his life as a student at Hogwarts.
Draco's heading your way, good luck ;)
which other house would have 'sly' as a part of their name?
"Maybe be more.. subtle," (Hermione)
i like both, it depends on the company i feel like at the time
"Yes, I didn't-"
be a Slytherin
"B, you came," Ron says as I open the door, he's about to run and hug me but something in my expression warns him to not push it.
I want to fly with Draco when we're not trying to through insults and hurt one another, I want to experience the high I get from flying with Draco. I get this feeling that if we fly together as we are now, I'll feel as light as a cloud and as free as the wind. That sounds sappy but it's how I feel.
I follow Pansy down the stairs and through the schools front door.
I just didn't expect  it from the guy i think you are
"Yeah they kinda are," I lean down and press my lips to her forehead smiling.
"You're right, we haven't," I say blushing. I feel my ears heating up, goddamit this is difficult.
"How about... NotStraightMan...?" (Harry)
thats not rly important rn.. we should see if we can find Draco and Harry as well as Pansy and Blaise so that we can stop worrying
We break apart gasping for air, I grin at Draco and he wacks me over the head.
what's going on?
"Come on, let's fly!"
"Well done for figuring that out, Malfoy," Blaise's body turned to face him and the face that looked at him was transfigured in a horrifying expression that he had never seen on the real Blaise's face. "but you're too late, stupify!"
hey! mean
we'll figure that out, or we'll tell each other who we are.
The library door creaked open, and I knew it was Harry, he was here, we could talk face to face, and maybe we wouldn't clash like we had for the entirety or our previous schooling years
"Just a second... Here," (Pansy)
Draco trekked through the forest occasionally seeing a thestral or two above the forest canopy.
so who've you been chatting 2 so much recently ;)
"Yes, we are," Luna says in a quiet sing-song voice.
Daphne followed his gaze, "A Gryffindor? How intriguing."
u r starting to throw me off a bit
ur a fan?
well then, I'd say u're bi. who do you like??? ;)
im pretty sure i already know who you are...
"Merlins balls Blaise! What the flaming hell was that for? ever heard of knocking?" I shout in surprise.
"You good?"
The next day he had a terrible fever and Lucius refused to help him, the only reason he'd survived was due to one of the house elves, Dobby, who'd given him a tonic when Lucius wasn't looking to help cool down the fever.
shouldn't we tell the teachers about this?
Theo had quietly made his way to the infirmary while the rest of the castle slept. He avoided anyone else that was also wandering the corridors and made it to the infirmary without being detected.
I feeling of hopelessness crashes over me, me and Pansy can't hold up if it's two against six.
____________
you'll never know if you don't ask
ahhh, in that stage "denial"
"Ah yeah, I just have stupid pins and needles," I say while stomping my foot to get my blood flowing again.
Harry had a bone to pick with Ron and a discussion with Malfoy and a few other things to do.
*rolls eyes*
Well, why not? and I mean, I have been wanting to kiss you...
y? what did he do now
"You have the most beautiful green eyes you know? It's really hard to see them properly with your glasses on." I blush and look down but he uses the hand still holding my glasses to tilt my head back up to look at him.
"Protago!"
"I think Blaise was under the imperious curse," Pansy says as a short explanation to me. "the person who put him under the imperious curse is not likely in the castle so we're going to the forbidden forest as that is most likely where they are," her reasoning could rival Hermione, they would make great friends... or a couple? hmmm... its weird not think of Ron and Hermione as together but I guess they really needed the breakup.
nightmares right? I get them too, even before the war
"huh? I didn't hear anything?" Neville replies.
It's the same desk I fell asleep on a little while ago, I decided not to sit on the same chair as it made me remember the dream I'd had.
______________
There wasn't anyone there so Harry lay on his four-poster bed and thought, he thought about the way he talked to Draco, how it felt natural, how he didn't fake it, how he was actually amused, not happy, never happy. He thought about how he talked to Ron, Hermione and the rest of his friends, how he couldn't really talk to them. He knew they'd been through so much together but they still didn't understand what it was like;
Hey stranger ;)
I move the chair back, the wood grates awkwardly on the floor, making us flinch. I sit down, the silence is unnerving.
They got out of their respective beds and waved to the other occupants. As soon as they left they looked at each other awkwardly, the medical wing had felt like a sanctuary where they could do whatever they felt, but now, standing outside its protective doors they were at a loss.
Although Draco had, had a crush on Harry since his second year at Hogwarts, he hadn't realised it was a crush until his fourth year when he'd seen Harry risk his life in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. The nervousness he'd felt when he saw Harry trying to get the egg from the dragon, or when he'd been nearly scared to death when Harry had been late coming back from the lake or how he was terrified when Harry had entered the Maze, or when had returned from the maze, sobbing over Cedric's body.
"Stupify!" Someone yells and I duck again only to find the spell was directed at one of the new death eaters, not me. They fall to the ground, lying still. One of my two opponents leaves me to fight someone else at a quick word to his companion.
bi actually, wbu?
"Congratulations, I guess?" Neville says to the new couple before continuing on to himself, "seems like everyone has been paired off with someone except me..."
I take another step.
uhh, welllllllllllllllllllllll.......
I got a crush on a guy and I saw myself kissing men and women... why?
u wont go tellling the prophet all my deep dark secrets will u
"Expelliarmus!"
Draco sighed in relief and looked over at Harry, who had somehow gotten under his covers and was pretending to sleep. Draco smiled at him amusedly, Harry opened one eye and looked over at Draco. Draco had to put a hand over his mouth at the bizarreness of the situation they were now in.
ill ask him out to Hogsmeade and he just wants to go to the great hall and pig out on all the food
typical for a Gryffindor
"you have a lot of wrackspurts flying around your head," she said dreamily while looking through her spectaspecs at Draco.
if thats how u feel u probably shouldnt be dating
He hit send.
"Blaise was acting weird, he told me to wait for him so he could tell Draco that you are Okay, but he seemed shifty and almost like he was fighting himself, and now I can't find either of them!"
hello?
"I don't know Harry, I'm just going to use my name," (Hermione)
yes Drayco?
i have a potions assignment that im avoiding but im gwed
"That's weird Ron." (Hermione)
"Well then I guess we could be girlfriend and girlfriend," Luna said smiling brightly as she slipped her hand into Ginny's then leaned forward and gave Ginny a quick kiss on her cheek. Ginny went bright red.
Blaise takes a step forward. His eyes now focused on Draco. He stumbles, and his expression changes to confusion before flashing back to determination. He takes another step and again almost trips.
"Agreed," I say, clutching my wand in hand. My body shakes in trepidation.
brb, hermione wants to talk
"Only if you want to..." Draco bit his lip uncertainty, as if regretting saying anythi g at all, oh why had he opened his big mouth?
"Yeah, same here," Harry sighed and looked at Draco again. Against his will be felt his stomach flutter.
"Yes, I know," He says nodding.
Harry stared at Draco in shock, trying to process the words as Draco tried to turn and run. His eyes held fear as he turned but Harry grabbed his arm and prevented him from leaving.
"Nope, not really," she says tightly her eyes gazing off somewhere to the left of Harry as she remembered what had happened earlier.
The sun is close to setting when I finally have everything set up, Pansy told me a few minutes ago that Draco was heading down and my stomach exploded into even more nervous butterflies. Except these butterflies were more like wasps that make my insides burn.
I used to be, i regret it
Where are you?
"So, I was right!"
all the time? I know the feeling.
Harry cast a levitation spell on Draco's unconscious body, intending to take him up to the infirmary once he was sure everyone else could deal with the rest of the mess. Everyone seemed to be injured in some way, Pansy was limping with Hermione helping her walk despite the large gash across her cheek. Neville was barely standing up with blood all over him, it was unclear where the blood stemmed from though.
"You doing alright?" Harry whispered softly.
"cool?"
"Blaise? Do you know how to fix it?" (Draco)
ur humour, and hopeful stuff
ahhhhhh... IthinkIlikeLuna
what year r u in?
"You guys are the worst." (Draco)
Theo noticed that everyone seemed paired up with someone except Neville. Though the way the rest were paired was subtle, compared to Draco and Potter's way of showing it.
yes, flying is a bit like that, an escape
"I brought some food that I made with the school's house elves, I hope you like it," I smile at Draco. I made some of his favourites, homemade chocolate is actually kinda hard to make but Draco loves sweets so I had to give it a try, I brought some regular sandwiches too cos I didn't want to just bring sweets.
Was he really going to do this, according to the library clock it was 5:30 am, would he even be awake?
Hermione's POV (sorta but more kinda just 3rd pov of the group) (3rd person)
"But I do know Daph, you know how many gay wizards there are? Or bisexual? One in twenty, according to wizgay news
I don't think i like him anymore
I know, I know, I'm probably worried over nothing
Harry had pretended to sleep and had tried hard to actually sleep but he still found himself awake. He had also pretended not to notice Ron as he quietly worried for Blaise. He pretended not to notice when Hermione had reached out to graze Pansy's hand that had fallen off the bed as she'd slept. He had pretended not to see Pansy's small fingers curl around Hermione's. He tried not to notice Neville's heavy breathing as he clearly watched something in his dream that hurt him enough for him to quietly whimper into his pillow.
(bonus) (created after the final chapter was written)
oh, who are they?
"But aren't you curious? I can imagine it both ways hmm.."
how we supposed to help each other if we don't know who the other is?
"I've had a crush on you for what feels like forever," he said quickly, his gaze looking away from Harry, "like before we started talking. but it's not like I could really express it, nor was I really fully aware that that was what I was feeling towards you, I fooled myself into believing that I despised you for a long time and it worked." Draco gasped as he finished, his words seeming to be pulled from him by a rope.
"Sure what's your potronus?" he looks a little sick.
Blaise grabbed Draco's arm tightly as soon as they left the safety of the dorm using the secret passageway that they had in case of emergencies. Draco didn't understand why they had to go this way but he didn't really care, he really needed to see Harry.
Harry didn't cry, but his eyes dulled and he went blank, no emotion showed on his face, instead, he turned away toward the shower. He undressed and stepped into it, he didn't bother turning on both taps, just one on full blast. He didn't even notice whether it was hot or cold, he was numb, inside and out.
maybe? why r u asking?
Sorry the date was sucky I've never been on one myself lol
Ron yells when he spots an injured Blaise dragging an unconscious Draco. He runs in front of them and starts casting random spells at anyone who steps towards them. Ron's desperate to protect Blaise from harm as Blaise tries to move Draco away from the conflict. Blaise is glaring at Ron, clearly not wanting Ron's help after their prior tension.
"And you know what'll happen if you do it again?" I ask. I watch as his expression lights up as he reads into what I'm saying.
"You would do nicely," Draco said blushing.
|: Harry? where are you?
"Stupify!"
"Yeah, you're right, Lumos!" her wand started to glow, lighting up the wood of the trunk and illuminating the clear writing.
"What the fuck did you do? Why is my name 'SlyFerret'?" (Draco)
"Is there something on my face? why are you staring at my face...?" he blushes harder.
I find Pansy near the common room looking panicked, the darkness of the evening defining her panicked features, when she sees me her face becomes even more panicked and she runs to me.
"Your feet are cold," Draco complained trying to recoil. But it was too late, Harry's arms now enclosed him and Harry was sound asleep.
"Stupify!" I yell and point at the closest Death Eater.
perfect, it didn't reveal how much he wanted to talk to the Gryffindor.
Why aren't you answering me?
"what should I call myself in the chat thing?" (Harry)
but what if she doesnt like me that way
come to think of it I haven't seen Pansy or Blaise either
*laughs maniacally*
sure, sure. u r a guy tho, ur name says so
Draco's POV(1st person)
"So what do you want my help with?" Draco asks.
"N-nothing," he says rather quickly, she smirked and rolled her eyes.
no! of course not, i never wanted to be on his side once i met him
"Wait, what?" he says confusedly, redirecting his gaze while blushing furiously...?
Draco's kiss isn't like any of that, it is hard and demanding yet it has a softness to it that feels completely right.
Harry's POV 1st person
When do you want to meet up?
same, hmmm
y dont we just ask questions
i deserve it.
Draco's P.O.V (3rd person)
"When was the last time you saw him?" I ask, I'm getting a little worried now, where is he?
"I don't know and even if I did I wouldn't tell you," (Pansy)
Draco's POV
well, i got picked on by both the students and teachers as usual, so fine, just fine.
"They're fine, they've been through a lot to get this far so I'm sure they can get through a date too," I say slightly annoyed.
"I guess it's cold, do you want something to warm you up?" Harry asked, looking for his glasses, so that he could find where Madam Pomfrey had put his wand.
"You're not the real Blaise, are you! or well, you are at least under the imperious curse!" Draco said loudly, his voice ringing sharply as he stood about fifteen metres in from the edge of the forbidden forest.
I am a verrrrry helpful person ;)
His room is stylish as expected, adorned with expensive green-silk curtains and silver mirrors. a painting of Salazar Slytherin, luckily it doesn't move otherwise I would probably be a bit creeped out, although it also means that he cant tell me what happened in here if anything.
Then he leans down and softly presses his lips to mine.
The way Harry had been bullied as a child, abused although mostly verbal or as Dudley's 'punching bag'. There were also the times when Vernon had hit him, when he'd done something strange, and out of the ordinary. When those time happened he was beaten black and blue, but it was in places rarely seen by anyone, always hidden away, neither Ron nor Hermione had seen the other scar he had just below the hip, easily concealed by just wearing boxers.
I'm in the house I used to have in Godric's hollow with my parents when they were alive, I stare around the room not know what I want to do. I move around the room, examining the furniture the design, everything. After a while, I lay on the couch and close my eyes, thinking of my parents and how I know they want me to be happy, happy and alive. Draco makes me happy...
Gryffindors often r
well I think I like... uh.. someone of the same gender as me
go shag him already then blondie
hope doesn't work everytime, u have terrible humour
Harry Potter or maybe Neville most likely former
The room misted up and his skin burned, but he didn't notice, he cleaned his, face, hair and body then stepped out of the cubicle to dry himself. With a quick flick of his wand, he had a basic glamour, the tinge of red from his skin wasn't visible, nor were the scars or the dark circles under his eyes.
"I've never heard of a Malfoy who was good at apologizing, why would you be the first," I smiled half-heartedly and went to have a shower, leaving Blaise sprawled comfortably on the bed.
perfect, just perfect, as if school wasnt enough to stress over
"Sometime this morning, around eight I think,"
y r u so mean 2 me Dray?
"Where do you think he is?"
right
"Argh how do I change it to something not stupid?" (Draco)
Harry's P.O.V (1st person)
what do i have to do to make u like me again???
"Theo? What are you thinking about? you're blushing..." Daphne asks, startling the pinning Slytherin out of his stupor.
i think we have good reason to be worried, I can feel it, something isnt right
u calling me broken?
Luna's head is in my lap as we lay at the top of the astronomy tower. We gaze up at the sky that's filled with crystal-like stars, they sparkle at us like faraway fireflies.
Harry's POV 1st person
"Yes," the rest of the group collectively say, or well, they say words the mean yes at the same time.
Luna and Ginny run to the death eater that was originally fighting Harry and together form a (dynamic) duo fighting the killer.
ahh, yes? y?
And Harry replied almost instantly.
He ignores her, instead of heading up the astronomy tower to try and relieve his stress. He rather likes the stars, a constant in his life unlike everything else.
"There's nothing wrong with your face, it's per---" he shuts his mouth quicker than a snitch flys when you start a Quidditch match. He bites his lip nervously.
u r being nice and helpful
Instead, Harry's mind started playing the scenes he saw earlier repeatedly in his head, how could this have happened? he thought it was safe in Hogwarts. But then again, when had it ever really been safe at Hogwarts? Not a single year of him being here went without a hitch, first, the philosopher's stone, then Riddles diary, the whole Time Turner debacle and the other shit that happened to him that year. And who could forget the Triwizard tournament? And fifth year? Wasn't that
The ornate door appears from the stone wall. I stand staring at it then push it open, my eyes widen.
y r u seriously thinking about this, he bullied you for years
I close my eyes and the next thing I know is someones shaking me.
I waited nervously in the back of the library, my fingers drummed against the table in a steady beat calming my nerves. We were actually going to see each other in real life, like one-on-one, compared to how we used to be, fighting 24/7. Hopefully, we can manage to be civil without the mask the phone screen provided, we would see each other's faces as we talked, it would be harder to hide our true emotions, although I have had a mask on my face since the age of 6.
... i can't tell u.
"Yes, I do."
y is ur name 'BendyMan'?
"Well, I mean, I was watching you all the time whenever you were around me. And I did spend a whole year following you around, heh," I say awkwardly.
well, i can't say i'm not broken, i lost too much
I see Hermione sitting by the tree next to the lake and head toward her, nervously wondering whether she hates me or not. I notice the almost predatory stares I get from the students around me, after all, it's a nice day, most people are outside. Hermione is the only one who is actually studying the rest are chatting with friends or playing games.
"I'm sorry, I'm just so nervous, I really like you and I've enjoyed getting to know you when we were just texting," Pansy looks at me and I turn back to her, she grabs onto my hand and pulls me towards her. I let her hold me and relax into her soft touch.
Draco shivered in horror,
"Just because, :P" (Pansy)
Why don't we go flying on the quidditch pitch? then we could go on a walk then maybe a picnic?
3rd person pov (Hermione's group)(Neville, Ron and her, I think..?)
"he assured me that he would break up with her soon, when he found the right time, but he never did and well, today, well I guess yesterday now," he said his eyes straying to the antique clock I kept on the wall, "she broke up with him, and he got furious about it in the common room, and even told his best friend to side with him so that they could get back together, I left after that, I only got back here a half-hour before you, I guess your room is just better than mine for when you want to wallow. anyway..." Blaise sat up on my bed and examined me, "why do you look so, so sallow,"
so? i'm very forgiving, and he never did anything
A light rustling comes from a few feet away and out comes....
i don't want to scare u off..
I feel sorry for my father, I don't think he ever truly loved anyone, maybe not even mother.
No, No. It's not that... this just feels so weird. I don't know how to act anymore...
I stare at his lips, my eyes are probably a little hazy. Draco stops laughing and looks right back at me. His eyes search mine for something and suddenly he reaches up with his hand and takes off my glasses. I can still see him but not quite as clearly.
I couldn't exactly wear my best robes, for Merlin's sake, we were going flying. He could have given me more warning, but no, he has to tell me half an hour before. I end up wearing a casual Slytherin green robe over a shirt and a pair of black muggle jeans I am rather fond of. I briefly considered wearing my old quidditch robes but decided against it, for 1, they're a little small on me now as I've grown an inch or so since I last played and 2, it would feel weird to wear them on a date, with Potter of all people.
"Now!" Pansy shouts.
"You need to find him, he was turning a ghostly grey the last time I saw him." She says then twirls her wand and sends her potronus to McGonagall, saying that she found me.
its 6:30 we better get dressed for breakfast cya at 4.
"I'm sorry B, I'm such an idiot. I know you shouldn't forgive me and I can't give you any excuses. But, you need to know-" I could really tell he was struggling a lot to say this, he has never been good with being honest about how he really feels.
We head to the Quidditch pitch first because we're already outside, after twenty minutes we conclude he isn't there, so we head to the owlery and he isn't there either.
"Of course Harry isn't straight Ronald," (Hermione)
"Ahh, okay then," Harry slowly maneuvered himself out of his bed and Draco shuffled over hiding his face a little. Was Harry really about to cuddle him to warm him up?
tbh? Im not sure... bi-curious maybe?
You planned this didn't you.
also im sticking to joining a few chapters together to make it longer
"Why do we have to do this???" (Draco)
She turned to Draco, her eyes looking at invisible being around his head.
"Sorry Draco, I have my orders." (Blaise)
Draco eventually found Luna in a clearing, feeding the thestrals chunks of meat, she's must have stopped riding them.
"I'm not sure that's a good idea," he gets up from the chair and sprints out of the room. leaving me to sit alone at the table, confused questions running through my head.
"So how'd you think their date went?" Pansy asks me.
Draco's P.O.V (1st person)
"Wait 'Mione, can I call you that?"
"Hi," my voice is scratchy as though I haven't used it in weeks and I cough to get rid of it, then smile awkwardly up at Draco. He's a few inches taller than me and I suddenly envisage us kissing and me leaning up on my tiptoes to capture his lips. I blush heavily and beckon Draco to sit down on the picnic blanket with me.
"I was right, I told you ages ago that your unhealthy obsession with one another was because you guys were unable to admit to each other that you had crushes on the other!" Pansy says excitedly.
Theodore's POV
Not the ones for Harry, Draco, Pansy or Blaise, it was like they had fallen off the face of the planet.
riiight
why aren't u in Slytherin then?
Pansy rolls her eyes and sulks about the fact that I don't care that she predicted this whole thing. I'm used to her predicting things by now, it doesn't affect me anymore.
He brushed a finger over Neville's forehead and tucked a piece of hair behind his ear in doing so. he felt embarrassed and stepped back. This small action made Neville wake up from his nightmare. he blinked owlishly at the surrounding darkness, slightly disorientated, after a moment his eyes focused on the terrified form of Theo who was standing still beside Neville, with his arm still slightly raised from his previous action.
"Sorry I interrupted your sleep, I should get going now," Theo said stepping away from the bed, realising he still had his arm raised he let it drop awkwardly to his side.
"He broke free! Get him!" one of the Death Eater's shout, I have no clue which, I'm too stressed out
"I guess you're right about that, hey.. who do you think is the top out of those two?"
"It is probably escaped death eaters, they probably want him because he betrayed them and also didn't get a sentence in Azkaban and instead was basically under house arrest during the summer and he was allowed back in Hogwarts but only with a wand with restrictive spells on it, maybe it's because I spoke for him at his trial..." I ramble on...
maybe.
anything
They grab ahold of me and drag me into a little alcove.
Then I see them, my friends. Hermione, Luna, Ginny, Neville and Ron.
This is the first kiss I've had that I've really felt throughout my entire body, it sends tingles to the tips of my toes. I smile into the kiss feeling like this is what it's meant to feel like. Not like Cho's salty wet and gentle kiss, or like Ginny's firey but still too soft kiss.
np Mione
make you date?
Hermione holds up a finger to signal silence, they all stand still waiting with trepidation for a sound.
"What happened," Harry asked trying to be more concerned considering his current state of mind.
Hi...
Harry woke up to the sudden movement of Draco beside him, Draco was looking at Harry as he adjusted to his surroundings a small smile present on his face.
I take a deep break and let it all out. "Would, would you, maybe consider, umm, goingonadatewithme?"
"Pansy give it back!" (Draco)
"You do what you feel is right, Ron has given Slytherin a second chance despite everything we did and what he was brought up to believe about our house as a whole. But it is your choice ultimately whether you want to forgive him. He knows what he did was wrong and irreversible, but you need to be the judge on whether the relationship you had with him is something you want to pursue. If he made you feel loved, safe and happy chances are you could still have an amazing relationship together that may or may not last a long time. It is your choice." I am shocked by my own advice, I wasn't aware that I could sound as wise as I did just then.
Blaise hadn't moved voluntarily since passing out during the fight and Ron having woken up a few minutes ago in the bed next to his had immediately moved his bed closer to Blaise, being careful not to actually touch him he pulled Blaise's sheets closer to his chin, clear worry evident in his expression.
Ginny and Luna step out from the bushes, holding hands. their expressions show excitement with a good mixing of guilt.
I jot down a few things Draco is saying, trying to actually concentrate this time, I can still feel the heat in my cheeks, and I use that to make sure I don't embarrass myself again.
u rly r a natural
platinum blonde hair
The moment he had heard that Neville and a few others were in the hospital wing he had decided that he was going to sneak in later that night. He wasn't going just because of his crush on Neville though, he was worried about Blaise and Draco. Despite having been distant with them from the start of the year, Theodore still cared about his old friends and didn't wish for them to be harmed in any way.
"And you want my opinion on this?"
this is great, just perfect.
what? ehy?
Draco lifted the messaging device off the table and carefully read through the messages Harry and him had sent one another to reassure himself that it was real.
I need to find Harry and fix things with him, I could text him but I left the device thing that I still haven't named (hehe) yet back on my bedside table and I'm nowhere near there, I have potions soon though so I should see him there.
